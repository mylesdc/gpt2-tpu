The substituents on the phenanthrene moiety play an important role for maintaining high in vivo antiviral activity.",

Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), the type member of Tobamovirus genus, is a prevalent plant pathogen all over the world and has the widest host range of over 885 plant species in 65 families. Most TMVs have infected a number of economically important crops and have induced general mosaic symptoms to cause significant economic losses worldwide [2] . It is found that in certain fields 90-100% of the plants show mosic or leaf necrosis by harvesting time. Therefore, this plant virus has the name ''plant cancer'' and is difficult to control.",

However, there are no control measures that can totally inhibit plant viruses after they have infected plants. Ningnanmycin (Figure 1) , perhaps the most successful registered antiplant viral agent, displayed 56.0% in vivo curative effect at 500 mg/mL. Ribavirin (Figure 1 ) is another widely used plantviral inhibitor, its inhibitory effects are also less than 50% at 500 mg/mL. Because of the unsatisfactory cure rate (30-60%) of common antiviral agents (Ningnanmycin, Ribavirin, Virus A, et al.) and economic loss of tobacco, many efforts have been done to develop novel, potent and structure concise antiviral agents. Some chemicals, such as triazolyl compounds [3] , pyrazole derivatives [4, 5] , cyanoacrylate derivatives [5, 6] , a-aminophosphonate derivatives [5, 7] , N-(pyrimidin-5-yl)-N9-phenylureas [8] , and some natural products [9] [10] [11] , have been found to possess antiviral activity. However, there are only a few reports on economically viable antiviral chemicals available for application in agriculture [12] , so there still lies a great deal of scope for further research in this field.",

            "text": "In summary, based on the literature report and our previous work, a series of phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids 1-24 were designed, prepared and evaluated for their anti-TMV activity for the first time. The in vitro and in vivo antiviral bioassays showed that most of these alkaloids exhibited good to excellent in vivo anti-TMV activity, of which compounds 1, 2, 15 and 16 displayed significantly higher activity than (R)-antofine and commercial Ningnanmycin at the same test condition. The in vitro activity and in vivo activity of each alkaloid are about similar, which indicates that these alkaloids possess a good biological availability. The introduction of 6-hydroxyl, which is proposed to interact with TMV RNA, did increased anti-TMV activity. The 14aRconfiguration was confirmed to be the preferred antiviral configuration for phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids. Introduction of hydroxy group at 15-position of phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids increased antiviral activity for S-configuration but decreased activity for R-configuration. Present study provides fundamental support for development and optimization of phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids as potential inhibitors of plant virus. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on anti-TMV activity of phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids. Further studies on mode of action are currently underway in our laboratories.
