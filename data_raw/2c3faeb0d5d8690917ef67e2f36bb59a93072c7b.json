Both innate and adaptive immunity have been shown to be important in controlling Brucella infection. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) represent a group of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that play critical roles in the host innate immune response, as well as development of adaptive immunity. In the current report, we investigated the role of TLR signaling in the clearance of Brucella and development of adaptive immunity in TLR2 \u2212/\u2212 , TLR4 \u2212/\u2212 , or MyD88 \u2212/\u2212 mice following aerosol exposure to B. melitensis 16 M. Consistent with previous reports, MyD88 is required for efficient clearance of Brucella from all three organs (lung, spleen, and liver). The results reveal Th2-skewed immune responses in TLR2 \u2212/\u2212 mice late in infection and support a TLR2 requirement for efficient clearance of Brucella from the lungs, but not from the spleen or liver. Similarly, TLR4 is required for efficient clearance of Brucella from the lung, but exhibits a minor contribution to clearance from the spleen and no demonstrable contribution to clearance from the liver. Lymphocyte proliferation assays suggest that the TLRs are not involved in the development of cell-mediated memory response to Brucella antigen. Antibody detection reveals that TLR2 and 4 are required to generate early antigen-specific IgG, but not during the late stages of infection. TLR2 and 4 are only transiently required for IgM production and not at all for IgA production. In contrast, MyD88 is essential for antigen specific IgG production late in infection, but is not required for IgM generation over the course of infection. Surprisingly, despite the prominent role for MyD88 in clearance from all tissues, MyD88-knockout mice express significantly higher levels of serum IgA. These results confirm the important role of MyD88 in controlling infection in the spleen while providing evidence of a prominent contribution to protection in other tissues. In addition, although TLR4 and TLR2 contribute little to control of spleen infection, a significant contribution to clearance of lung infection is described.

Brucellosis is one of the most important worldwide zoonotic diseases. Ten species have been identified to date, three of which, including B. melitensis, B. abortus, and B. suis are virulent in humans and represent a significant threat to public health (Atluri et al., 2011) . Humans often become infected following inhalation of particles carrying the bacteria or consumption of dairy products contaminated with the organism. Although vaccination is used to successfully reduce the spread of disease, the risk remains high in underdeveloped nations. There are currently no vaccines available that are safe for use in humans, and although generally effective, antibiotic treatments do not always prevent disease recrudescence. As a result of these factors and concern over their potential weaponization, NIH and the CDC/USDA have classified these three species as category B agents.",

The role of innate immunity against infection by this pathogen has drawn recent attention as a result of awareness of the role of innate immunity in the establishment of infection and the development of adaptive immunity (Weiss et al., 2005; Oliveira et al., 2011) . In contrast, adaptive immunity, including cell-mediated and humoral responses, has been the prominent focus of Brucella research over the past few decades. The innate immune system is composed of a variety of cellular and humoral components, which are the first line of the host defense against invading pathogens. Recognition relies on pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) expressed on/in the cellular components of the innate immune system. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are the best characterized PRRs. Receptorligand interaction via TLRs induces the production of antimicrobial peptides and proinflammatory cytokines through NF-\u03baB, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and other signaling pathways (Kawai and Akira, 2006) . As a result, TLR signaling is critical to development of the host innate immune response, including recruitment of dendritic cells (DCs) and T effector cells, and upregulation of MHC I and II on antigen presenting cells (APCs) and by extension adaptive immunity against infection. 10 TLRs in human and 13 in the mouse have been identified to date (Kawai and Akira, 2006) . TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, and TLR9 recognizing lipopeptide, lipopolysaccharides, flagellin and CpG DNA, respectively, are known to be important in controlling bacterial infections. With the exception of TLR3, the TLRs require the adapter molecule myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) for signal transduction (Kawai and Akira, 2007) . As expected, MyD88 have been shown to be essential for clearance of Brucella infection from mice (Weiss et al., 2005; Copin et al., 2007; Macedo et al., 2008) .",

            "text": "The role of TLR4 in Brucella infection remains controversial. Some studies suggest that TLR4 is required to control Brucella replication in the mouse (Campos et al., 2004; Copin et al., 2007; Macedo et al., 2008) ; others indicate that TLR4 is not involved (Weiss et al., 2005; Barquero-Calvo et al., 2007) . The use of different Brucella strains/species in these experiments may account for the observed differences. The influence of the route of infection on the role of TLRs in studies with other pathogens suggests a need to do so with brucellosis, as is the role of TLR-mediated innate immunity in the development of adaptive immune response. These studies employed intraperitoneal (i.p.) inoculation, which is not a typical route for Brucella infection. As a result of these reports, the consensus of scientific opinion is that MyD88 contributes significantly to the control of Brucella infection while TLR-based signaling plays a lesser role at best. The absence of any role for TLR signaling is consistent with results indicating that the Brucella protein TcpB interrupts TLR-based signaling by promoting degradation of MyD88 adaptor like protein, MAL (Chaudhary et al., 2012) , and modification of Brucella LPS reduces agonist activity (Duenas et al., 2004) . However, these studies have been restricted to an atypical route of exposure, and the potential for differential TLR expression associated with different tissues has not been considered (Juarez et al., 2010) . Since inhalation represents a major concern to public health, experiments were undertaken to determine the role of TLR signaling in the control of Brucella infection following aerosol exposure. The current study, investigates the roles of TLR2, TLR4, and MyD88 in clearance of Brucella following respiratory exposure and development of adaptive immune response against Brucella. Since the mucosal/respiratory system is the primary portal of entry for human infection documented in many laboratory incidents and relevant to biothreats, it is important to understand the pathogenesis and immune responses resulting from aerosol exposure.",

Bacterial load recovered from the lungs of TLR2 \u2212/\u2212 , TLR4 \u2212/\u2212 , and MyD88 \u2212/\u2212 mice during the first two weeks following exposure is not significantly different from the C57BL/6 control mice (Figure 1 , panels W1-2), indicating that TLR2, TLR4, and MyD88 are not required to clear lung infection early. A significant difference in bacterial burden is detectable by week 4 and extends through week 10, indicating that the contribution of TLR2, TLR4, and MyD88 to the control of Brucella infection in the lungs occurs via adaptive immunity (Figure 1 ). By week 4 p.i., there was a significant difference in the clearance of the organism from each of the knockouts. This pattern persisted through week 10, although significance is lost due to the reduction in the number of animals available at this time point. The absence of MyD88 appears to have a greater impact on the clearance of infection from the lungs over this period, as the bacterial burden in the lungs of MyD88 \u2212/\u2212 mice is significantly higher than that in TLR2 \u2212/\u2212 and TLR4 \u2212/\u2212 mice by week 8 p.i.

The MyD88 \u2212/\u2212 knockout appears to have a reduced ability to control the infection as evidenced by the significant difference in spleen colonization by week 4 (Figure 2 , panel W4).

The results presented reveal detectable levels of IgM by 2 weeks p.i. that peaks by 4 weeks p.i. (Figure 5 , panel A). IgM levels begin to decline in the MyD88 \u2212/\u2212 and C57BL/6 mice at 4 weeks p.i. while, IgM levels in the TLR2 \u2212/\u2212 and TLR4 \u2212/\u2212 mice plateau at 4 weeks with a gradual decline by 10 weeks p.i. Any requirement for TLR2 and TLR4 in IgM production is transient (only at 4 weeks p.i.). and IgM levels were never significantly different between MyD88 \u2212/\u2212 and C57BL/6 mice throughout the experiment. Total Brucella-specific IgG in wild-type mice is detectable starting 4 weeks post-infection (Figure 5, panel B) , and increases continuously over the next 6 weeks. In contrast, elevation of the Brucella specific IgG levels is delayed in all of the knockout mice. Comparison among the groups revealed that, between weeks 4 and 8 p.i., IgG levels in TLR2 \u2212/\u2212 and TLR4 \u2212/\u2212 mice are significantly lower than that observed in the C57BL/6 mice. IgG levels increase in TLR4 \u2212/\u2212 and TLR2 \u2212/\u2212 mice by 10 weeks p.i. to levels that are not significantly different from the control C57BL/6 mice. In contrast, IgG levels in MyD88 \u2212/\u2212 mice exhibit a significant reduction in titer over the course of infection. Serum IgA is not detected in the TLR2 \u2212/\u2212 and TLR4 \u2212/\u2212 mice, nor in C57BL/6 mice out to week 10 ( Figure 5 , panel C).

These results are consistent with previous reports describing enhanced sensitivity of BALB/c mice to Brucella infection following i.p. inoculation (Copin et al., 2007) , confirming the expected immunological outcome despite the use of different routes of inoculation. One explanation for the improved clearance from C57BL6 mice is generation of a TH1-skewed immune response as opposed to a TH2-skewed response in BALB/c mice (Watanabe et al., 2004) . TLR activation induces the maturation of APCs, enhances antigen presentation, up-regulation of co-stimulatory molecules and cytokine production. Cytokine profiles produced by APCs control CD4 + T cell differentiation into either TH1 or TH2 cells. Engagement of different TLRs is expected to affect cytokine production, with significant effect on CD4 + T cell differentiation (Dabbagh and Lewis, 2003) .

Brucella virulence derives from expression of an LPS with reduced agonist activity that limits activation of innate immunity and development of an effective adaptive response that promotes invasion and establishment of a replicative niche. In addition, Brucella express a protein TcpB (or Btp1) that restricts the proinflammatory response by interfering with MyD88 function. The result is enhanced degradation of MAL (MyD88-adapter-like protein) and restricted expression of NF\u03baB. However, our current results indicate infection varies in different tissues, and that this variation is attributable in part to various PRRs, including TLR2, TLR4, and downstream signaling partners, like MyD88. Interference with TLR signaling by the organism has been described in numerous studies, as has the prominent contribution of MyD88 in limiting infection. The results reported here confirm the importance of MyD88 in the control of infection and extend those findings to include three tissues; spleen, liver and lung. In addition, the experiments performed confirm previous findings concerning the lack of significant contribution of TLR4 and TLR2 with regard to spleen (and liver) infection, but reveal their significant contribution preventing lung infection.",

Since cellular immunity is critical in controlling Brucella infection, splenocytes were used to characterize the role of TLR2, TLR4 and MyD88 in the development of cellmediated adaptive immunity against Brucella. Finding that the loss of TLR2, TLR4 and MyD88 had no demonstrable effect on the development of memory T cell response against Brucella infection was initially a surprise (Figure 4) . However, recent experiments have revealed a disruption of TLR signaling resulting from enhanced degradation of MyD88-adaptor like protein (MAL) that is consistent with previous reports documenting a minimal role for TLR signaling in memory T cell development against other viral and bacterial infections (Way et al., 2003; Fremond et al., 2004; Heer et al., 2007; Seibert et al., 2010; McBride et al., 2011) . These results are also in agreement with a recent study showing that IRAK4 (interleukin-1 receptor associated kinase 4), one of the kinases recruited by MyD88 upon stimulation, is not required for generation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells producing IFN-\u03b3 in the late stage of Brucella infection (Oliveira et al., 2011) . These results suggest that TLR-independent signaling is likely involved in the development of cellular adaptive immunity against Brucella.",

However, the differences in IgM production between knockouts are only transitory and have no correlation with differences in immune clearance. In general, IgG levels are significantly reduced in each of the knockout mice. However, the effect in the TLR4 and TLR2 knockouts is transient, while reduced IgG levels are consistently observed in the absence of MyD88 function. A second marker associated with the loss of MyD88 is the significant level of circulating IgA observed in the MyD88 knockout mice. Surprisingly, serum IgA levels were elevated in MyD88 \u2212/\u2212 mice, but not in TLR2 \u2212/\u2212 and TLR4 \u2212/\u2212 mice following Brucella infection, suggesting that the IgA class switch recombination or secretion is enhanced in MyD88 knockout mice. Alternatively, higher Brucella burden in the lung constantly stimulates IgA secretion. However, this hypothesis is not supported by the fact that serum IgA is not detected in the TLR2 and TLR4 knockout mice despite similar levels of bacterial burden in the lung. In fact, this phenomenon has been previously reported in MyD88 \u2212/\u2212 mice orally vaccinated with attenuated Salmonella expressing a Streptococcus pneumoniae surface antigen (Park et al., 2008) . It could prove useful to understand the biological mechanism involved and its potential application to vaccine design. The contribution of either elevated IgA or suppressed IgG to the inability of MyD88 knockouts to control infection is under investigation.",

The results reveal a significant contribution of TLR4 and MyD88 to IgG1 production and the importance of TLR2 and MyD88 to IgG2a production. Examination of the IgG1/IgG2a ratio suggests the dependence of a protective T H 1 response on expression of MyD88 and TLR2, but not TLR4. This is not a totally unexpected result since the Brucella LPS, and/or TcpB primarily exert their influence on TLR4-based signaling. The contribution of MyD88 and TLR2 to protective immune response as determined by the reduced bacterial burden in selected tissues is borne out in previous discussion.

In contrast, our results reveal that production of Brucella specific IgG is delayed in TLR2 and TLR4 knockout mice and impaired in MyD88 knockout mice. Possible reasons for the discrepancies include the use of different Brucella species, B. melitensis 16 M vs B. abortus S19, differences in virulence and different routes of inoculation (aerosol exposure vs. intraperitoneal injection). Since IgM production is not affected by MyD88 deficiency and only transiently affected by TLR2 and TLR4 absence, we conclude that TLR2, TLR4 and MyD88 are critical for IgG class switch recombination, which might be critical to the control of Brucella infection, and should be considered when Brucella designing vaccines.",

It should be noted that based on results of previous studies Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology www.frontiersin.org September 2012 | Volume 2 | Article 115 | 8 following i.p. inoculation in which only the spleens were examined, it was concluded that Brucella infection was unaffected by the loss of TLR2, however, bacterial load in the lungs and livers were not determined in these studies.
