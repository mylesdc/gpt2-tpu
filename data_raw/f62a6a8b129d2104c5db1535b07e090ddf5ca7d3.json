The use of LMA plates permits the direct nucleic acids extraction of the captured viruses without the need of any preliminary elution step. Molecular detection and quantification of airborne viruses is performed using real-time quantitative (RT-)PCR (Q(RT-)PCR) technique. The method has been tested using Adenoviruses (AdVs) and Noroviruses (NoVs) GII, as representative DNA and RNA viruses, respectively. Moreover, the method has been tested successfully in outdoor experiments, by detecting and quantifying human adenoviruses (HAdVs) in the airborne environment of a wastewater treatment plant. Conclusions: The great advantage of LMA is that nucleic acids extraction is performed directly on the LMA plates, while the eluted nucleic acids are totally free of inhibitory substances. Coupled with QPCR the whole procedure can be completed in less than three (3) hours.",

There is a growing concern regarding exposure to bioaerosols since they represent major health and economic risks to human and animal populations. Exposure to airborne viruses in different environments is responsible for various health problems and disorders worldwide [1] . Moreover, there is an increased concern of using highly pathogenic airborne microorganisms, as bioterrorism agents. Aerosolization of viral pathogens occurs in processes such as spray irrigation of wastewater and operation of sewage treatment plants, but also from humans and animals as a result of coughing, sneezing, breathing, especially in indoor air environments [1] [2] [3] . The question of airborne transmission is especially important for the waste treatment plant workers and for healthcare workers where patients tend to congregate during for example influenza season [4] . Many highly pathogenic viruses, such as SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which causes severe acute respiratory syndrome, a highly infectious disease with a significant mortality, have the potential of being converted from droplet to airborne transmission and for that reason health care workers are particularly vulnerable [5] . Airborne spread of the SARS epidemic has been suggested for the transmission of the disease in Hong Kong in 2003 and several epidemiological studies have proposed an airborne transmission for various pathogenic viruses [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] .",

Many types of samplers have been used over the years, including liquid impingers, solid impactors, filters, electrostatic precipitators, and many others [8] . In this study, we used low melting agarose (LMA) as a capture medium instead of agar based media, since preliminary spiking experiments using Tryptic Soy Agar (TSA) resulted in very pure recovery efficiencies (5-10% recoveries, data not shown), due to inhibition of the final Q (RT-)PCRs. Agar itself has been reported to cause inhibition of the PCR assay [11] . On the other hand, the use of LMA has been shown to improve the PCR amplification from templates which were naturally contaminated by various PCR inhibitors [12] .",

Virus titres of approximately 10 5 copies/ml for HAdV, and 10 6 copies/ml for NoV were used. In order to test the efficiency of virus recovery from LMA plates, three (3) different sets of samples were spiked with serial dilutions of 100 \u03bcl viral suspensions in PBS and spread on the surface of the plates, using a 2 \u03bcl eppendorf pipette.

Usually, sampling with this type of air samplers is performed using agar based media [8] . The drawback of agar plates is that viruses have to be eluted from the agar plates before the subsequent nucleic acid extraction step, which results in viral losses. Moreover, inhibitory substances presented in the agar media tend to remain during the subsequent NA isolation and finally inhibit the Q (RT-)PCR reactions, thus considerably reducing the detection limit of airborne viruses. In contrary, the great advantage of LMA is that NA extraction is performed directly on the LMA plates, while the eluted NA is totally free of inhibitory substances. Coupled with QPCR the whole procedure can be completed in less than three (3) hours.",
