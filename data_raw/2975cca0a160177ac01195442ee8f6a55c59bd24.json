Using routine hospital data, we aimed to examine the spatial distribution, temporal trends and climatic risk factors of paediatric ARIs in Vietnam. Methods Data from hospitalised paediatric (<16 years) patients with ARIs residing in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) between 2005 and 2010 were retrieved from the two main Children's Hospitals and the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in HCMC. Spatial mapping and time series analysis were performed after disaggregating data into upper respiratory tract infections (URIs) and lower respiratory tract infections (LRIs). results Over the study period, there were 155 999 paediatric patients admitted with ARIs (33% of all hospital admissions). There were 68 120 URIs (14%) and 87 879 LRIs (19%). The most common diagnoses were acute pharyngitis (28% of all ARI), pneumonia (21%), bronchitis (18%) and bronchiolitis (16%). A significant increasing trend over time was found for both URIs (mean weekly incidence per 1000 population, I=3.12), incidence rate ratio for 1-week increase in time (RR 1.0, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.17) for URI and (I=4.02, RR 1.08 (95% CI 1.006 to 1.16)) for LRI. The weekly URI incidence peaked in May-June and was significantly associated with lags in weekly URI incidence and the average humidity, rainfall and water level. The weekly LRI incidence exhibited significant seasonality (P<0.0001), with an annual peak in September-October and was significantly associated with lags in weekly LRI incidence and lags in weekly average temperature, rainfall and water level. Conclusions ARIs are a leading cause of childhood hospitalisation in HCMC, Vietnam. The incidence of ARIs was higher in the wet season and in specific HCMC districts. These results may guide health authorities in where and when to effectively allocate resources for the prevention and control of ARIs.",

This may be particularly true for URIs, as many patients with URIs do not require hospitalisation. \u25ba There was limited data on the specific pathogens associated with ARIs in the databases.

LRIs are composed of bacterial or viral infections occurring below the larynx and encompass bronchitis, bronchiolitis and pneumonia. 1 ARIs are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in young children, [2] [3] [4] accounting for >18% of all childhood deaths globally. 5 In 2010, there were approximately 120 million episodes and 1.3 million deaths associated with pneumonia worldwide, the vast majority of these occurred in Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. 5 6 In low-income and middle-income countries, ARIs in children aged <5 years are generally more severe than in older children and adults, resulting in a higher case-fatality than in high-income countries respectively. 1 7 This disparity in mortality rate is multifactorial and associated with differing aetiological agents, available therapies, exposure frequencies and host immunity. In Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), Vietnam, ARIs are among the most common cause of childhood hospitalisations. [8] [9] [10] The common identified pathogens of hospitalised ARI in HCMC include respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus, coronavirus, influenza and bocavirus, [8] [9] [10] in addition to the bacterial pathogens Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type b. 11 12 With limited access to costly vaccines for bacterial aetiologies and a lack of vaccines for viral causes of ARIs, a greater understanding of the risk factors and subpopulations at risk of ARIs in HCMC is necessary to effectively focus existing prevention measures such as the encouragement of breast feeding, hand washing with soap and a reduction in household air pollution. 2 There are data to suggest that the incidence of ARIs is associated with specific spatial, meteorological and sociodemographic risk factors. [13] [14] [15] [16] However, specific temporal and climatic risk factors for both URIs and LRIs in HCMC have not been investigated. Here, we aimed to examine the spatial distribution, temporal patterns and climatic risk factors for hospitalised paediatric ARIs in HCMC. This analysis was performed to generate a better understanding of the factors that may influence ARIs and in order to guide healthcare resources for this common paediatric disease syndrome.",

Patient addresses in HCMC were geocoded to districts and wards. City level weekly average climate data during 2005-2010 were obtained from the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment of Vietnam including relative humidity (median=76.5%, range=61.7%-88%), temperature (median=28.1\u00b0C, range=24.4\u00b0C-31.8\u00b0C), rainfall (median=24.4 mm, range=0 mm-230.7 mm) and water level of the Dong Dien River (median=4.93 cm, range=\u221234.43 cm to 49.43 cm). 18 Open Access spatial mapping The variance of raw ward ARI incidence rates (number of ARI cases per 1000 ward total population for the whole study period) may largely vary due to the large variation in ward population size in HCMC. To take into account the spatial heterogeneity of variance and any dependence of ARI incidence rates between wards, ward ARI incidence rates were smoothed using local empirical Bayes estimates for rates reduced to a neighbourhood mean. 19 The neighbourhoods were selected using the neighbourhood list based on wards with contiguous boundaries (R package spdep V.0.5-88). 20 Kulldorff and Nagarwalla's method over the centroids was be used to scan for clusters of ARIs. 21 This method allows the detection of possible cluster of any size, at any location in a population with inhomogeneous spatial density of HCMC. A Poisson generalised linear model was used to explore the relationship between district ARI incidence and district characteristics. CIs and tests were based on robust SEs to control for mild violation of the distributional assumption that the variance equals the mean. 22 time series analysis City-wide ARI weekly incidences (number of cases per 1000 population) were examined for seasonality, time trends and associations with climatic covariates by Poisson generalised additive mixed models (GAMMs) implemented in the R package mgcv V.1.8-7. 23 24 The seasonal cycles and time trends of weekly ARI incidence were evaluated by the basic GAMM models containing the week of year (Ws=1-52) as cyclic cubic regression splines and the week of the whole study period (Wt=1-312) as cubic regression spline. As weekly ARI incidence may be associated with the ARI incidence and climatic condition of the previous weeks, in addition to the elements in the basic model, the full GAMM model contained lags of ARI weekly incidence up to 8 weeks, concurrent climatic condition and lags of climatic condition up to 8 weeks. The performance of the GAMM models was evaluated using adjusted R 2 and model diagnostic plots. Temporal correlation of the model residuals was evaluated by autocorrelation function and partial autocorrelation function.",

Pollution was shown to be associated with an increase in LRI incidence in study conducted by the Collaborative Working Group on Air Pollution, Poverty and Health in HCMC. 26 The number of beds in these tertiary hospitals did not increase over the study period, and the policy of these hospitals is to accommodate all patients visiting the hospitals regardless of the capacity of the hospital and staff. An increase in ARI admission indicates an increase in burden for these tertiary hospitals and an increased workload for healthcare, which may impact negatively on the quality of care.

Furthermore, we additionally noted a difference in seasonal patterns of URIs (two small peaks a year) and LRIs (one strong peak a year) and a difference in association patterns with climatic factors of URIs and LRIs. These findings suggested that climatic factors might differentially influence the pathogens causing URIs and LRIs in HCMC. The association of URI incidence with 1-week and 3-week lags of weekly average humidity was consistent with the association between the seasonality of absolute humidity and ILI in Vietnam as previously reported. 27 In addition, the national surveillance of influenza and ILI in Vietnam Open Access during the study period exhibited a similar seasonal pattern with two peaks a year at approximately the same months with the two peaks of URIs in our data. 28 The exceptional high peak of URIs without a concurrent peak of LRIs in 2009 also occurred simultaneously with 2009 H1N1. Therefore, influenza and ILI were likely key contributors to the seasonality and the peaks of URIs in our data. Moreover, a study conducted at CH2 investigating viral ARI pathogens found that the peak of RSV infections occurred in rainy season (May-November in HCMC). This period included the peak of LRI months and the larger URI peak. 10 Furthermore, RSV is also thought to predispose infected hosts to bacterial infections. 29 In addition, a sharp increase of LRI incidence was observed soon after the peak of URIs (May-June) suggests that URIs and LRIs share some common epidemiological features. As a consequence, appropriate treatment and transmission control for URIs may impact on the incidence of later hospitalisation due to LRIs. As the peaks of hospitalisation for LRIs are in September-October, resources for paediatric healthcare should be prepared and local healthcare facilities should be enhanced to share the increase in hospitalisation caused by LRIs at tertiary hospitals during this period.",

These conditions can usually be treated in outpatient settings and do not typically require hospitalisation. However, the decision to hospitalise patients with ARI in these tertiary hospitals is not strictly based on WHO Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) guidelines and is also dependent on the preferences of caregivers and the subjective patient evaluation of the attending physicians. Therefore, there should stricter policies for applying IMCI guidelines and other clinical criteria to reduce unnecessary URI admissions in these hospitals, as well as to improving outpatient care and follow-up.",

Therefore, are finding may be generalisable for outpatients, especially for URIs, as many patients with URI may not be admitted to hospital. The findings for LRIs may be more generalisable as LRIs are more severe than URIs and more likely to be hospitalised. Second, the databases contained mostly general ICD-10 codes and very limited specific diagnostic information regarding the ARI pathogens. Different pathogens can cause differing URI and LRI disease presentations and different pathogens may be influenced differently by climatic, environmental, population factors as well as host immunity. Therefore, further surveillance and studies investigating different groups of pathogens for ARIs are necessary. ",

The spatial distribution of hospitalised ARIs was similar to the spatial referral patterns of the study hospitals with high incidences in the districts surrounding the locations of the three study hospitals and also in three districts further out the city. The seasonality of ARIs may be explained by the association of ARI incidence with various climatic factors (temperature, humidity and rainfall) and the seasonality of influenza, ILI and RSV. The increase of LRI incidence soon after the peak of URIs suggests that URIs and LRIs share common epidemiological factors or LRIs are complications of URIs. Understanding the spatial distribution, temporal patterns and climatic risk factors of ARIs should aid the health authorities in outbreak preparation and assist in allocating resources for the prevention and control of the diseases, especially in settings where vaccines for viral and bacterial pathogens of ARIs are not routinely available.
