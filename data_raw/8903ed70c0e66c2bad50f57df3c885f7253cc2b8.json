Several cyclophilins play a pivotal role in the life cycle of a number of viruses. The existing cyclophilin inhibitors, all derived from cyclosporine A or sanglifehrin A, have disadvantages, including their size, potential for side effects unrelated to cyclophilin inhibition and drug-drug interactions, unclear antiviral spectrum and manufacturing issues. Here we use a fragment-based drug discovery approach using nucleic magnetic resonance, X-ray crystallography and structure-based compound optimization to generate a new family of non-peptidic, small-molecule cyclophilin inhibitors with potent in vitro PPIase inhibitory activity and antiviral activity against hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus and coronaviruses. This family of compounds has the potential for broad-spectrum, high-barrier-to-resistance treatment of viral infections.",

            "text": "O ver the past decades, an increasing number of viruses causing unexpected illnesses and epidemics among humans, wildlife and livestock has emerged. These outbreaks have seriously stretched local and national resources in the economically developed world, whereas the capacity to control emerging diseases remains limited in poorer regions where many of them have their origin. A number of virus-specific antiviral agents have been developed and commercialized since the early 1980s. These agents, including drugs that specifically inhibit members of the Herpesviridae family, influenza viruses, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and, more recently, hepatitis C virus (HCV), had a major medical impact 1 . However, the development costs of specific antiviral agents are extremely high and there are many other medically important viral infections that require efficacious therapies. Thus, there is an urgent need for new families of broad-spectrum antiviral agents, that is, antiviral agents that are active against a number of different viral families 2 . Such compounds should target mechanisms common to different families of viruses, such as cellular components and/or functions involved in their life cycles. The cellular proteins cyclophilins have been shown to play a key role in the life cycle of a number of different viral families. In addition, cyclophilin inhibitors were reported to inhibit the replication of different viruses, both in vitro and in vivo 3, 4 . Thus, cyclophilins represent an attractive target for broad-spectrum antiviral inhibition.",

Seventeen human cyclophilins have been identified thus far. Among them, cyclophilin A (CypA) is present in the cytosol and involved in protein folding, trafficking, immunomodulation and cell signalling 5 . The extracellular fraction of CypB is involved in cell-cell communications and inflammatory signalling. CypD is localized in the matrix of the mitochondria and acts as a key regulator of the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), which plays a major role in calcium efflux from mitochondria to the cytosol and can lead to mitochondrial swelling and cell death [6] [7] [8] [9] . The function of most of the remaining cyclophilins is unknown 10, 11 .",

In addition to inhibiting cyclophilin PPIase activity, CsA was, for instance, shown to inhibit the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and affect transforming growth factor-b1 levels, whereas CsA and its nonimmunosuppressive derivatives were reported to inhibit ABC transporters (for example, PgP, MRP and BCRP) and stimulate antigen presentation by enhancing major histocompatibility complex-I surface expression [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] .

Ten fragment hits with low-affinity dissociation constants (millimolar range) were identified (Supplementary Fig. 1 ). Their scaffolds and proline-mimicking motifs were used to select in cerebro a set of 52 derivative fragments for subsequent X-ray crystallographic experiments. Apo CypD crystals were soaked with each of the 52 fragments. X-ray structures of CypD complexed with 14 fragments were obtained.

Structure-guided optimization was used to improve cyclophilin affinity and stability of the compounds. As ester functions are often associated with low biological stability, the first step was to replace the ester function of compound 22, which makes a key hydrogen bond with Arg55, without affecting the cyclophilin inhibitory potency.

In addition, the methoxy of the phenyl-pyrrolidine moiety displaced the side chain of Arg55, making a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl moiety of the urea motif ( Fig. 3e and https://figshare. com/articles/Stereo_views_of_cocrystal_structures_of_cyclophilin_ inhibitors_with_cyclophilin_D/3490493). Compound 24 proved to be a potent inhibitor of CypA, CypB and CypD PPIase activities, with IC 50s of 2.8 \u00b1 0.6, 1.2 \u00b1 0.1 and 11.4 \u00b1 3.0 mM, respectively. A series of phenyl-pyrrolidine derivatives were then synthesized, including compounds 25-31 (Table 1) Table 1 shows the inhibitory effects of these compounds on CypA, CypB and CypD PPIase activities in enzyme assays.",

Notably, the side-chain guanidine group of the essential Arg55 is hydrogen bonded to the prolyl nitrogen of the substrate. It promotes isomerization by weakening the double-bond properties of the peptide bond 32 . Targeting this residue is thus crucial to achieve potent inhibition of PPIase activity. CsA, its non-immunosuppressive cyclic analogues and SfA are large macrocycle compounds (molecular weight 41,000 g mol \u00c0 1 ). They bind the cyclophilin catalytic site and potently inhibit PPIase activity 33 . However, the shortcomings of these families of compounds in clinical practice emphasize the need for the development of small-molecule cyclophilin inhibitors. As the cyclophilin catalytic site is not a buried pocket, the design of small ligands with a molecular weight o500 g mol \u00c0 1 is nevertheless challenging 33 . A deeper pocket, the 'gatekeeper pocket', has been identified in close vicinity to the PPIase catalytic site 10 . This pocket could contribute to substrate binding specificity through gatekeeper residues located at its surface that restrict substrate accessibility. Thus, the gatekeeper pocket appears as an interesting target close to the catalytic site, suitable for a fragment-based approach targeting both sites combined with a linking strategy.",

Furthermore, conformational strain and flexibility mean that an energy price often needs to be paid to achieve optimal linking of the fragments 34 . In spite of these challenges, and because we were targeting two different subpockets, we decided to use this approach to link two fragments binding the catalytic and gatekeeper pockets, respectively, to substantially improve the stability and binding affinity of the resulting molecule. By means of structure-based drug design, we selected a linker consisting of a urea moiety that mimicked key interactions of both CsA and SfA with cyclophilins without altering the binding mode of the two fragments alone. Our results thus show that linking fragments that bind adjacent sites is a powerful approach for complex targets when an optimal linker can be found.",

Based on a previous work from our group 35 , Chinese authors reported a series of thiourea-based inhibitors targeting both the HIV-1 capsid and human CypA, which inhibited assembly and uncoating of the viral capsid 36 . However, the low CypA-binding affinity of the compounds strongly contradicted the claimed PPIase inhibitory activity and the reported effect on HIV could be exclusively related to the capsid ligand properties of the compounds in this work.",

We synthesized their two 'best' compounds and purchased one of them (TMN-355) from Tocris Bioscience, to test their ability to inhibit PPIase activity, and HCV and coronavirus replication in vitro. As shown in Supplementary Table 3 , none of these compounds exhibited any biological activity in the models. Furthermore, we could not obtain any crystallographic structure of the compounds complexed with cyclophilins. In another article in which a closely related compound was tested against enterovirus 71 (ref. 4), in vitro resistance selection experiments identified one amino acid substitution selected after several passages with increasing concentrations of the compound. The substitution conferred a modest fivefold reduction in EV71 susceptibility, but no resistance to CsA, further challenging the hypothesis of a common mechanism of inhibition for the two molecules. Altogether, these results cast doubt as to the reality of the anticyclophilin properties of this class of molecules. Other families of compounds have been reported to inhibit cyclophilin activity in vitro, but they need to be externally validated and their potential as broad-spectrum antiviral compounds has not been evaluated [38] [39] [40] . These results emphasize the difficulty of developing efficacious small-molecule cyclophilin inhibitors unrelated to CsA or SfA and underline the originality and importance of our work.",

Indeed, several cyclophilins, principally but not only CypA, have been convincingly shown to play a pivotal role in the life cycle of a number of viral families 3 . Our results showing inhibition of HCV, HIV and HCoV-229E coronavirus by compound 31 and related compounds, together with preliminary data suggesting hepatitis B virus replication inhibition, support the future development of our new family of cyclophilin inhibitors as broad-spectrum antiviral compounds with a high barrier to resistance. The high barrier to resistance, demonstrated with CsA derivatives in HCV infection 16 , results of the fact that cyclophilin inhibitors do not directly target a viral function but instead target a host protein involved at a key step of the viral life cycle. Thus, the likelihood to select viruses that are resistant to the action of the drug is low and, if such viruses were selected, they would be unlikely to yield high levels of resistance, as already shown 27 . This was confirmed here by the demonstration that amino acid substitutions in the HCV NS5A protein known to modestly reduce CsA-and CsA-derived inhibitor susceptibility of HCV also very modestly affected HCV susceptibility to the new compounds.",
