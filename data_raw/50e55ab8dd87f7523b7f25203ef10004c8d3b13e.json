Anti-rpH1N1-09-HA-IgG titres were significantly higher in critically ill patients and both categories circulated exclusively IgG1 isotype. Critically ill patients exhibited increase in TLR-3, 4, 7 and decrease in TLR-2 expressions. The disease severity correlated with increased plasma levels of IL1RA, IL2, IL6, CCL3, CCL4 and IL10. Majority of the immune-function genes were down-regulated in the PBMCs and up-regulated in the cells from lung aspirates of critically ill patients.

Throat swabs were collected and sent to the National Institute of Virology for diagnosis. Osletamivir treatment was initiated immediately after the confirmation of diagnosis.

Significantly higher titres of IgG-anti-p-H1N1-09 antibodies in the critically ill patients supports the role in pathogenesis. This observation is in sharp contrast with that for the SARS patients examined from Canada [13] documenting significantly lower anti-SARS CoV spike antibody titres in the critically ill patients. Though the presence of neutralizing antibodies protect against Influenza virus infection, clearance of the infection is mediated by cellular immunity. The exclusive presence of IgG1 antibodies in both patient categories document Th2 bias with significant enhancement with severity.

IL10 is recognized as a regulatory (anti-inflammatory) cytokine and can act on multiple cell types to regulate immune and inflammatory responses [15] . IL6 is known to be responsible for regulating plasma levels of IL1RA and IL10 [16] . Among Spanish patients, serum IL15, IL12p70 and IL6 were recognized as the hallmark of severity [10] .

This profile is indicative of massive infiltration of monocyterecruited neutrophils, DCs/macrophages to the target organ for mounting immune response/tissue repair and/or viral proteininduced shut down of the cellular genes, as these cells are known to efficiently replicate the virus [19, 20] . Additional studies are required to examine if the virus specifically down regulates host antiviral genes or dictates generalized shut down of host mRNA synthesis [19, 21] , especially in relation to the disease severity. Paradoxically, constant inflammatory signals provided by the significant increase in several chemokines (CCL2, CCL3, CCL19, CXCL8, CXCL10, CXCL11) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL6, IL17, IL1A, IL1B, TNF) in the lung cells may have resulted in massive infiltration of leucocytes and excessive tissue damage. This is to our knowledge the first report on p-H1N1-09-induced gene expression in human lung cells.",

Indepth studies to understand the role of virus/viral proteins in modulating host response need to be undertaken on priority.
