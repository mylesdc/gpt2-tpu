Our results showed that rs1800629, a SNP in the promoter region of TNF, was significantly associated with risk for severe sepsis. The minor allele frequency of rs1800629 was significantly higher in severe sepsis patients than that in both healthy controls (P adj = 0.00046, odds ratio (OR) adj = 1.92) and sepsis patients (P adj = 0.002, OR adj = 1.56). Further, we investigated the correlation between rs1800629 genotypes and TNF-a concentrations in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of healthy volunteers exposed to lipopolysaccharides (LPS) ex vivo, and the association between rs1800629 and TNF-a serum levels in severe sepsis patients. After exposure to LPS, the TNF-a concentration in culture supernatants of PBMCs was significantly higher in the subjects with AA+AG genotypes than that with GG genotype (P = 0.007). Moreover, in patients with severe sepsis, individuals with AA+AG genotypes had significantly higher TNF-a serum concentrations than those with GG genotype (P adj = 0.02). However, there were no significant associations between SNPs in the four candidate genes and 30 day mortality for patients with severe sepsis.",

Despite progress in the development of antibiotics and other supportive care therapies, severe sepsis remains an unconquered challenge for the clinicians with an unacceptable high mortality rate of 30%-50% [1] . The response to infection is diverse among different individuals. Given the same therapies, most sepsis patients will recover and do well, while a small, but significant portion, will develop severe sepsis and multiple organ system failure, refractory hypotension and death [2, 3] . Currently, more and more evidence showed that genetic factors played an important role in the development and severity of sepsis [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] . Common sequence variants within genes involved in pro-inflammatory response have received particular attention [12, 13] .",

            "text": "Although the pathogenesis of sepsis remains incompletely understood, an excessive pro-inflammatory response has been established as a fundamental component of severe sepsis [14] . The proinflammatory cytokine TNF-a is an essential component in the host immune response to infection and has been widely reported to be an important mediator in severe sepsis and septic shock. High circulating levels of TNF-a were correlated with poor outcomes in sepsis patients [15] . TNF-a and lymphotoxin-a (LT-a) share the same receptors as well as many biological activities, and they are central mediators of immune responses [16] . TNF-a and LT-a are encoded by adjacent gene loci in the central or class III region of the human major histocompatibility complex (MHC), between the HLA class I and II genes on the short arm of chromosome 6 [17] . Several SNPs within the promoter region of TNF (2238, 2308, 2857, 2863, 21031) and the first intron of LTA (+252) were thought to influence TNF-a and LT-a production, and have therefore been identified as candidate variants that might influence susceptibility to and/or outcomes from severe sepsis and infectious diseases [18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25] . In particular, rs1800629 (TNF 2308) and rs909253 (LTA +252) have been the focus of many investigations on sepsis. Although several studies have identified associations for rs1800629 and rs909253 with sepsis risk or outcomes [18, 19, 20, 23, 24] , other studies have not replicated the associations [21, 26, 27, 28] . This inconsistency may be due to small samples size studied and ethnic differences [29] .",

TNFR1deficient mice are resistant to endotoxic shock and have prolonged survival with less hypothermia [31] . TNFR2 influences the biological activity of TNF-a and LT-a both in a membranebound and a soluble form. Membrane-bound TNFR2 facilitates activation of nuclear factor (NF)-kB and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling cascades upon binding with TNF-a and LT-a, whereas soluble TNFR2 is capable of binding and inactivating circulating TNF-a and LT-a [16, 30] . Moreover, animal studies showed that TNFR2 mediated protective effects in the development of severe sepsis [31] . Recent studies proposed that genetic variation in TNFRSF1A and TNFRSF1B was associated with susceptibility to inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, such as tuberculosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease [32, 33, 34, 35] . However, to date, only one study investigated the role of TNFRSF1A and TNFRSF1B polymorphisms in sepsis susceptibility and mortality [36] .",

Our results provided evidence that rs1800629, a functional SNP in the promoter region of TNF, was significantly associated with susceptibility to severe sepsis in Chinese Han population. The association between rs1800629 and severe sepsis risk may be explained by its influence on the expression of TNF-a. In this study, we found that the risk allele (rs1800629A) is associated with increased TNF-a production in PBMCs from healthy subjects after stimulation with LPS. Moreover, we found that TNF-a serum levels in severe sepsis patients with AA+AG genotypes for rs1800629 were significantly higher than those in the individuals with GG genotype. Previous studies also showed that rs1800629A allele was associated with a six fold higher expression of both basal and induced TNF mRNA [39, 40] . Menges et al. found that the plasma TNF-a concentrations in patients with sepsis secondary to severe traumatic injury were significantly elevated in rs1800629A carriers on the first day after admission and for the following 14 days [41] . As TNF-a plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of severe sepsis in response to infection, it is reasonable to assume that patients with rs1800629A allele might produce a higher amount of TNF-a, and therefore become more susceptible to severe sepsis. In contrast to the TNF 2308G/A polymorphism, the LTA +252A/G was not associated with the development of severe sepsis in our study. Our data showed that 2308G/A of TNF and +252A/G of LTA were in weak linkage disequilibrium (LD) (D9 = 0.118) in Chinese Han population. The LD pattern is quite dissimilar to Caucasian population, which might result from the racial difference [24] .",

First, although we knew that different pathogens had different impact on severity and outcomes of sepsis, we did not perform stratification analysis by different pathogens due to small number of cases with a definite microbiologic diagnosis. Second, we did not resequence these genes or select tag SNPs for genotyping. Instead, only ten potentially functional SNPs in TNF, LTA, TNFRSF1A and TNFRSF1B were included in our study, which was far from comprehensive. Indeed, these four genes are highly polymorphic. Therefore, it was possible that some important SNPs might be missed or the observed association might be due to other polymorphisms in LD with the studied ones. Additionally, assuming the prevalence of 0.01 for severe sepsis and using a significance level of 0.05, our study with 432 severe sepsis patients and 624 healthy controls had about 80% power to detect a 5% risk allele with an odds ratio of 1.63. Variant with an effect size smaller than this cannot convincingly be excluded based on these results. Therefore, our results cannot exclude variant associations with weaker effects between severe sepsis and the other three candidate genes (LTA, TNFRSF1A, TNFRSF1B). A more highly powered study involving thousands of subjects may yet exclude the role of these variants in severe sepsis susceptibility and outcomes.",

The cells were then incubated for 6 hours in presence or absence of 100 ng/ml Escherichia coli 0111:B4 LPS (Sigma, USA). After incubation, supernatants were harvested and stored at 280uC until use.",

The differences in allele and genotype distributions between severe sepsis and control groups were compared using x 2 -test or Fisher's exact test when appropriate. The test for association with genotypes used the global genotype test in the 362 contingency table. Allele frequencies of cases and controls were used to calculate the OR and the 95% CI. Multivariate logistic regression was used to adjust for potential confounding factors. When comparing severe sepsis group to sepsis group, we entered the genotypes or alleles in the multivariate models controlling for the confounding variables including age, gender, history of diseases, source of infection, APACHE II and SOFA scores. When comparing severe sepsis patients to healthy controls, age and gender were included in the multivariate models. The Bonferroni method was used to correct for multiple comparisons where applicable. The power analysis was performed using the Genetic Power Calculator web tool [45] . A two tailed Pvalue of ,0.05 was considered statistically significant, whereas a value of corrected P,(0.05/number of tests) was considered significant after Bonferroni correction. Continuous variables were described as either a mean 6 standard deviation, or as a median with interquartile range. TNF-a serum levels between individuals with different rs1800629 genotypes (AA+GA vs. GG) were compared by Student's t-test. To determine whether an association with rs1800629 genotypes might depend on other potential confounding factors for TNF-a serum levels, we investigated the association of rs1800629 genotypes by adding the polymorphisms to a linear regression model controlling for age, gender and APACHE II scores. The software used for statistical calculations was SPSS 15.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) unless specified.",
