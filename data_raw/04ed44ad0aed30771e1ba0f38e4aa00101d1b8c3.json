            "text": "As the predominant aetiological agent of the common cold, human rhinovirus (HRV) is the leading cause of human infectious disease. Early studies showed that a monovalent formalin-inactivated HRV vaccine can be protective, and virus-neutralizing antibodies (nAb) correlated with protection. However, co-circulation of many HRV types discouraged further vaccine efforts. Here, we test the hypothesis that increasing virus input titres in polyvalent inactivated HRV vaccine may result in broad nAb responses. We show that serum nAb against many rhinovirus types can be induced by polyvalent, inactivated HRVs plus alhydrogel (alum) adjuvant. Using formulations up to 25-valent in mice and 50-valent in rhesus macaques, HRV vaccine immunogenicity was related to sufficient quantity of input antigens, and valency was not a major factor for potency or breadth of the response. Thus, we have generated a vaccine capable of inducing nAb responses to numerous and diverse HRV types.",

HRV also causes pneumonia hospitalizations in children and adults, and exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 2 . HRV was found to be the second leading cause of community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization in US children, second only to respiratory syncytial virus, and the most common pathogen associated with pneumonia hospitalization in US adults 3, 4 . A vaccine for HRV could alleviate serious disease in asthma and COPD, reduce pneumonia hospitalizations and have widespread benefits for society on the whole. Decades ago, researchers identified inactivated HRV as a protective vaccine, defined virus-neutralizing antibodies (nAb) as a correlate of protection, and estimated duration of immunity [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Trials with monovalent HRV vaccine demonstrated that protection from homologous challenge and disease can be achieved with formalin-inactivated virus given intramuscularly (i.m.) or intranasally 8, 10, 11 . Humoral immunity to heterologous virus types was not observed, though cross-reactive CD8 T cells can promote clearance 12, 13 . Limited cross-neutralizing antibodies can be induced by hyper-immunization in animals 14, 15 . The possibility of a vaccine composed of 50, 100 or more distinct HRV antigens has been viewed as formidable or impossible 2, 16, 17 . There are two main challenges, generating a broad immune response and the feasibility of composing such a vaccine. The Ab repertoire is theoretically immense, and most vaccines in clinical use are thought to work via a polyclonal Ab response. Deep-sequencing of human Ab genes following vaccination against influenza virus found thousands of Ab lineages 18, 19 . Whole pathogen and polyvalent vaccines carrying natural immunogens take advantage of this capacity. Valency has increased for pneumococcal and human papillomavirus virus vaccines in recent years. Given the significance of HRV, we tested polyvalent HRV vaccines.",

In 1975, it was reported that two different 10-valent inactivated HRV preparations induced nAb titres to only 30-40% of the input virus types in recipient subjects 33 . However, the input titres of viruses before inactivation ranged from 10 1.5 to 10 5.5 TCID 50 per ml, and these were then diluted 10-fold to generate 10-valent 1.0 ml doses given i.m. as prime and boost with no adjuvant 33 . We hypothesized that low input antigen doses are responsible for poor nAb responses to 10-valent inactivated HRV. We reconstituted the 1975 10-valent vaccine, as closely as possible with available HRV types, over a 10 1 to 10 5 inactivated-TCID 50 per vaccine dose, and we compared it with a 10-valent vaccine of the same types with input titres ranging from410 5 to410 7 inactivated-TCID 50 per dose. The reconstituted 1975 vaccine resulted in no detectable nAb after prime vaccination and, following boost vaccination, nAb to the five types that had the highest input titres (Fig. 2) . The high titre vaccine resulted in nAb to 5 of 10 types after prime vaccination and all 10 types after the boost (Fig. 2) . Following the boost vaccinations, there appeared to be a 10 4 inactivated-TCID 50 per vaccine dose threshold for the induction of nAb in this model (Fig. 2b) . Above this titre, there was no correlation between input load and nAb induction.",

In our facility, the highest allowable i.m. vaccine volume in mice was 0.1 ml. We tested a 25-valent per 0.1 ml HRV vaccine in mice as a scalable prototype. The 25-valent inactivated HRV vaccine had a 7.4-fold lower average inactivated-TCID 50 per type per dose than the 10-valent composition (Supplementary Table 2) to accommodate the volume adjustment. The 10-valent inactivated HRV vaccine induced nAb to 100% of input types following the prime and the boost (Fig. 3a) . The nAb induced by 10-valent inactivated HRV were persisting at 203 days post-boost ( Supplementary Fig. 2) . We used two different sets of virus stocks for the prime and boost 25-valent vaccinations in these experiments (Supplementary Table 2 ). The reason is that in the interim between the prime and boost vaccinations, we obtained higher titre virus stocks of eleven of the input types (HRV-32, -49, -58, -55, -41, -33, -39, -50, -1B, -21 and -60). The higher titre stocks of these eleven were used in the boost vaccination. The 25-valent inactivated HRV prime vaccination induced nAb to 18 of 25 (72%) virus types, and the 25-valent boost resulted in nAb against 24 of the 25 types (96%; Fig. 3b ). The average nAb titre resulting from prime and boost was 2 7 for 10-valent and 2 6.8 for 25-valent. These data demonstrate broad neutralization of diverse HRV types with a straightforward vaccine approach. Table 3 ). The 25-valent vaccine induced nAb to 96% (RM A) and 100% (RM B) of input viruses following the prime vaccination (Fig. 4a) . The 50-valent vaccine induced nAb to 90% (RM C) and 82% (RM D) of input viruses following the prime vaccination (Fig. 4c) . The breadth of nAb following prime vaccination in RM was superior to what we observed in mice, which may have been due to animal species differences and/or higher inactivated-TCID 50 input titres in the RM vaccines. Following boost vaccination, there were serum nAb titres against 100% of the types in 25-valent HRV-vaccinated RMs (Fig. 4b) and 98% (49 out of 50) of the virus types in 50-valent HRV-vaccinated RMs (Fig. 4d) . The average nAb titre resulting from prime and boost in RMs was 2 9.3 for 25-valent and 2 8.6 for 50-valent. The nAb responses were type-specific, not cross-neutralizing, because there were minimal nAbs induced by the 25-valent vaccine against 10 non-vaccine types ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ). The nAb response to 50-valent inactivated HRV vaccine was broad and potent in RMs.",

Therefore, HRV stock titresZ10 7 TCID 50 per ml are required for a potential 83-valent HRV A formulation in a 0.5 ml dose containing alum adjuvant. In future studies, we hope to produce a comprehensive 83-valent HRV A vaccine. A limitation of our study is that we have not included HRV C antigens, which will be important for HRV vaccine development, especially for paediatric populations. Ongoing efforts are aimed at propagation of HRV C strains to high titre in cell lines and development of serology assays. Ultimately, our approach may lead to vaccines for rhinovirus-mediated diseases including asthma and COPD exacerbations and the common cold. Advancing valency may be applicable to vaccines for other antigenically variable pathogens.",

Sonication was performed by an operator in a closed room with ear protection, at 10% amplitude, 1 s on/1 s off intervals and 1 pulse per 1 ml of material. Sonication yielded higher titres than freeze-thaw. The suspension was clarified by centrifugation at 931g for 10 min.
