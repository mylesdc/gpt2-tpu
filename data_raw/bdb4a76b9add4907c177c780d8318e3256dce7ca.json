VSV-RV/CE2E1 entered cells in an RV envelope proteindependent manner, and thus the infection was neutralized completely by an RV-specific antibody. The infection was Ca 2+ -dependent and inhibited by endosomal acidification inhibitors, further confirming the dependency on RV envelope proteins for the VSV-RV/CE2E1 infection. Human non-immune cell lines were mostly susceptible to VSV-RV/CE2E1, while immune cell lines were much less susceptible than non-immune cell lines. However, susceptibility of immune cells to VSV-RV/CE2E1 was increased upon stimulation of these cells. Our data therefore suggest that immune cells are generally less susceptible to RV infection than non-immune cells, but the susceptibility of immune cells is enhanced upon stimulation.",

Despite the great importance of RV to public health, the molecular mechanisms underlying RV pathogenicity remain poorly understood. Only humans are the natural hosts for RV, but cell lines from monkeys, hamsters and rabbits such as Vero, BHK, and RK-13, respectively, are commonly used for isolation or propagation of RV, because RV replicates most efficiently in these cell lines 2-4 . Understanding the cell types targeted by RV and the molecular basis for determining viral tropism is an important step for understanding the pathophysiology of rubella and CRS. Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) has been recently identified as a receptor for RV 5 . However, MOG is expressed mainly in cells of central nervous system, and its expression is very low or undetectable in the cells from other organs or tissues. Since RV generally causes a systemic infection, the pathology of rubella and CRS cannot be simply explained by the distribution pattern of MOG. Previous studies have indicated that membrane phospholipids and glycolipids, rather than cellular surface proteins, support RV infection, suggesting a functional role for membrane lipids in RV infections 6, 7 .",

            "text": "Measuring the infectivity titer of a virus is fundamental in virus research. However, infectivity titers are not absolute values and are dependent on the host cells used to determine such titers. The host cells must be both susceptible and permissible for virus infection establishment. Therefore, even when the viral titer of a particular sample is measured in different cell lines, it may differ greatly. In this experiment, we have determined the 50% cell culture infectious dose (CCID 50 ) by using a limiting dilution method, in which multiple rounds of infection is allowed. However, the CCID 50 in this method is basically expected to show the first cell numbers infected with RV. Indeed, even when the second round of infection was blocked by NH 4 Cl, similar results were obtained (Supplementary Figure 1) . The infectivity titer of a stock of the recombinant RV rHS strain was determined using various human cell lines and a monkey kidney-derived cell line, Vero. Vero cells are most commonly used to determine the infectivity titer of RV. The infectivity titer of the rHS stock was 5.17 \u00d7 10 6 CCID 50 /cell when Vero cells were used. The titer was set to 100% to simplify comparison (Fig. 1A, B) . When NJG, JAR and JEG3 cells were used, the infectivity titers of the same stock of rHS were 56.1%, 56.7%, and 146%, respectively (Fig. 1A) . Therefore, the three trophoblast-derived cell lines were susceptible and permissible to RV infection similarly to Vero cells. In contrast, the titers were reduced to only ~4 and 18%, respectively, when HSQ89 and A549 cells were used (Fig. 1A) . The titers were very low (~0.01 to 0.1%), when the other ten non-immune cell lines (SH-SY5Y, SK-N-MC, 293T, HUEhT-1, Caco-2, HeLa, FLC-4, Huh7, FaDu, and Detroit562) were used (Fig. 1A) . Therefore, these cell lines are almost non-susceptible or non-permissible, or both, to RV infection. The titers of the viral stock were also determined using immune cell lines. The titer was ~12% when MT2 cells were used, whereas the titers were very low (~0.01 to 0.1%)",

To assess the susceptibilities of individual cell lines to infection with RV, pseudotype VSVs bearing RV envelope proteins were generated. The VSV pseudotype virus genomes lack the G gene, which is replaced with a reporter protein gene, the green fluorescent protein (GFP) or firefly luciferase (FLuc) gene 8, 14, 18, 19 . The pseudotype viruses were thus expected to show similar behaviors to RV during the process of virus entry, and the subsequent processes of gene expression are dependent on the VSV replication machinery. In the initial experiment, only RV envelope E2 and E1 proteins were provided in trans to generate the GFP gene-and FLuc gene-encoding pseudotype viruses, VSV GFP -RV/E2E1 and VSV FLuc -RV/E2E1, respectively, like other VSV pseudotype viruses 13, [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . The infectivity titers for VSV GFP -RV/E2E1 and VSV FLuc -RV/E2E1 were 10-fold higher than those of the counterpart control viruses, VSV GFP -\u2206G and VSV FLuc -\u2206G, respectively, which lack envelope glycoproteins, in Vero cells ( Fig. 2A, B) . Although this suggests that RV envelope proteins contribute to the infectivity of the pseudotype viruses, they seem to have little practical application because of their low infective titers. Co-expression of the Capsid (C) protein resulted in production of the pseudotype viruses, VSV GFP -RV/CE2E1 and VSV FLuc -RV/CE2E1 and these pseudotype viruses showed higher infectivity titers than VSV GFP -RV/E2E1 and VSV FLuc -RV/E2E1, respectively ( Fig. 2A, B) . The infectivity titers for VSV GFP -RV/CE2E1 and VSV FLuc -RV/CE2E1 were 50-200-fold higher than those of VSV GFP -\u2206G and VSV FLuc -\u2206G, respectively. An experiment indicated that the RV C protein promotes fusion activity in RV envelope (E1 and E2) proteins by supporting the maturation or stabilizing either E2 and E1 or their interactions during intracellular transport to the cell surface 31 . We have confirmed the enhance effect by the C protein on fusion by RV envelope proteins. The surface expression level of the E1 protein with the C protein was similar to that without the C protein (Fig. 2C ). The total amounts of the E1 protein in cells were also similar between cells co-expressed with or without the C protein (Fig. 2D) . Nevertheless, the level of cell-to-cell fusion was increased by ~two-fold by co-expressing the C protein (Fig. 2E ). Although the detailed mechanism was unclear, the data demonstrated that the RV envelope protein expressed on the cell surface showed a better fusion activity than that expressed without the C protein. Thus, in the following experiment, the C protein was provided together with RV envelope E2 and E1 proteins. However, it should be noted that co-expression of the C protein with the E1 and E2 proteins may produce empty non-infectious RV-like-particles (RVLP). Indeed, an electron microscopic assay revealed both bullet-shaped (~61 \u00b1 7 nm \u00d7 173 \u00b1 18 nm; n = 5) and spherical particles (~73 \u00b1 12 nm in diameter; n = 8), which were corresponding to VSV and RV virions, respectively 9, 32 . This suggests that pseudotype VSV and RVLP were contained in the VSV GFP -RV/CE2E1 stocks (Fig. 2F) . No particles showed a combined shape of the bullet and spherical forms. Although the VSV pseudotype virus genome was expected to be incorporated into the bullet shaped particles, it was confirmed by the following experiment. Stock solutions of VSV FLuc -G, VSV FLuc -RV/CE2E1 and RVLP were independently prepared and concentrated and fractionated by sucrose-gradient ultracentrifugation. In this experiment, RVLP, which contains a subgenomic replicon RNA in which the structural genes are replaced with DNA sequences encoding the puromycin N-acetyl-transferase protein, the foot-and-mouth disease virus 2 A self-cleavage domain, and the Renilla luciferase 33 , was used as a marker for RVLP fractionation pattern. VSV FLuc -G, VSV FLuc -RV/CE2E1, and RVLP in individual fractions were detected by infecting Vero cells with the fractions and measuring the relative light unit (RLU) from the cells. The peak infectivity of VSV FLuc -RV/CE2E1 was at ninth fraction similarly to that of VSV FLuc -G, with no peak or shoulder at seventh fraction where RVLP indicated the peak infectivity ( Fig. 2G-I) . The profiles demonstrated that the pseudotype VSV particles, but not RVLP, incorporated the genome.",

Infection of VSV FLuc -RV/ CE2E1, but not VSV FLuc -G, which has the VSV-G protein, was inhibited by anti-RV serum in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A, B) , confirming the functional contribution of RV proteins in VSV FLuc -RV/CE2E1 infections. RV enters cells through receptor-binding-mediated endocytosis and subsequent low pH-triggered viral-host membrane fusion [34] [35] [36] . To analyze the entry process of VSV FLuc -RV/CE2E1, the effects of endosomal acidification inhibitors on VSV FLuc -RV/CE2E1-infections were examined. Vero cells were pretreated with various concentrations of bafilomycin A1 and chloroquine, and infected with VSV FLuc -RV/CE2E1 and three control pseudotype VSVs bearing envelope proteins of VSV, murine leukemia virus (MLV), and measles virus (MV) (VSV FLuc -G, VSV FLuc -MLV/Env, and VSV FLuc -MV/FH, respectively). Similar to RV, entry of the authentic VSV occurs in endosomes under low pH conditions 37 , while MLV and MV enter cells in the plasma membrane under neutral pH [38] [39] [40] . As expected, the inhibitors blocked VSV FLuc -G infections in a dose-dependent manner, but did not block VSV FLuc -MLV/Env and VSV FLuc -MV/FH infections (Fig. 3C, D) . The effect of the inhibitors on VSV FLuc -RV/ CE2E1 was similar to that on VSV FLuc -G. Another feature of RV entry is its Ca 2+ dependency 35 . Hence, the Ca 2+ requirements of VSV GFP -RV/CE2E1 infection were assessed. The number of VSV GFP -RV/CE2E1-infected cells declined severely when the level of CaCl 2 in the culture media was lowered (Fig. 3E) . VSV GFP -MV/FH infectivity, which was used as a control, was reduced by only ~20% at a maximum. All these data suggest that VSV GFP -RV/ CE2E1 undergoes a similar entry process to the authentic RV.",

            "text": "Human non-immune cells are generally susceptible to VSV-RV/CE2E1, whereas immune cells are much less susceptible than non-immune cells. We analyzed VSV-RV/CE2E1, VSV-G, and VSV-\u2206G for their infectivity levels in various human cell lines and Vero cells. To compare the different pseudotype viruses, the infectivity titers were standardized by the genome copy numbers in the virus stocks. The genome copy numbers in VSV GFP -RV/CE2E1, VSV GFP -G, and VSV GFP -\u2206G stocks used in the experiments [8] [9] [10] [11] , respectively, were mixed and cultured together. The cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1-E2E1, pcDNA3.1-CE2E1 or the empty vector and incubated for 32 hours. (D) The cell lysates were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-RV E1 and anti-GAPDH antibodies. The signal intensity of the E1 protein in the cells were 5.02 \u00d7 10 10 , 1.15 \u00d7 10 11 , and 4.29 \u00d7 10 10 , respectively, per milliliter. Also the genome copy numbers in VSV FLuc -RV/CE2E1, VSV FLuc -G, and VSV FLuc -\u2206G stocks used in the experiments were 9.35 \u00d7 10 9 , 2.81 \u00d7 10 10 , and 1.21 \u00d7 10 10 , respectively, per milliliter. VSV-G infectivity titers were generally much higher than those of VSV-RV/ CE2E1 (Fig. 4) . Not surprisingly, these data suggest that RV envelope proteins were less efficiently incorporated and/or less functional in VSV-based pseudotype virions than the authentic VSV G glycoprotein. Nonetheless, the VSV GFP -RV/CE2E1 infectivity titers were significantly higher than VSV GFP -\u2206G in many cell lines (Fig. 4) . VSV GFP -G infectivity titers in 293T, Huh7, NJG, JAR, and JEG3 cells were similar to that in Vero cells (Fig. 4A ), as were the infectivity titers of VSV GFP -RV/CE2E1 in 293T and NJG cells in Vero cells (Fig. 4A ). In contrast, the infectivity titers of VSV GFP -RV/CE2E1 in Huh7, JAR, and JEG3 cells were ~10-times greater than they were in Vero cells (Fig. 4A ). Vero cells are commonly used for propagating RV and it is well accepted that this cell line is susceptible to RV. These data therefore suggest that these non-immune cell lines (293T, Huh7, NJG, JAR, and JEG3) are similarly or more highly susceptible to RV than Vero cells. VSV GFP -G infectivity titers were reduced by 10 to 1,000-fold in HeLa, FLC-4, FaDu, Detroit562, HSQ89, and A549 cells, when compared with the titer in Vero cells (Fig. 4A, B) . Therefore, these cell lines may be less susceptible or less permissible to VSV infection. Even when considering these observations, the infectivity titers of VSV GFP -RV/CE2E1 in these cells were significantly higher than those of VSV GFP -\u2206G (Fig. 4B) , suggesting that these cell lines are also susceptible to RV. Similar experiments were performed using VSV FLuc -RV/CE2E1, of which the infection was highly sensitively quantified by the luciferase activity. In these experiments a VSV G protein-specific antibody, which neutralized VSV FLuc -G infection efficiently, was used to eliminate the possible effect by the residual VSV FLuc -G used for the production of VSV FLuc -RV/CE2E1. Data with VSV FLuc -RV/CE2E1 and the VSV-G neutralizing antibody confirmed the negligible or small effect by the residual VSV FLuc -G and the high susceptibility of non-immune cells to VSV FLuc -RV/ CE2E1 (Fig. 4C ).",

Unstimulated control cells were also infected with VSV FLuc -RV/CE2E1 or VSV FLuc -G. The positive effect on VSV FLuc -RV/CE2E1 entry by PMA stimulation was evident in THP-1 cells.

The infectivity of VSV FLuc -G and VSV FLuc -RV/ CE2E1 were increased by ~10-fold and ~200-fold, respectively (Fig. 5) . Therefore, the increase in VSV FLuc -RV/ CE2E1 infection was possibly in part due to the positive effect by PMA for VSV replication.

Pseudotype viruses are useful tools for analyzing the susceptibility of specific viruses separately from their intracellular replication processes. A pseudotype virus with RV envelope proteins has been reported previously 31 . This is a lentiviral pseudotype virus based on the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). However, the SIV vector failed to incorporate the intact forms of RV envelope proteins 31 . Therefore, the SIV pseudotype virus bearing modified RV envelope proteins with the cytoplasmic tail of the VSV G protein was used in the study 31 . In the present study, a new was normalized by those of GAPDH. The full-length images are shown in Supplementary Fig. 2 . (E) The cells were incubated with low pH (pH 5.1) media for 15 min and then were cultured with the standard culture media for 8 h. The Renilla luciferase activity derived from fusion cells were measured and normalized by expression levels of the E1 protein determined in (D). (F) Electron microscope image of particles in the VSV-RV/CE2E1 stock solution. Purified virions in the VSV GFP -RV/CE2E1 stock solution were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, and then were negatively stained with 2% phosphotungstic acid solution. The arrows indicate spherical particles. Bar pseudotype virus bearing the intact forms of the RV envelope proteins was generated using a VSV pseudotype system. Although the E1 protein alone causes membrane fusion and supports virus entry, the E2 and C proteins play roles in RV entry. After E1 protein binding to a receptor, RV enters cells by endocytosis 44 . Exposure to the low pH environment in early endosomes induces conformational changes in the E1 and E2 proteins and membrane fusion 34, 36 concomitantly with a solubility change in the C protein 36 . The C protein also has a supportive role in membrane fusion 31 . The mechanism of fusion enhancement by the C protein is still unclear, but the C protein likely supports the maturation or stabilizes either E2 and E1 or their interactions during intracellular transport to the cell surface 31 . As expected, co-expression of the C protein promoted the production of infectious VSV pseudotype virus with RV envelope proteins (VSV-RV/CE2E1). Infection by the novel VSV-RV/CE2E1 pseudotype virus was indeed mediated by RV envelope proteins, and the virus underwent a similar entry process to that of the authentic RV as previously reported 35, 44 .",

Therefore, inefficient infection of immune cell lines with the authentic RV is explainable in part by the poor susceptibility of these cell lines to RV. However, previous studies have demonstrated that immune cells can become infected with RV 41-43, 45, 46 . RV replicates in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), of which macrophages are the main target by RV 42 . Consistent with these observations, RV is isolatable from the PBMCs of patients naturally infected with RV 46 . Unstimulated lymphocytes poorly support RV infection 42 , but are able to support RV infection upon stimulation by mitogen [41] [42] [43] . Additionally, a previous study showed that Raji and Cess human B-cell lines and the U937 monocyte line all supported RV infection 45 . Our data do not necessarily contest these previous observations, because a basal level of RV infection was observed in all the immune cell lines, although the efficiency was very low. In addition, our data further demonstrated that the infection of immune cell lines was increased to a certain level by stimulation of the cells. The key point about our data is that the entry efficiency of RV was generally high in non-immune cell lines but not in immune cell lines. These observations are important in terms of understanding more about the pathology of RV.",

            "text": "Even among non-immune cell lines RV infection efficiency differs dramatically, although our data using a pseudotype virus system shows that non-immune cells are generally susceptible to RV. These data suggest that the permissibility to RV infection differs considerably among non-immune cell lines. One possible factor modulating the RV infectivity is the host innate immune system. RV is highly sensitive to interferon (IFN) 3, 47, 48 , and the infectivity of individual cell lines with RV is affected by their capacity for IFN production and response to IFN. Vero cells are defective in IFN production 49, 50 , and JEG3 and JAR trophoblast cell lines, which support RV infection most efficiently, are refractory to IFN 51, 52 . Therefore, the activity of innate immunity in individual cells at least partially determines the cell or tissue tropism of RV infection. CRS is a major concern in RV infections. The high infectivity of RV in trophoblast cell lines is an interesting observation that could open a door towards understanding the establishment of RV infection in the fetus after it crosses the placenta. In the fetus, persistent infection of the endothelial cells of the fetal vessels with RV is probably a cause of CRS, because it may induce vascular abnormalities, resulting in dysfunctional or abnormal development of multiple fetal organs or tissue 53 . Perelygina et al. have shown that human fetal endothelial cells are persistently infected with RV 54, 55 . Further studies on the cell and tissue tropism of RV and the molecular mechanisms involved in such tropism are essential if we are to understand the pathophysiology of rubella and CRS. The new RV pseudotype system established in the present study will make a positive contribution to these additional studies. Plasmid constructs. The expression plasmid encoding the precursor protein for the structural proteins (C, E2 and E1) of the RV Hiroshima strain (pcDNA3.1-SP/C 1-300 ) has been described previously 33 . The expression plasmid encoding only E2 and E1 proteins of the RV Hiroshima strain (pcDNA3.1-E2E1) has been described previously 33 . The expression plasmids encoding the envelope proteins of VSV (pC-VSV-G), the Edmonston vaccine strain of MV (pCA7PS-Ed-H and pCXN-Ed-F), and MLV (pFBASALF) have also been described previously 13, 58-60 . pcDNA3.1-SP/C 1-300 is hereafter referred to as pcDNA3.1-CE2E1.",

The VSV GFP -G genome lacks the G gene, which is replaced with the GFP gene 13 . On the viral envelope the VSV GFP -G particles contain the G protein, which is provided in trans using the pC-VSV-G expression plasmid 13 ). The cells were washed four times with DMEM and incubated with DMEM containing 10% FBS. After 24 h, the culture supernatants containing VSV GFP -RV/ CE2E1 were harvested and centrifuged at 10,000 \u00d7 g for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C to remove the cell debris.

A fusion protein of Renilla luciferase and GFP was split into two fragments designated dual split proteins, DSP 1-7 and DSP 8-11 56 . Although each fragment lacks the activities as Renilla luciferase and GFP, they reassemble and become functional when they are expressed within an identical cell simultaneously. 293CD4/DSP 1-7 and 293FT/DSP [8] [9] [10] [11] cells constitutively expressing DSP 1-7 and DSP [8] [9] [10] [11] , respectively, were mixed and cultured together, and transfected with pcDNA3.1-CE2E1, pcDNA3.1-E2E1 or an empty pcDNA3.1 vector. At 32 h posttransfection, the cells were incubated with a low pH (pH5.1) culture media for 15 min to induce a cell-to-cell fusion by RV envelope proteins followed by the incubation with a standard culture media for 8 hours at 37 \u00b0C. Then the Renilla luciferase activity derived from the reassembled DSPs by a cell fusion were measured using the Renilla Luciferase Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI) and GloMax 20/20 Luminometer (Promega). The expression levels of Renilla luciferase were normalized by the total expression levels of E1 proteins detected by an immunoblotting as described above.",

Each 1 ml of the fractionated samples in the gradient was collected from the top to the bottom, and a small part of each fraction was diluted with an equal volume of DPBS. Next, the diluted samples were inoculated into the Vero cell culture media in the 96-well plates.
