There is a large body of existing literature, much of which is already in review form. In order to advance the usefulness of the literature for nurse and human resource managers, we undertook an overview (review of systematic reviews). The aim of the overview was to identify high quality evidence of the determinants and consequences of turnover in adult nursing. Methods: Reviews were identified which were published between 1990 and January 2015 in English using electronic databases (the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts, CINAHL plus and SCOPUS) and forward searching. All stages of the review were conducted in parallel by two reviewers. Reviews were quality appraised using the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews and their findings narratively synthesised.",

However, a body of moderate quality review evidence does exist giving a picture of multiple determinants of turnover in adult nursing, with -at the individual level -nurse stress and dissatisfaction being important factors and -at the organisational level -managerial style and supervisory support factors holding most weight. The consequences of turnover are only described in economic terms, but are considered significant.",

Low retention rates of health care professionals, including qualified nurses, are detrimental to the delivery of health care systems and population health [3] . In high income countries retention of nurses and other health care professionals is also viewed as an important health human resource strategyto reduce demand for and therefore migration of nurses from health care systems in low income countries [3] . Data from the North America have been used to suggest that many high income countries are experiencing or predicting growth in demand for qualified nurses over the next decade [4, 5] . In those high income countries facing shortage of supply of experienced qualified nurses such as England, reducing turnover and improving retention rates has become an important workforce development strategy [6] .",

It can also refer to nurses leaving the nursing profession but remaining on a nurses' register, or leaving a nurses' register, [10] or to a number of combinations of the above descriptors [1] . It is in this context of a lack of consistency in the definition and measurement of turnover that the rate of nurse turnover has been estimated at between four and 54% intending to leave internationally [11] . In a review of studies which used the same method of measuring turnover and its costs (the Nursing Turnover Cost Calculation Methodology [12] [13] [14] ), the rates reported in primary studies still varied from 15% in Australia, 20% in Canada, 27% in the USA to 44% in New Zealand [7] .",

Nurses working in general adult health services, in comparison to those working in paediatric or psychiatric services, are the largest group of nurses in all countries [4, 20, 21] . It should be noted that there is diversity between countries in whether the education for nurse registration or licensure is generic to all populations or specialist to particular groups such as children [22] .

Such antecedents are variously represented in a number of well-developed models of turnover, including those describing organisational contexts and psychological (behavioural) explanations of turnover where characteristics lead to intentions leading to turnover, [24] as well as those indicating the importance of the 'webs of relationships in which employees are situated' , for example the role of centrality in social networks as a moderator to the psychological processes ( [25] , p1177) or the impact of dispositional traits such as locus of control and proactive personality, particularly in explaining wide variance in the intentionsactual turnover relationship. Specific to nursing, turnover is recognised to be \"complex and multifaceted with factors affecting every sector of health care\" [26] and several conceptual models have been put forward, recognising the decades of work on nurse turnover [27] . These models variously recognise a plethora of reasons why nurses leave or state their intention to leave, [27] , although they have been broadly described in three categories: motivational characteristics, social characteristics and characteristics of the work context, although the latter has been less well explored in the research [25] . In these models, nurse turnover is also reported to have consequences, mainly reported as negative in terms of cost, compromise to patient safety and effect on remaining staff [2] . As these consequences take us full circle to antecedents, we have included these in this paper.",

Using Medline alone at this stage we identified a large body of reviews relevant to the study's objectives that indicated that nurse and human resource managers would be faced by a plethora of reviews [29, 30] , many of which were not conducted according to reviews guidance [26] . Against this background, we conducted an overview which is a systematic review of systematic reviews [31] . This paper reports on this overview, which aimed to identify high quality evidence of the determinants and consequences of turnover in nurses working in the field of adult health care services and bring that evidence together into one place to highlight where strong enough evidence to support managerial decisions exists and where gaps in the evidence may indicate the need for further research, particularly when considered in the context of the broader management literature regarding turnover.",

Of these, six had been published since 2010. Eight reviews had been published in four academic journals about nursing (Journal of Nursing Management, [41] [42] [43] 46] Journal of Advanced Nursing, [44] International Journal of Nursing Studies [48] and Nursing Ethics [45] ), and one in the International Journal of Evidence-Based Healthcare. None was a Cochrane review. Table 2 shows each review's criteria used to include or exclude primary studies, and the limits used to focus the reviews' scope. The majority of the reviews limited their searches to the English language, with the exception of Flinkman et al. (2010) [11] , who did not use this restriction, and Coomber and Barriball (2007) [48] who did not report this limit. The majority of the reviews did not restrict their searches by geographical region. The included reviews contained a range of seven to 31 primary studies. Of the 159 primary studies in the nine systematic reviews, 21 were included in at least two reviews, and only two primary studies [49, 50] were included in three reviews (Table 3 ). In the included systematic reviews, observational study designs were the most frequently reported in the included primary studies; a small number of qualitative studies were also included.",

            "text": "The first subset of factors involved sociodemographic characteristics, some were 'given' characteristics such as age and gender, whereas others were acquired -education and family status. Age featured in two reviews, with contrasting findings reported. One review [41] reported an inverse relation of age and experience with intention to leave, based on splitting nurses' age groups at 45 years or simply referring to them as 'older' in six quantitative primary studies, with the older group less likely to leave and nurses who had worked less than 5 years being less likely to stay. This contrasted with a positive finding of intention to leave (retire) in nurses aged over 50 from another review, [11] albeit reporting on just one primary study using a survey design, and complicated by two other studies reported by one review [41] that suggested a negative association between being a nurse aged less than 25 years and newly qualified and intention to leave and another finding a greater intention to leave in nurses older than 35 years and with longer hospital tenure (greater than 10 years) than in nurses aged under 25 years with less than a year tenure). The review authors suggested these contrasting findings to be due to the confounding of age with variables such as tenure and year post-qualification [41] . With regards to gender and marital status, one review [41] reported that male nurses and unmarried nurses had a greater intention to leave, based on three primary studies (of cross-sectional designs and excluding north American literature) for each factor. More educated nurses were reported as more likely to leave across three reviews [41, 47, 48] , using different outcome measures and based on six primary studies. Chan et al.'s review (2013) [41] reported four primary studies where education was negatively associated with retention, although little detail was given on level of education; likewise there is evidence from a descriptive study of a statistically significant association between holders of master's degrees and intention to leave their current job in specialist oncology/haematology reported by one other review's authors [47] . Additionally, Coomber and Barriball (2007) [48] described a small but stable relationship for intention to leave with educational attainment from a meta-analysis, although when analysed with job satisfaction as an antecedent or confounding factor they report no consensus despite similar methods used in the primary studies they report and they urge caution in drawing conclusions regarding the determinant of education.",

Among psychological experiences, stress and burnout are considered as negative experiences which are more likely than not to influence a decision to leave. The negative influence of stress received consistent support in three reviews [45, 48] . Two reviews reported positive associations of work-related stress (for example lack of stability in the work schedule or stress related to high workload or to the role, together with dissatisfaction of career prospects) with intention to leave [48] . These findings were based on scale-based surveys from Canada, Singapore, the UK and the USA, written comments from Australia and a meta-analysis from Taiwan, although one review [48] noted contrasting rankings of the antecedents of that stress and suggested that measurement of stress is difficult. The other review reported increased turnover [45] to be positively associated with moral stress originating in the hospital ethical climate, this definitive finding being based on one interview study, although the review authors note inferred relationships in several other studies but a lack of methodological rigour in the included studies [45] . Similarly, burnout also featured among individual factors [11] , in one study reported by Toh et al. (2012) [47] and, alongside emotional exhaustion in a review by Chan et al.

Working patterns, such as shift work (evenings and night shifts mentioned specifically) [41] were linked to intention to leave, and increasing stability from a constantly changing rota as a way to reduce stress [48] was reported as negatively associated with intention to leave. Promotional opportunities featured an influential factor too. Intention to leave increased where nurses experienced fewer possibilities for development or professional growth, evidenced by two studies in one review [11] and four studies (one overlapping) of another review, including the findings of a large study carried out in 10 European countries [41] . Chan et al. (2013) [41] also cited three quantitative studies confirming the impact of lack of autonomy on intention to leave. Role conflict has also been suggested to be a determining factor in decreasing a nurse's intention to stay in one study in one review, [41] while another review [11] reported a study providing conflicting quantitative and qualitative findings from the same group of nurses; this review suggested that more experienced nurses (how they saw themselves professionally) indicated an intention to stay.",

Gender was highlighted by another review [48] with male participants reported in one study as being twice as likely in their intention to leave as females due to dissatisfaction with salary. The results of other three studies reviewed in one review [48] , produced from differing methods of assessment, suggested non-uniform relations between pay and retention. Although factor analysis showed pay as an important contributor to job satisfaction, pay was not a statistically significant indicator of intent to leave or turnover cognition. Written comments from two studies conducted in Australia and USA indicated that fairness and equality of pay was more important to nurses in retaining their positions. In other words, perceived low pay had a greater influence than pay level per se. Crucial factors were commensuration according to contributions, for example, for roles with high responsibility, and additional reward mechanisms including fringe benefits [48] .",

This review focused solely on cost as the consequence of turnover [43] . This review was based on ten studies, eight of which were in acute hospital settings, all conducted in the USA, with one also in each of Australasia and Canada. The review reported costs of per nurse turnover ranging from $10,098 to $88,000 and a total turnover cost ranging from $0.55 million to $8.5 million, the ratio of nurse turnover costs relative to nurses' salary ranging from 0.31 to 1.3. Orientating and training new hires was reported as the largest or second largest category of costs relative to total nurse turnover costs while several studies also noted the high costs of unfilled positions/vacancy costs (defined usually as the costs of temporary replacements, but also including wider costs, for example, patient deferral costs and productivity costs for supervisors and other staff, in some primary studies they review). The review authors note the difficulty interpreting and generalising from their included primary studies due to the variability in conceptualisation and measurement of turnover, in time-periods (spanning over two decades) and geographic locations. They also noted that all but one study, which was based on econometric methods, relied on descriptive statistical analyses and that the studies were mostly based in one setting and had relatively small sample sizes. That said the key message from the review was that nurse turnover is costly for organisations.",

The analysis here reveals that despite the publication of a large number of primary studies (n = 159 in the reviews of primary studies we reported fully in the narrative of reviews), there is a low degree of overlap in their presence in eight reviews which focus on the same topic and present similar categories of determinants. We might suggest that the low overlap could be attributed to differences in the detail of the research questions (for example, concentrating on job satisfaction [48] or commitment; [44] see Table 2 ) as the international reviews with more general research questions have a greater overlap [41] . Nevertheless, the impact of this is a rather disjointed body of evidence in which both the outcome of actual turnover as opposed to intention to leave is poorly addressed, and modelling of determinants in combination, taking account of confounding factors, is rare. While the large number of reviews on the topic of nurse turnover may give the impression that the topic is saturated, our overview suggests new knowledge -that there are large gaps in the literature on determinants of turnover in adult nursing. Review of the literature on the consequences of determinants is rare, although we note that some conflate these issues as consequences such as reduced staff numbers are also related to determinants such as workload pressures.",

This is problematic as, although intention has been demonstrated to be a consistent predictor of nurse retention, how these behavioural intentions develop and the link between intention to leave a job and actually leaving are unclear [46] . Furthermore, the inconsistency in the criteria and outcomes measures used in research studies and reviews not only demonstrates the complexity of the concept of turnover, it also shows how reviews of the turnover evidence have not systematically built on previous work in a consistent way to contribute to a shared theoretical base, despite discussion about definitions, conceptual models and a need for multivariable analyses [10] . Concepts therefore remain loosely defined and are used interchangeably. It might be that this accounts for the very limited evidence related to consequences at organisational level (cost), with no evidence on individual level consequences.",

More positively, several of the reviews highlight limitations of the body of literature, such as poor definition of intention to leave, dependence on cross sectional survey designs (with qualitative investigative depth mostly lacking [48] ) and variability in the health systems of different countries in particular (identified in two reviews [41] ), as well as noting the emphasis on single studies in several reviews [11] , and the heterogeneity of nurses, [11] often within studies [48] . Difficulties comparing across reviews due to other issues of definition, for example, of moral climate [45] or definition and measurement of manager leadership practices [46] or poor specificity of workplaces studied [47] are also raised.

            "text": "Our overview is limited by design. In being an overview of (systematic) reviews we have relied upon the review authors' reporting and interpretation of the primary studies and have made some assumptions about quality based on descriptions of research design rather than on a critical appraisal of each primary study. We suggest that this limitation is mitigated somewhat by only including reviews that have at least reported that they have carried out a quality appraisal of their included studies, and becomes a strength in that we have sought to review rather than add yet another review of primary studies to the large, somewhat repetitive, yet also heterogeneous decades of literature on turnover in adult nursing. We have also assessed the quality of the included reviews using a widely recognised tool for this task [37] . Our decision to include those reviews that reported a quality appraisal of their included studies also limits our review in excluding from our full narrative a number of comprehensive and recent reviews of the determinants and consequences of turnover in adult nursing that added considerably to our thematic index. In particular we have not featured the national/societal or patient level determinants and patient care outcomes that appear in the twelve reviews that did not contain a methodological appraisal of their included primary studies although they met our other inclusion criteria. We may also have excluded high quality primary studies that did not feature in reviews containing a quality appraisal. While this is acknowledged here as a limitation, we however consider this justified, and indeed a strength of our overview, in that we have based this decision on the guidance for the good conduct of systematic reviews available since the 1990s [26] and have only included reviews published since that date. We have therefore provided a focused account of what should be the highest quality reviews available. In spite of this, our own overview is limited in the conclusions it can come to regarding the determinants and consequences of turnover by the limitations of the systematic reviews that we systematically reviewed, for two reasons in particular. First, the coterminous use of outcome measures of intention with those of action (that is intention to leave with turnover, for example) is problematic and we are also limited in that we have partially replicated this concern in this overview, whilst also seeking to be explicit about the measures we have combined. This issue is considered in-depth in the turnover literature outside of nursing with acknowledgment of the poor translation of intentions to behavior [25] illustrated through wide statistical credibility estimates of the relationship [23] . Evidence suggests that the relationship can be moderated by, for example, structural variables [25] or personality traits [49] . As intentions are considered to overestimate actual performance (here, actual turnover), the determinants we present may have moderator effects not previously presented in the nursing literature. An important recommendation of this review is that the concepts related to nursing turnover are carefully considered and defined and consensus reached about the priorities for future research and workforce development to increase the pertinence and co-ordination of future research to provide evidence that can inform decision making in human resources practice and planning in healthcare and nursing. Second, and fundamentally, we are limited by the absence of any reviews that have been assessed to offer strong evidence. The literature we reviewed offered no opportunities to carry out the meta-analysis of antecedents and correlates which we find in the broader human resource turnover literature, where not only are primary studies' findings statistically pooled, but variations in base rates of turnover and moderators in statistical models of turnover are tested [23] . We also note that the majority of the reviews we included did not specify what type of 'leaving' their primary studies referred to, that is leaving a department, an employer or the profession; only four of the studies mention this; three of these refer to leaving the profession.",

However, when we applied criteria based upon guidance for the good conduct of systematic reviews [26] we systematically and explicitly excluded large numbers of reviews, and reviewed a relatively small number in full. The results are not surprising in content of determinants and consequences as we developed a thematic index based on the reviews we were reviewing, several of which grouped determinants similarly, for example using the groupings of individual, interpersonal and organisational factors [27] . The results are also not entirely surprising when viewed in the context of the broader management literature on the wide range of researched antecedents to turnoverfor example, if we look at what Holtom et al. (2008) [24] described as the major trends in turnover research in the preceding decade, our overview points to some evidence on the role of interpersonal relationships, of organisational commitment and embeddedness and of job satisfaction, but it does not present evidence in the nursing literature on individual difference predictions such as personality or of working conditions; nor of dynamic processes. The overview also contains substantial literature related to demographic issues that Griffeth et al. (2000) [23] consider to be decreasing in importance. The rising issues of social networks [25] and cultural differences [24] , as well as multi-level investigations [24] are equally lacking in visibility in the reviews we have included. In recognition of these differences, and the limitations of the quality of the literature and the predominance of intention to leave versus actual turnover in the nursing turnover literature, we have not sought to try to fit it to one particular model from the literature outside of nursing.",

Despite the plethora of reviews, the gaps in strongly evidencebased knowledge about adult nursing turnover limit the conclusions that can be drawn even from the relatively stronger reviews from which we built our overview. We suggest that this could contribute to a continuing problem, if managerial decision makers have not been clearly signposted to robustly conducted systematic reviews based on robustly conducted and/or robustly critiqued primary studies.",

A body of moderate quality review evidence does exist giving a picture of multiple determinants of turnover in adult nursing, with individual level nurse stress and dissatisfaction factors and organisational level managerial style and supervisory support factors holding most weight, as well as the economic consequence of the turnover. Our systematic review of the review literature uses the quality of the review alongside the quality of the included primary studies and which outcomes they measure to progress the usefulness of the body of review literature for decision makers, in terms of the determinants themselves. In using the quality of the review alongside the quality of the included primary studies and which outcomes they measure the evidence is far from definitive. Further research, of rigorous research design, drawing on recommendations from the wider management literature on turnover, whether quantitative or qualitative, particularly against the outcome of actual turnover as opposed to intention to leave, and modelling determinants in combination, taking account of confounding factors, is required.
