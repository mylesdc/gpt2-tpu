            "text": "Background: The recent Ebola virus (EBOV) epidemic highlights the need for efficacious virucidal products to help prevent infection and limit the spread of Ebola virus disease. However, there is limited data on the efficacy of virucidal products against EBOV, because the virus has a high biosafety level and is only available in a few laboratories worldwide. The virucidal efficacy of antiseptics and disinfectants can be determined using the European Standard EN14476:2013/FprA1:2015. Modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) was introduced in 2014 as a reference virus for the claim 'virucidal active against enveloped viruses for hygienic hand rub and hand wash'. For EBOV, also an enveloped virus, the suitability of MVA as a surrogate needs to be proven. The aim of this study was to test the in vitro efficacy of four povidone iodine (PVP-I) formulations against EBOV: 4 % PVP-I skin cleanser; 7.5 % PVP-I surgical scrub; 10 % PVP-I solution; and 3.2 % PVP-I and 78 % alcohol solution. The formulations were tested with MVA to define the test conditions, and as a secondary objective the suitability of MVA as a surrogate for enveloped viruses like EBOV was assessed. Methods: According to EN14476, a standard suspension test was used for MVA. Large-volume plating was used for EBOV to increase test sensitivity and exclude potential after-effects. All products were tested under clean (0.3 g/L BSA) and dirty (3.0 g/L BSA + 3.0 mL/L erythrocytes) conditions with MVA for 15, 30, and 60 s. The concentration-contact time values obtained with MVA were verified for EBOV. Results: Viral titres of MVA and EBOV were reduced by >99.99 % to >99.999 % under clean and dirty conditions after application of the test products for 15 seconds. Conclusions: All products showed excellent virucidal efficacy against EBOV, demonstrating the important role PVP-I can play in helping to prevent and limit the spread of Ebola virus disease. The efficacy against both test viruses after 15 s is helpful information for the implementation of guidance for people potentially exposed to EBOV, and confirms the excellent virucidal efficacy of PVP-I against enveloped viruses. MVA was found to be a suitable surrogate for enveloped viruses like EBOV.",

This can be achieved by ensuring that disinfectants pass a virucidal activity test performed in compliance with good laboratory practice and country-specific standards. In Europe, EN14476 [7] describes the standard for determining virucidal activity, which involves three non-enveloped viruses: poliovirus type 1 LSc-2ab, adenovirus type 5 strain (AdV-5) Adenoid 75, and murine norovirus, but until recently, no enveloped virus. Interestingly, for several years the German guideline for virucidal testing [8] has included tests of disinfectants against enveloped viruses including MVA and bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV), allowing products that are effective against enveloped viruses to be labelled as having a 'limited spectrum of virucidal activity'.",

The choice of model viruses is of great importance when establishing such a standard test method. The requirements for model viruses include high resistance to disinfectants and drying, combined with simple virus propagation in cell culture (e.g. growing in high titres). The experts in WG1 suggested the enveloped virus modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) as the reference virus for the claim 'virucidal active against enveloped viruses for hygienic hand rub and hand wash'. This virus has been shown to produce similar results to vaccinia virus strain Elstree in virucidal testing [9] , and was chosen because of its low biosafety level that means it does not pose any hazard to employees performing the tests [10] , its known environmental stability and its practicability for laboratory use [11, 12] . In contrast, EBOV is a lethal virus and requires the highest biosafety levels for any investigation. Therefore, it is only available for testing in a few laboratories worldwide.",

In a water-soluble complex, the elemental iodine is bound to the carrier polyvinylpyrrolidone. In an aqueous medium, a chemical equilibrium develops to release the active antimicrobial agent iodine, while the complex-linked iodine builds a reservoir for delivery [14] . Thereby, its microbicidal activity is maintained but the cytotoxic effects of high concentrations of iodine are reduced [14] . The oxidative potency of PVP-I enables the iodine released to react rapidly with functional groups of amino acids and nucleotides, as well as with double bonds of fatty acids, resulting in a manifold destruction of various structures and enzymes of microbes and viruses. The development of resistance mechanisms against the very broad oxidative attack appears almost impossible [13, 15] .",

The host cells (Collection of Cell Lines in Veterinary Medicine [CCLV], Friedrich Loeffler Institute, Germany) were cultivated at 37\u00b0C in a humid atmosphere under 5.0 % CO 2 . For the virus cultivation, confluent monolayers with a maximum age of 2 days were used. The cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C until 70-95 % of the cells exhibited a cytopathic effect (approximately 7 days). The cells were frozen and thawed twice, followed by centrifugation at 1,900 g for 10 min. The virus titre was up-scaled by ultra centrifugation at 4\u00b0C at 53,900 g for 2.5 h. The pellet was resuspended in 2 mL medium and aliquots of the virus suspension were stored at -70\u00b0C.",

In order to determine cytotoxicity, the test products were serially diluted ten-fold in MEM up to a dilution of 10 \u22128 .

To demonstrate at least a 4 log 10 reduction in virus titre, it is necessary for test mixtures containing low virus titres to undergo detoxification by molecular sieving, or to use a more sensitive assay such as LVP [8] .

Due to the recent Ebola outbreak, MVA was introduced as a reference virus for all enveloped viruses. However, there was still uncertainty about whether this surrogate would be suitable for dangerous viruses such as EBOV. In this study, we investigated the antiviral efficacy of PVP-I against MVA and then verified the concentration and contact time findings with EBOV. We found that PVP-I was as effective against EBOV as MVA with similar concentration and contact time parameters. In fact, when comparing the results with the 4 % PVP-I skin cleanser, which was prediluted to 1:100 for the EBOV test, MVA was even more resistant to PVP-I under dirty conditions than EBOV. Our results suggest that MVA is a suitable surrogate test virus that can be safely used for testing the virucidal efficacy of antiseptic products against EBOV. In another study by Steinmann et al. [27] , a hand wash containing 7.5 % PVP-I was active against vaccinia virus and BVDV within 30 s, but not against the non-enveloped viruses tested. However, in a fingerpad test simulating practical conditions, the PVP-I containing soap was superior to other sanitisers against the non-enveloped viruses.",

In order to further improve our knowledge of the time/concentration relationships of hand rubs and hand wash products which reflect daily needs in clinical surroundings, more practical testing would be necessary. EN1500 [30] describes a bactericidal test simulating practical conditions in volunteers, however, there is no enveloped harmless virus available that can be used to inoculate the volunteers. More than 30 years ago, tests with vaccinia virus on the fingertips of volunteers were performed [31] , however today this can no longer be justified ethically.",

According to WHO guidelines, hand hygiene is the most important infection prevention and control measure against EBOV [6] . Generally, there are two methods of hand hygiene, social hand washing and hygienic hand disinfection [32, 33] . Socially clean hands are achieved using soap and water, which removes transient microorganisms. Social hand washing should be practised before and after performing routine tasks in all clinical areas. Hygienic hand disinfection is carried out with alcohol-based hand rubs toto remove or destroy all transient microorganisms, and may have a prolonged effect. It is recommended, for example, Since the skin is a routine source of infection transmission, the use of PVP-I for hand disinfection may be an alternative to WHO recommended alcohol-based hand rubs. Medicated soaps containing PVP-I are available. Thus, the hygiene measure of hand washing is supported by the virucidal effect of PVP-I. This could be extended beyond surgical use. Healthcare professionals, patients, family members and professionals at risk of infection could use these products to protect themselves after exposure to patients. PVP-I soap has shown similar efficacy to alcoholbased hand sanitisers against norovirus in a hand wash model [27] . Chlorhexidine-and triclosan-based hand washes, however, were not effective against norovirus in suspension tests and practical application tests [27] .",

Results in bold indicate virucidal activity (\u22654 log 10 reduction in viral titre) Virucidal activity of PVP-I Our study confirmed the excellent virucidal activity of PVP-I described in the literature. In one study by Sauerbrei and Wutzler [23], PVP-I solution and PVP-I/alcohol solution showed good efficacy against enveloped viruses (vaccinia virus and bovine viral diarrhoea virus [BVDV]) within 30 s. With the non-enveloped viruses tested, the PVP-I solution showed good efficacy within 5 min against polyomavirus SV40 and adenovirus, but took \u226560 min to inactivate poliovirus type 1. The PVP-I/alcohol solution showed better overall efficacy, especially against the nonenveloped viruses, causing significant inactivation of all test viruses within 5 min, and highlighting the synergistic virucidal activity of PVP-I and alcohol.",
