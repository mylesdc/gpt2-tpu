            "text": "Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5 (CCL5) belongs to a group of chemokines that play a role in the peripheral immune system, mostly as chemoattractant molecules, and mediate tactile allodynia. In the central nervous system (CNS), CCL5 and its receptors have multiple functions, including promoting neuroinflammation, insulin signaling, neuromodulator of synaptic activity and neuroprotection against a variety of neurotoxins. Evidence has also suggested that this chemokine may regulate opioid response. The multifunctional profile of CCL5 might correlate with its ability to bind different chemokine receptors, as well as with its unique cellular expression. In this work, we have used fluorescence in situ hybridization combined with immunohistochemistry to examine the expression profile of CCL5 mRNA in the adult rat brain and provide evidence of its cellular localization. We have observed that the highest expression of CCL5 mRNA occurs in all major fiber tracts, including the corpus callosum, anterior commissure, and cerebral peduncle. In these tracts, CCL5 mRNA was localized in oligodendrocytes, astrocytes and microglia. Astrocytic and microglial expression was also evident in several brain areas including the cerebral cortex, caudate/putamen, hippocampus, and thalamus. Furthermore, using a specific neuronal marker, we observed CCL5 mRNA expression in discrete layers of the cortex and hippocampus. Interestingly, in the midbrain, CCL5 mRNA co-localized with tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) positive cells of the ventral tegmental area, suggesting that CCL5 might be expressed by a subset of dopaminergic neurons of the mesolimbic system. The expression of CCL5 mRNA and protein, together with its receptors, in selected brain cell populations proposes that this chemokine could be involved in neuronal/glial communication.",

            "text": "Of particular interest is the chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5 (CCL5), formerly known as Regulated on Activation Normal T-cell Expressed and Secreted (RANTES). CCL5 is a small protein of 68 amino acids that activate mononuclear phagocytes and induce their migration across the blood brain barrier to the site of inflammation (Ubogu et al., 2006) . The role of CCL5 in inflammation has also been inferred by an association between increased CCL5 protein expression and the degree of inflammation in a variety of disorders and pathologies, including neuropathic pain (Bhangoo et al., 2007) , asthma, atherosclerosis and arthritis among others (Marques et al., 2013) . However, in the brain, CCL5 function goes beyond the one attributed to a classic pro-inflammatory chemokine. In fact, CCL5 is capable of inducing proliferation of Oli-neu, an oligodendrocyte precursor-like cell line (Kadi et al., 2006) suggesting a role in myelination. Moreover, CCL5 promotes the migration of dorsal root ganglia cells in vitro (Bolin et al., 1998) , and regulates the differentiation of astrocytes (Bakhiet et al., 2001) suggesting that CCL5 may act as a neurotrophic factor. In addition, ex vivo activation of CCL5 receptor (CCR5) by CCL5 increases glucose transporter type 4 membrane translocation in the hypothalamus (Chou et al., 2016) , suggesting a role of CCL5 in glucose uptake and metabolism. These examples highlight the potential role of CCL5 as a modulator of cellular metabolism and brain architecture. Lastly, CCL5 exerts neuroprotective activity against various neurotoxins including glutamate (Bruno et al., 2000) , \u03b2-amyloid (Ignatov et al., 2006) , and the HIV proteins gp120 (Campbell et al., 2015) and tat (Rozzi et al., 2014) . The different effects of CCL5 could be due to the ability of this chemokine to bind to multiple receptors. The selective and differential expression of CCL5 and its receptors, CCR5 (Avdoshina et al., 2011) , CCR3 (He et al., 1997) and CCR1 (Tran et al., 2007) in the rodent brain supports the role of CCL5 as a potential modulator of brain homeostasis. Nevertheless, the functional role of CCL5 in the brain could be more in line with the suggested properties of some chemokines to act as a third neurotransmitter system (Adler et al., 2005) helping neuronal communication (Rostene et al., 2007) , perhaps through modulation of the release of glutamate from nerve endings (Musante et al., 2008) .",

CCL5 KO mice have been validated by northern blot analysis of total RNA isolated from LPS-stimulated peritoneal exudate cells (Makino et al., 2002) . Three-month-old male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (225-250 g) were purchased from Charles River Laboratory (Germantown, MD, USA). Animals were housed under standard conditions with food and water ad libitum and maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle. Animals were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine/xylazine (80 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, i.p.) and intracardially perfused with ice-cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) followed by perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). After perfusion, whole brains were quickly removed and post-fixed in 4% PFA overnight and transferred sequentially into a 10%, 20% and 30% sucrose solution. Post-fixed brains were used for RNA in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry studies. All studies were carried out following the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals as adopted and promulgated by the U.S. National Institutes of Health and approved by Georgetown University Animal Care and Use Committee.",

Therefore, we first validated the specificity of the CCL5 probe for RNAscope by comparing CCL5 mRNA signal in brain sections from WT and CCL5 KO mice. In the cortex ( Figure 1A ) and corpus callosum ( Figure 1D ) of WT mice, the CCL5 probe produced a strong fluorescent signal, characterized by red dots co-localizing with DAPI positive cells (insets in Figures 1A,D) , suggesting a nuclear localization.

For instance, the corpus callosum (cc, Figure 2A1 ) and the anterior commissure (Ac, Figure 2A3 ) contained more puncta than the caudate/putamen (CPu, Figure 2A2 ). In the cerebral cortex, more hybridization was observed in layers III/IV than II and VI ( Figure 2B1) .

In the midbrain, areas with CCL5 mRNA signal included the cerebral peduncles (CP, Figure 2C ), and the ventral tegmental area (VTA, Figure 2C1 ). Semi-quantitative analyses revealed that CCL5 mRNA is expressed in several brain regions, in agreement with previous studies , but that there is an overall higher expression of CCL5 mRNA in areas containing fiber tracts. These include the corpus callosum, anterior commissure, external capsule, fimbria, optic tract and cerebral peduncle ( Table 1) . Moreover, we observed CCL5 mRNA positive signal in several brain areas, including the cerebral cortex, striatum, hippocampus, thalamus and midbrain ( Table 1) . Within these brain structures, CCL5 mRNA was detected only in selected areas. For instance, the piriform cortex was negative ( Table 1) . In the striatum, the dorsomedial portion exhibited more CCL5 mRNA signal than the ventromedial one ( Table 1) . Taken together, our data suggest that different cell type may express CCL5 mRNA.",

To reveal which cells express CCL5 mRNA, we examined the corpus callosum utilizing RNAscope in situ hybridization combined with immunohistochemistry for specific glial cell markers. These include GFAP, an astrocytic marker, Iba-1, a microglia/macrophage-specific marker, and Nkx2.2, a marker to identify oligodendrocyte progenitor cells. We found that CCL5 mRNA in the corpus callosum is predominantly inside nuclei of cells, evidenced by the co-localization of DAPI (blue) with the CCL5 mRNA hybridization signal, that were in GFAP (Figures 3A1-4) , Iba-1 (Figures 3B1-4) and Nkx2.2 (Figures 3C1-4) positive cells. Noteworthy, Nkx2.2 positive cells were aligned in parallel rows (Figure 3C3 ), which is a typical property of adult oligodendrocyte progenitor cells. Quantitative analyses of CCL5 mRNA in the corpus callosum revealed that 53.3%, 31.4% and 72.4% of GFAP, Iba-1 and Nkx2.2 positive cells, respectively, expressed CCL5 mRNA while no CCL5 mRNA was found in neurons ( Figure 4A) . These results validate the notion that the corpus callosum contains a high percentage of oligodendrocytes expressing CCL5 mRNA.",

To characterize which cells express CCL5 mRNA in these layers, serial sections were examined by RNAscope in situ hybridization combined with immunohistochemistry, using glial specific markers as described above. The neuron-specific nuclear protein marker, NeuN, was used to detect neurons. We observed that the fluorescent puncta of CCL5 mRNAs in layers III and IV were co-localized with NeuN (Figures 5A1-4) , Iba-1 (Figures 5B1-4) , as well as GFAP (Figures 5C1-4) positive cells. More positive puncta were observed in glial cells (Figures 5B4,C4 ) than neurons (Figure 5A4) , suggesting that cortical neurons express CCL5 mRNA in low abundance. Although we did not quantify CCL5 protein levels due to the lack of specificity of the antibodies, this result supports previous in vitro data that neurons produce and release CCL5 protein at a lower level than glial cells (Avdoshina et al., 2010) . In layer V, CCL5 mRNA was also observed in Nkx2.2 positive cells (Figures 5D1-4) , overall suggesting that in the cerebral cortex glia cell as well neurons express CCL5 mRNA. To confirm this finding, we carried out a quantitative analysis of CCL5 mRNA puncta, 48.9% of neurons, 44.1% of astrocytes, 12% of microglia and 13.3% oligodendrocytes were also positive for CCL5 mRNA (Figure 4B ).",

However, a constitutive expression of CCL5 mRNA was also present in some subset of neuronal cell in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, and especially in dopamine-producing neurons of the VTA. Altogether, our data characterize a constitutively anatomical and cellular expression of CCL5 mRNA in the rat brain. Most importantly, we observed CCL5 mRNA in various cells even without injury or inflammation.",

For example, CX3CL1, the first chemokine shown to be expressed in neurons, is constitutively expressed in human (Raport et al., 1995) and rat brain (Nishiyori et al., 1998) . CXCL12, also known as stromal derived factor-1, is expressed in different cell types throughout the rat brain, including astrocytes, microglia, and neurons (Banisadr et al., 2003) . Similarly, CCL2 is constitutively expressed in neurons and astrocytes, but not in oligodendrocytes or microglia (Banisadr et al., 2005) . Our data shows that under physiological conditions CCL5 mRNA is constitutively expressed in all glial cells (microglia, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes) as well as in a subset of neurons. Although in this work we only measured mRNA, the fact that CCL5 proteins are detected in the adult brain supports the notion that CCL5, like other chemokines (Banisadr et al., 2003) , might have a role as potential modulators of brain function.",

In addition, levels of a given peptide do not necessarily reflect the site of synthesis. An alternative approach is measuring mRNA by RNAscope technology, which in addition to the sensitivity for the detection of low abundance mRNA molecules (S\u00f8rdal et al., 2013) . In our study, we were able to observe low number of puncta within cells, as well as an agglomerate of puncta. The highest hybridization signal was mostly observed in glial cells. Moreover, in several sections, we have seen puncta in DAPI positive cells, suggesting a nuclear localization. However, CCL5 mRNA was also localized outside the nucleus. Thus, it appears that from the nucleus, CCL5 mRNA might move to the cytoplasm, where the translation into CCL5 protein occurs. This event could be followed by CCL5 release. Although measuring CCL5 release in vivo is technically challenging, this notion is supported by previous data showing that brain cells in vitro release CCL5 proteins (Avdoshina et al., 2010) .",

CCL5 promotes the proliferation of an oligodendrocyte precursor-like cell line (Kadi et al., 2006) . Thus, it is possible that oligodendrocyte precursors or other glial cells might be regulating their own proliferation via the release of CCL5. Oligodendrocyte most well known role is to FIGURE 6 | Distribution of CCL5 mRNA in the hippocampus. Images are representative coronal sections showing the distribution of CCL5 mRNA (red dots) in the dentate gyrus (DG) and CA1 regions of the hippocampus. The sections were stained for NeuN (A1-3), Iba-1 (B1-3,C1-3), GFAP (D1-3), or Nkx2.2 (E1-3). DAPI (blue) was used as a counterstaining. Panels (A4-E4) are higher magnifications of areas pointed by arrows. Scale bar = 50 \u00b5m for (A1-E3), and 20 \u00b5m for high magnification images (A4-E4). preserve myelin; however, oligodendrocytes also maintain axonal integrity, support axonal metabolism and aid neuronal survival (Peferoen et al., 2014) . Changes in oligodendrocytes number and dynamics are increasingly recognized as important components in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. In taiep rats, an animal model for multiple sclerosis, CCL5 and its receptor CCR5 is down-regulated in comparison to Sprague-Dawley rats (Soto-Rodriguez et al., 2015) . Such reduction has been shown to limit the infiltration of pro-inflammatory macrophages and therefore to prevent demyelination (Glass et al., 2001) . On the other hand, CCL5 has neuroprotective properties. For example, CCL5 has been shown to exert neuroprotective activity against various neurotoxins including glutamate (Bruno et al., 2000) , \u03b2-amyloid (Ignatov et al., 2006) , and the viral proteins gp120 (Campbell et al., 2015) and Tat (Rozzi et al., 2014) . The neuroprotective activity of CCL5 could be due to its ability to increase neurotrophic factors, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor and epidermal growth factor (Tokami et al., 2013) . Thus, it is conceivable to suggest that oligodendrocyte-derived CCL5 could act as a regulator of neuronal survival.",

Moreover, few TH-positive cells in the VTA expressed CCL5 mRNA, indicating that CCL5 may be expressed by a subset of dopaminergic neurons. Why CCL5 mRNA is detected only a subset of dopamine neurons is at present unclear. The VTA also contains GABAergic neurons (Dobi et al., 2010) .

Dopamine neurons of the VTA belong to the dopaminergic mesolimbic system, which comprises several interconnected brain regions, including the nucleus accumbens and the prefrontal cortex. Activation of this system is crucial for the reward and addictive properties of opioids (Wise and Rompre, 1989; Pontieri et al., 1995) . We have previously shown that CCL5 protein levels are increased in morphine dependent rats in brain areas involved in opioid reward . CCL5 has also been shown to interact with opioid receptors causing heterologous desensitization (Szabo et al., 2002) . Thus, CCL5, when produced in dopaminergic fibers innervating the nucleus accumbens or prefrontal cortex could be contributing to regulation of dependence to opioids as previously suggested . CCL5 might act as a neuromodulator to enhance/inhibit the synaptic transmission underlying opioid reward. Although still speculative, this suggestion is supported by data showing that CCR5, the receptor for CCL5, is expressed in selected neuronal populations of the frontal cortex and striatum (Avdoshina et al., 2011) . Moreover, CCL5 increases the release of glutamate (Musante et al., 2008; Di Prisco et al., 2012 ) whose activity could induce various forms of synaptic plasticity and cellular adaptations that are responsible for opioid tolerance and addiction (Manzoni and Williams, 1999; Stuber et al., 2010 Stuber et al., , 2011 .",
