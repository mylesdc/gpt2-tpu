            "text": "Programmed ribosomal frameshifting has been historically associated with viruses and retrotransposons. Retroviruses require frameshifting for replication and infection (Maia et al., 1996; Brierley and Dos Ramos, 2006; Dulude et al., 2006) . For example, the HIV1 polyprotein gag-pol requires efficient \u22121 frameshifting for expression of the individual gag and pol gene products. This form of frameshifting usually depends on a combination of a \"slippery sequence,\" a spacer sequence of 1-15 nucleotides, and a stem-loop secondary RNA structure such as a pseudoknot (Figure 1 ) (Namy et al., 2006) . The slippery sequence is generally of the type X XXY YYZ, where X denotes any nucleotide, Y denotes A or U, and Z is A, U, or C. Pseudoknots are secondary RNA substructures that contain two or more stemloop motifs with intercalated stems. The pseudoknot or stemloop structure in the mRNA is thought to result in pausing of the ribosome, resulting in eventual frameshifting (Namy et al., 2006) . Structural evidence for this mechanism comes from the crystal structure of the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) pseudoknot, which has an unpaired adenine that acts as a hinge to mediate frameshifting (Chen et al., 1996) . Generally, there is a correlation between the mechanical strength of an mRNA pseudoknot and its frameshifting efficiency (Hansen et al., 2007) : the stronger the pseudoknot the higher the frameshifting efficiency, although very strong pseudoknots can cause a road block that limits translation downstream (Tholstrup et al., 2011) .",

Alternative splicing may contribute to frameshifting (Hiller et al., 2005) , as can codon bias. For instance, rare tRNA codons can favor \u22121 and +1 frameshifting (Gurvich et al., 2005; Laine et al., 2008) , and rare arginine codons prime mitochondrial sequences for frameshifting (Temperley et al., 2010) . Moreover, CAG repeats are prone to frameshifting, which results in poly-alanine proteins that may contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases (Toulouse et al., 2005) . The use of the peptidyltransferase inhibitor anisomycin reduces \u22121 frameshifting in these cases and reduces the toxicity associated with the expanded triplet repeats. Importantly, out-of-frame proteins (compared to the standard ORFeome annotation) can also result from alternative AUG or CUG start sites (Ingolia et al., 2011) , thereby considerably increasing the size of an alternative \"frameshifted\" proteome. Main sources of out-of-frame peptides and proteins are shown in Figure 2 .",

ODC activity is terminated by the antizyme (Murakami et al., 1992) -providing an elegant mechanism for shutting down the activity of an enzyme by producing an out-of-frame antizyme from the same mRNA.

Gentamicin-induced read-through of stop codons has been evaluated as a treatment option for Duchenne's muscular dystrophy (Malik et al., 2010) .

A phase I/II clinical trial using a morpholino oligomer (AVI-4658) to correct a frameshift mutation in the dystrophin gene has been completed with the conclusion that AVI-4658 was well tolerated and had significant benefit in patients with Duchenne's muscular dystrophy (Cirak et al., 2011) .",

It has been proposed that dual coding limits the evolutionary flexibility of the underlying nucleotide sequence (Firth and Brown, 2006; Rancurel et al., 2009 ). Thus, one possibility may be that frameshifting occurs predominantly in highly conserved, essential genes. However, it has been argued that once a frameshift event is released from selective pressure, as occurs in gene duplication, it can evolve to produce a beneficial functional protein (Raes and Van de Peer, 2005) . Indeed, in some cases, novel genes seem to have emerged by frameshifting of a pre-existing coding sequence (Ohno, 1984; Ranz et al., 2003) . Moreover, regulated frameshifting can allow the same gene to produce alternative beneficial proteins. In fact, evolutionary studies indicate a high abundance of frameshift events in human and mouse genomes that may be linked to an increased usage of the opal TGA stop codon (Okamura et al., 2006) . It has been proposed that at least 1% of the human genome consists of dual coding regions (Michel et al., 2012) and that the number of out-of-frame peptides or proteins may be even higher than that. Other studies have suggested that \u223c10% of the genome contains \u22121 frameshift signals (Belew et al., 2011) . I would argue that the number of frameshifted peptides or proteins is somewhere in the range of 1-10% of the genome. This is a very significant fraction of the genome, thus suggesting that out-offrame peptides are an inherent part of animal physiology and part of evolutionary selection processes. Accordingly, it can be anticipated that dual coding is regulated and a common mechanism for producing additional gene products. The main questions are:",

Validation can be done by low-throughput experimental methods, either using antibodies raised against the frameshifted protein or using genetic manipulations that ablate the frameshift protein without disrupting the zero frame protein, if possible.

Computational methods (1) using databases that interrogate the genome for \u22121 or +1 frameshift motifs can give information about frameshifting events. Limitations of this approach are that only known frameshift motifs are taken into account. Furthermore, this method does not give any information whether predicted frameshift events occur in vivo or the functional relevance of frameshifting events. Experimental methods (2) can identify frameshift events that occur in vivo. Most commonly, an antibody that is specific to the out-of-frame sequence of the frameshifted protein is used to detect frameshifted proteins. Ribosome profiling methods such as Ribo-Seq (3) can be used to detect out-of-frame peptides on a genomic scale. cDNA screening and the use of tandem luciferase reporter constructs (4) can be used to experimentally detect frameshift events. Limitations of this approach are that overexpression may result in dysregulated expression and differences in translation compared to endogenous expression levels. Proteomic methods (5) using mass spectrometry are suitable to detect endogenous out-of-frame peptides. However, the levels of frameshifted proteins may be low and escape the detection limit.

Based on commonalities between these sequences, the associated FSFinder allows mining of the genome for potential frameshift sequences. (http:// wilab.inha.ac.kr/fsdb) At present, the database contains a total of 63 experimental and 190 predicted sequences from viruses, prokaryotes and eukaryotes. FSFinder uses a combination of slippery sequences and pseudoknot or stem-loop prediction. The heptameric slippery sequences for +1 and \u22121 frameshifting are Frontiers in Genetics | Genomic Assay Technology November 2012 | Volume 3 | Article 242 | 4 listed in Table 2 . It is noteworthy that FSDB includes deviations from the standard X XXY YYZ slippery sequence for prediction of \u22121 frameshifting, whereas +1 frameshift sequences often contain stop codons. Although most prediction databases use similar principles (slippery sequence plus pseudoknot), they differ in prediction of frameshifting events. This may be due to variable thresholds applied or different RNA folding algorithms. In order to identify expressed proteins, one has to consider the length of the predicted out-of-frame protein. Most frameshifted proteins initiated by predicted slippery sites will terminate within 5-10 codons, thus producing truncated or non-functional peptides or proteins. Alternative approaches that take out-of-frame protein length into account might be beneficial. For instance, MLOGD (http:// guinevere.otago.ac.nz/aef/MLOGD/) is a program for detection of overlapping coding sequences based on sequence alignments and analysis of mutation patterns (Firth and Brown, 2006) . The limitations of this approach are that less conserved coding sequences will not be identified, and -2 frame overlaps can be identified as false positives.",

It is worth noting that frameshifting will most likely result in chimeric sequences composed of a stretch of zero frame peptides linked to out-of-frame peptides, which can be a small or large part of the overall protein, depending on where the frameshift site is. Alternatively, frameshifting could lead to truncation of the original protein, where a very small fractionif any-of the overall protein is out-of-frame (Figure 4) . Those proteins that have a sufficient predicted length could then be validated by raising specific antibodies against that sequence. In order to raise an antibody, one has to know the precise FIGURE 4 | Protein composition as a consequence of frameshifting. The original zero frame is shown in gray, whereas out-of-frame sequences are shown in red or blue colour. A frameshifting event is marked by the arrow. Frameshifting can result in chimeric peptides composed of the original frame and out-of-frame sequences that can form a small or larger part of the overall protein, depending on where the frameshift event takes place. It is also possible that more than one frameshifting event takes place within the same mRNA, thus resulting in mosaic hybrid peptide sequences.

            "text": "Genomic methods such as RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) have emerged as powerful tools to profile RNA content in cells. RNA-seq is based on high-throughput sequencing of a cDNA library generated from cellular RNA. In its standard form, RNAseq enables the identification of indels, but will fail to identify post-transcriptional phenotypes and will therefore fail to identify programmed ribosomal frameshifting or dual coded genes. Nevertheless, ribosome profiling methods such as Ribo-seq have been developed that allow the identification of active translation, based on sequencing of cDNA libraries generated from ribosomeprotected fragments (Ingolia et al., 2009) . In this case, mRNA bound to ribosomes is first cross-linked and then isolated using, e.g., sucrose gradient density centrifugation. Next, a nuclease digestion step results in removal of mRNA sequence that is not bound (\"protected\") to ribosomes. The protected RNA bound to ribosomes is then reverse transcribed into cDNA and sequenced. Therefore, the precise position of a ribosome can be matched to the site of active translation. An adaptation of this method using the drug harringtonine to cause ribosome accumulation at initiation codons has allowed the identification of translation start sites and confirmed that many proteins are initiated at non-AUG or alternative AUG sites (Ingolia et al., 2011) . In this study, 44% of detected AUG start sites were unannotated, and a large fraction of these encoded out-of-frame peptides. Further uses of ribosome profiling have confirmed that the identification of frameshifts is possible using genomic technologies (Michel et al., 2012) . Although this approach is unbiased in the sense that it does not pre-filter genetic regions, one problem is the nonuniformity of ribosome-protected fragment reads. For instance, the preparation of cDNA libraries generated from ribosomeprotected fragments can result in over-or under-representation of sequence reads. This can be overcome by a computational approach that measures the cumulative subcodon proportion difference of ribosome-protected fragments relative to local subcodon positions. The authors have therefore combined experimental data from Ribo-Seq with a computational approach in order to identify novel frameshifted protein sequences. Using this approach, several new frameshifted protein sequences were identified, most of which were dual-encoded. The authors estimate that more than 1% of the genome may consist of dualcoding regions, and this is likely an underestimation. Further improvements to the method, including deeper sequencing to get better coverage of ribosome-protected fragments, will help to identify these genes.",

Further, most commonly used cDNA libraries such as the ORFeome are designed to avoid expression of frameshifted peptides-for instance, by deletion of the 5 and 3 -UTR. It may, however, be possible that certain phenotypes in cDNA screening are exerted by out-of-frame proteins. In order to fish for phenotypic effects exerted by such peptides, cDNA libraries can be designed in a way that genomic fragments are inserted downstream of an AUG start codon in +1 or \u22121 frame so that all genomic fragments are deliberately frameshifted. A subsequent functional phenotypic screen can then identify phenotypes associated with expression of such deliberate frameshift fragments. However, there are limitations in such an approach, e.g., where to place the frameshift. Also, deliberately expressed out-of-frame proteins may have little physiological relevance.",

Recently, an adaptation of this approach has been developed using fluorophores that are amenable to high-throughput screening applications (Cardno et al., 2009 ). An in vivo adaptation for yeast cells has been proposed for use in high-throughput screening experiments (Harger and Dinman, 2003) . For instance, a random nucleotide sequence can be inserted between the in-frame and the out-of-frame luciferase to determine which sequence will result in high levels of out-of-frame expression. The main advantages of such a system are the broad linear range of the assay, the internal mRNA expression control (luciferase 1), the possibility to normalize relative frameshift expression, and the ease of use. One problem with the approach is that the secondary structure is affected by the length of the sequence inserted in the dual luciferase reporter. Thus, the context of the frameshift motifs needs to be taken into account. Further, the high number of potential nucleotide combinations may outweigh the capacity of even highly automated processes. Even though this will identify putative sequences with high potential for frameshifting, it is still not clear whether the out-of-frame peptides or proteins are stable and functional. Their presence in open reading frames may hint that a frameshift is buried within the gene. Subsequent low-throughput experimental methods (see above) need to be designed to confirm expression of the frameshifted protein.",

In mass spectrometry (MS), peptides of endogenous proteins are first detected as a mass per ion. In the most common approach, recorded masses are matched to all potential masses in the respective database by search algorithms like SEQUEST, MASCOT, Andromeda, or PEAKS. In a next step, sequence information generated in tandem MS (MS/MS) experiments is employed to identify potential hits within the shortlisted peptide variants. Commonly searched databases by MASCOT are SwissProt, NCBInr, and EMBL EST. These databases integrate cDNA and EST sequences and generally do not contain out-of-frame peptides. However, as MS database search algorithms compute the entire sequence space of potential peptide matches to identify peptides within analyzed samples, it is in principle possible to identify out-of-frame peptides.",

In some cases, the identified peptides do not match the database for various reasons, including errors in gene/protein annotation and post-translational modifications in the peptides that are not accounted for. Usually, unmatched peptides are not reported in publications and are disregarded from further analysis. It is possible that some of these unmatched peptides correspond to an alternative reading frame. In order to match these peptides, one would need to generate a database derived from the +1/\u22121 frames of the ORFeome, similar to what Okamura et al. have done (Okamura et al., 2006) , and make these accessible to the proteomic community. One problem is the \"breakpoint\" of frameshifting, which would generate a peptide that is partially composed of the original frame and partially of the frameshifted peptide (see Figure 4) . Another problem in this approach may be the paucity of frameshifted peptides, as they are commonly expressed at lower levels (see above) and may not be easily detectable by MS approaches.

In principle, such proteins might be involved in any cellular process, but may be correlated with certain cellular pathways. For instance, amino acid starvation can induce frameshifting in bacteria (Barak et al., 1996) . One hypothesis is that this is due to a short supply of amino-acylated tRNA as a consequence of amino acid limitations. This is supported by the observation that antizyme expression (the +1 frame) is maintained under conditions of amino acid starvation, while expression of ODC (the 0 frame) is reduced in rat intestinal epithelial cells (Ray et al., 2012) . Moreover, treatment with mTOR inhibitors such as rapamycin also reduce 0 frame expression while maintaining antizyme expression. One could hypothesize that reduced fidelity in translation may enhance frameshifting. On the other hand, both translation inhibition and amino acid starvation are conditions that increase autophagy in eukaryotic cells, raising the possibility that the production of outof-frame proteins may be functionally coupled to the regulation of autophagy.",
