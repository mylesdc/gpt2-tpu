            "text": "Dromedary camels are important reservoir hosts of various coronaviruses, including Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) that cause human infections. CoV genomes regularly undergo recombination during infection as observed in bat SARS-related CoVs. Here we report for the first time that only a small proportion of MERS-CoV receptor-binding domain positive (RBD) of spike protein positive camel sera in Kenya were also seropositive to MERS-CoV nucleocapsid (NP). In contrast, many of them contain antibodies against bat HKU8-related (HKU8r)-CoVs. Among 584 camel samples that were positive against MERS-CoV RBD, we found only 0.48 (8.22%) samples were also positive for NP. Furthermore, we found bat HKU8r-CoV NP antibody in 73 (12.5%) of the MERS-CoV RBD positive and NP negative samples, yet found only 3 (0.43%) of the HKU8r-CoV S1 antibody in the same samples. These findings may indicate co-infection with MERS-CoV and a HKU8r-CoV in camels. It may also raise the possibility of the circulation of a recombinant coronavirus virus with the spike of MERS-CoV and the NP of a HKU8r-CoV in Kenya. We failed to find molecular evidence of an HKU8r-CoV or a putative recombinant virus. Our findings should alert other investigators to look for molecular evidence of HKU8r-CoV or recombinants.",

The WHO recommendation for laboratory detection of the causal agent, MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) includes realtime RT-PCR targeting upstream of the E protein gene or nucleocapsid protein (NP) gene, complemented with ORF1a and ORF1b [2] . Serological tests are also recommended when a viral nucleic acid test was not applicable, or for population-based serosurveys and investigations of past exposures. Viral spike (S) protein-based indirect ELISA followed by a confirmatory virus neutralization test (VNT) is the mostly widely used serological test for MERS-CoV. In contrast, NP based serological assays are seldom used because of their greater cross-reactivity [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] .",

Dromedary camels have been identified as an important source for zoonotic transmission of MERS-CoV after detection of neutralizing antibodies (76-100% seropositive) and almost identical viruses were identified in Middle East camels [3, 8] . It is widely believed that MERS-CoV could have originated from Africa as most of these animals were originally bred and exported from Africa [9] . Although, MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies and viral RNA have been found in camels from West and East African countries, zoonotic human infections have not been reported in Africa [4, 9, 10, 11] . The majority of these studies used an S-based serosurvey and showed high positivity for MERS-CoV infection in camels [3, 4, 8, 9, 11] .",

Our data revealed 584 of 891 (65.54%) Kenyan camel samples had MERS-CoV RBD antibodies (Figure 1(A) ). We then tested all camel sera using a MERS-CoV NP-based ELISA. In contrast, only 54 of 891 samples (6.04%), or 48 of the RBD positive samples (8.22%) were NP positive ( Figure  1(A) ). To confirm the finding, we developed an additional antibody assay based on mammalian expressed MERS-CoV NP using LIPS, a fast and sensitive serological tool which has previously been successfully used in SADS-CoV serosurvey [18, 19] . All NP ELISA positive sera were also positive in LIPS, while those negative samples remained negative (Figure 1(B) ). This observation was confirmed by a MERS-CoV virus-based Western blot using RBD positive samples. Two major structural proteins, NP and membrane protein were observed in the NP positive group, but not in the NP negative group (Figure 1 (C) and supplementary Figure 1(A) ). Above all, only a small proportion of the MERS-CoV RBD positive serum samples were also NP positive, different to that observed in human infection cases [6, 22] . This observation indicated that the majority of the camels may only maintain NP antibodies for a short time or be co-infected by another CoV.",

The LIPS results demonstrated clear HKU8r-CoV NP positive in some camel sera, consistent with Western blot results (Figure 2(B) ). However, no HKU8r-CoV S1 positives were found within the HKU8r-CoV NP positive samples ( Figure  2(B) ). To rule out the possible false-negative results using China HKU8r-CoV as detection antigen, a Kenyan bat HKU8r-CoV BtKY33 was also used. Results indicated that the above conclusion was not HKU8r-CoV strain-specific (Supplementary Figure  2) . The data indicates that some of the Kenyan camels have both MERS-CoV S and HKU8r-CoV NP antibodies. We then performed a nationwide serosurvey for HKU8r-CoV in camels using a HKU8r-CoV NP and S1 ELISA. Of the 584 MERS-CoV RBD positive samples tested, 73 (12.5%) were positive for HKU8r-CoV NP (Figure 2(C) ). In contrast, only 3 (0.51%) were seropositive for HKU8r-CoV S1 (Figure 2(C) ). The data suggested the idea of the co-infection of MERS/HKU8r-CoVs, alternatively, we can't rule out the existence of a chimeric MERS-CoV carrying MERS-CoV S gene but a NP gene from HKU8r-CoV in Kenyan camels (Figure 3 and Supplementary  Table 1 ). Although, we cannot rule the possibility of a novel CoV that was not detected in molecular assays but can cross-react with HKU8r or MERS coronavirus positive serum samples. It is worth to mention, another camel alphacoronaviruses, 229E-like coronaviruses were previously found in camels [26] . We then tested cross-reactivity of antibodies to the N proteins of HKU8r and 229E as the two are closely related phylogenetically. Our data demonstrated only 10/90 of the HKU8r-CoV NP positive camel serum were also 229E-NP positive (Supplementary Figure 3 (A)), which was probably true positive for the later as NP of the two viruses showed no cross-reactivity using positive control samples (Supplementary Figure  3(B) ).",

In line with these recommendations, most camel serosurveys were conducted using only Sbased assays [3, 8, 9, 11, 13] . In human cases, samples showing neutralizing activity were also NP positive [6, 22] .

The finding of two closely related NeoCoV and PREDICT/PDF-2180 CoV in bats suggested that MERS-CoV descended from an ancestral virus of African bats, while the host switch from bats to dromedary camels likely occurred in Africa years ago [27, 29, 30] . However, there has been no other reported virus spillover from bats to camels beside this ancestral MERS-CoV and 229E-related coronaviruses. Our data demonstrated that the HKU8r-CoV NP antibody is not caused by cross-reactive antibody responses to camel 229E. Our discovery of HKU8r-CoV in camels is, therefore, an important finding. HKU8r-CoV was described first in Hong Kong and later in Kenya, and so far it has only been reported in Miniopterus bat species [23] [24] [25] . Kenyan bats carry multiple CoVs including SARS-related, HKU2-related, HKU7-related, HKU8-related and HKU9-related CoVs that may spillover to other species in rural areas where bats roost in close proximity to humans or are consumed by humans as bush meat [24] .",

The chance of MERS/HKU8r-CoV co-infected camels simultaneously lost both HKU8r-CoV S and MERS-CoV NP antibodies should be low. The presence of a chimeric MERS/HKU8r-CoV would be a possible explanation, although there could be other explanations. For example, camel may generate a different S and NP antibody responses that resulted in a stronger S but weak and short-lasting NP antibody titres. It could also be two separated events of infection by MERS-CoV and HKU8r-CoV instead of a co-infection. Nonetheless, even the occurrence of a chimeric MERS/HKU8r-CoV is not surprising as it is known that CoV genomes regularly undergo recombination during infection as observed in CoVs such as bat SARS-related CoVs [31] . Three CoVs, including MERS-CoV, 229E-like and HKU23-CoV had also been reported to co-circulate in Middle East camels, increased chance of recombination [28] . Yet it is worth noting that recombination between an alpha-CoV (HKU8r-CoV e.g.) and beta-CoV (MERS-CoV e.g.) has never been reported. Our observation should be more supported by molecular evidence in future studies.",

Our Western blot results suggest at least some of the MERS-CoV neutralizing samples did not have NP or M protein antibodies. It is unknown what genetic backbone these viruses will have. For example, viruses may maintain the MERS-CoV backbone and only replace the NP gene with HKU8r-CoV (or unidentified CoVs) or vice versa. In the latter example, these viruses would have a HKU8r-CoV backbone with S gene replaced by the MERS-CoV. With this hypothesis in consideration, the current molecular diagnosis tools for MERS-CoV do not detect other genotype of MERS-CoVs circulating in animals, partially explaining the failure in our attempt to find molecular evidence of novel chimeric CoVs using qPCR targeting MERS-CoV S gene or metagenome NGS. Concerted efforts to identify and sequence these viruses are needed in future studies.",

(B) Luciferase Immunoprecipitation System (LIPS) test for NP antibodies. Eight NP ELISA positive and 12 negative samples (all MERS-CoV RBD positive) were used in the LIPS test. Five RBD and NP ELISA negative samples were used as controls (shown as blue dots), and alpaca anti-serum against MERS-CoV was used as positive controls (red dots). Cutoff was determined as the sum of mean value plus three times the standard deviations of the negative samples. (C) Western blot using whole virus proteins. Lysates of MERS-CoV infected Vero cells were separated on 12% polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and analysed with MERS-CoV RBD positive, NP positive/negative camel serum samples, or NP mAb.
