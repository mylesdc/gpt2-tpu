Using the murine MS model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), we previously demonstrated that antagonism of the chemokine receptor CXCR7 blocks endothelial cell sequestration of CXCL12, thereby enhancing the abluminal localization of CXCR4-expressing leukocytes. CXCR7 antagonism led to decreased parenchymal entry of leukocytes and amelioration of ongoing disease during EAE. Of note, animals that received high doses of CXCR7 antagonist recovered to baseline function, as assessed by standard clinical scoring. Because functional recovery reflects axonal integrity, we utilized diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to evaluate axonal injury in CXCR7 antagonist-versus vehicle-treated mice after recovery from EAE.",

After imaging, spinal cords underwent histological analysis of myelin and oligodendrocytes via staining with luxol fast blue (LFB), and immunofluorescence for myelin basic protein (MBP) and glutathione S-transferase-\u03c0 (GST-\u03c0). Detection of nonphosphorylated neurofilament H (NH-F) was also performed to detect injured axons. Statistical analysis for EAE scores, DTI parameters and non-phosphorylated NH-F immunofluorescence were done by ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post-hoc test. For all statistical analysis a p < 0.05 was considered significant.",

Recent studies also indicate that infiltrating leukocytes may directly induce axonal damage that is reversible and occurs in the absence of demyelination [8] . Disease modifying therapies that limit the formation and extent of inflammatory lesions may therefore provide the best approach for preventing disability.

CXCL12 expression along abluminal surfaces of the CNS vasculature normally localizes infiltrating CXCR4-expressing leukocytes to perivascular spaces, thereby restricting their entry into the CNS [13, 14] . Loss of abluminal CXCL12, which is specific to MS [15] , occurs via cytokine-mediated, upregulation of CXCR7 by CNS endothelial cells [12] . Administration of a specific CXCR7 antagonist led to retention of abluminal CXCL12 expression at the BBB microvasculature, preventing the pathological entry of immune cells into the CNS parenchyma. Animals that received CXCR7 antagonist exhibited a dose-dependent decrease in peak disease severity and amelioration of ongoing disease [12] . In all circumstances, high doses of CXCR7 antagonist also led to complete clinical recovery while vehicle or untreated animals exhibited chronic deficits. The lack of detectable clinical deficits in animals with limited parenchymal entry of immune cells supports the notion that inflammation leads to reversible axonal injury, which can be ameliorated by targeting CXCR7.",

Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has emerged as a powerful and sensitive tool to analyze white matter disease. Specifically, DTI has been utilized to assess axonal damage and demyelination in vivo in both MS and in animal models such as EAE [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . DTI measures the directional diffusivities of water molecules, which reflect the microstructural organization in biological specimens [23, 24] . Radial diffusivity, the diffusion of water perpendicular to the axonal fiber, is associated with myelin integrity and therefore increases during demyelination [22, 25] . Axial diffusivity, which reflects microscopic water movement parallel to the axonal fiber, is decreased with loss of axonal integrity [16, 17, 20, 22] . DTI is therefore suitable for the quantitative assessment of myelin versus axonal injury in preclinical studies evaluating novel targets for the treatment of MS.",

We observed that axial diffusivity within the ventrolateral white matter (VLWM) of mice treated with high doses of CXCR7 antagonist was comparable to na\u00efve mice whereas untreated or vehicle-treated animals showed significant axial diffusivity reduction, suggesting axonal damage. However, we did not observe changes in radial diffusivity between treatment groups, suggesting that CXCR7 antagonism did not impact on levels of myelin during recovery. These results validate the relevance of CXCR7 as a disease modifying molecule not only during the effector phase of EAE, by preventing intraparenchymal leukocyte migration, but also during the recovery phase, by preserving axonal integrity. Moreover, the results also support the use of DTI for assessing the in vivo therapeutic efficacy of treatments for CNS autoimmune diseases.",

Because both loss of myelin and interactions between immune and neuronal cells lead to axonal damage [31, 32] , we wondered whether CXCR7 antagonism might affect the extent of recovery. Mice underwent adoptive transfer of MOG-reactive Th1 cells and were then administered daily injections of saline, vehicle, 5 or 10 mg/kg of CCX771, a specific antagonist of CXCR7 [12] , and monitored for disease progression for a period of 28 days. In order to examine whether limiting inflammatory infiltrates during ongoing disease impacts on recovery, half of the vehicle-treated mice began administration of CCX771 when they attained a clinical score of 1. Consistent with our previous report [12] , CXCR7 antagonism led to a dose dependent decrease in the peak severity of EAE even in mice with established disease ( Figure 1A ). Evaluation of disease severity during the recovery phase, 21 to 28 days post-transfer (blue bracket in Figure 1A ), revealed that CCX771-treated mice exhibited a dose-dependent increase in recovery with significantly lower clinical severity scores than vehicle-or salinetreated control groups (Tables 1 and 2 and Figure 1B ). All animals from both groups exhibited a highest severity score of 2 during the recovery phase, 21 to 28 days post-transfer ( Figure 1B , recovery phase for vehicle and saline SEM = 0). Of interest, animals treated with CCX771 that attained a clinical score of 1 exhibited the same mean severity score upon recovery phase, 21 to 28 days post-transfer (blue bracket in Figure 1A ), as those that began treatment at the time of adoptive transfer, despite a significant difference in their peak clinical disease severities during effector phase, 7 to 21 days post-transfer (red bracket in Figure 1A ). Table 1 : One-way ANOVA effector phase: F = 8.250, P > 0.0004; Table 2 : One-way ANOVA recovery phase: F = 18.45, P < 0.0001). These data suggest that CXCR7 antagonism not only modifies disease severity during EAE but enhances overall recovery regardless of initial impairments, as accessed via clinical scoring.",

Relative anisotropy (RA) maps were generated within the manually defined regions of interest (ROIs) of VLWM ( Figure 2B ). Axon and myelin injury in VLWM, most severe in the control groups, was apparent in EAE mice as evidenced by the intensity changes in radial and axial diffusivity maps ( Figure 2B ). Statistical analysis of changes in radial diffusivity failed to show significant differences in the VLWM among study groups, suggesting no differences in myelin integrity ( Figure 2C , Oneway ANOVA F = 1.696, P = 0.1740). In contrast, analysis of changes in VLWM axial diffusivity detected significant decreases in groups of mice that received low dose CCX771 (5 mg/kg), vehicle or saline versus those that received high dose (10 mg/kg) and na\u00efve mice ( Figure 2D ). Axial diffusivity of 10 mg/kg CCX771-treated mice resembled the values of the na\u00efve group, while 5 mg/kg CCX771-treated mice resembled those obtained from control groups ( Figure 2D , One-way ANOVA F = 3.232, P = 0.0227). Lastly, RA of VLWM showed no difference between vehicle-or saline-treated mice and CCX771-treated mice ( Figure 2E , One-way ANOVA F = 5.272, P = 0.0021). The extent of axonal preservation was assessed according to the axial diffusivity distribution [16] from the na\u00efve spinal cords ( Figure 3A ) to distinguish the injured from the normal appearing VLWM ( Figure 3B ). No differences in the extent of injured VLWM were detected between 10 mg/kg CCX771-treated and na\u00efve mice while 5 mg/kg CCX771-, vehicle-, and saline-treated mice exhibited gradations of injury within the VLWM ( Figure 3C ).",

To answer this question we evaluated the mean clinical score only during the recovery phase, 21 to 28 day postadoptive transfer, as a function of axial diffusivity VLWM and injured VLWM. Both analyses showed a statistically significant linear correlation of clinical score during the recovery phase with axial diffusivity ( Figure 4A was drawn manually on the DTI parameter maps (B). The boundary between white matter and gray matter was identified on relative anisotropy (RA) maps. The clear gray-white matter contrast was seen in RA maps of all study groups. Radial (\u03bb\u22a5) and axial (\u03bb||) diffusivities showed heterogeneous abnormalities within the VLWM, being more severe in saline-and vehicle-treated groups. Analysis of radial diffusivity and relative anisotropy do not show differences between treatment groups, suggesting no differences in myelin integrity (C and E, One-way ANOVA F = 3.232, P = 0.0227 and F = 5.272, P = 0.0021, respectively). Meanwhile, analysis of axial diffusivity shows a similarity between 10 mg/kg CCX771-treated mice with na\u00efve (D, One-way ANOVA, F = 3.232, P = 0.0227). Results are expressed as mean of \u03bb\u22a5, \u03bb|| or RA \u00b1 SD). 23.0, P < 0.0001).

Because we did not observe any differences in measurements of radial diffusivity between treatment groups after disease recovery, we performed luxol fast blue (LFB) staining of spinal cords at lumbar segments L2/3. Consistent with our DTI data, there were no apparent differences between any treatment groups in the VLWM myelin density as detected by this method ( Figure 5A ). Of interest, mice treated with 10 mg/kg CCX771 exhibited myelin-density staining that was comparable to na\u00efve animals ( Figure  5A , upper panels). After 28 days post-adoptive transfer, persistent inflammation was still detectable within the VLWM spinal cords of saline-and vehicle-treated mice and, to some extent, of mice treated with 5 mg/kg CCX771, but not in mice treated with 10 mg/kg CCX771 ( Figure 5A , lower panels versus middle and right upper panels). We also observed pathological features consistent with hypertrophic and degenerating axonal bundles, as reported in human and rodent models of CNS degeneration and trauma ( Figure 5A , lower panels, arrowhead) [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] . However, these features were absent in the na\u00efve and 10 mg/kg CCX771-treated mice, where more normally appearing axons were present ( Figure 5A, mid-upper panel, arrow) .",

All treatment groups exhibited meningeal CD3+ cells, which were increased in numbers in vehicle-and salinetreated mice compared with mice treated with 5 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg CCX771 ( Figure 6A ). Parenchymal infiltration of CD3+ cells was also increased in vehicle-and saline-treated mice compared with mice treated with CCX771, which exhibited few parenchymal CD3+ cells ( Figure 6A ). Quantitative analysis of meningeal and parenchymal CD3+ staining within both the parenchyma and meninges of mice in each treatment group revealed significant differences between the two CNS regions in mice treated with low dose CCX771 (5 mg/kg) and in vehicle-or saline-treated controls but not in mice treated with high dose CCX771 (10 mg/kg) ( Figure 6B , Two-way ANOVA interaction: F = 2.49, DFn = 5, DFd = 118, P = 0.0.347; antagonist treatment: F = 13.52, DFn = 5, DFd = 118, P < 0.0001; area of CNS (parenchyma or meninges): F = 52.86 DFn = 1 DFd = 118, P < 0.0001).

Axial diffusivity measurements of injured spinal cord VLWM in mice treated with CXCR7 antagonist were undistinguishable from those of na\u00efve mice, which were both significantly different from vehicle-and saline-treated mice. Consistent with this, extensive SMI-32+ immunoreactivity within spinal cord VLWM was detected in both salineor vehicle-treated mice but not in tissues obtained from mice treated with CXCR7 antagonist. In contrast, there were no differences in radial diffusivity measurements or extent of LFB staining, MBP+ and GST-\u03c0+ immunoreactivity between groups, suggesting that axonal preservation in the setting of CXCR7 antagonism may be independent of myelin repair. A linear correlation between injured VLWM and mean maximal disease severity scores was observed only during recovery phase, consistent with the notion that immune-mediated axonal damage persists at late stages of EAE in control-treated animals. Consistent with this, we observed significant increases in persistent inflammatory infiltrates within the parenchyma of saline-and vehicle-treated mice that was abrogated with CCX771 administration. These control tissues also exhibited the presence of pathological features consistent with hypertrophic-degenerative axonal bundles [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] , suggesting that axonal damage and not lack of myelin is the key pathology in mice with chronic deficits. These findings support the relevance of CXCR7 antagonist treatment to preserve axonal integrity and indicate that DTI may be used to determine the treatment effects of small molecule inhibitors on pathological biomarkers of CNS autoimmunity.",

Demyelination-dependent mechanisms include ongoing axonal toxicity due to the up-regulation of sodium channels throughout the length of demyelinated axons in MS and EAE. Consistent with this, mice deficient in Na+ channel beta2 subunits exhibit decreased axonal degeneration and loss during EAE compared with wild-type animals, despite similar levels of CNS inflammation [53] . However, myelinated axonal segments continuously exposed to activated macrophages or their products can undergo focal degeneration with associated mitochondrial Table 3 One-way ANOVA comparing CD3+ pixels ratio within parenchyma. dysfunction [8] , suggesting that inflammatory mediators may induce axonal damage without demyelination [8] . Consistent with this, using the Biozzi ABH murine model, Jackson and colleagues demonstrated that axonal pathology is the primary event in relapsing-progressive EAE [54] . These investigators observed axonal loss in the acute phase of disease prior to demyelination with further axonal loss in the absence of chronic inflammation during relapses. In our study, vehicle-treated mice with ongoing disease could attain complete recovery upon initiation of CXCR7 antagonist, suggesting peak disease contains a reversible component. Because all groups exhibited equal levels of radial but not axial diffusivity, this reversibility may be attributed to axonal damage. In our previous work, we demonstrated that CXCR7 antagonism decreased infiltration of immune cells to CNS parenchyma as assessed by both, immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry [12] . Thus, T cell entry is likely to be a primary event that reversibly injures axons. Consistent with this, CD8+ T cells reportedly cause bystander axonal damage in murine cerebellar slice cultures [55] . Another putative mechanism is T cell-mediated axonal dysfunction via microtubule destabilization, which was observed to cause synaptic impairment and accumulation of APP aggregates [56, 57] . Further studies utilizing CXCR7 antagonist are ongoing to address these possible mechanisms.",

Thus, it is possible that CXCR7 antagonism impacts on OPC biology. Although EAE-recovered vehicle-versus CXCR7 antagonist-treated mice exhibit equivalent levels of myelin, as assessed by DTI, LFB staining, MBP and GST-\u03c0 immunohistochemal analyses, detection of new myelin may be better accomplished using non-immune-mediated models of demyelination, such as cuprizone toxicity. Mice fed the copper chelator cuprizone display specific demyelination of the corpus callosum, which exhibits remyelination upon cessation of toxin [59] . Studies examining CXCR7 antagonism in this context may be more conducive for the evaluation of OPCs recruitment and maturation. Alternatively, as CXCR7 antagonism was previously shown to limit demyelination during peak EAE [12] , it is possible that the preserved axonal integrity is due to preservation of myelin.",

Nevertheless, while several studies have demonstrated efficacy for DTI in evaluating in vivo treatment modalities in animal models of CNS injury [63, 64] , this is the first study evaluating a pharmacological inhibitor in a murine model of MS in vivo. Mi et al., showed that treatment of Sprague-Dawley rats with anti-LINGO-1 promotes recovery from MOGinduced EAE, either by intrathecal or systemic delivery [65] . These investigators also correlated EAE amelioration with axonal integrity as assessed by axial diffusivity; however, imaging was performed post-mortem in fixed spinal cord specimens. More recently, DTI has been used successfully in patients for the evaluation of G-CSF treatment for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [66] and anti-tubercular treatment for Tuberculous meningitis [67] , highlighting the feasibility of DTI for evaluating CNS lesions and inflammation.",
