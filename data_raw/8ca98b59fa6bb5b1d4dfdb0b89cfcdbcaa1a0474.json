For sites sampled over multiple years, Cormack-Jolly-Seber models (Cormack 1989) were implemented in the package Rcapture (Baillargeon & Rivest 2007) . For sites sampled in only one year, the Petersen estimator was calculated for sites with two capture occasions and the Schnabel estimator was calculated for sites with more than two capture occasions, both with Chapman correction (Chapman 1951) in the R package FSA (Ogle 2017) ( Table S2 ). Sampling intervals were not consistent between years and across sites, so the same estimator could not be used. Three sites (AMA7, LR2 and LR3) were excluded because roost locations were inaccessible, so sites were sampled around livestock and there were few recaptures. Two other sites (API17 and AYA15) were only sampled using hand nets during the day, making it difficult to account for recapture probability, so colony size was not estimated for those sites. Two datasets were created using the most recent estimates of Nc, as colonies can undergo major changes in Nc over a short number of years (Streicker et al. 2012) . One dataset included all sites where Nc was estimated and another more conservative dataset included only Petersen or Schnabel estimates from 2016-2017 (Table S2 ).",

Two sites (AMA2 and CAJ4) were initially genotyped for larger numbers of individuals than other sites (61 and 88 respectively) but were randomly subsampled to 30 individuals to ensure that unequal sample sizes did not affect other analyses (Puechmaille 2016) . Following subsampling, AMA2 deviated significantly from HWE in the 9 loci dataset while no populations deviated significantly in the 6 loci dataset (Table S5) . Figure S1 . Principal component analysis (PCA) of sites by environmental variables. The PCA was performed with centering and scaling on the variables annual mean temperature, annual precipitation, and annual temperature range. Sites are colored by ecoregion (blue, Coast; green, Andes; purple, Amazon) and circles show the 95% normal probability ellipse for each group. Pairwise correlations between all continuous explanatory variables were examined for potential multi-collinearity. Variables with a correlation coefficient of r>0.5 were excluded from the same model in model averaging. Figure S4 . Vertebrate-infecting viral richness and community composition compared across ecoregions. Plots show comparisons of vertebrate-infecting viruses across ecoregions in saliva (top panels) and feces (lower panels). In boxplots, bold lines show the median, and upper and lower hinges show the first and third quartiles. Whiskers extend from the hinge to 1.5 x the inter-quartile range. In PCoA plots, circles show the 95% normal probability ellipse for each group and stars indicate communities are significantly different as assessed by PERMANOVA. Colors correspond to different ecoregions within Peru (blue, Coast; green, Andes; purple, Amazon). Figure S5 . Correlations between viral community distance and geographic or genetic distance. Plots show saliva virus community Jaccard distances compared with colony geographic distance (km) (Panel A; Mantel r=-0.05; p=0.67) and genetic distance FST calculated using 9 microsatellite loci (Panel B; Mantel r=-0.007; p=0.53), and fecal virus community Jaccard distances correlated with colony geographic distance (km) (Panel C; Mantel r=0.25; p=0.003) and genetic distance FST calculated using 9 microsatellite loci (Panel D; Mantel r=0.13; p=0.03).
