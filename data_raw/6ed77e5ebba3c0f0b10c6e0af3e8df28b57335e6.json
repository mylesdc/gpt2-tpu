Degenerate primers allow for the PCR amplification of a wider range of viral isolates with only one set of pre-mixed primers, thus increasing amplification success rates and minimizing the necessity for genome finishing activities. To successfully select a large set of degenerate PCR primers necessary to tile across an entire viral genome and maximize their success, this process is best performed computationally. Results: We have developed a fully automated degenerate PCR primer design system that plays a key role in the J. Craig Venter Institute's (JCVI) high-throughput viral sequencing pipeline. A consensus viral genome, or a set of consensus segment sequences in the case of a segmented virus, is specified using IUPAC ambiguity codes in the consensus template sequence to represent the allelic diversity of the target population. PCR primer pairs are then selected computationally to produce a minimal amplicon set capable of tiling across the full length of the specified target region. As part of the tiling process, primer pairs are computationally screened to meet the criteria for successful PCR with one of two described amplification protocols. The actual sequencing success rates for designed primers for measles virus, mumps virus, human parainfluenza virus 1 and 3, human respiratory syncytial virus A and B and human metapneumovirus are described, where >90% of designed primer pairs were able to consistently successfully amplify >75% of the isolates.",

For example, a few amino acid changes on the surface protein (hemagglutinin) of the influenza virus are sufficient to evade the host's antibody detection within the time span of a single season [1] . To effectively genotype and monitor the genome of a rapidly evolving and heterogeneous population, it is important to have the capability to amplify the nucleic acid sequences from samples taken from that population as the genotype is shifting. As the viral sequencing projects have increased at JCVI over the past few years, a high-throughput mechanism to rapidly select PCR primers with a high probability of success was necessary. In this paper, we describe the modifications made to our high-throughput primer design pipeline, previously developed for human re-sequencing [2] . We describe the results for 8 out of the 15 viruses that have had PCR primers designed for: measles virus, mumps virus, rubella virus, human parainfluenza virus 1 and 3, human respiratory syncytial virus A and B and human metapneumovirus. PCR primers for the remaining viruses were also successfully designed using the same degenerate primer design pipeline, but were not included in the results and discussion, because a few primers from the entire computationally designed set were modified to suit project specific laboratory PCR requirements. Thus, the utilized primer pairs were not completely true to the algorithm's recommendations. The excluded viruses were human coronavirus, feline coronavirus, canine coronavirus, SARS coronavirus, human adenovirus, human Norwalk virus, and influenza viruses (human influenza A and B, and avian influenza A).",

It is not only important to decide which bases to make degenerate, but also how many and which combinations will lead to successful PCR. The high throughput features of the JCVI's degenerate primer design pipeline that have been inherited from the original non-degenerate version, include dynamic tiling, an overlapping non-fixed amplicon set across the entire target genome, as well as the capability to predict primer pairs that have very high success rates under one of either of two amplification protocols: \"standard\" or \"high GC\". Dynamic tiling allows the selection of an amplicon set to be dependent on the landscape of features on the template. By parameterizing the minimum, maximum, and optimal amplicon overlap and amplicon sizes, the JCVI primer design pipeline crawls across a template based on the last amplicon selected, thus minimizing the number of successful amplicons necessary to cover the genome while only selecting amplicons predicted to be successful. This exhaustive search is not possible with fixed tiling.",

However, since the effect of isolate is confounded inside of the average success rate, to gain a deeper understanding of the success rate of primer pairs across isolates, a graded approach was taken. This was necessary because if a primer pair was successful at a low percentage across all samples, then it was possible that the primers did not match the genotype of the isolate, rather than a poorly selected primer pair based on the primer design algorithm alone. For each primer pair and isolate, sequencing was performed in both the forward and reverse directions. If a sequence was recovered for an isolate and primer pair (under standard expectations of high quality values, length, etc.) then that sequencing direction was considered a success. Success rates were tallied for forward, reverse, and then averaged between both sequencing directions. These per primer pair success rates were then graded at cutoffs of greater than 25, 50, 75, 85 and 90 percent of isolates. (See Table 2 ) This cumulative and graded approach was necessary to distinguish between amplification failures that were either isolate or target region specific. Note that these are actual, not predicted, success rates calculated based on laboratory experiments, not predicted success rates based on in silico computations. Furthermore, because of the fairly uniform amplicon coverage across all genomes, e.g., Figure 3 , the reported success rates should not be inflated by any redundant stacking of amplicons over easy-toamplify loci. Table 2 contains the forward, reverse, and average success rates for each viral consensus sequence. For each directional set of statistics, the sequencing success rate was computed across all isolates. For example, for HRSV-A, 94% of all primers designed had greater than 75% of the isolates successfully sequenced.",

Unlike using standard, i.e. non-degenerate, primers where the analyst must assume that the primers are binding to conserved regions surrounding the target, the necessity of degenerate primers presumes that the target population is sufficiently heterogeneous such that there are insufficient conserved regions to allow standard primers to successfully bind and amplify all samples from the population. Degenerate primer design allows for a mixed population of primer pairs to be simultaneously available during the PCR reaction, thus increasing the likelihood of successfully targeting an unknown sample from a heterogeneous population. A properly designed consensus sequence, or set of consensus sequences, will represent this heterogeneous population, maximizing the likelihood of attaining PCR products for all samples, while at the same time, minimizing the potential for alternative products. The number of alternative products may exhibit a quadratic relationship with the number of unique primer sequences involved in the PCR. Thus, it is a goal to minimize the number of degenerate bases in each primer sequence, while maximizing the proportion of the target population the primers specifically bind to. The end effect is to limit the number of degenerate bases per primer to no more than 4, but preferably less than 3 bases.",

When filtering is applied, the analyst assumes that not all point mutations represented in the set of sequences acquired from the population are equally important. Some polymorphisms may be due to sequencing error, while others may only represent an insignificant subpopulation. Given a MSA constructed from a set of sequences determined to be a reasonable representation of the population, ANDES computes the distribution of nucleotides for each position. A nominal filter or percentage filter can be applied to remove the presence of alleles that are not represented at or above a userspecified frequency or percentage threshold, respectively. For example, the degenerate base W is required if both the alleles A and T exist in the population for a specific position. However if 2% of the samples are A's, and 98% are T's, applying a 4% percentage filter would change the W to the non-degenerate base, T, if the analyst believes that this polymorphism was actually due to sequencing error. Alternatively, a statistical filter, combining both frequency and percentage, may be applied. This utilizes the binomial distribution to determine whether an allele would be detected upon resampling to the same depth based on a user-specified confidence, i.e. alpha. Lastly, an optimization-based filter is also available, in which the analyst specifies the maximum percentage of degenerate bases to be allowed in the consensus sequences, and the algorithm iteratively removes alleles starting with the ones with the lowest proportion across the samples, until the maximum percentage of degenerate bases have been achieved. If these filtering techniques either remove alleles that need to be targeted, or do not reduce the number of degenerate bases in the constructed consensus sequence sufficiently, then sample stratification will be necessary.",

This stratification, i.e. clustering, can be performed with ANDES. Given a MSA, ANDES can be used to compute a distance matrix and dendrogram, based on sequence similarity, which can then be used to generate clusters given a user-specified cutoff. The maximum intra-cluster percent dissimilarity cutoff that works well is approximately 10%. When the percent similarity within a cluster (or undivided set of sequences) falls below 90%, the number of degenerate bases that must be introduced into the consensus sequence becomes too high.
