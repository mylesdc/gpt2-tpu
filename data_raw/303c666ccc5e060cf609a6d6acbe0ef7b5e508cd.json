            "text": "Regulatory interactions between miRNA and other noncoding RNAs, including long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA), and circular RNA (circRNA) are now known to determine the cellular functional status and phenotype. MicroRNAs use seed sequences (6-8 bases long) to bind microRNA Response Elements (MREs) located on their interacting partners, primarily at the 3'UTR of coding transcripts [4] . However, it is possible that the frequency of MREs in the entire transcriptome of a given cell contributes to the dynamic gene regulatory process by acting as a sponge for mature miRNAs, thus regulating their functional availability. Thus, the coding and noncoding transcripts sharing common MRE sites compete with each other and define the gene expression profile of a given cell. These competing transcripts are collectively called competing endogenous RNAs [5] . Thus, gene expression regulation is a complex process involving the dynamic interactions between miRNA-mRNA-lncRNA-circRNA. This complexity is increased multifold when these interacting partners are exchanged between cells via extracellular vesicles. Recognizing this intricate system will significantly aid in our understanding of the health and disease process. We are beginning to study disease pathogenesis at the cellular, organ, and whole body levels; and the gut microbiota is increasingly recognized as a crucial player [6] . It is time to acknowledge each of these players as they take center stage in maintaining homeostasis and the normal physiological functioning of an organism.",

            "text": "There are still significant gaps in understanding the complex regulatory mechanisms of miRNAs; however, the field is advancing rapidly. Further, it has been shown that a number of nuclear receptors are involved in the transcriptional regulation of miRNA expression, including the small heterodimer partner (SHP) and farnesoid X receptor (FXR). In general, miRNAs are detected as (i) extracellular circulating miRNA bound to different lipoproteins; (ii) part of a non-membrane ribonucleoprotein complex associated with Argonaut proteins; and (iii) contained in exosomes as extracellular vesicles, where they act as nano-sized transporters involved in the communication between neighboring cells. The recent finding that miRNAs are also transported from one cell to another via tunneling nanotubes underscores their importance in maintaining communication among all cell types, including those associated with cancer.",

However, we begin with a research article by Liu et al. who reported for the first time the existence of complemented palindromic small RNAs (cpsRNAs) from SARS coronavirus, and propose that cpsRNAs and palindromic small RNAs (psRNAs) constitute a novel class of small RNAs [7] . Such a discovery of cpsRNAs could pave a way to find novel markers for pathogen detection and to reveal the mechanisms underlying infection or pathogenesis from a different perspective. In a study titled, \"A Two-Cohort RNA-seq Study Reveals Changes in Endometrial and Blood miRNome in Fertile and Infertile Women\", Rekker et al. compared mid-secretory phase samples between fertile and infertile women [8] . The study revealed 21 differentially expressed miRNAs from the endometrium and one from blood samples. Among the novel miRNAs, chr2_4401 was validated and showed upregulation in the mid-secretory endometrium. In addition to the novel findings, the authors confirmed the involvement of miR-30 and miR-200 family members in mid-secretory endometrial functions. Hueso et al. elegantly showed in their article that an exonic switch regulates the differential accession of microRNAs to the Cd34 transcript in atherosclerosis progression [9] . Further, they proposed a new mechanism of miRNA action, linked to a cryptic splicing site in the target-host gene, that would regulate the differential accession of miRNAs to their cognate binding sites.",

Their results showed that miR-106a-5p was elevated in aged muscles and dexamethasone (DEX)-treated myotubes. The up-regulation of miR-106a-5p significantly reduced the diameters of myotubes accompanied by increased levels of muscular atrophy genes and decreased PI3K/AKT activities. Finally, miR-106a-5p was demonstrated to directly bind to the 3'-UTR of PIK3R1, thus, repressing PI3K/AKT signaling. The microbiome appears to interact and perhaps influence an unlimited number of metabolic processes in health and disease. In their article, Yuan et al. postulate that the altered nutrient composition and miRNA expression in colorectal cancer (CRC) microenvironment selectively exerts pressure on the surrounding microbiota, leading to alterations in its composition [11] . Further, the authors present a detailed overview of the current understanding of the role of miRNAs in mediating host-microbiota interactions in CRC. \"Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms in MIR143 Contribute to Protection Against Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) in Caucasian Populations\" by Bradshaw et al. is first to report a correlation between miRSNPs in miR-143 and a reduced risk of NHL in Caucasians [12] . Further, it is supported by significant SNPs in high linkage disequilibrium (LD) in a large European NHL genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis. Axmann et al. compared the miRNA profiles in serum and lipoprotein particles of healthy individuals with those of patients with uremia [13] . They observed a significant increase in levels of cellular miRNA level using reconstituted high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles artificially loaded with miRNA, whereas incubation with native HDL particles yielded no measurable effect. Based on the results, the authors concluded that there was no relevant effect of lipoprotein-particle-mediated miRNA-transfer under in vivo conditions though the miRNA profile of lipoprotein particles can be used as a diagnostic marker.",

The comprehensive analyses of mRNA, miRNA, and matrisome proteomic profiles in IPF and SSc lung fibroblasts revealed robust fibrotic signatures at both the gene and protein expression levels and identified novel fibrogenesis-associated miRNAs whose aberrant downregulation in disease fibroblasts likely contributes to their fibrotic and ECM gene expression.

            "text": "As FDA-approved small RNA drugs begin to enter the arena of clinical medicine, it is critical to expand both preclinical and clinical research studies for miRNAs. A growing number of reports suggest a significant utility of miRNAs as biomarkers for pathogenic conditions, modulators of drug resistance, and/or as drugs for medical intervention in almost all human health conditions. The pleiotropic nature of this class of nonprotein-coding RNAs makes them particularly attractive drug targets for diseases with a multifactorial origin and few, if any, available treatments. The landscape of both diagnostic and interventional medicine will arguably continue to evolve as candidate miRNAs pass successfully through phase 2 and 3 clinical trials. In this special issue of Genes, we provide a series of articles that highlight microRNAs as diagnostic, predictive and therapeutic agents for human disease. The development of bioinformatics programs to identify miRNA-binding sites in target genes and their corresponding biological pathways, along with an expanding platform of in vitro and in vivo preclinical research models, has propelled miRNAs into clinical medicine. The first siRNA human trial was conducted in 2004 and, in 2018, the first siRNA drug was approved, paving the way for a class of miRNA transcripts whose active investigation began only a little more than 15 years ago. The future of human miRNA clinical trials is absolutely guaranteed and that time has arrived.",
