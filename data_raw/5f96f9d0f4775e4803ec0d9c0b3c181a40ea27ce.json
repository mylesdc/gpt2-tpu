So far, we have only made statements about how the elasticities change with a, but it turns out that the elasticities depend only on the quotient a/b. In other words, they are homogeneous functions of degree 0 of a and b. This fact can be verified by determining from equation (S7) that the partial derivatives in the elasticities are homogeneous functions of degree -2. Thus our previous statements about how the elasticities change as a increases (while b is held constant) can be converted directly into statements about how the elasticities change as b decreases (while a is held constant).",

The weights are S(t) and are shared by the dividend and divisor. As with e q,a , the area in the dividend is the area under the hazard curve and the area in the divisor is that of a rectangle. As a grows large, S declines rapidly with t and thus only the areas with t near 0 make a substantial contribution to the averages. Since \u03bb from 0 to t approaches a straight line as t \u2192 0, e E(T ),a approaches the average area of triangles divided by the average areas of corresponding rectangles, which is 1/2. As t increases, as explained previously the areas under the hazard function becomes more rectangular with a rate of convergence determined by p. Thus e E(T ),a is an increasing function of a and asymptotically approaches \u22121 as a \u2192 0. Recall that we found the same limits and monotonicity for e q,a . We can in fact go on to show that all of the limits and monotonicity results found for elasticities of the quantiles apply to elasticities of the mean. Recall that these results were consequences of the limits and monotonicity of e q,a as a function of a and that q(a, b) was a homogeneous function of degree -1. To see that E(T ) as a function of a and b is homogeneous of degree -1, consider that \u221e 0 S(t, ax, bx) dt = \u221e 0 S(t/x, ax, bx) dt/x = \u221e 0 S(t, a, b) dt/x = E(T )/x.

Then e q,a jumps away from -1 toward zero and relaxes back toward -1 as a further decreases. Note that the q(a, t \u22121 1 ) is a homogeneous function of degree -1, so e q,t \u22121 1 = \u22121 \u2212 e q,a . So the comparable transformation to multiplying b in the linear model by x is to divide t 1 in the step model by x. If that is done and a is multiplied by x, in both cases the quantiles will be divided by x.

To compare bifurcation delay in simulations with each type of transmission, we created a frequency-dependent transmission model by having the rate of transmission events be equal to \u03b2XY /N instead of \u03b2XY and keeping the equations for all of the other rates identical to those of table 1 in the main text.",

We created two partitioning schemes: the first used the life history parameters initial population size (N 0 ), infectious interval (reciprocal of the recovery rate, \u03b3), linear rate of increase in the transmission rate (\u03b1), and the spontaneous rate of infection from outside the population (\u03be). The second used the expected sparking rate, a = \u03beN 0 , and the expected sweep rate, b = \u03b1N 0 /(\u03b3 + \u00b5), where \u00b5 is the host birth and death rate. Each partition tree was pruned by removing uninformative partitions, as identified by cross validation plots [4] . We present here the pruned partitioning trees for each approach, as well as an estimate of the explained variance. Figure S2 : Mean bifurcation delay (in years, +/-SE) in stochastic simulations assuming frequency-dependent disease transmission (y-axis) is similar to mean bifurcation delay in density-dependent transmission models (x-axis). Each point represents a unique, matched combination of life history parameters; thus, points on the solid, diagonal line 1:1 line indicate identical mean delay in simulations assuming each transmission model. Symbol colours represent levels of the sparking rate, a. The mean delay was < 10 years for most of the parameters tested, which fall into the gray shaded rectangle. The lower panel is the same data but with axes adjusted to zoom in on the shaded rectangle in the upper panel. Departures from the 1:1 line show that mean delay is generally lower with frequency-dependent than with density-dependent transmission. Figure S3 : Recursive partitioning of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, representing the amount of information lost (in bits) when approximating the analytic distribution of bifurcation delay with that of the stochastic simulations. Each node of the partition tree has a label identifying the split, or inequality, implemented at that level, the sample size of observations, and the mean KL divergence at that level; branches extending to the left of each node satisfy the inequality (i.e. \"yes\"), those to the right do not (\"no\"). Thus, the first node in panel a gives the mean KL divergence (0.085 bits) of all 7200 simulations. Further nodes and branches detail the life history parameter combinations that give rise to the greatest KL divergence. \"interval\" refers to the infectious period of the simulated pathogen (in days), and is the reciprocal of the recovery rate, gamma. \"xi\" is the spontaneous rate of infection from outside the population, and \"N\" is the initial population size. Panel a shows the recursive partitioning tree based on life history parameters N, gamma, alpha, and xi (denoted N 0 , \u03b3, \u03b1, and \u03be in-text), which explains 66.7% of variance in KL divergence. Panel b shows the tree based on the sparking and sweep rates, which explains 78% of variance in KL divergence.",
