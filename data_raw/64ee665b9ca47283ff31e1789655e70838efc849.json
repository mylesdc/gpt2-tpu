            "text": "Influenza is a common, highly contagious respiratory virus which infects all age groups, causing a range of outcomes from asymptomatic infection and mild respiratory disease to severe respiratory disease and death. 1 If infected, the adaptive immune system produces a humoral (antibody) and cell-mediated (T cell) immune response to fight the infection. 2 Influenza viruses continually evolve through antigenic drift, resulting in slightly different 'seasonal' influenza strains circulating each year. Population-level antibody immunity to these seasonal viruses builds up over time, so in any given season only a proportion of the population is susceptible to the circulating strains. Occasionally, influenza A viruses evolve rapidly through antigenic shift by swapping genes with influenza viruses usually circulating in animals. This process creates an immunologically distinct virus to which the population may have little to no antibody immunity. The virus can result in a pandemic if a large portion of the population is susceptible and the virus is easily spread. 1 International influenza surveillance is typically based upon cases seeking medical care. [3] [4] [5] However, this focus greatly underestimates the true community burden of seasonal influenza: the majority of cases are mild and self-limiting, with asymptomatic infections accounting for 25% to 75% of all infections. 6, 7 Effective influenza control requires knowledge of disease burden and factors affecting influenza transmission. Existing parameters for mathematical models of influenza interventions are largely derived from household cohort studies conducted in the USA between 1948 and 1981. [8] [9] [10] Since then there have been profound social changes affecting population contact and mixing patterns that are likely to impact on influenza transmission. These changes include more women working, more children attending day care, more commuting and international travel and increased vaccine coverage. Evolutionary changes to circulating viruses may affect transmission dynamics, patterns of clinical illness and the adaptive immune responses elicited. 1, 11 Rapid advances in laboratory methods have also occurred, providing unique opportunities to investigate immune correlates, both humoral and T cell based, with influenza infection rates and disease severity. 11, 12 The initial Flu Watch cohort, funded by the UK Medical Research Council (MRC), began in 2006 as a collaboration between epidemiologists at the Centre for Infectious Disease Epidemiology at University College London (UCL), virologists and mathematical modellers from the Health Protection Agency (HPA, now Public Health England), immunologists at the MRC Human Immunology Unit at Oxford University and the MRC General Practice Research Framework (GPRF). It aimed to estimate community burden of influenza and influenza-like illness, generate up-to-date knowledge of demographic, social and behavioural factors affecting influenza transmission, measure antibody and T cell immune responses to influenza and to use knowledge generated to inform modelling parameters. In addition, a pandemic preparedness cohort was envisioned, in which participants already familiar with the study consented to be re-contacted in the event of a pandemic, to allow rapid redeployment of the study.",

For the T cell cohort, continuing participants used the spring blood sample from season 3 as a baseline sample. They also gave a pre-vaccination blood sample to allow distinction of antibody rises caused by infection rather than vaccination. This was particularly important for the winter wave of the pandemic, as we anticipated widespread vaccination. The Serology cohort was identical but lacked T cell samples.

Approximately 25% of infections were PCR confirmed and only 17% of people with PCR-confirmed disease sought medical attention; Figure 2 indicates how the primary care-based surveillance underestimated the burden of infection in the community.

It is the first modernday household study of influenza transmission in a temperate climate, comparable to the landmark Tecumseh studies of the 1960s and 70s. 22 A major strength is the inclusion of different household types (rather than just households with children, as in earlier studies) which allows influenza infections to be explored across the whole of society. We used highly active methods of surveillance for influenza and other respiratory 23 or from populations with high vaccination rates which greatly limits interpretation (1968 H3N2 pandemic). 22 Historical data on laboratory-confirmed rates of seasonal influenza mainly come from historical community studies of families in the USA between 1948 and 1981. 10, 22, 24, 25 Flu Watch is a good example of collaboration between disciplines (epidemiology, immunology, virology and primary care) and partners. The study provides a rich source of data on social, behavioural and biological factors affecting influenza transmission, enabling exploration of many research questions. Limitations include delays in obtaining funding, ethics and R&D approval across multiple sites, resulting in delayed recruitment during the pandemic and fewer participants overall. Although the initial response to invitation letters was low, it is unclear if this would bias results. Ideally, cohorts would have had pre-and post-influenza season bleeds, but recruitment periods were not perfectly streamlined with influenza seasons so adjustments for bleed timings were made during analysis. The study design and data collection methods evolved in response to experience and changing questions. Whereas this optimized and streamlined methods, it also increased complexity of data management.",
