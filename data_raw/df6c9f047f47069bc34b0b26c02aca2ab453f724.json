            "text": "The inflammatory cytokine IL-6 has been shown to induce the nuclear translocation of androgen receptors in prostate cancer cells and to activate the androgen receptors in a ligand-independent manner, suggesting it may contribute to the development of a castrate-resistant phenotype. Elevated IL-6 serum levels have also been associated with metastasis-related morbidity in prostate cancer patients. We have previously established that over-expression of I-kappa-B-kinase-epsilon (IKK\u03b5 also named IKKi or I\u03baBK\u03b5) in hormone-sensitive prostate cancer cell lines induces IL-6 secretion. We have also reported that prostate cancer cell lines lacking androgen receptor expression exhibit high constitutive IKK\u03b5 expression and IL-6 secretion. In the present study, we validated the impact of IKK\u03b5 depletion on the in vitro proliferation of castrate-resistant prostate cancer cells, and characterized how IKK\u03b5 depletion affects tumor growth and IL-6 tumor secretion in vivo through a mouse xenograft-based approach. We observed a significant growth delay in IKK\u03b5silenced PC-3 cells injected in SCID mice fed with a doxycycline-supplemented diet in comparison with mice fed with a normal diet. We also found a decrease in IL-6 secretion levels that strongly correlated with tumor growth inhibition. Finally, using constructs with various IL-6-mutated promoters, we demonstrated that IKK\u03b5 overexpression induces a NF-\u03baB-independent stimulation of the IL-6 gene promoter through the activation and nuclear accumulation of the transcription factor C/ EBP-\u03b2. Our study demonstrates the pro-proliferative role of the oncogene IKK\u03b5 in castrate-resistant prostate cancer cell lines, involving the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of C/EBP-\u03b2 that initiates IL-6 gene expression.",

Among other events, inflammation is controlled by cytokine and chemokine release [2, 3] . In the tumor microenvironment, tumor-infiltrating immune cells and tumor cells themselves secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines [4] . Significantly elevated levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 have been observed in the serum of patients with castrate-resistant (CR) disease compared to patients with hormone-sensitive (HS) PC and high IL-6 expression (more than 7 pg/ml) is associated with PC progression and Research Paper poor prognosis [5, 6] . There is also evidence suggesting that IL-6 has a growth-promoting role in PC by acting as a positive growth factor for most PC cells [7] . Moreover, IL-6 has been shown to induce transcription of the androgen-receptor (AR) gene, and to activate the AR in a ligand-independent manner [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . These observations support the hypothesis that IL-6 acts as a key mediator of PC progression, particularly in the transition from HS PC cells to a CR state.",

IKK\u03b5 is traditionally linked with an inflammatory response and more specifically with the rheumatoid arthritis inflammation phenotype [14] . IKK\u03b5, together with the ubiquitous protein Tank Binding Kinase 1 (TBK1), forms a cytosolic heterodimer involved in Toll-Like Receptor 3 (TLR3)-and TLR4mediated interferon production [15, 16] . Previously, we demonstrated that NF-\u03baB is an important mediator of IKK\u03b5 expression in PC [17] . Our research also revealed that CR PC cells exhibit high constitutive IKK\u03b5 expression as compared to HS PC cells [17] . Moreover, IKK\u03b5 overexpression in HS 22Rv1 and LNCaP cell lines induces the secretion of IL-6, and IKK\u03b5 knockdown in CR PC-3 cells correlates with a significant decrease in their constitutive IL-6 secretion [18] . Subsequently, high levels of IKK\u03b5 were observed in 30% of primary human breast cancers, suggesting oncogenic properties for this protein [19, 20] . IKK\u03b5 deregulation has also been associated with the progression of ovarian cancers [21] . Recently, we studied the biological link between IKK\u03b5 expression and PC progression in vivo using immunohistochemistry staining on a formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded primary PC tissue microarray [22] . We identified an increased IKK\u03b5 expression during PC progression, when comparing non-malignant tissues to PC. Higher levels of IKK\u03b5 expression in tumors correlated with the development of bone metastases and progression to CR PC in patients.",

IL-6 siRNA efficiency was validated by ELISA; IL-6 secretion in supernatants from PC-3 cell culture was quantified five days after transfection with three different IL-6 siRNAs or control siRNA (siGlo Green Transfection Indicator from Dharmacon) ( Figure 1A ).

Five days after transfection, growth of PC-3 cells in serumfree medium was also significantly reduced by each IL-6 siRNA [from 12% with IL-6 siRNA-II (P = 0.034, t-test) to 37% with IL-6 siRNA-III (P < 0.001, t-test)] compared to siGlo ( Figure 1B ).",

We noted that IKK\u03b5 expression in unstimulated PC3-6TR-shIKK\u03b5 clones was slightly lower than the expression observed in PC3-6TR-shLacZ clones. This observation suggests that our inducible system was partially leaky. We observed a 50% decrease (P = 0.01, paired t-test) in IL-6 secretion after a complete knock-down of IKK\u03b5 expression in PC3-6TR-shIKK\u03b5 cells that were cultured for three days in doxycycline-supplemented media ( Figure 1D ). Knock-down of IKK\u03b5 expression also induced a decrease in PC3-6TR-shIKK\u03b5 cell proliferation in vitro, particularly after five days of culture (P = 0.009, paired t-test; Figure 1E and 1F). This effect was completely abrogated when exogenous IL-6 was added in the culture media (Supplementary Figure S1) .",

Each cohort was randomly subdivided into two groups one week prior to injection and fed either a normal diet or a doxycycline-supplemented diet (dox-diet). We observed a significant delay in the growth of the PC3-6TR-shIKK\u03b5 tumors depleted for IKK\u03b5 expression by the dox-diet ( Figure 2B -Dox) as compared to the PC3-6TR-shIKK\u03b5 tumors in mice on a normal diet ( Figure 2B -Normal) or to the control PC3-6TR-shLacZ tumors (Figure 2A ; Normal and Dox-diet). Immunohistochemistry staining of xenografts using anti-IKK\u03b5 antibody confirmed the efficiency of the diet-dependent IKK\u03b5 knock-down knock-down on PC-3 proliferation. 60 000 PC-3 cells were cultured in low serum conditions in 12-well plates and transfected with control siRNA (si-Glo) or three different IL-6 siRNAs (5 \u03bcM). Five days after transfection, IL-6 secretion was quantified by ELISA (A) and live cells were quantified by trypan blue (B). (C) Characterization of IKK\u03b5 expression in four independent PC3-6TR clones. Cells were grown in the presence or absence of doxycycline (50 ng/ml) for 40 hr. Whole cell extracts from PC3-6TR-shLacZ and PC3-6TR-shIKK\u03b5 stable clones were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto PVDF membranes and probed with anti-IKK\u03b5 antibody. Equal loading was tested with an anti-beta-actin antibody. (D) Influence of IKK\u03b5 expression on IL-6 secretion in stable, inducible PC3-6TR-shLacZ/shIKK\u03b5 clones. IL-6 secretion was measured using ELISA performed on supernatants following 40 hr of culture with (black box) and without (gray box) doxycycline (Dox).

Notably, we observed a strong correlation between the levels of IKK\u03b5 expression and the amount of IL-6 secretion in 22Rv1-6TR-pTrexIKK\u03b5 clones (Supplementary Figure S2) . We selected the 22Rv1-6TR-pTrexIKK\u03b5 clones 1 and 6 for further studies. Using the p1200IL6-CAT vector (1200 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site cloned in front of the CAT gene [28] ), we followed IL-6 promoter activity in our CR and HS PC cell models by CAT ELISA (Figure 3 ). We found that depletion of IKK\u03b5 in CR PC-3 cells induced a significant decrease in IL-6 promoter stimulation ( Figure  3A , P < 0.001, t-test). We also observed that IKK\u03b5 overexpression in 22Rv1 cells led to strong IL-6 promoter activity ( Figure 3B ). As NF-\u03baB is the major regulator of IL-6 gene expression [28, 29] , we studied the effect of NF-\u03baB inhibition on the IL-6 promoter by the transient transfection of the pCMV-I\u03baB\u03b1dn construct in addition to IKK\u03b5 knock-down/over-expression. The I\u03baB\u03b1dn is a dominant negative form of the NF-\u03baB inhibitor, I\u03baB\u03b1, which cannot be phosphorylated and thereby inhibits the activation of NF-\u03baB. As a control for this experiment, we used the pCMV-GFP plasmid. We found that IKK\u03b5dependent regulation of the IL-6 promoter did not involve the activation of NF-\u03baB ( Figure 3A and 3B). In particular, the effect of IKK\u03b5 over-expression on IL-6 promoter stimulation was unaffected by the inhibition of NF-\u03baB activity by I\u03baB\u03b1dn in 22Rv1-6TR-pTrexIKK\u03b5 cells ( Figure 3B ). We also observed that inhibition of NF-\u03baB using I\u03baB\u03b1dn resulted in a greater decrease in IL-6 promoter activity than IKK\u03b5 depletion alone in PC-3 cells ( Figure 3A) .",

            "text": "Therefore, IL-6 promoter activation via IKK\u03b5 requires other transcription factors (TFs) than NF-\u03baB in PC. Presently, only 4 TFs have been reported to control the IL-6 promoter activity: NF-\u03baB, C/EBP-\u03b2, CREB and AP1. The consensus binding sites for these TFs are well characterized [30, 31] . Using the bioinformatics software TESS (Transcription Element Search System from the Computational Biology and Informatics Laboratory, University of Pennsylvania), we localized the principal consensus binding sites for these four TFs in the IL-6 promoter region (Genebank NM_000600.3) ( Figure 3C ). Three truncated IL-6 promoter constructs (pdel129-CAT, pdel56-CAT, p+16-CAT, Figure 3C ) [28] were used in transient transfection assays to identify promoter regions that contain regulatory sites associated with IKK\u03b5-dependent IL-6 gene expression. Even if the loss of the -1200 to -129 region dramatically affected the IL-6 promoter activity in PC3-6TR-shIKK\u03b5 (and in its shLacZ control, Figure 3D and 3E), the effect of IKK\u03b5 www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget were injected into the left flank of six-week-old male SCID mice fed a normal diet (Normal) or 625 mg/kg doxycycline-supplemented diet (Dox). Tumor size was monitored twice a week. Mice were sacrificed and tumors were collected at 135 days after injection or when the tumor volume reached 2,500 mm 3 . Anti-IKK\u03b5 immunohistochemical staining (C) was performed on paraffin sections prepared from PC3-6TR-shLacZ (i-ii) and PC3-6TR-shIKK\u03b5 (iii-iv) resected xenografts taken from mice fed normal (i and iii) or doxycycline-supplemented diet (ii and iv). The Kaplan-Meyer curve represents the overall survival of mice injected with PC3-6TR-shLacZ (D) and PC3-6TR-shIKK\u03b5 (E) cells. At the last time-point, intratumoral liquids were collected to measure: IL-6 secretion by ELISA (F), the percentage of mice with intratumoral liquids (G), and tumor weight (H). Error bars represent the standard error of the mean. \"n\" indicates number of mice in each group. *P < 0.05 (paired t-test). depletion on the constitutive activation of IL-6 promoter was only observed using the p1200IL6-CAT (P = 0.031, paired t-test) and pdel129-CAT constructs (P = 0.01, paired t-test). In 22Rv1-6TR-pTrexIKK\u03b5 cells, we noted a significant increase of IL-6 promoter activity in response to IKK\u03b5 expression using the p1200IL6-CAT and pdel129-CAT constructs (P = 0.031 and P = 0.003 respectively, paired t-test). We also observed a strong activation of the IL-6 promoter using the pdel56-CAT plasmid, but this activation seemed IKK\u03b5-independent. The promoter region between -129 and -56 contains two major consensus TF binding sites, one for C/EBP-\u03b2 and one for CREB, but no NF-\u03baB binding site ( Figure 3C ). In the 22Rv1-6TR-pTrexLacZ cells, doxycycline stimulation did not induce any activity in all promoter regions studied ( Figure 3F ). We also noted that the construct with the very proximal region of the promoter (-56 to +1) containing C/EBP-\u03b2 and NF-\u03baB binding sites appeared to be constitutively active in 22Rv1-6TR-pTrexIKK\u03b5 cells and their 22Rv1-6TR-pTrexLacZ controls.",

In line with our previous results [18] , depletion of IKK\u03b5 expression resulted in a substantial decrease (> 50%) in IL-6 secretion by PC-3 cells ( Figure 1D ) and a decrease in cell proliferation in vitro ( Figure 1F ). This inhibitory effect of IKK\u03b5 knock-down on cell proliferation has previously been observed in vitro in HeLa, ovarian and breast cancer cells [19, 21, 46] . We also showed the impact of IKK\u03b5 depletion in vivo via PC-3 tumor formation and growth in SCID mice ( Figure 2 ). In particular, 135 days after PC-3 cell injection, we observed that 35% of mice injected with IKK\u03b5 depleted cells displayed a complete arrest of tumor growth and even a reduction in tumor mass ( Figure 2E, 2H) . These observations were in line with recent studies in which the authors showed that intratumoral delivery of synthetic IKK\u03b5 siRNA interfered with subcutaneous glioma growth in Nude mice [47] , and that treatment with TBK1/IKK\u03b5 inhibitors significantly impaired development of human squamous cell carcinoma in these mice [27] . Together, these studies suggest a more general role for IKK\u03b5 in cancer.",

We analyzed these intratumoral liquids and recovered a very high concentration of IL-6 (PC3-6TR-shLacZ normal diet: 13 ng/ml; PC3-6TR-shLacZ dox-diet: 16.3 ng/ ml; PC3-6TR-shIKK\u03b5 normal diet: 5.8 ng/ml) and IL-8 (218 ng/ml; 257 ng/ml; 163 ng/ml respectively). To our knowledge, formation of inflammatory fluid pockets around subcutaneous xenografts has never been reported before for wild-type PC-3 xenografts. The appearance of this fluid pocket could be in response to the high level of inflammatory cytokine secretion in PC3-6TR-shLaZ/ shIKK\u03b5 clones as previously described in vitro [18] . Seventy percent of PC3-6TR-shIKK\u03b5 tumors in mice fed a dox-diet presented a similar pocket with an average concentration of IL-6 and IL-8 (4 ng/ml and 118 ng/ml respectively) that was significantly lower. The remaining tumors (30%), which did not form an inflammatory fluid pocket, completely stopped growing. This is in line with the fact that in PC cell lines, IL-6 stimulates cell growth in an autocrine and paracrine manner and is involved in PC development and progression [12, 43, 48, 49] . To confirm the impact of IKK\u03b5-depletion, not only on the intratumoral cytokine secretion but also on tumor growth, we weighed each individual xenograft during necropsies and observed a large reduction in tumor mass when IKK\u03b5 was depleted ( Figure 2H ). We conclude from these experiments that IKK\u03b5 has a pro-proliferative role in the CR PC-3 cell line, and this role is in part, due to the activation of IL-6 expression.",

            "text": "To investigate which TF is responsible for IKK\u03b5dependent IL-6 promoter induction, we took advantage of the IL-6 promoter constructs already generated by Sanceau et al. [28] to characterize the activity of the proximal IL-6 promoter region. Using these constructs, we confirmed the major role of NF-\u03baB on the constitutive activation of the IL-6 promoter in PC-3 cells ( Figure 3A ) but we showed that the IKK\u03b5-dependent IL-6 promoter activity, particularly in 22Rv1 cells, is NF-\u03baB-independent ( Figure 3A and Figure 1B , Figure 4F ). As NF-\u03baB alone is unable to fully activate IL-6 gene transcription, and requires additional TFs to induce complete activation [50, 51] , we analyzed the 1200 bp promoter region for the presence of TF binding sites using TESS. Notably, this bioinformatics software did not identify a consensus IRF-3/-7 regulatory sequence in this promoter region, confirming our previous results which showed that IKK\u03b5dependent IL-6 secretion does not involve IRF-3 or IRF-7 activation [18] . We found that the deletion of the -1200 to -129 region reduces IL-6 promoter activity but only the deletion of the -129 to -56 region completely abolished IKK\u03b5-dependent induction of the IL-6 promoter in both cell lines studied (Figure 3 ). Subsequently, we concentrated our study on the -129 to -56 region, which contains two consensus TF binding sites, one for CREB and one for C/EBP-\u03b2 ( Figure 3C ). Only mutations in the C/EBP-\u03b2 binding site (-105 to -92 region) completely abolished the IKK\u03b5-dependent regulation of the IL-6 promoter activity in 22Rv1-6TR-pTrexIKK\u03b5 and PC3-6TR-shIKK\u03b5 clones ( Figure 4B -4E) and IKK\u03b5 over-expression only induced the C/EBP-\u03b2 binding to the endogenous IL-6 promoter region ( Figure 4F ). In PC-3 cells, a previous study showed that over expression of C/EBP-\u03b2 or NF-\u03baB induced IL-6 promoter activity but the strongest induction occurred with the simultaneous over-expression of both TFs and was largely dependent upon an intact C/EBP-\u03b2 binding site localized between -144 and -132 [52] . This TF binding site is the same as the one we identified and mutated in the -129 to -56 region, the difference in the localization (-144 to -132 compared to -105 to -92) is due to a recent reposition of the IL-6 gene transcription start site (Genebank NM_000600.3).",

In this study, we observed that C/EBP-\u03b2 expression levels increased in PC3-6TR-shIKK\u03b5 xenografts expressing IKK\u03b5 compared to xenografts depleted for IKK\u03b5 ( Figure 5C-5D) . It was previously reported that C/ EBP-\u03b2 levels are significantly higher in PC samples from CR patients compared with therapy-na\u00efve patients, and upon androgen deprivation, C/EBP-\u03b2 mRNA and protein expression are rapidly increased in HS PC cell lines [60] . Moreover, its expression seems directly regulated by AR activity as AR can bind to and suppress the C/EBP-\u03b2 proximal promoter [60] . These observations suggest that C/EBP-\u03b2 expression may correlate with the IKK\u03b5 expression previously described in PC [17, 22] . In these studies, we showed that IKK\u03b5 is constitutively expressed in CR PC cell lines compared to HS cell lines in which its expression is inducible and AR-dependent [17] . We also observed that CR PC tissues present the highest cytoplasmic IKK\u03b5 expression levels, and found a strong link between increased IKK\u03b5 cytoplasmic expression and metastatic progression [22] . Since phosphorylation plays an important role in regulating C/EBP-\u03b2 nuclear translocation and its subsequent gene transactivation [36, 61] , we analyzed the impact of IKK\u03b5 expression on the phosphorylation of C/EBP-\u03b2. We found that IKK\u03b5 directly interacted with C/EBP-\u03b2 ( Figure 5A ) and IKK\u03b5 overexpression induces not only C/EBP-\u03b2 phosphorylation ( Figure 5B ) but also its nuclear accumulation in PC cells ( Figure 5C ). In contrast, we failed to detect any phosphorylation of CREB when IKK\u03b5 was over-expressed (data not shown).",

St-Bruno, Quebec, Canada) supplemented with 100 \u03bcg/ ml gentamicin, 0.25 \u03bcg/ml amphotericin B (Invitrogen, Paisley, United Kingdoms) and 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). In order to modulate IKK\u03b5 expression in these cell lines, we engineered 22Rv1-6TR-pTrexIKK\u03b5 cells in addition to previously described PC3-6TR-shIKK\u03b5 cells [18] (and their respective 22Rv1-6TR-pTrexLacZ/ PC3-6TR-shLacZ controls). For the construction of the pT-Rex-DEST30-IKK\u03b5 vector (abbreviated pTrex-IKK\u03b5), we amplified the IKK\u03b5 gene by PCR (primers described in Supplementary Table S1) using the pUNO-hIKK\u03b5 plasmid (Invitrogen) as template and cloned it under the control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter in the pT-Rex TM -DEST30 vector (Invitrogen). We stably transformed 22Rv1 cells with pcDNA6/TR (Invitrogen) using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A 22Rv1-pcDNA6/TR clone over-expressing TetR (abbreviated 22Rv1-6TR) was selected and used to create stable 22Rv1-6TR-pTrexIKK\u03b5 cell lines.

Six stable 22Rv1-6TR-pTrexIKK\u03b5 clones that differentially over-expressed IKK\u03b5, and two stable 22Rv1-6TR-pTrexLacZ clones that overexpressed LacZ were isolated for this study.",

Doxycycline-inducible PC3-6TR-shIKK\u03b5 clones, as well as PC3-6TR-shLacZ control clones, were injected into the flank of male NOD SCID mice (1 \u00d7 10 6 cells per mouse). Cells were mixed with matrigel (v/v) prior to injection to limit their spread and to allow the formation of denser, better defined tumors. To minimize stress in mice, doxycycline was delivered through their diet with doxycycline-supplemented food (625 mg/kg; Harlan Laboratories, Indianapolis, IN). Doxycycline-supplemented diet (dox-diet) was started one week prior to PC cell injection. During experiments, no dehydration or weight loss was observed in mice fed with the dox-diet. Tumor volumes were calculated using the following equation: V (mm 3 ) = a \u00d7 b \u00d7 h, where a is the largest diameter, b is the perpendicular diameter and h is the height. Tumor size was monitored twice a week until tumors reach 2500 mm 3 . At this endpoint, intratumoral liquid was collected (if present) for IL-6 quantification by ELISA, and tumors were excised from sacrificed mice. Tumor mass was weighed, sectioned into small pieces, fixed in formalin and mounted in paraffin blocks. Tissue sections were subsequently probed for IKK\u03b5 with the anti-IKK\u03b5 (CT) antibody (dilution 1/300) from ProSci Incorporated (Poway, CA) using a biotin-streptavidin peroxidase method as previously described [62] .
