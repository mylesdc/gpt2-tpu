No effect was observed on the proportion of children with otitis media with effusion (OME), AOM or AOMwiP at 12 months of age, however, significantly fewer vaccinees (14%) than controls (23%) experienced chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) and vaccinees experienced delayed onset of TMP [11] .",

The interaction between FLUA and S. pneumoniae is well noted [17, 18] . Influenza neuraminidase is demonstrated to increase pneumococcal adhesion and invasion in the Eustachian tube and middle ear [19, 20] . RSV can also facilitate bacterial adhesion. Studies reveal that in the presence of RSV, certain strains of M. catarrhalis have an enhanced ability to adhere to epithelial cells [21] . Additionally, viral mediated inflammation congests the Eustachian tube and further reduces cilial function, inhibiting bacterial clearance [22, 23] , while viral immunosuppression can lead to bacterial superinfection [24] . Recent evidence suggests that pneumococcal load is driven by FLUA, HRV and RSV infection, and that enhanced transmission and acquisition occurs in the presence of FLUA [18, 25] .",

Additionally when quantifying the total bacterial load using 16S primers, we used S. pneumoniae with 4 ribosomal operons Our swabs were collected at monthly intervals, so we have assumed that microbiology at the time of diagnosis best approximates the aetiology of that event. However our definition of the primary perforation included perforation of less than 6 weeks duration. The exact date of onset was not available. This analysis describes the nasal microbiology and ear status at the time of swab collection and presents the data for Normal, OME, AOM and AOMwiP. Furthermore, while the nasopharynx and the middle ear show concordance of infection, studies suggest a lapse of 3-10 days between upper respiratory symptoms and onset of otitis media [31, 32] . It is therefore plausible that bacterial load and viral detection will be greater in swabs collected prior to perforation, compared to swabs collected at or after the time of perforation.",

In children older than 3 months, age exerted no influence on load. This finding reflects the natural acquisition of these bacteria after birth. No differences in the bacterial loads were observed between the sexes or with antibiotic use in the fortnight prior to examination and swabbing ( Table 2) . Treatment guidelines recommend antibiotic use upon diagnosis of AOM. The effect of antibiotic use on loads, by ear state, was also investigated (data not included). No differences in the bacterial loads were observed, with or without antibiotic use, in swabs taken at a diagnosis of AOM or AOMwiP. Viral-bacterial co-infections are often associated with antibiotic treatment failure [36] . In the Indigenous children in our study, antibiotic therapy had no discernable effect on bacterial loads. For densely colonised children with treatment failure, more work is needed to determine whether antiviral medication might be a valid adjunct to antibiotic treatment. Recently a randomized controlled trial in the United States found that children receiving oseltamivir (Tamiflu) treatment within 48 hours of clinic presentation for laboratory confirmed influenza were considerably less likely to progress to AOM. This effect was greatest for children between the ages 1-5 years old where the incidence of AOM was the greatest [37] .",

The introduction of the 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, with broader pneumococcal serotype coverage and potential protection from the addition of the H. influenzae protein D antigen is possibly the first step in the right direction.
