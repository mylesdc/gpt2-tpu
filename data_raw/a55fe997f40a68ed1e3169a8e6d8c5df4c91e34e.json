A total of 8696 parturients were enrolled, of whom 113 with prenatal positive HBeAg were invited back. The prevalence of HBsAg decreased over the study period, particularly in the vaccinated cohort, while there was no change in the prevalence of HBeAg. Foreign parturients had a higher HBeAg-positive rate and delayed HBeAg clearance, and those with a higher body mass index (>24 kg/m 2 ) had earlier HBeAg clearance (51.9% vs. 23.9%, p = 0.005). Only 30% of the subjects who were positive for HBeAg before birth became negative 5 years after delivery. In conclusion, the downward trend in HB infection with more significance among vaccinated parturients reflects effective prevention and the impact of universal HB immunization. Nonetheless, aggressive follow-up is necessary for parturients who are persistently positive for HBeAg postpartum, as well as developing different public health policies for foreign parturients from endemic areas.",

Two years later, the vaccination program extended the coverage to all newborns, and also gave hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) injections to the newborns of HBeAg-positive mothers within 24 hours after birth. Thus Taiwan was the first country to introduce an HB vaccination program in the world 5 .

In July 1984, Taiwan launched a mass nationwide hepatitis B vaccination program for infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers. Two years later, the program was extended to cover all newborns as well as to give HBIG injections to the newborns with HBeAg-positive mothers 14, 15 . In the current study, the overall prevalence rate of HBsAg in the pregnant women over the past 10 years was 10.6-18.8%, with a decreasing trend in each calendar year. There was an abrupt decrease in the number of parturients in 2003, as the hospital was isolated due to a nosocomial outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 16 . We found a dramatic decrease in the HBsAg-positive rate to 2.6% in the vaccinated parturients, suggesting that the universal immunization program was successful in reducing the rate of perinatal infection. Interestingly, we also noted a decrease in the prevalence rate of HBsAg among the group born before the universal vaccination program was launched, suggesting the protective impact of the additional vaccination since 1987 on pre-school and middle school children. Similar results were also reported by a systematic review reporting the prevalence of HBV infection in two time periods (1990 and 2005) 17 . Moreover, owing to efforts on primary strategies to reduce or eliminate the risk of HBV transmission from nosocomial exposure (e.g. screening for safe blood and blood products for transfusion, use of disposable syringes and needles and universal precautions), the risk of hepatitis B infection as well as super-infections with hepatitis D virus among HBV carriers has dramatically decreased, which also had a protective impact on the unvaccinated cohort 18, 19 .",

In the current study, the HBeAg-positive rate further declined to 22% in the early 2000s, but remained stationary thereafter.

            "text": "Several studies have reported that immigrants from endemic areas with a higher HBV prevalence and later implementation of vaccination programs can be a challenge for public health policies of the countries to which they move [26] [27] [28] . We found that the foreign parturients had higher HBeAg prevalence and delayed HBeAg clearance rates compared to the Taiwanese mothers. Despite World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations that HBV vaccines should have been incorporated into routine childhood immunization programs by 1997, and that the primary strategy to control HBV infection is universal infant immunization, some countries have not been able to afford to implement such measures as early as recommended 29, 30 . Chu et al. reported a change in the epidemiology of hepatitis B related to migration by comparing six northern and north-western European countries 31 . Their results showed evident differences in the HBsAg prevalence rate between the migrants and general population, which the authors concluded was because most of the migrants acquired the infection in early childhood in their country of birth. In Taiwan, most foreign mothers come from China and Vietnam. China launched a nationwide HBV vaccination 33 . This may explain why we found higher HBeAg prevalence and delayed HBeAg clearance rates in the foreign parturients than in those born in Taiwan. This issue cannot be ignored, and different strategies should be considered for HBV infection surveillance in the migrant population 34 . Although nationality, BMI, fatty liver and HBV genotypes were all associated with HBeAg clearance, BMI was the only statistically significant factor in this study. Although the impact of BMI on the natural history of chronic hepatitis B infection still remains unclear, several studies have demonstrated an inverse relationship between BMI and metabolic syndrome and HBsAg serum clearance [35] [36] [37] . Chiang et al. reported a relationship between extreme obesity or central obesity and a low prevalence of high HBV viral load in patients seropositive for HBeAg 38 . Larger longitudinal studies are required to further clarify the association and mechanism between obesity and the natural course of HBV infection.",
