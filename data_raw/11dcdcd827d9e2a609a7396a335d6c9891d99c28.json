Calibration curve relating the root mean square amplitude, A rms (arb. units) recorded by the microphone with an independent measure of the sound pressure level, SPL, obtained from a decibel meter after removing the background noise, for saying /\u0251/ at 8 different amplitudes and 6 times at each amplitude for 10 people. Color codes identify individual participants (5 males denoted as M1 to M5 and 5 females denoted as F1 to F5). Black line is power law fit with exponent 0.094, correlation coefficient \u03c1 = 0.774 and Pearson's p value = 3.6\u00d710 -17 . Figure S2 . Geometric mean diameter, D g , for 10 people versus root mean square amplitude, A rms (arb. units). Color codes identify individual participants. (A) Vocalizing /\u0251/ at 8 different amplitudes, (each data point is average of 6 times saying /\u0251/). (B) Reading aloud the \"Rainbow\" passage at 3 levels of loudness (quiet, intermediate, loud). Figure S3 -Size distribution of the particles released during the first half of a 5-sec vocalization (released to an initially dryer ambient air) repeated 6 times, compared to the size distribution of particles released during second half of the vocalization (released to moister ambient air). The size distribution is independent of when they were expired, indicating the particles have dried completely by the time they reach the APS sensor. Figure S4 .

Figure S7 . Particle emission rate/concentration for reading chapter 24 of \"The Little Prince\" in English by 30 people (10 Spanish speakers, 10 Mandarin speakers, and 10 Arabic speakers shown with square, diamond, and triangle markers, respectively).

Analysis of the superemitters. (A) Particle emission rate for saying /\u0251/ vs. reading an English passage at voice amplitude of 0.1 (approximately 85 dB). Blue markers are non-superemitters, and green, black, and red markers are superemitters while saying /\u0251/, while reading passage, and for both activities, respectively. Solid line is the best linear fit (\u03c1 = 0.69, and p = 9.8\u00d710 -7 ). (B) Particles emission rate/concentration versus A rms , for two participants, M5 and F4, at three different days.
