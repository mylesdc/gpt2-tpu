It is a fundamentally important problem because the information thus obtained may benefit the understanding of many basic biological processes and provide useful clues for drug design. In this study, based on the information of chemical-chemical interactions, a novel method was developed that can be used to identify which of the following eleven metabolic pathway classes a query compound may be involved with: (Xenobiotics Biodegradation and Metabolism. It was observed that the overall success rate obtained by the method via the 5-fold crossvalidation test on a benchmark dataset consisting of 3,137 compounds was 77.97%, which is much higher than 10.45%, the corresponding success rate obtained by the random guesses. Besides, to deal with the situation that some compounds may be involved with more than one metabolic pathway class, the method presented here is featured by the capacity able to provide a series of potential metabolic pathway classes ranked according to the descending order of their likelihood for each of the query compounds concerned. Furthermore, our method was also applied to predict 5,549 compounds whose metabolic pathway classes are unknown. Interestingly, the results thus obtained are quite consistent with the deductions from the reports by other investigators. It is anticipated that, with the continuous increase of the chemical-chemical interaction data, the current method will be further enhanced in its power and accuracy, so as to become a useful complementary vehicle in annotating uncharacterized compounds for their biological functions.",

These energy-using and energy-releasing chemical reactions catalyzed by enzymes are organized into many metabolic pathways. Some compounds/small molecules play major roles in these pathways and are vital for many activities essential for life. For example, during the digestion, the energy rich molecules (i.e. carbohydrate) are broken apart to provide energy, which is then used by cells to build up complex molecules from simple molecules, such as utilizing amino acids to synthesize new proteins that the body needs. Identifying the biological functions of compounds is an effective way to study the mechanisms of many basic biological processes [2] . On the other hand, small molecules are the cause, and the cure, for many diseases. For example, diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disease caused by insufficient or inefficient insulin secretary response and elevated blood glucose level [3] . Compounds such as sulfonylureas [4] , acarbose [5] , biguanides, thiazolidinediones [5] , and sitagliptin [3] have been used as effective drugs for diabetic therapy. Therefore, it is essential to annotate the bioactivities of compounds, which will benefit drug design and disease treatment.",

Different from these methods, Lu et al. [1] and Cai et al.

The functional group composition was used to represent the compounds, and the Nearest Neighbor Algorithm and AdaBoost learner [13] were used to construct the prediction models by Cai et al.

            "text": "Recently, the systems biology methods based on protein-protein interactions have been widely applied for predicting protein attributes [15, 16, 17, 18, 19] . These algorithms suggest that interactive proteins are likely to share the common biological functions [16, 17, 18, 19] , also more likely tending to have the same biological function than non-interactive ones [20, 21] . Likewise, we can assume that the interactive compounds may tend to share the common biological functions. In this study, the chemical-chemical interactions were retrieved from STITCH [22] (Search tool for interactions of chemicals), where the interaction unit consists of two chemicals and their interaction weight. The interaction weight (confidence score) represents the probability that the interaction occurs between the two chemicals concerned. The interactive compounds can be classified into the following three categories: (I) ones that participate in the same reactions; (II) ones that share the similar structures or activities; (III) ones with the literature associations [22] . In a metabolism system, chemical reactions are organized into many metabolic pathways, thus the compounds involved in the same reactions are in the same metabolic pathways. Similar structures or activity means that they share the similar functions, and hence they are likely to be in the same metabolic pathways. The co-occurrence of two compounds in many literatures suggests some kinds of direct or indirect relationships, indicating they have the potential to be in the same metabolic pathways. Accordingly, it is rational to suppose that the interactive compounds tend to participate in the same metabolic pathways.",

            "text": "Predicted results for the compounds with unknown metabolic pathway Encouraged by the quite promising results obtained by the 5fold cross-validation test on the benchmark dataset of the 3,137 compounds, we applied the method to the 5,549 compounds whose metabolic pathways are unknown as mentioned in the Materials and Methods section. The predicted results thus obtained are given in Table S1 . As discussed above, we selected the metabolic pathway classes obtained by the 1 st and 2 nd order predictions for these compounds, in hoping that the information thus obtained may provide useful clues for further investigations. Actually, it is interesting to see that many of our predicted results have proved to be reasonable according to the reports from other investigators. For example, N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfate and its interactive compounds with pathway information are shown in Table 4 . N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfate can bind to sulfate, glucuronic acid, galactose, xylose, fucose, Na(+), glycerol, and phosphate to form complex to perform the biological function [39] . In PubMed Abstracts, N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfate is comentioned with sulfate [40] , glucuronic acid [41] , galactose [42] , 39-phospho.pho. [43] , sugar-1-phosph. [44] , UDP-GlcNAc [45] , indole-3-glyce. [46] , N-acetyl-D-glucosamine [47] , and GDPmannose [44] . Besides, N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfate and Nacetyl-D-glucosamine share a similar structure and the difference is that N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfate has a sulfate at the position 4 of the ring while N-acetyl-D-glucosamine has not [38] . From these evidences, N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfate is supposed to participate in the same metabolic pathways as its interactive compounds. It can be seen from Table 4 that most of the interactive compounds of N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfate belong to the 1 st and 2 nd metabolic pathway classes. By considering all the interactions and the interaction confidence scores, it was predicted that Carbohydrate Metabolism (the 1 st class) and Energy Metabolism (the 2 nd class) would be the possible metabolic pathway classes that N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfate belongs to. Actually, as a carbohydrate, N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfate reacts with Chondroitin 4-sulfate to form hydrogen oxide and G12336 (i.e. (GalNAc) 2 (GlcA) 1 (S) 2 ), one kind of glycan which can participate in Carbohydrate and Energy Metabolism. Therefore, N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfate may also participate in Carbohydrate and Energy Metabolism. Another example is that cyclopropylamine in Table 4 has 23 interactive compounds with known pathway information. Cyclopropylamine, cyanuric acid, ammonia, N-cyclopropylammelide, c0761, hydroxyl radicals are in the same pathway -N-cyclopropylmelamine degradation [48, 49] , where N-cyclopropylmelamine first reacts with hydrogen oxide to form N-cyclopropylammeline and ammonia, and then N-cyclopropylammeline also reacts with hydrogen oxide to form Ncyclopropylammelide and ammonia. After that, N-cyclopropylammelide reacts with hydrogen oxide to form cyanuric acid, cyclopropylamine and hydroxyl radicals. Finally, cyanuric acid is transformed into hydrogen oxide and ammonia through cyanurate degradation. Cyanuric acid, N-cyclopropylammelide, and c0761 are all in the 11 th pathway class. Therefore, cyclopropylamine may also belong to the 11 th pathway class (Xenobiotics Biodegradation and Metabolism). For other interactive compounds, they are comentioned with cyclopropylamine in PubMed Abstracts, such as polyethylene [50] , 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid [51] , cyclopropanecarboxylic acid [52] , 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid [53] , and acetophenone [54] . In Table 4 , most of the interactive compounds of cyclopropylamine belong to the 11 th metabolic pathway classes. According to above analysis, cyclopropylamine is suggested to participate in the Xenobiotics Biodegradation Metabolism, which was the 1 st -order predicted class for cyclopropylamine by our method. Accordingly, it is quite reasonable to expect that our method may provide useful information for further investigating into biological functions of compounds from the viewpoint of system biology.",

In view of this, biochemical experiments should be conducted by mainly focusing on the targets predicted by the 1 st and 2 nd order predictions. The results obtained by the last five order predictions can be ignored due to their very low likelihood (,2%). Consequently, the current prediction method can provide useful clues for further validation by experiments and expedite the research progress by prioritizing the targets concerned.",
