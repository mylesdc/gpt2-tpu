Group A rotaviruses cause diarrhea in pigs both before and after weaning [5] and can account for 53 and 44% pre-and post-weaning rotavirus-associated diarrhea in swine, respectively [6] . A recent report attributed 89% of all rotavirus-associated diarrhea in commercial pig farms to group A rotavirus infections [7] . Since rotaviruses can survive in the environment for long period of time and are transmitted via the fecal-oral route outbreaks are difficult to control. Virion replication occurs at the tips of epithelial cell in intestinal villi and destroy enterocytes primarily in the jejunum and ileum resulting in villous atrophy [8, 9] . Furthermore, nutrients cannot be digested or absorbed in the affected regions resulting in severe malabsorption [10] . A better understanding of rotavirus epidemiology will contribute to the optimization of current vaccines and prevention programs for the control of rotavirus infection. Currently available vaccines (mostly killed) can not offer efficient immunity. To stimulate efficient immunity, a large vaccine dose and repeated administration are usually required. This often results in undesirable clinical signs. To overcome these shortcomings, the potential development of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) to deliver heterologous antigen to the mucosal immune system has been proposed.",

            "text": "Since rotaviruses are enteric pathogens, mucosal immunity is likely to play an important role in protective immunity. Innate immune responses in gut provide the first line of defense against pathogenic microorganisms and also initiate acquired immune responses. Furthermore, immune responses resulting from oral immunization are the only suitable method of stimulating gut immunity [11] since this route facilitates stimulation of gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) enhancing the production of anti-viral IgA [12] . Compared to recombinant antigens or heat-killed formulations, 'live' vaccines elicit the most effective protective responses since they stimulate both systemic and mucosal immunity [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . However, oralvaccination presents a challenge since the gut milieu often denatures and/or inactivates potential vaccinogens therefore large vaccination doses and repeated vaccinations are required [18, 19] . This often results in fecal shedding of the live vaccine in addition to causing fever and diarrhea [16, 18, 19] . These challenges can be overcome by using lactic acid bacteria (LAB) as antigen delivery system for the stimulation of mucosal immunity [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] owing to its safety. LAB are used in industrial food fermentation, preservation and have beneficial effects on the health of both humans and animals and 'generally regarded as safe, (GRAS'microorganisms). In addition, many strains of LAB are able to survive and colonize the intestinal tract [26, 27] inducing a non-specific immunoadjuvant effect [28] which prompted studies aimed at determining the oral vaccine potential of LAB-derived vaccines.",

Gels run in parallel were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and examined by Western blot analysis using anti-VP4 antibodies. Immunoreactive bands corresponding to VP4 and VP4-LTB were observed at 27 and 40 kDa, respectively (Figure 2A, lane 2 and Figure 2B, lane 2). Reactive bands were not detected if the cells were instead grown in the presence of glucose (Figure 2A, lane 3 and Figure 2B, lane 1). These results demonstrated the efficiency and specificity of the L. casei xylose promoter. Immunofluorescence analysis L. casei surface-displayed expression of VP4 and VP4-LTB, respectively, was confirmed by immunofluorescence. Overnight cultures of pPG612.1-VP4 and pPG612.1-VP4-LTB were grown in basal MRS medium supplemented with either xylose or glucose. The cells were washed, incubated with mouse anti-VP4 anti serum followed by a FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. VP4 was detected on the surface of pPG612.1-VP4 and pPG612.1-VP4-LTB cells grown in the presence of xylose (Figure 3B and 3C). No immunofluorescence was observed when wild-type L. casei 393 was incubated in a similar fashion (cells were stained red by Evans blue dye, Figure 3A).

Total cell lysates were analysed by SDS-PAGE. Coomassie blue gel staining shows the expression of a 27 KD and 40 KD fusion protein in lysates of rLc393 induced by xylose (Fig. 1A, lane 3 and Fig. 1B, lane 3), but not in basal MRS with glucose (Fig. 1A, lane 2 and Fig. 1B, lane 2).Western-blotting analysis of VP4 and vp4-LTB expression in recombinant strainFigure 2Western-blotting analysis of VP4 and vp4-LTB expression in recombinant strain. Immunoreactive bands were observed (Fig. 2A, lane 2 and Fig. 3B, lane 2) in the similar position as shown in the SDS-PAGE, however, there were no immunoblots in the same cell lysates induced by glucose(Fig. 2A, lane 3 and Fig. 3B, lane 1).",
