            "text": "The major histocompatibility complex (MHC), also known as the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system in humans, plays a pivotal role in activating T-cell immune responses by presenting antigen peptides on antigen-presenting cells (APCs). The residues in the peptide-binding grooves (PBGs) of HLA molecules are highly polymorphic and this determines the peptide-binding motifs and the subsequent T-cell immunity features of people with different HLA types. At the present moment, 15,586 HLA molecules have been identified (https:// www.ebi.ac.uk/ipd/imgt/hla/stats.html). The concept of HLA supertypes offers a simple and useful way to clarify the peptidebinding features of HLA molecules with cross-presented peptide reservoirs (1) (2) (3) . In particular, determining the MHC-binding peptide motif is now widely accessible as an important approach of MHC I allele classification (4) . Twelve HLA supertypes (A1, A1A3, A1A24, A2, A3, A24, B7, B8, B27, B44, B58, and B62) have thus far been reported, based on their binding motifs (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) . Alleles of the same supertype have similar binding motifs, which is very useful for screening special peptides presented by certain MHC I molecules and would benefit subsequent T-cell recognition and vaccine development studies.",

However, based on the current definition, alleles from the A * 30 serotype possess different peptide-binding motifs and belong to distinct HLA supertypes including A1 and A3, both of which are widely distributed in humans (4) . According to previous studies based on binding assays or pool sequencing/ligand elution, the A1 supertype includes HLA-A * 01:01, HLA-A * 26:01, HLA-A * 30:03, HLA-A * 30:04, and HLA-A * 32:01. A1 supertype alleles prefer to have amino acids which are either small or aliphatic (e.g., Ala, Thr, Ser, Val, Leu, Ile, Met, or Gln) at position 2 (P2) of the peptide and aromatic and large hydrophobic amino acids (e.g., Phe, Trp, Tyr, Leu, Ile, and Met) at the C-terminus (P ) (4) . The A3 supertype includes HLA-A * 03:01, HLA-A * 11:01, HLA-A * 31:01, HLA-A * 33:01, HLA-A * 66:01, and HLA-A * 68:01. A3 supertype alleles also prefer amino acids which are either small or aliphatic at P2 of the peptides they present. However, basic amino acids (e.g., Arg, His, and Lys) are favored as the P residue of peptides presented by A3 supertype molecules (4, 13) .",

To further complicate matters, HLA-A * 30:01 was also assigned to the A3 supertype according to bioinformatic methods (15) and then later reassigned to the A3 supertype, based on HLA-A * 30:01 binding assays (16) . Meanwhile, others proposed that HLA-A * 30:01 belonged to the A1A3 supertype, based on a compilation of published motifs, binding data, and analyses of shared repertoires of binding peptides (4) . In the same study, HLA-A * 30:03 was reported to be an A1 supertype allele (4) . Clearly, the molecular bases of peptide presentation by HLA-A * 30:01 and HLA-A * 30:03 still need to be determined in order to precisely classify these two closely related HLA alleles.",

Meanwhile, a recombinant MHC class I molecule renature assay has shown that MTB (QIMYNYPAM) is presented by HLA-A * 30:01 (18) . Here, we found that RT313 also formed stable complexes with both HLA-A * 30:01 and HLA-A * 30:03 through co-refolding assays (Table 1, Figure 1A ). In contrast, NP44 could bind HLA-A * 30:03 but not HLA-A * 30:01 in vitro (Table 1, Figure 1A) . Similarly, no binding was observed between MTB and HLA-A * 30:01 in co-refolding experiments. In contrast, MTB could be presented by HLA-A * 30:03 (Table 1, Figure 1A ). These results may indicate that HLA-A * 30:03 can not only bind peptides cross-presented by A1 supertype alleles, but can also accommodate peptides cross-presented by A3 supertype alleles, with A1A3 supertype features. However, HLA-A * 30:01 could only bind peptides cross-presented by A3 supertype alleles. Although peptide RT313 was able to bind both HLA-A * 30:01 and HLA-A * 30:03, circular dichroism (CD) assays showed that HLA-A * 30:01/RT313 (with a mean T m of 45.4 \u2022 C) was much more stable than HLA-A * 30:03/RT313 (with a mean T m of 37.3 \u2022 C) (Supplemental Figure 2) .",

We found that HLA-A * 30:03 could present MTB-M9Y, MTB-M9F, MTB-M9I, MTB-M9V, and MTB-M9L peptides with A1 supertype binding motifs and could also present the MTB-M9K peptide with A3 supertype binding motifs. However, it could not present MTB-M9R ( Table 2 with defined assays, For 15 potential HLA-A * 30:01-binding peptides with aliphatic or aromatic amino acids as P residues ( Table 3) . we verified the binding of the peptides with HLA-A * 30:01 using the co-refolding assay. HLA-A * 30:01 did not show any binding capacity to any of these 15 peptides. In contrast, five peptides (IEDB1, IEDB2, IEDB9, IEDB11, and IEDB15) with Leu, Ser, Ile, Val, and Tyr at P residue could help HLA-A * 30:03 renature in vitro (Supplemental Figures 4A-E) . These results also support that HLA-A * 30:01 possesses more features of A3 supertype compared to HLA-A * 30:03. Table 4 ). The overall structures of these four complexes showed typical MHC I conformations ( Figure 1B) . The root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of the overall structures of HLA-A * 30:01 and HLA-A * 30:03 was 0.591, which indicated that these two molecules were extremely similar. Five amino acids differed between HLA-A * 30:01 and HLA-A * 30:03 and these were mainly located at the \u03b11\u03b12 domains of the heavy chains and residues 70, 77, and 152 in the PBG, which may influence peptide binding ( Figure 1C) . The electron densities for these three peptides were well-defined into the PBG of HLA-A * 30:01 and HLA-A * 30:03, which indicated that the conformations of these four structures were stable (Figures 1D-G) . their cross-presentation features. Firstly, the alignment of these three structures showed that there was a similar overall conformation of the presented peptide, RT313, in the PBGs (Figure 2A) . Our crystallographic data showed that although the key residues at position 74, 77, 114, and 116 are different in the F pockets of HLA-A * 11:01, HLA-A * 30:01, and HLA-A * 30:03, the binding modes of the P -Lys residue of RT313 in the F pockets of these three molecules were quite similar. The NZatom of the P -Lys residue had hydrogen bonds with Asp74, through a water molecule in HLA-A * 11:01, HLA-A * 30:01, and HLA-A * 30:03 (Figures 2B-D) . Meanwhile, HLA-A * 30:01 and HLA-A * 30:03 possess a His at position 116, differed from HLA-A * 11:01, which has an Asp at this position. Similar to the direct hydrogen bond between Asp116 in HLA-A * 11:01 and P -Lys in RT313 (Figure 2C) , His116 in HLA-A * 30:01 and HLA-A * 30:03 could also form hydrogen bonds with the positively-charged anchor Lys (Figures 2B-D) . Although residue 77 of HLA-A * 30:01 (Asp77) and HLA-A * 30:03 (Asn77) were different, the NZ-atom of P -Lys also formed direct hydrogen bonds with Asp77 in HLA-A * 11:01 and HLA-A * 30:01 and with Asn77 in HLA-A * 30:03 (Figures 2B-D) .",

In HLA-A * 03:01, HLA-A * 68:01, and HLA-A * 11:01, residues 74, 77, and 116 were the negatively charged acidic amino acid, Asp, which resulted in F pockets with a strong negative charge (Figures 3D-F) . In HLA-A * 30:01, even though residue 116 was His, not Asp, the F pocket still had strong negative charge (Figure 3G) , thereby allowing HLA-A * 30:01 to bind positively charged amino acids, such as Lys and Arg. This also suggested that, when His/Asp116 is the only difference between HLA-A * 30:01 and HLA-A * 30:03, the residue in this position has little impact on the charge of the F pocket. In contrast, residue 77 was different between HLA-A * 01:01 (Asn77) and the A3 supertype alleles (Asp77). Asn has a weaker negative charge than Asp and therefore, the HLA-A * 01:01 F pocket has a weaker negative charge than the A3 supertype F pockets ( Figure 3I) . The difference in the charge of the F pockets between the A1 and A3 supertypes was one of the main reasons for their different binding motifs. This suggests that residue 77 plays a key role in the definition of different supertypes.",

Further analysis revealed that Arg152 of HLA-A * 30:03 formed a salt bridge with P3-Glu.

As in the binding assays, peptide RT313 could be presented by both mutated HLA molecules ( Figure 5A) . However, in comparison to wild type HLA-A * 30:01, the binding capacity of HLA-A * 30:01D77N to RT313 decreased. In contrast, the binding capacity of HLA-A * 30:03N77D to RT313 increased in comparison to wild type HLA-A * 30:03 ( Figure 5B) . Peptide MTB, which has an A1 supertype-binding peptide-featured P anchor, could not bind HLA-A * 30:01, but after the introduction of the D77N mutation, HLA-A * 30:01D77N was able to bind MTB (Figures 5C,D) . We found the melting temperature (T m ) of HLA-A * 30:01D77N/MTB to be 42.6 \u2022 C. In contrast, even though MTB could still be presented by HLA-A * 30:03N77D, the binding capacity decreased significantly after mutagenesis (Figure 5C) . Similarly, peptide NP44 could be presented by wild type HLA-A * 30:03, but not by HLA-A * 30:01 (Figures 5E,F) . Mutant HLA-A * 30:03N77D lost the ability to bind with NP44, whereas HLA-A * 30:01D77N bound NP44 with high capacity (Figures 5E,F) . The peptide-binding ability of the F pocket of HLA-A * 30:01 and HLA-A * 30:03 shifted in opposite directions after mutation of residue 77. These results indicate that residue 77 is the key position involved in determining the different binding motifs between HLA-A * 30:01 and HLA-A * 30:03.",

When we mutated the amino acid at residue 77 of HLA-A * 30:01 and HLA-A * 30:03, we found that the binding capacity changed to the opposite direction for the two HLAs. One mutation, from Asp to Asn at position 77 in HLA-A * 30:01, enabled it to bind to the A1 supertype-binding peptides MTB and NP44. This indicated that Asp at position 77 restricted the binding of the F pocket of HLA-A * 30:01 to the positively charged residues of the binding peptides. When Asp77 was mutated to Asn, the anchor residue could be expended to other hydrophobic residues (e.g., Met or Tyr) in MTB and NP44. However, even though the binding capacity decreased when Asn77 of HLA-A * 30:03 was mutated to Asp77, the mutant HLA could still present MTB. This indicated that, although residue 77 was the main factor influencing the binding motif of the F pocket, it was not the only reason for the restricted peptide presentation.",

Interestingly, the peptide-binding modes of HLA-A * 30:03 possess unique features that are different from typical A1 and A3 supertype alleles. In contrast to HLA-A * 01:01, different residues at position 114 resulted in different binding motifs of HLA-A * 30:03 by influencing the charge surrounding of the F pocket. Although residue 116 can form a stable hydrogen bond with the P residue of the peptide, the binding motifs of the F pocket did not change when Asp116 was mutated to His116. In HLA-A * 01:01, Arg114 pointed to the \"mouth\" of the F pocket to form a strong positively charged environment, which may repel positive amino acids, such as Lys and Arg. However, in HLA-A * 30:03, Glu114 did not participate in the formation of the F pocket. The strength of the negative charge of the HLA-A * 30:03 F pocket was between that of the A3 and A1 supertype alleles. Therefore, HLA-A * 30:03 has A1A3 supertype peptide binding characteristics. In contrast to the typical A3 supertype alleles, HLA-A * 30:03 could not present MTB when the P residue was mutated to an Arg. One possible reason for this is that Arg has a stronger positive charge than Lys, while Asn77 and Glu114 gives a weaker negative charge in the F pocket of HLA-A * 30:03 than that of A3 supertype alleles. The positive charge of Arg was too strong for it to insert into the F pocket of HLA-A * 30:03. Based on these results, we can also predict the supertype of other similar HLA alleles (Supplemental Table 1 ).",

Recently, several pre-clinical and clinical studies have shown that vaccines targeting predicted personal tumor neoantigens are feasibility, safety, and immunogenicity (45, 50, (52) (53) (54) (55) . Adoptive T cell therapy that specifically recognize neoantigens has mediated substantial objective clinical regressions in patients with melanoma and metastatic breast cancer (56) (57) (58) . In our previous work, even one immunogenic CD8 + T-cell peptide could stimulate a strong T-cell immune response in vivo and could reduce virus shedding during challenge in mice (25) . In chickens, immunogenic CD8 + T-cell peptides have been identified from the Rous sarcoma virus and infectious bursal disease virus and these peptides had immune-protective functions (59, 60) . Due to an unusually large PBG in the MHC class I molecule, BF2 * 21:01, compared with BF2 * 04:01, BF2 * 21:01 is able to present a greater diversity of peptides than BF2 * 04:01. Therefore, chickens with the BF2 * 21:01 allele possess stronger antiviral abilities than those with the BF2 * 04:01 allele (59, 60) . However, to rapidly and precisely identify mutated epitope targets in individual patients still remains a daunting technical challenge. This indicates that binding motif-based HLA supertype classification could offers a simply and precisely way to characterize the peptides presented by a certain individual HLA allele and to understanding the disease susceptibility from the view of immunity. However, HLA alleles with single amino acid difference outside the pockets may not influence the binding motifs, but can also impact the disease status of patients by disturbing the TCR recognition (25, 61) .",

At the same time, some peptides can also be cross-recognized by alleles from different HLA supertypes. We have also detected some influenza virus peptides that can be presented by both HLA-A11 and HLA-A24, which belong to different supertypes, A3 and A24, respectively (65) . Herein, we found that the HIV peptide, RT313, could also be presented by A3 supertype allele HLA-A * 30:01 and A1A3 supertype allele HLA-A * 30:03. We also found that NP44, which was an A1 supertype allele, HLA-A * 01:01-restricted peptide, could also be presented by HLA-A * 30:03, but not by HLA-A * 30:01 (17) . This indicated that HLA-A * 30:03 could crossrecognize peptides presented by A1A3 supertype alleles, but HLA-A * 30:01 could only cross-recognize peptides presented by A3 supertype alleles. Previous work using recombinant MHC class I molecules, peptide MTB (QIMYNYPAM) has been shown to be presented by HLA-A * 30:01 (18) . Here, our results indicate that MTB bind to HLA-A * 30:03, but not to HLA-A * 30:01. The difference may be due to the different expression system in the studies.",

After correct refolding, the high absorbance peaks of the HLAs with the expected molecular mass of 45 KD were eluted at an estimated volume of 16 mL on a Superdex TM 200 10/300 GL column. (B) Structure alignment of HLA-A*30:01 (green) and HLA-A*30:03 (salmon) showed a similar overall conformation between the two alleles. (C) The amino acids that differed between HLA-A*30:01 (green) and HLA-A*30:03 (salmon) are shown as sticks. The authentic conformations of peptides RT313 (D) in the HLA-A*30:01 grooves and MTB (E), NP44 (F), and RT313 (G) in the HLA-A*30:03 grooves are shown in the 2Fo-Fc electron density maps contoured at 1.0 s.
