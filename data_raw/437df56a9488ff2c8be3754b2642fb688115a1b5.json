SNPs and deletions causing a truncation of the 3c gene product were found in almost all isolates from the diseased tissues of the eight cats suffering from FIP, whereas most, but not all fecal isolates from these same cats had intact 3c genes. Other accessory and structural genes appeared normal in both fecal and lesional viruses. Deliterious mutations in the 3c gene were unique to each cat, indicating that they did not originate in one cat and were subsequently passed horizontally to the others. Compartmentalization of the parental and mutant forms was not absolute; virus of lesional type was sometimes found in feces of affected cats and virus identical to fecal type was occasionally identified in diseased tissues. Although 3c gene mutants in this study were not horizontally transmitted, the parental fecal virus was readily transmitted by contact from a cat that died of FIP to its housemate. There was a high rate of mutability in all structural and accessory genes both within and between cats, leading to minor genetic variants. More than one",

The incidence of FIP rose progressively over the next two decades. The occurrence of FIP among all cats seen at veterinary medical teaching hospitals in the USA from 1986-1995 was 1:200 among new feline visits, 1:300 among total cat accessions, and 1% of accessions at diagnostic laboratories [3] . The incidence is several times higher among kittens and young cats originating from catteries or shelters. The disease was thought to be viral when first described but no specific etiologic agent was identified at the time [4] . Zook et al. [5] observed virus particles in the tissues of experimentally infected cats, however, the close similarities of FIP virus (FIPV) in tissues to members of the family Coronaviridae was noted by Ward [6] . The ability of FIPV to cause either a non-effusive (dry, parenchymatous) or effusive (wet, non-parenchymatous) form of the disease was first reported by Montali and Strandberg [7] . The close genetic relationship of FIPV to coronaviruses of dogs and swine was first recognized by Pedersen et al. [8] . The existence of two serotypes, feline-or canine-coronavirus like, was described in 1984 [9] .",

Subsequent studies demonstrated that the agent of FIP was distinct from FECV in disease potential but that both viruses co-existed in the same population and were antigenically identical [reviewed in 11, 12] . It was subsequently hypothesized that FIPV might be a simple mutant of FECV [13] , and the two viruses were later described as biotypes of each other [14] . Animal studies, with both natural [15] and experimental [16] infection, also suggest that FIPVs arise spontaneously during the course of FECV infection. Vennema et al. [17] demonstrated that all major structural and accessory genes of wild type FECVs were virtually identical to FIPVs from the same or closely related cats. However, 85% of FIPVs studied had deleterious mutations in a small accessory gene called 3c. These mutations, which were either deletions or introduced stop codons, were also found to be unique to each cat.",

In fact, there is a general feeling that FIPV and FECV are either the same virus, with disease being dependent on the nature of the host's immune response [reviewed 11] , or that the causative mutation is in other genes [18] . Although the precise origin of FIPVs is debated, there appears to be agreement regarding the relative cell tropisms of FECVs and FIPVs. FECVs are thought to have greater tropism for the mature apical intestinal epithelium, while FIPVs are believed to have a greater tropism for macrophages [reviewed 11 ]. This has led to the a strongly held belief that coronaviruses found in the feces are FECV-like, while viruses found in extra-intestinal (usually lesional) tissues are FIPV-like [19] .",

The first correlate of this theory supposes that each FIP cat will have its own unique 3c mutant which is not transmitted cat-to-cat. The second correlate assumes compartmentalization of enteric and FIP biotypes to gut and internal tissues, respectively.

The overall sequence identity for the nine structural and accessory genes was \u2265 99% with only a small number of mutations among the four highly related viruses (Table  1) . Mutations consisted of minor SNP changes, and less commonly deletions that appeared to be randomly scattered among the genes that were sequenced; about one half of the mutations resulted in amino acid changes ( Table 2 ). Among the 9 structural and accessory genes of the four related cats, the highest genetic variability was in the 3c gene, followed by the S and M genes ( Table 2 ). The least variability was detected in the 3b, 7a, and 3a accessory genes.

These variants were designated FIPV-UCD11a and -UCD11b. There were only five SNPs scattered across the nine structural and accessory genes between the two variants. Two variants were also sequenced from the omentum of Toby, one with a non-functional 3c gene (FIPV-UCD12) and one with a functional 3c gene (FECV-UCD5). These two variants were identical in sequence except for a single-base deletion in the 3c of one of the variants (FIPV-UCD12). Four additional unrelated cats (392312, 384062 and 388210) from Paradise, Menlo Park, and San Jose, CA, respectively, and Cat-T from Mountlake Terrace, WA were included in the study. The three cats seen at the VMTH suffered from the non-effusive form of FIP, while the Washington state cat died of effusive FIP. The E, M, N, 3a-c and 7a, b genes were amplified from the omentum or organ granulomas of all four animals. Viruses were readily detected in the diseased tissues of cats 388210, 388406, Cat-T, and 392312 and designated FIPV-UCD15 to UCD18, respectively (Table 1) . FIPV-UCD15a possessed a two-nucleotide deletion near the end of the 3c gene and a second deletion of 48nucleotide involving the terminus of 3b and beginning of 3c ( Figure 2 ). Mutations of the 3c gene in FIPV-UCD16 and -UCD17 involved premature stop codons. Two variants with six scattered SNPs and an identical deletion in the 3c genes were identified in organ granulomas of cat 392312 and designated FIPV-UCD18a and -UCD18b (Table 1 ). All of the structural and accessory genes that were sequenced for the eight different FIP cats appeared to be intact, except for the 3c genes. The 3c genes from all eight isolates contained deletions or SNPs that either produced truncating frame shifts or premature stop codons ( Figure 2 ). The sequence relationship of the four unrelated FIPV isolates to each other and to the FIPV isolates from the four related Scottish Fold cats is shown in Figure 1 . The overall genetic similarity for the E, M, N, and 3a-c, 7a, b genes ranged from 89-99% among the 8 FIPV isolates. The four FIPVs from unrelated cats showed sequence identity of 89-92% to each other and to the FIPVs from the four related cats.",

            "text": "This study of lesional and/or fecal coronaviruses from nine cats both supported and modified the previous conclusions of Vennema et al. [17] . Viruses from diseased tissues from all eight cats in this study had truncating mutations, either in the form of deletions leading to frame shifts or coding changes causing premature stop codons in the 3c gene. Such damaging mutations were not present in other accessory and structural genes in this or in a previous study [17] . As with the earlier study [17] , all or almost all of the fecal isolates from diseased cats and a healthy contact control animal had intact 3c genes. Taken as a whole, the present study supported a role for deleterious 3c gene mutations in the genesis of FIPVs from FECVs. However, not all FIPV isolates have deleterious 3c gene mutations. Although 8/8 (100%) of lesional isolates in the present study had functional mutations in their 3c genes, only 11/13 (85%) of the FIPVs reported by Vennema et al. [17] had deliterious 3c gene mutations. We have also recently observed what appeared to be intact 3c genes in 12/31 random breed cats that were adopted from a large shelter in Northern California and died of FIP. However, several of these isolates contained mutated 3c genes as minor variants, and without animal inoculation studies it is not possible to say whether or not these or the remaining isolates were capable of causing FIP. The existence of helper/defective virus replication in the latter situation also needs to be considered. Animal inoculation studies to determine the biotype of a given feline coronavirus are critical for determining the ultimate biotype of any isolate, regardless of its sequence regularities or irregularities. It was therefore important to demonstrate herein that an isolate from the four related cats reported herein was capable of causing FIP.",

            "text": "Since some FIPVs appear to have intact 3c genes, it may be premature to ascribe the FIP biotype solely to deleterious mutations in the 3c gene. However, what are the alternatives? It can be argued that mutations in the conserved replicase/transcriptase genes may have a similar effect; that small mutations in other structural and accessory genes, collectively or singly, will have the same effect; that FIPV and FECV are identical viruses; or that deleterious 3c gene mutations are an effect of the disease and not its cause. Involvement of the replicase/transcriptase genes is unlikely, because the replicase/transcriptase region is highly conserved among feline coronaviruses and unlikely to be involved in cell tropism or evasion of the host's immune response. One study of a natural serotype I FIPV isolate (C1Je) showed a high degree of sequence conservation within the replicase/transcriptase genes compared to other feline coronaviruses, while a premature stop codon limited the 3c gene product to the first 16 amino acids [19] . It is also unlikely that mutations in other accessory or structural genes are involved, even though such mutations have been frequently found in feline coronaviruses. Firstly, 3c gene mutations in FIPVs occur significantly out of proportion to mutations in other structural or accessory genes. Secondly, there is little scientific evidence, especially based on animal inoculation, that other accessory genes are involved in FIP. In the original report that proposed the internal mutation theory, 11/13 of the FIPVs had 3c mutations, while 2/13 isolates had only 7b mutations [17] . However, both of the latter cats were related and had been experimentally infected with an identical FECV (FECV-RM); a third sibling cat from this group had the same 7b mutation but with a unique functional 3c mutation. Variants were not tested at the time and it is possible that 3c mutants would have been present if the two discordant isolates had been adequately sequenced. Earlier studies have also demonstrated an absence of 7b mutations in almost all FECVs and other FIPVs and indicate that such mutations are most likely tissue culture artifacts [17, 20] . Yet other studies suggest that 7a and 7b mutations occur in nature in both FIP and enteric infections and are therefore not directly linked to pathogenicity [20, 21, 23] .",

The evidence that FECVs and FIPVs cause very different diseases is strong [10] [11] [12] [13] . Even though environmental and host factors are admittedly important in FIP [29, 30] , lesional viruses from the eight FIP cats in this study, even though highly related to fecal isolates, were easily differentiated from each other based on deliterious 3c gene mutations alone. Moreover, an infectious inoculum made from the diseased omentum of one of the FIP cats induced FIP in 3 of 12 cats that were experimentally infected (see section 2.2.).

The infecting variant may have been merely the first virus into a macrophage, or its selection may have involved more complex host/virus interactions. We also found that subtle, and sometimes significant, genetic mutations (usually SNPs and deletions) occurred upon primary replication in a new host. Therefore, genetic variation among feline coronaviruses occurs both within and between host cats. Selective infection with a single variant can also rapidly lead to genetically distinct clades of coronavirus, especially when combined with a high intrinsic and extrinsic mutation rate.",

The S (one cat) and E, M, N and 3a-c, 7a, b genes (all three cats) were sequenced. One of the cats was found to be infected with FIPV-UCD11a, while two of the cats were each infected with FIPV-UCD11b. Each of these cats had a nearly identical variant of UCD-11a or UCD-11b in its diseased omentum ( Table 4 ). The premature stop codon of parental 3c gene was preserved in FIPV isolates from all three cats. However, FIPV-UCD11b.2 isolated from one of the three cats had acquired two additional large deletions affecting both the 3b and 3c genes that were not in the infecting virus (Table 4 and Figure 2 ).

The genes that were sequenced, their mutability, degree of relatedness to the consensus sequence of FIPV-UCD11a, b, and nature of the functional mutation in the 3c gene are given for each cat. It is important to determine by animal inoculation studies the true biotype of a feline coronavirus that is being reported, rather than always referring to a generic feline coronavirus [reviewed in 11] . Feline coronaviruses that possess the FIP biotype, such as FIPV-UCD11a,b, will readily induce FIP in from 25-100% of infected individuals, depending on the strain being tested [reviewed in 11]. However, bonifed (cat-to-cat passaged, non-tissue culture adapted) FECV strains will rarely induce FIP in healthy cats [9, 12, 15, 17 ].",

            "text": "The present study adds to our knowledge of genetic drift among feline coronaviruses that inhabit the same cat, multi-cat household, cattery, or geographically distant region. All of the FIPVs and FECVs isolated from the five cats that had close contact with each other in Sonoma, California were \u226599% related (Tables 1 and 3; Figure 1 ). Based on gene sequences and historical facts, it can be reasonably concluded that cat Simba was infected with an FECV following contact with cat Lucy. This supported another correlate of the internal mutation theory; FECVs are easily spread cat-to-cat, while FIPVs are not. Addie et al. [33] also noted that the same strain of coronavirus tended to persist among any given group of cats. However, coronaviruses within a closely housed group of cats, and even within the same cat, undergo continuous genetic drift. We observed sequence differences of 1-2% or less in cats from the same group, while genetic drift between cats from distant areas of the western US was on the order of 6-16%. Herewegh et al. [34] also found that feline coronaviruses from individuals within the same environment had unique genetic fingerprints and fell within the same clade, while geographically distant isolates belonged to genetically unique clades. The notable mutational drift observed among feline coronaviruses across geographic regions, in the face of genetic conservation within stable groups of cats, is paradoxical. However, the evidence indicates that coronavirus infection in any group of cats originates from a single founder virus, that virtually every cat in a group is infected rapidly and efficiently, and that cats appear to resist superinfection with closely related strains [34] . The single founder virus effect was confirmed in the present study (Table 4) . Thus, marked genetic drift occurs when a single coronavirus strain is serially passed from one susceptible population to the next. This scenario was supported by our animal transmission studies; when cats were simultaneously infected with two closely related variants of FIPV, each variant segregated into different cats. Therefore, minor mutants may become predominate when passed cat-to-cat.",

Similar to the S protein comparison, the 3a sequence of all four FIPVs from the related cats shared 98-100% sequence identity to each other, and 84-94% sequence identity to the four FIPVs from unrelated cats and from published serotype I FIPVs ( Figure  3 ).

The general belief is that enteric biotypes are compartmentalized to the gut, while FIP biotypes are found only within internal organs [19] . However, viruses with 3c mutations identical to FIPVs from lesional tissues were present in the feces of some cats in this study (Table 3) , thus making horizontal transmission theoretically possible in certain circumstances. There is also evidence that FIPV may have been shed in urine of FIPV infected cats [35] , and that coronavirus may be present in the blood, especially among younger cats [36] . There are also several reports of FIP outbreaks of sufficient magnitude and acuteness to suggest horizontal transmission [reviewed in 11] . While this study did not answer the question as to the relative importance of vertical and horizontal transmission, it indicated the need to carefully study fecal and lesional virus isolates that are involved in explosive, large scale, epizootics of FIP and not just the common enzootic form. amount of sequence homology among this protein, the similarities in their hydropathy profiles, both to each other and to the corresponding M proteins, as well as to the SARS-CoB 3a protein, are quite remarkable. Nothing is known about these proteins, but it is clear that it will be interesting to learn more about their biological features.\" A great deal of research has been reported, and is being conducted, on the SARS coronavirus 3a gene and protein and it is evident that this gene and its product play an important role in viral assembly, spread and pathogenesis, as well as to protective immunity [38] [39] [40] .

            "text": "The ubiquitous form of feline coronavirus is readily passed cat-to-cat by the fecal-oral route and is the cause of a mild or unapparent enteritis. Like coronaviruses in general, feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) is undergoing constant mutation within its accessory and structural genes. Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), which is a highly fatal systemic disease, is a sequel of FECV infection in a small proportion of cats. The virus isolated from the diseased tissues of cats with FIP is highly related to the FECV identified in the feces. Although SNP and deletion mutations were common between isolates from the same cat, only the 3c gene was rendered non functional by such mutations. Deleterious mutations in 3c tend to be found in diseased internal tissues, while viruses with intact 3c are found mainly in the feces. While deleterious mutations of the 3c gene were seen in all 8 FIP cats in this study, and in virtually all previously reported FIPVs, they are by no means a universal finding. However, there is compelling evidence that when they do occur, they are the cause of FIP and not an effect of the disease. Deleterious 3c gene mutants will readily cause FIP when inoculated into laboratory cats, whereas their largely non-pathogenic fecal counterparts with intact 3c genes are readily transmitted from one cat to another. These gene 3c mutants, when they occur, are unique to each cat with FIP, indicating that they arise independently in each host and not by mutation in one cat with subsequent horizontal spread to others. Several minor variants can co-exist in both tissues and feces and when two variants are inoculated together into the same cat, one or the other, but not both, will predominate. The high mutability of feline coronaviruses leads to minor genetic differences between cats in one closely contained geographic area, while significant genetic differences are seen between isolates from geographically disparate regions. More in depth studies on the function of the feline coronavirus 3c gene will be important for determining its precise role in FIP.",

Moreover, the 3c protein of feline coronavirus also has an identical hydrophillicity profile to its own M protein and to the M and 3a proteins of SARS coronavirus [37] .
