Due to the algebraic complexity of the resulting expressions, even under the assumption of independence, we once again use MAPLE for evaluation purposes. This also comes with the benefit that we may easily exploit Laplace transforms of pdfs in order to evaluate the pdf of each A j (j > 1), via the product of the Laplace transforms of the individual pdfs which follows from our assumption of independence.
