Although the mortality does not reach the levels reported in the developing world, there is significant morbidity and financial burden associated with pneumonia. In the United States it is second only to injuries as the most common reason for hospitalization in children <18 years of age (National Center for Health Statistics, 2011), with recent data reporting an overall incidence of 15.7 cases per 10,000 children and an incidence of 62.2 cases per 10,000 children under the age of two (Jain et al., 2015) .",

First, a specific etiology is not identified in many cases (Wubbel et al., 1999; Juv\u00e9n et al., 2000; Toikka et al., 2000; Moulin et al., 2001; Korppi, 2004; Michelow et al., 2004; Don et al., 2005) , making targeted therapy difficult. Additionally, the clinical features of CAP are variable and may overlap with other respiratory diseases, such as asthma or bronchiolitis (Margolis and Gadomski, 1998; Lynch et al., 2004) . This makes appropriate triage of children with CAP problematic in many cases, and there are currently no reliable tools to objectively classify patients according to disease severity, or to predict which patients will develop complications or need a higher level of care. In fact, guidelines for the diagnosis and management of CAP in children propose a number of areas for future research, including definition of risk factors for respiratory failure and hospitalization, and development of new diagnostic tests, not only to determine the etiology of CAP but to assess disease severity and response to therapy (Bradley et al., 2011) .",

A number of studies conducted in febrile children with bacterial and viral infections showed that transcriptional profiles can differentiate viral from bacterial infections with up to 90% accuracy (Ramilo et al., 2007; Herberg et al., 2016; Mahajan et al., 2016) . Regardless, another potential application of transcriptional profile biomarkers in the clinical setting is the ability to help assess disease activity or disease severity in an objective manner (Chaussabel et al., 2008; Mejias et al., 2013) . Molecular distance to health (MDTH) is a novel metric tool, which provides a single numeric score that summarizes the global perturbation of the transcriptional profile of each patient compared to healthy controls as the reference standard (Pankla et al., 2009) . It has been shown to accurately classify the severity of the disease in patients with bacterial sepsis (Pankla et al., 2009) , staphylococcal infections (Banchereau et al., 2012) , as well as in children with respiratory viral infections (Mejias et al., 2013; Heinonen et al., 2016) . Our hypothesis was that transcriptional profiling, specifically the MDTH score, would serve as an accurate biomarker of disease severity in children hospitalized with CAP.",

Briefly, transcripts were first selected if they were present in at least 10% of all samples and had a minimum of two-fold expression change compared with the median intensity across all samples. Transcripts that passed this filter were then included in the quality control (QC) gene list used for downstream analyses. First, we conducted class comparisons (comparative analyses between predefined sample groups). For these analyses, each of the 3 pathogen-detection groups: (1) pyogenic bacteria, (2) M. pneumoniae (without respiratory viruses for the purpose of class comparisons), and (3) respiratory viruses was compared separately with the healthy control group, using Mann-Whitney (p < 0.01) with Benjamini-Hochberg multiple test correction and \u22651.25 fold change in expression level relative to the control group (Berry et al., 2010; Mejias et al., 2013) . The goal of these initial analyses was to identify genes that were significantly differentially expressed in these three groups of patients with CAP compared with healthy controls, which will aid in the calculations of the MDTH scores. Next, we calculated the MDTH scores, a metric that converts the global transcriptional perturbation measured in each patient sample into a numeric value that can be incorporated into analyses of clinical variables. This analysis consists in comparing the expression values of all significantly differentially over and underexpressed genes and the fold difference of their expression values (MDTH score) from each individual pneumonia patient vs. the median values of healthy controls as a reference, as previously described (Pankla et al., 2009; Berry et al., 2010; Banchereau et al., 2012; Mejias et al., 2013) .

The combination of these genes derived from pair-wise comparisons resulted in a total of 6,726 genes differentially expressed in children with CAP with detection of any of these pathogens (Figure 3) . While 952 (15%) genes were shared among all pathogen groups, 2,191 (35%) were specific to pyogenic bacteria, 651 (10%) were specific to respiratory viruses, and 327 (5%) were specific to M. pneumoniae. This gene list of 6,726 genes was then used to calculate the MDTH scores. MDTH scores were significantly higher in all pneumonia groups when compared with healthy controls (p < 0.0001; Table 1 ). Children with detection of pyogenic bacteria had higher MDTH, CRP, and PCT values than those with detection of respiratory viruses (p < 0.05, p < 0.01, and p < 0.001, respectively) or M. pneumoniae detected alone (p < 0.01, p < 0.001, and p < 0.0001, respectively), as well as higher CRP and PCT than children in the no pathogen detection group (p < 0.05 and p < 0.001, respectively). Additionally, children with MDTH scores above the median value (MDTH >1,747) were more likely to be prescribed a course of antibiotics than those with MDTH scores at or below the median (95 vs. 78%; p = 0.004). White blood cell counts at the time of admission to the hospital were not different among groups and did not correlate with any clinical marker of disease severity, including days of respiratory support, days of fever after hospitalization, or LOS. However, CRP (r = 0.39; p < 0.0001), PCT (r = 0.39; p < 0.0001), and MDTH (r = 0.24; p = 0.003), all measured on admission, correlated with days of fever after hospitalization (Supplemental Figure 1) . In univariate analyses, only MDTH scores measured on admission correlated with LOS (n = 152; r = 0.33, p < 0.0001; Figure 4 ).",

            "text": "Previous studies have shown the potential value of transcriptional profiling and the MDTH score for assessment of disease severity in a number of infections, in both adults and children. Most of those studies included patients infected by a single bacterial (i.e., melioidosis, S. aureus, tuberculosis) or viral (RSV, rhinovirus) pathogen (Pankla et al., 2009; Berry et al., 2010; Banchereau et al., 2012; Mejias et al., 2013) . However, its application in the context of pediatric CAP caused by a variety of respiratory pathogens has not been evaluated previously. In the present study, we identified a transcriptional score (MDTH score), that significantly correlated with inflammatory markers, such as WBC, CRP, and PCT, and was independently associated with disease severity as defined by duration of hospitalization in children with CAP, regardless of the pathogen or pathogens detected using current microbiologic diagnostic assays.. Severity scoring systems have been validated for adults with lower respiratory tract infection (Neill et al., 1996; Fine et al., 1997; Lim et al., 2003; Capelastegui et al., 2006) but such tools are lacking for children evaluated in the developed world. Welldefined criteria for hospitalization of children with CAP have been recommended in guidelines (Bradley et al., 2011) , but there is also a subjective component. A recent study from the United States showed promising results in using risk models, combining patient, laboratory, and radiographic characteristics, to predict severe pneumonia in children, but these have yet to be validated prospectively in larger cohorts (Williams et al., 2016) . Multiple studies have suggested a limited role for inflammatory markers, such as peripheral WBC count, CRP, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and PCT, in the diagnosis and management of pneumonia in children. It is difficult to define a cut-off for any of these values that is both sensitive and specific. In a study of 100 children with CAP, Don et al reported higher PCT levels in hospitalized patients compared to outpatients, but there was no further description of these values as related to disease severity (Don et al., 2007) . More recently, lower PCT values were associated with a reduced risk of detection of pyogenic bacteria in a large cohort of children with pneumonia in the U.S. (Stockmann et al., 2017) Michelow et al examined levels of 15 cytokines in 55 children with CAP and found that only IL-6 correlated with indicators of disease severity (Michelow et al., 2007) . Esposito and colleagues evaluated the role of a PCT-based algorithm to guide antibiotic therapy in children with mild/moderate CAP (Esposito et al., 2011) and showed that application of this algorithm was associated with reduced antibiotic use. It will be important to evaluate this PCT-based algorithm in children with severe disease. Accurate and rapid identification of children at higher risk of morbidity is needed to allow improved and more objective assessment of the need for hospitalization, faster initiation of appropriate antimicrobial therapy, and ultimately improved clinical outcomes.",

First, it includes patients with a broad range of ages, increasing the generalizability of the results and highlighting the potential impact of the MDTH score in the pediatric population. Second, all patient samples were obtained within 24 h of hospitalization, reducing the potential influence of the time of sample collection. Finally, we did not limit our analysis to one specific pathogen or class of pathogens. While previous studies primarily focused on infection due to a single organism, we focused on a clinical syndrome with many etiologic agents. Thus, in addition to variability in clinical presentation and duration of illness prior to hospitalization, there was heterogeneity in the etiology of CAP. However, despite these factors, we were still able to show an association between the MDTH score and more traditional markers of inflammation, and most notably with the duration of hospitalization.",

            "text": "The study also has limitations. First, complete microbiologic data are lacking in some patients. Furthermore, the fact that current methods for bacterial detection are suboptimal, and although patients were classified according to the type of pathogen detected, we suspect that the pathogen groups may include misclassified patients. This is especially true in the group of patients with virus detected only, as this group may include patients with viral-bacterial coinfections. It should be mentioned, however, that the goal of the present study was not the diagnosis of specific pathogens or discrimination between bacterial and viral etiologies but rather the identification of a biomarker to objectively assess disease severity. Another potential limitation is that healthy controls were not comprehensively tested for respiratory pathogens, although children with current or history of respiratory symptoms within 2 weeks were excluded from the healthy control group. Additionally, analyses were not corrected for duration of illness prior to hospitalization, which may have caused variability in the MDTH scores within pathogen groups. Nevertheless, this could also be considered a strength of the study; because, despite the variability in duration of symptoms observed when managing children with CAP in clinical practice, we were able to identify an objective score to classify patients according to disease severity. Our cohort only included hospitalized patients in a single center in central Ohio, so future studies including ambulatory and hospitalized children from diverse geographic locations are warranted. Even at a single institution, discharge criteria were not standardized during the majority of the study period. Therefore, practice variability among individual clinicians may have influenced the duration of hospitalization. Finally, we did not obtain samples directly from the lower respiratory tract as only a minority of patients required invasive ventilator support and thus data from peripheral blood may not reflect immune response at the primary site of infection. Notwithstanding, using blood samples to measure the host response to respiratory pathogens and calculate the MDTH score will facilitate implementation in the clinical setting.",
