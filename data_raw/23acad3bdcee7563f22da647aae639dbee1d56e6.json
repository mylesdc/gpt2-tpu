With time, this problem will only become more severe as population density in urban centers grows. Social interactions play a very important role in determining how infectious diseases spread, and organization of people along social lines gives rise to non-spatial networks in which the infections spread. Infection networks are different for diseases with different transmission modes, but are likely to be identical or highly similar for diseases that spread the same way. Hence, infection networks estimated from common infections can be useful to contain epidemics of a more severe disease with the same transmission mode. Here we present a proof-of-concept study demonstrating the effectiveness of epidemic mitigation based on such estimated infection networks. We first generate artificial social networks of different sizes and average degrees, but with roughly the same clustering characteristic. We then start SIR epidemics on these networks, censor the simulated incidences, and use them to reconstruct the infection network. We then efficiently fragment the estimated network by removing the smallest number of nodes identified by a graph partitioning algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this targeted strategy, by comparing it against traditional untargeted strategies, in slowing down and reducing the size of advancing epidemics.",

Besides their social and healthcare impacts, severe infectious disease outbreaks also present an important burden to the economy through the decrease in productivity and high cost of treatment. As denser populations promote faster spreading, this problem can only grow in severity and magnitude with the increasing world population density. Motivated by this, many works have been done to predict [1, 2] or even contain [3] [4] [5] [6] the spread of severe epidemics.

In particular, we believe that severe respiratory infections such as H1N1 and SARS share an infection network similar to that of the less severe common cold. Hence, infection network inferred from the latter can be useful in controlling rare outbreaks of the former. Estimating the infection network from common infections has the advantage of a large volume of daily incidences. As we will show in the Results section, the volume of incidences data gathered is critical in getting accurate estimation of the network.",

This can be done by targeting nodes that play important roles in the network (i.e. the 'hubs'), and the 'backbones' connecting one hub to another.",

This strategy involves estimating the infection network of a severe disease using incidences data from common infections sharing the same infection network, and fragmenting the network into disconnected pieces using a graph partitioning method. To test the proposed strategy in principle, we first generate artificial social networks of different sizes but with roughly the same clustering characteristics to serve as our infection networks. Then we simulate multiple SIR epidemics on the networks to play the role of common infections circulating in society. We apply censorships on the incidence data collected to emulate the low reporting rates of common infections, and use the censored incidences to construct estimates of the original infection networks. To mitigate new epidemics, we fragment the estimated infection networks. To do this, we apply a graph partitioning method on the estimated networks to identify the smallest sets of nodes that, when removed, will efficiently break the networks up into isolated pieces. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of this targeted strategy by comparing against traditional untargeted methods. While each of the problems has been studied independently (see for example [8, 18] for network reconstruction and [19] [20] [21] [22] for graph partitioning), to the best of our knowledge no work has been done applying both methods to control epidemics.",

The average degree of the network (average number of links per node) is given by SkT~2 m N . At each time step, we select n m pairs of nodes that have at least one mutual friend. This is done by first picking n m intermediate nodes at random, before choosing two neighbours of each to become the pairs. In addition to this, we choose n r other pairs of nodes uniformly at random, with n m .n r . For every pair that is not already connected, we form a new link between them provided that both nodes have not reached the maximum number of friends L. At the end of each time step, we randomly break r existing links to simulate the friendship decay. We then calculate the clustering coefficient c of the network using the method by Schank and Wagner [29] . After the clustering coefficient stops increasing and only fluctuates about a time-independent long-run average, we say the network has converged and stop the simulation. As expected, the clustering coefficients of the converged networks are much higher than c R & SkT N for random networks with the same N and ,k..",

To improve the accuracy of our estimated network, all tentative links are introduced with a weight of w = 1.00. Thereafter, the weight of all links decay by Dw = 20.01 every time step. Tentative links are removed when their weights fall to zero. In the above example, the links (5, 9) , (4, 5) , (5, 11) , (5, 13) , (4, 8) , (8, 11) , (8, 13) are introduced at t = 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, and so when the epidemics end at t = 4, their weights would be 0.97, 0.98, 0.98, 0.98, 0.99, 0.99, 0.99 respectively. We then repeat the estimation over more SIR epidemics. In subsequent epidemics, if an existing estimated link is reactivated, it is reinforced by adding Dw = 1.00 to its weight. We expect the algorithm to produce mostly wrong links at first. However, as the weights are decaying with time, most of the wrongly-estimated links will disappear at the end, because they will not consistently appear in the estimation process. On the other hand, correctly-estimated links tend to get constantly reinforced over multiple epidemics. Hence, we expect the population of correctly-estimated links to increase over time. More importantly, we note that existing estimation can always be further refined by incorporating new incidence data as and when they become available.",

This is why we need to accumulate information from successive epidemics to make consistent and reliable estimates of the network links that participate in the transmission. In Figure 4b , we show the estimation accuracy as a function of the number of different SIR epidemics S used in the estimation with 50% censor rate.

Figure 4a suggests that the estimation accuracy goes to zero at censor rate C T ,100%. This implies that it might be difficult to do network estimation in the US, where censor rates for mild illnesses are close to 100% because of the expensive medical insurance and co-payments. However, we stand a better chance of making the scheme work in Singapore as the low medical cost and the necessity to obtain medical certificates to stay away from work promote doctor consultations even for mild symptoms. To further improve the accuracy, the incidence data can be easily complemented with other types of relevant data. For instance, cell-phone and GPS co-location information can be used to rule out a large proportion of tentative links connecting pairs of individuals that have never been found in the same location over the infection time step of about three days.

Assuming there are six epidemics a year, the estimation above will take a much shorter time of 17 years in this country.

To put this into the proper context, we highlight two most important features that characterize severe epidemics: (1) the large number of cases that emerges in relatively short time (surge in hospital load), and (2) the fast propagation of the disease as compared to treatment time and development of cure. We will discuss how the proposed mitigation method addresses these two problems.",

Lack of medical attention and insufficient resources (medics, vaccines, and healthcare apparatus) might delay the recovery process and result to a higher number of casualties than need be. This is why it is important for an epidemic mitigation strategy to consider peak load reduction as a primary goal. Delaying the peak infection time, thus stretching the overall time scale of the epidemic, is also crucial. When dealing with a deadly epidemic caused by a new infection agent, chances are we would not have vaccine at hand, or even a vaccine development program. As development of vaccines and drugs for new diseases can only begin after cases have been confirmed and analyzed, the race against the epidemic to develop and administer such drugs would be inevitable. Delaying the progress of the epidemic will not only buy time for drug development, but will also give governments more time in general to implement other crisis handling measures.",

Mitigation measures applied at the start of epidemic is ideal but may not be practical. Hence, good performance when applied late into the epidemic is critical for a mitigation method to be successful. Figure 5b hints at a the promising potential our proposed targeted strategy can offer in this regard, where significant reductions of the peak infection rate and the total number of infected people are observed even when applied late into the epidemic. However, the result also suggests that early implementation is critical in slowing down the epidemic.",

In a country like the US, this strategy is unlikely to be adopted no matter how well it is shown to work in simulation due to privacy concerns when we selectively isolate individuals according to EGP. However, the proposed strategy may find a more receptive audience in a country like Singapore, given that home quarantine orders have been issued by the Ministry of Health during the SARS and H1N1 outbreaks. Here we must stress that node removals as suggested by EGP need not be home quarantine or any other physical isolation practices. If early vaccine stocks are available but limited, the EGP nodes should be the ones to receive it, because of the role they play in disease transmission. We must nevertheless be wary that this procedure should not be used as a mean of discrimination.",

            "text": "Finally, we highlight a crucial difference of the proposed method to traditional strategies. Unlike conventional quarantine, this intervention involves isolating healthy individuals from the rest of the infection network. At first this might sounds absurd: ''Why isolate healthy people and not the infected ones?'' From network point of view, however, the reason is clear: by isolating these people we are intercepting the path of an ongoing epidemic. As comparison, it is a standard practice in controlling forest fire to cut or burn down trees ahead of advancing fire to contain it. For infectious diseases no one has imagined this intervention possible, but with an estimated infection network our proof-of-concept results are impressive. If all nodes on the entire estimated network are isolated, the results are even more impressive: for our N = 10,000 network with ,k. = 10, we find propagating epidemics in only 60% of the simulations. In these propagating epidemics, the epidemic peak with intervention is less than 1/10 the epidemic peak without intervention, while the total number of infections with intervention is 1/3 that without intervention. Also, instead of peaking at t = 12 and ending at t = 20 without intervention, the epidemic peaks at t = 28 and ends at t = 60 with intervention. In terms of actual durations, removing all nodes on the estimated network stretches two-month epidemics to over half a year. However, about 1/4 of the population needs to be isolated, compared to only about 9% of the population for EGP intervention. A separate systematic study will be necessary to understand how effective and efficient this more aggressive intervention strategy can be.",

We used computer simulations to study and show the effectiveness of the method. First, we followed the intuitive JGN method to generate artificial social network of various sizes but with roughly the same clustering characteristic to serve as the infection networks. We then simulated SIR epidemics on the artificial infection networks, recorded the incidences, and applied censorship with rates between 50% and 85% to mimic low reporting rates for mild infections. We then used the remaining incidence data to construct an estimate of the infection network using a modified JGN algorithm. We found that the estimation accuracy falls with increasing censor rate, average degree, and size of the network, but improves as more data from multiple epidemics are incorporated.",

We then immunized the same set of nodes on the actual infection network before simulating subsequent epidemics. We compared the effectiveness of the targeted strategy to an untargeted method that randomly isolates the same number of nodes, and showed that the former outperforms the latter in decreasing and delaying the peak of the epidemics, as well as reducing the total number of infections. We also applied the proposed strategy at different times after the epidemic has started and showed that it is still effective in decreasing the peak infection rate and total number of cases even when applied late into the epidemic. In particular, we demonstrated that the EGP based strategy is surprisingly effective in mitigating epidemics even when the estimated network is not very accurate. Through visualizing small network, we find that in spite of the large number of wrongly estimated links, the nodes appearing in the estimated network are concentrated along the backbones of the actual network and thus play important roles in the disease transmission.",
