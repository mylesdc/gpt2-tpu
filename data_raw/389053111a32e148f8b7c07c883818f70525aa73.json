Measurements of the fluorescence and light scattering from single particles in a microfluidic channel are used to determine the total particle number concentration and the microorganism number concentration in real-time. The system performance is examined by evaluating standard particle measurements with various sample flow rates and the ratios of fluorescent to non-fluorescent particles. To apply this method to real-time detection of airborne microorganisms, airborne Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, and Staphylococcus epidermidis cells were introduced into the micro-optofluidic platform via bioaerosol generation, and a liquid-type particle collection setup was used. We demonstrate successful discrimination of SYTO82-dyed fluorescent bacterial cells from other residue particles in a continuous and real-time manner. In comparison with traditional microscopy cell counting and colony culture methods, this micro-optofluidic platform is not only more accurate in terms of the detection efficiency for airborne microorganisms but it also provides additional information on the total particle number concentration.",

The Navier-Stokes equations were solved with Fick's law of diffusion to describe the dynamics and homogenization of the mixing process in the channel. Figure 1 (B-1,B-2) show the results of the CFD simulations and optical micrographs of the mixing of the sample and dye in the micro-mixer part. The numerical simulations show that the mixing of the two fluids was complete approximately 0.1-0.4 mm from the entrance of mixing zone with flow rate conditions for each fluid in the range 2.5-25 \u03bc L/h (simulation duration, ~72-180 ms) (Fig. S2 ). The mixing zone was 136.8 mm long and 50 \u03bc m wide. The residence time for mixing (and hence for the reaction between the sample and dye) was in the range 25-246 s for total flow rates in the range 5-50 \u03bc L/h. After passing through the mixing zone, the mixed sample fluid was focused horizontally using a dual sheath flow with sterilized distilled water (SDW) in the hydraulic focusing component (see Fig. 1 (A) ). The focused core flow was 7.5 \u03bc m wide, which is one-twentieth the width of the channel. This minimized variation in the optical signals among locations in the particle detection zone 30 . Figure 1 (C-1) shows a schematic diagram of real-time detection of target particles in the core flow, as well as the optical setup for continuous detection and signal quantification. A diode-pumped solid-state (DPSS) laser with a wavelength of 532 nm and an output power of 2.0 mW (CNI laser, Changchun, China) was coupled with a single-mode optical fiber (core diameter: 3.5 \u03bc m, cladding diameter: 125 \u03bc m). The laser beam was focused on the core fluid using an objective lens (RMS20x-PF; 20x/0.5; Thorlabs) located beneath the microfluidic channel (~7 \u03bc m beam spot size at full-width half-maximum). A highly sensitive multi-pixel photon counter (MPPC) (C10507-11-50U; Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu City, Japan) module was used to detect the SC and FL signals from the target particles. The particle FL was collected using the objective lens, and entered the MPPC via the optical long-pass filter and focusing lens. To bring the SC light from the particles, multi-mode optical fiber with a core diameter of 105 \u03bc m and a cladding diameter of 125 \u03bc m (Thorlabs) was carefully inserted into the channel with the axis of the fiber at 90\u00b0 to the direction of flow, and linked to the MPPC.",

Figure 2 shows the particle FL and SC signals with flow velocities in the range 1.42-14.3 mm/s. The FLPSL particle suspension (~1.45 \u00d7 10 3 /\u03bc L) was injected into sample inlet. The ratio of the flow rate of the FLPSL particle suspension to that of the SDW was 1:19 in the narrow core region (which had dimensions of 7.5 \u00d7 150 \u03bc m). As the flow velocity increased from 1.42 to 14.3 mm/s, the frequency of the particle SC and FL signals increased in proportion to the particle flow velocity, and the average intensity of the measured SC and FL signals (SC/FL) decreased from ~140 arbitrary unit (a.u.)/~60 a.u. to ~46 a.u./~30 a.u., respectively ( Fig. 2 (A) ). This is attributed to the decreased photon integration time of the photodetector with decreasing residence time of the particles in the detection zone of microchannel 41 . Figure 2 (B) shows that the event rate (i.e., number of counts per second) of the particle SC and FL signals followed a linear relationship with the particle flow velocity; for FL we have y = 1.04x + 0.37, with r 2 = 0.996, and for SC we have y = 1.07x + 0.52, with r 2 = 0.998.

The airborne particle collection efficiency of the BioSampler was ~94.3% for the 1-\u03bc m-diameter PSL particles (Fig. S5) . Figure 4 Samples containing the bacterial suspension were injected into the micro-optofluidic platform using a syringe pump to evaluate the device performance for the real-time detection of airborne bacterial particles.

The average SC/FL signal intensity ratios were ~555/240 for E. coli, ~565/227 for B. subtilis, and ~433/142 for S. epidermidis. Because of the size of these bacteria (i.e., 0.5 -1.6 \u03bc m), they may be considered to lie within the Mie scattering regime, and the intensity of the SC signals may be assumed to be proportional to the cross-sectional area of particles 36 . In the same manner, the FL signal intensity increased proportionally with the size of the bacteria because larger particles have a higher concentration of nucleic-acid fluorescent dye 33, 36 . The particle number concentration was determined based on the frequency data for the SC and FL signals. Table 2 lists the SC signal concentration, which corresponds to the total particle number concentration. This was higher than the FL signal concentration, which corresponds to the total concentration of microorganisms. The difference between the total particle count (SC signals) and the total bacterial concentration (FL signals) was ~7% for E. coli, ~16% for B. subtilis, and ~23% for S. epidermidis.

SU-8 (2025; Microchem Corp.), which is a negative photoresist, was spin-coated onto a 4.2-inch Si wafer. The photoresist was soft baked on a hotplate at 65 \u00b0C for 5 min, followed by 95 \u00b0C for 10 min. A chrome photomask pattern was installed using a UV aligner, and the photoresist was exposed to UV irradiation. Following this exposure, the resist was baked at 65 \u00b0C for 2 min and then at 95 \u00b0C for 10 min. The SU-8 photoresist pattern was developed using 1-methoxy-2-propyl acetate (Microchem Corp.) for 7 min. After completion of the developing process, the pattern was rinsed using isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and deionized (DI) water to yield a master mold. PDMS was poured over the developed wafer with the pattern, and cured in an oven at 65\u00b0C. The patterned PDMS channel was then removed from the wafer, and bonded onto glass using O 2 plasma to seal the microchannel. Fluorescence microscopy cell counting. To enumerate FLPSL particles and bacterial cells using the fluorescence microscopy method, 10-20 \u03bc L of sample (following enrichment via centrifugation in the case of low particle concentrations) was loaded into the sample injection area of a disposable hemocytometer (DHC-N01; INCYTO, Republic of Korea), and visualized using a fluorescence microscope (B X 51; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) with a U-MWG2 filter set; the excitation wavelength was in the range 510-550 nm, and the emission wavelength was > 590 nm. For each sample, images of at least 16 microscopic fields were captured using a CCD array camera. Microscopy cell counting was carried out using the ImageJ software package (http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/). Colony counting. Bacterial suspensions were serially diluted and spread onto the surface of nutrient agar (Becton Dickinson) in a petri dish, followed by incubation at 37\u00b0C for 24 hours. The resulting colonies were counted manually.",
