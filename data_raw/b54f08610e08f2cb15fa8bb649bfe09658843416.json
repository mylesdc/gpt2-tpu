One of the most used methods for exploring data is cluster analysis which refers to the unsupervised classification of patterns in data. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for performing cluster analysis of DNA sequences that is based on the use of GSP methods and the K-means algorithm. We also propose a visualization method that facilitates the easy inspection and analysis of the results and possible hidden behaviors. Our results support the feasibility of employing the proposed method to find and easily visualize interesting features of sets of DNA data.",

Therefore, other approaches for DNA clustering have been proposed based on the use of these similarity computation methods. Two of the most popular algorithms for clustering biological sequences are the CD-HIT (Li & Godzik, 2006) and the UCLUST (Edgar, 2010) . Both algorithms use a greedy approach for identifying representative sequences that can be used as a ''seed'' to group all of the sequences that have a similarity score above a certain threshold. However, the computational resources necessary to perform the multiple sequence alignments remain the main challenge which limits the number of sequences that can be clustered.",

It is remarkable that all of the Tracheophytan plants (green-edge squares) with the exception of Castor Oil tree R. communis are grouped in C-1 while the Chlorophyta plants (mostly Picoplanktons defined by green-edge circles) are grouped in C-6 along with other organisms. The formation of two separated groups for the plants may be explained by the fact that despite belonging to the same kingdom, these phyla share very little morphology (Simpson, 2006) .

Originally in k = 6, Picoplanktons were grouped together with other organisms, but isolated from the other plants.

We employed a CPU Intel XEON E5-1650 at 3.50 GHz with 16 GB RAM. 2 Table 1 list the processing time in seconds for the three methods for sets of 8, 17, 35, 70, and 141 sequences of COXI. The time required to transform the 141 sequences from strings of characters to their corresponding PSDs was 0.921 s and it is not considered in Table 1 since this is performed only one time. Note that the time required by STARS is significantly smaller with respect to ClustalW. UCLUST is time-constant at 1 s for every experiment, however, note that the number of clusters generated by this method was practically the same number of sequences (i.e., the method assigns a cluster to each sequence). This is because UCLUST requires a sequences identity range of at least 40% for amino acids and 65% for nucleotides (Edgar, 2010) . Table 2 list the processing times of five datasets of different number of sequences with different length where UCLUST generated a number of clusters different from one cluster for each sequence. Dataset A consisted of 31 sequences of Mammals with average length of 16,695 nucleotides labeled into to seven groups; Dataset B consisted of 38 sequences Note that the computational time required for performing the clustering of the sequences' PSD data is smaller when compared with UCLUST for the same number of clusters for datasets A, B, and D.

            "text": "In this work, we focused on the Mitochondrial Cytochrome C Oxidase Subunit I (COXI) coding gene as a marker to evaluate our approach for group clustering of relevant similar sequences. The COXI gene has been proposed as one of the most relevant marker genes for molecular taxonomy (Patwardhan, Ray & Roy, 2014) . While no single gene is even close to establishing the systematic classification of organisms, the COXI gene is one of the most closely related to the consensus evolutionary divergence. Therefore, it is important to wrap our results not as how the Catalogue of Life (Roskov et al., 2017) classification should become, but as how accurate our marker could be. The selection (COXI) was based on three criteria: (i) the marker must code for proteins since it has been already proven that these type of markers have steadier mutation rates, (ii) the marker should have already been employed in a wide range of the tree of life, at least for eukaryotes, and should be able to discriminate for the intended groups, and (iii) the marker should have a homogeneous length and have a minimum number of reported copies in the selected database, since both duplication events and large indels may bias new cluster formation. To rule out any bias in the clustering of organisms with respect to their downloaded sequences, we incorporated all of their stored copies. A possible expected result was that the clusters generated for each selected value of k would correspond to the organization depicted in Fig. 2 . However, since the K-means method promote the generation of centroids in highly populated regions of the feature space, it is more likely to obtain clusters of organisms that are highly related among them, instead of organisms related by possible common ancestors or groups with a small number of less homogeneous organisms (e.g., primates formed a cluster early in small k values and kept together at larger numbers of k).",

            "text": "The COXI gene is one of the most accepted general markers to establish divergence (Patwardhan, Ray & Roy, 2014) . It spans from Phylum to Class, and when using introns in selected species, it has been shown to properly classify Genera and Species (Zardoya & Meyer, 1996) . Our results were remarkably good in clustering up to the Family level by using only the coding region and without the need to pretreat or manually curate the sequences. Hebert, Ratnasingham & De Waard (2003) established a divergence rate from 0.01% to 64% with a median of 8% across a number of species on 11 Metazoan phyla. In that study, Arthropod (with the exception of Lepidoptera and Diptera class) and Plathelminth phyla displayed the greatest divergences, while Chordata showed the second lowest divergence. Our results showed high cohesiveness, particularly for Chordates, where they quickly established stable, compact clusters, predominantly with their own classes. Since the downloaded data for each phylum or class was not balanced, we had the opportunity to evaluate how the sequences are clustered in a real-life condition. For example, when sampling whole ecosystems (i.e., microbiomes), bacterial populations will not be balanced across their species, but will show predominant phylogenetic diversity toward certain groups. Our results show that our presented method is very sensitive to both, the relative abundance of tight clusters, and the K -number. Far from being a disadvantage, we found that changing the number of clusters in an experiment may provide new insights about the relationship between the various sequences.",

If this would be the case, K -Means clustering may be adapted to steps of low mutation rates before high mutation rate regions. COXI gene mutations spanning all of the sequence may increase the amount of spurious clustering due to converging hotspots.",

Despite such mishaps, the proposed method is capable of performing an analysis of relationships between multiple DNA sequences with minimum handling and without the need of sequence alignment, which results in less human and computational time compared to traditional methods. We tested this method with a number of markers (i.e., mammal mtDNA, influenza A virus, human rhinovirus, coronavirus, and bacterial genomes) previously employed for Fourier DNA spectra phylogenetic analysis (Hoang et al., 2015) , the results are shown in Supplemental Information 1 of this article. Briefly, most sequences evaluated under our method cluster properly and consistently with previous reports (Hoang et al., 2015) . Also consistent with COXI results, the most evident aspect is the tendency to prioritize division of heavily populated groups.",
