Compared with the historical data, the mortality rate of sows increased by 10.2% and the pregnancy rate dropped 0.6%. The affected sows were anorexic and their skin presented multifocal papules, plaques and superficial dermatitis. The manifestation of infected foetuses included weak, stillborn and mummified individuals. A new virus was isolated from these animals with the help of next-generation sequencing technology and was identified as porcine circovirus 3 (PCV3) [1] . PCV3 was subsequently widely detected in China, Korea, Brail and many other European countries including Poland, Italy, Spain, Denmark, Germany, and the United Kingdom [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] .",

The clinical symptoms and pathological changes of PCV3-infected pigs were highly similar to those of PCV2-infected pigs [7] . Given that the virus may be highly prevalent globally, an accurate laboratory diagnosic for rapid confirmation of PCV3 infection is needed. Recently, conventional loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assays and PCR-based diagnostic assays for PCV3 have been developed [8] [9] [10] . Real-time LAMP is a constant temperature amplification method carried out at 60-65\u00b0C, for which only a simple water bath is required. Real-time LAMP eliminates reverse transcription steps as well as PCR instrument cooling time, which shortens the amplification time. Adding a fluorescent DNA intercalating dye into the real-time LAMP reaction enables monitoring of a fluorescence amplification curve [11] . Compared to conventional LAMP assays, this method avoids visible error, enables quantitative detection and is more suitable for multi-sample analysis. Because of its simple reaction conditions and ease of use, the realtime LAMP method has been adapted for the detection and diagnosis of a variety of pathogens [12, 13] . In this study, a real time RT-LAMP assay was developed for the rapid diagnosic of PCV3.",

According to previous reports, the limit of detection of PCV3 was 1.73 \u00d7 10 2 copies/\u03bcL and 10 2 copies/\u03bcL with a SYBR Green-based real-time quantitative PCR assay and a TaqManbased real-time PCR assay, respectively [9, 10] . In this real-time LAMP study, the detection limit was only approximately 1 \u00d7 10 1 copies/\u03bcL. Both real-time LAMP and conventional PCR [1] were performed to demonstrate the presence of PCV3 DNA in samples as previously described [10] . The PCV3-positive rates detected by conventional PCR, real-time quantitative PCR and real-time LAMP were 26.60% (54/203) [10] , 86.70% (176/203) [10] , and 89.66% (182/203), respectively. Furthermore, the samples that were positive for PCV3 by the real-time LAMP assay but negative by the conventional PCR assay were confirmed by the nested PCR (S1) [14] . Positive PCR products were confirmed by sequencing (S2). These results demonstrate that the real-time LAMP assay was sufficient, accurate and reliable as a molecular diagnostic test for the detection of PCV3. Fig. 1 Sensitivity of the LAMP assay for PCV3. Ten-fold serial dilutions of plasmids containing a cloned fragment of the PCV3 capsid gene were used for the assay. Negative control, H 2 O. All reactions were performed in duplicate",

These viruses were classical swine fever virus (CSFV) C strain, foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) LG vaccine strain, porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV), porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus (PRRSV), and pseudorabies virus (PRV) [13, 15] .",

Double-distilled water was used as a negative control. The mixture was incubated at 63\u00b0C for 60 min and then heated at 80\u00b0C for 10 min to terminate the reaction. Finally the results were detected using a Thermostatic Fluorescence Detector (DEAOU-308C, Diao, Guangzhou, China) and are shown by the graph. Specificity of the method was determined using DNA templates of PCV2, PCV3, PRV and other swine viral cDNA samples from CSFV, FMDV, PEDV, and PRRSV. Ten-fold serial dilutions of pMD-18 T-cap were used to calculate the analytical sensitivity. The method was further evaluated using 203 clinical samples[10].H 2 O was used as template for mock samples. All reactions were performed in duplicate.
