            "text": "Loss-of-function mutations of SLC26A4/pendrin are among the most prevalent causes of deafness. Deafness and vestibular dysfunction in the corresponding mouse model, Slc26a4 2/2 , are associated with an enlargement and acidification of the membranous labyrinth. Here we relate the onset of expression of the HCO 3 2 transporter pendrin to the luminal pH and to enlargement-associated epithelial cell stretching. We determined expression with immunocytochemistry, cell stretching by digital morphometry and pH with double-barreled ion-selective electrodes. Pendrin was first expressed in the endolymphatic sac at embryonic day (E) 11.5, in the cochlear hook-region at E13.5, in the utricle and saccule at E14.5, in ampullae at E16.5, and in the upper turn of the cochlea at E17.5. Epithelial cell stretching in Slc26a4 2/2 mice began at E14.5. pH changes occurred first in the cochlea at E15.5 and in the endolymphatic sac at E17.5. At postnatal day 2, stria vascularis, outer sulcus and Reissner's membrane epithelial cells, and utricular and saccular transitional cells were stretched, whereas sensory cells in the cochlea, utricle and saccule did not differ between Slc26a4 +/2 and Slc26a4 2/2 mice. Structural development of stria vascularis, including vascularization, was retarded in Slc26a4 2/2 mice. In conclusion, the data demonstrate that the enlargement and stretching of non-sensory epithelial cells precedes luminal acidification in the cochlea and the endolymphatic sac. Stretching and luminal acidification may alter cell-to-cell communication and lead to the observed retarded development of stria vascularis, which may be an important step on the path to deafness in Slc26a4 2/2 mice, and possibly in humans, lacking functional pendrin expression.

Studies using this mouse model have revealed that key events in the etiology of deafness are an acidification and enlargement of the membranous labyrinth that includes a ,10-fold enlargement of the cochlear lumen [12, 13, 14, 10] . The enlargement of the cochlea lumen begins at embryonic day (E) 14.5, which is ,19 days before the onset of hearing at postnatal day (P) 12 [12, 13, 14] . The enlargement is the result of fluid secretion in the vestibular labyrinth that 'pumps up' the cochlea and a failure of fluid absorption in the endolymphatic sac that 'drains' the cochlea at this age [14] . The enlargement and the acidification spread the effect of lacking pendrin-expression from affecting solely pendrinexpressing cells themselves to affecting a multitude of other cells in the cochlea and vestibular labyrinth, thereby ultimately leading to a failure to develop proper hearing and vestibular function.",

            "text": "The question how lack of pendrin affects fluid transport in the embryonic inner ear is complicated by the fact that pendrin is expressed in multiple epithelial cell types that are located in small domains throughout the inner ear. Based on studies in adult mice, pendrin is expressed in the cochlea in outer sulcus and spiral prominence epithelial cells and in spindle cells of stria vascularis [15, 16] . Further, pendrin is expressed in the vestibular labyrinth in transitional cells of the saccule, utricle, and ampullae and in the mitochondria-rich cells of the endolymphatic sac [15, 16, 17] . The onset of pendrin expression and the onset of pH changes associated with a lack of functional pendrin are important toward an understanding of the role of pendrin in fluid transport. Thus, the first goal of the present study was to determine the onset of pendrin expression in different parts of the inner ear, including the cochlea, saccule, utricle, ampullae, and endolymphatic sac and to determine the onset of pH changes that occur in the cochlea and endolymphatic sac when functional pendrin expression is present or lacking.",

This displacement impairs mesenchymal-epithelial cell communication including cochlear thyroid hormone signaling, which is important for the early postnatal development of the cochlea. Disruption of cochlear thyroid hormone signaling in Slc26a4 2/2 mice leads to cochlear hypothyroidism in the early postnatal phase of development [13] . The enlargement of the cochlea lumen may not only disrupt communication between mesenchymal and epithelial cells but may also disrupt cell signaling between adjacent epithelial cells. Stretching of epithelial cells can be expected to lengthen diffusional distances, which would dampen or delay the arrival of diffusional signals. Normal cochlear development depends on cell-to-cell communication. Loss of cell-to-cell communication, i.e. due to lack of connexin 26 expression, leads to retarded development and failure to acquire hearing [18, 19, 20] . Impairment of cell signaling and disruption of proper orchestration of development may also be a cause for the failure to develop hearing and balance in mice and possibly in humans lacking pendrin expression.

In the cochlea, apical surface areas of strial marginal cells, outer sulcus epithelial cells, and Reissner's membrane epithelial cells were enlarged in Slc26a4 2/2 mice compared to Slc26a4 +/2 mice (Fig. 7A-C and I) . In contrast, apical surface areas of inner and outer hair cells were similar and not different between Slc26a4 +/2 and Slc26a4 2/2 mice (Fig. 7D and I). In the vestibular labyrinth, apical surface areas of transitional cells in the utricle and saccule were enlarged in Slc26a4 2/2 mice compared to Slc26a4 +/2 mice, however, similar to the cochlea, apical surface areas of hair cells did not differ between Slc26a4 +/2 and Slc26a4 2/2 mice (Fig. 7E-F and J) . The epithelium of the endolymphatic sac in Slc26a4 +/2 was heavily folded and included tubular protrusions, as shown in Fig. 4J . In contrast, the epithelium in Slc26a4 2/2 mice was planar due to cell stretching caused by the enlargement. Mitochondria-rich cells that expressed pendrin in Slc26a4 +/2 mice were distinguished from ribosome-rich cells in Slc26a4 +/2 and Slc26a4 2/2 mice by their dense actin expression near the apical membrane (Fig. 7G) . Cells oriented perpendicular to the optical path were selected for apical surface area measurements in Slc26a4 +/2 and Slc26a4 2/2 mice. Apical surface areas of mitochondria-rich and ribosomerich cells were found to be enlarged in Slc26a4 2/2 mice compared to Slc26a4 +/2 mice (Fig. 7J) .

At E14.5, connexin 26 was expressed in gap junction plaques in K\u00f6lliker's organ and in outer sulcus epithelial cells. The expression pattern at this age was similar in Slc26a4 +/2 and Slc26a4 2/2 mice ( Fig. 8A and B) . At E16.5, the region of connexin 26 expression in K\u00f6lliker's organ became distinct from the region of in outer sulcus epithelial cells ( Fig. 8C and D) . Cell height of outer sulcus epithelial cells was lower in Slc26a4 2/2 mice compared to Slc26a4 +/2 mice. This thinning of the epithelium is most likely due to stretching. The stretch-related reduction in the area of lateral approximation between epithelial cells was reflected in the staining pattern of connexin 26 that appeared concentrated toward the tight-junction complexes. At E18.5, connexin 26 expression was found in Slc26a4 +/2 and Slc26a4 2/2 mice in K\u00f6lliker's organ, in outer sulcus epithelial cells and in fibrocytes of the suprastrial region ( Fig. 9A and C) . Expression of Na + /K + ATPase was found in all epithelial lining the cochlea lumen (Fig. 9B) . The highest intensity of Na + /K + ATPase expression was found in stria vascularis. At P3, intense expressions of connexin 26 in basal cells and of Na + /K + ATPase in marginal cells of stria vascularis were found in Slc26a4 +/2 and Slc26a4 2/2 mice (Fig. 10A-D) .",

This difference is important, because the onset of pendrin expression in the endolymphatic sac at E11.5 coincides with the onset of H + ATPase expression [25] . H + ATPase, like pendrin, is expressed in the apical membrane of mitochondrialrich cells in the endolymphatic sac. The coincidental onset of expression suggests that both transporters form a functional unit that transports HCO 3 2 buffered H + across the apical membrane.",

This acidic pH was observed as early as E14.5, which is 3 days after the onset of pendrin and H + ATPase expression [25] (Fig. 5) . The finding of an acidic pH in the developing endolymphatic sac is consistent with measurements in the adult endolymphatic sac [26, 27, 28] . Interestingly, up to E15.5, which is 4 days after the onset of pendrin expression, no difference in the endolymphatic pH was found between Slc26a4 +/2 and Slc26a4 2/2 mice. It remains undetermined, whether this delay in luminal pH changes is due to compensatory mechanisms possibly consisting of a coupling between the rates of ATPase-mediated H + secretion and pendrin-mediated HCO 3 2 secretion. Alternatively, the delay in the appearance of luminal pH changes could be related to the enlarged luminal volume found in Slc26a4 2/2 mice or simply be a function of luminal pH buffering. Buffering of the luminal pH can be expected to be stronger in the endolymphatic sac compared to the cochlea since the endolymphatic sac, at least in adult animals, contains a higher concentration of proteins [29, 30, 31] .",

Closing of the utricular duct creates two independent fluid systems. One system consisting of the cochlea, saccule and endolymphatic sac and the other consisting of the utricle, ampullae and semicircular canals [32] . The observation that the cochlear lumen continues to increase after E16.5 suggests the presence of a local defect in fluid homeostasis leading to abnormally high rates of fluid secretion or abnormally low rates of fluid reabsorption [14] . Abnormally low rates of fluid absorption are conceivably due to an impairment of Na + reabsorption in Reissner's membrane epithelial cells. Reissner's membrane epithelial cells, analogous to principal cells in the renal cortical collecting duct, are engaged in Na + reabsorption via ENaC Na + channels and face a fluid compartment that is controlled in its pH and HCO 3 2 concentration by pendrin [33, 34] . Recent observations in the renal collecting duct suggest that a lower HCO 3 2 concentration reduces the abundance of ENaC Na + channel subunits [35] . How this mechanism works and whether it is present in the inner ear is unknown.",

Interestingly, non-sensory cells are stretched but sensory cells are not (Fig. 7) . This difference is most likely the result of differences in the epithelial rigidity.

The observation that loss of pendrin leads to a retarded development of stria vascularis including a retarded vascularization is consistent with an impairment of cell-to-cell communication. Structural differences between stria vascularis of Slc26a4 +/2 and Slc26a4 2/2 mice diminished at P7, however, oxidative stress and a reduced endocochlear potential have been found in Slc26a4 2/2 mice at P10 and stria vascularis undergoes degeneration at P30 including an invasion of macrophages [36, 37, 11] .

Lack of pendrin expression leads to epithelial cell stretching and luminal acidification, which may alter cell signaling to result in the observed retarded development of stria vascularis. Retarded development of stria vascularis and possibly of other non-sensory epithelial cells may be an important step on the path to deafness in Slc26a4 2/2 mice, and possibly humans, lacking functional pendrin expression.",
