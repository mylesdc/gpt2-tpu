Infections by Enterobacteriaceae producing metallo-\u03b2-lactamases (MBLs), e.g., New Delhi metallo-\u03b2-lactamase 1 (NDM-1) are very difficult to treat. Development of effective MBL inhibitors to revive the efficacy of existing antibiotics is highly desirable. However, such inhibitors are not clinically available till now. Here we show that an anti-Helicobacter pylori drug, colloidal bismuth subcitrate (CBS), and related Bi(III) compounds irreversibly inhibit different types of MBLs via the mechanism, with one Bi(III) displacing two Zn(II) ions as revealed by X-ray crystallography, leading to the release of Zn(II) cofactors. CBS restores meropenem (MER) efficacy against MBL-positive bacteria in vitro, and in mice infection model, importantly, also slows down the development of higher-level resistance in NDM-1-positive bacteria. This study demonstrates a high potential of Bi(III) compounds as the first broad-spectrum B1 MBL inhibitors to treat MBL-positive bacterial infection in conjunction with existing carbapenems.",

Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) have been categorized as one of the urgent threats by the Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC) and kill almost half of in-patients who get bloodstream infections from these bacteria 1 . As one of the resistance determinants, metallo-\u03b2-lactamases (MBLs), including imipenemases (IMPs), Verona integron-encoded metallo-\u03b2-lactamases (VIMs), and more recent New Delhi metallo-\u03b2-lactamases (NDMs), are Zn(II)-containing enzymes that activate a nucleophilic water to cleave the \u03b2-lactam ring, conferring onto bacteria the resistance to the last resort carbapenems and all other bicyclic \u03b2-lactams that are currently used [2] [3] [4] . In particular, NDM-1-positive bacteria cause various types of infections and have spread globally now in more than 70 countries 5 since its first detection in 2009 [6] [7] [8] . The geographic dissemination of NDM-1-related resistance raises great consternation because this resistance is highly transferable among many prevalent human pathogens, including Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas spp, and Acinetobacter spp 9 , and is usually accompanied by genes encoding other resistance determinants 10, 11 or even other carbapenemases 12 in those organisms, arming them with multiple resistance to almost all classes of antibiotics available. Currently, few therapeutic options are available to treat infection from these so-called \"superbugs\" 13 .",

Such combination therapies are currently used clinically to treat infection from serine-\u03b2-lactamases (SBLs)-positive bacteria e.g., Augmentin \u00ae (amoxicillin/clavulanate), Zosyn \u00ae (piperacillin/tazobactam), and recent Avycaz \u00ae (ceftazidime/ avibactam). However, up till now, no equivalent therapy is available for MBLs-positive bacterial infections, as no MBL inhibitor has been clinically approved and all clinically used SBL inhibitors are not effective toward MBLs 18 . It remains a significant challenge to design MBL inhibitors, particularly broad-spectrum MBL inhibitors, given the structural diversity and mechanistic complexities of MBLs 14 . Though chelation agents such as ethylenediamine-N,N,N\u2032,N\u2032-tetraacetate (EDTA) and aspergillomarasmine A 19 significantly inhibit MBLs, such indiscriminate chelating of Zn(II) might result in untoward effects on natural or endogenous metalloproteins that are critical for many biological functions 18 . Currently, most organic molecule-based MBL inhibitors, including pyridine dicarboxylates, thiol-derivatives, natural products, and even carbapenem analogs, are designed by mimicking the substrates of specific types of MBLs, and have been shown to reduce MBL activity of specific types both in vitro and in animal models 14, [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . However, it still remains questionable whether or when these inhibitors can be approved for clinical usage. Moreover, these inhibitors may readily encounter microbial resistance owing to rapid evolution of MBLs 21, 25 . Therefore, more effective therapeutic strategies are urgently needed.",

Moreover, CBS boosts the in vivo efficacy of \u03b2-lactam in murine peritonitis models. Crystallographic and biophysical studies demonstrate that Bi(III) compounds irreversibly inactivate NDM-1 by a unique mechanism, with one Bi(III) replacing two zinc ions in the active site. Cysteine (Cys208) at the active site is shown to play a pivotal role for the activity of Bi(III) compounds. Our studies strongly suggest that Bi(III) drugs or compounds might be repositioned or developed as the first broad-spectrum inhibitors of MBLs, in particular, class B1 MBLs.

The NDM-1-producing strain was confirmed to be resistant to a carbapenem, meropenem (MER) as judged by its minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 16 \u00b5g mL \u22121 , which is higher than the breakpoint value (>8 \u00b5g mL \u22121 ) for MER against Enterobacteriaceae defined by European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) 34 .

            "text": "We then investigated how Bi(III) compounds exerted their inhibitory activity. As shown in Fig. 2a , addition of Bi(III) (as Bi (NTA)) to apo-NDM-1 led to the appearance of an absorption band at 340 nm, which is characteristic for Bi-S ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) band. Its intensities increased, and then leveled off at a molar ratio of [Bi]/[protein] of 1, suggesting that each NDM-1 bound to one Bi(III) and a cysteine residue was involved in the binding. By fitting the titration curve with the Ryan-Weber nonlinear equation 35 , K d was calculated to be 10.95 \u03bcM. Taking into account of the binding between Bi(III) and NTA (log K a = 17.55), the apparent dissociation constant (K d ' ) was calculated to be 3.09 \u00d7 10 \u221217 \u03bcM. As there is only one cysteine (Cys208) at the active site, site-directed mutation of Cys208 to an alanine (as C208A) abolished the enzymatic activity by~80% under identical conditions, confirming the importance of this residue for the enzymatic activity 36 . Accordingly, CBS at IC 50 concentration exhibited much reduced inhibitory effect on NDM-1-C208A (Fig. 2b) . This phenomenon was also noted in the susceptibility test that MIC of MER against NDM-1-C208A producer remained unchanged even in the presence of 256 \u03bcg mL \u22121 CBS (Supplementary Table 3 ). In consistence with this, the binding capacity of NDM-1-C208A to Bi(III) was reduced significantly with only ca. 0.25 molar equivalents of Bi(III) bound to the mutant as revealed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). These results demonstrate that Cys208 in the active site plays a pivotal role on Bi(III) inhibition of NDM-1 activity. By using cellular thermal shift assay, a method to examine the changes in thermal stabilization of targeted protein upon drug binding 37,38 , we found that supplementation of Bi(III) compounds to the NDM-1-positive bacterial cells led to similar shifts in the protein-melting temperatures (\u0394T m ) by ca. 2\u00b0C ( Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 5a ), while the melting temperature remained almost unchanged upon treatment of bismuth compounds to the NDM-1-C208A mutant strain ( Supplementary  Fig. 5b) , indicative of the importance of Cys208 for the binding of Bi(III) to NDM-1 in cells. We next examined whether binding of Bi(III) induces Zn(II) release from NDM-1 by ICP-MS. As shown in Fig. 2d , the addition of increasing concentrations of CBS to native Zn-bound NDM-1 resulted in gradual decreases in the stoichiometry of Zn (II) to NDM-1, accompanied by the increase in the binding stoichiometry of Bi(III) to NDM-1, eventually ca. 2.13 molar equivalents of Zn(II) were displaced, whereas 0.96 molar equivalents of Bi(III) bound to the enzyme. Such a phenomenon is unprecedented, as in most cases, one Bi(III) ion can only displace one Zn(II) ion from an enzyme or a protein 39, 40 . Significantly, inhibition of NDM-1 activity by Bi(III) was essentially irreversible as supplementation of 2 molar equivalents of Zn(II) led to only about 20% activity being restored for Bibound NDM-1 owing to the less extent of Bi(III) being replaced by Zn(II) from the enzyme ( Supplementary Fig. 6 ), in contrast to full recovery for apo-NDM-1 (Fig. 2e ). Limited proteolysis of purified soluble apo-bound, Zn-bound, or Bi-bound NDM-1 was also performed to explore the impact of Bi(III) on the protein stability of NDM-1. We found that the Bi-bound NDM-1 as well as apo-bound NDM-1 was readily degraded (Supplementary Fig. 7) , in contrast to Zn-bound NDM-1, which resisted proteolysis by proteinase K 41 . Subsequently, we examined the change in enzyme kinetics of NDM-1 by varying the Bi(III) concentration. The addition of Bi(III) resulted in a decrease of the apparent V max from 0.900 to 0.365 \u00b5M s \u22121 when Bi(III) concentration increased from 0 to 1.5 \u00b5M. The relevant Lineweaver Burk plot indicates either a typical non-competitive or an irreversible inhibition (Fig. 2f) .",

            "text": "Crystallography reveals the binding mode of Bi(III) to NDM-1. The molecular mechanism of inhibition of MBLs by Bi(III) compounds was further investigated by X-ray crystallography. Attempts on direct co-crystallization of Bi-bound form of NDM-1 were not successful due to the amorphous precipitant that readily formed under virtually all of the crystallization conditions examined, and thus crystal soaking with CBS was used. We first crystallized and determined the high-resolution native NDM-1 structure at 0.95 \u00c5 ( Supplementary Fig. 8 ), the highest resolution obtained so far. To facilitate the diffusion of Bi(III) ions into the crystal lattice, Zn(II) ions from the native NDM-1 crystals were removed by immersing the crystals in a pool of cryo-solution containing the metal-chelating agent, ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA). The binding of Bi(III) to the protein was confirmed by X-ray excitation spectrum, which showed only the excitation peak for bismuth at around 10.8 keV, but not for the zinc peak at around 8.6 keV ( Supplementary Fig. 9 ). Two data sets were collected for each Bi-bound crystal, one at the peak position (0.92 \u00c5) and the other at the remote position (0.93 \u00c5) of bismuth absorption edge. Both data sets showed clear anomalous peaks at the active site of NDM-1 with the anomalous peak for the data set collected at 0.92 \u00c5 being more significant, indicative of the presence of Bi(III) in the crystal lattice. As shown in Fig. 3a , no significant overall conformational changes were observed between the Bi-bound and Zn-bound NDM-1 (rmsd of 0.18 \u00c5 over all C a ), while only subtle conformational changes were observed at the active site ( Fig. 3b-d) . Structural refinement using the anomalous signal showed that Bi(III) exhibited two alternative conformations at the active site. The Bi(III) is located between the two Zn (II) ions slightly closer to the Zn1 site of native NDM-1 structure as the major conformation with an occupancy of 0.5. Apart from residues that coordinate to Zn1 (His120 and His189), Cys208 as well as Asp124 that originally bind to Zn2 are also involved in Bi (III) coordination, together with a water molecule forming a trigonal prismatic geometry (Fig. 3b) . Bi(III) is located slightly near the Zn2 site of native NDM-1 structure in the minor conformation with much less tendency (an occupancy of only 0.1) ( Supplementary Fig. 10 ), for which Bi(III) coordinates to His250, Cys208, Asp124, and a water molecule, forming a distorted tetrahedral geometry (Supplementary Table 4 ). The bond lengths of Bi(III) with the side chains of amino acids are overall longer than those for Zn(II) in general ( Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 5 ), in consistence with the larger ionic radius of Bi(III) (1.03 \u00c5) than Zn (II) (0.74 \u00c5). The crystallographic data are in agreement with our biophysical characterization that one Bi(III) ion replaces two Zn (II), and Cys208 is crucial for Bi(III) binding to NDM-1.",

            "text": "CBS suppresses resistance evolution of NDM-1. In spite of clinical application for the treatment of H. pylori-associated diseases, bismuth drugs such as CBS (De-Nol \u00ae ) and RBC (Pylorid \u00ae ) confer no resistance even after use for a long period of time. Importantly, the combination of bismuth drugs with antibiotics significantly increases the eradication rate of drug-resistant H. pylori 31, 42 . This is contributable to its capability of targeting multiple biological pathways 43, 44 , a typical feature of metalloagents. Such unique properties might endow the potency of Bi (III) compounds to cope with resistance issue. To assess whether Bi(III) compounds exhibit such a resistance-proof characteristic in MBL-positive bacteria i.e., NDM-HK, mutant prevention concentration (MPC) was determined for MER in the absence and presence of different concentrations of CBS. We found that MER alone was unable to kill all high-level resistant mutants even at 16-fold MIC (MPC = 32 folds of MIC). In contrast, with the increase in CBS concentration, the number of mutant colonies declined significantly as shown in the heat map (Fig. 4a) . The observed mutation frequency ranged from 1.31 \u00d7 10 \u22127 to 9.84 \u00d7 10 \u221210 (Supplementary Table 6 ). However, no such reduction in mutant colonies was noted for the NDM-1-negative strain, NDM-HK PCV (Fig. 4b) . The MER MPC was lowered to 2-fold MIC against NDM-HK when \u2265128 \u00b5g mL \u22121 CBS or \u226564 \u00b5g mL \u22121 Bi(NAC) 3 were used (Fig. 4c left bars and Supplementary  Fig. 11b ). In contrast, less mutation prevention was observed for CBS in NDM-HK PCV (Fig. 4c, right bars) . Although hyperproduction of NDM-1 was noted (as shown in the inset of Fig. 4d) , the combination therapy significantly suppressed the evolution of high-level resistance over a period of 20 passages of NDM-HK (Fig. 4d) . No such phenomenon was observed for NDM-HK PCV, implying that mutation prevention of NDM-1positive bacteria by Bi(III) compounds is attributed to the inhibition of NDM-1 enzyme. Indeed, a MIC of 32 \u03bcg mL \u22121 in the presence of 256 \u03bcg mL \u22121 CBS vs 512 \u03bcg mL \u22121 in the absence of CBS was found for MER against NDM-1-overexpressing E. coli Rosetta cells (NDM-Rosetta OX in Supplementary Table 3) , confirming the ability of CBS to restore antibiotic activity against bacteria with hyper-production of NDM-1. Considering the low toxicity of CBS in humans and the acceptable mutation The infected MDCK cells were exposed to CBS or MER monotherapy, or combination therapy overnight and lysed subsequently to enumerate the bacteria attached, penetrated, or transcytosed therein by agar plating. The results show the viable bacterial loads were still at a level of 10 6 CFU, even when MER at 2-fold MIC was used. However, it dropped greatly to a level of 10 4 CFU when MER and CBS were used in combination (Fig. 4e ). In addition, more than 100-fold decrease in the bacterial load was also observed in the bacteriainvaded model ( Supplementary Fig. 12 ). We then evaluated the in vivo efficacy of the drug combination in rescuing mice from the bacterium-induced mortality using peritonitis models. Female BALB/c mice were infected systemically with a lethal dose of NDM-HK in the presence of 2% mucin. Mucin is the macromolecular component of mammalian mucus, and commixture of mucin is used to enhance the bacterial pathogenicity in mouse peritoneal cavity 28, 45 , whereas mice showed no morbidity or mortality when mucin was used alone. The infected mice were then administrated with a vehicle control, MER or CBS monotherapy or combination therapy, 4 h post infection, followed by twice-daily treatment via i.p. injection ( Fig. 4f) . For the monotherapy, CBS failed to protect any of the mice from death within 48 h. Half of the mice in MER group also died the next day post infection, and at the endpoint of the experiment MER rescued two of the eight mice. However, in a pre-experiment, MER at an identical dose cured all the mice infected with a lethal dose of NDM-HK PCV ( Supplementary  Fig. 13 ). In contrast, the combination therapy effectively postponed the death of mice and led to an increase in mice survival rate to 50%. Additionally, no bacterial clots were observed by direct visual inspection of the infection site in the dissected mice receiving combination therapy ( Supplementary  Fig. 14) . Similar results were obtained in a murine peritonitis model without mucin, in which 40% mice survived for up to 86 h when MER and CBS were co-administrated ( Supplementary  Fig. 15 ). Taken together, we demonstrate that the in vitro antimicrobial activity of the combination of MER with CBS could be effectively converted into in vivo efficacy.",

Their clinical utility is, however, greatly challenged by the emergence of carbapenemase, i.e., SBLs and more difficult-to-treat MBLs, which have extremely broad substrate spectrum on almost all \u03b2lactams (except for aztreonam 47 ), as well as being resistant to all commercially available inhibitors of SBLs. In particular, NDM-1 is one of the most widespread and threatening MBLs that binds and hydrolyzes almost all \u03b2-lactam antibiotics with Zn(II) as a cofactor. Therefore, no effective therapy is available currently. Other classes of antibiotics such as colistin and fosfomycin though exhibit antimicrobial activity against MBL-positive bacteria, usually suffer severe side effects or limitations in drug delivery 48 , which further restrains the medication therapy against MBL producers. Thus, an alternative strategy is needed to develop more effective MBL inhibitors.",

            "text": "Herein, we demonstrate the potential of repositioning an anti-H. pylori drug CBS (Fig. 1a) , as a new class of MBL inhibitors, as bismuth drugs such as CBS in combination with antibiotics have been recommended as first-line treatment for H. pylori infection; they can even overcome clarithromycin and metronidazole resistance 31 . Different from other heavy metal ions, bismuth drugs exhibit negligible toxicity in humans, attributable to glutathione, and multidrug-resistant protein-mediated disposal in humans but not in pathogens 49 . The currently accepted therapeutic daily doses of CBS in Europe deliver approximately 480 mg equivalents of bismuth oxide (Bi 2 O 3 ) for up to 8 weeks 50 . No intoxication has been documented with CBS at its recommended dosage in the treatment of peptic ulcer disease, and no other serious adverse effects have been associated with CBS 51 . Our combined data show that a battery of Bi(III) compounds including CBS inhibit NDM-1, VIM-2, and IMP-4 at micromolar levels, and excitingly exhibit a synergy upon co-treatment with MER to resistant strains as reflected by the FICI values of 0.05-0.4 and significant decreases in MICs (Tables 1 and 2) . The activity of MER can be restored to the level similar to those for sensitive strains. The higher activity of Bi(NAC) 3 toward MBLs-positive bacteria may provide a rationale to further develop more potent Bi(III) compounds by complexation of Bi(III) with ligands that could increase Bi(III) uptake, as well as possess high affinity toward chelation of Zn(II) at the same time.",

            "text": "Our biophysical characterization reveals a unique feature that one Bi(III) binds to the active site, accompanied by release of two Zn(II) cofactors (Figs. 2d, 3b, c) , leading to the abolishment of MBLs activity both in vitro and in vivo. Such an unexpected phenomenon might be attributed to the distinct properties of Bi (III), i.e., relative large size and high coordination numbers. Moreover, the active site of NDM-1 is located in a shallow groove encompassed by several loops with Zn(II) coordinating residues 52 , which confers conformational flexibility of these residues for efficient substrate binding and catalysis turnover. In consistence with thiolphilic nature of bismuth 44 , cysteine (Cys208) is critical for binding of Bi(III) as revealed by mutagenesis studies (e.g., Cys208 to Ala208), as well as the crystal structure which shows that Cys208 is involved in binding of Bi(III) in both conformations. Most organic MBL inhibitors inactivate the enzyme through binding to the substrate site of specific type of MBLs 19, 22 , such inhibitors are unlikely to be developed as broadspectrum inhibitors of MBLs given the structural diversity of the enzymes at the active sites. In contrast, Bi(III) compounds inactivate the enzyme through replacement of Zn(II) by Bi(III) ion via the critical residue of cysteine at the active site. Based on the unique mechanism employed by Bi(III) to inactivate NDM-1, we strongly suggest that Bi(III) compounds can serve as a broadspectrum inhibitor for B1 class of MBLs, although only NDM-1, VIM-2, and IMP-4 were selected as showcase studies ( Table 2) . As for mono-zinc (II) B2 class of MBLs, a cysteine is found in the active sites; however, it remains to be seen whether it is accessible for Bi(III) and how fast such Bi(III)-Zn(II) exchange could be given the structural rigid nature of this class of MBLs in their active sites 53 . It may warrant further investigation to see whether Bi(III) compounds also inhibit B2 and B3 classes of MBLs. In contrast to most organic molecule-based inhibitors, which may easily encounter resistance owing to the rapid evolution of variant MBLs just as it occurred in the case of inhibitor-resistant (IR) TEM-1 and KPC-2 54,55 , the combination of CBS with MER significantly suppressed the development of high-level resistance in NDM-1 producers. This may be due to the reduced use of MER in the combination and/or reduced protein levels of NDM-1 when bacterial cells were treated with CBS ( Supplementary  Fig. 7) . Nevertheless, the MICs of MER still raised at the end of passage compared to that of original strain (control) owing to the hyperproduction of NDM-1 as confirmed by Western blot (Fig. 4d) . Whether this is due to mutations in the promoter region of the gene and/or high copy numbers of plasmids carrying the bla gene may warrant further studies in future.",

Notably, peritoneal co-administration of CBS (at a comparable dose to current FDA-approved human dose (8 mg/kg) 58 ) boosts the effectiveness of MER, leading to increased mouse survival time and reduced mortality of mouse infected with highly lethal NDM-HK (Fig. 4f) . However, not all mice survived eventually, possibly due to limited studies on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of bismuth drugs under such circumstances. Nevertheless, our robust in vitro and preliminary in vivo results provide solid foundation on the development of Bi(III) or other metallodrugs as antibiotic adjuvants to treat infection caused by MBL-producing bacteria in a wider clinical context. For example, Bi(III) is known to preferentially accumulate in kidney 59 , and the local high concentration of Bi(III) may render better therapeutic effect in mouse kidney or urinary tract infection models. Moreover, as an approved drug, CBS will render a more rapid and economic route into clinical trials and even to patents, if successful.",

Given that Bi(III) compounds are already clinically used drugs and their selective toxicity toward pathogens. Such broad-spectrum MBL inhibitors together with antibiotics as co-therapy will undoubtedly open a new horizon for the treatment of infection caused by MBL-positive bacteria.

Purified Zn-bound-NDM-1 (20 \u03bcM) dissolved in trace-metal-free ICP-MS buffer containing 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, was incubated with various concentrations of CBS at 25\u00b0C for 5 h with mild shaking. The samples were subsequently dialyzed in ICP-MS buffer to remove unbound-metal ions and were then acidified and subsequently analyzed using an ICP-MS spectrometer (Agilent 7500a, Agilent Technologies, CA, USA) with 115 In as an internal standard for 209 Bi,",
