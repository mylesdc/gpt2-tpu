The aim of this study was to determine the analgesic and sensorial benefits of two different amylmetacresol/2,4-dichlorobenzyl alcohol (AMC/DCBA) throat lozenge formulation variants, AMC/DCBA Warm lozenge and AMC/DCBA Cool lozenge, compared with an unflavoured, non-medicated placebo lozenge in the relief of acute sore throat due to upper respiratory tract infections. Methods: In this multicentre, randomised, double-blind, single-dose study, 225 adult patients with acute sore throat were randomly assigned to receive either one AMC/DCBA Warm lozenge (n = 77), one AMC/DCBA Cool lozenge (n = 74) or one unflavoured, non-medicated lozenge (matched for size, shape and demulcency; n = 74). After baseline assessments, patients received their assigned lozenge and completed four rating assessments at 11 timepoints from 1 to 120 minutes post dose. Analgesic properties were assessed by comparing severity of throat soreness and sore throat relief ratings. Difficulty in swallowing, throat numbness, functional, sensorial and emotional benefits were also assessed.",

Inflammatory mediators, such as bradykinin and prostaglandins, released following local responses to cell damage are known to cause some of the sore throat symptoms, including pain and irritation [1] . Pro-inflammatory cytokines have also been linked to 'sickness' behaviour, which in turn is associated with increased pain sensitivity in cases of microbial infection [2] . Moreover, sore throat and 'sickness' are highly correlated, where a greater level of pain experienced by the patient is associated with a greater feeling of sickness/unwellness [3] , often resulting in remedial action being sought.",

            "text": "Up to 80% of sore throats are caused by viruses and not bacteria [4, 5] . Therefore, antibiotics are ineffective in the majority of cases and are not recommended for the primary treatment of acute sore throat by several clinical bodies in the EU [6, 7] . Clinically proven overthe-counter (OTC) options that are rapid-acting, safe and effective in providing symptomatic relief to acute sore throat are becoming increasingly important in the self-management of this condition. Amylmetacresol/2,4dichlorobenzyl alcohol (AMC/DCBA) throat lozenges (more commonly known as Strepsils \u00ae lozenges; Reckitt Benckiser Healthcare International, UK) are a range of medicated throat lozenges available OTC in the UK and many other countries for the symptomatic relief of mouth and throat infections, and acute sore throat. All AMC/DCBA throat lozenges contain the two core active ingredients, AMC (0.6 mg) and DCBA (1.2 mg), both of which possess antibacterial [8, 9] , antiviral [10] and local anaesthetic [11] properties. Furthermore, clinical evidence available supports the efficacy and safety of AMC/DCBA throat lozenges in the rapid relief of acute sore throat due to upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) [12] [13] [14] [15] . It should be noted that although such OTC products are used to provide symptomatic relief of viral and bacterial pharyngitis, worsening of symptoms may suggest a more serious cause and the opinion of a medical professional should be sought. Data suggest that the analgesic and functional benefits observed with AMC/DCBA throat lozenges were attributable to the active ingredients, AMC and DCBA, as these benefits were significantly over and above the demulcent properties of non-medicated lozenges [15] . AMC/DCBA Cool lozenge is a formulation variant of AMC/DCBA throat lozenge that has been associated with sensorial effects such as cooling, coating and soothing in healthy volunteers [16] . However, up until now neither the efficacy nor the sensorial benefits of this lozenge formulation have been investigated in patients with acute sore throat, hence the basis of part of this study.",

When these healthy adult volunteers were randomly allocated to one of two lozenges, either a new AMC/DCBA throat lozenge variant (known as AMC/DCBA Warm lozenge) or a control lozenge, more participants taking the AMC/DCBA Warm lozenge (89%) said they felt a warming sensation than those who took the control lozenge (9%; p = 0.01). Sixty-five percent of participants felt it within 30 seconds and 85% felt the effects began in the first minute. More participants taking the AMC/DCBA Warm lozenge (58%) agreed that the experience provided by the Warm lozenge was 'comforting' compared with 23% in the control lozenge group (p < 0.0001). This consumer research study demonstrated that the AMC/ DCBA Warm lozenge provided sensorial effects in healthy volunteers, but it is not known whether these effects would be seen in patients with acute sore throat, and what other benefits the product could deliver in this patient population.",

A thirdparty blinding method was employed, where each patient was blindfolded and provided with a single lozenge (from an opaque blister pack) in the clinic by an independent member of the investigational staff who was not involved in the study assessments. Patients were advised that they might experience a cool or warm sensation. Once the lozenge was put into the mouth, the blindfold was removed. Patients were instructed to suck the lozenge slowly, moving the lozenge around the mouth, until it had dissolved, without chewing or crunching the lozenge.",

The peak effects observed in this single dose study for pain relief, throat soreness, difficulty in swallowing and throat numbness were achieved by 15 and 30 minutes for the AMC/DCBA Cool and AMC/DCBA Warm lozenge after initial dosing and lasted for up to 2 hours, suggesting that the relief provided by both AMC/DCBA throat lozenge variants is not confined to the time the throat lozenge remains in the mouth, and that relief is felt long after the throat lozenge has dissolved. Significant analgesic and functional effects on severity of throat soreness, sore throat relief and difficulty in swallowing have previously been demonstrated with the original AMC/DCBA throat lozenge (which contains only AMC and DCBA) compared with an unflavoured, nonmedicated lozenge, the benefits of which were rapid in onset and ongoing, lasting long after the lozenge had gone [15] . Unsurprisingly, for patients with a sore throat the two functional areas that were considered to be most impaired at baseline were swallowing and talking, which support what is currently known [15] . Moreover, the analgesic benefits reported by the patients translated into functional benefits, with differences in favour of the AMC/DCBA Cool and AMC/DCBA Warm lozenge for swallowing, and in the case of the AMC/DCBA Warm lozenge, for talking also, compared with the unflavoured, non-medicated lozenge. In addition, patients taking either one of the AMC/DCBA throat lozenge variants reported experiencing soreness relief, relief from burning, soothing relief, warming relief and pain relief from the moment they took the throat lozenge, supporting the instant effects of these lozenges.",

These sensorial effects were felt instantly as soon as the lozenge was sucked and in the case of the AMC/DCBA Cool lozenge, the cooling sensation lasted for up to 2 hours. Furthermore, when asked at 2 hours, patients who took either one of the AMC/DCBA throat lozenge variants reported feeling better, less distracted, less frustrated and happier than before they took the lozengeall of which are emotional benefits. Thus, the results of this study suggest that the patients were able to feel more like themselves and continue with their everyday lives after taking either of the two AMC/DCBA throat lozenge variants. It is not unexpected that patients taking these lozenges would experience both emotional and physical benefits of pain relief as demonstrated in this study because if patients are feeling less pain, they are more likely to be feeling better. As previously demonstrated, sore throat and 'sickness' are highly correlated with each other, where a greater level of pain experienced by the patient is associated with a greater feeling of sickness/unwellness, and vice versa [3] .",

The magnitude of the changes observed in the present study both in terms of changes from baseline of each of the efficacy endpoints, and between each of the AMC/ DCBA throat lozenge variants compared with the unflavoured, non-medicated lozenge are therefore clinically meaningful. These clinically meaningful observations are in keeping with those reported for the original AMC/ DCBA throat lozenge [15] . Also in keeping with previously published data is the 'placebo effect' observed with the unflavoured, non-medicated lozenge [15] . However, this study only investigated the effects of the two AMC/DCBA throat lozenge variants as a whole in patients with sore throat, and did not investigate the sensory impact of the excipients of the two lozenge formulation variants on the placebo effect, which warrants further investigation. Similar to the findings from two surveys in healthy volunteers, the sensorial benefits of a cooling sensation and a warming sensation experienced by healthy adults who took a AMC/DCBA Cool or a AMC/DCBA Warm lozenge, respectively, were mirrored in patients with acute sore throat, and furthermore, were translated into both analgesic and functional benefits (Personal Communications) [16] .",
