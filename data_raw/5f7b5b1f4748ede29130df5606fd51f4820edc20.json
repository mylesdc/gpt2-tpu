This enzyme has been shown to be active as a dimer in which only one protomer is active. However, it remains unknown how the dimer structure maintains an active monomer conformation. It has been observed that the Ser139-Leu141 loop forms a short 3 10 -helix that disrupts the catalytic machinery in the inactive monomer structure. We have tried to disrupt this helical conformation by mutating L141 to T in the stable inactive monomer G11A/R298A/Q299A. The resulting tetra-mutant G11A/L141T/R298A/Q299A is indeed enzymatically active as a monomer. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the L141T mutation disrupts the 3 10 -helix and helps to stabilize the active conformation. The coil-3 10 -helix conformational transition of the Ser139-Leu141 loop serves as an enzyme activity switch. Our study therefore indicates that the dimer structure can stabilize the active conformation but is not a required structure in the evolution of the active enzyme, which can also arise through simple mutations.",

This outbreak has led to significant attention and intensive study of the treatment and prevention of coronaviruses over the past decade. Recently, a new coronavirus called the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has emerged. MERS-CoV first appeared in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and quickly spread into Europe. To date, approximately 3-4 out of every 10 patients who have been diagnosed with MERS have died 1 . Although significant advances in the understanding of coronaviruses have been made over the past decade through the study of SARS-CoV, more research is needed to develop effective countermeasures, such as drugs or vaccines, to control the new pathogen.",

Like other known CoV-3CLpro structures, such as TGEV, hCoV-229E, hCoV-HKU1, and IBV 2-5 , SARS-3CLpro has a highly conserved three-dimensional structure, dimer interface, catalysis dyad, and substrate binding site, but an extremely low homology with cellular proteases. SARS-3CLpro forms a homodimer in crystal structures 6,7 that consists of two protomers oriented almost perpendicularly. Each protomer of the SARS-3CLpro contains three domains. Domains I (residues 1-101) and II (residues 102-184) have trypsin-like folds and control catalysis. Domain III (residues 201-306) is an extra domain with five \u03b1 -helices that is related to enzyme dimerization and activity regulation 8 . The substrate binding site is located in the cleft between Domains I and II, which is composed of six subsites (S1-S6) corresponding to the P1-P6 peptides of the substrate peptide. S1 is the most important subsite, because residue Gln-P1 of this subsite is conserved in all coronaviruses.",

The N-finger \u03b1 -helix A' of Domain I (residues 10-15) and helix Domain III have been recognized as the main components of the dimer formation. Changes in these components are known to disrupt the monomer-dimer equilibrium. For example, the proteinase loses its activity and remains monomeric in solution when the N-finger is deleted 10 . Mutations of either Gly11 or Arg298 to Ala also lead to inactive monomers 11, 12 . The G11A mutation may shorten the \u03b1 -helix A' of Domain I, which in turn may disrupt the N-finger conformation, preventing the N-finger from correctly squeezing into the pocket of another monomer during dimerization and leading to the monomer structure 11 . Similarly, the R298A mutation may trigger the switch from a dimer to a monomer by releasing the constraints between the N-finger and C terminus and destroying their precise positioning and orientation 12 . Ser139 and Phe140 are two key residues that not only contribute to interactions between the two protomers in the parent dimer but also maintain the correct conformation of the S1 subsite in the substrate-binding pocket. Although Ser139 and Phe140 are adjacent, their mutations cause different conformational changes in the crystal structures 13 . The S139A mutation forms monomers in the crystal structure but maintains partial activity in solution due to the existence of a small fraction of dimers in solution. In contrast, the F140A mutation forms dimers with a highly collapsed substrate-binding pocket and is totally inactive. The active site mutation, C145A, loses hydrolysis activity completely but remains a dimer 14 . Other residue mutations, which are neither on the dimer interface nor key to catalysis, can also influence enzyme activity and dimer association-dissociation of SARS-3CLpro via long-range interactions 15, 16 .",

To the best of our knowledge, no active monomer mutant has been reported previously for SARS-3CLpro or the main proteinases of other CoVs.

We studied the mechanism that regulates this active monomer using mutational and enzymatic studies, as well as molecular dynamics simulations.",

We hypothesized that changing Leu141 to another residue with a lower helical tendency and strong \u03b2 -structure tendency may destroy the 3 10 -helix. In the present work, we mutated Leu141 to Thr141, a residue with strong \u03b2 -structure and low helix tendency. Simultaneously, we mutated Gly11, Arg298, and Gln299, which are residues at the dimer interface, to Ala 8, 11, 15 to generate a stable monomeric protein. The triple-mutant G11A/R298A/Q299A (GRQ) was confirmed to be a monomer, and the tetra-mutant G11A/L141T/R298A/ Q299A (GLRQ) was a monomer with enzyme activity as designed.",

In the Monomer system, the distance between His163 and Phe140 is approximately 9 \u00c5. In the first chain of the WT system (WT Chain A), the side chains of His163 and Phe140 are well packed. The distance is approximately 4 \u00c5 and the cosine is close to \u2212 1, which means that the rings adopt a face-to-face conformation. These two conformations observed in the Monomer system and WT Chain A represent the inactive and active state of the catalytic site, respectively. In the second chain of the WT system (WT Chain B), the distance is approximately 5 \u00c5 and the cosine is shifted to 1. The distribution in MutantW is between the distributions in WT Chains A and B, with two minima at cosine values of \u2212 1 and 1, respectively. Although the MutantM system originates from the Monomer system, the MutantM system has a local minimum at a distance of 6 \u00c5 and a cosine of 0. This minimum may represent an intermediate state of the inactive-active transition. These results indicate that the conformations of His163 and Phe140 in the mutants fall between the active and inactive state.",

In the inactive structure of the enzyme, the catalytic site collapses due to the formation of a 3 10 -helix at the Ser139-Phe140-Leu141 residues 12 . To determine whether the L141T mutation disrupts this helix, we compared the backbone dihedrals (\u03c6 , \u03c8 ) of these residues (Fig. 7) . In the Monomer system, the 3 10 -helix was well preserved. In WT Chain A, however, all residues had non-helical conformations. In WT Chain B, L141 had a stable conformation in the helical region. The conformational distributions of WT Chain A and WT Chain B confirm results from previous studies, which have reported that only one protomer in the dimer is active. In the MutantM system, the helical conformations of S139 and T141 were partially disrupted, showing a small population in the \u03b2 -region around (\u03c6 , \u03c8 ) = (\u2212 90, 120). In the MutantW system, which originated from the non-helical conformation, a sub-stable helical conformation of residue T141 was observed. These results suggest that the L141T mutation partially disrupts the 3 10 -helix. Taken together, the simulation results show that in GLRQ, the mutation of Leu to Thr partially restores the correct catalytic conformation as designed.",

For the mutant GLRQ, the loop conformation and active site structure transitioned between inactive and active structures regardless of whether the simulation started from an inactive conformation or an active conformation. Because the three mutations, G11A, R298A, and Q299A, stabilize the monomer structure, the only mutation in the Ser139-Leu141 loop, L141T, was deduced to be the major driving force that destabilizes the 3 10 -helix towards the active loop conformation. This single mutation may not be sufficient to achieve a highly active enzyme, however. More mutations may be necessary to increase the activity of GLRQ. The successful design of an active monomer of SARS-3CLpro nevertheless demonstrates the importance of the Ser139-Leu141 loop conformation, as the loop 3 10 -helix transition serves as a switch for enzyme activity.",

In conclusion, by tuning the conformation flexibility of an active site loop, we have successfully designed an active monomer mutant of SARS-3CLpro.
