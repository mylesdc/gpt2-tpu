More recently, experimental approaches have emerged-and continue to emerge-for discerning the functional role of Ab structure, especially the Fc portion of antibody, in combating viral infections in vivo. A wide range of in vitro measures of antibody activity, from neutralization to antibody-dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC)-each of these terms representing only an operational notion defined by the particulars of a given assay-are poised for assignment of both relevance and reliability in forecasting outcomes of infection. Of the several emergent technical opportunities for clarity, attention here is drawn to three realms: the increasing array of known modifications that can be engineered into Abs to affect their in vivo activities; the improvement of murine models involving knockouts and knock-ins of host genes including Fc receptors; and the development of additional virological design tools to differentiate Abs that act primarily by inhibiting viral entry from antibodies that mainly target viral antigens (Ags) on cell surfaces. To illustrate some of the opportunities with either zoonotic (emerging, spillover) or ancient human-adapted viruses, we draw examples from a wide range of viruses that affect humans.",

Despite the bewildering complexity, some useful generalizations have emerged: in vivo veritas; or in a colloquial tautology used in reference to viral vaccines and therapies, the only correlate of protection is protection. Direct testing of effectiveness in human trials is the ideal benchmark for licensure of vaccines and therapies for human use; however, in cases for which human testing is unfeasible or unethical (1, 2) , indirect rationales for product licensure must be established on the basis of animal models. That is, where human health is the predominant ultimate concern of research and development, and is the standard benchmark of its relevance, the most meaningful in vitro assays along with non-human models of disease are sometimes necessary surrogates for human efficacy trials. And while in vitro assays can be highly useful as possible statistical correlates of protection (3) , they can also be poor reflections of complex realities: witness the abundant examples in which neutralization, binding titer, or hemagglutinationinhibition assays can be inadequate at best, misleading at worst (4) (5) (6) . The fullness of what we wish to know about antiviral Abs is to be found in how Abs limit or sometimes exacerbate virus-precipitated disease in the body of an animal.",

Confounding the shifts in perceived importance of various aspects of immunity, there are differences in understanding of operational terms and their acronyms; a few of them used in this manuscript, and their intended meaning, are shown in Box 1. It is in this context, and with recognition that there already exist excellent recent reviews on discrete aspects of FcR-dependent antiviral immunity (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) , that we aspire to offer a brief and possibly more holistic view of just one important aspect of virus-host interactions: the interactions between Abs, viral Ags, FcR, and FcR-bearing cells. We share in the anticipation and excitement of how emerging technologies may offer new experimental insights into complex processes that were previously suspected but unapproachable.",

Many other viruses have not surrendered so easily to either serendipity or brilliance, and in the more advanced examples, promising vaccines or Ab therapies have not yet completed their costly and uncertain journeys to licensure. It is the intractable and previously orphaned problems at which research is now directed. Restricting attention here to Ab-mediated immunity to viral infections, three major and interrelated questions arise on the path to vaccines and therapies (Figure 1) . What Ab specificities are responsible for protection and are most desirable for their breadth and safety? What other characteristics of Abs are important for protection, especially in the Fc part of the molecule? And when these answers are known, how might vaccine be configured to elicit the most desirable specificities and types of Abs? The latter questions of immunogenicity and immunodominance have proven problematic for the diverse human population, and rational shaping of immune responses (e.g., fine specificities, types, durability) remains perhaps the greatest challenge of immunology. Here, we focus on experimental approaches to the precursor questions of what kinds of Ab response are desirable, and more specifically how hypotheses drawn from provisional in vitro correlates of protection might withstand the test of in vivo veracity.",

We emphasized the redundancy of protective mechanisms typified by cell-targeting antibodies (CTAbs), i.e., those Abs (neutralizing or not) that mark virus-infected cells for interaction with various populations of Fc receptor (FcR)-bearing cells as well as complement (5) . Many of the complexities previously noted, along with the kinds of protective functions that may or may not require FcR interactions, are summarized in Box 2). To simplify the narrative in this manuscript, the term \"FcR\" is used as shorthand for Fc gamma receptor (Fc\u03b3R) unless otherwise specified. For those steeped in the large array of known FcR on immune effector cells as well as non-classical Fc-binding receptor homologs on a wider array of cells, we can only acknowledge the choice of brevity over an even greater narrative complexity, and point toward some of the many reviews available [e.g., reference (18) . and citations in tables therein]. In like fashion, for the sake of brevity and \"simplicity, \" emphasis is on Fc's of IgG molecules despite the many important uncertainties about the antiviral, interfering, or synergizing roles of IgM, IgA, and even IgE in host immunity to viruses (19) .",

The special case of early, entry-associated targets for ADCC, best described with HIV, was covered in previous reviews (17, (20) (21) (22) (23) . Parenthetically, we affirm the complementary and interactive natures of Ab and T cell immunity, but that larger topic is not considered here. Moreover, Figure 2 depicts only the events at a single-cell level, and reserves for elsewhere a discussion of the larger complexities of localized and distant viral spread in the infected host, viral persistence, latency, and biological systems that drive the ultimate outcomes of host survival and viral spread to new hosts.",

As virus enters cells (here at a multiplicity of infection around 1 infectious unit [IU] per cell, thus non-infectious particles at even higher ratios), disassembles, and then makes new proteins and genomes on the way to making more virions, the targets available to the immune system change. Conventionally, \"neutralizing Abs\" inactivate or sequester virus extracellularly, either before infection or as virus emerges. FcR-bearing cells can facilitate such extracellular clearance when the FcR-bearing cells are virus-resistant, and additional proteins-such as those of the complement cascade-can augment this opsonization. Before and during viral replication, either T cells (recognizing MHC-associated peptides) or cell-targeting Abs (CTAbs, recognizing emergent and pre-assembly proteins) can disrupt cell integrity and thereby diminish the viral yield per cell (burst size) by many-fold; the sparing of uninfected cells accrues exponentially. In some cases (well-described with HIV), the entering virions display new and early CTAb targets (*) as the viral spike rearranges coincident with receptor engagement.

In virology, however, mice tend to be wholly or partially resistant to infection and disease caused by human pathogens of greatest interest; a compromise is sometimes found by serial passage of virus in mice to achieve some semblance of human disease and protection. For many years, even when there was a palatable model of viral disease in mice, and early data suggested an important role for Fc in Ab-mediated resistance to certain of those viruses (4), data were generally unconvincing in assigning clear relevance to Fc because of technical limits, to wit: the necessary panels of virus-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) having identical paratopes (Ag combining sites) but different Fc moieties were then unachievable. Consequently, a preponderance of evidence that murine MAbs of IgG2a subtype were generally most protective (especially for CTAbs) were less than definitive; Fab and F(ab) 2 fragments of Abs were almost exclusively non-protective (or poorly so) but were not directly comparable to intact Ab because the fragments (neutralizing in vitro or not) had short half-lives in vivo; attempts to deplete FcR-bearing cells in vivo were confounded by the overall toxicity and secondary effects of such depletions, so that truly appropriate controls were lacking; complement (C') depletion of mice typically left the protective capacity of whole Abs intact, but redundant mechanisms (ADCC as well as CMC) and incomplete C' depletion remained possibilities. Moreover, when cross-species transfers of Abs were made (e.g., human Abs into mice or non-human primates [NHP], mouse Abs into guinea pigs or NHP), positive protective results (e.g. Ab-mediated protection) were useful but negative results were fraught [not only do anti-Abs arise in a few days to eliminate xeno-Abs, but also the Fc-FcR interactions across species are problematic at best (26) ].",

Experimentally, as in animal models described here, there is a particular hazard at the opposite end of Ab concentration, i.e., the impulse to empirically screen for Ab effectiveness using high-dose treatments is contraindicated (as a singular approach) by the phenomenon of high-dose prozone, which presumably results from a diminution of the formation of complexes necessary for robust Fc-FcR interactions (56) , akin to highdose prozone in classical immunoprecipitation reactions.

See text for details. Many factors-each with its own quantitative or qualitative dimension-contribute additively or synergistically to reaching a threshold of antiviral activity that meets a standard of protective efficacy (as defined in Box 1). The threshold is not a constant, but varies by individual, host species, virus biotype, dose and route of infection, etc. In short, the figure is intended to illustrate that Fc-mediated aspects of Ab-mediated immunity are interrelated parts of a complex adaptive system that arose during co-evolution of host and virus. To adequately exploit these concepts with vaccines or therapeutic Abs requires either empirical good fortune (the key to almost all licensed vaccines) or understandings that allow rational improvements in design. In the search for statistical or mechanistic correlates of protection, assays that combine several of these factors may be favored. change in Fc, which in turn promotes higher affinity between Fc and FcR than is observed in the absence of Ag (61, 62) . The implication is that, depending upon the assay, in vitro results may be an inadequate predictor of Fc-mediated functional activity of Ab. A different kind of allostery is seen when two MAbs synergize on the basis of how Fab binding to one part of an Ag molecule promotes binding of a second MAb recognizing a different epitope on the same Ag (63) .

            "text": "While some elements of Ab-mediated antiviral immunity appear to be largely or completely independent of Fc function, others are highly reliant on Fc in order to exert biological effects that register as \"protective\" activity (Boxes 1, 2). Such Abs (CTAbs) share with a number of therapeutic anti-cancer Abs the aim of arresting or destroying cells recognized by such Abs, and mechanistic relevance can be gleaned from the extensive research and clinical trials with anti-tumor CTAbs. However, the efficacies of antiviral CTAbs are differently complex due to both the typical incapacities to obtain human protection data and the longstanding problems inherent with classical animal models of viral disease. More recently, newer approaches ( Table 1 ) have allowed increasing compatibility between a given virus (or its cell-expressed antigen), a susceptible animal model, Fc-FcR interactions, populations of FcR-bearing effector cells, etc. This brief review is intended to highlight and cite some of the recent literature that first points toward an almost bewildering complexity in the factors that intrude upon the subset of protective antiviral mechanisms that are Fc-dependent, and then to some feasible approaches to achieve clarity. Most likely, for a given virus with its unique structure and biology, and its unique pathogenetic profile in a chosen animal model, some Fc-dependent Ab-directed mechanisms will prove more reliably important than others. Moreover, each of the concepts illustrated in Figure 4 is meant here to be understood as scalable in its importance, but rarely if ever sufficient by itself to achieve a threshold that achieves enough efficacy to adequately suppress viral replication and prevent viral disease. It is most encouraging that experimental tools, including those shown in Table 1 , are emerging to affirm or refute the truth and biological importance of concepts previously mired in the complexities. To an increasing degree, rational selection and design of optimally effective MAbs (and the means to elicit them with vaccines) will inform antiviral research. Similarly, refinement and selection will continue to improve for in vitro assays that are not only statistical correlates but mechanistic correlates of protection. And still, the final proofs will continue to be an empirical matter of finding what is both safe and effective.",
