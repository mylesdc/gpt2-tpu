            "text": "A549 cells were seeded in 6-well plate with a confluence of 10 6 cells/well. After overnight culture, increasing doses of GLDC inhibitor AOAA was supplemented in the culture medium and maintained for 48 hours. Subsequently, the cells were collected, accurately counted and washed with ice-cold PBS and lyophilized. All the extraction steps were performed on ice as described previously (Buchel, Rhyn et al., 2013) . The cells were resuspended with 2.5ml of 10:1 ethyl column (2.1\u00d7100 mm, 1.8\u03bcm). The mobile phase A contains 1.0mM ammonium acetate and 0.1% formic acid in water, while solvent B consists of 100% acetonitrile. A flow rate of 0.2ml/min at 45\u00baC was applied. The gradient program ran as follows: 0.5min (0.5% solvent B), 4 min (99% solvent B), 9 min (99% solvent B). The column was re-equilibrated by holding 0.5% solvent B between 9 to 10 min before the next sample injection. The ion source was operating in positive mode with a capillary voltage at 2000V and a source temperature of 120\u00baC. The desolvation temperature was set at 350\u00baC. Nitrogen gas was used for instrument operation and the desolvation gas was set at 800L/Hr. The sample cone and source offset voltage were set at 80V and 120V, respectively. Thymidine quantification was achieved by measuring the peak intensity of Q1/Q3=243.2/127.2 transition. Data were processed with Masslynx software (V4.1, Waters, USA).",
