In particular, there is growing interest in the influence of shifts in local and global economic conditions on personality (Bianchi, 2014) , mental illness (Sargent-Cox, Butterworth, & Anstey, 2011) , and wellbeing (Di Tella, MacCulloch, & Oswald, 2006; Yang, 2008) . Estimating the impact of such factors, however, has proven to be difficult. This is due to the use of cross-sectional designs that make it difficult to separate the influence of development (the degree to which there are changes in wellbeing that correspond to particular developmental stage) and period (cultural and economic conditions or events unique to a particular historical period ; Fletcher, 2015; Schoon, 2006; Yang, 2008) .",

To do this we used four cohorts of the Longitudinal Study of Australian Youth (LSAY) with wellbeing measured in 12 domains. Unlike previous research, we used longitudinal data from multiple birth-cohorts to estimate the effects of a unique and pervasive economic crisis. We also used wellbeing measured across most major life domains. This is in contrast to most research to date, which has focused on a single general domain. Furthermore, we leveraged the unique opportunities afforded by the LSAY to estimate these effects at two distinct ages (19 and 22 years of age). To do this we used statistical models, rarely used in previous research, to provide counterfactual estimates of the effect of the GFC (Morgan & Winship, 2014) .",

However, the idea that dramatic changes in the global environment can have meaningful influence on individual psychology is not a new one. C. Wright Mills (1959 Mills ( /2000 3) laid the groundwork for this area of inquiry, stating \"neither the life of an individual nor the history of a society can be understood without understanding both\". In a pioneering study, Glen Elder's (1999) research on children growing up in the Great Depression prompted consideration of not only the influence of macrolevel conditions on progress and frustration in development, but also how such effects filter through to young people via links with local institutions, social ties, and family networks. Elder (1999) noted effects of the Great Depression on social wellbeing, psychological health, and hope and optimism for the future; particularly among those who were younger and thus less cognitively developed. In addition, Elder drew attention to the effect of economic downturns on populations of youth as a whole, in addition to those suffering abject and persistent deprivation (see Elder & Caspi, 1988) . Thus, one needs to consider the effects of economic downturns on factors such as wellbeing across whole cohorts (Jahoda, 1988) .",

Indeed, Di Tella et al. indicated that rising unemployment that results from economic hardship has a critical effect not only on those who lose their job, but for the population as a whole. These effects were observed across a range of macroeconomic events including recessions, changes in GDP, inflation, and the relative generosity of the welfare system. Schoon (2006) considered cohorts of British people born in 1958, thus growing up in a golden age of economic stability and prosperity, and those born in 1970, thus growing up in more economic vulnerable times. Schoon reported that growing up in times of economic prosperity seems to be a protective factor against psychological distress and promotes wellbeing. Conger, Rueter, and Conger (2000) , studying the effects of the severe economic downturn in the rural midwest of the United States found that economic distress affected young people's wellbeing via its impact upon parents' mood and parenting behavior. Finally, Forkel and Silbereisen (2001) considered the effect of the reunification of Germany on development. Using a family stress model framework, they found that economic uncertainty had an effect on child wellbeing via parents depressed mood in the West, but less so in the more significantly altered society in the East.",

Although the elderly were particularly exposed to the GFC (e.g., Sargent-Cox et al., 2011) , there are important reasons to also consider the develop-mental period ranging from the transition from high-school to the mid-20s. Here we explore the biological, social, and economic reasons for this. Steinberg (2009 Steinberg ( , 2013 has highlighted convincing biological, behavioral, and neurological evidence to extend the definition of adolescence up to mid-20's. Steinberg's (2014) argument is both social, noting that youth are now becoming financially and socially independent at later ages, and biological, with evidence of continued and significant brain plasticity well into the mid-20s. Steinberg noted that this malleability means that young people are particularly vulnerable to toxic contexts that can lead to lifelong negative impacts. Cummins (2014) likewise noted that wellbeing is particularly volatile during adolescence due to heightened biosocial change. This is consistent with the work of Elder (1999) who noted that age was negatively related with impact of the Great Depression, hypothesizing that ongoing cognitive development meant that hardship had a more severe and long lasting impact.",

Such a period is defined by the convergence of developmental tasks from multiple life domains (educational, occupational, social, family, romantic, and values) and, as such, is one of the most critical developmental periods (Zarrett & Eccles, 2006) . From the perspective of life span theory of control (Heckhausen & Schulz, 1995) the particular danger of macroeconomic events, like the GFC, would be the potential to knock youth off a typical developmental track; delaying transitions, interfering with increasing independence from parents, and extending periods of career and educational uncertainty. For example, research on transition delays provides evidence that even a relatively short delay can have ongoing consequences for status attainment well into adulthood (see Haase, Heckhausen, & K\u00f6ller, 2008; Heckhausen & Tomasik, 2002; Parker et al., 2015) .",

As noted above, both unemployment and the risk of unemployment has a particularly detrimental effect on wellbeing (Clark, Georgellis, & Sanfey, 2001) . The risk of unemployment can cause young people to make different choices about their educational and occupational plans than they otherwise would, which can put them at a distinct disadvantage when competing with their near age peers who entered this developmental period at a more economically advantageous time (see Kahn, 2010) . Finally, at the posthigh-school transition young people are increasing independence via entry into the labor market or tertiary education, yet they also remain strongly connected to parents (Parker, L\u00fcdtke et al., 2012) . As such, the wellbeing of young people may suffer from both their own exposure to economic downturns but also that of their parents as suggested from a family stress model perspective (Conger et al., 2000) .",

Here we make use of the unique opportunities afforded by the LSAY datasets, which follow young people from four birth cohorts for up to 10 years. The nature of the LSAY data, four birth cohorts measured roughly three years apart, allows us to compare the influence of the GFC at two distinct ages in the post high-school transition period (i.e., age 19 and 22). As can be seen in Table 1 , the 19-year-old age group captures much of the movement of young people from high-school to tertiary education or the labor market. At age 22, young people appear to have mostly made this transition. The comparison of these age groups is opportunistic (i.e., due to the possibilities afforded by the data), however, and thus we have little evidence on which to assume the GFC would have differential effects. On this basis, we put forward the following hypotheses:",

The 1981 and 1984 cohorts reflect representative samples of Australian year nine students with wellbeing data collected 2 years later. The 1987 and 1990 cohorts represent longitudinal extensions of the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), a representative sample of 15-year-olds where wellbeing data was collected a year later. Harmonization was based on modal grade in school rather than age in years. As a result there is a difference of several months in the average age of the cohorts for the waves of interest with the average age gradually increasing from 1981 to 1990 cohorts. This may be due in part to differences in how data was collected, but may also reflect a growing preference for later school intake ages by parents (see Edwards, Taylor, & Fiorini, 2011) .

Versions of this measure have been used in a number of large-scale panel studies in Australia and beyond, including in all LSAY cohorts. As such it provides a critical insight into historical trends in wellbeing of Australian youth. There are 12 domains covered by this instrument. Two additional domains relating to the economy and the way in which the country is being run were excluded due to not being present at critical waves of the study. All variables begin with the stem \"How happy are you with [DOMAIN]\" (see below for suffixes), with response scales varying from 1 (very happy) to 4 (very unhappy). To aid interpretation, these answer points were reverse scored such that higher scores reflected greater happiness. An additional response point was included representing \"can't say/don't know.\" This choice was selected by less than 1% of the sample on average and never more than 4% for any question in any wave. This response was coded as missing for the purposes of the current study. Abbreviations will be used for the 12 wellbeing variables (exact item suffix in brackets) as follows: general (your life as a whole), living (your standard of living), home (your life at home), future (your future prospects), career (your career prospects), work (the work you do, at study, at home or in a job), money (the money you get each week), leisure (what you do in your spare time), location (where you live), social (your social life), people (how you get on with people in general), and independence (your independence; being able to do what you want).",

We thus consider the GFC to have occurred when participants were aged 19 in the 1990 cohort and 22 for the 1987 cohort. Marking the GFC at 2009 is both consistent with previous research, captures both the dramatic jump in unemployment levels that centered on this period and the zenith of media reporting on the GFC where there was a particular environment of heightened \"panic, anxiety, and insecurity\" (Sargent-Cox et al., 2011 , p. 1105 ).",

Second, we aim to minimize the influence of cohort by making statistical comparisons between cohorts who were born closest in time thus ensuring that they share much of the same historical context (see Figure 1 ). Thus, when considering the influence of the GFC at age 19, we compare the 1990 cohort (as the exposed group) to the earlier 1987 cohort (as the nonexposed group).

Put simply, in the case of the current research, we ask the question \"What if the GFC never happened?\" In the current research a birth cohort that experienced the GFC at a particular age serve as the exposed group (i.e., experienced the GFC at age 19 or 21) and the closest earlier cohort at the same age serves as the nonexposed group (i.e., did not experience the GFC at age 19 or 21).

One-to-one matching was used, without replacement (see Stuart, 2010; Thoemmes & Kim, 2011 , for a review).

Exploration of graphed means suggested significant divergence in wellbeing for the GFC cohorts in year 2009 to 2010.

Indeed, although youth unemployment jumped from 8.9% to 13.8% during the GFC in Australia, it rose from under 10% to almost 18% in the United States (our calculation) during the same period. Thus, although research in other countries is needed, it is likely that the results in countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom, let alone Greece, Italy, Ireland, and Spain, was considerable. Importantly, given our focus on the population as a whole, unmoderated by individual exposure, the effect sizes of above .10 standard deviation units, and often above .15, were concerning given effects of unemployment of .50 (Lucas, Clark, Georgellis, & Diener, 2004) .

In particular the pattern of decline and recovery is consistent across both wellbeing and unemployment. Namely, unemployment rose sharply from 2008 to 2009 before recovering just as rapidly. From 2011 unemployment then increased steadily to levels worse than those at the initial impact of the GFC (see Figure 4 ).

As can be inferred from Table  1 , the GFC hit 19-year-olds at the end of high-school and in a period where most of the sample was establishing themselves in either university or the labor market. Restructuring of old relationships and forming of new friendship circles after high-school is common during this period (see Tanner, 2006) , which may explain why satisfaction with social life was affected more for 19-yearolds. Likewise, during this transition young people are expected to considerably increase their independence from parents (Parker, L\u00fcdtke et al., 2012) . Although not the focus of this study, it may be that the GFC meant that 19-year-olds had less financial independence and were thus less able to establish greater independence either within the family home or by moving out. The older 22year-olds transitioned from high-school some 3 years earlier and were thus able to at least begin the developmental tasks associated with restructure old and establish new relationships and gaining independence from parents during a more prosperous period.",

They do note, however, such a payment may not be sufficient for dramatic changes to economic conditions. The Australian context provides a means of exploring this hypothesis given that the government provided payments of up to $900 AUD ($597 U.S. in 2009 dollars) to 80% of the working age population and 90% of families (Hyslop, 2014) .

Although most research in psychology does focus on average treatment effects, exploring effects within particular strata is an important line for future research. This was difficult in the current case, however, where we had no data on individual exposure to the GFC, which would likely be the strongest moderator of any GFC effect (e.g., Sargent-Cox et al., 2011) . Importantly, although we used rigorous designs by borrowing from the logic of DID and PSM regression in our research, the extent to which they represent causal effects is dependent on the degree to which the comparison cohorts represent true counterfactual counterparts to the GFC exposed cohorts. As we noted above we make the assumption that cohort effects are negligible. Although we aimed to design our models as close to ceteris paribus comparisons as possible, readers should consider the potential biasing effect of birth cohort differences. Finally, it should be noted that we used single-item measures for wellbeing in each life domain. Multi-item measures would have allowed for latent variable modeling and thus a control for measurement error.",

            "text": "The current article was concerned with whether the GFC had an effect on young people's wellbeing across multiple life domains. We focused on an age group that was undergoing a large number of developmental tasks at a critical period of life that has implications across the life span (Dietrich et al., 2012) . We found that all domains were significantly affected in at least one case, with effect sizes often above .10 for those who were aged 19 during the GFC. Given that we were focused on a country in which the impact of the GFC was less sever than in the European Union or the United States, these effects are of international concern. As Conger et al. (2000) suggested, we cannot typically predict large-scale changes like the GFC; however, a better understanding of how such events impact young people is critical for marshaling an appropriate response.",
