These bacteria favored a lower temperature for their prolonged survival on the dry fomites, regardless of the material type. Interestingly, when mixed with S. aureus, E. coli survived for a longer time at a lower temperature. Cardiolipin, which can promote the survival of S. aureus in harsh environments, had no effect on maintaining the survival of E. coli. Although the trends remained unchanged, adjusting the humidity from 40% to 60% affected the survival of bacteria on dry surfaces. Scanning electron microscopic analysis revealed no morphological differences in these bacteria immediately before or after one day of dry conditions. In addition, ATP assessment, a method used to visualize hightouch surfaces in hospitals, was not effective at monitoring bacterial dynamics. A specialized handrail device fitted with a heater, which was maintained at normal human body core temperature, successfully prohibited the prolonged survival of bacteria [Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC), E. coli (ATCC), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC), S. aureus (ATCC), Acinetobacter baumannii (clinical isolate), and Serratia marcescens (clinical isolate)], with the exception of spore-forming Bacillus subtilis (from our laboratory collection) and the yeastlike fungus Candida albicans (from our laboratory collection)] on dry surfaces. Taken together, we concluded that the tested bacteria favor lower temperatures for their survival in dry environments. Therefore, the thermal control of dry fomites has the potential to control bacterial survival on high-touch surfaces in hospitals.",

Microbe-contaminated dry surfaces in hospitals that are frequently touched by hands, termed 'high-touch' surfaces, such as handrails, doorknobs, lockers, and the table surfaces of inpatients, present a high risk in terms of the spread of nosocomial infections [1] [2] [3] . It is well recognized that improved hand hygiene and cleaning of surfaces are critically important in controlling hospital-acquired infections [4] [5] [6] . While improved cleaning practices have led to a decrease in the transmission of hospital-acquired infections [7] [8] [9] , in general, hospital cleanliness is still not sufficient to control infections [10] [11] [12] . This is confirmed by the fact that outbreaks of hospital-acquired infections still occur worldwide [13] [14] [15] . It is therefore possible that there are other unknown factors responsible for bacterial survival, particularly on dry surfaces, in hospitals.",

Considerable variability in bacterial detection was noted, even for the same surfaces, indicating that the ongoing cleanliness of dry surfaces in hospitals is insufficient [16] [17] [18] . Furthermore, accumulating evidence indicates that various human pathogenic bacteria (such as Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Enterococcus, Staphylococcus, and Enterobacteriaceae), including multidrug-resistant bacteria, can survive for prolonged periods on dry surfaces [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . The reason for the variability in bacterial detection remains unclear, but changing physiological factors such as environmental temperature may affect bacterial survival. Whether thermal control can regulate bacterial survival in dry environments remains unknown.",

We found that bacteria favor lower temperatures for survival in dry environments. Furthermore, we propose that fomites warmed to human body core temperature may help to control bacterial survival in dry environments, and that such a strategy may prohibit the emergence of human pathogenic bacteria in hospital environments, eventually reducing the need for antibiotics as well as disinfectants.",

Bacterial numbers were assessed using the following indicators: the number of colony-forming units (CFUs), the amount of ATP, and morphological changes (as determined by SEM analysis) ( Fig 1A) . Immediately (within 20 min) after drying, the CFU numbers of E. coli, but not S. aureus, showed a two-log reduction; however, both bacteria, either singularly or in a mixture, survived and retained the potential to be spread ( Fig 1B) . The number of CFUs decreased dramatically over time for both bacteria on dry surfaces, but this trend was amplified by an increase in temperature ( Fig 1C) . Interestingly, the presence of S. aureus appeared to enhance the survival of E. coli in the bacterial mixture compared with E. coli alone (Fig 1C, See ' \u2020'). SEM observations revealed that the morphological changes in both bacteria, singularly or in a mixture, one day after drying was minimal, supporting the CFU assay results and indicating survival of both bacteria (Fig 2) . ATP assessment revealed no significant differences for either bacteria with varying temperature (S1 Fig). Also, cardiolipin, an agent that aids the survival of S. aureus in dry environments [28, 29] , did not support the survival of E. coli after drying, suggesting the presence of another mechanism independent of cardiolipin (S2 Fig). In addition, although the trend observed with altered temperature did not change, humidity control (40-60%) had the opposite effect on the survival of microorganisms on dry surfaces (S3 Fig). Specifically, while the humidity control weakened the thermal effect on the survival of S. aureus on dry environments, a synergistic effect of inhibition on the survival of E. coli was observed. Thus, our findings showed that these bacteria favor a lower temperature for their survival in dry environments, and humidity has a lesser effect.",

Immediately (approximately 1 h) after drying, no differences in bacterial numbers were detected between the different materials ( Fig 3B) . Although the CFU numbers of both bacteria dramatically reduced over subsequent days on the dry surfaces, this temperature-dependent trend was unaffected by the type of material surface ( Fig 3C) . Thus, the material itself (vinyl chloride, aluminum, plastic, stainless steel) had no effect on the diminishing bacterial numbers under dry conditions. We also assessed whether the same trend was seen for multidrug-resistant human pathogenic bacteria using ESBL-and NDM-producing E. coli isolated from Hokkaido University Hospital. The CFU assay confirmed increased survival of multidrug-resistant bacteria at lower temperature, as well as increased survival in the presence of S. aureus (Fig 4) . Taken together, we conclude that bacteria favoring a lower temperature for their survival in dry environments is a universal phenomenon, which is unaffected by the surface material or bacterial type. Importantly, our data highlighted the potential for controlling the survival of bacteria on high-touch dry surfaces by warming dry fomites to human body core temperature.",

Assessment with a hand-held infrared sensor showed that the surface temperature on the handrail pipe was controlled to almost body core temperature, although the temperature on the device surface varied from the end to the center of the pipe (range: 30\u02daC-40\u02daC) (S4B Fig). A heatmap generated with the high-resolution infrared sensor showed that in contrast to the stainless steel pipe without the heater, the surface temperature on the heated pipe was maintained at body core temperature (Fig 5A) , indicating that it is an effective tool to monitor the influence of temperature on bacterial survival on a dry surface. We monitored the survival of GFP-expressing E. coli (DH5\u03b1) spotted onto the handrail surface at regular intervals (1 cm) compared with the GFP signals at equivalent spots on an LB agar plate, and assessed CFU numbers. GFP signals were dramatically decreased on the heated handrail compared with the unheated handrail even 6 h after drying, and the signals were virtually undetectable one day after drying (Fig 5B) . Consistent with this, the CFU numbers on the heated handrail were significantly reduced compared with those on the unheated handrail ( Fig 5C) . In addition, we assessed whether the warming handrail could work on other bacteria. The results indicated that the prolonged survival of bacteria (E. faecalis, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, A. baumannii, and S. marcescens) as well as E. coli, was significantly prohibited, although no effective elimination of the spore-forming bacterium (B. subtilis) was detected (Fig 6) . We also confirmed that the yeast-like fungus (C. albicans) failed to survive immediately (within 6 h) after drying on the device (S5 Fig). Taken together, we concluded that the handrail device warmed to human body core temperature prohibited the prolonged survival of some bacteria and a yeast-like fungus responsible for nosocomial infections on a dry surface.",

The control of nosocomial infections is therefore a priority for healthcare providers worldwide [30] . Here, we showed, for the first time, that a lower temperature is favored for the survival of both E. coli and S. aureus on dry fomites. We also demonstrated that a handrail device warmed to human body core temperature could prohibit the prolonged survival of several pathogens responsible for nosocomial infection (E. coli, S. aureus, E. faecalis, P. aeruginosa, A. baumannii and S. marcescens) and a yeast-like fungus (C. albicans) on this dry surface.

Other factors such as UV radiation, humidity, the presence of organic materials, and surface type are known to be associated with the ability of Thermal control of dry fomites and bacterial survival bacteria responsible for hospital-acquired infections to survive on dry surfaces [34] [35] [36] ; however, temperature is a factor that can be easily and accurately controlled. Furthermore, a temperature of 37\u02daC, which is the core body temperature, is a comfortable temperature that is not harmful to the touch [37] . For these reasons, we selected temperature as a critical factor to study its effects (in particular, body core temperature) on bacterial dynamics and survival on dry fomites. The numbers of CFUs of both bacteria (E. coli and S. aureus), regardless of whether or not they carried multidrug-resistant genes, were dramatically reduced during the days after drying, and this decrease in bacterial numbers was significantly promoted by increased temperature. Because water evaporation from bacterial cells can be accelerated on dry fomites at high temperature, we speculate that it is difficult for bacteria to maintain metabolic activity under such conditions; thus, their viability decreases. We found that Gram-positive S. aureus could survive longer than Gram-negative E. coli, potentially indicating that cell wall thickness plays a role in prolonging the survival of S. aureus on dry fomites. At lower temperature, E. coli survived for a few days whereas S. aureus survived for over 10 days. Although the survival period for these bacteria is limited, particularly for E. coli, it is still sufficient time for these bacteria to transfer from person to person via high-touch surfaces.",

By contrast, cardiolipin, which is an effective factor promoting S. aureus survival in dry environments [28, 29] , had no effect on supporting the survival of E. coli after drying, suggesting the presence of another mechanism independent of cardiolipin. Although this mechanism remains unknown, coexistence with cocci, which have a smaller surface area than bacilli and therefore retain water more effectively, may aid the survival of bacilli on dry surfaces. High-touch dry surfaces are invariably contaminated with S. aureus because this organism is a ubiquitous inhabitant of the human body, and it is therefore crucial to understand its dynamics on dry surfaces. Cardiolipin is a membrane component that enhances stress tolerance, thereby maintaining bacterial viability [43] [44] [45] , and several studies have shown that cardiolipin is involved in biofilm formation [46, 47] . We therefore assessed whether the presence of cardiolipin affected the survival of E. coli on dry surfaces, but no impact was detected indicating that other factors may be involved.",

Humidity, which can block water evaporation, has also been reported to have an impact on bacterial survival [34-36, 48, 49] . Our experiments showed that constant humidity (40%-60%) affected the survival of bacteria on dry surfaces. Whereas, after prolonged incubation without humidity control (less than 20% humidity) (See Fig 1C) , variation in bacterial numbers appeared to be increased, suggesting that low humidity can favor the survival of small numbers of bacteria on dry materials.

One limitation of this device was that the temperature varied from the end to the center of the pipe (range: 30\u02daC-40\u02daC), meaning that the temperature on the device surface was not constant, as indicated by the differences in bacterial numbers spotted onto the agar plates from each of the samples collected from the handrail.
