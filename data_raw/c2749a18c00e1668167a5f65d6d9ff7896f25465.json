The aim of this study was to analyse RSV seasonality in the five distinct regions of Brazil using time series analysis (wavelet and Fourier series) of the following indicators: monthly positivity of the immunofluorescence reaction for RSV identified by virologic surveillance system, and rate of hospitalisations per bronchiolitis and pneumonia due to RSV in children under 5 years old (codes CID-10 J12.1, J20.5, J21.0 and J21.9). A total of 12,501 samples with 11.6% positivity for RSV (95% confidence interval 11 -12.2), varying between 7.1 and 21.4% in the five Brazilian regions, was analysed. A strong trend for annual cycles with a stable stationary pattern in the five regions was identified through wavelet analysis of the indicators. The timing of RSV activity by Fourier analysis was similar between the two indicators analysed and showed regional differences. This study reinforces the importance of adjusting the immunisation period for high risk population with the monoclonal antibody palivizumab taking into account regional differences in seasonality of RSV.",

Wavelet analysis provides information on the time-scale domain for stationary and nonstationary events, allowing for simultaneous localisation of time and of high and low frequencies. Subtle time patterns of occurrence of phenomena of different nature can be detected, as well as changes in its periodicity. Wavelet analysis permits inferences regarding the way continuous variables relate to different frequencies and whether this relationship changes over time (Torrence & Compo 1998 , Cazelles et al. 2007 ). The algorithms described by Torrence and Compo (1998) , available in free software were used (Alonso & McCormick 2012) .

In Brazil, palivizumab has been recommended based on the first studies regarding RSV seasonality, mainly performed in the South and Southeast states (ANVISA 2011). In 2013, the Brazilian Ministry of Health included palivizumab as a drug freely distributed by the Brazilian Public Health System for use in premature babies (gestational age less or equal than 32 weeks) and infants less than 2 years old with chronic lung disease or congenital heart disease with demonstrated hemodynamic repercussion. Every state and region can establish the optimal period for starting the use of immunobiologicals, accounting for the regional climate specificities and epidemiological evidences (MS 2012) . The recent revision of guidelines by the Ministry of Health in 2015 proposed a readjustment of the periods of provision of immunobiologicals in the different regions of the country (MS 2015). Our results reinforce this revision for provision of palivizumab in different regions, as suggested by others studies in Brazil (Vieira et al. 2001 , Paiva et al. 2012 ) and others regions (Panozzo et al. 2010 , Blom-Feshbach et al. 2013 . Results over the period for availability of palivizumab in the Midwest and Southeast (January) do not match exactly with those suggested by Ministry of Health (February). Although there are differences of one month only, these are densely populated regions.

In addition, during the period studied, SIVEP-GRIPE did not include other viruses such as metapneumovirus, bocavirus, enterovirus, and human coronavirus, which may cause similar clinical features. Nonetheless, the analysed data represent all the information available in SIVEP-GRIPE, having a great implication on the public health policies in the country. Another limitation of this study was the low mean positivity found from the tests, which depended on several factors independent of the epidemiological situation, such as the quality of sample collection and transportation, in addition to the sensitivity of the test used. Furthermore, the number of collected samples did not allow using weekly laboratory results or the separate evaluation of the states. However, the hospitalisation data for bronchiolitis and pneumonia due to RSV did not suggest regional discrepancies.",
