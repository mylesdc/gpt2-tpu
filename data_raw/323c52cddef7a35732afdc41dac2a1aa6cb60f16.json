The respective nucleotide sequences of three Oryx species (Oryx leucoryx, Oryx dammah and Oryx gazella) and an out-group (Addax nasomaculatus) were aligned and subjected to BA, MP and UPGMA models for comparing the topologies of respective phylogenetic trees. The 16S rRNA region possessed the highest frequency of conserved sequences (97.65%) followed by cyt-b (94.22%) and d-loop (87.29%). There were few transitions (2.35%) and none transversions in 16S rRNA as compared to cyt-b (5.61% transitions and 0.17% transversions) and d-loop (11.57% transitions and 1.14% transversions) while comparing the four taxa. All the three mitochondrial segments clearly differentiated the genus Addax from Oryx using the BA or UPGMA models. The topologies of all the gamma-corrected Bayesian trees were identical irrespective of the marker type. The UPGMA trees resulting from 16S rRNA and d-loop sequences were also identical (Oryx dammah grouped with Oryx leucoryx) to Bayesian trees except that the UPGMA tree based on cyt-b showed a slightly different phylogeny (Oryx dammah grouped with Oryx gazella) with a low bootstrap support. However, the MP model failed to differentiate the genus Addax from Oryx. These fi ndings demonstrate the effi ciency and robustness of BA and UPGMA methods for phylogenetic analysis of antelopes using mitochondrial markers.",

Fortunately, the efforts of captive breeding programs succeeded to preserve the Arabian Oryx, which was later reintroduced in certain protected areas (Spalton et al. 1999; Ostrowski et al. 1998; Mesochina et al. 2003) . Recently, Iyengar et al. (2007) have recommended maintaining a global perspective for the captive genetic management of Oryx. Individuals from various management programs and regions need to be effectively utilized for sustained future captive breeding in order to ensure that the vital remnants of genetic diversity are retained and represented in future reintroduction programs (Iyengar et al. 2007 ). It has been suggested that molecular methods can signifi cantly contribute to the captive breeding and reintroduction strategies for conservation of various endangered animals such as Oryx antelopes (Russello and Amato, 2007) .",

            "text": "Molecular fi ngerprinting based on the nucleotide sequence analysis of various mitochondrial genes plays an important role in studying evolutionary relationship among various taxa. Besides its exclusive maternal inheritance and lack of recombination, different segments of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) also possess unique features such as conservativeness in protein-coding regions and high variability in noncoding sequences (Ingman et al. 2000; Olivo et al. 1983) . Consequently, the evolutionary rate of mtDNA tends to be variable for different regions and has been utilized to examine various levels of phylogenetic relationships. The 12S rRNA gene sequences being highly conserved, are applied to illustrate higher levels of phylogenies (phyla or subphyla) whereas the 16s rRNA sequences are mainly used for phylogenetic studies at mid-categorical levels (families or genera) (Gerber et al. 2001) . Since the mitochondrial protein-coding genes and the d-loop evolve comparatively faster they are considered as powerful tools for inferring evolutionary history in mid to lower categorical levels such as genera and species.",

Despite a positive impact of statistical revolution, the emergence of sophisticated evolutionary models has placed a burden on researchers to select the model most appropriate for their data. It is intriguing that the bioinformatics tool used for phylogenetic analysis may have some infl uence on the topologies of the resulting trees. An inappropriate choice of evolutionary model can affect the outcome of any phylogenetic analysis by incorrectly estimating tree topologies (Penny et al. 1994; Bruno and Halpern, 1999) . Bayesian (BA), maximum likelihood (ML) or unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) and maximum parsimony (MP) are the main phylogenetic approaches that are often used side by side. While the choice between them has been contentious at times, they frequently give similar results and if they don't, they can complement each other (Liberles, 2005) . In this investigation, we have compared BA, MP and UPGMA methods for phylogenetic analysis of Oryx antelopes using 16S rRNA, cytochrome-b (cyt-b) and d-loop sequences of mtDNA.",

Genetically impoverished endangered populations often fail to exhibit signs of recovery until crossed with individuals from other populations (Land and Lacy, 2000; Westemeier et al. 1998 ). However, if the strategy is to maintain the genetic identity of the population, the introduced individuals should be closely related to the recipient population. Recently, Masembe et al. (2006) have recommended the need of conservation efforts to preserve genetic identity of various oryx groups. Molecular methods play an important role in estimating the relatedness between individuals by comparing the genotypes at a number of informative loci (Sunnucks, 2000) . The high mutation rate of mtDNA compared to nuclear genes renders mtDNA sequences to possess high levels of informative variation that could be utilized for resolving taxonomic relationship in conservation genetics using appropriate bioinformatics tools. We observed no indels in 16S rRNA and cyt-b genes whereas numerous indels were noticed in the aligned sequences of d-loop which is in agreement with an earlier study reporting specifi c indels in the d-loop of Oryx species (Iyengar et al. 2006 ). The frequency of conserved sequences was highest in 16S rRNA gene followed by cyt-b and was lowest in d-loop region whereas the converse was true for the substitutions (Fig. 1) . Most of the substitutions in the mitochondrial regions studied were transitional indicating a recent species history. Factually, transitions are typically observed more often than transversions in the evolution of real sequences.",

Although likelihood-based approaches have proven to be especially powerful for inferring phylogenetic trees they tend to be prohibitively slow due to the requirement of multidimensional space for possible outcomes (optimal trees) and the computational complexity of bootstrap repetitions. On the other hand, BA phylogenetic inference holds promise as an alternative to ML, particularly for large molecular-sequence data sets. Moreover, BA phylogenetic inference has been shown to be as or more robust to ML, particularly when among-sites rate variation is modeled using a gamma distribution (Mar et al. 2005 ).",
