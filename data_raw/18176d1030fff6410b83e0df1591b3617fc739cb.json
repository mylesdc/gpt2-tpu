Here we characterize the spike protein of a camel-derived MERS-CoV (NRCE-HKU205) identified in 2013, early in the MERS outbreak. NRCE-HKU205 spike protein has a variant cleavage motif with regard to the S2\u2032 fusion activation site-notably, a novel substitution of isoleucine for the otherwise invariant serine at the critical P1\u2032 cleavage site position. The substitutions resulted in a loss of furin-mediated cleavage, as shown by fluorogenic peptide cleavage and western blot assays. Cell-cell fusion and pseudotyped virus infectivity assays demonstrated that the S2\u2032 substitutions decreased spike-mediated fusion and viral entry. However, cathepsin and trypsin-like protease activation were retained, albeit with much reduced efficiency compared with the prototypical EMC/2012 human strain. We show that NRCE-HKU205 has more limited fusion activation properties possibly resulting in more restricted viral tropism and may represent an intermediate in the complex pattern of MERS-CoV ecology and evolution.",

In particular, retrospective serological studies have shown that camels have been infected by MERS-CoV or MERS-CoV-like viruses well before 2012. 2 Camel MERS-CoV infections are not associated with overt disease signs in animals, but are believed to be a source for human cases.",

S is typically proteolytically processed for fusion by host cell proteases, a process that can occur at the S1/S2 site (located at the junction between the S1 receptor-binding and S2 fusion domains), and at the S2\u2032 site (located upstream of the fusion peptide). 4 Studies performed on the prototypical EMC/2012 S protein have shown that MERS-CoV represents an unusual coronavirus as it can be activated by a broad range of host cell proteases. [5] [6] [7] [8] In particular, we and others have previously shown that a furin cleavage site present at S2\u2032 is believed to add an extra 'layer' of proteolytic activation enabling the virus to infect a wide variety of cells in vitro, possibly allowing the extra-pulmonary infection observed in MERS patients. 8, 9 Since the first MERS-CoV genome was sequenced, many other human and camel-derived genome sequences have been published. 10, 11 In this study, we examined the S protein of a divergent camel MERS-CoV isolate, NRCE-HKU205, 12 for which the S protein sequence was previously shown to harbor several mutations, including two substitutions at the S2\u2032 cleavage-activation site, A886S and S888I. We characterize the consequences of such substitutions on proteolytic cleavage and fusion activation.",

Intriguingly, while its S1/ S2 site is identical to the one found in EMC/2012 spike, the S2\u2032 cleavage site was found to contain two substitutions: S886A and S888I. To contextualize this finding with more recent sequencing data and to identify other possible variants, we performed comprehensive sequence alignments of MERS-CoV spike S2\u2032 sequences available on GenBank (Supplementary Figure S1) . We identify HKU205 S2\u2032 as the only reported variant sequence in an otherwise invariant site for the 386 sequences analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis of the spike protein sequence reveals that HKU205 is divergent and forms a basal sister relationship with clade A and B MERS-CoV sequences ( Figure 1A ). The sequence for HKU205 S2\u2032 was analyzed and compared with those of representative coronaviruses from all four genera ( Figure 1B ). While S2\u2032 cleavage motifs show a high degree of variability amongst coronaviruses, the sequence immediately downstream of it, recognized as being the coronavirus fusion peptide, 9, [17] [18] [19] is extremely well conserved. However, HKU205 is the only known coronavirus that contains an isoleucine instead of a serine at the residue position immediately following the cleavage site, corresponding to the P1\u2032 position of the furin cleavage motif.",

Despite still containing two paired basic arginine residues, which are typically found in furin cleavage sites, the HKU205 S2\u2032 sequence is not predicted to be cleaved by furin according to PiTou 2.0 cleavability scoring algorithm (Table 1) . 15, 20 Furthermore, the MEROPS protease database indicates that of the 208 known furin-cleaved substrates, none contain an isoleucine at the position immediately after the scissile bond (P1\u2032). 16 To validate these predictions, we performed fluorogenic peptide cleavage assays and demonstrate that while furin was able to proteolytically process EMC/2012 S2\u2032-derived peptide (V max = 7.3 \u00b1 0.2 relative fluorescence units (RFU)/min), the HKU205 S2\u2032 peptide could not be cleaved by the protease (V max = 0.6 \u00b1 0.3 RFU/min) (Figure 2A and Table 1 ). To specifically assess the effect of introducing the S2\u2032 mutations, we generated by site-directed mutagenesis a full-length EMC/2012 spike protein harboring the S886A and S888I substitutions (EMC 205-S2\u2032 S) and performed a western blot analysis on MLV-based pseudovirions harboring either wild-type (EMC wt ) or mutated (EMC 205-S2\u2032 ) S proteins ( Figure 2B ). In the non-treated condition (lane 1) EMC wt S migrated with the same band pattern as shown previously, 8 with full-length (uncleaved) protein and S1/S2 cleavage product due to furin processing during S protein maturation in producer cells. Treatment of EMC wt S with recombinant furin (lane 2) generates a new band (above 65 kDa marker) corresponding to proteolytic processing at the S2\u2032 site. Although the EMC 205-S2\u2032 S band pattern is identical to the one observed for EMC wt in the non-treated condition (lane 1), mutating the S2\u2032 site abrogates furin cleavage, as no S2\u2032 band was observed for EMC 205-S2\u2032 S (lane 2). These results confirm that the HKU205 substitutions within the S2\u2032 cleavage site block furin cleavability.",

Expression of EMC wt S is accompanied by the formation of spontaneous large syncytia (non-treated condition). Furin overexpression or treatment with exogenous recombinant furin increase the average size of syncytia (from an average of~114 nuclei to~140-150 nuclei). Furthermore, inhibition of furin activity by treatment with 75 \u03bcM of the furin inhibitor dec-RVKR-CMK abrogated syncytia formation. In contrast, expression of EMC 205-S2\u2032 S was not accompanied by syncytia formation in all conditions tested, including when furin is overexpressed or present exogenously. These data confirm that the HKU205 S2\u2032 mutations abrogate furin-mediated fusion activation. Next, the luciferase gene reporter-containing MLV pseudovirions harboring either EMC wt or EMC 205-S2\u2032 S were further analyzed. Quantification by nanoparticle tracking analysis of the concentration of both types of pseudovirions shows that the introduction of the 205-S2\u2032 mutation did not significantly alter particle concentration produced compared with EMC wt S-pseudotyped particles (Supplementary Figure 2A) . EMC wt or EMC 205-S2\u2032 S-pseudotyped particles were used to infect Huh-7, Vero-E6 and MRC-5 cells ( Figure 3B ), along with control-pseudotyped particles: 'bald' or no envelope particles (\u0394env), and vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein-pseudotyped particles or VSV-G (Supplementary Figure 2B) . For the three cell lines, \u0394env particle infectivity was close to background levels observed in the non-infected (NI) control conditions (~10 2 range of relative luciferase units or RLU). When positive control VSV-G particles were assayed, infectivity measurements rose to~10 6 (Vero-E6) and~10 7 (Huh-7 and MRC-5) RLU levels, confirming that this system allows measurement of heterologous viral envelope protein-mediated entry and infectivity. For the MERS S-pseudotyped particles, in all cell lines tested, a significant drop in infectivity was observed for EMC 205-S2\u2032 S-pseudotyped particles compared with EMC wt S-pseudotyped particles, but the most pronounced effect was in Huh-7 cells (4.4-fold decrease) that naturally express high levels of furin. 8 Since there were no significant differences in viral concentrations between EMC wt and EMC 205-S2\u2032 S-pseudovirions (Supplementary Figure 2A) , we attribute the drop in infectivity to the mutation of the S2\u2032 site in the EMC 205-S2\u2032 S protein.",

Trypsin cleaved both EMC/2012 and HKU205 S2\u2032 peptides, with the EMC/2012 peptide still retaining a higher cleavage rate (EMC/2012 V max = 220.5 \u00b1 3.4 RFU/min, HKU205 V max = 67.6 \u00b1 1.3 RFU/min). Cathepsin L cleavage was detected for the EMC/2012 peptide (V max = 5.8 \u00b1 0.2 RFU/min), and to a much lesser extent for HKU205 S2\u2032 (V max = 2.2 \u00b1 0.1 RFU/min). V max data for the proteases tested in this study are summarized in Table 2 , and along with western blot data, suggest that HKU205 S has a more restricted range of activating proteases than EMC/2012, being unable to utilize furin and likely more dependent on trypsin-like proteases.",

The sequences were also compared with known furin cleavage substrates found in the MEROPS database.

Furin inhibitor treatment abrogated the formation of 205 EMC-S2\u2032 S-induced syncytia. These results confirm that switching the HKU205 S2\u2032 site to the EMC/2012 S2\u2032 site in the HKU205 S background allows for enhanced furin-mediated fusogenicity of the fusion protein. The 205 wt and 205 EMC-S2\u2032 S-pseudotyped particles were subsequently assayed for particle concentration by nanoparticle tracking analysis (Supplementary Figure 2A) . These measurements showed that there were no statistically significant differences in concentration of particles produced between 205 wt and 205 EMC-S2\u2032 S-pseudotyped particles and between these particles and the EMC wt and EMC 205-S2\u2032 S-pseudotyped particles.

However, a significant~2 log 10 increase of infectivity is observed when EMC/2012 S2\u2032 furin cleavage site is present (2.21 \u00d7 10 4 RLU), confirming that the furin-cleaved S2\u2032 site enhances fusion activation and infectivity.

Likewise, the pseudotyped particle infectivity assays have shown that wild-type HKU205 S-pseudovirions have very little infectivity, while substituting its S2\u2032 site with the furin site found in EMC/2012 significantly increased infectivity in Huh-7 cells, but did not restore it to the levels observed for wild-type EMC/2012 S-pseudovirions. Further investigation is required to understand the biological consequence of the other reported variations found in HKU205 S, particularly the substitutions in the S1 receptor-binding domain. In addition, because attempts to culture HKU205 virus have so far been unsuccessful, 12 we used a mammalian codon-optimized gene expression strategy, which allowed us to robustly express and analyze all MERS-CoV S variant proteins. Although rare, the fact that variations can occur in the MERS-CoV S2\u2032 site is of concern, because it is known for other pathogenic viruses that alterations in the cleavage-activation mechanism can have a profound impact on tropism and pathogenicity. This is well documented for the hemagglutinin protein of highly pathogenic avian . The cells were either untreated, co-transfected with a furin-encoding plasmid (furin overexpression), treated with exogenous furin (furin exogenous), or treated with 75 \u03bcM of the furin inhibitor dec-RVKR-CMK (furin inhibitor). The cells were then processed for immunofluorescence with labeling of S protein (false colored green) and nuclei (DAPI, blue). Scale bar represents 100 \u03bcm. Quantitative microscopy analysis was undertaken to assess the average sizes of syncytia induced by S expression. Ten syncytia were analyzed for each condition and data are the averages of nuclei/syncytium from three independent experiments (n = 3). (C) Effect of introducing the EMC/2012 S2\u2032 furin cleavage site on HKU205 S-mediated host cell entry. MLV-pseudotyped viruses harboring HKU205 S protein with either a wild type (205 wt ) or with a EMC/2012 S2\u2032 furin cleavage site (205 EMC-S2\u2032 ) and containing a luciferase reporter gene were used to infect human Huh-7 (liver) cells. Seventy-two hours post infection, cells were assayed for luciferase activity using a luminometer. Assays performed in triplicates and results are averages of relative luciferase units from two independent experiments (n = 2). For both B and C, error bars indicate SD and statistical significance analyses were performed using two-tailed Student's t-test. Not significant (NS), P40.05; highly significant, **Pr0.01; very highly significant, ***P \u2264 0.001. influenza strains. 26 In the case of coronaviruses, the cleavage site changes in HKU205 are reminiscent of the mutations selected in the spike S1/S2 and S2\u2032 cleavage sites of feline coronaviruses that are macrophage-tropic and the cause of lethal peritonitis in cats. 27, 28 For MERS-CoV, we have shown previously that the S2\u2032 furin cleavage site is not optimal, 8 and so may be only a few mutational steps away from acquiring a more efficiently processed polybasic furin site. The implications of this for viral pathogenesis remain unknown.",

Control conditions correspond to assaying the fluorogenic peptides without protease.However, the expression levels we have used here are likely to be different from the ones occurring during viral infection.
