            "text": "Transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) has caused devastating economic losses to the swine industry worldwide, despite extensive research focusing on the pathogenesis of virus infection. The molecular pathogenic mechanism of TGEV-induced diarrhea in piglets is unknown. Intestinal diarrhea is closely related to the function of the Na + /H + exchanger protein NHE3 in the brush border membrane of small intestine epithelial cells. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) may act to regulate NHE3 expression. In addition, EGFR may promote viral invasion of host cells. The present study aimed to determine whether NHE3 activity is regulated by altering EGFR expression to affect Na + absorption in TGEV-infected intestinal epithelial cells. Porcine intestinal epithelial cells were used as models for TGEV infection. The results showed that Na + absorption and NHE3 expression levels decreased in TGEV-infected cells. Proliferation of TGEV within IPEC-J2 cells could be inhibited by treatment with the EGFR inhibitor AG1478 and knockdown; resulting in recovery of Na + absorption in TGEV infected cells and increasing the activity and expression of NHE3. Moreover, we demonstrated that NHE3 activity was regulated through the EGFR/ERK pathway. Importantly, NHE3 mobility on the plasma membrane of TGEV infected cells was significantly weaker than that in normal cells, and EGFR inhibition and knockdown recovered this mobility. Our research indicated that NHE3 activity was negatively regulated by EGFR in TGEV-infected intestinal epithelial cells.",

The villi of jejunum and ileum become shorter after TGEV infection, which destroys the absorption function of intestinal epithelial cells, affecting the transport of nutrients and electrolytes, and increasing the osmotic pressure in the intestinal lumen, finally leading to severe diarrhea and dehydration. Nowadays, TGEV is one of the most important diseases threatening pork production worldwide. Diarrhea in piglets is accompanied by malnutrition, low immunity, serious stunting of growth and development, and a significant reduction in survival, with a mortality rate of up to 100% (Chae et al., 2000; Kim and Chae, 2001) . Therefore, a study on pathogenesis of diarrhea caused by TGEV in piglets would be beneficial to improve treatments and coping strategies to reduce the economic losses in the pig industry.",

The virus sequentially spreads in the nasal mucosa, lungs, digestive tract, and small intestine. The microvilli of the jejunum and ileum shrink sharply or even break down, decreasing the absorption area of the intestinal villi (Zhao et al., 2014) . Cell membrane transporter and ion channel transporter activities in intestinal epithelial decrease, resulting in disrupted Na + transport or an imbalance of absorption and secretion, causing substantial losses of nutrients and waterelectrolytes in intestinal epithelial cells (Sun et al., 2014) . As Na + absorption decreases, the osmotic pressure of the intestine increases abnormally, resulting in malabsorption diarrhea.",

The membrane proteins on the plasma membrane are mobile within the membrane (Lin and Nie, 1985) , allowing them to diffuse laterally in the lipid bilayer and move to the microvillus of the brush border membrane to perform their functions in nutrients absorption and material transport. The dynamic transport of membrane protein NHE3 has been studied using fluorescence bleaching recovery (FRAP) technology, which showed that the lysophosphatidic acid (LPA)/LPA5R signaling pathway, mediated by the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), is involved in the regulation of NHE3 activity in microvilli. LPA, as an inflammatory factor, directly induces intestinal anti-secretion, and intensively stimulated NHE3 activity to inhibit secretory diarrhea induced by cholera. The FRAP results showed that LPA could increase NHE3 mobility in inflammatory bowel disease. The dynamic transport of NHE3 on intestinal microvillus was regulated by stimulating an increase in extracellular secretion (Lin et al., 2010) .",

Studies showed that diarrhea could decrease the activity and mobility of NHE3 in the intestinal microvillus (Cha et al., 2010; Lin et al., 2010) , and the amount of NHE3 decreased rapidly. A few studies on the regulation of NHE3 activity have been performed under normal physiological conditions; however, the effects on the activity of NHE3 during diarrhea caused by TGEV infection have not been reported. EGFR may influence TGEV entrance, enhancing the ability of the virus to infect intestinal epithelial cells . In addition, EGFR is involved in the regulation of NHE3 activity during its dynamic transport. We hypothesized that in TGEV-infected cells, the dynamic transport of NHE3 would be regulated by TGEV infection. NHE3 mobility on the microvillus of the brush border membrane would be altered and NHE3 activity would be inhibited, ultimately affecting Na + absorption in intestinal epithelial cells. It is important to explore this possible regulatory mechanism of the pathogenesis of diarrhea caused by TGEV infection in piglets.",

High laser power (100% power, 100% transmission) was used for photobleaching. Before and after bleaching, we used 20% laser power with 1% transmission to measure the fluorescence. During the measurement, the 488 nm line of a 400 mW Kr/Ar laser was used. One image was collected every 60 s, and the bleaching and recovery were set with 10 time series.

Under normal physiological conditions, Na + /H + exchanger NHE3 is generally responsible for the intake of Na + in intestinal epithelial cells. Thus, cellular Na + absorption is determined by the NHE3 activity. In mammals, the deletion of the NHE3 gene profoundly weakened Na + absorption. Therefore, we examined the changes in the intra-and extracellular Na + concentration in intestinal epithelial cells using flame atomic absorption spectrometry at 0, 48, and 72 h post-TGEV infection. Compared with the control group, the extracellular Na + concentration of the TGEV-infected group continued to increase, reaching its highest levels at 72 h post-infection (p.i.) ( Figure 1A) . The intracellular Na + concentration gradually increased up to 48 h p.i., and then began to decrease in the last period ( Figure 1B) . By contrast, the intra and extracellular Na + levels in the control showed almost no change, suggesting that TGEV infection affected the intra-and extracellular Na + concentration in piglet intestinal epithelial cells. Subsequently, we examined the expression level of the NHE3 gene ( Figure 1C) . In IPEC-J2 cells during 72 h of TGEV infection, after an initial increase in expression, the mRNA level of NHE3 decreased to a level lower than that of the control.

            "text": "During viral invasion of host cells, the first step is to combine with receptors on the cell membrane, and then transfer signals into cells to stimulate a series of downstream signal cascade reactions (Homma and Yasui, 1968) . The transmembrane receptor EGFR can promote virus invasion of host cells and activate downstream signaling pathways, of which the most common pathway is the MAPK signaling pathway. Diarrhea weakens the Na + absorption function of intestinal epithelial cells. Na + absorption is primarily mediated by NHE3 in the cell membrane. Therefore, we assessed whether the activity and expression of NHE3 was regulated via activation of the EGFR/ERK signaling pathway in IPEC-J2 cells during TGEV infection. As shown in Figure 4 , we chose 30 \u00b5M AG1478 and DMSO to treat cells for 24 h, respectively, and then infected them with TGEV. Meanwhile, normal cells without any treatment were regarded as the control group. As shown in Figure 4B , the NHE3 protein level in the TGEVinfected group was significantly decreased compared with that in normal cells group, and its level in the TGEV plus AG1478 group was increased compared with that in the TGEV-infected group. Compared with the control group, the level of phosphorylated EGFR or ERK in the TGEV-infected group was significantly increased ( Figure 4A) . However, the level of p-EGFR in the TGEV plus AG1478 group was significantly lower than that in the TGEV-infected group ( Figure 4C) . The level of p-ERK was also downregulated ( Figure 4D) . We confirmed the knockdown efficiency of EGFR (Figures 4E,F) . As well as the effect of EGFR inhibitor AG1478 on NHE3 via EGFR interference, transfection of PLKO.1-EGFR-p-shRNA in IPEC-J2 cells resulted in a significant increase in NHE3 activity, comparing with the TGEV-infected group (Figure 4H) , suggesting that EGFR played a role in the regulation of NHE3 activity in IPEC-J2 cells, NHE3 activity could recover in TGEV-infected group after inhibition of EGFR. On the contrary, both phosphorylation levels of EGFR and ERK were significantly decreased compared with TGEV-infected group (Figures 4I,J) , as well as knockdown of EGFR reduced the phosphorylation of EGFR and ERK in the TGEV-infected cells. These results suggested that the EGFR/ERK pathway is one of the pathways that regulate NHE3 protein activity in TGEV-infected cells.",

The membrane transporter NHE3 is mainly responsible for the electrically neutral translocation of Na + /H + in intestinal epithelial cells, and changes in the transport capacity of Na + /H + on the brush border membrane is determined by changes in NHE3 activity. In general, NHE3 on the plasma membrane diffuses to the top of the brush border to exert its function and stimulate the Na + absorption in the intestinal epithelium. To further identify the dynamic changes of NHE3 on the brush border membrane caused by TGEV infection in small intestinal epithelial cells, NHE3 mobility on the membrane of TGEV-infected cells after treatment with EGFR was analyzed using FRAP. The recombinant expression plasmid pEGFP-NHE3 was transfected into IPEC-J2 cells and cultured at 37 \u2022 C with 5% CO 2 . The stable expression of the recombinant plasmid was observed under an inverted fluorescence microscope. The transient expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) was observed under the control of a CMV promoter. Green fluorescence was produced using a 490 nm blue wavelength under the fluorescence microscope. The recombinant fluorescent-protein was expressed stably for 48 h and reached a peak at 24-120 h after transfection, as shown in Figure 5 . Untransfected normal cells showed no fluorescence. The above results indicated that recombinant fluorescent plasmid pEGFP-NHE3 was transfected into IPEC-J2 cells and expressed the EGFP-NHE3 fusion protein successfully.

According to the analysis of the calculation results (Figure 9) , the mobile fraction of the empty carrier group was reduced by 96% compared with the control group, and the difference was very significant (p < 0.01). The mobile fraction of NHE3 in TGEVinfected group decreased significantly by 54% (0.01 < p < 0.05). The mobile fraction of NHE3 in the TGEV plus AG1478 group increased by 33% compared with that in the TGEV group. The results showed that the non-quenched fluorescence molecules gradually diffused from the unbleached region to the bleached area with increasing time, and the fluorescence of the bleached region gradually recovered. Therefore, we believe that the membrane transporter NHE3 is mobile on the cell surface, and the different treatment groups had different NHE3 mobilities. NHE3 mobility on the plasma membrane was decreased in cells infected with TGEV compared with normal cells, and NHE3 mobility in cells infected with TGEV after treatment with AG1478 increased. These results indicated that decreased EGFR activity in intestinal epithelial cells was accompanied by increased NHE3 mobility after TGEV infection. Thus, EGFR negatively regulates NHE3 mobility on the plasma membrane in TGEVinfected cells. ",

            "text": "It is believed that the Na + /H + exchanger protein NHE3 has two main functions. One is to transport extracellular Na + into cells and the other is to secrete intracellular H + to the extracellular area. Under normal physiological conditions, homeostasis is maintained between the intra and extra-cellular Na + concentration. Na + /H + exchanger 3 (NHE3) and Naglucose cotransporter-2 can deliver Na + from the extracellular medium into cells. At the same time, an intracellular Na-K pump will pump out the intracellular Na + , thus to maintaining a normal Na + concentration gradient on both sides of the plasma membrane. Thus, the Na + concentration in inside and outside of uninfected cells seemed to be stable, without any obvious increases or decreases, which was in accordance with the theoretical basis. By contrast, TGEV infection resulted in a decrease in Na + absorption and reduced Na + transportation from the outside to inside of cells by NHE3, leading to a gradual increase in the extracellular Na + concentration and a decrease in the intracellular Na + concentration. Sodium/glucose cotransporter 1 (SGLT1) also plays a role in intracellular Na + absorption, acting as a Na + -glucose co-transporter, which transports Na + across the plasma membrane of animal cells down an electrochemical gradient. Glucose is \"dragged\" into the cells against the concentration gradient. Meanwhile, SGLT1 can promote Na + absorption and glucose uptake of epithelial cells. Research has shown that SGLT1 plays a critical role during the process of TGEV infection in cells. Dai et al. (2016) reported that SGLT1 protein levels were upregulated and glucose uptake in the small intestine was enhanced in the early stage of TGEV infection of IPEC-J2 cells. However, later, the glucose intake of the intestinal epithelium decreased (Dai et al., 2016) .",

As the absorption area of intestinal villi decreases (Zhao et al., 2014) , the quantity of NHE3 and mobility of in the brush border would also decrease.

In addition, the EGFR inhibitor AG1478 and kockdown of EGFR downregulated the levels of p-EGFR and p-ERK. Compared with TGEV-infected cells, the NHE3 levels in cells with TGEV infection after using EGFR inhibition and shRNA lentiviral particles were upregulated. These results showed that TGEV infection regulated NHE3 via the EGFR/ERK signaling pathway, and there was a negative correlation between EGFR and NHE3.

Inhibition of EGFR reduced the damage caused by TGEV to intestinal epithelial cells, ameliorated the loss of intracellular Na + caused by TGEV infection, restored the normal function of membrane transporter NHE3, and promoted the transport of extracellular Na + into cells. The results indicated that TGEV could bind and activate the specific receptor EGFR in porcine intestinal epithelial cells after infection, leading to phosphorylation of ERK and regulation of the expression and activity NHE3, which resulted in dysfunctional NHE3 transport in intestinal epithelial cells.

The main mechanism of this regulation is that PKC\u03b4-dependent LPA could recognize LPA5R to activate EGFR and ERK, resulting in their phosphorylation.

The results showed that the mobile fraction of pEGFP-NHE3 in the uninfected cells was the highest and had the strongest mobility. We inferred that NHE3 is very mobile on the microvillus of the brush border membrane of small intestinal epithelial cells under normal physiological conditions. Continuous Na + absorption is accomplished through NHE3 at the top of the plasma membrane by way of the lateral movement of the brush border membrane.",

Compared with that in the TGEV-infected cells, NHE3 mobility in the TGEV-infected cells after EGFR inhibition was significantly increased. This result suggested that inhibition of EGFR activity could attenuate the damage to the brush border membrane microvilli caused by TGEV invasion and reduce intracellular virus proliferation in intestinal epithelial cells. In addition, NHE3 activity would be enhanced on the brush border membrane. Therefore, we speculated that the intensive mobility of NHE3 on the plasma membrane is beneficial for Na + absorption in porcine intestinal epithelial cells. This speculation needs to be proven in further experiments.",
