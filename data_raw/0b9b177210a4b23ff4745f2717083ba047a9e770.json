Studies on SPB have been hampered by the limited availability of markers for SPB in predelivery clinical samples that can be easily compared with gestational age-matched normal controls. We hypothesize that SPB involves aberrant placental RNA expression, and that such RNA transcripts can be detected in predelivery maternal plasma samples, which can be compared with gestational age-matched controls.",

Among the genes represented by those probes, we observed an over-representation of functions in RNA stabilization, extracellular matrix binding, and acute inflammatory response. Using RT-quantitative PCR, we observed differences in the RNA concentrations of certain genes only between the SPB and STB placentas, but not between the STB and term elective cesarean delivery placentas. Notably, 36 RNA transcripts were observed at placental microarray signals higher than a threshold, which indicated the possibility of their detection in maternal plasma. Among them, the IL1RL1 mRNA was tested in plasma samples taken from 37 women. It was detected in 6 of 10 (60%) plasma samples collected during the presentation of preterm labor (#32.9 weeks) in women eventually giving SPB, but was detected in only 1 of 27 (4%) samples collected during matched gestational weeks from women with no preterm labor (Fisher exact test, p = 0.00056).",

This is in line with the literature that intrauterine infection or inflammation is implicated in the pathological processes of SPB [36] . Interestingly, we also observed an over-representation of gene functions involving RNA stabilization (Table 5) . Recently, a compound with ribonuclease inhibitor activity has been shown to limit the growth of important gram-positive bacterial pathogens and protected against S. aureus pathogenesis in an animal model of infection [37] . We speculate that the up-regulation of genes involved in RNA stabilization (e.g. ribonuclease inhibitor activity) may be a response to invading pathogens in the SPB placentas.",

The THBS1 protein has been found to be elevated in the cervicovaginal fluids of women undergoing SPB, compared with those undergoing term births [39] . The THBS1 mRNA has also been shown to be elevated during term and preterm parturition in the myometrium of sheep [40] and the uterus of mice [41] .

Recently, a linkage, haplotype sharing, and association analysis has provided the evidence for IGF1R as a SPB predisposition gene [14] . Previously, a 11-kDa proteolytic fragment of the insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1 (IGFBP1) protein was reported to be upregulated in the amniotic fluid and maternal serum of pregnant women with intra-amniotic infection [17] . Taken altogether, IGF and its associated molecues may play some roles in the pathogenesis of SPB. In our GO analysis, among the up-regulated genes in the SPB placentas, the frequency of IGF2BP3 and other genes involved in posttranscriptional regulation were 4.52-fold overrepresented (Table S7) . Moreover, among the up-regulated genes, the frequency of IGF1R and 9 other genes involved in antiapoptosis were 4.63-fold overrepresented (Table S7) .

In contrast, the IL1RL1 mRNA was detected in only 3.7% of maternal plasma samples collected during the same gestational period in women not in labor. The data suggest that the existence of IL1RL1 mRNA in the predelivery maternal plasma is associated with preterm labor and/or SPB. This promising data warrant further investigation. First, how early does the IL1RL1 mRNA appear in maternal blood before SPB? Second, will the IL1RL1 mRNA in maternal plasma improve the sensitivity of the existing methods, namely fetal fibronectin from cervicovaginal secretion and transvaginal cervical length [43, 44] , in predicting SPB? Third, is IL1RL1 mRNA in maternal plasma involved in all clinical subgroups of SPB (e.g. with or without preterm pre-labor rupture of membranes, cervical incompetence, antepartum hemorrhage)?",

Besides, to further study the molecular functions of the above genes in pregnancy and SPB, one may overexpress or knockout the concerned genes in animal models. Nevertheless, the work presented here has provided the essential groundwork for such further attempts to study SPB. Before this work, the difference between the genomewide expression profiles of the SPB and STB placentas had not been compared, and systematic identification of markers for SPB in maternal blood had not been possible.

Actin filaments are a major component of the contractile apparatus of skeletal muscle and the microfilaments of the cytoskeleton of eukaryotic cells. The filaments, comprising polymerized globular actin molecules, appear as flexible structures with a diameter of 5-9 nm.

In the cytoskeleton they are most highly concentrated in the cortex of the cell just beneath the plasma membrane. (cellular compartment)",
