For example, lung cancer is one of the most common diseases with low survival rates worldwide; early detection of the lung cancer is known to improve the chances of successful treatment.

            "text": "Phase contrast imaging (PCI) is a relatively new imaging technique, which can provide high contrast images by using phase shift of the X-ray. It is well known that X-ray is a form of electromagnetic wave. When it propagates through an object, both the amplitude and the phase of the wave are modified. It can be described by a complex reflective index [11] , given by n = 12d2ib. The imaginary part b is related to the attenuation based on absorption of the object, which we use in the conventional X-ray imaging. Unfortunately, the variations in Xray absorption between different biological soft tissues are quite small; this technique may lead to very low contrast and poor spatial resolution. The real part d is responsible for the X-ray phase shift. For biological soft tissues, the phase shift is almost one thousand times greater than the absorption term. Therefore, the aim of phase contrast imaging is to use the information of X-ray phase shift and convert it into image contrast [12] . This technique can greatly improve the image quality of soft tissues, particularly at the interface of tissues where the refractive index changes significantly. During recent years, it has been widely used by researchers for imaging of small animals. Among all the main PCI methods, in-line X-ray phase contrast imaging (IL-XPCI) is the simplest and the most straightforward, making it more suitable for clinical applications than other methods [13] . IL-XPCI has previously been used to study soft tissues of both human and small animals such as mice, rats, and rabbits. The results are satisfactory: high resolution images were obtained [14] [15] [16] . It may be an alternative method for lung observation and it is totally noninvasive.",

Due to the significant difference in density between air and tissues, the inner edges of the airway can result in marked edge enhancement in the phase contrast images. This has previously been proven by Suzuki et al [16] . Nevertheless, for the large number of alveoli, the fine structures were averaged out. Other researchers like Parsons and Sera et al. have utilized IL-XPCI to study lungs, and successfully generated the three-dimensional models of mouse airways [7, 17] . Despite advances in lung imaging using IL-XPCI, threedimensional visualization of the alveoli in the intact animals has remained elusive. Nevertheless, the alveoli are important tiny structures through which gas exchange occurs. The morphology and distribution of alveoli can reveal information regarding lung health. For the diagnosis of drowning or other types of respiratory disorder like pneumonia, asthma, chronic bronchitis and emphysema, the shape of alveoli can be of considerable value [3, 18] . Furthermore, the morphology and growth of alveoli in embryos can reveal the secret of lung development, which has long fascinated biologists and mathematicians [19] . Therefore, the aim of this study is to explore these small alveoli.",

A comparison between original CT slice and threshold-based segmentation result is presented in Figure 2 . The threshold was chosen at the valley of the histogram ( Figure 2B ).

The ratio of maximum and minimum diameters reflects the morphology of the alveoli to some extent. If this ratio approximates one, the shape of the alveolus is closer to a spheroid. The alveoli provide an enormous surface area for respiratory exchange; the change of alveolar surface area is closely related to lung health.

            "text": "The lungs are composed of sponge-like soft tissues. Detection of soft tissues using conventional absorption-based radiography is limited by the variation in tissue density. Since PCI is a phasesensitive technique, it facilitates the visualization of fine structures, particularly in soft tissues. This technique has opened a new window for the visualization of lung. As a current imaging modality, clinical thin-section CT can be used to visualize airways with an internal diameter larger than 2 mm. It is better than conventional radiography and can provide more detailed information [6] . However, the terminal airspaces cannot be detected via this technique. Micro-CT for laboratory studies has a much higher resolution on the order of microns. Nevertheless, it is still based on the absorption information of the X-ray. The alveolar wall and the air space can not provide sufficient contrast to be observed [20] . A few studies have applied magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to the lung imaging. Although MRI can provide excellent soft tissue imaging and functional imaging, the limitations lie in the low spatial resolution and long acquisition times [21] . The measurement of bronchial diameter will be hampered by these limitations, because normal spatial resolution of MRI is in the range of 4-6 mm and only a few can reach up to 1 mm [22] . The lung is an air-filled organ. At the air-tissue boundary, the refractive index changes significantly, so the lung becomes highly visible in PCI images. The lung images in our experiment have shown dramatic improvement in quality, and the alveoli can be clearly discerned. The theoretical spatial resolution of our experimental system is about 1 mm, while the diameter of mature mouse alveoli range from 38 to 80 mm and human alveoli are larger at 200-250 mm [15] . Thus, the resolution of PCI is adequate for micro-structures observation in lung. Though the radiation dose in our experiment was relatively larger than that used in clinical imaging, it can be reduced by the use of high energy X-ray, since contrast is not dependent on absorption of the beam [12, 15] . In addition, compared to other existing PCI methods, IL-XPCI requires relatively simple instrument. Most importantly, conventional laboratory X-ray source can be used as the light source, although longer exposure times are required [13] . The equipments are similar to conventional radiography. In this regard, it has the potential to be used in clinical diagnosis. When it comes to studying the architecture of micro-structures in lung, histological biopsy is the most commonly used method [9] . But it is invasive and can not be repeated [10, 23] . During the process of invasive sampling, anesthesia is often required and tissue deformation frequently happen which is a major disadvantage when studying the morphology of the organs. There has long been a desire to explain breathing mechanism at the alveolar level. Unfortunately, a full understanding of these fine structures' original morphology is not available, because the lung will collapse when opening the thoracic cage at autopsy, due to the loss of negative pleural pressure [18] . Some researchers used confocal microscope to evaluate alveolar dynamics in the mouse lungs. However, this technique is limited by the depth of imaging (about 50 mm) [24] . How lungs develop has long fascinated biologists and mathematicians. Nevertheless, this process cannot be visualized in living embryos with current techniques [19] . Therefore, we adopted IL-XPCI to observe the lung non-invasively. An intact mouse was used to the maximum extent to preserve the organ's original morphology. In addition, previous studies have shown that deceased lungs can maintain a sufficient aeration level to be visualized [15] .",

Moreover, the measurement of alveoli showed the ability of PCI to observe the morphology of lung.

Despite the advances in spatial resolution and contrast of phase contrast imaging, real-time Xray phase tomography of the live animals has remained difficult. Live animals can only be imaged in two dimensions. The major obstacle in realizing this is the motion artifacts caused by breathing and cardiac motion of the animals, which will lead to serious blur in the reconstructed CT images. It is well known that the alveoli in lung are very small; any noise can influence the accuracy of the imaging result. Some attempts have been made to live animals imaging by taking the projection images at a specific breathing phase in synchrony with ECG signals [26] . But the animals have to be anaesthetized and with their breathing controlled by a ventilator. High-speed X-ray phase tomography may be another possible solution to live animal imaging by substantially reducing the imaging time. In fact, finishing a CT in one respiration phase is possible but the rotation speed of the sample stage and the time resolution of the detector need to be improved [27] . Another limitation was the lack of pathological samples. In this study, a normal 1-day-old mouse was used. The results proved that IL-XPCI is possible for lung micro-structures observation. Lung disorder models were missing, such as asthma, emphysema and lung cancer. We plan to evaluate these disorder models in our IL-XPCI imaging experiment as next steps, which are in progress now.",

Apparently, the optimal contrast depends on the spatial frequency, wavelength, and the objectdetector distance [14] . The in-line X-ray phase contrast imaging experiment was performed at X-ray imaging and biomedical application beamline (BL13W1) of Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF). SSRF is the third-generation synchrotron radiation source in China. Figure 6 shows the schematic image of the experiment setup. It consisted of two monochromator crystals, one automatic rotation sample stage and one X-ray sensitive CCD detector. The incident white synchrotron X-ray beam was first monochromatized by two Si (111) prefect crystals. The tunable energy range was from 8 to 72.5 keV, with the energy resolution of about 0.5%. In our experiment, it was adjusted to 18 keV. The theoretical spatial resolution of the system was about 1 mm. Subsequently, the highly parallel and monochromatic beam projected on the object was imaged. The CCD detector then recorded the transmitted beam at a distance of 1.2 m from the sample. During this distance, the downstream image was enhanced by Fresnel diffraction and the phase modulation was transformed via amplitude modulation. An X-ray sensitive CCD camera, which had maximum resolution of 4008 pixels62672 pixels with 13 mm613 mm each, was used as a two-dimensional detector to transform the beam into an image. During the CT data acquisition, the specimen was rotated around its cylinder axis for 180u. The number of projections was 1296, with exposure time of 80 milliseconds for each projection, and the total scanning time was 208 seconds. The surface dose was about 8 mGy for each projection. All the parameters were selected in order to obtain high quality images of the mouse lung.",

Then an image segmentation method was applied to separate the lung tissues from the background. Since the histograms of our lung images had two peaks and a valley between them, the threshold for image segmentation can be chosen automatically at the bottom of this valley [30] . The other pixels with intensity lower than the threshold were set to zero. After this step, the ribs associated with many background signals considered as noise were removed. The whole lung airways can be segmented from this volume dataset by manually set a gray-level threshold. Due to the complexity of the lung structures and their irregular shapes and similar gray levels on the images, threshold-based image segmentation method was inadequate to separate the bronchial tree from the whole lung airways. In this study, we developed an image segmentation method based on 3D region growing to separate bronchial tree which was a semi-automatic procedure. It started in manually placing the seed point in the section of bronchus as well as setting the intensity threshold. Under the control of the intensity threshold, the growing would stop when the bronchial tree were separated.",
