However, determining the cause of pneumonia by sampling the lung directly through bronchoscopy or transthoracic lung aspiration is possible in only a subset of cases and requires technical expertise not available in most settings [2] . A definitive etiologic diagnosis can be made by isolating pathogens from blood or parapneumonic fluid, but yields are low (<10%) [3] . Gram stain or culture of a sputum specimen correlates well with blood isolation of Streptococcus pneumoniae (57% and 79%, respectively) in adults with pneumonia [4] , about 75% of whom can produce a specimen adequate for bacterial pathogen identification [5, 6] . However, there is less experience using sputum specimens in children for etiologic diagnosis because of the challenges posed by contamination with upper respiratory tract secretions and frequent colonization of the upper respiratory tract with known respiratory pathogens, such as pneumococcus [7, 8] . Although upper respiratory tract specimens (eg, nasopharyngeal [NP] swab specimens) are often used for diagnostic purposes in children with respiratory viral and some bacterial infections, there is concern whether the results reflect the cause of pneumonia [9, 10] .",

However, for certain organisms, IS specimens seem superior to NP/OP specimens (eg, in cases with radiographic pneumonia, parainfluenza 1 was detected from IS specimens alone in 2.8% vs 0.5% for NP/OP specimens alone). An analysis stratified by pneumonia severity (severe or very severe) and age <6 months showed pathogen detection rates from NP/OP and IS specimens very similar to those indicated in Table 3 (data not shown). To assess whether the added yield of the IS specimen was related to collection of a sputum specimen per se or to collection of an additional respiratory specimen of any type, we compared the added yield of low-quality IS specimens (ie, those presumably from, or contaminated by, secretions from the upper respiratory tract) with the yield of NP/OP specimens. The added yield of low-quality IS specimens was similar ( Figure 1 vs Supplementary Figure 1 ). There was no difference in the prevalence or the density of P. jirovecii by IS or NP/OP specimens among cases with radiographic pneumonia (Table 3; Supplementary Table 3) . Among HIV-positive children with radiographic pneumonia, the overall P. jirovecii detection rate was higher (19.7%) than in all HIV-negative cases with radiographic pneumonia (10.6%). In the latter group of HIV-negative children, there was a higher prevalence of P. jirovecii (17% vs 9%; P = .01) among children who were severely malnourished (weight for age less than \u22123 z-scores below the median of the WHO child growth standards) than among those who were not. There was little added value in seeking the detection of P. jirovecii in IS versus NP/ OP specimens. Among 81 HIV-positive children with radiographic pneumonia, P. jirovecii was detected in both IS and NP/ OP specimens in 13 cases, IS specimens alone in 2, and NP/ OP specimens alone in only 1. This represents an increase in yield of only 1% in the detection of P. jirovecii when assessing IS specimens in addition to NP/OP specimens ( Among cases with radiographic pneumonia, pathogen density in either IS or NP/OP specimens did not show a consistent pattern across pathogens. As indicated by the proportion of cases with a difference in PCR density >1 log 10 copies/mL, the density was greater in the IS specimen than in the NP/OP specimen only for parainfluenza 1, and greater in the NP/OP specimen for 3 organisms (Haemophilus influenzae, M. catarrhalis, and S. pneumoniae) (Supplementary Table 3 ).",

Although ideal in theory, this is quite difficult to establish in practice. In the current large study of childhood pneumonia etiology, which used highly standardized methods across 9 sites, we found generally good agreement between NP/OP and IS specimens in the detection of common respiratory pathogens with PCR and no clear diagnostic benefit of IS specimens. At a population level, multiplex PCR of IS specimens to identify respiratory organisms is likely to contribute little to our understanding of the etiology of pneumonia, beyond the information provided by NP/OP specimens. In a recent study reported by Zar et al [32] , in which children hospitalized with pneumonia were investigated using both NP and IS specimens and laboratory methods comparable to those used in the PERCH study, a proportion of pneumonia cases were detected in the IS specimens only. We found similar Figure 2 .

Radiographic evidence of pneumonia was defined as consolidation and/or other infiltrates. Nonpneumonia was defined as a normal chest radiograph, blood culture negative for pathogens, and either (1) a normal respiratory rate or no hypoxemia in the absence of crackles or (2) a normal respiratory rate and no hypoxemia in the presence of crackles.

We could have more adequately assessed this hypothesis had we collected a second NP/OP specimen and compared results from 1 versus 2 specimens.",

Furthermore, organism detection by IS specimen PCR was not associated with radiographic pneumonia compared with nonpneumonia, after controlling for the organism's presence in NP/OP specimens. Notably, this comparator group consisted of children who met the WHO case definition of severe pneumonia despite normal chest radiographic findings and the absence of many pneumonia clinical characteristics, so it does not represent a true control group (ie, nonhospitalized children). The observation that the NP/ OP specimens from nonpneumonia cases were enriched for certain respiratory pathogens compared with the NP/OP specimens from the controls (Supplemental Table 4 ) is an important limitation of this analysis and suggests that a proportion of subjects in the nonpneumonia group were hospitalized with clinically milder respiratory illness. An additional limitation to this analysis is that the nonpneumonia group was not equally represented across sites.",

In a 2007-2008 study in China of children hospitalized with CAP with pneumonic infiltrates on chest radiographs, a respiratory virus was detected with PCR in 272 of 273 IS specimens from children with CAP (99.6%) and 80 of 81 IS specimens (98.8%) from children with a chronic respiratory condition [17] . The most prevalent viruses in the IS specimens of children with CAP included rhinovirus (17.2%), human bocavirus (28%), RSV (37.4%), cytomegalovirus (92%), and several other human herpesviruses [17] . Although some viruses were detected more frequently in cases with CAP than in those without CAP, NP and OP specimens were not obtained, so it is not known whether the IS specimen would have added diagnostic value above and beyond an NP/OP specimen. In studies in Kenya and Finland, a respiratory pathogen was detected with PCR of IS specimens in more than half of children hospitalized with pneumonia, findings generally similar to those reported here, but with a few notable differences (eg, RSV was detected in 4% of cases in Finland, 16% in Kenya, and 25% in the current study) [13, 14, 16] .",

The added value in the detection of P. jirovecii was minimal in the HIVpositive children with radiographic pneumonia; however, collection of both IS and NP/OP specimens provides the highest yield and may be worthwhile to ensure proper diagnosis and treatment. Determination of infection versus colonization with P. jirovecii in these cases would require assessment of organism density and clinical correlation [34] . Although the diagnostic yield from an IS specimen may not be sufficient to justify this mildly invasive procedure as a routine part of the diagnostic workup for CAP, IS specimens are still important in cases with suspected tuberculosis and may also be useful in those in whom certain other pathogens (eg, B. pertussis, M. pneumoniae) are suspected. The lack of utility of bacterial cultures of IS specimens in determining the cause of pneumonia in children <5 years of age is reported on elsewhere [20] .",
