We performed lung aspirate culture and PCR as well as blood culture; most studies of pneumonia aetiology have previously only used blood culture to identify bacterial aetiologies. Lung aspiration was performed in a select group of children with pneumonia (22%), therefore our findings do not necessarily represent the spectrum of aetiology of radiological pneumonia in this population. Selecting only children with focal, lobar or segmental consolidation meant that most cases of PcP were likely to be excluded, which probably accounts for the lower overall case fatality rate in our study than has been reported in comparable studies [11] . The median age of our group was higher than that of children with pneumonia presenting to Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital [11] ; pathogens that commonly occur in infants such as RSV and PcP may therefore be under-represented in our study. Lung aspirate PCR was only designed to identify a small number of bacteria, and did not identify Gram negative organisms such as Klebsiella or nontyphoidal salmonella. Validated PCR assays for Klebsiella or nontyphoidal salmonella or Staphylococcus aureus were not available in our laboratory.",

The fact that urine was not tested for antibiotic activity may have resulted in a significant under-reporting of previous antibiotic exposure, and may have contributed to the low culture positivity rate despite positive bacterial PCR. An organism identified in a sample obtained directly from consolidated lung is more likely to be the causative agent than are organisms retrieved from samples such as from nasopharyngeal aspirates and even from bronchoalveolar lavage because of the risk of contamination of these samples with carriage isolates [8] . Nasopharyngeal carriage of pneumococcus is very common among well infants in regions such as Malawi [12] . A limitation of RT-PCR compared to culture is that it does not provide antibiotic susceptibility data. Serotype data can now be provided from lung aspirate samples using Luminex technology [13] , or PCR [14] , [15] but these assays were not available to us at the time of the study.",

That study however had a significantly higher complication rate, with pneumothorax developing in 18% of children, compared with the complication rate in our study of 2%.

[19] suggests that the host immune system recognises HBoV as a pathogen by eliciting significant antibody responses. HBoV has also been associated with pneumonia requiring hospitalization in young children in Thailand [20] . Our study is the first study to report HBoV detection in lung aspirate samples in children with radiological pneumonia, strongly suggesting that the infection arose from the lower airways as opposed to merely colonising the nasopharynx. A recent study from Finland found high concentrations of HBoV in induced sputum, also suggesting that the virus may have originated from the lower airways [21] .",

In that study, 4.7%of children were bacteraemic, compared to 15% in our study. In another recent study from Mozambique, 49% of nasopharyngeal aspirate samples from children under 5 years with severe pneumonia had at least one respiratory virus detected by PCR [23] . Viral infection was more prevalent in HIV-infected children, and in-hospital mortality was highest in children with invasive bacterial co-infection and HIV infection [23] . Given that all the children reported in these studies fulfilled the WHO criteria for severe pneumonia, and would therefore have received parenteral antibiotics, there is now an urgent need for reliable, affordable point of care diagnostics to help differentiate bacterial from viral aetiologies in an attempt to promote judicious antibiotic prescribing. We previously reported the performance of five diagnostic biomarkers to predict serious bacterial infection (SBI) in African children [24] . In the current study reported here, median C-reactive protein and procalcitonin levels on admission were significantly higher in children with confirmed bacterial pneumonia than in children with pneumonia without bacterial confirmation, but there was a degree of overlap (data not shown). A larger study assessing the performance of biomarkers of SBI in all children presenting with severe pneumonia is now indicated, augmented by molecular diagnostic testing to enhance diagnosis of bacterial infection. This will allow a more accurate prediction of the utility of biomarkers to guide antibiotic prescribing.",

HIV testing was done following a separate written informed consent with preand post-test counselling provided by a trained nurse counsellor, for those who accepted testing. HIV status was determined in all patients. In children $18 months, HIV status was assessed using at least two of the following tests; Unigold (Trinity Biotech, Ireland), Serocard (Trinity Biotech, Wicklow, Ireland), or Determine-HIV (Abbott Laboratories, Illinois, USA). In children under 18 months, and those with discordant antibody tests, HIV status was determined using Amplicor HIV-1 DNA (Roche Diagnostics, USA).",

Real-time quantitative PCR for CMV was performed using the ABI 7500 Sequence detection system (Taqman) using primers which have been previously described [29] . Real-time PCR for Pneumocystis jirovecii amplified a section of the large subunit of the mitochondrial RNA. Qualitative PCR was also performed on the lung aspirate fluid for Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), Human metapneumovirus (hMPV), Influenza A+B, Parainfuenza virus 1-4, Coronavirus (HKU-1, NL63, OC43), Rhinovirus, Adenovirus, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Human Bocavirus (HBoV). Briefly, RNA and DNA was extracted using commercial kits (Qiagen, Basingstoke , UK). Extracted RNA was used in a duplex RT-PCR method for RSV nucleocapsid and hMPV matrix gene detection using primers previously described [30] , [31] . A multiplex influenza RT-PCR was performed to identify Influenza A and B and a second multiplex RT-PCR was utilized for the detection of parainfluenza virus types 1-4 [32] . Adenovirus, Chlamydia and M. pneumoniae were detected using previously published protocols [33] . The HCoV genomes were amplified separately by RT-PCR using previously published primers for; HCoV NL63 [34] , HCoV HKU1 [35] , HCoV229E, and HCoVOC43 [36] . Bocavirus detection used the primers published previously [37] and rhinovirus detection used the multiplex method described by Choi [36] . The multiplex PCR assays for these respiratory viruses have been used by our group in previous studies [38] , [39] , [40] . Lung aspirate fluid was not cultured for Mycobacterium tuberculosis.",
