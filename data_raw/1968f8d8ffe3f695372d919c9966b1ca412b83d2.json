Transcription factors play important roles in the disordered gene expression and liver injury caused by HBV. However, the molecular mechanisms behind this observation have not been defined. Results: In this study, we observed that circulating prostaglandin (PGE) 2 synthesis was increased in patients with chronic hepatitis B infection, and detected elevated cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 expression in HBV-and HBxexpressing liver cells. Likewise, the association of HBx with C/EBP\u03b2 contributed to the induction of COX-2. The COX-2 promoter was hypomethylated in HBV-positive cells, and specific demethylation of CpG dinucleotides within each of the two NF-AT sites in the COX-2 promoter resulted in the increased binding affinity of NF-AT to the cognate sites in the promoter, followed by increased COX-2 expression and PGE2 accumulation. The DNA methylatransferase DNMT3B played a key role in the methylation of the COX-2 promoter, and its decreased binding to the promoter was responsible for the regional demethylation of CpG sites, and for the increased binding of transcription factors in HBV-positive cells.",

DNA methylation is a predominant mechanism employed to inactivate relevant genes during tumorigenesis associated with HCC. DNA methylation occurs at carbon 5 of cytosine, primarily in the context of the CpG dinucleotide. Recent findings support the hypothesis that hypomethylation of the DNA surrounding the proximal promoter region is a prerequisite for gene activation, whereas hypermethylation leads to gene silencing [24] . Mechanistically, there are a number of ways in which DNA methylation can repress transcription. For example, many of the trans factors known to bind to sequences containing CpG dinucleotides do not bind when the CpG doublets are methylated [25] . Identification of methylated regions in the COX-2 promoter during HBV infection will aid in understanding the mechanisms by which this gene is regulated.",

We also analyzed the mechanism of COX-2 upregulation in HBV-positive cells as well as in HBxtransfected cells. Our results showed that COX-2 expression was induced in both HBV-positive and HBx-expressing cells, and that activation of the COX-2 promoter by HBx depended on C/EBP and CREB binding sites, in which C/EBP\u03b2 played an important role. HBx directly interacted with C/EBP\u03b2, and enhanced its binding to the COX-2 promoter. DNA methylation analysis revealed that global hypomethylation of the COX-2 promoter and specific demethylation of the NF-AT binding sites occurred in HBV-positive cells. Among the three DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) present in mammalian cells, DNMT3B played a key role in COX-2 promoter methylation, and its decreased affinity for the promoter was responsible for the specific regional demethylation and the increased binding of transcription factors. Together, this study shows that both aberrant epigenetic modifications and transcription factors contribute to the HBV-induced COX-2 expression.",

To test if expression of HBV influences COX-2, Figure 1A ). The amount of COX-2 protein was next estimated by Western blot analysis, and endogenous COX-2 protein was increased in HepG2.2.15 cells ( Figure 1A) , suggesting that the presence of HBV regulates COX-2 expression. To test if the upregulation of COX-2 correlates with the expression of HBx, a reporter plasmid in which the COX-2 promoter was cloned upstream of the luciferase gene (pCOX-2-Luc) was transfected with pHBV-1.2 or pHBV-1.2*7 and the control plasmid pRL-TK into HepG2 human hepatoma cells, which support HBV replication. pHBV-1.2 contains 1.2-fold length of the HBV genome and retains the ability to produce mature HBV virions. pHBV-1.2*7 is an HBV mutant that does not express HBx. Luciferase activity was measured in each sample, and results showed that wild-type HBV activated COX-2 promoter whereas the HBV mutant failed to induce COX-2 promoter activation ( Figure 1B ). Since expression of luciferase in these cells could only come from activity at the COX-2 promoter in the reporter plasmid, it is likely that COX-2 expression is regulated by HBx at the level of transcription. We next transfected HepG2 cells with pCOX-2-Luc and increasing concentrations of the pCMV-HBx plasmid, and found that HBx stimulated the COX-2 promoter in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 1C ). To further confirm the effects of HBx on COX-2 expression, the pCMV-HBx plasmid was transiently transfected into HepG2 cells. qRT-PCR and western blot analysis showed elevated level of COX-2 mRNA and protein in HBx transfeted cells ( Figure 1D ). COX-2 is a key enzyme involved in prostaglandin synthesis, as it converts arachidonic acid to PGE2 and other prostanoids involved in inflammation and tumor development [10, 27] . Elevated COX-2 activity in HBV or HBx expressing cells was next monitored by measuring the accumulation of secreted PGE2 in culture supernatants from HepG2.2.15 cells, or from HepG2 cells transfected with pCMV-HBx. As shown in Figure  1E , the concentration of PGE2 was higher in HBVpositive or HBx-expressing cells as opposed to control cells. We next confirmed the specificity of COX-2 regulation for PGE2 secretion by treating the cells with NS-398, a selective inhibitor of COX-2. We found that treatment with NS-398 significantly reduced the amount of secreted PGE2 as compared to untreated cells, confirming the specific relationship between HBV-and HBx-induced COX-2 expression and PGE2 secretion ( Figure 1E ).",

These altered promoters were cloned upstream of the luciferase gene, and were transfected into HepG2 cells with pCMV-HBx. Deletion or mutation of the NF-B binding sites had little effect on the activation of the COX-2 promoter by HBx ( Figure 2A and 2B), which is consistent with prior studies [23] . A single mutation in the C/EBP, CRE, or double mutation in both, nearly abolished the activation of the COX-2 promoter by HBx ( Figure 2B ).

We next investigated the role of C/EBP\u03b2 in the activation of COX-2 by HBx. At least three isoforms of C/EBP\u03b2, LAP* (38 kDa), LAP (35 kDa), and LIP (20 kDa) are constitutively expressed in a variety of cell types. LAP and LAP* both contain a transactivation domain and a DNA binding domain, whereas LIP only contains a DNA binding domain [28] [29] [30] . HepG2 cells were cotransfected with pCOX-2-Luc, pCMV-HBx, and pCMV-LAP or pCMV-LIP. Luciferase activity in each sample was measured after 24 hours, and the expression of each cognate protein was confirmed by Western blot. A synergistic effect between HBx and LAP on the COX-2 promoter was observed ( Figure 2C ). As expected, LIP inhibited HBx-induced COX-2 promoter activation (Figure 2D) , likely due to the absence of a DNA-binding domain. These data indicate that HBx and C/EBP\u03b2 cooperatively activate COX-2 transcription.",

HepG2 cells were transfected with these plasmids, in addition to the control plasmid pRL-TK, and our results showed that luciferase expression in cells transfected with both pM-HBx and pVP16-LAP was much higher than in control cells ( Figure 3B ), confirming a direct interaction between HBx and C/EBP\u03b2.",

Co-transfection of DNMT expression plasmids with pCOX-2-Luc revealed that DNMT3B decreased COX-2 promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner, whereas DNMT3A increased in activity ( Figure 5C ). We next investigated the recruitment of these three DNMTs to the COX-2 promoter by ChIP assay. Chromatin fragments were prepared from HepG2 and HepG2.2.15 cells and were immunoprecipitated with antibodies specific for DNMT1, DNMT3A, or DNMT3B. The COX-2 promoter was then amplified by PCR, and we found that DNMT3B binding to the COX-2 promoter was reduced in HBV-expressing HepG2.2.15 cells, whereas that of DNMT3A and DNMT1 was increased ( Figure 5D ). Same results were shown in pHBV-1.2 transfected HepG2 cells ( Figure 5D ). A prior study has shown diminished expression of DNMT3B and increased expression of DNMT1 and 3A in HBxexpressing cells [38] . So the different DNA binding affinities may due to different expressions of DNMTs. These findings, combined with previous results that the COX-2 promoter is demethylated in HBV-expressing cells, suggest that DNMT3B but not DNMT1 or DNMT3A plays a key role in COX-2 promoter methylation, and that the decreased activity of DNMT3B in the nucleus is likely responsible for hypomethylation of the COX-2 promoter.",

We demonstrated a previously unrecognized mechanism of COX-2 regulation, where demethylation-linked recruitment of multiple transcription factors to the COX-2 promoter activated HBV-induced COX-2 expression. Demethylation of CpG dinucleotides within the NF-AT binding sites in the COX-2 promoter resulted in the increased binding affinity of NF-AT to the cognate sites in the promoter, followed by increased COX-2 expression and PGE2 accumulation. The association of HBx with C/EBP\u03b2 also contributed to the induction of COX-2. Likewise, DNMT3B played a key role in the methylation of the COX-2 promoter, as the reduced binding between DNMT3B and the COX-2 promoter was responsible for the regional demethylation of the CpG sites, and for the increased binding of transcription factors in HBV-positive cells.",

However, the molecular details of COX-2 activation during chronic HBV infection remain to be defined.",

We found that the effects of different isoforms of C/EBP\u03b2 played diverse roles in this process. LAP (transcription activator) and HBx had a synergistic effect on COX-2 promoter activation, whereas LIP (transcription repressor) led to a decrease in HBxinduced COX-2 expression. These data suggest that C/ EBP\u03b2, cooperatively with HBx, activates COX-2 transcription through the transactivation domain of C/EBP\u03b2. Likewise, bZip transcription factors, such as CREB and C/EBP, were reported to interact with HBx and target a variety of promoters [31, 40, 41] . We detected a direct interaction between HBx and C/EBP\u03b2, which may contribute to the reinforcement of C/EBP\u03b2 binding to the COX-2 promoter, and the subsequent upregulation of COX-2 expression.",

Likewise, other studies have shown that DNA methylation of certain promoters is associated with HBV infection [32] . Since many of the trans factors known to bind to sequences containing CpG dinucleotides do not bind when such regions are methylated, we looked for relationships between transcription factor binding and aberrant epigenetic modifications in the COX-2 promoter during HBV infection. Bisulfite sequencing analysis of the CpG island in the promoter (nucleotides -204 to +57) revealed the hypomethylation of the COX-2 promoter in HBV-expressing cells. More importantly, demethylation of two NF-AT motifs, which contained CpG sites, was detected in these cells, and EMSA data indicated a higher affinity of NF-AT for the demethylated motif of the COX-2 promoter. As a previous report found that HBx activates the COX-2 promoter in an NF-AT dependent manner [23] , our results describe a possible mechanism for the role of NF-AT in this process. Considering the complex interactions of HBx, C/EBP\u03b2 and NF-AT, demethylation of NF-AT sites might lead to the binding of different trans factors. These results suggest a potential mechanism for the C/EBP\u03b2-and NF-AT-dependent COX-2 activation by HBV and HBx. DNMT1 is activated by the Ras-AP-1 signaling pathway [46] , Hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes are mediated by DNMT3A or DNMT3B, and diminished expression of DNMT3B was detected in HBx-expressing liver cell lines, resulting in genomic hypomethylation [38] . We investigated the role of these three DNMTs in the epigenetic modifications of the COX-2 promoter. We found that DNMT3B but not DNMT1 or DNMT3A was critical for methylation of the COX-2 promoter, and ChIP assays showed that the binding of DNMT3B to the COX-2 promoter was decreased in HBV-expressing cells. A recent study demonstrated the interaction of HBx with DNMT3A and unraveled a possible mechanism involved in HBxmediated epigenetic modifications and gene regulation [47] . In our study, we investigated the role of three DNMTs (DNMT1, DNMT3A, DNM3B) in the epigenetic modifications of the COX-2 promoter through overexpression and siRNA technology. Considering both the binding of DNMT3B and the total DNMTs activities in the nucleus of HBV-expressing cells were decreased, our results indicate that DNMT3B but not DNMT1 or DNMT3A plays a major role in COX-2 promoter methylation. The increased binding of DNMT1 and DNMT3A to COX-2 promoter in HBV-expressing cells indicates the complex situation in HBV-mediated epigenetic modifications and gene regulation. It is possible that DNMT3A may play a minor role in controlling COX-2 expression through another mechanism. Other researches have showed the importance of mitochondrial pathway in HBx-induced COX-2 expression [48] .",

In normal cells, the COX-2 promoter is hypermethylated and transcription repressors, such as DNMT3B, bind to the methylated CpG sites and repress its activity. After HBV infection, the expression of the virus and HBx trigger demethylation of the COX-2 promoter by down-regulating DNMT3B, which is responsible for the methylation of the promoter. Methylation relieves repression of the promoter and transcription factors such as NF-AT and C/EBP\u03b2 are able to bind. Interactions between HBx and C/EBP\u03b2, NF-AT enhance the recruitment of the complex to the COX-2 promoter, the transcription machinery is assembled, and the COX-2 gene is expressed. Such a mechanism provides deeper insights into the molecular mechanism of HBV-induced COX-2 expression.",

Construction of the luciferase reporter vector (pGL3) containing a COX-2 promoter region (nucleotides -891 to +9), its truncated or site-specific mutants, Flag-tagged Human C/EBP\u03b2 LAP, and C/EBP\u03b2 LIP were reported previously [50] . The HBx gene was amplified by PCR from HepG2.2.15 cells, which contain the HBV genome. The HBx amplicon was cloned into pCMV-Tag2A using EcoRI and XhoI and into eGFP-C1 using XhoI and XbaI. HBx and C/EBP\u03b2-LAP were cloned into the mammalian two-hybrid assay plasmids pM (GAL4 DNA-binding domain) and/or pVP16 (VP16 activation domain) (Promega) between the EcoRI and XbaI sites.
