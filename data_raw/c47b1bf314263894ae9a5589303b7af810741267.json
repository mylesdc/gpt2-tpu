The spread in Europe was however slower than expected [4] . In Sweden, the first sporadic cases were diagnosed in May 2009 and not until October, after a smaller peak in July and August, the reported cases increased to peak in November 2009 [5] . Sweden was one of the countries that adopted countrywide vaccination against H1N1 reaching a coverage of approximately 60% of the population, with the first doses distributed in the middle of October 2009, and vaccination may have contributed to the rapid decline in reported cases in December [6] .",

Viral interference refers to that infections with one virus affect the spread of other viruses reflecting either an epidemiological or a biological interaction, which in turn could be due to a cellular or immunological mechanism [7, 12, 13] .

The samples were extracted with MagAttract Virus Mini M48 kit (Qiagen) in a BioRobot M48 instrument and analyzed by an in-house real-time PCR with a virus panel including the following 16 viruses: influenza A seasonal (FluA) as well as influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (H1N1), influenza B (FluB), human adenovirus (HAdV), human rhinovirus (HRV), parainfluenzavirus 1-3 (PIV1-3), human bocavirus (HBoV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human enterovirus (HEV) and coronavirus serotypes 229E, HKU1, NL63 and OC43 (HCoV) as previously described [15] . The PCR was mainly based on separate single PCRs, however duplex PCR was used for PIV1 and PIV3 and for PIV2 and HCoV-229E. The assay was limited at distinguishing HRV-RNA from HEV-RNA due to cross-reactivity [15]. Detection of both HEV and HRV was determined as only HRV positive if the cycle threshold value (Ct-value) for HRV was at least 5 cycles lower than for HEV. If HEV and HRV were found at equally high reactivity (DCt-values ,5), the infection was clinically determined as HRV when the predominant symptoms were respiratory tract infection and as only HEV when the predominant symptoms were fever and malaise with clinical suspicion of encephalitis or if HEV was also detected in stool or cerebrospinal fluid. If only a smaller virus panel including H1N1, FluA, FluB and RSV was initially performed, the analyses were complemented for the other viruses. Respiratory samples as well as extracted DNA were stored at 270uC.",

Detection of additional viruses in H1N1positive children were, as opposed to previous findings [11, 20] , not associated with the severity of disease. One explanation could be the low rate of RSV infections in our material since the study period included only the beginning of the RSV season and hence none of the H1N1-positive children were co-infected with RSV. In South America the two epidemics of H1N1 and RSV coincided with a reported high morbidity and a high frequency of severe disease [20] .

As opposed to previous reports of low prevalence of H1N1 (or even reduction of H1N1) when HRV was prevalent [7] [8] [9] , our data indicated co-circulation of the two viruses and 6.0% of the children with H1N1 were also positive for HRV. Our observation is in line with a recent report from Beijing [24] . The high detection of HRV during the study period might reflect seasonality of HRV disease, but could also be an effect of increased sampling due to the fear of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 during the pandemic. Indeed, the frequency of HRV-detection seems to closely follow the sampling frequency in children at our hospital throughout the year (unpublished data).",

However, these estimates do not take into account the incidence in the catchment population nor the hospitalization rate of the children infected by the respective viruses.",

Moreover the biological mechanism in viral interference needs to be better understood. ",
