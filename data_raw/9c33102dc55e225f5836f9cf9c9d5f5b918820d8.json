            "text": "The early systemic production of interferon (IFN)-ab is an essential component of the antiviral host defense mechanisms, but is also thought to contribute to the toxic side effects accompanying gene therapy with adenoviral vectors. Here we investigated the IFN-ab response to human adenoviruses (Ads) in mice. By comparing the responses of normal, myeloid (m)DC-and plasmacytoid (p)DC-depleted mice and by measuring IFN-ab mRNA expression in different organs and cells types, we show that in vivo, Ads elicit strong and rapid IFN-ab production, almost exclusively in splenic mDCs. Using knockout mice, various strains of Ads (wild type, mutant and UV-inactivated) and MAP kinase inhibitors, we demonstrate that the Ad-induced IFN-ab response does not require Toll-like receptors (TLR), known cytosolic sensors of RNA (RIG-I/MDA-5) and DNA (DAI) recognition and interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-3, but is dependent on viral endosomal escape, signaling via the MAP kinase SAPK/JNK and IRF-7. Furthermore, we show that Ads induce IFN-ab and IL-6 in vivo by distinct pathways and confirm that IFN-ab positively regulates the IL-6 response. Finally, by measuring TNF-a responses to LPS in Ad-infected wild type and IFN-abR 2/2 mice, we show that IFN-ab is the key mediator of Ad-induced hypersensitivity to LPS. These findings indicate that, like endosomal TLR signaling in pDCs, TLR-independent virus recognition in splenic mDCs can also produce a robust early IFN-ab response, which is responsible for the bulk of IFN-ab production induced by adenovirus in vivo. The signaling requirements are different from known TLR-dependent or cytosolic IFN-ab induction mechanisms and suggest a novel cytosolic viral induction pathway. The hypersensitivity to components of the microbial flora and invading pathogens may in part explain the toxic side effects of adenoviral gene therapy and contribute to the pathogenesis of adenoviral disease.",

Human Ads enter mouse cells and express their early genes; however, the virus genome is not replicated and no viral progeny is made during the infection of mouse cells in vitro or in vivo [3, 4] . Furthermore, early viral gene expression can be abolished by UV-inactivation and well-defined mutants with defects of viral early genes or viral entry are available [3, 5] .

The extracytoplasmic induction is initiated by triggering the surfaceexpressed transmembrane protein toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 with certain non-nucleic viral constituents [16, 17, 18] or upon recognition of viral nucleic acids in the endosomes of specialized cells (dendritic cells and macrophages) via different members of the TLR family. These include TLR3, TLR7/TLR8 and TLR9, sensing dsRNA, ssRNA and CpG DNA, respectively. For IFN-ab induction TLR3 and TLR4 signal through the adaptor molecule TIR domain-containing adaptor protein inducing interferon b (TRIF). This results in the activation of interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-3. TLR7, 8 and 9 signal through the adaptor molecule Myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88). An important result of the MyD88-mediated pathway is the activation of IRF-7 (but not of IRF-3), which together with the transcription factors NF-kB and AP-1 initiates the induction of both the IFN-a and IFN-b genes [13, 15] . This induction pathway is responsible for the strong, early IFN-ab response to several replicating and inactivated viruses in pDCs, which express preferentially TLR7 and TLR9 [19, 20, 21] .",

Signal transduction leading to type I IFN gene induction is initiated by the recognition of intracellular virus-associated molecular patterns. dsRNA and 59-triphosphate RNA produced during viral replication are sensed by the RNA helicases RIG-I and MDA-5 [23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28] . This pathway has been extensively studied, mainly in virus-infected fibroblasts. Triggering of the aforementioned RNA helicases leads to the activation of the transcription factors NF-kB, IRF-3 and IRF-7 that are important for the induction of IFN-ab and proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-6. In the cytosolic pathway, type I IFN gene induction is a sequential event and both IRF-3 and IRF-7 were shown to be important in the early phase when mostly IFN-b is produced. The late phase of the IFN-ab response is regulated by positive feedback via the increased levels of IRF-7 elicited by IFN-b production during the early phase [29, 30, 31] . In addition to fibroblasts, the potential of mDCs and macrophages to produce significant amounts of type I IFNs in response to viral replication has been demonstrated in vitro [32, 33] ; however, in vivo the specific contribution of these cells to systemic levels of IFN-ab is not well documented.",

It was claimed that a part of the IFN-ab response is initiated by TLR9 and MyD88 signaling in pDCs and another part by cytosolic DNA recognition in non-pDCs. However, the identification of IFN-ab producing cell types directly in infected mice was not carried out. In the present study we investigated the IFN-ab responses of Ad-infected mice and showed that the bulk of the in vivo induced IFN-ab is produced by splenic mDCs. Furthermore, we found that TLRs, including TLR9 play no major role. The Ad-elicited IFN-ab response required viral endosomal escape, suggesting a cytosolic induction pathway. Surprisingly however, the induction was independent of IRF-3 and dependent on stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK) activity, which is in contrast to the known induction mechanism initiated through cytosolic DNA recognition. Instead, the induction required IRF-7, and a positive feedback regulation via the type I IFN receptor. Although this does not exclude a role for cytosolic nucleic acid sensors, our data do not support the involvement of MDA-5, RIG-I and Zbp1/DAI in the induction of the IFN-ab response to Ad. Furthermore, our results reveal distinct mechanisms in the induction of IFN-ab and IL-6 by Ad. Finally, we show that Ad-induced IFN-ab is a key mediator of hypersensitivity to bacterial lipopolysaccharides in infected mice. Enhanced susceptibility to LPS and to other microbial inducers of inflammation may contribute to toxic reactions observed during adenoviral gene therapy and to the clinical symptoms of adenoviral diseases.",

The results summarized in Fig. 1A and supplementary Fig. S1A show that all mice infected with either of the two viruses exhibited similar IFN-ab responses. IFN-ab was first detectable in plasma at 4 h, peaking at 8 h and declining to low levels 18 h after infection. We then investigated, whether the expression of viral genes is required and/or regulate the induction of IFN-ab by Ads. To this end, we injected mice with an UV-inactivated Ad3 (Fig. S1B ) or Ad R700, incapable of viral gene expression, or with a recombinant Ad5 (species C) that contains a deletion of the E1 and E3 Ad early regions and expresses GFP (Ad5-GFP) (Fig. S1C ). As shown in Fig. 1A , UV-inactivated Ads also induced a strong IFN-ab response which, however, peaked at 6 h after injection, i.e. 2 h earlier than the response to intact Ads. A similar early-peaking IFN-ab response was obtained in mice injected with UV inactivated Ad R700 (Fig. S2A ) and with the recombinant Ad5-GFP (Fig. S2B ).",

            "text": "Adenoviruses (Ads) are important pathogens and promising vectors for gene therapy applications. In the course of adenoviral infections innate immune responses are activated, which can be beneficial for the antiviral host defense but also detrimental if activated in a deregulated manner. Type I IFNs are crucial for the innate immune control of various viral infections in the mammalian host. So far, the early, systemic release of IFN-ab during viral infections has been attributed to specialized immune cells, the plasmacytoid dendritic cells. Here, in a mouse infection model, we show that wild type Ads, as well as adenoviral vectors, elicit rapid IFN-ab production almost exclusively in another cell population, the splenic myeloid dendritic cells. This IFN-ab storm depends on viral escape from endosomes to the cytosol and the requirements of the response are suggestive of a novel viral induction pathway. Furthermore, we show that virus induced IFN-ab is the key mediator of Ad-induced hypersensitivity to the cytokine-inducing and toxic activity of lipopolysaccharide, a common constituent of Gram-negative bacteria. Since these bacteria comprise several commensals and pathogens, enhanced susceptibility to lipopolysaccharide may contribute to toxic reactions observed during adenoviral gene therapy and to the clinical symptoms of adenoviral diseases. Titration of the viral preparations in mice revealed that a positive correlation between the viral dose and the height of the IFN-ab response existed only when relatively small doses of intact Ads were used. Higher doses of the Ads either did not elicit a further increase of the IFN-ab response (Ad3, Fig. 1B ) or led to a decrease of the response (Ad R700, Fig. S2C ). In contrast, injection of the corresponding UV-inactivated Ads always led to a gradual increase of the IFN-ab response and, at higher viral concentrations, even exceeded the response obtained with intact viruses. Thus, the expression of Ad genes is not required for the induction of IFN-ab in mice. The data also indicate that the expression of early adenoviral genes negatively regulates type I IFN production. Notably, the Ad E1A gene has been shown previously to suppress Newcastle Disease Virus and IRF-3 induced IFN-a4 promoter induction in transient expression assays in fibroblasts [43] .",

Here we stimulated different primary mouse cells, including bone marrow derived mDCs (BMDC), bone marrow derived macrophages (BMM), bone marrow derived pDCs and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), with Ad2 (species C) or Ad3 (species B). Six hours later, the IFN-ab content of culture supernatants and the expression of the viral E1A gene in the cells were determined. BMDC and BMM, but not MEFs, produced IFN-ab (Fig. 1D ), although all cell types were successfully infected as shown by RT-PCR ( Fig. 1E and not shown). Very similar results were obtained when, instead of Ad2, Ad3 or the recombinant Ad5-GFP were used for infection of the three cell types (not shown). In addition, pDCs also produced IFN-ab in response to Ad infection in vitro (Fig. S3A) ; however, only at high multiplicities of infection. Finally, like MEFs, L-929 cells infected with Ad2 produced no IFNab either (Fig. S3B ). In agreement with previous studies [36, 37] , MEFs and L-929 cells produced IFN-ab following transfection with purified DNA (Fig. 1D and Fig. S10C ). In addition to mouse DCs and macrophages we also found that human monocyte-derived DCs produced IFN-ab upon infection with the adenoviral vector Ad5-GFP (Fig. S3C) . The present data confirm that Ads can trigger IFN-ab production in various immune cells in vitro [10, 45, 46] . However, it furthermore indicates that production does not proceed ubiquitously in all types of infected cells.",

Expression of IFN-a and IFN-b mRNA was below the level of detection in the organs of non-infected controls. We also found that between 4 and 18 h after infection IFN-a and IFN-b mRNAs were expressed at high levels in the spleen (Fig. 1F ), but surprisingly not in the liver, despite the presence of Ad in both organs.

Both CD11c + and CD11c 2 populations contained viral DNA (not shown). This finding is in accordance with the report of Morelli et al describing that both splenic DC and non-DC contain the virus in Ad-infected mice [49] . However, quantitative RT-PCR determination of IFN-a and IFN-b mRNA in both populations revealed the presence of IFNab mRNAs predominantly in the DC-containing CD11c + fraction ( Fig. 2A, B ), but not in the macrophage containing CD11c 2 fraction. In contrast to IFN-a and IFN-b, the mRNA levels of IL-6, another cytokine known to be induced by Ad, were comparably upregulated in both the CD11c + and CD11c 2 population (Fig. 2C ). Since the latter non-DC population comprises more than 95% of all mouse splenocytes [50] , we conclude that most of the IL-6 made in the Ad-infected spleen is of non-DC origin.",

We therefore further separated the purified CD11c + cells into mDCs (CD11c + CD11b + Gr1 2 ), pDCs (CD11c + CD11b 2 GR1 + B220 + ) and a CD11c + CD11b-F4/80 + subpopulation ( Fig. S4A -D) and measured the expression of IFN-a, IFN-b and b-actin with real-time RT-PCR. After normalization to b-actin expression, we found that on a per cell basis mDCs expressed significantly more IFN-b than pDCs (Fig. 2D ), but both mDCs and pDCs expressed similar amounts of IFN-a (Fig. 2E ). In contrast, CD11c + , CD11b 2 cells carrying the macrophage marker F4/80 + did not express detectable amounts of IFN-a or IFN-b. Since mDCs comprise approximately 60% of all analyzed CD11c + splenocytes and their numbers are approximately 10-times higher than those of pDCs (Fig. S5A , B and [50] ), these results suggested that the vast majority of IFN-ab in Ad-infected mice was produced by splenic mDCs. To verify this assumption, we analyzed the Ad-elicited cytokine responses in mice depleted of CD11c high MHC II + myeloid DCs. To ablate these cells, we injected diphtheria toxin into the CD11c-diphtheria toxin receptor CD11cDTR/GFP transgenic mice [54] 24 h prior to infection with Ad. In agreement with previous reports [55, 56] , DT pre-treatment of DTR/GFP transgenic mice resulted in the ablation of CD11c high MHC II + CD11b + splenic mDCs, whereas the CD11c int Siglec H + CD11b 2 plasmacytoid DCs remained unaffected (Fig. S5A, B) . When DT pre-treated CD11cDTR/GFP transgenic mice were challenged with Ad3 and examined for IFN-ab in plasma 4 and 8 h after infection, only marginal IFN responses were found at both timepoints, in contrast to the strong responses of similarly infected transgenic control mice that had not received DT (Fig. 3A) . The same pretreatment with DT had no effect on the Ad elicited IFN-ab response of wild-type mice (Fig. 3A) .",

The fact that different cell types are responsible for IFN-ab and IL-6 response to Ad may explain at least in part why viral gene expression did not inhibit the production of IL-6 in Ad3-or Ad R700-infected mice (see Fig. 1C and Fig. S2D ). In order to functionally evaluate the possible participation of pDCs to the systemic production of IFNab to Ad we also checked this response in mice depleted of pDCs. As shown in Fig. S6A and B, the injection of anti PDCA-1 antibody led to the substantial decrease of the number of splenic pDCs. Nevertheless, the production of IFN-ab was not changed in response to Ad infection (Fig. 3C) . The data collectively show that the vast majority of IFN-ab but not of IL-6 in Ad infected-mice is produced by splenic mDCs.",

Signaling via TLR9 was shown to be responsible for the strong type I IFN response of pDCs to Ad in vitro [10, 45, 46 ]. Here we investigated the possible involvement of TLR9 in the induction of type I IFNs by measuring IFN-ab in Ad infected wt and TLR9 2/2 mice. Fig. 4A shows that TLR9 2/2 mice produced normal levels of IFN-ab. upon infection with Ad3. Comparable results were obtained with the recombinant Ad5-GFP (Fig. S7A) . Moreover, Unc93B mice, deficient in signalling by intracellular TLRs showed normal IFN-ab responses to Ad5-GFP (Fig. S7A ). We further checked the possible involvement of the TLR system using mice deficient for TLR2, TLR4 or for the TLR adaptor proteins TRIF and MyD88. Fig. 4A shows that the Ad3 induced IFN-ab levels in all strains of mice were as high as in the respective wt controls. Similarly, comparable IFN-ab responses were also found in TLR-, MyD88-or TRIFdeficient mice and in the corresponding wt animals after infection with UV-inactivated Ad3, AdR700 and Ad5-GFP (not shown). Furthermore, comparable IFN-ab responses were found in cultures of Ad-infected BMDCs from wt, MyD88-and TRIFdeficient mice (Fig. 4B ). The various TLR deficient mice showed impaired responses to the corresponding ligands in control experiments (Fig. S7B ). Collectively, our data show that the TLR system plays no major role in the systemic IFN-ab responses to Ads in mice.",

Here, we studied the possible involvement of IFN feedback signaling in the IFN-ab and IL-6 response to Ad3 by using wt and IFN-abR-deficient mice. The absence of the IFN-ab receptor resulted in dramatically decreased levels of IFN-a and IFN-b protein in the plasma as well as of IFN-a and IFN-b mRNAs in the spleen (Fig. 5A , B) 4 and 8 h after Ad infection. The difference between the protein or mRNA levels of IFN-a and IFN-b in wt versus mutant animals was approximately 100 and 20fold, respectively. Furthermore, in contrast to wt mice, the characteristic rise in IFN-ab levels between 4 and 8 h after infection was absent in IFN-abR 2/2 mice. Thus, in Ad-infected mice, production of both IFN-a and IFN-b is strictly dependent on positive IFN-ab feedback. The determination of IL-6 protein and mRNA levels in the same plasma and splenic tissue samples revealed that the induction of IL-6 is also positively regulated by IFN-ab signaling (Fig. 5C ), which is in agreement with a previous study [10] .",

As with the in vivo results, we found that cells from IFN-abR 2/2 mice infected with Ad3 produced significantly less type I IFN than similarly infected cells from wt mice (Fig. S8 ). The loss of IFN-ab signaling also resulted in a strong inhibition of the Ad induced IL-6 production in BMDCs (Fig. 5D ) and BMMs (Fig. 5E ). Furthermore, as shown using Ad-infected BMMs, it resulted also in a strong reduction of inducibility of IL-6 mRNA expression (Fig. 5F ). Because transcriptional changes are often determined by epigenetic factors [62] we checked the levels of hyperacetylated histone H4 (acH4), a permissive factor for transcription at the IL-6 promoter in control and Ad-infected BMMs from wt and IFNabR 2/2 mice. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays showed a significant enrichment of acH4 at the IL-6 promoter in infected wt, but not IFNabR 2/2 BMMs (Fig. 5G) . In a control experiment, as expected, an enrichment of acH4 was observed at the promoter of the constitutively active Topoisomerase 3b but not of the l5 (not expressing, active only in early B-cells) gene in both cells types. From these results we conclude that IFN-ab exerts a positive regulatory effect on the Ad-induced IL-6 transcription and that its loss is at least partly responsible for the strong reduction of the IL-6 response in Ad-infected IFN-abR knockout mice.",

In wt mice and cells IFN-a5 and IFN-b were the most strongly expressed genes and IFN-a13 was the least activated IFNa subtype. IFN-a11 was not induced at all. IFNabR deficiency resulted in an inhibition of IFN-ab gene expression, the strength of which was subtype dependent. In some cases the inhibition was weak (IFN-a2, 4, 5 and IFN-b), in others strong or complete (IFN-a12, 13, and 14) , showing that the expression of different subtypes of IFN-ab are differentially affected by IFN-ab feedback signaling.

We show here that IRF-3 is critical for the induction of IFN-ab by isolated adenoviral DNA, but not by infection with whole virions in BMDCs (Fig. 7A ). In order to analyze the individual contribution of IRF-3 and IRF-7 to the Ad-induced IFN-ab response in vivo, we infected mice deficient for these transcription factors with Ad3. We also compared these responses to those triggered by poly I:C, a known activator of the cytosolic IFN-ab producing pathway in vivo. As shown in Fig. 7B , the lack of IRF-3 did not significantly influence the plasma levels of IFNab 4 or 8 h after infection in response to Ad. In contrast, Ad-infected IRF-7deficient mice did not exhibit detectable amounts of IFN-ab in the plasma. Very similar data were obtained with Ad5GFP (Fig. S9) . Thus, IRF-7, but not IRF-3, is essential for the induction of the IFN-ab response during Ad infection. Compared to wt mice, poly I:C injected IRF-7 deficient mice produced significantly less, but still well detectable amounts of IFN-ab.",

The possible involvement of MDA-5 was tested using BMDCs and BMMs from MDA-5 deficient mice. Normal IFN-ab responses to Ad were obtained in MDA-5-deficient BMDCs cells (Fig. 8A ) and also in BMMs (not shown), whereas the responses to the known MDA-5 ligand Poly I:C were abrogated (Fig. 8A) . The possible involvement of RIG-I was checked using a dominant negative form of RIG-I (RIG-IC) [64] . BMDCs from IRF-3 2/2 mice were transfected with a GFP-expressing plasmid (transfection control) with or without RIG-IC and subsequently stimulated with Ad or control leader RNA. We used IRF-3 2/2 cells to avoid any induction of IFN-ab by the plasmid itself, which is, contrary to that by Ad, strictly IRF-3 dependent. The induction of IFN-b mRNA was analyzed in sorted GFP-positive cells. As shown in Fig. 8B , left, the transfection of RIG-IC prevented induction of IFN-b mRNA by the leader RNA, but not by Ad. The role of Zbp1/DAI was analyzed using siRNA-mediated knockdown of DAI/Zbp1 in BMDCs. For this purpose, cells from IRF-32/2 mice were co-transfected with DAI/Zbp1 targeting siRNAs and a GFP expressing plasmid and subsequently stimulated with Ad. As shown in Fig. 8B , right, the transfection of BMDCs resulted in strongly reduced DAI/Zbp1 expression but not in a reduced IFNb mRNA induction by Ad in GFP-positive cells. Control experiments with L-929 cells showed that transfection of the gene-specific siRNA downregulated the expression of DAI/Zbp1 on both the mRNA and protein levels and efficiently inhibited the IFN-b response to B-DNA ( Fig. S10A-C) . Collectively, our results indicate that known nucleic acid sensors such as MDA-5, RIG-I and Zbp1/DAI are not involved in the Ad-induced type I IFN production.",

We infected BMDCs with Ad3 in the presence or absence of MAPK inhibitors and determined the levels of IFN-ab and IL-6 produced. Fig. 9A and Fig. S11 show that the pharmacological blockade of the SAPK/JNK MAPK almost completely inhibited the Ad3-induced production of both IFN-ab and IL-6. In contrast, the inhibition of the p38 MAPK pathway partially inhibited the production of IL-6, but had no effect on the production of IFN-ab. Finally, the blockade of ERK1/2 had no effect on the production of either IL-6 or IFN-ab. Very similar data on the effects of MAPK inhibitors were obtained using Ad2 and mutant Ad5-GFP to stimulate BMDC (data not shown).",

We tested the IFN-ab stimulating activity of these preparations in vivo and observed that they were not active (Fig. S12A ). Since empty capsids lack viral DNA and exhibit an altered protein composition [69] , the absence of an inducing viral constituent(s) from these capsids could explain their inability to provoke an IFN-ab response. Another possible explanation could be that endosomal escape is required for IFNab induction, since empty capsids cannot escape from the endosome [69] . To test the latter possibility, we infected mice with 3.6610 10 viral particles of wt Ad2 and Ad2Ts1, a viral mutant deficient in endosomal escape [5] . As shown in Fig. 10A , in contrast to the wt virus, Ad2Ts1 did not induce detectable levels of type I IFN at 4 and 8 h after infection. Furthermore, the IL-6 response was also severely reduced in these animals (Fig. S12B) . In a control experiment, mice infected with Ad2Ts1 grown at permissive temperature (32uC) and thus capable of endosomal escape, exhibited normal IFN-ab responses (Fig. 10B) . The inability of Ad2Ts1 to escape from endosomes of mDCs was confirmed by electron microscopy (Fig. 10E-H) and in vivo by the lack of Ad early E1A gene expression in the spleen of mice infected with Ad2Ts1 (Fig. 10I) . Thus, escape from the endosome is critical for the induction of IFN-ab and IL-6 by adenoviruses.",

            "text": "It should be noted that a further increase in the Ad2Ts1 dose (2.16610 11 particles) resulted in detectable, albeit very low levels of plasma IFN-ab that were released with different kinetics (Fig. 10C) . In this case, IFN-ab was detectable as early as 2 h after infection and, in contrast to the results we obtained with wt viruses ( Figures 1A, 10A and S1A), the levels of IFN-ab did not increase significantly at the later time-points. This already suggests a mechanism for type I IFN induction by Ad2Ts1 that is fundamentally different from the IFN-ab induction seen with wt Ad2. Since Ads are DNA viruses, they can possibly be detected by TLR9. In fact, the innate immune recognition of Ad in pDCs is TLR9 dependent. We therefore repeated the experiment with a high dose of Ad2Ts1 using TLR9 2/2 mice. As shown in Fig. 10C , TLR9 2/2 mice did not produce IFN-ab in response to the mutant Ad2Ts1, quite in contrast to the results obtained with the wt virus (see Fig. 4A ) Likewise, there was no detectable IFN-ab release in Ad2Ts1-infected mice deficient in MyD88, an essential component of TLR9 signaling (not shown). Furthermore, the corresponding amount of empty particles (DNA-free) of Ad2Ts1 elicited no IFN-ab response in wt mice (Fig. 10C) . These data illustrate the critical role of TLR9 in the induction of IFN-ab by means of high doses of Ad2Ts1. To exclude the possibility that contaminating DNA on the surface of the virions was responsible for the TLR9dependent IFN-ab induction, we treated the mutant virions with bensonase, which destroys all kinds of free nucleic acids. Bensonase-treated Ad2Ts1 still induced an IFN-ab response in We also tested the role of endosomal escape of Ad in the in vitro induction in BMDCs of IFN-ab and IL-6. Fig. 10D shows a dose dependent production of IFN-ab by Ad2Ts1 grown at permissive temperature and Figures S12C and D the production of IFN-ab and IL-6 by wt Ad2, but no production of either of the cytokines by Ad2Ts1 grown at the restrictive temperature. Interestingly, liposomal transfection of whole Ad2 Ts1 virions (but not of empty virus particles) in BMDCs resulted in the significant production of IFN-ab that however, was critically dependent on IRF-3 (Fig. 7A) . Similarly, Ad2 Ts1 did not induce IFN-ab production in human monocyte derived DCs (Fig. S12E) . The requirement of low pH for Ad3 infection was also tested using bafilomycin A1, a drug known to inhibit the acidification of endosomes. Experiments shown in Fig. S13A , B revealed that cells treated with this drug produced significantly reduced levels of IFN-ab and IL-6 respectively, in response to Ad3. This is consistent with the notion that Ad3 and Ad7 infection of cultured cells requires low endosomal pH [70, 71] . Similar results were obtained using treatment with ammonium chloride, another acidification inhibitor known to block Ad escape from endosomes (not shown). Collectively, the data in vitro and in vivo provide evidence that the late phase of the Ad infectious entry, in which the virus escapes from the endosome, triggers an innate response characterized by the production of type I IFNs and IL-6.",

For this purpose, we infected wt and IFNabR 2/2 mice with Ads, challenged them 16 h later with LPS and measured the TNF-a response. Non-infected LPS-treated mice served as a control. Unlike the infected wt mice, the Ad3-infected IFNabR 2/2 mice did not exhibit enhanced responses to LPS (Fig. 11A) . Interestingly, LPS hypersensitivity developed also in mice injected with very small amounts of Ad. Such amounts were capable of the elicitation of IFN-b mRNA in the spleen of infected animals, but incapable of inducing detectable circulating IFN-ab ( Fig. S14A and  B) . Similar results were obtained in Ad5-GFP-infected mice (not shown). Furthermore, in IRF-7 2/2 mice that exhibit a severe impairment of the IFN-ab response to Ad a severe impairment of LPS sensitization by Ad5-GFP was also observed. (Fig. 11B) . In contrast, sensitization to LPS developed normally in Ad5-GFPinfected TLR9 2/2 mice (Fig. 11B) , which is in agreement with our finding that TLR9 is not critical for the induction of IFN-ab by Ad. Furthermore, only Ad5-GFP-infected wt, but not IFNabR 2/2 mice exhibited enhanced susceptibility to LPS shock (Fig. 11C) . Notably, also Ad vector-infected or IFN-a treated human monocyte-derived mDCs exhibited enhanced sensitivity to LPS and overproduced TNF-a upon LPS challenge (Fig. S14C) . On the whole, our results indicate that IFN-ab is an essential mediator of the LPS hypersensitivity induced by adenovirus infection.",

We found that splenic macrophages from Ad infected mice overexpress mCD14 in an IFN-ab dependent manner (Fig. 11D ) but the expression of TLR4/MD-2 was only minimally affected (Fig. S14D) . Furthermore, we found increased acetylation levels of histone H4 at the TNF-a promoter in Ad-infected wt, but not in IFNabR-deficient macrophages (Fig. 11E ). This suggests that Adinduced IFN-ab increases LPS-induced TNF-a production, at least in part by epigenetic changes at the TNF-a promoter.",

We showed that the response is characterized by high levels of IFN-a and IFN-b, which are produced simultaneously and almost exclusively by splenic mDCs. Furthermore, the response is entirely independent of viral replication, TLR-, MyD88-, TRIF-and IRF-3-signaling, but dependent on viral escape from the endosomes, activation of the SAPK/JNK pathway and IRF-7, and subsequent IFN-ab feedback signaling. These data suggest an IFN-ab induction pathway that is different from the extracytoplasmic and cytoplasmic pathways so far described. Finally, we show that IFN-ab is a key mediator of the hypersensitivity to bacterial lipopolysaccharide, which develops, in Ad-infected mice.",

The present finding that in vivo, in Ad-infected mice, splenic mDCs are the major source of IFN-ab is surprising, since in mice infected with different viruses (MCMV, HSV, VSV, MHV, influenza, vaccinia and Sendai viruses) [27, 57, 58, 59, 75, 76, 77, 78] pDCs activated by the TLRs constitute the major contributors to the systemic levels of type I IFNs. In the present study the expression levels of IFN-ab mRNAs in organs and cells from Ad-infected mice suggested a dominant role for splenic mDCs in the IFN-ab response. Furthermore, the IFN response to Ad was practically absent in mice depleted of CD11c high MHC II + myeloid DCs. Also, there was a striking similarity between the IFN-ab subtypes induced by Ads in the spleen of infected mice and those induced in mDC cultures in vitro. It should be emphasized that in mice infected with VSV, in which splenic pDCs are the main IFN producers, the spectrum of in vivo induced IFN-a subtypes was markedly different [76] . Finally, the finding that the response of Ad-infected mice was completely independent of TLR signaling and strongly dependent on IFN-ab feedback provide further arguments against a major role for pDCs. In a number of viral infection models, IFN-a and -b production by pDCs was mediated by TLR7/9 [13, 19, 23] and was at least partially independent of a positive IFN-ab feedback [76, 77, 79, 80] .",

In [10] the loss of TLR9 signaling resulted in a reduction of the IFN-a response in mice infected with the recombinant species C Ad-lacZ [10] . This finding suggested a significant contribution of TLR9, and therefore of pDCs, to the Ad-induced IFN-ab response in vivo. The ratio of pDCs to mDCs (approximately 1:1) in the spleen of animals used in the above study was quite different from that we and others [50] have found (approximately 1:10). This may explain the conflicting results on the role of TLR9 in vivo, between this previous study and ours. In another study [42] the induction of IFN-ab was studied in mice with an artificially enlarged pool of DCs (due to prior pretreatment with sFLT-3L), 24 h after recombinant Ad administration. In our study na\u00efve mice were used and 24 h after Ad infection the levels of IFN-ab were already below the detection limit. Of note also, the bone marrow stromal antigen 2 (BST2) (that is recognized by the PDCA-1 antibody used for isolation of pDCs in [42] ), was shown to be up-regulated on numerous cell types following stimulation that triggers an IFN response [81] . Thus, the use of the PDCA-1 antibody for the isolation of pDCs seems to be more reliable in the case of uninfected mice [81] .",

            "text": "Recently, an absolute IRF-3 dependency of the in vitro IFN-ab response of bone marrow derived macrophages to Ad has been reported [63] . In our study IRF-3 deficiency had no significant effect on the levels of IFN-ab induced in Ad-infected mice. In addition, in Ad-infected macrophages, the relatively low level of IFN-a4 mRNA and its negative regulation by the autocrine Figure 11 . Adenovirus triggered IFN-ab production is the mediator of LPS hypersensitivity. Wild-type and IFN-abR 2/2 mice (4-6 mice/ group) were infected i. p. with 1610 10 Ad3 particles or left uninfected. 16 h later the animals received 1 mg LPS i. p. or diluent only. TNF-a was determined in plasma 2 h after challenge (A). One representative experiment of three is shown. n.d.: not detectable. IRF-7 2/2 and TLR9 2/2 mice were infected i. p. with 2610 9 Ad5 GFP particles and injected 16 h later with 1 mg LPS i. p. TNF-a was determined in plasma 2 h later (B). IFN-ab signaling is required for Ad infection augmented LPS lethality. Wt and IFNabR 2/2 mice were infected with 1610 10 Ad5 GFP particles i. p. or left uninfected. 16 h later mice were injected with 3.5 mg LPS/gr. bw. The number of dead/total animals are shown at the indicated time after LPS challenge (C). Ad infection increases mCD14 expression on splenic macrophages in an IFN-ab signaling dependent manner. Wt and IFN-abR 2/2 mice were infected with 1610 10 Ad5 GFP particles i. p. or left uninfected. Expression of mCD14 was measured on the surface of F4/80 + splenic macrophages by FACS 16 h after infection (D). Ad infection increases acetylation of histone H4 in wt macrophages at the TNF promoter. Wt and IFNabR 2/2 BMMs were mock-infected or infected with 5400 Ad5 GFP particles/cell and levels of acetylation of histone H4 were measured at the TNF-a promoter with ChIP assays (E). Representative experiments of two are shown. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1000208.g011 feedback was different from our in vivo findings (strong induction and positive regulation by feedback). This is in agreement with the concept that in vivo macrophages make no significant contribution to the IFN-ab response to Ad. A likely explanation is that the induction of IFN-ab in macrophages requires the high numbers of virions used in vitro, and that such multiplicities were never reached in vivo. Interestingly however, in contrast to IFN-ab induction, the induction of IL-6 proceeded in the spleen of infected mice in both DC and non-DC populations. In accordance, the depletion of IFN-ab-producing mDCs in mice prior to infection lowered, but did not entirely prevent the IL-6 response. It is possible that the pathways leading to the induction of IFN-ab and IL-6 by Ad are different, at least in different cell types. Alternatively, in vivo, part of the IL-6 formed is induced indirectly via secondary mechanisms. In this context it is interesting that blockade of the p38 MAPK in mDCs in vitro had no effect on Ad-induced IFN-ab production, but partially inhibited the production of IL-6. Our data showing that IFNabR 2/2 mice exhibit strongly impaired IL-6 responses to Ad is in agreement with a previous report [10] and shows that IFN-ab is a positive regulator of IL-6 production. Moreover, our data indicate that this effect could be explained at least in part by the positive regulatory effect of IFN-ab on Ad-induced IL-6 transcription and is achieved by the alteration of the chromatin structure at the IL-6 promoter.",

The only exception was the TLR9-and MyD88-dependent IFN-ab response elicited by Ad2Ts1, a mutant virus deficient in endosomal escape [5] . However, compared to all other Ads used in this study, Ad2Ts1 induced very low levels of IFN-ab, with faster kinetics and only when used in very high amounts. This is consistent with the finding that the mechanisms of type I IFN induction by Ad2Ts1 and the other adenoviruses are not the same. We suggest that the fast escape of Ads from the endosome circumvents activation of endosomal TLRs. The requirement for a longer endosomal retention time in TLR9dependent IFN-ab production has been recently demonstrated [82] . On the whole, our experiments indicate that Ad endosomal escape is required for the induction of IFN-ab in vivo and suggest a cytosolic pathway. The same requirement was ascertained in the present study for the IL-6 response.",

            "text": "Sensors of nucleic acids are powerful initiators of the TLRindependent cytosolic IFN-ab induction [12, 14, 15] . We excluded in this study a major involvement of the cytoplasmic RNA sensors RIG-I and MDA-5 in the induction of IFN-ab by Ads. Likewise, our study does not support a major participation of the cytosolic DNA sensor DAI/Zbp1 in this induction either. However, our study did not formally exclude the existence of all potentially redundant recognition pathways. So far reported, the pathway(s) of IFN-ab induction activated by cytosolic DNA is (are) strictly dependent on IRF-3 and minimally on IRF-7 [34, 35, 36, 37, 39] . IRF-3 was also reported to be essential for the adenoviral DNAdependent induction of IFN-ab in BMMs in vitro [63] . In agreement, in this study we show that transfection of BMDCs with naked adenoviral DNA or with whole virions of the endosomal escape deficient Ad2Ts1 results in a strictly IRF-3 dependent IFN-ab response. Evidently however, the IFN-ab response of Ad-infected BMDCs and mice is independent of IRF-3. These findings do not exclude a requirement for dsDNA recognition in the induction of IFN-ab, but suggest a different induction mechanism and show the importance of cellular compartmentalization during normal Ad entry. A possible important factor involved in cytosolic Ad sensing might be the adenoviral cysteine protease L3/23, whose activation requires the presence of Ad DNA [83] . This assumption is supported by our finding that a small fraction of the protease-lacking Ad2Ts1 still reaches the cytosol (Fig. 10F, H) , but is devoid of any IFN-abinducing activity. This enzyme, apart from its involvement in maturation of viral proteins and endosomal escape, is essential for the stepwise disassembly of Ads in the cytosol and the release of viral DNA at the nuclear pore [5] .",

Inhibition of positive IFN-ab feedback is a likely explanation for the negative regulation of the IFN-ab response, observed, in mice infected with intact Ads (expressing early genes) in this study. Likely candidates for negative regulators of the IFN-ab production are the E1A proteins. Previously, they were shown to inhibit Stat1 signal transduction [86] , which plays a role in positive feedback signaling by means of the IFN-ab receptor.",

The adverse effects observed in therapeutic trials, such as systemic inflammatory response and toxicity [6, 7, 9] can be at least partly explained by the enhanced susceptibility of the Adinfected host to microbial components, such as LPS [72] and lipopeptides (unpublished results) from incoming secondary pathogens or from the patient's own flora. Our in vitro finding of a strongly enhanced TNF-a response to LPS in Ad5-GFP-infected human DCs suggests that enhanced susceptibility to LPS may develop also in patients treated with adenoviral vectors. As shown here, this hypersensitivity is mediated by viral-induced IFN-ab, which is in accordance with the role of IFN-ab as a key mediator of sensitization to LPS [87, 88] . The increased mCD14 expression on LPS target cells and epigenetic changes on promoters of relevant genes (both shown here), may at least in part explain the role of IFN-ab in the development of Ad induced LPS hypersensitivity.",

Moreover, this response was observed also in patients administered with recombinant adenoviral vectors [42, 90] . Since as shown here, IFN-a pre-treatment is capable of increasing susceptibility to LPS of human DCs in vitro, we assume that Ad-induced IFN-ab can induce LPS hypersensitivity in humans in vivo. Undesirable complications mediated by IFN-ab can occur not only during gene therapy, but also in immunocompromised patients where Ads are major pathogens [1] . Our finding that blocking SAPK/ JNK signaling inhibits the IFN-ab response to Ads, is of potential interest for prevention or treatment of the direct and indirect adverse effects of IFN-ab in Ad gene therapy.",
