            "text": "Pancreatic cancer is the 5 th leading cause of cancer deaths, and there are no effective treatments. We developed a poxvirus platform vaccine with improved immunogenicity and inserted the mesothelin gene to create an anti-mesothelin cancer vaccine. Mesothelin expression is mostly restricted to tumors in adult mammals and thus may be a good target for cancer treatment. We show here that the modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) virus expressing mesothelin and the enhanced MVA virus missing the immunosuppressive A35 gene and expressing mesothelin were both safe in mice and were able to induce IFN-gamma secreting T cells in response to mesothelin expressing tumor cells. In addition, the MVA virus has oncolytic properties in vitro as it can replicate in and kill Panc02 pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line tumor cells, even though it is unable to replicate in most mammalian cells. Deletion of the A35 gene in MVA improved T cell responses as expected. However, we were unable to demonstrate inhibition of Panc02 tumor growth in immunocompetent mice with pre-vaccination of mice, boosts, or even intratumoral injections of the recombinant viruses. Vaccine efficacy may be limited by shedding of mesothelin from tumor cells thus creating a protective screen from the immune system.

            "text": "Pancreatic cancer is the 5 th leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States [1] and has the lowest 5-year survival rate (7%) for solid tumors [2] largely owing to the fact that radiation, surgery, and current chemotherapy options are ineffective. New treatment strategies are essential. Human mesothelin is normally expressed only in mesothelial cells of the pleura, peritoneum, and pericardium. However, mesothelin is overexpressed in a high percentage of ovarian cancers, pancreatic cancers, non-small lung cancers, and mesotheliomas, making it a potential target for anti-cancer treatments [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . Human and mouse mesothelin share sequence similarity, expression patterns, and biochemical characteristics, [7] , and the homeostatic function of mesothelin in mammals is unknown: the gene can be deleted without apparent effect in mice PLOS C57Bl6 mice and thus can be grown in syngeneic mice to allow for study of an anti-tumor immune response in an immunocompetent mouse model. This has a great advantage over tumor studies performed with xeno-or allografts in immunocompromised mice. To determine whether we can improve vaccine immunogenicity and efficacy, we test the parental normal MVAmeso virus vaccine against the MVA mesothelin expressing virus that has had the immunosuppressive A35 gene removed (MVAmesoA35Del).",

In both cases, mesothelin was cloned into a vector (pLW44, a gift from L. Wyatt, National Institutes of Health) designed for insertion into an area of the MVA genome where genes had been naturally deleted during passage of the virus [44] . Recombinant viruses expressing the gfp marker protein were selected, purified, and analyzed to confirm the genotype by raid prep PCR analysis [45] . The presence of the mesothelin gene was confirmed using mesothelin-specific primers (GGCTGGCTATGGCTGTAAGAC and AGCAGTGT TGGATGAGTCCATCGT) with an annealing temperature of 51\u02daC. In order to assess the presence of the A35 gene, recombinant viruses were analyzed using A35 specific primers (TGACTA TAACAGATACATT and CAGATTATCTGAAGGATTGAT) at an annealing temperature of 40\u02daC.",

Plates were then washed (PBS with 0.05% Tween 20, 0.1% Sodium Azide) and incubated with biotinylated rat anti-mouse IFN-gamma (0.5 mg/ml; Pharmingen) for 2 h at 37\u02daC. Plates were washed and incubated with streptavidin-AP for 1 h at 37\u02daC. Plates were developed with an agarose-BCIP (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate)-AMP mixture, and spots were counted by using a dissection microscope.",

We attempted to measure reactivity to Panc02 cells, which express mesothelin on the surface by flow cytometry as we have done previously [7] , however we got very low responses, possibly due to released mesothelin (Fig 2) binding the anti mesothelin antibodies in vivo. We then measured the frequency of anti-mesothelin IFN-gamma secreting T lymphocytes by ELISpot assay. Mice vaccinated with PBS or MVA had very few (<5) splenocytes that secreted IFN-gamma in response to Panc02 cells (Fig 4) . MVAmeso vaccinated mice had an average of 53 IFN-gamma secreting T cells per 10 6 splenocytes, and MVAmesoA35Del had an average of 80, significantly more (p<0.05) than MVA and PBS treated mice. In comparison, there were very few spots (1-3) in response to stimulation with Lewis Lung cells that do not express mouse mesothelin, and mice vaccinated with MVA, MVAmeso and MVAmesoA35Del viruses all had good responses to restimulation with vaccinia virus (124, 147, and 148 spots respectively). These results indicate that while all mice responded to the virus infection, and the mesothelin expressing viruses induced an immune response in mice that reactivated in response to mesothelin expressing Panc02 cells. Additionally, vaccination with the MVAme-soA35Del virus induced 52% more responding T lymphocytes compared to the MVAmeso virus, suggesting that removal of the A35 induced a stronger immune response, but the difference did not reach statistical significance.",

BHK and Panc02 cells were infected at an MOI of 5 pfu/cell so that each cell would be infected, and the supernatants and cells were harvested separately and titered for virus quantity over time. As shown in Fig 5, over 48 h the number of infectious MVA virions (plaque forming units, pfu) increased in BHK cells more than 2 logs. MVA replication in Panc02 cells also increased by more than 2 logs, suggesting that the MVA viruses might be effective oncolytic viruses in vivo since they can infect and replicate selectively in the Panc02 tumor cells, while unable to replicate in normal mammalian tissues. Viruses released into the supernatants also increased during MVA infection of both cell lines. These results were promising, because they indicated that the virus could potentially amplify in situ and spread to cells that were not initially infected at the time of virus inoculation.",

Mesothelin is released from cells and can be detected in the supernatants of cultured cells [7] and in much higher quantities in cells infected with MVA viruses that expresses mesothelin under a viral promoter. Injection of the mesothelin expressing viruses into animals caused no apparent ill effect to at least 4 months after vaccination, suggesting that MVAmeso vaccine is safe and does not initiate a deleterious autoimmune response. The MVAmeso vaccine induced a strong response to the mesothelin expressing Panc02 tumor cell line, only slightly smaller than the amount of anti-vaccinia virus T lymphocytes induced by injection of vaccinia virus [29] . These results indicate that the mesothelin protein was expressed in an immunogenic form by the virus in the infected mice. Furthermore, MVA virus (with and without mesothelin expression) was able to replicate in and kill Panc02 tumor cells grown in vitro, suggesting that it would be an effective oncolytic virus in vivo. Our previous results suggested that mesothelin might be a good target for control by an immune response [7] , as mesothelin overexpression reliably caused a decrease in a heterotopic tumor growth in an immunocompetent syngeneic mouse model while in vitro proliferation was not inhibited [7] . Together, these results suggested that MVAmeso might be an effective treatment for Pancc02 tumors, and that the MVAmesoA35Del might be more effective given its improved immunogenic properties [31] .",

One possibility is that the Panc02 tumor cell line is simply too aggressive for control in an animal model where the tumor microenvironment may act to protect and promote tumor cell growth [7] . While we had hoped that intratumoral injection would allow the virus to replicate in, spread, and kill tumor cells, we did not see a potent oncolytic effect in animals. Perhaps while the MVA virus can kill Panc02 tumor cells in vitro, the anti-viral immune response in vivo limits the replication and spread of the virus. An ineffective anti-tumor immune response may also be caused by the shedding of mesothelin by the tumor in vivo (decoy mesothelin) blocking the immune effector antibodies and T cells. Mesothelin is known to be detectable in supernatants of Panc02 cells [7] and in sera from patients with mesothelin expressing tumors [6, 48, 49] . This shed soluble mesothelin may be taken up by other cells and bind anti-mesothelin antibodies rendering them ineffective. These problems may be worsened by administration of these mesothelin-expressing viruses because they also release soluble mesothelin at high levels. Another possibility is that the shed mesothelin induces a state of anergy/tolerance in the animal, but our data show that mesothelin specific T lymphocytes are generated in these animals even though there is soluble circulating mesothelin shed from the mesothelin virus infected cells. Perhaps new developments with CART cells [10] may be able to more effectively facilitate T cell targeting and killing of cancerous cells.",

Tumors that develop in humans and animals have already been highly selected in vivo to avoid the immune responses that control cancers. Further improvements in these oncolytic therapeutic vaccines may be made by including cytokines such as IL-10 and GMCSF, which have been reported to improve oncolytic potential of vaccinia virus and ultimately host survival [50, 51] . In addition, depletion of T regulatory cells may counteract homeostatic or cancer cell driven immunosuppression and enhance the development of mesothelin-specific CD8 T cells capable of killing tumor cells [52, 53] . Although some results suggest that immune responses can be counter-productive: the anti mesothelin immune response may induce autoantibodies to the target antigen as well as other proteins by epitope spreading, and these antigen-spreading autoantibodies may cause increased damage to the animal. It was previously shown that antigen spreading was associated with a trend toward decreased survival in patients with prostate cancer treated with a recombinant viral vaccine [46] .",
