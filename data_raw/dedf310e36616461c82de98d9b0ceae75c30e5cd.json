Cluster 5 contains the Rodentia and Lagomorpha with the Erinaceidae outgroup. This is the result of the early divergence between carnivores, which breaks them in the three tight families, leaving one cluster for the three furthest groups.",

The K5 clustering resulted in a single swap between a H5N1 and a H1N1 strain in C3 and C4 respectively. This result is similar to that of k-mer clustering method tested by Hoang, et al. The Human rhinovirus dataset (C) did not cluster according to the four genome groups analyzed in HRV-A, HRV-B, HRV-C and HEV-C as outgroup. Instead, K4 clustering divided HRV-A in three groups, with C1 sharing both furthest branches of HRV-A, HRV-C and HEV-C, and C3 with all of HRV-B (Palmenberg et al., 2009) . The great diversity of HRV-A created compact clusters distant enough from each other to cluster the loosest groups in each other.",
