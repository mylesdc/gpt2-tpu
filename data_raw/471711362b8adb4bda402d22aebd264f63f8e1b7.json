The resulting single-ended 50 bp sequences (reads) were compared to a non redundant viral database representing (NRVDB) all 1.2 M viral records in GenBank. A retroviral gene catalog (RVGC) was prepared by identifying human genetic loci (GRCh37.p13) homologous to domains contained in the Gypsy 2.0 retro element database. Reads were aligned to the RVGC and human transcriptome with Bowtie2. The resulting viral hit rates (VHRs) were normalized by the number of high quality reads. The expression of human genes, including HERVs, was determined using Cufflinks. Comparisons between the groups were performed using the false discovery rate.",

Single read mapping revealed one envelope and one reverse transcriptase sequence record that were significantly enriched among the demyelination samples compared to the normal controls. Less restrictive (comprehensive) read mapping showed that 2 integrase, 2 core, 2 envelope, and 3 KRAB sequences that were overexpressed in the demyelination group.",

The results of this analysis are displayed in Table 2 . Only one envelope gene and one RT gene were significantly over expressed by the best alignment procedure. Several integrase, GAG, and envelope genes, along with 3 KRAB genes, were over expressed by the comprehensive alignment procedure; limiting the analysis to the 11 PPMS specimens showed those 2 ENVs and 3 GAGs were over expressed compared to controls.

Instead, some other HERV genes from a variety of sources were shown to be significantly over expressed (Table 2 ). This highlights the difficulties inherent with these studies where multiple similar HERVs have been incorporated into the human genome.

Sheep have been used to study the evolution of ERVs within a mammalian host due to the presence of related exogenous and endogenous retroviruses. The exogenous (i.e., horizontally transmitted) oncogenic retrovirus, Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (JSRV), causes fatal lung cancers. A closely related provirus, JSRV-20, entered the host genome within the last 3 million years during speciation within the genus Ovis. Endogenous JSRV has a defective Gag polyprotein resulting in a transdominant phenotype that blocks the replication of the closely related exogenous JSRV [46] [47] [48] . That is, the expression of an endogenous retrovirus effectively blocks a fatal infection with an exogenous retrovirus. This animal data strongly suggests that endogenization and selection of ERVs is a mechanism used by the host to fight retroviral infections. Support for this concept in humans is displayed by the increased expression of (endogenous) HERV-K in patients infected with the (exogenous) retrovirus HIV, where HERV-K envelope is neuroprotective [49, 50] .",

This provided relatively high quality RNA for the subsequent analysis, but it cannot be determined with absolute certainty that retained DNA did not affect the results of the study. Another limitation of the study is the post-mortem interval necessarily associated with these samples obtained from deceased human donors. While there was no detectable difference in the PMI between the demyelination and control specimens, this interval likely allowed some RNA to degrade in all the samples.

RNA was extracted from 14 normal control, 14 demyelination (including 2 NMO), and 7 other neurologic disease (OND) cryopreserved brain specimens. cDNA libraries were prepared and deep sequencing was performed. High quality sequences were matched to the non-redundant viral database using Mega BLAST with a word size of 28 bp. Hits (matches to the database) were normalized for the total number of high quality reads in each specimen and log 10 transformed, providing a 'Log Hit Rate.' Sequences mapping to non-vertebrate viruses (phages, plant and insect viruses) and cloning vectors were removed. Viral taxa not significantly enriched in any of the samples (e.g. VZV, EBV, and Enteroviruses) Retroviral Domain Discrimination Analysis. Sequencing hits (matches) to the RVGC database were binned into retroviral domains. Mean log 2 transformed and centered hit rates to the retroviral domain types in RVGC for the demyelination (MS), OND and normal control specimens. The results are clustered using Cluster 3.0[41], showing distinctly different expression patterns in most demyelination, control and OND specimens.",
