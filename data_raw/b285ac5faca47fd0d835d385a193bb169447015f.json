Brambell, who described a saturable receptor that transports maternal IgG to a fetus or newborn. A few years later, he put forth the hypothesis of the presence of a similar receptor that protected IgG from degradation, eventually identified as the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) 1 . FcRn was originally isolated from the intestine of neonatal rodents and identified as the receptor responsible for the transmission of maternal antibodies from mother to pup [2] [3] [4] [5] . In recent decades, researchers have showed that FcRn is most closely structurally related to the major histocompatibility complex class I molecule and is composed of a heavy chain associated noncovalently with \u03b2 2-microglobulin (\u03b2 2m) 5, 6 . FcRn was also shown to bind IgG at the CH2-CH3 interface in a pH-dependent way. Binding occurs in acidic (pH \u2264 6.5) environments, and IgG is released at neutral (pH \u2265 7.4) conditions 7, 8 . FcRn is a transport receptor which mediated transfer of IgGs across the human placental barrier or the rodents intestinal epithelial barrier to a fetus or newborn 5, 9, 10 . FcRn, therefore, plays a major role in the passive acquisition of maternal immunity by newborn mammals. In addition, FcRn is capable of protecting IgG from degradation and maintaining IgG levels in the bloodstream 11 .",

Some studies have shown that mice deficient in either \u03b2 2m or the heavy chain of FcRn fail to transport IgG, meanwhile the serum half-life of IgG is shortened 14, 15 . More recently, several publications indicated that transgenic (Tg) mice that over-express bovine FcRn in the mammary gland have increased IgG levels in both milk and serum 16 . Meanwhile, some researchers have reported FcRn overexpression by Tg modification in mice and rabbits not only prolongs the IgG half-life but also enhances the humoral immune response of these animals [17] [18] [19] . More specifically, these Tg animals displayed significantly larger spleens containing a higher number of Ag-specific B cells and plasma cells in response to immunization, increased antibody diversity and prolonged Ag-specific IgG half-life 20 . This augmented immune response is also reflected in the ability of FcRn Tg mice to produce high levels of Ag-specific antibodies, B cells and plasma cells to weakly immunogenic targets or evade recognition by the immune system 21 .",

It replicates in the differentiated enterocytes covering the villi of the porcine small intestine and causes severe gastroenteritis in young TGEV-seronegative pigs. Diseased pigs often present with vomiting, dehydration, and severe diarrhea. Consistent with in vivo pathological changes, TGEV infection induces morphological and biochemical changes in host cells and some porcine cell lines in vitro. Previous studies have reported that TGEV infection induces apoptosis in PK-15 cells via activation of the p53 signaling pathway 26 . Quantitative proteomic analysis reveals that TGEV infection activates the janus kinase signal transducer and activator of the transcription 1 (JAK-STAT1) signaling pathway 27 . Several publications have also shown that TGEV could infect IPEC-J2 cells, and that it could also down-regulate proteins involved in tight and adherens junctions to alter the epithelial barrier integrity 28 . These findings suggest that TGEV infection induces a number of changes in host-cell biology that could influence cells function.",

Our studies showed that pFcRn expression can be triggered by TGEV infection, through NF-\u03ba B signal activation. An NF-\u03ba B-specific inhibitor significantly down-regulated expression of pFcRn gene by TGEV infection. Furthermore, we identified the direct involvement of NF-\u03ba B-specific binding sites by using several complementary strategies. These observations support the hypothesis that up-regulation of pFcRn expression following virus infection appears to be an innate immune response against invading pathogens that could help the host clear infection effectively.",

We used a ChIP assay to verify that these putative NF-\u03ba B binding sequences had the capability to directly bind NF-\u03ba B proteins in living cells. First, cross-linking the DNA with bound NF-\u03ba B proteins in situ in TGEV infection verus mock-infected IPEC-J2 cells, NF-\u03ba B-DNA complexes were co-incubated with p65 specific antibody. Then, the purified DNA fragments were measured by PCR.

These results show that TGEV-mediated FcRn up-regulation is mainly related to the replication of virus, meanwhile UV-inactivated TGEV-mediated FcRn up-regulation maybe related to viral structural and accessory proteins.",

Based on previous studies, NF-\u03ba B is activated via two distinct kinase-dependent pathways, the classical NF-\u03ba B pathway and the alternative NF-\u03ba B pathway. While our research mainly concentrated on the classical NF-\u03ba B pathway, its activity can be modulated significantly by additional factors that transfer into the nucleus and bind to NF-\u03ba B binding sequences. In this regard, we analyzed the 5\u2032 -flanking region of the pFcRn gene. and found there are several other transcriptional factors in this region, such as AP-1 and Sp1. Some studies have suggested that NF-\u03baB dimers can act synergistically with AP-1 and Sp1 transcriptional factors to influence gene regulation [36] [37] [38] . These protein-protein interactions may be involved in mediating transcriptional regulation of the pFcRn gene in response to stimuli and can functionally cooperate to elicit maximal activation of the promoter.",

            "text": "In order to detect whether TGEV infection activates NF-\u03ba B signaling pathway, IPEC-J2 cells were cotransfected with 450 ng/well of NF-\u03ba B luciferase reporter plasmid pNF-\u03ba B-Luc and 50 ng/well of the Renilla luciferase construct pRL-TK. Cells were infected or control-infected with TGEV and were harvested at the indicated times and luciferase activity was measured using a dual-luciferase Assay System. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). ChIP was performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Epigentek, USA). In brief, IPEC-J2 cells were infected with or without TGEV (MOI = 1) for 30 h. The cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde. The nuclei were isolated and DNA was sheared by sonication. Chromatin was immunoprecipitated with 1 \u03bc g of Ab specific for p65 or with 1 \u03bc g of normal IgG as negative control for 2 h at room temperature by an orbital shaker (50-100 rpm). The DNA samples were amplified by PCR primers (Table 1 ) in optimized conditions. Preparation of nuclear extracts, EMSA and supershift assay. Nuclear extracts were prepared using a nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction kit (CWBIO, China). The single-strand oligonucleotides was labeled with biotin on the 3\u2032 end DNA, annealed to form double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the tested NF-\u03ba B sequences from the pFcRn promoter: pFcRn \u03ba B-1286 (5\u2032 -AAAAATGGGA GTTTCCATTTCCG-3\u2032 ), pFcRn \u03ba B-1128 Scientific RepoRts | 6:32154 | DOI: 10.1038/srep32154 (5\u2032 -GTAGCCTGGGAACTTCCAGAT GCC-3\u2032 ), pFcRn \u03ba B-642 (5\u2032 -CCAGAAGAGGCAAATTCCTAGAGAC-3\u2032 ) and pFcRn \u03ba B-563 (5\u2032 -AAGGGGTACGGGGTCTCCTTGGGG-3\u2032 ). For competition assays, a 50-fold excess of nonlabeled oligonucleotide was incubated during the preincubation time. For the supershift assays, 1 \u03bc g anti-p65 monoclonal antibody directed against NF-\u03ba B p65 was preincubated with the nuclear extracts. The complexes were run on a 5% native polyacrylamide gel. EMSA experiments were performed according to the LightShift chemiluminescent EMSA kit (Thermo Scientific Pierce, USA).",
