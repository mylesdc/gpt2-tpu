The respective phosphonates were synthesized in good yields by coupling the straight chain of x-aminophosphonates and nucleobase-derived acetic acids with EDC. Based on the 1 H and 13 C NMR data, the unrestricted rotation within the methylene and 1,2-ethylidene linkers in phosphonates from series a and b was confirmed. For phosphonates containing 1,3-propylidene (series c) fragments, antiperiplanar disposition of the bulky O,O-diethylphosphonate and substituted amidomethyl groups was established. The synthesized ANPs P-X-HNC(O)-CH 2 B (X = CH 2 , CH 2 CH 2 , CH 2-CH 2 CH 2 , CH 2 OCH 2 CH 2 ) appeared inactive in antiviral assays against a wide variety of DNA and RNA viruses at concentrations up to 100 lM while marginal antiproliferative activity (L1210 cells, IC 50 = 89 \u00b1 16 lM and HeLa cells, IC 50 = 194 \u00b1 19 lM) was noticed for the analog derived from (5-fluorouracyl-1-yl)acetic acid and O,O-diethyl (2-aminoethoxy)methylphosphonate.",

Several research groups have been active in this field, both in academia and pharmaceutical industry. Despite these efforts, for many viruses efficient drugs have not been yet discovered. In addition, anticancer drugs available so far exhibit limited applicability. The high mutation rate observed for some viruses makes the issue highly complex. Within medications applied to treat viral infections, acyclic nucleoside phosphonates (ANPs) play an important role [1] [2] [3] . The prototype of the acyclic nucleoside phosphonates (ANPs), (S)-HPMPA (3), was never commercialized but it gave rise to three marketed products [cidofovir (4) , adefovir (1) , and tenofovir (2) ] that are often prescribed by physicians. So far known structural modifications of compounds 1-4 accomplished within a chain connecting nucleobase and phosphonic acid moieties did not lead to discovery of analogs having higher antiviral activity (Fig. 1) .",

Wr\u00f3blewski andrzej.wroblewski@umed.lodz.pl analogs of ANPs, the following fragments have to be installed: (1) a phosphonate unit (P-CH 2 ) which prevents enzymatic hydrolysis of the P-O bond present in natural phosphates, while being capable of further phosphorylation; (2) canonical nucleobases or their very close structurally heterocyclic systems to assure efficient interactions with the complementary nucleobases of the other polynucleotide chain; (3) a linker to adjust a distance between a nucleobase and a phosphorus atom which should contain four atoms considered optimal at this moment. Taking into account high antiviral activity of compounds 1-4, one may be interested in specific interactions of oxygen lone pairs and also of the entire phosphonomethoxy (P-CH 2 -O) fragment. The oxygen atom located within a P-CH 2 -O-CHR-fragment can serve as a lone pair donor in intermolecular interactions, and single bonds connecting atoms in the linker ensure free rotation. To modify interactions of atoms located in the linker it is reasonable to consider replacing selected fragments of the linker for another moiety.",

This particular replacement allows to preserve steric conformity of both bonding systems but essentially influences donoracceptor interactions and possibilities of a rotation around the specific bonds within the linker [completely free around the CH 2 -O bond (11.3 kJ/mol-barrier to rotation) as compared to the hindered around the C(O)-NH bond (88 kJ/mol-barrier to rotation)].

To elaborate an appropriate synthetic methodology, a series of the 36 respective phosphonates as O,O-diethyl esters was prepared in good yields by the EDC-induced coupling of the straight chain x-aminophosphonates and nucleobasederived acetic acids. Besides the rigidity of the amide bond based on the 1 H and 13 C NMR data, it was concluded that the unrestricted rotation within the methylene (series a) and 1,2-ethylidene (series b) linkers takes place while for phosphonates containing 1,3-propylidene (series c) fragments antiperiplanar disposition of the bulky O,Odiethylphosphonate and substituted amidomethyl groups was observed.

The antiviral, other than anti-HIV, assays were based on inhibition of virus-induced cytopathicity or plaque formation in human embryonic lung (HEL) fibroblasts, African green monkey cells (Vero), human epithelial cells (HeLa), Crandell-Rees feline kidney cells (CRFK) or Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK) . Confluent cell cultures in microtiter 96-well plates were inoculated with 100 CCID 50 of virus (1 CCID 50 being the virus dose to infect 50% of the cell cultures) or with 20 plaque forming units (PFU) (VZV) in the presence of varying concentrations of the test compounds. Viral cytopathicity or plaque formation was recorded as soon as it reached completion in the control virus-infected cell cultures that were not treated with the test compounds. Antiviral activity was expressed as the EC 50 or compound concentration required to reduce virus-induced cytopathogenicity or viral plaque formation by 50%. Cytotoxicity of the test compounds was expressed as the minimum cytotoxic concentration (MCC) or the compound concentration that caused a microscopically detectable alteration of cell morphology.",
