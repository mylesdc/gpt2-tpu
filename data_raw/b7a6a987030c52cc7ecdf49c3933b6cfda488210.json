Front. Cell. Infect. Microbiol. 5:23. Escherichia coli bacteria are the most common causes of diarrhea and septicemia in calves. Moreover, calves form a major reservoir for transmission of pathogenic E. coli to humans. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of publications on E. coli as calf pathogens and the role of calves as reservoir have not been done so far. We reviewed studies between 1951 and 2013 reporting the presence of virulence associated factors (VAFs) in calf E. coli and extracted the following information: year(s) and country of sampling, animal number, health status, isolate number, VAF prevalence, serotypes, diagnostic methods, and biological assays. The prevalence of VAFs or E. coli pathotypes was compared between healthy and diarrheic animals and was analyzed for time courses. Together, 106 papers with 25,982 E. coli isolates from 27 countries tested for VAFs were included. F5, F17, and F41 fimbriae and heat-stable enterotoxin (ST) -VAFs of enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) were significantly associated with calf diarrhea. On the contrary, ETEC VAF F4 fimbriae and heat-labile enterotoxin as well as enteropathogenic (EPEC), Shiga toxin-producing (STEC), and enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) were not associated with diarrhea. The prevalence increased overtime for ST-positive isolates, but decreased for F5-and STEC-positive isolates. Our study provides useful information about the history of scientific investigations performed in this domain so far, and helps to define etiological agents of calf disease, and to evaluate calves as reservoir hosts for human pathogenic E. coli.",

            "text": "Since the end of the nineteenth century, the role of E. coli as a pathogen of calves has been of interest to the scientific community worldwide. Reports concerning calf colibacteriosis are present in the works of Jensen (1903) , Titze and Weichel (1908) , Christiansen (1917) ; Carpenter and Woods (1924) , and Smith and Orcutt (1925) . The first scientific studies focused on calf diarrhea of very young calves (up to the first 4 days), which is called calf scours (in German: K\u00e4lberruhr, in French: diarh\u00e9e des veaux). The general outcome of these studies was that \"Bacillus coli\" is a main etiological factor of calf diarrhea. They divided the disease into enteritis with and without septicemia. Additionally, a dose-dependent protective role was described for the colostrum. Colostrum-deprived calves or calves with delayed colostrum ingestion died after 1-3 days and large amounts of E. coli were isolated from their small and large intestines and other internal organs. Calves fed with an insufficient protective dose of colostrum developed various forms of bacterial infections, such as arthritis and omphalitis, alone or together with diarrhea. On the other hand, calves receiving a sufficient dose of colostrum had the highest odds of staying healthy. The main characteristics of E. coli isolated from diarrheic calves were: higher counts of bacteria from different parts of the intestine, and isolation of bacteria from internal organs or pathologically changed parts of the body (e.g., joints) as compared to healthy controls. These changes were proposed to stem from toxins released by bacteria that eventually altered the intestinal physiology. These assumptions were confirmed partially and extended in the later studies of Smith (1962) . However, he disputed the role of E. coli as a causative agent of the disease in colostrum-fed calves, because of the failures encountered in establishing experimental infection and development of the disease in them. His later work, in which he developed a test for toxin production with calf ligated intestinal loops and oral inoculation of calves, helped to elucidate this issue (Smith and Halls, 1967) . Using this model, Smith was able to induce fluid accumulation in intestinal loops and diarrhea in 6-20 h old infected calves.",

            "text": "The development of new laboratory tools for the analysis of pathogenic E. coli allowed for the verification of hypotheses raised by pioneers in this field. The main goal was to find a pattern for grouping isolates and to use this knowledge in disease diagnosis and prevention. Many approaches grouped bacteria by their reactivity with sera raised against standard strains. One of the first attempts to O-serogroup isolates from calf diarrhea was done by Bokhari and \u00d8rskov (1952) . Later, the antigen K99 as virulence-associated factor (VAF) associated with the pathogenesis of neonatal calf diarrhea was defined by Orskov et al. (1975) and Guin\u00e9e et al. (1976) . Also, biochemical features of isolates were investigated extensively, but without any remarkable success to specifically identify pathogenic E. coli. The emergence of DNA-and protein-based assays for the detection of VAF opened the door for much faster and more accurate evaluations of E. coli isolates (Grunstein and Hogness, 1975; Orskov et al., 1977; Moseley et al., 1980; Burnette, 1981; Espy et al., 2006) . The progress of science had a great impact on analytical typing methods for E. coli. It is now well accepted, that due to their high genotypic and phenotypic variation, E. coli can be subgrouped into many pathotypes. Commensalic E. coli is a common part of the intestinal microbiota of most mammals and birds. Only a small fraction of the E. coli population belongs to pathovars and pathotyping is based on the occurrence of VAF and virulence mechanisms (intestinal pathogenic E. coli) (Croxen et al., 2013) or by occurrence of E. coli in organs and tissues which are sterile in healthy hosts (extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli, e.g., uropathogenic E. coli). There are six major diarrheagenic E. coli pathotypes (Croxen et al., 2013) . Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) is the confirmed main causative agent of neonatal calf diarrhea. Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC including enterohemorrhagic E. coli/EHEC) are also often isolated from diarrheic and healthy calves, but their role in calf disease remains controversial. However, EPEC, STEC, and EHEC are important human pathogens for which cattle constitute a major reservoir. Enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC), diffusely adherent E. coli (DAEC), and enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC; including Shigella) are less known in cattle.",

Recent studies show that receptor binding is different between Stx1 and Stx2 and might involve more than one glycan (Gallegos et al., 2012) . STEC that are able to induce A/E lesions are grouped as enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC). Cattles are frequent shedders of EHEC with approximately 75% of human disease outbreaks linked to bovine derived products or cattle (Nguyen and Sperandio, 2012) . EAEC was initially recognized by a specific adhesion pattern on HEp-2 cells forming cobble-stone-like aggregates (Weintraub, 2007) . EAEC adherence is mediated by aggregative adherence fimbriae (AAF) coded on a virulence pAA plasmid. In addition, EAEC form mucoid biofilms and secret cytotoxins (e.g., plasmid-encoded toxin Pet) that are toxic to epithelial cells. The enterotoxins \"enteroaggregative E. coli ST (EAST1)\" and \"Shigella enterotoxin 1 (ShET1)\" were associated with EAEC, but they can be found also in other pathotypes (Croxen and Finlay, 2010; Ruan et al., 2012) .",

Several O groups are more prevalent in single pathotypes (Ewers et al., 2014) . Other tools for the characterization of isolates are various genotyping methods e.g., pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), multilocus sequence typing (MLST), multiple loci VNTR analysis (MLVA), and the Clermont method (Clermont et al., 2000; Foley et al., 2004) .",

Data were extracted and stored in a relational database created specifically for this research and analyzed with R software (R Development Core Team, 2013). ETECs are regarded as major agents in the etiology of calf diarrhea. One of the first steps of ETEC virulence mechanisms is adhesion to the intestinal epithelium, which is mediated by fimbrial adhesins, mainly the F4, F5, F6, F17, and F41 fimbriae. According to our analysis the presence of F4 is not associated with diarrhea. F4 fimbriae-positive strains were first reported in pigs and are the most common VAF in porcine ETEC. Therefore, absence of F4 in calf isolates is not surprising. The role of F6 fimbriae in the etiology of calf diarrhea remains unclear, owing to the lack of information about healthy animals. F17 have been implicated in the pathogenesis of calf diarrhea and we show that F17 is found more often in diarrheic than in healthy calves (p < 0.05); yet, there is high prevalence of F17 positive isolates in healthy animals (27%). We propose two explanations: Firstly, the F17 fimbrium requires the presence of other VAFs to participate in the etiology of diarrhea. Secondly, F17 fimbriae genes are present in E. coli, as detected by the most common method PCR, but are not functionally expressed. Unfortunately, resolving this issue requires more in-depth research.",

F41 prevalence has the highest diarrheic to healthy ratio, which justifies a major role of this pilus in ETEC pathogenesis. F5 fimbriae were the first VAF identified in ETEC from diarrheic isolates (Guin\u00e9e et al., 1976) . They are also the most often investigated VAF in our ETEC metaanalysis. This gave us the opportunity to show changes in prevalence of F5 over time. A significant drop in F5 prevalence over the past years was observed. This outcome can be explained by the commonness of vaccination against this ETEC antigen (Moon and Bunn, 1993; Crouch et al., 2001) , which could have led to negative selection against F5 fimbriae-positive bacteria coincident with success in disease control.",

The lines show general tendencies by approximating the relationship between the year of isolation and the prevalence of a VAF using a linear model y = ax + b. The shaded areas around lines represent confidence intervals. (Nagy and Fekete, 1999) . Indeed, ST toxin was detected frequently only in diarrheic isolates, while LT was reported only in seven of 2672 isolates. The role of EAST toxin in the pathogenesis of calf diarrhea seems to be doubtful. Although the overall prevalence of EAST was high, it was represented in diarrheic and healthy samples in similar frequencies. Recently, published data by Ruan et al. (2012) indicated that an EAST1-positive isolate alone is not able to cause diarrhea in a 5-day old gnotobiotic pig model, and suggests that EAST1 is not likely a VAF in ETECassociated diarrhea. Additionally, EAST1 was detected with high prevalence in clinically healthy individuals of other domestic and wild animal species (R\u00f6mer et al., 2012; Fr\u00f6mmel et al., 2013) which also puts to doubt whether EAST1 has a prominent role in diarrhea.",

            "text": "The readers of this manuscript should raise an important question at this moment. If the highest prevalence of VAF from E. coli isolated from diarrhea is between 5 and 15%, what is happening with the rest of isolates? Are those isolates commensalic E. coli or are there still many unidentified adhesins and toxins which may contribute to pathogenesis? E. coli can be isolated from each diarrheic sample but might not be the adequate causative agent of disease. A favorable differential diagnosis of infectious agents of calf diarrhea consists of testing for rota-and coronavirus, Salmonella spp., and Cryptosporidium spp.. Unfortunately, information about such investigations was sparse in the context of our meta-analysis. Only 22 publications mentioned additional testing for at least one of the above mentioned pathogens. Other important causes of diarrhea are non-infectious, and related to housing, management, and feeding routines (Ortiz-Pelaez et al., 2008) . Isolation of pathogenic E. coli from most of these cases should be rare and are not associated with disease. The inclusion of a questionnaire into relevant studies could help in obtaining valuable information on how the environment influences animal health, but such additional data were mentioned only in 15 publications.",

            "text": "The next interesting topic raised in our work is the prevalence of STEC, EPEC, and EHEC in calves. The high prevalence of STEC, EPEC, and EHEC in healthy and diarrheic animals shows, that these animals can be considered as reservoirs for human pathogenic E. coli. The role of STEC, EPEC, and EHEC as causative agents of diarrhea in calves have been widely investigated (Dean-Nystrom et al., 1998; Menge et al., 1999; Pruimboom-Brees et al., 2000; Hoey et al., 2002) . Lack of Stx receptor in vascular endothelium makes cattle a perfect candidate as a reservoir of STEC/EHEC as it is not possible for them to develop systemic disease. Other actions of STEC/EHEC like immunomodulation (Menge et al., 1999) and intestinal colonization (Etcheverr\u00eda and Padola, 2013) help them to survive and propagate in the host intestine. Major questions remain to be answered as to whether these processes contribute to pathogenesis of diarrhea. Our comparison of the prevalence of STEC, EPEC, and EHEC in diarrheic and healthy calves showed that none of these pathotypes is associated with disease, and these pathotypes were more often detected in healthy animals. But can cattle have any profit from the presence of these bacteria? An interesting hypothesis was raised in the works of Ferens and Hovde (2000) , Basu et al. (2003) and Ferens et al. (2004 Ferens et al. ( , 2006 , that Stx production can mitigate bovine leukemia virus (BLV)induced disease in cattle. This hypothesis could explain the strong species-pathotype association, but to our knowledge no survey study about BLV-STEC/EHEC prevalence correlation has been conducted so far. Another intriguing observation is the decrease in the prevalence of STEC over time as shown in Figures 3, 4 . We assumed that prevalence might be influenced by the diagnostic methods used. To verify this, we created additional forest plots with information about methods used in the study (Supplementary Figure 4) . The analysis of this results shows, that our assumption was wrong.",

Unfortunately in many studies different sets of genes and health status of animals were investigated, therefore presented analyses for each VAF are composed of sets of various number of isolates. The atypical structure of data prohibited fitting with more advanced statistical models used often in meta-analysis. One of our goals was to evaluate the spatial distribution of VAFs and pathotypes, but it was not feasible due to the geographical sparseness of the data. Still, we think that our systematic review and meta-analysis is a good way to summarize epidemiological status of pathogenic E. coli in calves.",
