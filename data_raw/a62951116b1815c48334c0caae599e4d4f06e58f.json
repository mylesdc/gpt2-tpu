Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro cytotoxic and anti-rotavirus properties of crude extracts of A. kellalensis. Materials and Methods: The dried and powdered flowers of Achillea kellalensis were extracted with hot water and ethanol 50% (v/v). The cell viability and toxicity of the extracts were evaluated on MA-104 cells using four methods; trypan blue dye, NR, crystal violet and MTT assay. The in vitro anti-rotavirus properties were determined via four different assays, in order to evaluate the direct inhibition and/or the inhibition of viral replication. Results: Cytotoxicity of two A. kellalensis extracts showed different concentrations. Hydro-alcoholic extract had low CC 50 at 600 \u00b5g/mL by the NR assay while the aqueous extract had high CC 50 at 1000\u00b5g/mL by the crystal violet method. In the simultaneous treatment assay and post treatment assay, the extracts were able to prevent viral replication and inhibit the viral CPE on MA-104 cells at 10 TCID 50 , but the extracts did not exhibit direct antiviral activity on rotavirus adsorption. The effective concentration (EC 50 ) of both extracts was observed to be 100 \u00b5g/mL. Conclusions: These results indicate that A. kellalensis extracts exert potent anti-rotaviral activity only after viral adsorption. The two extracts from A. kellalensis showed a good selectivity index. Also these results suggest that extracts prepared from the flowers of A. kellalensis may be potential anti-rotaviral agents in vivo and be useful in veterinary medicine.",

            "text": "Rotaviruses are the major etiologic agents that cause severe, acute dehydrating gastroenteritis in young children and in a wide variety of domestic animals. The virus is transmitted by the fecal-oral route. The clinical signs of rotavirus infection include acute gastroenteritis with fever, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dehydration and rhinitis (1) . Each year, rotavirus causes an estimated 2 million hospitalizations and 450,000 deaths in children worldwide (2) . The only known treatment for rotavirus gastroenteritis is supportive therapy, the replacement of fluids and electrolytes lost by vomiting and diarrhea (1) . Oral immunoglobulins have also been used to treat diarrhea caused by rotaviruses; however, these are very costly with unknown side-effects (3) . Two oral, attenuated, reassortant rotavirus vaccines (Rotarix and Rotateq) may prevent rotavirus infections in infants and young children (4) , but they haven't been approved for infants with immunosuppressive illnesses and also vaccine effectiveness in populations at the greatest risk in developing countries such as Asia and Africa remains to be assessed (5) . Therefore, it is necessary to develop a new antiviral agent against this virus. Plants are rich in a broad range of secondary metabolites, such as flavonoids, polysaccharides, alkaloids, terpenoids, and tannins, phenolics and amino acids which have been found in vitro to have antimicrobial and antiviral properties (6) .",

However, these drugs are not currently available for human or animal use and none of them have yet been in clinical use. This has renewed interest in the search for a new anti-rotaviral agent. The genus Achillea belongs to Asteraceae or Compositae, the largest family of flowering and vascular plants (14) . Achil-lea species have been used by local people as folk or traditional herbal medicines in various regions throughout the world. Achillea kellalensis Boiss. & Hausskn. originate from Chaharmahal va Bakhtiari, Southwest of Iran, is locally known as Golberrenjas or Bumadaran-e-Sabzekohi and the consumption of herbal teas prepared from flowers of this species has long been used as a medicinal plant especially for treatment of the acute diarrhea (15) . Achillea species have major bioactive components, including flavonoids, terpenoids (monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, diterpenes, triterpenes), camphor, borneol, lignans, amino acid derivatives, fatty acids and alkamides and the activity of this genus against different bacteria, fungi, viruses and parasites might be due to the presence of secondary active metabolites such as flavonoids, phenolic acids, terpenoids and sterols which have been isolated (16) (17) (18) . However, to date the anti-rotavirus activities of aqueous and hydro-alcoholic extractions of A. kellalensis have not been evaluated.",

The inhibitory effects of A. kellalensis on the bovine rotavirus were examined by the same methods used to evaluate cell toxicity. Extracts from flowers of Achillea kellalensis were shown to be effective against bovine rotavirus. These results of the antiviral assays of A. kellalensis extracts are depicted in Table 1 . In the simultaneous treatment assay and post treatment assay, the extracts were able to prevent viral replication and inhibit the viral CPE on MA-104 cells at 10 TCID 50 . The effective concentration (EC 50 ) of both extracts was observed at 100 \u00b5g/mL. In order to test the ability of the two A. kellalensis extracts in inhibiting the adsorption of bovine rotaviruses in MA-104 cells, the virucidal assay was used. However, in contrast to the simultaneous treatment assay and post treatment assay, no inhibitory effects against rotavirus was shown in the virucidal assays and pretreatment assay, and the extracts did not exhibit direct antiviral activity on rotavirus adsorption.",

However, in the virucidal assay, the extracts were not able to inhibit or decrease the rate of adsorption or penetration of the rotavirus in the treated MA-104 cells. The extracts were not able to inhibit viral replication when the amount of virus increased from 10 to 100 TCID 50 when they were examined at a concentration of 500 \u00b5g/mL. These results indicate that A. kellalensis extracts exert potent anti-rotaviral activity only after viral adsorption. The two extracts from A. kellalensis showed a good selectivity index. A. kellalensis is a traditional medicinal herb and has long been used to treat acute gastritis (15) . Wound healing activity (27) , antihypertensive and antihyperlipidemic effects (28) , antioxidant activity (29) , estrogenic activity (30), anti-diabetic activity (31), antispermatogenic effect (32), antiulcer activity (33), antibacterial and anti-fungal activity (17, 34, 35) , anti-epimastigote activity (36), anti-viral activity (37), antispasmodic activity (38) and anti-inflammatory activity (39) , of various species of Achillea have been reported. In an earlier investigation where the Achillea fragrantissima extracts had been examined for in vitro anti-poliovirus activity, a significant antiviral activity was also observed (37) . The activity of A. kellalensis extracts against bovine rota virus might be due to the presence of secondary active metabolites such as flavonoids (9) and phenolic (16) (17) (18) 24) acids which have been shown to possess blocking RNA synthesis activity (40) . At this point, our data demonstrated that A. kellalensis extracts have potent anti-rotavirus effects in vitro. However, further investigations are required to explore anti-rotavirus activities in vivo with bovine rotavirus strains in calves or murine rotavirus strains in mice. Considering that rotaviruses cause severe diarrhea and mortality in calves and economic losses in the dairy industry, therefore use of this herb can be useful in veterinary medicine.",
