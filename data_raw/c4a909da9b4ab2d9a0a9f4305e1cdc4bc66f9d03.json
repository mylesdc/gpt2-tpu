            "text": "Wild birds are recognized viral reservoirs but our understanding about avian viral diversity is limited. We describe here three novel RNA viruses that we identified in oropharyngeal/cloacal swabs collected from wild birds. The complete genome of a novel gull metapneumovirus (GuMPV B29) was determined. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that this virus could represent a novel avian metapneumovirus (AMPV) sub-group, intermediate between AMPV-C and the subgroup of the other AMPVs. This virus was detected in an American herring (1/24, 4.2%) and great black-backed (4/26, 15.4%) gulls. A novel gull coronavirus (GuCoV B29) was detected in great black-backed (3/26, 11.5%) and American herring (2/24, 8.3%) gulls. Phylogenetic analyses of GuCoV B29 suggested that this virus could represent a novel species within the genus Gammacoronavirus, close to other recently identified potential novel avian coronaviral species. One GuMPV-GuCoV co-infection was detected. A novel duck calicivirus (DuCV-2 B6) was identified in mallards (2/5, 40%) and American black ducks (7/26, 26.9%). This virus, of which we identified two different types, was fully sequenced and was genetically closest to other caliciviruses identified in Anatidae, but more distant to other caliciviruses from birds in the genus Anas. These discoveries increase our knowledge about avian virus diversity and host distributions.",

They have a global distribution and, thanks to their ability to fly long distances, are capable of migrating across biological and geographical borders and over broad spatial scales [1, 3] .

In particular, RNA viral diversity can be high in the avian During a previous study, sequence fragments of the three viruses were identified with the ViDiT-CACTUS virus discovery method [13] . ViDiT is an ultra-low-cost random-PCR-based library preparation method for metagenomic investigations that includes: An initial sample pre-treatment to eliminate unwanted background, a retro-transcription reaction to generate cDNA from RNA, an amplification with tailed random octamers, two final amplification rounds for library completion and enrichment, and Ion Torrent sequencing. Viral sequences identified with CACTUS, a Python-based wrapper script that handles PHRAP-based read assembly and BLASTn-and DIAMOND-based sequence taxonomy assignment, were used in this study as templates for primer design. To extend viral sequence information or obtain the complete viral genome, these primers were used to connect identified viral fragments by specific PCRs or to perform genome walking with the ViDiWa method as previously described [5] , followed by Sanger sequencing. ViDiWa is a ViDiT-based nested-PCR method that uses tailed random octamers in combination with virus-specific primers to amplify unknown genomic regions flanking known sequences. An attempt was made to obtain the 5' and 3' termini of the novel viruses with 5' and 3' RACE (5'RACE System, 3\u00b4RACE System, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Finally, the 5' termini of the gull metapneumovirus was obtained by a PCR involving a strain specific primer and an equimolar mixture of primers designed based on conserved terminal sequences of other AMPVs (Meta_End1: GAATGTATACGGTTTTTTTGCCGT; Meta_End2: GGATGAATACGGTTTTTTTGCCGT; Meta_End3: TGATGAATACGGTTTTTTTCTCGT).",

However, while AMPV PAR-05 was more closely related to the other avian viruses (average pairwise identity: 66.6%), GuMPV B29 seemed to be more closely related to the other clade (average pairwise identity: 69.3% vs. 65%) (Supplementary Figure S1 ). Similar results were obtained with the other genomic regions (Supplementary Figure S1) . Therefore, while the complete genomic characterization of the novel GuMPV B29 virus supports its classification within the species Avian metapneumovirus, protein sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analyses demonstrate that it is clearly distant from all other known subgroups and it can be considered the first member of a new subgroup. Our discovery therefore increases the number of known AMPV subgroups to six.",

One GuMPV-GuCoV co-infection was found. The complete sequence of the F gene was obtained for the virus infecting the herring gull and this was 99.8% identical to the strain identified in the original great black-backed gull. Three mutations, two of which were synonymous, distinguished the two strains. However, the same mutations were found in another partial F sequence obtained for a virus recovered in another great black-backed gull, while the remaining two partial F sequences were 100% identical to the original strain. Thus, we concluded that all of these gulls were infected with the same viral type.",

Typically, the genome of avian coronaviruses is about 27-32 Kb in length and includes two short UTRs and six main ORFs, including those for the replicase gene on the 5' end (the two overlapping 1a and 1b ORFs), and those for the structural proteins on the 3' end, plus several accessory genes [23] . Unfortunately, we were only able to obtain a partial genomic sequence (approximately 10 Kb), which encompassed almost the entire sequence of the 1a ORF. Further attempts to extend the sequence, including genome walking and 5' RACE experiments, were unsuccessful. The replicase gene is normally translated into a polyprotein that is post-transcriptionally processed by virus-encoded proteases into 15 mature non-structural proteins (nsps) [23] . The partial sequence obtained for GuCoV B29 encompassed the first six proteins (nsp1/2 through nsp7) and, by exploiting the relatively high conservation of the polyprotein sequence, we were able to identify putative cleavage sites [34, [54] [55] [56] and predict the sequence of the mature peptides ( Figure 2 ). Finally, within the obtained sequences, we were able to localize two of the seven conserved replicase domains used for viral classification: The ADP-ribose 1-\"phosphatase (ADRP) domain in nsp3 and the 3C-like proteinase (3CL pro ), which corresponds to nsp5 [57] [58] [59] .",

Because only a partial genomic sequence was obtained, we could evaluate the relationship between GuCoV B29 and other members of the genus Gammacoronavirus using only the ADRP and 3CL pro domains. The obtained phylogenetic tree (Figure 2 ) included the two main clades representing the two currently defined gammacoronaviral subgenera, one of the viruses infecting marine mammals (Cegacovirus) and the other viruses infecting birds (Igacovirus). GuCoV B29 was located between these two clades, similar to two other recently discovered avian coronaviruses, the DdCoV and the Canada goose coronavirus (CGCoV), both proposed as novel species within the genus [33, 34] . This tree topology was conserved when phylogenetic analyses were performed with the whole available polyprotein sequence, but not when the two replicase domains were used separately (Supplementary Figure S3) . In fact, within the ADRP domain, GuCoV B29 and DdCoV formed a highly supported clade. When the 3CL pro region was used, DdCoV was included within the main Igacovirus clade, while GuCoV B29 still clustered separately (Supplementary Figure S3) .

The obtained sequence was approximately 8.2 Kb and DuCV-2 B6 presented a genomic structure similar to what has been reported for other avian caliciviruses, with two main ORFs, the first one encoding a large polyprotein that undergoes cleavage by a virus-encoded protease to generate several mature nonstructural proteins as well as the major structural protein VP1, and the second one coding for the structural protein VP2 [35] .

The novel identified viruses (DuCV-2 B6 and B76) clustered within one of the caliciviral clades that includes avian viruses, specifically in a clade that also includes the goose, chicken, and turkey caliciviruses classified within the genus Nacovirus ( Figure 3) . Specifically, the DuCV-2 sequences are included in a highly supported clade that includes the nacovirus goose calicivirus and two viruses recently reported in pink-eared ducks (Malacorhynchus membranaceus) [42] (within clade pairwise identity 45-97%). Overall, two main groups of avian viruses could be observed in the tree and the biggest of these clades, including 13 viruses, among which were those classified as nacoviruses, comprised viruses that were more closely related to each other than to other viruses (average within-group pairwise identity 46.9% vs. average between-groups identity 31.8%), suggesting they could represent a unique genus [35] . Interestingly, viruses identified in the bird family Anatidae (ducks and geese) could be observed in various branches of the tree (pink eared duck: PeDuCV; duck: DuCVs; goose: GoCVs; grey teal: GtCV; shelduck: SdCV). Phylogenetic trees built with the other genomic regions (VP2 and the nonstructural region of the viral polyprotein, Supplementary Figure S4) showed the same clade of anatine viruses composed of DuCVs-2, GoCV, and PeCVs, although bootstrap support for this clade was low in the VP2 tree.",

In total, we screened 33 samples and nine of those (27.3%) were positive for DuCV-2; three of those were in co-infection with other DNA viruses (two with duck papillomaviruses [5] and one with a novel parvovirus [65] ). Viruses were present at both sampled locations with positive rates ranging between 21.4% (3/14) and 31.6% (6/19) and viruses were found both in mallards (2/5, 40%) and American black ducks (6/26, 23.1%), as well as in a mallard/American black duck hybrid (1/2, 50%). For one of the viruses identified in a black duck, we obtained an almost complete coding sequence and, overall, the two DuCV-2 sequences shared 94.6% nucleotide identity, with ORFs 1 and 2 being 94.4% and 95.6% identical, respectively. For three additional viruses, all from black ducks, we obtained the full VP2 ORF sequence and sequences from black ducks were 99.3-99.8% identical to each other and 95.6-95.8% identical to the sequence from mallards. determine with certainty the cleavage sites between the nonstructural proteins, we were able to identify the typical amino acid motifs associated with enzymatic functions in caliciviral nonstructural proteins [38, 66, 67] .

Recently identified viruses that lack official taxonomic designation are indicated by circles and the viruses identified in this study are indicated by filled green circles. The tree was built with the maximum likelihood method [47] using MEGA 7 [43] based on the Le Gascuel model [50] , identified as the best-fitting model by the model test in MEGA. A discrete Gamma distribution was used to model evolutionary rate differences among sites, branch lengths are proportional to genetic distances as indicated by the scale bar, and the outcome of the bootstrap analysis [48] is shown next to the nodes. Unfortunately, presumably due to low viral load, we could not obtain sequence data beyond the screening amplicon (360 nt) for the other viruses. In total, we observed two different circulating viral types, one type was found in all mallards, one black duck, and one of their hybrids and in both sampled locations, while the other was found exclusively in black ducks and only at one of the two sampled ponds. No differences were observed between the two different sampled years. The two variants differed by nine amino acids within VP2, six within the nonstructural part of the polyprotein and 19 within VP1. However, 10 of these variable sites in VP1 were due to polymorphisms within the black duck virus itself, highlighted by the presence of double-peaks in the electropherograms, indicating either intra-host mutations or co-infection by two or more strains. Although we have only limited information and more extended screening is necessary, these results indicate that similar viruses are circulating in co-existing duck populations, as previously reported for other viruses in the same duck populations [5] .",

These two viruses, according to our analyses, are not the closest relative to DuCV-2 B6, suggesting the presence of several different viral lineages in ducks. Furthermore, avian caliciviruses have been identified in China [40, 68, 69] , Germany [38, 39] , Australia [12, 42] , and Brazil [41] and, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of avian caliciviruses in wild birds of North America.",

Although follow-up studies are required to determine additional aspects of their ecology and distribution, the discovery of these viruses, divergent from currently known avian strains and representing novel taxa, increases our knowledge about avian virus diversity and host ranges. Each one of the viruses identified in this study was observed in different related bird species, indicating limited host-specificity. Our results highlight one more time the limited knowledge about avian and, more generally, animal virology and show how a multitude of yet unknown viruses exist, even in species that are frequently subjects of metagenomic investigations.",
