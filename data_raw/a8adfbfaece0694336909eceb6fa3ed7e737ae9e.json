Whether SB should be preserved has been debated for many years. Animal experiments [4, 5] and clinical studies [6] have reported that CMV may increase alveolar collapse and inhomogeneity of pulmonary parenchyma, and thus induce further lung injury. SB during mechanical ventilation results in better aeration and less atelectasis in lung dependent zones, and less hyperinflation in nondependent lung zones in ARDS [7] . Some researchers have claimed that, even in the most severe ARDS, preserving SB activity was associated with beneficial effects in pulmonary function, speeding of weaning, and discharge from the ICU [8] . However, in a recent multicenter trial, Papazian et al [9] found that, in patients with severe ARDS, muscle paralysis was associated with a lower adjusted 90 days morbidity than patients that received placebo.Yoshida et al [10] also found that in animal with severe ARDS, muscle paralysis might be more protective for injured lung, and SB could worsen lung injury.

Caironi et al [11] has recently proved that the amount of lung cyclically recruitment and decruitment, but not lung stress and strain, leads to the increase of mortality in ARDS patients. Expiration in mechanical ventilation, as well as in normal breathing, is a passive phenomenon produced due to the lung elastic recoil forces. However, in the presence of increased respiratory driving, expiratory muscles, especially the abdominal muscles may actively participate in breathing and increase intra-abdominal pressure. It has been proved that the increase of intraabdominal pressure even 10 cmH 2 O may have injurious impacts on organ functions [12] and aggravate lung damage [13] . Therefore, we hypothesized that abdominal muscle activity during mechanically ventilation increases lung injury in severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. In this study we explored the hypothesis.",

Paralysis was achieved with pancuronium(bolus = 0.16 mg /kg, followed by 0.08 mg /kg/ h). After orotracheal intubation with an 8.0 mm ID cuff tube, lungs were ventilated with the ventilator EVITA 4 (Dr\u00e4ger Medical AG, L\u00fcbeck, Germany). Volume-controlled model with a tidal volume (VT) of 10 ml/kg, PEEP 5 cm H 2 O, I:E ratio 1:1, FiO 2 1.0 and the respiratory rate(RR)was adjusted to maintain PaCO 2 between 35 and 45 mmHg. Intravenous fluid (lactated Ringer ' s; 6 ml /kg/ h) were administrated to maintain the mean arterial blood pressure more than 70 mmHg. The right jugular vein and femoral artery were catheterized and connected to PiCCO system for measure of core temperature, mean arterial blood pressure(MPA) and obtain artery blood sample for gas analysis. A multipair esophageal electrode-balloon combined catheter was put into the esophagus, and airway occlusion technique was used to check the proper position [14] . Airway pressure (Paw), esophageal pressure (Peso) and intragastric pressure (Pgas) from a side tap was connected to the end tracheal. A MLT300L respiratory flow head was used to measure airflow, and integrated airflow to obtain tidal volume. Signal of Paw, Peso, Pgas, airflow, diaphragmatic esophageal surface electromyography (EMGdi) and abdominal muscles surface electromyography (EMGab) were recorded by powerlab 16/30 SP and chart 7.2 software on a Mac book Computer.

If necessary, additional injection oleic acid (0.2 ml each time) was given until PaO 2 /FiO 2 were below 100 mmHg. A stable severe ARDS model was established when the PaO 2 /FiO 2 value remain less than 100 mmHg within 30 min [15, 16, 17] . After obtaining the measurements at injury, ventilator mode switched to BIPAP mode and the animals were randomly divided into SB group (BIPAP SB group) and abdominal muscle paralysis group(BIPAP AP group). After muscles paralysis, the P high titrated to achieve a VT of 6 ml/kg, P low was set at 10 cm H 2 O, with FiO 2 1.0, I:E was fixed at 1:1 to minimize changes in mean Paw. The mandatory RR adjusted a PaCO 2 of 35 to 60 mmHg. In BIPAP SB group, in order to recover SB, stopped the injection of pancuronium and gradually reduced the dose of Propofol. According to previous studies, in order to ensure a strong effort of unsupported SB during BIPAP, the mandatory RR was adjusted to maintain the percentage of minute ventilation (MV) of unsupported SB to total MV >50% (Fig 1) .Other ventilator settings remained the same as the above setting. SB was monitored by online registration of the Peso signal. The amount of SB was quantified by measuring minute volumes before and after neuromuscular blockade. In the BIPAP AP group, the abdominal muscles paralysis method was described as Warner DO [18] , a flexible epidural catheter was placed percutaneous through the second coccygeal vertebra and advanced until the tip closed to the L4 or L5 vertebra in the epidural space as confirmed by visual observation and autopsy. Through the epidural catheter, 2% Lidocaine was injected in 0.5 ml increment until the EMGab was abolished and followed by continuous infusion of Ropivacaine Hydrochloride 1-2ml/h. All the other ventilator setting were totally same with BIPAP SB group.",

If the ratio of T high : T low is fixed at 1:1, then the mean Paw could be kept constant when we changed the RR.Using above method adjust ventilator, we could maintain the level of mean Paw comparable in our study. The transpulmonary pressure (P L ) was calculated as Paw-Peso. Peak Paw were recorded. Peso swings as the frequency per minute of each type of breathing cycle was used to calculate the total RR (S1 Fig) . The product of inspiratory Peso vs. time (PTP) were determined. EELV EELV at PEEP or P low was measured by simplified helium dilution method. A flexible tube inserted between endotracheal tube and the circuit Y and clamped during an end-expiratory pause at PEEP. Anesthesia balloon filled with1.5 L known gas mixture of Helium (13.4%) in oxyge was then connected to the tube. After releasing the clamp, 10 tidal volumes compressing were performed rhythmically to dilute the helium gas mixture with the gas contained in Beagles lungs. Concentration of the helium in the bag was then measured with the helium analyzer (c-square company, USA), the following formula was used to computed the EELV (ml) = Vi\u00c2Ci Cf -Vi, where Vi: initial gas volume in the bag; Ci: initial helium concentration; and Cf: the final helium concentration [21] .",

There were several reasons to explain this phenomenon: first, activity of the abdominal muscle was associated with decreased EELV. Douglas and colleagues [25] observed in their study that EELV was parallel to oxygenation. Similarly, a better gas exchange was also observed after abdominal muscle paralysis. Second, activity of the abdominal muscle was associated with increased PTP, which represented a decrease of total work of breathing and oxygen consumption.Third, activity of the abdominal muscle resulted in an decreased P L on P high , which could recruit the collapse alveolar units and result in greater lung units available for oxygenation [26] . Fourth, abdominal muscle activity increase of intraabdominal pressure which is associated with the decrease of P L and respiratory compliance on T high , which can lead to a loss in lung volume and hypoxemia episodes [27] . Fifth, activity of the abdominal muscle resulted in worsen blood reperfusion to nondependent lung area, and led to a higher VD/VT and greater inhomogeneity of lung ventilation to perfusion.

No previous studies have proved the relationships between abdominal muscle and VALI in ARDS. In an oleic acid-induced ARDS model, our study showed that BIPAP AP had lower mRNA expression of IL-6 and IL-8 in lung tissues and less total cumulative histopathological lung injury scores compared with BIPAP SB group. These findings suggested that activity of the abdominal muscle during mechanically ventilation was one of the injurious factors in severe ARDS. Various mechanisms may explain the findings:\u2460Activity of the abdominal muscle can increase the value of 4Pes which has been shown to promote the formation of pulmonary edema and aggravate lung injury [26] . \u2461Activity of the abdominal muscle can increase end-expiratory alveolar pressure at the start of expiratory. \u2462Activity of the abdominal muscle can increase intra-abdominal hypertension. It has been proved that activity of the abdominal muscles can increase IAP by up to 20 cmH 2 O [28] . When intra-abdominal hypertension existed, unopposed increase of intra-abdominal pressure by spontaneous expiratory can cause greater lung injury by reducing P L in dependent zones [13] . \u2463Activity of the abdominal muscle can decrease EELV, and make part of lung units breathing in the lower inflection point of the P-V curve and cause so-called \"low volume injury\" which is associated with the cyclic opening-closing of lung units and aggregates lung injury by interfacial forces. \u2464Activity of the abdominal muscle allows PEEP to be bad controlled and resulting in increased \"atelectrauma\". \u2465Activity of the abdominal muscle resulted in decreased P L which was presumed to aggravate lung injury. \u2466Activity of the abdominal muscle resulted in decreased EELV, so lung strain, a major determinant of VALI, might be further increased.",

Therefore, we are not sure whether these results can be reproduced in the other ARDS models. Second, due to protective strategy with a LTV used in this experiment, we cannot preclude the protective effects of abdominal muscle on a high tidal volume injurious ventilation. Third, the RR and nervous distribution of canine may not be the same as human being, so we cannot guarantee our data can be used for patients and further studies are needed. Finally, in BIPAP AP group, Lidocaine and Ropivacaine hydrochloride were used for epidural anesthesia to paralyze abdominal muscles, so we cannot rule out the possibility that these drugs affected pulmonary inflammatory response.",
