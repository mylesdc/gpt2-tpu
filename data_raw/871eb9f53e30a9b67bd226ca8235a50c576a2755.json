Furthermore, every few decades, respiratory virus pandemics emerge, putting the entire world population at risk. thus, there is an urgent need to quickly and precisely identify the infecting agent in a clinical setting. However, in many patients with influenza-like symptoms (ILS) the identity of the underlying pathogen remains unknown. In addition, it takes time and effort to individually identify the virus responsible for the ILS. Here, we present a new next-generation sequencing (NGS)based method that enables rapid and robust identification of pathogens in a pool of clinical samples without the need for specific primers. The method is aimed at rapidly uncovering a potentially common pathogen affecting many samples with an unidentified source of disease.",

However, a higher percentage of patients still suffered from a respiratory infection of unknown etiology, with clinical symptoms compatible with viral infection (Fig. 1) . We therefore set out to develop a general and robust approach to identify the unknown viruses responsible for ILS. Three possibilities were considered: (1) The cause of the ILS is an unknown virus or a known virus not yet associated with respiratory illnesses; (2) the cause of the ILS is a virus not commonly tested in the laboratory; (3) the cause of the ILS is a known virus that causes respiratory infection that cannot be identified in the routine RT PCR tests due to variability.",

Among the 9M reads, 27% found to be human genomic material, and ~61% mapped to bacterial genomes were filtered out, leaving ~1.1 million reads to be further analyzed. When applying Bowtie 2.0 to match the remaining reads to known viruses, approximately 34,000 mapped to known viruses, with 29,000 reads mapping to phi X 174 bacteriophage, which is a control sample of Illumina sequencing. The remaining ~1 million unmapped reads were assembled into larger segments (contigs). Assuming that reads from a pathogen will be abundant enough in the sample to create somewhat long contigs, 8387 contigs with more than 350 nucleotides were detected and used to query the non-redundant nucleotide and protein databases in NCBI. The vast majority of contigs mapped to a bacterial or a phage source. The remaining viral-mapped contigs were mapped to influenza B and Torque teno virus (TTV) and one contig mapped to human picobirnavirus.

The other genus detected with high prevalence was Streptococcus with 22% of the reads. To determine which samples were infected with each of these bacterial strains we performed PCR on the individual samples. Pseudomonas putida, which was the most prevalent Pseudomonas species found, was present in 12 samples in low quantities; Staphylococcus aureus was detected with a strong signal in one sample (patient 15, Fig. 5 ) and with a weak signal in two other samples and in the adenovirus positive control. Streptococcus pneumoniae was not detected in our samples (Fig. 5) . These results imply that at least in one patient (sample 15) the ILS symptoms may have been a result of bacterial infection by Staphylococcus aureus. It is quite possible that there are more bacterial strains that cause ILS symptoms in our samples that were not detected. ",

For example, we show here, that at the start of our screen, no common respiratory virus could be identified in 54 out of 300 (18%) samples collected from patients with ILS. Furthermore, new methods are needed to rapidly detect viruses present in a pool of samples to enable rapid treatment of the population in case of pandemics.

The original clinical diagnosis of our samples was infection with a viral agent, based on their symptoms. Nevertheless, our method also detected a sample that was most likely infected with a bacterial agent rather than a viral one. Interestingly, TTV was identified in many samples. TTV is the first human virus identified to have a circular negative-stranded DNA genome 37 . Its genome is approximately 3.8k nucleotides (nt) long 38 . TTV frequently circulates in many geographic regions 24, 38, 39 . Although this virus has a very high prevalence in the general population, neither its interaction with its hosts nor its direct involvement in the etiology of specific diseases are fully understood. Nevertheless, a significant correlation between TTV loads and airflow limitation within the peripheral airways, as well as between severity of bronchiectasis and decrease of lung function, has been observed 40 . Thus, it is possible that TTV was the cause of the ILS. Further studies will be necessary to confirm that TTV is indeed responsible for the ILS and to understand why TTV is present in some individuals (even in the healthy) but not in others.",

Following treatment, the control virus amount remained unchanged, while RNaseP levels were reduced (resulting in higher cycle threshold (Ct)Fig. 3). The treatment efficiency threshold was set at Ct RNaseP > 35. We selected Ct > 35 since this indicates low levels of human genome that will not interfere with the viral identification. A level of Ct > 35 is equivalent to less than one copy of human DNA. The Ct of all control viruses, but two, was above 35. In one influenza B sample the Ct was 34.01 and in one adenovirus sample the Ct was 34.81. For the mixed sequencing we took one sample of each control virus.Following this, 28 clinical samples were left in addition to 3 control samples (Influenza B, RSV and adenovirus)",

We were concerned that our initial >35 cutoff for sample inclusion might have been too stringent so we performed a second round of NGS sequencing, this time including all 54 negative samples. We split the pooled samples in two and created separate samples for RNA viruses and DNA viruses (using treatments of DNase and RNase respectively). We did this to maximize library quality and the probability for viral detection. The sequencing results for the RNA viruses sample revealed three additional viruses that were not detected in the first sequencing. Those viruses are parainfluenza 4 virus and influenza C virus that cause ILS symptoms and rotavirus A which causes diarrhoeal disease. Parainfluenza 4 and influenza C were identified by RT-PCR in two clinical samples (parainfluenza 4 in patient number 49 and influenza C in patient 30). The DNA viruses sample didn't reveal presence of previously undetected viruses.",
