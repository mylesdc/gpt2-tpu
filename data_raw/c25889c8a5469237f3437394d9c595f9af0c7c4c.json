The aim of this study was to identify the lincRNA profile in the dengue vector Aedes aegypti and evaluate their potential role in hostpathogen interaction. The majority of previous RNA-Seq transcriptome studies in Ae. aegypti have focused on the expression pattern of annotated protein coding genes under different biological conditions. Here, we used 35 publically available RNA-Seq datasets with relatively high depth to screen the Ae. aegypti genome for lincRNA discovery. This led to the identification of 3,482 putative lincRNAs. These lincRNA genes displayed a slightly lower GC content and shorter transcript lengths compared to protein-encoding genes. Ae. aegypti lincRNAs also demonstrate low evolutionary sequence conservation even among closely related species such as Culex quinquefasciatus and Anopheles gambiae. We examined their expression in dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2) and Wolbachia infected and non-infected adult mosquitoes and Aa20 cells. The results revealed that DENV-2 infection increased the abundance of a number of host lincRNAs, from which some suppress viral replication in mosquito cells. RNAi-mediated silencing of lincRNA_1317 led to enhancement in viral replication, which possibly indicates its potential involvement in the host anti-viral defense. A number of lincRNAs were also differentially expressed in Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes. The results will facilitate future studies to unravel the function of lncRNAs in insects and may prove to be beneficial in developing new ways to control vectors or inhibit replication of viruses in them.",

Generally, they are classified by their location relative to their neighboring protein-coding genes and include the long intergenic ncRNA (lincRNA), intronic lncRNA, antisense lncRNA and enhancer RNA [10] . Although a number of mammalian lncRNAs have been characterized and identified in the last few years, genome-wide identification of this class of ncRNAs has only recently become possible with the arrival of deep sequencing technologies. An expanding body of evidence reveals that lncRNAs, once described as dark matter, are involved in many biological processes such as genomic imprinting and cell differentiation [11] . They also play important roles in epigenetic and non-epigenetic based gene regulation [12] . Relatively, little is known about their involvement in activation and differentiation of immune cells, but new discoveries have revealed the involvement of lncRNA in defense systems [13] . Previous works have also outlined their quick responses to different stimuli and stress factors [14] [15] [16] [17] . In addition, it has been shown that some lncRNAs enhance virus replication or decrease antiviral immunity [18] .",

We implemented strict mapping criteria (mismatch, insertion and deletion costs: 2: 3: 3 respectively). The minimum similarity and length fraction of 0.9 between a mapped segment and the reference were allowed as part of the mapping criteria. The large gap mapper algorithm also requires each mapped segment to include at least 10% of the read with minimum length of 17 bases. We considered a gap with maximum of 50 Kbp distance between mapped read segments to span the introns from RNA-Seq data. The annotations were generated by inspecting mapping of reads and identifying likely regions corresponding to genes, including their exons and splice sites. The algorithm scans each gap in the read mapping to explore whether the gap is assigned to a valid splice site or can be relocated to a valid splice site without cost.",

We selected 22,079 sequences, which were located more than 1kb away from any other known transcripts, for finding putative open reading frames (ORF). All possible six frames were produced for all selected sequences and then the translated sequences were subjected to a domain search to identify any putative conserved protein domains through Pfam v27.0 database [33] . We discarded 8,795 sequences with potential ORF above 100 aa or conserved protein domains. The remaining sequences were submitted to a coding potential assessment tool (CPAT), which utilizes a logistic regression model made with four sequence features: ORF size, ORF coverage, Fickett TESTCODE statistics and hexamer usage bias [34] . We applied the coding probability threshold of 0.3, which led to discarding 376 sequences as putative coding RNAs. We also implemented an expression threshold on our data to strengthen the identification pipeline. Sequences with more than 10 mappable reads in at least 17 out of 35 RNA-Seq libraries were considered as valid sequences and were kept for the next step. Any possible similarity with other known proteins was found by using BLASTx algorithm against nr and Swiss port database (E-value cut off 10 \u22125 ). Finally, 3,842 potential lincRNAs were identified and used for further analysis.",

The E-value cut off 10 \u221250 was applied to our screening with the BLAST algorithm to identify the conserved sequences.

To produce the lincRNA profile of infected and non-infected mosquitoes, we re-analyzed previously published RNA-Seq data from Ae. aegypti midgut and carcass samples at 4 dpi [30] (Fig 4) . 248 and 203 lincRNAs with fold changes above four were identified in the RNA-Seq libraries of midgut and carcass, respectively (S3 Table) . The majority of differentially expressed lincRNAs were considerably overexpressed in both samples. The abundance of only 32% of Ae. aegypti lincRNA candidates decreased in response to DENV-2 infection in the mosquito carcass sample. Thirty lincRNAs were differentially expressed in both examined samples. The transcription levels of 72 lincRNAs increased after infection while their expression could not be detected in the non-infected midgut tissue sample. We selected 20 candidates of those differentially expressed lincRNAs from RNA-Seq analysis data for further investigation. The relative expression of lincRNA candidates were examined by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) upon DENV-2 infection in Aa20 mosquito cells. Only significantly overexpressed lincRNAs after DENV-2 infection are represented in Fig 5. Although we used Aa20 cells for the lincRNA expression assays, the expression patterns of almost all the examined lincRNAs (5 out of 6) were consistent with the RNA-Seq data (adult mosquito carcass sample). We used a poly-dT primer to produce cDNA, which also confirmed that all of those identified transcripts have poly-A tails and therefore are true transcripts. Based on these results, significant increase in the transcription levels of a selected number of Ae. aegypti lincRNAs suggests their possible involvement in host-pathogen interaction but further investigations are required to confirm their roles in antiviral/ immune responses.",

This gram-negative bacterium is transmitted maternally and potentially infects more than 40% of all insect species, manipulating its hosts using different strategies [44, 45] . A fascinating aspect of Wolbachia infection is limiting replication of vector-borne pathogens in mosquitoes [45, 46] . However, the mechanism(s) behind virus blocking is largely unknown. Here, we found that the transcript levels of several lincRNA genes significantly increased in Wolbachia-infected Ae. aegypti mosquitoes (Fig 6) , which may lead to differential regulation of cellular proteincoding genes. Our previous studies showed that Wolbachia could manipulate host small ncRNAs such as miRNAs and piRNAs [47] . An overall induction of small ncRNAs between 18 and 28 nucleotides was also observed in Ae. aegypti cell line infected with wMelPop-CLA strain of Wolbachia [48] . It was assumed that the upregulation of small ncRNAs in infected cells may result in an enhanced immune response and activated RNAi pathway. However, the role of these modifications in the host lincRNA gene expression profile, and potentially in anti-viral responses, is unknown and may lead to the discovery of lincRNAs that could be utilized for inhibition of virus replication in mosquitoes.",

In another study, differential expression of approximately 500 annotated mouse lncRNAs was reported during infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [50] . Recently, it has been shown that honeybee lincRNAs are also differentially expressed during infection with various viruses such as sacbrood virus (SBV) and deformed wing virus (DWV), but the biological significance of these lincRNAs is completely unknown [51] . Although exploring the in vivo functions of immunerelated lincRNAs is one exciting area for future studies, the differential expression of some lincRNAs could simply be byproducts of mRNA biogenesis or changes in global transcriptional profile due to microbial challenges [52, 53] . Struhl (2007) believed that the transcriptional machinery is not perfect producing RNAs that serve no purpose or have no significant role in infection [54] . On the other hand, there are several examples which have shown that lincRNAs could be potentially important factors in host antimicrobial responses, and may represent a new class of signaling molecules involved in innate immunity or provide a new layer in gene regulation. For instance, two interferon (INF) induced lncRNAs, which were upregulated by influenza and vesicular stomatitis viruses, regulate the expression of the antiviral factor tetherin in human HuH7 cells [55] .",

Ae. aegypti miRNA recognition elements on lincRNA_1317 were identified by calculating the normalized minimum free energy (mfe) of hybridization for each Ae. aegypti miRNA and lincRNA_1317 using RNAhybrid core script. Binding site enrichment was detected for a few miRNAs with more than two recognition elements (Table 2) . For instance, more than four recognition sites were predicted for miR-278-5p and miR-252-3p on lincRNA_1317. We also identified some hot spots for miRNA recognition sites on lincRNA_1317, which may allow multiple miRNAs to bind to the same regions (S2 Fig). miRNAs can reduce lincRNA stability by targeting their transcripts similar to mRNAs. Also, lincRNAs with multiple recognition sites may actually be competitive inhibitors of miRNA function and stopping them from binding to their genuine targets by sequestering them [21] . Although the mfe for some of those miRNA-lincRNA recognition sites suggests high probability of a binding event, further experimental investigations are required to validate this interface.",

Clearly, further research is required to provide concrete experimental evidence to support the role of lincRNA_1317 or any other Ae. aegypti lincRNAs in host-pathogen interaction. With advances in technology, the mosquito lincRNA-protein interactions can be identified using high-throughput sequencing of immunoprecipitated RNA after cross-linking (CLIP-Seq). Further, functional studies could be carried out to characterize immune-related lincRNAs. The involvement of lincRNAs in pathways associated with responses to viral infection and cellular stress makes them interesting candidates as potential targets for manipulation to inhibit virus replication or control vector populations.
