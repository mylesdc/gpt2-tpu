FFA treatment also partially blocked IFN-\u03b1 response and viral clearance by reducing the phosphorylation of Stat1 and Stat2 dependent IFN-\u03b2 promoter activation. We show that FFA treatment induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response and down regulates the IFNAR1 chain of the type I IFN receptor leading to defective Jak-Stat signaling and impaired antiviral response.",

The standard of care for chronic HCV genotype 1 infection includes a combination of interferon-alpha (IFN-\u03b1) , ribavirin and one of the protease inhibitors (either telaprevir or boceprevir). This triple combination therapy has greatly improved the sustained antiviral responses among chronic HCV patients. However, a large percentage of chronic HCV patients are still unable to clear the infection with this regimen. The predictors of sustained virological response (SVR) to interferon based combination therapy have been linked to host genetic factors IL-28B genotypes, viral load, viral genotypes, body weight, stage of liver diseases, obesity, type-2 diabetes mellitus (DM), fibrosis stage and co-infection with human immunodeficiency virus [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] .",

The increased lipogenesis and the free fatty acid (FFA) overflow to hepatocytes have been proposed to be the major cause for hepatic steatosis [19] . Chronic HCV infection also leads to abnormalities of lipid metabolism and insulin resistance, factors that also increase the risk of type-2 DM [16] .

These two FFAs were first mixed together in growth medium in a sterile environment under laminar flow so that the final concentration of FFA was 1 mM and BSA was 1%. S3-GFP cells were cultured in 10-cm dishes to 80-85% confluence and co-cultured with different concentrations of FFA for 24 hours to induce steatosis. At indicated time points, the cells were washed in PBS and cultured in regular growth medium containing 10% FBS.",

The concentration of saturated fatty acids to nonsaturated fatty acids used in our study is comparable to the pathological range of human non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. First, S3-GFP cells were cultured with increasing concentrations of FFA and hepatocellular steatosis was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy after Nile red staining. Representative pictures show that FFA treatment resulted in dose-dependent intracellular lipid accumulation in the HCV replicon cells that can be visualized by fluorescence microscopy ( Figure 1A ). S3-GFP cells treated with an equimolar concentration of BSA carrier protein were used as a control. Results of microscopic findings in lipid droplet accumulation in the cytoplasm of HCV cell cultures were quantified by microfluorometry ( Figure 1B) . The concentration-dependent toxic effect of FFA treatment in the HCV cell culture was determined by using the MTT assay ( Figure 1C) indicating that increasing concentrations of FFA were toxic to the cells. MTT assay results showed that the FFA mixture caused cellular toxicity at and above 1 mM. The long-term stability and toxicity of intracellular lipid droplet accumulation in the FFA treated HCV cell culture was also examined in a kinetic study ( Figure 1D ) suggesting that FFA up to 0.1 to 0.5 mM can induce a fairly high level of hepatocellular steatosis in 100% of the cells in culture without causing apparent toxicity. Electron microscopic studies confirmed that S3-GFP cells cultured with FFA developed intracytoplasmic accumulation of lipid droplets in the vicinity of the ER ( Figure 1E ). Based on these results, hepatocellular steatosis in HCV cell culture was carried out using the highly viable concentrations of FFA (10-100 \u03bcM) to determine its impact on virus replication and IFN-\u03b1 antiviral response.",

The expression of HCV GFP fusion protein was monitored using fluorescence microscopy (Figure 2A) , and then quantified by flow cytometric analysis ( Figure 2B ). The mean fluorescence of GFP-positive cells following FFA treatment for 5-days was increased from 69.1% to 76.8% as compared to cells treated with BSA ( Figure 2B ). The increase in HCV RNA levels in the S3-GFP cells after treatment with increasing concentration of FFA after 5-days was measured by real time RT-PCR ( Figure 2C ). The replicon based HCV cell culture model lacks the structural protein and this culture does not produce an infectious virus, therefore the effect of FFA treatment on HCV replication was examined using a persistently infected HCV cell culture system. The replication of HCV in the infected Huh-7.5 cells after FFA treatment was measured using a Renilla luciferase reporter. Cells were infected with a cell culture derived virus (MOI of 0.1) by overnight incubation then maintained in a long-term culture by splitting at 1:10 ratio. The effect of the long-term and short-term culture of FFA on HCV replication was measured. Initially, we determined the dose dependent effect of FFA treatment on HCV replication in the infected culture short term over 72 hours. The results indicate intracellular fat accumulation in the infected cell culture which resulted in a dose dependent increase in HCV replication measured by Renilla luciferase activity ( Figure 3A) . A second set of experiments was performed to determine the effect of long-term co-culture of FFA on HCV replication in the infected cell culture. For this purpose, persistently infected cells were cultured with the FFA for 5, 10 and 15 days then HCV replication in the culture with or without FFA treatment was measured by Renilla luciferase activity. Results of this experiment show a statistically significant increase in the HCV replication with a concentration of 100 \u03bcM of FFA (Figure 3B &C) . The effect of FFA treatment on HCV replication in the infected Huh-7.5 cells was also confirmed by immunostaining for core protein. Results shown in Figure 3D indicate that HCV core immunostaining of persistently infected Huh-7.5 cells that had been cultured with the FFA for 15 days show intense core staining as compared to those without FFA treatment. Taken together our results indicate that long-term culture of FFA with infected cells led to an increased HCV replication. ",

The titer of HCV RNA in the replicon culture was quantified using a real-time RT-PCR assay indicating that FFA treatment partially blocks the IFN-\u03b1 antiviral effect against HCV in a concentration dependent manner ( Figure 4A ). The effect of FFA treatment on the IFN-\u03b1 antiviral response was confirmed using a persistently infected HCV cell culture model.

Replication of HCV in the infected cell culture model was examined by Renilla luciferase assay. Results shown in Figure 4B indicate that FFA treatment blocked IFN-antiviral response in a dose dependent manner. Infected cells treated with FFA show a dose dependent increase in Renila luciferase activity. The concentration dependent IFN-\u03b1 antiviral effect against HCV in the infected cell culture was examined in the presence and absence of 100 \u03bcM FFA treatment ( Figure 4C ). In summary, our results support that FFA treatment blocked antiviral action of IFN-\u03b1 in replicon and infected cell culture. The results are statistically significant.",

            "text": "To find an explanation for why S3-GFP replicon cells that were cultured with FFA showed an impaired IFN-\u03b1 antiviral effect, we examined the ER stress pathway. Recent published reports suggest that FFA treatment induces an ER stress response [30] . Therefore, the activation of three independent ER stress pathways including PERK (RNA-dependent protein kinase-like endoplasmic reticulum eIF2a kinase), IRE1 (inositol requiring enzyme 1), and ATF6 (activating transcription factor 6) were examined [31] . Results shown in Figure 5A indicated that ATF6-firefly luciferase was activated in a dose-dependent manner in FFA-treated S3-GFP cells compared to untreated cells. FFA treatment of S3-GFP cells induced the ER stress related markers BIP, IRE1-\u03b1, and p-eIF2\u03b1 ( Figure 5B ). The levels of other kinases like PERK and PKR did not alter with FFA treatment. FFA treatment also increased SOCS3 (suppressor of cytokine signaling 3) levels. To explain the potential mechanisms that connect the ER stress response to defective Jak-Stat signaling, we examined the cell surface expression of IFNAR1, which is a known target of ER stress mechanisms. The expression level of IFNAR1 in S3-GFP replicon cells with or without FFA treatment was examined by Western blot analysis and flow cytometry. Results shown in Figure 6 , indicate that FFA treatment resulted in reduced expression of IFNAR1 but not of IFNAR2. We then examined the potential effect of ER stress response of FFA on IFNinduced Jak-Stat signaling by measuring phosphorylation of downstream proteins including IFNAR1, Jak1, Tyk2, Stat1, and Stat2 by Western blot analysis ( Figure 6A ). Tyk2 phosphorylation was affected significantly as this is dependent on IFNAR1 expression, but phosphorylation of pJak1 was unaltered. Intracellular Jak-Stat signaling in FFA-treated cells was also examined using a firefly luciferase reporter plasmid driven by the IFN-\u03b2 promoter. ISRE-Luc promoter activity was significantly affected by FFA treatment (Figure 6B ). The histogram of IFNAR1 cell surface expression showed a change in the peak (shift to left) of FFA-treated cells ( Figure 6C ) and the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) for FFA-treated cells decreased at 0.2 and 0.5 mM FFA. These results suggest that FFA treatment blocks IFN-\u03b1 mediated activation of IFN-\u03b2 promoter activity in S3-GFP cells and thus impairment of antiviral action.",

However, results of clinical studies indicate that the sustained virologic response of this combination therapy is impaired by viral and host related factors. Viral factors play an important role in the treatment response since patients infected with HCV genotype 1 show poor response as compared to genotype 2 and 3 [32, 33] . In addition to virus genotype, several host-related factors can also affect the outcome of the antiviral therapy including viral load, presence of cirrhosis, age, race, and metabolic diseases such as obesity and diabetes [34, 35] . Obesity is a risk factor resulting in a poor treatment response to both pegylated interferon and pegylated interferon in combination with ribavirin [15] [16] [17] . Hepatic steatosis can develop secondary to obesity, DM, alcohol abuse, protein malnutrition, carbohydrate overload, and chronic HCV infection [36] . Hepatic steatosis is also a common histopathological feature of chronic HCV infection that is found in 30-70% of patients [37, 38] . There are reports indicating that HCV infection induces the development of hepatocellular steatosis by blocking the release of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles from the liver to the circulation [38]. It has been reported by a number of investigators that the presence of hepatic steatosis in patients with chronic HCV infection affects liver disease progression, pathogenesis, and treatment response [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] . The mechanisms of the impaired response to interferon-based therapy in the condition of hepatic steatosis are not clearly understood.",

            "text": "We took advantage of the HCV cell culture system established in a liver-derived cell line to study the mechanisms of IFN-\u03b1 antiviral response in the presence or absence of FFAs. Hepatocellular steatosis was induced in HCV replicon cells with a mixture of saturated and non-statured FFAs. Other investigators have used this FFA cocktail to study the pathogenic mechanism of hepatic steatosis in cell culture. Our results support that FFA treatment can induce steatosis in HCV replicon cells in a dose-dependent manner. High dose FFA treatment in HCV cell culture leads to increased cell toxicity and cell death by apoptosis as reported by others [23, 30] . We show that the FFA at 10-100 \u03bcM range increased HCV replication in the infected cell culture supporting data published previously [44] . Our results suggest that intracellular fat accumulation partially blocks IFN antiviral action and viral clearance in replicon and infected cell culture. Published reports from our laboratory and others indicate that cellular Jak-Stat signaling is critical for the successful antiviral response of IFN-\u03b1 against HCV [45] . Our results provide evidence supporting that FFA treatment of HCV cell culture induces an ER stress response that blocks cellular Jak-Stat signaling by down regulating IFNAR1. As a result, IFN-\u03b1 induced Stat1, Stat2 phosphorylation, and IFN-\u03b2 promoter activity was attenuated. Studies by other laboratories, including ours, have shown that ER stress is correlated well with down regulation of IFNAR1 in cell culture models [45] [46] [47] . We propose that future studies should be conducted to determine if attenuating the ER-stress response by pharmacological inhibitors or siRNA knockdown improves the antiviral response of IFN-\u03b1 in the condition of hepatic steatosis by retained expression of IFNAR1. These results using HCV cell culture provide an explanation as to the mechanism by which chronic HCV patients with fatty liver show an impaired response to IFN and ribavirin treatment. In regards to our findings, we propose a model that chronic HCV patients with steatosis have increased lipid droplets in hepatocytes that block interferon-dependent Jak-Stat signaling (Figure 7 ). Our results are also supported by a number of studies where the role of IFNAR1 expression has been correlated with the response to IFN-\u03b1 therapy in chronic hepatitis C (48) (49) (50) (51) (52) . The studies conducted by Taniguchi et al., [48] indicate that high intrahepatic mRNA levels of IFNAR1 among chronic HCV 1b patients before treatment is associated with a favorable response to IFN therapy. Another study by Katsumi et al. [49] reported that the expression rate of IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 were significantly higher in responders than non-responders. Fujiwara et al. [50] have conducted a study where the expression of IFNAR1 receptor and response to interferon therapy was examined in chronic hepatitis C patients. They found the IFNAR2 expression level in the liver is predictive of the response to IFN-\u03b1 treatment in chronic hepatitis C patients. A study by Meng et al. [51] also examined the expression of IFN-\u03b1 and \u03b2 receptor in the liver of patients with chronic hepatitis C who are IFN responders and nonresponders. The authors found that the expression of the interferon receptor was more obvious in the IFN-\u03b1 treatment responsive group than in the non-responsive group. Welzel et al. [52] have analyzed the relationship between variants in the IFN-\u03b1 pathway and SVR among participants in the hepatitis C antiviral long-term treatment against the cirrhosis (HALT-C) trial. They found statistical significance in the IFNAR1 expression and that the IFNAR2 expression is associated with a response to antiviral therapy of chronic HCV patients. In addition to this, a number of studies have provided evidence suggesting that other mechanisms may be involved in the impaired response of IFN-\u03b1 in obese patients. For example, Walch et al. [17] found that increased expression of SOCS3 protein is associated with non-response to IFN-\u03b1 therapy. These investigators proposed that increased SOCS3 expression Figure 7 Schematic representation showing that intracellular lipid droplet accumulation affects Jak-Stat signaling by two possible mechanisms. (i) Intracellular fat accumulation induces the ER stress related proteins ATF-6, BIP, IRE1-\u03b1, and this causes phophorylation of eIF2 \u03b1 which leads to the down regulation of IFNAR1 expression. The reduced expression of IFNAR1 affects IFN-\u03b1 binding, Jak-Stat signaling, and downstream antiviral responses. IFN-\u03b1 binds to its cell surface receptor that activates Jak1 and Tyk2 phosphorylation. The activation of Jak1 and Tyk2 is required for the Stat1 and Stat2 phosphorylation. pStat1 and pStat2 bind to IRF9 to form a complex that translocates to the nucleus to induce IFN-stimulated gene expression. (ii) We show here that FFA treatment induces SOCS3 that also inhibits the phosphorylation of Stat1 and Stat2. also blocks tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1 in response to IFN-\u03b1 stimulation. We also found that SOCS3 levels are increased but SOCS1 are not increased (data not shown) in replicon cells treated with FFA. The involvement of SOCS3 is also another possible mechanism for how the intracellular lipid alters Jak-Stat signaling. These in vitro findings suggest that FFA-induced ER stress and SOCS3 levels are the two major targets that play a role in reducing Jak-Stat signaling and impaired antiviral response of IFN-\u03b1 in FFA-treated cells.",
