However, after nine months cases resurged with re-establishment of endemic rabies transmission to pre-intervention levels. Previous analyses investigated district level spatial heterogeneity of vaccination coverage, and dog density; and importation, identifying the latter as the primary factor for rabies resurgence. Here we assess the impact of individual level heterogeneity on outbreak probability, effectiveness of vaccination campaigns and likely time to resurgence after a campaign. Geo-located contact sensors recorded the location and contacts of 237 domestic dogs in N'Djam\u00e9na over a period of 3.5 days. The contact network data showed that urban dogs are socially related to larger communities and constrained by the urban architecture. We developed a network generation algorithm that extrapolates this empirical contact network to networks of large dog populations and applied it to simulate rabies transmission in N'Djam\u00e9 na. The model predictions aligned well with the rabies incidence data. Using the model we demonstrated, that major outbreaks are prevented when at least 70% of dogs are vaccinated. The probability of a minor outbreak also decreased with increasing vaccination coverage, but reached zero only when coverage was near total. Our results suggest that endemic rabies in N'Djam\u00e9na may be explained by a series of importations with subsequent minor outbreaks. We show that highly connected dogs hold a critical role in transmission and that targeted vaccination of such dogs would lead to more efficient vaccination campaigns.",

A deterministic model of rabies transmission predicted that mass vaccination of dogs would be sufficient to interrupt transmission for six years [2] . Vaccination campaigns in dogs were conducted in 2012 and 2013, with both campaigns exceeding 70% coverage [5] . Rabies transmission was interrupted in January 2014 after the second vaccination campaign [3] , but there was a resurgence of cases nine months later. Subsequent analyses considered reasons for the quick resurgence, including spatial heterogeneity of vaccination coverage, and dog density; underreporting of cases; and importation. Simulation results from a deterministic metapopulation model suggested that importation was the most likely reason for the case resurgence [6] . Although deterministic models can predict the effect of large scale vaccination campaigns and the overall population dynamics, they do not adequately capture effects of stochasticity in low level endemic settings. This becomes important towards the end of an elimination campaign or upon re-establishment after interruption of transmission [7] . Previous models did not include fine scale heterogeneity at the individual level or the network structure of dog to dog contacts.",

They found that the rabies front set off by an incursion of rabies into a healthy population moved more slowly than in a previous model of homogeneous fox populations. Including contact behavior in the model also resulted in a substantially higher predicted rabies control success rate. Hirsch et al. [33] used data from 30 raccoons fitted with proximity loggers to assess properties of the raccoon contact network. Unlike in earlier radiotelemetry studies, they found a highly connected population and discussed possible implications of the social network on the spread of rabies. Reynolds et al. [34] used proximity logger data from 15 raccoons to build a contact network model of 90 raccoons and simulate rabies spread. They studied the effects of seasonality, differences in vaccination coverage and impact of behavioral changes in infected raccoons on disease spread. D\u00fcrr and Ward [35] used a contact network model of rabies transmission among owned free-roaming dogs in Australia to estimate the impact of a hypothetical rabies incursion from Indonesia. They differentiated transmission within households, between households and between communities. The probability of between household transmission was based on GPS data from 69 dogs, while between community transmission was estimated using questionnaire data. Johnstone-Robertson et al. [36] developed a contact network model for rabies in the wild dog population in Australia. They constructed a function for dog contact probabilities, using a wide range of different values to generate contact networks and then implemented a rabies transmission model based on parameters from literature.",

The devices contain Global Positioning System (GPS) modules to track the location and movements of dogs and Ultra-High-Frequency (UHF) technology sensors to measure close-proximity events between dogs. The GCS devices record locations at one minute intervals. For the contact recording, the devices broadcast beacons at one minute intervals and constantly scan for beacons ensuring that no contacts with durations of at least one minute will be missed. Close proximity events were defined as records with a received signal strength indicator (RSSI) of more than -75dBm. Static tests of the devices showed that, independently of the angle between two devices, all contacts closer than 25 cm are registered when signal strength is above that value (S1 Fig). Collars fitted with the devices were placed on free roaming domestic dogs in three city districts (Table 1, Fig 1) with different dog densities (low, medium and high), that were easily accessible. The zones were chosen to include urban and peri-urban areas. Data were collected during the dry season in December 2016. In the selected districts, all dog-owning households in a pre-defined area of 1km 2 were identified in order to capture as many of the contacts between dogs as possible, bearing in mind that only contacts between dogs that both wear a sensor can be captured. Dog owners were asked to enroll their pets. Only one dog owner refused to participate in the study. The GCS units remained on the dogs for 3.5 days. After retrieval of the GCS units, dogs were vaccinated against rabies. We excluded study zone 3 from the network analysis due to the low proportion of devices usable for analysis.",

If people recognise rabies they are more likely to kill rabid dogs. [4] . The transmission rate is chosen using Eq (1). We calculated the mean and variance of the empirical degree distribution, choosing the transmission rate such that R 0 is smaller or equal than 1. We reasoned that rabies is endemic in N'Djam\u00e9na, with a constant low number of cases and no large outbreaks observed. The transmission rate choice is further supported by the comparison of the simulation results to the outbreak data from Chagoua and Abena.",

We differentiate between minor outbreaks, which are outbreaks where more than one and less than one percent of the nodes gets infected, and major outbreaks, which are outbreaks where more than one percent of the nodes get infected. Incursions denote all outbreaks where more than one node gets infected and therefore include both minor and major outbreaks. The figure suggests the construction algorithm performs well since the empirical and the simulated network yield similar results in outbreak probability and size. The values of the proportion of simulation runs with outbreaks correspond to the values of the average relative outbreak size, that is the sum of all the final outbreak sizes divided by the number of nodes in the network and the number of simulation runs. This is consistent with the theoretical result that the probability of a major outbreak and the relative size of such a major outbreak are equal [38] . This holds despite the clustering of the synthetic network being higher than in a random graph due to the spatial component of the network construction algorithm. In Fig 2 the outbreak size increases steeply for transmission rate values that are slightly larger than 0.02. This is consistent with the basic reproductive ratio R 0 given by",

In both zones, nearly all dogs were part of one connected component, that is a sub-graph where any two nodes are connected by a path. The network can be divided into communities using a modularity optimization algorithm [39] . This algorithm optimizes both, the number of communities and the assignment of each node to a specific community, such that the modularity, that is the density of links within communities compared to links between communities, takes the maximum possible value. When the network of study zone 1 is divided into communities using this algorithm it becomes visually obvious that communities mainly consist of dogs which live close together and do not frequently crossrange across roads with traffic (Fig 3) . This suggests, that roads with high traffic intensity constitute a functional barrier which substantially reduces contact between dogs residing on either side.",

The 7 cases were the first to occur north of the Chari River. Chagoua and Abena are virtually separated from other quarters to the west, north and east by main traffic roads and to the south by the Chari River. The area of these two quarters is approximately 4km 2 , and the total number of dogs is estimated to be around 3,500. We simulate the course of the infection after the incursion of one rabid dog. We found that in 450 out of 1000 simulations the chain of transmission was longer than 1, in other words additional dogs get infected. Among these chains of transmission the median of the cumulative incidence of all simulation runs aligns well with the cases observed in Chagoua and Abena (Fig 4) . This suggests that the transmission rate in our model is a reasonable choice and that our simulations yield realistic results. Since rabies is often underreported, the true number of cases is likely to be higher than the reported number of cases. We accounted for this in a sensitivity analysis on the reporting probability (S3 Fig). We found that if more than 60% of the cases are reported, the median of the simulations does not differ more from the incidence data than with perfect reporting.

We considered a 4 \u00d7 4 kilometer square and a dog population with the same density as the dog Dog contact networks and rabies transmission population in study zone 1, which yields a network with 4930 nodes. We ran rabies incursion simulations on that network. The outbreak probabilitiy, size and duration across different vaccination coverage are shown in Fig 5. The probability of a major outbreak, defined as more than 1% of the dog population becoming infected, is substantially reduced when vaccination coverage is above 70%. The probability of minor outbreaks also decreases with vaccination coverage, but only reaches zero with nearly complete vaccination coverage. Even though a minor outbreak, by definition, could affect up to 1% of the population (50 dogs) the simulated average outbreak size is, in fact, very low. This is consistent with the theoretical result that the final number of infected nodes converges to a two point distribution. A proportion of simulation runs stays close to zero whereas the other proportion ends up near the major outbreak size (for an example see S5 Fig) . The minor outbreaks, therefore, only capture the short chains of transmission. These chains include, on average, 5 dogs and last approximately 20 weeks, yielding an average number of one infected dog per month which aligns well with the observed endemic situation in N'Djam\u00e9na [4] .",

Comparing these probabilities with the incidence data (Fig 6) showed that the first case after the vaccination campaigns could not establish a chain of transmission because the probability for a major outbreak was very low at that time. Later, in February 2016, the respective probability was higher which could explain the subsequent cases. ",

Dogs can be vaccinated at random or in a targeted way, based on the contact network structure among the dogs or based on the movements of the dogs. We considered four different ways of targeting dogs: (i) vaccination in order of the degree centrality of the nodes, (ii) vaccination in order of the betweenness centrality of the nodes, (iii) vaccinating each node with a probability that is linearly proportional to the average distance the corresponding dog spent away from the home location of the owner and (iv) vaccinating each node with a probability that is linearly proportional to the area covered by the corresponding dog, where the area was estimated by fitting a minimal convex polygon to the GPS locations of the dog. The outbreak probability and size for each type of vaccination and different coverages are shown in Fig 7. Consistent with previous findings [40, 41] we observed that targeted vaccination reduces the outbreak probability and size more than random vaccination. Targeting nodes by degree yields a lower outbreak probability and size than targeting nodes by betweenness. The betweenness centrality of a node i is the proportion of shortest paths between any pair of nodes in the network that pass through node i. Nodes with high betweenness centrality are therefore part of many short paths between nodes, which is why removing them affects the global network structure and reduces the size of the largest component, while targeting nodes by degree operates on a local level and reduces the total number of edges more rapidly. In our case, chains on average are short, so the local structure is Dog contact networks and rabies transmission more important than the global structure. Vaccination based on movement also reduces the outbreak probability and sizes.",

Differentiating between minor and major outbreaks revealed that even though the probability of major outbreaks is very low for high vaccination coverage, minor outbreaks can still occur even at nearly complete vaccination coverage. These minor rabies outbreaks consist of approximately 5 dogs, which aligns well with current observations from N'Djam\u00e9na [4] .

Targeted vaccination based on betweenness centrality does not perform better than targeted vaccination based on degree centrality. The observation that vaccination by degree performs as well as vaccination according to other network centralities is consistent with previous findings in humans [41] . The degree or betweenness centrality can only be assessed using expensive methods like the tagging with geo-located contact sensors conducted in this study. Such methods cannot be used in routine surveillance. We have shown that vaccination based on movement also reduces the outbreak probabilities and sizes. This might indicate that oral vaccination would be an effective intervention because dogs which cover a lot of territory would be more likely to encounter oral vaccine baits. Oral vaccination has been shown to effectively prevent rabies in dogs [44] and is currently recommended by the WHO as a complementary measure to increase coverage in mass vaccination campaigns [45] . Oral vaccination must be carefully planned with regard to biosafety, for example by assuring that vaccinators retrieve unconsumed baits [46] .

Our simulations are based on the assumption that rabid dogs stay infective for two days on average, which does not consider the fact, that rabid dogs can be infectious for several days before they show symptoms. Previous models of rabies in wildlife indicated an effect of seasonality on outbreak sizes and durations. Collecting contact data at different times of the year is currently planned, and subsequent analyses will explore the impact of seasonality on contact rates. Dog contacts were only measured for a period of 3.5 days, the extent of battery life. While this observation window is longer than the average infectious period, we cannot be certain that the structure of the network would remain the same when measured for a longer time. Also, contacts with untagged owned dogs and unowned dogs (approx. 8% to 15% of the dog population) were not recorded. Furthermore, we did not include the change of behavior of a rabid animal. However, Reynolds et. al. [34] found that assuming a combination of paralytic and furious rabies in the population leads to little quantitative change in the outbreak size.",
