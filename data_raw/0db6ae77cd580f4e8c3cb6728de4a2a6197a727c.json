            "text": "Bovine viral diarrhoea virus 1 (BVDV-1) is strongly associated with several important diseases of cattle, such as bovine respiratory disease, diarrhoea and haemoragic lesions. To date many subgenotypes have been reported for BVDV-1, currently ranging from subgenotype 1a to subgenotype 1u. While BVDV-1 has a world-wide distribution, the subgenotypes have a more restricted geographical distribution. As an example, BVDV-1 subgenotypes 1a and 1b are frequently detected in North America and Europe, while the subgenotype 1c is rarely detected. In contrast, BVDV-1 subgenotype 1c is by far the most commonly reported in Australia. Despite this, uneven distribution of the biological importance of the subgenotypes remains unclear. The aim of this study was to characterise the in vivo properties of five strains of BVDV-1 subgenotype 1c in cattle infection studies. No overt respiratory signs were reported in any of the infected cattle regardless of strain. Consistent with other subgenotypes, transient pyrexia and leukopenia were commonly identified, while thrombocytopenia was not. The quantity of virus detected in the nasal secretions of transiently infected animals suggested the likelihood of horizontal transmission was very low. Further studies are required to fully understand the variability and importance of the BVDV-1 subgenotype 1c.",

[1] recently reviewed the geographical distribution of the BVDV-1 subgenotypes. This analysis highlighted several unusual trends in the distribution of the BVDV-1 subgenotypes. As an example, the vast majority of genotyped strains identified in Australia have been classified within the subgenotype 1c [2, 3] . This is in contrast to the USA where the subgenotype 1b is dominant, but the subgenotype 1a is also frequently reported [4] . While in Europe the most common subgenotypes are 1a and 1b, also common are subgenotypes 1d, 1e, 1f and 1h [1] . However, the distribution of subgenotypes can vary between countries within Europe, for example subgenotype 1b and 1d were recently reported to be the most frequently identified subgenotypes in Germany [5] .",

The reason(s) for this increase are unclear. The cattle had been inducted into the containment facility seven days prior to the commencement of the trial and were therefore considered to have been well adapted/acclimatised to the environment. However, on Day 0 there were extra staff and equipment present while the cattle were being inoculated which included extra handling of the animals/cattle potentially contributing to this apparent increase. Due to this anomaly, the Day 1 temperatures were used as the reference point in the subsequent statistical comparisons within each treatment group.",

A summary of these results expressed as the threshold cycle (Ct) is shown in Table 1 . Overall, the distribution of positive nasal swabs was variable between and within the groups of cattle infected with the different strains of BVDV-1c.

Four of the five BVDV-1 infected groups exhibited significant leukopenia at Day 7 post-infection, three of which were biphasic (Figure 3 ). Only the group infected with VR1112 did not have detectable leukopenia. As VR1112 was the only cytopathic BVDV-1 strain included in the current study, further research is required to determine why this was the case. With respect to thrombocytopenia, only the cattle infected with strain NS155 had a significant loss of platelets that was detected 14 days after infection (Figure 7d ).

There is general agreement that there is either no or limited horizontal transmission of BVDV-1 between transiently infected cattle [15] [16] [17] . Sarrazin et al. [18] concluded that the field strains of BVDV-1 subgenotype 1a and 1b evaluated in their study were unlikely to play an important role in transmission. The detection of BVDV-1c in the nasal swabs of infected cattle the current study was sporadic and where detected the results suggested low quantities of virus ( Table 1 ). The range of Ct values from nasal swabs and serum samples in the current study were 31.6 to 39.0 and 32.0 to 39.0 respectively (Table 1) . Previous studies have evaluated the use of qPCR to differentiate persistently and transiently infected animals. Hanon et al. [19] estimated that a Ct value below 28.89 from a blood sample would identify all persistently infected animals, although this value was likely to misclassify some transiently infected animals as being persistently infected. While Hay et al. [20] estimated that a Ct value below 33 from serum was indicative of an animal being persistently infected with BVDV-1. The results of the current study, suggest a Ct value of 33 is too high for the differentiation of transiently and persistently infected animals based on a single sample. Noting that both prior studies utilised field samples for these estimates, thus direct comparison to the current study requires caution. The use of these estimates, would also require sample preparation and analyses to be comparable, particularly volume of sample extracted and subsequently used in the qPCR assay.",

Unchallenged animals could only be included in one of the containment rooms of the study for logistical reasons. Consequently, there were no uninfected animals penned with the animals infected with BVDV-1c strain AO554 or strain PI506, the viruses most consistently detected in nasal swabs and in the highest quantities (Table 1) . Collectively, these results suggest that minimal amounts of the challenge viruses were present in the nasal secretions of the infected animals and as a result the risk of virus transmission to other animals was very low for these BVDV-1c strains. Evans et al. [21] recently reported the absence of horizontal transmission from sheep experimentally infected with an Australian strain of BVDV-1 subgenotype 1c to sentinel sheep. The possibility of animals transiently infected with the BVDV-1c strains used in these studies producing and shedding sufficient quantities of virus to facilitate transmission if subjected to stressful conditions cannot be excluded. It has recently been demonstrated that the BVDV-1 strain H0916 (subgenotype 1a) was only transmitted to sentinel animals when the infected animals were immunosuppressed with dexamethasone [22] . If the low risk if transmission from transiently infected animals extends to all BVDV-1 subgenotype 1c it could have important implications in the implementation of effective BVDV-1 control plans with persistently infected animals as the sole source of virus [3, [23] [24] [25] . Further research is required to determine if any BVDV-1 subgenotype 1c strains replicate sufficiently in the nasal epithelia at levels to facilitate transmission to susceptible sentinel animals. The BVDV-1c strains PI506 and AO554 would be excellent candidate viruses for these studies.",

The number of cattle in this study was constrained by the capacity of the facility and need to evaluate the properties of several BVDV-1 subgenotype 1c strains. Another potential limitation of the current study was the viral inoculums used were quantified using RT-qPCR of the final cell culture supernatants. While previous studies have demonstrated correlations between RT-qPCR results and measures of in vitro infectivity such as plaque forming units and/or 50% cell culture infectious dose (TCID50) for other viruses, such relationships have not been reported for BVDV-1 as yet [27] [28] [29] [30] . Future studies which aim to directly compare the in vivo properties of the BVDV-1c strains used in the study would need to establish the relationship between RT-qPCR results and measures of in vitro infectivity to enable the standardisation of the challenge doses.",
