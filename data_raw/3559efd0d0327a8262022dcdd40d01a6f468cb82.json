            "text": "Cancer is one of the leading health concerns for human and animal health. Since the tumorigenesis process is not completely understood and it is known that some viruses can induce carcinogenesis, it is highly important to identify novel oncoviruses and extensively study underlying oncogenic mechanisms. Here, we investigated a case of diffuse histiocytic sarcoma in a 22 year old slow loris (Nycticebus coucang), using a broad spectrum virus discovery technique. A novel parvovirus was discovered and the phylogenetic analysis performed on its fully sequenced genome demonstrated that it represents the first member of a novel genus. The possible causative correlation between this virus and the malignancy was further investigated and 20 serum and 61 organ samples from 25 animals (N. coucang and N. pygmaeus) were screened for the novel virus but only samples collected from the originally infected animal were positive. The virus was present in all tested organs (intestine, liver, spleen, kidneys, and lungs) and in all banked serum samples collected up to 8 years before death. All attempts to identify a latent viral form (integrated or episomal) were unsuccessful and the increase of variation in the viral sequences during the years was consistent with absence of latency. Since it is well known that parvoviruses are dependent on cell division to successfully replicate, we hypothesized that the virus could have benefitted from the constantly dividing cancer cells and may not have been the cause of the histiocytic sarcoma. It is also possible to conjecture that the virus had a role in delaying the tumor progression and this report might bring new exciting opportunities in recognizing viruses to be used in cancer virotherapy.

Slow loris, listed as a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation and Nature (IUCN) (IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, available at: www. iucnredlist.org), are protected by law in Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia since their conservation status is a matter of concern. The biggest threat endangering those animals is the pet tradethey are the most commonly protected primates species sold as exotic pets in southeast Asia (Nekaris and Nijman, 2007) , but habitat loss and the fact they are killed as crop pests also jeopardize their survival (Nekaris and Streicher, 2008) . Because of these reasons a better understanding of the causes and the dynamics of diseases in N. coucang is advantageous for conservation attempts and captive management of this species (Remick et al., 2009) . In addition, valuable information can be gathered by the study of diseases in non-human primates, which in turn might be beneficial for human health.",

            "text": "We investigated a case of histiocytic sarcoma (HS) in a N. coucang identified at the Duke Lemur Center (DLC) in Durham, North Carolina. HS is a highly aggressive hematopoietic tumor defined as a malignant proliferation of cells showing morphological and immunophenotypic features of mature tissue histiocytes, cells of the innate immune system derived from bone marrow monocytes which differentiate into dendritic cells and tissue localized macrophages (Fulmer and Mauldin, 2007; Takahashi and Nakamura, 2013) . Tumors can be localized or disseminated with lymph nodes being the most common site of proliferation, followed by organs of the gastrointestinal tract, spleen, soft tissues, and skin (Takahashi and Nakamura, 2013) . It is a rare type of cancer in humans and cases have been reported in other species of animals, including chickens, dogs, cats, camels, macaques, and lemurs (Fulmer and Mauldin, 2007; Friedrichs and Young, 2008; Soshin et al., 2008; Molenaar et al., 2009; Remick et al., 2009; Takahashi and Nakamura, 2013) . Although the cause of HS is largely unknown, a viral etiology can be postulated as the existence of viruses involved in the development of hematopoietic cancers have been recognized, as in the case of Epstein Barr and human T-lymphotropic virus-induced human lymphomas and similar viruses in non-human primates (Miller et al., 1972; Donahue et al., 1992; Feichtinger et al., 1992; Vereide and Sugden, 2009; Qayyum and Choi, 2014) . Additionally it has been proven that the subgroup J avian leukosis virus is associated with the development of histiocytic sarcomatosis in chickens (Pandiri et al., 2009) and an association between persistent Epstein Barr virus infection and human HS has been reported (Kramer et al., 1985) . In this study we applied a sequence independent virus discovery technique combined with high throughput sequencing, VIDISCA-454 (De Vries et al., 2011) , to investigate the possible involvement of a previously unknown virus in the development of HS in a N. coucang. Several sequences with homology to parvoviral genes were identified indicating the presence of a novel parvovirus, whose genome was subsequently fully sequenced.",

According to the latest ICTV classification (2013) 8 genera are recognized within the subfamily Parvovirinae and 5 of them include viruses infecting primates (Cotmore et al., 2013; Cotmore and Tattersall, 2014) . Some parvoviruses classified within the genus Dependoparvovirus need the presence of a helper virus for a productive infection while viruses within other genera-the so called autonomous parvoviruses-are S phase-dependent: cells must undergo the S phase of growth for viral replication to occur (Berns, 1990) .",

Finally, parvovirus infections can also occur in asymptomatic individuals (Heegaard and Brown, 2002, p. 19; Lau et al., 2008; Clegg et al., 2012) . Although there is no formal proof of the existence of oncoviruses within this family, parvoviruses have been reported in literature to be associated with both solid and hematopoietic cancers (Fisgin et al., 2002; Li et al., 2012; Schildgen et al., 2013; Ibrahem et al., 2014) . However, since they rely on actively replicating cells, the increased presence of these viruses in individuals with cancer might also derive from the permissive nature of the tumor cells and some of these viruses have even proven to possess oncosuppressive effects on transformed cells (Berns, 1990; N\u00fcesch et al., 2012) .",

Afterwards 2 semi virus-specific nested amplifications were performed using one primer complementary to the virus (I_Buddha_R1 and I_Buddha_R2 for the 5 side; I_Buddha_F1 and I_Buddha_F2 for the 3 side) and one adaptor specific primer. In parallel, 5 \u03bcl of the cut DNA was subjected to an inactivation step for 20 min at 65 \u2022 C, followed by an overnight incubation at room temperature with 4 U of T4 DNA ligase to allow self-ligation and consequent circularization of the digested fragments (containing host sequences flanking the viral integrated DNA). Two specific inverted nested PCRs were used afterwards with primer pairs I_Buddha_F1/I_Buddha_R3 (TCCCGA CACAAATAATCGGACAACC) and I_Buddha_R1/I_Buddha_F3 (GACGTGCTTTGTTAGAATCTGTTCCTG) during the first step and I_Buddha_F2/I_Buddha_R4 (GAAATTTGAATTTCCATC TTAGCTTGAGTC) and I_Buddha_R2/I_Buddha_F4 (CAAACC CTGCAATGGTGTGTAGATG) during the second amplification step.",

Pancreatic and mediastinal lymph nodes were enlarged. Incidental lesions included a cystic mass in the right mammary gland and several small ulcers in the fundus of the stomach. Histologic examination of the spleen revealed a loss of normal architecture and an intense infiltration of neoplastic round to polygonal cells with moderate variation in cell and nuclear sizes (anisocytosis and anisokaryosis). Mitotic figures were common and multinucleate cells were occasionally seen. In the liver there were similar neoplastic cell aggregates surrounding the portal veins and the central veins, expanding the associated connective tissue. Ingested red blood cells (erythrophagocytosis) by neoplastic cells were also observed. Affected lymph nodes were characterized by a loss of normal architecture which was replaced by sheets of round to polygonal neoplastic cells similar to those found in the liver and spleen. These findings led to a diagnosis of disseminated histiocytic sarcoma.",

A total of 8003 sequence reads were obtained from the serum sample of the slow loris with HS and, among these, 5 sequences were identified with homology to different members of the Parvovirinae subfamily: 3 were identified with blastn (nucleotide identity: 62-70%) and 2 were only recognizable when identity search was performed at amino acid level (amino acid identity: 69-82%). Those recognized as viral fragments were used as template for primer design, and a combination of specific PCRs and genome walking techniques allowed retrieval of the almost complete genomic sequence of the virus (only part of the terminal repeats is lacking), which was tentatively named Slow Loris parvovirus 1 (Sl.L-PV-1). The genomic sequence allowed us to identify 3 further viral sequences which were not identifiable via identity search. In total 35 reads (0.44% of the total) belonged to the novel virus.",

Although the full process of tumorigenesis is not completely understood, it is known that accumulation of mutations in proto-oncogenes (such as those involved in the regulation or suppression of cell replication or tumors) or the effect of viral infections are involved in the progression (Bergers and Benjamin, 2003; McAloose and Newton, 2009 ). The number of recognized oncogenic viruses is increasing and nowadays several examples-both from the human and animal fields-are well characterized. The best known examples are the papillomaviruses causing cervical cancers in humans and different types of genital and cutaneous cancers in aquatic mammals, the hepadnaviruses causing hepatocellular carcinomas in humans and woodchucks, the Epstein Barr virus which is responsible for Burkitt's lymphoma or retroviruses which are at the origin of different types of malignancies in humans and other mammals (McAloose and Newton, 2009; Braoudaki and Tzortzatou-Stathopoulou, 2011; Butt and Miggin, 2012; Pannone et al., 2014) .

To investigate the possible viral involvement in the etiopathogenesis of the HS a broad spectrum virus discovery technique was employed, which is able to detect virtually any DNA or RNA viruses present in a clinical sample Oude Munnink et al., 2014) . A novel parvovirus was identified and molecularly fully characterized. The virus, which we named Slow Loris parvovirus 1 (Sl.L-PV-1), is around 5 kb The evolutionary history of Sl.L-PV-1 and the other members of the Parvovirinae subfamily was inferred using the Maximum Likelihood method (Felsenstein, 1981) based on the rtREV + Freq model (Dimmic et al., 2002) , identified as the best fitting model after the model test analysis, using MEGA6 (Tamura et al., 2013) . A distance Gamma distribution was used to model evolutionary rate differences among sites (+G, parameter = 2.5202). The rate variation model allowed for some sites to be evolutionarily invariable ([+I], 4.0614% sites). All positions with less than 95% site coverage were eliminated. The outcome of the bootstrap analysis (Felsenstein, 1985) is shown next to the branches.

The virus is phylogenetically located between the Dependoparvovirus and the Tetraparvovirus genera and, according to the classification rules defined by the ICTV (Cotmore et al., 2013) , is possibly the first member of a new genus. Thanks to the availability of a series of serum and organ samples collected over multiple years from slow loris with various diseases, we were able to screen different samples from a total of 25 individuals belonging to the N. coucang species and to the closest related species N. pygmaeus. No other animal was positive for the virus but, as expected, all organs collected during the necropsy were positive, as also reported for other parvoviruses (Meunier et al., 1985; Canuti et al., 2011) , and liver, spleen and kidneys were the organs where the virus reached the highest loads. The high viral concentrations found in these organs might reflect their elevated content of blood and blood cells. Besides, during the histological investigation the presence of basophilic inclusions in the renal tissue could be observed and these might represent parvoviral accumulations, similar to other reports for parvoviruses both in vivo (Hayes et al., 1979; Bestetti and Zwahlen, 1985; Porter et al., 1988; Decaro and Buonavoglia, 2012) and in vitro (Inaba et al., 1973; Oleksiewicz et al., 1996) . Surprisingly, all blood or serum samples collected during various years were positive at a rather constant load: we could detect viremia 8 years prior to the death of the animal. Given the involvement in the disease of white blood cells, a presumed condition of immunosuppression (caused either by the virus, the tumor, or by a combination of these 2 factors) can be postulated and might be a possible explanation for the fact that the virus was not cleared in 8 years. The supposed presence of immunodeficiency in the loris is supported by the detection of opportunistic infections, as the pathological tests reported the presence of Toxoplasma gondii infection.",

Histiocytes can refer to cells of either the macrophage or dendritic cell lineage as both arise from a common precursor cell. Neoplasms of histiocytes can arise from macrophages or one of two types of dendritic cells, Langerhans cells or interstitial dendritic cells. Langerhans cells are found within the epithelium and interstitial dendritic cells occupy a perivascular position in most tissues. Most forms of HS in animals arise as a malignant proliferation of interstitial dendritic cells, although there is one form, the hemophagocytic variant, that arises from macrophages (Fulmer and Mauldin, 2007; Takahashi and Nakamura, 2013; Moore, 2014) . There is no established classification scheme for HS in prosimians. We interpreted this tumor to have most likely arisen from interstitial dendritic cells. Some parvoviruses have proven tropism for cells of the hematopoietic system and the bone marrow providing the perfect condition for parvoviral replication, since a wide spectrum of cells at different dividing stages are present and parvoviruses need actively dividing cells (S phase) to replicate (Berns, 1990; Segovia et al., 1991) .

Although there is no formal proof of the existence of oncoparvoviruses, a causative link between the novel parvovirus and the HS could not be ruled out and therefore we investigated this hypothesis by exploring the eventual presence of latent forms of the virus. It is known that parvoviruses can establish latency by integrating in their hosts' genome (Schnepp et al., 2005; Kapoor et al., 2010) , and an integration event might cause the disruption of important onco-suppressors and be one of the initial causes for tumor development. Episomal DNA forms of various parvoviruses have recently been detected (Kapoor et al., 2011; Zhao et al., 2012) and parvoviral DNA was found to persist in different tissues (Schneider et al., 2008; Norja et al., 2012) , sometimes even in correlation with tumors (Li et al., 2012; Schildgen et al., 2013) , although without a causative link. Since it was impossible to predict in which way the virus would have persisted, this hypothesis was tested with 4 different methods aiming at identifying either potentially integrated viral DNA or circular covalently closed genome persisting in tissues as episomal forms. None of these approaches gave evidence for latent forms of the virus in any of the tested organs (including whole blood).",

However, these previously published rates have been estimated at an animal population level and not inter-host. In addition, fixation rates are connected to the transmission route of the virus: the sequences of the viral subpopulation which are transmitted to other individuals depend on the viral variation at the body site where the virus is shed. Since no other infected individual has been identified no postulations could be made on the transmission route of the virus and also no evolutionary rate estimations were possible. Nevertheless, the observed increase in sequence variation over time is inconsistent with a latency hypothesis: an integrated virus would evolve at the same evolutionary rate as its host and therefore, in case of integration, no variation would be observed.",

In fact it is known that certain viruses, called oncolytic viruses, have tropism for specific cancer cells and they can even lead to \"spontaneous regression\" of malignancies (Butt and Miggin, 2012; Sze et al., 2013) . This has been proven for the adeno-associated dependoparvovirus, although in an indirect way by enhancing adenoviral replication, and for a rodent parvovirus (N\u00fcesch et al., 2012; Laborda et al., 2013) . Future research will have to clarify whether this viral infection precedes tumor development and has a role in the oncogenic process, whether the virus simply benefits from the replication activity of the cancer cells or if the persistent viremia has no correlation with the HS. An answer to this question will be obtained by identifying the cell types where viral replication occurs after the detection of other infected loris and the constant monitoring of their physical condition and disease progression, and after the discovery of related viruses in other animals with similar malignancies. Although more studies are required to provide a conclusive answer, the infection with Sl.L-PV-1 might have delayed tumor progression. If this mechanism will be proven feasible new exciting possibilities might open for oncolytic parvovirotherapy (N\u00fcesch et al., 2012; Russell et al., 2012) .",

On the top the genome organization of the Sl.L-PV-1, on the bottom a representation of the predicted circular form. Red arrows represent primer binding sites. The use of reverse primer annealing at the beginning of NS1 and forward primers annealing at the end of VP1 allows the amplification the connecting genomic sequence. (B) Restriction enzyme based methods to detect integrated virus. The purple lines represent the host genomic sequence, the orange flashes indicate restriction enzyme sites and the orange boxed indicate artificially ligated adaptors. (B1) It is shown how, after overnight ligation of the digested DNA, the obtained fragment would self-ligate in a circular form and how a specific amplification would allow to amplify the integration site. (B2) It is shown how, after the ligation of specific adaptors to the obtained digested fragments, a semi specific PCR would allow the amplification of the integration site. (C) Method to detect the integrated virus based on repeated Alu sequences in the host genome.Purple boxes represent Alu sequences and red arrows represent primer binding sites. A comparison of the PCR results obtained amplifying the template with either a mixture of Alu binding primers and specific primers or Alu binding primers alone (negative control) would allow to amplify the integration site and determine which amplified fragment on gel corresponds to it.",
