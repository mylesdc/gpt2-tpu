Poor phenotyping of patients could be responsible for these disappointing results. Objectives: We hypothesized that ARDS patients can be clustered based on concentrations of plasma biomarkers and that such biological endophenotypes are association with clinical outcomes. Methods: Patients were screened for presence of ARDS. Unbiased cluster analysis of plasma concentrations of 20 biomarkers of inflammation, coagulation and endothelial activation at diagnosis of ARDS provided the endophenotypes. A decision tree was then used to predict cluster membership based on a more restricted set of biomarkers. The independent association of endophenotypes with ICU mortality was studied by multivariate logistic regression. Results: Three endophenotypes of ARDS were identified in 771 patients, which we named 'impassive' (N = 383), 'intermediate' (N = 224) and 'reactive' (N = 164), had mortality rates of 16 %, 26 % and 47 %, respectively (P < 0.01). Patients with a 'reactive' endophenotype were younger, had higher disease severity scores, more failing organs and more frequently had an indirect cause for ARDS than patients with an 'impassive' or 'intermediate' endophenotype. A 'reactive endophenotype' was independent from confounders associated with ICU mortality (OR 1.18 [95 % confidence interval: 1.09-1.28]). The concentration of interleukin 10, interleukin 8 and matrix metalloproteinase 8 were sufficient to predict the three endophenotypes. Conclusions: ARDS patients can be clustered into three biological endophenotypes, with different mortality rates. Three easy to measure biomarkers can be used to predict the endophenotype.",

Methods: Ancillary study of an international, multicenter, prospective cohort study (LUNG SAFE study [1] ). Patients meeting ARDS criteria (Berlin definition) on day 1 or 2 of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure onset were included in the study and categorized as having \"common\" risk factors or not. Results: Among the 2813 patients presenting ARDS in the first 48 h, 266 patients (9.4 %) had no ARDS risk factor identified at admission. Table 2 shows the final ARDS risk factor identified in patients with or without initial risk factor identified. The patients with no risk factor were older, had more frequent previously known chronic diseases and presented with less severe SOFA (8.7 \u00b1 3.9 vs 9.5 \u00b1 4.1, p < 0.001) and non-pulmonary (5.4 \u00b1 3.9 vs 6.3 \u00b1 4.1, p < 0.001) SOFA scores. ICU mortality was lower in ARDS patients with no risk factor than in others (28.6 % vs 34.9 %, p = 0.047), but in-hospital mortality was not (35.7 % vs 39.8 %, p = 0.20). The lack of ARDS risk factor was not associated with hospital mortality (adjusted OR = 0.86 [0.65-1.13], p = 0.29). In the subgroup of patients with no ARDS risk factor, age, SOFA, concomitant heart failure, and administration of steroids within 72 hours of ARDS onset were associated with hospital mortality (Table 3) .",

Future research aimed at studying management strategies in this subgroup of patients is warranted. Introduction: Prognostication in patients with ARDS improves when patients are reclassified after 24 hours using PaO2/FiO2 and PEEP cutoffs [1, 2] . It is uncertain if SpO2/FiO2 [3] could serve as a noninvasive and continuous surrogate of PaO2/FiO2 in prognostication of ARDS patients. We hypothesized that SpO2/FiO2, in combination with PEEP, is a reliable alternative for PaO2/FiO2 in prognostication of patients with moderate or severe ARDS. Objectives: To investigate whether classification at onset and reclassification after 24 hours using SpO2/FiO2 and PEEP cutoffs allow Introduction: The differential diagnosis of acute respiratory failure (ARF) in hospitalized patients is extensive and includes congestive heart failure, atelectasis, nosocomial pneumonia, ARDS and sepsis.

Methods: We enrolled consecutive patients with ARF who had been hospitalized >48 hrs and required prompt intubation in the ICUs of two Dutch university hospitals from 2011 to 2013. All patients fulfilled \u22652 SIRS criteria and/or had an early warning score >5. We excluded patients having an established diagnosis of infection >2 days before ICU admission as well as those with airway obstruction, circulatory arrest, and other pertinent reasons for mechanical ventilation. Blood samples were collected in PAXgene tubes for RNA extraction upon ICU admission and subsequently analyzed on an Applied Bio-systems\u00ae 7500 fast Dx Real-Time PCR instrument. Test results were categorized into 4 probability bands according to the manufacturer\u00b4s specification. Post-hoc infection likelihood of sepsis events within 2 days after ICU admission were based on physician assessments according to validated definitions [2] . Results: Sample preparation or processing issues resulted in exclusion of 14 patients, leaving 467/481 (97 %) for final analysis. Of these, 359 (77 %) subjects received antibiotics upon ICU admission, whereas therapy was initiated on a later date in an additional 14 (3 %) patients. Test results correlated with the probability of infection (p < 0.001) (Fig. 1) . Among the 415 patients in whom the test classified sepsis as 'likely\u00b4, the false positive rate decreased from 17/39 (44 %) to 36/195 (18 %) with higher probability bands. In the 52 patients in whom the test suggested infection to be unlikely we observed 8 cases of confirmed infection (false negative rate 15 %). As 135 patients could not be categorized with certainty (\"undetermined\") formal calculation of sensitivity and specificity was precluded. SeptiCyte test results were not affected by age, prior ICU stay, or immune deficiency. Higher scores of the test were indicative of increased severity of disease and mortality (Fig. 2) . Conclusions: SeptiCyte LAB is a biomarker assay which may aid clinicians in separating infectious from non-infectious causes of acute respiratory failure in hospitalized patients. In addition, the test may have prognostic utility. Introduction: Recently, the 3rd international consensus definitions for sepsis and septic shock have launched. According to the guideline, quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score 2 or more was recommended as clinical criteria to identify sepsis patients outside the ICU. Emergency department (ED) is the major source of ICU admission for sepsis. Therefore, an early recognition of sepsis is essential for the application of bundle therapy in time.",

However, criteria of qSOFA 2 or more can miss one third of mortality cases. Therefore, further assessment of organ failure by SOFA score would be helpful in ED patients with infection. Introduction: Previous studies have linked various cytokine levels and clinical traits to organ failure and mortality, but few have used this data to cluster patients and classify distinct endotypes Objectives: To determine whether clinical biomarkers can define endotypes of sepsis with different rates of 14-day mortality and organ failure Methods: The multicenter, randomized Protocol-Based Care for Early Septic Shock (ProCESS) trial enrolled 1341 patients with septic shock and showed a 16.3 % 14-day mortality. We used hierarchical biclustering as an approach to cluster patients using cytokine levels, their early trends and other baseline clinical variables as features. Cytokine levels measured at 0, 6, and 24 hours were included. Variables with high coefficients of variation and significant univariate logistic regression p-values with organ failure outcomes were included as candidate clustering variables. Patient variables were standardized and differences in cluster mortality were examined using the logrank test. Only patients with complete variable profiles were included in the heat map analysis. After clustering was performed, the association between these clusters, organ failure, defined as a SOFA score of 2 or greater, and 14-day mortality was examined.",

Patient with HC further segregated in those with elevated lactate (HCL) (figure), which often had higher than average platelet count. Although HC was associated with generally higher MOF and mortality, HCL portended a particularly poor prognosis. As the dotted line is moved down the top dendrogram, additional subgroups appear, such as patients with acute kidney injury (high blood urea nitrogen (BUN) with low urine output), hyperglycemia, and patients with high systolic blood pressure, high temperature, and high heart rate.

Methods: Patients admitted to the intensive care unit were monitored with invasive arterial blood pressure, a calibrated LiDCOplus (LiDCO, UK). Mean systemic filling pressure (Pmsf-arm) was measured using the stop-flow arterial-venous equilibrium method [1] . A fluid challenge of 4 -5 mL/kg of Hartmann\u00b4s solution was performed over 5 minutes. Csys was calculated as \u0394volume/\u0394Pmsf-arm. V s was calculated multiplying C sys times Pmsf-arm at the end of the fluid challenge. Sepsis was defined by the presence of at least 2 systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria and strong suspicion or evidence of infection. Data are presented as median and interquartile range, and compared using Mann-Whitney U test. p values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. There is no evidence of differences in V s (U = 195, p = .46) between septic and post-cardiac surgical patients. Conclusion: C sys is twice greater in septic patients compared to cardiac surgical patients but V s is similar between these two groups. Introduction: Adequate empiric antimicrobial therapy is crucial in terms of survival in patients with severe infections.

The following variables were recorded: demographic characteristics, underlying diseases, severity of illness at admission (APACHE II and SOFA scores), adequacy of empirical antimicrobial therapy, SOFA score at the day of culture results, worst SOFA score in the ICU, development of nosocomial infection, leght of stay and mortality. We also analyzed clinical characteristics, sepsis source, presence of bacteremia and type of pathogen. We used Student\u00b4s T test, Mann-Whitney U test or Chi square (as appropriate) to compare the variables. A multivariate analysis was also performed to control for confounding variables in order to asses the factors associated with no de-escalation. Results : Eight hundred and fifty two patients were enrolled and de escalation therapy was performed on two hundred and sixty seven (31,3 %).

In 2013, the \"Zero Resistance\" (RZ) program was launched in Spain, to help prevent the emergence of MRB in critically ill patients. One of its recommendations is to complete a checklist upon patient admission in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) to identify those patients at high risk for colonization or infection by MRB. AIMS. To analyse the effectiveness of the checklist for risk factors (RF) proposed by the RZ project as a way of MRB early detection. Methods: A prospective study from March/2014 to January/2016. All patients admitted to a polyvalent ICU of a general hospital were submitted to the checklist proposed, with the application of contact precaution (CP) strategies for patients with RF for MRB. Bacteriologic swabs (nasal, pharyngeal, axillary and rectal) were routinely performed on all patients admitted, besides diagnostic cultures when necessary. Furthermore, we analysed other pathological variables and comorbidities (diabetes, renal failure, immunosuppression state, neoplasia, cirrhosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease -COPD-, organ transplantation, malnutrition or type of admission to ICU -urgent or programmed). Univariate and multivariate analysis of RF for MRB with binary logistic regression were performed. Statistical significance was set at CI 95 %. Results : 1651 patients were admitted. 532 (32,2 %) met some CP criteria. In 136 (8,2 %) were detected one or more MRB, 87 of these (64 %) presented CP criteria according to the checklist. 37 met 1 criteria, 31 met 2 criteria and 19 met 3 or more criteria with accumulation of risk (p < 0,001). In 49 (36 %) MRB carriers it was not identified any of the RF from the checklist. Tables 13 and 14 show risk factors and comorbidities that were significant as added risk for MRB. Conclusion: After comparing to previous analysis, it was seen that, increasing the sample size, almost all RF included in the RZ checklist were predictors of MRB. Despite this, it could not detect 36 % of the patients infected or colonized by MRB. Because of that, we should consider other factors to predict the presence of a MRB on admitted patients to ICU. Patients were randomly assigned to sleep with or without earplugs and a facemask. A polysomnography was performed on the first day and night following inclusion. The primary end point was the proportion of sleep stage 3 + 4. Secondary end points were other descriptors of sleep and major outcome variables. Results: In the intervention group, 33 % of patients did not wear earplugs all night long. The proportion of sleep stage 3 + 4 was 11 % in the control group and 13 [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] % in the protective group (p = 0.72). Other descriptors of sleep were not different between the two groups except the number of long awaking that was lower in the protective group than in the control group (21 [19-26] vs. 31 , p = 0.02). There was no difference among the two groups in terms of sleep quality, occurrence of a delirium, ICU length of stay and mortality, anxiety and depression on ICU discharge and day-90 and the incidence of post-traumatic stress disorder. Conclusion: In ICU patients, earplugs and eye mask are not well accepted by patients, do not increase the proportion of sleep stage 3 + 4 but decrease the number of prolonged awakenings. They had no impact on the outcome. Grant acknowledgement French Ministry of Health (PHRC) Note: This abstract has been previously published and is available at [1] .

The mechanisms underlying these effects merit further investigation Introduction: Quantitative measurement of microcirculatory and of tissue oxygen concentration is of prime importance in experimental research. Non-invasive time resolved quenching of Palladium-porphyrin phosphorescence injected into experimental animals has given much fundamental insight in mechanisms of oxygen transport to tissue in health and models of disease. Until now, most of the phosphorimeters used flash lamps as a light excitation source. However, a major drawback of flash lamps is the plasma glow that persists for tens of microseconds after the primary discharge. When a flash lamp produces a pulse, a tail remains causing unwanted further excitation to the initial pulse of the phosphor in a time dependent manner. This generates a complex excitation pulse pattern, which if not taken into account using deconvolution analysis, can lead to inaccurate PO 2 readings. Objectives: To design and calibrate a new LED-based phosphorimeter (LED-P) that address previous drawbacks of flash-lamp phosphorimeter (FL-P). We validate the LED-P with in vitro and vivo experimental studies Methods: We designed the LED-P using 4 LEDs of different colours (blue, green, yellow, red), each with a narrow-band wavelength (20 nm), providing excitation light pulses within the range of several phosphorescent dyes often use in experimental studies. We calibrated in vitro the device using the Palladium-porphyrin phosphorescent dye at different temperatures ( 19, 25, 28, 32, 34, 37 and 39\u00b0C) and adjusted pH (6.8, 7.0, 7.2, 7.4, 7.6) with an enzymatic reaction producing step by step decrease of oxygen content and analysing the decay times of phosphorescence (\u03c4). The oxygen content was measured with a solid-state polymer optical fiber sensor oxygen optode (POF, Oxy-Mini, World Precision Instruments, USA). In vivo calibration was performed in a rat model by exposing the kidney. We ventilated the animal in different hypoxic conditions (15, 7 and 4 % O 2 ) and performed renal ischemia/reperfusion injury by clamping the renal artery.",

In vivo, the LED-P showed similar kidney microvascular PO 2 compared to previously published works, in hypoxia or ischemia conditions. Conclusions: This new LED-P provides minimally-invasive, accurate and reliable measurements of microvascular PO 2 in the kidney, without the need of complex mathematical deconvolution of the light emission signal coming from the tissue. LEDs are much cheaper, with a smaller sized and simpler electronics, are more energy efficient, have a longer lifetime. This LED-P provides the ability to choose which LED to enable/disable to excite different phosphorescent dyes within the same measurement. Correspondence: Z. Uz -Academic Medical Centre Amsterdam, Translational Physiology, Amsterdam, Netherlands Introduction: Systemic inflammatory response is a complication that occurs frequently in cardiac surgery patients with extracorporeal circulation (EC). Leucocytosis is a common outcome after cardiac surgery due to surgical trauma, blood contact to nonendothelial surfaces in the EC, endotoxaemia and ischemia reperfusion injury due to aortic cross clamping and release. This induces an activation of complement factors, coagulation pathways and cellular immune response. Leucocyte (Lc) adhesion to the endothelial followed by diapedesis is a key component of the inflammatory response. In the context of cardiac surgery therefore Lc adhesion is expected especially following release of cross clamp. Currently there is no direct method of identifying this behavor of Lc in the microcirculation. This study describes the use of Cytocam IDF imaging (handheld video microscope) as a tool to identify and quantify the behavior of Lc in the sublingual microcirculation of patients during surgery. Objectives: The introduction and application of an algorithm as a method to count non-invasively Lc in the microcirculation. Methods: In this prospective observational study videos of the sublingual microcirculation during, coronary artery bypass surgery with EC, were recorded with the use of the CytoCam (Braedius Medical, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Two time points were measured, baseline (T0) after induction of anesthesia before CPB, second time point (T1) after release cross clamp.25 patients were recruited, of which 10 were included in this study based on evaluation of the sublingual video images using a quality criteria in order to identify at least one post capillary venule (PCV) where focus of the red blood cells is primarily important. Patients in this group received blood transfusions during surgery.3 clips for each time point with duration of 4 sec (25 frames/sec) in different spots were captured. Identifying a PCV to count the activated Lc: sticking and rolling Lc on the wall of the PCV. Converting these clips into movies with a lower frame rate in order to match the velocity of the leukocytes to that of the frame speed allowed the movement of the rbc's to look unclear. Selecting 2-5 PCV good quality for each clip ( at least one PCV).",

Introduction: Delirium in critically ill patients is associated with increased mortality and long-term cognitive decline. The recent Pain, Agitation and Delirium (PAD) guidelines include recommendations for delirium screening, prevention and management, which may help to improve clinical outcomes and reduce delirium burden.

Methods: A prospective multicenter before-after study was conducted in six ICUs in the Netherlands between March 2012 and April 2015. The intervention consisted of a two-phase multifaceted tailored implementation of the PAD guidelines. Multiple implementation strategies were applied to change clinical practice (Table 18) .

Kraj\u010dov\u00e1 Introduction: Propofol infusion syndrome is a rare, but serious adverse effect of a commonly used drug with a very high mortality rate (\u02c350 %) [1] . The symptoms can occur in various combinations and include: unexplained metabolic acidosis, arrhythmia, Brugada like pattern on electrocardiograph (elevated ST-segment and coved-T wave), cardiac and/or renal failure, rhabdomyolysis, hyperkalaemia, hepatomegaly and hyperlipidaemia. The mechanism of the syndrome is still unknown: experimental studies performed on animal models and clinical features of the syndrome are suggestive of its mitochondrial origin. Objectives: We hypothesize that propofol decreases respiratory chain capacity, inhibits fatty acid oxidation and induces inner mitochondrial membrane uncoupling in a dose-dependent manner. Our study aims to test this hypothesis in vitro by exposing human skeletal muscle-derived cells to a range of propofol concentrations for 4 days.",

After 96 hours of exposure, mitochondrial metabolism was assessed by extracellular flux analysis (Seahorse Biosciences). Oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was measured at baseline and after addition of ATPase inhibitor, mitochondrial uncoupler and complex III inhibitor. Injection of these agents enables to calculate baseline OCR, ATP turnover rate, proton leak through inner mitochondrial membrane and respiratory chain capacity (uncoupled respiration). The capacity of fatty acid oxidation was measured as etomoxir-inhibitable OCR after adding of uncoupler and palmitate. Values presented in Table 20 are expressed as % of baseline OCR. Results: In human skeletal muscle cells exposed to propofol, respiratory chain capacity was decreased and uncoupling of inner mitochondrial membrane was increased. The most significant result was propofol-induced inhibition of fatty acid oxidation to 15 %, respectively 11 % of baseline values (see Table 20 ). Data are presented as median (interquartile range). Statistically significant results are signed as * if p-value < 0.05, ** p-value < 0.001.

            "text": "References Introduction: Anaemia affects 60-80 % of patients admitted to critical care (ICU). 1 Allogeneic red blood cell (RBC) transfusions remain the mainstay of treatment for anaemia but are associated with risks 1 and are costly. Some patients may have true iron deficiency and could benefit from iron replacement, reducing the need for transfusions. However, diagnosing iron deficiency in ICU patients is difficult due to the unreliability of serum ferritin in the context of co-existing inflammation. Objectives: To assess the efficacy and safety of iron supplementation, by any route, in anaemic patients in adult ICUs. Methods: We searched multiple databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE) for RCTs comparing iron by any route with placebo/no iron. Two investigators independently assessed eligibility and extracted data. The primary outcomes were RBC transfusion requirement, mean number of transfused RBCs and mean haemoglobin (Hb) concentration. Secondary outcomes included mortality, infection, length of hospital stay, health-related quality of life (QoL), mean difference in iron biomarkers (e.g. ferritin) and adverse events. Outcomes were assessed at two time points: (i) short-term -up to 10 days and (ii) mid-term -last measured time point in hospital or end of the trial. Risk of study bias was assessed using Cochrane methodology. Metaanalyses were performed in RevMan v5.3 using random effects models. Continuous variables were reported as mean difference (MD) with 95 % confidence interval (CI); dichotomous variables were reported as relative risk (RR) with 95 % CI. Results: Five trials consisting of 613 patients were included for meta-analysis. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 Four trials were set in surgical ICUs and one in a mixed ICU. Only one trial was rated at low risk of bias in all domains. There was variation in dosage regimes, from 3x/weekly administration of intravenous iron to daily oral iron for up to 30 days post discharge. Results are shown in Table 21 . No trials reported on QoL. Conclusions: Iron supplementation does not reduce RBC transfusion requirements in adult ICU patients. Larger, well-designed trials are needed to investigate the benefits and risks of iron, optimal dosing regimes and strategies to identify patients likely to benefit together with patient-focused outcomes such as QoL after discharge. Introduction: Intensive care is lifesaving, but associated with the development of physical, mental and cognitive problems in survivors.",

Data were prospectively collected through the intervention and were audio-recordings of three follow-up consultations (at 3, 5 and 10 months), patient photographs during ICU-stay, and reflection sheets. First consultation focused on patient's narratives of ICU supported by photographs to aid memory. Second and third consultations focused on patient-centred dialogs of what was most important by guided by patients reflection sheets. Thematic analysis and narrative theory were used to explore the mechanisms of recovery after intensive care (1) . Results : The basic narrative of recovery was \"toward a trajectory of new orientation\". The narrative at 3 months described mortal illness in ICU (Being at Death's door), the narrative at 5 months described ongoing fear of relapse (Still not out of the Woods), and the narrative at 10 months had three potential outcomes: downhill (detour on the road), steady-state (end of the road), or progress (The Road to Recovery).

            "text": "Conclusions: This study provides a contemporary understanding of the process of intensive care recovery. Recovery evolves through narratives of mortal danger, fear of relapse and different types of progress toward a new orientation in life. Nurse-led follow-up consultations help patients to obtain a sense of coherence during the first year after critical illness. These findings enable healthcare professionals to understand what patients experience during stages of recovery by offering dialogue and supporting the construction of a coherent illness narrative with ICU staff and close relatives. This shared understanding is important to improve nursing and healthcare professionals in the assessment of long-term outcome, and management of patients after intensive care. Protective skin products are developed, but it is uncertain whether the use of such products is not associated with a higher rate of dressing disruption, which is also a risk factor for CLABSI [1] . On the other hand, a transparent dressing with a chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) containing gel pad at the insertion site prevents CLABSI. Objectives: To compare transparent catheter dressings either with or without the application of a protective skin ointment for skin integrity, dressings disruptions and dwell time; in addition, we assessed rates of catheter colonization and CLABSI in transparent dressing either with or without a CHG-pad. Methods: We conducted a monocentric, open-label, randomized, controlled trial (Aug.-Dec./2014) to compare transparent CHG-dressings with use of a skin ointment creating a polymer protective film (Cavi-lon\u00ae) (intervention group) with standard transparent dressings without the skin product (control group). Standard catheter care included 0.5 % CHG in 70 % ethanol for skin preparation before CVC insertion and maximal sterile barriers. Dressings were changed /7 days, or in case of full dressing disruption (revealing the insertion site) or if moisture was present under the dressing. Results: Sixty patients with a central venous catheter (CVC) were enrolled accounting for 60 CVCs and a total of 533 CVC days. Study groups did not differ in sex, age, insertion site and the number of CVC lumens, comorbidities, severity of condition, length of hospital stay before enrollment, or concomitant therapy. Dressing dwell time was higher in the intervention group: 6.3 (SD 1.5) vs 2.0 (SD 1.1) days (p < 0.001). The Table describes reasons for dressing changes and skin integrity after dressing removal. CVC dwell time did not differ between the groups: 9.7 (SD 3.5) days in the intervention group and 8 (SD 3.9) days in the control group (p > 0.05). Rates of CVC colonization were not different (37.9/1000 CVC days in the intervention group vs. 37.0/1000 CVC days in the control arm [relative risk 1.22, 95 % confidence interval 0.59-2.5]) as were CLABSI rates (6.9/1000 vs 20.6/1000 CVC days [relative risk 0.4, 95 % confidence interval, 0.08-1.9]). Conclusions: The use of a skin ointment creating a polymer protective film beneath transparent dressings results in longer dressing dwell times and less skin breakdown. The application of the skin product does not alter the risk of infection, at least not when used combined with a CHG-impregnated dressing. Introduction: More ICU programs are emerging to promote psychological recovery after a stay in intensive care unit (ICU) (1) . In the Scandinavian countries, patients' discharge rehabilitation plan usually includes physical training, but seldom psychological rehabilitation. To address this gap, we developed a post-ICU recovery program to improve psychological health after intensive care. We hypothesized that a nurse-led recovery program, that helped to construct a coherent illness narrative including person-centered communication, would improve health-related quality of life (HRQOL), sense of coherence (SOC), reduce symptoms of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress (PTSD) in the first year after ICU discharge. Objectives: To investigate the effectiveness of a post-ICU recovery program compared to standard care in improving quality of life in the first year after ICU. Methods: We randomly assigned 386 patients adult (\u226518 years) survivors after receiving mechanical ventilation (\u226548 hours) to standard care (SC) plus a recovery program or SC alone after discharge from intensive care. It was a nurse-led intervention consisted of patient photographs, three follow-up consultations and reflection sheets. Results: Primary outcome was HRQOL, and secondary outcomes were SOC, anxiety, depression, PTSD assessed at 3 and 12 months after intensive care discharge using t-tests. We supplemented outcomes with rehabilitation services within the first year. At 12 months after intensive care the HRQOL scores were unchanged by the intervention (mean difference in the Mental Component Summary score, 0.9 [95 % CI, \u22121.5 to 3.3; P =0.47]; and in the Physical Component Summary score, 1.1 [95 % CI, \u22121.3 to 3.5; P = 0.37]). No differences were found for the total score on self-reported SOC, anxiety, depression, and PTSD. The intervention showed a potential effectiveness on the rate of anxiety, when a cutoff score \u226511 was applied, in the complete analysis at 3 months. However, all patients received high level of rehabilitation services as SC within the first year after intensive care.",

Introduction: Enabling clinicians to prospectively identify patients who will later become unstable would enable targeting resources to patients most in need as well as potential application of preventive care. Objectives: To determine the incremental contribution of information progressively available within the first 4 hours of (SDU) admission to improve models forecasting later development of cardiorespiratory instability (CRI), including a novel CRI relative risk score. those never displaying CRI (controls, n = 1053) were identified. We computed a minute-by-minute integrated CRI risk score based on the method described in [1] , using features computed from VS data streams during trailing 15 minute rolling windows and a trained random forest machine learning model. We then computed for each patient a mean risk score aggregated from the risk scores during first 4 hours of SDU stay. Next we built a logistic regression model to forecast whether or not there will be a CRI event in the future. To mimic the temporal availability of data following patient admission, we first entered demographics available at patient admission (age, gender, Charlson Comorbidity Index score) into the model, and then the initial VS (5-minute average of continuous VS data accrued from minutes 10 to 15 after admission), and finally the relative risk score derived in the first 4 hours. We assessed the predictive contribution of information from these 3 progressively accrued categories (demographics, initial VS, 4-hr risk score) by the Area Under Receiver Operating Curve (AUC) in a 10-fold cross validation experiment setup.",

When looking at overall perceptions, there were for all seven factors significant differences (p < 0.001) between nurses and physicians, with physicians consistently perceiving the EOL-DM climate as more positive as nurses. The largest differences were found in regard to physician leadership (median factor scores -0.09 for nurses and 0.61 for physicians, respectively), interdisciplinary reflection (medians -0.03 and 0.51) and not avoiding EOL decisions (medians -0.07 and 0.37). When looking at differences within the 4 types of EOL-DM, the same general pattern was found, and all differences were statistically significant (p < 0.001). The differences were largest in the two lowest types of EOL-DM: average without nurses and poor EOL-DM climate. Head nurses generally had a more positive perception of EOL-DM climate compared to other nurses, and senior physicians had a more positive perception than junior physicians. When comparing nurses (without including head nurses) and junior physicians, the physicians still had a significantly higher perception of EOL-DM, except for \"Mutual respect within the interdisciplinary team\" (p = 0.26). Physicians having a more positive perception of EOL-DM compared to nurses were found within all 13 participating countries and within the individual ICU's. Introduction: There is increasing recognition of the need for comprehensive expertise in the management of EOLC in the ICU. However there appear to be many controversies between professionals regarding optimal provision. Objectives: As a component of a local, on-going quality improvement process in this area, we performed a survey of nurses' perceptions of aids and obstacles to the optimal provision of EoLC. Methods: We modified a previously validated survey tool 1 and anglicised the language. Nurses were asked to rate both the size and frequency of 20 possible obstacles and 14 possible aids to providing EoLC using a 6 point Likert scale (0-5). The survey was distributed to 120 nursing staff on one adult general critical care unit in March 2015.",

Despite having a poor unit design and lack of privacy, nurses feel they can provide a dignified death and feel that multidisciplinary agreement is an important part of this process. Mean length of stay (LOS) was prolonged and level of organ support was high. These results are summarised in Table 25. LOT was instigated in 9 (11.5 %) patients. Age and APACHE II scores were similar in patients with LOT and those with none. Frail patients had a higher LOS and received more organ support compared to non-frail patients. The proportion of patients with LOT remained low despite an increasing LOS. Communication between team members was sub-standard with 33 % of bedside nurses and 44 % of residents being unaware of these decisions. The re-audit after intervention demonstrated an increase in patients receiving LOT, with a higher proportion of frail patients being represented. These patients also received less organ support and LOT was instigated earlier in their stay. Awareness regarding these decisions amongst all staff improved to 100 %. Feedback regarding the communication tools was excellent. Introduction: Previous studies showed that low nurse staffing levels were associated with poor outcomes and increased occurrence of adverse events. However, national data are scarce regarding the relationship between the nurse staffing ratio and pediatric patient outcomes.

Introduction: Critically ill patients exhibit a high degree of vitamin C deficiency at ICU admission and plasma concentrations decrease even more during the following days [1, 2] . High intravenous (iv) doses of vitamin C are required to increase plasma concentrations to normal and supra-normal ranges [2] , but the optimal dosage regime in this population remains unclear. Prolonged vitamin C administration may be associated with oxalate kidney stone formation, but the effect of short-term high-dose supplementation on urinary oxalate excretion is unknown. Study design and objectives: We conducted a prospective randomized controlled trial to determine the pharmacokinetics of four high dose regimes of iv Vitamin C in critically ill patients and to measure oxalate excretion.

Conclusion: Normal vitamin C plasma levels are attained with either 1 g iv twice daily or 2 g as continuous infusion. A bolus infusion is needed for rapid achievement of high-normal plasma concentrations. Both high-dose regimes produce supra-normal plasma concentrations. With continuous infusion, urinary vitamin C loss was lower and a higher proportion remained in the body. The urinary excretion of oxalic acid increased with higher vitamin C doses. However, at the time of cortisol retesting, patients with lower cortisol levels had significantly longer length of ICU stay (p = 0.038). Time interval between two cortisol sampling was (median, IQR) 12 days. Time interval between higher and lower cortisol groups did not reach statistical significance. When glucocorticoid therapy was begun in the lower cortisol group, vasopressors were weaned within 48 hours; vasopressor weaning was longer and varied in higher cortisol group. Conclusions: Adrenal response is a dynamic process. During the course of critical illness, as with other organs, adrenal failure may develop. With these findings, adrenal exhaustion seems to be a complication of prolonged critical illness. We suggest prolonged vasopressor dependency should prompt a search for adrenal exhaustion, even if initial cortisol testing results are within normal limits.

Nevertheless it is necessary to postulate an enhanced degradation rate or increased volume of distribution, to explain this finding. Objectives: We explored 3 different techniques to assess albumin turnover and degradation. Methods: Healthy volunteers (n = 10) were studied over 42 days. The first day, albumin synthesis rate was measured in the postabsorptive state by the in vivo incorporation of d5-phenylalanine, and a dose of 125 I-albumin was given to assess albumin degradation. Degradation rate was measured and calculated by the decay in radioactivity in 2 ways; in urine collected over 24 hours at 3 separate days, and in plasma repeatedly over 42 days. Results: Basal albumin synthesis rate was 118 \u00b1 16 mg/kg/day, equal to degradation rate in steady state. Catabolic rate by urine sampling was 142 \u00b1 31 mg/kg/day (P = 0.022 v. basal), and by plasma 177 \u00b1 29 mg/kg/day (P = 0.001 v. basal). Conclusions: The differences in calculated turnover rates may correspond to effects of feeding or differences in half-lives between exogenous and endogenous albumin. The exact explanation needs to be further investigated. Introduction: A low plasma glutamine concentration at ICU admittance is associated with an unfavorable outcome. A number of studies have shown beneficial effects of exogenous glutamine supplementation to unselected critically ill patients. However, recently harm is reported when pharmacological doses of exogenous glutamine is given to underfed unselected ICU patients with \u2265 2 organ failures. The mechanism behind this finding is not understood and more specifically the reason for the low levels is not known. Objectives: The relation between plasma glutamine concentration and glutamine production rates. Methods: Critically ill patients (n = 17) with normal or low plasma glutamine concentration were studied. Glutamine rate of appearance reflection glutamine production rates was determined employing a bolus dose technique, and the decay curves were fitted into a single pool or a 2-pool model. Results: Glutamine rate of appearance was in the range 5 -15 umol/ kg/min in ICU patients with plasma concentrations in the range300-700 umol/L. There was a statistical significant (P < 0.05) relation, but the coefficient of determination was low R 2 = 0.15. Also the correlation between the 1-pool and 2-pool models was statistically significant (P < 0.01), but the coefficient of determination intermediary R 2 = 0.60. Conclusions: To understand the results of recent glutamine supplementation studies in the critically ill, the relevance of plasma glutamine levels must be under stood. In healthy volunteers there is a high concordance between 1-pool and 2-pool models to calculate the rate of appearance. The lower agreement in ICU patients indicates that a more extensive modeling may be necessary. Introduction: The prevalence of malnutrition in ICU has been estimated at up to 40 % with the majority of critically ill patients requiring nutritional support. Traditional teaching suggests that early enteral feeding in mechanically ventilated septic patients is superior to parenteral feeding due to a lower complication rate but neither form of support is without risk. Objectives: In this study, we compared the outcomes in mechanically ventilated septic ICU patients receiving enteral versus parenteral nutrition.",

Demographics, severity of illness scores (APACHE and SOFA), BMI and MUST were measured upon admission. Daily nutrition requirements were calculated for each patient. Patients were randomized to enteral(EN) or parenteral nutrition(PN) group within 48 hours of intubation and admission to the unit. Duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU and hospital length of stay (LOS), and mortality rates were recorded. Results: A total of 148 patients (76 men) mechanically ventilated septic patients having a mean(\u00b1SD) age of 69.6 \u00b1 19.4 years were studied. All patients met the consensus criteria for sepsis. Baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups. APACHE II and SOFA at study entry were 24 \u00b1 5 and 8 \u00b1 3 respectively. The mean(\u00b1SD) BMI was \u2248 21.5 \u00b1 3.4 kg/m 2 . Seventy seven (52,02 %) patients received EN, and sixty nine (47,26 %) received PN. There was no difference between the two groups for age, sex, BMI, and scores. ICU and hospital LOS were similar for both groups. ICU mortality rate was 29.4 % for PN group vs. 27.2 % for EN group indicating no significant difference. Hospital mortality was similar for both groups as well. In the PN fed group however, duration of mechanical ventilation was longer (p = .018), but the feeding goal was attained earlier (p = .009). Conclusions: In mechanically ventilated septic ICU patients the ICU LOS and the hospital LOS, as well as the ICU and hospital mortality rates of patients receiving PN are not significantly different than those in patients receiving EN. Furthermore, feeding goals can be attained much easier by PN. Duration of mechanical ventilation however appears to be longer in patients receiving PN.",

Sungur 1 , T. Ziegler 4 , M. Guven 1 Introduction: Adipokine hormones play an important role in regulation of insulin metabolism, body fat distribution and regulation of appetite and satiety. Some adipokine hormones have effects on inflammation and insulin resistance but the relation between these hormones and critical illness and the route of nutrition is not known. Objectives: The aim of this study to determine association between nutrition route and adipokine hormones levels in critically ill patients Methods: This study was performed prospectively in Medical and Surgical ICU at Erciyes University. Patients expected to stay in ICU at least 72 hours and received either parenteral or enteral nutrition included into the study. Results: Total of 26 patients were included into the study and 17 of them were male (65 %). The mean age was 62.8 \u00b1 18.2 years. Total of 14 patients (54 %) were fed via enteral route and 12 patients (46 %) were received parenteral nutrition. The mean APACHE II score was 22.7 \u00b1 7.1. Resistin levels were lower in enteral nutrition group at 24th (p = 0.015) and 72nd hours (p = 0.014) compared to parenteral nutrition group. Baseline, 24.th hours and 72.th hours GLP-1 levels were found to be higher in enteral nutrition group than parenteral nutrition group (p = 0.031, p = 0.006 and p = 0.001 respectively). Adiponectin levels were significantly higher in enteral nutrition group compared to parenteral nutrition group at 72th hour (p = 0.014). Conclusions: Our study showed that enteral nutrition helped to reverse abnormal process in critically ill patients with increasing adiponectin and GLP-1 levels and decreasing resistin levels. Introduction: A switch from carbohydrate to fat utilization is a hallmark of systemic inflammation. While this adaptive response occurs quickly and allows animals to survive under restricted food supply conditions, it will markedly affect cell metabolism. Objectives: To elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying the substrate switch from carbohydrate to fat in different organs, we studied early alterations in (i) phosphorylation of enzymes involved in energy metabolism: AMP kinase (AMPK, thr172), acetylCoA carboxylase (ACC ser179), pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDK ser293), hormone sensitive lipase (HSL ser563); and (ii) expression of mitochondrial uncoupling proteins 2 and 3 in soleus and gastrocnemius skeletal muscle, liver, kidney and heart in sham-operated and septic rats at 6 h in our wellcharacterized 72 h fluid-resuscitated rat model of faecal peritonitis Methods: Awake, instrumented yet fully mobile male Wistar rats (325 \u00b1 15 g) received an i.p. injection of 4 \u03bcl/g faecal slurry. Fluid resuscitation (50:50 mix of 5 % glucose/Hartmann\u00b4s; 10 ml/kg/h) was commenced at 2 h. Control animals were treated identically except for slurry injection. At 6 h, an echo-measured heart rate cut-off of 460 bpm was used to classify animals into predicted survivors SR or non-survivors NSR.(1) Animals were killed and organs were immediately collected into liquid nitrogen. Alterations in protein phosphorylation and expression were studied by Western blot. Normalization was performed to loading control: actin or PFK. Results were presented as mean +/-SE, analyzed using Student's t-test and considered statistically significant when p < 0.05. Results: At 6 h post-sepsis no differences were seen in renal and hepatic phosphorylation of AMPK, ACC, PDH and HSL between sham and septic animals. While cardiac ACC phosphorylation was strongly increased in septic rats, AMPK phosphorylation did not differ, suggesting that ACC phosphorylation was mediated not by AMPK but rather via the glucagon-PKA pathway. The biggest changes were observed in skeletal muscle. AMPK phosphorylation was increased in gastrocnemius and even more so in soleus in septic rats but this was not accompanied by a corresponding increase in ACC phosphorylation. In both muscles PDH phosphorylation markedly increased while PDH fell, suggesting a fall in pyruvate oxidative decarboxylation and glucose usage as a fuel. HSL phosphorylation was strongly increased in soleus in non-survivors. UCP2 and UCP3 levels were not altered in any organ. Table 31 . Conclusions: 1) Each organ has its own program for the switch from carbohydrate to fat metabolism. 2) The consequences of these changes on the development of organ dysfunction merit further investigation, as this may lead to novel directed therapeutics.",

            "text": "Introduction: Albeit practical implementation remains a concern, indirect calorimetry (IC) is the first choice technique for estimating energy requirements in critically ill patients. Methods: In our adult mainly surgical intensive care unit (ICU) we retrospectively assessed in 25 patients the utility and practical aspects of estimating the daily energy requirements. We determined energy requirements by IC (Quark, COSMED) and compared the estimates with those calculated by measuring VCO 2 alone using a ventilator (Evita XL; Draeger) or using formulas based on body mass of body mass index. Results: Our study population was found to have an average body mass of 69.7 kg and according to IC and energy requirement of 1987 kcal/day on average. No correlation (R 2 = 6E-05) was found when estimates of IC were compared to estimates based on body mass alone. However using an adjusted mass (based on hight and an assumed body mass index of 23) correlation improved (R 2 = 0.3358). VCO 2 based estimation of energy requirement only weakly correlated with IC (R 2 = 0.414). Weak correlation is explained by assuming a fixed respiratory coefficient for ventilator based energy estimates as well as by imperfect correlation of VCO 2 estimates reported by calorimeter and ventilator (R 2 = 0.6189) Conclusions: Body parameters such as hight or mass aren't suited to predict the patient's energy needs. Albeit promising and simple, estimation of energy requirement based on ventilator derived VCO 2 also fails precision. Whether technical improvements on how ventilators calculate VCO2 can render them more suited in daily praxis will have to be determined in future studies. Introduction: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is an advanced treatment to support the critically ill patients with cardiac and/or with severe respiratory failure. It is suggested that ECMO patients are at risk of splanchnic ischemia and thus, enteral feeding is poorly tolerated needing nasojejunal feeding and is potentially unsafe. This study aims to investigate the nutritional adequacy of this patient group. criteria were: patients with H1N1 confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction who were \u226518 years of age. Exclusion criteria were: unconfirmed cases, patients not seen in the hospital and with missing case notes. Differences in clinical parameters between patients discharged within 24 hours of medical assessment and those admitted to hospital were analysed. A chest X-ray scoring system was also employed to assess the ability of radiographic findings to predict likelihood of discharge. Results: Eighty-six patients were eligible for the study. 17 patients were discharged early and 69 patients were admitted to hospital. P/F ratio and CRP predicted discharge with area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of 0.788 (CI 0.681-0.894) and 0.763 (CI 0.6377-0.889) respectively, which was higher than triage and bedside tools. The chest radiograph scoring tool did not predict patient discharge (p = 0.191-0.999), but demonstrated very good inter-rater reliability (Cohen's kappa statistic >0.8).",

All patients had an improvement in the degree of acidosis with mean hydrogen ion concentration falling from 72.65 nM (pH 7.14) to 46.59 nM (pH 7.33) over the first 24 hours, with a mean PaCO2 fall from 13.5 kPa to 8.7 kPa. Peak airway pressures dropped from 31.5 cmH2O to 29.1 cmH2O over the same time period. There were no direct complications of therapy. 3 patients survived to hospital discharge. Discussion: Using ECCOR locally in patients with severe ARDS it is possible to lower the hydrogen ion concentration improving the degree of acidosis. This corresponds to a trend in lower peak airway pressures, which in this small case series does not reach statistical significance.

During the operation, pneumoperitoneum needs to be created for better visualization of operating fields. This is followed by decreased urine output and resulted in acute kidney injury. However, we do not know the effect of pneumoperitoneum and factors inducing acute kidney injury (AKI). Objectives: We aimed to 1) show the incidence of AKI in patients undergone laparoscopic abdominal surgery and 2) propose a set of risk factors associated with the development of AKI following laparoscopic abdominal surgery Methods: All patients underwent laparoscopic abdominal surgery at King Chulalongkorn Memorial hospital, Bangkok, Thailand were prospectively enrolled between 2012 and 2013 (n = 64). Two were excluded due to preexisting chronic kidney disease and NSAIDs use in previous 1 week. Baseline characteristics, laboratory results, and introperative data were prospectively recorded in case record forms. Urine neutrophil gelatinaseassociated lipokalin (NGAL) was measured as the surrogate marker. AKI was identified by KDIGO criteria. Characteristics were analyzed by student\u00b4s t-test and nonparametric test. Factors associated with AKI were identified using the logistic regression and the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC). Results: Of the 62 patients receiving laparoscopic abdominal surgery, 12(19 %) developed postoperative AKI. The mean age, initial blood pressure, and initial glomerular filtration rate were not different between AKI and non-AKI groups. The peak serum creatinine was seen at 24 hours postoperatively. AKI patients had significantly increased urine NGAL level at 24 hours postoperatively compared to non-AKI (p = 0.01). Mean operative time, inflation time, and exposure index, defined by the product of inflation time and intra-abdominal pressure were significantly higher in AKI compared with non-AKI patients (p < 0.05 for all). Duration of intraoperative hypotension, amount of blood loss and intravenous fluid were not different between groups. By multivariate analysis, exposure index was significantly associated with postoperative AKI, with adjusted odds ratio (95 % CI) of 1.59 (1.02-2.38). AUCs of inflation time, operation time, and exposure index were 0.68, 0.67, and 0.67, respectively (p < 0.05).",

Method: Retrospective cohort study of adult ICU-patients from two university hospitals in Denmark admitted between Jan 1st 2012 and Dec 31st 2013. All cases of AKI were identified according to the creatinine criteria of the KDIGO definition. Fluid data was missing in 13 patients (1.5 %), and these were excluded from the analysis. The association between cumulative fluid balance and the risk of death/renal recovery at day 28 was estimated with joint modeling techniques [3] . The cumulative fluid balance was dichotomized with cutoffs at 5 % and 10 % of admission body weight at any day during the first five days of admission. The longitudinal submodel was fitted using mixed effects logistic regression, and the survival submodel was a Cox model adjusted for age, gender, severity of disease (SAPS II, KDIGO grade) and use of life support (norepinephrine, mechanical ventilation and dialysis). The study was approved by the national board of health, who waived the need for consent. Results: We screened 4087 patients and identified 864 with AKI ( Fig. 37 ) of whom 461 and 255 developed fluid overload above respectively 5 % and 10 % of bodywieght (BW) during their first 5 days in ICU (Fig. 38) . At day 28, 514 of the AKI patients had renal recovery and 282 had died (Table 37) . Fluid overload >10 % BW at any day during the first 5 days in ICU was associated with a hazard ratio (HR) for death of 1.08 (p < 0.001); for > 5 % BW fluid overload the HR for death was 1.07 (p < 0.001). In contrast, there was no association between fluid accumulation and renal recovery. Conclusion: In our cohort of 864 patients with AKI, 255 developed fluid overload (10 % BW) during the first 5 days in ICU. Fluid overload, even at 5 % BW, was associated with increased mortality after adjusting for risk factors, but fluid overload was not associated with renal recovery.",

The tissue samples were evaluated by histology (T6h,T30d) by HE and PAS staining. Results and conclusions: SDF at T6h showed broadly distributed microcirculation and tissue dysfunction at both groups (Fig. 39 ). The outlining of tubules became blurred by their enlargement, with compression of tubular lumen and of the peritubular microvessels, suggesting an obstructive phenomenon by cellular edema. Histology. After 6 hours of sepsis, animals treated with aggressive fluid infusionshowed less peritubular congestion, preserved mesangial space and lower areas with hyaline degenerations and better preservation of the tubular lumen compared to sepsis without aggressive overhydrating. PAS staining showed a very slight hyaline degeneration, better preservation of tissue architecture, lower occurrence of cellular death, suggesting that the aggressive fluid therapy in the early stage of sepsis minimizes the severity of vascular and tissue injury in the kidney.

Introduction: Evidence has established that there is strong link with Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) and progression to chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end stage renal failure (ESRF) [1] . After AKI, 9 % have permenant loss of kidney function and 9-13 % are dialysis dependent post hospital discharge [2] . Renal followup is recommended for patients who have had AKI whilst critically ill [3] . Objectives: To assess whether patients that received renal replacement therapy (RRT) in ICU had a nephrology follow up, and determine if there was a need for the service.To assess if there were any difference in mortality between the groups. Methods: We performed a retrospective longitudinal cohort study analysis of all patients that received RRT after an AKI in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde Hospitals over one year. Renal function at 3-6 months pre-admission and post discharge were examined by comparing urea, creatinine and eGFR values. Nephrology follow up status was also investigated. We excluded patients that had renal baselines out with the 3-6 month period.Paired t-test analysis was used to analyze preadmission vs post discharge renal baselines in normal eGFR patients Introduction The risk of chronic kidney disease increases with the time of evolution of type 2 diabetes and chronic metabolic control. In people over 40 years occur a progressive loss of glomerular filtration rate corresponding to 1 mL per year. This is associated with progressive deterioration of renal tissue replacement by fibrous tissue, which involves progressive glomeruroesclerosis, tubulointerstitial fibrosis and nephrosclerosis.",

The study was part of the P-INFECT-study investigating the patient and family experience of NSTI from different perspectives. Patient and family involvement was applied in constructing the study. Conclusions NSTI is generally unknown to patient and family and comes as a shock. Patients in our sample received rapid treatment in the ICU and the worst consequences were avoided. Nevertheless, close family, including spouses were faced with the sudden risk of disfigurement or death in the patient as they coped with ambivalence of being several places at once, lack of sleep and lack of certainty.

Results From 937 charts from adult patients that were accessible in full, 81 patients with severe sepsis/septic shock. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values are shown in Tab. 1. Overall, explicit coding strategies are limited in their sensitivity, but have a better positive prediction than implicit coding strategies. Identification strategies based on clinical and/ or microbiological sepsis codes risk underestimating true sepsis incidences by 1.4-2.2-fold, whereas indirect coding strategies carry the risk of overestimation. In explicitly identified cases which were coded false positive (n = 13), 23 % organ dysfunction was not caused by infection (23 %), infection or organ dysfunction were not documented in the chart (54 %) or patients did not meet two or more SIRS criteria (23 %). For the implicit approach, false-positives (n = 90) resulted from concurrence of infection and organ dysfunction without causality (51 %) or that infection or organ dysfunctions were not identifiable retrospectively by chart review (40 %). 9 % did not meet the SIRS criteria. In implicitly false-negatives (n = 21), organ dysfunction, infection or both were not coded in 67 %, 14 % and 17 % of cases, respectively. Conclusions Existing ICD coding strategies differ in their accuracy in identifying septic patients in hospital discharge databases and thus may over-or underestimate true sepsis incidences.

A pretest questionnaire was applied to all participating nurses to assess initial knowledge of concurrent cleaning. After training a new test was applied and the participating nurse was deemed approved if answers correctly at least 80 % of the questions. Microbiological burden was evaluated before training and 30 days by a quantitative ATP essay. The ICU bed was considered clean if quantitative assay resulted was less or equal to 150 URL. If quantitative essay result was higher than 150 URL the ICU bed was considered contaminated and a new cleaning process initiated. Each microbiological burden evaluation included three different moments, as follows: (1) before patient admission, (2) six hours after admission, and (3) 24 hours after admission.",

Introduction Plasmapheresis (therapeutic plasma exchange -TPE) is an established treatment option in the therapy of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS). 3 randomized controlled trials established its efficiency between 1985 and 1995. So far the recommended number of TPE sessions is four, but the optimum TPE protocol (number of exchanges and volumes exchanged) remains to be established (1) . Also the role of TPE in patients with GBS who fail to respond to therapy and who relapse after therapy remains to be determined (1). TPE is expected to be a logical therapeutic option in diseases in which pathogenesis is linked with a biological substance with a relatively high molecular weight, a slow rate of formation and a distribution in the vascular space. TPE is used in the treatment of diseases in which the pathogenesis is associated with abnormal circulating pathogenic autoantibodies (2) . The role of antibodies against gangliosides in GBS is established only in Miller Fisher variant, in other types of GBS the role of antibodies still remains to be determined. But as the optimum TPE protocol (especially in patients who fail to respond to therapy and in patiens who relapse after standard TPE protocol) has not been determined, it is a question, whether in these patients the role of antibodies should not be considered and the number of TPE sessions should not be individualized and adapted to these results.",

Serum potassium was recorded at baseline and 6 hourly until 72 hours or infusion stopped. Following cessation, potassium levels were recorded 6 hourly for 60 hours unless death occurred. Potassium replacement during the 72 hours and the use of insulin were noted. Complications following infusion were reviewed. Results In total 50 patients were prescribed thiopentone. Eight received a bolus and three had other indications. A further 3 patients had a duration under 6 hours and were excluded. Thirty-six patients were reviewed with 1 patient dying during infusion. Patient characteristics are shown in Table 44 . Hypokalaemia (potassium < 3.5) developed in 25 patients (69.4 %) during infusion with the mean lowest at 12 hours (Fig. 49 ). Subsequently 11 (31.4 %) patients developed hyperkalaemia (potassium > 5.5), mean peak 12 hours after. Three patients died due to cardiac arrest with hyperkalaemia following infusion and 2 patients required filtration to control potassium. Insulin use, duration of infusion, weight, potassium replacement or presence of hypokalaemia had no statistical significance relating to loss of regulation (Tables 45 and 46) . Conclusions After fatalities attributed to hyperkalaemia post barbiturate coma, we aimed to assess the occurrence and any contributing factor. A case series 2 highlighted the potassium replacement as a significant variable. This was not shown here, possibly due to restrictive replacement in patients during infusion. We did find an earlier fall in potassium following the start of infusion and an earlier peak after cessation.

Analysis on GOS the surviving patients showed no significant differences. Introduction Post-craniotomy pain has been reported to be moderate to severe. Management of post-craniotomy pain is inadequate in many cases, yet is limited by the side effects of opioids. Codeine has been the mainstay of treatment of post-craniotomy pain in our institution, due to its safer side effect profile when compared to more potent opioids. However, its effectiveness may be limited due to the need to be de-methylated before it has any analgesic effect and this process is subject to inter-individual variability.",

Introduction Ranolazine (Rn), a drug used for the treatment of chronic angina pectoris (1), has been proposed for the management of epileptic disorders for its ability to decrease neuronal excitability by blocking late inward sodium current (late INa) in the central nervous system (2, 3) . We recently demonstrated in primary cultures that Rn could act as a neuroprotective drug by promoting astrocyte viability, preventing necrosis and apoptosis, inhibiting inflammatory phenomena and inducing antiinflammatory and antioxidant agents (4). Amyloid-\u03b2 peptide 1-42 (A\u03b2 1-42 ), a protein involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer\u00b4s disease, produce glial activation, inflammatory response and oxidative stress that can lead to neuronal death (5) .",

Introduction The systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) can lead to pronounced tissue damage and is a frequent cause of multi-organ failure and mortality in Intensive Care units 1 . SIRS can be elicited by a variety of insults, such as sepsis, trauma, and major surgery, and no specific therapy is currently in routine use. EA-230 is a newly developed synthetic linear tetrapeptide derived from the \u03b2human chorionic gonadotropin hormone (\u03b2-hCG), which has shown promising anti-inflammatory and tissue-protective effects in animal studies 2,3 . Objectives To investigate the tolerability, safety and immunomodulatory effects of EA-230 in humans. Methods We conducted a double blind, placebo controlled, doseescalating randomized clinical trial in 60 healthy volunteers. The study was carried out in two phases. In the first phase (n = 24), safety and tolerability was established for escalating doses of EA-230 (30, 90, and 180 mg/kg). In the second phase (n = 36), the same doses were used to assess the effects of EA-230 on systemic inflammation during experimental human endotoxemia. At t = 0 hours, 2 ng/kg E. Coli endotoxin was administered i.v. followed by a 2-hour continuous i.v. infusion of EA-230 or placebo. Levels of circulating cytokines and adhesion molecules as well as body temperature and flu-like symptoms were assessed. Furthermore, effects on renal function were investigated using plasma clearance of iohexol. Results EA-230 was well tolerated and showed an excellent safety profile. Treatment with the highest dose of EA-230, but not with lower doses, resulted in a significant attenuation of the endotoxininduced increase in plasma levels of IL-6, IL-8, IL-1RA, MCP-1, MIP-1\u03b1, and MIP-1\u03b2 (IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1 shown in Fig. 50a, b, and c) , and the adhesion molecule VCAM-1 (Fig. 50d) . Furthermore, the highest dose of EA-230 reduced fever and flu-like symptoms (Fig. 51) . Endotoxemia resulted in a marked increase in GFR, but no differences between groups were observed. Conclusion Administration of EA-230 is safe and results in attenuation of the systemic inflammatory response in humans. These promising results pave the way for a phase IIb clinical trial to assess the anti-inflammatory and tissue-protective effects of EA-230 in patients.",

Objectives The aim of this study was to identify factors for predicting prognosis in patients with severe sepsis (SS) or septic shock (SSh) according to quartiles of immunoglobulin G (IgG) concentrations Methods It is a cohort study of 133 critically ill adults admitted in a polivalent Intensive Care Unit of a University Hospital. Demographic data, clinical parameters and IgG levels were determinated within 24 hours from SS or SSh onset, defined according to Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) criteria. The patients were divided into four groups (quartiles) based on the 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles of their initial level of IgG. We tested for differences in baseline characteristics by IgG interval using a Kruskal-Wallis test for continuous data or a Chi Square test for categorical data and reported the median and interquartile ranges. A logistic regression model was adjusted for potential confounders as age, APACHE II score, SOFA score, number of organ failure (NOF) and presence of shock on admission. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 15.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL, USA) Results We analyzed 133 consecutive episodes of SS (16.5 %) or ShS (83.5 %) admitted in the ICU. The median age of the study sample was 62 (inter-quartile range: 48.5-70.5) years old; male: 62.4 %. The main sources of infection were: respiratory tract 36.8 % and intraabdomen 28.6 % and 69.9 % had medical pathology. 28-day mortality was 21.8 %. Quartiles of serum IgG concentration were: quartile 1 (Q1: 607 mg/dL or less), quartile 2 (Q2: 607-792 mg/dL), quartile 3 (Q3: 792.1-976 mg/dL) and quartile 4 (Q4: 976.1 mg/dL or greater). The median IgG concentrations of each quartile were 525 mg/dL in Q1, 695 mg/dL in Q2, 881 mg/dL in Q3 and 1340 mg/dL in Q4, (p < 0.001). The differences between these quartiles shown no significant difference in APACHE II, SOFA score, number of organ failure (NOF) neither 28 day-mortality. Surprisingly the patients in Q4 had the higher 28-day mortality (30.3 %) compared with the other quartiles (OR 0.998, CI 0.996 to 1, P = 0.072), following by patients in Q1 (21.1 %). Conclusions Our studied did not show prognostic value with low levels of serum IgG within 24 hours from SS or SSh onset. High levels of IgG within 24 hours from SS or SSh may be a risk factor for increase 28 day-mortality in septic patients; should be further investigated in this field. Introduction T lymphocytes play fundamental roles in the immunological response to sepsis. \u03b3\u03b4 T cells are a new subset of T lymphocytes that represent a small population of immune cells, exhibit features of both innate and adaptive immunity, and play an indispensable role in host defense, immune surveillance and homeostasis. Recent studies found massive loss of gamma delta T (\u03b3\u03b4T) cells in patients with sepsis. However, little did we know about their function changes and role in such a pathological status. Objectives This study was designed to evaluate the phenotype and function of peripheral \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock, and its association with prognosis. Methods This prospective observational study was conducted in three ICUs of a university hospital. A total of 107 patients, consecutively admitted and diagnosed with severe sepsis or septic shock (excluding previous immunosuppression) and 30 healthy controls, were enrolled. Surface markers (CD69, NKG2D, PD-1) and intracellular cytokines (IFN-\u03b3, IL-17, IL-10, TGF-\u03b2) of \u03b3\u03b4T cells isolated from peripheral blood were analyzed by flow cytometry. Results were also correlated with clinical outcome. Results Septic patients displayed decreased percentage of \u03b3\u03b4T cells and NKG2D expression, and increased CD69, pro-(IFN-\u03b3, IL-17) and antiinflammatory (IL-10, TGF-\u03b2) intracellular cytokines as compared to healthy controls. After stimulation of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in vitro by pamidronate (PAM) or phorbol-myristate acetate (PMA) plus ionomycin, both CD69 expression and IFN-\u03b3 secretion significantly reduced in septic patients as compared to healthy controls, 19.041 \u00b1 11.74 % vs. 52.47 \u00b1 19.84 % and 23.66 \u00b1 17.37 % vs. 70.47 \u00b1 16.41 %, respectively, p < 0.001. Importantly, these decreased expressions were more pronounced in nonsurvivors as compared to survivors. Using multi-regression logistic method to adjust factors that impacted patient outcome, IFN-\u03b3 secretion after stimulation and SOFA score were independent risk factors associated with patient death, OR: 0.937 (95 % CI: 0.893-0.982) and 1.248 (95 % CI: 1.056-1.474), respectively, p < 0.05. Conclusions Our results showed pronounced changes in \u03b3\u03b4T cell phenotype and function in septic patients. This finding provides novel insights into the role of \u03b3\u03b4T cells in sepsis. Introduction Hallmarks for sepsis severity include loss of vascular and immunological homeostasis. NO is an important vasodilatator and loss of NO may contribute to impaired microcirculation. Moreover, NO is involved in protein modification, regulation of transcription factors and production of superoxide anions. L-Arginine (L-Arg) is substrate of NO producing synthase (NOS) and its homolog, Lhomoarginine (h-Arg), is the competitive substrate. Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) is an endogenous NOS inhibitor (see reference).",

Introduction It is well-known that bacterial sepsis induces an immunosuppressed state, impairing the host's ability to clear the primary infection and increasing vulnerability for secondary bacterial or fungal infections [1] . However, whether bacterial sepsis affects the subsequent response to influenza infection is unknown, as is the safety of administration of live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIVs) in immunosuppressed patients. Experimental human endotoxemia induces systemic inflammation that mimics bacterial sepsis and subsequent development of immune suppresion [2] .",

Introduction Levels of analgesia under sedation are traditionally evaluated by clinical signs such as an increase in heart rate (HR), blood pressure, lacrimation and defensive movements. However, the patients' analgesic level under sedation is hard to determine in the intensive care setting, as these clinical signs are not specific. Recently, the assessment of the anti-/ nociception balance by different monitoring devices was described. The Analgesia Nociception Index (ANI) (MetroDoloris, Lille, France) is derived from HR variability and provides an index between 0 (nociception) and 100 (analgesia). The Surgical Pleth Index (SPI) (GE Healthcare, Helsinki, Finland) derived from HR and pulse wave amplitude measured with photoplethysmography displays the parasympathetic tone as index between 0 and 100.

Sevoflurane was administered with an expired fraction target of 2 %. Plasma concentrations of sevoflurane, the hexafluoroisopropanolol (HFIP) and free fluoride ions were recorded at different times. The Kinetic Pro (Wgroupe, France) was used for pharmacokinetic analysis. Introduction Sleep and wakefulness are strong interconnected stages regulated by complex mechanism in the basal brain. Disturbed sleep impairs function of nervous and immune systems and metabolism. There has been much focus on sleep in ICU during the recent years: disturbed sleep causes prolonged stay in ICU, increased morbidity, including delirium, and mortality. Several studies reveal pathological sleep patterns in critically ill patients. Critically ill patients in the busy environment of an ICU are exposed to a range of different disturbances such as the high level of noise and light, procedures, mechanical ventilation, medication, and the critical illness itself.Polysomnography (PSG) has never been used in studies on critically ill patients in an ICU to test whether environmental changes improve sleep in this patient group.",

Conclusions Both NRS and NSCR are reliable indicators of pain, and the correspondence between NSCR and actual pain stimulation moreover validates the use of NSCR as a measure of pain in patients. However, NRS is also sensitive to the contextual setting and anxiety, which NSCR is not. A discussion, whether to administer analgesic or ataractic drugs during the perioperative stage when NRS is moderate or higher, is warranted. Introduction According to the recent guideline (2013), nonbenzodiazepine drugs, like propofol, are preferred to benzodiazepines in sedation of ICU patients undergoing mechanical ventilation due to decreased duration of mechanical ventilation, shortened ICU stay, lower risk of patients death and decreased costs of treatment.

Variation of each hemodynamic values after VE (\u0394(VE)) and after PLR (\u0394(PLR)) was performed.

Background Patients in critical care settings are often at risk of developing hypotension, which can lead to poor outcomes. To address this need for early detection of hypotensive events, we have developed a hypotension probability indicator (HPI\u2122). A hypotensive event was defined by any time period where MAP < 65 mmHg. After training the HPI\u2122 model on 3,000 ICU and surgical patients, we tested it on an independent data set and demonstrated sensitivity and specificity > 80 % for detection of an event respectively at 5, 10, and 15 minutes prior to its start. To give further clinical value to the HPI\u2122 as a decision support index, there is a need for understanding the underlying reasons for a patient trending towards hypotension. In this study, we evaluate the use of stroke volume (SV), cardiac output (CO), stroke volume variation (SVV), dynamic elastance (Ea dyn), systemic vascular resistances (SVR), and dp/dt to classify patients into 4 prescriptive hypotensive groups: 1) Decreased preload, 2) Decreased afterload, 3) Decreased contractility, and 4) Uncertain.",

The microcirculation was examined in a large animal model of THS, in order to investigate the effects of microcirculatory dysfunction during resuscitation. Methods Baseline standard microcirculatory parameters were obtained for 22 large white pigs using sublingual Incident Dark Field (IDF) video-microscopy. All animals were subjected to a standardized hind-limb injury followed by a controlled haemorrhage of approximately 35 % of blood volume (shock phase). This was followed by 60 min of fluid resuscitation with either 0.9 % saline or component blood products and a target SBP of 80 mmHg (early resuscitation phase). All animals were then given blood products to a target SBP of 110 mmHg for 120 min (mid resuscitation phase), and a further 100 min (late resuscitation phase). IDF readings were obtained at the mid point of each of these phases. Cardiac output was measured using a pulmonary artery catheter.

Conclusions Early changes in microvascular perfusion are key determinants in subsequent tissue perfusion following fluid resuscitation, and appear unrelated to pressure based parameters. Choice of initial resuscitation fluid appears to have little impact on microcirculatory perfusion during resuscitation from traumatic haemorrhagic shock. Microcirculatory parameters may be more reliable markers of physiological insult than global haemodynamic parameters, and are potential targets for goal-directed resuscitation. Table 58 . Radial arterial pressure waveforms were recorded with a FloTrac\u2122 sensor (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA). The waveforms were passed to the algorithm to calculate the hypotension probability. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to assess algorithm performance.",

Methods Participants were recruited from faculty and students at the University of Leicester. Room temperature was confirmed between 19-21oC throughout data acquisition and participants were allowed a period of acclimatization prior to measurement. Baseline blood pressure was measured in the left forearm. The right forearm was then placed on a bench with a blood pressure cuff placed around it. A FLIR T650sc thermal imaging camera was placed at a distance of 1 meter from the participant. Thermal video recording was commenced and the blood pressure cuff was inflated to 50 mmHg above the previously measured systolic pressure for a total of 3 minutes. Recording continued for 5 minutes following deflation of the cuff. Average palm temperatures were measured using a 100 x 100 pixel sample. Data were extracted using FLIR Tools + software and analyzed using Microsoft Excel and R-Studio. Conclusion From these results it can be concluded that the rate of reheating per second measured using infrared thermography following a vascular occlusion test in healthy volunteers is 0.015 + / -0.009\u00b0C .s -1 . It is our hypothesis that this gradient will be prolonged in patients with sepsis. If demonstrated to be true, this technique could be used as a non-invasive diagnostic technique in sepsis.",

It has the ability to diagnose structural and dynamic problems, is non-invasive, and inter-user variability is limited. Rigorous training and CPD is essential in order to prevent mismanagement based on incorrect findings. In the UK the Intensive Care Society administers FICE accreditation with this becoming compulsory for critical care trainees in future. Methods Every patient who undergoes diagnostic FICE has the result documented in their notes and in an audit folder. This follows a standardised \"sticker\". All results documented in this folder, ranging between December 2014 and January 2015, were collated and analysed in a spreadsheet. The aim was to assess how FICE impacts on care at a district general critical care unit. Results 57 patients underwent documented FICE 37 % of these scans occurred during the weekend Indications for scan: Haemodynamic Instability (5/57), Haemodynamic Instability -Post Operative (9/57), PE (1/57), Post Cardiac Arrest (8) Conclusion It is clear that FICE echo has had a significant impact on the management strategies of a significant number of patients, however the impact of this on morbidity/mortality is impossible to assess. It is also interesting to see that a disproportionate number of scans were performed during the weekend, when formal cardiac investigations aren't always as available as during the week. Documentation was generally good but some gaps in documentation were found and require improvement. We suggest that this data, although limited in number, supports funding of expanded FICE training and availability at district general critical care units.",

Experimental models of myocardial infarction and reperfusion involve temporary ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD).

The mean number of ICU admissions with sCAP per year was inversely correlated with hospital mortality. Many other parameters that are often claimed to be associated with better or worse outcome (like differences in antibiotic therapy) did not correlate with outcome.

Thirteen (65 %) had comorbidities, including respiratory disease 5 (25 %), morbid obesity 3 (15 %) and malignancy or immunosuppression 3 (15 %). One was pregnant (5 %) and 8 (40 %) had a smoking history. Nine (45 %) were retrieved from outside the Ireland East Hospital Group. The mean APACHE (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation) II Score and the mean SOFA (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment) score, on day one, were 17.85 \u00b1 5.78 and 9.85 \u00b1 3.33 respectively.

Conclusion Seasonal influenza is a major public health concern. It is associated with severe morbidity, resulting in significant economic consequences, as well as a substantial burden on tertiary ICUs. In keeping with national trends, the predominant circulating virus was influenza A(H1N1) and secondary coinfection was common.

In additional analysis we also adjusted for education and lifestyle factors. Recent observational studies showed that obese critically-ill patients have an unexpectedly reduced risk of death, having low mortality rate in the course of septic shock, as well. This situation is described as \"obesity paradox\".

Their length of stay is thought to quantify the difficulties in prognostication of survival in this cohort of patients, particularly when it comes to the secondary brain injury. Introduction Quantity of blood loss during liver resection is known to be a predictor for poor clinical outcome (1). One generally used approach for minimization of blood loss is to decrease central venous pressure (CVP) (2) . The rationale for this concept is that low CVP is supposed to reduce hepatic blood congestion. Objectives In order to assess blood congestion of the liver we aimed to evaluate the influence of a positive-end-expiratory-pressure (PEEP) and positioning of the patient on CVP and venous hepatic blood flow in patients undergoing liver resection. Further, we analyzed correlation between CVP and venous hepatic blood flow parameters. , p = 0,021 respectively) whereas no significant changes of flow velocity of the portal vein occurred in any of the maneuvers. No correlations between CVP and diameters or flow velocities of the right hepatic and the portal vein were found. Conclusions Changes of central venous pressure due to changes of PEEP and positioning were not correlated with changes of venous liver blood flow. Therefore, those strategies aiming for low central venous pressure maneuvers in liver resection are not supported by these results.",

Significant risk factors in the univariate analysis were selected for the predictive model (Table 102) .

At higher flow rates (Table 107) : PaO 2 improved (p < 0.001) while pH and PaCO 2 didn't vary; end-expiratory lung volume (\u0394EELV) increased (p < 0.05) and peak expiratory flow (PEF) decreased (<0.05) suggesting positive expiratory pressure effect by increased expiratory resistance and/or improved respiratory system compliance; respiratory rate (RR) decreased (p < 0.001) and tidal volume (Vt) didn't change (p > 0.05), anyway yielding decreased minute ventilation (MV) (p < 0.01) and corrected minute ventilation (MV corr = MV*PaCO 2 /40 mmHg) (p < 0.01), indicating enhanced CO 2 removal; finally, esophageal pressure swing (\u0394Pes) and pressure-time product (PTPes) decreased (p < 0.01 for both). AIC for linear correlation with flow rates was lower for PaO 2 , RR, \u0394EELV and PEF, as if improved aeration and its effects on oxygenation constantly increase with flow; while non-linear AIC was lower for MV, MV corr , \u0394Pes and PTPes, possibly suggesting that most of the improvement in CO 2 wash-out from upper airway dead space and its consequences on patient's effort is already obtained at 30 L/min. Conclusions HFNC induces multiple beneficial physiologic effects that might delay respiratory decompensation and improve clinical outcomes. However, not all effects linearly increase with HFNC flow so that its selection might be personalized to target the most clinically relevant physiologic derangement.",

Methods The airway model was made by a 3D printer using the craniocervical CT data of a healthy 32-year-old male. The total anatomical dead space was adjusted to 180 mL (3 mL/kg). The model lung (LUNGOO : Air water safety service Inc., Kobe, Japan) had the following settings: normal (Compliance (C) 50 ml/cmH 2 O, resistance (R) 5 cmH 2 O/L/s, tidal volume (Vt) of 500 mL, respiratory rate (RR) 16 /min), obstructive (C 70, R 20, Vt 700, RR 10), restrictive (C 30, R 5, Vt 300, RR 30) with inspiratory time at 1 second, and residual volume of 1000 mL. CO 2 was infused into respiratory lung models to reach P ET CO 2 of 40 mmHg without HFNC. After setting P ET CO 2 with each lung model, HFNC with flows of 10 to 60 L/min were applied and the change in P ET CO 2 in the subglottic area and the inlet of the lung model was measured. PEEP inside the model was also recorded. Conclusions The washout effect of HFNC is thought to reduce the P ET CO 2 enough to have a clinical effect. Contrary to the relation of HFNC flow and generated PEEP, the HFNC reduced P ET CO 2 with a relatively low flow in open mouth models. HFNC required more flow to reduce P ET CO 2 with a closed mouth model, which is thought to be due to a less efficient washing out of the dead space than in the open model. Grant acknowledgment Nothing to Declare. Introduction Clinical frailty is increasingly used and recognised to predict mortality and functional dependence following critical admission 1 although less is known regarding its impact on specific patient groups. Bilevel noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is frequently used to treat acute respiratory failure (ARF) of various aetiologies. Whilst NIV is known to be beneficial in exacerbations of COPD 2 , acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema 3 and other presentations of ARF, there is scarce data available on the impact frailty may have on the success of NIV in this patient group.",

Conclusions Though there were not many SCI patients admitted in the unit compared to other patients. SCI patients stayed longer by 5 days on average. Three main reasons were identified why they stayed longer; one was because of ISCoPE research, the other one was their dependency on advance organ support and lastly, the delayed discharges because of shortage of ward beds.

Plasma adenosine increased during endotoxemia, without differences between groups. Platelet reactivity was reduced in ticagrelor and clopidogrel treated subjects, without any correlation with cytokine responses.",

Although addition of ticagrelor but not clopidogrel significantly attenuated the TNF\u03b1 response, ticagrelor or clopidogrel did not affect IL6, IL8, IL10, and IL1RA responses. Conclusions Compared to high-flux dialyzers, HCO filters offer significantly higher removal rates for middle molecules such as cytokines and other target molecules with similar molar mass. Therefore, HCO filters should be preferred in extracorporeal therapies for the supportive treatment of systemic inflammatory syndromes.",

The most common DVT risk factors were age, peripheral venous insufficiency (24,4 %), obesity (23,2 %), previous immobilization (17,1 %). In the ICU, 10 patients were admitted due to massive PE, 23 submassive PE, 11 due to hypoxemia and 23 for other reasons, more frequently due to the need constant monitoring. DVT was confirmed in 17 patients. Thrombolytic therapy was administered to 29 patients (13 submassive PE; 13 massive PE), 3 with registered complications (haemoptysis, haematuria and multiple hematomas and skin haemorrhage). Ventilation and vasopressor support were needed in 7,3 %. One patient was transferred to Intensive Care Unit; 1 died in ICU, 2 after discharge of ICU and 2 in the next 6 months. Conclusions Age is an important risk factor in patients admitted to ICU. Although 21 patients were classified as low/very low risk patients they were clinically unstable, had cardiac repercussion or needed constant monitoring. These patients were younger, with less comorbidities and with better physiological condition that may have underestimated PESI Score.

The concentration median of interleukins from blood serum obtained after hemosorption was 380 pg/mlfor IL-6; 165 pg/ml for IL-8; 400 pg/ml for IL-18; 70 pg/ml for IL-10.During the analysis of the results, patients were divided into two groups: those with a moderately high value of IL-6 (250 pg/ml), and with ultra-high value (from 250 pg/ml) before hemosorption procedure. In the first group 70 % of patients after hemosorption procedure showed no significant changes in the concentration of IL6. 30 % of the second group showed a tendency to decrease the level of serum IL-6. In the studied ofAlteco LPSadsorbers eluates sorbed cytokines were found, but significantly high level was only for IL-8. There was an increase in serum IL-10 (33 %) and IL-18 (35 %) after extracorporal detoxification procedure. Conclusions These results indicate that the application of LPS-absorber Alteco in patients with sepsis is not significantly affect of free cytokines level in the systemic circulation.

The volume of distribution was higher (47 against 22 l l) and the half-life was longer (1.2 hours against 0.7 h) in burn patients. The HFIP free rates were higher in burn patients (2.6 mg / L vs 1.6 mg / mL 30 minutes after discontinuation of sedation, p = 0.02) but remained below 6 mg / ml .

Toscani -St George's University Hospital, London, United Kingdom Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):A165 Introduction The gold standard to evaluate fluid responsiveness and guide fluid administration, in both critically ill and surgical patients, is the fluid challenge technique (FC). Recent evidence has highlighted an important variability in the current practice of this technique. Different techniques may lead to different results and different clinical decisions.Objectives The aim of this study is to describe the fluid challenge techniques reported in fluid responsiveness studies and clinical trials and to assess whether there is a difference in the proportion of \"responders\" depending on the type of fluid, volume and duration of infusion.Methods We conducted a systematic review using Medline and EMBASE. The inclusion criteria for the studies were: the use of the FC as a test of cardiac preload; the inclusion of a description of the FC ( reporting volume, type of fluid and duration of infusion); a reported definition of fluid responsiveness; a reported proportion of responders and non-responders;clinical setting(ICU or operative theatre).Included studies were examined in full and subjected to quantifiable analysis.The predictors were categorized as follows: volume (<500 ml, 500 ml and >500 ml); fluid type (colloids or crystalloids); infusion rate (<15 min, between 15 and 30 min, \u226530 min). The proportion of responders was compared.Results 76 studies were included in the analysis. 7 studies(12 %)used less than 500 mL, 46 studies(79,3 %)used 500 mL and 5 studies(8,6 %) used more than 500 mL. The proportion of responders in the group of < 500 mL is .48(median:.49 IQR: .39-.57), in the group of 500 mL is .57(median = .56, IQR = .44-.68) and in the group of > 500 mL is .57 (median = .50, IQR = .38-.79). There is no evidence to suggest that the proportion of responders changes with the volume used (H = 1,79 p = .40). 23 (31,5 %)studies reported the use of crystalloids, whilst 50 (68,5 %) studies used colloids. In 3 studies the type of fluid was not clearly reported. There is no evidence to suggest that the proportion of responders changes between colloids and crystal-loids (M = .53, SD = .15 vs M = .56, SD = .15, F(1,71) = .85, p = .35). The duration of infusion was <15 min in 19 studies(27,9 %), between 15 and 30 min in 23 studies(33,8 %) and \u226530 min in 26 studies (39,2 %).The proportion of responders changes across the different infusion times (F(2,65) =4,16 p = .02).Planned contrast revealed that the proportion of responders in the group of < 15 min(M = .60)and the group of 15 to 30 min(M = .57) were similar, but both were significantly different from the proportion of responders in the group with an infusion time \u226530 min (M = .49, F(2,65) = 4.17, p = 0.02).Conclusions Most studies assessing fluid responsiveness use 500 mL of colloids infused over 30 minutes or more. A long infusion rate decrease the proportion of fluid responders.",

Variations of %villi-PPV between baseline measurements and each measurement time-point (BL-to-TS; BL-to-T2H; BL-to-T6H) exhibited a good agreement with variations in mesenteric VO 2 and oxygen extraction ratio (R 2 = 0.57 and 0.71 respectively, p < 0.001).

New clinical criteria for the sepsis diagnosis were developed (S-3)[2], but the rationale of their use in patients receiving anticancer therapy is not yet determined.ObjectivesTo determine the sensitivity and specificity of the new sepsis clinical criteria in patients who received anti-cancer therapy Method A total of 48 records of patients having 2 or more SIRS criteria (S-2) that admitted to therapeutic ICU in 2014-2015 were subjected to a retrospective analysis. All patients had anticancer drug-related adverse events of various grade. The diagnosis of sepsis (criteria SIRS + defined infectious lesion \u00b1 defined infectious agent) was determined in 35 (72.9 %) of cases. Retrospectively, all patients met the S-3 criteria. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of S-3 criteria were calculated. The calculation of 95 % confidence interval (CI) was carried out by means of the Wilson Method Results At the time of the ICU admission 34 patients met the S-3 criteria.

HCPs working in a poor climate perceive a need for improvement on all previous factors. This climate was further characterized by poor communication, distrust and low respect. Conclusions: We identified seven key dimensions, from which 4 meaningful types of ICU EOL-DM climates could be discerned. The climates differ mainly in 2 key dimensions: the way of nurse involvement in EOL and in physicians active DM. Our research offers opportunities to develop tailored ICU team interventions.",

GTC) offers resources for participating hospital sites.Whilst individual elements of the GTC programme have been shown to be of benefit in individual sites, implementation of the package of resources and the ability of the GTC database to track and benchmark healthcare improvements had not been evaluated.Objectives: The primary aim of the project was to implement the GTC into four diverse NHS hospitals and to evaluate impact on the safety and quality of care delivered. We hypothesised that systematic healthcare improvements would reduce the severity of harm resulting from tracheostomy-related safety incidents and improve surrogate markers of the quality of patient-centred outcomes such as time to first vocalisation. There was also a significant trend towards lower harm categories for incidents over the duration of the project (Chi Square test for linear trend, r = -0.21, p < 0.01). Monthly analysis of the dataset for percutaneous tracheostomies showed non-significant trend toward earlier speaking valve use and vocalisation (median slope = -0.17, -0.83 to 0.4) associated with improvements in reported patient satisfaction scores.Conclusions: Our study has demonstrated that meaningful improvements in the safety and quality of care for patients with tracheostomies are possible using improvement methodology advocated by the GTC in diverse NHS Trusts.

Adequate nutrition is essential for recovery from critical illness; malnutrition has been associated with poor patient outcomes in intensive care units. Objectives: To estimate the adequacy of nutritional in mechanically ventilated patients and its effect on patient outcomes. Methods: This was a prospective observational study, done over a period of one year(Jan.-Dec. 2015}). All adult patients mechanically ventilated for >48 hours were included in the study. Patients were started on protocol driven continuous enteral nutrition, targeted to achieve 25 Kcal/kg/day of energy and 1 gm/kg/day of protein. Data was collected on demography, admission severity of illness, hemodynamics, subjective global nutritional assessment (SGA), and lead time to initiation and achievement of full feeds, adequacy of energy and proteins supplied reasons for feeds interruptions and complications of enteral nutrition. All data on nutrition was collected till the patient stayed on ventilator. Primary outcome was time to achieve full feeds; secondary endpoints were time to initiate feeds and reason for interrupting feeds.

Kao 1 , L.-C. Chiu 2 , C.-Y. Hung 2 , C.-H. Chang 2 , S.-H. Li 2 , H.-C. Hu 2 Pneumonia is the leading risk factor of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). For the critically ill patients with pneumonia, coinfection had higher mortality and longer length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU). Little is known about the impact of coinfection on the outcomes of pneumonia-induced ARDS patients.Conclusions: The coinfection with virus and other pathogen from BAL was associated with increased mortality in pneumonia-induced ARDS patients. Plasma samples and clinical data were prospectively collected from 30 patients admitted to the Critical Care Department with severe CAP according to IDSA/ATS Criteria 4 . Serum Kallistatin levels were collected on days 1 and 4 of ICU admission. It was correlated with APACHE II, SOFA, CURB-65 scores & PSI on admission also with P O2 /Fi O2 ratio and CRP on days 1 and 4. Patients were classified according to the moment of flu diagnosis: early (in the first two days of hospitalization) and late (between the 3rd and 7th day of admission). Demographic, temporary variables, comorbidities, severity at ICU admission, treatment and mortality were evaluated intra-ICU. Logistic regression was used to identify related factors to late diagnosis and Cox regression to determine whether the late diagnosis was an independently variable associated Influenza viruses is one of the main cause of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI).

Objectives In our study, we aimed to investigate the effects of intravenous application of Dental Follicule Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells (DF-MSCs) on cytokine balance, T regulator levels and ileal tissue histopathology. Methods 38-Sprague Dawley male rats were seperated into five groups. I.Group was control; II. Group was healty + DF-MSC administrated, III. Group was cecal ligation-perforation(CLP), IV. Group was CLP + administration of DF-MSC at zero hour and V. Group was CLP + administration of DF-MSC at fourth hour. At the 24th hour CD4 + CD25 + FoxP3 + (Treg) levels, lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine levels were analyzed from the spleen of sacrificed rats. Histopathologic evaluation of ileal tissue was done by using Chiu score. Results Migration of Green Fluorescent Protein marked MSC(GFP, DF-MSC) to damaged ileocecal epithelium was shown by in Vivo Imaging system(iVIS) studies. levels were lower (1410 \u00b1 120 vs 806 \u00b1 64) (p < 0.05) in group V compared to group III.

Our results suggest that intravenous application of DF-MSC results in migration of stem cells to damaged ileoceceal tissue where they can function and protect the integrity of ileal tissue.

Methods Six transport ventilators (gas-driven Hamilton Raphael, Oxylog 3000, Medumat Transport and turbine-equipped Hamilton C1, C2, Elis\u00e9e 350) and two ICU ventilators (Servo-I , Hamilton G5) were tested under pulmonary conditions simulating healthy lungs, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Accuracy of V T , Pplat and PEEP were measured by a calibrated pneumotachograph. A percentage difference between actual and displayed values of more than \u00b110 % was defined as inaccurate.Results Inaccuracy in V T delivery was demonstrated in gas-driven transport ventilators Medumat Transport 66010 (in 8 of 10 experiments), Oxylog 3000 (in 7 of 10 experiments), Hamilton Raphael 350 (in 4 of 10 experiments) as well in the turbine-equipped ventilator Elis\u00e9e 350 (in 6 of 10 experiments). Inaccuracy in PEEP was present mainly in Medumat Transport 66010 (in 5 of 10 experiments) and turbine-equipped Hamilton C2 (in 4 of 10 experiments). No Pplat inaccuracies were detected in any ventilator. Pulmonary conditions as ARDS or COPD or ventilation settings with high PEEP and respiratory rate did not consistently influence inaccuracy in V T . The influence of delivery of oxygen from a cylinder on V T inaccuracy was present only in gas-driven ventilators Oxylog 3000 and Medumat Transport 66010 under ARDS-conditions. Conclusions Transport ventilators differ in accuracy of delivering tidal volume demonstrating better performance in turbine equipped models. Oxygen supply by cylinder was of limited influence in two gas-driven ventilators only. Two of three turbine equipped transport ventilators (Hamilton C1 & C2) tested showed accuracy comparable to ICU ventilators and therefore are suitable for critical care transport. The use of many gas-driven ventilators in critical care transport should be questioned considering their inaccurate performance.Introduction Early detection of clinical response is determinants of clinical outcome in people with acute illness. IHCA (intrahospital cardiac arrest) often is preceded by a clinical deterioration that could be identified and treated by trained personnel. The NEWS (National Early Warning Score) from NHS (National Health System) 1 , is based on a simple scoring system in which a score is allocated to six simple vital signs parameters (respiratory rate, oxygen saturations, temperature, systolic blood pressure, pulse rate, level of consciousness.Figure 116Objectives To describe the patient clinical state prior to IHCA and the relationship with prognosis, in a University Hospital. Methods A retrospective, single-center and descriptive study was conducted during 2014 and 2015. We analyzed all patients admitted on hospital ward that were assisted by the IHCA team. Patients admitted less than 24 hours on Ward and patients not eligible for resuscitation were excluded. Demographic data (age and gender) were collected. We described the type of patient (medical or surgical), features of IHCA attention. The NEWS has 3 levels of scoring, low (1-4), medium (5 and 6) and high (>6) that are related to clinical risk. It was performed by evaluating the data from the vital signs registered on the Ward in the 24 hours prior IHCA. Statistics.Qualitative variables are expressed as percentages and compared using the X2-test; quantitative ones are expressed as means and standard deviations (\u00b1 S.D), and analyzed using Student\u00b4s t-test. The level of significance was placed at p < 0.05. The statistical analysis was performed using specific software (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 19.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp).",

Analysis between hospital mortality our performance in achieving key components of current standard post-resuscitation care having adopted 36C as our target for 30H post ROSC. Unit LOS and outcomes were also collected. Methods We identified all admissions to our unit post cardiac arrest using the ICNARC database. Our electronic record was then analysed to identify all those patients admitted post OOHVF. Electronic records were used to identify age, sex, unit LOS(d), estimated ROSC duration, cooling method, time to achieve TTM target 36C, max temp recorded 30H post ROSC, presence of rebound hyperthermia >38C within 48H post TTM, incidence of seizures, use of anticonvulsants and NMB drugs, SSEP N20 and EEG, GCS on unit discharge and unit outcome. Results 66 OOHVF survivors were admitted to our ICU in the audit period. Median age was 62.7 (17-85) M 54, F 12. Median unit LOS was 5.7 days. 56 % of admissions were discharged alive from ICU. 25.7 % patients had seizures on EEG and SSEP was used to prognosticate in 19.7 %. 38 % patients required atracurium to prevent shivering during the TTM period. TTM target 36C was achieved within 4 h post ROSC in 87 %. 78 % patients received cooling via the Icycath and the remainder via surface methods. 37 % of patients had rebound hyperthermia over 38C within 48 h post TTM. One patient was discharged with GCS9. All other survivors had a GCS of 14 or 15 at unit discharge. Conclusions Our unit adopted controlled temperature management to 36C for 30 h post ROSC after publication of the TTM trial. Our admission numbers and demographics have remained unchanged and our adherence to our guideline is good, though only 78 % received IV cooling catheters as stipulated. Our unit survival of 56 % is identical to audits previously performed and is in line with published outcomes. Despite using cooling catheters to control temperature after the TTM period, 37 % of patients suffered rebound hyperthermia in that 48H window. This does not seem to have adversely affected mortality.",

This retrospective study evaluated the favorable effect of early tracheotomy in patients CSCI. OBJETICVES. To evaluate the timing of tracheotomy in patients with cervical injury and its effect on ICU stay Methods Retrospective data analysis of 72 patients with CSCI who underwent tracheotomy. The primary objective was to evaluate the impact of early tracheotomy(performed within 1 week of CSCI) on better outcome, in terms of days on mechanical ventilation and ICU stay in patients with high (C1, C2) and low (C3 to C7) CSCI. Outcome measures were also compared between the high and low CSCI patients when early tracheotomy was performed in both. In addition the impact of early tracheotomy in terms of survival benefit, ventilator dependence, requirement of inotropic medications, and whether surgical intervention resulted in better outcome in terms of days in mechanical ventilation and ICU stay were also analysed. Results Patients with high CSCI patients with early tracheotomy had significantly less days on mechanical ventilation and inotropic support compared to those with late tracheostomy (9.3+/-7.2 and 13.7 +/-3.2; p = 0.04 and 0.3+/-1.8 and 4.7+/-11.4; p = 0.035 respectively). Low CSCI patients with early tracheotomy also had significantly less days on mechanical ventilation compared to those with late tracheotomy (12.1+/-10.4 and 25.2+/-17.7; p = 0.034). Early tracheotomy resulted in significantly less days of inotropic support in high CSCI patients compared to low CSCI (0.3+/-1.8 and 2.7+/-5.6; p = 0.022). A trend was observed towards lesser ICU stay and days on mechanical ventilation in patients of high CSCI with early tracheotomy. There was no difference in terms of survival benefits, ventilator dependence, and impact of surgery on outcome measures Conclusions Our retrospective analysis supports the hypothesis that early tracheotomy is beneficial in reducing the period on mechanical ventilation and inotropic support in patients with CSCI, irrespective of the anatomical level of injury Introduction Severe abdominal sepsis is one of the more important risk factor for ICU and Hospital Mortality in the abdominal postoperative period.Objectives The objective was to analyze ICU, and Hospital mortality, Days of Mechanical ventilation, kidney failure, pneumonia, adult respiratory distress syndrome, and vasoactive drugs used. Also we study the differences between temporary abdominal closure and negative pressure therapy (ABThera,kCI). Methods We analyze all patients admitted in our ICU from emergency abdominal Trauma and surgery areas, between January 2009 to January 2015 . It was a retrospective study. We compered different variables as age, sex, manheim peritonitis index, CHARLSON INDEX, APACHE II, and SOFA on first day admission ,ICU, Hospital Mortality, pneumonia, days of mechanical ventilation in two groups of patients; patients with primary temporary abdominal closure, and patients with previous negative pressure assistance. Significant statically results when P level was < 0.05. Results. 93 patients were admitted in our ICU between 2009-2015, Mean APACHE II 22.3,Mean SOFA 3,8. Group 1: patients with primary abdominal closure: Hospital mortality was lower in patients after prymary abdominal closure 32 % vs 37 % ( ns P > 0.05) in patients with previous negative abdominal pressure assistance, longer stay 22.6 days vs 15.6 days in patients without primary abdominal closure ( P ns), less days of mechanical ventilation 8 days vs 11 days in patients without abdominal closure, P > 0.05, pneumonia 12.9 % vs 18 %, ns, nosocomial infections, 36 % vs 58 %, p ns, kidney failure by RIFLE score 11 % vs 21 %, ns. Conclusions In our study the primary abdominal closure showed less ICU and Hospital mortality also less ICU complications as pneumonia or Kidney failure although the differences were not significant statically. Probably we will need it a bigger sample to observe significant differences.A309 The influence of peep and positioning on central venous pressure and venous hepatic hemodynamics in patients undergoing liver resection A.

The inferior vena cava (IVC) ultrasound exam has been suggested to predict the CVP but there are few and divergent conclusions on the its effectiveness in spontaneously breathing patients. Objectives To check the level of reliability, validity and correlation with CVP of the IVC ultrasound measures and the quality of reporting of literature on this topic. Methods This review was based on the PRISMA guideline. The systematic search of the literature published from 1941 through 30 June 2015 explored the PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Knowledge and Scopus databases. Inclusion criteria were studies who investigated the reliability, the validity in predicting CVP and the correlation with CVP of the IVC ultrasound measures in adult (>18 yrs) spontaneously breathing patients. Two researchers selected studies using inclusion criteria and then assessed their quality using the STARD and QUADAS guidelines. The key words for literature search were: inferior vena cava, ultrasonography, volume status, central venous pressure.Results  We collected 593 studies: 148 excluded with reasons, 433 because duplicates. 12 studies were included for the final analysis with 7 reports which included spontaneously breathing patients and 5 a mixed population (spontaneous and ventilated): 3 on reliability, 10 on correlation with CVP, 5 on validity. The IVC ultrasound measures (IVC ratio, IVC MAX diameter, IVC MIN diameter , Caval index [IVC-CI]) showed an inter-rater agreement range from moderate to very good. The IVC MAX diameter had a significant high correlation with CVP; there were divergent conclusions on IVC-CI and poorly correlation for IVC ratio. The IVC-MAX and IVC-CI showed a good validity in predicting low CVP; the IVC Max and IVC-CI showed good validity in prediction high CVP in one study. Eight studies respected more than 60 % of the STARD items and five more than 80 % of QUADAS items. Conclusions Because few reports have been published on the reliability and validity of IVC ultrasound measures the conclusions of this review should be confirmed. Anyway the quality of reporting and methodology of the studies collected were good. The IVC max and min diameter seem to correlate with CVP. All IVC measures show a good accuracy in predicting low or high CVP.Introduction Transesophageal Echocardiography (TEE) is a standard procedure in Intensive Care. In patients with respiratory insufficiency, TEE with often necessary sedation may lead to further deterioration. We performed TEE in pts. already under NIV via a full face mask. Methods Consecutive pts. already under NIV because of respiratory failure (15 pts, 8 m/7f , age 72 \u00b1 11,2 years, SAPS II score 44 \u00b1 12, PaO2/ FiO2 \u2264 250) with a clinically given indication for immediate TEE were equipped with a full face mask (\"endoscopy mask\", VBM Medizintechnik GmbH, Sulz a.N.,Germany). Ventilation was uniformely set (BiPAP f = 20/ min, 30-10 cmH2O, I:E 1:1, FiO2 1,0). For sedation, disoprivan was given as needed. Heart rate, arterial blood pressures and transcutaneous SaO2 were monitored continuously. Blood gases were taken 15 min before, on start and then every five min troughout TEE and 15 and 60 min thereafter. Indications for TEE included endocarditis/ sepsis-focus, n = 8; intracavitary thrombus in tachyarrhythmia, n = 5; or quantification of vituim cordis, n = 2.Results TEE was completed in all pts. Mean duration of the procedure was 11,6 \u00b1 2,9 min, mean ejectionfraction was 45 \u00b1 15 %. Percutaneous SaO2 never fell below 92 %. No pt. had to be intubated within 24 h. In 11 pts. TEE lead to definite diagnosis. In 5 pts. immediate therapy (i.e. electrical cardioversion) was be performed Conclusions Performed by experienced physicians, TEE at the bedside during NIV in sedated pts. was feasible and save.

Hypercapnia is a common clinical state both in the perioperative period and the ICU. Theoretically, elevated carbon dioxide levels could affect the performance of the capnodynamic method. Objectives The aim of the current study was to evaluate the performance of CO EPBF during elevated PvCO 2 in a porcine model. Methods The required alterations of alveolar concentration of carbon dioxide were created by a ventilatory pattern containing cyclic reoccurring expiratory holds during controlled ventilation. The mathematical model used to calculate CO EPBF assumes a steady state in PvCO 2 levels. Hypercapnia was induced by three means; decreasing minute ventilation by either lowering respiratory rate or tidal volume, and finally, increasing dead space with preserved minute ventilation. CO EPBF was compared to a reference method for CO, an ultrasonic flow probe around the pulmonary trunk. Hemodynamic measurements and blood gas analysis were obtained at baseline before hypercapnia and during the three different types of hypercapnia. Preload reduction (inflated cava balloon) and dobutamine stimulation was performed during low respiratory rate and increased dead space. Results During hypercapnia the PaCO 2 and PvCO 2 levels were raised on average 58 % and 40 % (+/-17 and 16 %) from within normal limits, respectively. Bias (LoA) att baseline before induction of hypercapnia was 0.5 L/min (-0.5 to 1.5) and percentage error (PE) 28 %. During hypercapnia, bias (LoA) was 1.4 L/min (0.2 to 2.7), PE 26 % following lower respiratory rate, 0.7 L/min (-0.7 to 2.2), PE 30 % when tidal volumes were decreased, and 0.5 L/min (-0.4 to 1.4), PE 19 % when dead space was increased. During hemodynamic changes the PE was slightly increased (see",

In this regard, the measurement of the left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) by echocardiography is considered to be the gold standard. Only few studies investigated the correlation between the LVEF and the Cardiac Function Index (CFI) calculated through transpulmonary thermodilution[1, 2]. Objective To assess the usefulness of cardiac function index (CFI) as a surrogate of left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) in patients with acute circulatory failure.Methods We conducted a prospective study in a 12-bed medical surgical intensive care unit. All patients admitted with acute circulatory failure and monitored with a transpulmonary thermodilution device were included in our study. We excluded the patients with acute core pulmonale and those with poor echogenicity. A bedside trans-thoracic echocardiography was performed simultaneously with transpulmonary thermodilution. Cardiac function index and left ventricle ejection fraction were recorded simultaneously. Results Twenty-one patients were included in our study.Median [quartile] age was 66 [57-81] years. Sex-ratio (M/F) was 12/9. Fourteen patients (66.7 %) were admitted with septic shock whereas 7 patients (33.3 %) had cardiogenic shock. Mechanical ventilation was required for 13 patients (61.9 %). Median [quartile] CFI was 4.5 [2.75 -6] min -1 . Median [quartile] LVEF was 60 [45.75 -66] %. Spearman coefficient was 0.844 (p < 0.001). Moreover, a CFI > 4.5 min -1 predicted a LVEF > 60 % with a sensitivity of 100 % and a specificity of 82 %. Conclusion CFI can be used as a reliable tool to predict LVEF in patients with acute circulatory failure.Introduction Monitoring of a systemic hemodynamic at victims with the severe combined injury allows to outline the volume and structure of an infusion therapy. At this moment invasive methods are typically used for monitoring of a systemic hemodynamic. However, invasive monitoring is impossible or extremely limited in some patients because of a mode of failure (for example, pelvic fracture) and a consumable cost. In such cases non-invasive monitoring of a systemic hemodynamic can be used as an optional method. Objective to compare cardiac output measurements between transthoracic Doppler sonography and echocardiography (EchoKG). Material and methods Twenty four patients at the age of 41 \u00b1 14 enrolled in the study (women/men -3/19, traumatic brain injury -3, a spinal trauma -2, a concomitant injury-19). We determined a stroke volume (SV) and a cardiac output (CO) with the use of the transthoracic Doppler sonography (\"USCOM\", Australia) and the transthoracic EchoKG (GE Vivid Q, USA). Transthoracic doppler sonography was provided by doctors of the intensive care unit, EchoKG was performed by doctors of the functional diagnostics.Results We didn't find differences between the average values SV and CO evaluated by DS and EchoKG: 67,2 \u00b1 21,4 ml vs 64,2 \u00b1 18 ml, and 6,5 \u00b1 2,4 l/min vs 6,4 \u00b1 2 l/min. Conclusion Usage of transthoracic doppler sonography for determining systemic hemodynamic values at victims with a severe injury allows to receive the measured data of the systolic discharge and cardiac output comparable to data of transthoracic EchoKG. TDS provided a comparable results of SV and CO measurements with EchoKG and could be used in trauma care practice.A320 Cerebral oximetry assessed by near -infrared spectrometry in patients with postresuscitation syndrome C.

Methods In this randomized non-blinded control trial, patients were recruited from 2 ICUs in Barcelona (Spain), and were assigned to one of two arms of intervention: CVVH-ST150 or CVVHD-ST150. The primary outcome was 90-day mortality. Secondary outcomes were inflammatory cytokine clearance, consumption of extracorporeal circuits, ICU and hospital length-of-stay (LOS), and presence of CRRT associated complications (dialytrauma). Results The median duration of follow up was 130 days. Mean age was 63.5 \u00b1 13.3 years and distribution of baseline characteristics were similar between groups. Overall 90-day mortality was 56.1 % in the CVVH-ST150 group and 50 % in the CVVHD-ST 150 group (p = 0.94).

Median extracorporeal circuit lifespan was 18,91 \u00b1 6 and 20,63 \u00b1 4.3 hours in the CVVH-ST150 group and the CVVHD-ST150 group (p = 0.019), respectively. Heparin was employed in 26.8 % in the CVVH-ST150 group and 15 % in the CVVHD-ST150 group (p = 0.27). Mean ICU stay was 17.3 \u00b1 14.3 days and 12.4 \u00b1 11.9 days in CVVH-ST150 group and CVVHD-ST150 group (P = 0.098), respectively. Hospital length-of stay (LOS) was 33.5 \u00b1 25.7 in the CVVH-ST150 group, as compared with 21.2 \u00b1 18.5 in CVVHD-ST150 group (P = 0.016). Serum levels of inflammatory cytokines were similar between groups. Conclusions There were no differences on survival, dialytrauma and inflammatory cytokine clearance between CVVH-ST150 and CVVHD-ST150 groups. However, the use of CVVHD-ST150 was associated with a lower hospital LOS and less consumption of extracorporeal circuits during the first 72 hours of CRRT.

During RRT, there are markedly changes in the metabolism of macro-and micronutrients which may cause malnutrition and result in impaired renal recovery and patient survival.Objectives We aimed to examine the predictive role of macro-and micronutrients on survival and renal outcomes in critically ill patients undergoing continuous RRT (CRRT). Methods This prospective observational study enrolled critically ill patients requiring CRRT at Intensive Care Unit of King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital from November 2012 until November 2013. The serum, urine, and effluent fluid were serially collected on the first three days to calculate protein metabolism including dietary protein intake (DPI), nitrogen balance, and normalized protein catabolic rate (nPCR). Serum zinc, selenium, and copper were measured for micronutrients analysis on the first three days of CRRT. Survivor was defined as being alive on day 28 after initiation of CRRT. Dialysis status on day 28 was also determined. Results Of the 70 critically ill patients requiring CRRT, 27 patients (37.5 %) survived on day 28. The DPI and serum albumin of survivors were significantly higher than non-survivors (0.8 \u00b1 0.2 vs 0.5 \u00b1 0.3 g/kg/day, p = 0.001, and 3.2 \u00b1 0.5 vs 2.9 \u00b1 0.5 g/dl, p = 0.03, respectively) while other markers were comparable. The DPI alone predicted patient survival with area under the curve (AUC) of 0.69. A combined clinical model predicted survival with AUC of 0.78. When adjusted for differences in albumin level, clinical severity score (APACHEII and SOFA score), and serum creatinine at initiation of CRRT, DPI still independently predicted survival (odds ratio 395.8, p = 0.024). The serum levels of micronutrients in both groups were comparable and unaltered following CRRT. Regarding renal outcome, patients in the dialysis-independent group had higher serum albumin level than the dialysis-dependent group, p = 0.01. Conclusions In critically ill patients requiring CRRT, DPI is a good predictor of patient survival while serum albumin is a good prognosticator of renal outcome.Fig. 127 (abstract A324).

Bercker 1Introduction Acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH) using artificial colloid such as starch solution is a common technique to reduce the requirements for allogeneic blood transfusion but is controversial especially concerning renal function. Not much data exists about the influence of starches in setting of hemodilution on renal function and microvascular perfusion. Objectives The present study was designed to investigate the impact of ANH on renal cortex microcirculatory flow distribution and its shortterm functional consequences on the systemic, renal hemodynamics and oxygenation. HR) were monitored.The right kidney was exposed and an flow probe (Transonic Systems Inc.) was placed around the renal artery to measure renal blood flow (RBF). Renal cortex microcirculatory flow distribution was measured by Laser Speckle Imaging (Moor Instruments, UK).) Results Despite MAP and CVP being stable during the entire study, we found that while HR (106+/-18 in ANH group vs. 76+/-7 in Ctr group, p = 0.025) and CO (6.7+/-1.1 in ANH group vs. 3.9+/-0.1 in Ctr group, p = 0.002) increased, PAP (17.6+/-2.3 in ANH group vs. 22 +/-4.3 in Ctr, p = 0.05) decreased significantly at Hct 10 % compared to the Ctr. Oxygen delivery (DO 2 ) did not change but SVR (704+/-128 in ANH group vs. 1259+/-128 in Ctr group, p = 0.001 at T3) and oxygen consumption (VO 2 ) (798+/-137 in ANH group vs. 1046+/-113 in Ctr group, p = 0.02 at T2; 842+/-218 in ANH group vs. 1142+/-78 in Ctr group, p = 0.05 at T3) were found to be lower than the Control. RBF increased at T3 ( 255+/-55 ml/min. in ANH group and 218 +/-42 ml/min. in the Ctrl group, p = 0.046) and was accompanied with slightly right shifted histograms but no significant change in the mean flux values of kidney was found(Figs. 128, 129). No differences was found in creatinine clearance, tubular sodium reabsorption and fractional sodium excretion of kidney between 10 % Hct of ANH and Ctr group at T3. Conclusions This study showed that ANH using HES can cause a reduction of systemic oxygen consumption with sustained oxygen delivery being maintained by an increase CO. ANH with HES also caused an increase in RBF but did not change the microvascular perfusion and flow heterogeneity in kidney. In the present study, we demonstrated that there is no deleterious effect of HES on renal function and microvascular perfusion in the setting of severe ANH.Grant acknowledgment This study was supported by the Dutch Kidney Foundation (Innovation grant 14OIP11). The effects of high level magnesium dialysis/substitution fluid on magnesium homeostasis under regional citrate anticoagulation in critically ill M. Balik, M. Zakharchenko, F. Los, H. Brodska 1st Medical Faculty, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic Correspondence: M. Balik -1st Medical Faculty, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):A330 Introduction The requirements for magnesium (Mg) supplementation increase under regional citrate anticoagulation (RCA) because citrate acts by chelation of bivalent cations within the blood circuit. The level of magnesium in commercially available fluids for continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) may not be sufficient to prevent hypomagnesemia. Objectives To test dialysis/haemofiltration fluid with Mg concentration 1.50 mmol/l under various common settings of CRRT with RCA. Methods Patients (n = 23 CVVH, n = 22 CVVHDF) on RRT dosage 2000 ml/h, blood flow (Qb) 100 ml/min, with RCA modality (4 % trisodium citrate) using calcium free fluid with 0.75 mmol/l of Mg and magnesium substitution were observed after switch to the calciumfree fluid with magnesium level of 1.50 mmol/l (n = 42) and no extra magnesium replenishment. All patients had renal indication to CRRT, were treated with the same devices, filters and the same postfilter ionized calcium endpoint (<0.4 mmol/l) of prefilter citrate dosage. Under the high level Mg fluid the Qb, dosages of citrate and CRRT were consequently escalated in 9 h steps to test various settings. Results Median balance of Mg was -0.91 (-1.18 to -0.53) mmol/h with Mg 0.75 mmol/l and 0.2 (0.06-0.35) mmol/h when fluid with Mg 1.50 mmol/l was used. It was close to zero (0.02 (-0.12-0.18) mmol/h) with higher blood flow and dosage of citrate, increased again to 0.15 (-0.11-0.25) mmol/h with 3000 ml/h of high magnesium containing fluid (p < 0.001). The arterial levels of Mg were mildly increased after the change for high level magnesium containing fluid(p < 0.01).Conclusions Compared to ordinary dialysis fluid the mildly hypermagnesemic fluid provided even balances and adequate levels within ordinary configurations of CRRT with RCA and without a need for extra magnesium replenishment.",

Methods In this single-center prospective study, all patients requiring CVVH for acute kidney injury were eligible for inclusion. A group of patients without ECMO receiving CVVH through CVC (C group) was compared to patients receiving ECMO (E group) in whom CVVH lines were connected to the ECMO circuit. The circuit lifespan was measured from its connection to the session discontinuation. Reasons for ending CVVH were classified as follows: effective session; primary clotting of the circuit; unsuitable inflow or outflow line pressure; not CVVHrelated end of session (NRCES). All sessions for each patient were recorded and included. Data related to CVVH were recorded at the time of initiation of CVVH (H0), then after 6(H6), 12 (H12), 24 (H24), 48 (H48), and 72 hours (H72). Primary endpoint was lifespan of the circuit. Results are presented as median and interquartile range (IQR), and absolute numbers or proportions. Statistical analysis used Mann-Whitney U test and two way independent ANOVA for comparison of multiple measures at different times. The time-to-event of both groups were estimated using Kaplan Meier analysis and log-rank test. Results Between January 2014 and May 2015, 17 patients were included in each group, 43 sessions of CVVH were recorded in the E group and 56 in the C group. 16 sessions were interrupted prematurely for NRCES leaving 34 and 49 episodes (respectively E and C group) for analyzing circuit lifespan. Circuit lifespan was statistically increased in the E group compared to the C group. Median lifespans of CVVH circuit were respectively 48 H vs 20 H in E and C groups (relative risk of session ending: 2.4, 95 % CI[1.41-3.9]",

Out of 343 patients, 189 (55.1 %) died. The annual mortality varies from 65.6 % in 2011, 44.8 % in 2013 to 54.9 % in 2015 (average 55.1 %, p(2011/2013) = 0.169). The number of RRT in the ICU did not change during the study period. HES was administered to 75 patients (21.9 %), the number of HES-receiving patients decreased from 64.1 % in 2011 to 6 % in 2013 and finally to 0 patients in 2015. Patients who were given HES received more intravenous fluids within the first 72 hours (p < 0.001), more noradrenaline (p = 0.033) and had significant higher fluid balances at all measured time-points. The mortality of patients without HES administration was lower than those who received HES (51.2 % vs. 69.3 %, p = 0.005, Phi/Cramer V = 0.151). Conclusions Contrary to our expectations, the rate of renal replacement therapy did not decrease over the last 5 years despite abandoning administration of HES solution. Nevertheless, the administration of HES was associated with a higher mortality. Additional high fluid load and a positive balance are highly associated with mortality. Further research is needed to evaluate if the relationship between high mortality and higher amount of administered fluids is based on correlation or causation.Introduction Current continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) guidelines recommend delivery of a dose of 20-25 ml/kg/hr 1 . Previous studies have shown a tendency to higher intensity dosing thanrequired 2 . The new Queen Elizabeth University Hospital Glasgow (QEUHG) merged three intensive care units (ICUs), and practice at the new unit had not yet been evaluated. Objectives To determine the delivered dose of CRRT to patients in the ICU, the number and length of breaks in delivery, and the choice of filtration fluid. Method 79 patients received CRRT in the ICU at the QEUHG between May and December 2015. A sample of 29 patients was examined. Effluent doses were collected from the electronic patient record (EPR), normalised by the patients' weights and by time on CRRT. Prescriptions, interruptions in delivery of CRRT (including noted reasons for the break) and the choice of filtration fluid were also retrieved. Result Patients received 3333 hours of CRRT, or 158 24-hour periods (8 am-7 am). Daily prescriptions were completed in 42 % of cases.Prescriptions were completed in 56 % of cases in which CRRT was required prior to review on a ward round. The median prescribed dose was 25.5 ml/kg/hr. 29 % of days saw the recommended dose delivered for patients. On 32 % of days studied, patients received a dose lower than 20 ml/kg/hr, while on another 39 % of days, patients received greater than 25 ml/kg/hr. The median delivered dose was 24.3 ml/kg/hr. Greater variation in prescription and delivery were noted in the first 3 days of CRRT. Breaks in CRRT constituted 15 % of total hours examined. The most frequent reason was for a clotted filter. The average filter lifespan was 18.6 hours, with 2.7 % lasting the maximum 72 hours. Prismasol 4 % filtration fluid was used for 94.3 % of the hours spent on CRRT. Conclusions Rates of daily prescription are poor, at 42 %. Completed prescriptions show reasonable adherence to recommended dosages. This suggests there may be a role for prompting to complete/reassess prescriptions within the EPR. Only 29 % of days saw the correct dose of CRRT delivered. It may be that the breaks in CRRT are not adjusted for in the prescribed dose, leading to under-dosing. Higher prescription, in the context of anticipated disruption, may reduce under-dosing. However, this would worsen cases of higherintensity delivery. Further work is required to understand the reasons for high-intensity prescription and delivery. Improved anticoagulation may reduce breaks in CRRT delivery, and improve filter lifespan. This could reduce workload, cut costs, and potentially improve patient outcomes.",

However, according to the Berlin definition, it is unclear whether patients with acute hypoxemia (PaO2/FIO2 \u2264 300) and bilateral opacities not fully explained by cardiac failure and who are treated with HFNC should be considered as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients. Objectives To examine whether HFNC patients with acute hypoxemia and bilateral opacities treated with HFNC and ARDS patients who were directly mechanically ventilated are similar in terms of lung epithelial, endothelial and inflammatory biomarkers. Methods Prospective multicenter study at three university tertiary hospitals enrolling intubated and non-intubated patients admitted to the ICU with acute hypoxemia (PaO 2 /F I O 2 \u2264 300) and bilateral opacities. HFNC or mechanical ventilation was initiated at the discretion of the attending physician. We measured plasma biomarkers of lung epithelial (receptor for advanced glycation end-products[RAGE] and surfactant protein D [SP-D]) and endothelial (Angiopoietin-2 [ANG-2]) injury and inflammation (interleukin [IL] 6, IL8, IL33 and soluble suppression of tumorigenicity-2 [sST2]) within the first 24 hours of ARDS onset. A propensity score matching was performed using 5 different variables (APACHE II, SOFA, PaO2/FIO2, origin of ARDS and need for vasopressors). Non-hypoxemic mechanically ventilated critically ill patients and healthy volunteers served as the controls. Results Of the 102 enrolled patients, 71 (69.6 %) were intubated and 31 (30.4 %) were treated with HFNC at ARDS onset.

Critically ill patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF) undergoing bronchoscopy have an increased risk of hypoxemiarelated complications. Previous studies have shown that in awake, hypoxemic patients non-invasive ventilation is helpful in preventing hypoxemia during bronchoscopic procedure. Recently, high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) therapy has been used to improve oxygenation in patients with ARF. However, there are minimal data evaluating the use of high flow nasal cannula undergoing bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Objectives This study investigated the feasibility and safety of highflow nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygen therapy for ARF in adult patients undergoing bronchoscopy with BAL. Methods We identified 19 patients with suspected pneumonia and hypoxemic ARF (PaO2/FiO2 \u2264 300) who were admitted to a medical intensive care unit and who received HFNC therapy undergoing bronchoscopy with BAL between May 2014 and March 2016 at Dankook University Hospital.

According the Berlin's standard , the patients were divided into the mild to moderate ARDS group(7 cases)and the severe ARDS group(5 cases).In order to detect the effect of the HFNC, we recorded the respiratory frequency , Pa0 2 /FiO 2 ,PaCO 2 in the 0 h,24 h,48 h,72 h after the treatment of HFNC as well as the failure rate of each group. Results The failure rate in the mild to moderate ARDS group is 14 percent,the HFNC don't cause the significant change in the PaCO 2 of the group(P > 0.05); The respiratory frequency of the patients in the group has been ameliorated in the 48 h due to the HFNC treatment(20.57 \u00b1 2.37vs.23.87 \u00b1 2.64,P < 0.05)and the result can be better in the 72 h.As long as the treatment of the HFNC, Pa0 2 /FiO 2 was significantly higher at 72 h(276.00 \u00b1 108.15vs.177.75 \u00b1 64.23, P < 0.05).

Objectives A survey about the reasons why SCI patients stayed longer in NICU between 2013 and 2015 and their outcome Methods A local database (Wardwatcher) was used to search and collection of data for patients admitted with SCI between 2013 and 2015. Results Out of 3,539 admissions in NICU, 326 cases were related to spinal injury and 137 were considered as spinal cord injury and 93 % of admissions were related to trauma and 6 patients were readmitted while in the hospital between 2013 and 2015. There was an increase trend of admissions in NICU between 2013 and 2015 and the data showed that the average length number of days of patient stay was 3.6 days while spinal patients were 8.6 days. The Guidelines for the Provision of Intensive Care Services(2015)recommends a discharge from critical care to ward must be within 4 hours from the decision of the consultant, the data showed that 71 % of between 9 to 14 hours delayed discharges from NICU to ward are mainly caused by shortage of ward beds followed by delay on ward. 60-66 % of SCI patients required advance cardiac and respiratory organ support and 36 % were on neurological support. 86 % of the patients had tracheostomy. Only 19 patients were qualified for SCI study called Injured Spinal Cord Pressure Evaluation (ISCoPE) where the intraspinal pressure was measured in relation to traumatic spinal cord injury and this requires the patient to be in the spinal monitoring pressure for at least 7 days. On patients outcome, 75 % had improved, 13 % died and 12 % of the patients remain unchanged. While the hospital patient outcome on discharge, 83 % lived and 17 % died.",

Heparin Dosing Score Total score = A + B + C Introduction Argatroban (ARG) is a synthetic direct thrombin inhibitor, effective against free, fibrin and clot bound thrombin. It has been approved for HIT. ARG is hepatically metabolized and has a half-life elimination of 45'. Pharmacokinetic of ARG does not depend on renal function. It's anticoagulant effect declines within 2-4 hours.Objectives The aim of our study is to investigate ARG as anticoagulant during PMB hemoperfusion in septic patients with thrombocytopenia possibly related to HIT, to prevent the circuit clotting. Methods From September 2014 to October 2015 five septic patients with thrombocytopenia needed hemoperfusion with PMB were enrolled and nine hemoperfusion sessions were performed. The entry criteria were: severe sepsis or septic shock requiring PMB hemoperfusion, thrombocitopenia (<100.000). The exclusion criteria were: serious liver dysfunction, recent surgical operation (<12 h), recent head trauma or cerebral bleeding (<10 days), hemorrhagic diseases. Patients requiring PMB hemoperfusion followed the standard protocol recommended by Estor. The patients received ARG at a dose of 250 mcg/kg as single bolus injection, 30 min before the beginning of the treatment. The monitoring of anticoagulation was achieved by systemic aPTT and thromboelastography assessment (TEG), before the beginning of hemoperfusion session (T0), at 1 h (T1), 2 h (T2) and at 4 h (T3) after the start of the treatment. The TEG was performed to identify R values that can be used for a routine evaluation of anticoagulant regimen in clinical setting, compared with aPTT values. The anticoagulation target was to achieve aPTT values between 1,5 and 2 times the reference values. Results All patients received two hemoperfusion sessions except one patient that died prematurely. The media aPTT were at T0 37 s Conclusions The ARG loading dose of 250 mcg/kg has demonstrated to be effective to maintain cartridge patency during PMB hemoperfusion. No cartridge clotting events occurred. The aPTT test demonstrated an adequate anticoagulation.",

[1, 2] The EMA restricted the use of HES 2013 based on studies showing significant increase of renal failure in septic or critical ill patients receiving HES compared to crystalloids as fluid therapy. [3] There's still a lack of data examining the occurrence of renal insufficiency in non-septic patient groups.Objectives The purpose of our study was to evaluate the effect of HES on renal function in SAH patients, who received large amounts of HES in the context of triple H therapy.Methods Medical records of all patients presenting between January 2009 and December 2013 with non-traumatic SAH were analysed. Patients were divided in two groups based on the administration of HES 6 % and/or 10 % (n = 183) vs. controls receiving crystalloids for fluid therapy (n = 93). Primary outcome was acute kidney injury (AKI) assessed using the RIFLE criteria referring to increase of serum creatinine and/or oliguria. [4] Results The study groups had similar baseline characteristics except for SAPS scores, incidence of vasospasm and ICU LOS. Patients receiving HES fulfilled significantly more often sepsis criteria. 24.6 % (62/183) of patients in the HES group had AKI at any time during their ICU stay compared to 23.6 % (25/93) in controls (p = 0.679). Only few patients needed renal replacement therapy with no significant difference between groups (4.3 % control group vs. 2.2 % in HES group, p = 0.322). Conclusions In non-traumatic SAH there was no association between AKI and HES therapy. The use of HES as fluid replacement therapy might be of less risk in non-septic critically ill patients. Introduction Delayed admission from the emergency department (ED) to intensive care unit (ICU) has been associated with increased ICU/hospital mortality, length of stay and total cost of care 1,2 . However, there is little data to support the use of any particular time frame as an indicator of quality of care. Objectives We aimed to investigate the relationship between time in ED and ICU mortality in a tertiary university affiliated hospital. Methods We conducted a retrospective study of patients admitted from 2011 to 2015. We included patients admitted directly from the ED based upon administrative registries Transfers from other hospitals including administrative passages through the ED and admissions after emergency surgery were excluded. Primary outcome was ICU mortality. Secondary outcomes included nosocomial infection, ventilation time and hospital mortality. Statistical analysis included univariate and multivariate logistic regression. Results We included 555 admissions (548 patients) with a mean SAP-SII level of 43.0 \u00b1 18.8 and ICU mortality of 19.8 % (n = 110). Mean age at the time of admission was 57.8 \u00b1 18.2y, and 60.0 % were male. Patients were admitted due to medical conditions (78.2 %) and trauma with no need for emergent surgery (21.8 %). Mean time in the ED was 8.4 hours (\u00b15.7), with a skewed distribution to the left. Significantly, there was a significant decrease of ED time during this five year period (-1.9 (-3.5--0.5, p = 0.009) hours in 2015 compared to 2011).

            "text": "Apnoeic preoxygenation for emergency rapid sequence induction of anaesthesia of critically ill patients K. Crewdson, M. Thomas Introduction Tracheal intubation is associated with significant complications including death and neurological injury. Patients who require rapid sequence induction (RSI) for emergency tracheal intubation are often critically ill or injured with little physiological reserve. Desaturation is a common problem and studies have demonstrated severe hypoxaemia (arterial oxygen saturation, SaO 2 < 80 %), in up to 26 % of patients during emergency RSI performed on Intensive Care Units (ICU). Episodes of hypoxaemia during RSI are associated with worse morbidity and increased mortality. Preoxygenation is intended to reduce desaturation and hypoxaemia in the drug-induced apnoeic phase of RSI. Application of 100 % oxygen via nasal prongs promotes movement of oxygen-enriched air into the alveoli during apnoea, which can help sustain SaO 2 . The majority of studies, though of variable methodology suggest a benefit with apnoeic oxygenation with improvement in SaO 2 during the apnoeic phase or difficult laryngoscopy. One RCT comparing apnoeic oxygenation to standard facemask oxygen prior to laryngoscopy failed to show any benefit of apnoeic oxygenation. Objectives This is a clinical effectiveness study of apnoeic oxygenation as a preoxygenation strategy to reduce episodes of hypoxaemia for patients undergoing emergency RSI. The primary endpoint was the number of patients who desaturate to less than 90 % in the peri-RSI period. Methods Patients undergoing emergency RSI in the Emergency Department (ED) and ICU at Southmead Hospital, Bristol were included in the study. Southmead Hospital is the regional major trauma, neuroscience and vascular centre and has an additional large unselected medical and surgical take. Data collected included patient demographics, observations before, during and after RSI, and indication for RSI. Data from current standard practice (preoxygenation via a face-mask) was collected over a 3-month period to establish current rates of hypoxaemia. The same data were collected for a subsequent 3 months using apneic oxygenation. Results In total, 71 patients underwent emergency RSI in the study period. Common reasons for intubation were clinical course (39 %), failure to oxygenate (34 %) and failure to ventilate (14 %). Twenty-one complications were experienced during RSI in 20 patients; hypoxia was the most common complication, occurring in 23 % of patients. In the study period, 24 patients received apnoeic oxygenation. Nine of 47 patients who did not receive apnoeic oxygenation experienced hypoxia (19 %), compared with 7 of 24 patients (24 %) did, p = 0.377. Summary: The incidence of hypoxia associated with emergency RSI in unselected patients is high. The use of apnoeic oxygenation to reduce hypoxia during the drug-induced apnoeic phase of RSI remains a much debated intervention. Having established feasibility, we now intend to investigate the utility of apnoeic oxygenation with larger patient numbers. response to volume with both the VPP (ROC curve: 0.96) as the VSS (ROC curve: 0.92), defined as the 20 % improvement in cardiac output. We found a decrease in complications but no statistically significant differences in respiratory complications (4 vs 2, p = 0.62), infectious complications (5 vs 2, p = 0.35) and nausea and vomiting (6 vs 1, p = 0.057). Conclusions Guided therapy goals (GTD) is able to decrease the volume of liquid provided after hepatic resection. This fact optimize hemodynamics values in these patients (cardiac output, mean arterial pressure) and therefore, reduce postoperative complications due to excessive intake volumen. Introduction Critically ill children are exposed to multiple nephrotoxic medications due to the nature of the underlying disease process as well as comorbid conditions. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is prevalent in the pediatric critically ill. Nephrotoxin exposure is a potentially modifiable risk factor for AKI in non-critically ill children, with exposure to three or more discrete nephrotoxic agents significantly increasing odds of AKI. Despite higher inherent risk, data on AKI and nephrotoxin use in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) setting is scarce. Fluid Overload Kidney Injury Score (FOKIS) is a decision support tool piloted in our PICU as a daily score incorporating subscores for AKI (pRIFLE creatinine and urine output), fluid overload (total fluid (in-out)/ICU admission weight), and exposure to nephrotoxic medications (a priori determined list of medications).Objectives We aimed to investigate AKI prevalence and frequency of nephrotoxin exposure using FOKIS subscores.Methods Retrospective analysis of daily FOKIS subscores in PICU patients (pts) over 18 months. AKI was defined and staged using pRIFLE creatinine criteria. Nephrotoxin exposure (Exp) was defined as exposure to three or more nephrotoxic agents in 24 hours. Each additional medication exposure was also recorded. Conclusions A majority of PICU pts with AKI had exposure to nephrotoxins. Patients who had exposure to three or more nephrotoxins had increased AKI compared to patients who did not. This association needs to be further studied prospectively to determine causality, specifically exploring timing of AKI onset in relation to nephrotoxin exposure in critically ill pediatric patients. Cumulative nephrotoxin exposure is a possible modifiable AKI risk factor in critically ill children.",

All of them were resuscitated by a resuscitation protocol guided by transpulmonary thermodilution and monitoring lactic acid levels. In resuscitation phase artificial colloids were used at low doses.The incidence of AKI (according to AKIN criteria), early AKI (defined as before day 3), recovery or progression and late AKI, and related factors with their development: comorbidities, severity scores, need for mechanical ventilation, development of shock and mortality were studied. Descriptive analysis and Kruskall-Wallis test was performed Results The average total body surface area (TBSA) burned was 30 \u00b1 15 %, mean age was 43 \u00b1 16 years, mean ABSI score was 7.1 \u00b1 2.1and the median of the total volume needed in the first 24 hours was 4.01 ml/kg/% . 42 patients developed AKI (stage I: 20 , II : 5, III : 17). Of these, 12 patients (28 %) developed early AKI (stage I : 7, II 1 and III : 4). There were no differences in comorbidities en no AKI, early AKI, and late AKI patients. There were differences between late AKI and no AKI patients; the late AKI patients were older (55 vs 40 p < 0.001), had more TBSA burned (27 vs 37 p < 0.001), presented worse severity scores (ABSI 6.7 vs 8.7 p < 0.001; SOFA day 0:2.1 vs 3.9 p < 0.001; SOFA day 3: 3.5 vs 6.5 p < 0.001), presented greater need for mechanical ventilation (43 % vs 80 % p < 0.001), had more prevalence of shock ( 37 vs 73 p < 0.0001), and more mortality (4.9 % vs 39.2 % p < 0.0001) than the no AKI patients. But there were no differences in the other study factors. There were no differences between early and late AKI patients nor between no AKI and early AKI patients (except for mortality 4.9 vs 25 % p < 0.008). 4 patients with early AKI returned to basal values at 7 th day and the other 8: 3 continued in AKIN I at 7 th day, 1 increased to AKIN II level and 4 to AKIN III): Only two patients (15 % of them),one alive and another dead, did not recover basal values.Conclusions The patients without AKI had similar characteristics to the patients who developed early AKI but the patients who developed late AKI were older, had more TBSA burned, , worse severity scores, greater need for mechanical ventilation, presented more prevalence of shock and higher mortality. One third of the early AKI patients recovered normal values before the 7 th day, and most of them recover this normal values before discharge. Introduction Fluid resuscitation is a key part of patient management after cardiac surgery. Intravenous (IV) fluids are used to replace lost circulating volume and to maintain adequate perfusion to vital organs, but the volume given to patients varies greatly. In the past, the accepted practice was that the greater the volume of fluids a patient was given, the better their chance of survival. However, recent literature shows that fluid overload could possibly lead to worse outcomes for patients 1,2 and suggests that clinicians should be cautious when prescribing fluids.Objectives To determine the association between IV fluid administration (FA) and patient outcomes in patients in a cardiothoracic intensive care unit. Methods A retrospective observational analysis was conducted of all of the patients admitted to the cardiothoracic critical care unit (CCU) at Papworth Hospital between 01/01/2014 and 31/12/15. Patient data was extracted from the CCU electronic database and patients with missing data were excluded, leading to the final patient cohort used for the study. Parameters including IV FA, survival, need for a prolonged CCU stay (defined as >72 h), need for prolonged ventilation (PV) (defined as >168 h), need for parenteral nutrition (PN) and AKI score were collected. Patients were split evenly into four quartiles, determined by daily IV FA. Relative risk (RR)and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for each adverse patient outcome by comparing each of Quartile 2 (Q2), Quartile 3 (Q3) and Quartile 4 (Q4) to Quartile 1 (Q1).Results 5519 patients were identified initially, but after excluding those with incomplete data (n = 945), a total of 4574 patients were found to be eligible for the study. Patient quartiles contained 1143 or 1144 individuals. A statistically significant association was found between high FA and adverse patient outcomes in patients in Q4 compared to patients in Q1 for mortality (RR = 13. Conclusions High FA is associated with increased mortality and morbidity, with the poorest patient outcomes consistently observed in Q4 compared to Q1 across all complications. Being cautious when prescribing IV fluids may help improve patient outcomes in critical care. Conclusions In this preliminary study, secondary hyperlactataemia was associated with mortality in critically ill patients. The association remained robust after multivariable adjustments. Secondary hyperlactataemia may serve as an early signal for deterioration in critically ill patients. Future studies should assess additional therapeutic options for patients with secondary hyperlactataemia in the ICU. Objective The purpose of this study was to investigate the AASTRE impact in structure, process and outcome indicators through a multicenter study.",

            "text": "Methods A prospective study was conducted over a period of 12 months in two adult patient ICUs. Safety rounds were conducted three days a week ascertaining the 37 safety measures (grouped into 10 blocks). In each round, 50 % of the patients and 50 % of the measures were randomized. The impact of this safety tool was analysed in indicators of structure (culture of safety, healthcare protocols), process (improvement proportion related to tool application, IPR-AASTRE) and outcome (mortality, average stay, rate of catheter-related bacteremias and rate of ventilator-associated pneumonia, VAP).Results 1241 patients-day were analyzed. Structure indicators: AAS-TRE was associated with an increased climate of security and creation / modification of protocols (sedation/analgesia and weaning). Process indicators: 12 of the 37 measures had an IPR-AASTRE > 10 %. Seven mesures had an IPR-AASTRE > 10 % in the three quarters analyzed. Six mesures showed a progressive decrease of the IPR over the study period. Nursing workloads and patient severity on the day of analysis were independently associated with a higher IPR-AASTRE in half of the blocks of variables. Outcome indicators: AASTRE was associated with a significant decrease in the rate of NAV.Conclusions AASTRE was associated with improvement in structure, process and outcome indicators. This tool also improved the care process and adherence to the clinical practice guidelines and proved to be most useful in situations of high care load and in patients with more severe disease. Conclusions It has reduced the number of adverse effects in more than a half, thus we have demonstrated the effectiveness of the protocol, it is also very important that it has been accepted by almost all of the staff, this data shows that it is simple and easy to carry out. With these data we have sensitized the staff of the importance of information for patient safety. We think that with this work we can help other units.",

            "text": "To ICU stafffor making this work possible. Introduction Rapid response systems (RRS) may slightly reduce cardiac arrest in the hospital. RRS has an efferent limb such as rapid response team (RRT) and an afferent limb that has a process of timely detection and activation. RRS activates mostly 24 hours/day and 7 days/week by a multidisciplinary team. In middle-income country, unlike EU and USA the personal resources are limited. RRT call were most common during working hours in Australian study 1 Introduction Patient safety in the ICU is the prevention of injury or harm arising as a result of the process of care, rather than as a result of the underlying disease process. The incidence of medical errors and adverse events in ICU is surprisingly high 1 . Systems to improve patient safety, such as checklists, are only effective when implemented within a receptive and positive safety climate. A positive safety climate is associated with a measurable decrease in error rates 2 . Objectives To evaluate the safety climate across both critical care units within Aneurin Bevan University Health Board (ABUHB). Methods We conducted an anonymous online survey across all staff in critical care within ABUHB. The survey consisted of questions validated by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, part of the United States Department of Health and our own questions regarding staff's incident reporting behaviour. We ran the survey for a month and aimed to get a 50 % return rate from the 180 staff working across both sites. Results We received 114 responses and 101 completed surveys from across the multi-disciplinary team. Eighty eight percent rated overall patient safety as very good or excellent. The survey reported a supportive environment (83 %) where people worked well together as a team (97 %), and treated each other respectfully (90 %). Generally patient safety was not sacrificed to get more work done (66 %), and there was no pressure to take shortcuts to speed up work rate (85 %). \"Crisis mode\" was precipitated by an inability to discharge wardable patients (52 %), rather than lack of staff (27 %), or the unit being too full (33 %). Introduction Medication errors are common in critically ill patients, [1] and have the potential to adversely affect patient safety [2] . Whilst adverse events, including those caused by medications, have a direct relationship with patient outcomes, [3] the potential clinical impact of individual medication errors remain less clear. Moreover, the complexity of critically ill patient care means frequent optimisation of medications is required to ensure effective therapy. Currently the clinical impact grading of medication errors and optimisations remains subjective in clinical practice and research methodologies. Objectives To identify the reliability of clinical impact grading by health professionals (i) between professions (inter-rater) and (ii) within professions (intra-rater)) of common prescribing errors and optimisations in critical care patients; and (iii)identify representative clinical impact grades for each example.Methods 50 representative medication error and 55 optimisation cases from the PROTECTED UK study, [4] were sent electronically to a purposive sample of 30 healthcare professionals (10 ICU consultants, specialist pharmacists and specialist nurses) in 5 UK sites. Each rater graded the error or optimisation case for severity of clinical impact using a 5-point categorical scale (no, minor, moderate, severe and life threatening/saving clinical impact). Inter-rater reliability was tested using a linear mixed model. Intra-rater reliability was tested using the intra-class correlation (ICC) with a two-way random effects model using absolute agreement. Results The majority of errors and optimisations (both 76 %) had a modal clinical severity grade of moderate or higher. Error cases: doctors graded clinical impact significantly lower than pharmacists (-0.25; p < 0.001) and nurses (-0.53; p < 0.001), with nurses significantly higher than pharmacists (0.28; p < 0.001). Optimisation cases: doctors graded clinical impact significantly lower than nurses and pharmacists (-0.39 and -0.5; p < 0.001 respectively). There was excellent intra-reliability (ICC) grading for pharmacists (0.882 & 0.887; p < 0.001) and doctors (0.794 & 0.829; p < 0.001)) but only fair to good Introduction Sepsis survival rates have improved in recent years and it becomes more and more important to asses long-term outcomes in order to align treatment with what is important for patients. Quality of life (QoL) is an important patient-reported outcome (PRO) that is commonly used as an endpoint in clinical studies. However, the most frequently used instruments, eg. SF-36 and EuroQoL-5D, were developed without input from intensive care survivors and may thus lack validity in these populations. Quality of life domains which matter to sepsis survivors have not yet been elicited. Objectives Identification of the domains of quality of life of sepsis survivors according to their own perception and priorities. Methods Open-ended face-to-face or telephone interviews were conducted with sepsis survivors from interdisciplinary ICUs of a German university hospital. Interviews were transcribed verbatim with a fixed set of transcription rules and analyzed qualitatively with the interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) approach. Codes and subcodes were applied to the data and a codebook was developed. A second experienced researcher unfamiliar with the data evaluated the codebook; differences were solved by discussion. Codes were clustered into domains and evaluated for their importance by stakeholders (survivors, relatives of survivors, intensive care physicians, nurses, psychologists, rehabilitation physicians) through a Delphi process.Results Introduction Severe sepsis and septic shock are still the common cause of death in ICU. The extracorporeal blood purification therapy could provide a benefit in reduction the inflammatory mediators and bacterial endotoxins. Objectives To study the immunomoudation effect of Polymyxin-B Hemoperfusion (PMX) in severe sepsis/septic shock Methods The adult patients with severe sepsis/septic shock in intensive care units (ICUs) of King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital were tested with endotoxin assay. The patients with blood endotoxin level \u22650.6 were randomized into two groups, PMX hemoperfusion group and standard treatment group. The 2-hour PMX hemoperfusion were done in two consecutive days in PMX hemoperfusion group. Data for hemodynamic parameters, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, and blood sample were collected on first three day after enrollment The primary outcomes were leukocyte expression of CD11b, HLA-DR, chemotaxis function and blood endotoxin level on day 3 after enrollment. The secondary outcomes were 28-day survival, APACHE II score, change in SOFA score, CVS SOFA score. Results We have enrolled 36 participants into the study, 18 patients for each group. The age, APACHE II score, endotoxin level were comparable between two groups. The percent change of EAA was -19.8 % vs -10.6 % in PMX group and control group, respectively. The APACHE II and total SOFA score was -14.8 % vs +1.5 % and -12.8 % vs +6.1 %, in PMX group and control group, respectively. The CVS SOFA score was -31.4 % vs +24.9 %, in PMX group and control group, respectively. There was the trend increase in HLA-DR expression in PMX group and no change in control group.HLA-DR expression on day 3 in PMX group was significantly higher than control group, 34.5 % vs 24.2 %, p = 0.03. 28-day survival rate was comparable between two groups. Conclusions The PMX hemoperfusion seemed to improve hemodynamic instability and improved immunoparalysis status in severe sepsis/septic shock patients.",

Introduction Sepsis can induce rapid proteolysis and early exercise is desirable to prevent loss of muscle mass. It is not known whether early intervention is safe in critically ill patients with sepsis. Exercise may also act to recruit the microcirculation. Objectives To investigate the effect of 30 minutes of electrical muscle stimulation and passive movements to major muscle groups on the microcirculation in patients in the first 48 hours of sepsis. Methods Changes in tissue oxygenation were assessed at baseline and immediately post exercise using a] a near infrared oxygenation device on the thenar eminence to assess percentage of oxygen in the muscle (StO 2 ) and percentage of muscle oxygen extraction rate (MOER%) under both baseline and hyperaemic conditions. B] an orthogonal polarization spectral imaging device was placed sublingually to measure the microvascular flow index and capillary density of the microcirculation. Conclusions Early exercise appears to have a beneficial effect on critically ill patients as tissue oxygenation improved. There was evidence of recruitment of the microcirculation. Introduction Generalized vasodilation with nonresponding hypotension is present in half death cases due to septicaemia. Methylene blue could be used as a valuable complement in refractory hypotension treatment. with septic shock. Objectives The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of methylene blue as contributory treatment in patients. Methods A controlled, randomized, double blinded, clinical trial was performed. 60 patients were divided in two groups. A Group received a single dose of methylene blue calculated 2 mg/kg per body weight diluted in 100 cc of 5 % dextrose infused in 60 min. and C Group, (control) received 100 cc of 5 % dextrose infused in 60 min. Basal measurements of study variables were taken (MBP, lactate, base deficit, central venous saturation and CO2 delta) prior blue methylene administration and every hour afterwards, until MBP >65 mmHg without vasopressor or 72 hours passed after shock Introduction Sepsis induced cardiomyopathy is a complication of severe sepsis. It is characterized by left ventricular dilatation and depressed ejection fraction. Recent meta-analysis suggested that the mortality depends on the heart hyperkinetic. However, the crucial mechanism of sepsis induced cardiomyopathy and the treatment are still unknown. It has been reported that telomere length has inverse correlation to severity of heart failure and infectious disease. In addition, telomere dysfunction decreases mitochondrial function by affecting downstream gene expression of cell energy regulators such as p53 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1\u03b1). It is suggested that dysfunction of \"telomere-p53-PGC axis\" reduces a mitochondrial function, and as a result, it develops to heart failure. Beta-blockers have a possibility to improve the morbidity and mortality of sepsis by regulating sympathetic nerve system and metabolism. Carvedilol has antioxidant properties and widely used for patients with heart failure. The present study was conducted to investigate the therapeutic potential of carvedilol which improves prognosis in preclinical models of severe infection, the murine cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model to induce peritonitis. Methods CLP procedure was performed using 10 weeks male C57BL/ 6 mice. After operation, mice were divided into beta blocker group (BB) and control group (CT). 1 mg/kg carvedilol or normal saline was administered every day for each group. We isolated left ventricle of the hearts and obtained blood sample from survived individuals on postoperative day 14. We estimated survival rates, cardiac function by echocardiography, blood pressure measured by indirect tail-cuff method, telomere length in heart tissue and white blood cell were evaluated by quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization (Q-FISH) analysis.Results Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the 14 days mortality was reduced in BB group. 14 days after surgery, BB group reduced heart rate (440 \u00b1 100 BB vs. 580 \u00b1 41 bpm CT, p = 0.029) while there was no significant difference in mean arterial pressure (68.5 \u00b1 17.4 vs. 66.7 \u00b1 15.3 mmHg, p = 0.34). BB group also improved cardiac function such as E/e'(18.0 \u00b1 7.3 vs. 27.0 \u00b1 4.0, p = 0.027), LVEF(57.0 \u00b1 4.8 vs. 46 \u00b1 5.2 %, p < 0.01) and LVEDV(56.9 \u00b1 13.4 vs. 46.3 \u00b1 10.5ul, p = 0.02) as compared to CT group. Q-FISH analysis revealed that telomere length of white blood cells was significantly longer in BB group (68.9 \u00b1 45.0 vs. 48.0 \u00b1 29.6, p < 0.01; Telomere Fluorescence Units; TFU = 1 kb). Quantitative PCR analysis revealed that BB showed higher expression of telomerase reverse transcriptase (tert), PGC-\u03b1 which promote mitochondrial biogenesis and lower expression of p53 in heart tissue as compared to CT group. Conclusions Carvedilol improved sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy through the attenuation of telomere shortening by regulating gene expression of energy metabolism and reducing mortality resulting from sepsis. In CORTICUS trial, hydrocortisone therapy did not improve outcomes among patients with septic shock (onset within 72 hours), although it did shorten the duration of vasopressor dependence. In this study we investigated the role of the hydrocortisone therapy, at the very early phase of sepsis, when combined to hyper-fluid therapy. The purpose was to examine the protective role of corticoid and of hyper-fluid therapy on microcirculatory dysfunction progression during the early phase of sepsis. Methods Adult Wistar rats (200-300 g), under general anesthesia, were submitted to sepsis {iv. 2 mL E. coli 10 8 (S8), DL60 in 26 hours}. The intervention started 30 minutes after sepsis induction. The SBH group (n = 2) was treated with basal-fluid reposition (iv. 8 ml saline/kg/h). The SHH group (n = 2) was treated with hyper-fluid therapy (i.v. 20 ml saline/kg/during 1 h and maintained with basal fluid further). The SBH + Cort group (n = 2) was treated similar to SBH, however treating with the Hydrocortisone (i.v. 100 mg/kg, diluted in 0,5 ml Milli-Q water before the fluid therapy). The SHH + Cort group (n = 2) was treated with Hydrocortisone and hyper-fluid therapy. The microcirculation of mesentery was monitored by Intravital microscopy during the first 3 hours of sepsis. The microcirculation of renal cortex area and the liver were monitored by Sidestream Dark Field Imaging (SDF) videomicroscopy, at 3 hours after sepsis.",

            "text": "The intravital monitoring showed that, in sepsis treated with basal-fluid therapy (SBH), there was an important microcirculatory dysfunction, including an intense leucocyte adhesion and transmigration, leading to vessels' congestion and focal hemorrhages. These alterations were decreased in all the other groups, even though the ones treated with hyper-fluid (SHH) or hydrocortisone associated (SHH + Cort) resulted in lesser leucocyte adhesion and transmigration than the group treated with hydrocortisone with basal-fluid (SBH + Cort). Interestingly, the combined HH + Cort therapy determined the lowest leucocyte adhesion whereas the HH therapy alone lowered the leucocyte transmigration. The SDF monitoring revealed that, in sepsis treated with basal-fluid therapy (SBH), there was a greater microcirculatory dysfunction at both liver and kidney, presenting numerous areas of heterogeneity. The HH or corticoid alone or in combination seems to minimize the sepsis's effects on the microcirculation, however, further histological and biochemical studies are needed to better elucidate these findings. The overall data demonstrated that hyper fluid therapy and corticoid therapy, alone or combined, given in the very early phase of sepsis might bring potential benefits in the control of the exacerbated inflammatory response of sepsis.
