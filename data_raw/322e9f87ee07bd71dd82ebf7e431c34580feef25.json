            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), an enteric coronavirus, is the causative agent of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) that damages intestinal epithelial cells and results in severe diarrhea and dehydration in neonatal suckling pigs with up to 100% mortality. The oral vaccine route is reported as a promising approach for inducing protective immunity against PEDV invasion. Furthermore, dendritic cells (DCs), professional antigen-presenting cells, link humoral and cellular immune responses for homeostasis of the intestinal immune environment. In this study, in order to explore an efficient oral vaccine against PEDV infection, a mucosal DC-targeting oral vaccine was developed using Lactobacillus casei to deliver the DC-targeting peptide (DCpep) fused with the PEDV core neutralizing epitope (COE) antigen. This probiotic vaccine could efficiently elicit secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA)-based mucosal and immunoglobulin G (IgG)-based humoral immune responses via oral vaccination in vivo. Significant differences (p < 0.05) in the immune response levels were observed between probiotics expressing the COE-DCpep fusion protein and COE antigen alone, suggesting better immune efficiency of the probiotics vaccine expressing the DC-targeting peptide fused with PEDV COE antigen. This mucosal DC-targeting oral vaccine delivery effectively enhances vaccine antigen delivery efficiency, providing a useful strategy to induce efficient immune responses against PEDV infection.",

Currently, an RNA vaccine and an inactivated whole-virus vaccine of porcine epidemic diarrhea were developed at Harrisvaccines TM and Zoetis (Florham Park, NJ, USA), respectively, widely used and considered to be effective [2] . PEDV mainly gains entry to the host via the intestinemucosal surfaces of the piglets. Therefore, it is important to develop oral mucosa vaccines that can elicit effective mucosal immune responses against PEDV infection. Nevertheless, to reach the mucosal immunity-related sites in sufficient amounts, oral mucosal vaccines need to withstand harsh digestive environments, which are proving to be a big challenge for mucosal vaccine development [3] ; therefore, effective antigen delivery vehicles and the adjuvant limit the availability of oral mucosal vaccines for stimulation of immunity [4] .",

Lactobacillus strains have many characteristics that make them promising candidates as delivery systems for presenting compounds with antigens of interest to the mucosa, in particular vaccines [5] ; for example, Lactobacilli can survive in (and colonize) the upper gastrointestinal tract and exert an intrinsic adjuvant activity [6, 7] . Moreover, recent reports have shown that Lactobacillus species can effectively elicit production of secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA), induce anti-inflammatory responses, activate innate cells, and regulate the balance between T cell subset responses [8, 9] . On the other hand, in order to enhance the deliver efficiency of vaccine antigens to mucosal immune tissues via oral administration, a dendritic cell (DC)-targeting mucosal vaccine was suggested as a realistic approach for oral vaccination to induce high mucosal immune responses against infection [10] . DCs, widely distributed beneath the gastrointestinal epithelium, are professional antigen-presenting cells serving as a portal for virus invasion [11] ; therefore, DCs are an early target for virus attachment.",

Because the mucosal surface is the initial infection site for PEDV, especially in the intestinal mucosa, it would be interesting to develop oral mucosal vaccines that elicit an effective mucosal immune response against PEDV infection. The Spike (S) glycoprotein of PEDV that mediates receptor binding and membrane fusion [17] harbors several neutralizing epitopes [18] , particularly the core neutralizing epitope (COE), which can induce neutralizing antibodies against PEDV [19] .

The mucosal immune system, based mostly on SIgA, is the first and a major barrier against invading pathogens targeting the gastrointestinal tract [23] . Therefore, it is necessary to develop oral mucosal vaccines that can induce strong and protective immune responses in the mucosa (to prevent initial infection and pathogen replication), predominantly by means of SigA [34] . L. casei 393, as the antigen delivery carrier used in our study, can adhere to and colonize intestinal mucosa of murine and pigs and to tolerate bile, thus serving as a promising candidate for the delivery of antigenic material to the mucosa in some vaccines [35, 36] . In order to enhance the delivery efficiency of the antigen of interest and reduce the number of vaccinations and the quantity of lactic acid bacteria required for oral administration, intestinal DC-targeting mucosal vaccines were suggested as a promising approach of oral vaccination to induce high mucosal immune responses [10] .",

Thus, an effective mucosal immune response requires secretion of both serum IgG and mucosal SIgA. Our data showed that a strong and long-lasting anti-PEDV IgG response was detected in mice orally immunized with pPG-COE-DCpep/L393 and that the anti-PEDV IgG response increased rapidly following a booster immunization. Although the SIgA antibody represents the major humoral mechanism of defense of mucosal surfaces, serum-derived IgG can also contribute significantly to immune defense, by reducing the ability of pathogens to cross the intestinal mucosa and the systemic spread of invasive pathogens, and thereby supplements the mucosal protection provided by SigA [7, 39] . Compared with systemic immunity, the distinctive hallmark of mucosal immunity is the local production of SIgA, which can prevent binding of pathogens to the intestinal epithelial cells and remove pathogens crossing the gastric mucosal barrier [40] . Significantly, the critical advantage of the lactic acid bacteria vaccine is the ability to induce antigen-specific IgA responses in the intestinal mucosa. In this study, we observed here that oral administration of strain pPG-COE-DCpep/L393 expressing a DC-targeting peptide fused with PEDV COE antigen induced substantially elevated levels of anti-PEDV specific SIgA response in the feces, genital tract secretions, and intestinal mucus samples.Ourresults showed that oral administration of strains pPG-COE-DCpep/L393 induced a higher response than did strains pPG-COE/L393 expressing COE antigen only. However, despite statistical significance, the difference is not very large compared to the difference between a positive response and negative controls. On one hand, it may be relevant in mice species, so it need to further studies to show relevance in other species. On the other hand, in this study, the efficient antigen-specific immune responses of PEDV only induced by COE antigen, the presence of DCpep further potentiated the effect of recombinant COE antigen.",

Cytokines produced by CD4 + T helper (Th) lymphocytes could regulate immune system functions, including antibody production and cellular immune responses. The Thl cell response is closely related to cellular immune responses, whereas the Th2 cell response is associated with humoral immunity. The IL-4/IFN-\u03b3 ratio is used to indicate the Th1 or Th2 bias of the generated immune response [41] . In this study, we determined the levels of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 in the immunized mice, and observed that oral immunization with pPG-COE-DCpep/L393 can significantly elicit IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 production in a ratio of about 1:1, which indicates that pPG-COE-DCpep/L393 can induce the development of both Thl-and Th2-type immune responses in vivo, similar to the previous finding that use of the DCpep ligand supported both Thl-and Th2-type immune responses [23] . Recently, induction of SIgA against microbes and foreign immunogens was demonstrated to be a T cell-dependent immune response [42] . In this work, the fusion protein COE-DCpep delivered by L. casei canactivate DC, then elicit both Thl-and Th2-type immune responses, indicating that efficient T cell-mediated immunity was critical for SIgA induction.

            "text": "The translational value of studies in mice to the pig species is significant. Many vaccines regarding piglet diarrhea such as PEDV and TGEV were developed in the mice model [21, [43] [44] [45] . Jiang et al. showed that oral L.casei vaccine against TGEV in mice could increase the Treg population [22] . To further evaluate the immune effect of the vaccine in the target animal, Jiang et al, using piglets as models, suggested that the oral L. casei vaccine elicit effective mucosal and systemic immune responses against TGEV infection [46] . We believe that this translational value of the oral L. casei vaccine against TGEV from mice to pig has already provided promising results, especially for the congeneric PEDV which also causes pig diarrhea. Furthermore, DCpep recognizes human, avian, canine, equine, feline and mouse's DCs [10] . So we hypothesize DCpep also bound to pig DCs due to the similarity of the immune system between pig and human. Although mice are not susceptible to PEDV infection, good immune responses of the L.casei vaccine in mice were observed in this study. The results of our study at least demonstrate that L. casei surface-displayed PEDV core neutralizing epitope (COE) fused with DC-targeting peptide (DCpep) could act as a novel mucosal vaccine formulation and provide a useful strategy to induce efficient immune responses against PEDV infection. Certainly, further investigations are indispensable to evaluate the immunogenicity and host immunity protection of this vaccine following its oral administration in piglets.",
