Although it has been demonstrated that PRR-mediated innate immunity plays an essential role in defending virus from infection, it also occasionally results in overwhelming production of proinflammatory cytokines that cause severe inflammation, blood vessel leakage and tissue damage. In our efforts to identify small molecules that selectively enhance PRR-mediated antiviral, but not the detrimental inflammatory response, we discovered a compound, RO 90-7501 ('2'-(4-Aminophenyl)-[2,59-bi-1H-benzimidazol]-5-amine), that significantly promoted both TLR3 and RLR ligand-induced IFNb gene expression and antiviral response, most likely via selective activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Our results thus imply that pharmacological modulation of PRR signal transduction pathways in favor of the induction of a beneficial antiviral response can be a novel therapeutic strategy.",

            "text": "Infection of viruses is promptly recognized by host innate pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including Toll-like receptors (TLRs), RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), NOD-like receptors and Ctype lectins [1, 2] . This results in production of type I interferons (IFN), proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines that orchestrate the elimination of the pathogens. The essential role of the PRRmediated innate immune response in defending against microorganism infection has been extensively demonstrated in vivo in murine models with knockout of the genes encoding either specific PRRs or their key signaling components (reviewed in [3, 4] ). However, like adaptive immunity, the innate immune response can also be detrimental to hosts. Indeed, in many occasions, it is not the viral replication itself, but the overwhelming production of proinflammatory cytokines that causes severe inflammation, tissue damage, blood vessel leakage and occasionally permeabilization of the blood brain barrier that leads to the penetration and infection of central nervous system by viruses [5, 6, 7] . In addition, because of the vital role of PRRs in defending against virus infection, pharmacological activation of PRR-mediated innate host response has been extensively explored as a broad-spectrum antiviral approach [8, 9, 10] . However, systematic administration of the PRR agonists in doses necessary to achieve antiviral effects is usually associated with significant adverse reactions, due to the activation of a wide-spectrum of cellular responses and massive production of proinflammatory cytokines [11, 12, 13, 14] .",

            "text": "TLRs and RLRs are two major types of PRRs that recognize virus infection and induce innate immune response. Interestingly, induction of type I IFNs, the primary antiviral cytokines, and other proinflammatory cytokines upon activation of TLRs and RLRs is controlled by multiple overlapping, but distinct signal transduction pathways (reviewed in [15] ). While activation of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFkB) and distinct mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways are critical for the production of many proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, activation of the interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) (or IRF7) pathway is only required for induction of type I IFNs as well as a group of antiviral proteins, such as IFIT1, guanylate binding protein 1 and zinc finger antiviral protein [16, 17, 18] . In addition, although the three MAP kinases, p38, ERK and JNK, can be activated by TLR and RLR agonists and viral infection [19, 20] , each of the three MAPKs has been demonstrated to play distinct roles in regulating the expression of type I IFN and other proinflammatory genes [21, 22, 23] . For example, it has been shown recently that ERK activation is required for TLR3-induced chemokine production in murine dendritic cells, whereas JNK activation has a negative regulatory effect on chemokine production [24] . It is, therefore, possible to pharmacologically modulate the virus-and/or PRR-agonist-induced innate immune response by targeting distinct signal transduction pathways to selectively enhance the antiviral response, but alleviate the detrimental inflammatory response. It is conceivable that such a therapy should be effective to a broad spectrum of virus infections, either alone or in combination with PRR agonists.",

First, we set out to establish cell-based assays suitable for high throughput screening of compounds that selectively enhance TLR3 agonist-induced type I IFN production, without enhancing the activation of NFkB. Two TLR3-expressing HEK293 (293TLR3HA, Invivogen)-derived stable reporter cell lines that express firefly luciferase under the control of a human IFN-b promoter [26] (designated 293TLR3/IFNbLuc) or an artificial promoter containing consensus NFkB binding sites (Clontech) (designated 293TLR3/NFkBLuc) were established. As shown in Fig. 1 , poly I:C treatment of both the reporter cell lines induced luciferase expression in a concentration dependent manner. As expected, poly I:C treatment of 293/IFNbLuc cell line without TLR3 fails to induce luciferase expression (data not shown). Moreover, as shown in Figs. 2A and B, while the poly I:Cinduced luciferase expression was dose-dependently inhibited by chloroquine (a lysosome acidification inhibitor) and IKK-2 inhibitor IV (an IKK-b inhibitor) in both 293TLR3/IFNbLuc and 293TLR3/NFkBLuc cells, LY294002, an inhibitor of phosphoatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) that is required for activation of IRF3 [27] , only inhibited poly I:C-induced luciferase expression in 293TLR3/IFNbLuc, but not in 293TLR3/ NFkBLuc cells (Fig. 2C) . These results thus validated that the luciferase expression in 293TLR3/IFNbLuc and 293TLR3/ NFkBLuc cells was controlled by the functional IFN-b promoter and the NFkB responsive element, respectively.",

In order to distinguish these two possibilities, a time-course study was performed. As shown in Fig. 4A , the presence of RO 90-7501 increased the peak level of IFNb promoter activity at 10 h of poly I:C treatment, but the promoter activity declined with a similar kinetics since the peak time in the absence or presence of RO 90-7501. Consistent with results shown in Figs. 2B and C, RO 90-7501 inhibited the activation of NFkB (Fig. 4B) . The results thus imply that RO 90-7501 most likely targets a molecular event in the activation, but not negative feedback regulation of TLR3 signal transduction pathway to prolong the activation of IFN-b promoter. RO 90-7501 modulates TLR3 signal transduction, but has no effect on cells that TLR3 signal transduction is not activated",

However, the compound did not enhance poly I:C-induced IFNb promoter activation when the cells were pretreated with the compound for 3 h, followed by treatment with poly I:C in the absence of RO 90-7501 for an additional 9 h (treatment schedule 6).

The levels of the total and phosphorylated p38, ERK and JNK were determined by an immunoblot assay. As shown in Fig. 9A , poly I:C treatment was able to activate all three MAPK pathways tested. Interestingly, treatment of the cells with RO 90-7501 alone was able to efficiently activate p38 MAKP and to a lesser extent, ERK and JNK pathways. Furthermore, RO 90-7501 was also able to enhance the activation of the three MAPK by poly I:C. To determine the role of the three MAPKs in poly I:C-induced IFN-b promoter activation, inhibitors of the three MAPKs were applied to poly I:C treated 293TLR3/IFNbluc cells. As shown in Fig. 9B , only the p38 inhibitor (SB202190), but not ERK or JNK inhibitors (U0126 or SP600125), significantly inhibited poly I:C-induced IFN-b promoter activation. This observation, in conjunction with the facts that RO 90-7501 slightly suppresses poly I:C-induced NFkB activation (Figs. 3 and 4) and does not affect poly I:C-induced IRF3 nuclear translocation and activation of IRF3-directed gene (IFIT1 or ISG56) expression (data not shown), implies that activation of p38 MAPK pathway is most likely responsible for the observed enhancement of IFNb expression and antiviral response by RO 90-7501.",

However, it has also been observed under many circumstances that the TLR-and/or RLR-mediated innate immune response plays a critical role in viral pathogenesis. For example, pneumonia caused by influenza virus or SARS-coronavirus infections [30, 31, 32] , hemorrhagic fever caused by dengue virus and many other viruses [2, 33] and encephalitis caused by West Nile virus infection [34] have all been demonstrated to be largely due to the detrimental effects of proinflammatory cytokines induced by the infection itself. Moreover, the identification of TLRs and RLRs as key pathogen recognition receptors for innate immunity has sparked great interest in therapeutic manipulation of the innate immune system. TLR and RLR agonists are being developed for the treatment of cancer, allergies and viral infections, and as adjuvants for vaccines to prevent or treat cancer and infectious diseases [8, 35] . Despite tremendous efforts, only imiquimod (Aldara), a TLR7 agonist, has been approved by US FDA for treatment of papillomavirusinduced genital warts and basal cell carcinoma via topical use [36] . Due to the activation of a wide-spectrum of cellular responses, it is not surprising that systematic administration of the TLR agonists in doses necessary to achieve antiviral or anti-tumor effects is usually associated with significant adverse effects [11, 12, 13, 14] .",

It is conceivable that pharmacological modulation of TLR and/or RLR signal transduction pathways may alter the cytokine profile induced by the PRR agonists and thus differentially promote the beneficial innate immune response, but limit the detrimental effects. In our effort towards discovery of molecules with such a pharmacological property, we identified RO 90-7501, a compound that was originally reported as an inhibitor of the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) assembly in vitro [39] . RO 90-7501 selectively enhances TLR3 agonist-induced type I IFN production in both human kidney epithelia and macrophage cell lines (Fig. 7) , but does not promote NFkB activation and chemokine production. As expected, treatment of cells with RO 90-7501 significantly enhanced the antiviral activity of poly I:C (Fig. 8) .",

Interestingly, we showed that treatment of 293TLR3HA cells with RO 90-7501 was able to rapidly activate p38 MAPK, and to a lesser extent, ERK and JNK. Although the molecular target and signaling pathways leading to the activation of the MAPKs by RO 90-7501 remain to be determined, it is plausible that RO 90-7501 activation of p38 MAPK, which is essential for TLR3 agonist-induced IFN-b gene expression (Fig. 9) , may be responsible for its enhancement of TLR3/RLR response. Ironically, RO 90-7501 only enhances TLR3 response in the presence of its agonist, but fails in the condition that the cells were pretreated with the compound for 3 h, followed by treatment with poly I:C in its absence for an additional 9 h (Fig. 5) . These results imply that besides p38MAPK, an additional short-lived cellular response induced by RO 90-7501 may be also required for its innate immune enhancement activity.",

Interestingly, TLR3 agonists can elicit the production of a range of chemokines by tumor cells. While CCL5 blockade improved the efficacy of immunochemotherapy, CXCR3 blockade abolished its beneficial effects. Therefore, this work shows that the opposing innate immune responses mediated by chemokines can be pharmacologically modulated to enhance the anticancer efficacy of TLR3 agonists.",
