Recent studies have shed light into the role of microRNAs (miRNAs), small noncoding RNAs of length ranging from 18-23 nucleotides (nt), as critical modulators in the host-pathogen interaction networks. We previously showed that miRNA miR-181b can inhibit MEV replication by repression of viral non-structural protein 1 expression. Here, we report that two other miRNAs (miR-320a and miR-140) inhibit MEV entry into feline kidney (F81) cells by downregulating its receptor, transferrin receptor (TfR), by targeting the 3\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) of TfR mRNA, while being themselves upregulated.",

Transferrin receptor (TfR), is required for the import of iron into the cell, and is regulated by intracellular iron concentration. It has also been reported to be a receptor for MEV, controlling the first step in the viral infection process. TfR can be considered a model for the endocytosis and recycling of receptor-ligand complexes: it is excluded from lipid raft domains in the plasma membrane and is taken up rapidly from the cell surface via clathrin-mediated endocytosis [1, [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . Since TfR plays an important role in MEV infection, we therefore investigated whether miRNAs participate in the hostvirus interaction by modulating its activity.",

To further ascertain that the binding sites of the predicted miRNAs in TfR 3\u2032UTR indeed existed, tetranucleotide mutations were generated in the two potential target sites of pGL3-TfR 3\u2032UTR using PCR, resulting in mut320a-pGL3-TfR 3\u2032UTR (5\u2032-CACTAG ATTTCTTTAGGCAGCACGAATTAATACAGGGTAGG TAC-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GTACCTACCCTGTATTAATTCGTGC TGCCTAAAGAAATCTAGTG-3\u2032) and mut140-pGL3-TfR 3\u2032UTR (5\u2032-CTTCAAGTTAAAGTGAATAAGGTGT TAAAAATGTTCATGATAGAATC-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GATTCT ATCATGAACATTTTTAACACCTTATTCACTTTAACT TGAAG-3\u2032).

Results showed that compared with transfection with NC inhibitors, both miR-320a and miR-140 inhibitors attenuated the inhibitory effect on TfR expression levels ( Figure 3D ).

            "text": "MiR-320a and miR-140 target the 3\u2032UTR of TfR and physically bind to TfR mRNA in the RISC To confirm that miR-320a and miR-140 directly target TfR 3\u2032UTR and show inhibitory activity, a reporter vector pGL3-TfR 3\u2032UTR containing the potential target (D) qPCR was used to assess the TfR mRNA levels after 36 h transfection with miR-320a and miR-140 mimics in a dose-dependent manner (E) Western blot assay was used to assess the TfR protein levels after 48 h transfection with miR-320 and miR-140 mimics in a dose-dependent manner. Data are from 3 independent experiments (mean \u00b1 SD). Statistical significance was analyzed by Student's t test; *P <0.05; **P <0.01; ns, not significant. segment in the 3\u2032UTR of the luciferase gene was constructed ( Figure 4A ). After co-transfection of F81 cells with pGL3-TfR 3\u2032UTR and miR-320a or miR-140 mimics, the relative luciferase activity was measured. As predicted, both miR-320a and miR-140 significantly inhibited the relative luciferase activity (by more than half ) in comparison with NC mimics ( Figure 4B ). To further ascertain the necessary function of complementary seed sequence, mut320a-pGL3-TfR 3\u2032UTR and mut140-pGL3-TfR 3\u2032UTR, with mutated tetranucleotides were constructed and the corresponding mut miR-320a and mut miR-140 mimics were synthesized ( Figure 4A ). As expected, after co-transfection of F81 cells, miR-320a and miR-140 mimics had no effect on the relative expression activity of the mutant reporter vector, but mut miR-320a and mut miR-140 mimics downregulated them by more than 2-fold ( Figure 4C,D) . To provide evidence for the physical interaction of the two miRNAs with TfR mRNA, immunoprecipitation with Argonaute 2 (Ago2) was performed. As previously described [35] , both mRNA degradation and translation repression is dependent on RISC, in which the most important factor is Ago2 protein. Therefore, anti-Ago2 antibody was used to test if the two miRNAs and TfR mRNA were associated with Ago2. As expected, when Ago2 protein was specifically precipitated by anti-Ago2 antibody, as compared with normal IgG, TfR was enriched more than 3-fold by miR-320a and more than 2-fold by miR-140 after transfection with miR-320a or miR-140 mimics respectively, whereas following transfection with mut miR-320a or mut miR-140, TfR was not enriched ( Figure 4E ). Altogether, these results indicate that miR-320a and miR-140 target the 3\u2032UTR of TfR and physically bind to TfR mRNA in the RISC.",

Indeed, TfR has been established as a gatekeeper for regulating iron uptake by most cells, and the transferring-to-cell endocytic pathway has been characterized in detail [41] . TfR is central to the uptake of iron-loaded transferrin [42] which is post-transcriptionally regulated via iron-responsive elements present in its 3\u2032UTR [43] . In addition to its role in erythropoiesis, TfR is also overexpressed in the majority of malignancies [44] and is directly linked to cell proliferation [45] [46] [47] . Studies have demonstrated that parvovirus replication is dependent on host cellular division and proliferation ( [48] ; Tattersa [49] ) and vigorous proliferative activity of host cells promotes parvoviral replication. Reduction in cellular metabolic activity, therefore, may explain why downregulation of TfR inhibits MEV replication. There may, however, be another mechanism. TfR is necessary for MEV uptake by host cells: downregulation may therefore render infected cells less susceptible to superinfection with additional MEV particles. While it may take only one virion to establish a primary infection, a multiply-infected cell may produce more infectious progeny. Downregulation of TfR on the cell surface, therefore, may result in diminished production of virus.",

As summarized in Figure 7 , a simple pathway of host-virus interaction network involving TfR and miRNAs has been deduced. These results provide further understanding of the mechanisms in MEV infection and may be helpful for development of endogenous miRNA antiviral therapy strategies.",
