During 2007, the complete coding sequences of six previously unknown and highly divergent HRV strains were reported. To catalogue the molecular and clinical features distinguishing the divergent HRV strains, we undertook, for the first time, in silico analyses of all available polyprotein sequences and performed retrospective reviews of the medical records of cases in which variants of the prototype strain, HRV-QPM, had been detected.",

Structure-based amino acid alignments identified conserved motifs shared among members of the genus Rhinovirus as well as substantive deletions and insertions unique to the divergent strains. Deletions mostly affected regions encoding proteins traditionally involved in antigenicity and serving as HRV and HEV receptor footprints. Because the HRV A2 strains cannot yet be cultured, we created homology models of predicted HRV-QPM structural proteins. In silico comparisons confirmed that HRV-QPM was most closely related to the major group HRVs. HRV-QPM was most frequently detected in infants with expiratory wheezing or persistent cough who had been admitted to hospital and required supplemental oxygen. It was the only virus detected in 65% of positive individuals. These observations contributed to an objective clinical impact ranging from mild to severe.",

Species classification was initially based on the susceptibility of strains to capsid binding antivirals [5, 6] and subsequently confirmed by phylogenetic studies [4, 7] . HRVs are also subdivided by receptor usage; major group HRVs use an intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1; n = 88 strains), which interacts within a depression of the viral surface known as the canyon [8] . Minor group HRVs (n = 12) receive a molecule from the low density lipoprotein receptor family (LDLR) at protrusions along the 5-fold axis of the capsid surface [9] [10] [11] [12] . Recently, heparan sulphate was identified as a pH dependent, low efficiency receptor for HRV-54 [13] . A relationship between receptor usage and species identity is only evident among minor group HRVs; all are HRV As. Major group HRVs reside in both species. Studies have identified four neutralizing immunogenic sites on the surface of a major group HRV (HRV-14; NImIA, NImIB, NImII and NImIII) [14] and three sites on a minor group HRV (HRV-2; site A, B and C) [15] , with some overlap [16] . These sites consist of discontinuous amino acid sequence within VP1, VP2 and VP3.",

This is in stark contrast to the HEVs for which recombination in the non-structural regions is a significant contributor to viral diversification [27, 28] . Untypeable rhinoviruses have been described using PCR-based tools, since 1994 [29] but it was only in 2007 that the complete coding sequences of a number of novel and apparently divergent HRV strains were reported, permitting a for identification of the first new strains in two decades [30] . The initial strain described, HRV-QPM, was identified from children with presenting symptoms often suggesting bronchiolitis [31] . Subsequently, 'HRV-Xs' were found in an adult asthma study in the United States [32] and 'HRV-Cs' were described from a study of pediatric infection by human bocavirus in Hong Kong [33] . Some notable features associated with these six putative viruses include the reliance upon molecular methods for their detection, their apparent endeminicity, their failure to produce cytopathic effects in culture, their frequent detection in subjects with expiratory wheezing and their limited sequence identity with existing HRV strains but high shared sequence identity. Studies employing subgenomic sequences proposed that there were many of these putative viruses occupying a distinct position within the genus Rhinovirus, which we collectively called HRV A2 [34] . It has been proposed that these strains may constitute a new picornavirus species [33] . Data have not yet been presented which appropriately address classification using current ICTV criteria and the scope of the clinical impact of these divergent strains has not yet been studied in detail. Because it appears that the members of this clade are frequently associated with LRT illness we sought to better characterise them in the hope of finding features that might prove useful in predicting the outcome of HRV A2 infection.",

            "text": "Although identifiable using amino acid alignments [33] , the scope and impact of the many HRV A2 sequence deletions could not be fully qualified or quantified in this form. However, the inability to isolate the HRV A2 strains in vitro will hinder crystallography studies seeking to identify structural features, so we created structure-based alignments of the VP1-4 sequences from the prototype HRV A2 strain, HRV-QPM and used them to predict the presence of a-helices and b-sheets. These were identified in the eight, anti-parallel b-sheet 'jellyroll' conformation common among picornavirus proteins VP1, VP2 (including the EF 'puff') and VP3 [39] (Figure 2 ). Deletions in the VP1 protein imparted the most dramatic changes, reducing the protrusion of the BC, DE and HI loops compared with the other HRVs and introducing an additional C-terminal sheet-loop-sheet structure (arrow, Figure 2B ). Similar deletions were noted in all HRV A2 strains but only HRV-C026 was predicted to encode a similar, Cterminal structure in VP1. We next assembled the HRV-QPM structural proteins into a protomer by associating them with the closest sequence match (HRV-16) and then replicated this structure in silico into a viral pentamer. RMSD values were derived from the VP1, VP2 and VP3 structures of all HRVs with crystallography-derived data available (HRV-1A, -2, -3, -14 and -16) and compared to the predicted HRV-QPM structure. HRV-QPM and HRV-16 shared the highest conformational similarity (0.145, 0.142 and 0.147 \u00c5 for the VP1, VP2 and VP3 structures respectively), reflecting the use of HRV-16 in predicting the structure HRV-QPM. The poorest agreements were between HRV-1A and HRV-3 in VP1 (0.793 \u00c5 ) and VP3 (0.740 \u00c5 ) and between HRV-2 and HRV-14 in VP2 (0.697 \u00c5 ). At the ICAM-1 footprint, HRV-QPM values ranged from 0.064-0.106 \u00c5 and 0.709-0.779 \u00c5 in comparison to the same regions on HRV-16 and -14, respectively. Values could not be determined for HRV-2 because of the impact of deletions. We also examined the conformational agreement between an HEV footprint e.g. the CAR site employed by CV-B3, and the predicted HRV-QPM structure. A space filling model of the pentamer was next used to display SimPlot data in order to visualise regions of sequence conservation and diversification with a focus on the major (ICAM-1; Figure 3A ) and minor (VLDL-R; Figure 3C ) group domains. Overall, greater sequence identity was apparent between HRV-2 than HRV-14 reflecting the genomic similarity to HRV A strains, however within the domains defining HRV groups, HRV-QPM was most similar in its antigenic sites to the major group representative, HRV-14. Most sequence diversity was found in the VP2 protein while the most conserved protein in these comparisons was VP3.",

Secondly, HRV A2 genomes exhibited #2.5% variation in G+C composition compared to HEV C and HEV D and ,5% compared to HEV A and HEV B. Thirdly, HRV-and HEV-like protease cleavage sites and locations suggested similar proteolytic processing ( Figure 1A ).

Because these strains formed a distinct clade within the existing HRV As, we previously assigned to all Australian and similar New York strains, the title of HRV A2 [31] . Kistler et al. identified similarly divergent strains [32] and Lau et al. used sequence-based criteria to propose that some HRV A2-like strains could be classified as a new species [33] . Our ongoing efforts to characterise additional HRVs led us to catalogue the distinguishing molecular and clinical features of these HRV A2-like strains and to better address their taxonomic placement. We undertook in silico analyses, for the first time using all complete HRV A2 coding sequences and performed a retrospective review of the medical records of cases from which variants of the prototype strain, HRV-QPM, had been previously detected. To date the studies reported herein are the first of their kind to have been conducted on a single HRV strain.",

Average HRV A2 G+C content (42.4%) fell between the rhinovirus (38.7%) and enterovirus (45.6%) genera, suggesting an intermediate evolutionary path for HRV A2 strains. Nonetheless, a large number of HRV motifs, including those recognized by the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, were retained by HRV A2 strains. This supported the proposal that some HRV genomic regions are under purifying selection [26] , even among the newly identified and divergent strains. HRV A2 strains were most similar to the HRV As overall, but amino acid sequences were as different from any traditional HRV or HEV species as the species in those genera were from each other. Previous subgenomic HRV A2 nucleotide phylogenies [31] [32] [33] were confirmed and expanded herein reinforcing that these NIVs reside within a distinct clade of the genus Rhinovirus, branching from the existing HRV A species ( Figure 6 ). The inability to propagate an HRV A2 virus could be due to many factors including the age, storage, site of origin and amount of the inoculum, its handling during processing, how long after symptoms appear before sampling occurs and the culture conditions used. It is also possible that an unknown primary receptor is employed or that binding of a secondary receptor is required for successful viral attachment and entry; or a mix of both. We sought to approach receptor-related issues using homology models derived crystallography data which already exist for a small number of HRV strains. Models of the component structural proteins from the prototypical HRV A2 strain, HRV-QPM, predicted that the characteristic 'jellyroll' conformations were retained (Figure 2 ) despite frequent and distinguishing deletions and inter-and intra-genus diversity at the sites of receptor contact and antigenicity (Figure 3 ). This also supported findings that HRV variability is mostly localized to receptor and antigenic sites [24, 33, 45] and begins to extend the data to include the more divergent strains.",

The comparative reduction in size of protrusions along the 5-fold axis, resulting from deletions in the BC, DE and HI loops of the HRV-QPM VP1, together with structure-altering deletions and substitutions affecting some antigenic sites previously identified from a minor group strain (HRV-2), particularly site A, lead us to propose that HRV A2 viruses are unlikely to behave as members of the minor group. Mapping the known ICAM-1 contact sites onto the predicted HRV-QPM structure revealed that most of the footprint was retained in structure by HRV-QPM, although it differed in sequence compared to other major group strains. SimPlot data revealed that sequence variation was not uncommon among strains within the major groups. Two small a-helices predicted to form in the HRV-QPM VP1 and VP3 footprints may disrupt receptor binding but since ICAM-1 is predicted to attach at differing angles in different HRV strains [8] , it may be suitably flexible to overcome such obstacles. Although NImIA and NImIB, first identified in a major group virus (HRV-14), were affected by the deletions in VP1, additional support for HRV-QPM belonging to the major HRV group came from structural similarities in the NImII (VP2) and NImIII (VP3). Amino acid substitutions occurred at these sites (ERG and GRT respectively) rather than insertions or deletions. These variations may result in distinct immunogenicity.",

            "text": "Recent findings by Bartlett et al have shown that once past the receptor, HRV replication can occur within non-human tissues [48] exemplifying the importance of receptors in moderating the potential for more widespread HRV replication and illness. The high detection frequency of HRV A2 strains from patients with acute LRT illness may be another indication that these divergent viruses employ a tissue-specific receptor or it may be that all HRV strains cause similar illness, they simply have not been subjected to sufficient individual study. The LDLR family of molecules are located on many tissues in many species [10] and yet all these locations do not, to our knowledge, host HRV replication. Identifying an HRV A2 receptor in vitro cell culture system will be important for empirically addressing receptor-and replicationrelated issues and the outcomes may have broad implications for what is currently known of the attachment, entry and replication of HRV strains. Based on our predictive in silico studies of HRV-QPM, an ICAM-like molecule may be an early candidate for the role of receptor. Future in silico studies could examine all available HRV polyprotein sequences to predict the extent of flexibility in receptor interactions 'normally' occurring in the major and minor groups. This would provide a context for the structural differences we observed in HRV-QPM. The sequence of most HRV genomes is unknown and our understanding of HRV structure is mostly due to crystallography data derived from less than 5% of HRV strains. There are limited structural data to support the wholesale extrapolation of receptor binding behaviour and capsid structure to the other HRV strains. Without data to the contrary, in silico analyses appear to provide a suitable surrogate to address this issue. By employing RMSD calculations to examine the conformational similarity between predicted HRV-QPM structures and those from HRV structures determined empirically, we could be confident that our predictions approximated experimental data. All comparative values (0.064-0.766 \u00c5 ) were well below the maximum resolution used to originally determine HRV crystal structures (2-3 \u00c5 [14,15,49] ). Comparison to an HEV footprint also returned values below this threshold.",

In our experience (data not shown), the earliest PCR-based methods [50] are already efficient at detecting these divergent strains. By extrapolating from published subgenomic sequence data, this clade is populated by a great number of divergent strains which are distributed both geographically and temporally, suggesting an endemic aspect to these previously uncharacterised viruses. No evidence exists to suggest that the HRV A2 strains are emerging viruses, rather it appears that they are newly identified strains that have been contributing to respiratory illness, in the absence of detection using culture-based diagnostic methods, for many years. There has now arisen a need for reliable protocols to characterise these putative viruses but in the absence of an HRV A2 isolate, neutralization, acid sensitivity and antiviral susceptibility studies, important for taxonomic placement, cannot be obtained. We have catalogued a series of features using methods which, while requiring further validation, contribute to our understanding of the biology and pathogenesis of HRV A2 strains. Additional molecular approaches will also be useful to classify other recently described divergent HRV strains [51] . Our data demonstrated that the newly identified HRVs, residing within the HRV A2 clade, do not satisfy the criteria for assignment to any existing HRV or HEV species and most likely constitute one or more novel species in the current genus Rhinovirus, tentatively called Human rhinovirus C (HRV C).",

Improved diagnostic methods, the broader application of existing PCR technology, new sequence data and many new insights have greatly enhanced our understanding of human rhinoviruses and the selective pressures impacting on their evolution [25, 26] . Similarly, the identification of a putative new HRV species, HRV C, the characterisation of HRV-QPM's molecular features and epidemiology and the identification of similar viruses around the world [31, 34, 52] have potential to reinvigorate HRV research. We found that the variants of one strain of the HRV Cs, HRV-QPM, sought in a well characterised population of specimens collected over all months of a single year, were more often associated with LRT illness than is commonly reported. The illness frequently presented as exacerbation of expiratory wheezing or persistent cough, with a requirement for supplemental oxygen, steroids and bronchodilator treatments. Despite exhaustive PCR-based investigation for other respiratory viral causes in our previous retrospective studies [31, 41] , HRV-QPM detection, in the absence of any other pathogen, occurred among infants with mild, moderate and severe (in both instances) LRT illness and most cases (88.2%) were admitted to hospital. Associated illness was usually (92.3% of the time) scored as mild to moderate and 58.8% of the HRV-QPM positive cases were children aged 12 months or less. The same age group represented 43.2% of the total study population originally screened for HRV-QPM (n = 1,244). While it is to be expected that a paediatric hospital-based population would overestimate the severity of HRV C clinical impact compared to a communitybased study, our study may in fact better represent the impact of first infection with HRV strains, the major pathogens detected during the first year of life [53] .",

Proteins VP1 to VP3 were aligned and threaded through HRV-16 (1ayn1, 1ayn2, 1ayn3 respectively) and VP4 through HRV-14 (1na1).
