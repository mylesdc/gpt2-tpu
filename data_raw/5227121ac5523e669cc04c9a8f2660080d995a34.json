As such, a candidate SARS vaccine should elicit broad CD8+ T-cell immune responses. Several groups of mice were immunized alone or in combination with SARSnucleocapsid immunogen. A high level of specific SARS-CD8+ T-cell response was demonstrated in mice that received DNA encoding the SARS-nucleocapsid, protein and XIAP as an adjuvant. We also observed that co-administration of a plasmid expressing nucleocapsid, recombinant protein and montanide/CpG induces high antibody titers in immunized mice. Moreover, this vaccine approach merits further investigation as a potential candidate vaccine against SARS.",

Previous studies in other coronavirus members suggest that this protein is highly immunogenic and could be a good target for the design of an effective vaccine [7] [8] [9] [10] . The expression of NC in CHO cells led to the observation that this protein folds spontaneously into viral-like particles (VLPs). These particles are effectively incorporated at several stages of the virus life cycle, including assembly, budding from cells, and receptor-binding leading to membrane fusion. The viral particles also present antigens to the immune system in a structure that mimics the infectious virion [11] [12] [13] .",

The groups DNA+XIAP, DNA-NC and NC protein + montanide/CpG did not show a high number of spot forming cells (SFC). Potent IFN-\u03b3 responses were observed in mice immunized with combination of DNA-NC+NC protein and adjuvants ( Fig  6) . However, following substitution of adjuvant montanide/CpG with XIAP, SFCs were more than two fold higher (p = 0.01). Although, IFN-\u03b3 may be produced by both antigen-stimulated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, most likely the observed IFN-\u03b3 response was generated by effector CD8+ T-cells, since flow cytometry demonstrated CD8+ T cells as the main producers of IFN-\u03b3 in this study. We promoted the immune responses with adjuvants montanide ISA-51/CpG or XIAP. Montanide is a mineral oil based adjuvant that increases the immune response non-specifically [40, 41] . It has been tested in clinical trials and it has a good reactogenicity profile, making it an ideal adjuvant for human use. [42] [43] [44] . In an HIV vaccine candidate study, we showed that montanide can induce strong antibody titers against HIV-1 structural genes (gp120, gag and pol). CpG is also among the most frequently used experimental adjuvants; this adjuvant stimulates dendritic cells through Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9), inducing cell maturation and enhancing antigen presentation and Th1 responses. [45] [46] [47] . The combination of montanide and CpG was investigated in light of a recent study demonstrating that this combination is more effective than the use of any of the adjuvants alone [48] . A group of mice received XIAP as adjuvant based on the finding by Kim [16, 17] .",

NCspecific IFN-\u03b3 were detected as described in Materials and Methods. The mean \u00b1 S.D. is shown for each group. The symbol * indicates a significant difference (P = 0.01-0.001) between the indicated group and all other immunized groups. The symbol \u2020 indicates a significant difference (P < 0.05) between the indicated group and the control group (DNA+XIAP). In order to characterize specific immune responses in our candidate SARS vaccines, we used a recombinant protein expressed in bacteria for in vitro assays to detect CD4+ and CD8+T-cell responses, while the vaccine candidates contained a recombinant protein expressed in CHO cells. Ideally, peptides are used to stimulate CD8+effector responses, however, this is not yet feasible since NC CTL epitopes are not yet characterized in this strain of mice. It is likely that VLPs are processed by antigen presenting cells and the epitopes presented in an MHC I context, as suggested by the increased CD8+ T-cell responses observed post-vaccination.",

Two more studies analyzed humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in mice immunized with DNA vaccines expressing NC [50, 51] . Kim at al. showed that linkage of NC protein to calreticulin increased humoral and cellular immune responses in vaccinated mice compared to mice receiving DNA-NC alone. We did not detect a high level of CD8+ T cell immune response in mice immunized with DNA-NC or NC protein alone.

However, the absence of an effective therapeutic agent against this lethal virus, compounded by the threat of its re-emergence, has triggered research efforts to develop an effective vaccine. Previous studies indicate that the spike protein is responsible for the binding of the virus to angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [25-27]. The spike protein contains epitopes that might elicit neutralizing antibodies in the host species thus making it a good target for vaccine development against SARS [28-31]. However, mutation of this protein could affect the virulence by allowing the virus to escape from specific immune response[32,33]. Other research groups have made efforts to develop vaccines based on viral nucleocapsids since these viral proteins have conserved regions. Milich and McLachlan showed that the viral nucleocapsid contains T-cell dependent and independent epitopes. Nude (athymic) mice immunized with HBV-nucleocapsid alone develop high titers of IgM, IgG2a and IgG2b antibodies which are SARS-CoV-NC specific CD8+ T cell responses in mice immunized with the candidate SARS vaccinesFigure 5SARS-CoV-NC specific CD8+ T cell responses in mice immunized with the candidate SARS vaccines. Fresh peripheral blood cells from immunized mice were stimulated with various antigens and stained for CD8, CD3 and IFN-\u03b3 with labeled monoclonal antibodies. After staining, flow cytometry was used to analyze the NC-specific CD8+ T cells. A negative control (without stimulation) and a positive control (phorbol myristate acetate + ionomycin) were included to control for the spontaneous production of IFN-\u03b3.
