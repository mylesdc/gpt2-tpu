Peripheral lymphocytes, specifically CD8 T and B cells were significantly lower in aged monkeys pre-and post-SARS-CoV infection, while neutrophil and monocyte numbers were not impacted by age or infection status. Serum proinflammatory cytokines were similar in both age groups, whereas significantly lower levels of IL-1beta, IL-18, IL-6, IL-12 and IL-15 were detected in the lungs of SARS-CoV-infected aged monkeys at either 5 or 10 days post infection. Total lung leukocyte numbers and relative frequency of CD8 T cells, B cells, macrophages and dendritic cells were greatly reduced in the aged host during SARS-CoV infection, despite high levels of chemoattractants for many of these cells in the aged lung. Dendritic cells and monocytes/macrophages showed age-dependent differences in activation and chemokine receptor profiles, while the CD8 T cell and B cell responses were significantly reduced in the aged host. In examination of viral titers, significantly higher levels of SARS-CoV were detected in the nasal swabs early, at day 1 post infection, in aged as compared to juvenile monkeys, but virus levels were only slightly higher in aged animals by day 3. Although there was a trend of higher titers in respiratory tissues at day 5 post infection, this did not reach statistical significance and virus was cleared from all animals by day 10, regardless of age. Conclusions: This study provides unique insight into how several parameters of the systemic and mucosal immune response to SARS-CoV infection are significantly modulated by age. These immune differences may contribute to deficient immune function and the observed trend of higher SARS-CoV replication in aged nonhuman primates.",

Data suggests that immunosenescence may occur earlier in the mucosa than the systemic immune system with a dramatic shift, with age, in the proportion of distinct T cell subsets and a decrease in total B lymphocytes [3, 10] . Advanced age has also been associated with a reduction in antigen-specific IgA, an important protective antibody predominantly localized to the mucosa [9] . In addition to the immunological remodeling as a function of age, there are also major alterations in respiratory physiology. The aging lung has been shown to undergo structural changes which include a loss in static recoil forces, a stiffening of the chest cavity and diminished alveolar surface area, ultimately resulting in reduced vital capacity [11] [12] [13] . In addition, respiratory muscle strength consistently declines with age making it more difficult for an elderly person to breath even when not suffering from a respiratory infection.",

            "text": "It is well appreciated that pulmonary damage in SARS-CoV infection is caused by direct viral effects as well as immunopathological factors [15] , however the pathogenic mechanisms in the vulnerable aged populations remain poorly defined. Several aged animal models of SARS-CoV infection have been established to evaluate the response and elucidate mechanisms for increased SARS-CoV pathogenicity in the aged host. Recombinant infectious clones and mouse passaged isolates of SARS-CoV show increased severity of disease and lethality in aged as compared to young mice [19] [20] [21] . Interestingly, the aged and young hosts show similar levels of SARS-CoV replication in most experimental infections [22] . Thus the increased acute lung injury in SARS-CoVinfected aged animals is thought to be related to the over exuberant immune responses and not heightened viral-mediated damage. However, many aspects of the elderly immune response and how it may differ from the young adult are still unclear. Furthermore, our study represents one of only two SARS-CoV infection studies in aged nonhuman primates as almost all aged SARS-CoV experiments to date have been conducted in mouse models with mouse-adapted viral strains. Although murine models are often advantageous and informative, nonhuman primates may be better suited for studying the aging immune and respiratory systems. Unlike mice, nonhuman primates show a high level of genetic homology to humans, are not inbred, have longer life spans and their lungs are more structurally similar to humans than other laboratory animals [23] . Importantly, studies have shown that nonhuman primates undergo immune senescence similar to what has been described for humans [24, 25] . The aim of this study was to determine how the peripheral and mucosal immune responses to SARS-CoV infection compare in the aged and juvenile nonhuman primate host and to determine how this may impact viral replication levels. We report that SARS-CoV virus titers were significantly higher in the nasal cavity of aged monkeys at day 1 post infection but, by day 3, the difference in titers between age groups was negligible. Although SARS-CoV virus levels were similar in aged and juvenile monkeys at later time points post infection there were significant age-dependent differences in systemic and mucosal immune responses to SARS-CoV.",

Aged animals were roughly equivalent to 50 year old humans (n = 5 each time point post infection, n = 2 for mock-infected) [26, 27] while juvenile animals represented 6-12 year olds (n = 6 for all juvenile groups). Some of the virology, pathology and immunology data for the juvenile animals have been previously reported [28] but are included here for age-related comparisons. In examination of clinical features, all animals showed a slight initial decrease in body weight with SARS-CoV inoculation that rebounded by 3 d.p.i. (Figure 1A ; 2-way ANOVA for age and d.p.i.). Time post infection but not age was a significant source of variation for the fold change in body weight. Body temperature however, fluctuated throughout the infection time course and was significantly affected by age but not infection ( Figure 1B ; 2-way ANOVA for age and d.p.i.). SARS-CoV titers were measured in nasal swabs and in several respiratory tissues by plaque assays. Replicating virus was recovered from nasal swabs in 7 of the 10 aged animals at 1 d.p.i., in contrast to only one juvenile animal with detectable virus at this early time point ( Figure 1C ; 2-way ANOVA for age and d.p.i.). Day 1 was the only time point in which SARS-CoV replication was significantly different; by 3 d.p.i., virus levels were only slightly higher in aged animals and titers remained similar in both age groups out to day 5. No significant age-dependent differences in SARS-CoV levels were observed in standardized collected respiratory tissues at 5 d.p.i. ( Figure 1D ; 1-way ANOVA for age). However, the levels of virus tended to be higher in all tissues from the aged as compared to the juvenile animals, except in the proximal portion of the right caudal lung lobe. No virus was detected in any sample collected from either age group at 10 d.p.i.",

The severity of lung pathology was only slightly higher in aged as compared to juvenile animals at 5 d.p.i., and by 10 d.p.i., juvenile animals exhibited higher incidence and severity for most of the histologic changes. A marked increase in the incidence of interstitial pneumonia was observed in juvenile but not aged monkeys at 10 d.p.i. (83% in juvenile versus only 20% in aged).

Although no age-dependent differences were observed in the frequency of na\u00efve (CD45RA + CCR7+) CD8 T cells in peripheral blood, there were significantly lower levels of these cells in the lung and lymph node of aged animals during SARS-CoV infection ( Figure 6A -C; unpaired student T-tests). A similar trend was observed with proliferating and cytotoxic granzyme B + CD8 T cells which were lower in the lungs and lymph nodes of aged compared to their juvenile counterparts at most infection time points (Figure 6D -I; unpaired student Ttest). However, granzyme B + T cell levels tended to be higher in the peripheral blood of aged compared to juvenile animals, reaching significance at 1 d.p.i. (Figure 6G ; unpaired student T-test). To determine how the B cell response to SARS-CoV was impacted by age, anti-SARS-CoV antibodies were evaluated in the serum and lung. Serum neutralization assays revealed increased antibodies in all juvenile animals with SARS-CoV infection as early as 5 d.p.i. (Figure 7A ; 2-way ANOVA for age and d.p.i.).

Higher SARS-CoV titers may have been missed in the previous aged nonhuman primate experiment as 2 d.p.i. was their earliest sampling time point, [22] and by day 3 in our study, aged and juvenile infection levels were similar. Although we cannot be certain that we were measuring replicating virus and not virus delivered from the inoculum, the dramatic difference in the amount recovered suggests that the aged nasal epithelium may support higher levels of SARS-CoV, or that the nasal cavity drainage mechanisms are impaired in the aged host. Despite the early ageassociated differences in viral shedding at mucosal sites, by 5 d.p.i., levels of SARS-CoV in respiratory tract tissues were only slightly higher in the aged monkeys. Similar to previous reports, virus was not recovered from any animal at 10 d.p.i., suggesting that the kinetics of viral clearance may have been similar in both age groups.

Of the leukocyte populations in the blood, lymphocyte numbers were most dramatically affected by age, with flow cytometric results showing significantly reduced CD8 T cells and B cells in aged compared to juvenile monkeys. In contrast, peripheral cytokine responses showed only minimal age-related differences to SARS-CoV infection which may be related to the high variability, particularly in the aged group, which is consistent with previous reports in elderly rhesus monkeys [5, 25] . In regards to the mucosal inflammatory reactions, proinflammatory cytokines IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-15, IL-12 and IL-18 were all significantly lower in the lungs of SARS-CoV-infected aged animals at either day 5 or 10 post infection. In particular, the reduced levels of IL-1beta and IL-18 are in line with recent reports of impaired NLRP3 inflammasome function in elderly mice during influenza infection [35] . The low cytokine response in aged monkeys may also be a reflection of the reduced total inflammatory cell numbers found in the lungs of aged as compared to juvenile animals as cells and cytokines were evaluated in adjacent lung regions. Our data is not consistent with the exacerbated acute inflammatory responses shown to promote disease pathogenesis in aged SARS-CoV-infected mouse models [19, 21] . As we did not sample earlier than day 5 post infection in the lung, the increased inflammation in our aged monkeys may have been missed. Our sampling schedule may have also precluded collections at optimal inflammatory response time points, as a biphasic pattern occurring in waves, at day 2 and 7 post infection with mouse-adapted SARS-CoV strains has been described in aged rodents [20, 36] .

In comparing our results, there are several experimental design aspects to take into consideration, beyond differences in dose and route of SARS-CoV infection. First, cynomolgous macaques were used in the previous study whereas our SARS-CoV infection model utilizes African green monkeys. In addition, timing of lung sample collection differed between the two studies, days 2 and 4 were assessed in the cynomolgous macaques while days 5, and 10 post infection were evaluated in our study. Furthermore, a standardized lung collection scheme was used in our immunology and pathology analysis, to give a more comprehensive perspective whereas their study assessed gene changes in specific regions of high SARS-CoV replication. Despite the major differences in study design, there were several results that were comparable, including the similarity of SARS-CoV viral titers in the aged and juvenile lung at later infection time points (days 4 and 5). In addition, several chemokines, including CCL5, CXCL12 and CCL20 were significantly increased in the lungs of SARS-CoV-infected aged monkeys here, which is consistent with the finding of elevated chemokine signaling genes in the aged lungs of cynomolgous macaques during SARS-CoV infection by microarray [22] .",

In examination of the kinetics of lung and lymph node cell expansion and/or trafficking following SARS-CoV infection, we found significantly reduced lung macrophages, DCs, CD8 T cells and B cells in the aged animals relative to their juvenile counterparts. Not only were there fewer lung macrophages and DCs in the aged animals, but the frequency of costimulatory CD86+ cells were also significantly reduced. In contrast, the lymph node reaction showed no age-specific differences. Interestingly, although lung leukocyte numbers were reduced in aged monkeys there were disproportionately high levels of the chemokines capable of recruiting these cells into the lung, CCL5, CXCL11, CXCL12 and CCL20. This prompted our examination of the expression of the corresponding ligandbinding receptors on peripheral blood leukocytes to determine if there were age-related differences in the migratory capacity of these cells into the lung. For CCL5 receptors, we found significantly reduced frequencies of CCR3 but not CCR1+ monocytes in aged animals and similar frequencies of CCR5+ CD8 T cells in both age groups. The frequency of aged DCs expressing the CCL20 receptor, CCR6 showed the most dramatic age-specific reduction which is reasonable, given that CCR6 is predominantly expressed by immature DCs and may reflect a reduction of these cells in our aged animals. The observed differences in lung chemokine and ligand receptor expression may reflect age-specific modulation of leukocyte trafficking into the lung. Although we did not confirm these observations with mechanistic in vitro experiments, previous studies have shown that DCs acquired from older individuals display significantly impaired ability to migrate in response to chemokines [38] .",

Not surprisingly, the proportion of na\u00efve CD8 T cells in the lung and lymph node was significantly reduced in aged compared to juvenile animals in SARS-CoV infection. This corresponded to significantly lower levels of CD8 T cell proliferation at these sites in aged animals as well. Interestingly, the frequency of cytotoxic enzyme positive (granzyme B) T cells was higher at 1 d.p.i. in the periphery of aged compared to juvenile animals. However, aged peripheral granzyme + T cell frequencies remained unchanged by SARS-CoV infection whereas juvenile cytotoxic T cells showed infectioninduced fluctuation. In contrast to peripheral blood, the lung and lymph node of aged animals had lower frequencies of granzyme + T cells compared to juvenile animals at 5 and 10 d.p.i.. The humoral response was also greatly reduced in aged SARS-CoV-infected monkeys with significantly reduced serum neutralizing antibodies and mucosal anti-SARS-CoV IgA in the aged host. This limited antibody response may be related to the dramatically reduced lung and peripheral B lymphocyte populations observed in the aged monkeys which is consistent with reports in elderly humans [39] . Despite the deficiencies observed in the aged adaptive responses, viral titers were only significantly higher in aged monkeys at day 1 post infection. This suggests that innate or other compensatory immune responses are sufficient for viral control in aged monkeys and serves to further support the minimal involvement of cytotoxic T cells and neutralizing antibodies in SARS-CoV clearance as demonstrated in mouse depletion models [36] .",

We observed significant age and infection-dependent differences in both the systemic and mucosal immune compartments with more dramatic changes in cytokine levels and leukocyte frequencies in lung as compared to peripheral blood and tracheobronchial lymph nodes. In regards to the exacerbated SARS-CoV responses previously reported in aged nonhuman primates, we did not observe enhanced host immunity or pathology in our aged monkeys. Instead, we detected less inflammatory cytokines and total lung leukocytes, as well as reduced adaptive responses with increased age. Although our results are discrepant, both studies indicate that pulmonary immunity is intrinsically different in the aged as compared to the juvenile host, warranting further exploration given the important implications this has for vaccine and therapeutic design for the elderly.",

A permit to import the animals into New Mexico was acquired through the Fish and Wildlife Service by LRRI. The aged African green monkeys were determined to be~10-20 yrs old while the remaining subjects were young adults (~2-6 years old). Additionally, two female African green monkeys of 17 yrs and 18 yrs were acquired from the Wake Forest University Primate Center (Medical Center Boulevard, Winston-Salem). As there is an estimated 3.2fold difference for relating age between humans and rhesus macaques [26, 27] , the aged African green monkeys in our study are expected to represent approximately, 50 year old humans while the juvenile African green monkeys correspond to 6-12 year olds. The rhesus-to-human age conversion was used given that the estimated age conversion is not as well established for African green monkeys and there is 95% genetic similarity [40] between the two Old World monkey species belonging to the Super Family Cercopithecoidea. Randomization and group assignments for the aged monkey studies were performed with Provantis Integrated Preclinical Software (Instem Life Science Systems Ltd.). All monkeys were quarantined for 6 weeks prior to the study, during which they were tested for tuberculosis. Animals were given a subcutaneous microchip for identification and temperature measurements (IPTT-300 implantable temperature transponder and a WRS-6007 Handheld Wireless Reader System (Bio Medic Data Systems, Inc, Seaford, Delaware)). During the infectious portion of the study, animals were individually housed indoors in stainless steel cages with wire mesh bottoms. Temperature and humidity ranges were controlled along with 12 h light and dark cycles. Animals were also given environmental enrichment including toys twice per day. Tap water from the institutional watering system was available ad libitum and animals were fed twice a day Harlan Teklad Certified 20% Monkey Diet (4 to 6 biscuits/kg body weight) with bananas or apples for enrichment 3 times per week.",

Of note, the samples for flow cytometric analysis and cytokine protein evaluation were acquired from adjacent tissue regions. Single cell suspensions were prepared as detailed in [28] . Briefly, mechanical and enzymatic digestion with Liberase (Roche, Pleasanton, CA) and DNAse (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) solution was performed prior to overlaying samples on a Percoll (Sigma) gradient for 20 min at 500 \u00d7 g with no brake. Tracheobronchial lymph nodes were collected in a standardized manner in which the same region and size of tissue was collected from each animal. Single-cell suspensions were made by mechanical disruption. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from heparinized blood with a Ficol-Hypaque (Sigma) gradient as previously reported [41] . All flow cytometric analysis was conducted on previously frozen PBMC, lung or lymph node leukocytes. The following antibodies were used in 4-or 6-color staining panels: CD3 (clone SDP34-2); CD8 (clone SK1); CD11c (clone SHCL-3); CD14 (clone M5E2); CD20 (clone L27); CD68 (clone KP1, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Dallas, TX); CD86 (clone 2331Fun1); Granzyme B (clone GB11, Invitrogen, Carlsbad CA); HLA-DR (clone L243); Ki67 (clone B56); CCR1 (clone 53504); CCR3 (clone 61828); CCR5 (clone 3A9); CCR6 (clone 11A9) and CCR7 (clone 150503, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) all conjugated to fluorochromes FITC, PE, PerCP, PerCpCy5.5, APC, PECy7, Alexa647 or APCCy7 (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA unless specified). For intracellular antigens, BD FACS lyse and permeabilization solutions were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. CD4 was not assessed given the downregulation of this marker on African green monkey T lymphocytes [42] [43] [44] . Antibody-stained samples were fixed for 16 hr in 1% paraformaldehyde and 3% FBS in phosphate buffered saline. Sample data were acquired on a FACS-Calibur or FACS-Canto flow cytometer instrument (BD Biosciences) and data files analyzed utilizing FlowJo software 7.6.1 (TreeStar, Medford, OR). For all flow cytometric analysis, within one experiment, the gates applied to each sample were identical (See gating strategies in Additional file 1: Figure S1 , Additional file 2: Figure S2 and Additional file 4: Figure S3 ). When appropriate and possible, similar gates were used across the two different experiments (juvenile and aged samples). However, based on changes to flow cytometer settings and fluorescence minus one controls, some gates were adjusted between the two experiments. Markers were chosen for characterization of specific leukocyte subsets in PBMC, lymph node, and lung based on previously published studies in humans or nonhuman primates [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] .",

For homogenization, a volume of RPMI media (Gibco, Life Techologies, Grand Island, NY) equal to 10% of the lung tissue weight was added. SARS-CoV IgG and IgA antibodies were measured by ELISA detailed in [28] . Briefly, ELISA plates were coated with purified recombinant SARS-CoV S protein in carbonatecoating buffer (S protein NR-686 obtained through NIH Biodefense and Emerging Infections Research Resources Repository) and nonspecific binding blocked with Power-Block (Biogenex, San Ramon CA). Starting at a 1:25 dilution, serially diluted lung tissue homogenate supernatants (clarified by centrifugation) were incubated on S-protein coated plates overnight at 37\u00b0C. An anti-monkey IgG or IgA HRP-conjugated antibody (KPL Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) was applied followed by substrate development with ABTS Microwell peroxidase substrate system (KPL) and absorbance reading at 405 nm using a Thermo Electron Corporation plate reader (Thermo Electron Corporation, Houston, TX). Data was acquired with Ascent software (Ascent Software, London, UK) and the ELISA antibody titer recorded for each sample was the reciprocal of the highest dilution in which the optical density (O.D.) reading for S-protein bound wells was at least two-fold higher than that of the nonfat milk control. The O.D. of the highest titer chosen also had to fall within the linear range of the serial dilutions.",
