This study's aim was to examine the views of lay people in Guinea on the acceptability of community quarantine. From June to August 2016, 302 adults indicated the acceptability of quarantine in 36 scenarios varying as a function of four factors: the infectious disease's level of contagiousness, its level of lethality, the number of cases in the community and whether persons in quarantine are provided with support services. Five clusters were identified: (1) for 18% of the participants, quarantine is never acceptable; (2) 16% considered, in contrast, that quarantine is always acceptable; (3) for 14%, it depends on the disease's level of contagiousness and lethality; (4) 36% based their judgement not only on the levels of contagiousness and lethality, but also on whether those in quarantine are provided with support services; and (5) 16% had no opinion. Interventions to increase voluntary compliance with community quarantine in Guinea must not be 'one size fits all', but must be multifaceted and tailored in design and implementation to match the diversity of people's concerns and needs.",

During the 2014-2016 Ebola epidemic in West Africa, with no effective vaccines or treatment, the most affected West African countries -Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinearesorted to community quarantine as the mainstay means to control the spread of Ebola [3, 4] . Such measures were, however, opposed by some communities who reacted hostilely [5] [6] [7] , which in turn prompted local authorities to resort to violence [6] [7] [8] . In Liberia, for instance, soldiers and armed police were deployed to quell a community opposed to quarantine, with one boy shot dead and many injured [7] .",

Others object that it is unfair to justify the use of quarantine solely on the basis of public health interests. They hold that individual persons should be valued as ends in themselves and should never be used as a means for public health ends [17] . Bensimon and Upshur argue that in the world in which quarantine was first conceived and enforced, individuals had an obligation to respect restrictive measures, but that in today's fundamentally different democratic societies, individuals have the right to protest such deprivation of liberty [2] . Furthermore, while the effectiveness of quarantine remains uncertain, numerous post-epidemic investigations have shown harmful consequences in those quarantined: symptoms of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder [18] , experiences of stigma [19] , social isolation [20] and loss of household income [21] .",

Its purpose was not to study the participants' views of the quarantine measures implemented in Guinea during the 2014-2016 Ebola epidemic. The study's purpose was also not epidemiological, i.e. it did not try to provide accurate estimates of the percentages of lay people in Guinea who would see quarantine as acceptable or not and for what reasons. Instead, its purpose was psychologicalto map the various positions taken by different groups of people. This knowledge could in turn provide insights about the design and implementation of tailored interventions that could increase voluntary compliance with community quarantine.",

We presented participants with vignettes depicting the implementation of quarantine measure in a community affected by a communicable disease epidemic, and instructed them to indicate the extent to which such a measure would be acceptable to them. The vignettes were composed of combinations of different levels of four factors influencing perceptions of quarantine, as suggested by previous studies [3, 11, 14, 24] : (a) the infectious disease's level of lethality; (b) the disease's degree of contagiousness; (c) number of cases identified in the community; and (d) whether persons in quarantine are provided with basic support services. The validity of vignette methodology for empirical investigation of controversial and ethically challenging issues was supported by Ulrich and Ratcliffe [25] , by Mah et al. [26] and by Wainwright et al. [27] . According to Ulrich and Ratcliffe [25] , the vignette technique makes it possible to assess how cues are weighted, how they are combined and how different groups of participants differ in weighting and combining. One condition for examining the processes of weighting and combining, independently of other processes, is that each participant has the same information presented in the same way. The vignette technique has already been used in several studies on ethically challenging issues in Africa, such as resorting to criminal law as a means to control HIV epidemic [28] , allocation of scarce medical resources [29] and physicians' duty to provide care during Ebola epidemics [30] .",

The present study examined the views of lay people in Guinea on the acceptability of community quarantine and found different positions, consistent with similar diversity among commentators in the literature [17, 22, 23] : (1) for 18% of the participants, quarantine measures are never acceptable, even when the disease is highly lethal and contagious, its incidence is high, and support services are provided; (2) 16% considered, in contrast, that resorting to quarantine as a means to control the spread of an infectious disease is always acceptable; (3) for 14%, it depends on the disease's level of contagiousness and lethality; and (4) 36% based their judgement not only on the levels of contagiousness and lethality, but also on whether those in quarantine are provided with support services. The other participants (16%) did not take a clear position on the issue, irrespective of circumstances. This spread of views echoes the findings of previous studies on attitudes towards the use of community quarantine in public health emergencies in Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and the USA [24] and in Canada [11] ; and reflects the controversial debate on the issue [2, 17] . Most of the participants (66%) understood that, even though community quarantine is a curtailment of individual liberties, it can be justified if three criteria are met: (1) infected persons are contagious; (2) the disease is lethal in most cases; and (3) those Fig. 1 . Patterns of results corresponding to four of the five clusters: \"Never Acceptable\", \"Depends on Support, Contagiousness, and Lethality\", \"Depends on Contagiousness and Lethality\", and \"Always Acceptable\". In each panel, 1) the judged acceptability of quarantine is on the y-axis; 2) the three levels of the disease's level of lethality and the two levels of contagiousness are on x-axis; C10: The disease is moderately contagious and its fatality rate is about 10%; C50: The disease is moderately contagious and its fatality rate is about 50%; C90: The disease is moderately contagious and its fatality rate is about 90%; VC10: The disease is highly contagious and its fatality rate is about 10%; VC50: The disease is highly contagious and its fatality rate is about 50%; VC90: The disease is highly contagious and its fatality rate is about 90%; and 3) the two curves correspond to whether support services were provided or not.",

These findings are also consistent with Upshur's [23] ethical framework for the justification of quarantine measures. Accordingly, to engender acceptance and strong public support for community quarantine in future communicable disease epidemics, health authorities must demonstrate to the public that infected persons are really contagious (even before they are sick enough to seek medical care), that consequences of the disease may be severe, and that those in quarantine will be provided with support services.",

Many researchers questioned the appropriateness of the use of quarantine during that epidemic given that scientific evidence indicates that those infected with Ebola are not contagious until they display the symptoms of the illness [14, 15] . Reflecting on this controversial issue, Calain and Poncin charged that the aim of the quarantine was to control the movement not of people who had been exposed to Ebola but of people whom the authorities did not trust to report their symptoms [14] . The use of quarantine in this case was perceived by communities as an arbitrary enforcement [14] . The importance of the third criterionproviding those in quarantine with basic needs (e.g. food, water, medical supplies), lost income and means of communication with their relatives living outside the quarantine zonewas demonstrated by the role of support services in the high voluntary compliance with quarantine measures during the 2003 SARS epidemics in Taiwan, China [24] and Canada [44] . However, providing support services to quarantined communities may be challenging in low-resource countries in West Africa, where infrastructures are poor and health systems under-resourced. Indeed, during the 2014-2016 Ebola epidemic in West Africa, the unprecedented spread of the virus in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra-Leone has been linked to factors such as poor infrastructures, severe deficiencies in logistical and transport systems, and lack of investment in the purchase of needed supplies [45] . Thus, improvement in these factors would be clearly important to ensure the effectiveness of quarantine measures.",

            "text": "A group that opposed quarantine under all conditions was also found in South Korea in the context of the spread to South Korea in 2015 of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome [46] . While the researchers explained this attitude in South Korea by the respondents' specific belief that community quarantine may increase, rather than decrease, the spread of infections, the opposition of some people in Guinea to quarantine during the 2014-2016 Ebola epidemic can be explained, as suggested by Calain and Poncin [14] , by more general doubts about the effectiveness of and optimal use of social distancing measures. Indeed, contrary to many other public health interventionse.g. vaccination, sanitation and hygiene interventions, and promotion of healthy lifestylethe use of quarantine has generally lacked strong empirical validation of effectiveness [13] [14] [15] . Bensimon and Upshur recounted such concerns, noting that 'invoking quarantine raised difficult questions about the justifiability of an intervention that may or may not be effective' [2] . The opposition to quarantine can also be explained, as suggested by previous studies' findings in Guinea [36, 37] , by a general distrust of public health measures in the country. Thus, interventions to increase the acceptability of quarantine in future epidemics in Guinea should (a) use sound scientific evidence of effectiveness in a well-planned public education programme and (b) contain strategies aimed at building public trust in the institutions involved with Guinean public health. One possible approach may be the inclusion in the development and implementation of quarantine measures of trusted and credible community figures such as spiritual and traditional leaders as well as political leaders. These efforts would be appropriate responses as well to the small but significant group (16%) who did not take a position on the issue as a result, possibly, of being reluctant to show their opposition to an official policy, of being unwilling to take a clear position on such a controversial issue, or of not understanding the task.",

First, it used a convenience sample of only moderate size, restricted to participants who lived in Conakry, the capital city, and who could read and understand French. Therefore, our findings are not likely to be representative of the whole lay people in Guinea, which is largely rural and mostly illiterate. Future studies should examine the views of those other segments of lay people in Guinea. Second, it asked participants about fictional vignettes, not about real quarantined communities. The use of vignettes, however, is usefulit permits statistical analyses to reveal how people weight and combine separate factors. Third, while the use of names of real places in Guinea in the vignettes facilitated the design of realistic stories, this might have introduced a bias in the answers if participants could associate different scenarios with places they knew personally. Fourth, the researcher did not ask further questions to the respondents to elucidate the reasons underlying their viewpoints. Future follow-up studies using qualitative methods are needed to understand the respondents' justifications.",

The views of lay people in Guinea cannot be ignored in planning for and responding to future communicable disease epidemics since their compliance is vital to ensure the effectiveness of quarantine. Interestingly, this study's findings showed that the vast majority of respondents do not reject quarantine in an absolute manner; that is, when they are aware of the contagiousness and severity of the disease, and those in quarantine are provided with adequate support services, they see quarantine as acceptable. The diversity of positions, however, strongly suggests that, when resorting to quarantine as a means to control communicable disease epidemics, no one single strategy to promote voluntary compliance will be appropriate.
