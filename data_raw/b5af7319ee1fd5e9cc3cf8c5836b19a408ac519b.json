            "text": "Dihydropyrimidinase is a member of the cyclic amidohydrolase family, which also includes allantoinase, dihydroorotase, hydantoinase, and imidase. These metalloenzymes possess very similar active sites and may use a similar mechanism for catalysis. However, whether the substrates and inhibitors of other cyclic amidohydrolases can inhibit dihydropyrimidinase remains unclear. This study investigated the inhibition of dihydropyrimidinase by flavonoids and substrates of other cyclic amidohydrolases. Allantoin, dihydroorotate, 5hydantoin acetic acid, acetohydroxamate, orotic acid, and 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole could slightly inhibit dihydropyrimidinase, and the IC 50 values of these compounds were within the millimolar range. The inhibition of dihydropyrimidinase by flavonoids, such as myricetin, quercetin, kaempferol, galangin, dihydromyricetin, and myricitrin, was also investigated. Some of these compounds are known as inhibitors of allantoinase and dihydroorotase. Although the inhibitory effects of these flavonoids on dihydropyrimidinase were substrate-dependent, dihydromyricetin significantly inhibited dihydropyrimidinase with IC 50 values of 48 and 40 \u03bcM for the substrates dihydrouracil and 5-propyl-hydantoin, respectively. The results from the Lineweaver\u2212Burk plot indicated that dihydromyricetin was a competitive inhibitor. Results from fluorescence quenching analysis indicated that dihydromyricetin could form a stable complex with dihydropyrimidinase with the K d value of 22.6 \u03bcM. A structural study using PatchDock showed that dihydromyricetin was docked in the active site pocket of dihydropyrimidinase, which was consistent with the findings from kinetic and fluorescence studies. This study was the first to demonstrate that naturally occurring product dihydromyricetin inhibited dihydropyrimidinase, even more than the substrate analogs (>3 orders of magnitude). These flavonols, particularly myricetin, may serve as drug leads and dirty drugs (for multiple targets) for designing compounds that target several cyclic amidohydrolases. in the second step of the pyrimidine degradation pathway, respectively [1, 2] . Dihydropyrimidinase, a component in the chain of pyrimidine catabolism, is also capable of detoxifying xenobiotics with an imide functional group that ranges from linear imides to heterocyclic imides [3, 4, 5] and organic cyclic carbonates [6] . These different imide-hydrolyzing enzymes from microorganisms are normally known as hydantoinase because of their role as biocatalysts in the synthesis of D-and L-amino acids for the industrial production of the precursors of antibiotics [7, 8] . Although dihydropyrimidinase and hydantoinase generally have a similar active site, their overall sequence identity and substrate specificity differ [9] . Thus, some bacterial hydantoinases are still named and identified as dihydropyrimidinase because of the catalytic activity toward the natural substrates dihydrouracil and dihydrothymine.",

Even if these enzymes have similar functions, they have relatively low amino acid sequence identity. These metal-dependent enzymes catalyze the ring-opening hydrolysis of the cyclic amide bond of each substrate in either five-or six-membered rings in the metabolism of purines, pyrimidines, and many xenobiotics ( Fig 1A) [9, 11, 12, 13] . Almost all the active sites of dihydropyrimidinase, hydantoinase, allantoinase, and dihydroorotase contain four histidines, one aspartate, and one post-carboxylated lysine residue, which are required for metal binding and catalytic activity. The presence of a post-carboxylated lysine in hydantoinase is also required in binuclear metal center self-assembly [12] , and it increases the nucleophilicity of the hydroxide for catalysis [14] . Previous studies indicated that cyclic amidohydrolases should use a nearly identical mechanism for catalysis. However, the substrate selectivity and specificity of dihydropyrimidinase, hydantoinase, allantoinase, and dihydroorotase highly differ. For example, dihydroorotase does not hydrolyze dihydropyrimidine, hydantoin, and allantoin [15] . Fig 1. Substrate specificity of dihydropyrimidinase.

Dihydrouracil, 5-propyl-hydantoin, and phthalimide were used as substrates. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, dihydrouracil (2 mM) was used as the substrate in the standard assay of dihydropyrimidinase. Briefly, the decrease in absorbancy at 230, 248, and 298 nm was measured upon hydrolysis of dihydrouracil, 5-propyl-hydantoin, and phthalimide as the substrate at 25\u00b0C, respectively. To start the reaction, the purified dihydropyrimidinase (10-70 \u03bcg) was added to a 2 mL solution containing the substrate and 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Substrate hydrolysis was monitored with a UV/vis spectrophotometer (Hitachi U 3300, Hitachi High-Technologies, Tokyo, Japan). The extinction coefficient of each substrate was determined experimentally by direct measurement with a spectrophotometer. The extinction coefficients of dihydrouracil, 5-propyl-hydantoin, and phthalimide were 0.683 mM -1 cm -1 at 230 nm, 0.0538 mM -1 cm -1 at 248 nm, and 3.12 mM -1 cm -1 at 298 nm, respectively. The initial rates of change were a function of enzyme concentration within the absorbance range of 0.01-0.18 min -1 . A unit of activity was defined as the amount of enzyme catalyzing the hydrolysis of 1 \u03bcmol substrate/min, and the specific activity was expressed in terms of units of activity per milligram of enzyme. The kinetic parameters K m and V max were determined from a non-linear plot by fitting the hydrolyzing rate from individual experiments to the Michaelis-Menten equation (Enzyme Kinetics module of Sigma-Plot; Systat Software, Chicago, IL, USA).

Unlike A. radiobacter hydantoinase, the catalytic efficiency of this enzyme toward dihydrouracil was higher than that toward phthalimide (fourfold) and 5-propyl-hydantoin (100-fold).

Members of the cyclic amidohydrolase family have highly similar active sites, and may use the same catalytic mechanism for substrate hydrolysis [38] . This condition raises an interesting question as to whether the substrate and inhibitor of allantoinase and dihydroorotase can be a potential inhibitor of dihydropyrimidinase because of their structural similarity. Allantoin and dihydroorotate are not substrates for dihydropyrimidinase-catalyzed reactions (Table 3) . Allantoin and dihydroorotate are structurally similar to hydantoin and dihydrouracil, except for the 5' side chain ( Fig  1A) . To assess whether allantoin and dihydroorotate are dihydropyrimidinase inhibitors, allantoin and dihydroorotate were individually included in the standard assay using 5-propylhydantoin (Fig 2A) or dihydrouracil ( Fig 2B) as a substrate. Allantoin and dihydroorotate only slightly inhibited the activity of dihydropyrimidinase. Thus, substrates of other cyclic amidohydrolase may not be strong inhibitors of dihydropyrimidinase. To assess whether inhibitors or substrate analogs of allantoinase and dihydroorotase can be inhibitors of dihydropyrimidinase, 5-hydantoin acetic acid, acetohydroxamate, and orotic acid were used in this study. Similarly, 5-hydantoin acetic acid and acetohydroxamate (an inhibitor of allantoinase) could only slightly inhibit the activity of dihydropyrimidinase (Fig 2) . We also tested whether inhibitors of the metalloenzyme glutaminyl cyclase, namely, N-\u03c9-acetylhistamine, 3,5-diamino-1,2,4-triazole, and 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole [39, 40] , are potential inhibitors of dihydropyrimidinase, in which 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole at 100-750 mM affected enzyme activity (Fig 2) . High concentrations of these compounds were required to obtain significant inhibition of dihydropyrimidinase. Thus, inhibitors or substrate analogs of allantoinase, dihydroorotase, and glutaminyl cyclase were not potent inhibitors of dihydropyrimidinase.",

Although we found that dihydroorotate, 5-hydantoin acetic acid, and acetohydroxamate inhibited dihydropyrimidinase activity, their IC 50 values were at the millimolar range and higher than the K m values of dihydropyrimidinase, which were insufficient as potent inhibitors.

Furthermore, to study the structure-inhibition relationship with dihydropyrimidinase, the derivatives of myricetin, namely, dihydromyricetin (the ring does not contain a double bond but has additional two hydrogen atoms) and myricitrin (the ring is fused to an additional sugar block), were further used and tested (Fig 3A) .

Myricetin, quercetin, kaempferol, and galangin at different concentrations were included in the standard assay, and their IC 50 values were determined and compared to determine whether flavonols inhibit dihydropyrimidinase. Generally, the activities of dihydropyrimidinase toward dihydrouracil ( Fig 3B) and 5-propyl-hydantoin (Fig 3C) continued to decrease as the concentrations of the compound increased. However, these compounds caused distinct effects when different substrates were used. When dihydrouracil was used as a substrate, the inhibitory effects of myricetin and kaempferol on the activity of dihydropyrimidinase were significant; however, kaempferol only slightly inhibited the activity of Acetohydroxamate and 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole solutions, whose pH values, were pre-adjusted to pH 8. When using dihydrouracil as a substrate, some compounds at high concentrations were difficult to determine the inhibitory effect on the activity of dihydropyrimidinase using the spectrophotometric assay at 230 nm. dihydropyrimidinase toward 5-propyl-hydantoin (Fig 3C) . The effect of quercetin was insignificant. Overall, myricetin was found to strongly inhibit the hydrolysis of both dihydrouracil and 5-propyl-hydantoin catalyzed by dihydropyrimidinase. We further tested whether dihydromyricetin and myricitrin (Fig 3A) , derivatives of myricetin, can be inhibitors of dihydropyrimidinase. No effect was found when myricitrin was added into the standard assay using dihydrouracil and 5-propyl-hydantoin as substrates of dihydropyrimidinase. However, opposite to myricitrin, dihydromyricetin exhibited a significant inhibitory effect on the activities of dihydropyrimidinase for both substrates, even more than myricetin did (Fig 3B and 3C) . The IC 50 values of dihydromyricetin for dihydropyrimidinase determined from the titration curves using dihydrouracil and 5-propyl-hydantoin were 48 \u00b1 2 and 40 \u00b1 2 \u03bcM, respectively; myricetin yielded higher values of 83 \u00b1 3 and 63 \u00b1 3 \u03bcM, respectively. Based on the IC 50 values, the order of the inhibitory capability of the flavonoids for dihydrouracil was as follows: dihydromyricetin > kaempferol > myricetin > galangin > quercetin > myricitrin. Moreover, the order of the inhibitory capability of the flavonoids for 5-propyl-hydantoin was as follows: dihydromyricetin > myricetin > galangin > kaempferol > quercetin > myricitrin. Thus, for the first time, flavonols, especially dihydromyricetin, were established as novel inhibitors of dihydropyrimidinase. In addition, the inhibitory capabilities of these flavonols (at the \u03bcM range) were significantly higher than those of the substrate and inhibitor analogs (at the mM range) of dihydropyrimidinase.",

The crystal structure of P. aeruginosa dihydropyrimidinase has yet to be determined. We modeled the P. aeruginosa dihydropyrimidinase structure (S1 Fig) by homology modeling using SWISS-MODEL (http://swissmodel.expasy.org/) [34] . Human dihydropyrimidinase (PDB entry: 2VR2) was the first hit suggested as a template by the program. The amino acid sequences of human (with 519 aa) and P. aeruginosa dihydropyrimidinase (with 479 aa) shared 51% identity and 66% similarity (S2 Fig). We also used (PS) 2 , another bioinformatic tool, for structural modeling [35] . (PS) 2 (http://140.113.239.111/~ps2v2/docs.php) is an automatic homology modeling server that combines both sequence and secondary structure information to detect the homologous proteins with remote similarity and target-template alignment. Human dihydropyrimidinase was also the first hit suggested as a template by (PS) 2 because it had the highest score. Results obtained from (PS) 2 analysis indicated that 99.58% of the secondary structure was aligned, which implied that human and P. aeruginosa dihydropyrimidinase shared a highly similar structure (S3 Fig). Mutational analysis of the residues within the active site According to the crystal structure of Saccharomyces kluyveri (PDB entry: 2FVK) [41] and Sinorhizobium meliloti dihydropyrimidinases (PDB entry: 3DC8) [42] , residues H59, H61, K150, H183, H239, and D316 of P. aeruginosa dihydropyrimidinase were crucial for the assembly of the binuclear metal center within the active site; meanwhile, residues Y155, S289, and N337 were crucial for substrate binding (Fig 4A) . The amino acid sequences of 497 sequenced dihydropyrimidinase homologs aligned using ConSurf [33] indicated that these residues were well conserved (Fig 4B) . The importance of these residues was then probed by site-directed mutagenesis, in which alanine substitution was constructed and analyzed. As expected, the catalytic activities of these Ala-substituted mutant proteins were severely impaired. H59A, H61A, K150A, H183A, H239A, D316A, Y155A and S289A were inactive. Only N337A mutant protein was found to be active, but its activity was about 20-fold less than that of the wildtype dihydropyrimidinase.",

As shown in Fig 6, inhibition of dihydropyrimidinase by dihydromyricetin resulted in Lineweaver\u2212Burk plots with lines that crossed the y-axis at a similar point, which indicated that dihydromyricetin was a competitive inhibitor of dihydropyrimidinase. The presence of 40 \u03bcM dihydromyricetin yielded V max and K m values, kinetic constants, of 5.4 \u00b1 0.4 \u03bcmol/mg/min and 1.6 \u00b1 0.2 mM, respectively. Without dihydromyricetin, the kinetic constants V max and K m were 7.6 \u00b1 0.4 \u03bcmol/mg/min and 0.7 \u00b1 0.1 mM, respectively ( Table 3 ).

Quenching refers to the complex formation process that decreases the fluorescence intensity of the protein. The fluorescence emission spectra of dihydropyrimidinase were remarkably quenched with dihydromyricetin ( Fig 7A) and myricetin (Fig 7B) . Upon adding 50 \u03bcM myricetin and dihydromyricetin, the intrinsic fluorescence of dihydropyrimidinase was quenched by 56.2% and 89.1%, respectively. As shown in Fig 7B, adding different concentrations of myricetin resulted in a red shift (~7 nm; \u03bb max = 333.5-340.5 nm) in the dihydropyrimidinase emission wavelength (\u03bb em ). Adding dihydromyricetin also caused a red shift in the dihydropyrimidinase emission wavelength (Fig 7A) , which was much more significant (~25 nm; \u03bb max = 333.5-358.5 nm). These observations indicated that myricetin and dihydromyricetin interacted with dihydropyrimidinase, thereby suggesting that myricetin and dihydromyricetin could form stable complexes with dihydropyrimidinase.

The docking study showed that N337 interacted with the hydroxyl group on the ring of myricetin, but not dihydromyricetin. Thus, fluorescence quenching of the N337A mutant was also carried out to test whether this residue is important for myricetin binding, but not for dihydromyricetin. Myricetin and dihydromyricetin quenched the intrinsic fluorescence of dihydropyrimidinase by 58.4% and 86.3%, respectively (Fig 8) .

The \u03bb max shifts of the N337A mutant by myricetin and dihydromyricetin were similar, but still slightly different, to those of the wildtype dihydropyrimidinase (Fig 7) . The K d value of the N337A mutant bound to myricetin ( Fig  8C) , compared with that of the wild-type dihydropyrimidinase, was reduced to 59.3 \u00b1 8.6 \u03bcM (twofold).

Although flavonols are known to have several hydroxyl groups, thought to have remarkable potential for binding any protein, the strength of the flavonols' inhibitory effect (IC 50 ) on dihydropyrimidinase was not correlated with the number of hydroxyl substituents on the flavonols' aromatic rings.

The higher activity of the Co 2+ -substituted enzymes has been proposed. The higher activity followed by metal replacement in Co(II)-thermolysin than in native thermolysin may be due to the enhancement of stabilization of the transition state than those of the native thermolysin [47] . For imidase, the sizes of the metal are found as the important factors that affect the activity of imidase [4] . The position of nucleophilic attack on an imide substrate may fluctuate due to size of the coordinating metal ion.

            "text": "The chemical mechanism of the binuclear metal center-containing amidohydrolase likely involves three steps: (1) the hydrolytic water molecule must be activated for nucleophilic attack, (2) the amide bond of the substrate must be made more electrophilic by the polarization of the carbonyl-oxygen bond, and (3) the leaving group nitrogen must be protonated as the carbon-nitrogen bond is cleaved [38, 48] . This catalytic mechanism is applicable to each member in the cyclic amidohydrolase family [41, 48, 49] . However, a question remains as to why a common mechanism-based inhibitor for these imide-hydrolyzing enzymes, such as imidase, hydantoinase, dihydropyrimidinase, allantoinase, and dihydroorotase, is difficult to find. New and undetermined factors should be further studied and discovered in this protein family, such as the third metal ion recently found in dihydroorotase, which was found to be highly important for catalysis [50, 51] . Further studies are also necessary to investigate the substrate specificity, selectivity, and catalytic mechanism of dihydropyrimidinase and hydantoinase, as well as other cyclic amidohydrolases. 2 analysis showed that 99.58% of the secondary structure is aligned, indicating a highly similar structure between human and P. aeruginosa dihydropyrimidinase.

According to the crystal structure of Saccharomyces kluyveri (PDB entry: 2FVK), residues H59, H61, K150, H183, H239, and D316 of P. aeruginosa dihydropyrimidinase shown in yellow were crucial for the assembly of the binuclear metal center within the active site; meanwhile, residues Y155, S289, and N337 shown in limon were crucial for substrate binding. The model was directly constructed by superimposing the modeled structure of P. aeruginosa dihydropyrimidinase with the crystal structure of S. kluyveri dihydropyrimidinase-dihydrouracil complex. Dihydrouracil generated from the complex is shown in light magenta. (B) An alignment consensus of 497 sequenced dihydropyrimidinase homologs by ConSurf reveals the degree of variability at each position along the primary sequence. Note that the positions involved in the assembly of the binuclear metal center within the active site and the substrate binding of P. aeruginosa dihydropyrimidinase are well conserved.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0127634.g004",
