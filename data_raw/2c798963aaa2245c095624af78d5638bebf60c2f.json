This case report used a button sampler, worn or held by staff or left free-standing in a fixed location, for environmental sampling around a child who was chronically infected by a respiratory adenovirus, to determine whether there was any risk of secondary adenovirus infection to the staff managing the patient. Despite multiple air samples taken on difference days, coinciding with high levels of adenovirus detectable in the child's nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs), none of the air samples contained any detectable adenovirus DNA using a clinically validated diagnostic polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. Although highly sensitive, in-house PCR assays have been developed to detect airborne pathogen RNA/DNA, it is still unclear what level of specific pathogen RNA/DNA constitutes a true clinical risk. In this case, the absence of detectable airborne adenovirus DNA using a conventional diagnostic assay removed the requirement for staff to wear surgical masks and face visors when they entered the child's room. No subsequent staff infections or outbreaks of adenovirus have so far been identified.",

These may consist of air samples that have been collected into a fluid virus transport media (VTM) obtained from liquid impinger air samplers, or a gel disc (or other solid capture media) which can be dissolved in VTM.

These thresholds are very likely to differ between the different patient populations for each pathogen (e.g., influenza on a bone marrow transplant versus respiratory syncytial virus on a general paediatric ward).

Such time periods may be purely arbitrary and very often do not correlate with the actual durations of interaction between staff, patients, and visitors.

This answer is clearly very context-dependent, and depends on the immune status of those exposed, which in turn will partially determine the pathogen's specific infectious dose (i.e., the amount of the organism required to cause infection, and potentially, disease). This will also vary between individuals depending on their past exposure and current level of specific immunity to that specific pathogen, including any history of vaccination, where available. Another layer of complexity is posed by the use of PCR testing of the air sample, as PCR cannot distinguish between live and inactivated virus.

The air was drawn through the dissolvable gel filter at an airflow rate of 4 L/min. The pump was calibrated to 4 L/min with the rotameter prior to each sampling session (Figure 1 ). Local room temperature and relative humidity was also measured at the start of each air sampling session (ThermoPro TP50, My iTronics, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China). At the end of the sampling period, the gel filter was carefully extracted from the filter, dissolved in 2 mL of virus transport medium (VTM), extracted (QIAsymphony DSP Virus/Pathogen Kit, Qiagen, Manchester, UK) and run on the AusDiagnostics (Respiratory Viruses 16-WELL, cat. 20602, AusDiagnostics UK Ltd., Chesham, UK) assay.

During this time, the sampler would have sampled (at 4 L/min) 120-160 L of air. This is slightly less but comparable to the amount of air that might be inhaled by one of the ward nurses working in the same vicinity of the patient. This estimate is based on a tidal volume of 0.5-0.7 L and a respiratory rate of 12-16 breaths per minute (bpm), which gives a total inhaled volume of approximately 180-336 L over 30 min, depending on their activity level.",

In theory, any AdV in this region was unlikely to be expelled because any airflow from deeper in her lungs would be channelled into her tracheostomy. The tracheostomy cuff around the tube, holding it in place in her trachea, should also prevent any escape of air into her URT. So even if AdV is being reactivated and shed from her adenoids in the URT, there would be very little air entering the URT from her lungs to aerosolise and exhale it into the surrounding air. Thus, in theory, any AdV would be purely confined to the patient's mouth and saliva and not become airborne.
