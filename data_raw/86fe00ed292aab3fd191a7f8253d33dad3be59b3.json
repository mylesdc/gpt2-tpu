In alcoholic liver disease (ALD), the metabolism of ethanol plays a role in pathogenesis [5] [6] [7] [8] , and there is increasing evidence for specific roles played by the immune response [4] [5, [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] .

The standard method of determining the severity of disease and appropriate treatment has been the liver biopsy [16] , but histological examination of the biopsy gives limited information on what is occurring at the molecular level. Therefore, identifying gene expression patterns in liver tissue during cirrhosis development could add valuable information to clinical tests. Functional genomics is increasingly being utilized to investigate the mechanisms underlying the development of liver disease. During chronic HCV infection in humans, broad activation of the endogenous type I IFN pathway has been observed by genomic analysis [17] . Microarray analysis of liver biopsies from HCVinfected patients has also revealed genes associated with activated lymphocytes, extracellular matrix, and macrophages, that could be possible markers for fibrosis progression [18, 19] . In mice, expression of the HCV core protein results in down regulation in the expression of lipid metabolism-associated genes [20] . Other virus-host interactions, including SARS-CoV [21] , influenza virus [22] , and Ebola [23] , have also been successfully studied by functional genomics. Gene expression profiling using microarray technology clearly makes it possible to obtain global transcriptional changes associated with a diseased state caused by many factors, which could help identify pathways implicated in progression of disease [24] .",

The pathology of alcoholand HCV-induced cirrhosis is very similar and characteristic fibrosis patterns leading to cirrhosis can overlap among these two etiologies [25] . Therefore, it is particularly useful to now have the tools for genomic analysis, in order to determine how cirrhosis development may differ between these two distinct etiologies. Upon analysis, we indeed found differences in the expression of interferon-related genes and lymphocyte-specific genes between alcoholic and viral etiologies. Interestingly, a clear distinction existed between CTP classes of ALD, but not HCV-associated, cirrhosis. Different expression patterns depending on severity of alcohol-induced cirrhosis were found in genes associated with the inflammatory response, lipid metabolism, and oxidative stress. This information could be integral in increasing understanding of underlying mechanisms at work during end-stage liver disease.",

A set of 946 genes was identified as being significantly (P \u2264 0.05) different with respect to expression level between the two groups. We then used Fatigo software to analyze functional groups that differed between cirrhosis etiologies. Genes associated with metabolism, the immune response, and cell death were differentially regulated in HCV-and alcoholrelated cirrhosis. Many of the genes specifically induced in HCV-associated cirrhotic livers were not up-regulated in ethanol-cirrhotic livers. This appears to be at least partly related to activation of the innate antiviral immune response, as many of these up-regulated genes are known to be regulated by IFN ( Fig. 2A) . Specifically, a subset of genes highly induced in HCV-associated cirrhotic samples were IFN\u03b1/\u03b2-inducible (IRF7, OAS2, GIP2, GIP3) or take part in its activation. Additional IFN-type I genes -OAS1, IFITM1, IFI35, IFIT1, MX1, IFI27 -were highly up-regulated in HCV-associated samples but not included in this ANOVA. A small set of genes (ISG20, IFI16, TRIM22, STAT5A) were also highly up-regulated in nearly all samples, including ethanol-cirrhotic livers, suggesting these may play a role in an inflammatory response related to cirrhosis development regardless of etiology.",

Expression profiles distinguished the ethanol-related CTP class A samples from ethanol-related CTP class B and C samples. In general, class A samples demonstrated up-regulation of more genes than in samples with more severe cirrhosis (Class B and C). Distinct gene expression profiles were not observed between CTP classes B and C, but this may be due to small sample size. Ingenuity analysis of groups I and II (Fig. 3A ) demonstrated that the number of genes associated with various biological functions differed significantly depending on severity of alcohol cirrhosis. Of 135 annotated genes up-regulated in group II, 60 were associated with cell death as compared to only 16 in group I. High numbers of genes related to cell movement, mainly of phagocytes, and tissue development were also up-regulated in more severe ethanol cirrhosis. Many genes in group I (less severe cirrhosis) were associated with lipid metabolism, specifically the metabolism of cholesterol. Genes involved in the function of the immune and lymphatic system, such as activation of mononuclear leukocytes and proliferation of macrophages, were also up-regulated in early, less severe cirrhosis.",

Many of these genes were up-regulated during less severe cirrhosis but down-regulated by end-stage ethanol cirrhosis. Sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1) oxidizes cholesterol in the alternative pathway of bile acid biosynthesis; a defect in this enzyme leads to excessive accumulation of sterols [29] . We observed significant up-regulation of this gene in livers of all patients with early ethanol cirrhosis and, as with other genes in this group, down-regulation during late (end-stage) cirrhosis ( Figure 3C ). Fatty acids are substrates for cytochrome CYP2E1 (P450 2E1) [5] , which is a key enzyme in the microsomal ethanol oxidation system and plays a role in alcohol detoxification and nutritional support [30] . It is also a major source of oxidative stress [6, 5] , and both protein and mRNA levels increase dramat-ically in actively drinking patients [31] . Therefore it was interesting that significant down-regulation of this gene was also observed in high grade (CTP class B and C) cirrhotic livers ( Figure 3C) .

We therefore performed a one-way error-weighted ANOVA (P \u2265 0.05) of less severe (CTP class A alcohol-associated) versus more severe ethanol-related and HCV-associated cirrhotic samples to identify genes with expression levels unique to CTP class A alcohol. Of 607 total genes in this set, a cluster of 273 were highly up-regulated in all samples but ethanol CTP class A (Fig. 4, group I) , and a cluster of 109 were highly up-regulated specifically in class A (Fig. 4 , group II); see Additional file 3 for more information on gene names. Functional analysis (Ingenuity) revealed that genes associated with cell death, movement, and the immune response were much more abundant in group I than in group II. Most immune response genes up-regulated in group I were generally involved in proliferation and migration of leukocytes, while those in group II were again related to activation and infiltration of macrophages. The majority of genes up-regulated in group II of early ethanol cirrhosis are involved in the modification of lipids. The response to oxidative stress was also significantly different in early ethanol cirrhosis as related to all other samples. Two genes in particular were highly up-regulated in CTP class A livers -PRDX2 (up to 4.7 fold) and APOE (up to 17.5 fold) -and either less up-regulated or even down-regulated in the majority of the remaining samples.",

Increased expression of RANTES -chemotactic for T cells -has been observed in livers of chronically-infected HCV patients [38] and a correlation has been found between increased expression of RANTES in the liver and the extent of liver damage [39] . That we observed significant up-regulation of genes related to lymphocyte infiltration exclusively in HCV-infected cirrhotic livers may have some significance for how liver injury differs in HCV-and ethanol-cirrhosis. It has already been shown that liver injury during chronic HCV infection is associated with increased expression of TH1 cytokines [40, 41] . However, T-cell activation is also } I seen in patients during chronic alcohol consumption [42] . The present study points to a predominant role of the immune response in liver pathogenesis well into the latest stages of HCV-associated disease, and T cells seem to be important in this response. Though the activation of T cells appears to contribute to liver injury in chronic ALD, our observations suggest that the immune response could be more important in the stages before cirrhosis develops, but no longer predominant during cirrhosis progression.",

            "text": "It is clear that gene expression profiles in ethanol-induced and HCV-induced liver cirrhosis are distinct. We have identified functional groups that differ both between etiologies and within ethanol-induced cirrhosis, depending on the extent of liver damage. The data suggest that oxidative stress, lipid metabolism, and macrophage activity may be more associated with severe liver injury leading to cirrhosis in ALD than in viral-induced disease. In contrast, the adaptive immune response, characterized by T cellmediated killing of HCV-infected cells, appears to be more associated with the development of liver cirrhosis in viral-, but not alcohol-mediated disease. The study supports the idea that though these different etiologies lead to similar pathologies, the cellular mechanisms responsible for disease progression may be unique. Although we realize the limitations of a small cross-sectional study, the gene expression patterns identified here are from a large set of genes in order to give a broad global perspective. These initial findings will contribute to further studies to distinguish which pathways can differentiate development of liver damage due to etiology, which could lead to better-targeted therapies for end-stage liver disease.",

None of the HCV-infected patients in this study were undergoing anti-viral treatment at the time the liver sample was obtained. Alcohol consumption information was based on data obtained in patient interviews. The severity of cirrhosis was clinically graded according to Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) scores (summarized in Table 1 ). Normal, uninfected liver tissue from 8 patients who underwent tumor resection due to metastases of non-liver origin was collected at the same clinic (non-tumor material was used). These uninfected samples were pooled to create a standard normal liver reference (pNL) that was used for all microarray experiments. All patients gave informed prior consent to protocols approved by the University of Barcelona, Spain.",

Human cDNA set 1 expression arrays carrying 13,026 unique cDNA clones were purchased from Agilent. A single experiment comparing two samples, one from a liver with infection and one from the normal liver reference, was performed with four replicate arrays using the dye label reverse technique as described before, thus providing mean ratios between the expression levels of each gene in the analyzed sample pair, standard deviations, and P values [35, [52] [53] [54] . All data were entered into a custom-designed database, Expression Array Manager, and then uploaded into Rosetta Resolver System 4.0 (Rosetta Biosoftware, Kirkland, WA) and Spotfire Decision Suite 7.1.1 (Spotfire, Somerville, MA). Data normalization and the Resolver System Error model specifically developed for this array format are described on the web site [51] . This web site is also used to publish all primary data in accordance with the proposed standards [55] . The annotation sites Fatigo [56] and Ingenuity [57] were used to classify genes into functional groups.",
