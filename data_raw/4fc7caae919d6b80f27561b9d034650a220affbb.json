One of the challenges of contact network epidemiology has been the difficulty of collecting individual and population-level data needed to develop an accurate representation of the underlying host population's contact structure. In this study, we evaluate the utility of common epidemiological measures (R 0 , epidemic peak size, duration and final size) for inferring the degree of heterogeneity in a population's unobserved contact structure through a Bayesian approach. We test the method using ground truth data and find that some of these epidemiological metrics are effective at classifying contact heterogeneity. The classification is also consistent across pathogen transmission probabilities, and so can be applied even when this characteristic is unknown. In particular, the reproductive number, R 0 , turns out to be a poor classifier of the degree heterogeneity, while, unexpectedly, final epidemic size is a powerful predictor of network structure across the range of heterogeneity. We also evaluate our framework on empirical epidemiological data from past and recent outbreaks to demonstrate its application in practice and to gather insights about the relevance of particular contact structures for both specific systems and general classes of infectious disease. We thus introduce a simple approach that can shed light on the unobserved connectivity of a host population given epidemic data. Our study has the potential to inform future data-collection efforts and study design by driving our understanding of germane epidemic measures, and highlights a general inferential approach to learning about host contact structure in contemporary or historic populations of humans and animals.",

In the context of directly transmitted pathogens, this ability relies, in part, on an understanding of the contact patterns between the individuals (hosts) of a population. Traditional epidemiological modelling accounts for contact behaviour through both implicit and explicit mechanisms and at different levels of abstraction. Purely compartmental models are used to model subsets of populations of individuals and allow different parameters to govern the rates of interaction between each. This approach has been successfully applied in capturing some of the heterogeneity inherent in contact patterns between groups of hosts. Contact network models, by contrast, explicitly define potential disease-transmitting connections between all individuals in a population, allowing for the incorporation of heterogeneous mixing at the lowest level. Contact networks represent individuals as network nodes and represent potentially disease-transmitting contact between individuals as network edges. The total number of edges connecting an individual with others is referred to as the individual's degree. The probability distribution of these degrees for all individuals in a network (i.e. population) is referred to as the network's degree distribution. The contact heterogeneity in a population is thus reflected in the variance of the network's degree distribution. Gaining an understanding of a host population's distribution of contacts provides structural information useful in characterizing and intervening in disease outbreaks, and has been demonstrated in numerous human, wildlife and livestock disease systems (e.g. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] ).",

Typically, these data are used to parametrize probabilistic contact network models. These models can then be used as the basis for predictive or public health intervention studies. While an understanding is beginning to emerge of which network structures are relevant for different classes of infectious disease, it is far from clear how to choose among different models of contact heterogeneity. That is, the probabilistic approach assumes a certain model a priori that may or may not be relevant to the disease of interest. (Alternatives to this paradigm do exist; notably, synthetic network models that use census and other socio-demographic data to infer possible contact networks using a first-principles approach [5, 13] . ) An alternative to these data-hungry strategies is a statistical approach, where a contact network model is inferred using available host and epidemic data within a likelihood framework [12] .",

By using data that are commonly available for a variety of different disease systems, our approach seeks to make optimal use of collected data and inform future collection efforts. We evaluate three classes of network models that can be broadly classified by their increasing level of contact heterogeneity, looking specifically at whether it is possible to distinguish between these types using high-level and common epidemiological summary statistics. In this way, we are not so much attempting to pin down an exact network, but instead looking to determine what level of heterogeneity the data support, and which individual epidemiological metrics provide the most confidence towards this support. We test our inferential framework with synthetic and empirical contact data, comparing model selection results for each individual epidemiological measure with ground truth (i.e. the network class that generated it). We also evaluate our framework on empirical epidemiological data from historical and recent outbreaks, where the underlying contact structure is unknown, to demonstrate how our framework could be applied in practice and used to gather insights about the relevance of certain contact structures for general classes of infectious disease. In doing so, we determine that only certain epidemiological statistics are informative and consistent in recovering the level of contact heterogeneity in an underlying host population.",

Subsequently, we perform Monte Carlo simulations for a susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) epidemic model with a single initial infected case and per-contact transmissibility, T, on these networks, generating frequency distributions for each epidemic measure to use as likelihood functions. (This approach has similarities to the approximate Bayesian computation approach used for Bayesian inference [26] [27] [28] .)

Using these results, classified as positive and negative for each network class, we consider the sensitivity and the specificity of the epidemiological measures as classifiers. Sensitivity indicates the proportion of positives for which the true network class is inferred as most likely (true positive rate), while specificity indicates the proportion of negatives for which the network classes that are not true are not inferred as most likely (true negative rate; more information is provided in the electronic supplementary material). Together, these two ratios present a picture of how reliable each measure is at classifying the networks. The results shown in figure 1 highlight that overall the classifiers perform well, with only R 0 having a trade-off between specificity and sensitivity, and tending to be more specific than sensitive. Epidemic final size, peak size and duration, on the other hand, tend to balance both high specificity and sensitivity (for most transmission probabilities). While peak size and duration perform better as transmissibility decreases, final size classifies more effectively for increasing transmissibility values. However, sensitivity and specificity only account for categorical model choice and do not take into account model selection uncertainty.",

Our results are validated in each case by knowledge of the true contact network and its statistical best fit. In figure 3 (box plots) we show, for each empirical contact network (adolescent sexual, cattle, school and urban), the posterior probabilities of each network class based on three of the four data types, s : final size, r : peak size, d : duration. (We choose to ignore R 0 in this analysis, given its poor performance in the previous testing stage.) In addition, for each empirical contact network, we show the posterior degree distribution, calculated via Bayesian model averaging [20, 38] , The degree distribution of the adolescent sexual network (figure 3a) has a best fit of exponential (using the K-L divergence values, given the MLE estimates). (All K-L divergence values and best-fit distributions are shown in the electronic supplementary material, table S1, and figures S9-S12.) It is inferred by our model selection as Poisson based on the final size (s) and peak size (r) classifiers, but as exponential by the duration (d) classifier. This result confirms our sensitivity analysis that all classifiers for networks of mean degree two, for small population sizes, are relatively ambiguous for the transmission probability used here (see sensitivity analysis in the electronic supplementary material). For the cattle movement network (figure 3b), a scale-free network is selected strongly by statistical fitting, and both the s and r classifiers strongly prefer the same. The d classifier provides significant evidence for the exponential network, reflecting the disassortative nature of this network [39] . For the school network (figure 3c), the Poisson degree distribution is supported by both our model selection and by the K-L divergence best fit. The d classifier does provide weaker support, due to the small population size (see sensitivity analysis in the electronic supplementary material). Lastly, the epidemiological data produced over the urban network (figure 3d) strongly match the K-L divergence best fit of a Poisson degree distribution. The true degree distribution of this empirical network looks to be more complex than any of the three network classes, but its dominant feature, a dispersed peak with a moderate average degree, is most consistent with a Poisson distribution. In addition, the network is strongly modular and moderately assortative (see the electronic supplementary material), but still acts like a Poisson-distributed random network with respect to epidemic outcomes.",

Epidemic final sizes are most consistent in this respect, except in the case of small population sizes with extremely low connectivity, which is in accordance with our results using the synthetic testing data. Epidemic duration, although effective when population size and mean degree are small, is not strongly reliable otherwise (see the figure S7 ). These results demonstrate that although each of these networks has complex network structure (clustering, assortativity, modularity), a classification framework based on the assumption of randomness still predicts the contact heterogeneity as reflected in the degree distribution well. However, they also suggest that network features (such as significant disassortativity) that are a result of more than the degree distribution are not captured by these epidemic measures (especially duration). In addition, these findings highlight that the framework works well across a broad range of mean degree values (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) and transmission probabilities (0.07 -0.75).",

The choice of Poisson is reasonable in that it has the lowest contact heterogeneity of the three contact network models and measles has been relatively well modelled in the past using a homogeneous-mixing model [40, 41] . The scale-free network model also has relatively high posterior probabilities at lower mean degree values. The most likely explanation for this result is that the mean degree among children less than the age of 14 in Hagelloch was in fact greater than 23 (where the Poisson model is the only likely model).

Norovirus typically spreads very quickly in a population, usually by person-to-person contact by means of faecal-oral or aerosol transmission [37] . Multiple factors mediate norovirus transmission such as host movement and environmental contamination and thus what constitutes a potentially disease-transmitting contact is vague. It is unclear in this study which factor drove the outbreak, but our data support an underlying population with a large degree of heterogeneity in their disease-causing contacts. This heterogeneity could point to variation in individual hygiene behaviour or be the result of primary environmental transmission. The model selection results are consistent across all mean degree values, thus adding more confidence to the prediction.",

In addition, all predictions are fairly consistent across the range of mean degrees or transmission probabilities. Although we are not explicitly estimating other parameters for any of these systems, the model selection for network class can be followed up by model selection on the mean degree (or more precisely, the value of u) and the transmission probability [20] .",

            "text": "Directly transmitted pathogen dynamics are fundamentally driven by the interactions between individuals in the host population that make up infectious contact and lead to transmission. Network epidemiology has come a long way in demonstrating the impact that the structure of these interactions (which make up the contact network) has on the progression of an infectious disease [5, 11, 24, [49] [50] [51] [52] . In this study, we have developed a predictive framework to show that common epidemiological measures can give important insights into the contact structure of a host population. The important dependence that has been established between contact network structure and infectious disease dynamics is both a motivation for why a framework like ours is needed and a key to its development. In particular, we have focused on the heterogeneity in the host population's contact structure as represented through the degree distribution. Although degree heterogeneity is only one of the characteristics that describes a network, it has been understood to play a fundamental role in describing variation in disease transmission [24, 53] , and has been recently shown to in fact account for much of the variation in many cases [54] . From our analysis, it is evident that some epidemiological measures better distinguish contact heterogeneities in the underlying populations. The reproductive number does seem to have some potential as a classifier, but performs poorly, especially for less-connected populations. (In our sensitivity analysis, shown in the electronic supplementary material, we find that the R 0 classifier improves for more connected populations (mean degree ! 10).) All the remaining measures also have mixed results for varying parts of the mean degree and transmissibility parameter space. (Given these results, the development of a joint likelihood approach that combines information from multiple epidemic measures could be productive. Although not the goal of this study, we present a preliminary analysis based on combined metrics in the electronic supplementary material.) Overall, our primary and sensitivity analyses indicate that a less-connected host population with a moderate or highly transmissible pathogen (as often occurs in human sexually transmitted disease systems) can best be classified by final size or peak size; while a highly connected host population with a low or moderately transmissible pathogen (as often is the case for human respiratory disease outbreaks) is better classified by final size and in many cases by duration. That final size is a good classifier is likely due to the low variability it exhibits for a given contact network structure. The exception to the effectiveness of final size as the most reliable metric is that of an extremely sparsely connected (mean degree % 2) and small host population sizes (N , 500) .",

In contrast to the sample sizes in our previous experiments, these predictions are based on one data point each, and still produce predictions that are congruent with our understanding of the respective disease systems. These predictions can also begin to shed some light on the relationship between network structure and certain classes of disease systems (i.e. a pathogen with a given transmission mode and the type of population it spreads in). Sexually transmitted disease spread in heterosexual and homosexual populations has been the most well-studied case in this regard. There has been a significant amount of work investigating the high degree of heterogeneity found in sexual contact networks, made up of the monogamous many and promiscuous few [45, 46, 48] . The spread of childhood diseases such as measles spreading among cohorts of susceptible rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org J R Soc Interface 10: 20120578 children is also a classic example where the level of heterogeneity has typically been assumed (to be low, in this case), although never shown. Our predictions on the Hagelloch outbreak provide evidence in this direction. Few other disease systems have been investigated in this manner and thus we have a poor understanding of whether or not certain contact structures characterize certain classes of diseases. The strong support towards high contact heterogeneity in the norovirus outbreaks points to transmission of gastrointestinal pathogens as being driven by super-spreading events, either due to strong environmental seeding or as a result of individual behaviour. This initial framework does have notable limitations, however. Primarily, we have made assumptions on the pathogen spread that may not hold in all cases. We assume no incubation period, a constant generation time and no variability in susceptibility or transmissibility. The framework also assumes a static contact network, not accounting for dynamics in contact structure due to social changes or public health interventions [55] . Although these additional complexities are not expected to fundamentally weaken the approach, further work is necessary. Lastly, our approach is designed for large-scale epidemics only (i.e. R 0 . 1 and the outbreak spreads to a significant proportion of the population). An important future challenge will be to develop a framework based on endemic or early outbreak surveillance data, which could be used to classify population structure before an epidemic occurs, so that the results could be used to predict and design interventions in real time.",
