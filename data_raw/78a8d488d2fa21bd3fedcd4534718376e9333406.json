Coronaviruses, paramyxoviruses and bocavirus also show evidence of intrahousehold transmission. Simulations show that age-dependent susceptibility and transmission have the largest effects on mean HRV prevalence.",

Children are indeed significantly more susceptible than adults, and more likely to transmit within households, and evidence for transmission between households emerges only in school-aged children. We find no evidence for transmission by adults. 2. Larger households and households with younger children thus have a higher prevalence of HRV, as predicted. 3. Transmission by individuals with symptoms is higher within households. 4. We find that testing positive for coronavirus reduces the probability of acquiring HRV but that loss of coronavirus is slower in individuals testing positive for HRV. In addition to these predictions, we found that loss of HRV is reduced when others in the household are infected, presumably due to reinfection, Finally, although we lack the power to definitively distinguish frequency-dependent from density-dependent transmission [55] , intrahousehold transmission is better predicted by the frequency of infected individuals than by their number.",

Our estimate of interhousehold transmission is based on treating the 26 households as a representative sample of the full population. Because the study is uncontrolled, so we cannot fully remove the effects of unmeasured covariates even with random effect models. Although compliance was generally high, there was sufficient missing data to further reduce power and potentially introduce reporting bias.
