Here, we analyzed 350 cases of H7N9 infection and 47 cases of H5N1 infection. The spatial characteristics of these cases revealed that H5N1 infections mainly occurred in the South, Middle, and Northwest of China, while the occurrence of H7N9 was concentrated in coastal areas of East and South of China. Aside from spatial-temporal characteristics, the most adaptive meteorological conditions for the occurrence of human infections by these two viral subtypes were different. We found that H7N9 infections correlate with climate factors, especially temperature (TEM) and relative humidity (RHU), while H5N1 infections correlate with TEM and atmospheric pressure (PRS). Hence, we propose a risky window (TEM 4-14 \u00b0C and RHU",

Because these two viruses are associated with both wild and domestic bird populations, it is likely that environmental factors play a significant role in the spread of the viruses. Generally, wild birds may act as the primary spreading agent for the outbreak of the influenza virus 10 . After the movement of the virus from wild birds to poultry, the virus may spread from flock to flock and farm to farm through several ways 11 . These include wild bird migration, poultry-wild bird interaction, and human proximity to poultry. For example, poultry trade areas that are in proximity to wild waterfowl habitats, such as wetlands or lakes, can facilitate virus exchange between wild birds and poultry 12, 13 . Animal model data shows that the transmission of IAV is more likely at low temperatures and relative humidity conditions 14 . However, the prevention of secondary spread can be achieved through restricting bird movement and proper biosecurity procedures. Given the mobility of wild birds and the challenges of sustained control, it is of great importance to identify which environment factors correlate with the occurrence of these two viruses.",

However, we found that both viruses have species-specific manifestations; the outbreak patterns of these two viruses in humans are not coincident with infections in wild birds or waterfowl. The reasons for this discrepancy could be due to the prevalence of the viruses in wild birds and waterfowl, the proximity of humans to these animals, and/or characteristics of the viruses themselves. The susceptibility of humans to the viruses due to host immune function and inhibition of mucociliary clearance by the inhalation of cold, dry air could also be a factor.",

South China is comprised of Guangxi, Guangdong, and Fujian provinces, Central China is comprised of Sichuan, Guizhou, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, Shanghai, and Zhejiang provinces, and North China is comprised of Shaanxi, Shanxi, Henan, Hebei, Shandong, and Liaoning provinces, as well as Beijing and Tianjin (municipal cities). As shown in Table 1 , the H5N1 influenza infection cases mainly occurred in South, Central, and Northwest China, with the most (eight cases) in Hunan Province.

To understand the discrepancies in climate factors between H7N9 and H5N1 infections, the null hypothesis was tested using the T-test. As shown in Table 2 , the p-values for RHU.mean, PRS.mean, and WIN.mean were < 0.05. These results imply that there were significant differences between H7N9 and H5N1 infections in terms of humidity, pressure, and wind speed. H5N1 infections occurred with the highest frequency in a humidity range of 60-70%, while H7N9 infections occurred in the 70-80% rage (Fig. 1B) . In terms of atmospheric pressure, the cases of H5N1 were concentrated at 990-1020 kPa, while the occurrences of H7N9 infection were found at 1000-1030 kPa (Fig. 1C ). In addition, as the composition of meteorological factors, the wind speed during H5N1 cases was concentrated at 1-2 m/s, while the occurrences of H7N9 infection were found at 2-3 m/s wind speed (Fig. 1F ). Temperature and specific humidity were the best individual influence factors for influenza infection. According to null hypothesis 1, both the mean value of the air temperature and the mean value of the ground surface temperature displayed no significant difference comparing H5N1 and H7N9 infections. H5N1 influenza occurred with the highest frequency in a temperature range of 5-10 \u00b0C, with a second peak in the range of 15-20 \u00b0C.

Consistent with the TEM value, the H5N1 influenza infection cases were relatively more prevalent when the ground surface temperature was 5-10 \u00b0C, with a second peak at 15-20 \u00b0C; H7N9 influenza infection cases peaked at 10-15 \u00b0C and 5-10 \u00b0C, respectively (Fig. 1A,D) .",

The Chi-squared test was used to test this hypothesis. As shown in Table 3 , we found that the p-value for all of climate is < 0.05. These results demonstrate that there were significant relationships between climate factors and H5/H7 influenza infection. To further understand the relationships among these factors with H5/H7 infection, we conducted principal component analysis (PCA) for all climate factors employed in our study. As shown in Table 4 , Fig. 2A and Supplementary Video S2, the results from the H7N9 influenza cases indicate that the first principle component, whose dominant contributors are temperature variables (i.e., TEM.mean, TEM.high, TEM.low, and GST.mean) explain 49.11% of the total variance; the second principle component, which is dominated by relative humidity variables (i.e., RHU.mean and RHU.low), explains 24.20% of the total variance. The third principle component was dominated by wind speed (WIN.mean) and other variables and only explains 14.77% of the total variance. The total contribution of these three sets of climatic variables accounted for 88.04% of the total contribution. Similar to the H7N9 influenza cases, the first H5N1 principle component was led by temperature variables (i.e., TEM.mean, TEM.high, TEM.low, and GST.mean) and explains almost half of the total variance (46.92%, see Table 4 , Fig. 2C and Supplementary Video S1). In contrast to H7N9, the second principle component of H5N1 was dominated by pressure (i.e., PRS.mean), which explains 17.69% of the total variance, and the third principle component included humidity and other variables, explaining 16.17% of the total variance. The total contribution of these three sets of climatic variables accounted for 80.78% of the total contribution. From the above analysis, we can see that among all of the climatic variables, temperature and humidity were the key factors for H7N9 infection. For H5N1 infection, temperature and atmospheric pressure were the key factors, though humidity also had significant effects.",

However, there is vast number of small-scale poultry producers, supplying a strong demand for live poultry in China. Consequently, permanently closing LPMs would likely prove unpopular, and therefore, their periodic closure may represent a more viable compromise. The climate risk windows delineated in this study should be considered as important references for the guidance of any such solution. This strategy of metrological factor-based prediction can avoid large-scale live poultry culling and blindly closing live poultry markets to save a large amount of social resources.",

We collected the H5N1 and H7N9 influenza data reported on the Chinese mainland from The climate dataset contained the air temperature, ground surface temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure of all meteorological stations in the reported provinces at the reported dates for each record. There is more than one meteorological station in each province, and the site-level climate datasets were aggregated into the province-level (average for the climate factors), which are able to represent the weather situation in the study areas. Furthermore, several indices were derived from the province-level climate data for further analysis, i.e., the maximum, minimum, and mean value of the air temperature (TEM.mean, TEM.high, and TEM.low), the minimum and mean value of the relative humidity (RHU.mean and RHU.low), the mean value of the ground surface temperature (GST.mean), the pressure (PRS.mean), and the wind speed (WIN.mean) on each reported date. Briefly, the average daily data from each weather station in the province, observed four times on a daily basis (00:00, 06:00, 12:00, and 18:00), were used after removing outliers. According to province-level climate data, the daily mean data were selected to average total weather stations of each province from January 2003 through December 2013. The monthly mean data were calculated from the daily reports of each province.",

Then, a T statistic was obtained by the equation below, where X i , s i 2 , and N i represent the mean value, variance, and sample size of a specific factor of the ith group (i.e., Group 1: H5N1; Group 2: H7N9), respectively.

In addition to the T-tests, Pearson's Chi-squared tests were used to examine the dependence of H5N1 events and H7N9 events on the occurring month and climatic factors. The null hypothesis of the Pearson's Chi-squared test is that a specific factor is statistically independent from the occurrence of H5N1 and H7N9. Considering that the Pearson's Chi-squared test could only be applied to the categorical variables, all continuous variables, including age, and all climate factors were converted into categorical variables by dividing observations into several groups using pre-defined thresholds. Specifically, all observations of H5N1 and H7N9 were divided into: 1) three groups for occurring month, (Group 1: January to March; Group 2: April to June; and Group 3: July to December); 2) nine groups for air temperature, from -15 to 30 \u00b0C with a step of 5 \u00b0C; 3) eight groups for relative humidity, from 20% to 100% with a step of 10%; and 4) eight groups for ground surface temperature, from -10 to 30 \u00b0C with a step of 5 \u00b0C, separately. After the grouping procedure, the counts of all observations in each group could be exhibited as in the Table 5 , Accordingly, a \u03c7 2 statistic was calculated based on the following equations, where E i,j is the expectation value of each group at the ith row and jth column, and N is the total sample size of these two datasets. Statistically, this calculated \u03c7 2 statistic denotes a Chi-squared distribution with the degree of freedom (df) equal to r-1. Therefore, if the calculated \u03c7 2 meets the following critical region, we rejected the null hypothesis, which indicates that this factor is dependent on the occurrence of H5N1 and H7N9, where \u03c7 2 1-a/2,df is the critical value of the Chi-squared distribution, a is the significance level (i.e., 0.05 in this study), and df is the degree of freedom.",
