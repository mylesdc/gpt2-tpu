In this study, a new RPM (RPM-IVDC1) that consisted of 224-bp detector tiles corresponding to 9 influenza A subtypes, 11 rhinoviruses, 28 enteroviruses and 38 other respiratory viruses was developed and optimized to provide individual and simultaneous detection sensitivities ranging from 15 to 750 genomic copies for 16 common respiratory pathogens. A total of 110 consecutive patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) admitted to 5 district general hospitals in Beijing during a 1-year period were assessed using the new assay. Among the children (under age 5) and adult patients (above age 18), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and rhinovirus (RV) were the most common etiological agents, respectively, which is consistent with reference assays. Atypical pathogens that may cause CAP-like illness, including rubella virus, measles virus, influenza type C virus, human herpesvirus (HHV) were also detected. The results show the capability of RPM-IVDC1 for the accurate detection and identification of multiple virus types, which may be of significant use in epidemic surveillance and outbreak investigations of atypical pathogens.",

With the advantage of detecting multiple pathogens simultaneously, various multiplex PCRs have been developed and optimized to be performed on lower respiratory tract samples, offering the opportunity for increased sensitivity and specificity of the diagnosis and improved outcomes [14, 15] . These multiplexed methods are being broadly used to detect the common etiological agents of CAP. However, there is new information on the incidence of atypical pathogens and of pathogens in cases of severe CAP and in CAP in the elderly [1] , for which the multiplexed assays have not been used to detect.",

Base calls generated from noninterfering hybridization were mostly observed on RV/EV 5'-UTR and influenza A virus (Flu A) M gene between different types or subtypes. The sequences generated from these noninterfering hybridizations did not cause misidentification, as the noninterfering hybridization was distinguishable from the hybridization of the intended target [19] .",

The biphasic PCR parameters of the TSP allows a multiplex PCR to be performed under standardized PCR conditions without extensive optimization of each individual PCR assay [22] . Unique buffer in the multiplex kit promotes stable and efficient primer annealing by preventing nonspecific primers from annealing to the template and increasing the local concentration of primers at the template and allows efficient extension. This improvement therefore made it easy to group the pathogens into subsets for efficient amplification without much optimization, which allowed stable performance when new primers were added into primer mix or when the primers were changed [23] .",

The ability of differentiating virus types or subtypes relies on the sequences obtained from the targeted amplicons hybridization to the detector tiles. Thus, although a completely novel respiratory pathogen would not be captured by this approach, a mutant virus or an uncommon pathogen could be captured. Another benefit of association of targeted multiplex PCR and resequencing microarray is the simultaneous detection and Table 7 . Comparison of RPM-IVDC1 with GeXP-based PCR assay for detection of PIV1, PIV3, CoV-OC43, CoV-NL63, RSVB, hMPV, HBoV a . characterization of several viruses, which allows a significant time-savings compared to conventional assays or sequencing, and could be an important element in improving emergency response capacity. Another improvement of RPM-IVDC1 versus standard detection tools is the more comprehensive coverage of target organisms it allows. In contrast to RPM-Flu3.1, about 30% of which is dedicated to targeting all 16 HA and 9 NA alleles of avian influenza A viruses [26] , the new resequencing array design of RPM-IVDC1 allows more coverage of respiratory viral pathogens. The two main changes of the new microarray design compared to RPM-Flu3.1 were the length of the detector tiles and the primers selected for amplification of the chosen targets. The shortening of detector tiles allows an increase in the number of probe sets to be placed on the microarray, and therefore almost all common respiratory viral pathogens could be detected by RPM-IVDC1 in a single assay. Some atypical respiratory pathogens (e.g., measles virus, rubella virus and influenza C virus) and non-respiratory virus (e.g., HHV) could be detected by RPM-IVDC1, but the probes corresponding to these are not present in RPM-Flu3.1. Furthermore, the new technology, by using one or more pairs of primers designed for amplification of conserved regions, allows rapid and efficient strain-level identification for some pathogens, which may be critical in outbreak investigations.",

In this study, sixteen single-virus infected reference specimens were used to evaluate the new microarray. The results showed excellent specificity of the new microarray for type-or strain-level identification of some reference samples. As the new resequencing microarray was designed to be smaller than previous versions to increase the hybridization efficiency, the lengths of the detector tiles of RPM-IVDC1 were much shorter and the numbers of the tiles were relatively limited.

            "text": "As a result of the broad range of respiratory viruses identifiable with this assay, some atypical pathogens were detected using the new microarray. One instance of measles virus, one rubella virus and one influenza type C infection were found in patients aged 13 years, 13 years and 1 month, respectively. Rubella virus is the pathogenic agent of rubella, which is a common childhood infection but could affect anyone of any age, with the possible complications of fatal pneumonia [29] . As the causative agent of measles, the presence of the measles virus may also lead to serious problems, including measles pneumonia, which is a life-threatening complication in children [30] . Influenza C virus, which is sometimes present in patients with a clinical diagnosis of pneumonia, could cause a variety of respiratory illnesses that cannot be clinically differentiated from those caused by other viruses [31] . HHV is ubiquitous in humans, causing lifelong infection. After primary infection, which usually occurs during childhood, the virus remains latent in the ganglia of sensory neurons. Systemic stimuli including fever due to bacterial or viral infection can cause reaction of the virus [32] and potentially clinical disease, resulting in active secretion in the throat. Although there are few reports of symptomatic pulmonary involvement directly attributable to HHV infection [33] , the presence of HHV in the throat is still a highly significant and independent risk factor for the development of lower respiratory tract infections with HHV [32, 34] . Sequences of HHV-1 through HHV-6 were tiled on RPM-IVDC1 and 5 instances of HHV-1, 7 HHV-4 (EBV), 1 HHV-5 (CMV), 4 HHV-6 infections were detected using the RPM method, which was subsequently confirmed by PCR and sequencing. Of the 15 patients infected with HHV, 2 were coinfected with HHV-6 and HHV-4 and another one was coinfected with HHV-1 and HHV-4. HHV-6 virus, which causes roseola and fever after the primary infection, was identified in three children with ages under 5 and one aged 8. All HHV-1positive samples and 5 (71.4%) of 7 HHV-4-positive specimens were from adult patients; the frequency of HHV in the NPAs (13%) of adult patients were lower than found in a previous study (22%) [32] , which might be due to the difference between the sample characteristics. Although it is not possible in a retrospective study, and without the concomitant detection of bacterial pathogens, to state that these atypical pathogens were causative agents, the results of this study show the capability of RPM-IVDC1 for the detection of atypical pathogens and the potential for diagnosing infectious syndromes manifesting by similar symptoms but caused by diverse etiological agents.",

The RNA copy number was calculated after measuring the purified RNA concentration by spectrophotometry using Eppendorf Biophotometer (Eppendorf AG,Hamburg, Germany). For DNA viruses, the copy number of amplified plasmids was calculated after measuring the plasmid concentration using Eppendorf Biophotometer (Eppendorf AG, Hamburg, Germany). Ten-fold serial dilutions of these RNA/DNA templates with known copy numbers (10 to 100,000 copies/\u03bcl) were used to evaluate the sensitivity of the assay. A panel of six samples with different numbers of copies (1000, 500, 200, 100, 50 and 10) for each of the 16 organisms was prepared. Each sample was tested ten times over five days and the results were analyzed by SPSS 17.0 (IBM Corp.) to calculate the analytical sensitivity[21].",
