We estimated the effective vaccination rate for the population, with basic reproduction number (R 0 ) as the intermediate variable. Periodic EVD fluctuation was analyzed by solving a Jacobian matrix of differential equations based on a SIR (susceptible, infective, and removed) model. A comprehensive compartment model was constructed to fit and predict EVD transmission patterns, and to evaluate the effects of control and prevention measures. Effective EVD vaccination rates were estimated to be 42% (31-50%), 45% (42-48%), and 51% (44-56%) among susceptible individuals in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, respectively. In the absence of control measures, there would be rapid mortality in these three countries, and an EVD epidemic would be likely recur in 2035, and then again 8~9 years later. Oscillation intervals would shorten and outbreak severity would decrease until the periodicity reached~5.3 years. Measures that reduced the spread of EVD included: early diagnosis, treatment in isolation, isolating/monitoring close contacts, timely corpse removal, post-recovery condom use, and preventing or quarantining imported cases. EVD may re-emerge within two decades without control and prevention measures. Mass vaccination campaigns and control and prevention measures should be instituted to prevent future EVD epidemics.",

Within months, the disease had spread to Liberia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, and other countries [1, 2] . The World Health Organization (WHO) was notified officially of the rapid evolution of the EVD outbreak on March 23, 2014 [3] . A total of 26,277 EVD cases and 10,884 EVD-related deaths were reported from December 2013 to April 29, 2015 [4] . EVD was transmitted by direct and indirect contact between people. The mean incubation period was 11.4 days, and typical symptoms included fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and generalized pain [5] [6] [7] . The case fatality rate in the 2014 EVD outbreak was approximately 64% among patients who received treatment, and approximately 71% among all known infected patients [3] . The spread of the EVD outbreak was overwhelming and posed a serious threat to public health in Africa due to the high infection rate of EVD, ineffective control measures during the early-onset stage, local funeral customs, and weak epidemic prevention measures [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] .",

            "text": "Understanding the epidemiological distribution and transmission pattern of EVD during the African outbreak will contribute to improve scientific understanding and to allow the development of more effective control and prevention measures. Other scholars have already analyzed the epidemiological distribution and performance of clinical centers [3, 5, 13] , providing valuable information for better understanding the EVD outbreak. However, there is no recognized mathematical model that describes the process of EVD transmission, and that can be used to evaluate the effect of prevention measures. This lack of a model might hinder the process of controlling the disease. A dynamic transmission model of an infectious disease can be constructed by using the patterns of disease occurrence and transmission, and the relationships between the disease and social factors. Such a model is used to analyze the dynamic characteristics of disease transmission quantitatively, to indicate transmission patterns, and to predict the epidemiological trends of the disease. Dynamic transmission models have been constructed successfully for SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome), and malaria to analyze transmission patterns, predict epidemiological trends, and evaluate the effect of intervention measures [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . These models have provided important evidence for the scientific control and prevention of these diseases. In a previous study, researchers constructed an SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infective, removed) model to analyze the 1995 EVD outbreak in the Congo. The constructed model was well fitted and demonstrated to be effective for prediction [19] , indicating that a dynamic transmission model can be applied to the analysis of EVD outbreaks. However, the transmission patterns of infectious diseases are affected by many factors and can be variable across different time periods and regions. Therefore, the 1995 outbreak model may not be applicable to the 2014 outbreak, and it is necessary to construct an updated model based on the 2014-2015 transmission patterns and the factors that might influence spread.",

The numbers of EVD cases and EVD-related deaths predicted by the model were similar to the actual data (Fig 3) , indicating that the model simulated the epidemic pattern of EVD accurately. Modeling the effects of isolating close contacts on the epidemic trend of EVD Individuals in close contact with EVD patients are a high-risk population and are prone to infecting other susceptible individuals if they are not isolated and closely monitored. Therefore, quarantining the close contacts of EVD patients early is critical to control and prevent transmission of EVD. As shown in Fig 4A, quarantining close contacts of patients decreased the predicted incidence of EVD dramatically. By May 31 st , 2015, the cumulative number of EVD cases predicted without isolation of close contacts was 37% greater than the predicted number with isolation.",

Thus, to prevent the spread of disease, it is critical to take timely measures to decontaminate the corpses of dead EVD patients. Examples of these measures would include burning or deep burial. In contrast, the West African funeral custom of touching the corpses is prone to spreading the disease. The number of cumulative EVD cases could be decreased by shortening the interval between death and corpse decontamination Note that introduction of a new case every other day (0.5 cases/day, green) has a strong effect on amplitude relative to zero case importation (red). In all panels, the number of predicted EVD cases is plotted as a function of time. Effects of altering the time from symptom onset to treatment in isolation on the epidemic trend of EVD The average time from symptom onset to medical treatment in isolation for EVD patients is 5 days [3] . During this time, EVD patients have a high probability of infecting susceptible individuals. Early detection, diagnosis, and isolation can decrease the total number of EVD cases in an open environment, and early treatment can increase the EVD survival rate. A shorter interval between symptom onset and medical treatment in isolation led to fewer EVD cases and an earlier peak in the epidemic curve ( Fig 4C) . The dynamic model indicates that: if the average interval between symptom onset and treatment were shortened from 5 to 4 days (60% reduction) or 3 days (87% reduction), the number of EVD cases at the peak of the epidemic curve would be markedly decreased in amplitude, and shifted leftward to 16 or 40 days earlier, respectively.",

In this study, we constructed a dynamic transmission model to predict the epidemic trend of EVD and evaluated the effects of control and prevention measures. The key parameter in the model was the infection rate for patients in the free environment (\u03b2 I ). This parameter was influenced by a patient's sphere of activity, the virulence of the virus, and the proportion of susceptible people in the total population. Fluctuations in \u03b2 I may cause the results of the model to vary. Thus, it is important to fit an infection rate that approximates real values closely. Here, we found that the distribution of \u03b2 I was approximated by a gamma distribution, rather than by an exponential distribution as an earlier study reported [22] . This discrepancy may be due to differences in the nature of the EVD epidemics modeled. In the 2014 epidemic, most of the early EVD cases were located in the sparsely populated rural areas, and the patients had a limited sphere of activity. When the disease spread to urban areas, patients came into contact with more susceptible individuals, causing the \u03b2 I value to increase. Subsequently, isolation measures for EVD cases and improvements in public efforts at self-protection reduced the number of close contacts between EVD patients and the susceptible population, ultimately reducing the \u03b2 I value.",

These results support an overwhelming risk from an EVD outbreak. The SIR model also indicated that the s, i, and r populations fluctuate periodically around their dynamic equilibrium points. These results support the idea EVD epidemics may break out periodically, though the disease will reach a dynamic equilibrium point with a shorter period between epidemics of progressively weaker intensity. Periodic fluctuations of EVD epidemics are similar to those of other diseases, such as the measles and chickenpox [24, 25] . Therefore, we should be vigilant for the reemergence of EVD.",

Similarly, we found that the outbreak and spread of EVD could be controlled effectively through isolating patients early, quickly removing corpses, practicing \"safe\" sex after recovery, and strictly monitoring for imported cases. EVD patients were first reported in Guinea and then rapidly spread to neighboring countries that failed to prevent and manage imported cases effectively [1] . Preventing imported cases is a major way that countries can protect themselves from infectious disease. However, if imported cases do reach a country, an epidemic can still be prevented by rapidly implementing control and prevention measures.
