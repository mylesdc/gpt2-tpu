The inhibitory activity of seven phlorotannins (Ecklonia cava was tested against tyrosinase, which converts tyrosine into dihydroxyphenylalanine. Compounds 3 and 5 had IC 50 values of 7.0 \u00b1 0.2 and 8.8 \u00b1 0.1 \u00b5M, respectively, in competitive mode, with K i values of 8.2 \u00b1 1.1 and 5.8 \u00b1 0.8 \u00b5M. Both compounds showed the characteristics of slow-binding inhibitors over the time course of the enzyme reaction. Compound 3 had a single-step binding mechanism and compound 5 a two-step-binding mechanism. With stable AutoDock scores of \u22126.59 and \u22126.68 kcal/mol, respectively, compounds 3 and 5 both interacted with His85 and Asn260 at the active site.",

The overproduction and accumulation of melanin causes age spots, freckles, melisma, and hyperpigmentation [1, 2] . Tyrosinase (EC 1.14.18.1), which belongs to the type 3 copper protein family, is a key enzyme in melanogenesis [1, 3] . It is a multifunctional oxide that contains a copper in each of two sets of three histidine residues in the active site. [4] . Furthermore, it catalyzes the hydroxylation of l-tyrosine to l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA), and the subsequent oxidation of l-DOPA to DOPA quinone [3, 5] . These products are used in melanin biosynthesis [4] . Recently, the tyrosinase inhibitors kojic acid and arbutin were developed to improve skin whitening and as anti-hyperpigmentation agents [3, 6] . However, they had undesirable side effects, including dermatitis, skin irritation, and DNA damage [1, 4] . Much research has examined a variety of natural plants, with the aim of developing new inhibitors [7] . This study also sought alternative inhibitors without adverse effects.",

Phlorotannins, eckol, triphlorethol-A, phlorofucofuroeckol A, and dieckol, were reported to be isolated from this fraction [14, 15] . To isolate phlorotannins which have not been identified as tyrosinase inhibitors, dried E. cava powder (1.1 kg) was extracted by reflux with 80% ethanol for 72 h. The concentrated (80%) ethanol extract (290.0 g) was progressively divided into nhexane, ethyl acetate, and butanol layers. The ethyl acetate layer (54.9 g) was subjected to open column chromatography with silica gel and C-18 resin to obtain seven phlorotannins (1-7). By comparing spectroscopic data with reported results, the compounds were identified as triphlorethol A (1) [16] , eckol (2) [8] , 2-phloroeckol (3) [16] , phlorofucofuroeckol A (4) [12] , 2-O-(2,4,6trihydroxyphenyl)-6,6\u2032-bieckol (5) [17] , 6,8\u2032-bieckol (6) [18] , and 8,8\u2032-bieckol (7) [8] (Figure 1 ).

Morin, norartocarpetin, artogomezianone, and (-)-N-formylanonaine have been revealed as the potential inhibitors [4] [5] [6] [7] .

The IC 50 values of compounds 3 and 5 increased linearly with [S]/Km ( Figure 2B ). Furthermore, compounds 3 and 5 were produced with a set of the family liners by various inhibitors at substrate concentrations ranging from 0.156 to 2.50 mM. As shown in Lineweaver-Burk plots ( Figure 2C ,D), they had different values of \u22121/Km and the same 1/Vmax. The interactions with tyrosinase were competitive, with respective K i values of 8.2 \u00b1 1.1 and 5.8 \u00b1 0.8 \u00b5M based on Dixon plots ( Figure 2E ,F, Table 1 ). Phlorotannins from seaweeds have been used to develop the non-competitive tyrosinase inhibitors 7-phloroeckol, dieckol, and phlorofucofuroeckol A, and the competitive inhibitors phloroglucinol and eckstolonol [12, 13] . We found that compounds 3 and 5 competitively inhibited the catalysis of tyrosinase and might be useful for improving whitening. (Table 1) . Of these, compounds 3 and 5 had inhibitory activity at < 10 \u03bcM.",

Recently, secondary metabolites from terrestrial plants have been studied primarily for tyrosinase inhibitors [4] [5] [6] [7] . Morin, norartocarpetin, artogomezianone, and (-)-N-formylanonaine have been revealed as the potential inhibitors [4] [5] [6] [7] . Interest in the components from seaweed led to the study of the isolation of phlorotannin. It has been proven that they improve skin whitening [12, 13, 19] .

In comparison, the replot of k obs for compound 5 fit a hyperbolic equation (5) based on mechanism B (a two-step binding mechanism). This indicates that enzyme isomerization (E * I) results in slow bonding after the ligand rapidly interacts with the receptor [20, 21] . Table 2 shows the kinetic parameters for the time-dependent inhibition of tyrosinase by the inhibitors. The two strongest inhibitors had different slow-binding mechanisms. Inhibitor 5, which has a higher molecular weight, induced a new conformational state of the enzyme. Table 2 . Kinetics parameters of tyrosinase by compounds 3 and 5.",

This was added hydrogen atoms and assigned with gasteiger charges by using Autodocktools. Ligands were built and minimized energy by MM2 with Chem3D Pro. They were established the grid containing activity site with number of points (X: 80, Y: 80, Z: 80). DPS file was contained to set up Lamarckian genetic algorithm for docking of the ligand into receptor (runs 50 and the maximum number was set as long). Their results were represented with Chimera (version 3.13.1, San Francisco, CA, USA) and LigPlot (version 4.5.3, Cambridge, UK).",

            "text": "Seven phlorotannins (1-7) from E. cava were isolated using column chromatography and their structures were identified by spectral analysis. Of these, compounds 3 and 5 potentially inhibited the catalytic reaction of tyrosinase by blocking the entrance to the active site. Moreover, compounds 3 and 5 altered the turnover rate from substrate to the enzyme product over time. The former underwent simple reversible slow binding with the enzyme, while the latter initially formed a complex (EI) with the enzyme quickly, followed by an isomerization step to create a new enzyme-type complex (E*I). Phlorotannins containing flexible phloroglucinol to eckol backbone were found the facts bound easily into active site of tyrosinase. The findings suggested the phloroglucinol may be key moiety for induced fit of inhibitor with enzyme flexibility. The molecular simulation study indicated that the two inhibitors were docked at the active site of tyrosinase with AutoDock scores or \u22126.59 and \u22126.68 kcal/mol, respectively. Both compounds used the amino acids His85 and Asn260 to maintain their connection with tyrosinase. These findings imply that 2-phloroeckol (3) and 2-O-(2,4,6-trihydroxyphenyl)-6,6 -bieckol (5) might inhibit the production of melanin products.",
