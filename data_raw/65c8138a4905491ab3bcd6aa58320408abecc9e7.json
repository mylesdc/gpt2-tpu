            "text": "While novel picornaviruses are being discovered in rodents, their host range and pathogenicity are largely unknown. We identified two novel picornaviruses, rosavirus B from the street rat, Norway rat, and rosavirus C from five different wild rat species (chestnut spiny rat, greater bandicoot rat, Indochinese forest rat, roof rat and Coxing's white-bellied rat) in China. Analysis of 13 complete genome sequences showed that \"Rosavirus B\" and \"Rosavirus C\" represent two potentially novel picornavirus species infecting different rodents. Though being most closely related to rosavirus A, rosavirus B and C possessed distinct protease cleavage sites and variations in Yn-Xm-AUG sequence in 5'UTR and myristylation site in VP4. Anti-rosavirus B VP1 antibodies were detected in Norway rats, whereas anti-rosavirus C VP1 and neutralizing antibodies were detected in Indochinese forest rats and Coxing's white-bellied rats. While the highest prevalence was observed in Coxing's white-bellied rats by RT-PCR, the detection of rosavirus C from different rat species suggests potential interspecies transmission. Rosavirus C isolated from 3T3 cells causes multisystemic diseases in a mouse model, with high viral loads and positive viral antigen expression in organs of infected mice after oral or intracerebral inoculation. Histological examination revealed alveolar fluid exudation, interstitial infiltration, alveolar fluid exudate and wall thickening in lungs, and hepatocyte degeneration and lymphocytic/monocytic inflammatory infiltrates with giant cell formation in liver sections of sacrificed mice. Since rosavirus A2 has been detected in fecal samples of children, further studies should elucidate the pathogenicity and emergence potential of different rosaviruses.",

Initial screening by RT-PCR for a 159-bp fragment of 3D pol gene of picornaviruses was positive in 18 respiratory and 24 alimentary samples from 37 rodents of six different species. The sequences from these positive samples had <84% aa identities to the corresponding segments of 3D pol genes of known picornaviruses, suggesting the presence of potential novel picornaviruses. Subsequent RT-PCR using specific primers targeting these potential novel picornaviruses on the 2450 samples was positive in 62 respiratory and 70 alimentary samples from 92 rodents. The sequences from these 132 samples had <86% aa identities to the corresponding segments of 3D pol genes of known picornaviruses, being most closely related to Rosavirus A. Moreover, these sequences fell into two distinct clusters, one formed by sequences from wild rodents of five different species from Hong Kong (chestnut spiny rat, greater bandicoot rat, Indochinese forest rats and roof rat) and Hunan and Guangxi (Coxing's white-bellied rat), and the other formed by sequences from street rodents from Hong Kong (Norway rat) ( Table 1 and Fig 1) . This suggested the presence of two potentially novel picornavirus species, \"Rosavirus B\" and \"Rosavirus C. \" Viral sequences belonging to \"Rosavirus B\" were only detected from the street rodent species, Norway rat (Rattus norvegicus), whereas sequences belonging to \"Rosavirus C\" were detected from five different wild rodent species, greater bandicoot rat (Bandicota indica), chestnut spiny rat (Niviventer fulvescens), roof rat (Rattus rattus) and Indochinese forest rat (Rattus andamanensis) from Hong Kong, and Coxing's white-bellied rat (Niviventer coxingi) from Hunan and Guangxi. Among the five wild rodent species, rosavirus C showed the highest detection rate in Coxing's white-bellied rats. qRT-PCR showed that the viral load of rosavirus B and C in the positive samples ranged from 1.7 \u00d710 4 to 1.6\u00d710 8 copies/ml.",

As a result, there has been growing interest to understand the diversity and evolution of animal and zoonotic viruses. For picornaviruses, numerous novel human and animal picornaviruses have been discovered in the past decade [1, [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . We have also discovered a novel picornavirus, canine picodicistrovirus (CPDV), with two internal ribosome entry site (IRES) elements, which represents a unique feature among Picornaviridae [28] . Moreover, novel picronaviruses were identified in previously unknown animal hosts such as cats, bats and camels [29] [30] [31] , reflecting our slim knowledge on the diversity and host range of picornaviruses. The discovery and characterization of novel picornaviruses is important for better understanding of their evolution, pathogenicity and emergence potential.",

Moreover, little is known about the pathogenicity of the recently discovered rodent pricornaviruses, such as rodent stool-associated picornavirus (rosavirus) A1, mouse stool-associated picornavirus (mosavirus) A1, Norway rat hunnivirus and rat-borne virus (rabovirus A) [32, 33] . In this report, we explored the diversity of picornaviruses among rodents in China and discovered two potentially novel picornaviruses, \"Rosavirus B\" and \"Rosavirus C\". While rosavirus B was detected in the street rat, Norway rats, rosavirus C was detected in five different wild rat species, suggesting potential interspecies transmission. Their complete genome sequences were determined, which showed that \"Rosavirus B\" and \"Rosavirus C\" represent two novel picornavirus species distinct from Rosavirus A. Rosavirus C isolated from cell culture causes multisystemic diseases in a mouse model, with histopathological changes and positive viral antigen expression in lungs and liver of infected mice.",

These 13 strains were selected because they were detected from different rodent species or geographical locations (Hong Kong, Hunan and Guangxi) to allow comparison between host species-or geographically distinct strains. The G + C contents of the three rosavirus B and 10 rosavirus C genomes range from 50 to 53%, with genome size 8639 to 9094 bases, after excluding the polyadenylated tract (Table 2) . However, the genome sizes of some strains may be larger, as further sequencing of the ends may have been hampered by secondary structures. They share similar genome organization typical of picornaviruses, with UTR at both 5' (470-752 bases) and 3' (693-948 bases) ends, and a large open reading frame of 7449-7476 bases, which encodes potential polyprotein precursors of 2482-2491 aa known to be cleaved by virus-encoded proteases.

            "text": "Comparison of genome features of rosavirus B and C to those of rosavirus A is summarized in Table 4 . The conserved sequence Yn-Xm-AUG is present in the 5'UTR of rosavirus B and C. While Y7-X19-AUG is found in rosavirus A, the number of Y (6 or 7) and X (19-21) varies among rosavirus B and C. The putative translation initiation sites were contained by an optimal Kozak context (RNNAUGG), with in frame AUG at position 471 to 753. The 5'UTR of many picornaviruses possesses an internal ribosomal entry site/segment (IRES) which is responsible for directing the initiation of translation in a cap-independent manner, and requires both canonical translation initiation and IRES trans-acting factors [3, 34] . Similar to rosavirus A [32] , rosavirus B and C also contained a type II-like IRES with stem loops, major domains [19, 27, [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] and conserved motifs (Fig 3) . However, domain E was only present in rosavirus C strains, RASK8F, RATLC11A, NFSM6F and RASM14A, and rosavirus B strain RNYL1109081R, but not other strains. The pyrimidine-rich region was located near 3' end of 5'UTR. One to three stem-loop structures were present upstream of the start codon and/or between the pyrimidine-rich region and start codon of the polyprotein [41, 42] . The predicted \"VP0\" of rosavirus B and C are probably cleaved into VP4 and VP2 based on sequence alignment [32] . In contrast to rosavirus A of which the VP4 possessed the myristylation site, GXXX [ST] , involved in capsid assembly or virus entry [43] , such myristylation site is absent Table 3 . Coding potential and putative proteins of \"Rosavirus B\" and \"Rosavirus C\" compared to Rosavirus A. in rosavirus C and variably present in rosavirus B (present in strains RNCW0602091R and RNCW1002091R but absent in strain RNYL1109081R). The predicted 2A of rosavirus B and C exhibited 45.1% aa identities to that of rosavirus A, possessed the conserved H-box/NC involved in cell proliferation control, but not Asn-Pro-Gly-Pro (NPGP) motifs [44, 45] . Their predicted 2C possessed GXXGXGKS motif for NTP-binding [46] and DDLXQ motif for putative helicase activity [47] . Their predicted 3C pro contained the catalytic triad H-D-C [48] , conserved GXCG motif in the protease active site and GXH motif [49, 50] . Their predicted 3D pol contained conserved KDE[LI]R, GG[LMN]PSG, YGDD and FLKR motifs [51] , although the second Gly was replaced by Ala in GG[LMN]PSG. Although rosavirus C were detected in five different rodent species from Hong Kong, Hunan and Guangxi, no major distinct genome features were identified between strains from different rodent species or geographical locations. Yet, the two strains from Coxing's white-bellied rat from Hunan (NCHN06IO) and Guangxi (NCGX12IN), were always clustered together in the P1, P2 and P3 trees, suggesting that geographically distinct strains may be genetically closely related (Fig 2) . These two strains from mainland China possessed a total of 432 unique nucleotide substitutions over the entire genomes compared to the other eight rosavirus C strains from Hong Kong.",

Its absence in some rosavirus strains suggests that rosaviruses may utilize alternative strategies for capsid localization on cellular targets. In addition, the variations in Yn-Xm-AUG sequence in 5'UTR may also suggest different translational dynamics among rosaviruses. Besides phylogenetic and genomic evidence, the two viruses infect different host, with \"Rosavirus B\" infecting Norway rats (a street rat) and \"Rosavirus C\" known to infect different rodents [32, 33, 54] . Rosavirus A was first discovered in a wild canyon mouse (Peromyscus crinintus) in California [32] . Subsequently, a variant, rosavirus 2, was detected in the fecal specimens of children in the Gambia [26] , which prompted further studies to investigate potential transmission of rosavirus from rodents to humans. In this study, the observed low Ka/Ks ratios in various coding regions supported that Norway rats (street rats) in Hong Kong, and wild rats across Hong Kong and mainland China, are natural reservoirs of rosavirus B and C respectively. In particular, Coxing's white-bellied rats appeared to be an important host for rosavirus C. The relatively low seroprevalence of rosavirus C, as compared to RT-PCR detection rate, among tested Coxing's white-bellied rats (7.5%) may be due to delayed antibody response during acute infection when the animals were still shedding viruses. Together with the ability of rosavirus C in infecting house mouse (Mus musculus), our findings provided evidence for the interspecies transmission potential of rosavirus C among different rodent species. This is in line with the ability of bat picornaviruses group 1 to 3 in infecting bats of different genera or species [29] . Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), of which swine is the major reservoir, can also infect different animals including rodents, elephants, boars, macaques and humans [55] . Further investigations are warranted to elucidate the ability of rosaviruses to cross species barrier and emerge in other animals or human.",

Rodent pathogens may infect human either by direct contact such as bites and inhalation of aerosolized animal excreta, or indirectly through vectors such as ticks and fleas. Urban rodents may pose particular risk to human health, as in the case of Hantavirus and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infections. More epidemiological studies should be performed to explore the diversity of rodent picornaviruses and their potential risks to human.",

Briefly, after centrifugation, samples were diluted five folds with viral transport medium and filtered. Filtrates were inoculated to Minimum Essential Media (MEM) and the mixtures were added to 24-well tissue culture plates by adsorption inoculation. After 1 h of adsorption, excess inoculum was discarded, and the wells were washed twice with phosphate buffered saline and replaced by serum-free MEM. Cultures were inspected daily by inverted microscopy for CPE. Subculturing to fresh cell line was performed from time to time even if there was no CPE and culture lysates were collected for RT-PCR for monitoring viral replication.

Streptavidin/peroxidase complex reagent (Vector Laboratories) was then added and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. Cells infected or uninfected by rosavirus C RASM14A were included as positive and negative controls respectively in each staining.
