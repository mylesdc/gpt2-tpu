            "text": "The genetic variability of Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is one of the main challenges for its control, hindering not only the development of effective vaccination strategies but also its classification and, consequently, epidemiology understanding. The 624/I and Q1 genotypes, now recognized to be part of the GI-16 lineage, represent an excellent example of the practical consequences of IBV molecular epidemiology limited knowledge. In fact, being their common origin unrecognized for a long time, independent epidemiological pictures were drawn for the two genotypes. To fix this misinterpretation, the present study reconstructs the history, population dynamics and spreading patterns of GI-16 lineage as a whole using a phylodynamic approach. A collection of worldwide available hypervariable region 1 and 2 (HVR12) and 3 (HVR3) sequences of the S1 protein was analysed together with 258 HVR3 sequences obtained from samples collected in Italy (the country where this genotype was initially identified) since 1963. The results demonstrate that after its emergence at the beginning of the XX century, GI-16 was able to persist until present days in Italy. Approximately in the late 1980s, it migrated to Asia, which became the main nucleus for further spreading to Middle East, Europe and especially South America, likely through multiple introduction events. A remarkable among-country diffusion was also demonstrated in Asia and South America. Interestingly, although most of the recent Italian GI-16 strains originated from ancestral viruses detected in the same country, a couple were closely related to Chinese ones, supporting a backward viral flow from China to Italy. Besides to the specific case-study results, this work highlights the misconceptions that originate from the lack of a unified nomenclature and poor molecular epidemiology data generation and sharing. This shortcoming appears particularly relevant since the described scenario could likely be shared by many other IBV genotypes and pathogens in general.",

            "text": "Gammacoronavirus, family Coronaviridae. The viral genome is about 27 Kb long and encodes for different proteins, such as the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), numerous accessory and regulatory proteins and the Spike, Envelope, Membrane, and Nucleocapsid structural proteins [1] . IBV currently represents one of the most relevant diseases of poultry farming, being responsible for respiratory signs, reproductive disorders and relevant mortality, particularly in presence of nephropathogenic strains or secondary infections [2] . Similarly to other RNA viruses, it is characterized by high evolutionary and recombination rates, which drive the rapid evolution of this pathogen and lead to a remarkable genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity [3] . The Spike protein, further processed in the S1 and S2 sub-units, is by far the most studied viral protein because of its relevance in viral life-cycle and host interaction. Besides being involved in viral attachment and viral-host membranes fusion, it is also the main target of the host neutralizing immune response [1, 4] . Its remarkable variability has several implications, the most practical one being the poor cross protection among different viral strains and genotypes [5] , which severely hinders the infection and disease control through vaccination. Additionally, the genetic variability has also complicated the viral classification, leading to the proposal of a multitude of genotypes based on specific research studies or local investigations, in absence of shared criteria. Although it could appear a mere nomenclature issue, this state of affairs had astonishing implications impeding or confusing the proper understanding of IBV molecular epidemiology.",

Until then, the two genotypes had been named (and considered) independent: the 624/I was first reported in Italy in 1993 [8] , and thereafter in Slovenia [9], Poland [10], and Russia [11] . Moreover, retrospective studies demonstrated its wide circulation in Italy since the early 1960s [12] , where it remained the most prevalent genotype for more than a decade. However, from the 1990s, its detection and reporting became sporadic or absent. At the same time, in 1996, a new IBV strain (later renamed Q1) was identified in animals affected by proventriculitis [13] in China and thereafter in other Asian [14, 15], Middle Eastern [16, 17] , South American [18, 19] and European countries [7, [20] [21] [22] . Remarkably, not recognizing the relationship between these strains, a new spread from Asia was supposed, similarly what was proven for the GI-19 lineage (QX genotype) [23] . Data recently published by Laconi et al. [24] strongly suggest a common origin between the 624I and Q1 genotypes, however the actual origin and dispersal pattern of GI-16 lineage could not be inferred confidently.",

After recombinants removal, the absence of residual breakpoints was confirmed with SBP implemented in HyPhy [30] . Only sequences with collection date and country were included in the study. Dedicated Python scripts were used to extract this information from the Genbank file or, if absent, original publications were consulted and the sequences were re-named accordingly. Finally, TempEst [31] was used to investigate the 'temporal signal' of the heterochronous sequences under investigation and the sequences whose sampling date was inconsistent with their genetic divergence and phylogenetic position were removed. Indeed, significant deviations from the expectation under the molecular clock hypothesis can be due to several factors including low sequencing quality, excessive passaging, recombination, etc. [31] . Xia test was performed for each codon position to exclude the presence of codon saturation and loss of phylogeny signal. In fact, when full saturation is reached, the phylogenetic signal is lost and the sequences are no longer informative about the underlying evolutionary processes.",

More specifically, a maximum of 5 sequences for each country-year pair were randomly selected and included in the study. For each dataset the time to Most Recent Common Ancestor (tMRCA), the evolutionary rates (substitutions/sites/year) and viral population dynamics (expressed as Effective population size (Ne)\ufffdgeneration time (t), also called relative genetic diversity) were jointly estimated in a Bayesian fashion using the serial coalescent approach implemented in BEAST 1.8.4 [33] . Additionally, the discrete state phylogeographic approach implemented in the same program was used to reconstruct the viral spreading pattern, assuming each collection country as a strain feature [34] . This method allows to estimate the location and time of ancestral strains, calibrated using the implemented molecular clock and population model. Additionally, the use of the Bayesian Stochastic Search Variable Selection (BSSVS) allows for a Bayesian Factor (BF) test that identifies the most parsimonious description of the spreading process, highlighting the most relevant and significant viral migration routes [35] . The nucleotide substitution model (i.e. GTR+\u0393 4 ) was selected based on the results of Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) calculated using Jmodeltest [28] , while molecular clock (relaxed lognormal molecular clock [35] ), population model (Bayesian skyline [36] ) and phylogeographic substitution model (symmetric substitution model) were selected based on the BF value, calculated using the marginal likelihood of different models, estimated with the Path Sampling (PS) and Stepping Stone (SS) method [37] .",

In fact, these emerging variants are typically peculiar from a genetic perspective, which is incompatible with the recent differentiation from already known genotypes. Actually, the estimates of tMRCA of circulating lineages often largely backdate their first identification [23] .

In fact, this lineage includes two genotypes that have been considered independent for a long time: the 624/I and Q1. The first one was firstly recognized in 1993 in Italy, albeit retrospective studies demonstrated the local circulation since 1963 [12] , where it likely had a prominent role in IBV epidemiology. Nevertheless, its relevance appeared to gradually vanish during the 1990s. Almost simultaneously, a new genotype, often named Q1, emerged in China and was then reported in other Asian, Middle East, European and South American countries, being responsible of devastating economic losses [16, 21, 22, 39] . The present phylodynamic analysis demonstrates a common origin of 624/I and Q1, which has been estimated approximately at the beginning or middle of the XX century, depending on the considered genomic region. Nevertheless, the lower sequence number and shorter time window covered by HVR12 database pose in favor of the HVR3 based analysis reliability. Anyhow, these results testify the long lasting undetected circulation of this genotype in Italy. The absence of adequate monitoring and diagnostic tools at that time clearly justifies this evidence, which could be realistically extended to most of current IBV genotypes. Unfortunately, the lack of sequences relative to the period before 1963 prevents the precise reconstruction of viral population dynamics in this time frame. However, the skyline profile, especially from the 1960s onward, when actual data became available, shows that GI-16 was able to circulate and persist in Italy at low level until the 1980s, when a remarkable increase in relative genetic diversity was observed. The reason behind this variation in the epidemiological scenario are hard to explain. However, a progressive intensification of poultry production, leading to higher animal density, turnover and presence of several concomitant stressing factors and co-infections could have created favorable conditions for the rise of acute respiratory infections like IBV. Similarly obscure are the causes of the GI-16 decline in the late 1980s-early 1990s. An upgrade in the vaccination strategies was applied in the 1990s, through the introduction of 793B based vaccines [20] . A Mass plus 793B combined vaccination was proven effective in protecting against GI-16 induced disease [39] , and could therefore justify the observed scenario. However, the new protocol was effectively introduced only in the last part of the decade. Consequently, even if it could have actually contributed to this genotype control, other factors, like changes in farm management or progressive increase of population immunity, must have played a role. Interestingly, an autogenous inactivated 624/I based vaccine (strain 794/83FO), administered at 1d of age, was introduced in the routine vaccination protocols of several farms in the Emilia Romagna Region in the late 80's. Although inactivated vaccines are traditionally considered less effective, a contribution in decreasing animal susceptibility and thus viral circulation can be suggested.",

The virus introduction from Europe to China could be ascribable to live animal movements, in particular of breeders that were imported to improve and/or substitute the local genetic lines [40] . Additionally, it must be stressed that, even if the inferred link involved Italy and China, the GI-16 lineage was probably present before the 1990s (undetected, improperly characterized or unsequenced) in several European countries, which could have played a relevant role in the eastward viral spread. However, extremely poor data reporting live poultry import and export from China are present and most of the countries considered in the present study declare no trade flows with China [14, 18] . Therefore, other sources of viral spreading must be considered and the Phylodynamic analysis of IBV GI-16 lineage role of wild birds is often considered as a suggestive hypothesis. In fact, circulation of IBVrelated Gamma-coronaviruses in wild species, including migratory birds, has been reported, sometimes with high prevalence [41] [42] [43] . An involvement of these species in the spread of GI-16 can not be a priori excluded, especially over relatively short/medium distances (e.g within Europe and Asia or between these two regions) covered by recognized flyways. However, although the overlap between the East Asia/Australasia and East Asia/East Africa with the Pacific America and Central America flyways could explain the GI-16 introduction to South America, the extreme distance coupled with the absence of detection of this genotype in North America discount this hypothesis. Additionally, it must be stressed that GI-16 and other \"wild type\" genotypes have never been identified in wild birds and further studies will be necessary to properly and systematically investigate the role of wild birds in IBV epidemiology. In this background, other explanations like illegal or unreported animal trades appear more likely.",

How this group was able to persist between the 1990s and the 2000s remains an unsolved question. A low-level circulation could clearly be advocated. Nevertheless, it must be stressed that the first identification of GI-16 was performed in the 1990s. Additionally, three sequences of Italian GI-16, originating from research rather than diagnostic activity, were obtained in 1994, 1997 and 1999 [8, 10, 44] and similar strains were detected in the same period in a nearby country [9] .

Consequently, the effect of a remarkably lower sequencing activity in the 1990s compared to present days cannot be under-emphasized and its consequences in terms of poor knowledge should be a reprimand to guide current monitoring activities planning.",

To investigate this issue, an ancestral state reconstruction of the amino-acid profile variation over time was performed using a Maximum-likelihood approach (S3 Fig). Albeit some amino-acid changes were detected in the clade including contemporary Italian strains, no distinctive mutations differentiating this group from their ancestors were identified, at least in the considered region. While the \"local evolution\" hypothesis appears lessened by this evidence, further studies will be necessary to investigate the potential role of other S1/genomic regions.",

On the other hand, the clinical impact of this lineage in Italy was negligible in the recent years. The competition with the highly prevalent lineage GI-19 could have actually limited the potential of GI-16 in terms of prevalence and clinical relevance [20] . Additionally, the previously mentioned introduction of a combined heterologous vaccination in Italy (in South America flocks were vaccinated with Mass-based vaccines only) could have effectively protected the animals [45] , avoiding the emergence of clinical signs and related economic losses.",

Interestingly, amino-acid in position 47 of South American strain was identical to the one featuring the ancient, and clinically relevant, Italian strains (S3 Fig) [46] .
