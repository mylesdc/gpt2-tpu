This coronavirus has been widely distributed among laboratories and has been passaged both within pigs and in cell culture. To determine the variability between different stocks of the PEDV strain CV777, sequencing of the full-length genome (ca. 28kb) has been performed in 6 different laboratories, using different protocols. Not surprisingly, each of the different full genome sequences were distinct from each other and from the reference sequence (Accession number AF353511) but they are >99% identical. Unique and shared differences between sequences were identified. The coding region for the surface-exposed spike protein showed the highest proportion of variability including both point mutations and small deletions. The predicted expression of the ORF3 gene product was more dramatically affected in three different variants of this virus through either loss of the initiation codon or gain of a premature termination codon. The genome of one isolate had a substantially rearranged 5\u00b4-terminal sequence. This rearrangement was validated through the analysis of sub-genomic mRNAs from infected cells. It is clearly important to know the features of the specific sample of CV777 being used for experimental studies.

            "text": "Introduction Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) is the causative agent of an infectious disease, termed PED, which was initially recognized in the UK in 1971. The prototypic early European strain of PEDV was first characterized from infected pigs in 1978 and was named CV777 [1] . The virus is now classified as a member of the Alphacoronavirus genus within the family Coronaviridae. The CV777 strain has been propagated both in pigs and in Vero cell cultures. Like other coronaviruses, the virus particles have a characteristic \"corona-like\" morphology due to the presence of the surface exposed spike (S) protein. These viruses are enveloped and contain a positive sense RNA genome that is about 28,000 nucleotides (nt) in length; the complete genome sequence of the CV777 strain has been assembled [2] (Accession no. AF353511).",

            "text": "The disease is characterised by diarrhoea and vomiting leading to severe dehydration with high mortality among young piglets and hence severe economic losses. During the 1980's and 1990's, the disease spread within Europe and also in Asia where it has caused significant problems (reviewed in [3, 4, 5] ). After this time, the disease declined within Europe and very few cases have been recorded there until recently. However, a new wave of PEDV infections occurred from 2010 onwards in China and adjacent countries [6] and the disease spread, for the first time, into the USA in 2013 [7] . Indeed, it appears that there have been two separate introductions of distinct PEDV strains into the USA [7, 8] . These viruses differ significantly within the sequence of the S gene (encoding the spike protein); these distinct strains have been classified as being within different genogroups (1b and 2b) based on the sequence of the S gene alone. These two strains of PEDV are also referred to as \"INDEL\" and \"non-INDEL\" respectively, reflecting the presence or absence of insertions and deletions within the S gene sequence (prototypic strains are: USA/OH851/2014, GenBank accession no. KJ399978, [9] and USA/ Kansas29/2013, GenBank accession no. KJ645637.1, [10] respectively). However, neither form of nomenclature is entirely satisfactory. Indeed, both of these US variants of PEDV have been classified as being within genotype 2, based on complete genome sequences [5] , while the early European strains, e.g. CV777, are in genotype 1.",

The resultant sequences have now been compared. Not surprisingly, each of the sequences obtained is different although closely related. The use of NGS on RNA isolated from infected cells also allowed evaluation of the sequences and relative levels of the various sub-genomic viral mRNAs.

The 52 nt deletion in the IZSLER and FLI sequences described above, also removes the initiation codon for the ORF3 from these viruses and thus no expression of a functional ORF3 protein can be expected (Fig 2) . There is also a 3 nt deletion (nt 25201-25203) in the residual ORF3 coding sequence within the FLI strain which would make for an in-frame deletion but since the initiation codon is lost then this is probably not significant. Interestingly the APHA sequence lacks just 2 nt (nt 25202-25203) at this point (Fig 3) . The presence of this 2 nt deletion has been confirmed using Sanger sequencing of a conventional RT-PCR amplicon including this region. The deletion results in the production of a new, in-frame, stop codon and hence premature termination of the ORF3 protein (Fig 3) . It is predicted that the truncated ORF3 product is 137 aa in length, compared to 224 aa for the reference sequence.

Due to the sequencing strategies used not all the sequences are complete. The Br1/87 (DTU) terminal sequence is extensively rearranged (see text for details) and contains a region (in black italics) that is the \"reverse complement\" of part of the reference sequence (boxed italics). Two single nt changes were found in the APHA sequence, marked in bold type, one change was shared with the ANSES sequence. The TRS-L is also indicated. The > symbol indicates that additional sequence is present (but not shown here) at the 5t erminus in the DTU sequence. leader sequence that spans from nt 11 and into stem loop 4 (SL4, see [21] ), of the reference sequence (Fig 6) . The presence of this extensive self-complementary sequences means than a large stem-loop structure can be formed at the 5\u00b4-terminus of the genomic RNA (see Fig 5  (C) ). Interestingly, within the minority of reads that correspond to the reference CV777 sequence there is a single nt change (A to G) corresponding to nt position 8 in the reference sequence that matches one of the two changes observed in the APHA and ANSES CV777 sequences (see above). Thus, it seems that there is heterogeneity within the Br1/87 virus population and that the majority of genomes and the sub-genomic mRNAs produced within infected cells have a rearranged 5'-UTR compared to the consensus CV777 genome. Clearly, the presence of the \"reverse complement\" sequence indicates that the modified sequence is not just random rearrangement. Furthermore, interestingly, it is possible to derive a secondary structure model for the 5'-terminal stem loop structure of the Br1/87 sequence (SL1, see [21] ) that appears similar to that predicted for the CV777 sequence and could be an alternative for [21] . The structure, termed SL1, closest to the terminus, in the CV777 reference strain is indicated in panel (a). A similar structure, predicted for the consensus Br1/87 sequence, is shown in panel (b). Note, the sequence marked in blue is the \"reverse complement\" of the sequence marked in red from panel (a). The conserved stems within SL1 are boxed but the apical loop region is distinct. In panel (c), a comparison of secondary structure predictions derived by M-fold for the CV777 5\u00b4-terminal sequence (i) and the consensus Br1/87 sequence (ii), are shown. The structures have the same apical loops as the SL1 structure shown in panels (a) and (b). The extended sequences (in blue), that include self-complementary regions extending beyond the TRS are indicated in panel (c) (iii). The complementary sequences (e.g. the sense and anti-sense SL2 regions) can simply base pair to each other to form an extended stem-loop structure that can be present at the 5\u00b4-terminus of the genomic and sub-genomic mRNAs (see also Fig 6) . the usual SL1 structure (see Fig 5A and 5B ). In particular, the stem regions are completely conserved even though the upper stem in the Br1/87 sequence is the \"reverse complement\" of the CV777 SL1 sequence. However, the terminal loop sequence of the predicted SL1 is completely different, (CUACGG in CV777 and CCGUAG in Br1/87).",

For the FLI and IZSLER strains, the initiation codon for ORF3 has been deleted (as part of the 52nt deletion that removed the usual termination codon of the S gene, see Fig 2) and thus the correct protein product cannot be expressed. In the APHA sequence, a 2 nt deletion within the ORF3 coding region is predicted to cause premature termination of the protein (Table 1 and Fig 3) . Thus, 3 of the strains studied here do not seem to be able to produce an intact and functional ORF3 product. It has been noted previously that the ORF3 coding region of the CV777 strain is highly variable (see [2] ). The function of this ORF in PEDV is not yet clear.",

            "text": "The Br1/87 virus was found to contain a significantly different sequence at the 5'-terminus of the genome compared to the others. From the consensus sequence derived from the NGS data, it appears that some rearrangement of these terminal sequences has occurred in most of the genomes. This does not appear to be a simple artefact since the derived sequence includes the \"reverse complement\" of a part of the reference virus sequence. It is possible to predict an alternative, but closely related SL1 structure for the Br1/87 sequence that maintains the sequence of the two stems of the CV777 SL1 (c.f. Fig 5(A) and 5(B) ) but has a distinct apical loop. Recent studies have revealed conservation of this SL1 loop structure and an essential role in virus replication [21, 24] . Additional support for this rearranged sequence was derived from the sequence of reads corresponding to sub-genomic mRNAs (see Fig 6) . It is currently unclear what effect the presence of the rearranged 5\u00b4-terminal sequence in the Br1/87 genomic RNA and sub-genomic mRNAs will have on the function of these transcripts. It can be envisaged that the presence of a stable hairpin structure at the 5'-termini of these RNAs would be strongly inhibitory to cap-dependent translation initiation (see [25, 26] ) and thus the production of viral proteins can be expected to be low. Furthermore, it is interesting to note that the proportion of sub-genomic mRNA reads containing the rearranged leader fused to the S protein coding region is unexpectedly high (see S4 Table) . This is not the case for the reads corresponding to the sub-genomic mRNAs including the CV777 5\u00b4-terminal sequence, which is consistent with previous data (e.g. see [27] ). This requires further study but it may suggest that the modified leader becomes part of the transcript that encodes the S protein with a higher efficiency than to the other sub-genomic mRNA sequences. Thus, the ratio of viral proteins produced could also be affected.",

It should be noted that since the RNA was isolated from the infected cells then these samples contain both the full-length genomic RNA and also the sub-genomic PEDV mRNAs. In brief, DNA depletion was performed on the extracted nucleic acids using DNAse I and then 1 st strand cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript III (Invitrogen) using random hexamer primers (pN 6 ). The RNA was removed from the 1 st strand cDNA using RNAse H and 2 nd strand synthesis was achieved using the NEBNext mRNA second strand synthesis kit (New England Biolabs). The ds cDNA was purified (GeneJET PCR purification kit) and quantified. Samples were sequenced at the DTU Multi-Assay Core (DMAC, Kgs. Lyngby, Denmark) using the Nextera-XT DNA library Preparation kit and a MiSeq with Reagent Kit v3 600 bp (Illumina Inc, San Diego, CA, USA). The sequence reads were analysed using CLC Genomics (Qiagen) and Geneious software (v. 6.1.8; Biomatters). b) IZSLER. The virus isolate used at IZSLER is designated CV777. A lyophilized virus sample, 5 th passage in Vero cells, was provided, in 2003, from the University of Gent that had received it from Switzerland. The CV777 was then grown in Vero cells until the 9 th passage that was used for the NGS. There is no information available about the virulence of this strain in pigs. RNA was extracted from 200 \u03bcl of virus culture supernatant using the TRIzol method (QIAzol Lysis Reagent, QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions and was resuspended in 10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8. Reverse transcription was performed with this total RNA using the SuperScript1 III First-Strand Synthesis SuperMix (Invitrogen, CA, USA) using random hexamer primers, according to the manufacturer's protocol. The complete genome sequence was assembled following amplification of 7 overlapping long PCR products covering the whole genome from the cDNA using the AccuPrime\u2122 Taq DNA Polymerase High Fidelity kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The primers used are described in S5 Table. The PCR products were purified by Nucleospin1 gel and PCR clean-up (Macherey-Nagel, D\u00fcren, Germany) and quantified. The sequencing libraries were prepared using the Nextera-XT DNA library Preparation kit (Illumina Inc.), purified according to the manufacturer's protocol and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq using the Miseq Reagent Kit v2, 250-cycle paired-end run (Illumina Inc.). Reads were analyzed using the SeqMan module of DNASTAR software package (Lasergene, Madison, USA). c) ANSES. The CV777 strain was obtained from Dr. M. B. Pensaert in the early 1980's. The virus was amplified by oral infection of specific pathogen free (SPF) piglets in 1982. An intestinal loop was inserted into the piglets and the intestinal contents were collected and then stored at -80\u02daC. This strain was not amplified in cultured cells. The viral stock stored at -80\u02daC since 1982 has been inoculated recently by the oral route into SPF piglets at 3 weeks of age (10 8 genome copies/pig). The experiment was carried out in the air-filtered level 3 biosecurity facilities of ANSES in accordance with the European and French regulations on animal welfare. The protocol for this experiment was approved by the Ethics Committee registered under number #16 by the French Ministry of Research (No.03596.03). Two piglets were euthanized at 4 days post-inoculation and showed macroscopic lesions typical of PED and PEDV genome was detected in affected tissues.",

Upper and lower size selection was performed manually using Agencourt1 AMPure1 XP magnetic beads (Beckman Coulter) with a target peak size of 670 bp. These libraries were then quality and quantity checked using a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, B\u00f6blingen, Germany) and Kapa Library Quantification Kit for Illumina (Kapa Biosystems, Cape Town, South Africa) on a Bio-Rad CFX96 Real-Time System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, USA). Sequencing was performed with an Illumina MiSeq instrument with MiSeq reagent Kit v3 for 600 cycles (Illumina, San Diego, USA).",

The virus strain CV777 was obtained from Pensaert & de Bouck in the late 1970's and induced diarrhea in experimental pigs [1] but there is no information about the virulence in pigs of the cell-grown material. The virus was grown in Vero cells (see [5] ) using serum-free medium supplemented with 10 \u03bcg/ml of trypsin [37] . The medium was harvested when 50% of the cells displayed CPE (4 days post infection), centrifuged at 4000 x g for 10 min to remove cell debris and concentrated 30-fold using a 30K Amicon Ultracel centrifugal filter (Amicon, Fisher Scientific, Landsmeer, The Netherlands). From this concentrated fraction, RNA was isolated using Trizol LS (Invitrogen). After DNase I digestion, a cDNA library for MiSeq sequencing was prepared as described [38] . Briefly, 1 st strand and 2 nd strand cDNA was synthesized using a degenerate primer with a sequence tag (GTTTCCCAGTCACGATA-N9) and linearly amplified by PCR using the tag primer GTTTCCCAGTCACGATA (annealing to 5' terminal sequence of the 2 nd strand cDNA). Fragments under 200 bp in length were removed and the integrity and size distribution of the cDNA library was determined with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer using the High Sensitivity DNA Kit (Agilent) and shown to meet the quality criteria for MiSeq sequencing recommended by Illumina. PEDV-specific reads were extracted from MiSeq sequence data files by alignment to the reference CV777 sequence (AF353511.1) using blastn analysis. PEDV-reads were assembled to contigs and sequence differences between the de novo PEDV-sequence and the reference CV777 sequence (AF353511.1) were visualized using the ''Tablet\" program [39].",

This can be predicted to result in the removal of 7 amino acids from the Cterminus of the spike protein and the use of a different termination codon (marked in another box) but no extraneous residues will be added to the S protein. In addition, this deletion removes the initiation codon for ORF3 (indicated in italics), which can be expected to result in complete loss of ORF3 protein expression.
