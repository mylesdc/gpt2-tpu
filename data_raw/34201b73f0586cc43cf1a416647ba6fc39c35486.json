The data we present hereafter are a continuation of the fieldwork and results already presented in Refs. 1,2 , so we refer the reader to those papers for details on data collection. In the higher resolution experimental scenario, we model explicitly the migration within different caves denoted as Summer refuges. In the following Table we provide the estimate for the associated migration flows. (infected cells) ), cellculture-adapted, EBLV-1 challenge virus (8918 FRA) was incubated with 3-fold dilutions of the sera to be titered. After incubation of the serum-virus mixtures, a suspension of BSR cells was added. Twenty-four hours later, the cell monolayer was acetone-fixed and labeled with a fluoresceinated anti-nucleocapsid antibody to detect the presence of non-neutralized virus (fluorescent foci). The optimal challenge dose (the dilution giving 80% infected cells for each virus production) is calculated. Further, titers are expressed as the arithmetic means of two independent repetitions. Samples were considered positive when the number of fluorescent foci was reduced by 50% at the 1\u223627 dilution (starting dilution). This cutoff value is similar to that applied in other studies, see Refs. [2] [3] [4] for additional details.",
