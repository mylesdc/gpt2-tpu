We investigated the functional consequences of partial and full Sgta ablation in vivo using Cre-lox Sgtanull mice. Sgta +/\u2212 breeders generated viable Sgta \u2212/\u2212 offspring, but at less than Mendelian expectancy. Sgta \u2212/\u2212 breeders were subfertile with small litters and higher neonatal death (P < 0.02). Body size was significantly and proportionately smaller in male and female Sgta \u2212/\u2212 (vs WT, Sgta +/\u2212 P < 0.001) from d19. Serum IGF-1 levels were genotype-and sex-dependent. Food intake, muscle and bone mass and adiposity were unchanged in Sgta \u2212/\u2212 . Vital and sex organs had normal relative weight, morphology and histology, although certain androgen-sensitive measures such as penis and preputial size, and testis descent, were greater in Sgta \u2212/\u2212 . Expression of AR and its targets remained largely unchanged, although AR localisation was genotype-and tissue-dependent. Generally expression of other TPRcontaining proteins was unchanged. In conclusion, this thorough investigation of SGTA-null mutation reports a mild phenotype of reduced body size. The model's full potential likely will be realised by genetic crosses with other models to interrogate the role of SGTA in the many diseases in which it has been implicated.",

This motif, when arrayed in tandem, forms a protein-protein interaction module capable of facilitating interactions with a diverse range of client proteins (as reviewed in refs 1-3). Since its discovery 15 years ago 4 , SGTA has been implicated in a myriad of biological processes 1 including cell cycle and apoptosis 5 , viral assembly and release 4,6-9 , hormone signalling 5,10-17 , intracellular compartmentalization 10,11 , neuronal synaptic transmission 18 and the post-translational transport [19] [20] [21] [22] and modification 17,23 of proteins. Due to its broad pattern of tissue expression 1,24,25 (Suppl Fig. 1A ,B) and its engagement in many biological processes, SGTA has been implicated in many diseases including cancer of the prostate 10,26 , ovary 27 , liver 28 and oesophagus 29 ; hormone-related polycystic ovary syndrome 30 ; and amyloid-related Alzheimer's 18 and prion 31 diseases. Given the overarching cellular role of SGTA in co-chaperoning client proteins to ensure their correct folding, trafficking and/or appropriate subcellular movement in the aforementioned biological processes 1 , it is surprising that its essential normal biological functions remain uncharacterised.",

SGTA is ubiquitously expressed in human and murine tissues, with M. musculus SGTA exhibiting 83% and 88% identity to human SGTA at the mRNA and protein levels, respectively, with similar distribution of functional domains (Suppl Fig. 1D-F) . Knockdown of SGTA in vitro can impair cellular proliferation (NBE, HeLa, C4-2B cells), reduce cell viability (C4-2B cells) 26 and promote cell death (NBE, HeLa cells) 5, 34 . No study to date has reported the effect of SGTA ablation in vivo. Given that SGTA is expressed in early development 35 and has a ubiquitous co-chaperoning role, we aimed to determine the physiological importance of SGTA in vivo by assessing the effect of SGTA ablation on normal development and fecundity in mice.",

Likewise, absolute femur weight, whilst significantly reduced in Sgta \u2212/\u2212 vs WT adults (P < 0.03), when corrected for body weight, was unchanged (Fig. 2B ). Therefore changes in lean and skeletal mass are unlikely to account for smaller body mass. We next aimed to determine the timing and cause of body weight divergence as a result of Sgta ablation. Sgta-null neonates appeared macroscopically indistinguishable from WT, displaying no signs of disadvantage (Fig. 2C ). Measuring pup weight from birth to weaning (Fig. 2C ) revealed a genotype* age interaction (P < 0.02). From postnatal d0-7, Sgta \u2212/\u2212 pups exhibited similar body weight to Sgta +/\u2212 and WT littermates.

Feed intake did not account for smaller body mass as feed efficiency, measured from postnatal d21-105 was unchanged by genotype ( Fig. 3A ) and during early neonatal life, milk bands were clearly visible (Fig. 2C inset) .",

SGTA has been implicated as a putative co-chaperone for the AR and is believed to limit translocation of AR to the nucleus until the AR complex is ligand-bound 10 . Androgen and AR signalling pathways are involved in the development of the male-specific phenotype during early development and in spermatogenesis, sexual behaviour and fertility in male adult life, but are also important in female sex organ development, including uterus and breast, and normal reproductive physiology, such as ovarian folliculogenesis and embryonic implantation, in females. Chemical or genetic disruption of androgen/AR signalling perturbs normal male and female reproductive development or function 37, 38 . We therefore assessed AGD (testis descent) and penis and preputial size as surrogates for androgen/AR signalling during early prenatal, prepubertal 37, 38 and pubertal 39,40 development, respectively (Fig. 4A,B) .",

Ar mRNA was unchanged by genotype in the prostate, testis, ovary, mammary and brain. To determine if Sgta ablation altered the localisation and distribution of AR protein, we undertook dual-labelled immunofluorescence staining of prostate and testis sections (Fig. 4D ). In the prostate, SGTA protein resided chiefly in the cytoplasm of WT and Sgta +/\u2212 epithelial cells, with weaker intensity staining in Sgta +/\u2212 than WT, and no staining in Sgta \u2212/\u2212 animals, as expected (Fig. 4D) . Conversely, AR protein was principally nuclear in WT and Sgta +/\u2212 prostate epithelial cells, with weaker intensity staining in Sgta +/\u2212 vs WT. However, in Sgta \u2212/\u2212 prostates, AR immunostaining was equally as intense as in the nuclei of WT prostate, but exhibited greater immunoreactivity in the cytoplasm than WT and Sgta +/\u2212 . In the testis, SGTA was also localised predominantly in the cytoplasm of cells and was detected in the Leydig, Sertoli, spermatid and spermatocyte cells of WT testis (Fig. 4D ). AR immunostaining was detected predominantly within the Leydig cells, with intense nuclear and distinct cytoplasmic immunoreactivity in WT testis. Partial Sgta ablation increased AR immunoreactivity, especially in the cytoplasm of Leydig cells, although distinct nuclear immunostaining was also detected. And finally, full Sgta ablation was associated with a visual reduction of AR immunoreactivity, especially in the cytoplasm, although some nuclear and cytoplasmic staining was still observed (Fig. 4D) . Hence, some tissue-specific effects of SGTA dosage were evident. In order to determine if these changes were associated with changes in AR signalling, the mRNA content of known androgen-regulated target genes was assessed in the testis, prostate, ovary and mammary ( Table 2) . None of the AR-dependent genes measured were altered as a result of full or partial Sgta ablation.",

            "text": "In vitro, SGTA knockdown in kidney (NBE) 34 , cervical cancer (HeLa) 5 and prostate cancer (C4-2B) 26 cells reduces proliferation and viability due to impaired mitosis 5, 34 , in association with defective cytokinesis 34 and failed completion of chromosomal alignment 5 . Because of this, and the fact that Sgta is ubiquitously expressed and a wide range of protein interactions with SGTA are documented 1 , we hypothesised that Sgta would be vital for life and that its ablation in mice would prove lethal. On the contrary, however, we demonstrated here that viable Sgta \u2212/\u2212 animals were produced from breeding Sgta-deficient mice, as is the case in the knockout/down of conserved SGTA orthologs 32, 33 in C. elegans, D. melanogaster and S. cerevisiae 14, 15, 33 . The tendency we observed for reduced numbers of Sgta \u2212/\u2212 offspring in comparison to expected Mendelian inheritance is consistent with that of mutants for similar TPR-containing protein, FKBP52 (Fkbp4) 47, 48 . Given considerable evidence that SGTA is involved in tail-anchored (TA) protein insertion 16, 22, 49 , and as TA biogenesis is essential for early development and genetic ablation disrupting this process has been linked to embryonic lethality 50, 51 , it is possible that aberrant TA protein processing may contribute to the reduced yield of mutant animals. The cause of prenatal mortality remains undetermined, however, in the case of FKBP52 \u2212/\u2212 , genetic background did contribute to the penetrance of FKBP52 action. That is, independent generation of FKBP52 \u2212/\u2212 mice on C57BL/6J 47 and 129SvEv 48 backgrounds yielded lethality at 50% and 30% of embryos from heterozygous matings, respectively. Moreover, backcrossing FKBP52-129SvEv mutants to the C57BL/6 strain amplified lethality to almost 100% 52 ; highlighting the caveat that the underlying genetics of a mutant model influence the phenotype presented. Whether a more pronounced phenotype of Sgta \u2212/\u2212 would have been observed if it been characterised on a different background strain of mice, remains to be determined. In contrast to FKBP52 \u2212/\u2212 , deletion of the similar protein, FKBP51 (Fkbp5), had no effect on early survival and elicited no apparent altered phenotype in mice 53 , although FKBP51 knockout (C57BL/6J background) in combination with FKPB52 deletion (129SvEv background) caused complete lethality in early embryonic life 54 . This highlights that redundancy exists in the co-chaperoning system. Consistent with this notion, FKBP52 \u2212/\u2212 males developed normal testes, but displayed penile hypospadias 53 . Increased FKBP51 mRNA and protein expression in FKBP52 \u2212/\u2212 testis, but not in penis, may actively prevent testis dysgenesis. In the context of homozygous Sgta ablation, it is possible that a structurally similar TPR-containing protein(s) intervenes, fulfilling the role of SGTA in its absence. Increased Dnajc7 (TPR2) mRNA in the ovary may serve this purpose, however the mRNA expression of 7 TPR-containing proteins was unchanged in the prostate, testis and mammary gland. Whether changes in protein expression and/or localisation of TPR-containing protein(s) compensate for loss of SGTA in normal physiology merits further investigation and could explain why only a mild Sgta-null phenotype was observed in the current study. A more overt phenotype may be induced by applying a stressor to Sgta-null mutants, as co-chaperones are essential for optimal folding/refolding and trafficking of stress-affected client proteins 55 . In yeast null for SGTA ortholog, Sgt-2, two distinct cellular stressors reduced yeast viability 15 , growth and colony formation 20 compared to wild-type yeast. This further supports that SGTA is essential under certain cellular conditions and it is likely that its loss is compensated for to prevent dysfunction when these conditions arise.",

            "text": "In Sgta-null mice, reduced body size comprising a proportionate decrease in body weight and length was the most overt phenotypic change observed and was limited to homozygous mutants. Inadequate nutrition could result in stunted Sgta \u2212/\u2212 growth, especially as weight differences coincided with a phase where dependence on nursing is lessened. This appears not to be the case, as feed efficiency was unchanged in Sgta \u2212/\u2212 mice, albeit their ability to absorb and utilise nutrients from food consumed remains unknown. Whether Sgta ablation prompted changes in the signalling of hormonal growth mediators warranted investigation, especially as myostatin 23 and the GHR 12 are SGTA client proteins. Defective development and altered mass of skeletal muscle would be predicted if Sgta deficiency influenced the maturation and signalling of myostatin, a negative regulator of muscle mass 56 ; however neither muscle pathology nor mass were affected. GH, acting via GHR, is essential for somatic growth, cellular differentiation 57 , and paracrine production of IGF-1 36 . Aberrant GHR signalling, and GH resistance, causes cessation of IGF-1 production and growth stunting. Despite both GH and GHR normally being expressed in early embryogenesis, growth changes due to altered GH signalling are only observed from postnatal d14-21 in mice 36, 58 . Dwarfing at 3 weeks in GHR-null mice is associated with heightened GH and lowered levels of IGF-1 in the circulation 36, 58 . Likewise, decreasing functional IGF-1R in mice (IGF-1Rneo) leads to growth stunting from 4-9 weeks of age, corresponding to a plateau in size, which is maintained 59 . Analogous to GHR/ IGF-1R deficiency 58, 59 , Sgta-null mutants emerged as being physically smaller than WT at ~3 weeks and plateaued at ~6 weeks, at which time females were 93%, and males 87%, of the weight of WT animals. Similar to GH/GHR, SGTA is detected prenatally in the embryo, but its functionality during early development is not known. Given its interaction with the ubiquitin-dependent endocytosis motif of precursor and mature GHR, SGTA has been speculated to prevent GHR interaction with ubiquitin machinery whilst being trafficked from the endoplasmic reticulum, where precursor GHR resides, to the cell membrane, where mature GHR functions 57 . Aberrant GHR/ IGF-1R trafficking and potentially ubiquitin-mediated GHR degradation could be triggered by Sgta ablation. We hypothesise that this may contribute to the growth stunting observed in Sgta \u2212/\u2212 mice, providing the loss of SGTA is not compensated by another co-chaperone. Lowered IGF-1 serum and tissue mRNA levels in Sgta \u2212/\u2212 animals may reflect defective GHR signalling, whereas raised serum GH and elevated GHR in the ovary in Sgta \u2212/\u2212 may indicate compensation for deficient GH/IGF-1 signalling; however, the latter requires confirmation at the protein level.",

Dysgenesis in sex organs dependent on androgen/AR-driven development were the leading cause of defective FKBP52 \u2212/\u2212 male reproduction 53 , while failure of progesterone receptor-dependent uterine implantation conferred sterility in FKBP52 \u2212/\u2212 females 48 . Increased surrogate measures (AGD, penis and preputial gland size) for androgen signalling in utero, both prepubertally and at puberty, in full or partial Sgta deficiency are suggestive of altered AR signalling and/or hyperandrogenisation. However, several other androgen-dependent organs were unaffected by Sgta ablation in males and females, as was the mRNA expression of Ar and AR-responsive genes. Regardless, an effect of Sgta ablation on sex steroid production cannot be excluded. In addition to AR regulation, SGTA also exhibits regulatory specificity for progesterone and glucocorticoid receptors 1,60 ; thus the influence of SGTA ablation on biological processes controlled by progesterone and glucocorticoid signaling also warrant future investigation. Reduced nuclear AR immunoreactivity without a concomitant increase in the cytoplasm in the Sgta +/\u2212 prostate, is suggestive of Sgta, like other TPR-containing proteins TPR2/Dnajc7 and CHIP/Stub1, playing a role in AR stabilisation and/or degradation 61 .

The loxP site flanking exon 4 was inserted upstream and the loxP site flanking exon 5 was inserted downstream of a neomycin selection cassette (Phosphoglycerate Kinase (PGK)-neo). The selection cassette was flanked with Flippase Recognition Target (FRT) sites to enable removal by FLPe-mediated recombination. The targeting vector was inserted into a plasmid backbone PelleR (Ozgene) containing the PGK-neo cassette (Suppl Fig. 1C ), linearised and electroporated into C57BL/6-derived embryonic stem cells (Ozgene). Correctly targeted stem cell clones were microinjected into recipient murine blastocysts, which were transferred into pseudo-pregnant foster mothers. Offspring were crossed with C57BL/6 mice to generate embryonic stem cell-derived targeted mutant progeny (heterozygous Sgta wt/flox), as confirmed by genotyping. These mice were crossed with OzCre mice, which express Cre knocked into the ubiquitously expressed Gt(ROSA)26Sor locus. Global tissue expression of Cre initiated loxP-mediated deletion of exons 4 and 5 of Sgta in early embryonic development and generation of Sgta +/\u2212 + Cre mice. To minimise the impact of Cre-related toxicity 62 , Cre was eradicated by back-crossing Sgta +/\u2212 Cre mice to C57BL/6 and it was only Cre-negative (\u0394 Cre) mice that were used subsequently and described herein.",
