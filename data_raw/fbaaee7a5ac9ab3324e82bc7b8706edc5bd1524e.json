            "text": "Replication-competent controlled virus vectors were derived from the virulent herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) wild-type strain 17syn\u03e9 by placing one or two replication-essential genes under the stringent control of a gene switch that is coactivated by heat and an antiprogestin. Upon activation of the gene switch, the vectors replicate in infected cells with an efficacy that approaches that of the wildtype virus from which they were derived. Essentially no replication occurs in the absence of activation. When administered to mice, localized application of a transient heat treatment in the presence of systemic antiprogestin results in efficient but limited virus replication at the site of administration. The immunogenicity of these viral vectors was tested in a mouse footpad lethal challenge model. Unactivated viral vectors-which may be regarded as equivalents of inactivated vaccines-induced detectable protection against lethality caused by wild-type virus challenge. Single activation of the viral vectors at the site of administration (rear footpads) greatly enhanced protective immune responses, and a second immunization resulted in complete protection. Once activated, vectors also induced far better neutralizing antibody and HSV-1-specific cellular immune responses than unactivated vectors. To find out whether the immunogenicity of a heterologous antigen was also enhanced in the context of efficient transient vector replication, a virus vector constitutively expressing an equine influenza virus hemagglutinin was constructed. Immunization of mice with this recombinant induced detectable antibody-mediated neutralization of equine influenza virus, as well as a hemagglutinin-specific cellular immune response. Single activation of viral replication resulted in a severalfold enhancement of these immune responses.",

            "text": "IMPORTANCE We hypothesized that vigorous replication of a pathogen may be critical for eliciting the most potent and balanced immune response against it. Hence, attenuation/inactivation (as in conventional vaccines) should be avoided. Instead, the necessary safety should be provided by placing replication of the pathogen under stringent control and by activating time-limited replication of the pathogen strictly in an administration region in which pathology cannot develop. Immunization will then occur in the context of highly efficient pathogen replication and uncompromised safety. We found that localized activation in mice of efficient but limited replication of a replication-competent controlled herpesvirus vector resulted in a greatly enhanced immune response to the virus or an expressed heterologous antigen. This finding supports the above-mentioned hypothesis and suggests that the vectors may be promising novel agents worth exploring for the prevention/mitigation of infectious diseases for which efficient vaccination is lacking, in particular in immunocompromised patients.",

Our hypothesis is in part based on the rational expectation that an efficiently replicating virus will produce a stronger inflammatory response than an attenuated virus and that the inflammatory response will result in potent activation of the innate immune system and, consequently, in strong and lasting B and T cell responses (27) . To realize such an immunization strategy, a regulation system must be employed that reliably and stringently controls viral replication and is capable of being turned on and off at will. However, virus disseminates after administration. Simply restricting the number of replication cycles will not be enough: depending on the number of cycles allowed, there will be a more or less pronounced manifestation of the toxicity typical for the viral vector used. Hence, the regulation system must be capable of exerting regional control over viral replication so that the immunizing virus replicates only in a locale in which it is certain not to cause a disease phenotype.",

            "text": "To facilitate construction of a replication-competent controlled virus vector, advantage may be taken of gene switches developed previously for eukaryotic cells (28) . This choice implies that the backbone virus must be selected from the group of viruses having a double-stranded DNA genome (e.g., herpesviruses) or producing a doublestranded DNA intermediate during replication and utilizing the host machinery for transcription. It appears that the above-described requirements are best met by promoters of certain heat shock protein (HSP) genes that are stringently controlled by the reversibly heat-activated endogenous transcription factor HSF1 (28) (29) (30) . A virus in which one or, preferably, two replication-essential genes are placed under the control of such a promoter could be activated to undergo one round of localized replication by administration of a mild heat dose to the inoculation region. Further rounds may be induced by repeated heat treatments. However, virus replication may be inefficient, because heat activation of HSP promoters is rapidly reversible, and may be unsafe, because unintended weak activation could be triggered by high fever, intoxication, etc., in an inoculated subject. We previously described a two-component HSP promoterbased gene switch that lacks these unwanted properties (31) (Fig. 1A ). The first component comprises a gene for a small-molecule regulator (SMR)-activated transactivator (TA). The TA gene is controlled by a promoter cassette containing an HSP70B (HSPA7) promoter and a TA-responsive promoter (TRP). The second component is a TRP that drives a selected viral gene (VG). Heat treatment prompts expression of the TA, which is inactive unless activated by its SMR. Activated TA mediates expression of the viral gene and autoactivates its own expression. The gene switch is inactivated by withdrawal of the SMR or, in the present application, virus-mediated lysis of the host cell. The present report presents the first study of immune responses induced by replication-competent controlled HSV-1 vectors in which one or two replicationessential genes are subjected to regulation by such a heat-and SMR-dependent gene switch.",

When activated, the recombinant replicated nearly as efficiently as the wild-type virus, 17syn\u03e9. When administered to the footpads of mice, HSV-GS3 replicated only subsequent to an activating treatment with locally administered heat in the presence of systemic antiprogestin. The results of a single-step growth experiment with HSV-GS7 are shown in Fig. 1C . The recombinant replicated approximately as well as HSV-GS3 following heat treatment in the presence of the antiprogestin ulipristal (35) . No replication was observed after either heat or antiprogestin treatment or in the absence of any treatment. To verify that HSV-GS7 replication was also tightly controlled in vivo, two of three groups of mice were administered HSV-GS7 virus (50,000 PFU per mouse) in the footpads, and the mice of one of the groups were given ulipristal intraperitoneally (i,p.) and, 3 h later, were subjected to a heat treatment to the footpads at 45\u00b0C for 10 min. One day later, all the mice were euthanized, and DNA and RNA were extracted from their feet and analyzed by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and RT-qPCR, respectively. Substantially larger amounts of HSV-1 DNA were detected in the feet of heat/ulipristal-treated mice than in untreated mice (Fig. 1D ). Expression of several viral genes was observed for activated virus, but not for unactivated virus, strongly suggesting that viral replication and gene expression occurred only subsequent to heat/ ulipristal activation.",

In the first experiment, the virus vector HSV-GS3 or KD6 (an ICP4 \u03ea replication-incompetent HSV-1 recombinant [37] ) was administered under anesthesia to the plantar surfaces of both rear feet of adult Swiss Webster outbred female mice (50,000 PFU per animal; 20 animals per group). Concurrently, and again 24 h later, the animals of one of the HSV-GS3 groups received an intraperitoneal injection of 0.5 mg/kg of body weight mifepristone. Three hours after inoculation, the mice in this group were subjected to heat treatment (43.5\u00b0C for 30 min) by immersion of their hind feet in a temperaturecontrolled water bath. Twenty-two days later, all the animals were challenged with a 20-fold lethal dose of the HSV-1 wild-type strain 17syn\u03e9 administered by the same route as the original virus inoculum. Survival of the animals was followed until no more lethal endpoints were reached, i.e., until all surviving animals had fully recovered (Fig.  2 ). KD6 induced a modest level of immunity. As had been expected, because it did not replicate and also did not express the major transcriptional regulator ICP4, unactivated HSV-GS3 provided a comparable degree of protection. Activated HSV-GS3 produced a far greater protective effect. Therefore, one round of efficient replication and/or expression of the master regulator ICP4, resulting in expression of all the viral proteins, produced a dramatic enhancement of protective immunity. It was noted that the heat and antiprogestin treatment had no systematic effect on the level of protection induced by the replication-defective virus KD6 (see \"Statistical evaluation of data from all comparable experiments\" below).",

Four days after challenge, the animals were euthanized, their feet were dissected and homogenized, and virus present in the homogenates was titrated on rabbit skin (RS) cells. The results revealed that activated HSV-GS3 reduced challenge virus replication by nearly 2 orders of magnitude (6. We next examined in a similar experiment whether induction of enhanced protective immunity was caused by activation of the heat-and antiprogestin-dependent gene switch that controls the expression of ICP4 and ICP8 in the HSV-GS3 recombinant. In this and all subsequent experiments, ulipristal was utilized instead of mifepristone because the former compound is a more active gene switch coactivator than the latter compound (35) . Furthermore, the heat treatment regimen was changed to heat exposure at 45\u00b0C for 10 min to achieve greater reproducibility between experiments. The results revealed that enhanced protection was achieved only following activation of HSV-GS3 by heat treatment in the presence of ulipristal (Fig. 3 ). Heat treatment alone or ulipristal alone did not significantly increase the protective effect over that produced by the unactivated virus. These findings strongly suggested that it was the activation of the dual-responsive gene switch in HSV-GS3 that prompted the expression of the regulated replication-essential genes, as well as efficient virus replication that in turn resulted in the observed enhanced protective response. Note that in this experiment the virus inoculum was 500,000 PFU rather than 50,000 PFU, as in most other experiments (Table 1 and Fig. 2 , 4, and 5A; see Fig. 7 and 8). This may account for the somewhat elevated level of protection induced by unactivated HSV-GS3 and KD6.",

            "text": "HSV-GS3 and HSV-GS7 induce comparable protective responses. The greatly enhanced protective response that resulted from transient activation of the gene switch in HSV-GS3-immunized animals could have been due to the efficient virus replication triggered by the activation and/or to the activation of the genes for the major transcription regulator ICP4, which in turn stimulated expression of all the other viral genes in primarily infected cells. Another question was related to whether abundant viral gene expression in secondarily infected cells (which may include antigenpresenting cells) could further enhance the immune response. Since the ICP4 genes are regulated in HSV-GS3, little expression of viral genes was expected to occur in the absence of another activating treatment. Recombinant HSV-GS7 in which the late VP19c gene had been subjected to regulation was constructed to examine these issues. HSV-GS3 and HSV-GS7 were compared in the mouse footpad challenge model. The results revealed that activated HSV-GS3 and HSV-GS7 provided similar levels of pro- Table 1 and Fig. 6 for information from comparable experiments. tection (Fig. 4) . In the absence of activation, the protective effect of either recombinant was modest. Taking data from other experiments into account, the average protective effect for unactivated HSV-GS3 was 22% and that for unactivated HSV-GS7 was 13% (see \"Statistical evaluation of data from all comparable experiments\" below). The fact that the two recombinants that lacked expression of different proteins in the absence of activation induced comparable (modest) protective responses strongly suggested that it was not the absence of one or the other viral protein that limited the immune response to the recombinants. It was instead the vigorous replication of the activated recombinants that enhanced the protective responses against them. In secondarily infected cells (in which HSF1 was not activated), HSV-GS7 was expected to express all viral proteins except the regulated capsid protein at approximately normal levels. In contrast, HSV-GS3 all but lacked ICP4 expression in the absence of activation and exhibited dramatically curtailed expression of other viral proteins (35) . The finding that HSV-GS3 and HSV-GS7 induced comparable protective responses suggested that viral proteins expressed in secondarily infected cells did not contribute in a relevant fashion to the immune response. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the immune system was sufficiently sensitive to detect the very low levels of viral antigen expression occurring in cells secondarily infected with HSV-GS3.",

We next investigated whether a second activation treatment applied 2 days after the first treatment (i.e., at a time at which the initial round of replication of HSV-GS7 should have been completed) or a second immunization would further enhance protection against wild-type virus challenge. The second immunization was administered 3 weeks after the initial virus application. Booster virus was either activated or left unactivated. As shown in Fig. 5A , groups of mice were immunized with 50,000 PFU/animal of recombinant HSV-GS7. Activation of the virus induced an immune response that protected 75% of the animals after challenge with wild-type virus. After the second immunization with a similar dose of HSV-GS7, all the animals were protected. However, this occurred only if the booster virus was also subjected to an activating treatment. A second activation after a single dose of HSV-GS7 had no apparent effect. As effects of reimmunization may be more apparent in mice immunized with smaller quantities of virus, the experiment also featured parallel groups of animals that were immunized and boosted with 5,000 PFU/animal of recombinant HSV-GS7. As Fig. 5B documents, a second immunization followed by virus activation had an even more pronounced effect at the 10-fold-reduced virus doses.

To evaluate immune responses to a heterologous antigen expressed from an HSV-GS vector, recombinant HSV-GS11 was constructed. The recombinant was derived from HSV-GS3 by the insertion in the UL37-UL38 intergenic region of an expression cassette comprising a gene for an equine influenza virus (EIV) hemagglutinin (HA) (EIV Prague/56 HA) functionally linked to a cytomegalovirus (CMV) (immediate-early) promoter (Fig. 8A) .

Twice-immunized animals were completely protected against lethal challenge. The levels of partial protection engendered by unactivated HSV-GS3, unactivated HSV-GS7, and KD6 (lacking expression of different viral proteins) were comparable, which strongly suggests that the much-enhanced protection provided by the activated HSV-GS recombinants was a consequence of their ability to efficiently replicate. Both better neutralizing antibody and better cellular immune responses were induced by the activated HSV-GS vectors, indicating that the replicating vectors not only boosted cellular immunity, but broadly enhanced immune responses. Generalizing these findings, it appears that replication-competent controlled vectors are promising new agents that may better protect against diseases caused by the viruses from which they were derived than replication-incompetent/inactivated vaccines and possibly also live attenuated vaccines. Perhaps even more important, our observations suggest that replication-competent controlled vectors can be excellent immunization platforms that may be exploited for the elaboration of new \"vaccines.\" Expression of an influenza virus antigen induced far more potent neutralizing antibody and antigen-specific responder cell responses when the antigen was expressed in the context of vector replication than in the absence of vector replication. To the extent that such a comparison is valid, neutralizing antibody responses, as well as antigen-specific responder cell responses, against the influenza virus antigen elicited by activated HSV-GS11 were both stronger than the corresponding responses against vector antigens.",

Therefore, the work presented here should be regarded as a first illustration of the principle. In general, any of a number of DNA viruses, including members of all the herpesvirus subfamilies, may be employed for the construction of replication-competent controlled vectors. We selected a fully virulent HSV-1 strain as the backbone of the GS vectors for several reasons, including the fact that HSV has a double-stranded DNA genome that does not integrate into the host genome and that it is tolerant of sizeable insertions, supports stable expression of heterologous genes, replicates and lyses cells efficiently, and responds to antiviral drugs (38) (39) (40) (41) . Although HSV is endemic in the human population, available data indicate that preexisting immunity is not an obstacle to vaccination/immunization uses of HSV vectors (discussed in reference 35). Furthermore, latent infection was considered and UL38. The HSP70/GAL4-GLP65 TA cassette was inserted into the intergenic region between UL43 and UL44. The promoters of the essential HSV-1 ICP4 and ICP8 genes were replaced with GAL4-responsive promoters. (B) Detection of EIV HA RNA expression following immunization of mice with HSV-GS11.

Vector replication was activated in some treatment groups by administration of heat and ulipristal as described in the legend to Fig. 3 .

            "text": "Regarding the two-component HSP promoter-based gene switch that is used for controlling viral replication, several ligand-dependent transactivators are known that may be considered for incorporation in such a gene switch. They include transactivators that are derived from the bacterial tetracycline repressor or other bacterial repressors, as well as chimeric transactivators that exploit ligand-binding domains of various steroid receptors, e.g., human progesterone, human estrogen, or insect ecdysone receptors, or are activated by dimerization (28) . We previously constructed and analyzed two-component HSP promoter-based gene switches that are coactivated by antiprogestins, ecdysteroid ponasterone A, and rapamycin/rapalog (31, 42) . For regulating the HSV-GS vectors, we made use of a heat-and antiprogestin-activated gene switch that is strictly dependent on both heat and antiprogestin. While it has been more thoroughly characterized than any other (31) , this gene switch also recommends itself for several other reasons. It comprises the transactivator GLP65, which is activated by a narrow spectrum of antiprogestins but not progestins (35) . Since it includes only a truncated ligand-binding domain of a progesterone receptor, GLP65 should not be susceptible to ligand-independent activation; in fact, after many years of experimental use, no antiprogestin-independent activation has been reported. At the low doses at which they activate GLP65, antiprogestins, such as mifepristone and ulipristal, are not expected to have any negative effects on the immune system (26) . These antiprogestins have also been safety tested in human subjects and are readily available. They are not considered essential active ingredients by the WHO, and their primary use has been in emergency contraception. To maintain maximal safety in a human immunization scenario, i.e., to preclude any possibility of reactivation from latency, antiprogestins should not be administered subsequent to immunization with an HSV-GS-type vector. Therefore, the vectors may not be employed for immunization of healthy female subjects of reproductive age or younger, or the subjects may forego later use of antiprogestins for emergency contraception. In contrast, the HSV-GS vectors may be well suited to be immunization agents or platforms in middle-aged or elderly subjects. Note that it may be feasible to disable replication of fully activated HSV-GS vectors in latently infected cells through further engineering.",

Owing to their condition, their immune response to inactivated or subunit vaccines may be inadequate. Unfortunately, the use of live attenuated vaccines that might produce a more balanced and more persistent immune response is problematic because of the perceived danger that such vaccines may be insufficiently controlled by the weakened immune system and may cause the disease they are intended to prevent.

We note that viral vectors that were intended to be limited to one cycle of replication were advanced before as potential vaccines (46) . These so-called disabled infectious singlecycle (DISC) viruses typically had the gene for glycoprotein H, which is critical for infection, deleted. Comparing DISC viruses and replication-competent controlled viruses, the latter replicate nearly as efficiently as the wild-type virus that was used for their construction while no comparable information is available for the DISC viruses that were advanced as vaccine candidates. Replication of DISC viruses is not localized but occurs throughout the host. Depending on the dose of virus administered, a single round of replication of disseminated virus can be expected to result in significant toxicity. Not surprisingly, intracranial administration of the DISC virus TA-HSV resulted in neurotoxicity that was only about 2 orders of magnitude lower than that of the wild-type virus from which the strain was derived (47) . Replication-competent controlled viruses should be devoid of such toxicity because they are virtually incapable of replicating unless deliberately activated. We note that the stringency of the replication block could be increased further by subjecting additional replication-essential genes to gene switch control. Furthermore, even though progeny virus produced by a DISC virus upon immunization is not supposed to be capable of reinfecting cells, latent infection has been observed (47) . Latent infection is known to involve spread from cell to cell (48) . Hence, as has been pointed out before (49) , DISC viruses, such as TA-HSV, appear to be leaky for replication in vivo. The above-mentioned properties of DISC viruses are not desirable in an immunization agent or vector administered to healthy people and would disqualify such viruses from use in persons with impaired immune systems. A clinical trial was conducted that investigated a DISC virus as a therapeutic vaccine against recurrent genital herpes (50). The results were negative. The DISC virus (TA-HSV) studied had been derived from a minimally virulent HSV-2 wild-type strain (47, 51) . Moreover, the virus was administered at a relatively low dose, apparently to avoid toxicity. The failure of the trial should not be surprising.",

            "text": "Construction of viruses. All the viruses were constructed using wild-type HSV-1 strain 17syn\u03e9 as the backbone. Viral recombinants were generated by homologous recombination of engineered plasmids, along with purified virion DNA, in RS cells transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation method, as previously described (41) . Plasmids used to engineer the insertions of the transactivator cassette or the GAL4-responsive promoters comprised HSV-1 sequences cloned from strain 17syn\u03e9. HSV-GS3 (Fig. 1B ) was constructed as previously described (3, 35) . HSV-GS7 was derived from the intermediate vector HSV-17GS43 (35) , which contains an insertion between the UL43 and UL44 genes of a transactivator cassette containing a GLP65 gene under the control of a promoter cassette that combined a human HSP70B promoter and a GAL4-responsive promoter (31) . To place the UL38/VP19c gene under the regulation of a GAL4-responsive promoter, plasmid pBS-KS:GAL4-UL38 was constructed. The plasmid contains a GAL4 promoter inserted between the HSV-1 UL38 recombination arms of the plasmid pBS-KS:UL38\u0394promoter. A GAL4-responsive promoter comprising six copies of the yeast GAL4 upstream activating sequence (UAS), the adenovirus E1b TATA sequence, and the synthetic intron Ivs8 was excised from the plasmid pGene/V5-His A (Invitrogen, Life Technologies) with AatII and HindIII, and the resulting 473-bp fragment was gel purified. For the vector, pBS-KS:UL38\u0394promoter was digested with AatII and HindIII, and the resulting 4,285-bp fragment was gel purified and treated with shrimp alkaline phosphatase. Ligation of the last two fragments placed the GAL4 promoter in front of the UL38 transcriptional start site. To produce recombinant HSV-GS7, RS cells were cotransfected with the plasmid pBS-KS:GAL4-UL38 and purified HSV-17GS43 virion DNA. Subsequent to the addition of mifepristone to the medium, the cotransfected cells were exposed to 43.5\u00b0C for 30 min and then incubated at 37\u00b0C. Subsequently, on days 2 and 3, the cells were again incubated at 43.5\u00b0C for 30 min and then returned to 37\u00b0C. Picking and amplification of plaques, screening, and plaque purification were performed essentially as described for HSV-GS3 (3, 35) . The resulting plaque-purified HSV-GS7 was verified by Southern blotting, as well as by PCR and DNA sequence analysis of the recombination junctions. Plasmid pBS-KS:UL38\u0394promoter was constructed by deletion of the region from \u03ea1 to \u03ea47 of the UL38 promoter, i.e., by synthesizing two PCR fragments (one 437 bp and the other 550 bp) on either side of the deletion and cloning them into pBS KS\u03e9. HSV-GS11 was derived from the vector HSV-GS3 (35) and contains an insertion between the UL37 and UL38 genes of a gene cassette expressing the EIV Prague/56 HA gene driven by the CMV IE promoter. A recombination plasmid was constructed by the following sequential steps. First, an 814-bp fragment containing the region spanning the HSV-1 UL37/UL38 intergenic region from nucleotides (nt) 83603 to 84417 from plasmid NK470 was subcloned into pBS that had had the multiple-cloning site (MCS) removed (by digestion with KpnI/SacI) to yield pBS:UL37/38. A cassette containing a synthetic CMV IE promoter flanked by the pBS-SK\u03e9 MCS was ligated into pBS:UL37/38 digested with BspE1/AflII, which cut between the UL37 and UL38 genes, to yield the plasmid pIN:UL37/38. The EIV Prague/56 HA gene was PCR cloned from cDNA prepared from EIV Prague/56. Briefly, RNA was prepared by TRIzol extraction of a stock of EIV Prague 56 and was reverse transcribed using Omni-Script reverse transcriptase (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cDNAs were cloned into pBS, and the clone containing the HA gene (pBS-EIVPrague56/HA) was confirmed by sequence analysis. The Prague/56 HA gene was subcloned from this plasmid and inserted behind the CMV promoter in the plasmid pIN:UL37/38 to yield plasmid pIN:37/38-Prague56/HA. To produce recombinant HSV-GS11, RS cells were cotransfected with plasmid pIN:37/38-Prague56/HA and purified HSV-GS3 virion DNA. Subsequent to the addition of mifepristone to the medium, the cotransfected cells were exposed to 43.5\u00b0C for 30 min and then incubated at 37\u00b0C. Subsequently, on days 2 and 3, the cells were again incubated at 43.5\u00b0C for 30 min and then returned to 37\u00b0C. Picking and amplification of plaques, screening, and plaque purification were performed essentially as described for HSV-GS3 (3, 35) . The resulting plaque-purified HSV-GS11 was verified by Southern blotting, as well as by PCR and DNA sequence analysis of the recombination junctions.",

Virus was allowed to adsorb for 1 h at 37\u00b0C; then, the inoculum was removed, and the cells were overlaid with complete medium. Ulipristal treatment (10 nM) was initiated at the time of the initial infection. Heat treatment was performed either immediately after infection or 4 h later by floating the sealed dishes in a 43.5\u00b0C water bath for 30 min. The dishes were then incubated for 72 h at 37\u00b0C. At 0, 4 or 8, 12 or 16, and 24 or 28 h postinfection, two dishes were removed, and the cells were scraped into medium for harvesting and subjected to two freeze-thaw cycles. Infectious virus was then determined by titrating the lysate of each dish in triplicate on 24-well plates of confluent E5 cells transfected 24 h prior to infection with the expression vector pVP19c using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies). Plaques were visualized 2 days after infection using an antibody plaque assay, essentially as previously described (35) . and the EIVPrague56/HA protein was expressed in Escherichia coli in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. After induction and growth, the bacteria were lysed, proteins were isolated in the presence of protease inhibitors, and the proteins were used to coat a 96-well ELISA plate, which was allowed to air dry. Dilutions (1:10 to 1:200) of murine serum were applied to the wells, and the plate was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The serum was removed, and the wells were washed 2 times with PBS. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-IgG antibody was added to the wells, the plate was incubated for 30 min at room temperature, and the wells were washed 2 times with PBS. 3,3=,5,5=-Tetramethylbenzidine was added to the wells, and the plate was incubated for 10 min and then read with a spectrophotometer plate reader.
