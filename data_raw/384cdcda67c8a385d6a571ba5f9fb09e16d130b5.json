Vero cell, an African green monkey kidney cell line, was often used to isolate and propagate PEDV. Nonetheless, the target cells of PEDV in vivo are intestinal epithelial cells, during infection, intestinal epithelia would be damaged and resulted in digestive disorders. The immune functions of porcine epithelial cells and interactions with other immune cell populations display a number of differences compared to other species. Type I interferon (IFN) plays an important role in antiviral immune response. Limited reports showed that PEDV could inhibit type I interferon production. In this study, porcine small intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), the target cells of PEDV, were used as the infection model in vitro to identify the possible molecular mechanisms of PEDV-inhibition IFN-\u03b2 production.",

As the key IFN-\u03b2 transcription factors, we found that dsRNA-induced activation of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) was inhibited after PEDV infection, but not nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-\u03baB). To identify the mechanism of PEDV intervention with dsRNA-mediated IFN-\u03b2 expression more accurately, the role of individual molecules of RIG-I signaling pathway were investigated. In the upstream of IRF-3, TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1)-or inhibitor of \u03baB kinase-\u03b5 (IKK\u03b5)-mediated IFN-\u03b2 production was not blocked by PEDV, while RIG-I-and its adapter molecule IFN-\u03b2 promoter stimulator 1 (IPS-1)-mediated IFN-\u03b2 production were completely inhibited after PEDV infection. Conclusion: Taken together, our data demonstrated for the first time that PEDV infection of its target cell line, IECs, inhibited dsRNA-mediated IFN-\u03b2 production by blocking the activation of IPS-1 in RIG-I-mediated pathway. Our studies offered new visions in understanding of the interaction between PEDV and host innate immune system.",

Outbreaks of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) have received extensive attention for the considerable economic losses to the swine industry worldwide. Great advances have been made in elucidation of the molecular epidemiology, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of PED [2] . Recently, coronavirus interaction with host innate immune system has been a hot research field. Previous studies indicated that transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) infection enhanced type I interferon expression and its protein 7 modulated type I IFN expression [3, 4] . For mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), IFN production among different cell populations varied due to their diverse susceptibility to this virus [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Furthermore, both severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) do not induce type I IFN (IFN-\u03b1/ \u03b2) activation [10] [11] [12] . So far, limited reports showed that PEDV could inhibit type I interferon production [13, 14] .",

IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 is an essential element of the host innate immune response against viral infections. Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), the replicative intermediate of most viruses, is a potent inducer of IFN-\u03b2, which is recognized as a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) by host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Two of major PRRs, retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) detect dsRNA in the cytoplasm [15] . Following dsRNA binding, RIG-I and MDA5 recruit corresponding adapter protein IFN-\u03b2 promoter stimulator 1 (IPS-1) that, in turn, activate downstream signaling of TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and inhibitor of \u03baB kinase-\u03b5 (IKK\u03b5) transduction, leading to the activation of transcription factor IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-\u03baB).

As shown in Fig. 1a , IFN-\u03b2 luciferase activity enhanced markedly in positive controls, while it was almost not detected in PEDV-infected IECs. In addition, IFN-\u03b2 mRNA expression was hardly detected in PEDV-infected IECs similar to mock-infected group, however, it had significant expression in poly (I:C)-transfected group at the indicated times (12 h and 24 h, p < 0.01) (Fig. 1b) .

In unstimulated cells, IRF-3 is ubiquitously present in the cytoplasm as an inactive monomer, whereas NF-\u03baB is present as a homodimer or heterodimer bound to the inhibitory proteins I\u03baB in the cytoplasm [28] . Phosphorylation, which is a key step during IRF-3 and NF-\u03baB activation, in turn, leads to nuclear translocation. Therefore, we evaluated whether PEDV infection induced IRF-3 and p65 activation by western blot analysis. Following PEDV infection, the whole cell extracts were prepared for the indicative times, in Fig. 2a , IRF-3 still existed in the cytoplasm, and the levels of IRF-3 protein was almost equal with mock-infected cells, while the phosphorylation of IRF-3 (p-IRF-3) did not detect in the PEDV infected cells in comparision to a obviously signal in poly (I:C)-transfected cells. On the contrary, compared with the amount of NF-\u03baB subunit p65 in the cytoplasm, the phosphorylation of p65 (p-p65) increased with progression of PEDV infection in the nucleus. Meanwhile, the concentration of poly (I:C)induced p65 nuclear translocation was clearly increased. PEDV N protein was also detected in PEDV-infected cells. These data suggested that PEDV did not induce activation of IRF-3, but NF-\u03baB.",

Cells were then mock-infected or infected with PEDV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. At 24 h postinfection, cells were transfected with 1 \u03bcg of poly (I:C) or left untransfected. After 12 h, cells were removed from the culture medium and washed three times in cold phosphatebuffered saline (PBS). Next, cells were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, quenched with 0.1 M glycine for 5 min, and then permeabilized with 0.1 % Triton X-100 for 10 min. Afterward, the cells were incubated with anti-PEDV antibody (dilution, 1:500) for 1 h followed by TRITClabeled goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (dilution, 1:200) for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. The nuclei were stained with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-dihydrochloride (DAPI) (Invitrogen Corp.). Cells were examined using a TCS SP2 AOBS confocal microscope (Leica Camera AG, Wetzlar, Germany).",
