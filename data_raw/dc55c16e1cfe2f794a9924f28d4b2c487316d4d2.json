Study population mean ages ranged from 70.8 to 90.1 years. Three (12%) studies reported influenza estimates, 7 (27%) RSV, and 16 (62%) pneumonia. Eighteen (69%) studies reported incidence estimates, 7 (27%) prevalence estimates, and 1 (4%) both. Seven (27%) studies reported outbreaks. Respiratory infection incidence estimates ranged from 1.1 to 85.2% and prevalence estimates ranging from 1.4 to 55.8%. Influenza incidences ranged from 5.9 to 85.2%. RSV incidence proportions ranged from 1.1 to 13.5%. Pneumonia prevalence proportions ranged from 1.4 to 55.8% while incidence proportions ranged from 4.8 to 41.2%. Conclusions: The reported incidence and prevalence estimates of respiratory infections among older LTCF residents varied widely between published studies. The wide range of estimates offers little useful guidance for decision-making to decrease respiratory infection burden. Large, well-designed epidemiologic studies are therefore still necessary to credibly quantify the burden of respiratory infections among older adults in LTCFs, which will ultimately help inform future surveillance and intervention efforts.",

Around 5% or more of persons \u226565 years are in LTCFs in developed countries, and LTCF use is rapidly growing in developing countries [8, 9] . These LTCFs house individuals in close quarters, an important consideration for contagious respiratory infections [10, 11] . The close proximity of residents in combination with advanced age, multimorbidity and frailty in LTCFs likely predisposes older adults to an even greater susceptibility to infections and their complications [12] . Furthermore, the clustering of frail older LTCF residents in close living quarters allows infections to spread more quickly. For diseases with morbidity and mortality that can be averted through vaccines, like bacterial pneumonia and influenza, low vaccination rates can contribute to the development of outbreaks [13] . Consequently, the LTCF setting and its residents are important targets for research and interventions [11] .",

These criteria reasonably ensured the study sample would be representative of a population aged \u226560 since > 95% of individuals could be expected to have an age \u2265 60 based on a normal distribution [15] . We also required that the study be conducted in a population residing in a LTCF setting that was not hospitalbased because such hospital-based facilities typically operate more like an acute-care setting. To isolate the natural burden of infections in the absence of interventions and better understand the maximum potential impact that interventions might have when implemented alone or in combination, studies were only included if they provided data on an unvaccinated population which had not received either influenza or pneumococcal vaccine. Non-use of both influenza and pneumococcal vaccine was required due to the complex relationships between influenza and pneumonia (e.g., bacterial pneumonias in LTCFs may often result from viral infection that damages the lung epithelium to make it a rich culture medium for various bacteria), and the possibility that influenza vaccination may reduce the incidence of pneumococcal pneumonia. Similarly, we only included studies with populations not taking prophylactic antiviral medications for influenza (i.e., oseltamivir, zanamivir, peramivir, amantadine, and rimantadine). Studies examining RSV had no such requirements because there was no licensed vaccine for the virus at the time of this review. If a study did not describe vaccination or antiviral medication use and met all other criteria, we assumed the study population was unvaccinated or unexposed to antiviral medications and included the article. We did not evaluate studies for inclusion based on the method by which a respiratory infection was characterized because the various methods were all considered valid. As an example, viral testing is uncommonly done to diagnose influenza as clinicians often make a clinical diagnosis based on symptoms, judgement, and local influenza activity [16] . Likewise, bacterial pneumonia is also typically a clinical diagnosis and, in the LTCF setting, empirically treated. It is noteworthy that the various causes of pneumonia are essentially clinically indistinguishable from one another and the likelihood of a correct diagnosis outside of systematic testing is increased when there is a laboratoryconfirmed case in the context of a cluster of individuals becoming ill around the same time (i.e., an outbreak).",

The mean age of the study populations ranged from 70.8 to 90.1 years among all but 6 studies that reported a mean age. Male sex ranged from 16.5 to 54% of study participants, with no data for 8 studies. The time of data collection ranged from February 1979 to \"winter 2014\", with no information on time of data collection for one study. The range of study sample sizes was 52 to 102, 842 subjects and follow-up period lengths ranged from 30 days to 4 years. Two studies were industry-funded, 17 were not industry-funded, and the remaining 7 did not report the source of funding. Of the included studies, 18 reported an incidence estimate while only 7 reported a prevalence estimate; one study reported both. No literature was identified on the outcomes or costs of developing a respiratory infection in LTCFs.",

Despite the variability in the estimates, these data suggest that the incidence and prevalence of respiratory infections are high among older LTCF residents. The available data underscore the lack of nationally representative, modern, and large studies of the burden of respiratory infections in this important population. While studies are necessary for all respiratory infection types, studies are particularly necessary to better understand the epidemiology of influenza among LTCF residents. Without such well-designed studies to inform interventions, clinical practice, and policy, an evidence-based approach to the reduction of the burden of respiratory infections in LTCFs will be unnecessarily challenging.",

Studies of risk factors for incident respiratory infections in LTCFs were surprisingly scarce. Identifying predictors and developing tools to evaluate the respiratory infection risk of patients should be a focus of additional research. Existing datasets like linked Medicare claims and Minimum Data Set assessments could be used to identify predictors in routinely collected data. The increasing availability of electronic medical records in LTCFs could then support individual patient models for specific infections. For instance, once predictors have been empirically identified, electronic medical record data could be used to output the 6-month probability of developing pneumonia for each patient. Akin to the lack of studies examining predictors, no studies meeting our search criteria attempted to quantify the effects of incident respiratory infections on outcomes like healthcare costs, hospital readmissions, disability, or mortality. While respiratory infections certainly have a negative impact on all such outcomes, a better understanding of the magnitude of those effects and how they vary across subgroups of LTCF residents would be valuable for developing and implementing interventions to reduce the burden of respiratory infections.",

            "text": "The literature on respiratory infections presented several challenges to interpretation. Seven articles included in this review focused on outbreaks, which give rise to estimates that are likely higher than typically observable in LTCFs. The definition of an outbreak also varies markedly across studies by geography, type of respiratory infection, population involved, time, and more [43] . Many outbreaks are generally defined as an infection incidence exceeding an expected rate. Interestingly, few data are available to quantify or provide guidance about what an accurate and reliable estimate of an \"expected rate\" is. Studies reporting higher incidence rates (e.g., > 15%) may actually be outbreak studies even if they were not labeled as such. Converse to the potential overestimation of infection rates by outbreak data, data sources like administrative claims capture only some of the most severe infections and likely underestimate the burden of respiratory infections. Administrative data may identify even fewer respiratory infection events among LTCF residents because signs and symptoms of acute infection are often not proportional to the severity of illness [43] . Interpretation of the literature is further complicated by the atypical presentation of infections in frail older adults [44] . For example, LTCF residents may have pneumonia without cough, chest pain, or fever; tachypnea or confusion may be the only indicators [45, 46] . Atypical presentation is even more likely among those who are very old, cognitively impaired, multimorbid, or frail. The atypical presentation of respiratory infections in LTCFs can therefore lead to underdiagnosis and artificially low prevalence and incidence estimates.",

The focus on North America may have resulted, in part, from our focus on LTCFs unassociated with a hospital and the differences in LTCF structure or care systems between geographic regions or countries [47] . Places other than North America have many hospital-based LTCFs or have few LTCFs due to the use of alternative care settings. If LTCFs in North America have more resources than LTCFs in other geographic regions, the large number of North American studies could meaningfully impact estimates. LTCFs with more resources are more likely to have physician extenders (e.g., nurse practitioners, physician's assistants) and larger amounts of staff to help implement interventions to reduce respiratory infections. LTCFs with more resources may also be more likely to have private rooms, which are better at limiting or containing the spread of infections. However, the incidence of RSV did not appear to differ between studies conducted in North America versus elsewhere. In aggregate, the burden of pneumonia also did not differ markedly between North America and other places, but when stratified on measure of occurrence, the incidence was higher in North America while the prevalence was higher in countries outside North America. Future studies should examine the influence of LTCF resources and characteristics on respiratory infection rates.",

Of relevance, the small number of influenza studies precluded a meaningful analysis of time trends for influenza in our review, but no linear or other time trends for pneumonia or RSV were apparent, even after stratifying on location of study (North America versus not), type of study (outbreak or non-outbreak), or estimate of occurrence (incidence or prevalence). Our results suggest that a rigorous examination of how time trends in vaccination rates have impacted time trends in respiratory infections may be necessary to understand the absence of a relationship between the two across included studies. The results of our review also suggest that policy-makers should consider LTCF-specific policies to improve uptake of preventive interventions for reducing the burden of respiratory infections [48] .",

This focus was necessary to understand the potential impact of new interventions and policies. Furthermore, many LTCF residents are unvaccinated and immunization rates remain unsatisfactorily low in LTCFs. This creates an essential need to understand the natural burden of respiratory infections and guide further prevention efforts as well as help make a more compelling argument for encouragement of vaccination by providers [51, 52] . However, since the use of vaccines has increased over time in LTCFs, our review may have unintentionally included an older evidence base that is less generalizable to contemporary LTCF residents. Related to this limitation is the challenge that many studies included populations of unvaccinated residents whose data was not presented separately from that of vaccinated residents. To remain within the scope of our review, we excluded studies that did not distinguish vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. In doing so, we may have isolated a less generalizable evidence base.",

Other respiratory viruses of potential future interest should include adenovirus, coronavirus, metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus, and rhinovirus. In older adults, respiratory viruses can also produce gastrointestinal symptoms, and therefore may go unrecognized as having a respiratory etiology.
