            "text": "Early growth response gene-1 (EGR1) is a multifunctional transcription factor that is implicated in viral infection. In this study, we observed that foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) infection significantly triggered EGR1 expression. Overexpression of EGR1 suppressed FMDV replication in porcine cells, and knockdown of EGR1 considerably promoted FMDV replication. A previously reported FMDV mutant virus (with two amino acids mutations in SAP domain) that displays a strong type I interferon (IFN) induction activity was used in this study. We found that SAP mutant FMDV infection induced a higher expression of EGR1 than wildtype FMDV infection, and also triggered higher IFN\u03b2 and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) expression than wildtype FMDV infection. This implied a link between EGR1 and type I IFN signaling. Further study showed that overexpression of EGR1 resulted in Sendai virus (SeV)-induced IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) and NF-\u03baB promoter activation. In addition, the SeV-induced ISGs expression was impaired in EGR1 knockdown cells. EGR1 upregulation promoted type I IFN signaling activation and suppressed FMDV and Seneca Valley virus replication. Suppression of the transcriptional activity of EGR1 did not affect its antiviral effect against FMDV. This study reveals a new mechanism evolved by EGR1 to enhance type I IFN signaling and suppress FMDV replication.",

            "text": "Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) is a non-enveloped virus with positive-sense and singlestranded RNA genome. The viral genome is approximately 8.5 kb nucleotides in length, including a single large open reading frame that encodes a polyprotein. The polyprotein is subsequently processed by viral proteases during protein synthesis, generating several intermediates and 12 mature proteins (Sobrino and Domingo, 2001; Grubman and Baxt, 2004) . During co-evolution with the hosts, these viral proteins have acquired many functions to counteract host antiviral responses, cause immunosuppression, and promote viral replication and infection (Mason et al., 2003; Rodriguez Pulido and Saiz, 2017) . Therefore, FMDV causes an acute vesicular disease of infected animals, which is called foot-and-mouth disease (FMD). FMD is a highly contagious disease that can lead to significant economic losses to the local livestock industry (Rweyemamu et al., 2008a; Paton and Taylor, 2011; Zai-Xin, 2015; Bouguedour and Ripani, 2016) . The understanding of host-FMDV interaction as well as the involved mechanism contributes to the planning of new strategies for FMD prevention (Domingo et al., 2005; Rweyemamu et al., 2008b; Rodriguez Pulido and Saiz, 2017) . Accordingly, many researches on host responses in FMDV-infected cells have to be investigated.",

EGR1 is involved in diverse biologic functions and a broad variety of host signal transduction cascades that mediates cell growth, survival, differentiation, apoptosis and proliferation (Pagel and Deindl, 2011; Papanikolaou et al., 2014) . Different pathways have been identified that participate in EGR1 induction and then regulates several biological behaviors. Such as, the Ras homologue gene family (Rho) genes are involved in cell cycle progression, and the Rho/Rho-kinase pathway has been shown to regulate EGR1 expression (Barrientos et al., 2007; Pagel and Deindl, 2011) . As a zinc-finger DNA-binding protein, EGR1 also regulates expression of diverse gene families by binding to promoter sequences of target genes (Papanikolaou et al., 2014) . Therefore, EGR1 is involved in activation of signal transduction of many pathways.",

EGR1 modulates pro-apoptotic pathway and promotes Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) replication (Baer et al., 2016) . Knockdown of EGR1 in Rhabdomyosarcoma cells decreases enterovirus 71 (EV71) replication (Song et al., 2015) . It seems that EGR1 might play a positive role in these viruses replication. However, EGR1 also appears critical for the initiation of immune response in B cells and T cells. EGR1 plays roles in regulation of the expression of sever cytokines including interleukin-2, CD44, ICAM-1 and tumor necrosis factor genes (Skerka et al., 1995; McMahon and Monroe, 1996; Shin et al., 2009; Cubero and Nieto, 2012) .",

(2009) . Mutation of L pro SAP domain promotes type I IFN signaling activation and decreases virus growth. In addition, animals inoculated with the FMDV SAP mutant display strong neutralizing antibody response and T cell response comparing with infection with wildtype FMDV (de los Santos et al., 2009; Diaz-San Segundo et al., 2012) . In this study, a robust EGR1 upregulation was observed in both wildtype and SAP mutant FMDV-infected cells comparing with the mock-infected cells by viewing the protein abundance of EGR1. Therefore, we investigated the correlation between FMDV infection and EGR1, and determined the antiviral role of EGR1 against FMDV. SAP mutant FMDV infection induced a higher expression of EGR1 than wildtype FMDV infection. SAP mutant FMDV infection also triggered higher IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) expression than wildtype FMDV infection. We also found that overexpression of EGR1 enhanced Sendai virus (SeV)-induced interferon (IFN)-stimulated response element (ISRE) activation. SeV-induced ISGs expression was impaired in EGR1 knockdown cells, which may serve as a link between upregulation of EGR1 and type I IFN signaling. Further study showed that EGR1 enhanced TBK1 phosphorylation during FMDV infection. It indicated that EGR1 upregulation promoted type I IFN signaling activation by enhancing TBK1 phosphorylation and resulted in decreased FMDV replication. This study reveals a link between EGR1 and innate immune response during FMDV infection.",

To investigate whether EGR1 is an IFN inducible gene, HEK293T and PK-15 cells were incubated with IFN-\u03b2 to induce the expression of IFN inducible genes. The expression of two IFN inducible genes ISG15 and ISG54 was highly induced by incubation of IFN-\u03b2. However, the expression of EGR1 was not changed by treatment of IFN-\u03b2 ( Figure 1D ).

Induction of TGF\u03b21 and p53 may lead to the tumor suppressor property of EGR1 (Baron et al., 2006) . p53, as a tumor suppressor, has also been implicated in other functions that play important roles in disease and health (Fuhrman et al., 2009 ). p53-dependent antiviral defense has been widely reported (Takaoka et al., 2003; Shin-Ya et al., 2005; Mu\u00f1oz-Fontela et al., 2008) .

However, EGR1 expression is related to viral pathogenesis during VEEV, MHV and EV71 replication. All these studies were performed using mouse or human cells, and most of these viruses can cause central nervous system (CNS) diseases. In this study we investigated the function of porcine EGR1 and showed the antiviral role of porcine EGR1 against FMDV. FMDV infection does not cause any CNS disease. Whether the difference of species or tissue tropism resulted in the different role of EGR1 in different virus infections remain unknown. However, EGR1 has been suggested to participate in IFN-\u03b3-STAT1 pathway in T cells (Shin et al., 2009) . T-bet is a Th1-specific transcription factor that is directly involved in T cells differentiation (Djuretic et al., 2007) . EGR1 regulates T-bet expression by binding to the promoter of T-bet and induces T-bet transcription (Shin et al., 2009) . T-bet plays a vital role in innate immunity, and lacking of T-bet expression increases host susceptibility to inflammatory disease (Garrett et al., 2007) . This implies a regulatory role of EGR1 in innate immunity. Besides, overexpression of EGR1 downregulates NF\u03baB inhibitor (Kim et al., 2013) , which also implies a potential role of EGR1 in innate immunity.",

It has been determined that SAP mutant FMDV infection resulted in stronger type I IFN signaling than wildtype FMDV infection (de los Santos et al., 2009) . We found that SAP mutant FMDV infection triggered higher expression of IFN-\u03b2 and ISGs than wildtype FMDV infection. This result was similar as the result reported by de los Santos et al. (2009) previously. Whether the higher expression of EGR1 correlated with the higher expression of IFN-\u03b2 and ISGs was therefore investigated. Overexpression of EGR1 significantly activated type I IFN signaling and IFN-\u03b2 and ISGs expression. Knockdown of EGR1 considerably impaired SeV-induced IFN-\u03b2 and ISGs expression. Type I IFN blocking antibodies obviously abrogated the inhibitory effects of EGR1 on FMDV propagation. This suggested EGR1 is implicated in type I IFN pathway activation. A link between EGR1 and type I IFN pathway was reported for the first time.",
