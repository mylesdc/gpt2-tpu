In the present study, an analytical method using HPLC with ultraviolet detection was developed for the quantification of lycorine in the extracts of different parts of wild plant and tissue culture samples of H. littoralis. The separation was achieved using a reversed-phase column. The method was found to be accurate, repeatable, and sensitive for the quantification of minute amount of lycorine present in the samples. The highest lycorine content was found in the bulb extract (2.54 \u00b1 0.02 g/mg) whereas the least was in the root extract (0.71 \u00b1 0.02 g/mg) of the wild plants. Few callus culture samples had high content of lycorine, comparable to that of wild plants. The results showed that plant growth regulators, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) alone at 4.5 M (2.58 \u00b1 0.38 g/mg) or a combination of 2,4-D at 9.00 M with 4.5 M of 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP), were the optimum concentrations for the production of high lycorine (2.45 \u00b1 0.15 g/mg) content in callus culture. The present analytical method could be of value for routine quantification of lycorine in the tissue culture production and standardization of the raw material or extracts of H. littoralis.",

Moreover the medicinal properties of a plant can be retained or increased via in vitro techniques. Previously, Yew et al.

Likewise, there is no report on the capability of callus culture of H. littoralis to produce secondary metabolites such as lycorine which has important pharmacological effects. The establishment and quantification of lycorine via in vitro propagation technique could be a first step in mass production of any desired secondary metabolites in pharmaceutical industries. Thus, in the present study, a simple HPLC with UV detection method was developed for phytochemical analysis of different parts of H. littoralis wild plants. The method was further extended for the quantification of lycorine in callus culture obtained from various combinations of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and 6-benzylaminopurine concentrations.",

Callus cultures supplemented with growth regulators at various combinations Comparing the amount of lycorine obtained from both wild plant and the callus tissue culture, it can be noticed that callus culture supplemented with appropriate concentrations and combination of growth regulators resulted in production of comparable amount of lycorine. This may be due to the effect of plant growth regulators (PGRs) such as the auxin and cytokinin used herein. PGRs are known to have effects not only on cell differentiation and proliferation but also on the biosynthesis pathway of the cell [22, 23] . Therefore, in this study, there may be a probability that the 2,4-D and BAP used in the callus culture could have partly been involved in the biosynthesis of lycorine. From the present study, the callus culture may be supplemented with only 4.50 M 2,4-D or a combination of 9.00 M 2,4-D with 4.5 M BAP to obtain a good yield of lycorine. This study can be further extended to investigate other combinations of PGRs that may increase the lycorine content of the callus culture. The findings of such study would prove to be useful as there are many benefits of the lycorine to the medical and health sector.",

            "text": "Statistical analyses were conducted for the lycorine content in callus (initiated via 4.5 M 2,4-D alone, 9.00 M 2,4-D with combination of 4.5 M BAP) and H. littoralis wild plant part extracts. The investigation shows that lycorine production in initiated callus at 4.5 M 2,4-D alone and 9.00 M 2,4-D with 4.5 M BAP is not significantly different while there is significant difference when compared with wild plant extract ( > 0.05). This indicates that the callus formed from these 2 different plant growth regulators is having high amount of lycorine compared to wild type plant. Thus, for the upcoming study, this hormone combination could be a good start to initiate a callus from H. littoralis to obtain secondary metabolites. Hence, the present analytical method may be of value for routine quantification of lycorine in the callus culture production and standardization of the raw material or extracts of H. littoralis.",

At 2.25 M of 2,4-D, the amount of lycorine in the extract of callus culture was similar to that found in wild plant. Combination of 4.5 M of BAP with various concentrations of 2,4-D affected the lycorine content of the callus extracts compared to those without BAP. At lower concentration of 2,4-D (2.25 M), addition of BAP greatly reduced the lycorine content. Similar finding was obtained for extracts of callus culture supplemented with 13.5 M of 2,4-D. In contrast, inclusion of BAP with 9.0 M, 18.0 M, or 22.50 M increased the lycorine content of 1.6 to 8.4 times higher compared to those callus cultures without BAP. However, when both agents were present at 4.5 M, the content of lycorine was similar to those callus extracts supplemented with only 2,4-D.",
