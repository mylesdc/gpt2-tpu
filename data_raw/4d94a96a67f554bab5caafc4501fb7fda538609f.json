In this study, the anti-herpetic and anti-dengue evaluation of 27 terpenyl-1,4-naphthoquinone (NQ), 1,4-anthraquinone (AQ) and heterocycle-fused quinone (HetQ) derivatives was done in vitro against Human Herpesvirus (HHV) type 1 and 2, and Dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2). The cytotoxicity on HeLa and Jurkat tumor cell lines was also tested. Using plaque forming unit assays, cell viability assays and molecular docking, we found that NQ 4 was the best antiviral compound, while AQ 11 was the most active and selective molecule on the tested tumor cells. NQ 4 showed a fair antiviral activity against Herpesviruses (EC 50 : <0.4 \u00b5g/mL, <1.28 \u00b5M) and DENV-2 (1.6 \u00b5g/mL, 5.1 \u00b5M) on pre-infective stages. Additionally, NQ 4 disrupted the viral attachment of HHV-1 to Vero cells (EC 50 : 0.12 \u00b5g/mL, 0.38 \u00b5M) with a very high selectivity index (SI = 1728). The in silico analysis predicted that this quinone could bind to the prefusion form of the E glycoprotein of DENV-2. These findings demonstrate that NQ 4 is a potent and highly selective antiviral compound, while suggesting its ability to prevent Herpes and Dengue infections. Additionally, AQ 11 can be considered of interest as a leader for the design of new anticancer agents.",

To prove this hypothesis, we evaluated if NQ 4 exerts its effect on attachment, when the reversible interaction between viral glycoproteins and cellular receptors occurs, or on the viral entry, when membrane fusion and virus internalization happen. Taking into account the high activity of this molecule in simultaneous treatment, lower concentrations (0.8-0.1 \u00b5g/mL) of NQ 4 were employed. This assay was performed only against HHV-1 considering, as mentioned above, that this serotype uses more cellular receptors for attachment and entry.",

The antiviral activity of several quinones against herpesviruses in late stages of infection has been reported [29] [30] [31] . In this study, we have found a different kind of antiviral effect of quinones, showing that NQ 4 exerts anti-HHV-1 activity in early stages, specifically avoiding viral attachment. To understand the impact of such interactions, we also docked the anthracycline antibiotic doxorubicin. This drug was evaluated by Kaptein et al. [16] , together with a doxorubicin derivate (SA-17) that has a squaric acid amide ester moiety at the carbohydrate group. Both were active against DENV-2 at low concentrations during the very early stages of the viral replication cycle (i.e., virus attachment and/or virus entry). During SA-17 treatment, time-of-addition studies revealed that at concentration of 10 \u00b5g/mL (15 \u00b5M), the drug attained 98% and 42% inhibition of virus replication when was added at first 0 and 2 hours of infection, respectively. Additionally, this compound failed to efficiently inhibit viral replication when was added between 4 and 12 h post-infection and did not inhibit DENV-2 RNA replication. Using the same \u03b2-OG binding site of ENV protein, Kaptein et al. [16] reported molecular docking studies for SA-17, that formed hydrogen bonds with the amino acids Ala50, Tyr137 and Gln200, and had hydrophobic contacts with Thr48, Pro53, Lys128, Leu135, Phe193, Leu198, Ala205, Ile270, Gln271, Thr280 and Gly281, some of which are critical in membrane fusion during virus entry [16] . In our case, we found that doxorubicin forms hydrogen bonds with Glu26 and His27 and displays \u03c0-stacking interactions with Phe279 ( Figure 4B ). The molecule fits part of its structure into the \u03b2-OG binding cleft of the dengue virus E glycoprotein dimer with a similar but lower score (\u22126.5 kcal/mol) than NQ 4. However, no interactions were formed with any of those amino acids found for NQ 4, or those reported for SA-17 [16] . Considering this information, it is possible to propose that NQ 4 acts in a similar way as SA-17, probably affecting DENV-2 entry, rather than its attachment as we found for HHV-1.",

This report may be consistent with our findings, considering that the lipidic membrane reconfiguration caused by this type of quinones may affect the initial interaction virus-cellular receptor, and the subsequent viral entry to the host cell. Indeed, on the basis of the predicted logP (clogP) values 3.47 (6.487), and the low tPSA (total Polar Surface Area) value of 44.6 estimated through the ChemDraw algorithms [40] for NQ 4, its membrane affinity appears fairly supported.

Among the NQs, the presence of halogens on the quinone ring improved the cytotoxicity on both cancerous and normal cells, while in the AQ group an arylamino substituent induced higher selectivity leading to the best neoplastic cytotoxicity with low toxicity for normal cells. Within the group of HetQs, only the imidazole-fused HetQ 23 and the The quinone with the highest in vitro cytotoxicity on HeLa cells was AQ 11, bearing a p-methoxyphenylamino substituent. It showed the lowest IC 50 value of 10 nM and the best SI value near 14 \u00d7 10 3 with respect to Vero cells, much better than that of the reference drug doxorubicin. In addition, AQs 16 and 17 which were cytotoxic for HeLa cells with IC 50 values of 5.6 \u00b5M and 7.5 \u00b5M, displayed SI values of 32 and 16, respectively. A SI of 14 was also observed for the dichlorinated NQ 4, though it was in the range of low cytotoxicity (IC 50 = 46.6 \u00b5M). On Jurkat cells, again AQ 11 showed a high cytotoxicity (1.4 \u00b5M) and the relevant SI value of 168, followed by NQs 2 and 3 and AQs 13 and 17, which showed IC 50 values of 6.2, 1.6, 6.3 and 9.6 \u00b5M, respectively; though with moderate to low SI values of 15, 8, 11 and 12, respectively. In addition, AQ 11 and AQ 17 were quinones with fair cytotoxicity on HeLa and Jurkat cells at lower concentrations. Finally, according to their SI values, the AQs 11, 16 and 17 were the most selective compounds on both types of cancer cells, unlike NQ derivatives.",
