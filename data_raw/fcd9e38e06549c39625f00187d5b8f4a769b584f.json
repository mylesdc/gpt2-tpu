            "text": "Zika virus (ZIKV) infection remains a serious health threat due to its close association with congenital Zika syndrome (CZS), which includes microcephaly and other severe birth defects. As no vaccines are available for human use, continuous effort is needed to develop effective and safe vaccines to prevent ZIKV infection. In this study, we constructed three recombinant proteins comprising, respectively, residues 296-406 (E296-406), 298-409 (E298-409), and 301-404 (E301-404) of ZIKV envelope (E) protein domain III (EDIII) fused with a C-terminal Fc of human IgG. Our results demonstrated that E298-409 induced the highest titer of neutralizing antibodies against infection with nine ZIKV strains isolated from different hosts, countries, and time periods, and it maintained long-term anti-ZIKV immunogenicity to induce neutralizing antibodies. Pups born to mice immunized with E298-409 were fully protected against lethal challenge with two epidemic human ZIKV strains, 2015/Honduras (R103451) and 2015/Colombia (FLR). Passive transfer of anti-E298-409 mouse sera protected pups born to naive mice, as well as type I interferon receptordeficient adult A129 mice, from lethal challenge with human ZIKV strains R103451 and FLR, and this protection was positively correlated with neutralizing antibodies. These data suggest that the critical neutralizing fragment (i.e., a fragment that can induce highly potent neutralizing antibodies against divergent ZIKV strains) of ZIKV EDIII is a good candidate for development as an effective and safe ZIKV subunit vaccine to protect pregnant mothers and their fetuses against ZIKV infection. The E298-409-specific antibodies can be used for passive immunization to prevent ZIKV infection in newborns or immunocompromised adults.",

The full-length genome of ZIKV encodes structural proteins, such as capsid (C), membrane (M) or precursor membrane (prM), and envelope (E), in addition to non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2a, NS2b, NS3, NS4a, NS4b, and NS5) 21, 22 , among which E protein is the major protein for inducing neutralizing antibodies against ZIKV infection 23, 24 and, thus, a main target for developing ZIKV vaccines. ZIKV E protein consists of domain I (DI), domain II (DII), domain III (DIII), a stalk region, and a transmembrane domain (Supplementary Figure S1A) 25 . A number of ZIKV Ebased vaccines were developed targeting prM-E or fulllength E 11, 14, 16, 26 , whereas a few have attempted to target fragments of ZIKV E protein domains, particularly EDIII, to identify important regions in the E protein for developing more effective and safer ZIKV vaccines 27 .",

Specifically, the level of E298-409-elicited neutralizing antibodies was significantly higher than that induced by either E296-406 or E301-404 against epidemic human 2015 strains FLR (Fig. 1a) and PAN2015 (Fig. 1c) , 2013 strain PLCal_ZV (Fig. 1f) , and 1968 strain IbH 30656 (Fig. 1g) . By comparison, no ZIKV-specific neutralizing antibody was detected in the control mice injected with PBS (Fig. 1) . The above results demonstrated that ZIKV EDIII fragments, particularly E298-409, were capable of eliciting highly potent neutralizing antibodies against divergent human, mosquito, and rhesus ZIKV strains from different countries and years.",

Therefore, we initially used pups born to immunized female BALB/c mice at 7 months post immunization for ZIKV challenge ( Supplementary Figure S3B) . Theoretically, if pups receive anti-ZIKV neutralizing antibodies from their mothers during pregnancy, they are expected to be protected against ZIKV infection.

All pups born to the above three EDIII fragment-immunized mice had increased weights during the detection period (14 days) after challenge with both R103451 (Fig. 3c) and FLR (Fig. 3d) strains.

In contrast to the above results, pups born to the mice injected with PBS did not survive challenge with the R103451 (Fig. 3a) and FLR (Fig. 3b) strains, and all of them died at 10 and 11 days p.i., respectively, with decreased weights 4 and 6 days post-challenge with R103451 (Fig. 3c) or FLR (Fig. 3d) .

The antibody titers were expressed as the endpoint dilutions that remained positively detectable and are presented as the means \u00b1 SE of the mice in each group (n = 5). For EDIII-specific IgG (a), significant differences were observed between E298-409 and E296-406 at 2, 7, and 10 months (*P < 0.05), and between E296-406 and E301-404 at 10 months (*P < 0.05) post immunization. For E-specific IgG (b), significant differences were found between E298-409 and E296-406 at 2, 7 (*P < 0.05), and 10 months (**P < 0.01), and between E296-406 and E301-404 at 7 (*P < 0.05) and 10 months (**P < 0.01) post immunization.

For IgG2a, significant differences occurred between E298-408 and E296-406 at 2 months (**P < 0.01), and between E298-409 or E301-404 and E296-406 (*P < 0.05) at 7 months post immunization. (B) The aforementioned sera were tested by PRNT assay against infection with ZIKV R103451 (a) or FLR (b) strain. The neutralizing antibody titers were expressed as PRNT 50 and are presented as the means \u00b1 SE of the mice in each group (n = 5). Significant differences occurred between E298-409 and the other two EDIII fragments against R103451 (*P < 0.05) and FLR (**P < 0.01), respectively, at the indicated months post immunization.

Pups transferred with anti-E298-409 sera, which had a higher neutralizing antibody titer than either the anti-E296-406 or anti-E301-404 sera against ZIKV R103451 (Fig. 4a) and FLR (Fig. 4b) , exhibited the highest survival rates among the three groups after challenge with both ZIKV strains (Fig. 4c, d) . As expected, pups receiving anti-E301-404 sera, which had the lowest neutralizing antibody titer against both R103451 and FLR (Fig. 4a, b) , had the lowest survival rates among the three groups after challenge with R103451 and FLR (Fig. 4c, d) . Clearly, pups receiving sera of mice immunized with all three EDIII fragments were able to maintain their body weight after challenge with both ZIKV strains (Fig. 4e, f) . In contrast, pups in the sham controls did not survive ZIKV challenge, and all pups died at 12 and 11 days p.i., respectively, of R103451 and FLR strains (Fig. 4c, d) , with continually decreasing weights after 6 days post-challenge with both ZIKV strains (Fig. 4e, f) .",

By comparing the cross-neutralization and protection of three recombinant vaccines encoding ZIKV EDIII fragments of different lengths, we identified a critical neutralizing fragment containing residues 298-409 of EDIII (e.g., E298-409) that induced the highest titers of cross-neutralizing antibodies against infection with nine ZIKV strains with different or the same EDIII sequences isolated from different hosts, regions, and time periods. The identified E298-409 fragment with the highest neutralizing potential had the protective efficacy to protect newborns and lethal adult A129 mice against the two epidemic human strains of ZIKV tested. These data suggest that the N-and C-terminal residues of ZIKV EDIII have important roles in inducing protective neutralizing antibodies and that an appropriate extension of EDIII residues to the N-terminal DI region and C-terminal stalk region (Supplementary Figure S1 ) helps in the production of effective neutralizing antibodies against ZIKV infection.",

Here, we found that, similar to ZV-54 mAb, which maintained the highest neutralizing capacity (the lowest ND 50 ) in neutralizing R103451 (Supplementary Figure S5) , a recent human ZIKV strain, anti-E298-409 pAb also had the highest neutralizing activity against this viral strain (Fig. 1 ). In addition, both EDIII-specific pAb and mAb can effectively neutralize other epidemic human ZIKV strains tested, including FLR, PAN2015, PAN2016, and PRVABC59 ( Fig. 1; Supplementary Figure S5 ), suggesting a broad neutralizing capacity of ZIKV EDIII-specific antibodies against infection with ZIKV, particularly the pandemic human strains. As a number of variations have been demonstrated in the different strains of ZIKV tested, including viral E proteins (Supplementary Figure S4) , the ability of the identified critical neutralizing domain of EDIII (e.g., E298-409) to induce cross-neutralization and protective efficacy will be beneficial and provide useful guidance for the development of effective vaccines to protect against current and future epidemic ZIKV strains.",

Therefore, it is critically important to develop vaccines with potent efficacy to protect pregnant women, as well as their fetuses and newborns, against ZIKV infection, reducing the occurrence of CZS, particularly microcephaly. In this study, we evaluated the ability of ZIKV EDIII fragments to protect against ZIKV infection in pups born to immunized female mice. We confirmed that the pups born to E298-409-immunized mice had highly potent neutralizing antibody responses and were fully protected against lethal ZIKV challenge. Fig. 6 Adoptive transfer of sera of mice immunized with E298-409 of ZIKV EDIII significantly alleviated viral replication and pathological effects in ZIKV-infected A129 mice. (A) Five-week-old A129 mice (n = 6) were passively transferred with anti-E298-409 sera (e.g., 10 5 ZIKV EDIIIspecific IgG antibody titer), challenged with ZIKV R103451 or FLR (10 3 PFU) strains 6 h before and 12 h after infection, and detected for ZIKV RNA by qRT-PCR in tissues (brain, lung, kidney, liver, and spleen) and sera at 3 days p.i. The data are presented as the means \u00b1 SE of six mice in each group. The experiments were repeated twice and similar results were obtained. Significant differences (*P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001) were seen between E298-409 and sham control groups in the test tissues and sera. (B) Five-week-old A129 mice were passively transferred with anti-E298-409 sera (a, c), infected with ZIKV R103451 as above, and detected for pathological changes at 5 days p.i. Representative images from mouse brain (a, b) and lung (c, d) tissues are shown. The H&E-stained tissue sections were observed under light microscopy (\u00d710 magnification).

Particularly, adoptively transferred neutralizing mouse sera specific to the identified E298-409 fragment conferred to newborns complete protection against lethal challenge with two epidemic human ZIKV strains. Such sera with neutralizing activity were also protective against infection with the above two ZIKV strains in type I interferon receptor-deficient adult A129 mice, significantly preventing viral replication and increasing mouse survival.
