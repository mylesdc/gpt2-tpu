The dried slides were scanned at 2 \u00b5m/pixel resolution using the InnoScan is900 (Innopsys, Carbonne, France). Image analysis was performed with Mapix 6.5.0 software, and calculated values for all spots were saved as GenePix results files. Stored data were evaluated using the R software and the limma package from BioConductor [6] [7] [8] . Log 2 mean spot signals were taken for further analysis. Data were background corrected using the NormExp procedure on the negative control spots and quantile-normalized before averaging. For filtering of \"expressed\" genes the distribution of log 2 signal intensities of the negative control spots was determined for each array. A regular spot was considered \"present\" when its signal was 3 times higher than the interquartile width of the 3rd quartile. A gene was considered \"expressed\" on an array when at least 50% of the spots for this gene were \"present\". A gene was considered \"expressed\" in a group of biological samples, when this gene was judged \"expressed\" in at least 50% of the arrays of this group. For Fig. 1A , selections of regulated genes from single hybridizations were made based on the noise observed between hybridizations of heat-inactivated controls. A heuristic noise-band function was set up to distinguish a regulation from noise so that the probability of a falsely identified regulated gene is < 0.1%. The noise-band function is \u00b11.5\u00b78/A, where A is the average log 2 signal. KEGG pathway analyses were done using gene set tests on the ranks of the tvalues (when available) or log 2 fold-changes [6, 9] . The significances for the KEGG pathway perturbations were calculated by the function geneSetTest from limma. The statistics were calculated for all three alternatives \"mixed\", \"up\", and \"down\", and the smallest p value was taken and Bonferroni corrected. In this analysis only genes were considered with average signal intensities in at least one group that were considerably higher than the average signal of negative controls on the arrays as described above. The significances for the over-representation of selected gene lists were calculated by Fisher's exact test. As for the gene set tests, only \"expressed\" genes were considered.",
