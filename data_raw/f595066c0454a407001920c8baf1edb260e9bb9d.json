            "text": "RNA-protein interactions (RPIs) have critical roles in numerous fundamental biological processes, such as post-transcriptional gene regulation, viral assembly, cellular defence and protein synthesis. As the number of available RNA-protein binding experimental data has increased rapidly due to high-throughput sequencing methods, it is now possible to measure and understand RNA-protein interactions by computational methods. In this study, we integrate a sequence-based derived kernel with regularized least squares to perform prediction. The derived kernel exploits the contextual information around an amino acid or a nucleic acid as well as the repetitive conserved motif information. We propose a novel machine learning method, called RPiRLS to predict the interaction between any RNA and protein of known sequences. For the RPiRLS classifier, each protein sequence comprises up to 20 diverse amino acids but for the RPiRLS-7G classifier, each protein sequence is represented by using 7-letter reduced alphabets based on their physiochemical properties. We evaluated both methods on a number of benchmark data sets and compared their performances with two newly developed and state-of-the-art methods, RPI-Pred and IPMiner. On the non-redundant benchmark test sets extracted from the PRIDB, the RPiRLS method outperformed RPI-Pred and IPMiner in terms of accuracy, specificity and sensitivity. Further, RPiRLS achieved an accuracy of 92% on the prediction of lncRNA-protein interactions. The proposed method can also be extended to construct RNA-protein interaction networks. The RPiRLS web server is freely available at http://bmc.med.stu.edu.cn/RPiRLS.",

            "text": "The interactions of proteins with other proteins, peptides, DNAs and RNAs govern most the essential molecular function. RNA-protein interactions (RPIs) have a critical influence on post-transcriptional gene regulation [1] [2] [3] , viral assembly [4] [5] [6] , cellular defence [7] , protein synthesis [8, 9] and various other fundamental biological processes [10, 11] . A significant portion of transcripts is long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) which are not translated into proteins and are longer than 200 nucleotides [12] . LncRNAs normally function with their interacting proteins [13] . For instance, the lncRNA HOTAIR regulated the HOXD locus in trans by interacting with PcG proteins [14] ; several lncRNAs were shown to be able to interact with AUF1, a protein linked to aging and cancer [15] ; lncRNAs binding to JARID2 protein were essential for the recruitment of PRC2 to the chromatin [16] ; lncRNA GAS5 inhibited hepatitis C virus replication by decoying HCV NS3 protein [17] . Hence, the study of RPIs is essential for understanding their functions. Compared to those of protein-protein interactions and DNA-protein interactions, current knowledge regarding RNA-protein interactions, especially lncRNA-protein interactions is still limited. In this study, we propose a novel machine learning method, which we call RNA-protein interaction prediction based on regularized least squares (RPiRLS), to quantitatively predict the potential RNA-protein interactions.",

            "text": "The experimental determination of RPIs remains expensive and time-consuming [18] [19] [20] , but fortunately, the accumulated RPI experimental data facilitate the development of computational models for RPI prediction [21] [22] [23] . In 2011, Pancaldi and B .. ahler [24] introduced a computational approach for RBP (RNA binding protein)-mRNA interaction prediction. They employed Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Random Forests (RFs) based on more than 100 physical and functional features of RPIs, including gene ontology, chromosomal position, gene and protein physical properties, protein localization, experimental translation, mRNA properties, predicted protein structure, UTR properties and genetic interactions. Bellucci et al. [25] proposed a method called catRAPID for the prediction of protein lncRNA interaction. They evaluated the interaction propensities of protein-RNA based on their physicochemical properties, including secondary structure, hydrogen bonding and van der Waals. Muppirala et al. [26] developed a method called RPISeq, which predicted RPIs solely based on primary sequences. The RPISeq method still employed SVMs and RFs but exploited different features. They represented each sequence of proteins and RNAs as the normalized frequencies of the corresponding 3-mer and 4-mer, respectively. In 2013, based on the same feature vectors presented in Muppirala et al., Wang et al. [27] first reduced the dimensionality of feature vectors, and then performed the RPIs prediction by using naive Bayes classifier which assumed the independence of attributes and by using extended naive Bayes classifier which considered the correlation between attributes. Lu et al. [28] integrated the information on the secondary structure, hydrogen bonding propensities and Van der Waals of lncRNAs and proteins with Fisher's linear discriminant model. In 2015, Suresh et al. [29] developed a method called RPI-Pred to predict RPIs by considering the high-order 3D protein and RNA structure information. In 2016, Pan et al. [30] proposed a new method named IPMiner that integrated deep learning with stacked ensembling to improve the prediction performance of ncRNA-protein interactions.",

The motivation is to relate the sequence information of proteins and RNAs to their biological functions, i.e., interactions. Our method attempted to extract discriminant subsequence features from amino acid sequences and nucleotide sequences. The derived kernel measures the similarity between two biological sequences by capturing nucleic acid or amino acid compositions and repetitive sequence patterns. We used regularized least squares in learning as the computations performed by RLS algorithms can be expressed using just inner products, hence allowing efficient implementation of kernel-based learning, in addition the RLS algorithms often perform comparable to the best batch classifiers [32] . Since the dimensionality of feature space increases exponentially with the template size, for computational sake, we set upper limit for template size. On the other hand, we categorized 20 amino acids into several groups based on their physiochemical properties [33] [34] [35] , the reduced alphabet representation of the protein sequence allows larger template size and also decreases the dimensionality of feature space.",

            "text": "We considered the derived kernel with two-layer architecture, hence there were two template sets, denoted as T P and T R needed to be constructed for protein and RNA, respectively. Here we considered all possible substrings of the same length making up a template set. The template set T P for amino acid sequences was composed of substrings with k continuous amino acids, while the template set T R for nucleic acid sequences was composed of substrings with l continuous nucleic acids. In order to extract discriminant subsequence features from amino acid sequences and nucleotide sequences, we explored the effect on RPI prediction over a range of choices for the template sizes of protein and RNA. The training set RPI2662 was used to determine these parameters. In our case, we used different template sizes of protein and RNA chosen from set {1, 2, . . . , 4} \u222a {1, 2, . . . , 8} for RPiRLS and {1, 2, . . . , 6} \u222a {1, 2, . . . , 8} for RPiRLS-7G. With different combination of protein template size and RNA template size, the combined kernelK dk 2 was integrated with RLS to predict RNA-protein interactions. The ten-fold stratified cross-validation has been verified to be the best algorithm for model selection on a large scale experiments [36] , therefore on the data set RPI2662, we tuned the parameter \u03bb by ten-fold stratified cross-validation with the optional parameter set {\u03bb = e n , n = \u221215, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , 15}. The data set RPI2662 was divided into ten mutually exclusive folds and the mean response of each fold was approximately equal. In each test we merged 9 parts of the samples as the training set and left the other part as the test set. The parameter \u03bb was chosen by leave-one-out cross-validation on the training set. For RPiRLS, in all the ten sets, \u03bb = e \u22122 uniformly achieved the best performance in the training data. Tables 1 and 2 showed the performance of the proposed method in terms of AUC and accuracy with different combination of parameters k and l, respectively. The experiment results showed that when the protein template size k = 2 and the RNA template size l = 5, the model performs best with AUC score of 0.926 and accuracy of 0.830. The other measurements of specificity (SP) and sensitivity (SE) were 0.771 and 0.890, respectively. While for RPiRLS-7G, \u03bb = e \u22123 uniformly performed best in all the ten sets. Table 3 showed that the method achieved the best prediction accuracy of 0.823 when the protein template size k = 3 and the RNA template size l = 4. The other measurements (AUC, SP and SE) were observed as 0.902, 0.761 and 0.884, respectively. The computational results showed that the RPiRLS classifier outperformed the RPiRLS-7G classifier in terms of various performance measurements, indicating that the diversity of amino acids at a sequence is important for the prediction of RPIs. The performance of predicting RPIs was evaluated by using 10-fold stratified cross-validation on the RPI2662 data set. Different combinations of parameters k and l were evaluated.

For Escherichia coli, the RPiRLS classifier made much more errors than the RPI-Pred method, with predictive accuracies of 45% vs. 86%. The performance of RPiRLS for Escherichia coli was much poorer than that for the other five organisms. In order to analyze why RPiRLS had relative poor performance on Escherichia coli, we estimated the amino acid composition of Escherichia coli compared with that of the other five organisms. As shown in Figure 3 , we found that Escherichia coli had relative higher observing frequencies of Alanine and Valine as well as much lower content of Serine compared with that of the other five organisms. The amino acid composition bias in Escherichia coli probably leaded to poor results.

High-throughput sequencing methods have accumulated huge amount of RNA-protein binding experimental data and opened new possibilities to measure and understand RNA-protein interactions by computational methods. Most of the previous computational works on RPIs focus on the prediction of RNA-binding proteins or RNA-binding residues in a protein sequence [34, [42] [43] [44] .

The derived kernel exploited the contextual information around an amino acid or a nucleic acid as well as the repetitive conserved motif information. Our results demonstrated that only the sequence structures of RNAs and proteins provide sufficient information to accurately predict RNA-protein interactions, especially long non-coding RNA-protein interactions. Specifically, the RPiRLS classifier considered each protein sequence comprising up to 20 diverse amino acids, while the RPiRLS-7G classifier encoded each protein sequence by using the 7-letter reduced alphabets according to amino acid physiochemical properties. The computational results showed that the RPiRLS classifier was superior to the RPiRLS-7G classifier in reliability and effectiveness, indicating that the diversity of amino acids at a sequence has critical impact on the function of RNA-binding proteins. On two non-redundant benchmark data sets extracted from the PRIDB, the RPiRLS method outperformed RPI-Pred and IPMiner in terms of accuracy, specificity and sensitivity. Compared with RPI-Pred and IPMiner, the RPiRLS method obtained a reasonable sensitivity at a lower false positive rate. Further, RPiRLS achieved an accuracy of 92% compared to 89% for RPI-Pred on the prediction of lncRNA-protein interactions. The RPiRLS method can be extended to construct RNA-protein interaction networks and therefore helps us to gain insights into post-transcriptional gene regulation.",

            "text": "The reason for the good performance of the proposed method may be due to several factors. Firstly, the use of similarity scores is a significant conceptual change in protein/RNA evaluation, quantifying the overall similarity between proteins, RNAs and their interactions. Combining kernels by tensor product for the set of RNA-protein pairs allowing to share information across the RNA-binding proteins considerably improved the prediction, especially in the case of RNAs with few known binding proteins. Secondly, we have found that contiguous k-mer frequencies alone captured rich statistical information on the repetitive conserved motif of RNA-protein pairs and the diversity of amino acids at a sequence has also contributed to an observed improvement contrast to RPI-Pred which just applied 1-letter frequency for both protein and RNA. Finally, a kernel works as a measure of similarity and supports the application of powerful machine learning algorithms such as regularized least squares which we used in this paper. The RLS mehod enables us to efficiently search for an optimized parameter \u03bb at essentially no additional cost [31] . Further, our model was trained on a large data set which contained 2662 RNA-protein pairs, and yielded more robust results. In contrast, IPMiner had much more model parameters to fit as combining deep learning with stacked ensembling, however, was trained on a small data set of just 488 RNA-protein pairs, and thus showed a significantly positive bias on predicting ncRNA-protein interactions. The main disadvantage of the proposed method is that the method is purely data-driven, in the sense that it relies solely on information derived from amino acid sequences and nucleic acid sequences, and thus does not consider higher structural information of protein and RNA. While this may be seen as an advantage, since it can predict any RNA-protein pair of known sequences.",

The Protein-RNA Interface Data base (PRIDB) V2.0 [48] identifies interfacial residues in RNA-protein complexes and also calculates atomic distances between interfacial residues. The RB344 and RB1179 are two precalculated data sets in the PRIDB, which respectively consist of 344 and 1179 RNA-binding protein chains. After combining the RB344 and RB1179 data sets, we obtained a total of 1750 experimentally validated non-redundant RNA-protein pairs, which had at least two atoms respectively coming from RNA and protein with distance no more than 4 \u00c5. Next, we removed redundant RNA-protein pairs, which are the same protein chains interacting with the same RNA chains. Further, we removed those RNA-protein pairs with amino acid sequence length < 25 or nucleic acid sequence length < 15. Finally, we obtained a positive sample set which consisted of 1331 experimentally validated RNA-protein pairs. So far there are no definite negative samples of RNA-protein interactions that are available. To construct a balanced negative sample set (\"RNA-protein non-interacting pairs\"), we made it by randomly permute the proteins in the positive sample set but kept the RNA fixed. We repeated the permutation process until no negative pairs existed in the positive sample set. As a result, the training set, called RPI2662, was composed of 1331 RNA-protein interacting pairs and 1331 RNA-protein non-interacting pairs.",
