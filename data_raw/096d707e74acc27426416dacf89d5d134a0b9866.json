We examined the inhibitory effects of nonanatural products mixture (NPM-9), which provides immunoregulatory activation, on Th2-mediated skin allergic inflammation. Oral administration of NPM-9 in mice reduced ear thickness and specific IgE production in trimellitic anhydride-(TMA-)induced contact hypersensitivity (CHS). NPM-9 also suppressed IL-4 and IL-1 production in splenocytes but prevented only TMA-induced IL-1 production in inflamed ears. To characterize the mechanism of this effect, we examined NPM-9 immunosuppression on an OVA-induced Th2 allergic state. Oral administration of NPM-9 inhibited Th2-mediated serum IgE overproduction. NPM-9 also downregulated the polarized Th2 response, whereas it upregulated Th1 response in splenocytes. These data suggest that NPM-9 may be a useful therapeutic agent for allergic inflammatory diseases through its suppression of the Th2-mediated allergic response.",

            "text": "Allergic dermatitis (AD) is characterized by allergic skin inflammation. Among the various types of AD, contact dermatitis is induced by an allergic response to a multitude of chemical substances associated with environmental contamination. Dysregulated type 1 helper T cell (Th1) and Th2 responses are pathogenic in allergic dermatitis via Th2 production of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 [1, 2] . Th2 cytokines promote mast cell development. Mast cells are key effectors in immunoglobulin (Ig) E-associated Th2-type immune responses because they are activated by cross linking of Fc RI. Allergen-provoked mast cells trigger release of allergic inflammatory mediators including histamine via degranulation [3] . IFN-suppresses IgE production by B cells, as well as IL-4 production from Th2 cells [4] . Therefore, the development of dermatitis is thought to be caused primarily by overproduction of Th2-mediated cytokines [5, 6] .",

Turmeric produces an immunomodulatory response by stimulating dendritic cell function [20] .

Each treatment was performed on days 9-15. Body weight and water intake were measured daily. Ear thickness was determined with a custom-built micrometer (Schering AG, Germany). Ears were mechanically homogenized in 2 mL PBS (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), centrifuged at 25,000 g for 30 min at room temperature, and cultured in the presence of 5 g/mL ConA. Cytokines were measured in the supernatant. Blood samples were obtained from the brachial plexus to estimate the immunoglobulin titer by ELISA 24 h after the final treatment. Spleens were removed and incubated with 5 g/mL ConA for 72 h. Cytokine production was measured by ELISA.",

In all but the na\u00efve group, 5% TMA challenge on days 0 and 5 and subsequent daily low-dose challenges with 2% TMA for 10 days induced a significant increase in ear thickness; this increase was inhibited by prednisolone (30 mg/kg BW), which served as the positive control [18] . Daily NPM-9 gavage (250 mg/kg BW) also produced an incremental decline in ear thickness (Figure 2(b) ).

Serum was collected from each group for serum IgE measurements (Figure 3(a) ). The TMA-induced CHS model displays characteristics of AD such as increased IgE. Allergen-specific IgE triggers local inflammatory responses, eventually generating various allergic responses [23] . In this study, serum IgE levels in TMA-treated CHS mice were higher than in nontreated mice, and oral NPM-9 administration suppressed this effect (Figure 3(a) ). The capability of NPM-9 to reduce serum TMA-specific IgE was compared to that of prednisolone. but not IL-4 ( Figure 3(b) ). In splenocytes, NPM-9 reduced IL-4 and IL-1 without cytotoxicity (Figures 3(c) and 3(d) ). It is possible that NPM-9 had not yet induced Th2 migration to the inflamed regions but was sufficiently potent to downregulate Th2 in splenocytes. These results show that oral administration of NPM-9 constricted TMA-induced dermal inflammation; the biological basis of this inhibition appears to involve the balance of Th2 cells in the immune system. It is also important to demonstrate IFN-production in skin inflammation. There are distinct types of TMA-induced skin inflammation mouse models: acute TMA-induced CHS in Balb/c mice with subacute and chronic models of TMAinduced ear inflammation. In comparison to the acute model, the chronic TMA-induced CHS model exhibits a mixed type 1 and 2 T-cell differentiation and activation pattern [21] ; however, the TMA-induced CHS mouse model used in this study is acute or subacute, characterized by eosinophil and Tcell infiltration, Th2 cytokine production, and IgE expression [21] . Moreover, oral administration of NPM-9 suppressed early-phase Th2 skewing, prohibiting the development of chronic inflammation. Therefore, we examined the Th2dependent immune responses (IgE and IL-4) and proinflammatory cytokine IL-1 as indicators of Th2-mediated skin inflammation; however, the effect of NPM-9 on IFNproduction in both Th1-s and Th2-dependent chronic skin inflammation requires further study.",

The IC 50 ratio of IL-4 versus IFN-in the presence of NPM-9 was 1.6-to 48-fold higher than that with each extract alone.

            "text": "Th2-Mediated Allergic Mice. To determine how NPM-9 administration in OVA-sensitized mice modulates the Th1 and Th2 pathways, splenocyte levels of IL-4 and IFN-were determined using the OVA-induced allergic mouse described above. IFN-and IL-12 levels were greater in the splenocytes of NPM-9-treated OVA-stimulated mice than in untreated mice. IL-4 was suppressed in the splenocytes of NPM-9treated versus the untreated OVA-stimulated group. However, IL-10 secretion was not enhanced by NPM-9 treatment (Figures 4(c) -4(f)). The effect of NPM-9 on IL-12 and IL-10 is interesting in the context of macrophages. IL-12, a product of activated macrophages, induces the Th1 cytokine pattern [25] , and IL-10 inhibits macrophage-dependent cytokine synthesis by Th1 cells [26] . That is, Th1 cells can be inhibited by IL-10 but induced by IL-12 through the regulation of macrophages. Consistent with this model, we speculated that NPM-9 suppression of Th2-mediated allergic responses such as skin inflammation may occur through the induction of Th1 via macrophages. Based on the immunomodulatory effects of NPM-9 in the TMA-induced dermatitis model, we conclude that the diverse active compounds of NPM-9 have synergistic effects on allergic responses. The main chemical constituents in each compound include coumarin, luteolin, and caffeic and chlorogenic acids in hawkweed [27] ; rosmarinic acid in beefsteak plant [28] ; baicalein and wogonin in skullcap [29] ; glycyrrhizin in licorice [30] ; poly -glutamic acid and isoflavone in fermented soybean paste (Cheonggukjang) [13] ; alkylamides and piperine in black pepper [12] ; saponin and flavonoid in fenugreek [31] ; curcumin in turmeric [14] ; and catechin in green tea [32] . Many studies have reported that flavonoids such as curcumin or catechin have immunomodulatory activities. Glycyrrhizin enhances LPS-induced IL-12 production by peritoneal macrophages independent of IFNand GM-CSF [33] . Saponin and poly -glutamic acid have immunostimulatory effects on the immune function of lymphocytes or the immune responses to vaccine immunizations [14, 34, 35] . Oral administration of NPM-9 (250 mg/kg/d) for 2 weeks had no adverse effects in mice, demonstrating that NPM-9 is safe even at high concentrations. The safety and immunomodulatory effects of NPM-9 may result from the interaction of active ingredient in each extract. Thus, NPM-9 may be a safe, natural therapy for allergic diseases such as atopic dermatitis, allergic coryza, and asthma.",

NPM-9 inhibits the polarized Th2 response through Th1 skewing that is dependent on IFN-and IL-12 secretion in an OVAinduced Th2 allergic state. Our results provide scientific proof of the prevention and treatment of skin allergic inflammation by the synergistically inhibitory effects of food and herb extracts on Th2-polarized allergic responses.",
