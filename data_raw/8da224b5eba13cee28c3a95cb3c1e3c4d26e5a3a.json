We will be searching PubMed, Embase, African Journals Online, Web of Science, and Global Index Medicus. The selection of relevant studies, extraction of data, and evaluation of the quality of the articles will be carried out independently by two review authors, and the discrepancies will be resolved by consensus or intervention of a third author. The heterogeneity of the studies will be assessed using the \u03c7 2 test on Cochrane's Q statistic. Publication bias will be assessed by the Egger test. Studies will be pooled using a random-effect meta-analysis model. Results will be presented by age group and subregion of Africa. Using meta-regression models, we will identify factors associated with viral infections in people with ARTI.",

The burden of these infections is essentially supported by Sub-Saharan Africa which recorded about a quarter of all deaths (0.7 million death) [1] . Several viruses have been identified as etiologic agents responsible for ARTI. The clinically most important are classified into 6 families which include Paramyxoviridae (human respirovirus 1 and 3, human rubulavirus 2 and 4 previously named Parainfluenza virus 1-4), Pneumoviridae (respiratory syncytial virus A and B and human metapneumovirus A and B), Picornaviridae (enterovirus A to J and rhinovirus A to C), Coronaviridae (human coronavirus: HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV and HCoV-EMC), Orthomyxoviridae (Influenza A, B, and C), and Adenoviridae (human adenovirus A to G) [2] . The ecology of Africa can give to this continent a specific epidemiological profile for ARTI. To date and to the best of our knowledge, one systematic review of data published between 2000 and 2015 on the prevalence of respiratory pathogens only in children under 5 living in Africa has been reported [3] . This systematic review considered only data from sub-Saharan Africa did not perform a meta-analysis and quality assessment of the included articles. In the present systematic review with meta-analysis, we will include population regardless of age and from the entire African continent including Northern Africa. We will therefore able to compare the epidemiology of viral aetiologies of acute respiratory tract infections among age groups and among geographical regions of the continent.",

Egger's test will serve to assess the presence of publication bias [9] . A p value < 0.10 on Egger test will be considered indicative of statistically significant publication bias. Heterogeneity will be evaluated by the \u03c7 2 test on Cochrane's Q statistic [10] , which will be quantified by H and I 2 values. The I 2 statistic estimates the percentage of total variation across studies due to true between-study differences rather than chance. In general, I 2 values greater than 60-70% indicate the presence of substantial heterogeneity [11] . Subgroup analyses will be performed for the following subgroups: age groups (0-5 years versus > 5 years), population (children [\u2264 15 years] versus adults), clinical presentation (severe versus benign forms), and UNSD African Regions. Univariable meta-regression will be used to test for an effect of study and participants' characteristics (year of publication, seasonality, number of screened viruses, clinical presentation, age groups, population, UNSD of regions, absolute latitude [distance to equator], latitude, longitude, and altitude). Following crude overall prevalence, we will conduct two sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of our findings.
