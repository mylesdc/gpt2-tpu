            "text": "Tylophorine derivatives exhibit anti-cancer activities but their cellular targets remain unknown. We used a biotinylated tylophorine derivative to probe for the interacting cellular target(s) of tylophorine. Tylophorine directly binds to caprin-1 and consequently enhances the recruitment of G3BP1, c-Myc mRNA, and cyclin D2 mRNA to form a ribonucleoprotein complex. Subsequently, this tylophorine targeted ribonucleoprotein complex is sequestered to the polysomal fractions and the protein expressions of the associated mRNA-transcripts are repressed. Caprin-1 depleted carcinoma cells become more resistant to tylophorine, associated with decreased formation of the ribonucleoprotein complex targeted by tylophorine. Consequently, tylophorine downregulates c-Myc and cyclins D1/D2, causing hypophosphorylation of Rb and suppression of both processing-body formation and the Warburg effect. Gene expression profiling and gain-of-c-Myc-function experiments also revealed that the downregulated c-Myc contributes to the anti-oncogenic effects of tylophorine compounds. Furthermore, the potent tylophorine derivative dibenzoquinoline-33b elicited a similar effect, as c-Myc protein levels were also decreased in xenograft tumors treated with dibenzoquinoline-33b. Thus, tylophorine compounds exert anticancer activity predominantly by targeting and sequestering the caprin-1 protein and c-Myc mRNA associated ribonucleoprotein complex.",

Myc expression is deregulated in a wide range of human cancers and is therefore a therapeutic target. Recently, it was found that the RNA-binding protein human antigen R inhibits c-Myc expression by recruiting miRNA let-7-loaded RISC (RNA miRNAinduced silencing complex) to the c-Myc 3'UTR [6] . This raises the possibility of developing c-Myc inhibitors by targeting its associated RNP.",

Recently, we successfully synthesized potent tylophorine-derived dibenzoquinolines that elicit the same biological functions as traditional pentacyclic tylophorine compounds [23] . Therefore, we concluded that the angular dibenzoquinoline moiety in tylophorine compounds is responsible for the interactions with their direct target molecule(s). Thus, we sought to design and synthesize a biotinylated tylophorine-derived dibenzoquinoline (Fig. 1A) , referred to herein as the \"biotinylated tylophorine\", to probe direct interacting molecules in cells. The biotinylated tylophorine retained anti-cancer cell activity with IC 50 values of ~13-30 \u00b5M against HONE-1, MCF7, or NUGC-3 carcinoma cells (see Supplemental Table 1 ).",

Moreover, a low abundance of cyclin D2 has been observed in certain carcinoma cell lines [30] [31] [32] , such as MCF7 (Fig. 3A) ; under certain conditions, the loss of a specific cyclin can be compensated by the presence of others [33, 34] . Further investigation revealed that cyclin D1 mRNA co-localizes with the caprin-1, G3BP1, and c-Myc mRNA-associated RNP complex (Fig. 2B) , as well as within polysomal fractions (Fig. 2D ). These results indicate that either cyclin D1 or D2 mRNAs might be sequestered by biotinylated tylophorine (Fig. 2B & 2D ) or associated with a tylophorine-targeted RNP complex in tylophorine-treated HONE-1 cells (Fig. 2D ). The co-immunoprecipitation of caprin-1 with \u03b1-actinin-4, G3BP1, and p-S6 from the HONE-1 cell lysate in the presence of biotinylated tylophorine was detected by immunoblot analyses with the indicated antibodies. B. Biotinylated tylophorine pulled down the mRNAs for c-Myc and cyclins D1 and D2 from the HONE-1 cell lysate as detected by RT-PCR with the indicated primer pairs. C. Purified recombinant caprin-1 protein physically associates with biotinylated tylophorine. Human caprin-1 was transiently expressed in HEK-293 cells, affinity-purified as described in the Methods section, and applied to a pull-down experiment with biotinylated tylophorine. The protein was subsequently detected by immunoblot analysis using an antibody against human caprin-1. D. Polysome profile analysis (by sucrose gradient sedimentation) and protein (by western, upper panel) and RNA (by qRT-PCR, lower panel) analyses of sucrose gradient fractions for the co-localization of caprin-1, G3BP1, c-Myc mRNA, cyclin D1 mRNA, and cyclin D2 mRNA in the tylophorine-induced RNP complex from the lysates of HONE-1 cells treated with either with tylophorine (2 \u00b5M) ( We examined the effect of tylophorine on the expression of c-Myc and cyclins D1/D2 based on the above pull-down results. Tylophorine treatment increased the mRNA levels of c-Myc and cyclin D1 in both HONE-1 and MCF7 cells. Cyclin D2 mRNA levels were increased only in HONE-1 cells upon tylophorine treatment since cyclin D2 mRNA level was undetectable in MCF7 cells as reported [30] [31] [32] , regardless of tylophorine treatment ( Fig. 3A) . However, c-Myc and cyclin D1 protein levels were diminished in HONE-1, MCF7, or NUGC-3 cells upon tylophorine treatment (Fig. 3B ). In addition, and as expected, cyclin D2 protein levels were decreased in tylophorine treated HONE-1 and NUGC-3 but no cyclin D2 were detectable in MCF7 cells (Fig. 3B ). Furthermore, we used TAMRA to label the newly synthesized protein after tylophorine treatment and followed by immunoprecipitation and western blot to detect the proteins of interest. We found that the de novo protein syntheses of c-Myc and cyclinD1/D2 were diminished upon tylophorine treatment but not that of G3BP1 protein (Fig. 3C ). When HONE-1 cells were depleted with caprin-1 by siRNA, the resultant cells became more A. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analyses of the effect of tylophorine on the mRNA levels of c-Myc, cyclin D1, and cyclin D2. The relative expression levels of each mRNA were normalized with their respective internal loading control GAPDH. B. Immunoblot analyses of the effects of tylophorine on protein expressions related to the caprin-1-associated RNP complex and their common downstream target pRb. The carcinoma cells were treated with tylophorine (2 \u00b5M) for 24 h prior to semi-quantitative RT-PCR or western blotting analyses with the indicated gene primer pairs or antibodies. C. Tylophorine repressed the de novo protein syntheses of c-Myc and cyclins D1/D2. TAMRAlabeled newly synthesized proteins from tylophorine treated HONE-1 cells were immunoprecipitated with specific antibody as indicated and then detected by western blotting with indicated antibody. D. Depletion of caprin-1 increased carcinoma cells' resistance to tylophorine or DBQ 33b treatments. HONE-1 cells were transfected with control shRNA or CAPRIN1 shRNA plasmids respectively, and then selected with puromycin. The resultant cells were analyzed by western blotting for validation of caprin-1 depletion before subjected to measurement of cell growth IC 50 values by tylophorine or DBQ 33b. A 2-tailed unpaired Student's t test was used to evaluate the p-value between two groups. E & F. The effect of caprin-1 depletion on the association of tylophorine targeted RNP complex. Caprin-1 depleted HONE-1 lysates described in D were subjected to pull-down assays with biotinylated tylophorine or biotin-X-SSE. Immunoblot (E) and Semi-RT-qPCR analyses (F) were used to detect the protein and mRNA components in the tylophorine-associated RNP complex. The sequences of the gene primer pairs used are listed in Supplemental Table 3 . BT, biotinylated tylophorine. The results shown are representative of 3 independent experiments. *, p<0.05.",

Strikingly, the expression of cyclins D1/D2 was not restored by ectopic overexpression of c-Myc (Fig. 4B) , even though cyclins D1/D2 are downstream target genes of c-Myc signaling [36, 37] . The resulting hyperphosphorylation of pRb can be, at least in part, attributed to increased levels of cyclin B1 [38] (Fig. 4B) , a c-Myc target and another upstream effector of pRb, or feedback from upregulated cyclin A2, as ectopic overexpression of cyclin A2 was also able to partially resume the hyperphosphorylation of pRb (Fig. 4C) . These results further emphasize that even ectopically expressed c-Myc can upregulate or stabilize the transcription of cyclins D1 and D2, but their mRNA is subject to sequestration by tylophorine in the caprin-1 and c-Myc mRNA-associated RNP complex, thereby blocking their translation. Therefore, ectopically expressed c-Myc resumed the hyperphosphorylation of pRb through a pathway independent of cyclins D1/D2.",

We observed the sustained blockade of c-Myc protein expression in each of the individual carcinoma cell lines upon treatment with tylophorine or its potent derivative DBQ 33b [23] but not in the fibroblast cell lines. c-Myc protein expression levels were reduced to 1-33% (Fig.  6A) , whereas c-Myc mRNA levels were increased by 1.5-4.5-fold (Figs. 3A, 6B, & 6C) . We also performed gene expression profiling and analysis of the c-Myc downstream pathways that were affected by tylophorine or DBQ 33b (Fig. 6B) , as well as validation by RT-qPCR (Fig. 6C ). Both compounds increased the expression of c-Myc mRNA by ~2-4-fold; the mRNA levels of genes that were upregulated by c-Myc were decreased (e.g., cyclin A2, cyclin B1, SERBP1, PRDX3, and POLR3G), and the mRNA levels of genes that were downregulated by c-Myc increased (e.g., GADD45A, and THBS1) ( Fig.  6B and 6C) . These results are consistent with the above observation that increased c-Myc mRNA levels and decreased c-Myc protein levels occurred in tylophorinetreated cells, which led to negative regulation of c-Myc effector pathways. The genes, whose expression was upregulated or downregulated by tylophorine and DBQ 33b, associated with the function of c-Myc in carcinogenesis are shown in Figure 6D .",

RNPs are ribonucleoproteins in which RNA and protein molecules, such as the ribosome, the enzyme telomerase, hnRNP, small nuclear RNPs (snRNPs), and viral RNP complexes, interact. RNP complexes exhibit multiple roles, dynamic conformations, and chemical instability. Therefore, targeting RNPs for the discovery or development of therapeutic agents remains a challenge. However, several antiviral agents have been reported to target viral RNP complexes with high potency and exhibit significant potential for development into therapeutic drugs [43] [44] [45] . To the best of our knowledge, no anti-cancer agent targeting an RNP complex has been reported. We are the first to report that targeting an RNP complex (i.e., targeting the caprin-1 and c-Myc mRNAcontaining RNP complex by tylophorine compounds) in carcinoma cells can efficiently elicit anti-cancer activity.",

Using TAMRA to label the newly synthesized protein by tylophorine treatment, we clearly demonstrated that tylophorine repressed the protein expression of c-Myc and cyclins D1/D2 (Fig. 3C) . These results further firm that tylophorine sequestered the RNP containing caprin-1 and c-Myc mRNA in the polysomal fractions (Fig. 2D ) and blocked the corresponding mRNAs' translation. However, the detailed underlying mechanisms must be carefully addressed and further investigated. Our results suggest that caprin-1 is highly associated with the transport of c-Myc, cyclin D1, and cyclin D2 mRNAs for translation. Thus, the abrogation of this specific biological function of caprin-1 results in the induction of cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase [47] .",

Thus, it is conceivable that the inhibition of c-Myc significantly contributes to the broad-spectrum anti-cancer activity of tylophorine compounds against drug-resistant carcinoma cells.

Tylophorine enhances the c-Jun downregulation of the cyclin A2 promoter activity and results in carcinoma cells dominantly arrested at G1 phase for anti-cancer activity [25] . The ectopically overexpressed c-Myc did not affect the accumulation of c-Jun induced by tylophorine treatment but did increase the expression of cyclin A2 via hyperphosphorylated pRb (Supplemental Figure 2 and Fig. 4B ).
