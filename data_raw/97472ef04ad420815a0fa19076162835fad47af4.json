Different hypotheses have been proposed to explain the origin of CICs, including mutations in adult stem/ progenitor cells or the acquisition of stem-like characteristics in differentiated cells; however, studies have yielded conflicting identification for CICs and have little information for the origin to generate CICs. Part of the difficulty in identifying CICs may stem from the fact that the CICs studied have been largely derived from cancer cell lines or well-developed tumors. In previous studies, we have reported the enrichment of mouse pulmonary stem/progenitor cells (mPSCs) by using serumfree primary selection culture followed by FACS isolation using the coxsackievirus/ adenovirus receptor (CAR) as the positive selection marker. Here, we demonstrated that overexpression of the pluripotent transcription factor Oct-4 is sufficient to induce CAR + /mPSCs transformation, which we name CAR + /mPSCs Oct-4_hi . These transformed cells possess cancer initiating and chemoresistance potential, as well as exhibiting remarkable expression of certain proangiogenic factors, including angiopoietins (ANGs) and VEGF, and enhanced angiogenic potential. Moreover, CAR + /mPSCs Oct-4_hi actively participated in tumor blood vessel formation and triggered a novel angiogenic mechanism, the angiopoietins/Tie2 signaling pathway. These study provide critical evidence supporting the possible origin to generate CICs, and help elucidate the pathways responsible for CICs-mediated blood vessel formation.",

However, these in vitro assays alone www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget are not enough to demonstrate that the identified cells are in fact CICs. Therefore, certain in vivo assays, such as limiting dilution transplantation experiments in animal models, are used to verify the results of in vitro assays [7, 8] . Unfortunately, studies have yielded conflicting identification of CICs in different types of cancer [2, 9] . The discrepancies in CICs identification may be due to the fact that the studied cells derived from different cancer cell lines or well-developed tumors [9, 10] .

In the K-ras G12D mutation conditional mice model, the stem cells located at the bronchioalveolar duct junction were examined as potential origin for adenocarcinoma after Cre/lox mediated activation [14] . Another study has demonstrated that Oct-4, mediated by IGF-IR signaling, can form a complex with \u03b2-catenin and Sox-2 to play a crucial role in the self-renewal and oncogenic potential of CICs in lung adenocarcinomas [15] . Additionally, co-expressing Oct-4 and Nanog in A549 lung adenocarcinoma cell line can control epithelial-mesenchymal transdifferentiation, regulate tumor initiating ability, and promote metastasis behavior [16] . Moreover, a high level of Oct-4 in nonsmall cell lung cancer patients has been correlated with metastasis and a lower survival rate [17] . Although these studies have demonstrated that certain pluripotent genes, Oct-4, Sox-2 and Nanog, are closely associated with tumor initiating properties, the connection between aberrant pluripotent genes expression and the generation of CICs is unclear and requires further clarification.",

In previous studies, we enriched for mouse pulmonary stem/progenitor cells (mPSCs) by using serum-free primary selection culture followed by FACS isolation using the coxsackievirus/adenovirus receptor (CAR) as the positive selection marker in the culture. These CAR + /mPSCs exhibited stem/progenitor properties, could differentiate into type-I pneumocytes, and possessed angiogenic potential [18, 19] . We hypothesized that CAR + /mPSCs could be transformed via the overexpression of Oct-4 and would then develop the typical CICs phenotype and we tested type-I pneumocytes derived from CAR + /mPSCs as well. In the experiments described here, we examined the characteristics of the transformed cells using in vitro assays, including cell cycle and telomerase activity analysis, sphere forming assay, detection of CD133 expression and ALDH activity, and chemoresistance assay. In addition, in vivo assays, including limiting dilution transplantation and tumor metastasis assays in SCID mice, were used to further study the characteristics of the transformed cells. Since the capacity to induce angiogenesis is another trait of CICs, endothelial tube formation assay and in ovo chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay were used to evaluate the angiogenic potential of the transformed cells. Our results help elucidate a possible origin and pathway for the generation of CICs, and help uncover how CICs may regulate blood vessel formation.",

Western blot analysis showed that Oct-4 was highly expressed in the C1, E9, and C7 clones; thus, we referred to them as CAR + /mPSCs Oct-4_hi clones (Supplementary Figure 3-i) . The Oct-4 expression levels of C1, E9, and C7 clones were similar to that of the mouse embryonic stem cell line (E14), whereas CAR + /mPSCs exhibited low Oct-4 expression (Supplementary Figure  3 -ii) . In primary cultures, CAR was specifically expressed in pulmonary stem/progenitor cells and served as the marker for CAR + /mPSCs isolation.

Cell cycle analysis showed significant G 1 -, S-and G 2 /M-phase shifting between CAR + /mPSCs and CAR + /mPSCs Oct-4_hi clones ( Figure 2A) .

In order to examine metastatic potential, 3 \u00d7 10 5 cells of the C1 clone were transplanted through the tail vein of mice and allowed to develop for 35 d. All mice injected with the C1 clone developed tumor nodules in the lung tissue ( Figure 4B ). H&E staining of lung tissue revealed extensive hemorrhage and nodule formation in the C1 clone transplants, while no abnormal lesions were detected after CAR + /mPSCs transplantation. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed to determine the survival rate following C1 clone or CAR + /mPSCs transplantation. The mean survival of mice injected with the C1 clone was significantly lower than that of mice transplanted with CAR + /mPSCs ( Figure 4C ).

            "text": "Different biomarkers for lung CICs have been proposed, including CD133 expression, ALDH activity, and chemoresistance. We utilized these biomarkers to further investigate CICs characteristics in CAR + / mPSCs Oct-4_hi clones. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that about 17.4-31.7% of cells were CD133 + among the C1, E9, and C7 clones, whereas CD133 + cells were nearly undetectable in CAR + /mPSCs ( Figure 5A ). ALDH activity was detected in 18.4-33.2% of the C1, E9, and C7 clones, whereas only 0.8% of CAR + /mPSCs exhibited ALDH activity ( Figure 5B ). As chemoresistance is also a critical biological feature of CICs, we evaluated the C1, E9, and C7 clones for chemoresistance to cisplatin or paclitaxel treatment. The cell viability is shown in Figure  5C . The IC 50 values of cisplatin were 26.4-34.7 \u03bcM for C1, E9, and C7 clones, indicating that CAR + /mPSCs Oct-4_ hi clones were about 2-3 fold more resistant to cisplatin compared to the A549 cells. For paclitaxel, the IC 50 were 43.2-47.2 nM in the C1, E9, and C7 clones, which are approximately 6 fold higher than that of the A549 cells ( Figure 5C -iii). It has been well documented that the protein survivin inhibits apoptosis and plays an important role in conferring chemoresistance to CICs [20] . We found that survivin expression was significantly higher in the Figure 3 : In vitro tumorigenic phenotype of CAR + /mPSCs Oct-4_hi . A. The soft agar colony formation assay. CAR + /mPSCs, CAR + / mPSCs Oct-4_hi C1, E9, and C7 clones and A549 were subjected to soft agar culture. Colonies were photographed and quantified after 2 wk. B. Sphere formation assay. CAR + /mPSCs, CAR + /mPSCs Oct-4_hi C1, E9, and C7 clones and A549 were subjected to a sphere formation assay. Secondary spheres (> 70 \u03bcm) were photographed and quantified after 10 d. (Scale bar, 100 \u03bcm.) C. Quantification of colonies and spheres. Data are presented as the mean \u00b1 SD. C1, E9, and C7 clones compared to CAR + /mPSCs ( Figure  5D -i). The C1, E9, and C7 clones also exhibited lower levels of cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved caspase-9 under cisplatin or paclitaxel treatment compared with CAR + / mPSCs ( Figure 5D -ii). Taken together, our results suggest that Oct-4 hyperexpression can drive the transformation of CAR + /mPSCs, conferring them with CICs-like properties.",

Therefore, we wanted to evaluate the potential for angiogenesis in the CAR + /mPSCs Oct-4_hi clones. We performed real-time PCR analysis and found that proangiogenic factors, including angiopoietin 1 (ANG1), angiopoietin 2 (ANG2), VEGFa, placental growth factor (PLGF), platelet-derived growth factor A (PDGFa), GCSF, VCAM-1, and bFGF, were expressed at significantly higher levels in the C1, E9, and C7 clones compared with CAR + /mPSCs ( Figure 6A ). To further confirm angiogenic potential, we used the C1, E9, and C7 clones and CAR + /mPSCs in a CAM assay.

In order to examine the correlation between CAR + / mPSCs Oct-4_hi clones and endothelial cells, we used realtime PCR to analyze gene expression of the angiogenesis associated receptors, VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) and Tie2. The receptor, Tie2, which is specifically expressed in endothelial cells, was significantly elevated in EGM cultured C1, E9, and C7 clones compared with CAR + / mPSCs, while gene expression of VEGFR2 showed no significant difference ( Figure 7A ). Western blot analysis confirmed the involvement of the ANGs/Tie2/GRB2/ ERK signaling pathway, showing that ANG1, ANG2, phospho-Tie2, GRB2, and phospho-ERK expression were significantly increased in EGM cultured C1, E9, and C7 clones relative to CAR + /mPSCs ( Figure 7B ).

In a study by Kim and colleagues, Oct-4 alone was sufficient to induce pluripotency in adult neural stem cells [22] . This result indicates that Oct-4 plays a critical role in maintaining cell pluripotency. However, Chiou et al. demonstrated that co-expressing Oct-4 and Nanog in A549 induced tumor initiating ability and promoted metastasis behavior of lung adenocarcinoma [16] . Beltran et al. indicated that overexpression of Oct-4 in different primary human epithelial breast cell preparations generated cell lines possessing tumor initiating and colonization capabilities, but the origin of these cells was not clearly identified [23] . Furthermore, Hochedlinger et al. reported that ectopic Oct-4 expression caused intestinal epithelial dysplasia. The dysplastic lesions showed expansion of progenitor cells and required continuous Oct-4 expression [24] . Despite these associations, the precise role of Oct-4 in cell transformation remains unclear. In our study, we found that CAR + /mPSCs express low levels of Oct-4, Figure 7 : ANGs/Tie2 signaling analysis in EGM cultured CAR + /mPSCs Oct-4_hi . A. Real-time PCR analyzed the gene expression of angiogenesis associated receptor, including VEGFR2 and Tie2, in EGM cultured CAR + /mPSCs Oct-4_hi C1, E9, and C7 clones and CAR + / mPSCs. Data are presented as the mean \u00b1 SD. ** P < 0.01 compared with CAR + /mPSCs. B. Western blot analyzed the ANGs/Tie2 signaling activation in EGM cultured CAR + /mPSCs Oct-4_hi C1, E9, and C7 clones and CAR + /mPSCs, including Tie2, phospho-Tie2, ANG1, ANG2, GRB2, ERK and phospho-ERK expression. and overexpressing Oct-4 could transform CAR + /mPSCs such that they formed cobblestone-like colonies. In contrast, no colonies were observed when Oct-4 was also overexpressed in well-differentiated type-I pneumocytes derived from CAR + /mPSCs. Thus, compared with the study for the results of Oct-4 overexpression in adult neural stem cells [22] , we speculated that the formation of cobblestone-like colonies via Oct-4 overexpression is dependent on cell types and differentiation status.",

In phenotypic analysis, CAR + /mPSCs Oct-4_hi clones exhibited long-term proliferation behavior and significant shift in the cell cycle for G 1 -, S-and G 2 /Mphase indicated cell cycle progression. We also found that telomerase activity and had continuous expression in the CAR + /mPSCs Oct-4_hi clones. Telomerase activity is considered to confer cell cycle progression and immortal growth properties [11] . Taken together, our results demonstrated that CAR + /mPSCs Oct-4_hi clones exhibited a general phenotype of immortalized cell properties and may maintain the pluripotency. To evaluate the pluripotency of the clones, an in vivo teratoma formation assay, the standard tool for monitoring pluripotency, was employed [22] . Histological analysis of tissues derived from CAR + /mPSCs Oct-4_hi clones showed no differentiation of the three germ layers. H&E staining of the tissues indicated malignant phenotypic characteristics, and immunohistological examination revealed heterogeneous phenotypes. Expression of oncogenes including phospho-Src, phospho-\u03b2-catenin, c-myc, and cyclin D1 were also detected in the tumor-like tissues, as were diagnostic markers for lung adenocarcinoma, such as TTF1, NAPSA, CK7, and CK-HMW [25, 26] . This result indicated that CAR + /mPSCs Oct-4_hi clones induced tumor formation and derived heterogeneous tumor cell populations rather than teratoma formation. CICs are defined by their self-renewal and pluripotency capacities, which contribute to cancer initiation, progression, metastasis, recurrence, and chemoresistance [2] . Assays that measure anchorageindependent growth and sphere formation ability are generally used to evaluate the self-renewal and differentiation capacities of CICs [4, 7] . Our results show that CAR + /mPSCs Oct-4_hi clones possessed higher capacities for colony formation in soft agar and for sphere formation compared with the A549 cells. To demonstrate that CAR + /mPSCs Oct-4_hi clones share certain traits with CICs, in vivo assays, which are regarded as the gold standard, should be performed, including limiting dilution transplantation experiments in animal models [7, 8] . Here, we used the C1 clone to demonstrate that at low concentrations (1 \u00d7 10 2 cells), transplanted cells could generate tumors at a frequency of 4/6 within 28 d.",

Thus, CAR + /mPSCs Oct-4_hi showed remarkable tumor initiating potential. In addition, these cells displayed the ability for metastasis and malignancy. All mice injected with the C1 clone developed tumor nodules in the lung tissue, and histopathological staining of lung tissue revealed extensive hemorrhage. In addition to the in vitro and in vivo assays, other analytic protocols used for CICs identification in lung cancer, including CD133 expression, ALDH activity, and chemoresistance assays, were used to verify the characteristics of the clones [7] . Although the mechanism underlying transformation by Oct-4 hyperexpression remains elusive, our results show that Oct-4 hyperexpression can directly transform CAR + / mPSCs with CICs-like properties as well as CD133 expression, higher ALDH activity, and cisplatin and paclitaxel resistance. Additionally, in our study, CAR + / mPSCs Oct-4_hi also exhibited marked survivin expression and down regulated caspase-3 and -9 expression. It has been reported that survivin functions as a key regulator of mitosis and apoptosis inhibition and acts as an inhibitor of caspase-9 [20] . Li et al. reported that Oct-4 positively regulates survivin expression to promote cancer cell proliferation in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma [27] . We speculate that the promotion of cell proliferation and attenuated apoptosis may be critical to Oct-4 hyperexpression induced transformation and may be mediated via survivin.",

            "text": "It is well known that the growth, proliferation, and metastasis of cancer cells are highly dependent on angiogenesis and anti-angiogenic therapy is considered a promising strategy for cancer treatment [11] . The VEGF signaling pathway is the target of three major anti-angiogenic drugs approved for clinical use [28] . However, recent studies have revealed that some endothelial cells derived from tumor cells are resistant to anti-VEGF therapy [29] [30] [31] . Recent studies have reported that CICs may be a crucial source for key proangiogenic factors in cancers, exhibiting potent angiogenic capacities in glioma and ovarian cancers [32, 33] . In addition, Soda et al. demonstrated that the tumor initiating cells of glioblastomas presented the transdifferentiation potential for generation of tumorderived vascular endothelial cells through hypoxia stimulation [29] . In our previous study, CAR + /mPSCs were demonstrated to express proangiogenic factors, such as VEGF and bFGF, and induced tube formation of endothelial cells both in vitro and in vivo [19] . In this study, we found that CAR + /mPSCs Oct-4_hi clones expressed more abundant proangiogenic factors and induced angiogenesis in both the tube formation and the CAM assays. Surprisingly, we found that CAR + / mPSCs Oct-4_hi clones actively participated in tube formation, creating a mosaic-like pattern, in which the C1 clone cells integrated into the tube network of SVEC4-10 cells. In an early report, Chang and colleagues showed that both endothelial cells and tumor cells formed the luminal surface to presence of \"mosaic\" vessels [34] . Tomaso et al. demonstrated that there was mosaic structure for endothelium of vessels in human colon carcinoma xenografts in mice [35] . In animal model studies, C1 clone derived GFP expressing cells could also participate in forming the tumor blood vessels in C1-GFP clone derived tumors. Flow cytometry analysis of C1-GFP clone derived tumors revealed that 12-18% of CD31 + endothelial cells also expressed GFP, indicating that a population of CD31 + cells was derived from the C1-GFP clone. Collectively, the results indicated that CAR + /mPSCs Oct-4_hi exhibited remarkable angiogenic potentials and actively participated in tumor angiogenesis. In order to speculate the mechanism for CAR + /mPSCs Oct-4_hi clones to participate in angiogenesis, our study found that CAR + /mPSCs Oct-4_hi effectively switched on a novel angiogenic mechanism, the ANGs/Tie2 signaling pathway. ANGs are the ligand for endothelium-specific receptor tyrosine kinase Tie2 [36] . In cancer research, ANGs/Tie2 signaling plays critical roles in vascular development and maturation, which are crucial for tumor angiogenesis [36] . The underlying mechanism of ANGs/Tie2 activation in CAR + /mPSCs Oct-4_hi clones warrants further exploration. The tumor vasculature derived from cancer cells may be regulated differently than regular vasculature, offering potential new therapeutic targets.",

In this study, we demonstrated that Oct-4 hyperexpression is sufficient for CAR + /mPSCs to gain the hallmarks of cancer cells and acquisition of CICs-like properties. CAR + /mPSCs Oct-4_hi clones may be valuable cell models for further studies on the properties of CICs. Moreover, the easy manipulation of CAR + / mPSCs Oct-4_hi clones may enable large-scale cultures for the development of new therapeutic approaches targeting CICs. Although Oct-4 hyperexpression induced transformation of CAR + /mPSCs has been well documented, the identification of naturally occurring environmental factors that can induce Oct-4 expression warrants additional research. Recent studies have reported that a hypoxic microenvironment induced Oct-4 expression through HIF2\u03b1 activation and deregulation [37] . Notably, CAR + /mPSCs Oct-4_hi actively participated in tumor angiogenesis and activated the ANGs/Tie2 signaling pathway. These findings provide novel insight regarding the origin of CICs and offer new strategies for anti-angiogenic therapy in lung cancer.",
