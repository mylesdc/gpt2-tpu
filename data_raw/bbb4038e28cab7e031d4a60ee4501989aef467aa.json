Sixty-three transplantations were performed in 60 patients. Twenty-eight patients were diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 27 patients were diagnosed with acute myelogenous leukemia, and in eight other hematological malignancies were diagnosed. Twenty-three were in first complete remission (CR), 20 in second CR, 20 beyond second CR. Four patients developed graft failure. Median time to neutrophil and platelet recovery was 14 (range 9-25) and 10 days (range 7-30), respectively. The probability of non-relapse mortality (NRM) by day +100 after transplantation was 10 \u00b1 4%. With a median follow-up of 28 months, the probability of relapse was 32 \u00b1 6% and disease-free survival was 52 \u00b1 6%. Immune reconstitution was leaded by NK cells. As such, a high CD56 dim/ CD56 bright NK cell ratio early after transplantation was associated with better disease-free survival (DFS) (\u22653.5; 77 \u00b1 8% vs. <3.5; 28 \u00b1 5%; p = 0.001) due to lower relapse incidence (\u22653.5; 15 \u00b1 7% vs. <3.5; 37 \u00b1 9%; p = 0.04). T-cell reconstitution was delayed and associated with severe infections after transplant. Viral reactivation/disease and presence of venooclusive disease of liver in the non-caucasian population had a significant impact on NRM. \u03b1\u03b2 + T-cell receptor/CD19 + cell-depleted haploidentical transplant is associated with good outcomes especially in patients in",

            "text": "Nowadays, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is considered a curative option for pediatric patients with high-risk leukemia at diagnosis or after relapse. However, an important proportion of those patients lack a suitable human leucocyte antigen (HLA) match donor or delay for donor availability may be unacceptable (1) . For patients needing an allogeneic transplant in a timely manner, the use of haploidentical relative donors has been considered a suitable approach (2, 3) . Donor T-cells in the graft facilitate T-cell reconstitution but they are also responsible for graft-vs.-host disease (GvHD). Currently, several haploidentical transplant platforms using \"ex-vivo\" T-cell depletion (TCD) without using post-transplant GvHD pharmacological prophylaxis have gained clinical relevance (4, 5) .",

Acid citrate dextrose (ACD-A) was used as an anticoagulant with a ratio of 14:1. Leukapheresis products were also analyzed for expression of the CD34 + antigen as previously reported (8) .

Nowadays, several haploidentical transplant platforms have gained clinical relevance using \"ex-vivo\" T-cell depletion (TCD) (19) . In TCD haploidentical setting, different techniques of graft manipulation have been developed over last 15 years to avoid or minimize undesirable GvHD (19) (20) (21) . These techniques have evolved from the initial almost total T and B cells depletion by means of CD34 + isolation and CD3 + /CD19 + depletion to more recently graft manipulation techniques such as \u03b1\u03b2 + TCR/CD19 + or CD45RA + depletions that resulted in partial TCD maintaining NK cells in an attempt to improve immune reconstitution following transplantation (22, 23) . An approach to circumvent delayed immune recovery represented by a more sophisticated method of graft manipulation that has been recently developed and implemented is based on selective depletion of \u03b1\u03b2 + T-cells and B-cells (10) . This strategy allows not only the infusion of donor hematopoietic stem cells, but also committed hematopoietic progenitors, mature NK cells, and \u03b3\u03b4 + T-cells.",

Children with acute leukemia receiving haploidentical transplant using \u03b1\u03b2 + T-cell/B-cell depletion had a relatively lower risk for acute and chronic GVHD even than those transplanted from an unrelated donor. However, major challenges were relapsing disease and delayed immune reconstitution leading infectious morbidity and mortality (11) . So, immune reconstitution studies and risk factors for transplant outcome analysis using this TCD haploidentical platform are needed.

First, engraftment kinetics were fast, probably due to the large number of infused progenitors (Tables 1, 2) , as has been recently published (8, 10, 11, 24) . As other authors (10, 20, 21) have noted, grafts so depleted, contain high numbers of (8) with other previous graft manipulation procedures using the same conditioning regimen and very similar to other published studies using TBI-based conditioning with or without serotherapy as part of preparatory regimen. Non-radiationbased preparative regimens have be used in pediatric patients with high-risk acute leukemia and busulfan-based myeloablative conditioning regimens have been reported safe and effective in hematopoietic transplantation (11) . An important observation in this study was the fact that the conditioning regimen was welltolerated (Table 3) , with a low incidence of severe complications, similar to that of recently published in adults (25) and children (7) (8) (9) . However, we have observed a high incidence of severe VOD/SOS in non-Caucasian population not previously observed and reported. This complication was associated with high mortality in the mentioned population. Non-Caucasian (mainly white Hispanic) patients are being increasingly included in the transplant program at our institution. It is possible that there is an interethnic variability in genetic polymorphisms frequencies for metabolizing enzymes that probably influence toxicity incidence such as VOD/SOS. Based in our findings, ethnicity should be considered as potential risk factor for further prospective VOD/SOS studies. The incidence of ES is remarkable ( Table 3) . ES is an inflammatory condition that occurs after HSCT and it is characterized by a non-infectious fever and skin rash. We have previously reported (8) this complication in pediatric haploidentical transplantation setting, using other TCD platform. ES has been considered as a herald of GvHD and both complications might be related with not using serotherapy as part of preparatory regimen. However, this complication had no impact on clinical outcomes in our series (8) .",

Immune reconstitution after allogeneic transplantation depends on multiple factors such as stem cell source and dose (26) , graft manipulation procedure (6-9), donor age (13), conditioning regimen, and post-transplant immunosuppression used. We (7, 8) and others (6, 24, 26) previously reported that immune reconstitution in children receiving TCD haploidentical transplant was characterized by early and fast NK-cell recovery constituting major lymphocyte subpopulation in the early phase following transplantation. NK-cells in the graft and fast NK-cell recovery have been considered of importance in allogeneic transplant especially on haploidentical transplant. After conditioning, blood high level of interleukin-15 provides a favorable environment not only for mature donor NK-cell infused but also for NK-cells maturing from engrafted HSCs (27) . NK-cell reconstitution and its function following haploidentical transplant is clearly influenced by GvHD prophylaxis, especially by post-cyclophosphamide that eliminate most mature donor NK cells including alloreactive NK cells as it has been recently published (27) .",

However, a similar analysis has not been published in the TCD haploidentical setting. A recent study in pediatric patients, receiving \u03b1\u03b2 + T-cell depletion haploidentical transplant, showed an overshooting NK cell recovery on day +14 comparable to their donor level (29) . Despite a rapid expansion of CD56 bright NK cell subset, CD56 dim NK cells were predominant during the study time period (29) . However, they did not report any correlation between CD56 dim or CD56 bright recovery and relapse incidence. Our previous data indicate that the number of total NK cells early after transplantation was a strong determinant of GvL effect (8) .

NK cells have a powerful activity against virus transformed cells and cancers cells specially AML cells (30, 31) . This activity against cancer cells is mainly supported by CD56 dim cytotoxic activity (32) (33) (34) . CD56 bright population has a different cytokine profile resulting in lower cytotoxicity against cancer cells. So, the higher CD56 dim/ CD56 bright NK cell ratio might result in more cytotoxicity exerted by CD56 dim subset and in lower risk of relapse. Unfortunately, we do not have data on cytotoxicity in our series to support this explanation. Alternatively, NK cells could act as a boost for T-cell activation that might increase the T-cell based GvL effect. However, our data clearly shows that T-cell recovery is delayed for a longer period of time following transplant especially \u03b1\u03b2 + T-cells.",
