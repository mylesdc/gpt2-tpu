The program includes seven Proteomics Research Centers, generating diverse types of pathogen-host data, including mass spectrometry, microarray transcriptional profiles, protein interactions, protein structures and biological reagents. The Biodefense Resource Center (www.proteomicsresource.org) has developed a bioinformatics framework, employing a protein-centric approach to integrate and support mining and analysis of the large and heterogeneous data. Underlying this approach is a data warehouse with comprehensive protein + gene identifier and name mappings and annotations extracted from over 100 molecular databases. Value-added annotations are provided for key proteins from experimental findings using controlled vocabulary. The availability of pathogen and host omics data in an integrated framework allows global analysis of the data and comparisons across different experiments and organisms, as illustrated in several case studies presented here. (1) The identification of a hypothetical protein with differential gene and protein expressions in two host systems (mouse macrophage and human HeLa cells) infected by different bacterial (Bacillus anthracis and Salmonella typhimurium) and viral (orthopox) pathogens suggesting that this protein can be prioritized for additional analysis and functional characterization. (2) The analysis of a vaccinia-human protein interaction network supplemented with protein accumulation levels led to the identification of human Keratin, type II cytoskeletal 4 protein as a potential therapeutic target. (3) Comparison of complete genomes from pathogenic variants coupled with experimental information on complete proteomes allowed the identification and prioritization of ten potential diagnostic targets from Bacillus anthracis. The integrative analysis across data sets from multiple centers can reveal potential functional significance and hidden relationships between pathogen and host proteins, thereby providing a systems approach to basic understanding of pathogenicity and target identification.",

Having most of this information accessible in one place can facilitate knowledge discovery and modeling of biological systems. Like many problems in data integration, it is easy to know the general outline of what we want, but often much harder to implement and navigate the information, especially if the original data crosses disciplinary, laboratory and institutional boundaries. Here we describe in detail a protein-centric approach for systems integration of such a large and heterogeneous set of data from the NIAID Biodefense Proteomics program, and present scientific case studies to illustrate its application to facilitate the basic understanding of pathogen-host interactions and for the identification of potential candidates for therapeutic or diagnostic targets. Several scientific use cases are presented that illustrate how one can search varied experimental data from different laboratories and even ones researching different infectious organism and their hosts to make potentially useful connections that could lead to new hypotheses and discoveries.",

In practice a protein-centric approach works well as proteins occupy a middle ground molecularly between gene and transcript information and higher levels of molecular and cellular structure and organization.

Examples of database identifiers used include Genbank/EMBL/DDBJ accessions and locus tags, UniGene accessions, RefSeq accessions, IPI accessions, NCBI gi numbers and IDs unique to a sequencing center or organism-specific database. The first step was to map all experimental results to a common representation of a protein. This was achieved by mapping all protein and gene IDs and names to iProClass proteins. The majority of the mapping using IDs from public resources was done using mapping services and tables provide on the Protein Information Resource (PIR) web site (http:// proteininformationresource.org/pirwww/search/idmapping.shtml) and FTP site (ftp://ftp.pir.georgetown.edu/databases/iproclass/).

            "text": "Mapping difficulties fell into 4 categories: 1) One-to-many mappings: a common problem, especially when eukaryotic host proteins derived from alternate splicing or viral polyproteins are involved. UniProtKB usually merges information on alternate splice forms or polyproteins, which helped minimize this problem for our purposes, but in cases where multiple mappings exist, we selected as most informative the entry in the manually reviewed UniProtKB/ SwissProt section; if no SwissProt entry was found, the longer sequence in UniProtKB/TrEMBL section was selected. Users could always find the alternate mappings via the iProClass related sequences link on the MPD entry page to precompiled BLAST results on all iProClass sequences. 2) Retired sequences: genomic sequences from databases such as RefSeq, IPI, or UniGene are not static and, as information changes, some gene predictions and translations are retired with each new build. Retired sequences often required manual mapping by a curator to match original gene or peptide results to current protein sequences. Primarily UniParc (UniProt sequence archive) [15] was used for this purpose. 3) Protein sequences not available in iProClass or any public repository: this occurred most often with Toxoplasma gondii whose genome sequencing was still in progress and stable builds were not yet available. However, the problem also occurred in some well-characterized organisms like Vibrio cholera and Bacillus anthracis. Several data sets contained information on annotated but not translated pseudogenes. In the case of Vibrio cholera, 21 of 48 pseudogenes cloned and sequenced by the Harvard Institute of Proteomics did not contain the annotated point mutation or frame shift and appeared to produce full-length proteins [16] . In the case of Bacillus anthracis, microarrays containing probes for 82 of 192 annotated pseudogenes also showed significant changes in RNA expression in response to infection or other treatments [17, 18, 19] . In these cases, new database entries were created in the MPD to house the results. 4) Alternate species or strain representations: several experimental data sets reported sequence identifiers for strains or variants other than the one used in the experimental sample. This is not an uncommon situation as the genetically most characterized variant is often an attenuated laboratory strain while the more virulent strains are either not yet sequenced or the sequence is of lower quality. Often microarray chips or mass spectrometry databases are designed using the best available sequence from the research strain, yet then use RNA and protein samples from another similar virulent strain. The question here was what organism strain to map to and represent on our website: the strain the RNA or protein the sample came from, or alternatively, the strain that matched the identifier and sequence used in the research to detect the RNA or protein. For the MPD we chose to map to the sequence identifier reported in the data files and related publications, with the additional virulent strain information noted in the results summary.",

To do otherwise would confuse users not familiar with the technology and how results are filtered. Results that fell below the significance threshold used by the research center were made available via download of data sets at the FTP site. 2) ''RAW'' unprocessed machine specific data would be stored by the PRC and available on request. 3) To facilitate and simplify searches across laboratories and data types, we omitted most data type or analysis specific numerical values and statistics from the general MPD search and display. These numerical values are usually platform, laboratory and method dependent and cannot easily be used to compare across datasets so including them might be confusing to users. Instead, we focused on providing simple, yet powerful, queries of experimental summaries where a user can query if a gene/protein was presented in the results and, in some cases, if it showed a reported increase or decrease in expression or accumulation based on the PRC's criteria. Once a set of proteins of interest is identified, a user can then drill down to view the specific experimental values and methods employed to generate the particular dataset. Links to details in the publications are provided and full data are available via FTP. Since all protein attributes are included as search options, one can query beyond simply protein names, accessions or project data and search pathways, protein families, Gene Ontology (GO) terms, database cross-references and many other attributes, providing many powerful options to the users.",

In Figure 4 we illustrate this by selecting one protein, K1033_MOUSE, an uncharacterized protein seen in three datasets from infected mouse macrophages. Using the UniRef90 cluster ID [22] to query for all proteins with at least 90% identity and no gaps, we find the human homolog K1033_HUMAN was detected in HeLa cells infected with vaccinia and monkypox virus. If we do a batch retrieval using Uniref90 IDs from all 16 original mouse proteins, we find 12 human homologs were also detected in studies of orthopox infection (not shown). The identification of a hypothetical protein with differential gene and protein expressions in two host systems (mouse macrophage and HeLa cells) infected by different bacterial (Bacillus anthracis and Salmonella typhimurium) and viral (orthopox) pathogens suggest that this protein should be prioritized for additional analysis and functional characterization. [23, 24, 25] . Although different laboratories use different sample preparation, detection and analysis techniques making some direct comparisons difficult, having the data together in one place allows queries and comparisons between proteins and gene sets to be combined and additional analysis undertaken. In this example, data from different labs and data types are combined for further analysis. A query of the MPD on data type = ''interaction'' AND organism name = ''virus'' finds 33 vaccinia virus proteins with interactions with human proteins determined by Myriad Genetics. Browsing the results display shows that 25 of the proteins were also seen in mass spec work published by PNNL [26] . By combining the two experimental data sets Experiment = ''MYRIAD_05'' AND ''PNNL_MS_09'', we find 83 virus and human proteins with both mass spec and interaction data from each laboratory. Further investigation into the experimental details shows that a protein interaction network was determined by Myriad Genetics using a yeast-two hybrid assay to screen viral bait proteins against a library of human prey proteins cloned from different tissues. The mass spec data from PNNL was obtained from viral preparations isolated from infected human HeLa cells. The work from PNNL contained quantitative information in the form of spectral counts and Accurate Mass Tag [27] intensities, downloadable from the project FTP site. We combined all the vaccinia plus human interaction data with peptide counts for each protein and visualized the results using Cytoscape [28, 29] . The complete network of results is shown in Figure 5A .",

Relatively little has yet been done for inter-species pathogen-host networks. Several common factors that have proved useful in other studies are 1) evaluating network hubs with many interactions and 2) using correlations between interacting pairs with similar gene expression patterns. For this small interactome, we looked for relatively abundant proteins associated with multiple interactions. We identified a single human protein interacting with three viral proteins, three being the largest number of viral interactions seen with a single host protein in this data set. The interactions are shown in Figure 5B . The host protein Keratin, type II cytoskeletal 4 (P19013) interacts with three viral proteins (P11258 -14 kDa fusion protein, A27L; Q805H7 -Chemokine-binding protein C23/B29; P17362 -Protein C6L). The 14 kDa fusion protein A27L is the most abundant protein seen in this data set and participates in virus penetration at during cell fusion [36, 37] . A27L facilitates initial attachment to cells by binding to glycosaminoglycans [38] . A27L is found in all orthopoxviruses and has no cellular or entomopoxvirus homologs. Additional viral proteins involved in attachment (D8L, H3L) [39, 40] and fusion (F9L, I2L) [41, 42] were not observed. The Chemokine-binding protein C23L belongs to a family of poxvirus chemokine-binding proteins that mimic the chemokine response and prevent activation and chemotaxis of leukocytes [43, 44] . Protein C6L belongs to a family of poxvirus paralogs that may function as toll-like receptor inhibitors based on homology to A52R [45, 46, 47] . Thus, this protein may modulate Toll/IL-1R signaling, resulting in a diminished host immune response and enhancing viral survival.",

Currently over 700 pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria have been completely sequenced. The availability of sequence data allows identification of proteins that are unique at different taxonomic levels, thus providing a means to begin to distinguish pathogenic from non-pathogenic species. However, if the initial screening depends on sequence data alone, the list of potential targets for laboratory validation can be relatively long; by supplementing sequence results with experimental data one can prioritize the target list for validation in the laboratory. We used such an approach by computationally screening potential targets using CUPID [54] , PRC data and other computational means to produce a list of potential targets.",

These ''core unique'' proteins have related sequences in all selected organisms (in this case all available strains of Bacillus anthracis) but not in other related organisms. An initial total of 327 proteins unique to the Bacillus anthracis proteome were identified using the CUPID and UniProtKB version 13.0. (Bacillus anthracis strain Ames isolate Porton, Bacillus anthracis strain Ames ancestor, Bacillus anthracis strain Sterne were compared to twelve other genomes in the Bacillus genus). The two closest relatives of Bacillus anthracis as determined by CUPID are Bacillus thuringiensis and Bacillus cereus. The species most closely related to the selected organism is based on the best BLAST hits of its entire proteome [54] .

The 100 residue cutoff was used to ensure that the target list consisted of proteins that are real (short proteins might not be real) and are unique, as identification of homologs for short proteins is not trivial [55] . This resulted in a list of 21 ''core unique'' proteins in the pathogenic strains. It is possible that the proteins found may have homologs in other organisms which were undetected by CUPID because the genes were not annotated as open reading frames To confirm their uniqueness, the 21 proteins were screened for significant regions of similarity at the DNA level (either pseudogenes or unannotated genes) using tBLASTn against the NCBI nr database. Using NCBI's nr which is produced independently of similar, but not identical, sources as iProClass also helps assure no sequences were missing from our warehouse. This additional analysis resulted in a total of 10 Bacillus anthracis specific proteins proposed as high-quality targets for development of diagnostic probes. We then supplemented this information with data from the PRC projects and Master Protein Directory to create a matrix of information ( Figure 6 ). Six of the ten targets have data from the University of Michigan PRC showing that they were differentially expressed in published microarray experiments. Nine of the ten are available as clones produced by the Harvard Institute of Proteomics. A search of all the microarray data from the University of Michigan (using http://proteinbank.vbi.vt.edu/ ProteinBank/p/search/searchproteins.dll) showed that the four proteins not differentially expressed (listed as clones only in Figure 6 ) were still constitutively expressed well above background in all studies (not shown).

            "text": "The lightweight data warehouse approach used for the MPD proved useful in practice, especially with large datasets as its simple design and schema allows greater flexibility to add new data types and to modify search and analysis capabilities. Similar lightweight approaches and schemas designed to optimize queries have been shown useful in integration of genomic data [63, 64] . The main drawback of this approach is that the warehouse does not contain all the data. However, this is rarely a problem if the data are available in some other data resource optimized for that particular data type and if some upfront analysis of the user's needs for query and analysis options is performed. For example, our use case analysis suggested that for microarray and mass spectrometry data, individual raw intensities, machine-specific parameters and most calculated numerical values were not required for general queries and analysis across the combined data as these values were only comparable between the particular analysis performed in one lab. As a result, most numerical values were not included in the MPD for the default search but are accessible for display via hyperlinks to our Protein Data Center or FTP site. However, if a new attribute appear or users request searches on a particular value omitted from the warehouse, adding it is a relatively simple matter of adding new data columns. For instance, in example II our combination and analysis of mass spectrometry and protein interaction data, we could include peptide counts directly in the MPD for immediate download instead of retrieving them from the ftp files. Of course, no one approach can be perfect, as in biology and research there always seems to be exceptions and new data and multiple approaches need to be accommodated.",

However the current standards do not necessarily guarantee integration as the problems of reconciling gene and protein identifiers as well as differences in experimental methodology remain. We investigated and employed a few common data standards and ontologies in developing the Biodefense Proteomics Resource. We provided some data using mzData [65] and MAGE-ML [66] but also provided original dataspecific text files for download. We found that several ontologies to describe experimental methods were useful but incomplete and focused on higher eukaryotes and thus did not yet contain terms needed for microbial pathogens. Most useful was the Gene Ontology [67] which has been widely adopted to annotate and classify large scale results and can be used for searching and classification in the MPD.",

We illustrated with three examples how potential therapeutic and diagnostic targets can be identified from integrated data applying relatively simple and established tools and techniques. We continue to focus on data integration to allow biologists to find relevant data sets for further detailed analysis using the approaches and tools of their choice. In general the analysis of diverse omics data is an area of active research and a number of useful tools are under active development including cytoscape [28] , bioconductor [68] and galaxy [69] . In the future a more seamless integration between data repositories and analysis tools such as these would be the most useful approach to add additional analysis options for integrated data.
