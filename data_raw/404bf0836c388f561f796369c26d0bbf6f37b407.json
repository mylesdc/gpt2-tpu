However, the selection of siRNA-resistant viruses is a major concern in the use of RNAi as antiviral therapeutics. In this study, we conducted a lentiviral vector with a H1-short hairpin RNA (shRNA) expression cassette to deliver small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) into mammalian cells. Using this vector that also expresses enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) as surrogate marker, stable shRNAexpressing cell lines were successfully established and the inhibition efficiencies of rationally designed siRNAs targeting to conserved regions of influenza A virus genome were assessed. The results showed that a siRNA targeting influenza M2 gene (siM2) potently inhibited viral replication. The siM2 was not only effective for H1N1 virus but also for highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1. In addition to its M2 inhibition, the siM2 also inhibited NP mRNA accumulation and protein expression. A long term inhibition effect of the siM2 was demonstrated and the emergence of siRNA-resistant mutants in influenza quasispecies was not observed. Taken together, our study suggested that M2 gene might be an optimal RNAi target for antiviral therapy. These findings provide useful information for the development of RNAi-based prophylaxis and therapy for human influenza virus infection.",

In this process, the cellular complex Dicer cleaves a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecule to yield doublestranded duplexes 21-25 nucleotides in length. These siRNAs then guide the RNAi induced silencing complex (RISC) to cleave target mRNAs that share sequence identity with the siRNA [13, 14, 15] . Since it was first demonstrated that adding exogenous, synthetic siRNA molecules to mammalian cells can induce RNAi, there have been rapidly expanding efforts to develop RNAi therapies that induce the degradation of target messenger RNA (mRNA) involved in genetically inherited diseases or acquired disorders [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22] .",

The unique property of single-stranded RNA virus itself makes RNAi an attractive approach for development of anti-avian influenza therapeutics. The single-stranded viral genome, consisting of 8 segments contained at least 10 open reading frames (ORFs), serves as template for both viral genome replication and subgenomic mRNA synthesis. It has been reported that siRNAs respectively targeting to the viral genes of polymerase 1 (PB1), polymerase 2 (PB2), polymerase A (PA), nucleocapsid protein (NP), nonstructure proteins (NS1 and NS2), matrix proteins (M1 and M2), especially those specific for NP, PA and PB1, can potently inhibit replication of influenza A viruses [16, 23, 24, 25, 26] . However, it has been reported that HIV and HCV may develop siRNAresistant mutations quickly [17, 27, 28] , and therefore abrogated the further RNAi treatment. Thus, the evaluation of long term inhibition efficiency of designed siRNAs and screening of the emergence of siRNA resistance mutants are also an important research target.",

Such high suppressive effect is not only against H1N1 influenza A virus but also against a highly pathogenic H5N1 subtype. In the previous related studies, Ge and his co-workers [25] screened siRNAs targeting to 6 conserved genes of influenza A virus and showed that NP-1496 was the best since it can confer a more than 200-folds inhibition of H1N1 virus. Li et al [29] and Tomkines et al [23] further confirmed that NP-1496 provided high anti-H5N1 effect. We therefore included NP-1496 as a positive control in this study. Our results showed that siRNA M-950 exhibited similar (Fig. 1 ) or even slight higher (Fig. 2) inhibitory effect against IAV replication as compared to that of NP-1496. A recent report by Zhou et al [30] also showed that several siRNAs targeting NP and M genes exhibited effective inhibition against influenza A virus replication in cultured MDCK cells and in animal models. However, sequences of their reported siRNAs targeting M2 gene are completely different from the siRNA M2-950. Furthermore, chemically synthesized siRNAs or plasmid based shRNAs were always delivered by transfection in previous related studies, whereas we used a lentivirus system to deliver selected shRNAs. Although the integration property of lentivirus has abrogated it to be used in human, it is helpful for our study purpose to successfully establish stable cell lines persistently expressing siRNAs.",

Ge et al have reported a similar broad inhibition of siRNAs [25] . In their study, NP-1496 and PA-2087 provided a broad inhibition to H1N1 influenza virus, which not only abolished the accumulations of specific NP or PA mRNAs but also inhibited the accumulations of mRNAs for M, NS1, PB1, PB2 and PA or NP genes. A possible explanation is that some double stranded siRNAs may result in IFN responses or activate a RNA degradation pathway, e.g. Phosphorylated protein Kinase R (PKR) [9, 31, 32] . However, the mechanisms of this broad inhibition of some siRNAs are still not very clear yet. From the standpoint of viral target choice in RNAi based antiviral therapy, NP protein is required for elongation and antitermination of nascent cRNA and vRNA transcripts [33, 34] . Without newly synthesized NP, further viral transcription and replication are blocked. While, M2 plays a critical role in the assembly of infectious virus particles. Thus, the potent antiviral effect of siM2 may be attributed to its broad inhibitory effect.",

Establishment of shRNA expressing stable cell lines Lentiviral stocks were used to transduce MDCK cells. After 3 days of transduction, the medium containing the lentivirus was replaced with complete culture medium.

Sorting of live GFP positive cells was performed using a FACStar+ instrument (Becton Dickinson, USA) [38].
