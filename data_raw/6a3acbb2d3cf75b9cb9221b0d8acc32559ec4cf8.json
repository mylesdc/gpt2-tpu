            "text": "Transgenic mice (Tg) overexpressing human apolipoprotein D (H-apoD) in the brain are resistant to neurodegeneration. Despite the use of a neuron-specific promoter to generate the Tg mice, they expressed significant levels of H-apoD in both plasma and liver and they slowly develop hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance. We show here that hepatic PPAR\u03b3 expression in Tg mice is increased by 2-fold compared to wild type (WT) mice. Consequently, PPAR\u03b3 target genes Plin2 and Cide A/C are overexpressed, leading to increased lipid droplets formation. Expression of the fatty acid transporter CD36, another PPARgamma target, is also increased in Tg mice associated with elevated fatty acid uptake as measured in primary hepatocytes. Elevated expression of AMPK in the liver of Tg leads to phosphorylation of acetyl CoA carboxylase, indicating a decreased activity of the enzyme. Fatty acid synthase expression is also induced but the hepatic lipogenesis measured in vivo is not significantly different between WT and Tg mice. In addition, expression of carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1, the rate-limiting enzyme of beta-oxidation, is slightly upregulated. Finally, we show that overexpressing H-apoD in HepG2 cells in presence of arachidonic acid (AA), the main apoD ligand, increases the transcriptional activity of PPAR\u03b3. Supporting the role of apoD in AA transport, we observed enrichment in hepatic AA and a decrease in plasmatic AA concentration. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the hepatic steatosis observed in apoD Tg mice is a consequence of increased PPAR\u03b3 transcriptional activity by AA leading to increased fatty acid uptake by the liver.",

PPAR\u03b3 is a nuclear receptor implicated in adipocyte differentiation. Two isoforms exist: PPAR\u03b31 is ubiquitously expressed while PPAR\u03b32 is almost exclusively expressed in the adipose tissue [16, 17] . When activated by one of its ligands, PPAR\u03b3 heterodimerizes with retinoid X receptor \u03b1 (RXR\u03b1) and binds to the peroxisome proliferator response elements (PPRE) on the promoter of its target genes [18, 19] . PPAR\u03b3 regulates positively its own transcription and induces transcription of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein \u03b1 (C/EBP\u03b1), which in turn also activates PPAR\u03b3 gene expression [20, 21] . Many natural PPAR\u03b3 ligands have been discovered including AA, prostaglandins, oxidized fatty acid (FA) and some polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] .",

These LD-associated proteins down-regulate LD lipolysis by reducing association of lipases with the surface of the LD [31-33]. On the other hand, hepatic PPAR\u03b1 regulates energy combustion [34] by activating the mitochondrial and the peroxisomal \u03b2-oxidation pathways as well as the microsomal \u03c9-oxidation pathway [35] . Paradoxically, PPAR\u03b1 also activates lipogenesis by regulating the sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 (SREBP-1c) and liver X receptor \u03b1 expression (LXR\u03b1) [36] .",

No apoD was detected in cells either untransfected or transfected with an empty vector. Transfection with the H-apoD cDNA showed a strong expression of the protein ( Fig  6A) . We next co-transfected the H-apoD cDNA construct with a construct containing five peroxisomes proliferator-activator receptor elements (PPRE) linked to a luciferase reporter gene. Thereafter, cells were incubated with 7 \u03bcM of AA in presence or absence of apoD. At this concentration, AA does not induce any cellular toxicity [53] but a slight decrease in apoD expression (Fig 6A) . Over-expression of apoD increased PPAR\u03b3 transcriptional activity (3.7 fold, Fig  6B) . Addition of AA alone increased PPAR\u03b3 transcriptional activity to a similar extent (3.9-fold). Very interestingly, a combination of AA and apoD over-expression showed a very strong synergistic transactivation effect on PPAR\u03b3 transcriptional activity (approximately 9-fold) (Fig 6B) .",

Our data show that the absolute AA concentration is significantly decreased in the plasma of H-apoD Tg compared to WT mice. Consequently, we also observed a significant enrichment in hepatic AA in the total fatty acid pool (Fig 7) . However, the prostaglandin E2 concentration is similar between WT and H-apoD Tg mice (S2 Fig) Taken together, our study shows that overexpression of H-apoD leads to increased hepatic PPAR\u03b3 expression and subsequent activation of the proteins involved in LD formation. This effect is also associated with an elevation of fatty acid uptake while lipogenesis remains unaffected. Because the metabolic syndrome is mild, the slight increase in the mitochondrial \u03b2- oxidation is probably a compensatory mechanism. Experiments performed with HepG2 cells suggest that the hepatic steatosis is a result of an increased AA by apoD in the liver as confirmed by the enrichment of hepatic AA in H-apoD mice. This leads to PPAR\u03b3 transcriptional activation and downstream effects such as the mild metabolic syndrome and the associated insulin resistance. ",

In mice, apoD is mainly expressed in the CNS while in human, it is expressed in several organs although at different levels [1, 12] . As expected, analysis of the expression pattern of human apoD mRNA in Tg mice clearly showed a higher expression in the CNS but expression in the liver and in the plasma was also observed [15] . Similar observations were made at protein levels. The hepatic steatosis can therefore be the result of increased apoD concentration in the liver or from the uptake of circulating apoD. Indeed, as previously suggested by the study of Suresh and collaborators using a mice model of the Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) disease, apoD is a circulating protein [54] . Further experiments are needed in order to clearly determine the origin of the hepatic H-apoD protein in our Tg mice.",

Complementing these data, we observed a slight increase in C/ EBP\u03b1 expression while C/EBP\u03b2 remained unchanged. It is to note that the upregulation of C/ EBP\u03b1 expression is minor. This could be explained by the fact that the hepatic steatosis progression in Tg mice is very slow and hence, the genes implicated are expected to be only slightly modulated. Furthermore, elevated PPAR\u03b3 expression results in the increase of CD36 expression. However, the LPL and HSL levels remained constant at least at the mRNA level. Previous studies demonstrated that activation of PPAR\u03b3 in the liver increases expression of LPL and CD36 [29, 30] however, in our model only the FA uptake is affected without any increase in lipoproteins hydrolysis.

At the opposite, the expression of Cide B, which is not a PPAR\u03b3 target, was unaltered. Listenburger et al [33] showed that Plin2 lowers the rate of TG turnover in LD by reducing the association of ATGL with LD and therefore the hydrolysis of TG [61] while Cide A and C are implicated in the fusion of LD [62] [63] [64] [65] . This may explain the 5-fold increase in LDs' size observed in the liver of H-apoD Tg mice.",

Since we previously showed that SREBP-1c and FAS mRNA expressions were increased in H-apoD Tg mice liver [15] , we measured the mRNA levels of key lipogenic enzymes including LXR\u03b1, a transcription factor that induces lipogenic gene transcription [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] . We did not observe any change in the mRNA levels of ACC, SCD1, DGAT and LXR\u03b1. We also observed an elevation of AMPK expression. The increased expression of AMPK\u03b1 is consistent with a recent study reporting that CD36 increases AMPK expression through the action of both PPAR\u03b3 and PGC-1\u03b1 [71] . Consequently, AMPK\u03b1 phosphorylation is higher in the liver of Tg mice, resulting in increased phosphorylation and inhibition of ACC [72] . Interestingly, Mao et al [73] showed that inhibition of ACC1 in mouse liver induces expression of FAS explaining why FAS expression is increased in our conditions. However, by directly measuring de novo lipogenesis in vivo using 3 H 2 O, we showed the over-expression of H-apoD has no significant effect on de novo lipid synthesis in 1-year-old animals. A similar observation was made in 3-month-old mice (data not shown).",

In Tg mice, elevated apoD expression leads to higher hepatic AA concentration and subsequent activation of the nuclear receptor PPAR\u03b3. As a result, PPAR\u03b3 target genes such as CD36, Plin2, Cide A and Cide C are increased leading to an enhanced LCFA uptake by the hepatocytes and protecting LD against lipolysis by blocking access to lipases. Both PPAR\u03b3 activation and high CD36 expression induce AMPK expression which leads to increased PPAR\u03b1 expression and its downstream target gene, CPT1 which in turn activates mitochondrial \u03b2-oxidation. However, the activation of this compensatory pathway is insufficient to fully inhibit the accumulation of ectopic fat in the liver, but it probably contributes to reduce the progression of hepatic steatosis. Overall, our study highlights a new role for apoD as an AA transporter regulating lipid accumulation in the liver.",
