            "text": "Discovering new binding function via a combinatorial library in small protein scaffolds requires balance between appropriate mutations to introduce favorable intermolecular interactions while maintaining intramolecular integrity. Sitewise constraints exist in a non-spatial gradient from diverse to conserved in evolved antibody repertoires; yet non-antibody scaffolds generally do not implement this strategy in combinatorial libraries. Despite the fact that biased amino acid distributions, typically elevated in tyrosine, serine, and glycine, have gained wider use in synthetic scaffolds, these distributions are still predominantly applied uniformly to diversified sites. While select sites in fibronectin domains and DARPins have shown benefit from sitewise designs, they have not been deeply evaluated. Inspired by this disparity between diversity distributions in natural libraries and synthetic scaffold libraries, we hypothesized that binders resulting from discovery and evolution would exhibit a nonspatial, sitewise gradient of amino acid diversity. To identify sitewise diversities consistent with efficient evolution in the context of a hydrophilic fibronectin domain, >10 5 binders to six targets were evolved and sequenced. Evolutionarily favorable amino acid distributions at 25 sites reveal Shannon entropies (range: 0.3-3.9; median: 2.1; standard deviation: 1.1) supporting the diversity gradient hypothesis. Sitewise constraints in evolved sequences are consistent with complementarity, stability, and consensus biases. Implementation of sitewise constrained diversity enables direct selection of nanomolar affinity binders validating an efficient strategy to balance inter-and intra-molecular interaction demands at each site.",

Protein complexity and our naivety of sequence/structure/function interplay [2] hinder robust de novo design, although several designs have been successfully realized [3] [4] [5] . Thus, na\u00efve identification of protein sequences with novel functions, or even mutants with improved function, benefits from combinatorial analysis of many proteins. The efficacy of this approach is directly dependent on combinatorial library quality and the phenotype selection process. The essence of discovery and evolutionary efficiency is to intelligently search sequence space by identifying the effective extent and amino acid distribution of diversity (if any) at each site. Protein discovery and evolution must balance [6] variance sufficient for generation of novel function (dominated by intermolecular interactions) versus conservation sufficient to maintain a high probability of foldable stability (intramolecular interactions) [7] . This challenge is heightened in small domains [8] that have limited area for a binder interface and require mutation of a larger fraction of the molecule [9] .",

            "text": "Antibody repertoires have evolved sitewise amino acid distributions across a range of diversities (Fig 1A) , which are used in natural and synthetic antibody libraries [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . Yet most synthetic scaffold libraries-including affibodies [15] , affitins [16, 17] , knottins [18, 19] , anticalins [20] , Fynomers [21] , Sso7d [22] , and OBodies [23] -are binary with a fully conserved framework and uniformly diversified paratope (Fig 1B) . Note that different scaffolds use different uniform distributions including NNK codons [24] or complementarity biases [25, 26] but generally lack sitewise variation. DARPin domain libraries have six sites with a uniform broad [40] , designed ankyrin repeat (DARPin) [41] , affibody [42] , and anticalin [43] , domains. (C) The relative impact of alanine mutation on binding is shown for several protein interfaces: TEM1-\u03b2-lactamase (TEM1) and \u03b2-lactamase inhibitor protein (BLIP) (PDB: 1JTG) [44] ; extracellular RNase (barnase) and its intracellular inhibitory binding partner (barstar) (PDB: 1BRS) [45] ; light and heavy chain variable regions of anti-hen egg white lysozyme antibody D1.3 in the context of binding anti-D1.3 antibody E5.2 (not shown) (PDB: 1DVF) [46] ; human growth hormone (hGH) and extracellular domain binding partner (hGHpb) (PDB: 1A22) [47, 48] ; heregulin\u03b2 (HRG) egf domain in the context of binding ErbB3 receptor-IgG fusion (not shown) (PDB: 1HAE) [49] . distribution and one site with N/H/Y diversity [27] . A hydrophilic DARPin library includes two additional sitewise diversities [28] . The most sitewise design in non-antibody scaffolds has been introduced in the type III fibronectin domain. Diversification of one, two, or three loops, [29, 30] or the sheet surface, [31, 32] of this 10 kDa beta sandwich has enabled evolution of binding to a host of molecular targets [30] . Antibody-inspired amino acid bias in putative hot spots has proven effective within fibronectin libraries [31, [33] [34] [35] . Diversification of two loops is evolutionarily superior to one-loop mutation [36] , and although diversification of the third loop (DE loop: G52-T56) is not requisite for high-affinity binding, [30, [36] [37] [38] [39] it can aid stability [37] . Current library designs randomize G52 with G/S/Y, S53-S55 with Y/S, and 12-22 sites in two other loops with a consistent distribution (30% Y, 15% S, 10% G, 5% each F and W, and 2.5% others except C). Sitewise design was extended beyond the DE loop using accessibility, stability, and homology data yielding nine different diversifications at 11 sites in addition to 12 sites with consistent complementarity-biased diversity [35] . Also, in an alternative paratope approach to engineering fibronectin domains, five sites were identified for three different varieties of constrained diversities (4-8 amino acids) in addition to [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] sites with the complementarity biased diversity [31] . While a variety of sitewise diversities have been implemented in the fibronectin domain, the evolved repertoires resulting from these libraries have not been broadly and deeply analyzed.",

The Fn3HP mutant was previously evolved for hydrophilicity to improve processing and in vivo biodistribution [50] . We posit that a broad repertoire evolved from combinatorial libraries for de novo discovery will exhibit sitewise complementaritybiased amino acid diversity in the binding hot spot [48, 51, 52] , conserved wild-type sequence in the distal framework, and a gradient of diversification at intermediate sites including bias for conservation or interactive neutrality in proximal regions. This gradient is not purely spatial as protein structure and protein-protein interfaces are complex ( Fig 1C) . Moreover, for novel ligand discovery, the exact paratope is not known ahead of time, which blurs designed localization of a hot spot [51] .",

Deep sequencing of evolved protein populations has proven effective for analysis of functionality landscapes for maturation of single protein clones [53] , protein families [54, 55] , and antibody [56] repertoires. Here we apply deep sequencing to several high-throughput discovery and evolutionary campaigns to identify repertoires of evolved hydrophilic fibronectin domains. The results demonstrate a range of diversities and sitewise amino acid preferences consistent with a benefit of a gradient of sitewise constraint. A constrained library based on the observed evolutionary repertoire provides stable, high affinity binders directly without maturation, and the sequence analysis provides a metric to evaluate the balance of inter-and intra-molecular considerations in library design, which are quantitatively assessed.",

CDR' refers to a degenerate codon with the following nucleotide frequencies: 20% A, 15% C, 25% G, and 40% T at site 1, 50% A, 25% C, 15% G, and 10% T at site 2, and 0% A, 45% C, 10% G, and 45% T at site 3. Loop length diversity was afforded at mid-loop positions by inserting CDR' diversity sites between sites P25-V29 and G79-S85 of the BC and FG loop, respectively, as denoted by subscripts within homologously recombined into a pCT yeast surface display vector [36] within yeast strain EBY100 [57] during electroporation transformation. The protocol was similar to that described by Benatuil et al. [58] . Yeast at an optical density at 600 nM of 1.3-1.5 were washed twice with cold water and once with buffer E (1 M sorbitol, 1 mM CaCl 2 ) and resuspended in 0.1 M lithium acetate, 10 mM Tris, 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, pH 7.5. Fresh dithiothreitol was added to 10 mM. Cells were incubated at 30\u00b0, 250 rpm for 30 minutes. Cells were washed thrice with cold buffer E and resuspended to 1.4 billion cells per 0.3 mL buffer E. Six \u03bcg of linearized pCT vector and 200 pmol of ethanol precipitated gene insert were added and transferred to a 2 mm cuvette. Cells were electroporated at 1.2 kV and 25 \u03bcF, diluted in YPD (10 g/L yeast extract, 20 g/L peptone, 20 g/L dextrose), and incubated at 30\u00b0for 1 hour. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in 100 mL SD-CAA (16.8 g/L sodium citrate dihydrate, 3.9 g/L citric acid, 20.0 g/L dextrose, 6.7 g/L yeast nitrogen base, 5.0 g/L casamino acids). Plasmid-containing yeast were quantified by dilution plating on SD-CAA agar plates. Each resulting Fn3HP na\u00efve yeast library was evaluated for proper library construction by Sanger sequencing clonal plasmids harvested from the transformed yeast (57 clones from generation one and 15 from generation two na\u00efve libraries) and later via Illumina sequencing. The yeast libraries were also labeled with biotinylated anti-HA antibody (goat pAb, Genscript) and anti-c-MYC antibody (9E10, Covance Antibody Products;) to detect the presence of N-and Cterminal epitopes present on either side of the Fn3HP clones, respectively, via flow cytometry. The fractional detection of cells displaying both HA and c-MYC, compared to those displaying HA alone, is indicative of full-length, stop codon-free clones.",

The induced library was sorted twice via multivalent magnetic bead selections [59] via depletion of non-specific binders on avidin-coated beads and control proteincoated beads followed by enrichment of specific binders on target-coated beads. The pair of magnetic sorts was followed by a flow cytometry selection for full-length clones using the 9E10 antibody against the C-terminal c-MYC epitope tag. Genes were mutated via error-prone PCR with loop shuffling [37] , then electroporated into yeast (EBY100) as previously described. Target binding populations were isolated at two levels of stringency, mid-and high-affinity, for each of the four campaigns. A mid-affinity population included all clones that demonstrated either (i) magnetic bead sorting enrichment at least ten-fold greater for target protein than both avidin binding and non-specific control binding or (ii) binding to 50 nM multivalent target (3:1 stoichiometry of target preloaded on streptavidin-fluorophore) assayed via flow cytometry (S2 Fig). A high-affinity population included all clones exhibiting binding to 50 nM monovalent target assayed via flow cytometry. Herein, clones meeting these criteria are referred to as mid-and high-affinity binders, respectively. Flow cytometry was performed as previously described [60] .",

Analysis work flow for each of the six subgroups (e.g. na\u00efve, mid-affinity, high-affinity populations originating from first and second generation libraries) consisted of first identifying full-length fibronectin DNA sequences, isolating each of the three diversified loop regions, and, lastly, calculating the amino acid frequency at each site. Additional calculations were necessary for the mid-affinity and high-affinity populations to both remove statistically rare events and avoid overcounting dominant clones. The removal of background (i.e. the rarest 2% of sequences, as determined by the rarity of nonspecific binders) was a precaution taken when analyzing the mid-affinity populations to account for the rare non-binding clones inherently collected via magnetic bead sorting [59] . To address the potential detriment of overcounting within all binding populations, the sequences for each loop region were clustered based on 80% or greater sequence homology. For each cluster of similar sequences, the summation of the amino acids at each site were weighted by a power of one-half, then aggregated across all clusters. The resulting weighted sitewise amino acid values were used for frequency calculations. Statistical analysis was performed using two sample Student's t-test. Statistical significance was assessed while adjusting for familywise error rate using Bonferroni method, denoted at level \u03b1 = 0.005.",

At this point, baseline stabilities were individually calculated for each mutant. To analyze the stability impact upon residue substitution for each position in the diversified regions, all 19 natural residue substitutions were individually introduced to the random mutants. The change in stability (\u0394\u0394G folding ) upon mutation was then calculated for each PDB structure's collection of mutants.

The likelihood of a loop position to be proximal to or directly involved with a target binding interface is influenced both by exterior exposure of the side chain (i.e. solvent accessible surface area) as well as its proximity to a region offering sufficient diversified surface area to enable the required enthalpic interactions. The site-specific exposure score is calculated as the product of the solvent accessible surface area [35] and an estimated likelihood of residing at the target binding interface. The latter was quantified on a sitewise basis, averaged across eleven Fn3 crystal structures, using a geometric algorithm. Using Python, the fibronectin orientation that presents maximal diversified surface is identified as follows. BC, DE, and FG loop residues are mutated to alanine to remove wild-type residue size bias. The area of accessible (i. e., visible in a two-dimensional projection as a planar approximation of the interface) diversified surface is calculated for each rotational orientation of fibronectin. The orientation that maximizes accessible view of the paratope, as well as any orientations within 5% of this projected area, is identified starting with a coarse-grained search and optimizing with a fine-grained search. For each site, the maximum area of accessible side chain surface within this set of optimized orientations is calculated. This calculation is repeated for all sites.

Each loop varied in length as guided by natural sequence frequency [37] . The core of the BC and FG loops-2-5 sites and 2-6 sites, respectively, depending on loop length-had full amino acid diversity biased to mimic the third heavy chain complementarity-determining region (CDR) of antibodies. Two sites spatially within the BC and FG loop cores were constrained based on previous experimental results. V29, which benefits as a small, reasonably hydrophobic amino acid [35, 70] , was constrained as A, S, or T. G79, which benefits from glycine bias [35] , was mildly constrained to G, S, Y, D, N, or C to increase glycine frequency while mimicking CDRs. Twelve sites adjacent to the core of the BC and FG loops were afforded five levels of diversity: i) wild-type, ii) wild-type or serine (as a small, mid-hydrophilicity neutral interactor [71, 72] ), iii) wild-type, serine, or tyrosine (the most generally effective side chain for complementarity [73] ), iv) moderate chemical diversity (A, C, D, G, N, S, T, or Y), or v) full antibody-mimicking amino acid diversity. All framework sites are conserved as the sequence of the tenth type III domain of human fibronectin with the hydrophilic mutations V1S, V4S, V11T, A12N, T16N, L19T, V45S, and V66Q [50] as well as the stabilizing D7N [74] . Five sub-libraries were constructed using separate DNA oligonucleotides with degenerate codons for each level of diversity. The five sub-libraries for each of the three loops were pooled at equimolar levels.",

The amino acid distributions observed in binding ligands evolved from the first generation library were used to design a second generation library, which enables further study of evolutionary repertoires from a more constrained library as well as evolution of useful ligands. Within the BC loop at site 23, wild-type D was enriched (46% in the na\u00efve library to 55% in binders) whereas Y, introduced at 17% because of complementarity bias, was substantially depleted in binders to 8\u00b11%. Small, mildly hydrophilic residues were also enriched-G (5% to 11%) and S (11% to 14%)-but not to levels comparable with wild-type bias. Thus, D23 was conserved in the second generation library. At site 24, wild-type A was elevated (39% to 46%), Y was maintained (13% to 13%), and S was substantially depleted (16% to 6%). Thus, the options of wild-type conservation and mild diversity were further explored in the second generation. At site 25, wild-type P was enriched (29% to 40%), Y was maintained (17% to 16%), S slightly declined (25% to 17%), and H was enriched (6% to 8%). Wild-type conservation appears beneficial yet Y, S, and H warrant further consideration. At site 29, the more hydrophobic A was enriched (42% to 56%) whereas the more hydrophilic S and T were depleted (22% to 12% and 34% to 26%, respectively) but still frequent. Thus, second generation design maintained a distribution of AST. Y31 was enriched from 12% to 17% in binders. Glycine, which occurs with 31% frequency at this site within natural sequences of homologous proteins, increased in prevalence from 40% to 56%. To estimate the likelihood of an evolved clone to have been identified from either the first generation repertoire or from that which is observed within the evolved population of binders, an exhaustive leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) was conducted. The training set consisted of n-1 sequence clusters derived from the first generation mid-and high-affinity evolved binder data. Using the training set sequence clusters, a sitewise frequency matrix was calculated. The cross-validation test set consisted of a single sequence cluster that had been excluded from the training set analysis. Each sequence within the test set was assigned a probability for being observed within the original library (P naive ) and the training set (P evolved ). Log-odds score, log(P evolved /P na\u00efve ), histograms are shown for test set sequences (A) and further evaluated on a sitewise basis (B). Substantial decreases in S (18% to 9%), N (8% to 3%), and C (7% to 2%) were observed. The second generation library contained GY diversity. Wild-type G52 was enriched (35% to 57%) whereas S was depleted (23% to 11%). Wild-type conservation appears strongly beneficial at site 52. At sites 53-55, Y and N were enriched or maintained whereas S was depleted, but still present at reasonable levels. Thus, the second generation library implemented YNST diversity at these sites. T56 exhibited similar results without S depletion leading to TYSN design. At FG loop site 76, enrichment was observed for both wild-type T (34% to 41%) and S (26% to 32%) whereas N (10% to 3%) and Y (8% to 3%) were depleted in binders. Thus, the next design included T and S as well as the other small mid-hydrophilic G and A. At site 79, wild-type G was enriched (22% to 31%) as was S (19% to 27%). D (19% to 20%) was maintained but C (13% to 5%), Y (11% to 5%), and N (15% to 9%) decreased. Thus, GSDN diversity was used in the second library. Wild-type S85 maintained (62% to 65%), which prompts future conservation. At site 86, N was mildly decreased (48% to 40%) while S increased from 23% to 28% and Y decreased from 10% to 5%. The second generation design was intended to be NS but was erroneously synthesized as conserved N.",

By constraining diversity at select sites, we aim to improve the balance of inter-and intra-molecular interaction evolution and reduce destabilization upon mutation. Thus, we evaluated the stability of several fibronectin mutant populations: binders from both library generations in this work and binders evolved from binary (fully conserved framework, fully diversified loops) libraries from previous literature as well as the na\u00efve second generation population and the parental fibronectin domains (human and hydrophilic mutant) (Fig 8A) . The first, second, and third quartile stabilities are higher for the first and second generation libraries relative to binders from less biased libraries. Further still, the median stability of the less biased library binders is less than even that of the na\u00efve members of the second generation library (p < 0.05). Note that Fn3HP is of essentially equivalent stability as Fn3 (84\u00b0C vs. 85\u00b0C). In addition to yielding stable binders, the second generation library yields high-affinity binders with little to no evolution. Three binder campaigns continued with additional sorts to identify the strongest binders in the population. Rabbit IgG and lysozyme binders were characterized following two rounds of magnetic bead selection, one round of cytometry sorting at target concentrations of 50 nM and a final round of cytometry sorting at 1 nM, wherein the top 1% of binding events were isolated. Titrations curves of representative clones from the most stringently sorted, non-evolved rabbit IgG and lysozyme populations (Fig 8B) revealed affinities of 150\u00b160 pM and 4\u00b13 nM, respectively. High-affinity MET binders were isolated following three iterations of evolution, each iteration consisting of two magnetic bead selections, one cytometry sort for full-length clones, and one round of error-prone PCR. A representative clone from the evolved MET binding population yielded an affinity of 11 nM (Fig 8B) . Table 4 . Enrichment of framework mutations. Full length fibronectin sequences from first and second generation na\u00efve and binder populations were analyzed. Four framework positions demonstrated enrichment for non-wild type residues.

To further explore the broad sequence data set of highly functional clones resulting from this study, we examined if any computational means could have guided this library refinement; i.e. if any computable parameters correlate with the evolved repertoire. The FoldX algorithm [68, 81] was used to predict each site's tolerance to mutation. The change in stability (\u0394\u0394G folding ) upon mutation across >500 theoretical library variants (see Materials and Methods) was predicted for each of the twenty amino acids at each site. The mutational tolerance was assessed in terms of the number of minimally destabilizing (\u0394\u0394G folding < 0.75 kcal/mol) amino acid substitutions allowed at each site. Observed amino acid diversity (Shannon entropy) in evolved binders correlated with computational mutational tolerance at exposed sites ( Fig 7B) . While no correlation was observed for less exposed sites (Fig 7C) , it should be noted that the key outliers are the sites most distant from the paratope center (D23 and S85). More broadly, four elements were evaluated for their correlation with evolved repertoires: sitewise amino acid frequencies from natural fibronectin homologs, sitewise computational stabilities of each amino acid at each site within the context of diverse fibronectin clones, complementarity-biased amino acid distributions observed in antibody CDRs, and sitewise sidechain exposure. The first two elements-frequency in natural homologs and computational stabilityprovide sitewise amino acid distributions; complementarity bias provides a single site-independent amino acid distribution; and the fourth element-residue exposure-provides a sitewise weight. We examined the ability of these four elements to combine to generate sitewise amino acid distributions that matched the experimentally observed frequencies. The relative weights of the first three elements were allowed to vary for each site based purely on the fourth element: solvent and target accessibility of that site (Eq 1). Sitewise frequencies in natural homologs were calculated from 58,058 homologs from the Pfam database [82] . Sitewise computational stabilities were calculated using FoldX as described above. Complementarity bias was calculated as the amino acid distribution observed in expressed human and mouse antibody CDR-H3 sequences [83] . Solvent accessibility is the relative solvent accessible surface area [84] of each side chain averaged over 11 fibronectin structures. Target accessibility was scored based on the orientation of the amino acid side chain relative to the rest of the diversified paratope (detailed in Materials and Methods).",

Weights were calculated for both an exposuredependent and exposure-independent term, which were summed. The weights provide a relative comparison of the predictive value of each parameter. To evaluate the predictive value overall, the parameters were compared to an unbiased control input matrix (uniformly 5% of each amino acid). Weighted inclusion of all elements yields a library design that matches the experimentally evolved distribution 22 standard deviations superior to designs based on unbiased input matrices (S3 Fig). For well-exposed sites, amino acid diversity is effectively mimicked by 62% complementarity bias, 30% stability computation, and 8% natural frequency (Fig  9) . At sites with less exposure, natural amino acid frequency should be more heavily weighted at the expense of stability and, less so, complementarity. Design based on a single element is inferior to randomness for stability, marginally effective (2 standard deviations above random) for natural frequency, and strongly effective (16 standard deviations above random) for complementarity. In short, the evolved repertoire correlates strongly with complementarity and moderately with computed stability and frequency in natural homologs, varying dependent upon sidechain exposure.",

            "text": "Yet these potential benefits can be offset by the inverse impacts: make unfavorable interfacial contact, worsen neighboring residue orientation, and/or destabilize the protein. If sufficient 'hot spot' interfacial area is not yet present for high-affinity binding, then additional sites must be diversified to enable favorable interaction. At some point, this expanded paratope provides sufficient interface for strong, specific affinity. Similar tradeoffs can be considered for peripheral sites. Given the typical detriment of random mutation, [88] [89] [90] the average peripheral mutation will hinder all four elements thereby suggesting against diversity. Though as a corollary, on average, mutations in the 'hot spot' will negatively impact the last two elements by worsening the entropic penalty upon binding and destabilizing the protein because of imperfect interactions with the conserved peripherals. Thus, peripherals need to be chosen to make neutral to good contact with: (a) intermolecular target; (b,c) intramolecular neighbors involved in binding; and (d) all intramolecular neighbors. For a-c, since beneficial interactions will be unlikely, amino acids-such as serine [25, 72, 91] -that yield relatively neutral interactions may be wise. For d, beneficial interactions are likely for the wild-type residue and conserved neighbors based on their coevolution so conservation should be the aim. Since the precise locations of the hot spots and these transitions will vary for each new ligand-target interface ( Fig  1C) , we hypothesized the evolved repertoires will exhibit a gradient of diversity from extensive diversity in the potential paratope hot spot to full conservation in the framework. Importantly, this gradient includes moderate diversity, with structural bias, within the paratope interfacing with target yet peripheral to the hot spot. Moreover, more mild diversity is included adjacent to the interfacial residues to yield optimal intramolecular contacts with the newly identified paratope. The range of Shannon entropies (Fig 7) and amino acid frequency distributions (Figs 2 and 5) across many binding sequences against several targets support the benefit of a gradient of diversities within combinatorial libraries. The particular amino acid distributions support the hypothesized benefits of wild-type conservation, serine bias, and complementarity bias, at appropriate sites.",

Trimer phosphoramidite codons can be used in oligonucleotide synthesis, [14] which enables precise control over each distribution but elevates synthesis complexity and cost. Independent oligonucleotides can be synthesized for each loop sequence, which further elevates control by enabling pairwise (and higher order) site design albeit at an elevated synthesis scope. Simpler, less expensive single-nucleotide mixed degenerate oligonucleotide synthesis can approximate many amino acid distributions, especially with the inclusion of unbalanced nucleotide frequencies as used in this study. The amino acid distribution within antibody CDR-H3 can be closely approximated by unbalanced single-nucleotide methods [35] , but it must compromise on the genetic code connectivity of glycine, tyrosine, and cysteine. Achieving the desired high frequencies of tyrosine (20%) and glycine (16%) yields much more cysteine than desired (10%). In these libraries, we opted to maintain high tyrosine (17%) while limiting cysteine (5%) at the expense of low glycine (4%). Wild-type glycine bias at sites G52 and G79, as well as G77 in the second generation library, enabled this successful compromise as glycine at fully diversified sites was only marginally enriched in binders relative to the original library (2.7% to 4.0% in the first generation; 3.8% to 4.7% in the second generation). Thus, selective sitewise bias is able to effectively provide the evolutionary benefit of the presence of glycine within the DE and FG loops.",

A gradient of diversity including sitewise constraints was revealed in evolved clones, which is consistent with natural antibody repertoires but converse to current synthetic scaffold combinatorial library designs. Importantly, the extensive dataset allowed for initial characterization of a broadly applicable data driven library design model that guides the most beneficial distribution of amino acids at each position. Sitewise evaluation of theoretical stability upon mutation and natural sequence frequency, as well as overall amino acid prevalence at binding interfaces of antibodies (i.e. complementarity), generate sitewise amino acid frequencies. The ability of these frequencies-scaled linearly based on solvent exposure and target exposure (Eq 1)-to collectively mimic the observed sitewise amino acid distributions in binding populations is evaluated. The optimal weights for each contributing data set as a function of exposure are shown. (A-C) For the indicated weights of each metric, the other free parameters were varied to optimize the match between modeled sitewise amino acid distributions and experimentally observed sequences. The qualities of the fits are presented as the number of standard deviations above the fit obtained if unbiased data are used (i.e. uniformly 5% amino acid diversity rather than stability, homology, and complementarity bias). (A) Relative success when limited to two data inputs. Exposure independent (\u03b1) and dependent (\u03b2) weights are varied, subject to the indicated average weight, to maximize fit.

Additionally, the chemical diversity found at the interfaces of well characterized natural binders, such as the complementarity determining regions (CDR) of antibodies, can be applied to protein scaffolds to accommodate for strong binding interactions. Here, a model for library design was built based on a linear combination of (A) computational stability, (B) natural homolog sequence frequency, and (C) CDR diversity input matrices. These three elements were weighted based on the (D) target exposure (i.e. proximity to the binding interface) and solvent exposed surface area (i.e. orientation and packing) of each site.
