            "text": "Natural HIV-1 protease (PR) is homodimeric. Some researchers believe that interactions between HIV-1 Gag-Pol molecules trigger the activation of embedded PR (which mediates Gag and Gag-Pol cleavage), and that Gag-Pol assembly domains outside of PR may contribute to PR activation by influencing PR dimer interaction in a Gag-Pol context. To determine if the enhancement of PR dimer interaction facilitates PR activation, we placed single or tandem repeat leucine zippers (LZ) at the PR C-terminus, and looked for a correlation between enhanced Gag processing efficiency and increased Gag-PR-LZ multimerization capacity. We found significant reductions in virus-like particles (VLPs) produced by HIV-1 mutants, with LZ fused to the end of PR as a result of enhanced Gag cleavage efficiency. Since VLP production can be restored to wt levels following PR activity inhibition, this assembly defect is considered PR activity-dependent. We also found a correlation between the LZ enhancement effect on Gag cleavage and enhanced Gag-PR multimerization. The results suggest that PR dimer interactions facilitated by forced Gag-PR multimerization lead to premature Gag cleavage, likely a result of premature PR activation. Our conclusion is that placement of a heterologous dimerization domain downstream of PR enhances PRmediated Gag cleavage efficiency, implying that structural conformation, rather than the primary sequence outside of PR, is a major determinant of HIV-1 PR activation.",

During or soon after virus release from cells, Pr55 gag is cleaved by viral protease (PR) into four major products: matrix (MA, p17), capsid (CA, p24), nucleocapsid (NC, p7), and p6 domains [1] . PR is encoded by pol, which is initially translated as a Pr160 gag-pol polyprotein by a ribosomal frameshift event that occurs at a frequency of 5%, resulting in the expression of Pr160 gag-pol to Pr55 gag at a ratio of approximately 1:20 [2] . Pr160 gag-pol is incorporated into virions via interactions with assembling Pr55 gag [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] . Pr160 gag-pol cleavage by PR yields reverse transcriptase (RT) and integrase (IN) in addition to Gag products. The PRmediated proteolytic cleavage of Pr55 gag and Pr160 gag-pol , known as virus maturation, is essential for the acquisition of viral infectivity [9, 10, 11, 12, 13] .",

            "text": "How PR is activated to mediate virus maturation is not completely clear. One proposal is that interaction among Pr160 gagpol molecules triggers the activation of embedded PR, which in homodimeric form mediates Gag and Gag-Pol cleavage following PR autocleavage from Pr160 gag-pol . Maintenance of the Pr55 gag / Pr160 gag-pol expression ratio is critical to virus assembly; the artificial overexpression of Pr160 gag-pol or PR drastically reduces virion production as a result of enhanced Gag processing by overexpressed PR activity [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20] . Equally important is the Pr160 gag-pol sequence and structure, since sequence mutations upstream or downstream of PR often result in defective virus maturation or Gag cleavage [4, 21, 22, 23, 24] . Impaired Gag cleavage is assumed as being due, at least in part, to impaired PR activation, which is likely secondary to inadequate PR dimer interaction. Since natural RT is heterodimeric [25, 26] , there is speculation that RT in the Gag-Pol context facilitates Pr160 gag-pol -Pr160 gag-pol interaction via RT-RT interaction, which in turn influences PR activation. Consistent with this scenario, RT deletion mutations can lead to severely impaired PR-mediated Gag processing [23] . In addition, efavirenz (EFV), a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor that enhances RT dimerization in vitro [27, 28] , reduces virus production as a result of greatly enhanced Gag and Gag-Pol cleavage [29, 30] . Furthermore, a single amino acid substitution in RT (W402A) leads to significantly reduced virus production due to markedly enhanced PR-mediated Gag cleavage [31] . Combined, these data suggest that the RT domain plays an important role in PR activation by influencing PR dimer interaction.",

Accordingly, structural conformations rather than specific sequences may be major determinants of the PR activation process. A protein sequence unrelated to HIV-1 but possessing dimerization capacity may therefore promote PR activation by facilitating PR dimer interaction when fused to the end of PR. To test this possibility, we removed the RT and IN sequences and placed a leucine zipper (LZ)-coding sequence at the C-terminus of PR. Results indicate that LZ placement significantly reduced virion release due to enhanced Gag cleavage, similar to observations for RT W402A mutations.

The resulting constructs were designated PRWz and PRWWz (Fig. 1) . We used PRKz and PRKKz constructs containing the dimerizationdefective LZ mutant version (Kz) as controls. Kz fusion to PRWz at the wt LZ C-and N-termini yielded constructs PRWKz and PRKWz, respectively. Each mutant was transiently expressed in 293T cells. Virus particle assembly and processing were analyzed by Western immunoblotting. The results shown in Figure 2A indicate that Gag/PR transfectants produced substantial quantities of VLPs at levels that were near wild-type. Unprocessed Gag (the Gag precursor Pr55) and incompletely processed Gag (the intermediate p41gag) represent two major Gag products compared to wt in our supernatant and cell samples ( Fig. 2A , lanes 1 vs. 2).

Believing that the potent Gag assembly domain might determine chimera multimerization status, we predicted that the contribution of LZ to enhanced chimera multimerization would be barely (if at all) detectable. We therefore assessed chimera multimerization capacity in a Gag assemblydefective context. After constructing an assembly-defective mutant (designated MoGag) and confirming that the mutation significant-ly impaired Gag assembly (Fig. 4B ), we cloned PR-LZ chimeras into MoGag. To block the effect of PR activity on Gag-PR-LZ chimera assembly assays, all chimeras were introduced into a PRinactivated HIV-1 Pr160 gag-pol -expression plasmid GPfs [4] , with gag and pol in the same reading frame (Fig. 4A ). Results from repeated independent experiments indicate that chimeras with predicted molecular weights were detected in both supernatants and cell lysates following transient expression in 293T cells, suggesting that all chimeras were capable of assembly and release to some extent. However, we noted that MoGagfsWz transfectants produced more chimeric VLPs than MoGagfsD or MoGagfsKz (Figs. 4C and 4D). To confirm that MoGag was multimerizationdefective and that LZ did enhance assembly-defective Gag multimerization, we subjected wt Gag and each mutant to velocity sedimentation analyses. A non-myristylated (myr-) Gag mutant [32] known to be severely defective in both membrane binding and multimerization served as a negative control. Our data indicate that most of the wt Gag was recovered at fractions 3 to 5; in contrast, most myr-Gag and substantial amounts of MoGag were recovered at fractions 1 and 2. Portions of MoGagfsD and MoGagfsKz were detected at lower sucrose density fractions, whereas MoGagfsWz was almost completely recovered at higher sucrose density fractions (Fig. 4E ). Unlike MoGagfsWz, which mostly sedimented at fractions 4 and 5, considerable amounts of MoGagfsWKz and MoGagfsKWz were also recovered at fraction 3, and low but detectable amounts were observed in fraction 2. This sedimentation pattern was similar to that of MoGagfsKz (Fig. 4E , three bottom panels). Also similar to MoGagfsKz, both MoGagfsWKz and MoGagfsKWz were incapable of efficiently assembling into chimeric VLPs (data not shown). We observed this result in repeated independent experiments. This finding suggests that when fused to the PR C-terminus, a LZ tandem repeat containing a wt and mutant LZ (WKz or KWz) does not enhance Gag-PR multimerization as effectively as a wt LZ tandem repeat (Wz). This may partly explain why PRWKz and PRKWz showed relatively lower Gag cleavage efficiency compared to PRWWz (Fig. 2) .",

MoGag with an LZ fusion was expressed in a Gag/PR context, thus expressing both Pr55 gag and PR containing Gag-Pol or Gag-PR(-LZ) fusions (Fig. 5A ). As expected, the insertion of LZ into MoGag/PR at the PR C-terminus resulted in significantly enhanced Gag cleavage efficiency (Fig. 5C, lanes 11 vs. 15 ), suggesting that the LZ enhancement of Gag-PR multimerization is correlated with increased PR-mediated Gag cleavage efficiency. Inefficient Gag cleavage, likely due to either impaired PR activation as a result of Pol truncation or to inhibited PR activity due to a protease inhibitor, resulted in improved MoGag VLP assembly (Fig. 5C , 12 and 15-18 ). This suggests that the MoGag assembly defect is PR activity-dependent, at least in part. The MoPRWWz had significantly higher cellular p24 gag /Pr55 gag ratios compared to MoGag/PR, but slightly lower compared to PRWWz (Figs. 5B and 5C), suggesting that the multimerization-defective Gag mutation reduced the LZ-mediated enhancement of Gag cleavage.

Our results indicate an efficient Gag processing profile for myr-PRWWz, similar to that of its myristylation-positive counterpart, PRWWz (Fig. 6 ). Since myristylation is essential to Gag membrane binding and virus assembly, we failed to detect virus-associated Gag products in any of the myr-supernatant samples (data not shown). This suggests that the LZ insertion made a significant contribution to enhanced Gag cleavage, regardless of the presence or absence of a myristylation signal.",

One possibility is that the transframe peptide p6 pol may play a role in modulating PR dimer interface interaction, thus preventing premature PR activation. Due to a blocking mutation at the p6 pol /PR cleavage, p6 pol -retaining PR is defective in mediating virus maturation [42, 43, 44, 45] , suggesting that a fully functional PR requires the removal of p6 pol . However, to our knowledge there are no reports on the role of p6 pol in PR dimer interaction in a Gag-Pol context. We found that a Gag-Pol mutant with deleted p6 pol was incapable of efficiently processing coexpressed Pr55 gag , which argues against the possibility of p6 pol playing a role in suppressing PR activation [46] . According to one recent study, the insertion of a larger reporter sequence in the p6 pol region markedly impairs virus maturation, whereas partial substitution with a heterologous sequence does not [47] . This suggests that structural conformation, rather than a specific sequence upstream of PR, is important for determining PR activation.",

In contrast, we found that LZ is capable of triggering Gag cleavage enhancement when placed at the PR C-terminus. The RT domain apparently plays a role in preventing premature PR activation. Previous studies suggest that the downstream structural conformation of PR is important in terms of modulating PR activation. First, a single RT amino acid substitution (W402A) that is not known to have major impacts on in vitro RT dimerization [50] markedly enhances Gag processing [31] . An additional partial deletion at the C-terminus of p66RT not only reverses W402Atriggered Gag cleavage enhancement, but also markedly impairs virus maturation. In contrast, truncated Gag-Pol mutants that retain intact p66 or p51 RT domains still respond to the enhancement effect of W402A on Gag processing [31] . Second, substitution mutations in RT are capable of neutralizing the enhancement effect of EFV on Gag processing [49] . Combined, these data suggest that conformational changes in Gag-Pol may significantly affect PR dimer interface interactions, leading to either premature or insufficient PR activation. Our finding that the fusion of HIV-1-unrelated dimerization protein sequences at the C-terminus of PR sharply enhanced Gag cleavage strongly supports the hypothesis that structural conformation, rather than specific sequences, largely determines PR activation status.

DNC(wtZip) and DNC(Kzip) [53] served as templates for amplifying the respective wt and mutant LZ domains of human CREB [54] using the forward primer 59-CGGGATCCTGGAG-GAGGACGAGAGTGTCGTAG-AAAGAAG-39 and reverse primer 59-CCAAGCGGCCGCGATTTGTGGCAG-TAT-39. Plasmids containing the wt and mutant LZ (provided by E. Barklis [55] ) were used to construct the DNC(wtZip) and DNC(Kzip). The human CREB LZ sequence is 284-RE-CRRKKKEYVKCLENRVAVLENQNKTLIEELKALKDLYC-HKSD-327. The underlined amino acid residues E298, R300, E305, Q307, I312, E314, and L321 were mutated to Lys, and N308 was mutated to His, yielding the mutant LZ [54] . Amplified fragments were digested with BamHI and NotI and ligated into the pBRCla-Sal cassette, yielding constructs PRWz and PRKz, respectively. To add the LZ copy, PCR-amplified wt and mutant LZ fragments were purified, digested with a restriction enzyme, and ligated into the PRWz and PRKz, yielding the constructs PRWWz, PRWKz, PRKKz, and PRKWz.",

(B-C) 293T cells were transfected with designated constructs. At 4 h post-transfection, equal amounts of cells were placed on two dish plates. Panel B: Cells were collected 24 and 48 h post-transfection and subjected to Western immunoblotting. Cellular Pr55 gag and p24 gag levels were quantified by scanning immunoblot band densities. Ratios of p24 gag to p55 gag were determined for each mutant and normalized to those of wt in parallel experiments. Bars indicate standard deviation. **, p,0.01. Panel C: Supernatants and cells were collected 48-72 h post-transfection following treatment with or without 5 mM of HIV-1 protease inhibitor Saquinavier.
