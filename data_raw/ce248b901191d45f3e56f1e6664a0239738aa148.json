            "text": "The advent of unbiased metagenomic virus discovery has revolutionized studies of virus biodiversity and evolution. Despite this, our knowledge of the virosphere, including in mammalian species, remains limited. We used unbiased metagenomic sequencing to identify RNA viruses in European field voles and rabbits. Accordingly, we identified a number of novel RNA viruses including astrovirus, rotavirus A, picorna-like virus and a narmovirus (paramyxovirus). In addition, we identified a sobemovirus and a novel luteovirus that likely originated from the rabbit diet. These newly discovered viruses were often divergent from those previously described. The novel astrovirus was most closely related to a virus sampled from the rodent-eating European roller bird (Coracias garrulous). PCR screening revealed that the novel narmovirus in the UK field vole had a prevalence of approximately 4%, and shared common ancestry with other rodent narmoviruses sampled globally. Two novel rotavirus A sequences were detected in a UK field vole and a French rabbit, the latter with a prevalence of 5%. Finally, a highly divergent picorna-like virus found in the gut of the French rabbit virus was only~35% similar to an arilivirus at the amino acid level, suggesting the presence of a novel viral genus within the Picornaviridae.",

However, due to their potential and sometimes profound impact on public health and the agricultural industries, most attention has understandably been directed toward those viruses that affect humans and economically important animals and plants. Hence, our knowledge of the diversity, evolution and functional biology of RNA viruses infecting a wider range of host species is limited. This major sampling bias has been in part addressed by recent studies reporting the discovery of a multitude of new invertebrates and vertebrate viruses, massively increasing the known virosphere and demonstrating the importance of investigating species that are often overlooked [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] .",

The abundant and diverse virome harbored by rodents likely reflects their propensity to live in relatively large and dense populations and their speciose nature: Rodentia is the largest mammalian order, comprising 2200 species, and hence approximately 40% of all mammalian species [14, 15] . Lagomorphs are closely related to rodents, although comprise only 89 extant species including rabbits and hares [16] . Recent reports have shown that rabbits and hares harbor an array of viruses such as caliciviruses, coronaviruses, bocaparvoviruses, hepatitis E and myxomavirus [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . Importantly, the discovery of these novel viruses in rodents and lagomorphs has provided a more refined understanding of the evolutionary history of known pathogenic viruses, including coronaviruses, hepatitis A virus and hepaciviruses [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . However, despite these recent advances, we have only scratched the surface of the potential diversity of rodent and lagomorph viruses.",

The number of host RPL4 reads was proportional to the number of viral reads in each sample. The abundance of viral and RPL4 reads in each animal were correlated: the animals with the highest abundance of host reads also had the highest abundance of viral reads. A novel rotavirus A, picorna-like virus and coronavirus (previous study [20] ) were identified in the rabbit, a novel paramyxovirus and hantavirus (previous study [28] ) in the field vole UKMa K4D, and a novel astrovirus, rotavirus A and coronavirus (previous study [11, 25] ) in the field vole UKMa1 (Figure 2A,B) .

A total of 7565 nt and 13,278 nt (Table 1) were retrieved for UKMa1 and L232, respectively. Blastn analysis of all the available rotavirus A segments (VP1, VP2, VP3, VP6, VP7, NSP2, NSP3, and NSP4) revealed that the rabbit RVA was closely related (>96%) to other viruses from a range of host species including human, bovine, giraffe and roe deer ( Table 2 ). These findings were confirmed by the phylogenetics analysis for each segment (Figure 4, Figures S3 and S4 ). In contrast, the field vole rotavirus A was more divergent, with nucleotide similarities of~75% to the closest relatives in the VP1, VP2, VP3, VP6, NSP2 and NSP3 segments, suggesting a novel genotype of RVA in each of the retrieved segments (Table 2 ). Phylogenetic analysis showed that UKMa1 RVA formed a distinct lineage within rotavirus A species, although it loosely grouped with a mouse RVA in the VP3 phylogeny ( Figure 4 and Figure S3 ). Detailed conclusions regarding the evolutionary history of each segment of the rabbit and field vole RVA could not be drawn due to low bootstrap support on the branches of each tree. Additional PCR screening on more French rabbit intestinal washes from the same cohort revealed a 4.9% prevalence (13 positives in 268 samples). Six originated from Creuse department in central France, four from the neighboring Puy-de-D\u00f4me department, with the other three from the departments Deux-S\u00e8vres, Loire and Dordogne ( Figure 1B ). All the positive samples originated from central France with the exception of Charente, whereas no positive cases were identified in the north-west and south-west departments.

            "text": "Although next-generation metagenomic sequencing has fundamentally changed virus discovery, many viruses still lack information about their host species [38] and the interpretation of results is greatly complicated by commonplace reagent contamination [39] . It is therefore important to confirm any metagenomic findings by PCR on the original samples. In addition, depending on the tissue, it may be difficult to determine the exact virus host (i.e., intestinal tissue sample) due to 'contamination' from the diet of the animal. Indeed, previous studies have shown the detection of viruses in gut and fecal samples of humans and animals that are likely derived from their diet [40] [41] [42] . Due to their detection in multiple animals we are confident that the field vole and the rabbit were the likely hosts for the paramyxovirus and the rotavirus A, respectively. However, it has not been determined whether the field vole is the true host of the rotavirus and astrovirus detected. The field vole-related astrovirus clustered with an astrovirus detected in fecal samples of European rollers (Coracias garrulus) in Hungary [43] . This bird species is found in a wide variety of habitats and is known to feed on insects and small vertebrates, including rodents [44] . However, as noted by the original authors, this virus shared a common ancestor with rodent-borne astroviruses so it is possible that it has a dietary origin since European rollers prey on small rodents [44] . Hence, the clade comprising UKMa1 and Er/SZAL6/HUN/2011 astrovirus may in reality represent a rodent clade of mamastroviruses. This will require confirmation through the analysis of additional rodent astroviruses.",

The trees represent maximum likelihood phylogenetic analyses of astrovirus partial ORF1a (508 aa), ORF1b (298 aa) and capsid (350 aa) gene sequences. The novel sequence obtained from the UK field vole UKMa1 was analyzed alongside reference sequences representing all different genera of astroviruses. Reference sequences are indicated by their GenBank accession numbers. Branch lengths are drawn to a scale of amino acid substitutions per site. Numbers above individual branches indicate the bootstrap support; only values >80% are shown. The novel UKMa1 astrovirus is marked with a red dot. For clarity, some viral clades have been collapsed.",
