A total of 1,482 healthy Holstein heifer and bull calves from a large California dairy were enrolled at 24 to 48 hours of age until hutch exit at approximately 90 days of age. Calves were block-randomized by time to one of three treatments: 1) placebo, 2) zinc methionine (ZM), or 3) zinc sulfate (ZS) administered in milk once daily for 14 days. Serum total protein at enrollment and body weight at birth, treatment end, and hutch exit were measured. Fecal consistency was assessed daily for 28 days post-enrollment. For a random sample of 127 calves, serum zinc concentrations before and after treatment and a fecal antigen ELISA at diarrhea start and resolution for Escherichia coli K99, rotavirus, coronavirus, and Cryptosporidium parvum were performed. Linear regression showed that ZM-treated bull calves had 22 g increased ADG compared to placebo-treated bulls (P = 0.042). ZM-treated heifers had 9 g decreased ADG compared to placebo-treated heifers (P = 0.037), after adjusting for average birth weight. Sex-stratified models showed that high birth weight heifers treated with ZM gained more than placebo-treated heifers of the same birth weight, which suggests a doseresponse effect rather than a true sex-specific effect of ZM on ADG. Cox regression showed that ZM and ZS-treated calves had a 14.7% (P = 0.015) and 13.9% (P = 0.022) reduced hazard of diarrhea, respectively, compared to placebo-treated calves. Calves supplemented for at least the first five days of diarrhea with ZM and ZS had a 21.4% (P = 0.027) and 13.0% (P = 0.040) increased hazard of cure from diarrhea, respectively, compared to placebo-treated calves. Logistic regression showed that the odds of microbiological cure at diarrhea resolution for rotavirus, C. parvum, or any single fecal pathogen was not different between treatment groups. Zinc supplementation delayed diarrhea and expedited diarrhea recovery in pre-weaned calves. Additionally, zinc improved weight gain differentially in bulls compared to heifers, indicating a research need for sex-specific dosing.",

            "text": "Introduction Diarrhea is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality and the most common reason for antimicrobial drug treatments in pre-weaned dairy heifers [1, 2] . A USDA survey of preweaned dairy heifers reported that 24% experienced diarrhea and 18% received antimicrobial treatment for it [1] . Diarrhea is also a leading cause of morbidity and the second foremost cause of mortality in children with over 1 billion cases and a half a million deaths annually [3, 4] . Zinc supplementation in children decreases the incidence, duration, and severity of diarrhea, increases recovery rates, decreases the use of antibiotics and antidiarrheal medications, and reduces mortality [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . In a clinical trial that established a non-toxic zinc dose and investigated its therapeutic use for diarrhea in neonatal dairy calves, zinc-treated calves had numerically quicker clinical recovery, increased weight gain, and higher odds of fecal clearance of Cryptosporidium parvum between diarrhea onset and recovery compared with placebotreated calves [11] . As a result, zinc supplementation may be beneficial for prevention of diarrhea in dairy calves and, thus, minimize antimicrobial use. However, studies investigating zinc's potential effectiveness are lacking.",

The dairy herd was composed of 5,500 lactating cows, predominantly Holsteins, and housed approximately 1,600 pre-weaned calves. Approximately 75% of the calves were born on the participating dairy and 25% were born on an affiliated dairy located approximately 10 miles away. Calves enrolled in the trial included healthy Holstein heifer or bull calves 24 to 48 hours of age. Calves were determined to be healthy via visual examination by a veterinarian (HF) or a trained researcher. Calves were excluded if they had obvious morbidities or congenital defects, were non-Holstein, born on the affiliated dairy, younger than 24 hours of age or older than 48 hours of age at the time of enrollment. Calves from the affiliated dairy were excluded due to differences in physical location and management practices of pre-partum cows. All procedures were approved by the University of California Davis Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol number 18067 Approved: March 6, 2014) .",

At enrollment, calf characteristics, including sex, birth date, time of first colostrum feeding, and treatment color were recorded. Attitude and feces were assessed daily until 28 days post-enrollment using previously published methods [11] by two study investigators, a veterinarian and a trained researcher. Attitude scoring was based on a threepoint scale. A calf with an attitude score of 1 was bright, alert, and readily stood with stimulation; a calf with a score of 2 was quiet, alert, and stood only with moderate stimulation; a calf with a score of 3 exhibited a dull mentation and remained recumbent in response to stimulation. Fecal scoring was performed only on fresh feces and was also based on a three-point scale, as 1 (solid), 2 (semi-formed/loose), or 3 (watery). If no fresh feces were observed in the hutch, \"none seen\" (NS) was recorded. Body weight was measured using a digital scale at birth, end of treatment, and hutch exit by farm employees with the exception of end of treatment weights, which were recorded by study investigators. Treatments for farm-diagnosed illnesses were performed and recorded on hutch cards by the calf manager. Study investigators regularly recorded this information from cards in addition to extracting treatment event reports from DairyComp 305 (Valley Agricultural Software, Tulare, CA). Though daily diagnosis and treatment of study calves was performed and recorded by the calf manager, a veterinarian was responsible for examining and determining whether study calves met specific criteria for euthanasia. A calf was euthanized if morbidity was severe enough to significantly depress appetite, hydration status, attitude, mentation, and/or ambulatory capability and the calf showed limited to no immediate response to therapy or supportive care. Study calves were euthanized by the calf manager using an on-farm captive bolt protocol established by the herd veterinarian within 3 hours of the decision to euthanize. Enrolled calves that died prior to hutch exit were necropsied within 24 hours of death by a veterinarian. All calves were monitored throughout the study period for evidence of zinc toxicity. At the end of the study period, calves were cared for at the dairy in accordance with standard commercial operations.",

When modeling the hazard of diarrhea cure, a binary variable termed therapeutic supplementation indicating whether calves were treated with either ZM, ZS or placebo for all or at least the first 5 days of diarrhea was evaluated as an additional covariate. A five-day period was selected by the authors based on clinical experience, as five days represents a reasonable duration over which most therapeutic treatments for calf diarrhea should be applied and be expected to alleviate disease. The proportional hazards assumption that the hazard of diarrhea is independent of time was assessed using analysis of Schoenfeld residuals and testing whether the log hazard-ratio function is constant over time.

In addition, 8 calves were excluded due to treatment errors. Therefore, a total of 1,482 calves (placebo = 500, ZM = 491, ZS = 491) were included in the final analyses. A total of 242 calves (16.3%) had minimal fecal output at the time of enrollment while 125 calves (8.4%) had abnormal fecal scores of 2 or 3 that were described as meconium. All enrolled calves appeared healthy on visual assessment and hence were assumed to have a normal fecal score at the time of enrollment. The three treatment groups at enrollment did not differ significantly in mean birth weight (kg) (P = 0.244), mean serum total protein (g/dL) (P = 0.541), mean attitude score (P = 0.845), mean fecal score (P = 0.522), as shown in Table 1 , or distribution of calf sex (P = 0.472).

Of these 21 calves that died, 14 (66.7%) were bulls and 7 (33.3%) were heifers. Eighteen of the 21 calves (85.7%) were found dead, rather than euthanized, due to acute and spontaneous death without previous obvious clinical signs of disease. The remaining 3 calves were euthanized prior to death due to severe and/or prolonged morbidity. Characteristics and causes of death based on field necropsy of these calves can be found in S4 Table. There was no significant difference in the proportion of calves that died between treatment groups (P = 0.168), though mortality was significantly higher in bulls compared to heifer calves (P = 0.049).

            "text": "The current trial demonstrated evidence for the beneficial effect of ZM on ADG and neonatal diarrhea as well as an effect of ZS on diarrhea in dairy calves during the pre-weaning period. It is important to consider these results in the context of the entire pre-weaning and hutch period. On average, after 90 days from birth to hutch exit, placebo-treated bull calves gained 38.88 kg body weight while ZM-treated bull calves gained an additional 1.98 kg (40.86 kg). In contrast, the effect of zinc on weight gain in treated heifers depended on birth weight. Low birth weight heifers treated with ZM gained on average less than a placebo-treated heifer of the same birth weight. In contrast, high birth weight heifers treated with ZM gained more than placebo-treated heifers of the same birth weight. The switch in direction of the association between ZM treatment and ADG in heifer calves depending on birth weight suggests a doseresponse effect rather than a true sex-specific effect of ZM on ADG. Hence, low birth weight calves (including heifers) may require a lower dose of ZM to mitigate any negative effect of what is otherwise a suitable dose for higher birth weight calves. These findings are in agreement with a previous randomized clinical trial testing the effect of daily oral zinc in diarrheic neonatal Holstein calves which, showed that ZM-treated calves had a numerically, though not significantly increased ADG compared to calves treated with zinc oxide or placebo due to small sample size [11] . In general, our trial findings are in agreement with the large body of human literature supporting the use of oral zinc for the prevention and treatment of diarrhea and impaired growth in children [5, 10, 33] .",

            "text": "Zinc supplementation is widely accepted by global health organizations as a vital component of therapy for childhood diarrhea [3, 4] , however, recent reviews of the literature demonstrated heterogeneity in study results on the basis of age, baseline zinc status, geographic location, and supplementation regimen [10, 34] . Similar to our findings, a sex-specific response to zinc supplementation has been demonstrated in several human studies. Zinc gluconate administered for diarrhea prevention reduced the incidence of dysentery in treated boys but not girls [35] ; when given therapeutically, it reduced diarrhea duration and frequency more dramatically in boys compared to girls [36] . Similarly, zinc sulfate was shown to improve Effect of zinc on diarrhea in calves diarrhea outcomes in boys but improved growth rates in girls [13] . Broadly, these differences between male and female responses to zinc supplementation are not understood, though theories regarding differences in immune function and response [13, 35] , diarrhea etiology [13] , and nutrient requirements [35] have been proposed. In the current study, ZM-treated bulls demonstrated increased ADG compared to placebo-treated bulls while ZM-treated heifers demonstrated decreased ADG compared to placebo-treated heifers. However, due to a significant interaction between ZM treatment and birth weight, this reduction in ADG in ZMtreated heifers was overcome with increasing birth weight, such that ZM-treated heifers with birth weights above 42 kg experienced increased ADG during the pre-weaning period, compared to placebo-treated heifers with birth weights above 42 kg. Differences in the growth response to ZM supplementation between bull and heifer calves may have been related to its effect on feed intake. Previous research on the effects of feeding various doses of oral zinc oxide to pre-ruminant dairy calves demonstrated that high levels of oral zinc supplementation resulted in reduced feed intake [23] . In the current trial, oral ZM dose was estimated to be significantly higher in heifers compared to bulls due to the significantly lower birth weight of heifers. Additionally, serum zinc concentrations in ZM-treated heifers were numerically higher than that of bulls, though this difference was not significant, likely due to the small sample size. Perhaps the higher zinc dose in heifers was associated with reduced feed intake, leading to reduced growth, and that this effect was more pronounced for ZM compared to ZS. The fact that ZM-treated heifers with birth weights approaching those of average bull calves (and, therefore, a similar zinc dose to that in bulls) experienced an increase in ADG over placebo-treated heifers similar to that of bull calves partially supports this theory. Although management practices on the study dairy were designed to be identical for both bulls and heifers, it is possible that subtle, unrecognized differences in nutritional and health management may also have contributed to sex-specific differences in weight gain. Nevertheless, future trials are warranted to investigate the potential differences in the dose-response to zinc supplementation between bulls and heifers.",

In other words, calf diarrhea is mitigated by zinc supplementation and, therefore, on the causal pathway between zinc and ADG. However, considering the similarly-reduced hazard of diarrhea and increased hazard of cure from diarrhea in both ZM and ZS treatment groups but a lack of effect of ZS on ADG, it is likely that the effect of ZM on ADG is not solely mediated through its effects on diarrhea. Differences in effectiveness between organic and inorganic formulations also may exist. In fact, the underlying mechanism of action of oral zinc remains unknown [6] . Several theories of the mechanisms of action of zinc in the prevention and treatment of childhood diarrhea exist, including a mucosal-protective role, a diarrhea-induced zinc deficiency, an essential element in cell-mediated immunity, and a modifier of intra-luminal electrolyte secretion and absorption [6, [37] [38] [39] .",

            "text": "The clinical and practical implications of effects of ZM supplementation on ADG and diarrhea must be considered. Pre-weaned calf diarrhea remains an ongoing issue for the dairy industry. The deleterious effects on calf health and performance and the resulting economic burden create a strong incentive to treat and prevent diarrhea in pre-weaned calves. On large dairy operations like those in California's Central Valley, small changes in disease incidence and duration as well as animal growth and performance can have profound economic consequences. As a non-antimicrobial product, zinc may become increasingly attractive as antimicrobials in livestock feed are under increased scrutiny and regulation due to concerns about antimicrobial resistance [2, 40] . Prevalence of C. parvum fecal shedding in a random sample of 92 study calves at onset and resolution of diarrhea was significantly higher in calves treated with zinc compared to Placebo-treated calves. In contrast, a previous study where calves that tested positive for C. parvum at the start of diarrhea and were treated with ZM had 16 times higher odds of being fecal ELISA negative at exit compared to the Placebo group (P = 0.08; power = 72.3%) [11] . The difference in findings may be due to the differences in the timing of diarrhea across treatment groups. For the current study's random sample of calves that acquired, survived, and were sampled on the correct days, the mean age of calves on both onset and resolution of diarrhea was higher for ZM and ZS calves compared to placebo-treated calves. Although C. parvum oocyst shedding in infected calves can occur as early as 3 days of age, peak shedding occurs at about 14 days of age [41] . It is possible that the increase in prevalence of C. parvum shedding in ZM and ZS treated groups was due to the increased age of zinc-treated calves compared to placebo-treated calves at resolution of diarrhea. The latter explanation is also supported by our findings that the odds of microbiological cure from C. parvum significantly decreased in older calves, with no significant differences in the odds of cure between treatment groups. In addition, the current testing did not estimate the concentration of C. parvum shedding which may still differ between treatment groups.",

Additionally, our results show that calves respond to zinc supplementation for diarrhea prevention differently depending on chemical formulation and calf sex. The latter could be due to differences in body weight between bulls and heifers and may point towards the need for sex-specific dosing. Furthermore, the current research did not evaluate the potential economic utility of zinc supplementation. Future studies on more accurate dosing of zinc by calf sex, the practical feasibility of weight-based dosing, and the expected cost-effectiveness of zinc administration as part of the management of pre-weaned dairy calves are warranted. Finally, our clinical trial was performed on a single, large, predominately Holstein, California dairy over a six-month period, which precluded our ability to evaluate differences due to season or breed. Hence, future studies to assess any modifying effect of breed and seasonal differences on the effect of zinc on calf health and weight gain are also needed.",
