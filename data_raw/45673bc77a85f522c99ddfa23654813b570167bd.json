One of our recent studies showed that depletion of peripheral blood monocytes (PBM) attenuated not only peripheral inflammation but also neuroinflammation induced by peripheral LPS injection. Our results demonstrated that monocytes are the peripheral decisive elements in the process of neuroinflammation induced by peripheral inflammation [14] . Moreover, monocyte and microglia are considered to share the same origin of the myeloid lineage [15, 16] ; mounting evidence reveals that monocytes could infiltrate into the brain and develop into microglia [17] or construct a special group of macrophages [18] .

In the first part of the experiment, we confirmed that repeated low-dose LPS i.p. injection could induce immune tolerance of PBM without inflammation or dopaminergic neuronal loss in the brain. To induct endotoxic tolerance, rats were pre-treated with repeated 0.3 mg/kg LPS intraperitoneal injection for 4 days. Then, PBM were isolated, cultured, and restimulated by a hige-dose LPS. Moreover, we verified that peripheral repeated low-dose LPS intraperitoneal administration was failing to cause inflammation or dopaminergic neuronal loss in the brain parenchyma of rats. According to the different preconditioning, three groups were involved: the control group (n = 15), the PBS (i.p.) group (n = 6), and the LPS (i.p.) group (n = 42). In the second part of the experiment, we investigated the neuroprotective role of peripheral immune tolerance in intracranial LPS injection-induced neuroinflammation-related neurodegeneration. Neuroinflammation-induced PD rat model was conducted by 15 \u03bcg LPS intracranial injection into the right striatum. Inflammatory cytokines, microglial activation, loss of dopaminergic neurons, as well the behavior impairment were detected at indicated time points. Four groups were involved, including a control group without treatment, a PBS(striatum) group with striatal PBS injection as the sham group, a PBS (i.p.) + LPS (striatum) group with peripheral PBS pretreatment prior to striatal 15 \u03bcg LPS injection, and a LPS (i.p.) + LPS (striatum) group with peripheral LPS pre-treatment prior to striatal 15 \u03bcg LPS injection 30 min) to remove particulate materials.

Guard volume (4 \u03bcm from the top, 4-6 \u03bcm from the bottom of the section) was excluded from both surfaces to avoid the problem of lost cap, and only the profiles that came into focus within the counting volume (with a depth of 10 \u03bcm) were counted. The estimate of the total numbers of TH-positive neurons was calculated according to the optical fractionator formula [27] .",

Here, we investigated the effects of peripheral immune tolerance pre-treatment on neuroinflammationinduced neurodegeneration. Peripheral immune tolerance suppresses inflammatory activity of peripheral blood monocyte Immune tolerance is a protective mechanism facing to excessive inflammation and unnecessary by-stander injury [29] . Endotoxic tolerance is always induced by a low dose of LPS and deemed as the most essential component of immune tolerance when suffering from subsequent inflammatory challenge [20, 30] .

Decreased inflammatory cytokines showed the peripheral immune tolerance inducedhypoactive state of PBM. TLR4 serve as the major pattern recognition receptors involved in the detection of LPS so that downregulation of TLR4 expression means diminished inflammatory response of PBM [33, 34] . This proves that PBM are the decisive cells in the formation of LPS-induced peripheral immune tolerance.",

[6] . However, the dose of LPS we used in the present study was considered to be a low-dose (0.3 mg/kg). Intracephalic immune status was monitored after repeated low-dose LPS injection-induced peripheral immune tolerance. The results indicated that repeated low-dose LPS intraperitoneal injection was insufficient to cause inflammation within the SN of healthy rats (there was neither an increase of inflammatory cytokines nor an upregulation of Iba-1). Previous studies demonstrate that the levels and distribution of inflammatory factors in the brain vary with the various dosage of peripheral LPS administration [4, 35] . Quan et al. confirmed that high dose of LPS induced global expression of proinflammatory cytokines in the brain, whereas low dose of LPS increased TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 mRNA expression only in the choroid plexus, circumventricular organs, and meninges without brain parenchyma [36] . This conclusion coincides with our results, although other regions outside the SN have not been measured in our study. In addition, we also observed the neuronal morphology and the total numbers of dopaminergic neurons in the SN after repeated intraperitoneal LPS administration. Our results revealed that the immunoreactivity of TH expressed on dopaminergic neurons was preserved in the SN.",

Our results showed that peripheral immune tolerance preconditioning attenuates the intracranial LPS injection-induced neuroinflammation, manifested as the decrease of inflammatory cytokines and the inhibition of microglial activation. This suggests that the regulation of PBM immune status could affect the progression of neuroinflammation [13] . We speculated that the neuroinflammatory alleviation was induced by peripheral immune tolerance preconditioning through the following ways: (a) Monocytes and microglia are considered to share the same origin of the myeloid lineage [37] ; thus, immune tolerance pre-treatment induced hypo-responsiveness of monocytes may reflect the weakened immune activity of microglia in the brain correspondingly [38] . (b) Immune tolerant PBM may decrease the pro-inflammatory cytokines infiltrating from periphery into the brain correspondingly [39, 40] .

            "text": "The incidence of peripheral immune tolerance has been reported in several systemic disease settings, including sepsis, trauma, surgery, and pancreatitis, underlining its clinical significance [30] . In this study, we evaluated the effect of peripheral immune tolerance on neuroinflammation-related neurodegeneration, and our results suggested that LPS preconditioning could protect rats from neuroinflammation-induced neurodegeneration, showing as the increase of neuronal survival and the improvement of behavioral damage. Rosenzweig et al. clarified that LPS preconditioning modulates the cellular inflammatory response after cerebral ischemia, resulting in neuroprotection [21] . Besides, LPS preconditioning conferred neuroprotection has been proved in traumatic brain injury [22] and deep hypothermic circulatory arrest [23] . In accordance with these results, we observed that peripheral immune tolerant preconditioning-induced hypo-responsiveness of PBM led to a significant neuroprotection from subsequent neurodegeneration. It is sufficient to show that PBM serve as a significant regulator in the development and progression of neurodegenerative diseases. It is recognized that excessive microglial activation can lead to the development of neurodegenerative diseases [9] ; on the contrary, our present study showed that the neuroprotection of LPS preconditioning from neurodegeneration was accompanied by inhibition of microglial activation. Rodents that pre-treated with fluoxetine or somatostatin showed neuroprotective effects depending on inhibition of neuroinflammation-related microglial (See figure on previous page.) Fig. 11 Peripheral immune tolerance pre-treated PD rats were protected from intracranial LPS injection-induced neurodegeneration with increased dopaminergic neuronal survival in the SN. Rats from four groups with or without peripheral LPS pre-treatment were sacrificed, and then, brains were removed at 7, 14, and 28 days after striatal injection. The results implied that peripheral immune tolerance pre-treatment protected the PD rats from neuroinflammation-related neurodegeneration with increased dopaminergic neuronal survival. a Immunohistochemistry staining on frozen sections of TH in the four groups of our observation. Since the control group and the PBS (striatum) group were not statistically significant at each time point, we selected 7 days as a representative. Moreover, the difference had not been distinguished as early as 7 days, so the data of the PBS (i.p.) + LPS (striatum) group and the LPS (i.p.) + LPS (striatum) group at 7 days was not shown. b-d Total numbers of THpositive neurons in the injected side of SN (right SN) collected by stereological counting (n = 3, each group). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 vs. control group. #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01 vs. PBS (i.p.) + LPS (striatum) group.

Rats from four groups with or without peripheral LPS pre-treatment were sacrificed, and then, the brains were removed at 7, 14, and 28 days after striatal injection. The results implied that peripheral immune tolerance pre-treatment protected the PD rats from neuroinflammation-related neurodegeneration with upregulated mRNA levels of TH. a-c The mRNA levels of TH were quantified by qRT-PCR (n = 7, each group). **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 vs. control group. #P < 0.05 vs. PBS (i.p.) + LPS (striatum) group. The data are presented as the mean \u00b1 SEM activation [46, 47] . These results highlight the neuroprotective role of microglial immunocompetent restriction in neuroinflammation-induced neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, inhibition of microglial over-activation caused by peripheral immune tolerance produces neuroprotection.",

Being different from previous studies, we regarded neurodegeneration as systemic diseases rather than disorders limited in the CNS. The results of our study may provide evidences for the immunologic communication between brain and periphery and likely produce an easier and more convenient peripheral way to manipulate the immunologic activities within the brain. However, our study is limited in that the study of molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways under this neuroprotection needs to be further implemented.",
