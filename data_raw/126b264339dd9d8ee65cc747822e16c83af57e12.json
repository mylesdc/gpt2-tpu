The A2MC2-P90 replicates faster with a higher virus yield than wild type A2MC2 virus. Infection of primary pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAMs) also induces interferons. Sequence analysis showed that the A2MC2-P90 has genomic nucleic acid identity of 99.8% to the wild type but has a deletion of 543 nucleotides in nsp2. The deletion occurred in passage 60. The A2MC2-P90 genome has a total of 35 nucleotide variations from the wild type, leading to 26 amino acid differences. Inoculation of three-week-old piglets showed that A2MC2-P90 is avirulent and elicits immune response. Compared with Ingelvac PRRS \u00ae MLV strain, A2MC2-P90 elicits higher virus neutralizing antibodies. The attenuated IFN-inducing A2MC2-P90 should be useful for development of an improved PRRSV vaccine.",

A multi-step growth assay of high-passaged A2MC2-P90 virus showed that it propagates faster than the wild type virus with a higher virus yield.

As a result, 5 of the 6 unique amino acid residues of A2MC2 compared to the MLV and VR-2332 remained the same in A2MC2-P90. The conserved five nucleotides leading to unique amino acids in A2MC2 are nt7621, 9655, 12012, 12972 and 12975 and the five unique residues are Ser20 in nsp8/9, Leu13 in nsp10, Gly135 in nsp12, and Val93 and Val94 in GP3. This result indicates that the 14 nucleotides in A2MC2 are highly conserved and sustained during the 90 serial passages. It also suggests that these 14 nucleotides or their related RNA structures might correlate with the feature of A2MC2 in IFN induction.",

Among the six unique amino acid residues, five are identical in both wild type A2MC2 and A2MC2-P90 and are located in nsp8/9, nsp10, nsp12 and GP3. These residues do not correlate with virulence as the A2MC2-P90 is avirulent. The nsp8 has unknown functions. The nsp9 is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase; nsp10 is the helicase and GP3 is a structural glycoprotein 32, 33 . The nsp12 induces STAT1 phosphorylation at Ser727 and may contribute to expression of inflammatory genes 34 . None of these genes are known to be involved in the PRRSV antagonizing feature of interferon induction. It is not known whether these proteins or the nucleotide-related RNA structures play a role in inducing interferon induction. Further studies are needed to address the question. Compared to the wild type virus, A2MC2-P90 genome has a deletion of 543 nucleotides in nsp2. The deletion likely occurred around passage 60 as there were both 719 and 1262 bp bands in the PCR of passage 60, but the 1262 bp band disappeared in passage 61. It appears that the virus with deletion grows faster and quickly became the main virus in passage 61. A2MC2-P90 propagates faster with higher yield in MARC-145 cells than the wild type A2MC2. Our results are consistent with an earlier report that the spontaneous nsp2 deletion contributes to the faster virus propagation in a different strain in vitro 35 . However, the nsp2 deletion does not have an effect on PRRSV virulence for that strain in vivo.",

Nsp9 and nsp10 were found to contribute to fatal virulence of high pathogenic PRRSV strains in China 36 . There are one and three different amino acid residues in nsp9 and nsp10, respectively, between A2MC2-P90 and the wild type virus (Table 1) . Compared with moderate virulent VR-2332 and its derived avirulent MLV, these residues in the wild type A2MC2 are not unique (Supplemental Table 1 ), suggesting that their correlation with virulence is unlikely. There is no unique synonymous mutations in nsp9 and nsp10 in A2MC2-P90. It is thus unknown which nucleotide mutations contribute to the attenuation of A2MC2, possibly a combined effect of the multiple mutations has to be considered. Among the 35 nucleotide mutations of A2MC2-P90 in comparison with the wild type A2MC2, only nt13011 is the same as in the MLV but different from VR-2332, leading to serine in both A2MC2-P90 and the MLV, and glycine in strains A2MC2 and VR-2332. The significance of this one amino acid variation between both moderate virulent strains and their avirulent descendants is not known and may need to be investigated. A2MC2-P90 virus replicates faster in MARC-145 cells by inducing larger plaques and having higher titer of virus yield. It appears that A2MC2-P90 virus is less sensitive to the interferons it induces, as it replicates well when the cells are inoculated at an MOI of 1, while the wild type replicates poorly at this amount of inoculum 15 . This indicates that A2MC2-P90 virus has been adapted to the cells and may gain the ability to dampen the interferon-activated antiviral response.",
