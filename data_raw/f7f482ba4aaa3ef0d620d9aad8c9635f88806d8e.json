However, no clear evidence has been found linking autophagy to the formation of these DMVs. In this study, we evaluated the role of the autophagy elongation complex (ATG5-12/16L1) in HCV replication and MW formation. Using a dominant negative form of ATG12 and an siRNA approach, we demonstrated that the ATG5-12 conjugate, but not LC3-II formation, is crucial for efficient viral replication. Furthermore, purification of HCV MW revealed the presence of ATG5-12 and ATG16L1 along with HCV nonstructural proteins. Interestingly, LC3 was not recruited along with the elongation complex to the site of viral replication. Finally, inhibition of the elongation complex, but not LC3, greatly impaired the formation of the wildtype MW phenotype. To our knowledge, this study provides the first evidence of the involvement of autophagy proteins in the formation of wild-type MWs.",

            "text": "Although autophagy can act as an anti-viral mechanism, many reports have shown that positive-strand RNA viruses, including HCV, can hijack the autophagy machinery for virion morphogenesis and viral replication [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . Several studies have shown that HCV induces autophagosome formation in vitro 9,18-21 . This finding has also been confirmed in liver biopsies obtained from patients chronically infected with HCV 22 . In addition, HCV infection has been shown to induce mitophagy, the selective removal of mitochondria, through the induction of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) and Parkin on the outer surface of the mitochondria. It has been proposed that degradation of mitochondria enhances HCV replication and suppresses cellular apoptosis 23 . Although several studies have shown that HCV infection induces autophagy by ER-stress via induction of the unfolded protein response (UPR) 20,24-27 , other studies have shown that HCV induces autophagy in a manner independent of ER-stress, through the direct interaction of viral proteins with autophagy proteins 28, 29 . Moreover, HCV-induced autophagy has been found to play a crucial role in evading host microbial defense mechanisms at the level of innate and adaptive immune responses 30 . The induction of autophagy promotes HCV replication either by enhancing protein translation 31 or via viral maturation 32 . Owing to the morphological similarities between HCV-induced DMVs and the double-membrane nature of autophagosomes, it has been proposed that autophagy plays a role in the biogenesis of viral replication compartments 7 . Importantly, Atg5 induces the formation of DMVs in embryonic stem cells 33 . In addition, a previous study conducted by our lab has shown that ATG5 interacts with the viral polymerase (NS5B) and co-localizes with NS4B, a MW-associated viral protein 34 . Another group has shown that ATG12, Beclin 1, and ATG4B are required for the establishment of viral replication 31 . However, studies on the involvement of autophagy proteins in the assembly of the MW remain elusive. In this study, we investigated the putative role of the ATG5-12/16L1 complex in the HCV replication-cycle. We found that the autophagy elongation complex (ATG5-12/16L1) is recruited at the MW, where it promotes HCV replication in an LC3-independent manner. Surprisingly, knock-down of one component of the elongation complex, ATG12, led to an aberrant MW phenotype, thus suggesting a novel role of autophagy proteins in the formation of the MW.",

            "text": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a leading cause of liver diseases, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. HCV, a member of the Flaviviridae family, is a Hepacivirus with a positive-strand RNA genome 1 . The virus replicates exclusively in the cytoplasm of the host cell. After cell entry, the 9.6 kb HCV genome is released and translated at the rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER) into a single polyprotein. This translated polyprotein is then proteolytically processed by cellular and viral proteases into 10 distinct proteins consisting of structural (core, E1, and E2) and nonstructural (p7, NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B) proteins 2 . The expression of HCV proteins results in the induction of a major rearrangement of host cell membranes, thus leading to the formation of a complex membranous compartment termed the membranous web (MW), which favors viral RNA replication and assembly 3, 4 . This massive remodeling of the host cell membrane network is associated with all positive-strand RNA viruses and is typically characterized by the generation of either convoluted membranes or double membrane vesicles (DMVs) [5] [6] [7] [8] . Importantly, the HCV-induced MW is primarily composed of DMVs thus suggesting that autophagy plays a role in the construction of the HCV replication scaffold 7,9 . Macroautophagy, referred to hereafter as autophagy, is a catabolic pathway that degrades proteins and organelles, thereby maintaining cell homeostasis and directing cell fate. During cellular stress such as amino acid starvation, autophagy is triggered, thereby forming an organelle called the autophagosome. The de novo formation of the autophagosome begins by initiation of the growth of a double-membraned phagophore that, by closing, sequesters cytoplasmic contents. The autophagosome then fuses with the lysosome, thus allowing the degradation of the intra-autophagosomal cargo by the action of lysosomal enzymes and the release of free amino acids and other products. This process is orchestrated by more than 30 autophagy-related gene (ATG) proteins and other autophagy-linked proteins 10 .",

ATG5 forms a conjugate with ATG12, but the monomeric forms of these two proteins have been shown to be nearly undetectable under normal conditions 35 . We first tested whether this conjugation occurs in HCV-infected cells. The assessment of the ATG5 protein by western blotting showed that monomeric ATG5 (32 kDa) was undetectable in both infected and uninfected cells. ATG5 was detected only in the ATG5-12-conjugated form (55 kDa) (Fig. 1A) . Infection with HCV JFH1 strain was confirmed by detecting HCV NS3 protein using anti-NS3 antibody (Fig. 1A) . The difficulty in detecting unconjugated ATG5 suggested that the majority of the ATG5 is readily conjugated to ATG12 in Huh7 cells, as has previously been reported for other cell types 36 . In addition, HCV infection did not inhibit this conjugation. Furthermore, HCV infection induced LC3-II accumulation (Fig. 1A) .

This mutated form of the ATG12 protein lacks the C-terminal glycine, which is crucial for conjugation with ATG5 39 . Interestingly, the overexpression of this conjugation-defective mutant had an adverse effect on HCV lifecycle, as indicated by a decrease in the NS3 protein (Fig. 1C) , as well as the viral RNA level (Fig. 1D ), as compared with the levels in mock-treated cells. The specificity of the effect of ATG12DN overexpression was assessed by trans-complementation with wild-type ATG12. As expected, trans-complementation with ATG12 restored the normal level of replication (Fig. 1C,D) . Altogether, these results suggest that the ATG5-12 conjugate, rather than the monomeric form of the ATG5 and ATG12 proteins, acts as an HCV proviral factor. The ATG5-12 conjugate is involved in the HCV lifecycle at a post-translational step. The conjugation of ATG12 to lysine 130 of ATG5 is mediated by ATG7, an E1-like enzyme, thus allowing the formation of the ATG5-12/16L1 complex. A fraction of the ATG5-12/16L1 complex localizes to the isolation membrane, where it facilitates LC3 lipidation. Another role of ATG7, along with ATG3, an E2-like enzyme, is to activate LC3 after its processing at the C-terminus by ATG4B, thus allowing its conjugation to the amino group of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and formation of the membrane-associated LC3-II, which assists in the expansion and closure of the autophagosome 40, 41 . Therefore, silencing of ATG7 allows the inhibition of LC3-II and ATG5-12 conjugation (Fig. 2B) . Thus, by silencing LC3, ATG7 or ATG12, we were able to analyze the independent contributions of the two autophagy conjugation systems in the HCV lifecycle. For this purpose, we first determined the efficiency of the selected siRNA to knock down their respective targets ( Fig. 2A ,B,C). We then analyzed the effects of the silencing of ATG12, LC3 or ATG7 on HCV entry, viral RNA translation/replication and virion maturation and secretion. As shown in Fig. 2D , Huh7 infection by HCVpp was not altered in cells treated with siRNA against LC3, ATG7 or ATG12, thus suggesting that neither LC3 nor the ATG5-12 conjugate is involved in viral entry.",

            "text": "Previously, Dreux and colleagues have reported that HCV RNA translation is affected by inhibition of LC3 conjugation using siRNA against ATG4B. In that report, the authors followed the luciferase activity expressed from a replication-defective subgenomic replicon RLuc/SGR harboring an inactivation mutation (GDD to GND) at the active site of the HCV polymerase NS5B (RLuc/SGR-GND) 31 . Using a similar approach, we evaluated the effects of LC3, ATG7 and ATG12 silencing on viral RNA translation and/or replication. We used full-length HCV JFH1 RNA with a firefly luciferase reporter containing the GND mutation in the active site of NS5B (JFH1/Fluc-GND) and then analyzed the Fluc activity expressed from the HCV internal ribosomal entry site (IRES). A significant decrease in luciferase activity (> 80%) was observed in JFH1/Fluc-GND-transfected cells pretreated with siLC3 ( Fig. 2E) . Silencing of ATG7, which inhibits LC3-II formation as well as ATG5-12 conjugation, decreased viral translation by 50%. This effect probably occurred through the inhibition of LC3-II conjugation, because silencing of ATG12 expression was much less efficient than LC3 silencing at inhibiting viral RNA translation (Fig. 2E ). In contrast, silencing of ATG12 severely affected the luciferase activity of a replication competent JFH1/Fluc wild-type virus. The effect on replication was not due to the toxicity of siRNA treatment (Fig. S1 ), thus suggesting that the ATG5-12 conjugate is involved in an HCV lifecycle step(s) beyond entry and RNA translation (Fig. 2E ), whereas LC3 expression and/or conjugation is primarily important for viral translation, as previously suggested 31 . assessed by western blotting in mock (UI) or Huh7 cells infected at more than 90% with JFH1 using specific anti-ATG5 antibody. HCV infection and LC3 lipidation were detected using anti-NS3 and anti-LC3 antibodies, respectively. \u03b2 -actin represents loading control. (B) Uninfected or JFH1-infected Huh7 cells at more than 90% were transiently transfected with a plasmid encoding for Flag-ATG12 protein. Two days later, cells were lysed and ATG12 was immunoprecipitated using anti-Flag antibody or IgG as a control followed by western blot analysis using anti-Flag and anti-ATG16L1. (C) Huh7 cells were infected with JFH1 (> 90% infected) before being transfected with control (mock), Flag-ATG12, GFP-ATG5, Flag-ATG12DN or Flag-ATG12 and Flag-ATG12DN encoding plasmids.

            "text": "To determine whether LC3 or the ATG5-12 conjugate modulates HCV RNA replication, we analyzed the effects of silencing these autophagy genes on viral RNA replication in Huh7 cells stably expressing the JFH1 subgenomic replicon (SGR). Using these specific cells, which are capable of only intracellular HCV RNA replication and lacked the capacity to produce infectious viral particles, allowed us to study HCV RNA replication independently of viral entry and egress. Again, silencing of ATG12 but not LC3 efficiently inhibited RNA replication, thus supporting the role of the ATG5-12 conjugate in viral replication and ruling out the possibility that LC3 participates in viral replication (Fig. 3A,B) . Because silencing of LC3 expression led to a clear inhibition of HCV RNA translation after electroporation of the viral RNA but did not significantly affect replication in JFH1-SGR cells, we sought to compare the effect of siRNA treatment before and after infection with HCVcc JFH1 (Fig. 3C) . The results clearly demonstrated that siLC3 inhibited HCV only when it was transfected before infection, whereas siATG7 was effective when it was transfected before or after infection. These results suggest that LC3 is important early in infection and primarily for initial HCV RNA translation, as has previously been reported 31 . Finally, we evaluated the effects of siRNA treatment on intracellular and extracellular HCV infectious particle production in JFH1-infected cells (Fig. 3D) . These results suggested that HCV maturation and secretion was not significantly affected by siRNA treatment. Although silencing ATG12 led to a significant decrease in HCV particle formation, this effect was attributed to a severe reduction in viral replication. Collectively, ATG12 silencing and to a lesser extent ATG7 but not LC3, impaired viral replication. ATG5-12 and ATG16L1 are associated with purified MW extract. In a previous study from our lab, we have shown that ATG5 interacts with the HCV polymerase (NS5B) and co-localizes with the MW associated protein NS4B 34 . The major limitation in our ability to investigate the composition of the MW has recently been resolved by Dr. Ralf Bartenschlager's group, which has developed a method to purify the HCV MW by using HCV replicon cells harboring an HA-tag NS4B (NS4B-HA) 42 . This method allowed us to evaluate the presence of the autophagy elongation complex proteins in purified MW extract. Through this protocol, after membrane enrichment from a discontinuous sucrose gradient via ultracentrifugation, we pooled fractions that were rich in viral nonstructural proteins (fraction 3 to 7) but mostly devoid of soluble proteins (GAPDH or LC3I, fractions 8-10) (Fig. 4A) . The MW vesicles were then pulled down from pooled fractions by using a specific antibody against the HA-tag of the HCV NS4B protein. Subsequently, the MW-enriched extract was used for either western blot analysis or vesicle visualization by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As expected, HCV NS4B HA , NS3 and NS5A were readily detectable in the purified extract from NS4B HA replicon cells but not that from control untagged NS4B replicon cells (Fig. 4B) . The autophagy elongation complex proteins (ATG5-12 and ATG16L1) were also detected in the purified MW from NS4B HA replicon cells, but not in the control extract, thus indicating that the elongation complex is indeed present at the HCV replication site. In contrast, we were unable to detect LC3II in the purified MW (Fig. 4B) , thereby suggesting that LC3 is not recruited with the autophagy elongation complex to the MW. We then examined the morphology of purified membranes and compared them with ER membranes purified from a cell line expressing HA-tagged Calnexin, as previously described 42 . The results showed that almost 90% of the NS4B HA purified membranes were spherical vesicles as compared with CLNXN HA purified material, in which the majority of membranes were composed of partially collapsed large membranes (Fig. 5A,B) . Our results are in agreement with those of Paul and colleagues, who have demonstrated that most of the purified ER membranes are composed of elongated structures, as opposed to the spherical vesicles found in MW extracts 42 . Finally, the specificity of the pull-down using HA-beads was confirmed by using extracts from untagged SGR cells (Fig. 5C) . Altogether, these results indicate that at least a fraction of the autophagy elongation complex is localized in the virus-induced MW compartments.",

With this system, it has been shown that alterations in MW formation result in a clustered phenotype of HCV nonstructural proteins 43, 44 .

Under normal conditions, the NS3 and NS5A cellular distribution appeared as small punctate structures that appeared to be membrane associated (Fig. 6A,B) . Treatment with siLC3 did not alter the cellular distribution of the viral proteins, as observed by confocal microscopy ( Fig. 6A-C) . Strikingly, silencing of ATG7 or ATG12 resulted in the formation of larger protein clusters in most of the transfected cells ( Fig. 6A-C) . This effect was not due to decreased HCV protein expression level (Fig. 6D) , thus suggesting that the ATG5-12 conjugate, but not LC3, is required to obtain a wild-type MW phenotype.",

Expression of pTM-NS3-5B in cells treated with siCTL induced heterogeneous membrane alterations composed of DMVs of an average size of 200 nm interspersed by multi-membrane vesicles (MMVs) that were distributed throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 7A,B) and that were not seen in negative cells (Fig. 7E) . Silencing of ATG7 resulted in more homogenous DMVs with a markedly decreased average size (90 nm) and led to the disappearance of MMVs (Fig. 7A,B,D) . Silencing of ATG12 led to a similar effect but with a much lower abundance of DMVs (Fig. 7C) . However, silencing of LC3 had no effect on the DMV size (average diameter 200 nm) (Fig. 7B) or on the vesicle types in which both DMVs and MMVs coexist (Fig. 7C,D) . Thus, a similar morphology of membrane alterations was observed in siCTL-treated cells (Fig. 7A,B) . These results strongly suggest that the ATG5-12 conjugate is crucial for the formation of a typical HCV-induced MW architecture.",

            "text": "In the present study, we demonstrated the requirement of the ATG5-12/16L1 complex for the completion of the HCV lifecycle. HCV infection does not hamper ATG12 conjugation to ATG5 or the formation of the multimeric complex ATG5-12/16L1 (Fig. 1A,B) . In contrast, the conjugation of ATG12 to ATG5 is crucial for the HCV lifecycle. More specifically, our study suggests a role of the ATG5-12/16L1 complex in HCV genome replication and the formation of the MW. The involvement of the autophagy elongation complex in the HCV replication step was investigated by using siRNA targeting of ATG7, ATG12 or LC3. Because the silencing of ATG7 is known to inhibit the conjugation of both LC3 and ATG5, we were able to address the importance of these two conjugation systems in HCV replication. Indeed, the ATG5-12 conjugate acted as a proviral factor at a step beyond entry and RNA translation but before virion maturation and secretion, as depicted in Figs 2 and 3. We also observed that silencing of LC3 interfered with HCV RNA translation after electroporation of replication-defective replicon (Fig. 2E) . These results are consistent with those of Dreux and colleagues, who have found a defect in viral RNA translation after silencing of Beclin-1 or ATG4B, thus leading to inhibition of LC3-II formation 31 . Silencing of ATG12 had little effect on replication-deficient virus but was detrimental to the replication of the JFH1/Fluc virus, thus indicating that its primary target is beyond the translation step (Fig. 2E) . This result was further confirmed in cells stably expressing the JFH1 subgenomic replicon, in which silencing of ATG7 or ATG12, but not LC3, significantly inhibited HCV replication (Fig. 3A,B) . Silencing of LC3 impeded HCV only when performed before infection, thus suggesting that the ATG5-12 conjugate, but not LC3, is important in viral replication after the establishment of infection (Fig. 3C ).",

            "text": "In addition, the co-purification of the elongation complex proteins with the MW suggested that the ATG5-NS5B interaction previously described by our laboratory 34 might actually participate in targeting of the elongation complex to the MW and/or in supplying of autophagic isolation membranes for the formation of the virus-induced vesicles. In canonical autophagy, the ATG5-12/16L1 complex is recruited to the isolation membrane prior to LC3 and is released just before the completion of autophagosomes. The absence of LC3 in the purified MW suggests that HCV either hijacks ATG5-12/16L1-positive LC3-negative isolation membranes or initiates the de novo formation of the isolation membrane at the MW rather than utilizing LC3-positive autophagosomes for the formation of DMVs within the MW (Fig. 4) . Interestingly, the recruitment of the elongation complex to the MW was not accompanied by LC3 lipidation or its relocation at that site. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the ATG5-12/16L1 complex has a membrane-tethering activity that is independent of LC3 45, 46 . This finding highlights the possibility that in HCV infected cells the major role of the elongation complex is to tether vesicles during MW formation. Concomitantly, it has been reported that some ATG proteins, including ATG16L1, can traffic in LC3-free vesicle-like structures to the site where they probably act to generate de novo isolation membranes 47 . This finding also raises the possibility that HCV may recruit similar structures that aid in the formation of the MW.",

Furthermore, the morphology of the HCV-induced vesicles was severely altered after silencing of ATG7 or ATG12, but not LC3. Notably, knocking down ATG12 decreased the size and the number of DMVs, whereas silencing of ATG7 mainly affected their size (Fig. 7) .

For the determination of intra-and extracellular virus titers, JFH1-infected Huh7 cells were reverse transfected with siRNA in 6-well plates. Two days later, the cells were washed three times with PBS and supplemented with fresh DMEM. After 24 h, cells and supernatants were harvested. The cells were washed twice with PBS, trypsinized, resuspended in 1 ml culture medium and subjected to 3 rapid freeze-thaw cycles in a dry ice/ethanol bath and 37 \u00b0C water bath, respectively. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 3 minutes. Samples were analyzed using a limiting dilution assay.",
