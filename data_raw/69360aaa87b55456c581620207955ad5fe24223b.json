Transient protonation of a universally conserved carboxylate on subunit c (D61 in E. coli) gated by the electrostatic interaction with arginine on subunit a (R210 in E. coli) is believed to be a crucial step in proton transfer across the membrane. We used a fusion protein consisting of subunit a and the adjacent helices of subunit c to test by NMR spectroscopy if cD61 and aR210 are involved in an electrostatic interaction with each other, and found no evidence of such interaction. We have also determined that R140 does not form a salt bridge with either D44 or D124 as was suggested previously by mutation analysis. Our results demonstrate the potential of using arginines as NMR reporter groups for structural and functional studies of challenging membrane proteins.",

Among more than 100,000 entries in PDB, there are only about 700 unique structures of membrane proteins. Therefore methods that probe the local structure remain important, in addition to X-ray crystallography and cryoelectron microscopy, which can yield high-resolution structures of the entire membrane proteins. Among these methods, solution NMR is particularly informative due to its ability to resolve signals of chemically distinct atoms in the protein. Complete protein structure determination by NMR requires resonance assignment of most hydrogen, carbon and nitrogen nuclei in the protein molecule. Although several structures of polytopic \u03b1-helical membrane proteins, such as disulfide oxidoreductase DsbB 1 and sensory rhodopsin 2 , have been solved by NMR, in general, such proteins are very difficult targets for NMR structure determination in solution due to the detrimental effects of fast relaxation in detergent micelles and chemical shift degeneracy. Fortunately, NMR spectroscopy can provide useful, if limited, structural information, even in the situations where only few resonances can be assigned. In the present work, we used NMR to probe the structural and functional role of arginine residues in subunit a of ATP synthase.",

When the enzyme is generating ATP, protons enter through the half-channel leading from the periplasmic side of the membrane to the carboxyl group of an aspartate or glutamate residue located on helix II of subunit c, within the hydrophobic slab of the membrane. As the subunit c ring rotates around the normal to the plane of the membrane, this carboxyl group shuttles the proton, almost full circle, from the entry half-channel to the exit half-channel, which leads to the cytoplasm, in the case of bacterial cells, or to the mitochondrial matrix in eukaryotic cells. Deprotonation of the rotor carboxyl group (cD61 in E. coli) and proton release into the exit half-channel is believed to be facilitated by the electrostatic interaction with the positively charged arginine side chain on subunit a (aR210 in E. coli) [19] [20] [21] (Fig. 1B) . However, the exact role of the essential arginine on subunit a remains uncertain. It also remains unknown, if the sidechains of R210 and D61 in E. coli (and the corresponding residues in the other organisms) come sufficiently close to each other during the rotor movement for the electrostatic interaction, as postulated by this model. We used a model protein consisting of subunits a and c linked together in the correct transmembrane topology 22 to probe the relative positions of aR210 and cD61 by solution NMR. We also tested the previously proposed role of aR140 in stabilizing the structure of subunit a. Our work demonstrates the use of arginine side chains as reporter groups for NMR studies of the membrane proteins that are not amenable to complete structure determination by NMR.",

Based on the mutation analysis, residues R140 and D124 were proposed to stabilize the structure of subunit a by forming a salt bridge with each other 24 , with D44 possibly forming another salt bridge contributing to the stability of the R140-D124 one. The R140 is located in a loop region that is not well resolved in the EM structure of subunit a, and thus this structural feature still remained in question. Since chemical shifts are strongly influenced by the proximity of electrostatic charges, disruption of the putative salt bridge by mutating D124 or D44 to asparagine should change the chemical shifts of the guanidinium group in R140 side chain. However, neither D44N, nor D124N mutation had any significant effect on R140 chemical shift (Fig. 3 ).",

Guanidinium groups in the arginine residues have high pK a values, above 12.0, whereas carboxyl groups in the aspartate sidechains in proteins have pK a = 3.5 \u00b1 1.2, although values as low as 0.5 and as high as 9.2 have been reported 25, 26 . Thus a change in the ionization state of an aspartate sidechain should influence the chemical shift of an interacting arginine. We conducted pH titration in the range pH 4.3-8.0, limited by the sample stability at the lower end and high proton chemical exchange rate at the upper end of the range. Neither R140, nor R210 sidechain signals showed any chemical shift pH-dependence in this range, but the signal of one of the other two arginine residues, either R24 or R61, experienced major secondary shift (Figs 4 and 5), consistent with titration of an ionizable group with pK a of about 5.5 or below. There are no aspartate or glutamate residues in the proximity of R61, but there is an aspartate (D22) located just two residues away from R24. Titration of the D22 side chain is the likely cause of the observed changes in the arginine signal, which, on this basis, we provisionally assigned to R24. In summary, these results led us to conclude that R140 is not involved in a salt bridge with either D124, or any other residue in subunit a, and the disruptive effects of the D44 and D124 mutations must have a different explanation. The pH-dependent chemical shift R24 validates using pH-titration to detect potential electrostatic interactions involving arginine side chains.",

This was the first indication that the aspartate residues D303 and D393 corresponding to the essential D61 residues in the two copies of subunit c, are not in the immediate proximity of the R210 sidechain in the a-c/2-c protein. We then conducted pH-titration by NMR in the range 4.5-7.8, and did not observe any secondary shift of R210 (Fig. 6 ). This is significant because the pK a of cD61 was previously determined to be 7.1 28 , within the range covered by titration. This unusually high value likely reflects the hydrophobic environment of this residue. Taken together, these results indicate that in the a-c/2-c protein, the residues corresponding to D61 of subunit c and R210 of subunit a are not sufficiently close for a strong electrostatic interaction between the sidechains, certainly outside the distance range for a salt bridge formation between the side chains. This result is consistent with the cryo-EM structure of the F 0 complex of the mitochondrial ATP synthase from yeast 29 , the first structure of the complete F 0 complex that has sufficient resolution to accurately determine positions of the side chains of the essential residues on subunits a and c. In this structure, the R176 on subunit a and the nearest E59 on subunit c, corresponding to aR210 and cD61 in the E. coli ATP synthase, are still too far for salt bridge formation. This appears also to be true for E. coli ATP synthase 30 (Fig. 1A) , although the latter structure does not have sufficient resolution to visualize side chains of aR210 and cD61.",

Since the a-c/2-c protein, by design, covalently links the rotor and the stator components, it is not possible to validate correct folding of the protein by measuring ATP-driven H + -translocation in the membrane. Still, our previous work offers several pieces of evidence that the a-c/2-c protein correctly recapitulates the interface between subunit a, and the two copies of the c subunit in the native ATP synthase 22 . Although subunit c is required for incorporation of subunit a into the membrane, the L31F and G23D subunit c mutants, which do not assemble into the rings, support normal incorporation of subunit a, presumably through the formation of ac or ac 2 complexes. Importantly, unlike subunit a by itself, the a-c/2-c protein incorporates into the lipid membrane in the absence of subunit c. Expressed in the context of the complete atp operon together with subunit c, the a-c/2-c protein supports normal assembly of ATP synthase, and the various transmembrane helices of the a-c/2-c protein correctly incorporate into the stator and into the rotor linking them together (Fig. 1D) and maintaining tight coupling between the F 0 and F 1 components of the rotor. In contrast, the a-c protein, which lacks one of the transmembrane helices derived from subunit c, and therefore has incorrect transmembrane topology, does not properly incorporate into the F 0 complex 22 . Taken together, these results suggest that the native a-c interactions are preserved in the a-c/2-c protein, and that the assembled c-ring is not required for the proper folding of the stator-rotor interface region in ATP synthase.",

Moreover, proton translocation is restored, when subunits a, b, and c are purified individually, following F 0 dissociation with chaotropic agents 31 or organic solvents 32, 33 , and then recombined and reconstituted in liposomes. These observations suggest that the native a-c interactions in the F 0 complex, and, by extension, in the a-c/2-c protein, are stable, not easily disrupted by detergents, and do not depend on the presence of specific lipids. To further reduce probability of protein denaturation, in our experiments we have used lysophosphatidyl glycerol (1-myristoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-rac-(1-glycerol)], LMPG), which structurally closely resembles natural phospholipids. This detergent has been previously tested in the NMR studies of membrane proteins, including subunit c of ATP synthase 23 , and, recently, coronavirus E channel 34 , among others, and produced spectra indicative of structurally homogeneous, well folded proteins. Conceivably, solid state NMR in lipid environment could be used to further corroborate our results in the future.",

Although the proximity of these two residues and their universal conservation in ATP synthases seem to make the idea of salt bridge attractive, it would create a kinetic obstacle for the rotary mechanism of ion transport in ATP synthase. The low dielectric constant within the hydrophobic environment at the rotor-stator interface potentiates the electrostatic interactions, and the activation energy of breaking the salt bridge at each rotational step would be very high. If the role of the stator arginine is indeed to facilitate deprotonation of the proton-shuttling carboxyl on the rotor, a weaker electrostatic interaction at a longer distance between the two residues may be sufficient. Alternatively, the role of the stator arginine may be simply to prevent the backflow of protons up the exit channel by creating electrostatic repulsion between the positively charged arginine and the positively charged protons (or hydronium ions).",

(A) Fragment of E. coli ATP synthase structure (PDB ID 5T4P) including subunit a (orange) and the two adjacent copies of subunit c (green). The arginine residues in subunit a are in blue (R24 is not present in the structure), and the aspartate residues in subunits a and c discussed in the text are in red (aD22 is absent from the structure). (B) Model of proton translocation in the membrane component of ATP synthase. Subunit a (orange) with the gating residue R210, and the c-ring (c 10 , green) with D61 on each c subunit are shown. Proton binds to the D61 carboxyl group of the c-subunit arriving at the exit of the periplasmic half-channel as the rotor turns in the direction shown by the arrow. Following an almost full turn of the rotor, this D61 releases the proton into the cytoplasmic half-channel. (C) Design of the fusion protein incorporating subunits a and c of ATP synthase (a-c/2-c). (D) Incorporation of the a-c/2-c protein into the F 0 -complex. The c subunits are in blue, the a-c/2-c protein is in green and orange, with transmembrane helices numbered with Roman numerals as for individual a and c subunits.

Signals of all four arginine side chain signals in subunit a are labeled. Note that the actual 15 N chemical shifts of the arginine N\u03b5 are given by the formula \u03b4 = \u03b4 obs \u2212 SW N(ppm) , where \u03b4 is the true chemical shift, \u03b4 obs is the observed chemical shift, and SW N(ppm) is the sweep width in the 15 N dimension, expressed in p.p.m. (40 p.p.m. in our experiments). With the 15 N frequency offset and sweep width commonly used in protein 1 H, 15 N-HSQC experiments, arginine HN\u03b5 signals appear in an uncrowded region of the spectrum and with an opposite sign to the backbone amides, allowing easy identification of the former.
