            "text": "Safety is an important consideration in AD vaccine development given cases of aseptic meningoencephalitis observed previously in the AN-1792 clinical trials and likely associated with autoreactive T cell infiltration into the brains of vaccinated subjects 9 . To avoid this risk, we have developed the MultiTEP vaccine platform that consists of a string of 12 non-self, pathogen-derived T helper (Th) epitopes 10 , to which we can attach different B cell self-epitopes from neuronal proteins involved in AD pathogenesis. Previously we have demonstrated that a DNA vaccine composed of three copies of a B cell epitope from the N-terminal region of A\u03b2 (A\u03b2 [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] attached to the MultiTEP protein (AV-1959D) was highly immunogenic in mice 10, 11 , rabbits 12 and macaques 10, 13 . To develop a vaccine targeting pathological tau we decided to use the same immunogenic MultiTEP platform incorporating the tau 2-18 epitope. We chose this epitope because it was previously shown that tau [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] is normally hidden in microtubule bound tau conformation but becomes highly exposed during tau aggregation 14, 15 . Importantly, this region of tau, also termed the phosphatase-activating domain (PAD), plays an important role in activation of a signaling cascade involving PP1 and GSK-3 that leads to dissociation of cargo from kinesins and therefore anterograde fast axonal transport (FAT) inhibition. The exposure of PAD that is required for inhibition of FAT might be regulated by PAD phosphorylation, as well as by the N-terminal truncation of tau that occurs during neurofibrillary tangle formation. Phosphorylation of Y18 as well as truncation of the N-terminal region of aggregated tau has been suggested to remove the toxic region and have a protective role [14] [15] [16] [17] . Thus, we hypothesized that anti-tau 2-18 antibodies will preferentially recognize pathological rather than normal forms of tau, and thereby prevent its aggregation and PAD mediated toxicity during the early stages of tauopathy.",

Analysis of antibody isotypes specific for A\u03b2 showed that Alhydrogel \u00ae , Advax TM , Montanide-ISA51 and -ISA720 adjuvants induced primarily an IgG1 (Th2) response, whereas Advax CpG , MPLA and Quil-A shifted the response toward IgG2a b , a Th1 response associated isotype (Figs 1b and S1). To further explore adjuvant effects on Th1 and Th2 phenotype, we measured the numbers of splenocytes producing IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 cytokines by ELISpot (spot-forming cells, SFC) and found that the Advax CpG group produced significantly higher frequencies of IFN-\u03b3 + and IL-4 + Th cells than the other adjuvant groups (Fig. 2a,b) . The TLR4 agonist, MPLA was the only other GMP-grade adjuvant that generated significant numbers of both IFN-\u03b3 + and IL-4 + Th cells, although these were approximately 5 and 1.5 times, respectively, lower than those induced with Advax CpG (Fig. 2a,b) . Calculation of the ratio of IL-4/IFN-\u03b3 positive Th cells (Fig. 2c ) supported the antibody isotypes data and confirmed that Advax CpG was the strongest combined Th1 and Th2 adjuvant followed by MPLA, while other adjuvants only generated primarily Th2 responses to immunizations with AV-1959R. The level of Th1 responses induced by the control adjuvant, Quil-A were comparable to MPLA, but significantly lower than in Advax CpG (Figs 1 and 2) . Finally, Advax CpG was also well tolerated by all animals with no evidence of either local or systemic vaccine adverse reactions. On the basis of these data, Advax CpG was selected as the sole adjuvant for all subsequent studies with MultiTEP-based AD vaccines targeting A\u03b2 , tau, or A\u03b2 /tau simultaneously or sequentially.",

Of note, no potentially harmful autoreactive Th cells were detected after re-stimulation of immune splenocytes with A\u03b2 or tau self-epitopes, either by ELISpot or splenocytes proliferation assay (data not shown).

As expected, immunization with AV-1980R did not generate anti-A\u03b2 antibodies (Fig. 4a) .

These antibody response patterns were mirrored by the frequency of antibody secreting B cells (ASC); numbers of anti-A\u03b2 ASC were similar in mice immunized with single or combined vaccine formulations, while the numbers of anti-tau ASC were significantly lower in mice vaccinated with the dual-epitope AV-1953R vaccine (Fig. 5) .",

The modeling data suggested that on AV-1980R, two of three tau epitopes are linear with the side chains of the critical amino acid residues accessible on the surface (Fig. 6a,d) , while in AV-1959R, all three A\u03b2 epitopes are linear with the side chains of the critical amino acid residues accessible on the surface (Fig. 6b,e) . On AV-1953R, two out of three A\u03b2 and two out of three tau epitopes are linear, however, only side chains of A\u03b2 , but not critical tau amino acid residues are easily accessible (Fig. 6c,f) . Hence, changes in the epitope structure in combination with alterations in the side chain accessibility of critical residues in the epitopes may have led to the reduced anti-tau immunogenicity of the AV-1953R dual-epitope construct.",

All the above vaccines are based on our universal MultiTEP vaccine platform that is based on a string of Th foreign epitopes which, as shown in monkeys, can stimulate immune responses in a broad population of subjects with high MHC class II gene polymorphisms 10 . Notably, the universal MultiTEP platform may allow using two vaccines targeting A\u03b2 and tau at early and late stages of the disease, respectively. At the initiation of anti-tau immunotherapy AD patient immunized previously with anti-A\u03b2 vaccine would have large numbers of MultiTEP-specific memory Th cells and hence will rapidly generate therapeutic concentrations of antibodies. To simulate this situation, we immunized mice with AV-1959R formulated in Advax CpG or injected with Advax CpG only (control) and both groups were boosted with vaccine targeting tau B cell epitope, AV-1980R. Boosting of AV-1959R vaccinated mice with AV-1980R, but not sham-injected mice, induced significantly higher cellular (Fig. 8a) and humoral (Fig. 8b) immune responses, thus proving the synergistic effect of sequential immunization with different MultiTEP vaccines. .

            "text": "Scientific RepoRts | 6:28912 | DOI: 10.1038/srep28912 Discussion AD is the most common cause of dementia, and worldwide nearly 46 million people have Alzheimer's or related dementias and this number is estimated to increase to 131.5 million by 2050 27 . Currently, the majority of neuroscientists agree that the optimal targets for AD immunotherapy are pathological forms of A\u03b2 and tau. The relationship between these molecules in progression of AD pathology is still controversial, with the majority of data supporting A\u03b2 aggregation being the primary event in AD pathogenesis, secondarily triggering production of pathological tau [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] . Nonetheless, accumulation of pathological tau in the brains correlates with dementia in AD patients. Thus, by the time clinical symptoms appear, there is already substantial tau pathology in the brains 34, 35 . Therefore, we propose that anti-A\u03b2 immunotherapy should be initiated at the early stages of AD to minimize synaptic and neuronal loss, while anti-tau immunotherapy may be most effective when disease progression is more advanced 33 . Thus we have decided to generate vaccines that will target pathological molecules either sequentially (e.g. A\u03b2 vaccinations followed by tau vaccination) or simultaneously (mixture of A\u03b2 plus tau vaccines, or dual-epitope vaccine containing both A\u03b2 and tau B cell epitopes). Importantly, although clinical data from anti-tau immunotherapy are not currently available, results from anti-A\u03b2 active and passive vaccination trials suggest that only relatively high concentrations of antibodies are therapeutically potent 9, [30] [31] [32] [33] 36 . Therefore, to enhance immune response in elderly patients with immunosenescence 37 we have developed recombinant protein-based A\u03b2 and tau, or dual-epitope vaccines by fusing relevant epitopes of these pathological proteins with our MultiTEP platform which is composed of 12 foreign Th cell epitopes, which are the promiscuous PADRE epitope, epitopes from Tetanus Toxin (P23, P32, P21, P30, P2, P7, P17 and P28), Hepatitis B (HBVnc & HBsAg), and influenza virus (MT) 10 . We hypothesized that this should provide a broad coverage of human MHC class II polymorphism utilizing the wide array of tetanus toxin, hepatitis B and influenza Th epitopes incorporated into the MultiTEP platform. We have previously shown that MultiTEP platform-based DNA vaccine targeting A\u03b2 [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] was immunogenic in mice, rabbits, and in monkeys with highly polymorphic MHC class II genes [10] [11] [12] [13] . Here we further suggested that the same MultiTEP platform used for two different recombinant protein-based vaccines targeting A\u03b2 and tau could be beneficial because Th cells activated by AV-1959R will generate strong Th memory cells and will facilitate rapid production of anti-tau antibodies in the future vaccination/s of the same organism with the anti-tau vaccine, AV-1980R. In this study we report for the first time on the immunogenicity of vaccines targeting A\u03b2 , tau or both pathological molecules simultaneously or sequentially.",

In the AN-1792 trials a substantial portion of vaccinated subjects were non-responders, even though the strong QS21 adjuvant was used 31, 38 . Thus, the first aim of this study was to identify an optimal adjuvant for use in future AD vaccine trials. Figures 1 and 2 clearly demonstrate that Advax CpG formulated with AV-1959R vaccine provided significantly higher Th cell and anti-A\u03b2 antibody responses than any other adjuvant approved for human use or tested in clinical trials. Moreover, Advax CpG enhanced both Th2 and Th1 immune responses as reflected by the highest induction of not only IgG1, but also IgG2a b antibody isotype. Antibodies of the IgG2a b isotype exhibit the highest level of Fc effector function, which may provide the utmost efficiency in AD immunotherapy 39 , and the acute pro-inflammatory responses (IFN-\u03b3 + SFC) generated by AV-1959R formulated with Advax CpG could be beneficial for AD treatment as well, since TLR4 agonist MPLA reduced A\u03b2 load in the brain of mice and enhanced cognitive function 40 . Finally, MultiTEP-based vaccine design is anticipated to be safe, because Th epitopes in this platform are all foreign and are not expressed in the brain.",

Importantly, a pandemic influenza vaccine formulated with Advax \u2122 was effective in human subjects up to 90 years of age, enhancing anti-influenza plasmablast and antibody responses across the whole age spectrum 24 . The ability of this delta-inulin based adjuvant to help counter the normal age-related decline in plasmablast and antibody responses to influenza immunization is likely to be important for human AD vaccine development, as these will principally need to be administered to elderly subjects with immuno-senescence 34 .",

            "text": "As mentioned above, the difference in the timing of A\u03b2 and tau accumulation 34 and their different roles in the onset and progression of AD, suggest that sequential vaccinations with A\u03b2 and tau vaccines, or even combined vaccine against both molecules might represent the most effective AD approach. In particular, the same vaccine platform could be used to both prevent the onset of AD [41] [42] [43] [44] , and also slow down development of tauopathy-associated dementia 32, [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] . In order to utilize such an approach we have developed three MultiTEP platform-based vaccines targeting A\u03b2 , tau or both molecules simultaneously. All MultiTEP-based vaccines formulated with Advax CpG induce strong cellular and humoral (concentrations of antibody and numbers of ASC) immune responses (Figs 4 and 5) . Co-immunizations with AV-1959R and AV-1980R vaccines provided high antibody titers against A\u03b2 and tau epitopes, respectively and these humoral immune responses did not differ from results of immunization with single AV-1980R or AV-1959R vaccines. However, the AV-1953R dual vaccine demonstrated significantly decreased anti-tau humoral immune responses compared with mice immunized with AV-1980R or a mixture of AV-1980R and AV-1959R vaccines (Figs 4 and 5) . These decreases in antibody titers and numbers of ASC were not associated with insufficient Th cell stimulation by AV-1953R vs AV-1980R/ AV-1959R, since the Th cell responses did not differ significantly between these groups (Fig. 3) . This suggested that the three copies of tau 2-18 B cell epitope in the MultiTEP vaccine might not be adequately presented on the surface of the folded AV-1953R or AV-1980R protein. In the absence of crystal structures, we performed an in silico approach to create structural models of the MultiTEP-based proteins that were further optimized using Scientific RepoRts | 6:28912 | DOI: 10.1038/srep28912 molecular dynamic simulation. From the 3D in silico models of these vaccines it appears that tau 2-18 epitopes may have a less optimal presentation on the surface of AV-1953R dual vaccine than on the AV-1980R single one (Fig. 6) . These subtle differences in the structural configuration may have played a critical role in the observed differences in the antibody titers and ASC numbers. Another possible reason could be B cell immunodominance of the A\u03b2 epitope which may suppress the maturation of tau-specific B cells by competition for antigen-specific Th cells. However, this was not the case when immunization was performed with a mixture of the two vaccines containing the same Th epitopes (Fig. 5 ). In addition, we have performed experiments with increased doses of AV-1953R and did not see an increase of anti-tau antibody concentrations too (data not shown).",

Mice primed by AV-1959R responded significantly better to the booster vaccination with AV-1980R (Fig. 8a,b) . Importantly, regardless of the vaccine used (single, mixture or dual), the generated antibodies are potentially functional and bind equally well to the pathological deposits of A\u03b2 and tau in the brain sections from four AD cases (Fig. 7) .

An AD vaccine based on target epitopes attached to universal, highly immunogenic MultiTEP vaccine platform when combined with Advax CpG , a potent yet well tolerated adjuvant suitable for human use, induced extremely high antibody titers against both A\u03b2 and tau, at levels not previously achieved in other studies. The MultiTEP strategy provides a unique opportunity to generate high antibody responses in subjects by utilizing memory Th cells previously generated in the human population in response to infection or vaccination by tetanus toxin, hepatitis B and influenza. The MultiTEP platform may be especially beneficial in the elderly because the vaccine utilizes memory T cells that are in abundance in elderly patients instead of relying on activation of na\u00efve T cells, which decline with age. Therefore, the universal and highly immunogenic MultiTEP vaccine platform shows promise for both preventive and therapeutic approaches in AD.",

Briefly, soluble and insoluble fractions applied to electrophoresis on NuPAGE 4-12% Bis-Tris gel in MES buffer under reducing conditions (Invitrogen, CA) and electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (GE Healthcare, NJ). For antigen retrieval, membranes with soluble fractions were boiled in PBS at 100 \u00b0C as described in Rosen et al. 58 and then were blocked with 5% fat-free dry milk. Membranes with insoluble fractions were blocked without antigen retrieval. A\u03b2 and tau were visualized by incubating with sera from mice immunized with AV-1959R, AV-1980R, AV-1953R or mixture of AV-1959R and AV-1980R followed by HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA).
