            "text": "The carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) gene family belongs to the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily and codes for a vast number of glycoproteins that differ greatly both in amino acid composition and function. The CEA family is divided into two groups, the carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecules (CEACAMs) and the pregnancy-specific glycoproteins. The CEA family members are implicated in pleiotropic (patho)physiological functions including cell-cell adhesion, pregnancy, immunity, neovascularization, regulation of insulin homeostasis, and carcinogenesis. In general, the CEA-encoded proteins are composed of an extracellular region with Ig variable and constant-like domains and a cytoplasmic region containing signaling motifs. Of particular interest, the well-studied human and mouse CEA genes are arranged in clusters in a single chromosome. Taking into account this characteristic, we made an effort to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the CEA gene family. Toward this end, the publicly available genomes were searched extensively for CEA homologs. The domain organization of the retrieved protein sequences was analyzed, and, subsequently, comprehensive phylogenetic analyses of the entire length CEA homologous proteins were performed. A series of evolutionarily conserved amino acid residues, functionally important, were identified. The relative positioning of these residues on the modeled tertiary structure of novel CEA protein domains revealed that they are, also, spatially conserved. Furthermore, the chromosomal arrangement of CEA genes was examined, and it was found that the CEA genes are preserved in terms of position, transcriptional orientation, and number in all species under investigation.",

All currently reported CEA-encoded proteins consist of at least one Ig variable (IgV)-like domain, followed by a varying number of Ig constant (IgC)-like domains (Brummendorf and Rathjen 1995) . The core structure of these domains, the Ig-like fold, is characterized by two bsheets (faces) that cross over each other. The IgV-like domain, approximately 110 amino acids long, contains a conserved basic (arginine) and an acidic (aspartate) amino acid, which are proposed to stabilize the Ig-like fold via an intradomain salt bridge. The CFG-face of the IgV-like domain (named after the C-F-G strands it is composed of) mediates homotypic and heterotypic cell-cell adhesion (Taheri et al. 2000) . The IgC-like domain, contains two conserved cysteine residues, that occupy the corresponding positions of arginine and aspartate, stabilize the Ig-like conformation by forming a disulphide bridge (Williams and Barclay 1988; Bork et al. 1994) .",

For instance, CEACAMs play a vital role during embryonic development where cell-cell adhesion is necessary to integrate the cells into functional organs (Kuespert et al. 2006) . Members of the CEACAM group also serve as receptors of several bacterial and viral pathogens, such as the murine hepatitis virus, Haemophilus influenza, Neisseria meningitides, and N. gonorrhea, which bind CEACAM proteins via their N-terminal IgV-like domain (Bos et al. 1999; Virji et al. 1999 Virji et al. , 2000 Villullas et al. 2007 ). PSGs are secreted proteins from fetal trophoblasts, which are proposed to regulate the maternal-fetal interactions during pregnancy (Hau et al. 1985; Ha et al. 2010) . Of particular note, CEA play an important role in carcinogenesis (Scorilas et al. 2003; Michaelidou et al. 2013) . The prototypic member of this family, human CEA (henceforth referred to as CEACAM5), was discovered by Gold and Freedman (1965) in the mid-1960s in the blood of patients with colon cancer. CEACAM5 is consistently overexpressed in various malignancies frequently associated with poor patients' clinical outcome and reduced overall survival (Chevinsky 1991) . These properties have made CEACAM5 a prominent clinical cancer biomarker, widely used in early diagnosis, effective prognosis, and monitoring of colon cancer, as well as other types of cancers (Gaglia et al. 1988; Ballesta et al. 1995) .",

To this direction, the fully sequenced and the nearly complete sequenced genomes were searched for CEA homologs. Members of the CEA family were identified in diverse taxa covering an evolutionary range from cartilaginous fishes to human. Subsequently, comprehensive phylogenetic analyses were performed employing the maximum likelihood (ML) and the neighbor-net methods. The genomic arrangement of the identified CEA-related genes was also analyzed, and it was shown that in different species, these genes are arranged in contiguous clusters with conserved position and orientation of transcription. On the basis of both the phylogenetic and syntenic analyses, we identified eight conserved gene clusters. Furthermore, the protein domain organization of the CEA homologs was examined and amino acid conservation patterns were identified. The three-dimensional (3D) structure of domains from species of the basal taxonomy was predicted with homology modeling, and the evolutionarily conserved amino acids were mapped onto these structures.",

To obtain ML-based trees, the method implemented in the software package MEGA, version 5.2 (Tamura et al. 2011 ) was used. In this study, a distance-based tree (BIONJ) (Gascuel 1997) was used as seed, as well as the nearest-neighbor-interchange heuristic with five discrete gamma categories of evolutionary rates. The number of amino acid substitutions per position was estimated with the JTT model (Jones et al. 1992) . Trees were also reconstructed employing the neighbornet method (Bryant and Moulton 2004) implemented in SplitsTree v.4 (Huson 1998; Kloepper and Huson 2008) , a distance-based method able to detect conflict between phylogenetic signals in the form of networks; the Ucorrected P model of substitution was used. For both methods, bootstrap analyses (200 pseudoreplicates) were conducted to evaluate the statistical significance of the reconstructed trees. The trees generated with the ML method were illustrated with Dendroscope v.3 (Huson and Scornavacca 2012) .",

As shown in figure 5, the homologous CEA genes are arranged in clusters, with conserved sequential order, transcriptional orientation, number, and flanking genes, in all species under investigation-at least in the high-coverage genomes. We identified eight (I-VIII) conserved gene clusters in our study, which are indicated by roman numerals and numbers according to the order of their appearance in the evolutionary timetable ( fig. 5) . The \"ancestral\" Cluster I appeared first in the common ancestor of extant amniotes and contains the genes CEACAM20, CEACAM19, and CEACAM16. Cluster II was emerged in the common ancestor of extant eutherians for the first time and contains a single gene, CEACAM18. Cluster III appeared in the common ancestor of euarchontoglires and laurasiatheria for the first time (CEACAM21). Subsequent duplications of CEACAM21 have apparently given rise to CEACAM3-7 in the primate lineage. Clusters IV-VII are restricted to the glire lineage and more specifically to rodents. Cluster VIII is primate specific because it was detected only in primates. Of particular note, the CEA homologs of the New World monkeys are localized on chromosome 19. Because of incomplete genomic studies, the CEA genes of several organisms were detected in chromosomal fragments. Therefore, in this study, a CEA member was considered to be absent both if the gene was not detected and the CEA genes that flank it in the prototypic human and mouse sequential order are detected in the same chromosome, scaffold, or contig ( fig. 5 ).",

Two different methods for phylogenetic reconstruction, ML and neighbor-net, were employed to resolve better the evolutionary relationships. The trees generated with both methods are congruent as their overall topology is similar ( fig. 6 and supplementary fig. S1 , Supplementary Material online). Representative CEA sequences of selected species with complete or almost complete genomes were selected for more accurate phylogenetic analysis, using both tree construction methods ( fig. 7 and The CEACAM16, CEACAM18, CEACAM19, and CEACAM20 homologs form their own distinct clades with representatives from almost every taxonomic division (figs. 6 and 7, supplementary figs. S1 and S2, Supplementary Material online). CEACAM19 and CEACAM20 appear to be the primordial genes of the CEA family ( fig. 5 ) because they were found in the common ancestor of amniotes. However, neither CEACAM19 nor CEACAM20 orthologs were identified in prototheria (platypus) (fig. 5) ; this is probably due to incomplete genomic studies. CEACAM16 was detected for first time in prototheria, whereas CEACAM18 appeared later in evolution in the common ancestor of extant eutherians. CEACAM21 orthologs also forms a coherent clade (figs. 6 and 7, supplementary figs. S1 and S2, Supplementary Material online). Interestingly, CEACAM21, which was detected first in the order of perissodactyla and then again in the superfamily of apes ( fig. 5) , is restricted to three species, namely human, orangutan, and horse. This finding triggers the speculation that either a CEACAM21 gene may have existed in other species, which was deleted during the course of evolution, or CEACAM21 evolved independently within these three species.",

In a more recent experimental effort, several CEA-related genes were also detected in vertebrates (Chang et al. 2013) . The availability of a growing number of sequenced genomes enabled us to perform, for the first time, comprehensive phylogenetic and structural analyses of CEA. In this study, CEA members were identified in organisms from different taxonomic divisions, ranging from cartilaginous fishes to humans. An EST sequence was detected in little skate (L. erinacea), which was found to be a CEA homolog based on BLAST searches. This allowed us to trace the evolutionary origin of CEA approximately 450-420 Ma when chondrichthyes emerged (Venkatesh et al. 2014) . A large number of CEA members were detected in teleosts, frog, platypus, opossum, elephant, armadillo, dog, and horse without any homologs from other species, suggesting lineage/species-specific gene amplification. PSG homologs were detected exclusively in the superorder of euarchontoglires (primates and rodents), which have hemochorial placentae (Carter and Enders 2004) and not in other mammalian orders with different type of placentation such as epitheliochorial or endotheliochorial (Zeiler et al. 2007 ). On the basis of this finding, we could suggest that PSGs have expanded after the radiation of euarchontoglires to perform functions related to the hemochorial mode of placentation.",

A prominent feature of the CEA gene family is that it consists of clusters of genes with conserved order and orientation, mapped to a single chromosome, in all species. On the basis of both syntenic and phylogenetic analyses, we identified a total of eight (I-VIII) conserved gene clusters, the first one appearing for first time in the common ancestor of amniotes. Moreover, the flanking non-CEA genes such as Grik5, PVR, SIGLECs, and IGSF23 are also conserved with the same order and position in all organisms under study. Given that shared synteny is likely associated with function (Wang et al. 2008 ), we suggest that these genes may have evolved along with CEA to complement CEA's function.",

This observation leads to the suggestion that evolutionary pressure could have applied to ITAM and ITIM, motifs exerting opposing signaling effects (activating vs. inhibitory), to coevolve (Kammerer and Zimmermann 2010) . In particular, recognition of bacterial pathogens by CEACAM3 results to phosporylation of its ITAM by protein kinases of the Src family; in turn, a signal transduction pathway is initiated that leads to bacterial engulfment and killing (Hauck et al. 1998; McCaw et al. 2003) . On the other hand, it was shown that the presence of the ITIM of CEACAM1 was essential to suppress adaptive immune response upon bacterial infection of the genus Neisseria (Boulton and Gray-Owen 2002) . Moreover, CEACAM1, as opposed to CEACAM3, acts as a tumor suppressor, shown to inhibit the growth of prostate, colon, and breast tumors (Estrera et al. 2001; Volpert et al. 2002; Sappino et al. 2012) . The ITIM could presumably account for CEACAM1's tumor suppressive properties. In this study, an ITAM was also detected in the cytoplasmic tail of CEACAM19, which is overexpressed in several types of cancer (Scorilas et al. 2003; Michaelidou et al. 2013) . The oncogenic potential of CEACAM19 may, at least partially, depend on the presence of the ITAM. Further experimental studies could probably verify the signaling regulatory role of ITAM/ITIM in various cellular activities.",

The residues arginine and aspartate that form a salt bridge are shown as a balland-stick representation. (B) The conserved proteins motifs derived from the IgV-like domain. The amino acid residue numbers (according to human CEACAM1) are indicated. The invariant residues arginine and aspartate are indicated by dots. The letters, representing amino acid residues of the motif sequences, are piled one on top of another at every position in the sequences. The height of each letter is proportional to the frequency of the corresponding amino acid at that position; the letters are ordered, so the most frequent one is on the top. The height of the whole pile is normalized, so that it indicates the information content (measured in bits) in each position.",
