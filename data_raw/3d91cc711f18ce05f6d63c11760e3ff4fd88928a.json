The recent elucidation of the genome, proteome and transcriptome of many of these complex pathogens provides the basis for rational vaccine design by identifying, on a proteome-wide scale, novel target antigens that are recognized by T cells and antibodies from exposed individuals. However, there is currently no algorithm to effectively identify important target antigens from genome sequence data; this is especially challenging for T cell targets. Furthermore, for some of these pathogens, such as Plasmodium, protein expression using conventional platforms has been problematic but cell-free in vitro transcription translation (IVTT) strategies have recently proved successful. Herein, we report a novel approach for proteome-wide scale identification of the antigenic targets of T cell responses using IVTT products.",

Almost all vaccines currently licensed for human use rely on antibody responses against the target pathogen. None are designed to induce protective T cell response, yet T cell responses are implicated as critical in protection against many pathogens, especially those with an intracellular stage such as the causative agents of malaria, leishmaniasis and Chagas disease [1, 2] . CD4 + T cells also play a key role in enhancing the pathogen-specific antibody responses [3] . The elucidation of the genome, proteome and transcriptome of important human pathogens, including the Plasmodium parasite, has provided a wealth of data that can potentially be mined to identify, on a proteome-wide scale, novel target antigens recognized by T cells and antibodies. However, how to effectively mine this data has proved challenging. In particular, technologies such as conventional protein expression methodologies which are well established on an individual antigen basis often cannot be translated directly to a whole proteome scale.",

These In Vitro Transcription and Translation systems (IVTT) or cell-free systems offer several advantages over traditional cell-based expression methods and are suitable for high throughput strategies due to reduced reaction volumes and process time [4, 5, 6] . Additional advantages include easy modification of reaction conditions for improving production of complex proteins, decreased sensitivity to product toxicity, and high yield. Importantly, cell-free systems have proved capable of generating proteins from complex parasites that have been difficult to produce in traditional cell-based systems, such as Plasmodium proteins [7, 8, 9, 10] . The most efficient expression to date has been achieved with an E. coli cell-free system which has yielded more than 93% efficiency of expression with a panel of 250 P. falciparum (Pf) proteins [11] . Eukaryotic based cell-free systems are also available with wheat germ, rabbit reticulocytes and insect cells. The eukaryotic lysate is considered by some to provide a better platform for production of complex proteins particularly with regard to post-translational modifications. Recently, up to 75% efficiency of production of Pf proteins in the wheat germ system has been reported [12, 13] but this is still less efficient than that observed with the E. coli system [11] .",

In that study, 180 predicted open reading frames of the vaccinia genome were expressed in the RTS system and unpurified RTS reaction products were tested for recognition by vaccinia virus-enriched T cell lines derived from 11 Dryvax smallpox vaccines, using 3 Hthymidine proliferation assays. Another study reported the use of IVTT products affinity purified on protein G-conjugated carboxylate microsphere beads to stimulate proliferative responses of polyclonal short-term T cell lines from cattle immunised with purified A. marginale outer membranes [19] . Of note, both studies used T cell lines, rather than unpurified splenocytes or bulk peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and neither reported a systematic evaluation of the T cell screening process.",

Additionally, Plasmodium yoelii circumsporozoite protein (PyCSP) [25] IVTT products were assayed for antigenicity in vitro using splenocytes from PyCSP-immunized mice, and for immunogenicity in vivo as assessed by capacity to boost a PyCSP-specific immune response primed by plasmid DNA.

An aliquot of each reaction mixture was analysed by SDS-PAGE and western blot, followed by chemiluminescence of the membrane to visualize the products formed. All four viral (FluHA, FluM, CMVpp65, EBNA3) and one parasite (PyCSP) recombinants could be produced using the manufacturer's recommended conditions. The average yield of each full-length recombinant, detected using an anti-HA antibody directed against the C-Terminal HA tag, was as follow: FluM, 1.15 mg/ml; FluHA, 0.73 mg/ml (two moles of HA tag per molecule of FLU-HA); CMVpp65, 0.7 mg/ml; EBNA3A, 4 ng/ml; and PyCSP, 0.6 mg/ml ( Figures 1A and B and Figure  S1A ). Western blot analysis using an antibody directed against the N-Terminal 6xHIS tag identified the presence of partial products for each viral recombinant (PyCSP not tested) ( Figure S1B ). Solubility analysis showed that a high proportion (at least 70%) of each recombinant was insoluble. A series of optimization studies including kinetics of expression (3 hr to 6 hr), reaction temperature (16uC, 25uC, 30uC), speed (stationary, 300 rpm, 600 rpm), addition of protease inhibitor cocktails, or addition of non-ionic detergents to promote protein solubilisation (Triton X-110 or Figure 1 . Recombinants produced using E. coli cell-free IVTT system. Western Blot and quantification of (A) viral antigens FluM, FluHA, CMVpp65 or EBNA3A and (B) parasite antigen PyCSP pIVEX HisHA IVTT products, probed with mAb against the C-terminal HA tag. Whole IVTT extracts (5 ml) of each antigen were run on a 12% NUPAGE gel, transferred to a PVDF membrane, and probed with anti-HA HRP antibody (1:500 dilution). Protein expression was quantitated against an IVTT-produced recombinant P. falciparum (PF14_0051) protein of known concentration expressing the same N-terminal 6xHis and C-terminal HA tags. Yields for each full length antigen were as follow: FluM, 1.15 mg/ ml; FluHA, 0.73 mg/ ml; CMVpp65, 0.7 mg/ ml; EBNA3A, 4 ng/ ml; and PyCSP, 0.6 mg/ ml. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0027666.g001 Triton X-114) had no significant effect on the yield of full-length protein or partial products, or protein solubility (data not presented). Accordingly, a standard protocol of 4 hrs incubation at 30uC and 300 rpm was adopted for the IVTT reactions. IVTT products were used either unpurified (whole extract), associated to Polybeads or ProteinG beads, or purified using NI-NTA resin or MagneHis Ni-particles. The MagneHis purification method was associated with a very low recovery yield and this yield was much lower than with the NI-NTA system. For example, for PyCSP, the loss associated with purification using Ni-NTA or MagneHis was approximately 30% and 80% respectively.",

The most popular cell-free systems are based in E. coli, wheat germ and rabbit reticulocytes extracts [4, 5, 27] . This platform has been applied in a number of proteomics-based studies including structural and functional proteomics [28, 29, 30] , protein evolution [31] , unnatural amino acids and protein labeling [32, 33] , protein interaction [34] , diagnostics and therapeutics [35, 36] and protein microarrays [15, 37, 38, 39] . The protein microarray platform, exploiting antigen-specific antibodies present in plasma or sera from exposed or immunized animals or humans, has been of particular interest to our laboratory to identify potential target antigens for malaria vaccine development [10, 11, 40] . Although Plasmodium proteins have proven particularly difficult to express using conventional cell-based methods, efficient expression of P. falciparum proteins ($ 93%) has been obtained using the E. coli cell-free system [11] . The wheat germ system has been also used for production of P. falciparum proteins, but with less efficiency (75%) [12] .",

However, this has not yet been adequately explored despite that T cells play a central role in orchestrating acquired immunity against infectious diseases [41, 42] . Both CD8 + and CD4 + T cells can mediate their effector function directly via cytotoxicity or indirectly via cytokines. CD4 + T cells can also provide help for CD8 + T cells or can recruit and activate B cells for antibody secretion. To date, the only reports have been restricted to measurement of proliferative T cell responses in PBMCs of smallpox vaccines or of cattle immunized with a purified Anaplasma marginale outer membrane preparation to a small number of IVTT produced vaccinia virus proteins or outer membrane proteins, respectively [18, 19, 43] . Neither of those studies comprehensively assessed and optimized the application of IVTT products for large-scale or proteome-wide cellular screening. Accordingly, herein, we report proof of concept for the potential of this approach a strategy for proteome-wide identification of antigens targeted by cell mediated immunity in both viral and parasite models, using IVTT products with specimens from human and mice.",

The production of partial fragments in E. coli based IVTT reactions has been described previously and attributed to a phenomena called translational pausing but the presence of partial products did not adversely affect immunogenicity or antigenicity [46] . Since the antigens produced by E. coli based IVTT were at least partially insoluble, simple techniques for purification, such as antibody coated beads, were not effective. We therefore explored alternative purification options including Ni-NTA affinity resin and MagneHis Niparticles. Both purification systems tested using denaturating conditions proved efficient but a much higher product recovery was obtained with the Ni-NTA resin as compared to the MagneHis Ni-particles. Unexpectedly, with the eukaryotic based insect cell-free system, the solubility of the recombinants increased to almost 100%, but only two of the four proteins expressed in the E. coli cell-free system could be expressed in the insect cell based system, at least for the limited number of times expression was attempted. These data suggest that further studies with the insect cell-free system are warranted. Newer technologies of high throughput purification such as affinity ZipTips (Millipore, Ireland) and Ni-NTA plates (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) can facilitate the purification process, but do not effectively deal with solubility issues.",

In the human/virus but not murine/ parasite model, antigen-specific IFN-c and TNF-a responses could also be induced by unpurified IVTT reactions or IVTT products associated to Polybeads or Protein beads, indicating that the E. coli and LPS background of the whole extract was not sufficient to mask the immunogenicity of the IVTT recombinant products. Addition of carboxylate beads to unpurified IVTT products increased the immunogenicity of the IVTT viral products by up 1.8-fold for IFN-c, 2.6-fold for IL-10 and 7-fold for TNF-a. The most robust and specific antigen-specific IFN-c and TNF-a responses (by CBA) were detected at the highest dilution of IVTT product, where background E. coli responses were lowest. This is a favorable scenario for proteomic-wide scale cellular screening, as the use of highly diluted IVTT products is more cost-effective. Unexpectedly, poor results were obtained with ELIspot wells precoated with anti-IFN-c mAb as well as anti-HIS mAb to bind the HIS tag on the IVTT product. In vivo studies with PyCSP IVTT products confirmed that the target protein was produced and that the IVTT produced proteins were immunogenic.",

The HA tag was released from pIVEX 2.5d by digestion with BamHI and XmaI restriction enzymes (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) for 4 hrs at 37uC (1 mg DNA/1 unit enzyme, 20 ml volume) and the fragment then extracted from a 3% agarose gel and purified using a commercially available QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Germany) according to manufacturer's instructions.

The pIVEX HisHA vector was also digested overnight at 37uC with the same set of restriction enzymes. After cleanup using the PCR purification kit, the gene fragments and the linearized vector were ligated overnight at 16uC at an insert:vector ratio of 1:20 using 30 ng of vector and 400 units T4 ligase (New England Biolabs) in a 20 ml reaction volume. The ligation product was transformed into TOP10 thermo-competent cells, grown overnight at 37uC on LB ampicillin plates (100 mg/ml), and colonies screened by PCR using the same protocol for the customized vector, except that the extension time of the colony PCR was increased to 3 min. One positive colony of each construct was grown overnight at 37uC in LB containing ampicillin (100 mg/ml) and the plasmid purified using the QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer's instructions.

Plates were washed 3 times with DMEM or RPMI, and the cells added to the IFN-c and His coated wells in triplicates. Alternatively, in the absence of anti-His pre-coating, IVTT products unpurified, associated to Polybeads or ProteinG beads, or purified using NI-NTA resin or MagneHis Ni-particles (see above), were added to the IFN-c coated wells together with the cells (100,000 PBMCs or 500,000 splenocytes), in triplicate.
