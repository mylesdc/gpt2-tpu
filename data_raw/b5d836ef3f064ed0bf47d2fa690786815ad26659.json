            "text": "The Zika virus was first discovered in rhesus monkeys in 1947 while researchers were studying yellow fever in Zika Forest, Uganda, and it was isolated from Aedes africanus mosquitoes the subsequent year (Dick, Kitchen & Haddow, 1952) . The first human isolation was recorded in Nigeria six years later (MacNamara, 1954; Petersen et al., 2016) . For decades, the viral infection was sporadically reported in Africa and Southeast Asia (Hayes, 2009; Goeijenbier et al., 2016) . The first large outbreaks occurred on Yap Island, Federated States of Micronesia, in 2007 (Duffy et al., 2009 . In this epidemic, 49 confirmed cases were found together with another 59 probable cases. It was estimated that up to 73% of the Yap Island residents were asymptomatically infected (Duffy et al., 2009; Kindhauser et al., 2016) . The episodes of large-scale Zika virus outbreaks happened in 2013, when the virus migrated to French Polynesia, a French territory located in the South Pacific. This outbreak was the largest recorded at the time (Cao-Lormeau et al., 2014; Cao-Lormeau et al., 2016; Musso, 2015) . Overall, 19,000 suspected cases were estimated throughout the epidemic's course (Cao-Lormeau et al., 2014) . The first evidence of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome related to the Zika virus was also seen in this historic outbreak (Cao-Lormeau et al., 2016) . Subsequently, the virus from French Polynesia dispersed to many countries in the Pacific Ocean, finally reaching Easter Island, Chile, in 2014 (Tognarelli et al., 2015 . The virus seems to have established well on the continent, especially in Latin American countries (Shi et al., 2016) . For example, the autochthonous transmission was first confirmed in Brazil in 2015 (Zanluca et al., 2015 and the Brazilian Ministry of Health estimated the number of suspected cases at 440,000 to 1,300,000 that year. The Zika infection was also linked to the unusual rising incidence of microcephaly in newborn infants (Mlakar et al., 2016; De Oliveira & Da Costa Vasconcelos, 2016; Heymann et al., 2016) together with some other neurological disorders including Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (De Oliveira et al., 2017) . On February 1, 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General declared Zika virus outbreaks in Latin American countries as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) (Heymann et al., 2016) . As of March 9, 2017, vector-borne Zika virus transmission was found in 84 countries, territories, or subnational areas (WHO, 2017) .",

With rapid globalization, these diseases are often disseminated at unprecedented speed. The epidemics of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and the H1N1 influenza pandemic of 2009 are excellent evidence in the first decade (Mackey & Liang, 2012) . More recently, we face new threats almost every year, for example, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in Saudi Arabia in 2012 (De Groot et al., 2013) , the Ebola virus in the West African region in 2014 (WHO Ebola Response Team, 2014) . In such epidemics, the real-time evaluation of the ongoing situation is vitally important. To serve this purpose, mathematical modeling has been exploited to monitor the outbreak progression, predict the trend of disease transmission, and tailor related control strategies (McVernon, McCaw & Mathews, 2007; De Jong & Hagenaars, 2009) .",

Modelers are obligated to comprehend not only the mathematical frameworks but also the biological knowledge behind the epidemics (Rock et al., 2014) . Recently, mathematical modeling has been well established as an epidemiological tool. It has been used to combat many infectious diseases. The very first mathematical model was traced back to the work of Daniel Bernoulli in the eighteenth century. Bernoulli employed a simple model to estimate life expectancy due to variolation practices in smallpox epidemics (Bernoulli, 1766) . However, the modern era of infectious disease modeling was actually initiated a century ago with a mosquito-borne model proposed by Sir Ronald Ross. Ross developed a set of mathematical equations to illustrate how malaria parasites were transmitted between mosquitoes and humans (Ross, 1911) . The model was later complemented by the work of Macdonald (MacDonald, 1952) , and finally became the well-known Ross-Macdonald models. This modeling framework still plays an important role in research on malaria and other mosquito-borne diseases (Smith et al., 2012) . Nevertheless, there were also many other scientists working on malaria transmission dynamics. For instance, Kermack and McKendrick incorporated the law of mass action into the Ross model and proposed new and modern compartmental models (Kermack & McKendrick, 1927; Kermack & McKendrick, 1932; Kermack & McKendrick, 1933 ) that later became the most widely used basic structures in infectious disease modeling.",

First, we provide basic knowledge on methodological approaches in order to facilitate non-mathematical background readers. We therefore initiated our survey to investigate previously published modeling frameworks. Subsequently, we further explore specifically the use of models in the study of the Zika virus. In our publication survey, we used the Google Scholar (https://scholar.google.com/) and PubMed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) databases to search for the relevant peer-reviewed journal articles. In the first step, we used the search terms ''dynamics, '' ''mathematical model,'' ''modeling,'' and ''vector-borne'' together with the names of vector-borne diseases including chikungunya, dengue, malaria, West Nile, and Zika. Then, we expanded our search to include the related models identified by the prior screening. The secondary search terminologies included ''compartmental,'' ''spatial,'' ''metapopulation,'' ''network,'' ''individual-based,'' and ''agent-based.'' In the second step, we examined only the models applied to Zika virus simulations. We strictly searched for publications focusing on the applications of mathematical modeling in Zika virus research. The search terms were then designated as the names of the modeling techniques described earlier AND ''Zika.'' We consistently excluded unrelated studies throughout the review process. For the publications that met our criteria, we intensively reviewed their modeling methods, categorized into the modeling types and compared to other related studies we found. The papers with irrelevant methodology were then removed.",

The force of infection in this case is defined as \u03b2I /N , where N is the total population. In this simplest case, it is assumed that the dynamics of disease transmission are much faster than the dynamics of demographic processes, for example, births, deaths, and migration; hence, these demographic dynamics can be ignored. In addition to SIR, other forms of compartmental models exist, for instance, SI, SIS, SIRS, SEIR, SEIRS, MSIR, MSEIR, and MSEIRS, among others. E and M are acronyms for exposed (individuals already exposed to the disease but not yet infectious) and maternal (those with maternal immunity), respectively. The inclusion of different compartments is based on the nature of the diseases (Hethcote, 2000) . The models have been applied to many emerging infectious diseases, for example, avian influenza (De Jong & Hagenaars, 2009) , Ebola (Browne, Gulbudak & Webb, 2015; Khan et al., 2015; Santermans et al., 2016; Asher, 2017) , HIV/AIDS (Akpa & Oyejola, 2010; Luo et al., 2015) , and many others. One of the most important parameters that is always measured in the compartmental model is the basic reproduction number R 0 . The R 0 is defined as ''the average number of secondary cases produced by a single infectious individual in a totally susceptible population in the initial stage of the outbreak'' (Hethcote, 2000; Rock et al., 2014) . The R 0 is regarded as a threshold at which the epidemic is still progressing. The infection may persist and the transmission continues if the R 0 is greater than 1, whereas the epidemic is going to cease in the long term when the R 0 is otherwise (Hethcote, 2000; Rock et al., 2014; Sidiki & Tchuente, 2014) . This parameter is estimated by \u03b2/\u03b3 in the SIR framework (Rock et al., 2014) . Nonetheless, the R 0 varies considerably from disease to disease. For example, the approximate R 0 for measles, mumps, and polio is 16, 12, and 5, respectively (Glomski & Ohanian, 2012) . Furthermore, the R 0 values are also different in the same disease but at a different place and time. For example, during the 2014-2015 Ebola virus outbreaks, the R 0 values were 1.71 for Guinea, 1.83 for Liberia, and 2.02 for Sierra Leone (WHO Ebola Response Team, 2014) . Therefore, the R 0 is not likely referable across spatiotemporal entities.",

This idea has become a fundamental concept of spatial studies. Spatial epidemiology is a field concerning the geographical distributions of disease incidences (Lawson, 2013) . The most primitive tool is disease mapping. However, spatial modeling is much more advanced. This method incorporates the spatial features of disease occurrences and disease transmission behaviors. In many cases, diseases were observed to spread around the index case. One of the best examples is the airborne virus foot-and-mouth disease (FMD). The FMD virus is capable of transmission by air up to 60 km on land and up to 250 km above water bodies (Lee et al., 2013) . In addition, spatial cluster causes closer places to become more vulnerable (Lessler et al., 2016a; Lessler, 2016b) . To calculate the spatial probability, the transmission kernel is calculated. The transmission kernel is defined as the probability distribution of distances between the infectious premise and other related places (Lessler et al., 2016a; Lessler, 2016b) . The estimation of this parameter can be performed using various forms, for example, exponential (E), Gaussian (G), and fat-tailed (F) methods, which are demonstrated as",

In the West Nile virus study, a weighted ensemble model (Harrigan et al., 2014) and a spatially explicit model incorporating land-use and climate variables (Crowder et al., 2013) as well as a reaction-diffusion model using a spatialtemporal risk index (Lin & Zhu, 2017) were constructed to explain the spatial diffusion of the virus under different circumstances.

However, the term and its concepts have been widely expanded to different scientific communities including epidemiology. Metapopulation assumes that the whole population is divided into different discrete spatial subgroups called ''patches.'' The subpopulation mixes homogeneously whereas the contact between the patches only occurs at some rates (Rock et al., 2014) . Consequently, we can fit compartmental models such as SIR and SEIR into each patch to better project how the disease of interest spreads within the subgroups (Rock et al., 2014; Wang & Li, 2014) . At this point, the metapopulation becomes the combination of compartmental and spatial epidemic models. This approach allows us to simulate a very large population with a well-defined spatial distribution (Banos et al., 2015) .",

In many cases, spatial distribution patterns were concurrently considered. As demonstrated in a previous dengue study (Lee & Castillo-Chavez, 2015) , a two-patch model was constructed to explore the influence of between-patch human movements on viral transmission dynamics. In the patches, the SEIR and SEI models were architected for human and mosquito populations, respectively. This was done to imitate how diseases spread within subpopulations. Another example is a study on the impact of human movement on the dynamics and persistence of vector-borne diseases at the city scale (Adams & Kapan, 2009 ). The authors constructed metapopulation models which assume that human population lives in a home patch free of mosquitoes but moves to and fro patches with immobile mosquito subpopulations. Different human movement patterns were represented by different connection patterns between human and mosquito subpopulations. It was found that more variable human movement pattern increases the influence of the large vector population patches in establishing new foci of transmission and enhances pathogen persistence (Adams & Kapan, 2009 (Balcan et al., 2010) , a metapopulation model integrating real-world demographic data and human mobility patterns, to incorporate data on mosquito density and entomological-related parameters. The expanded GLEAM model was employed to analyze the spread of the Zika virus in the Americas. It was estimated that the first introduction of the virus to Brazil may have occurred between August 2013 and April 2014 (Zhang et al., 2017) .",

It is assumed in the homogeneous compartmental model that all individuals are linked by a regular random pattern (Bansal, Grenfell & Meyers, 2007) . On the other hand, the heterogeneous models, namely spatial and metapopulation, possess different assumptions that take into account the higher realistic contact structures. The idea of a contact network emerged from the mathematical graph theory and was first used in social sciences. Two fundamental components that form a network are called ''vertex'' and ''edge'' (Lanzas & Chen, 2015) . A vertex is a unit of interest for an individual, a group of people, a village, a city, or even an entire country. An edge is the link between a pair of vertices. The edge represents the bond between vertices, which is important in disease transmission, such as animal movement or human transportation. The interaction is further divided into directed and undirected (Mart\u00ednez-L\u00f3pez, Perez & S\u00e1nchez-Vizca\u00edno, 2009) , of which the directed links dictate the incoming and outgoing edges; for example, flight itineraries, whereas the undirected approach does not consider directions, such as co-author networks. In epidemiology, contact network modeling has often been used to investigate disease transmission in both humans (Vazquez-Prokopec et al., 2013; Machens et al., 2013) and animals (Craft, 2015; Rossi et al., 2017) .

In large networks, this is an impractical and time-consuming task. However, several techniques have been exploited to approximate the structure of the network, for example, a radio-based wearable device was used to identify high-resolution close proximity interactions (less than 1.5 m) among 75 individuals dwelling in 5 different households in rural Kenya (Kiti et al., 2016) . The study makes it possible to collect a high-resolution human contact data without any direct observations. Similar wireless sensor was also used to explore social contact interactions among students, teachers and staff in an American high school (Salath\u00e9 et al., 2010) . The network structure can also be approximated using movement data, for example, airline route maps (Hufnagel, Brockmann & Geisel, 2004) or livestock movement patterns (Wiratsudakul et al., 2014; Chintrakulchai, Vuttichai & Wiratsudakul, 2017; Khengwa et al., 2017) . However, these data sources have the disadvantage that the network generally links sub-populations or groups of hosts rather than being a network between individuals. Alternatively, the spatial contact proximity can be detected from mobile phones (Eagle, Pentland & Lazer, 2009) or other Global Positioning System (GPS) data-loggers (Vazquez-Prokopec et al., 2013) . Data retrieved from these devices make the contact network to be more realistic which further improve the accuracy of related epidemic models.",

Each individual can be explicitly simulated with a set of characteristics including spatial location, interaction preference, behavior traits, etc. Moreover, these state variables dictate how individuals interact with each other. However, they can change over time (DeAngelis & Grimm, 2014) . Exploitation of the micro-level pattern (the bottom-up method) can prevent the rough estimation that inevitably occurs from the top-down approaches, for example, the compartmental model. The individualbased model is powerful for the integration of different scales and datasets. Therefore, it has been applied to various fields of scientific studies (El-Sayed et al., 2012; Merler et al., 2015; Matheson, Satterthwaite & Highlander, 2017) . However, the trade-off between the model complexity and technological requirements must be considered. The realistic models integrating large-scale real-word data apparently demand more sophisticated machines (Lanzas & Chen, 2015) . Individual-based models have been extensively applied to diseases that require highly unique individual features such as HIV/AIDS (White et al., 2014 ), influenza (Eichner et al., 2014 , tuberculosis (Graciani Rodrigues, Esp\u00edndola & Penna, 2015) , and Ebola (Merler et al., 2015) . In mosquito-borne diseases, individual-based models were previously used to describe the transmission dynamics of the chikungunya virus (Dommar et al., 2014) , the dengue virus (Chao, Longini & Halloran, 2013) , malaria (Pizzitutti et al., 2013) , and the Zika virus (Matheson, Satterthwaite & Highlander, 2017) . It is noteworthy that state-of-the-art structures, including the individual-based, metapopulation, and network models, are not necessarily more realistic than compartmental models. Indeed, the advantage of these modeling structures is that modelers are allowed to fully integrate the models with large-scale real-world data. Consequently, such models are believed to be highly realistic (Lessler et al., 2016a; Lessler, 2016b) . A graphical presentation of the basic models described in this review is illustrated in Fig. 1 .",

The GLEAM model (Balcan et al., 2010) was expanded to incorporate data on mosquito density and other entomological-related parameters (Zhang et al., 2017) .

            "text": "Disease transmission models are developed to explore how a pathogen spreads in an epidemic zone. However, the disease, especially a virus, may spread across the globe overnight. Therefore, an import risk model is used in this assessment. A particular framework is designed to quantitatively assess the likelihood of viral importation into a certain territory. Such a model was previously built to evaluate the importation risk of different emerging diseases, for instance, the Ebola virus (Chen et al., 2014; Wiratsudakul et al., 2016) , MERS-CoV Nah et al., 2016) , and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (Goubar et al., 2009) . For the Zika virus, the imported cases were well documented in many countries on different continents (Pyke et al., 2014; Bachiller-Luque, 2016; Jang et al., 2016; Sokal et al., 2016; Zhong et al., 2016; Hashimoto et al., 2017; Xiang et al., 2017) . The import risk models are necessary to foresee the probability of Zika importation into other unaffected countries. As Brazil was recently in the spotlight for Zika epidemics, models focused on the Zika virus escaping the country were increasingly produced. In particular, models considering the risk of mass gatherings for international events such as the Olympic games were recently proposed (Grills et al., 2016; Massad, Coutinho & Wilder-Smith, 2016; Burattini et al., 2016) . Herein, we described three basic methods used in import risk estimation, deterministic and stochastic risk estimation and risk estimation by force of infection.",

For Zika, the data-driven metapopulation model integrating real-world demographic, human mobility, socioeconomic, temperature, and vector density data has also been used to analyze the spread of the Zika virus in the Americas (Zhang et al., 2017) . These emerging data-driven approaches further allow the metapopulation, network, and individual-based models better simulating the real epidemics.",

            "text": "In general, epidemic models can be used either as predictive tools or as a means of understanding fundamental epidemiological processes. However, prediction is perhaps the most obvious use of epidemic models. These allow us to predict the population-level epidemic dynamics from an individual-level knowledge of epidemiological factors, and assess the effectiveness of intervention strategies. As the trends in modeling of infectious diseases have been shifting towards data-driven approaches (Lessler et al., 2016a; Lessler, 2016b) , the model complexity itself may hamper the use of models by nonspecialists and public health practitioners. These complex modeling architectures should be translated into a comprehensible environment. The modelers may adopt some strategies taught in classes on translational medicine to evaluate how to turn epidemic models into practices. Alternatively, user-friendly interfaces are helpful for health professionals to include mathematical models in their strategic plans. For example, the GLEAM framework provides a user-friendly and easy-to-use graphical tool for general modelers and public health agencies (http://www.gleamviz.org). This is an excellent initiation of the translation of complex mathematical models into a touchable framework. The results presented by Zhang et al. (2017) were also delivered via user-friendly and easy-to-read graphics on a web application (http://www.zika-model.org/). Therefore, an alliance with computer and graphical scientists is encouraged. Moreover, some educational mobile applications are suggested to acquaint the general public and especially younger generations with epidemic simulations. An excellent example is a simulation game available at the App Store and Google Play called Plague Inc. (Ndemic Creations, Bristol, UK). The game makes mathematical models feel touchable and not too difficult, leading to more familiarity and acceptance.",

In this case, the translation of mathematical language into political contexts is crucial. Moreover, simple and complex models should be exploited differently. Simple models can be produced in a timely fashion to provide an estimation of the possible impacts. In contrast, complex models require more time to develop but are far more realistic. The models are much more powerful in terms of predictive capability. The preparation of complicated models before outbreaks is recommended.",

This review provides basic knowledge of different mathematical models used in studies of disease dynamics. We demonstrated how the models were applied during the course of Zika virus outbreaks and discussed the uses of mathematical models in Zika import risk estimation and intervention planning. We found that Zika models carried out for early epidemics were less complicated compared to the more recent ones. The compartmental model is still commonly used for the timely assessment of epidemics. However, more complex modeling frameworks including metapopulation, network, and individual-based models have been of increasing interest due to the recent availability of large-scale real-world data and computational power. Inclusion of these real-world data into the model is believed to improve the ability of the model to reproduce the observed data and reliably predict future epidemic dynamics.",

The colors represent epidemiological status: susceptible (S, blue), exposed (E, gray), infectious (I, red), and recovered (R, green). (A) Basic SIR compartmental model. Individuals are assumed to be well-mixed and are classified only according to their epidemiological status. (B) Vector-borne compartmental model. The subscripts H and M denote human and mosquito, respectively. Both host and vector individuals are assumed to be well-mixed and are classified only according to their epidemiological status. (C) Spatial model. Individuals are located at different locations. The transmission of infection between an infectious individual and a susceptible individual at distance x may occur with probability K (x). (D) Metapopulation model. The entire population is divided into two distinct subpopulations, each with independent disease transmission dynamics, together with interactions between subpopulations. The subpopulation in each patch is mixed homogeneously. (E) Network model. The model is formed by at least two basic components: vertex and edge. Vertices are connected by edges defined by the relationship of interest such as trade or travel. Infectious diseases are modeled to spread via the edges in this model. (F) Individual-based model. In this most complicated model, the stochastic epidemiological dynamics for each individual can be explicitly simulated with a set of characteristics including epidemiological status, spatial location, interaction preference, behavior traits, etc.Full-size DOI: 10.7717/peerj.4526/fig-1",
