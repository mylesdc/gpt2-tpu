            "text": "The poxvirus life cycle, although physically autonomous from the host nucleus, is nevertheless dependent upon cellular functions. A requirement for de novo fatty acid biosynthesis was implied by our previous demonstration that cerulenin, a fatty acid synthase inhibitor, impaired vaccinia virus production. Here we show that additional inhibitors of this pathway, TOFA and C75, reduce viral yield significantly, with partial rescue provided by exogenous palmitate, the pathway's endproduct. Palmitate's major role during infection is not for phospholipid synthesis or protein palmitoylation. Instead, the mitochondrial import and b-oxidation of palmitate are essential, as shown by the impact of etomoxir and trimetazidine, which target these two processes respectively. Moreover, the impact of these inhibitors is exacerbated in the absence of exogenous glucose, which is otherwise dispensable for infection. In contrast to glucose, glutamine is essential for productive viral infection, providing intermediates that sustain the TCA cycle (anaplerosis). Cumulatively, these data suggest that productive infection requires the mitochondrial b-oxidation of palmitate which drives the TCA cycle and energy production. Additionally, infection causes a significant rise in the cellular oxygen consumption rate (ATP synthesis) that is ablated by etomoxir. The biochemical progression of the vaccinia life cycle is not impaired in the presence of TOFA, C75, or etomoxir, although the levels of viral DNA and proteins synthesized are somewhat diminished. However, by reversibly arresting infections at the onset of morphogenesis, and then monitoring virus production after release of the block, we determined that virion assembly is highly sensitive to TOFA and C75. Electron microscopic analysis of cells released into C75 revealed fragmented aggregates of viroplasm which failed to be enclosed by developing virion membranes. Taken together, these data indicate that vaccinia infection, and in particular virion assembly, relies on the synthesis and mitochondrial import of fatty acids, where their b-oxidation drives robust ATP production.

De novo fatty acid biosynthesis has been shown to be manipulated by several diverse viruses such as HCMV, dengue virus (DV) and Hepatitis C virus (HCV). The de novo fatty acid biosynthesis pathway generates the long-chain fatty acid palmitate and is schematically represented in Figure 1A . The first committed step in this pathway is achieved by the conversion of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA by acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). Subsequently, successive condensation reactions of malonyl-CoA with acetyl-CoA are catalyzed by fatty acid synthase (FASN), ultimately generating the 16-carbon fatty acid palmitate. Palmitate contributes to several key biological functions such as protein palmitoylation, phospholipid synthesis and energy production (Fig. 1A ) [4] .",

The large size of the viral genome, which encodes approximately 200 genes, enables the virus to replicate solely in the cytoplasm of infected cells. The array of virally encoded proteins include those that mediate viral entry, three temporally regulated phases of gene expression, genome replication and maturation, virion morphogenesis and egress, and a range of interactions with the intrinsic, innate and adaptive defenses of the host. Despite the virus' physical and genetic autonomy from the host nucleus, infection still requires macromolecule precursors such as nucleotides, phospholipids, and amino acids as well as intracellular membranes and the host translational machinery. A comprehensive metabolomic analysis of vacciniainfected cells is lacking; indeed very little is known about how vaccinia virus manipulates or interfaces with the host metabolome or bioenergetic machinery. Recently, the Smith lab reported that vaccinia induces a 'pseudo hypoxic' state early in infection [12] . We have also previously shown that the FASN inhibitor, cerulenin, diminishes viral yield [13] , suggesting that de novo fatty acid biosynthesis is important for viral infection.",

The mitochondrial import and b-oxidation of palmitate appear to be very important during infection, whereas exogenous glucose is dispensable, suggesting that the conversion of palmitate to acetyl-CoA, rather than the glycolytic processing of glucose, drives the TCA cycle and aerobic energy production. Additionally, glutamine is essential for vaccinia replication, serving to anaplerotically fill the TCA cycle. Examination of how the impairment of de novo fatty acid biosynthesis affected infection revealed the unimpeded progression through the biochemical stages of infection, a modest reduction in DNA and protein synthesis, and a more dramatic block to virion assembly.

As a first approach to understanding the bioenergetics pathways that contribute to productive viral infection, we tested the importance of glucose, which can be metabolized to pyruvate and ultimately acetyl-CoA, thereby driving the TCA cycle. BSC40 cells were therefore infected with WT vaccinia virus in glucose-free media or media supplemented with 4 mM glucose (Fig. 3A , gray and black, respectively). Surprisingly, the absence of glucose had no impact on the 16 h viral yield, suggesting that infected cells might be relying on \u00df-oxidation to drive the TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation, rather than glycolysis, to provide energy. To directly test the hypothesis that infected cells rely on the import and utilization of palmitate within mitochondria, cells were infected in the presence of vehicle (solid bars) or the pharmacological inhibitor etomoxir (striped bars). Etomoxir is an irreversible inhibitor of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1) and prevents the import of long-chain fatty acids into mitochondria. Treatment with etomoxir inhibited the 16 h viral yield 14-fold compared to treatment with DMSO (Fig. 3B, left bars) . As expected based on the mode of action of etomoxir, the addition of 50 mM exogenous palmitate was unable to rescue viral yield (data not shown). Intimate feedback between the various facets of cellular metabolism is illustrated by the observation that inhibition of b-oxidation causes a concomitant increase in the glycolytic pathway [24] . In light of this interrelatedness, the impact of etomoxir treatment on viral replication in cells maintained in the absence of glucose was also examined. When glucose was omitted from the medium, treatment with etomoxir caused a much greater decrease (125fold) in viral yield than had been seen in glucose-containing media (Fig. 3B, right bars) . These data show that import of long-chain fatty acids into mitochondria is important for viral infection.",

Inclusion of 2-8 mM TMZ led to a dose-dependent, but modest, decrease in the 16 h viral yield when cells were maintained in the presence of glucose [5-fold decrease at 8 mM (Fig. 3C , black diamonds)]. As was seen with etomoxir ( Fig. 3B) , treatment with TMZ in the absence of glucose caused a dose-dependent and more severe inhibition in viral yield [36- fold decrease at 4 mM (Fig. 3C, gray circles) ]. Taken together, these data show that the import of palmitate into mitochondria and its subsequent b-oxidation, are important for viral infection. In addition, the presence of glucose is not important for viral replication unless b-oxidation of fatty acids is inhibited, suggesting that the TCA cycle within infected cells is normally driven by acetyl-CoA generated by the \u00df-oxidation of palmitate, rather than from glycolysis.",

We utilized a Seahorse Bioscience XF-96 extracellular flux analyzer, which measures oxygen consumption rates as a direct surrogate of ATP synthesis [26] . This assay allows for repeated monitoring of ATP synthesis of a single sample over time. BSC40 cells were plated at a density of 40,000 cells per well (96-well dish) and were either mock infected or infected with WT vaccinia virus. Oxygen consumption rates were measured every 8 min from 90 min to 12 h post-infection (hpi). At 90 min post infection, mock treated cells had an oxygen consumption rate (OCR) of 40 pmol/min, which rose to 75 pmol/ min by 12 hpi as nutrients were consumed (Fig. 5A , gray line). Strikingly, the initial OCR (90 min post-infection) of WT infected cells was almost twice that of mock infected cells at 75 pmol/min; this rate remained high throughout the infection, rising to 127 pmol/min at 12 hpi (Fig. 5A , black line). Statistical analysis indicated that the OCR was significantly higher in infected cells than mock-infected cells at all time points, and linear regression analysis indicated that the rate of increase in the OCR over the 10.5 hours of measurement was also significantly higher for the infected cells than that measured for mock-infected cells. Because the extracellular acidification rate, a readout of lactate production, remains largely unchanged over time (data not shown), this increase in OCR can be ascribed to mitochondrial rather than glycolytic activity.",

We utilized a variety of commercially available antibodies to monitor the localization of FASN in uninfected and vaccinia-infected BSC40 cells (7 hpi) by immunofluorescence microscopy. The most reproducible and distinct pattern was seen using a polyclonal antibody raised against a peptide from the C9-terminus of FASN. In mock-infected cells (Fig. 6, left column) , a tubular pattern of staining that radiated throughout the cytoplasm was seen. This pattern was reminiscent of mitochondrial staining, and indeed the anti-FASN staining pattern largely colocalized with the Mitotracker signal [merge (fourth row) and zoom (bottom row)] (Pearson's coefficient of 0.80). Validation of the specificity of the staining seen with the anti-FASN antibody was obtained by blocking cells with the peptide used as the immunogen; in the presence of this blocking peptide, no anti-FASN staining was seen (Fig. 6, middle column) , although the Mitotracker (mitochondria) and DAPI (nuclei) staining remained unchanged. At 7 hpi with vaccinia virus, the pattern of anti-FASN staining was quite similar and remained coincident with the Mitotracker profile (Pearson's coefficient of 0.95), although both FASN and mitochondria were more concentrated in the perinuclear region of the cell (Fig. 6, right column) . These data show that at least a portion of FASN, that portion most accessible to this anti-FASN antibody, localizes at or near the mitochondria, suggesting that palmitate may be generated by FASN in close proximity to mitochondria, facilitating its import by CPT1.",

As a first step in determining which stages of the viral life cycle were most affected by these inhibitors, we analyzed viral DNA replication on a per-cell basis (Fig. 7A) . BSC40 cells were infected with WT vaccinia virus in the presence of BrdU (which is incorporated into newly synthesized DNA) and treated with DMSO, TOFA, or etomoxir for 7 h. Cells were then stained with antisera against BrdU [to mark sites of nascent viral DNA synthesis (Fig. 7A, second row) ], I3 [the viral single-stranded DNA binding protein (Fig. 7A, top row) ] and DAPI [to stain all DNA (Fig. 7A, middle row) ]. In cells treated with vehicle (DMSO, left column), large sites of viral DNA replication accumulate in the cytoplasm as shown by the colocalization of I3 and BrdU [merge (fourth row) and zoom (bottom row)]. Similar replication foci were observed in cells treated with either TOFA (middle column) or etomoxir (right column), indicating that genome replication was proceeding in the presence of these inhibitors. Of note, the replication foci in the drug-treated cells appeared to be somewhat smaller and more numerous. . Vaccinia infection is accompanied by an increase in ATP synthesis that is ablated by etomoxir. Seahorse technology was employed for real-time, continual measurement of oxygen consumption rates (OCR) in cultures of uninfected or infected cells as a surrogate assessment of ATP synthesis.

Fulllength viral genomes (,200 kbp; arrowhead) were predominant under all treatments, although the levels of DNA accumulated were diminished to 50, 70 and 83% of WT levels in the presence of TOFA, C75 and etomoxir, respectively. Similar results were seen when viral DNA replication was assayed by Southern dot blot analysis (data not shown). Cumulatively, these data show that viral DNA replication is only modestly impaired when palmitate synthesis and mitochondrial import are impaired. Since DNA replication is accomplished by early viral proteins, and since the IF analysis (Fig. 7A ) (and immunoblot assays, not shown) indicated that the I3 protein accumulates to high levels in the presence of these drugs, we can conclude that early protein synthesis is also largely unaffected by these inhibitors. 8 and 13-16) . Intermediate viral proteins were readily seen at 4.5 hpi (circles in lanes 5-8) under all treatments, although synthesis levels were somewhat decreased in cells treated with TOFA and etomoxir (to 60 and 37% of control levels, respectively). The synthesis of late viral proteins (stars in lanes [13] [14] [15] [16] occurred under all treatments, although a reduction in the level of expression was seen in all drug-treated cells. Overall protein synthesis was diminished to 35% of control levels in cells treated with TOFA and 65% in cells treated with either C75 or etomoxir.

To focus on morphogenesis itself, without the complications of the minor impact that the inhibitors exert on protein synthesis and genome accumulation, we took two experimental approaches. First, we utilized a temperature-sensitive mutant with a lesion in the F10 protein kinase (Cts28); at the non-permissive temperature (39.7uC) the virus has a well-characterized defect in virus assembly [29, 30] . Viral genome replication and the full cycle of gene expression proceed normally, but the infection arrests prior to membrane biogenesis. This arrest is reversed when cells are shifted to permissive conditions (31.5uC) [29] . BSC40 cells were infected with Cts28 for 12 h under non-permissive conditions, and then released to permissive conditions to allow the resumption of assembly. Release was performed for 8 h in the presence of vehicle (DMSO), the inhibitor rifampicin (rif), which allows membrane biogenesis to move forward but blocks the formation of immature and mature virions, TOFA, or C75. The viral yield from cells shifted to permissive conditions in the presence of DMSO was 40fold greater than the yield from cells shifted under conditions in which virus production was inhibited (rif) (Fig. 9A) . Interestingly, the inclusion of TOFA or C75 after the temperature shift was as deleterious to virus production as rifampicin. These data strongly suggest that de novo fatty acid biosynthesis, and by extrapolation ATP production, is particularly important for virion assembly.",

Crescent membranes, IV membranes, and ''peanut'' shaped membranes (open circle) resembling two fused IV were seen. However, the smooth, dense viroplasm observed in rif synchronization was dispersed into splotches or aggregates (star), some of which were being enclosed in IV membranes (open diamond). Many of the IVs, however, appeared devoid of interior contents. No mature virions were seen. Consistent with the data shown in Fig. 9B , the addition of exogenous palmitate to C75 treated cells partially rescued the block observed in cells treated with C75 alone (data not shown). Taken together, these data show that de novo fatty acid biosynthesis is important for virion assembly, even after the constituent components are present. The most dramatic impairment observed was the fragmentation of the virosomal contents into splotchy aggregates, and the inefficient incorporation of this material into nascent virion membranes.",

            "text": "The data presented here support a model that is depicted schematically in Figure 10 . The de novo fatty acid biosynthetic pathway, comprising the two enzymes ACC and FASN, generates palmitate within the cytoplasm. Palmitate is then imported into the mitochondria by CPT1 where it undergoes b-oxidation to generate acetyl-CoA. The generation of acetyl-CoA from palmitate, rather than glucose, drives the TCA cycle to generate sufficient amounts of ATP for maximal viral production. Inhibition of any part in this pathway causes a significant diminution in viral yield. ATP generated by this pathway contributes to viral DNA replication and protein synthesis, but is most important for the morphogenesis of infectious virions. Glucose is largely dispensable for infection, but glutamine is essential. A major role for glutamine is to enable the anaplerotic support of the TCA cycle via deamination to glutamate within the cytoplasm, and conversion to a-ketoglutarate within the mitochondria, by the successive activities of glutaminase and glutamate dehydrogenase. The robust action of the TCA cycle may allow for the shuttling of citrate into the cytoplasm to generate pools of acetyl-CoA for the synthesis of palmitate.",

            "text": "Having previously shown that the FASN inhibitor cerulenin impaired vaccinia virus morphogenesis [13] , we began the current study with the expectation that de novo fatty acid biosynthesis would be needed to augment the intracellular membranes available to support viral assembly. However, this expectation was not supported by further experimentation. For example, triacsin C, which inhibits long chain acyl-CoA synthetase and drastically impairs phospholipid synthesis, has no impact on vaccinia virus infection (Fig. 2B) . Because cerulenin, TOFA and C75 all inhibited vaccinia virus infection, we considered what other roles the end-product of their activity, palmitate, might play. We were able to discard an essential role for protein palmitoylation in the progression of the life cycle by demonstrating that infection was resistant to 2-bromopalmitate ( Fig. 2A) . There are several viral proteins that do undergo palmitoylation, including A33, B5 and F13 [36, 37] , but these proteins have been shown to participate in . Viral assembly is inhibited significantly by TOFA and C75. A) BSC40 cells were infected with Cts28 (MOI 5) for 12 h at the nonpermissive temperature (39.7uC) to synchronize the infectious cycle at the initiation of assembly. Cultures were then shifted to the permissive temperature (31.5uC) to relieve the block to assembly and infection was allowed to proceed for an additional 8 h. The shift-down was performed in the presence of rifampicin (rif) (100 mg/ml), a known inhibitor of assembly, DMSO (vehicle control), TOFA (154 mM) or C75 (39 mM). Viral yield is shown; a significant block to virus production is seen in the presence of rif, TOFA or C75 (n = 6) (***, p,0.001). B) BSC40 cells were infected with WT vaccinia virus (MOI 5) in the presence rif (100 mg/ml). At 12 hpi, cells were released from the rif block into media containing rif (100 mg/ml), DMSO, TOFA (154 mM) or C75 (39 mM) in the absence (black bars) or presence (gray bars) of exogenous palmitate (50 mM) for 8 h. Cells were harvested and viral yield analysis reveals that TOFA or C75 exert a significant impact on viral yield that can be partially rescued by the addition of palmitate (n = 6) (**, p,0.02). C) Electron microscopy was utilized to examine specific block in viral assembly seen when rif-arrested cells were released into media containing C75. Cells were treated as in (B) and processed for electron microscopy. Cells maintained in the presence of rif (upper left panel) accumulated large virosomes (V) that were surrounded by flaccid membranes (arrowheads). When cells were released into DMSO (upper right panel), assembly resumed and crescent membranes (C), immature virions (IV) and mature virions (not shown) were abundant. When cells were released into C75 (bottom panels), the virosomal contents dispersed into splotchy aggregates (star); IV, empty IV, and ''peanut'' shaped double-IV (open circle) were seen. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1004021.g009 Figure 10 . Model for palmitate utilization during vaccinia virus infection. The de novo fatty acid biosynthetic pathway is utilized to generate ATP during vaccinia virus infection. ACC (acetyl-CoA carboxylase) converts acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA; FASN (fatty acid synthease) catalyzes successive condensation reactions of malonyl CoA with acetyl-CoA to generate the 16-carbon fatty acid, palmitate. Palmitate is then imported into the mitochondria by CPT1 (carnitine palmitoyl transferase) 1. Within the mitochondria, palmitate undergoes b-oxidation to generate acetyl-CoA which drives the TCA cycle (and subsequent oxidative phosphorylation) to generate ATP. Glutaminolysis enables glutamine to anaplerotically fill in the TCA cycle. Glutamine is converted to glutamate by Glnase (glutaminase) which is further converted to a-ketoglutarate by GDH (glutamate dehydrogenase). Inhibitors of this pathway are shown in red; impairment of each of the steps in this pathway significantly diminishes vaccinia virus production. ATP production supports DNA replication and protein synthesis (gray dashed lines), but is most important for the assembly of nascent virions (black dashed line). doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1004021.g010 the maturation of a small subset of mature virions (MV) into extracellular virions (EV); our studies are focused on the production of MV, which constitute the vast majority of virions and are sufficient for infection in tissue culture.",

            "text": "The third key role for palmitate is to undergo b-oxidation within mitochondria and generate acetyl-CoA, a key component of the TCA cycle, which in turn drives oxidative phosphorylation and ATP generation. It seems intuitive that vaccinia infection would require high levels of ATP, given the robust synthesis of viral RNA, DNA and protein and the assembly of large numbers of complex virions. We found that glucose was dispensable for infection (Fig. 3A) . Moreover, we also found that oxygen consumption, a surrogate measure of mitochondrial ATP synthesis, was elevated significantly in infected cells (Fig. 5A) . This observation was consistent with a previous report demonstrating an increase in ATP levels in vaccinia-infected HeLa cells [38] . Our data indicate that optimal infection requires the synthesis, mitochondrial import and b-oxidation of palmitate (Figs. 1 and  3) . It should be noted that complete oxidation of one molecule of palmitate yields more ATP than can be generated from one molecule of glucose (glucoseR2 acetyl-CoA+36 ATP; palmita-teR8 acetyl-CoA+129 ATP). Even considering the fact that generating palmitate requires 57 ATP (15 ATP to generate and activate acetyl-CoA and 42 ATP to complete 7 condensation reactions), palmitate yields twice the amount of ATP compared to glucose. Interestingly, this value correlates with the ,2-fold increase in OCR we observe upon infection with vaccinia virus. Thus, at least in BSC40 cells, vaccinia virus is more dependent upon b-oxidation of fatty acids within the mitochondria than on glycolysis for maximal ATP production. This altered metabolic profile is an early event during infection, since OCR levels were already high by 1.5 hpi (Fig. 5) . Determining how mitochondrial activity is stimulated early in infection is an area of interest for future study.",

HCV has been shown to upregulate expression of the enzymes involved in fatty acid synthesis [7] [8] [9] [10] ; however, the levels of FASN are not upregulated during vaccinia infection (data not shown). It will be of interest in the future to determine whether the specific activity of ACC or FASN is upregulated upon vaccinia infection, since both enzymes are known to be modulated by phosphorylation, ubiquitination and by specific interactions with stimulatory and inhibitory binding partners [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] . DV and HCV induce a change in the localization of FASN to the sites of RNA replication [6, 11] , but the localization of FASN does not appear to change during vaccinia infection, and we have not been successful in detecting any stable and/or obvious interactions between FASN and vaccinia-encoded proteins (not shown). However, we were surprised to see that, in BSC40 cells, a significant portion of FASN co-localizes with mitochondria (Fig. 6) ; this co-localization has not been reported before. It is reasonable to conclude that this proximity would facilitate the mitochondrial import of palmitate immediately after synthesis. Electron microscopic analysis of vaccinia-infected cells has revealed that mitochondria are numerous at the periphery of viral factories, which may facilitate the delivery of ATP to viral machinery.",

            "text": "The de novo fatty acid biosynthetic pathway driven by ACC and FASN requires ample concentrations of acetyl-CoA, which can be generated via two primary pathways. The first mechanism involves the catabolism of pyruvate by pyruvate dehydrogenase. This is unlikely, however, since it has recently been reported that a 'pseudohypoxic' state is induced early after vaccinia infection [12] , which leads to an up-regulation of HIF1a-dependent genes causing an increase in the flux of glucose to lactate and concomitant decrease in accumulation of acetyl-CoA in the mitochondria [47] . The second mechanism involves the catabolism of citrate to acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate by ATP citrate lyase (ACLY). This pathway is utilized by highly proliferative cells that utilize citrate as an intermediate for lipogenic pathways. In order for the TCA cycle not to slow down as a result of this diversion of citrate for fatty acid synthesis, replenishment must occur. In HCMV-infected cells, replenishment of the TCA cycle has been shown to occur through glutaminolysis and anaplerosis [48] . Glutaminolysis refers to the use of glutamine as a source for the ultimate synthesis of a-ketoglutarate, which can subsequently be utilized in the synthesis of citrate. Indeed, glutamine is essential for vaccinia virus infection: depletion of glutamine reduces viral yield by ,1300-fold (Fig. 4A) . Oxaloacetate and a-ketoglutarate fill the TCA cycle and are able to rescue viral yield significantly, albeit only in the presence of a low concentration of glutamine (Fig. 4B) . This suggests that citrate may indeed provide the acetyl-CoA that is needed in the cytoplasm of vaccinia-infected cells for palmitate synthesis. Further metabolomic studies aimed at determining changes in the levels of acetyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA, palmitate and TCA cycle intermediates during vaccinia infection will be highly informative. It is perhaps not surprising that productive viral infection requires a low level of glutamine that cannot be rescued by TCA cycle intermediates, because glutamine is known to play roles in purine and pyrimidine synthesis as well as protein synthesis.",

The process of virion morphogenesis appears to be acutely sensitive to the impact of these drugs and the attendant decrease in ATP synthesis, as demonstrated by our use of CtsF10 and rifampicin to arrest cells at the onset of morphogenesis and then monitor virus production when these blocks were released ( Fig. 9A and B) . When cells were released into C75 or TOFA, the expected burst of virus production was diminished by .10-fold.",

The large virosomes that accumulate in the presence of rifampicin were dispersed into fragmented aggregates, as if the solubility of these virosomal proteins was compromised.

            "text": "In sum, our data support the conclusion that the de novo fatty acid biosynthetic pathway plays a key role in viral infection by generating sufficient palmitate for import into mitochondria. The subsequent \u00df-oxidation of palmitate can drive the TCA cycle and augment the production of ATP; data generated using Seahorse technology confirms that ATP production is highly elevated within infected cells in a manner that depends upon mitochondrial fatty acid import. Thus, the vaccinia infectious cycle is highly dependent upon cellular bioenergetics; moreover, infection seems to shift cellular metabolism towards a more oxidative and less glycolytic state. The de novo fatty acid biosynthesis pathway offers a novel target for developing therapeutics to treat poxvirus infections. Interestingly, this biochemical pathway is often upregulated in cancer [49] , and inhibitors that target this pathway (such as TOFA, C75, and cerulenin) inhibit cancer cell proliferation in vitro. New compounds are being developed that retain efficacy but show increased solubility and reduced toxicity, such as the FASN inhibitor, G28UCM [50] [51] [52] . It will be interesting to determine if such compounds would have antipoxviral efficacy in tissue culture and animal models. ",

            "text": "Viral protein synthesis is modestly reduced in the presence of TOFA, C75, or etomoxirVaccinia virus infection is characterized by a temporally regulated cascade of gene expression, in which each phase of transcription (early, intermediate, late) is mediated by proteins expressed in the prior phase. Moreover, as infection progresses, host transcription is quelled, host mRNAs decrease in abundance, and translation is skewed towards viral mRNAs. We therefore assessed whether the progression and robustness of viral protein synthesis was impaired when the cycle of palmitate synthesis and mitochondrial import was disrupted. Cells were mock-infected or infected with WT vaccinia virus in the presence of vehicle (DMSO), TOFA, C75 or etomoxir and pulse labeled with [ 35 S]methionine for 30 min at the indicated times post-infection. As illustrated by the autoradiograph shown inFig. 8, protein synthesis in mock-infected cells was largely unaffected by the inclusion of these inhibitors (lanes 1-4; 4.5 h post-treatment or lanes 9, 11, 12; 7.5 h post-treatment), with the exception of TOFA-treated cells, where protein synthesis was reduced 5-fold at 7.5 h post-treatment (lane 10). In infected cells, we saw the expected reduction in host protein synthesis at both 4.5 and 7.5 hpi (lanes 5-",

A) BSC40 cells were infected with WT vaccinia virus (MOI 2) in the presence of 25 mg/ml BrdU, to track nascent DNA synthesis, as well as DMSO (left column), TOFA (154 mM) (middle column) or etomoxir (360 mM) (right column). At 7 hpi, cells were fixed and stained with primary antisera recognizing the viral I3 protein (top row), a marker of DNA replication sites, and BrdU (second row) as well as DAPI (third row). Merged images of I3, BrdU and DAPI are shown in the fourth row. A single cell is shown at higher magnification in the bottom row and corresponds to the cell shown in the dotted box (fourth row). Merged images show accumulation of replication foci under all treatments, although the foci seen in TOFA or etomoxir treated cells appear smaller and more numerous. B) Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was employed to examine the accumulation and integrity of full length viral genomes. BSC40 cells were infected with WT vaccinia virus in presence of DMSO, TOFA (154 mM), C75 (39 mM) or etomoxir (360 mM). At 10 hpi, cells were processed for PFGE; DNA was visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Under all conditions tested, full length genomes accumulated; however in TOFA-, C75-and etomoxir-treated cells the levels of full-length genomic DNA that accumulated were 50, 70 and 83% (respectively) of that seen when cells were treated with vehicle (DMSO) alone. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1004021.g007",
