The adjuvanticity of Sargassum pallidum polysaccharides in Newcastle disease (ND), infectious bronchitis (IB) and avian influenza (AI) was investigated by examining the antibody titers and lymphocyte proliferation following immunization in chickens. The chickens were administrated combined ND, IB and AI inactivated vaccines containing SPP at 10, 30 and 50 mg/mL, using an oil adjuvant vaccine as a control. The ND, IB and AI antibody titers and the lymphocyte proliferation were enhanced at 30 mg/mL SPP. In conclusion, an appropriate dose of SPP may be a safe and efficacious immune stimulator candidate that is suitable for vaccines to produce early and persistent prophylaxis.",

            "text": "Recent studies have shown that polysaccharides enhance the organism specificity and the non-specific immune function of vaccines [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . Polysaccharides activate T cells, B cells, macrophages (M\u03c6), natural killer cells (NK), cytotoxic T cells (TL), lymphokine-activated killer cells (LAK) and other immune cells. Polysaccharides also promote the secretion of interleukin 1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor (INF) from giant macrophages [7] , the production of leukocyte interleukin 2 (IL-2) from T lymphocytes, the production of interferon (TFN) from activated white blood cells and the activation of the complement and reticuloendothelial systems in a variety of ways [8, 9] . Polysaccharides can enhance immune function [10, 11] , have no toxic side effects in normal cells and are good biological response modifiers that can be developed into a new type of vaccine adjuvant [12, 13] . Interest in these polysaccharides for the development of new adjuvants or immunopotentiators for medical and veterinary vaccines has increased [14] [15] [16] [17] ; however, the benefits of incorporating polysaccharides into combined Newcastle disease, infectious bronchitis and avian influenza inactivated vaccines have not been demonstrated. In our previous study, we determined that the Sargassum polysaccharide demonstrated a stronger potential to enhance serum antibody titers and lymphocyte proliferation in chickens compared with seven other Chinese herbal medicinal ingredients, such as Astragalus polysaccharide and Lycium barbarum polysaccharides.",

CD 4 + and CD 8 + T lymphocytes are the hub of immune regulation, and when the CD 4 + /CD 8 + ratio is high but within the normal range, the body has a high immune status, whereas when the CD 4 + /CD 8 + ratio is disrupted, this can lead to a variety of immune diseases. The results of T subsets showed that the vaccination of the groups containing SPP (especially 30 mg/mL SPP) may lead to the polarization of cell responses within 7 days. These findings indicate that the SPP could significantly enhance cellular immunity, which in turn could activate the antibody response. The SPP exhibit an immunity adjustment function by affecting T and B lymphocyte multiplication. However, because SPP are composed of many monosaccharide molecules, such as glucose, rhamnose, and arabinose, differences in the compositions of various polysaccharides are seldom studied and the mechanisms of immune response enhancement are not clear. The mechanism of the regulatory role of the immune function may be as follows: (1) SPP induce the production of cytokines by stimulating non-specific immune cells (macrophages or natural killer cells) to activate the T and B immune cells;",

The results of this study show that the appropriate dose of polysaccharide significantly enhances the specific immune response in chickens and improves vaccine effectiveness, promoting an earlier peak that increases rapidly and lasts for a long time; 2. The lymphocyte transformation state corresponds to the A 570 values measured using the MTT method. The data indicate that the SPP induce T lymphocytes to multiply and exhibit certain effectiveness; 3. In this study, the CD 4 + T lymphocyte content and CD 4 + /CD 8 + values in all the test groups were higher than those in the control group, and the medium SPP dose groups were significantly higher than the control group, which indicates that the appropriate dose of polysaccharide can promote the proliferation of peripheral CD 4 + T lymphocytes in chickens, thereby enhancing cellular immunity;",
