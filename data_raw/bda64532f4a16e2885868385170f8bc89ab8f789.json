            "text": "In an effort to circumvent resistance to rapamycin -an mTOR inhibitor -we searched for novel rapamycindownstream-targets that may be key players in the response of cancer cells to therapy. We found that rapamycin, at nM concentrations, increased phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 2\u03b1 in rapamycin-sensitive and estrogen-dependent MCF-7 cells, but had only a minimal effect on eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation in the rapamycininsensitive triple-negative MDA-MB-231 cells. Addition of salubrinal -an inhibitor of eIF2\u03b1 dephosphorylationdecreased expression of a surface marker associated with capacity for self renewal, increased senescence and induced clonogenic cell death, suggesting that excessive phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 is detrimental to the cells' survival. Treating cells with salubrinal enhanced radiation-induced increase in eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation and clonogenic death and showed that irradiated cells are more sensitive to increased eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation than non-irradiated ones. Similar to salubrinal -the phosphomimetic eIF2\u03b1 variant -S51D -increased sensitivity to radiation, and both abrogated radiation-induced increase in breast cancer type 1 susceptibility gene, thus implicating enhanced phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 in modulation of DNA repair. Indeed, salubrinal inhibited non-homologous end joining as well as homologous recombination repair of double strand breaks that were induced by I-SceI in green fluorescent protein reporter plasmids. In addition to its effect on radiation, salubrinal enhanced eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation and clonogenic death in response to the histone deacetylase inhibitor -vorinostat. Finally, the catalytic competitive inhibitor of mTOR -Ku-0063794 -increased phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 demonstrating further the involvement of mTOR activity in modulating eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation. These experiments suggest that excessive phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 decreases survival of cancer cells; making eIF2\u03b1 a worthy target for drug development, with the potential to enhance the cytotoxic effects of established anti-neoplastic therapies and circumvent resistance to rapalogues and possibly to other drugs that inhibit upstream components of the mTOR pathway.",

Moreover, prolonged incubation with rapalogues can inhibit formation of mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) [8] . However, the effect of rapalogues on mTORC1 and mTORC2 is cell type specific and may depend on the relative abundance of molecules that participate in the makeup of mTORC's macromolecular complexes [8, 9] . Consequently the inhibitory outcome of rapalogues on tumor growth is not universal [7] . Therefore, in rapamycin-sensitive cancer cells, delineating rapamycin downstream effectors that modulate tumor growth and response to anti-neoplastic treatment is likely to lead to discovery of new compounds that will inhibit tumor growth and/or enhance its sensitivity to established therapies. Such molecules are expected to circumvent the resistance of cancer cells to drugs that target upstream components of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway while having only a partial effect on its global activities.",

            "text": "In the present study we report that inhibition of mTOR leads to increased phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 -a subunit of eIF2. To date, contrasting reports have been published regarding the involvement of mTOR in eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . However, the present study demonstrates that in estrogendependent rapamycin-sensitive breast cancer MCF-7 cells as well as in triple negative rapamycin-insensitive MDA-MB-231 cells, inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin and by specific catalytic inhibitor (Ku-0063794) respectively, leads to increased phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1. When bound to GTP, eIF2 recruits Met\u00b7tRNA MET to the ribosome which then scans the capped mRNA. Following recognition of the initiation codon and GTP hydrolysis, the inactive eIF2\u00b7GDP is released and recycled into an active eIF2\u00b7GTP complex via interaction with the guanine nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B [17] . Under normal physiological conditions, eIF2\u03b1 facilitates the interaction of eIF2 with eIF2B [18] . However, phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 at its Ser 51 turns eIF2 from a substrate of eIF2B into its competitive inhibitor, leading to a reduction in the level of eIF2\u0387GTP\u0387Met\u00b7tRNA MET complex and to attenuation of global protein translation. Importantly, because the cellular level of eIF2 is in excess of eIF2B, a slight increase in eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation can sequester a major fraction of eIF2B [17] . In mammalian cells eIF2\u03b1 is phosphorylated by four different kinases which respond differentially to various stress signals [17] , and its dephosphorylation is conducted by the catalytic subunit of phospho-protein phosphatase 1 (PP1c) in complex with specific regulatory subunits e.g. the constitutive repressor of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation (CreP) or the stress-induced growth arrest and DNA damage inducible protein (GADD34) [19] . Salubrinal -an inhibitor of eIF2\u03b1 dephosphorylation -interferes with the association of PP1c and its regulatory subunits, thereby leading to increased eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation. Its application to various cell systems in vitro has been employed to elucidate the physiological relevance of increased eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation to cell survival [20, 21] .",

            "text": "The molecular outcome and physiological relevance of increased eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation has been extensively studied during endoplasmic reticulum (ER) overload where it is generally thought to exert a protective role. In response to increased ER load PKR-like ER-localized eIF2\u03b1 kinase (PERK) is activated and a transient increase in eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation ensues [22] . This leads to a global attenuation of protein translation that may go hand in hand with increased translation of specific mRNAs that possess either an internal-ribosomeentry-site element [23] or short open reading frames in their 5' leader [17] . The global attenuation of protein translation diminishes ER load, while specific proteins whose translation is increased activate transcription of genes that modulate cellular response to stress. The alleviation of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation is required in order to enable the translation of the new transcriptome [24] Exposure of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) to anticancer agents -such as doxorubicin or histone deacetylase inhibitors -also led to increased phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1, albeit a sustained rather than a transient one [25, 26] . In these studies modified MEF carrying the non-phosphorylatable eIF2\u03b1 A/A mutations showed higher sensitivity to the drugs than their S/S wild-type counterparts leading to the conclusion that the drug-induced increase in eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation is protective against cell death. However, while tightly regulated phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 may be protective, an excessive and sustained eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation may be as harmful as its total abrogation. Indeed, it has been noted that while tightly regulated phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 is required for proper embryonic development, a deficiency in phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1 signaling, due to homozygosity for eIF2\u03b1 A/A as well as excessive phosphorylation resulting from a knockout of CReP, a mutation that leads to inhibition of eIF2\u03b1 dephosphorylation, are associated with fetal anemia and growth retardation [22] . Also, mutation in PERK and inhibition of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation result in beta-cells death and Wolcott-Rallison syndrome, and similarly excessive eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation in TSC mutated cells following exposure to ER stressor inhibits expression of stressinduced transcriptome leading to cell death [24] .",

The theoretical additive effect, of combined anti-neoplastic treatments, on cell-survival was calculated according to the following formula: 100 x SFa x SFb (SFa = surviving fraction of cells treated with agent 'a'; SFb = surviving fraction of cells treated with agent 'b'). An experimentally determined surviving fraction that is lower than the calculated one indicates that the two agents have an enhanced rather than an additive inhibitory effect on cell survival. The underlying assumption of this equation is that the agents act independently of each other within the same population. The cellular fraction in percent that does not survive treatment (IF)% is equal to: [1-surviving fraction] x100 and the theoretical additive inhibitory effect of agents a and b on the size of killed cellular fraction in percent -(IFab)% is equal to [29] : 100",

The HeLa [33, 34] cells were a gift from Dr. Dahm-Daphi, University of Hamburg and the U2OS were a gift from Dr. Scully, Harvard Medical School [32, 34] . The assay was performed essentially as described by Moyal et al. and Seluanov et al. [34, 35] except that cells were treated with 4.5 \u00b5M salubrinal 6 hours prior to transfection with plasmids expressing I-SceI (or empty vector in controls). For measurement of NHEJ, cells were co-transfected with I-SceI expressing vector and pDsRed2-N1 at a ratio of 10:1. Transfection was performed with LT1 DNA transfection reagent (Mirus Bio LLC.) according to manufacturer's instructions. Parallel, wild type GFP and DsRed expressing cells as well as negative controls were used for FACS calibration (adjusting voltage and color compensation). NHEJ activity was followed at the noted time post-transfection with I-SceI by monitoring GFP expression in DsRed expressing cells. Detection was performed by FACSCalibur at 50,000 events per sample. For determination of HR activity the fraction of I-SceI dependent GFP expressing cells was divided by the transfection efficiency in these cells as described by Moyal et al. [34] . Under our experimental conditions, the effect of salubrinal on the average fluorescence intensity in GFP expressing cells was always less than 10%, indicating that the noted effect of salubrinal on DNA repair does not result from inhibition of translation. Also, as shown in Table S1 in File S1, salubrinal did not alter the cell cycle distribution of U2OS cells indicating that the inhibitory effect of salubrinal on HRR activity following transfection with I-SceI results from direct inhibition of repair and not from an effect on the fraction of cells in S phase.",

Decreased survival of these cells is taken as a proof for the protective role played by eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation. However, this interpretation does not take into account the possibility mentioned above that while a regulated phosphorylation may be protective its total abrogation as well as its excessive manifestation may be equally harmful. Our experiments with salubrinal and with the eIF2\u03b1 variants show that sustained increase in eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation is detrimental to the cells' survival. We also showed that level of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation that is tolerated by non-irradiated cells is harmful in irradiated ones. The fact that treatment with salubrinal decreases expression of surface ESA, suggests that increasing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation is likely to affect the self renewal capacity of the cells.",

This hypothesis is in line with the recent findings of Raven et al. who demonstrated that increased PKR or PERK activity in the presence of an increased eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation leads to proteasomal degradation of cyclin D1 [45] . While this work was in progress Kim et al. showed that in cells that do not express caspase-3, radiation increased ER stress leading to activation of PERK and increased phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1, autophagy and sensitivity to radiation [46] . We have previously shown that similar to rapamycin radiation leads to inhibition of mTORC1 functions [27] .
