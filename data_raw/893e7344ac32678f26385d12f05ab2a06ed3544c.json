Recent examples of emerging infectious diseases in humans with a wildlife origin include severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Nipah virus and Ebola virus. Wildlife can act as a source and reservoir of diseases of domestic livestock such as bovine tuberculosis and avian influenza, and can result in significant economic losses [7] , [8] , [9] . Emerging diseases may also directly threaten wildlife health and biodiversity, as demonstrated in recent years by the emergence of white nose syndrome, Tasmanian devil facial tumour disease (DFTD) and chytridiomycosis [10] , [11] , [12] , [13] . In Australia a number of diseases have emerged over the last 15 years with confirmed or suspected involvement of wildlife. Many of these diseases have had significant impacts on biodiversity, human health and domestic animal health, including chytrid fungus, DFTD, Australian bat lyssavirus (ABLV), Menangle virus, Japanese encephalitis and Hendra virus [14] , [15] , [16] .",

There are however inherent difficulties in conducting effective wildlife disease surveillance. Many wildlife disease events go unrecognised due to remote locations and a lack of obviously ill individuals or carcasses. Further challenges include a lack of validated diagnostic tests and laboratory capacity for the investigation of wildlife diseases, under-developed surveillance networks, difficulties in determining key parameters such as prevalence for diseases in wildlife populations, and lack of accurate ecological data on population size and density [17] , [18] . Collection and validation of wildlife disease data can be challenging due to lack of funding, the 'anecdotal' nature of some reports, and the need to integrate data from disparate sources [16] .",

The AWHN manages wildlife health data through a national web-based database known as eWHIS (the 'electronic Wildlife Health Information System'). A key component of the wildlife health surveillance system are the 'wildlife coordinators', with a government representative in each of Australia's states and territories. Wildlife coordinators manage wildlife disease investigations in their jurisdiction and report data into eWHIS. State, territory and commonwealth agriculture, environment and human health agencies, universities, private veterinary practices and zoos all contribute to Australia's coordinated wildlife health surveillance system.

Zoos also have strong linkages with a broad network of wildlife rehabilitators, wildlife researchers, conservation organisations and environmental officers in their districts. For these reasons, the existing framework for the national reporting of wildlife disease information was expanded to include zoo veterinarians working with free-ranging wildlife. A pilot project demonstrated that a zoo based surveillance program was able to capture useful information on disease in free-ranging wildlife that might otherwise not have been reported into the national system, or was reported earlier than would otherwise have occurred. The program has the ability to capture valuable information on diseases of humans and domestic animals originating from wildlife, diseases in threatened species and recognised syndromes of unknown aetiology.",

Geographic coverage of cases reported through the project was, as expected, clustered around the physical locations of the participating zoos, which are primarily in or near the major population centres in coastal areas of Australia. This reflects the inherent bias of general surveillance systems. Although primarily in coastal locations, the zoos are situated in a variety of geographic and climatic zones, and in both urban and rural settings. This source of surveillance information does not stand alone, but complements other sources of data. The program also allows clear identification of geographic areas where general surveillance is of lower intensity, which is valuable for planning and assessment of risk. As described, the scope of the project resulted in the collection of only a small proportion of the total caseload of the zoo wildlife hospitals into the eWHIS database (1-8%). The majority of cases presenting to zoo wildlife hospitals involve orphaned animals and cases involving dog, cat or vehicular trauma. Most of these do not align with the categories for reporting, which are selected on the basis of nationally-agreed priorities for wildlife disease surveillance in Australia. Nonetheless a large volume of potentially valuable data is not captured through the program, and this aspect of data collection will be further investigated by the authors. There may also be cases that meet the selection criteria but are not being reported into eWHIS, as the decision on what to report rests with the submitter, however the AWHN provides training and ongoing guidance on case selection to minimise the loss of eligible data.",

These elements form the basis of a successful surveillance program. This program acknowledges the value of data where a range of diagnostic tools, including clinical assessment has been used. As a model, it demonstrates that meaningful surveillance can be conducted in a variety of circumstances, including those where laboratory capacity and financial resources are limited.",

The need for a systematic approach to communication between the human and animal disease surveillance systems in Australia has been outlined [19] . A 'One Health' approach can result in increased interaction between professionals working in the veterinary, medical, wildlife and environmental spheres [14] . In an evaluation of the WNV surveillance program in the USA, an association was found between submission of samples by zoos for WNV testing and the level of communication between the zoos and the public health agency [24] . The authors concluded that a greater awareness of the importance of surveillance by zoos could result in better collaboration and detection of possible human health threats from animal disease events.",

The pilot project demonstrated the potential of the program to widen this network and raise the level of awareness of emerging diseases and diseases of potential national importance.

The Australian zoo based wildlife disease surveillance program uses a collaborative approach involving government and the zoo industry, with a focus on collecting and reporting of wildlife disease events with potential impact on human health, livestock health and biodiversity. It provides a strong model for a disease surveillance program for free-ranging wildlife that could be adapted and utilised in other contexts. There is potential for expansion of the program to groups outside of zoo hospitals such as private veterinary practitioners from 'sentinel' hospitals with a high wildlife caseload, veterinary hospitals run by animal welfare organisations and universities involved in clinical wildlife work and research. Integration of these groups into the national wildlife health surveillance system has the potential to assist in the early detection of emerging diseases in Australia's freeranging wildlife population.",
