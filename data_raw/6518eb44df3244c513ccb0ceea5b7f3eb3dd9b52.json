            "text": "Emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases caused by RNA viruses pose a critical public health threat. Next generation sequencing (NGS) is a powerful technology to define genomic sequences of the viruses. Of particular interest is the use of whole genome sequencing (WGS) to perform phylogeographic analysis, that allows the detection and tracking of the emergence of viral infections. Hantaviruses, Bunyaviridae, cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in humans. We propose to use WGS for the phylogeographic analysis of human hantavirus infections. A novel multiplex PCR-based NGS was developed to gather whole genome sequences of Hantaan virus (HTNV) from HFRS patients and rodent hosts in endemic areas. The obtained genomes were described for the spatial and temporal links between cases and their sources. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrated geographic clustering of HTNV strains from clinical specimens with the HTNV strains circulating in rodents, suggesting the most likely site and time of infection. Recombination analysis demonstrated a genome organization compatible with recombination of the HTNV S segment. The multiplex PCR-based NGS is useful and robust to acquire viral genomic sequences and may provide important ways to define the phylogeographical association and molecular evolution of hantaviruses.",

Hantaviruses are the causative agents of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Eurasia and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in the Americas [13] [14] [15] . They are a significant public health threat with ~200,000 clinical cases reported annually and a fatality rate ranging from 1 to 35% worldwide 16 . Hantaviruses are transmitted to human via the respiratory route of aerosolized infectious particles from rodent excreta or bite of infected rodents. Apodemus agrarius is the reservoir of Hantaan virus (HTNV), an etiological agent of HFRS in the Republic of Korea (ROK) and China 17 . Common symptoms of HFRS include headache, myalgia, abdominal and back pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The typical disease course consists of five phases; febrile, hypotensive, oliguric, diuretic, and convalescent 18 . The febrile phase is an initial stage defined by fever, pains, and edema during 3-5 days. The hypotensive phase lasts few hours and identified as decreased blood pressure, internal bleeding, proteinuria, and thrombocytopenia. The oliguric phase lasts for 3-7 days and is marked by renal dysfunction (reduced urine output), hypervolemia, and blood electrolyte imbalance. The diuretic (increased urine output) and convalescent phases are recovery stages that last for several weeks to months, and is characterized by progressive improvements in glomerular filtration rate, renal blood flow, and urine output control. A critical hallmark of HFRS is capillary leakage that results in edema and hemorrhage, suggesting that the vascular endothelium is damaged by cytokine storm against HTNV infection 19 . Hantavirus infections remain less understandable due to the lack of animal experimental models, difficulties in propagating the agent, and reverse genetic tools.",

This analysis provided mechanisms to identify the location where the soldiers most likely acquired HTNV infections and under what conditions. The analysis of 354 bp-partial sequence of HTNV M segment between HFRS patients and rodent hosts may be insufficient to better define the phylogeographic link for future cases because of the low resolution. A recent study demonstrated that whole genome sequencing of Lassa virus enhanced the resolution of phylogenetic analysis for the molecular diversity and genomic characteristic compared to the partial sequences 21 . The extension of HTNV tripartite genomic sequences was limited because of the lack of NGS technology and ultra-low copy of viral RNA in clinical samples. Notably, whole genome sequences of HTNV was obtained from HFRS patient sera by multiplex PCR-based NGS using the primer set specific for HTNV L, M, and S segments. This attempt yielded enhanced levels of viral reads throughout the NGS, demonstrating the complete open reading frame genomic sequences of HTNV S and M segments. The multiplex PCR-based NGS is robust and efficient for acquiring the whole genome sequence of HTNV from HFRS patients as well as wild rodent hosts.",

ROKA13-8 and ROKA14-11 (Korean army HFRS patients) formed a cluster with HTNV strains from Cheorwon-B and TBTA-S, respectively. Patient ROKA13-8 was assigned to Hwacheon, but conducted military training in Cheorwon. ROKA13-8 was phylogenetically associated with HTNV strains in Cheorwon-B suggesting the Soldier was most likely infected with HTNV during the training in Cheorwon. This result also suggested that patient ROKA14-11 conducted military activity and was the most likely infected with HTNV near TBTA-S in Paju. Phylogenetic analysis of US Army HFRS patient US8A14-2 showed a close relationship with HTNV strains from DN in Paju. This result and clinical records suggested the Soldier was the most likely infected with HTNV at DN between November 17 and 20, fell within the normal incubation period of HTNV. The US Army HFRS patient US8A15-1 conducted military training at MPRC, Pocheon. The phylogenetic association of US8A15-1 with HTNV strains in Pocheon identified the most likely site infection. The phylogenetic and geographic analyses of HTNV whole genome sequences from the patients and natural reservoirs provide an epidemiological diagnostic and surveillance system for annual endemic HTNV infections, identifying the most likely site of infection and under what conditions the infection was acquired. These data contribute to the development of disease risk analyses and preventive measures by changing the environment that reduces rodent habitat and training site avoidance during periods of highest risk 22 .",

The frequency of the recombination of hantavirus tripartite genomes may be associated with the function of proteins encoded on the L, M, and S segments. Diverse recombinants generated by the exchange of different genetic information could be present. For instance, Seoul virus, Andes virus, Tula virus, and Pummala virus generated the S segment recombinants, whereas the M segment recombination was observed in HTNV, China 26 . In this study, the phylogenetic tree demonstrated L and M segments of US8A15-1 formed clusters with HTNV in Pocheon but the partial sequence of S segment of the HTNV was closely associated to that of HTNV in Hwacheon. This observation suggests that US8A15-1 appears to be an S segment recombination of HTNV with 0.659 of RDPRCS and P-value < 0.05. In addition, the exchange of genetic components may be a critical factor in the pathogenicity of the viral infections 27 .

The Multiplex PCR product was prepared using a TrueSeq Nano DNA LT sample preparation kit (Illumina, San Diego, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions to generate MiSeq sequencing libraries. The samples were mechanically fragmented using an M220 focused ultrasonicator (Covaris, Woburn, USA). The cDNA amplicon was size-selected, poly-A-tailed, and ligated with indexes and adaptors, followed by the enrichment with 5 \u03bc l of PCR primer cocktail and 20 \u03bc l of enhanced PCR mixture. Quality control of the libraries was performed using an Agilent DNA 1000 chip kit or High-sensitivity DNA chip kit on a bio-analyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, USA). The libraries were quantified by real-time PCR using the Library Quantification Kit for Illumina sequencing platforms (KAPA Biosystems, Wilmington, USA) using a Quantstudio 6 Flex Real-Time PCR System (Life Technologies). The libraries were normalized to a concentration of 12 pM using hybridization buffer. Sequencing was run on a MiSeq benchtop sequencer (Illumina) with 2 \u00d7 150 bp using a MiSeq reagent V2 (Illumina).
