While many promising biotherapeutics are being tested, the search for a small molecule has yet to deliver an approved drug or therapeutic for the Ebola or similar filoviruses that cause haemorrhagic fever. Two recent high throughput screens published in 2013 did however identify several hits that progressed to animal studies that are FDA approved drugs used for other indications. The current computational analysis uses these molecules from two different structural classes to construct a common features pharmacophore. This ligand-based pharmacophore implicates a possible common target or mechanism that could be further explored. A recent structure based design project yielded nine co-crystal structures of pyrrolidinone inhibitors bound to the viral protein 35 (VP35). When receptor-ligand pharmacophores based on the analogs of these molecules and the protein structures were constructed, the molecular features partially overlapped with the common features of solely ligand-based pharmacophore models based on FDA approved drugs. These previously identified FDA approved drugs with activity against Ebola were therefore docked into this protein. The antimalarials chloroquine and amodiaquine docked favorably in VP35. We propose that these drugs identified to date as inhibitors of the Ebola virus may be targeting VP35. These computational models may provide preliminary insights into the molecular features that are responsible for their activity against Ebola virus in and and we propose that this hypothesis could be readily tested. vitro in vivo",

More importantly this suggests we should have been prepared for a pathogen which has been known about for nearly forty years. The current EBOV outbreak is already proving remarkably costly in terms of the mortality and financial ramifications 1, 2 . The best approaches to EBOV so far have relied on public health measures for containment 3 which have been used in past outbreaks 4 . These lessons with EBOV will undoubtedly be important for the next virus outbreak 5 but they also raise many questions 6 which point to how little we know about these viruses in general, as well as how best to share knowledge openly 7 .",

Two recent studies utilized high-throughput screens of a subset of FDA approved drugs against different EBOV strains (Zaire and Sudan) in vitro and in vivo. These independent reports suggested the promise of the antimalarials amodiaquine and chloroquine in one study 8 , while the selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) clomiphene and toremifene were active in another 9 . Chloroquine to date has not progressed beyond the mouse EBOV model used in these studies. We hypothesized that we could use these four molecules to computationally define the features that are important for activity. The previous studies were not exhaustive screens of all FDA drugs and so we have taken this opportunity to suggest additional compounds. Looked at from another perspective \"non-antiviral\" drugs may be worth following up even though their molecular mechanism is unknown. These compounds may themselves have broad antiviral activity as reports describe modest inhibitory activity against other viruses 10-13 .",

This identified key features. The pharmacophore was then used to search various databases (for which up to 100 molecule conformations with the FAST conformer generation method with the maximum energy threshold of 20 kcal/mol, were created). The pharmacophore was then used to search the Microsource Spectrum database (http://www.msdiscovery.com/spectrum.html) as well as the CDD FDA drugs dataset (https://www.collaborativedrug.com/ pages/public_access).

The most interesting observations from this virtual screen are that various estradiol analogs score well (e.g. estradiol valerate Fit value 4.23). Previously estradiol was suggested to be active in the EBOV pseudotype assay in vitro 8 . In addition, dibucaine was also retrieved (Fit value 1.58) which was also active in the EBOV pseudotype assay 8 .

Candidate predicted actives may be assessed by their Fit Value to the pharmacophore model. This score can be used to prioritize compounds for eventual testing. In the current study it was hypothesized that two different classes of compounds showing activity against EBOV in vitro and in vivo may share a common pharmacophore. Construction of this pharmacophore ( Figure 1 ) indicated four hydrophobic features and a hydrogen bond acceptor feature. This pharmacophore (with an added van der Waals surface to limit the number of hits retrieved) was then used to screen and score other FDA drugs from score particularly well in terms of docking to VP35. If this is the case it could provide a means to follow up with other small molecule analogs and/or additional FDA approved drugs that could target this protein-protein interaction. As with our other tuberculosis-focused research 32,33 , and computational approaches to repositioning compounds 34 we embrace the essentiality for computational predictions to be interrogated through rigorous experimental studies. For example at least two in silico docking studies screened commercially available compounds 14,15 . We propose that docking FDA approved drugs could also be a viable first step to identifying potential compounds that could be used. We are actively seeking collaborators with experience with EBOV assays to enable further translational studies. We believe this computationally inspired approach may be applicable for other known infectious pathogens that do not have current treatments such as other viruses related to Ebola. Ultimately we need to be able to leverage such approaches to provide antivirals for future pathogens.",

            "text": "Recently identified co-crystal structures of the EBOV VP35 protein were used to derive receptor-ligand pharmacophores. These nine receptor-ligand pharmacophores suggested the importance of hydrophobic, hydrogen bonding and negative ionizable interactions to interfere with this protein-protein interaction ( Table 1) . Eight out of nine of the pharmacophores had one or more hydrogen bond acceptor feature. These pharmacophores are grossly similar to our ligand based pharmacophore (derived from four FDA approved drugs that inhibit EBOV), as both types of model had multiple hydrophobic features and at least one hydrogen bond acceptor. When we docked the antimalarials and SERMs into a representative VP35 structure these compounds were found to overlap with the X-ray ligand to differing extents. Amodiaquine and chloroquine had LibDock scores greater than 90 and higher than that for the redocked X-ray ligand. This indicated that VP35 may be a potential target for these two distinct classes of compounds. However, it is important to point out that we have not compared docking to other proteins in EBOV and it could also be possible that these molecules are active elsewhere as well as via other mechanisms than by specific binding to proteins 28,29 . Further, VP35 may be a preferred target for the antimalarials while the SERMs are not predicted to bind as well as the X-ray ligand. The use of other docking and scoring methods may produce differences in the pose and predicted binding affinity, which could be of interest for further studies.",

Our pharmacophore model for SERMs and aminoquinolines suggests that these compounds share multiple chemical features based on their overlap to the four hydrophobic features and a hydrogen bond acceptor ( Figure 1E ) and they may have a common mechanism or target. We suggest that VP35 may be the likely target based on the overlap of receptor-based pharmacophores and docking into the crystal structure. Amodiaquine and chloroquine Figure S1 .

            "text": "Response: As explained earlier, our study is not intended to be an exhaustive evaluation of docking tools, we have used different computational approaches to suggest that the FDA drugs may have a common pharmacophore, which seems to be similar to that of the ligands co-crystallized with VP-35. Finally docking suggests they may fit into the pocket that the co-crystal ligands bind to. The work proposes that the compounds could fit in the binding site, but it is unclear what additional value more docking would add unless we were going to try to predict and then generate the X-ray structure of these FDA drugs. Certainly if experts in docking or crystallography want to pursue this target they can.",

It's pretty clear that a wide variety of drugs could fit based on the binding site size and accessibility.",

Response: this is indeed a very good point. We are not experts on these proteins. I think the proposed work could be done, the difficulty may be that there is no crystal structure (that I can see) with a ligand bound that would be a useful guide to binding in this pocket and would be essential for a receptor-ligand pharmacophore to be built. In summary, the manuscript describes an interesting and fast approach to identify putative inhibitors for a currently serious target as Ebola virus. Although their results should be experimental validated to confirm their finding, this computational study and further extensions of it are of the great value.",
