The conversion is catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and other enzymes that selectively cleave the peptide bond between the proline and the phenylalanine at the carboxyl terminus of Ang II. The contribution of various enzyme activities that collectively lead to the formation of Ang-(1-7) from Ang II, in both normal conditions and in disease states, remains only partially understood. This is largely due to the lack of a reliable and sensitive method to detect these converting activities in complex samples, such as blood and tissues. Here, we report a fluorometric method to measure carboxypeptidase activities that cleave the prolinephenylalanine dipeptide bond in Ang II. This method is also suitable for measuring the conversion of apelin-13. The assay detects the release of phenylalanine amino acid in a reaction with the yeast enzyme of phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL). When used in cell and mouse organs, the assay can robustly measure endogenous Ang II and apelin-13-converting activities involved in the reninangiotensin and the apelinergic systems, respectively.",

            "text": "of endogenous Ang-(1-7) forming enzymes naturally expressed in organs. This method takes advantage of the fact that Ang II can only be converted to Ang-(1-7) by splitting phenylalanine (Phe) from the carboxyl end of Ang II. The phenylalanine-based assay described in this report does not capture the formation of peptides other than Ang-(1-7) resulting from Ang II (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) cleavage. It therefore provides a specific approach to study enzymes that convert Ang II to Ang-(1-7) when Ang II is used as the substrate. We note that a similar concept was used before 27, 28 . However, the validity of the general approach pertinent to catalytic parameters was not investigated comprehensively or in any detail. Instead, we systematically studied the reactions using peptidase ACE2 as a benchmark model in both simple and complex systems. We now demonstrated the usefulness of the method, and established an optimized working protocol that greatly expands the general applications of the method. Because the amino acid phenylalanine is stable in any tissue lysis conditions, the method is also amenable for experiments designed to screen for new enzymes that degrade Ang II and form Ang- (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) . This fluorescence-based assay is time-saving, quantitative and reliable to measure specific Ang II to Ang-(1-7) converting activity in complex biological samples. In addition, we tested this assay with another peptide substrate, apelin-13, which also plays a role in cardiovascular disease 29 . Since apelin-13 can also be degraded through proteolytic removal of the carboxyl terminal phenylalanine (Phe 13 /F) residue 30 , we reasoned that the proposed phenylalaninine assay should be able to also detect the cleavage of apelin-13 by ACE2.",

The new method involves a series of four reactions using synthetic Ang II as the starting substrate. The Ang-II-converting activity is measured as the production rate of L-phenylalanine (Phe) following proteolytic cleavage of the Pro 7 -Phe 8 peptide bond at the carboxyl terminus (the schematics of the reaction is in Fig. 1 ). In the first reaction, Ang II is allowed to react with purified converting enzymes (such as ACE2) or with tissue lysate, in which Ang II to Ang-(1-7) conversion releases the carboxyl terminal Phe 8 (Fig. 1A) . In a coupled reaction, the exposed primary amine (-NH 2 ) group of phenylalanine amino acid is hydrolyzed by phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) of Rhodotorula glutinis and ultimately turns on a fluorescent probe (Fig. 1B) . For illustrative purposes, the color conversion -visible to naked eyes -following the reactions is shown Following the proteolytic cleavage, the amino group of phenylalanine becomes exposed to undergo deamidation by yeast enzyme phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), also termed phenylalanine deaminase. Following a series of coupled reactions, a fluorogenic substrate is converted, and the rate of conversion that reflects the kinetic of the first reaction can be quantitatively measured. (C) The picture shows the color change as the result of the chain of the reaction initiated by ACE2 cleavage of synthetic Ang II peptide. Tubes 1 and 2 are from reactions in the absence and presence of recombinant soluble ACE2 (rsACE2: aa 1-740), respectively; tubes 3 and 4 are each from reactions with the addition of culture medium from cells transfected with either pcDNA3 empty vector or a soluble ACE2-expressing plasmid respectively. Positive ACE2 enzymatic activities in 2 and 4 convert fluorogenic substrate to bright pink color visible to naked eyes (with emission at 587 nm).

Among them is apelin-13, a peptide also cleaved by ACE2 30 . ACE2 can cleave the peptide bond preceding Phe 77 31 causing inactivation of apelin 32 . A potent stimulator of cardiac contractility, apelin exists in a number of active polypeptide forms: apelin-13 (aa 65-77), apelin-17 (aa 61-77) and apelin-36 (aa 42-77), all carry the dipeptide motif at their carboxy termini and are expected to react with ACE2.

We have previously made recombinant soluble ACE2 (rsACE2 of murine: aa 1-740 of the extracellular catalytic segment) and tested its activity using Mca-APK(Dnp) 33 . We sought to determine the dynamic performance of the assay in dose-response studies (Fig. 2 ). Eight reactions with two-fold serially diluted rsACE2 were monitored for over 60 minutes in presence of phenylalanine assay regents ( Fig. 2A-B ). With the same amount of substrate in each reaction, both Ang II and apelin-13 gave similar results (A compared to B), showing that the reaction conditions had allowed complete dose separation in each series. The results also showed that relative fluorescence intensity reached a plateau within 30 min in the highest ACE2 groups ( Fig. 2A-B) . Therefore, we used 30 min as the optimized first-step reaction time for the following two-steps phenylalanine assays (details in Methods). To evaluate the suitability of the phenylalanine assay for quantitative analysis, we performed analysis of the Ang II and apelin-13 converting activity using rsACE2. First, we incubated an excess quantity of ACE2 in reactions with variable amount of substrate for 30 min followed by phenylalanine reaction. The substrate-fluorescence dependent curve was derived using non-linear regression (Fig. 2C,D) . Then, we performed phenylalanine assay to calculate the kinetic parameters for rsACE2 by measuring the catalysis rate against Ang II and apelin-13, respectively. The K m value of rsACE2 for Ang II was 20.48 \u03bc M and that for apelin-13 was 23.23 \u03bc M. The V max value for Ang II was 2.164 nmol/min/ug protein and for apelin-13 was 2.459 nmol/min/ug protein (Fig. 2C,D) . Of note, rsACE2 showed very similar catalytic efficiencies toward Ang II and apelin-13 substrates.",

Both methods measured ACE2 activities that not only correlated with the input concentrations of the enzyme, but also highly correlated to each other (R 2 of 0.9958, Fig. 3C ).

Therefore, the ACE2 specific inhibitor MLN-4760 are used in conjunction with MCA-APK(Dnp) to measure activity exclusively attributed to ACE2 33 .

Recombinant ACE2 was used as a benchmark control in order to cross-reference between the two assays. As previously reported by us and others 33, 36, 37 , there is minimal serum ACE2 activity measured for Mca-APK(Dnp) (Fig. 5C ).

These results suggest that Ang-(1-7) formation from Ang II in serum is to a large extent ACE2-independent, although this converting activity is relative low and might be undetectable as reported by others using other methods that used a small amount of serum 15 .

As the reaction proceeded with Ang II, the reading of phenylalanine levels increases steadily over time (supplementary Fig. S1A ). This is in stark contrast to the reaction that maintained a constant intensity of phenylalanine signal when Ang II was absent, suggesting that reaction signals were derived from Ang II-conversion, instead from any protein substrates in tissue lysate. Endogenous phenylalanine levels tend to vary (up to 2 mg/ dL in blood) depending on diet. We next performed desalting of the lysate to remove endogenous phenylalanine (details in Methods) and then subjected the resulting tissue lysates to phenylalanine assay (no Ang II added to the reactions). As expected, desalting reduced background intensities in a majority of mouse tissues tested, most notably in serum (supplementary Fig. S1B ). Therefore, we adapted this desalting step in tissue preparation in subsequent experiments. The assay can equally be performed without the step but then it requires subtraction from baseline phenylalanine activity.",

By contrast, phenylalanine was stably produced throughout the course of the 120 min reaction (Fig. 6A) . Evidently, the net Ang-(1-7) levels were influenced by the rates of its formation and degradation, and the commonly used EIA method may not truly represent Ang-(1-7) formation activity.

Even with the best setting, the dynamic range is less than one order of magnitude, as opposed to the three orders of magnitude range achieved by the Ang II phenylalanine assay (Figs 2 and 3) . The clinical importance of the RAAS in a multitude of diseases underscores the need for techniques to measure enzymatic activities in biological samples, such as blood and tissues. The new method could have broad applications for analyzing biological and clinical samples. For instance, when used with pure enzymes including those known to have Ang II converting activities, such as prolylcarboxypeptidase (PrCP) 44, 45 , prolylendopeptidase (PEP/PrEP) 46 , alongside ACE2, it may provide meaningful comparison of kinetic parameters as well as tissue specific distribution and activity of these carboxypeptidases. Furthermore, since we demonstrated that the assay is also suited for analyzing serum and tissue lysates, potential applications of the technique to clinical samples are possible. The sample volume required for the test is diminutive which makes it feasible for both research and clinical use. Of particular importance, the new test may shed light on regulations of Ang II degradation in health and disease states.",

Previous studies that measured Ang-(1-7) formation applied protease inhibitors such as PMSF and bestatin to suppress undesired protease activities 15, 47 . However, the broad-specificity of these inhibitors may also compromise the effort on finding physiologically relevant converting enzymes that might be sensitive to inhibition. In contrast, the phenylalanine approach measures the levels of stable amino acid of phenylalanine, and therefore was used in the absence of general protease inhibitors. Still, we should note the caveats of the new assay. The phenylalanine results likely reflect the combined enzyme activities attributing to phenylalanine formation, including but not limited to Ang II to Ang-(1-7) conversion. For instance, concurrent proteolytic cleavage of Ang II peptide by additional enzymes might happen prior to the release of phenylalanine. Therefore, the new method, when used in conjunction with a selected combinations of specific peptidase inhibitors, may be pursued in the future towards better delineating in vivo Ang II to Ang-(1-7)-converting enzymes.",

The study of animals was approved by the Northwestern University Animal Care and Use Committee (Protocol #IS00000429), and all experiments were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. Eight-week-old female 129/sv mice were purchased from Taconic Farms (Germantown, NY, USA). For the blood activity study, mice received intraperitoneal injection of 50 \u03bc g rsACE2 were subjected to tail-bleeding to collect blood samples in a time-series. Blood was left to clot at room temperature for 15 minutes, and was then centrifuged at 3000 \u00d7 g for 10 minutes to collect serum. For rsACE2 injection experiment, 0.5 \u03bc L of serum was used in each reaction. For measuring endogenous peptidase activities, which tend to have lower activities, a larger volume of 5 \u03bc L was used in each reaction. In tissue sample preparation, we first removed blood through systemic perfusion with cold PBS. Tissues from these mice were homogenized in cold NP-40 lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH = 7.4; 150 mM NaCl and 1% NP-40). Clear lysates were obtained following centrifugation at 20,000 \u00d7 g for 15 minutes at 4\u00b0C. After desalting using Zeba TM column (Thermo-Fisher) to remove endogenous phenylalanine, total protein concentration was determined using Bio-Rad protein assay regent (Bio-Rad), and 10 \u03bc g of each sample was used in the final Mca-APK(Dnp) or phenylalanine assay as described above.",
