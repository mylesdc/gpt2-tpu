Although ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and S-adenosylmethionine are now supported by more and more evidence, and the clinical studies have confirmed that the two kinds of drugs in the treatment of cholestatic liver disease, such as primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), primary sclerosing cholangitis and intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, are effective, the drugs are not only expensive but also work slowly (Mato and Lu, 2007; Corpechot et al., 2008) . Cholestasis as the main clinical manifestation of hepatitis syndrome is difficult to get rapid control of, and the efficacy is not cheap. On the other hand, although there has been evidence of certain clinical efficacy for glucocorticoid (such as dexamethasone, abbreviation for \"DXM\") and other immunosuppressive agents, the obvious side effects of immunosuppression such as weight gain, hyperglycemia, osteoporosis, cataracts, and increased risk of opportunistic infections limit its clinical application (Purohit and Cappell, 2015) . Therefore, it is urgent to develop new drugs with quick action and fewer side effects to treat cholestatic hepatitis.",

More importantly, our previous work revealed that emodin could alleviate intrahepatic cholestasis by promoting the expression of liver farnesoid X receptor (FXR), small heterodimer partner (SHP), uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 2 family polypeptide B4 (UGT2B4), and bile salt export pump (BSEP), which are related to the synthesis, detoxification, and transportation process of Bas (Ding et al., 2016) .",

After being rinsed with distilled water and dehydrated, the sections were made transparent and mounted for microscope examination. After the immunohistochemical analysis, IPP software (image-pro plus 6.0) was used to analyze the optical density of the images as described previously.",

It is mainly expressed on the hepatocytes canalicular membranes and utilizes energy that from ATP hydrolysis to transport intracellular substrates into the extracellular compartment. So BSEP is primarily responsible for the BA excretion (Cheng et al., 2016) and translocates bile salt from hepatocytes into the canaliculus and the multidrug resistance protein 3 (MDR3) translocates phosphatidylcholine from the cytoplasmic to the outer leaflet of the canalicular membrane. Bile salt in the canaliculus facilitates the release of phosphatidylcholine from the outer leaflet and forms phosphatidylcholine-bile salt-mixed micelles, which is critical for the solubilization of biliary cholesterol. Moreover, phosphatidylcholine-bile salt-mixed micelles reduce the toxic activity of bile salts against the bile ducts. Therefore, the proper and coordinated functioning of BSEP and MDR3 is critical for mixed micelle formation and can lead to a decreased solubility of biliary cholesterol and consequently to cholestasis (Mahdi et al., 2016) .",

More importantly, during the process of BA transport, BSEP mainly regulated by FXR plays an important role. BSEP can pump univalent BAs into the bile duct and ultimately into the gallbladder. As the BA receptor, FXR can regulate the gene expression involved in BA metabolism and up-regulate BSEP expression to maintain BA homeostasis in the case of BA overload (Mazuy et al., 2015) . It is worth noting that the BSEP promoter contained a response element of FXR (Ananthanarayanan et al., 2001) , and the expression of BSEP was significantly decreased in FXR knockout mice (Sinal et al., 2000) , which is suggesting that BSEP is a downstream target gene of FXR.",

            "text": "cells (Zhao et al., 2014) . Moreover, the FXR agonist GW4064 can reduce estradiol-induced cholestasis in liver cells (Seok et al., 2014) to increase uptake of bile salts, restore the flow of bile and reduce the levels of serum bile salt. These compounds have been approved for the treatment of PBC and NASH (Neuschwander-Tetri et al., 2015) . Therefore, in order to observe whether emodin could continue to promote the FXR signal pathway in the condition of low and high FXR levels, we chose guggulsterones/siRNA and GW4064/lentivirus to down-or upregulate FXR. There is another natural product, Dioscin is also can rescue intrahepatic cholestasis in ANIT-Induced rat model through regulating transporters, apoptosis, and oxidative stress (Yao et al., 2017) and through regulating Oatps, Mrp2, and Bsep expression . Therefore, in our experiment, we choose BSEP as our target gene for FXR and choose the FXR inhibitor guggulsterone (Zhao et al., 2014) and siRNA to down-regulate and the FXR agonist GW4064 and lentivirus transfection to up-regulate FXR in our cell experiment. For the LO2 cell experiment, the mRNA and protein expressions of FXR and BSEP were significantly elevated in the emodin group compared with control group. Then, the LO2 cells were interfered with guggulsterones or FXR-siRNA to inhibit the FXR. When compared with the guggulsterones/FXR-siRNA group, the mRNA and protein expressions of FXR and BSEP were also significantly elevated in the emodin groups. Furthermore, to confirm the efficacy of emodin after FXR was up-regulated, we interfered LO2 cells with GW4064 or lentivirus to activate the FXR. When compared with the GW4064/lentivirus-up group, the mRNA and protein expressions of FXR and BSEP were also significantly elevated in the emodin groups. GW4064 can significantly reduce the content of triglyceride, cholesterol and free fatty acid induced by high-fat diet in liver (Ma et al., 2013) . Therefore, we speculate that GW4064 could weaken the effect of emodin in promoting the FXR pathway through the degradation of organic solvent that dissolved emodin in this experiment. In vitro experiments, we use the normal, guggulsterone stimulation, GW4064 stimulation and FXR-siRNA or lentivirus-up methods to compare the emodin's positive effect on FXR and BSEP expression, and the results proved that emodin could increase the level of FXR and BSEP, no matter of the basic level of FXR low or high. So it seems like that emodin is an indirect mediator to regulate the expression of FXR. And we verity our idea in rat primary hepatocytes experiment, emodin could also increase the level of FXR and BSEP in rat primary hepatocytes. The FXR-BSEP pathway was activated in ANIT-induced cholestasis rats. After model establishment and treatment, the liver pathological changes and the serum TBIL, DBIL, TBA, ALP, GGT, ALT, and AST were monitored. By emodin intervention, it could be observed that improvement of the hepatic impairment was achieved. The molecules of FXR and BSEP decreased significantly in the model group. After treatment of emodin, the FXR pathways in cholestatic hepatitis were markedly activated, and FXR and BSEP were promoted to some degree.",
