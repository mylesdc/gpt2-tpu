Nine index students from each school will be randomly selected and followed-up to their households. All index household residents will be recruited into the study. A further 3-5 neighbouring households will also be recruited to give a maximum of 350 participants per household setting. The sample size per site is limited by the number of sensors available for data collection. Each participant will wear a wireless proximity sensor lying on their chest area for 7 consecutive days. Data on proximal dyadic interactions will be collected automatically by the sensors only for participants who are face-to-face. Key characteristics of interest include the distribution of degree and the frequency and duration of contacts and their variation in rural and urban areas. These will be stratified by age, gender, role, and day of the week.",

Questionnaire surveys have been conventionally used to collect data on contact patterns 3-6 and networks 7-10 , with increasing focus on studies in resource poor settings where disease burden is high 11-14 . Despite providing invaluable \"who-contacts-whom\" data that can be incorporated into models of infection transmission and control 4,6,15,16 , the questionnaire method suffers several setbacks, key being recall bias and low participation rates 6,14,17 . It has been argued that current transmission dynamic models that omit important factors such as frequency, duration and location of contacts do not adequately capture the heterogeneity of transmission that has direct bearing on intervention measures 18-20 . Methods have been advanced to overcome these limitations of diary data, in particular automated data collection methods. These include wireless sensors embedded in portable devices such as mobile phones and customized wearable sensors that use Bluetooth and WiFi 21,22 , or low power radio frequencies 23-25 , to determine proximity and co-location of users.",

The sensor platform in these studies has been designed to collect proximity data only from individuals facing each other while wearing the sensors, representing conversations or actual physical touch that can lead to infection transmission (www. sociopatterns.org). The majority of studies using this platform reported a high participation rate (\u226575%), suggesting that an unobtrusive way of data collection requiring minimal participant intervention elicits better response rates compared to paper diaries 14 , especially in settings with a high proportion of illiterate individuals 26 . Saturation of study populations to define full networks rapidly encounters boundaries due to logistic, time and cost constraints. However, methods have been developed to effectively impute missing data by generating synthetic networks structure given the underlying properties and also the demographic characteristics of the study population 37 . Most importantly, sensors provide a rich temporal data source, even for partial networks, that can be used to investigate plausible characteristics of infection spread on networks structures weighted by frequency and duration of contacts.",

            "text": "A feasibility study on acceptability and utility of using sensors within five households was conducted in Kilifi over three days of the week 26 . This pioneer study in Africa revealed three key points, particularly relevant to the design of similar studies in resource poor settings. First, individuals were willing to carry the sensors for extended periods of time because they were unobtrusive and did not require user or investigator intervention to collect data. However, the sensors were considered too big to be used on infants. Second, results suggested children spent more time in contact with other children at the household compared to other age groups, while adults appeared to act as bridges between households. Third, within household temporal contact patterns per day were stable across three days of observation, and contacts between individuals of different households were erratic. Residents aged \u226515 years were under-represented due to being away at school or work. This pilot study recommended elaborate community engagement strategies to ensure wider acceptance of study procedures, and proper training of participants on sensor use and storage (e.g. store them separately when sleeping). Current sensors being deployed in recent studies, such as by Ozella et al. 27 are smaller, lighter, round in shape and with an on-board flash memory that can store data over longer periods of time. These properties have made the sensors more suitable for use in larger population-based studies, suggesting that they can be deployed in more hard-to-reach populations particularly infants who bear the biggest brunt of respiratory infections.",

Background sociodemographic data for each individual will be extracted from the KHDSS database and updated manually in case some details are missing. Proximity data will be collected using wearable proximity sensors ( Figure 3A) , henceforth called sensors. The sensors have been developed by the SocioPatterns project (a European consortium of institutions and investigators focused on social dynamics, www.sociopatterns.org). The sensors operate in the 2.4 GHz ISM band of the RF spectrum. The total weight of the sensor inclusive of a lithium coin battery (CR2032) is <6 grams. Sensors exchange ultra-low-power radio packets in a peer-to-peer fashion by transmitting and scanning their neighbourhood for packets sent by nearby tags on a specific radio channel. Sensors in proximity exchange a maximum of 1 data packet per second and can store over 1,000 hours of continuous data collection in an on-board memory. This exchange of low-power radio packets is used as a proxy for the close colocation of individuals wearing the sensors. The proximity between individuals and temporal resolution are estimated from the power levels and timestamps contained in the data packets, respectively. To estimate how close individuals are, the attenuation of the signals with distance is computed as the difference between the received and transmitted power. Proximity between individuals corresponding to a face-toface interaction, such as during a handshake, is asserted when the median attenuation over a given time interval exceeds a specified attenuation threshold (in dBm). All individuals will wear a sensor attached to a lanyard around the neck so that it rests on the chest area ( Figure 3B ) or pinned to the front of a blouse/shirt especially for younger children ( Figure 3C ). In this manner, only face-to-face proximity relations will be detected; moreover, the low-power radio frequency in use cannot propagate through the human body 24 .",

Social contact data are important to understand infection patterns since they underpin the transmission dynamics and are key input parameters in mathematical models that evaluate preventative and control measures against these diseases. To date, very few studies have been conducted in sub-Saharan Africa to elucidate the mechanisms of spread. This study proposed to use wireless proximity sensors to collect data from students in schools and household residents in rural and urban areas of coastal Kenya. Schools and households have been identified as the hubs of transmission for respiratory infections such as RSV 41,52,53 particularly due to prolonged and more intimate contacts at these settings. Results from this study will include the number and duration of contacts and how they vary by age, gender, day of the week, role, and location. With a vaccine against RSV imminent 54 , predictive modelling can be used to support decision making at the national level for control of infectious disease and important to be based on locally collected data.",

First, it is not possible to describe full social networks at participating school and households due to the limited number of sensors available. Nonetheless, this protocol will investigate contacts within schools and households, settings that are important for spread of respiratory infections. An attempt to minimize selection bias is through random selection of students in a school and linking the students to their entire households and neighbours. This study will also develop the body of knowledge on longitudinal patterns of social networks in rural and urban communities in a developing world setting. Due to the spatially restricted data collection sites, it will not be possible to generalize with certainty these results to other settings locally and globally because of differences in demography, social and cultural attributes. This suggests the need to collect additional national and regional studies, with the advantage that this study protocol can be adapted for use elsewhere since the sensors can be reused. In addition to reusability, the current sensors offer additional advantages when compared to a pilot study conducted in the same setting 26 : they are smaller and lighter, can be worn by people of all ages including infants, have a bigger memory and battery capacity meaning that data can be collected over longer periods. This may be effectively used to assess the effect of seasonality on changes in social contacts and disease transmission.",

Only 9 index cases were randomly recruited in each school in this study according to the proportion of gender and grade. In total, only 18 kids were recruited from a rural and urban area in this study while a relatively larger number of teachers (in total 40) were recruited. Is the sample size for the school-aged children large enough to give a good level of resolution of data to reflect kid's contact in school? The actual number of students expected to be recruited randomly per school is 350. This sample size is limited by the number of sensors available for the study, and we expect to get a good resolution of data to reflect the students' contacts in school. Out of these 350 students, 9 index students will be randomly selected and followed up at their households.2. For the recruitment of household member of each index case, if not all, say more than 2/3 of household members, participated study e.g. mother is not willing to take part in this study. How does the data in the mathematical model reflect the role of those absentees of this study contributing to the disease transmission? If more than a third of household members are unwilling to participate, that household will not be recruited. However, this household will be replaced by another neighbouring household until the targeted number of households is achieved. In this protocol, we have not provided the full details of the individual-based model. In brief, the model will simulate a population of N-individuals based on the age profile of all residents enumerated in the KHDSS. Each individual will be assigned an expected number of contacts based on the age-specific probability of contact drawn from the data ensuing from this study.3. I tried to see how the number of subjects recruited (396 and 324 residents) can be achieved based on my best understanding. For a recruited school in an urban area, all family members of 9 index cases, 20 teachers and 5 neighbouring households of the index will arrive at 374 residents (assuming 11 households members in each household). Are teachers recruited in this study in the same class as the selected index cases? From each school, 9 index students will be selected. We will then recruit the entire households of the index students. We will also recruit all residents in 3-5 neighbouring households. Assuming we recruit 3 neighbouring households per index, this will result in {(9*11) + (9*3*11)} = 396 participants for the rural area, as given in the manuscript. The teachers' household members teachers will not be recruited and hence do not account for this number. I had the following, mostly minor, comments:What is the selection process for neighbouring households? For example, if there are 6 neighbouring households, how will only 3-5 be selected? Or if there are only 2 neighbouring households, will a third be chosen? What will happen if some decline to participate? Will the 7 day collection period be the same for all individuals in the study? Or will it be site specific?Are there plans to collect data on the role within a family (father, mother etc.)? This might be useful for interpreting heterogeneity in contact patterns beyond just age. In Figure 2 , it wasn't clear to me what the dotted circles represented. \"the questionnaire method suffers several setbacks, key being recall bias and low participation rates\" -there are some studies comparing diaries and sensors (e.g. Mastrandrea , 2015 ) , so et al.it might be worth considering how the proposed proximity data might relate to existing diary-based 1. What is the selection process for neighbouring households? For example, if there are 6 neighbouring households, how will only 3-5 be selected? Or if there are only 2 neighbouring households, will a third be chosen? What will happen if some decline to participate? All households within the Kilifi Health and Demographic Surveillance Site (KHDSS) have been mapped. The selected index households will be highlighted in a map, and the neighbouring households will be identified physically on the ground. Normally, these neighbouring households would share a boundary with the index household. A research assistant will visit the households in succession and recruit a maximum of five. If the head of a household declines participation, then that household will be skipped.2. Will the 7-day collection period be the same for all individuals in the study? Or will it be site-specific? There are four study sites: rural school, rural households, urban school and urban households. The 7-day period of data collection will be site-specific, and all individuals within the same site will collect data over the same period.3. Are there plans to collect data on the role within a family (father, mother etc.)? This might be useful for interpreting heterogeneity in contact patterns beyond just age.",
