The objectives of this study were to investigate the utility of the temporal scan statistic for detecting MRSA clusters, validate clusters using molecular techniques and hospital records, and determine significant differences in the rate of MRSA cases using regression models. Methods: Patients admitted to a community hospital between August 2006 and February 2011, and identified with MRSA > 48 hours following hospital admission, were included in this study. Between March 2010 and February 2011, MRSA specimens were obtained for spa typing. MRSA clusters were investigated using a retrospective temporal scan statistic. Tests were conducted on a monthly scale and significant clusters were compared to MRSA outbreaks identified by hospital personnel. Associations between the rate of MRSA cases and the variables year, month, and season were investigated using a negative binomial regression model. Results: During the study period, 735 MRSA cases were identified and 167 MRSA isolates were spa typed. Nine different spa types were identified with spa type 2/t002 (88.6%) the most prevalent. The temporal scan statistic identified significant MRSA clusters at the hospital (n = 2), service (n = 16), and ward (n = 10) levels (P \u2264 0.05). Seven clusters were concordant with nine MRSA outbreaks identified by hospital staff. For the remaining clusters, seven events may have been equivalent to true outbreaks and six clusters demonstrated possible transmission events. The regression analysis indicated years 2009-2011, compared to 2006, and months March and April, compared to January, were associated with an increase in the rate of MRSA cases (P \u2264 0.05).",

However, the detection of transmission events is based on limited evidence [1] , and detection of specific pathogen clusters is generally subjective in nature [2] . Furthermore, even well-established infection prevention strategies can be often disregarded [3] at various levels. Overall, these factors may lead to the transmission of pathogens within the hospital, a missed opportunity to investigate a disease cluster, or false ascertainment of a cluster resulting in the misuse of hospital resources for investigational purposes [2] . Statistical methods, such as the scan statistic, may enhance the identification of disease clusters and/or outbreaks in the hospital setting [2, 4] . The scan statistic [5] can be used to detect and evaluate clusters of infectious diseases in space, time, and/or space-time [6] [7] [8] . By understanding the clustering of infectious diseases spatially and/or temporally, potential risk factors can be identified [9] , detailed investigations determining the association between exposures and disease interventions can be facilitated [10] , and outbreaks can be detected [6] .",

In hospitals, identification of outbreaks is routinely based on the examination of microbiological test results and patients' charts [4] , with the definition of an outbreak generally relying on rule-based criteria [2] . However, these types of criteria are prone to error since they fail to address changes in population size or random variation [2] . With the increasing availability of timely surveillance data within the hospital setting, the use of analytical methods may lead to the earlier detection of disease clusters or outbreaks [13] . In hospitals, the incorporation of the scan statistic for the detection of MRSA disease clusters, spatially and/or temporally, has been limited. In one study, a space-time permutation scan statistic was utilized to detect clusters throughout the hospital [2] . However, molecular data were not collected to validate MRSA clusters. In another investigation, a temporal scan statistic, incorporating molecular data, was employed to identify MRSA clusters which were used as a gold standard to evaluate other algorithms for cluster detection [4] . For both investigations, the application of a scan statistic to hospital data resulted in the identification of several significant MRSA clusters that were not identified by hospital personnel. However, as both studies were conducted in academic medical centres, further investigation of the scan statistic for identifying MRSA clusters under different healthcare settings is required [2, 4] .",

The dependent variable and offset were the number of MRSA cases and the natural log of the population at risk (i.e., patient days), respectively, for a particular month. Due to the hierarchical structure of the data, MRSA cases nested in wards, a multilevel Poisson model including a random intercept for ward and a fixed effect for service, was used to adjust for clustering.

The outbreak in the intensive care unit was identified by the temporal scan statistic; however, the cluster was not significant. For the outbreak identified in the ward of the internal medicine department, this particular ward was only operational for 27 of the 55 months that the study was conducted, and therefore, did not meet the inclusion criteria for a temporal scan test to be conducted at the ward level. However, temporal scan tests conducted at the hospital and service (e.g., internal medicine) levels did not result in the identification of a cluster that corresponded in time to the MRSA outbreak. In the participating healthcare facility, specific rule-based criteria (e.g., \u2265 3 HA-MRSA cases in a 2 week period) are not used to establish MRSA outbreaks. Rather, data pertaining to the number of MRSA cases and the time period (i.e., number of days) are used to ascertain if an outbreak exists in the patient population and if an investigation should be initiated. This type of surveillance is subjective in nature and may be prone to under-reporting or overreporting of MRSA outbreaks. Of the 11 short duration (e.g., 1-6 months) clusters that were identified during this investigation, seven events were labelled by the investigators as potential outbreaks due to the large number of MRSA cases identified over a short time period. However, only two of these events could be analyzed at the molecular level, with spa type 2/t002 as the predominant MRSA strain in each cluster. These molecular findings indicate that transmission events may have occurred and that these clusters may have been equivalent to true outbreaks.",

These clusters may represent extended outbreaks, temporal trends, changes in pathogen characteristics, or the representation of systematic changes (e.g., cleaning policies) at the hospital level during the surveillance period. For many of the long duration clusters, several non-spa type 2/t002 MRSA strains were identified in the patient population. These particular MRSA strains may indicate unique transmission events between patients or be part of an outbreak, as researchers have documented the existence of more than one MRSA strain during an outbreak investigation [25, 26] . Alternatively, these non-spa type 2/t002 strains may represent genetic changes within the spa gene, such as deletions or duplications of repeats and point mutations [27] , resulting in different spa types. Based on the MST that was constructed (Figure 2) , six of the spa complexes were closely related to spa type 2/t002 by a difference in one repeat. For MRSA and S. aureus, research exploring the time required for a genetic event to occur has been conducted [28] [29] [30] ; however, results of these investigations are based on specific strains and specific locations of the genetic event. Other plausible explanations for observing diverse spa types in these clusters include the introduction of spa types into the hospital via staff, visitors, and patients which resulted in transmission events, and healthcare workers and patients that may have been colonized with variant MRSA strains.",

This was a major limitation of this study, as there was no prior knowledge of the endemic MRSA strains in this facility. Furthermore, not all MRSA isolates were collected from the hospital's microbiology laboratory for spa typing. Consequently, the true molecular composition for some clusters is not known, and it could not be determined if all cases within clusters were a result of unique transmission events or part of a true outbreak. Lastly, with the identification of a predominant spa type circulating in the patient population, the application of spa typing provided very little benefit for elucidating transmission events or recognizing potential outbreaks, especially for long duration clusters. Although it was not conducted in this study, the incorporation of whole-genome sequencing may be a viable tool for further elucidating possible transmission events and identify potential/true outbreaks in the hospital setting. Whole-genome sequencing provides an inventory of the microevolutionary changes of a bacterium and can be used to map genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphisms, insertions, and deletions to a reference sequence [28] . Furthermore, this typing technique provides the best discrimination between closely related bacterial isolates in a timely manner [1, 29] .",

For spa type 2/t002, nine MRSA isolates were identified as being susceptible to clindamycin whereas all other spa type 2/t002 isolates were resistant. Further investigation of these nine MRSA isolates revealed that three isolates were identified in the same internal medicine cluster (Cluster ID 7; n = 2 in May, 2010; n = 1 in December, 2010) and three isolates were identified in the same surgery cluster (Cluster ID 13; n = 1 in July, 2010; n = 1 in August, 2010; n = 1 in September, 2010). The identification of identical spa types and antibiograms in two long duration clusters, suggests that transmission events among patients, hospital staff, or possibly even the contaminated environment, may have occurred. For spa types 23/t548, 93/ t026, 268/t067, and 387/t653, it was noted that these particular spa types had indistinguishable antimicrobial profiles. This demonstrates that for the identification of transmission events and the determination of cases as outbreak or non-outbreak, relying on antibiogram data may result in inaccurate findings and the misclassification of cases as MRSA strains that differ genotypically may display identical antimicrobial susceptibility profiles. During the study period, the incidence rate of MRSA fluctuated considerably, with significant increases noted in years 2009-2011. Starting in December 2008, Ontario hospitals were required to report the number of newly acquired HA-MRSA bacteremias on a quarterly basis, to be posted on a web site that is accessible to the public [31] . Although the figures are affiliated with bacteremias only, the public reporting of MRSA did not result in a dramatic decrease in the overall incidence of MRSA in this facility, which is in contrast to C. difficile. In September 2008, monthly data on C. difficile infections (CDIs) from Ontario hospitals were also posted on a publicly accessed web site [32] . At the participating hospital, a separate analysis of CDIs demonstrated that in 2006 and 2007, there were significantly more cases of CDI, compared to 2008 and 2009 (data not shown). It is theorized that the decrease in C. difficile case rates may be attributable to hospitals adhering to best practices in C. difficile prevention due to the mandatory public reporting of rates [33] . It was anticipated that this would also apply to MRSA; however, this was not observed. The significant increases in the incidence rate of MRSA cases in years 2009-2011, based on the final multivariable model and model-based contrasts, are concordant with the findings from the temporal scan statistic as approximately 60% of the clusters identified spanned 2009-2011. The increase in the MRSA case rate during this time period may have been due to the presence of respiratory viruses (e.g., influenza) within the hospital. Reports of increased hospital MRSA rates during outbreaks of respiratory pathogens have been published [34, 35] . In the northern hemisphere, influenza season occurs from October to March [36] . For 2009-2010, in addition to the regular influenza season, the H1N1 influenza pandemic was identified in Canada [37] and H1N1 patients were admitted to the participating facility. An increase in the MRSA case rate may have occurred as infection control activities and surveillance were focused on influenza and away from MRSA [34] , reduced staffing as a result of illness, antimicrobial prescribing practices [35] especially with fluoroquinolones which may have led to an increase in the risk for acquiring MRSA [38] , and environmental contamination of MRSA which may have resulted in transmission events among staff and patients.",

Seasonal variation in MRSA is debatable with some studies documenting spring [39] or summer [40, 41] with increased MRSA rates. However, in these studies, specific aspects of MRSA infections (e.g., community-acquired, healthcare-acquired, severe only) were investigated. A significant increase in the rate of MRSA cases was observed specifically in the months of March and April. As previously discussed, an increase in the number of MRSA cases in March may have been a result of the presence of influenza, or other respiratory viruses, in the hospital.",

Further examination of these clusters revealed several events that may be equivalent to MRSA outbreaks or transmission events that were not recognized by hospital personnel. By adopting a comprehensive approach for MRSA surveillance, clusters were identified at the hospital, service, and ward levels. Infection control efforts can be focused at one or more levels to identify risk factors for MRSA acquisition and transmission, establish interventions, and evaluate control measures. The identification of specific time periods that corresponded to significant increases in the rate of MRSA cases in the patient population may have been correlated with other determinants at the hospital level, including the presence of other pathogens. In this investigation, spa typing provided very little information due to the presence of a predominant spa type. Therefore, the use of a different typing technique (e.g., whole-genome sequencing) or additional supplementary information may be warranted to decipher transmission events and clusters. Application of scan statistics for hospital surveillance of MRSA would probably be most rewarding in facilities with access to higher resolution molecular typing data. Future research utilizing the temporal scan statistic, prospectively, with the application of molecular typing, especially whole-genome sequencing, to identify MRSA clusters in real-time and elucidate transmission events in the hospital setting, is warranted.",
