Mutation of the S2 site of QX genotype (QX-type) infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) spike protein (S) in a recombinant virus background results in higher pathogenicity, pronounced neural symptoms and neurotropism when compared with conditions in wild-type IBV (WT-IBV) infected chickens. In this study, we present evidence suggesting that recombinant IBV with a mutant S2 site (furin-S2 site) leads to higher mortality. Infection with mutant IBV induces severe encephalitis and breaks the blood-brain barrier. The results of a neutralization test and immunoprotection experiment show that an original serum and vaccine can still provide effective protection in vivo and in vitro. This is the first demonstration of IBV-induced neural symptoms in chickens with encephalitis and the furin-S2 site as a determinant of neurotropism.",

S protein belongs to the class I fusion proteins, located at the surface of the virion [19] . The trimeric S glycoprotein is a class I fusion protein and mediates attachment to the host receptor. S is typically cleaved by a host cell furin-like protease into two separate polypeptides named S1 and S2. S1 makes up the large receptor-binding domain of the S protein, while S2 forms the stalk of the spike molecule [20] . There is an extra furin cleavage site (furin-S2 site) upstream of the fusion peptide in the S2 subunit of some CoVs, which has been reported to influence the mechanism of invasion of host cells by CoVs. When the original sequence PTKR/S of SARS-CoV was replaced with RRKR/S, SARS-CoV could invade susceptible cells while no longer relying on cathepsin L [21] . Additionally, after the S2 site mutated into the furin-S2 site of the MHV-A59 strain, MHV can fuse with susceptible cells in the early endosome, but not lysosome, without requiring lysosomal enzymes such as MERS-CoV [22] . As for IBV, the furin-S2 site is a determinant of cellular adaptation of the IBV-Beaudette strain. If this motif is lacking, the IBV-Beaudette strain, which is normally the only IBV strain able to adapt to the Vero cell line, can no longer grow in these cells [23] [24] [25] .",

CoVs normally infect epithelial cells such as respiratory epithelial cells, intestinal epithelial cells and kidney epithelial cells, which causes respiratory or intestinal tract diseases with various levels of severity [1, 2] . Human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) is a main cause of the common cold, while severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) cause severe respiratory disease that can be life-threatening to humans [3] [4] [5] . However, some CoVs-like mouse hepatitis virus John Howard Mueller strain (MHV-JHM) infect oligodendrocytes, astrocytes and microglia and cause acute encephalomyelitis [6, 7] . Additionally, human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) can also reach the central nervous system (CNS) by intranasal inoculation in BALB/c mice, which causes encephalitis [8] [9] [10] [11] . The release of cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1, interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) is closely associated with encephalitis [12] . Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) belongs to the gamma-coronavirus group (\u03b3-CoV), which causes a highly contagious, acute viral respiratory disease of chickens that has caused great economic losses in the poultry industry. At present, QX-type IBV is epidemic worldwide; it can damage the respiratory, digestive and urogenital systems of chickens [13] [14] [15] [16] . Besides, because of severe damage of respiratory mucosa, infected chickens are susceptible to secondary infection by mycoplasma, bacteria, or other pathogens causing high mortality.",

Furin-S2' site was introduced into the YN cDNA by homologous recombination using the transient dominant selection system [25] . After screening and transcription in vitro, the full-length RNA of rYN-S2/RRKR was electroporated into BHK cells. After 48 h of incubation at 37 \u2022 C, cells and supernatant were repeatedly subjected to freezing and thawing three times and inoculated into 10-day-old SPF embryonated eggs. Serial passage was executed until the stable appearance of dwarf embryos and the time of death of embryos was recorded. The 50% embryo infectious dose (EID 50 ) was determined by inoculating serial 10-fold dilutions of allantoic fluid into SPF chicken embryos [29] . The TCID 50 was determined by inoculating serial 10-fold dilutions of allantoic fluid into CEK cells cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS in 24-well plates.",

One-day-old SPF chicks inoculated with the rYN strain began to show clinical signs of sneezing and listlessness at 5 days post-inoculation (dpi). One chick died in the rYN-inoculated observation group during the experiment's observation period, conferring a mortality rate of 10%, while chicks in the rYN-S2/RRKR-inoculated group began to show clinical signs of diarrhea and unexpectedly neurological signs such as head tremor and paralysis. Nine out of 10 chicks infected with rYN-S2/RRKR during the observation period; the mortality was 90% (Figure 2A , left panel). The survival results showed that the furin-S2 site clearly increased the lethality of the rYN strain to 1-day-old SPF chickens. Interestingly, furin-S2 site induction caused neurological signs that have never previously been reported. At necropsy of 1-day-old SPF chicks at 5, 7 and 9 dpi, there were obvious lesions in the respiratory and urinary systems of chicks inoculated with the rYN strain, including mucus and punctate hemorrhage in the larynx, substantial urate deposits in the ureter and kidney swelling. Chicks inoculated with rYN-S2/RRKR strain had mucus and punctate hemorrhage in the larynx and no obvious lesions in the kidney (Figure 2A , right panels). Additionally, no gross lesions were observed in the negative control group. Our results demonstrate that rYN-S2/RRKR was highly fatal to 1-day-old SPF chicks compared with its parental strain.",

Additionally, neutrophils contribute to defense through the release of matrix metalloprotease 9 (MMP9), which helps increase the permeability of the BBB, resulting in an increase of specific T cells infiltrating into the CNS [33] . As for another neurotropic coronavirus, HCoV-OC43, astrogliosis and microgliosis are observed when it infects the brain [10] . A similar mutation was also observed in the S protein of HCoV-OC43, of which a furin-like cleavage site appeared at amino acid 758 between the S1 and S2 portions [34, 35] . Conversely, this mutation leads to decreased neurovirulence and limited dissemination within the CNS. Our data from pathogenicity experiments clearly show that IBV with the furin-S2 site can infect neurons and cause encephalitis, which has never previously been reported in IBV. Our results extend previous work on the function of the S protein of coronavirus. Based on this, we used homologous modeling to predict the structure of original and mutant S proteins according to the structure of IBV S protein (PDB accession number: 6CV0) ( Figure 6 ) [36] . We found that the S2 site is located on the surface of the S protein and can be modified by furin. We speculate that modification by furin may affect the fusion of virus with cells, which mildly damages the trachea and kidney; meanwhile, IBV with mutant S protein can infect neurons.",

It remains unclear whether the neurotropism caused by the furin-S2\u2032 site is IBV strain-dependent. Because of the mutability of the coronavirus genome, such as IBV-Beaudettte strain and mutant HCoV-OC43 with a furin-like site in the S protein, it is possible that mutant QX-type IBV would appear naturally and cause great economic losses in the poultry industry because of its high pathogenicity to chickens.

We used homologous modeling to predict the structure of original and mutant S proteins according to the Cryo-EM structure of IBV S protein.In summary, our results demonstrate that the furin cleavage site upstream of the FP in S protein is an important site for CoV, modulating entry, cell-virus fusion, adaptation to its host cell, cell tropism and pathogenicity, but not antigenicity. It remains unclear whether the neurotropism caused by the furin-S2 site is IBV strain-dependent. Because of the mutability of the coronavirus genome, such as IBV-Beaudettte strain and mutant HCoV-OC43 with a furin-like site in the S protein, it is possible that mutant QX-type IBV would appear naturally and cause great economic losses in the poultry industry because of its high pathogenicity to chickens.
