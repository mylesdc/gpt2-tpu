EV71 causes Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease and has been associated with neurological complications in young children. Our limited understanding of the mechanisms involved in its neuropathogenesis has hampered the development of effective therapeutic options. Here, using a two-dimensional proteomics approach combined with mass spectrometry, we have identified a unique panel of host proteins that were differentially and dynamically modulated during EV71 infection of motor-neuron NSC-34 cells, which are found at the neuromuscular junctions where EV71 is believed to enter the central nervous system. Meta-analysis with previously published proteomics studies in neuroblastoma or muscle cell lines revealed minimal overlapping which suggests unique host-pathogen interactions in NSC-34 cells. Among the candidate proteins, we focused our attention on prohibitin (PHB), a protein that is involved in multiple cellular functions and the target of anti-cancer drug Rocaglamide (Roc-A). We demonstrated that cell surfaceexpressed PHB is involved in EV71 entry into neuronal cells specifically, while membranebound mitochondrial PHB associates with the virus replication complex and facilitates viral replication. Furthermore, Roc-A treatment of EV71-infected neuronal cells reduced significantly virus yields. However, the inhibitory effect of Roc-A on PHB in NSC-34 cells was not through blocking the CRAF/MEK/ERK pathway as previously reported. Instead, Roc-A treated NSC-34 cells had lower mitochondria-associated PHB and lower ATP levels that correlated with impaired mitochondria integrity. In vivo, EV71-infected mice treated with Roc-A survived longer than the vehicle-treated animals and had significantly lower virus loads in their spinal cord and brain, whereas virus titers in their limb muscles were comparable to controls. Together, this study uncovers PHB as the first host factor that is specifically involved in EV71 neuropathogenesis and a potential drug target to limit neurological complications.",

Being a close relative of poliovirus, EV71 is deemed as an important neurotropic virus worldwide [1] . Since its first isolation in California in 1969, several major outbreaks have been reported in China, Singapore, Korea, and Japan [2] [3] [4] [5] . Although the clinical manifestations are generally mild and self-limiting, including HFMD and herpangina, severe neurological complications have been consistently reported with EV71-associated infections, causing brainstem encephalitis, acute flaccid paralysis, pulmonary edema and cardiopulmonary failure [6, 7] . In addition, some patients who have recovered from severe disease have been reported to develop long term neurologic and psychiatric disorders [8] . There are currently no effective prophylactic or therapeutic agents against EV71. Although several vaccines have completed Phase III clinical trials [9] , regulatory issues may limit their widespread utilization. In addition, as these vaccine candidates consist of inactivated virus from a single EV71 genotype (C4), cross-protection against other genotypes may be limited [10, 11] .",

            "text": "The increasing awareness of life-threatening EV71 infections has boosted research in recent years to further understand virus-host interactions and develop effective antiviral strategies [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . However, the neuropathogenesis of EV71 is still poorly understood. Infection occurs when the virus enters the body upon ingestion and/or inhalation. The virus multiplies initially in the alimentary tract mucosa and rapidly reaches the deep cervical and mesenteric lymph nodes via the tonsils and Peyer's patches [18] . After a short transient systemic dissemination phase, the virus accumulates and actively replicates in muscles where it is believed to infect motor neurons at the neuromuscular junctions. Experimental evidence supports that EV71 migrates to the brainstem via retrograde axonal transport as previously described for its close relative poliovirus [1, 2, [19] [20] [21] . However, the molecular mechanisms involved in EV71 infection of motor neurons to access the central nervous system (CNS) have not been studied. Indeed in vitro studies aiming at studying EV71 neurovirulence have employed neuroblastoma cell lines that may not reflect accurately infection in motor neurons. To address this gap, we have recently reported a novel in vitro model of EV71 infection in the murine motor neuron cell line NSC-34 [22] . NSC-34 cells originate from the fusion between murine neuroblastoma and spinal cord cells, and possess motor neuron-like properties, such as generation of action potentials and production of acetylcholine [23] , therefore making it a relevant model to study the mechanism of EV71 neuropathogenesis. We demonstrated that NSC-34 cells are permissive to EV71 clinical isolates and found that, unlike any other mammalian cell types so far reported, EV71-infected NSC-34 cells do not undergo apoptosis and lysis. Instead we showed that the virus exits the cells via a non-lytic mode, a phenomenon that has also been previously described for poliovirus [21, 24, 25] . These unique features thus suggested that the infection cycle of EV71 in NSC-34 cells involves host pathways and partners that are likely to be different from those previously identified in other mammalian cell types such as muscle cells and neuroblastoma cells.",

In addition, they were found to be involved in various biological processes including mitochondrial biogenesis, proteolytic activity, cytoskeletal machinery and RNA processing (S1a Fig) , consistent with the protein clusters observed in the STRING network (Fig 2) . Finally, molecular function analysis indicates that majority of these proteins contribute to nucleic acid binding transcription factor activity (34.7%), structural molecule activity (25%) or binding (22.2%) (S1a Fig). A meta-analysis with other selected proteomic studies of EV71-infected muscle and neuronal cells [13] [14] [15] 17, [27] [28] [29] revealed minimal overlap between NSC-34, RD and other neuronal cell types with 4 protein candidates only, namely ACTB, TUBB, PDIA3 and ENO1, suggesting that the host-pathogen interactions in NSC-34 cells are unique (S1b Fig). The limited overlap may also be partly explained by differential proteomics approaches. ACT and TUBB are involved in maintaining cytoskeletal structure, and they are found highly modulated during viral infection to facilitate virus internalization and transportation [30] [31] [32] . ENO1 has been shown previously to interact with cytoskeletal proteins in intermediate filaments framework rearrangement [33] . On the other hand, PDI functions in catalyzing reduction and oxidation processes and protein folding [34] . It has also been demonstrated to be involved in humoral immune response [35] or viral replication (DENV) [36] and entry (HIV) [37] . Not surprisingly, greater overlap was seen between motor-neuron NSC-34 and other neuronal cells (26 shared hits) than between NSC-34 and RD cells (5 shared hits). Importantly, neuro-specific proteins such as PRPH and UCHL1 were only identified from profiling studies in NSC-34 and other neuronal cells, thus validating our 2DE proteomic approach.",

Prohibitin (PHB; BAP-32) and prohibitin 2 (PHB2, REA, BAP-37) are two highly homologous members of this family and are ubiquitously expressed in multiple cellular compartments including the mitochondria, nucleus, and the plasma membrane. Prohibitins have been involved in multiple cellular functions including cell proliferation and maintenance of the functional integrity of the mitochondria [50] . In addition, PHB specifically has been previously reported to be involved in the entry step of alphavirus chikungunya (CHIKV) [40] , and flaviviruses Dengue (DENV) [38] and Hepatitis C (HCV) [39] , and to interact with envelope proteins from white spot syndrome virus to prevent infection [51] . However, there has been no report so far on the role of PHB during EV71 infection. First, modulation of PHB expression during EV71 infection in NSC-34 cells was confirmed by western blot and showed an overall up-regulation of PHB during the course of infection compared to uninfected control (S2 Fig). Next, the impact of PHB gene silencing on virus production was further analyzed using a wider range of siRNA pool concentrations including 5, 10, 25 and 50 nM. Efficacy of the gene silencing was assessed by Western blot and showed a dose-dependent decrease of PHB expression in NSC-34 cell lysates (Fig 3c) . This dose-dependent PHB knockdown correlated well with a dose-dependent reduction in the viral titers measured in the culture supernatant (Fig 3d) , therefore supporting the role for PHB in EV71 infection cycle. To address the possibility of false positive or off-target effects of the siRNA pool, PHB gene silencing was performed with the individual siRNAs species from the pool. Western blot showed that each individual siRNA was capable of silencing PHB expression significantly (S3a 10 . The viral titers in the culture supernatants were determined by plaque assay at 48 h.p.i.. Cell viability of the transfected cells was assessed using alamarBlue assay. Statistical analysis was performed using two-tailed student's t-test ( \u00c3\u00c3 p<0.005, \u00c3\u00c3\u00c3 p<0.005). Relative band quantification (below Western blot) was determined by ImageJ, by normalizing to loading control, \u03b2-actin. Error bars represent mean \u00b1 standard deviation. One representative of two biological repeats is shown. ",

Incubation of NSC-34 cells with anti-PHB antibody prior to infection led to significant reduction of the viral titer in a dosedependent manner (Fig 4a) . To demonstrate a physical interaction between cell surfaceexpressed PHB and EV71, a proximity ligation assay (PLA) was performed. In this assay, PHB and EV71 are recognized by specific primary antibodies raised in two different species, which are in turn recognized by species-specific secondary antibodies conjugated to a probe and a target, respectively. Should EV71 and PHB be in close proximity, the probe and the target ligate, amplify and result in emission of a fluorescent signal. SCARB-2 which has been previously demonstrated as the main receptor for EV71 in RD cells [52] was used as positive control and a red fluorescent signal was readily detected in EV71-infected RD cells (Fig 4b) . A positive signal was also detected with NSC-34 cells incubated with anti-PHB and anti-EV71 antibodies thus supporting the close proximity between EV71 virus particles and surfaceexpressed PHB (Fig 4b) . In contrast, and expectedly, no signal was detected with mouse SCARB-2 (mSCARB2) and EV71 antibodies (Fig 4b) , since we have shown previously that entry of EV71 into NSC-34 cells is not mediated by mSCARB-2 [22] .",

The total cell lysate was obtained and a pulldown was carried out using antibody specific to PHB or an isotype IgG antibody control. The immunoprecipitates were then analyzed by Western blot using anti-EV71 primary antibody. A discrete band at the expected size was obtained when pulldown was performed with the anti-PHB antibody whereas no band was seen when pulldown was done with the IgG isotype (Fig 4c) .

We have demonstrated that intracellular PHB co-localizes with dsRNA and is closely associated with the EV71 3D polymerase. Given that intracellular PHB is abundantly and mainly expressed on mitochondria [54] , we speculated that in NSC-34 cells mitochondria may be exploited by EV71 as replication site. Consistently, co-localization of PHB and EV71 with mitochondria was observed by IFA (Fig  7a and 7b) . Furthermore, co-localization of PHB, dsRNA and mitochondria was also readily detected, thus indicating that mitochondrial PHB is associated with the viral replication (Fig 7c) . To exclude the possibility that the replication complexes detected were actually associated to the ER, which is in close proximity to mitochondria, the mitochondrial fraction was prepared from EV71-infected NSC-34 cells and Western blot analysis revealed the presence of viral capsid protein VP1 (38 kD), 3D (53 kD) and 3CD (72 kD) proteins (Fig 7d) . Furthermore, the mitochondrial fraction was shown to be free of cytoplasmic contamination, as evidenced by the presence of mitochondrial marker (ATPB, 52 kD) and lack of ER marker (Calreticulin, 48 kD). Similar observation was made with the mitochondrial fraction prepared from EV71-infected RD cells (Fig 7d) , suggesting that EV71 is able to exploit various cellular organelles as replication scaffolds in various mammalian cell types from different species. This finding is consistent with a previous study where EV71 VP1 was found to be associated with mitochondria in Hela cells [55] . To further support the close proximity and likely interactions between the viral replication complexes and mitochondria, transmission electron microscopy was performed on EV71-infected NSC-34 cells. Clustering of mitochondria surrounding viral replication complexes could be seen (electron-dense like structures) in the infected cells, and examination at a higher magnification indicated a close association between mitochondria membrane and virus complex/virus particle (Fig 7e) .",

We therefore investigated whether Roc-A could interfere with EV71 infection cycle by blocking PHB activity in NSC-34 cells. Incubation of Roc-A with virus prior to NSC-34 cell infection (co-treatment) did not result in any significant reduction in viral titer (S4a Fig) . When cells were pre-treated with Roc-A prior to EV71 infection (pre-treatment), less than 1 log PFU/mL of decrease in viral titer was observed at the highest drug concentration only (500 nM) (S4b Fig). In contrast, a dose-dependent decrease in the viral titer was seen when Roc-A treatment was applied after infection (post-treatment) at concentrations ranging between 10-100 nM (Fig 8a) . Western blot analysis of the cell lysates further confirmed the dose-dependent reduction of intracellular viral capsid protein and PHB (Fig 8b) . Taken together, the data suggest that the antiviral effect of Roc-A on EV71-infected NSC-34 cells targets the viral replication step and not the entry step, in contrast to a previous study with HCV [39] .",

To investigate whether the CRAF/MEK/ERK To decipher the mode of action of Roc-A in NSC-34 cells, immunostaining of Roc-A treated NSC-34 cells was performed. Decreased signals for PHB and mitochondria were observed with increasing concentrations of Roc-A (Fig 8c) , suggesting that Roc-A might affect mitochondrial integrity. We thus assessed the mitotoxicity and cytotoxicity of Roc-A using the Mitochondrial ToxGlo assay (Promega). While cytotoxicity remained generally minimal over the range of Roc-A concentrations tested, the intracellular ATP levels were significantly reduced in a dose-dependent manner, thus indicating functional impairment of the mitochondria in Roc-A-treated NSC-34 cells (Fig 8d) . Consistently, using the membrane-permeant JC-1 dye as an indicator of mitochondrial membrane potential, Roc-A-treated NSC-34 cells displayed marked and dose-dependent mitochondrial depolarization as evidenced by the decrease of red fluorescent J-aggregates, compared to untreated cells (S6 Fig). Together, these observations suggest that Roc-A treatment in NSC-34 cells results in reduced levels of PHB, leading to mitochondrial destabilization and lower ATP production. One could thus speculate that the lack of intact mitochondria and reduced intracellular ATP levels might eventually impact negatively on EV71 replication efficacy.",

We first showed by flow cytometry comparable levels of surface expression of PHB on RD, SK-N-SH and NSC-34 cells (S7 Fig). However, both PHB gene silencing and PHB receptor blocking experiments performed in human muscle RD cells did not impact the viral titer (S8a and S8b Fig) . On the contrary, PHB silencing in the human neuroblastoma cells SK-N-SH led to a significant dosedependent reduction in viral titer in the culture supernatant (Fig 9a) . In addition, reduced virus titers were observed with SK-N-SH cells pre-treated with anti-PHB antibodies, thus supporting that cell surface-expressed PHB is involved in EV71 entry into this human neuroblastoma cell line (Fig 9b) . To investigate if intracellular PHB is also involved in viral replication in SK-N-SH cells, transfection of lucEV71 replicon into PHB-silenced SK-N-SH cells was performed. Results showed a significant reduction in the luminescence signal compared to controls (Fig 9c) . Finally, the effectiveness of Roc-A treatment in EV71-infected SK-N-SH cells was also assessed.

The development of clinical manifestations was clearly delayed in the Roc-A-treated mouse group which resulted in increased survival time compared to the untreated or vehicle-treated control groups (Fig 10b) . In addition, the viral loads in limb muscles, spinal cord and brain in both Roc-A-treated and vehicle-treated mice were determined. Comparable viral loads were detected in the limb muscles from both groups (Fig 10c) . In contrast, viral titers in the spinal cord and brain from the Roc-A-treated animals were significantly lower compared to the vehicle-treated group (Fig 10c) , thus supporting that Roc-A treatment specifically impairs EV71 neuropathogenesis.

The host protein candidates are mainly involved in cytoskeletal structure maintenance, RNA processing and mitochondrial biogenesis. By employing a siRNA gene silencing approach, we have shown that some of these host factors either facilitate or limit EV71 productive infection. Among these host factors, PHB was found to exert a pro-viral effect as evidenced by the reduced viral titers measured in the culture supernatant of NSC-34 cells when the expression of PHB was down-regulated, and by an increased viral titer in PHB over-expressing cells. PHB is mainly localized on plasma membrane, mitochondria and nucleus, and has been involved in multiple signaling pathways regulated by growth factors, immune response, mitochondrial biogenesis, cell migration, proliferation and survival [50, 58] . Interestingly, knockdown in NSC-34 cells of STOML2, which was shown to interact with PHB and participate to mitochondria biogenesis [60] , resulted in significant reduction of viral titer, similar to that seen with PHB-knocked down cells. This further supports the involvement of mitochondrial proteins during EV71 infection cycle in NSC-34 cells.",

These data thus led us to propose that mitochondria could serve as replication site for EV71 in NSC-34 cells.

Similar to other flavaglines, Rocaglamide (Roc-A) is a natural product that displays insecticidal, anti-fungal, anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer activities [63] . Mechanistically, Roc-A was found to inhibit CRAF-PHB interactions in tumor cells [64] [65] [66] , and in an in vitro model of HCV infection [39] . In EV71-infected NSC-34 cells, incubation with nM concentrations of Roc-A resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in virus titers. However, the mechanism by which Roc-A exerts its antiviral effect against EV71 in NSC-34 cells does not seem to be mediated by blocking the CRAF/MEK/ERK pathway, given that phosphorylated ERK proteins could not be detected in uninfected NSC-34 cells, suggesting that this pathway is not functional in these cells. Instead, we found that Roc-A-treated cells displayed reduced expression of mitochondrial PHB and lower levels of intracellular ATP, which suggests that mitochondria integrity/functionality is impaired in Roc-A treated NSC-34 cells. Since we showed that mitochondrial PHB is involved in EV71 replication and that mitochondria serve as replication site for this virus, the impact of Roc-A on PHB expression and mitochondria integrity could represent the basis of its antiviral activity. Further investigation is necessary to decipher the molecular mechanisms by which Roc-A affects the expression of mitochondrial PHB.",

The cell typedependent involvement of PHB during EV71 infection likely reflects differential intracellular events with different host factors being engaged during EV71 intracellular life cycle.
