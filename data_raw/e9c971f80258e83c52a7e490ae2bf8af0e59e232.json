The CT-RT-LAMP assay detected YMV in leaf and tuber tissues of infected plants. The assay is 100 times more sensitive in detecting YMV than standard RT-PCR, while maintaining the same specificity.",

Yam mosaic virus (YMV, genus Potyvirus, family Potyviridae) causes \"mosaic disease\", the most economically important viral disease of yams, which can reduce yields by up to 40% [6, 17] . YMV is endemic in the West African \"yam belt\" stretching from western Cameroon to C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, which is known to be the largest edible-yam production region in the world [2] . YMV is most frequently detected in D. rotundata, the dominant yam species cultivated in the yam belt [2, 4, 6] . Since yams are clonally propagated using whole tubers, portions of the tubers (setts), or vine cuttings, the virus perpetuates from season to season and spreads to new areas along with the infected planting material [6] .",

The development of sensitive, low-cost, field-based diagnostic tools is an important requirement to achieve this goal. Two common methods employed in the detection of yam viruses include enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), with the latter being the most widely used for YMV diagnosis [10, 13] . However, both ELISA and RT-PCR are lab based and require sophisticated equipment, precluding adoption of diagnostics in poorly equipped laboratories. Isothermal amplification methods, such as recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) [13] and reverse transcription (RT) loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) [10] , are relatively simple and rapid to perform, with high specificity and sensitivity, and are suitable for poorly equipped laboratories and on-site diagnosis [1, 9] .",

The six RT-LAMP primers designed recognize eight binding sites in the YMV CP region. This includes two outer primers, YMV-F3 and YMV-B3, in the sense and antisense orientation, respectively; two internal primers, YMV-FIP and YMV-BIP, each containing two separate binding sites, referred to as F2 and F1C and B2 and B2C, in opposite orientations; and two loop primers, YMV-LF and YMV-LB (Table 1 , Supplementary Fig. 1) . To test the fragment length of the CP sequence targeted for LAMP detection, conventional RT-PCR assay was performed with the outer primer pair YMV-F3 and YMV-B3, keeping the RT-PCR reaction conditions similar to those used for YMV-F and YMV-R. This resulted in amplification of the expected 211-bp product (data not shown). The 211-bp RT-PCR product was sequenced in both orientations, and comparison of the resultingsequence (Gen-Bank accession no. MF521884) by BLAST search revealed 97 to 100% sequence identity with YMV sequences available in the GenBank database, confirming the specificity of the primers for the virus genome. The six RT-LAMP primers designed in this study successfully detected YMV using a single incubation temperature of 65 \u00b0C for 60 min. Ladderlike patterns of amplified products in YMV-positive samples were detected in agarose gels (Fig. 1A) . The specificity of the loop primers (YMV-LF and YMV-LB) in the RT-LAMP assay was evaluated by comparing assays with and without the addition of these primers to the reaction mixture ( Tenfold dilutions of total RNA from 100 ng/\u00b5l were tested. RT-PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, and visual detection of RT-LAMP was done using SYBR Green dye.

Use of loop primers at concentrations above 0.5 \u00b5M resulted in false-negative results, as some YMV-positive samples were not detected (Supplementary Fig. 2) . The optimal primer conditions for the RT-LAMP were determined by testing different concentrations, and a ratio of inner to outer to loop primers of 7.5:1:3.125 was found to be optimal. The inclusion of loop primers, primer concentration, and relative ratio to each other had a crucial influence on the specificity and consistent amplification of the target region in YMVpositive samples.",

Assays conducted using samples soaked in alkaline PEG reagent resulted in successful detection of YMV up to 10 \u22123 (v/v) dilution in both leaf (TDr 09/0082) and tuber (TDr Makakusa) samples (Fig. 2) . Experiments to detect YMV in total RNA extracts of bulk samples (1:10 infected to healthy leaf sample ratio) resulted in virus detection up to a dilution of 10 \u22124 in CT-RT-LAMP and up to a dilution of 10 \u22123 in RT-PCR in two yam varieties tested (TDr Danacha and TDr 09/00058) ( Supplementary  Fig. 3A) . However, YMV detection at a dilution of 10 \u22121 consistently gave negative results in RT-PCR (lane 1, Supplementary Fig. 3A ), but amplification was observed in CT-RT-LAMP (tube 1, Supplementary Fig. 3C) . We suspect that a high template concentration may have an inhibitory effect on RT-PCR but not on RT-LAMP. Similar experiments to detect YMV in bulk samples using a sample soaked in alkaline PEG reagent as template in RT-PCR resulted in consistent detection of YMV at a 10 \u22122 (v/v) dilution of total RNA ( Supplementary Fig. 3B ), but in CT-RT-LAMP, detection was achieved in samples diluted up to 10 \u22124 to 10 \u22126 (Supplementary Fig. 3D ) in two yam varieties tested (TDr Danacha and TDr 09/00058). These experiments confirmed that CT-RT-LAMP offers relatively high sensitivity for YMV detection, and the results were consistent with those obtained by RT-PCR using either total RNA or sample soaked in alkaline PEG reagent.
