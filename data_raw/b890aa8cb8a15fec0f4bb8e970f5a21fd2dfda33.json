Amplification products were detected by visual inspection, agarose gel electrophoresis and by real-time monitoring of turbidity resulted by formation of LAMP amplicons. Digestion with HphI restriction enzyme demonstrated that the amplified product was unique. The specificity of the assay was verified by the absence of amplification products when tested against related bacteria. The assay had 10-fold higher sensitivity compared with conventional PCR and successfully detected Y. ruckeri not only in pure bacterial culture but also in tissue homogenates of infected fish.",

ERM outbreaks usually begin with low mortality, and then escalate to result in high losses. Characteristic symptoms of ERM are haemorrhages of the mouth and gills, though these are rarely seen in acute infections but may be present in chronic infections, diffuse haemorrhages within the swim bladder, petechial haemorrhage of the pyloric caecae, bilateral exophthalmia, abdominal distension as a result of fluid accumulation, general septicaemia with inflammation of the gut, the spleen is often enlarged and can be almost black in colour [4] . Transmission occurs by direct contact with carrier fish, other aquatic invertebrates and birds [4, 11] . The ability of Y. ruckeri to survive and remain infective in the aquatic environment is considered to be a major factor in spread of the disease. Furthermore, Y. ruckeri is able to form biofilms and grow on surfaces and solid supports in fish tanks, like many bacteria in aquatic environments, which lead to recurrent infections in rainbow trout farms [12] . Although vaccination has for a decade been very successful in the control of infections caused by Y. ruckeri in trout farms [13] , cases of yersiniosis have been reported in trout farms where vaccination didn't provide enough protection against the infection [14] and due to carrier state [13] . Different diagnostic methods have been developed for detection of Y. ruckeri including culturing, serological and molecular techniques. Isolation and identification using agar media and the organism's biochemical characteristics are considered the gold standard for Y. ruckeri diagnosis. Serological methods for detection of Y. ruckeri have also been developed and these include ELISA, agglutination, and the immunofluorescence antibody technique (IFAT) [15] . Molecular techniques are able to detect low levels of the bacterium and facilitate detection of asymptomatic carriers, which is very important for prevention of ERM transmission and spread [16] . Restriction fragmentation-length polymorphism [17] and PCR assays [18] [19] [20] are widely used for detection of low levels of Y. ruckeri in infected trout tissues and blood and also for detection of asymptomatic carriers. Although PCR has been shown to be a powerful and sensitive tool in detection of Y. ruckeri, its requirements for expensive equip-ments, a precision thermocycler and laboratory training limit its use in the field as a routine diagnostic tool.",

These include nucleic acid-based amplification (NASBA), loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and ramification amplification [21] [22] [23] . LAMP is a nucleic acid amplification method that synthesises large amounts of DNA in a short period of time with high specificity [22, 24] . The strand displacement activity of Bst DNA polymerase impels auto-cyclic DNA synthesis with loop-forming primers to yield long-stem loop products under isothermal conditions: 60-65\u00b0C for about 60 min [22, 25] . The LAMP reaction requires four or six primers that target six or eight separate DNA sequences on the target and give the assay very high specificity [22, 25] . LAMP amplification products can be detected by gel electrophoresis, by real time monitoring of turbidity with a turbidimeter [24, 26] or with the naked-eye. Visual detection can be accomplished using different methods such as detection of a white precipitate (magnesium pyrophosphate), use of an intercalating DNA dye such as SYBR Green I gel stain [27] , use of florescent detection reagent, FDR, [28] , or use of oligonucleotide probes labelled with different fluorescent dyes and low molecular weight cationic polymers such as polyethylenimine, PEI [29] .",

For field diagnosis, the optimal detection system should be economical, quick, and easy to operate, moreover should meet the requirements of specificity and sensitivity [38] . ERM disease is a serious infection that causes sever economic losses in salmonid aquaculture. It usually occurs as an acute condition with high morbidity and mortality rates, which necessitates rapid and accurate methods for detection of its causative agent, Y. ruckeri [18] . A traditional microbiological approach for isolation and identification usually takes 2 to 3 days, and given that different numerical profiles for Y. ruckeri can be obtained with commercial multi-substrate identification systems, particularly the API 20E system, they must be interpreted with caution [3] . Although PCR assays are more accurate, specific, and faster than the microbiological approach [18] [19] [20] , they require precision equipments which are beyond the capacity of most diagnostic sites to purchase, maintain and operate, and the complexity of the assay procedures obviates the possibility of point-of-care use.",

The ERM-LAMP assay requires only a simple water bath or heating block to incubate the reaction mixture at 63\u00b0C for 1 hr before the reaction products are visualised. The assay utilizes a single DNA polymerase that is active at relatively high isothermal amplification temperatures, which diminishes the probability of non-specific priming [39] . The yruI/yruR quorum sensing system encoding gene of Y. ruckeri was chosen as a suitable target, as it controls virulence gene expression through cell to cell communication and has great potential for rapid and specific identification of this fish pathogen [20] . Although there is a serotypic diversity among Y. ruckeri strains [40, 41] , yruI/ yruR gene was amplified from all Y. ruckeri tested strains by PCR and produced one RFLP pattern which demonstrate a high degree of genotypic homogeneity among Y. ruckeri strains regarding this gene [20] .",

            "text": "A LAMP assay requires at least 4 highly specific primers to distinguish six distinct regions on the target DNA [42] . In developing the ERM-LAMP assay, several primer sets were appraised, with the most effective set presented here. The assay was optimized to amplify Y. ruckeri at 63\u00b0C using a set of 4 or 5 primers. In initial trials of the assay, a characteristic ladder-like pattern of LAMP amplification is demonstrated upon gel electrophoresis [43] and confirmed the identity of the product by HphI digestion. The ERM-LAMP assay was able to amplify the target yruI/yruR gene from all Y. ruckeri tested strains while it did not show any cross-reactivity with a panel of DNAs from other Yersinia species or from other related bacterial species, which confirm its specificity. Due to the isothermal nature of the LAMP assay, there is no time lost in temperature cycling, which leads to extremely high efficiency compared with regular PCR [22, 44] . Another advantage of LAMP is that real-time monitoring of the reaction is possible [24] and this decreases the time needed to get results and reduces the risk of carry-over contamination in the post-PCR process [45] . Alternatively, LAMP reaction products can be visualized using SYBR Green I nucleic gel stain which has high binding affinity to double stranded DNA and hence turns from orange to green as the LAMP amplicons are produced [46, 47] . LAMP product can also be monitored by placing a reaction tube directly on a UV transilluminator; when the FDR added into the reaction mixture. The calcein in FDR is initially combined with manganese ions and is quenched, but as amplification generates by-product pyrophosphate ions, these bind to and remove manganese from the calcein, resulting in fluorescence which is intensified further as calcein combines with magnesium ions [28, 45] . On the other hand, if low molecular weight PEI is used, this forms an insoluble complex with high molecular weight DNAs, like LAMP products, which then captures the hybridized Rox-labelled probe into a pellet which fluoresces red under UV light [29] . All of our data confirmed that visual detection of assay results was compatible with the real-time turbidity measurement and aga-rose gel electrophoresis. Hence simple visual detection facilitates use of the assay in basic laboratories and in fish farms.",
