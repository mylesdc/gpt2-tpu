The frequency of viral respiratory infections (VRIs) in asthma attack patients is now recognized as having a major impact on asthma pathogenesis in children. [1] Kusel et al [2] reported that VRIs caused by human rhinovirus (HRV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in the first year of life were strongly associated with the diagnosis of current asthma and persistent wheeze in 5-year-old children. Furthermore, Jackson et al [3] demonstrated that children had an increased risk of asthma at 6 years of age if they experience wheezing in the first 3 years of life, with RSV [odds ratio (OR): 2.6], HRV (OR: 9.8), or both HRV and RSV (OR: 10). Regarding adult asthma patients, previous reports showed that respiratory tract infections associated with asthma exacerbation ranged from 10% to 21% to 45%, [4] [5] [6] of which 60% are HRV. [7] However, especially in Japan, few epidemiological data exist on the correlation between VRIs and asthma attacks in adult patients [1, 8] from studies conducted within the year. [9] Moreover, Martin et al [10] and Kraft et al [11] described the correlation between Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection and asthma attacks in adult patients; however, the preliminary findings could not confirm the evidence of M. pneumoniae infection in those patients. [8, 12] Therefore, we prospectively studied adult patients with asthma attacks to clarify the role of VRIs and/or bacterial infection, including M. pneumonia, and their molecular epidemiology.",

Clinical data were also obtained at the same time. Respiratory samples for PCR-based detection of respiratory viruses, M. pneumoniae, and Chlamydophila pneumoniae were collected separately from those intended for bacterial cultures and were stored at -80\u00b0C until use. Gram stain was performed on a purulent portion of each sputum specimen and examined by trained personnel. Sputum samples were considered as good quality for evaluation if they were classified as Geckler 4 or 5. Positive bacterial culture was based on acceptable sputum samples with predominant species and compatible results from Gram staining. Samples were centrifuged at 3000 g at 41\u00b0C for 30 minutes. Viral RNA and DNA were extracted from supernatants using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Reverse transcription was performed using PrimeScript RT reagent Kit (Takara Bio, Otsu, Japan), according to the manufacturer's instructions. We used reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction [(RT)-PCR] to try to detect both DNA and RNA viruses, including human metapneumovirus (hMPV), human rhinovirus (HRV), enterovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza viruses A, B, and C (Inf-A, B, and C), human parainfluenza viruses, human coronavirus, adenovirus, cytomegalovirus, human parvovirus B19, varicella zoster virus, and human bocavirus together with M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae as previously described. [13, 14] We used specific primer sets for the amplifications of these viruses as we also previously described. [13, 14] PCR products were purified using MonoFas DNA Purification Kit I (GL Sciences Inc., Shinjuku, Tokyo, Japan). The purified products were sequenced with a BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using the above primers. Sequence analysis was performed on an ABI 3130 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). The nucleotide sequences thus obtained were given GenBank accession numbers from LC020476 to LC020488. 2.7. The species of the viruses were estimated using the basic local alignment search tool (BLAST). [14] Evolutionary distances were estimated using the Kimura 2-parameter method and phylogenetic trees were constructed using the neighbor-joining (NJ) method. Reliability of the trees was estimated using 1,000 bootstrap replications. We calculated pairwise distances (p-distance) of the respiratory viruses detected in this study, hMPV, RSV, Inf-V, and HRV, using MEGA software, version 5.0. Calculations were based on the nucleotide sequences of each virus.",

However, the epidemiological data of HRV associated asthma attacks in adults were scarcely reported in Japan. In this regard, the present study showed that HRV-A or HRV-C has a potential role in asthma attacks among Japanese adult patients, with a wide genetic divergence. As shown in Fig. 1 , the detection of HRV was most common in autumn, indicating that the common cold, which results from HRV during the fall months, can lead to asthma attacks as reported in previous studies. [19] Furthermore, previous reports described other respiratory viruses, such as hMPV, [20] RSV, parainfluenza virus, Inf-V, and coronavirus, as a cause of asthma attack in adults, [4] and the present study clearly demonstrated the main causative viruses are HRV, hMPV, RSV, and Inf-V. What is more important is the finding in our study that the various VRIs can cause asthma attacks with a seasonal predilection in each virus; however, the frequency of VRIs in asthma attack patients seem to be equal throughout the seasons.",
