The nature and severity of disease can vary between clinical cases. Genetic determinants of virulence are likely to contribute to differences in the in vivo phenotype of FHV-1 isolates, but to date there have been limited studies investigating FHV-1 genetic diversity. This study used next generation sequencing to compare the genomes of contemporary Australian clinical isolates of FHV-1, vaccine isolates and historical clinical isolates, including isolates that predated the introduction of live attenuated vaccines into Australia. Analysis of the genome sequences aimed to assess the level of genetic diversity, identify potential genetic markers that could influence the in vivo phenotype of the isolates and examine the sequences for evidence of recombination. Results: The full genome sequences of 26 isolates of FHV-1 were determined, including two vaccine isolates and 24 clinical isolates that were collected over a period of approximately 40 years. Analysis of the genome sequences revealed a remarkably low level of diversity (0.0-0.01 %) between the isolates. No potential genetic determinants of virulence were identified, but unique single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the UL28 and UL44 genes were detected in the vaccine isolates that were not present in the clinical isolates. No evidence of FHV-1 recombination was detected using multiple methods of recombination detection, even though many of the isolates originated from cats housed in a shelter environment where high infective pressures were likely to exist. Evidence of displacement of dominant FHV-1 isolates with other (genetically distinct) FHV-1 isolates over time was observed amongst the isolates obtained from the shelter-housed animals.",

The lack of recombination detected in the FHV-1 genomes suggests that the risk of attenuated vaccines recombining to generate virulent field viruses is lower than has been suggested for some other herpesviruses.

            "text": "Felid herpesvirus 1 (FHV-1), an alphaherpesvirus, causes upper respiratory tract disease in cats that is characterised by pyrexia, severe nasal and ocular discharge, conjunctivitis and oral ulceration. It is a common cause of necrotising upper respiratory tract infections (URI) in cats housed in shelters, with more than 50 % of cats shedding virus only one week after admission [1] . The virus typically replicates in epithelial cells of the conjunctiva and the upper respiratory tract and infects local neurons, establishing latency in the trigeminal, pterygopalatine and cranial cervical ganglia [2] . Although virus replication is generally limited to the upper respiratory tract and conjunctiva, viraemia has been detected during the acute phase of infection [3, 4] and a recent report has described a case of non-suppurative meningoencephalitis in cats, suggesting that FHV-1 has potential to cause more invasive disease [5] . Vaccination has been used to help control disease caused by FHV-1 since the mid-1970s. Both attenuated and inactivated vaccines are in use currently, and while they can reduce the severity of disease, they do not prevent infection [6] [7] [8] [9] .",

The genome sequence of the prototype C-27 FHV-1 strain (GenBank:NC_013590), a historical isolate from North America, was also included in the analysis [13] . The genomes of the Feligen vaccine isolate of FHV-1 assembled by two different methods (de novo assembly and map to reference assembly) were identical, with the exception of the regions containing short sequence repeats. This provided a high level of confidence in genome assembly by mapping to a reference sequence and this method was used for all other FHV-1 isolates in this study. Genome sequence data have been deposited into GenBank under the accession numbers as listed in Table 1 [GenBank:KR296657 and GenBank:KR381779 -KR381803]. The size of the FHV-1 full genomes ranged from 133.5 kbp (isolate 3227-05) to 135.1 kbp (isolate 3225-05). Genome length variation occurred primarily as a result of differences in the large sequence repeat regions (IRS/TRS) and in the unique short region as a result of tandem repeat iterations.",

The most genetically diverse isolates (135/68 from 3225/05 and 3230/05), differed genome-wide by only 83 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), while some isolates shared 100 % nucleotide identity (excluding large regions of tandem repeat reiterations).

The two vaccines were identical (excluding large reiterative repeat regions) and so are both likely to have been derived from the widely used F2 strain. The C-27 strain, a field strain isolated contemporaneously with the F2 vaccine strain from the USA, varied from the F2-derived vaccine strains by only 5 SNPs genome-wide (excluding large reiterative repeat regions) [14, 15] .

However, no evidence of recombination was detected between the 27 FHV-1 isolates, irrespective of genomic region analysed or the program used (P > 0.05). It is possible that recombination events may not have been detected because of the low levels of diversity among the viruses in our study. It is also possible that previous in vitro studies may have overestimated the likelihood of FHV-1 recombination because of the use of high multiplicities of infection and simultaneous infection, as both these factors have been shown in previous studies to increase the rate of recombination in vitro in other herpesviruses [21] . Recombination would be predicted in circumstances where the opportunity for co-infection is high and where the recombinant progeny have a survival advantage over the parent viruses and dominant field strains. While infective pressure in a shelter environment would be expected to allow concurrent infections with different FHV-1 isolates, there may be insufficient selective pressure on recombinants for them to emerge and persist in vivo in a natural (shelter) environment, particularly as the low levels of diversity among FHV-1 viruses may result in insufficient selective distinction for specific viruses to emerge in a population. a Alignment of the complete genome sequences of FHV-1 isolates performed using MAFFT.

Previous studies of ILTV in poultry have demonstrated that attenuated vaccine strains can participate in natural recombination events that lead to the generation of more virulent progeny [22] . The risk of recombination involving other attenuated veterinary herpesvirus vaccines has not been evaluated comprehensively, but the risk appears to higher in some viruses (such as EHV-4) and lower in others (such as EHV-1) [16] . The results from this study suggest that the risk for FHV-1 vaccine recombination may also be low. Although the FHV-1 genome sequencing data from this study confirms the findings of earlier studies that FHV-1 s are relatively homogeneous [11] this study did detect SNPs unique to F2-derived vaccine strains, in genes UL28 and UL44. A search of all FHV-1 sequences available on GenBank identified only nine sequences covering these regions of the FHV-1 genomes, all relating to the UL44 gene. None of the sequences contained the vaccine-specific SNP, however the sequences were mostly of unknown origin apart from two; a BAC of the C-27 strain [GenBank:GM036023] and strain C7301 [GenBank:D86616]. There is the potential to use the F2derived vaccine unique SNPs to differentiate vaccine FHV-1 isolates from other circulating FHV-1 s, and thus facilitate future epidemiological studies in FHV-1, especially to investigate the epidemiology of attenuated FHV-1 vaccines.

Historical isolates were obtained from clinical samples submitted to our laboratory as a component of past diagnostic services. Recent samples were collected from shelter-housed cats in 2004 to 2006 with approval from the Faculty of Veterinary Science, Animal Ethics Committee at The University of Melbourne (reference number 0004055.1) and with the consent from the shelter owners. Viruses were propagated in cultures of Crandell Rees feline kidney (CRFK) cells [23] for six passages, during which three plaque purifications were performed. CRFK cells are derived from a normal, female, 12 weeks old cat and are commercially available (ATCC CCL-94). Isolates selected for sequencing dating from 2004 to 2006 were all from animals that were negative for feline calicivirus, as determined by RT-PCR [24] . Viral nucleocapsid genomic DNA was purified and sequenced as described previously [16] . Libraries were prepared using 50 ng of viral genomic DNA with the Illumina Nextera DNA library preparation kits according to manufacturer's instructions, and loaded onto an Illumina MiSeq. Sequencing was carried out using a 300 cycle V2 SBS kit (Illumina) in paired-end format. Reads were trimmed to an error probability limit of 0.5 % and mapped against the prototype FHV-1 sequence, strain C-27 [GenBank:NC_013590], using medium-low sensitivity options in the bioinformatics package Geneious V6.1.7 [25] . For comparison, a de novo assembly of the genome of the F2 strain of FHV-1 from the Feligen vaccine (Virbac) was also performed using the medium-low sensitivity settings in Geneious. The details of the sequencing metrics are provided in Additional file 1: Table S1 .",

Default settings and score constraints for satellites with a maximum repeat unit length of 50 nucleotides were used. The identified repeat regions were removed from all viruses in the alignment as the methods used in this study do not allow the length of these regions to be accurately determined, and differences in the length of these regions could give rise to false positive recombination events being detected. The resultant whole genome alignments, as well as the separate UL, US and IRS genomic region alignments, were analysed for evidence of recombination. Splits network trees were generated with an uncorrected P characters transformation model, ignoring gapped sites. Other models were tested but yielded no significant topological differences. Statistical analyses of the recombination networks were performed using the Phi test as implemented in SplitsTree4 [30] . In RDP4 six different methods were used to assess the sequences for recombination breakpoints, MaxChi, Bootscan, SiScan, Chimaera, GENECONV and RDP, with default RDP4 settings used throughout.",
