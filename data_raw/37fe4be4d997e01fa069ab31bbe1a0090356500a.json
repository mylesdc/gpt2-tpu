Since explicit models of the incubation period enhance our understanding of the spread of disease, previous classic studies were revisited, focusing on the modeling methods employed and paying particular attention to relatively unknown historical efforts. The earliest study on the incubation period of pandemic influenza was published in 1919, providing estimates of the incubation period of Spanish flu using the daily incidence on ships departing from several ports in Australia. Although the study explicitly dealt with an unknown time of exposure, the assumed periods of exposure, which had an equal probability of infection, were too long, and thus, likely resulted in slight underestimates of the incubation period.",

Although the reason why the incubation period of acute infectious diseases tends to reveal a right-skewed distribution has been explored several times, the validity of the lognormal assumption is yet to be fully clarified. At present, various different distributions are assumed, and the lack of validity in assuming lognormal distribution is particularly apparent in the case of slowly progressing diseases. The present paper indicates that (1) analysis using well-defined short periods of exposure with appropriate statistical methods is critical when the exact time of exposure is unknown, and (2) when assuming a specific distribution for the incubation period, comparisons using different distributions are needed in addition to estimations using different datasets, analyses of the determinants of incubation period, and an understanding of the underlying disease mechanisms.",

According to a rigorous descriptive review [2] , historical descriptions of the incubation period can be traced back to the mid-16th century when Girolamo Fracastoro (Fracastorius) (1478-1553), an Italian physician, documented for the first time the incubation period of rabies in 1546 [3] . The incubation period of infectious diseases ranges from the order of a few hours, which is common for toxic food poisoning, to a few decades as seen in the case of tuberculosis, AIDS and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD). Since symptom onset reflects pathogen growth and invasion, excretion of toxins and initiation of host-defense mechanisms, the length of the incubation period varies largely according to the replication rate of the pathogen, the mechanism of disease development, the route of infection and other underlying factors.",

Moreover, during an outbreak of a newly emerged directly transmitted disease, the incubation period distribution permits determination of the length of quarantine required for a potentially exposed individual (i.e., by restricting movement of an exposed individual for a duration sufficiently longer than the incubation period) [10] . Further, if the time lag between acquiring infectiousness and symptom onset appears long (i.e., if the incubation period is relatively long compared to the latent period), it implies that isolation measures (e.g, restriction of movement until the infectious individual loses infectiousness) are likely to be ineffective, complicating disease control [1, 11] .",

The distribution is also useful in statistical approaches of epidemic curve reconstruction and short-term predictions of slowly progressing diseases; the backcalculation method uses the incubation period to estimate HIV prevalence and project the future incidence of AIDS [14, 15] . During the last decade, this method has also been extended to prion diseases such as Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) [16, 17] , vCJD [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] and Kuru [23] . Although backcalculation is not discussed in this paper, several rigorous reviews have been published with regard to diseases with a long incubation period [15, 17, 22, 28] . This approach has also recently diverged to quantification of the transmission potential of diseases with an acute course of illness [24] and infectiousness relative to disease-age [25] . Moreover, in cases such as the short and long incubation periods of Plasmodium vivax malaria in temperate zones, the incubation period also enhances ecological understanding of adaptation strategies; in temperate zones, clearly separate bimodal peaks with approximate lengths of 2 and 50 weeks are observed [26, 27] , helping malaria transmissions continue over the winter season when transmission is usually greatly reduced due to seasonal entomologic characteristics.",

Thus, it is often difficult to determine the incubation period without explicit information of the time of exposure. The majority of epidemiologic data informs us that exposure (i.e., infection) occurred in a defined period, data of which is referred to as interval censored [29] . This is a common concern for acute infectious diseases transmitted by droplets and droplet nuclei and, most noteworthily, was discussed in detail during the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [30, 31] . Previous studies on the population dynamics of influenza tend to make assumptions with regard to the incubation period distribution without employing observed data [32, 33] , perhaps mainly due to difficulties in identifying the time of exposure. The incubation period distribution of influenza remained almost unknown until a recent study reanalyzed the data of influenza transmission on an aircraft with a short duration of flight [34, 35] . Assuming Weibull distribution, this study estimated the mean (and standard deviation (SD)) incubation period as 1.48 (0.47) days [35] . Not only was the sample size of the estimate limited (i.e., 37 secondary cases), but since no other estimates are currently available, the present paper revisits a historical study on this topic.",

In this dataset, onset of 64, 17, 5 and 2 cases was observed on the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th day of voyage, i.e., after departure, on the documented ships ( Figure 1 ). No influenza case developed symptoms on or after the 5th day of voyage and the observed cases were thought to have been exposed to influenza before departure. Since the data for each voyage mainly included only a few initial cases that developed influenza on board, it is assumed that potential secondary transmission on board was negligible, and potential asymptomatic transmission was also ignored (detailed information on the observed and excluded secondary transmissions are documented in the original [43] and Dr. McKendrick also addressed the issue of secondary transmission by limiting the number of cases per ship).

However, this value was likely slightly underestimated, because the model implicitly assumed the possible time of exposure as being from time 0 to infinite before departure; it has been extensively discussed that data assuming long possible periods of exposure is likely to be uninformative. Moreover, in a recent work on SARS concerned with analysis of data with short periods of exposure [44] , the equal probability of exposure for each possible date was likely to have overestimated the variance of the incubation period distribution [31] . Thus, to obtain a precise estimate of the incubation period, appropriate censoring methods with well-defined short periods of exposure are needed in addition to a large sample size [30, 45] . However, despite these technical concerns, it is remarkable that Dr. McKendrick was able to estimate the incubation period of pandemic influenza considering the unknown time of exposure in the given data.",

Dr. Miner collected epidemic records of several outbreaks of typhoid fever, claiming that the length of the incubation period clearly differs by source of infection (i.e., comparing water-and food-borne outbreaks, he found that the food-borne outbreaks had a much shorter incubation period, most likely reflecting dose-response phenomena). During his analysis, Dr. Miner paid close attention to variance in the incubation period, describing a distribution that always skewed to the right. In calculating \"moments\" of the incubation period in a water-borne outbreak at the Old Salem Chautauqua, 1916, he used the following equation to explain the epidemic curve:",

Daily frequencies of influenza onset were observed after departure. Those who developed symptoms on board were assumed to have experienced exposure before departure. Since the time of exposure was difficult to identify explicitly, it was necessary to consider all possible times of exposure before departure. Asymptomatic infections and potential secondary transmissions on board were ignored. See supporting material for original descriptions and original data [36, 42, 43] . [66, 67] and is relatively well known among Japanese public health workers [68] [69] [70] . Dr. Horiuchi examined the validity and precision of Dr. Hirayama's method using Monte Carlo simulations, claiming that the method could be improved further [71] and suggesting that the incubation period should be assumed to follow \"non-central\" lognormal distribution when an epidemic curve is used [64] . That is, although Dr. Hirayama used the distance from the time of exposure to the median (x in eqn. (6)), this is unknown information in field observations, and thus, Dr. Horiuchi and his colleagues suggested the use of x-C, where C is the time of exposure. This permitted the more convenient use of calendar time. For example, let X be a random variable following non-central lognormal distribution, ln(X-C) should follow a normal distribution, N(\u03bc, \u03c3 2 ), and consequently, the following t becomes a linear function of ln(X-C):",

Indeed, it has been pointed out that the estimates obtained using the methods of Drs. Sartwell and Hirayama largely depend on optional percentile points, \u03b1 [76] , while that proposed by Dr. Horiuchi and his colleagues is also thought to be highly sensitive to an optional value, h [77] . Thus, estimates of the time of exposure should be addressed statistically by precise solution of the three-parameter lognormal distribution [78, 79] . Accordingly, in line with this, the maximum likelihood method was proposed [77, 80, 81] . Although Dr. Hill was the first to document the application of the maximum likelihood method [80] , it unfortunately remained relatively unknown, especially among Japanese epidemiologists, until Toshiro Tango, a statistician at the National Institute of Public Health, Japan, attempted to propagate the method and propose reasonable estimators during the 1990s [77, 81] . Let \u03b3 be the time of exposure, the pdf of the three-parameter lognormal distribution is given by: for x > \u03b3 . Other parameters are as in eqn. (4) . The likelihood function is given by the pdf: (11) The incubation period distribution of typhoid fever in Old Salem Chautauqua, 1916, fitted to Pearson's Type I distribu-tion Figure 2 The incubation period distribution of typhoid fever in Old Salem Chautauqua, 1916, fitted to Pearson's Type I distribution. The incubation period started at an assumed time of exposure due to a flood that occurred 4 days before closing the water supply to Chautauqua. Since there were 4 possible days of exposure to contaminated water, the original study used the mid-point as a single time point of exposure. See [46] for the original descriptions.",

The fundamental biological reason to assume lognormal distribution is related to an inoculation study of ectromelia virus (mouse pox) [83] , which suggested exponential growth of pathogens within the host during the initial phase. Another similar study suggested that a fixed threshold likely exists when the host response is observed [84] . Based on these findings, pathogen growth in inoculation experiments was modeled using the birth-death process, supporting right skewed distribution of the incubation period and its long tail [85] [86] [87] . Also, given similar results from further birth-death process models [76, 88] and another previous model [89] , what we have learnt to date can be described as follows: if the growth rate of a microorganism is implicitly assumed to follow normal distribution, and if there is a fixed threshold of pathogen load at which symptoms are revealed due to the host response, exponential growth of microorganisms should result in an incubation period sufficiently approximated by lognormal distribution.",

By assessing the goodness-of-fit, 61 out of the 86 examples (70.9%) were accepted as lognormal at a 5% level of significance or better, from which it was concluded that, in general, lognormal distribution represents the incubation period of acute infectious diseases [90, 91] . Through such efforts, the validity of the lognormal assumption has been supported by the accumulated experience of Dr. Sartwell and the above mentioned Japanese epidemiologists. It may also be true that the lognormal distribution was preferred because of its statistical usefulness (as described in the above Japanese study). However, the host-defense mechanism, which is almost entirely responsible for symptom onset, was later shown to be far more complex than previously expected. For example, fever is induced by very complex reactions and by several factors including circulating cytokines such as interluekin-2 [92] . Thus, whereas lognormal distribution may be applied to the incubation periods of many acute infectious diseases, it is necessary to bear in mind that the assumption is supported only by previous experience.",

As discussed above, Weibull distribution with a threshold (i.e., three parameter Weibull distribution) was assumed for the incubation period of influenza [35] . Such study indicates that a simple lognormal assumption does not always hold in practice. Other studies have assumed gamma distribution for the incubation periods of SARS and smallpox [24, 30, [93] [94] [95] , and regarding the latter, lognormal distribution has also been assumed [25, 96] . Figure 5 compares the quantile plots of lognormal and gamma distribution for the incubation period of smallpox, showing that both fit almost equally well with the observed data. For both distributions, the \u03c7 2 goodness-of-fit test revealed no significant deviation between the observed and predicted values (\u03c7 2 12 = 11.6, p = 0.48 and \u03c7 2 12 = 16.8, p = 0.16 for lognormal and gamma distributions, respectively). However, two-parameter Weibull distribution did not represent well the probability density functions of the incubation period (p < 0.001). These discussions imply that comparisons using different distributions are needed; it is important to at least compare the goodness-of-fit of different and arbitrarily chosen distributions for acute infectious diseases. The intervals between the median and other two vertical lines represent a and b, respectively. The illustration was drawn by the author with reference to [59] .",

One important reason for this is that the mechanisms of disease development for AIDS and prion diseases, for example, are far more complicated than those of acute infectious diseases. In the case of AIDS, where Weibull distribution is frequently assumed for the incubation period [15] , symptom onset is induced by immunodeficiency resulting from HIV infection followed by various opportunistic infections. For BSE and vCJD, various distributions have been assumed for the backcalculation, permitting some uncertainty analyses [19, 20, 22, 97] . Although the disease mechanisms of vCJD are yet to be clarified, considering within-host dynamics it is evident that the incubation period cannot be explained by the above simple explanation [98, 99] . That is, for these diseases, the above mentioned explanation for the lognormal assumption is not justified, and thus, the choice of distribution for the incubation period needs to be carefully assessed using sensitivity and uncertainty analyses. Indeed, various right skewed distributions are often used in sensitivity analysis, revealing whether or not the final results depend on the arbitrarily chosen standard distribution for the incubation period [19, 20, 97] .",

Second, the biological validity of assuming specific distributions for the incubation period remains an open question [100, 101] , and thus, further information is needed. For example, within-host dynamics would help clarify disease onset mechanisms in the most explicit way [102] . Moreover, if information associated with within-host dynamics is not available, an accumulation of distributions obtained using different datasets would be of interest, as would examination of various characteristic factors (e.g., dose-response mechanisms [6, 7, 9] , and variable susceptibility due to age, race and genetic factors (for example, see [45, 94] )).",

Although it was not highlighted in the present paper, Norman T. J. Bailey also formed a framework using a chain binomial model, which is useful for household transmission data [103, 104] . This method estimates the incubation period as the sum of the mean latent period, which follows normal distribution, and a further fixed infectious period; however, the estimated period does not precisely imply the incubation period, but rather is closer to what is presently referred to as the serial interval [48, 105] . That is, the incubation period that can be extracted from household transmission data remains to be clarified.",

            "text": "The lessons that can be learnt from the presented discussion are as follows: (I) although it is historically remarkable that the incubation period of pandemic influenza was assessed based on an explicit understanding of an unknown time of exposure, the assumed periods of exposure were too long and equal probability of exposure was assumed for each possible date. Well-defined short periods of exposure are needed to decipher the incubation period distribution using appropriate statistical methods. Taking this point into account will be critically important in estimating the incubation period of newly emerging diseases in the future. (II) The epidemiologic usefulness of the lognormal assumption was highlighted with respect to the basic characteristics of lognormal distribution, but this assumption is likely to remain unwarrantable until details of disease mechanisms are fully clarified; thus, this assumption may be merely an approximation of the rightskewed distribution. For example, considering the mechanisms of disease development, the lognormal assumption does not hold for HIV/AIDS and prion diseases. However, this limitation of the lognormal assumption does not imply that such approximation of the incubation period distribution is meaningless. Rather, it suggests that when parametric models are assumed, it is at least necessary to compare the goodness-of-fit for several distributions in order to overcome some of the uncertainty. Various datasets on the same disease would also help assess the uncertainty. Further, it would be informative if the determinants could be clarified even by simple stratifications (e.g., with respect to sex, age and genetic factors). Ideally, assumptions in the future should be supported by a detailed understanding of the underlying disease mechanisms provided by observations of within-host dynamics. Since the incubation period of infectious diseases is directly relevant to prevention and control, and because such knowledge can enhance our theoretical understanding of the spread of disease, further clarifications of the above points are deemed necessary.

The horizontal axis shows the time since exposure and the distribution the frequency of cases according to the time of onset. The vertical dashed line is the median incubation period observed x days after exposure. The remaining two vertical lines indicate the times when fractions \u03b1 and 1-\u03b1 of cases developed the disease.",

The diagonal reference lines show the line of fit. The maximum likelihood estimates of the mean (\u03bc) and standard deviation (\u03c3) for lognormal distribution were 2.47 (95% CI: 29.1, 38.6) and 0.36 (0.31, 0.41), respectively. The shape (\u03b1) and scale (\u03b2) parameters for gamma distribution were estimated as 33.6 (95% CI: 29.1, 38.6) and 0.36 (0.31, 0.41), respectively. See [96] for detailed descriptions.",
