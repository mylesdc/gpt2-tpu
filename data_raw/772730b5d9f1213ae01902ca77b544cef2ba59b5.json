The inhibitory CD200 receptor (CD200R) suppresses the activation of myeloid cells and lack of this pathway results in a reduction of tumor growth, conversely a tumorigenic effect of CD200R triggering was also described. Here we investigated the role of CD200R activation in syngeneic mouse tumor models. We showed that agonistic CD200R antibody reached tumors, but had no significant impact on tumor growth and minor effect on infiltration of immune myeloid cells. These effects were reproduced using two different anti-CD200R clones. In contrast, we showed that CD200-deficiency did decrease melanoma tumor burden. The presence of either endogenous or tumor-expressed CD200 restored the growth of metastatic melanoma foci. On the basis of these findings, we conclude that blockade of the endogenous ligand CD200 prevented the tumorigenic effect of CD200R-expressing myeloid cells in the tumor microenvironment, whereas agonistic anti-CD200R has no effect on tumor development.",

            "text": "CD200 and its receptor (CD200R) are involved in the regulation of inflammation in various pathologies including autoimmune diseases, infections and cancer [1] [2] [3] [4] . Lack of this regulatory pathway in Cd200 -/mice leads to exacerbation of autoimmune diseases e.g. autoimmune encephalomyelitis and collagen-induced arthritis in mice [2] . Immune checkpoints, such as the inhibitory CD200 receptor (CD200R) axis, play a dual role in balancing the immune system during microbial infection [3, 5, 6] . Moreover, several viruses e.g. human herpesvirus 8 or myxoma virus have CD200 orthologues that can trigger endogenous CD200R [7, 8] and regulate myeloid cell function [9] . We previously showed, that lack of CD200R signaling strongly enhances type I interferon production and viral clearance, and improves the outcome of PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0210796 January 17, 2019 1 / 11 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 mouse hepatitis coronavirus infection, particularly in female mice, because CD200R ligation inhibits TLR7 signaling [10] . The tumor microenvironment is dominated by immune cells that play a key role in tumor progression and foster proliferation, survival, and migration of transformed cells [11] [12] [13] . On the other hand, immune cells in the tumor microenvironment could facilitate an anti-tumor cellular response if activated properly. Elevated levels of CD200 are found in multiple types of cancer and many reports suggest that it is responsible for the suppression of anti-tumor immune responses [14, 15] . It was proposed that treatment with blocking anti-CD200 antibodies might be beneficial for patients with CD200-expressing cancers [16] . In addition, we previously showed that the absence of CD200R signaling pathway inhibits the growth of endogenous cancer cells even without CD200 expression in the tumor cells [17] . However, CD200 seems to have a dual role in cancer development and metastasis [4] . In the highly aggressive breast cancer 4THM animal model, the use of CD200R agonists exert a potent inhibitory effect on inflammation-driven carcinogenesis and metastasis [18] . In contrast, CD200-positive squamous cells carcinoma has an enhanced ability to metastasize [19] . Moreover, in the EMT6 breast carcinoma animal model CD200 overexpression results in increased lymph node metastasis [20] . These finding support tumorigenic effects of CD200R signaling in the tumor microenvironment in certain circumstances.",

            "text": "The Cd200R gene has undergone a rapid evolution in mice, creating a variety of inhibitory and activating receptors in different mice strains. Most common laboratory mouse strains (e.g. C57BL/6, Balb/c, C3H/Hej) have only one inhibitory CD200R (CD200R1), whereas CD200R2 is expressed in AKR, CD1 and NOD strains [21] . There are four paired activating receptors CD200RLa, CD200RLb, CD200RLc, and CD200RLe, only first of these is expressed by the C57BL/6, Balb/c, C3H/Hej mouse strains. This variety of CD200R alleles is not recapitulated in humans, since people have only one inhibitory and activating CD200R. In both mice and humans, the activating receptors do not bind CD200 and their natural ligand is unknown [22, 23] .",

These tumor models are known to be more immunogenic and are syngeneic to the C57BL/6 mice strain that has more proinflammatory characteristics. Again we found no significant effect of anti-CD200R on the growth of subcutaneously inoculated LLC (Fig 3A) nor of intravenously inoculated B16F10, resulting mostly in foci formation in the lungs (Fig 3B) . Since LLC grew in flat tumors we decided to quantify its growth as a surface, whereas B16F10 growth was monitored by light emitted from luciferase, expressed by tumor cells. Again in LLC tumors, we did not observe any difference in the percentage of main myeloid cell populations (Fig 3C) . Similarly, in the lungs of B16F10 tumor-bearing mice, no difference in the percentage of main myeloid cell populations was found (Fig 3D) . We investigated the expression of CD200R and observed a significant decrease of CD200R on intratumoral myeloid cells upon the intravenous treatment with anti-CD200R (Fig 3E) , proving penetration of antibody into the subcutaneous LLC tumor. These results suggest that agonistic anti-CD200R has no effect on tumor growth in wild-type mice with endogenous CD200 ligand. To further investigate the role the CD200-CD200R axis on tumor growth we used luciferase-expressing B16F10 melanoma cells inoculated into syngeneic Cd200 -/and control wildtype (WT) C57BL/6 mice. Both, direct measurements of tumor volume (Fig 4A) , as well as bioluminescence (BLI) measurements of the same tumors (Fig 4B) , revealed that Cd200 -/mice developed smaller tumors as compared to control WT mice (Fig 4A) . B16F10 cells with (B16F10-CD200 cells) or without (B16F10-EV cells) CD200 expression were inoculated i.v. into WT or Cd200 -/mice to see whether tumor-expressed CD200 can affect tumor growth. Intravenously inoculated B16F10 cells disseminate to the lungs and other organs and their growth can be monitored with BLI. Regardless of the CD200 expression in tumor cells, control WT mice had higher tumor burden as compared to Cd200 -/mice (Fig 4C and 4D) , similarly to the subcutaneous tumor models (Fig 4A and 4B) . Although the lung tumor burdens after inoculation of B16F10-CD200 and B16F10-EV cells was comparable in WT mice, the CD200 negative tumors grew significantly slower in the lungs of Cd200 -/mice as compared to CD200 expressing melanomas (Fig 4C and 4D) . These results indicate that tumor development is accelerated by both endogenous and tumor-derived CD200 expression. CD200R-signaling affects the growth and progression of cancer, however, its precise mechanism of action is not clear. Lack of CD200 expression inhibits endogenous skin tumors development [17] . Additionally, expression of CD200 on cancer cells correlates with poor patient prognosis [14] and increases the frequency of immunosuppressive Treg cells [20] . All these indicate a positive effect of CD200R on tumor growth by inhibition of the antitumor response. However, a tumor-supportive effect is also possible when CD200R signaling inhibits the activity of protumor myeloid cells [19, 26] . The dominant effect probably depends on tumor immunogenicity, composition of myeloid cells expressing the CD200R and the tumor inflammation.",

Triggering of CD200R by agonistic anti-CD200R reduces CD200-negative melanoma tumor formation in the lungs particularly via inhibition of a Gr1 + myeloid cell population, that feasibly protects metastatic cancer cells from surveillance by immune cells [26] . Importantly, cancer cells used in that study overexpressed ovalbumin, a strong adjuvant able to induce an adoptive anticancer response. In our study, injection of agonistic anti-CD200R antibodies as a monotherapy did not affect the growth of CD200-negative subcutaneous tumors: melanoma, breast, and lung carcinoma in syngeneic tumor models. This suggests that in the absence of immunogenic antigen, e.g. OVA, agonistic anti-CD200R is not effective in the presence of endogenous CD200. Using CD200-positive and CD200-negative melanoma tumor cells, we showed that lack of CD200-CD200R interaction in a Cd200 -/host does inhibit tumor growth of CD200-negative cells. Expression of CD200 either on host or melanoma cells promotes tumor cell growth. However, triggering of CD200R by agonistic anti-CD200R did not further enhance tumor growth.",
