Confluent or near-confluent cell culture monolayers in 96-well disposable microplates are prepared. Cells are maintained in MEM or DMEM supplemented with FBS as required for each cell line. For antiviral assays the same medium is used but with FBS reduced to 2% or less and supplemented with 50 \u00b5g/ml gentamicin. The test compound is prepared at four log 10 final concentrations, usually 0.1, 1.0, 10, and 100 \u00b5g/ml or \u00b5M. The virus control and cell control wells are on every microplate. In parallel, a known active drug is tested as a positive control drug using the same method as is applied for test compounds. The positive control is tested with each test run. The assay is set up by first removing growth media from the 96-well plates of cells. Then the test compound is applied in 0.1 ml volume to wells at 2X concentration. Virus, normally at <100 50% cell culture infectious doses (CCID50) in 0.1 ml volume, is placed in those wells designated for virus infection. Medium devoid of virus is placed in toxicity control wells and cell control wells. Virus control wells are treated similarly with virus. Plates are incubated at 37 o C with 5% CO 2 until maximum CPE is observed in virus control wells. The plates are then stained with 0.011% neutral red for approximately two hours at 37 o C in a 5% CO 2 incubator. The neutral red medium is removed by complete aspiration, and the cells may be rinsed 1X with phosphate buffered solution (PBS) to remove residual dye. The PBS is completely removed and the incorporated neutral red is eluted with 50% Sorensen's citrate buffer/50% ethanol (pH 4.2) for at least 30 minutes. Neutral red dye penetrates into living cells, thus, the more intense the red color, the larger the number of viable cells present in the wells. The dye content in each well is quantified using a 96-well spectrophotometer at 540 nm wavelength. The dye content in each set of wells is converted to a percentage of dye present in untreated control wells using a Microsoft Excel computer-based spreadsheet. The 50% effective (EC 50 , virus-inhibitory) concentrations and 50% cytotoxic (CC 50 , cellinhibitory) concentrations are then calculated by linear regression analysis. The quotient of CC 50 divided by EC 50 gives the selectivity index (SI) value.",

The antiviral cytoprotection assays examine the effects of compounds at designated dose-response concentrations in specific cell types to test the efficacy of the compounds in preventing the virus-induced cytopathic effect. Ribavirin is included as a positive control drug for influenza and RSV, while calpain IV inhibitor is used for SARS antiviral assays. Subconfluent cultures of cells are plated into 96-well plates for the analysis of cell viability (cytotoxicity) and antiviral activity (CPE). For the standard assay, drugs are added to the cells 24 hours later. The CPE wells also received 100 tissue culture infectious doses (100 TCID 50 s) of titered virus. 72 hours later the cell viability will be determined. Measurement of viral-induced CPE is based on quantitation of ATP, an indicator of metabolically active cells. The CPE assay employs a commercially available CellTiter-Glo \u00ae Luminescent Cell Viability Kit (Promega, Madison, WI), and is a reliable method for determining cytotoxicity and cell proliferation in culture. The procedure involves adding the single reagent (CellTiter-Glo Reagent) directly to previously cultured, subconfluent cells in media. This induces cell lysis and the production of a bioluminescent signal (half-life greater than 5 hours, depending on the cell type) that is proportional to the amount of ATP present (which is a biomarker for viability).",
