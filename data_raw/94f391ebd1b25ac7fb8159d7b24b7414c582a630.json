At every step of the algorithm, one of the above-mentioned operations is used to generate a new parameter set that replaces a vertex in the simplex representing parameters with the worst objective value. If no better parameter set is found, all vertices are drawn halfway toward the current best vertex. This requires new simulation runs to evaluate the objective function for the updated parameter set. The dimension of the polytope always remains the same; containing m + 1 vertices. The algorithm converges if the relative difference between the best and worst function values in the new polytope is less than the defined relative tolerance. The method is illustrated in Algorithm S1. Based on [22, 23] best values for the Nelder-Mead parameters are \u03c1 = 1 (reflection coefficient),",
