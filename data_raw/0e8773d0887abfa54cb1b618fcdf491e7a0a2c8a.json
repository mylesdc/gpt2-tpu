            "text": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major worldwide health problem which can cause acute and chronic hepatitis and can significantly increase the risk of liver cirrhosis and primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Nowadays, clinical therapies of HBV infection still mainly rely on nucleotide analogs and interferons, the usage of which is limited by drug-resistant mutation or side effects. Defensins had been reported to effectively inhibit the proliferation of bacteria, fungi, parasites and viruses. Here, we screened the anti-HBV activity of 25 scorpion-derived peptides most recently characterized by our group. Through evaluating anti-HBV activity and cytotoxicity, we found that BmKDfsin4, a scorpion defensin with antibacterial and Kv1.3-blocking activities, has a comparable high inhibitory rate of both HBeAg and HBsAg in HepG2.2.15 culture medium and low cytotoxicity to HepG2.2.15. Then, our experimental results further showed that BmKDfsin4 can dose-dependently decrease the production of HBV DNA and HBV viral proteins in both culture medium and cell lysate. Interestingly, BmKDfsin4 exerted high serum stability. Together, this study indicates that the scorpion defensin BmKDfsin4 also has inhibitory activity against HBV replication along with its antibacterial and potassium ion channel Kv1.3-blocking activities, which shows that BmKDfsin4 is a uniquely multifunctional defensin molecule. Our work also provides a good molecule material which will be used to investigate the link or relationship of its antiviral, antibacterial and ion channel-modulating activities in the future.",

            "text": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the prototypic member of hepadnaviridae and the pathogenic cause of acute and chronic type B hepatitis in humans. Chronic HBV infection, which now affects health of more than 400 million people around the world, has been demonstrated to result in a 100-fold elevation in the risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [1] . Although effective vaccines have been extensively applied for years, the increase in the amount of infected individuals and the difficulties of treatment after infection are still perplexing to physicians and researchers. Interferon-\u03b1 and nucleotide analogues are available for alleviating a patient's condition, but their therapeutic application is seriously limited by side effects and resistant mutated virus strains. Furthermore, combination therapies based on these drugs exerted unsatisfactory response efficiency [2, 3] . Therefore, studies aimed at developing new, efficient anti-HBV agents are very urgently desired. Scorpions evolved particular venom systems during their hundreds of millions of years of evolution. For the sake of predation and defending predators, multiple types of neurotoxins have been generated, which can block or regulate the activities of a variety of ion channels [4] [5] [6] [7] . In addition, anti-microbial peptides (AMPs) are also major components of scorpion venom peptides. These small peptides have exerted functional diversity, such as modulating innate immunity, regulating oncogenesis and directly inhibiting various bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites [8] [9] [10] . In recent years, several studies about scorpion-derived antiviral peptides have been reported. For example, a scorpion venom-derived synthetic peptide, Mucroporin-M1, was reported to immediately interfere the virion of measles, SARS-CoV and influenza H5N1 viruses [11] , and inhibit HBV replication in vitro and in vivo by activating the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and down-regulating HNF4\u03b1 [10] . Mutations of another scorpion-derived peptide, Ctry2459, showed an extremely enhanced bioavailability and anti-HCV activity compared with the wild-type peptide [12] . In addition, another two scorpion venom peptides were also reported due to their inhibitory activity against herpes simplex virus type I [13] . Thus, scorpion venom is a resource of novel antiviral peptides.",

BmKDfsin4 stood out from 25 scorpion peptides because of its high inhibition rate of HBeAg and HBsAg in the supernatant of HepG2.2.15 cells and relatively low cytotoxicity. Then, a further investigation of cytotoxicity and anti-HBV activity of BmKDfsin4 had been conducted which concluded that the inhibitory activity of BmKDfsin4 against HBV replication is concentration-dependent and its selective index (ratio of CC 50 to IC 50 ) is relatively high compared with its cytotoxicity. Furthermore, BmKDfsin4 also exerted considerable serum stability. BmKDfsin4 is the first reported scorpion defensin, which is a novel anti-HBV agent with potential for future modification and application.",

The anti-HBV activity of these peptides at 10 \u00b5M was then determined by measuring the concentrations of HBeAg ( Figure 1a ) and HBsAg (Figure 1b) in cell culture medium of HepG2.2.15 cells by ELISA assays. BmKDfsin4 exerted a higher inhibitory activity against both HBeAg and HBsAg compared with any other scorpion-derived peptide. The inhibitory effect was 77.46% and 82.46%, respectively. The cytotoxicity of these peptides at 50 \u00b5M on HepG2.2.15 cells was measured by an MTT assay (Figure 1c ). After being treated with BmKDfsin4 at 50 \u00b5M for 48 h, the cell viability of HepG2.2.15 cells was 83.18%, which indicates a relatively low cytotoxicity. ",

Compared with its high anti-HBV activity, the MTT assay indicated that BmKDfsin4 has a low cytotoxicity in HepG2.2.15 cells (CC50 = 167.82 \u03bcM), HepG2 cells (CC50 = 154.24 \u03bcM) and L-02 cells (CC50 = 103.77 \u03bcM). As for HepG2.2.15 cells, which is a stable transferred cell line of 1.3-fold HBV genome, the selective index of BmKDfsin4 was valued as high as 133.20. In addition, BmKDfsin4 also exerted extremely low hemolytic activity on human erythrocytes. The serum stability of BmKDfsin4 was measured by the inhibitory rate of HBeAg and HBsAg, after being incubated with 10% serum for a serial time points. As there was only a slight decrease in inhibitory activity against both HBeAg and HBsAg after a 24 h incubation, BmKDfsin4 was thought to have a strong serum stability.",

Compared with its high anti-HBV activity, the MTT assay indicated that BmKDfsin4 has a low cytotoxicity in HepG2. 20 . In addition, BmKDfsin4 also exerted extremely low hemolytic activity on human erythrocytes. The serum stability of BmKDfsin4 was measured by the inhibitory rate of HBeAg and HBsAg, after being incubated with 10% serum for a serial time points. As there was only a slight decrease in inhibitory activity against both HBeAg and HBsAg after a 24 h incubation, BmKDfsin4 was thought to have a strong serum stability.",

Having the typical sequence and predicted structure characteristics of defensin, BmKDfsin4 is the first scorpion defensin with experimental evidence of antiviral activity. It is worth mentioning that only the scorpion defensin BmKDfsin4 can inhibit HBV replication in the cultured HepG2.2.15 system among the tested 25 peptides from scorpion venoms. Different from BmKDfsin4, all the other 24 non-active peptides are short linear peptides which are not cross-linked by disulfide bridges. The scorpion defensin BmKDfsin4 should be deduced to have more strong serum stability than the other 24 short linear peptides, which was partially confirmed by the result that BmKDfsin4 has a strong serum stability in the above anti-HBV tests. Meanwhile, the phenomenon was possibly related to antiviral mechanisms. Although the antiviral mechanisms of linear peptides are various, most short linear peptides may inhibit virus infection and replication by interacting with viral envelopes or surfaces of capsids and then destroying the structure of virions. However, HepG2.2.15, the cell line used for the antiviral experiments in our study, was derived from a human hepatoblastoma (HepG2). In HepG2.2.15, HBV genome was stably incorporated into the host genome and HBV was replicated. Therefore, HepG2.2.15 could continuously produce infectious HBV virions, but it was not successfully infected by HBV particles.",
