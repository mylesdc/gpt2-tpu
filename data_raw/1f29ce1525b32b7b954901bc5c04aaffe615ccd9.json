In this study, we characterized the ultrastructure of NDiV, determined its complete genome sequence and made comparisons with other known nidoviruses. Electron microscopic observation revealed that the NDiV strain isolated in China produced viral nucleocapsid-like particles and vesicles in host cells. The extracellular virions were enveloped and were spherical with short spikes. The complete genome sequence of the newly isolated NDiV was submitted to the GenBank database (GenBank accession number KF522691). Sequencing of the viral genome showed that the homologies of NDiV isolated in China and Vietnam were greater than 94.0% and 89.0% at the nucleotide and amino acid sequence levels, respectively. Moreover, gene substitution was detected, whereas insertions and deletions were not. A phylogenetic tree analysis showed that these viruses belong to the genus Alphamesonivirus1 of the family Mesoniviridae. The similarity between the two viruses regarding morphological and molecular biological characteristics indicates that the molecular genetics of NDiV are conservative and that the regional differences are unlikely to have a significant effect. This is the first report of the isolation and complete sequencing of a mesonivirus in mainland China.",

The Nam Dinh virus (NDiV) was identified in mosquitoes, and no evidence of vertebrate infection by this virus has been detected. NDiV was found to be a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA ([+]ssRNA) virus. The 20,192 nucleotide (nt)-long genome contains two major open reading frames (ORFs), ORF1a and ORF1b, which encode two proteins (pp1a and pp1ab, respectively) using a ribosomal frame shift mechanism. The intact NDiV virion exhibited a spherical form with a diameter of 60-80 nm 2 . The structure, replication and transcription patterns of the viral genome were similar to those of coronaviruses in the order Nidovirales. A phylogenetic analysis showed that NDiV is distantly related to coronaviruses, indicating that this virus represents a missing link in the transition from small to large nidoviruses.",

Thus, it is most frequently detected in Culex mosquitoes, particularly C. pipiens quinquefasciatus, indicating that Culex mosquitoes are probably the major host of NDiV in nature. An analysis of 39 CavV isolates from different habitat types along an anthropogenic disturbance gradient showed an increase in virus prevalence from natural to modified habitat types 10 . The data for CavV isolates support the hypothesis that disturbed habitats, particularly human settlements, support the proliferation of endemic viruses more efficiently than undisturbed primary forest. As in our study, NDiV-positive adult mosquitoes were also collected in or near areas of human habitation in the USA, Indonesia and Vietnam. The increasing trend of NDiV movement from natural to modified habitat types, similar to CavV of the same species, Alphamesonivirus 1, requires further confirmation based on statistical evidence obtained by expanding the types of sites sampled and increasing the number of mosquito samples. Kuwata 5 reported that the replication and growth of DKNV found in Vietnam was supported by the cell lines C6/36, NIAS-AeAI-2 and NIID-CTR, whereas replication was not supported by the vertebrate cell lines Vero, BHK-21, HmLu-1 and CCL-141. Replication of CavV, HanaV, MenoV and NseV found in Cote d'Ivoire was detected in infected C6/36 cells but not in the other vertebrate cell lines tested 6 . Growth of the NDiV-02VN178 and SZ11706Z strains was detected only in C6/36 cells 1 , indicating a greater susceptibility of insects than of vertebrates to infection by mesoniviruses. During the period from 2005 to 2001, Nga isolated NDiV from the cerebrospinal fluid of acute encephalitis syndrome patients without JEV infection in the C6/36 cell line 11 , indicating that NDiV infects vertebrates. Thus, it is necessary to conduct further investigations of the molecular epidemiology of NDiV in patients with acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) of unknown etiology.",

In this study, we found that the homology of NDiV-SZ11706Z and NDiV-02VN178 with CavV was greater than 90.0% based on the aa sequences of 3CL pro , RdRp and Hel1. The phylogenetic positions of the viruses were compared based on the 3CL pro , RdRp and Hel1 domains that are conserved in mesoniviruses and on the sequences of putative proteins 1ab of other representative species of mesoniviruses. Our analysis showed that NDiV-SZ11706Z and NDiV-02VN178 share a common ancestor node and form a separate rooted branch. These results support the classification of NDiV-SZ11706Z as a species of Alphamesonivirus 1.",

Interestingly, in the area where the first species of Alphamesonivirus was found, a new species of Alphamesonivirus was later found. For example, after CavV (Alphamesonivirus-1) was found in Cote d'Ivoire, new species of Alphamesonivirus including HanaV, MenoV and NseV (Alphamesonivirus-2,3,4) were found in succession 6 . After NDiV was found in the province of Nam Dinh in northern Vietnam, DKNV (Alphamesonivirus-8) was identified in the province of Dak Nong in southern Vietnam 5 . In this study, we successfully isolated NDiV from a location in Shenzhen, China. This suggests that the new species of Alphamesonivirus may exist in southern China.",

NDiV isolated in China shows a major difference in the ORF3b region compared to NDiV isolated in Vietnam, although no morphological differences between the two isolates were apparent based on observation by electron microscopy. The similarity between the two viruses in morphological and molecular biological characteristics indicates that the molecular genetics of NDiV are conserved and that regional differences are unlikely to have a significant impact. However, further studies involving animal experiments are required to investigate potential differences in the pathogenicity of NDiV.",

The GenBank/Refseq accession numbers of the nidovirus species are as follows: BoCoV, bovine coronavirus (NC_003045); HCoV OC43, human coronavirus OC43 strain ATCC VR-759 (AY585228); MHV, murine hepatitis virus strain A59 (AY700211); HCoV HKU1, human coronavirus HKU1 genotype B (AY884001); SARS-CoV, SARS coronavirus CUHK-AG03 (AY345988); Ty-BatCoV-HKU4, bat coronavirus HKU4-1 (EF065505); Pi-BtCoV-HKU5, bat coronavirus HKU5-1 (EF065509); Ro-BatCoV-HKU9, bat coronavirus HKU9-1 (EF065513); BWCoV, Beluga whale coronavirus SW1 (NC_010646); IBV, avian infectious bronchitis virus (NC_001451); PEDV, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (NC_003436); HCoV NL63, human coronavirus NL63 isolate Amsterdam 057 (DQ445911); HCoV 229E, human coronavirus 229E (NC_002645); TGEV, TGEV Purdue P115 (DQ811788); FCoV, feline coronavirus (NC_007025); WBV, white bream virus (NC_008516); BToV, Breda virus (NC_007447); EToV, Berne virus (X52374); MenoV, Meno virus strain E9/ CI/2004 (JQ957873); NseV, Nse virus strain F24/CI/2004 (JQ957874); MoumouV, Moumou virus strain C88/ CI/2004 (KC768950); HanaV, Hana virus strain A4/CI/2004 (JQ957872); DKNV, Dak Nong virus (AB753015); CavV, Cavally virus isolate C79 (HM746600); NDiV-VIE, Nam Dinh virus isolate 02VN178 (DQ458789); NDiV-CHN, Nam Dinh virus isolate SZ11706Z (KF522691); YHV, yellow head virus (EU487200); GAV, gillassociated virus (NC_010306); EAV, equine arteritis virus (NC_002532); SHFV, simian hemorrhagic fever virus (NC_003092); PRRSV, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus isolate PA8 (AF176348); LDV, lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus Plagemann strain (U15146).
