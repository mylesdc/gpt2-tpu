It is unclear, however, whether cellular mRNA turnover pathways are engaged to assist in this process. In Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus this phenotype is enacted by the host shutoff factor SOX. Here we show that SOX-induced mRNA turnover is a two-step process, in which mRNAs are first cleaved internally by SOX itself then degraded by the cellular exonuclease Xrn1. SOX therefore bypasses the regulatory steps of deadenylation and decapping normally required for Xrn1 activation. SOX is likely recruited to translating mRNAs, as it cosediments with translation initiation complexes and depletes polysomes. Cleaved mRNA intermediates accumulate in the 40S fraction, indicating that recognition occurs at an early stage of translation. This is the first example of a viral protein commandeering cellular mRNA turnover pathways to destroy host mRNAs, and suggests that Xrn1 is poised to deplete messages undergoing translation in mammalian cells.",

Indeed, recent studies show that changes in mRNA stability account for as much as 40% to 60% of the changes in steady-state mRNA levels in basic cellular processes such as signaling pathways [1] , stress responses [2] and cell differentiation [3] . A core set of conserved enzymes is responsible for both basal and regulated mRNA degradation in eukaryotes, including two potent exoribonucleases, the 59-39 exonuclease Xrn1 and a 39-59 exonucleolytic complex called the exosome (reviewed in [4, 5] ). The activity of these exonucleases on eukaryotic mRNAs is kept in check by the presence of a 59 7-methylguanosine cap and a 39 poly(A) tail, which prevent access to the message body. Poly(A) removal by one of the cellular deadenylases is likely the rate limiting step of basal mRNA degradation [6] and is in turn required for message decapping [7] by the Dcp2 enzyme in complex with the activator Dcp1A and other cofactors [8, 9] . Endonucleases are also emerging as important contributors to eukaryotic mRNA decay, particularly in the context of quality control pathways or other situations requiring rapid inactivation of select messages [10] .",

Viruses often interface with degradation pathways to prevent turnover of their genomic or messenger RNAs [11, 12] , and can downregulate specific messages using both viral and cellular microRNAs (miRNAs), often to modulate immune evasion or other steps in their lifecycle [13] . Some viruses can even co-opt core mRNA degradation components for their own purposes, as flaviviruses do to generate noncoding subgenomic viral RNAs [14] . However, no example has been found of viruses that use the mRNA turnover machinery to broadly target cellular messages for destruction. Several virusencoded factors can cause widespread degradation of cellular mRNAs and block host gene expression (host shutoff), but it is unclear what role host pathways play in this context [15, 16, 17, 18] .",

            "text": "One of the viruses causing extensive host mRNA degradation is Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), the etiologic agent of Kaposi's sarcoma, primary effusion lymphoma, and B-cell type multicentric Castleman's disease [19, 20, 21] . During lytic infection with KSHV or other human and murine gammaherpesviruses, expression of the viral protein SOX (ORF37; BGLF5 in Epstein-Barr virus) induces degradation of the majority of the cellular messenger RNAs [15, 18, 22, 23, 24] . This depletion of cytoplasmic mRNAs leads to nuclear relocalization of poly(A) binding protein (PABPC), which subsequently drives mRNA hyperadenylation in the nucleus and a concomitant mRNA export block [25, 26, 27] . Thus, SOX activity in the cytoplasm triggers a cascade of events that further restricts gene expression. SOX belongs to a family of DNA alkaline exonucleases (DNases) that are conserved in all herpesviral subfamilies and have roles in processing and maturation of the newly replicated viral DNA genomes. In vitro, several herpesviral SOX homologs exhibit robust 59-39 DNase activity and weaker exonuclease activity towards RNA substrates [28, 29, 30, 31, 32] . It is notable, however, that only the homologs from viruses of the gammaherpesvirus subfamily can promote RNA turnover in cells, and in these proteins the DNase and host shutoff activities can be genetically separated [15, 33] . It is therefore unclear to what extent the in vitro RNase activity contributes to the host shutoff activity in cells, and what cellular cofactors may participate in the specific targeting and efficient destruction of mRNAs.",

Unlike canonical cellular mRNA decay, in which Xrn1 generally gains access to mRNAs only after deadenylation and decapping, SOX generates substrates for Xrn1 that have not undergone these rate-limiting events. Our data suggest that this occurs via a SOX-induced site-specific endonucleolytic cleavage on each mRNA, thus providing an accessible 59 end for Xrn1-mediated degradation of the mRNA body. Furthermore, we show that SOX co-sediments with 40S translation initiation complexes, and causes mRNA cleavage at an early stage of translation. SOX specifically targets polymerase (Pol) II-generated mRNAs, but not RNAs transcribed by Pol I or Pol III. This leads to a global depletion of cellular mRNAs in polysomes, and explains the preferential targeting of messenger RNAs during host shutoff. Our data suggest a model in which the virus co-opts host mRNA decay pathways to rapidly liberate cellular translation machinery, presumably to create an optimal host environment for viral gene expression and replication.",

While they have also recently been shown to exhibit RNase activity in vitro, mutational analyses indicated that this activity cannot fully account for SOX-induced mRNA degradation in cells [28] . We therefore hypothesized that SOX co-opts cellular mRNA degradation machinery to enact host transcriptome destruction. We reasoned that the 59-39 exoribonuclease Xrn1 would be a likely candidate co-factor, as it plays a major role in basal mRNA turnover in the cytoplasm. To test the involvement of Xrn1 in SOX-mediated mRNA degradation, we monitored SOX-induced turnover of a GFP reporter mRNA in 293T cells upon transfection of Xrn1-specific versus control small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Unexpectedly, depletion of Xrn1 did not protect full-length GFP mRNA, but it resulted instead in accumulation of a shorter GFP RNA intermediate ( Figure 1A ). The intermediate could be specifically detected by Northern blotting with probes against the 39 but not the 59 end of the mRNA (Figure 1A) , indicating a 59 end truncation. The reliance on Xrn1 to assist in the degradation of mRNA in SOX-expressing cells was also observed for three additional reporter mRNAs, including DsRed2 ( Figure 1B and S1A-B) and for the endogenous cellular transcript glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH, Figure 1C ). Notably, although the full-length GFP and DsRed2 reporter mRNAs are of similar size (1.2-1.5 kb), the lengths of their degradation intermediates were different: the GFP fragment was approximately 1.1 kb whereas the DsRed2 fragment was ,600 bp (data not shown). In addition, the GAPDH mRNA generated multiple cleavage intermediates. This indicates that the generation of the intermediates is not controlled by a positional cue, such as distance from the mRNA ends.",

In SOX expressing cells, insertion of the SLII element within the 39 UTR of the DsRed2 reporter resulted in the appearance of a protected fragment of a size consistent with the portion of the mRNA downstream of the SLII ( Figure 1D ). In contrast, RNA fragments were not observed upon insertion of the SLII in the DsRed2 coding region upstream of the predicted 59 end of the intermediate or in the 59 UTR. This agrees with the observation that the 59 portion of the mRNA is removed via an Xrn1-independent mechanism. Results consistent with this interpretation were also obtained for the GFP and b-globin reporters (Figure S1C-E). Collectively, our data suggest that SOXmediated RNA depletion is a two-step process: an initiating event that removes a portion of the 59 end of the mRNA, which is then followed by exonucleolytic degradation of the remaining fragment by the host Xrn1 enzyme.",

Several results, however, indicate that SOX promotes mRNA degradation by Xrn1 while bypassing the requirement for deadenylation.

We also find that SOX co-sediments with translation complexes, and specifically targets mRNAs for cleavage at an early stage of translation. We hypothesize this allows the virus to selectively target mRNAs, thereby liberating host gene expression machinery.

Although at least one additional decapping enzyme exists in mammalian cells [35] , overexpression of the Dcp2 mutant was sufficient to reduce basal mRNA turnover of the GFP-2xSLII reporter, consistent with an inhibition of decapping activity ( Figure S2B ). We also depleted levels of the hRrp41 subunit of the 39-59 exosome and saw no difference between control and exosome siRNA-treated cells in our assay, in agreement with previous observations [25] ( Figure  S2D ). Neither 59 nor 39 degradation fragments were detected upon hRrp41 knockdown ( Figure S2E ). A caveat with siRNA knockdown experiments in general is that negative results could be due to insufficient depletion of the protein.

Indeed, the defined length of the intermediates that we observe following Xrn1 depletion is strikingly reminiscent of the Smg6-cleaved intermediates seen during nonsense mediated decay (NMD) [36, 37] . A defined-length intermediate also suggests that cleavage is directed to a specific location or sequence within the mRNA. The different size of the intermediate observed in GFP and DsRed2 (compare Figures 1A and 1B) further indicated that a specific element, rather than positional information, is likely to direct the truncation. To test whether there is a specific sequence that leads to an endonucleo- lytic cut in the presence of SOX, we constructed a modified GFP reporter that contained an internal in-frame repeat of a 201 nt region encompassing the predicted cleavage site ( Figure 3A , GFPrep). If this region contained an element targeted by an endonuclease, we expected that in the presence of SOX, GFPrep would give rise to two intermediates, assuming that the two cleavage events were equally likely and mutually exclusive. Indeed, we found that the GFPrep reporter generated two intermediates of sizes corresponding to two independent cleavage events ( Figure 3B , arrowheads). These data suggest that an element within the initial To identify sequences involved in directing the internal cleavage, we used 59 rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) to map the 59 end of the degradation intermediates found in GFP, DsRed2 and b-globin. In all cases our RACE results confirmed what we had previously seen with the Northern blot analysis, in that a single predominant intermediate was amplified in Xrn1depleted cells in a SOX-dependent manner ( Figure 3D and data not shown). The majority of the sequences within this band terminated at a single nucleotide or within few nucleotides of each other ( Figure S3 ). Analysis of the sequences surrounding the cleavage site for each mRNA revealed a conserved stretch of five bases (TGAAG) just upstream of the cleavage site. Deletion of the TGAAG element from the GFP construct abolished production of the cleavage fragment, confirming its role in SOX targeting ( Figure 3E ). However, insertion of this sequence alone (nt 131-138) or of a 25-nucleotide stretch (nt 126-150) surrounding the GFP cleavage site was not sufficient to elicit generation of a second fragment ( Figure 3F ). We therefore hypothesize that the TGAAG sequence is an essential component of a larger element, perhaps structural, involved in directing endonucleolytic cleavage of mRNAs in SOX-expressing cells.",

            "text": "The catalytic residues of SOX are required for host shutoff In vitro, several herpesviral homologs of SOX exhibit weak DNA endonuclease activity as well as RNase activity on linear RNA substrates [28, 29, 30, 38, 39, 40] . Thus, it is possible that SOX itself carries out the initial truncation of mRNAs in cells. Recently, the structure of SOX and its homolog BGLF5 in Epstein-Barr virus were solved, leading to the identification of catalytic residues responsible for the DNase activity of these proteins, as well as putative DNA binding residues [28, 30, 41] . Mutation of one of the catalytic residues in BGLF5 (D203S) was shown to abolish all in vitro nuclease activity without misfolding the protein [30] . To test whether the SOX catalytic core is required for host shutoff in vivo, we generated individual SOX mutants for each of the catalytic residues identified in the crystal structures: E184A, D221A or D221S (equivalent to D203S in BGLF5), E244A and K246I. Indeed, mutation of any one of the catalytic residues abolished the ability of SOX to deplete GFP mRNA in cells ( Figure 4A ). As a control, we mutated the putative DNA-binding residues (W135V, R139I, S144I, S146I, S219A, Q376G), which are also located in the active site cleft ( Figure S4C ), and found that only residues R139, S144 and Q376 were required for host shutoff ( Figure 4B ). This suggests that SOX may bind RNA and DNA using partially overlapping residues. In contrast with our host shutoff data, all the catalytic and putative DNA binding residues tested were required for in vitro DNase activity ( Figure S4A and S4B) . Thus, our mutational analysis suggests that the catalytic activity of SOXpresumably the RNase activity-is required for host shutoff.",

We used a line of BCBL-1 cells bearing an inducible version of the KSHV major lytic transactivator RTA (TREx BCBL-1-RTA) [45] to allow efficient lytic reactivation following RTA induction. Upon chemical stimulation of lytic KSHV replication in these cells (when SOX is expressed from the viral genome), we observed a significant decrease in the polysome population and a corresponding increase in 80S monosomes, consistent with degradation of actively translating mRNAs ( Figure 5A ). It should be noted that the level of polysome depletion during viral infection is likely underestimated, as ,20% of induced cells generally fail to enter the lytic cycle. The depletion of polyribosomes was not due to chemical treatment alone, because treatment of the KSHV negative BJAB B cell line did not result in a similar decrease in polysomes (data not shown). We next looked for the presence of SOX in gradient fractions from the corresponding polysome profiles of lytically reactivated BCBL-1 cells. As controls, we also blotted for PAIP2A, a protein not found in polysomes [46] , as well as the ribosomal protein RPS3 ( Figure 5B ). SOX appeared to sediment primarily with the ribonucleoprotein (RNP), 40S, and monosome fractions, and exhibited partial overlap with RPS3 ( Figure 5B ). Puromycin treatment disrupted polysomes but failed to alter the SOX sedimentation profile, arguing against a specific association with the 80S and polysome fractions (data not shown). To more accurately determine its sedimentation profile, we increased the resolution of the lighter molecular weight complexes using lower density sucrose gradients. These experiments revealed that SOX indeed sediments in both the RNP and 40S fractions, similar to Xrn1 ( Figure 5C ). Its sedimentation profile also overlapped with the eIF3j and eIF2a components of the 40S pre-initiation complex, which is recruited to the 59 cap prior to ribosomal scanning ( Figure 5C ). This is in contrast to the sedimentation of PABPC, which remains bound to the mRNA throughout the polysome fractions as well ( Figure 5C ; data not shown). Similar data were obtained upon transient expression of SOX in 293T cells ( Figure S5A ). We also tested the sedimentation profile of the SOX D221S catalytic mutant, and found it to mimic that of wildtype SOX ( Figure S5B ), indicating that the catalytic site of the protein is unlikely to be involved in its recruitment to target RNAs.",

Using a pure population of cells expressing GFP-SOX or GFP alone, we found that neither the endogenous Pol III-generated Y3 and 7SL cytoplasmic noncoding RNAs, nor the 18S rRNA transcribed by Pol I undergo turnover in the presence of SOX ( Figure 6A ). In contrast, we observed significant depletion of endogenous mRNAs transcribed by Pol II, including GAPDH, b-actin, and stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) in SOX-expressing cells ( Figure 6A ). In principle, the inability of SOX to degrade the non-Pol II transcripts could be due to the absence of an ORF, or the presence of RNP complexes occluding SOX cleavage sites. To exclude these possibilities, we expressed the GFP reporter under the control of Pol I or Pol III promoters and found that in both cases, the GFP RNA was not targeted by SOX ( Figure 6B ). We confirmed using subcellular fractionation experiments that the inability of SOX to promote degradation of these RNAs was not due to a failure of the RNAs to be exported ( Figure S6E and S6F) .

However, in Xrn1-depleted cells, SOX still induced cleavage of this mRNA with similar efficiency as wild-type GFP, and at the same site ( Figure 6F ). In agreement with the DEMCV-GFP data, we observed that SOX could also promote turnover of a GFP mRNA with a 60 nt adenylate tract inserted in the 59 UTR (59A60-GFP) ( Figure S6D ), which similarly reduced GFP protein production ( Figure S6C) . A 50-70 nt adenylate-rich tract in the 59 UTR of PABPC has likewise been shown to repress translation of its message in an autoregulatory manner as a consequence of PABPC protein binding to this region [48] . Consistent with the sedimentation profile of SOX, these data suggest that in SOXexpressing cells, mRNAs are targeted for cleavage at an early step during translation, perhaps prior to AUG recognition.",

Thus, the virus is able to make use of the available host mRNA turnover machinery, yet bypass the rate limiting events that normally precede activation of Xrn1. Collectively, these data and our previous studies reconcile the seemingly disparate observations that the gammaherpesvirus SOX homologs promote potent host shutoff, yet exhibit relatively weak in vitro RNase activity. We hypothesize that while SOX can catalyze RNA cleavage, it does so in a site-specific manner in cells and requires one or more cellular factors to recruit and/or position it on the mRNA substrate, as well as host enzymes to complete the degradation process.",

Additionally, the observation that deadenylation and Dcp1/2-mediated decapping are not required to generate the degradation intermediate suggest that the 59 and 39 ends of the mRNA remain intact at the time of cleavage. We predict that SOX induces a sequence-specific rather than a position-dependent cut, as duplicating a 201 nt region surrounding the cut site yielded a second degradation intermediate, and addition of sequences upstream of the cleavage site did not alter the cleavage efficiency or location. We identified a conserved stretch of five nucleotides just upstream of the cut site in three different reporters. This consensus site was necessary, but not sufficient to elicit cleavage, suggesting that it represents a portion of a larger element required for SOX targeting. We hypothesize that the full element is a complex sequence or structure, perhaps degenerate, enabling it to be widespread among cellular mRNAs.",

One possibility is that another host 39-59exonuclease instead mediates degradation of the upstream fragment, or plays a compensatory role upon exosome depletion. This might explain the limited protection of the 59 fragment afforded by exosome knockdown in studies of another eukaryotic endonuclease [36] .

This would allow the virus to selectively eliminate competing host mRNAs, while sparing regulatory RNAs that may be necessary for its own gene expression. Eukaryotic translation initiates with the recruitment of the 40S ribosomal subunit to the cap via interactions with translation initiation factors, followed by scanning to the AUG codon and recruitment of the 60S subunit. Two observations indicate that recognition and turnover in SOX-expressing cells are initiated prior to 60S joining. Specifically, insertion in the 59 UTR of elements that presumably inhibit or prematurely terminate 40S scanning, and thus significantly reduce protein production, does not affect SOX activity. Moreover, the degradation intermediate accumulates preferentially in the 40S fraction. Our finding that SOX cosediments with the 40S initiation complex suggests that an association with translation initiation machinery directs it to mRNAs. Supporting this prediction is the failure of SOX to target translationally incompetent reporter and endogenous RNAs transcribed by RNA polymerase I or III.",

Interestingly, our data show that cleavage can occur hundreds of nucleotides away from the site of translation initiation. One interesting parallel to these seemingly discrepant observations is that of the E. coli endonuclease RNase E, which can cleave anywhere along the length of the RNA (preferably within AU-rich sequences), but requires a monophosphate at the mRNA 59 end. Thus, similar to our proposed model for SOX activity, RNase E can simultaneously recognize two nonadjacent regions of the primary RNA sequence [61] . These observations can be reconciled by the fact that RNAs adopt secondary and tertiary structures within a cell that could presumably enable such sequences to be juxtaposed. Alternatively, this distance could be bridged if there was an additional interaction of SOX with a host protein co-factor bound to the cleavage element.",

            "text": "While this is the first example of a viral protein working in concert with host RNA turnover components to broadly target cellular messages, it is likely that several other viruses use similar mechanisms to enact host shutoff. Alphaherpesviruses and SARS coronavirus also encode host shutoff factors (vhs and nsp1, respectively) that promote mRNA degradation, but bear no homology to SOX [16, 17] . In vitro data indicate that they similarly induce endonucleolytic cleavage of RNAs, and it has been proposed that degradation of the mRNA body in cells may be assisted by host exonucleases, although this has yet to be shown [62, 63, 64, 65, 66] . In addition, all three viral proteins appear to use components of the translation machinery as a means to access mRNA [62, 65, 67, 68, 69] . Such parallels suggest that these viruses have adopted remarkably similar strategies to execute mRNA decay, resembling those of host pathways like NMD. In addition to the enhanced rate of decay afforded by an endonucleolytic mechanism, the advantage for the virus may be that this strategy of host shutoff generates intermediates that look indistinguishable from products of quality control pathways. Such intermediates would then be readily degraded by the core degradation machinery and might not be recognized as aberrant, perhaps avoiding activation of stress or innate immune responses. Thus, understanding how viral endonucleases interface with host pathways may provide insight into how manipulation of these pathways contributes to infectious disease, as well as into events that regulate cellular RNA decay. Total cellular RNA was isolated for Northern blotting using RNA-Bee (Tel-Test). Where indicated, the NE-PER kit (ThermoScientific) was used for cellular fractionation prior to RNA extraction. Northern blots were probed with 32 P-labeled DNA probes made using either RediPrime II (GE Healthcare) or Decaprime II (Ambion) or, for b-globin, an SP6 transcribed 32 P-labeled riboprobe. RNase H assays were carried out as previously described [25] . Results in each figure are a representative of at least 3 independent replicates of each experiment. Image J (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/) was used for quantification of Northern and Western blots.",

Figure S1 Further evidence for a role for Xrn1 in SOXmediated mRNA turnover using additional reporters. The GFP-2xSLII construct, a modified GFP reporter containing two copies of the flaviviral Xrn1-blocking element SLII within the coding region was used to test the effect on decapping of the Dcp2 E148Q mutant. As shown in Figure 2A , the insertion of two SLII elements results in accumulation of protected RNA fragments even in the absence of SOX, presumably as a consequence of basal deadenylation-and decapping-dependent turnover by Xrn1. Thus, if the Dcp2 dominant negative (DN) mutant inhibits decapping of this mRNA, the appearance of the Xrn1-protected fragment should be diminished. (B) 293T cells were transfected with GFP-2xSLII and with increasing amounts of the Flag-tagged Dcp2 E148Q mutant (Flag-Dcp2 DN, 0-800 ng). Total RNA was Northern blotted with a 39 UTR GFP or an 18S probe. The image contrast and brightness were enhanced (middle panel) to highlight the shorter RNA species (arrowheads), as in the absence of SOX only a minor proportion of the full-length mRNA undergoes decay during the course of the experiment. Western blotting confirmed expression of the Dcp2 DN protein (bottom panel). The appearance of the protected fragments is reduced in the presence of the Dcp2 E148Q, indicating that Dcp2 E148Q is acting as a dominant negative mutant, in that it prevents the formation of decapped, Xrn1-accessible substrates during basal mRNA decay. (C) 293T cells were treated with control siRNAs or siRNAs against the decapping complex proteins Dcp1A and Dcp2, or the exonuclease Xrn1. They were then transfected with GFP in the presence of absence of SOX, and with the Dcp2 dominant negative E148Q (Dcp2 DN) construct where indicated. Total RNA was Northern blotted using a 39 UTR probe against GFP or 18S. Western blots demonstrate level of protein depletion after siRNA treatment and confirm Dcp2 DN overexpression. Actin was used as a loading control. Grey lines indicate where intervening lanes were cropped out of the image.

Total RNA was Northern blotted using a 59 or 39 UTR probe against DsRed2 or 18S (left panels). The arrowhead denotes degradation intermediates. The diagram shows the expected size of the 59 and 39 degradation intermediate generated by cleavage of the mRNA in the presence of SOX (top).

DNase assays were conducted to monitor the ability of in vitro translated 35 S-labeled SOX proteins to degrade linearized plasmid DNA. Mutation of any of the catalytic residues (A) or of the putative DNA binding residues (B) abolishes DNase activity (top panels). Autoradiography was used to confirm that the SOX mutant proteins were expressed at least to the level of wild-type SOX (bottom panels) (C) The position of the mutated residues were modeled within the SOX structure. The PDB coordinates (3FHD) from the structure of SOX as determined by Dahlroth et al. [41] were entered in MacPymol to generate a pictorial representation of the structure. Putative catalytic residues are shown in red (coordinated around a Mg 2+ ion) and putative DNA-binding residues are in blue. All marked residues were largely required for DNase activity as shown above. All the catalytic residues (E184, D221, E244, K246) were required for host shutoff ( Figure 4A ). In contrast, of the DNA binding residues, some (R139, S144, Q376) were required for host shutoff, while others (W135, S146, S219) were dispensable ( Figure 4B ).

GFP protein expression was assessed by Western blot analysis. Actin was used as a loading control. (B) 293T cells were co-transfected with the normal GFP reporter and GFP-HR with or without SOX. Cells were divided into nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions from which total RNA and protein were extracted. RNA was Northern blotted with a probe annealing to the first 300 bp of the GFP coding region or an 18S probe (upper panels), and protein lysates were Western blotted with a-hnRNP-C1 and a-Hsp90 antibodies to assess the purity of nuclear/ cytoplasmic fractions (lower panels). (C) 293T cells were transfected with increasing amounts (100-300 ng) of GFP or a 59A60-GFP construct containing a stretch of adenosines in the 59 UTR (depicted in diagram).

(E-F) 293T cells were transfected with either Pol I-driven GFP (E) or Pol IIIdriven GFP (F) reporter constructs in the absence or presence of SOX. Samples were fractionated into nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions and processed for RNA and protein as described in (B).",
