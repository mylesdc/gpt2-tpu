STE inhibited replication of EV71, as evident by its ability to diminish plaque formation and cytopathic effect induced by EV71, and to inhibit the synthesis of viral RNA and protein. Moreover, daily singledose STE treatment significantly improved the survival of EV71-infected mice, and ameliorated the symptoms. Mechanistically, STE exerts multiple effects on enteroviral infection. Treatment with STE reduced viral attachment and entry; the cleavage of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4 G (eIF4G) by EV71 protease, 2A pro ; virus-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation; and relocation of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. It was accompanied by a decline in EV71-associated hyperphosphorylation of p38 kinase and EPS15. It is plausible that STE may inhibit ROS-induced p38 kinase activation, and subsequent hnRNP A1 relocation and EPS15-mediated membrane trafficking in infected cells. These findings suggest that STE possesses anti-EV71 activities, and may serve as health food or candidate antiviral drug for protection against EV71.",

After viral attachment to receptor, the virus is endocytosed via clathrin-coated vesicles, and uncoated to release the genomic RNA. Unlike cellular message RNA, the viral genomic RNA lacks the cap structure on 5\u2032 end to recruit ribosome and initiate protein translation. Its highly structured 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) contains internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) which interacts with IRES trans-acting factors (ITAFs) and facilitates the initiation of translation 12, 13 . Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) is one member of ITAFs and is involved in the synthesis of viral genome and protein 14, 15 . EV71 infection induces the relocation of hnRNP A1 from nucleus to cytoplasm which may be beneficial to viral replication 14 . The viral protease, 2A pro , hydrolyzes eukaryotic initiation factor 4G (eIF4G) and poly(A) binding protein (PABP) that are essential for the cap-dependent translation [16] [17] [18] . The hydrolytic reactions cause the switch of cap-dependent translation to IRES-dependent translation. EV71 hijacks the host translation machinery to synthesize viral proteins 18 .",

The susceptibility to viruses, such as dengue virus, enterovirus 71 or coronavirus, is related to redox state of host cells [19] [20] [21] [22] . Antioxidants are known to deter viral infection. For instance, glutathione and resveratrol inhibit influenza infection in cell and animal model 23, 24 . Treatment with synthetic antioxidants, such as mitoTEMPO and N-acetyl-cysteine, and natural antioxidants, such as epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and gallocatechin gallate (GCG), diminishes EV71 replication 20, 25, 26 . The antiviral capacity of tea polyphenols correlates with their antioxidant ability. These studies suggest that the redox state of host is an important determinant of viral susceptibility, and that the antioxidative capacity of herbal extract partly accounts for the antiviral activity.",

Spikes, stems and leaves of ST are sun-dried or carbonized before use medicinally. ST contains a number of bioactive constituents (Supplementary Table S1 ) 27-34 . ST is used to treat the common cold, headaches, fever, allergic dermatitis, skin rash, and inflammatory diseases 28 . An antiviral activity is associated with ST. ST has been used in formulation of yinqiao-decoction, which proved effective in reduction of hemagglutinin titer of virus in lung tissue of influenza virus-infected mice 35 . However, previous reports on the anti-enteroviral activity of ST extract are controversial. Hsu et al. showed that a 95% ethanolic extract of ST inhibits one out of four clinical isolated EV71 in a screen of anti-EV71 activity with Taiwanese folk medicinal plants. In contrast, Lin et al. showed that an aqueous extract of dried ST has no anti-EV71 activity among 22 antipyretic and toxin-eliminating traditional Chinese herbs 37 .",

RD cells were infected with 100 PFU of different EV71 strains such as BrCr, 1743 and 4643, and overlaid with agarose containing 0, 625, or 1250 \u00b5g/ml of STE. STE significantly reduced plaque formation by BrCr strain, and completely abrogated plaque formation by 1743 and 4643 strains on RD (Fig. 1a) and Vero cells (Supplementary Fig. S1b ). At these concentrations, the STE did not have cytotoxic effect on RD cells (CC 50 = 3903 \u03bcg/ml) ( Supplementary Fig. S1a ) and Vero cells (CC 50 = 2268 \u03bcg/ml) ( Supplementary Fig. S1a ). To validate the antiviral effect of STE, we infected RD cells with BrCr strain at m. o. i. of 0.05, and quantified the level of genomic RNA. The level of EV71 RNA decreased by nearly 80% and 85% upon treatment with 625 and 1250 \u00b5g/ml STE, respectively (Fig. 1b) . It was paralleled by a dose-dependent decrease in expression of EV71 proteins, including viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase (3D pol ) and viral protease (3CD pro ). The expression levels of 3D pol were lowered by 67 and 80% in infected cells in the presence of 625 and 1250 \u00b5g/ml STE. Likewise, the expression levels of 3CD pro decreased by 56 and 69% in infected cells treated with 625 and 1250 \u00b5g/ml of STE (Fig. 1c) . Reduction in levels of genomic RNA and proteins of EV71 was accompanied by a significant decrease in progeny virus. The amounts of intracellular and extracellular viral particles decreased by more than 2 orders of magnitude in STE-treated infected cells, as compared to those of control treatment group (Fig. 1d) . These findings demonstrate that STE possesses an anti-EV71 activity.",

The switch between cap-dependent and IRES-dependent translation occurs during the course of EV71 replication 13, [38] [39] [40] . To study whether STE affects this process, we transfected cells with a bicistronic reporter pRHF-EV71-5\u2032UTR (Fig. 3a) , infected the transfected cells for an hour, and subsequently treated them with STE. The firefly luciferase activity/Renilla luciferase activity (Fluc/Rluc) ratio of EV71-infected cells increased by 25%, as compared to that of uninfected cells (p < 0.0001). STE treatment in post-adsorption phase effectively inhibited such increase (Fig. 3b) . The ratio of firefly and Renilla luciferase activities was indicative of the relative preponderance of IRES-and cap-dependent translation. These findings suggest that STE may abolish the EV71-induced switch from cap-to IRES-dependent translation. To further validate whether STE treatment prevents EV71-induced termination of host's translation, we examined the level of translation initiation factor eIF4G, a target of enteroviral proteases. RD cells were infected with EV71 at m. o. i. of 20, and treated with STE under conditions depicted in Fig. 2 . EV71 infection caused complete cleavage of eIF4G (condition 1). Pre-treatment with STE prior to viral adsorption (condition 2) did not affect this process. The presence of STE during viral adsorption phase partially blocked the cleavage (condition 3). Addition of STE to cells during post-adsorption significantly deterred eIF4G from cleavage (condition 4).

            "text": "It is plausible that STE interferes with IRES-dependent translation. It is known that a trans-acting factor hnRNP A1 relocates to cytoplasm, and interacts with EV71 5\u2032 UTR to facilitate the translation 14 . To explore this possibility, we studied whether STE treatment affects the relocation of hnRNP A1 in infected cells. We transfected RD cells with expression vector encoding a GFP-tagged hnRNP A1; infected the transfected cells with BrCr, and studied the effect of STE treatment. As shown in Fig. 3d , the GFP-tagged hnRNP A1 was localized in nuclei of mock-transfected cells. EV71 infection caused relocation of hnRNP A1 from nucleus to cytoplasm. Treatment of infected transfectants with 1250 \u00b5g/ml STE inhibited such change in hnRNP A1 distribution. A high throughput imaging was applied to quantify the percentage of cells showing cytoplasmic relocation of GFP-tagged hnRNP A1. The percentage of such cells in mock-infected cells was 15.30 \u00b1 3.33%, but it significantly increased to 57.15 \u00b1 4.66% in EV71-infected cells. STE treatment caused a significant reduction in cytoplasmic GFP-positive cells. The percentage of cytoplasmic GFP-positive infected cells dropped to 28.76 \u00b1 3.94% upon treatment with 312.5 \u00b5g/ml of STE (Fig. 3e) . These findings suggest that STE may suppress IRES-dependent translation through inhibition of hnRNP A1 relocation. STE suppresses the EV71-induced activation of p38 kinase. The p38 kinase is known to regulate hnRNP A1 translocation 41 . It is possible that STE negatively regulates hnRNP A1 translocation through its modulation of p38 signaling. To test such possibility, we infected RD cells with BrCr strain at m. o. i. of 20, treated the infected cells without or with 1250 \u00b5g/ml of STE, and harvested them for immunoblotting to phosphorylated p38 kinase and Erk. EV71 infection appeared to cause biphasic activation of p38 kinase. There was a modest increase in p38 kinase phosphorylation at around 15-30 min p. i. A second phase of stronger phosphorylation occurred at 3 h p. i., and the intensity of p38 kinase phosphorylation steadily increased up to 7 h p. i. (Fig. 4) . STE treatment significantly inhibited both phases of p38 kinase phosphorylation (Fig. 4) . On the contrary, EV71 infection did not induce phosphorylation of Erk 1 and 2 until at 7 h after viral adsorption. STE treatment did not significantly alter the kinetics of Erk phosphorylation. The essential role of p38 kinase activation in EV71 infection was demonstrated by the inhibitory effect of p38 kinase inhibitor SB202190 on VP1 expression (Fig. 5b , middle panel). The level of VP1 in EV71-infected cells was reduced by SB202190 in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, the production of progeny virus was suppressed by SB202190. The levels of intracellular and extracellular progeny virus produced by cells, which were treated with 10 or 20 \u00b5M SB202190, were over 85% lower than that of DMSO-treated cells (Fig. 5c) . These findings suggest that EV71 infection specifically activates p38 kinase, and STE suppresses p38 kinase activation. Intriguingly, treatment with SB202190 did not rescue eIF4G from cleavage (Fig. 5b, middle panel) , implying that the EV71-induced eIF4G cleavage is independent of p38 kinase activation.",

As shown in Fig. 5d , the percentage of cytoplasmic relocation of hnRNP A1 in BrCr-infected cells decreased in a dose-dependent manner. Such finding suggested that EV71 activates cytoplasmic hnRNP A1 translocation via p38 kinase pathway. STE reduces p38 kinase phosphorylation through an antioxidative mechanism. It has been known that hydrogen peroxide can induce p38 kinase phosphorylation 42, 43 , and that EV71 infection is associated with increased oxidative stress 25, 44 . This raises the possibility that EV71 may activate p38 kinase through ROS signaling, and STE may inhibit ROS signaling. To study such hypothesis, we first examined the antioxidative activity of STE. The antioxidative capacity of STE was quantified using the ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay, and was 105.9 mg of Trolox equivalent per gram of lyophilized STE. To further study the antioxidative roles of STE in curbing EV71 infection-associated ROS generation, we stained EV71-infected cells with fluorescent probes, H 2 DCFDA or CellROX Deep Red reagent, to determine ROS generation in EV71-infected cells. Elevated ROS levels were detected in BrCr-, 1743-, and 4643-infected cells, as compared with that of mock-infected cells ( Fig. 6 and Supplementary Fig. S2 ). However, STE caused significant reduction in ROS generation.",

            "text": "A number of mechanisms account for the ability of STE to inhibit infection at post-adsorption stage. STE blocks the EV71-induced suppression of host cell translation and the switch to viral translation. Viral protease 2A of EV71 can cleave eIF4G and PABP 16, 17 , both of which are necessary for translation of host cell mRNA. It is possible that STE directly inhibits protease 2A. Rosmarinic acid, one of bioactive constituents of STE 29 , is known to inhibit cysteine protease 51 . Another possible but not exclusive explanation is that STE reduces translation of viral RNA and thus the level of protease 2A. Initiation of viral RNA translation entails binding of ITAFs and host initiation factors to type I IRES element on 5\u2032UTR 12 . One member of ITAFs, hnRNP A1, interacts with stem loop II of IRES, which is required for enteroviral translation and replication 14, 15 . EV71 infection induces translocation of hnRNP A1 from nucleus to cytoplasm (Fig. 3d) , where it stimulates IRES activity 13 . A similar observation has been made in poliovirus-infected cells 52 . The ability of STE to suppress cytoplasmic relocation of hnRNP A1 may accounts for reduced enteroviral translation and replication. Besides, apigenin has been shown to prevent interaction between EV71 RNA and hnRNP A1 53, 54 . The glycosidic derivative of apigenin, The shuttling of hnRNP A1 between cytoplasm and nucleus can be regulated by ROS. Arsenite treatment that induces oxidative stress causes cytoplasmic relocation of hnRNP A1 [55] [56] [57] . We have also found that hydrogen peroxide treatment of RD cells results in translocation of hnRNP A1 from nucleus to cytoplasm ( Supplementary  Fig. S3) . It has been shown that EV71 infection causes mitochondrial dysfunction and NADPH oxidase activation 25, 44 , resulting in ROS generation. The increase in ROS may elicit subsequent signaling and hnRNP A1 relocation. STE may act as ROS scavenger to block hnRNP A1 translocation. Consistent with such notion, STE displays strong antioxidant capacity 27 . Moreover, STE significantly reduced ROS generation in EV71-infected cells (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Fig. S2 ). It is possible that ROS scavenging by STE diminishes hnRNP A1 translocation.",

            "text": "EV71-induced signaling may involve participation of MAPK-related pathways. Activation of p38 kinase promotes EV71 replication 58, 59 . Inhibition of p38 kinase suppressed enteroviral translation (Fig. 5b) . It is likely that p38 kinase play important roles in EV71 infection. Consistent with this, the p38 kinase signaling cascade is involved in regulation of the subcellular distribution of hnRNP A1 58 . Activation of p38 kinase is sufficient to promote relocation of hnRNP A1 41 . Pharmacological inhibition of p38 kinase blocked such translocation process (Fig. 5d) . We have shown that STE inhibited EV71-induced activation of p38 kinase (Fig. 4) . The mechanism underlying the action of STE remains elusive. It has been known that ROS themselves are activator of p38 kinase [60] [61] [62] . Hydrogen peroxide treatment caused p38 kinase phosphorylation, which was suppressed in Figure 8 . STE alleviates the clinical symptoms of and enhances the survival of EV71 infected mice. (a) Sevenday-old ICR mice were intraperitoneally infected with 2 \u00d7 10 6 PFU MP4. One day later, EV71-infected mice were treated with single dose of STE (250 mg/kg) (n = 16) or water (10 ml/kg) (n = 15) daily for 14 days. The survival rate (a), and clinical symptoms in STE-treated (b) or water-treated (c) mice were recorded daily for 17 days. The clinical symptoms, including weakness, weight loss, paralysis of one limb, paralysis of more than one limb, and death, were recorded daily. the presence of STE (Fig. 5a) . Antioxidant treatment inhibits p38 kinase activation 60, 62 . It is possible that STE scavenges ROS to reduce activation of p38 kinase. In addition, STE may affect expression of enzymes involved in redox metabolism. For instance, STE down-regulates expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase 63 . Oral administration of STE induces hepatic expression of catalase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase in a mouse model of inflammation 27 . These findings suggest that STE may suppress activation of p38 kinase and hnRNP A1 relocation via an antioxidative mechanism. EPS15, another target of p38 kinase, appears to play important roles in EV71 infection. It was identified independently as a phosphorylated protein of EGFR complex in EGF-stimulated cells 64 , and as a binding protein of \u03b1-adaptin and oncogenic variant of Crk 65, 66 . Confocal microscopic study revealed co-localization of EPS15, \u03b1-adaptin and clathrin in clathrin-coated pits 67 . Silencing of EPS15 expression reduces the endocytosis of EGFR and transferrin moderately 68 . These findings imply that EPS15 is involved in ligand-induced endocytosis 69 . Recent findings have suggested that phosphorylation of EPS15 modulates its biochemical activity 46 . Phosphorylation of Tyr850 of EPS15 is required for ligand-induced endocytosis 69 . EPS15 is phosphorylated at Ser796 by p38 kinase, and the location of this phosphorylation site implies a functional role in endocytic process 70 . It has been revealed that EPS15 plays an essential role in EV71 infection. Knockdown of EPS15 significantly reduces the extent of enteroviral infection 71 . Such result has been interpreted as the essentiality of endocytosis in infectious entry process of EV71. What is more, EPS15 may be implicated in membrane trafficking essential to EV71 replication. We found a robust increase in phosphorylation of p38 kinase and EPS15 during the mid-to late phase of EV71 life cycle (Figs 4 and 7) , suggesting a role for EPS15 in replication. In agreement with this, enterovirus exploits the endocytic machinery to transfer cholesterol from plasma membrane and culture medium to replication organelles, where cholesterol facilitates RNA replication and 3CD pro processing 47 . The antiviral activity of STE may be, at least in part, accounted for by its ability to inhibit p38 kinase and EPS15 phosphorylation.",
