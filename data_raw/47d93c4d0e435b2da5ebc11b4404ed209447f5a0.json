However, the mechanisms of its protective effects on ARDS are largely unknown. Here, we report that ACE2 prevents LPS-induced ARDS by inhibiting MAPKs and NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. Lentiviral packaged Ace2 cDNA or Ace2 shRNA was intratracheally administrated into the lungs of male SD rats. Two weeks after gene transfer, animals received LPS (7.5 mg/Kg) injection alone or in combination with Mas receptor antagonist A779 (10 \u03bcg/Kg) or ACE2 inhibitor MLN-4760 (1 mg/Kg) pretreatment. LPS-induced lung injury and inflammatory response were significantly prevented by ACE2 overexpression and deteriorated by Ace2 shRNA. A779 or MLN-4760 pretreatment abolished the protective effects of ACE2. Moreover, overexpression of ACE2 significantly reduced the Ang II/Ang-(1-7) ratio in BALF and up-regulated Mas mRNA expression in lung, which was reversed by A779. Importantly, the blockade of ACE2 on LPSinduced phosphorylation of ERK1/2, p38 and p50/p65 was also abolished by A779. Whereas, only the ERK1/2 inhibitor significantly attenuated lung injury in ACE2 overexpressing rats pretreated with A779. Our observation suggests that AEC2 attenuates LPS-induced ARDS via the Ang-(1-7)/Mas pathway by inhibiting ERK/NF-\u03baB activation.",

ARDS is a type of acute diffuse and inflammatory lung injury, which is caused by the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the recruitment of granulocytes and monocytes into the lung, leading to increased pulmonary vascular permeability and loss of aerated alveolus 3,4 . At present, the only effective therapy for ARDS is protective mechanical ventilation with low tidal volume of 6 mL/kg 5 . No specific and effective pharmacological intervention for ARDS is currently available 6 . Therefore, it is urgent to identify, validate, and develop pharmaceutical drugs for the treatment of ARDS.",

            "text": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a homologue of ACE, shares approximately 61% homology sequence with the catalytic domains of ACE but acts as an endogenous counter-regulator of ACE 7 . In contrast to ACE, which cleaves angiotensin (Ang) I into Ang II, ACE2 primarily hydrolyzes Ang II into Ang-(1-7). Ang II triggers vasoconstriction, inflammation, proliferation and apoptosis via binding to its specific Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1R), while Ang-(1-7) counteracts the effects of Ang II via its G protein-coupled receptor Mas 8-10 . Therefore, the balance of ACE and ACE2 influences the endogenous ratio of Ang II to Ang-(1-7), and consequently contributes to the regulation of the tension of vascular, as well as inflammatory response and organ function after injury 11,12 . Accumulating evidence indicate that ACE2 plays an important role in the pathophysiology of ARDS. ACE2 has been identified as a key receptor of coronavirus that causes the severe acute respiratory syndrome, and its level in human airway epithelia positively correlates with coronavirus infection 13 . Compared with wild type mice, Ace2 knockout mice exhibited impaired exercise capacity, worse lung function and exacerbated lung fibrosis in model of bleomycin-induced lung injury 14 . Furthermore, in three animal models of ARDS, Ace2 knockout mice showed severe lung disease, including enhanced vascular permeability and increased lung edema as compared to wild type mice 15 . Treatment with recombinant ACE2 effectively improved symptoms and attenuated arterial hypoxemia in a piglet model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ARDS 16 . Thus, ACE2 plays a protective role in ARDS and is potential for the development as a drug for ARDS therapy; however, the underlying molecular mechanism by which ACE2 prevents ARDS remains elusive.",

            "text": "Previous studies have showed that the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) pathway is associated with the process of ARDS. The phosphorylation levels of p38 MAPK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) are all significantly increased in LPS-induced lung injury 17 . Consequently, inhibition of p38 MAPK or ERK efficiently attenuates LPS-induced pulmonary inflammatory response 18, 19 . The activity of p38 MAPK in the lung has been associated with peritoneal sepsis-induced pulmonary edema and leukocyte infiltration 20 . Interestingly, Ferreira et al. recently found that activated cardiac ACE2 prevents hypertension-induced cardiac fibrosis by inhibiting ERK phosphorylation 21 . Moreover, AT1R blocker, telmisartan, exerts protective effects on heart failure through upregulating myocardial ACE2 level and inhibiting p38 MAPK, ERK and JNK phosphorylation 22 . The activation of MAPKs pathway is also involved in the regulation of Ace2 mRNA expression in rat vascular smooth muscle cells 23 . In addition, LPS stimulation activates the NF-\u03ba B signaling pathway via binding to toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), which is closely related to LPS-induced lung injury and inflammation 24 . Our previous in vitro study demonstrated that ACE2 prevented rat pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) from LPS-induced apoptosis and inflammation through inhibiting the activation of JNK and NF-\u03ba B pathways 25 . Therefore, we hypothesize that ACE2 may protect against LPS-induced acute lung injury by inhibiting the MAPKs/ NF-\u03ba B pathway.",

While rat and mouse models are the most widely used models for ARDS research, recent research has shown disparities of the LPS structures that are recognized by TLR4 between humans and mice, which may contribute to variability in the response to LPS-induced ARDS. Additionally, the relatively small mass of mice may prohibit the measurement of physiological parameters and also make it more difficult to obtain sufficient quantities of samples, such as blood, plasma and BALF 26,27 .

Compared with control animals, ACE2 mRNA and protein levels in the lung tissue of the Lv-ACE2 group (rat lung transfected with Lenti-Ace2) were increased by 9.47 and 4.21 fold, respectively; in contrast, the ACE2 mRNA and protein levels in Lenti-Ace2-RNAi infected rat lungs (Lv-ACE2-RNAi group) were decreased by 52% and 80%.

After 8 hours, LPS treatment resulted in acute lung injury as demonstrated by edema, inflammation, and hemorrhage ( Fig. 2A) . The lung injury score (Fig. 2B ) and BALF protein level (Fig. 2C ) of the LPS group were significantly increased as compared with the control group. ACE2 overexpression in rat lung markedly attenuated LPS-induced lung injury and decreased the lung injury score and BALF protein level. In sharp contrast, silencing ACE2 noticeably deteriorated LPS-induced lung injury as evidenced by increased lung injury score and BALF protein level. Furthermore, pretreatment with either A779, a potent and selective antagonist of Ang-(1-7) via competitively binding with its specific Mas receptor, or MLN-4760, the ACE2 inhibitor, significantly inhibited the protective effects of ACE2 on LPS-induced lung injury. The lung injury score and BALF protein level of the LPS+ ACE2+ A779 group were significantly higher than that of LPS+ ACE2 group, suggesting that ACE2 protects rat from LPS-induced acute lung injury, partially via Mas-mediated signaling.",

In different ARDS models, loss of ACE2 in mice resulted in more aggravated lung injury, whereas recombinant ACE2 attenuated the symptoms of ARDS in Ace2-knockout mice, especially in wild type mice 15 . The lung injury in ARDS mouse model caused by limb ischemia-reperfusion (LIR) was deteriorated by Ace2 depletion while protected by Ace2 transgene, and the changes of ACE2 expression in lung tissue were accompanied by alteration of Ang II/Ang-(1-7) ratio 33 . Prior studies have shown that down-regulation of ACE2 expression in lung and increased serum Ang II level are associated with severity of respiratory syncytial virus H7N9 or H5N1-induced ARDS, which is also ameliorated by administration of recombinant human ACE2 [34] [35] [36] . Moreover, the decrease of ACE2 activity in BALF of ventilated animals exposed to LPS was correlated with enhanced BALF Ang II but reduced Ang-(1-7) levels 11 . Similar to these previous studies, our results showed that ACE2 overexpression in rat lung reduced the BALF Ang II level and further increased Ang-(1-7) level in animals treated with LPS. The ratio of Ang II to Ang-(1-7) in BALF was significantly decreased by ACE2 overexpression while markedly increased by ACE2 knockdown. Despite the most of evidences suggest an decrease of Ang-(1-7) level in lung tissue during the development of ARDS, there are some conflicting results from published literatures. The Ang-(1-7) level in BALF increases during mechanical ventilation-induced rat lung injury but decreases after 24 hours of LPS administration 11 . In a mouse ARDS model, Ang-(1-7) in lung tissue was shown a decrease after 24 hours of LPS challenge 37 . In the early stage of LIR-induced ARDS, the lung tissue Ang-(1-7) level significantly increased at 1 hour and persisted up to 12 hours after reperfusion 33 . In the present study, we found that LPS administration caused a significant increase of Ang II and also an unexpected increase of Ang-(1-7) in BALF. In renin-angiotensin system, Ang-(1-7) is mainly generated by ACE2 hydrolyzing Ang II, but it also can be generated by ACE catalyzing Ang-(1-9). It is possible that the increased levels of Ang-(1-7) in lung tissue may play a compensatory role in the initial development of ARDS.",

Our current study showed that LPS administration stimulated the phosphorylation of P38 MAPK, ERK1/2 and JNK, which was significantly reduced by ACE2 overexpression in lung tissue. Moreover, Ace2 shRNA enhanced the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and JNK in rat lung. Either Mas receptor antagonist or ACE2 inhibitor completely abolished the inhibitory effects of AEC2 on LPS-induced p38 MAPK and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Combined prevented Ang II-mediated myocardial injury through blocking the activation of ERK1/2 45 .

Upon stimulation by LPS or pro-inflammatory cytokines, I\u03ba B protein is phosphorylated by activating I\u03ba B kinase (IKK) and degraded, leading to activation and then translocation of NF-\u03ba B into the nucleus to upregulate transcription of inflammatory genes 47, 48 . The activation of NF-\u03ba B is pivotal to the development of endotoxin-induced ARDS in animals 49, 50 . Imai et al. identified the TLR4-NF-\u03ba B signaling pathway as a key role in controlling severity of acute lung injury 24 . In the present in vivo study, overexpressing ACE2 in the rat lung significantly suppressed LPS-induced NF-\u03ba B p50/p65 phosphorylation and enhanced I\u03ba B\u03b1 expression, which was completely reversed by Mas receptor antagonist or ACE2 inhibitor pretreatment. In contrast with ACE2 overexpression, silencing ACE2 markedly enhanced LPS-induced activation of NF-\u03ba B p50/p65 and degradation of I\u03ba B\u03b1 . These results indicate that NF-\u03ba B signaling pathway is also important and may cooperate with MAPKs pathway to facilitate the protective effect of ACE2 against LPS-induced ARDS.

Clinically, intravenous administration of recombinant human ACE2 in healthy humans results in increased, decreased or unchanged Ang-(1-7) serum concentration without cardiovascular effects 51 . In a clinical trial performed by Petty WJ et al., Ang-(1-7) administration led to a decrease of plasma placental growth factor level in cancer patient with clinical benefit 52 , suggesting that the Ang-(1-7)/Mas pathway is a promising therapeutic target of ARDS.",
