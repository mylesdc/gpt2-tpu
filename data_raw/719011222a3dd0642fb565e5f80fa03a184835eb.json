Abisko virus has a genome organization similar to that of the insect-infecting negeviruses, but phylogenetic and compositional bias analyses also reveal strong affiliations with plant-infecting viruses, such that both the primary host origin and taxonomic identity of the virus remain in doubt. In an extensive set of larval, pupal, and adult autumnal moth and winter moth (Operophtera brumata) outbreak samples, the virus was only detected in a few adult E. autumnata moths as well as the single larval transcriptome. The Abisko virus is therefore unlikely to be a factor in the Fennoscandia geometrid population dynamics.",

In northern Fennoscandia, vast areas of mountain birch forests are recurrently defoliated by larvae of two geometrid species. In colder, continental areas the more cold-tolerant species, the autumnal moth (Epirrita autumnata) dominates while the winter moth (Operophtera brumata) prefers the warmer inland and coastal areas. However, the winter moth has started to appear at outbreak densities in locations where the autumnal moth was previously the sole outbreak species, probably due to climate change [1, 2] . Both species show cyclical population dynamics with regular density fluctuations at cycles of 9-11 years, although the highest seasonal density at any one location and year does not always also correspond to an outbreak density. Winter moth populations show a delayed synchrony, with density peaks lagging one or two years behind the peak densities of the autumnal moth [3] . The cyclic pattern is partly driven by hymenopteran parasitoids attacking larvae and pupae [4] . The major cause of mortality at outbreak densities seems to be starvation. However, occasionally diseased autumnal moth larvae have been observed at outbreak density locations, while no diseased winter moth larvae ",

The Abisko virus sequence was assembled from around 0.5 million end-paired ca. 100 nt sequences using the Trinity transcriptome assembly software [8], after filtering out low quality reads and removing the adapter sequences. The consensus sequence, coverage data, and variability profile were created using mpileup from Samtools v.0.1.8 (www.htslib.org, [9] ) and an in-house script. The assembled Illumina sequence was confirmed through chain-termination sequencing [10] of uncloned Reverse Transcription-PCR fragments produced by primers EaNV-F8005 and EaNV-B9465 (Supplementary Materials Table S1 ), spanning the major junctions of the genome (Figure 1 ). The 3 terminus was obtained by 3 RACE (Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends), through priming the natural poly-A tail of the virus with anchored oligo-dT (V[T] 16 ) for cDNA synthesis, followed by PCR with the EaNV-3RACE-F2 virus-specific forward primer (Supplementary Materials  Table S1 ), using the FirstChoice RLM-RACE Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The identity of the reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) fragments Viruses 2017, 9, 214 3 of 12 from the prevalence survey was also confirmed through sequencing. These PCR products were sequenced by Macrogen (Seoul, South Korea).",

For each sample, a no-template, a no-primer, and a no-reverse transcriptase reaction were included in its suite of cDNA reactions, as essential cDNA negative controls [11, 13] . Also included was a full suite of cDNA reactions for a virus-negative adult E. autumnata sample (25A), as a biological negative control. The cDNA reactions were incubated 60 min at 37 \u2022 C followed by 10 min at 70 \u2022 C.

The no-primer and no-RT cDNA reactions were amplified with an equimolar mix of tag primer and a pool of all virus-specific primers, so as to enable the amplification of all possible illegitimate products. All reactions were run in triplicate, on separate plates. The Melting Curve data was used to identify positive amplifications, after which the mean and standard deviation of the corresponding quantification cycle (Cq) values were calculated and converted to estimated copies of cDNA per reaction, \u00b1standard deviation, through external calibration curves established from 10-fold dilution series of the purified and quantified PCR products, covering four orders of magnitude dynamic range.

For each unique virus taxon identified by BLAST-P, a single accession (Supplementary Materials Table S2 ) was extracted for multiple amino acid sequence alignment using COBALT [14] . The phylogenetic relationships between the viruses were inferred from this alignment using the Maximum Likelihood method based on the JTT matrix-based model [15] , as implemented by MEGA6 [16] . All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated, resulting in 891 characters for analysis. Initial tree(s) for the heuristic search were obtained automatically by applying Neighbor-Join and BioNJ algorithms to a matrix of pairwise distances estimated using a JTT model, and then selecting the topology with superior log likelihood value. Statistical support for each node was determined by bootstrap analysis involving 1000 replicates [17] . The Abisko virus consensus sequence has been deposited at GenBank under accession KY662294.

The RNA and DNA from two of the most affected larvae were submitted to Illumina sequencing. These sequences were assembled and compared to the public databases, with particular emphasis on pathogen signatures. The analyses of the DNA phase identified a novel baculovirus at low abundance (to be described in a separate publication). Analysis of the RNA phase on the other hand revealed in one of the samples an overwhelming abundance of microbial sequences, with 88% of the reads belonging to a 0.8 kb contig with 91% amino acid identity to an Acinetobacter baumannii hypothetical protein (GenBank WP_071209019.1) and 7% of the reads to a single 10 kb RNA virus. Only 4% of the reads belonged to the E. autumnata transcriptome and the remaining reads were mostly of bacterial and fungal origin.

            "text": "The Abisko virus sequence comprises a single-stranded RNA genome of about 10 kb, with a natural 3' poly-A tail a relatively large (782 nt) 3 untranslated region (3 UTR), a short 5 UTR, and three major ORFs, separated by an intergenic region (IGR) of about 229 nt and a 3 nt stretch following the end of the putative coat protein (Figure 1 ). ORF-1 contains clear domain signatures for a Methyl Transferase (MTR), a cysteine-protease (ProC3), a helicase, and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase domains (RdRp). ORF-2 contains a coat protein (CP) while ORF-3 contains a 14 kDa protein with no clear homologues in the databases. The size and overall organization of the genome is most similar to that of the negeviruses, an insect-specific virus family [6, 7] . To confirm the integrity of the genome and its organization, a 1.5 kb fragment spanning ORF-1, the intergenic region, ORF-2 and ORF-3 was amplified and sequenced directly by Sanger sequencing, confirming all of the junctions and gaps. Usually with this type of genome organization, the second and third ORFs are either translated by an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) located in the intergenic region [24] or from a subgenomic RNA [25, 26] . No conserved sequence motifs for subgenomic promoters or IRES structures could be found in the Abisko genome. Indirect clues that Abisko virus may use a subgenomic RNA translation strategy are: (1) the highly elevated coverage for the 3 region of the genome; (2) the presence of a viral methyl transferase, responsible for producing CAP-like structures for stabilizing the 3 ends of viral (sub)genomic RNAs prior to translation through 'normal' ribosome AUG scanning; (3) most genera within the super-family to which Abisko virus and its close relatives belong tend to translate their 3 ORFs through subgenomic RNAs [25] (but see [27] ).",

            "text": "The infection status of Abiskovirus was assessed from evidence for negative-strand virus RNA and/or sub-genomic RNA in virus-positive samples. Both types of molecules are only produced during active infection and are therefore indicative that the virus is truly infectious in the host. However, only positive evidence for the presence of such molecules is informative, since these molecules are temporary infection intermediates and the infection process may already have passed the stage where such molecules are produced. The evidence was provided by four pairs of strand-specific RT-qPCR assays: two in the genomic region and two in the putative sub-genomic region (Figure 1 ; Supplementary Materials Table S1 ). Negative-strand Abisko virus RNA was detected by all four Viruses 2017, 9, 214 6 of 12 negative-strand assays in one of the four virus-positive E. autumnata adult samples (78A) and by three of the assays in another adult (86A), with assay neg2(g) just missing the detection threshold ( Figure 2 ). No evidence of negative-strand RNA was recovered from the other two adult samples (31A; 61A) or the diseased larval sample (7L), even though positive-strand RNA was detected in abundance. The average ratio of positive to negative strand RNA for all pairs of assays was around 275:1 and 100:1 for samples 78A and 86A respectively, which is normal for RNA viruses [28] . There was no evidence of significant amounts of subgenomic RNA in any of the samples, since the assays located in ORF-1 (genomic RNA only) detected the same amount of RNA as those located in ORF-2 and ORF-3 (genomic plus subgenomic RNA: Figure 2 ; [29] ). If Abisko virus indeed translates its ORFs through ribosome scanning, whether with or without subgenomic mRNAs, then the sequence context surrounding the AUG codon has a major role in deciding where translation is initiated [23] . This context is particularly important for ORF-3, which is downstream from ORF-2 with which it has to compete for translation initiation. The only ORF-3 AUG codon with a superior Kozak context than the putative start codon of ORF-2 is 91 nt downstream from the end of ORF-2 and without any product. The key positions of the Kozak sequence are at \u22123 (A/G), \u22121 (C/G), and +4 (G) relative to the AUG start codon [23] . The Kozak context of the nominal start of ORF-3 (UCU 8971 AUGUUA) is about as sub-optimal as can be and inferior to either of the possible ORF-2 start codons (UAA 8266 AUGCGC; AAU 8473 AUGACU), neither of which are particular optimal themselves. Therefore, unless ORF-3 is translated through a dedicated IRES hidden in the CP gene (e.g., [27] ), it may well be produced as a read-through product of ORF-2, through a leaky UAG stop codon. Such a strategy has plenty of precedence elsewhere in the virus world, particularly for coat proteins that thus acquire extensions with potentially useful functions for cell entry, infectivity, and host-range [26] .",

The Abiskovirus RdRp and coat protein (ORF-2), are also closely related to their homologues in the Virgaviridae, which will have contributed to the uncertainty of its phylogenetic placement within the negeviridae. This is in itself not particularly unusual: RNA viruses in particular are well capable of acquiring gene cassettes from a variety of different origins, including related viruses [30] and even hosts [31] .

Subsequent screening of an extensive set of natural samples revealed that the virus could not be detected in either larvae (except for the original transcriptome sample) or pupae of both E. autumnata and O. brumata, and that it could be detected in only four adult E. autumnata, collected from three different sites. The dispersed distribution, generous titers, and clear evidence for virus replicative-strand intermediates indicate that adult E. autumnata are a true host of the virus, while the absence of the virus or its replication intermediates from all pupae and all but one larva suggests that these are not hosts. Since the adults live only a few weeks, are not very mobile, and do not feed or defecate, the persistence of Abisko virus in the adult autumnal moth population is difficult to explain unless other transmission routes or hosts are involved. The genome organization and phylogenetic analyses identify Abisko virus most closely with the negeviruses, a newly described group of insect-infecting viruses [6, 7] , but with sufficient uncertainty to leave both its classification and primary hosts status in doubt. Consequently, we decided to conservatively name the virus after the place it was found (Abisko), following the convention used for its closest relatives, the negeviruses, but leave its classification otherwise unassigned.",
