The importance of the UPS in viral pathogenesis has become increasingly apparent. Using murine cardiomyocytes, we have previously demonstrated that the UPS plays a key role in the replication of coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), an important human pathogen associated with various diseases. To further elucidate the underlying mechanisms, we examined the interplay between the UPS and CVB3, focusing on the role of ubiquitination in viral lifecycle.",

There were no apparent changes in 20S proteasome activities following CVB3 infection. However, we found viral infection led to an accumulation of protein-ubiquitin conjugates, accompanied by a decreased protein expression of free ubiquitin, implicating an important role of ubiquitination in the UPS-mediated viral replication. Using small-interfering RNA, we demonstrated that gene-silencing of ubiquitin significantly reduced viral titers, possibly through downregulation of protein ubiquitination and subsequent alteration of protein function and/or degradation. Inhibition of deubiquitinating enzymes apparently enhances the inhibitory effects of proteasome inhibitors on CVB3 replication. Finally, by immunoprecipitation, we showed that coxsackieviral polymerase 3D was post-translationally modified by ubiquitination and such modification might be a prerequisite for its function in transcriptional regulation of viral genome.",

The ATPdependent system begins with covalent attachment of ubiquitin to the ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1). Then the ubiquitin is transferred to a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2). Finally, ubiquitin ligase (E3) transfers the ubiquitin to the substrate protein. After several cycles of ubiquitination, multiple ubiquitin molecules are attached to the substrate which is then quickly recognized and subsequently degraded by the 26S proteasome. Ubiquitin is recycled through the actions of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) [12, 13] . There are at least two classes of deubiquitinating enzymes, the ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases (UCHs) and ubiquitin-specific processing proteases family.",

To dissect out the role of ubiquitination and degradation in CVB3 infection, we next decided to investigate the protein ubiquitination after CVB3 infection. As shown in Fig. 2A , protein ubiquitination was gradually increased along the time-course of CVB3 infection, which was accompanied by a decrease of free ubiquitin levels. Densitometric analysis further demonstrated that the increases in protein ubiquitination at 3 h, 5 h, and 7 h post-infection were statistically significant as compared to sham infection (Fig. 2B) . We have previously demonstrated that 26S proteasome activities were unchanged during CVB3 infection [9] . Thus, the finding of increased accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins is likely due to enhanced protein ubiquitination as opposed to reduced proteasome activity. Decreased levels of free ubiquitin could be a direct consequence of the increased protein ubiquitination. These results suggest that enhanced ubiquitin conjugation may be a prerequisite for efficient synthesis of CVB3 viral RNA and continuation of its lifecycle.",

To investigate whether protein ubiquitination is beneficial to CVB3 replication in HeLa cells, we used the ubiquitin-specific siRNA to gene-silence the expression of human ubiquitin-CEP Uba80, which codes for ubiquitin fused to ribosomal protein S27a [29] . As shown in Fig. 3A , both ubiquitin conjugates and free ubiquitin levels were markedly knocked down after the treatment of ubiquitin siRNA.

To further explore the role of protein ubiquitination in viral replication, we examined the influence of DUB inhibition on viral protein expression. Two commercially available ubiquitin cterminal hydrolase inhibitors, UCH L1 and UCH L3 inhibitors, were used for this study. As shown in Fig. 4 , specific inhibition of UCH L1 or UCH L3 further reduced CVB3 protein expression and virus titers in proteasome inhibitor-treated cells, suggesting that these enzymes may be involved in the lifecycle of CVB3. Nevertheless, it was found that inhibition of the UCH L1 and L3 activities alone was not sufficient to block coxsackievirus replication since no significant changes in viral protein expression and CVB3 titers were observed in cells treated with two UCH inhibitors either separately or in combination (Fig. 4) . As discussed earlier, stabilization of short-lived host proteins and prevention of protein ubiquitination by reducing recycled ubiquitin likely contribute to the inhibitory effect of proteasome inhibition on viral replication. Thus, it is speculated that DUB inhibition by UCHL1/L3 inhibitors alone, in the absence of apparent inhibition of protein degradation, is not sufficient enough to block viral replication. However, additional reduction of recycled free ubiquitin by DUB inhibition can further enhance the inhibitory effect of proteasome inhibitor.",

To examine whether coxsackieviral proteins are subjected to ubiquitination during viral infection, we performed immunoprecipitation with anti-ubiquitin antibody, followed by immunoblots using antibodies against 3D pol and viral capsid protein VP1, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5 , immunoreactive bands of around 60 kDa were detected in CVB3infected cells. Non-modified 3D pol has a molecular weight of about 53 kDa, thus this observation suggests that 3D pol likely undergoes post-translational modification by monoubiquitination. No protein ubiquitination was observed for VP1 (data not shown).

CVB3 infection results in increased protein polyubiquitination and a subsequent decrease in free ubiquitin levels. Knockdown of ubiquitin and ubiquitinmediated protein modification and/or degradation by siRNA It is increasingly apparent that viruses can evolve various strategies to utilize the host UPS for their own benefits. The UPS has been suggested to play a critical role in the different steps of viral lifecycle, including viral entry, viral replication, maturation, viral progeny release, and latent virus reactivation [32] [33] [34] . The mechanisms that the UPS regulates viral infection involve degrading intracellular proteins or excessive viral proteins that are against efficient viral replication and modulating viral protein function through ubiquitin-mediated modification or by directly encoding ubiquitin-related enzymes [35] . The finding in this study that CVB3 infection stimulates protein ubiquitination without inhibition of the core 20S proteasome activity highlights the possibility that CVB3 manipulates the UPS to destabilize or modulate the host and viral proteins. Polyubiquitination and degradation of host antiviral proteins has been suggested to be a mechanism of HIV-1 replication [36] . We have previously identified several proteins, such as cyclin D1, p53 and b-catenin, which are downregulated through the UPS after CVB3 infection [7, 9] . Destabilization of these short-lived host proteins is likely required for CVB3 viral RNA and protein synthesis in its lifecycle. Moreover, it is speculated that nonstructural viral proteins of CVB3 could also be potential targets of the UPS for degradation. Previous studies on picornavirus have shown that several viral proteins, such as encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) 3C protease and hepatitis A virus (HAV) 3C protease, are ubiquitinated and present in low concentrations in infected cells [37] [38] [39] . Several E3 ubiquitin ligases, such as human E3a ubiquitin ligase, have been shown to catalyze the ubiquitination of these viral proteins [38, 39] . Although the exact role of ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of nonstructural viral proteins of EMCV and HAV in infected cells remains elusive, such rapid turnover may be required for efficient viral RNA replication, viral protein synthesis and virus maturation.",

It was reported that monoubiquitination of the Gag protein of retroviruses is required for virus budding [22, 24, 25] . Depletion of free ubiquitin by proteasome inhibitors prevents Gag ubiquitination, subsequently blocks virus progeny release/budding. In addition, ubiquitination of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Tat protein and human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 Tax protein has been shown to modulate their transactivation activities [20, 23] . We speculate that monoubiquitination is also an important machinery for post-translational modification and activation of CVB3 viral proteins. In the current study, we have shown that CVB3 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 3D is posttranslationally modified by ubiquitination, suggesting a critical role of protein ubiquitination in the regulation of viral protein functions.",

Coxsackievirus infection facilitates host protein polyubiquitination, which subsequently increases intracellular protein degradation by the proteasome and/or viral protein modification, such as 3D pol , by monoubiquitination. Degradation of host antiviral proteins provides a favorable environment for virus to achieve successful replication. Knockdown of ubiquitin decreases host protein degradation and viral protein ubiquitination. Proteasome inhibition blocks host protein degradation and viral protein ubiquitination by reducing recycled ubiquitin. DUB inhibitors further decreases the viral replication when used together with proteasome inhibitors through the additional reduction of recycled free ubiquitin.",
