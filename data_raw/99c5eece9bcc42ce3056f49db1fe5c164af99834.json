A country's ability to robustly detect ZIKV introduction and local transmission is important to minimise the risk for a ZIKV outbreak. Therefore, sufficient expertise and diagnostic capacity and capability are required in European laboratories. To assess the capacity, quality, operational specifics (guidelines and algorithms), technical and interpretation issues and other possible difficulties that were related to ZIKV diagnostics in European countries, a questionnaire was conducted among national reference laboratories in 30 countries in the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) in May 2016. While the coverage and capacity of ZIKV diagnostics in the EU/EEA national reference laboratories were found to be adequate, the assessment of the quality and needs indicated several crucial points of improvement that will need support at national and EU/EEA level to improve ZIKV preparedness, response and EU/EEA ZIKV surveillance activities.

The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the cluster of microcephaly cases and other neurological disorders possibly associated with ZIKV a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on 1 February 2016 [3] . By the end of 2016, the unprecedented ZIKV outbreak affected 48 countries and territories in the Americas with more than half a million human cases [4] . The PHEIC was declared over on 18 November 2016 with the argument that ZIKVassociated congenital syndrome was considered to be a long-term public health challenge requiring a longterm commitment to control and prevent [4, 5] .",

Its genome can be detected in biological samples by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and the virus can be isolated in cell culture. However, viraemia is typically short-lived (3-7 days after onset of symptoms) [6] [7] [8] , although an increased window of detection has been observed using urine (up to 20 days after onset of symptoms) [8] or whole blood (up to 100 days after onset of symptoms) [9] . Consequently, the full spectrum of diagnostics includes serology, which is complex owing to extensive cross-reactivity with antibodies triggered by other flaviviral infections and/or vaccination [10] . The majority of ZIKV infections are asymptomatic which complicates retracing the course of infection and increases the dependency on serology to confirm an infection [10] . This is in particular an issue for pregnant women for whom correct diagnosis of a ZIKV infection, even if asymptomatic, is imperative [2, 11, 12] .",

All laboratories conducting ZIKV serology indicated that they had experience with serodiagnostics for at least one other flavivirus. In addition, insight in the specificity and sensitivity of the serology tests used is required for proper test interpretation, but this appeared limited at the time of the questionnaire because adequate validation panels were lacking. Validation data provided by commercial entities typically need to be confirmed in order to be acceptable for an accreditation scheme [27] . Similarly, validation of such assays performed in another laboratory may be insufficient to meet with accreditation requirements. Indeed, the availability of validation panels for serology was indicated as the biggest challenge for implementation of ZIKV diagnostics by 21 of 44 ZIKV diagnostic laboratories. Five of the ZIKV diagnostic laboratories did not have any kind of ISO accreditation, while 17 of 44 laboratories did not have the most relevant ISO 15189 accreditation [27] . Another concern is the broad reliance for ZIKV serology on one or two commercial tests, although it should be noted that in May 2016, the commercial market for ZIKV serology offered very limited options. In December 2016, no commercial serology test had been accepted for procurement through the WHO Emergency Use Assessment and Listing procedure, which requires extensive validation [33] . This illustrates the importance of reference laboratory capacity. Virus neutralisation is still considered the most specific flavivirus serology test, although cross-reactivity can be observed in patients with other flavivirus infections and research is ongoing to develop more specific assays [10, 31, 32, 34] . Broad implementation of this confirmatory test in EU/EEA national reference laboratories is, however, expected to increase the reliability of serology results in returning travellers as the flavivirus background (in particular dengue) in European travellers is likely to be low.",

[25] ) of the two in-house tests that were most frequently used, was recommended based on in silico analysis [10] and in an independent comparative study of ZIKV molecular tests [35] , raising possible concerns about the performance of diagnostics in some laboratories. In November 2016, the ECDC-funded emerging viral disease laboratory expert network (EVD-LabNet [36] ) organised an external quality assessment (EQA) for member laboratories which included the majority of the national reference laboratories with ZIKV diagnostics that participated in this questionnaire.

The availability of validation materials, positive controls and personnel were indicated as the main challenges for implementation of ZIKV diagnostics in the reference laboratories of the 30 EU/EEA countries. That 15 of 44 laboratories indicated the cost of commercial tests as an obstacle for test implementation and the large dependency of the laboratories on commercial assays, while five of 44 laboratories did not receive funding for development and/or implementation of in-house tests, illustrate an Achilles' heel in the preparedness for emerging infections and needs careful consideration when defining strategies to strengthen laboratory preparedness and response for future outbreak situations.",
