The separated fraction whose peak area 4 exceeded 2% of that of N-5 was assumed to be significant. The significant signals are labelled by the 5 fraction numbers (88 species in total; see Fig. 3 , Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1 and S2). In 6 some chromatograms, multiple significant peaks were detected; these products are sub-numbered with 7 reference to their elution times. 8 9 Supplementary Figure S2. LC-ESI-MS and MS 2 spectra of 88 strial glycans. 10 Upper panels illustrate full-scan LC-ESI-MS spectra (m/z range 500-2000) of 88 glycan fractions 11 obtained by three different HPLCs (see Fig. 3). Retention times (RT) of the analysed glycans in the 12 liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry are also shown. The m/z values of the fractions 13 subjected to MS 2 analyses are presented above the peaks. Lower panels display MS 2 spectra of the 14 parent fractions. All the major peaks in the LC-ESI-MS and MS 2 spectra were annotated with the 15 corresponding fragments. As for N-11-2 and N-14-1, the molecular mass predicted from the signals of 16 the size fractionation HPLC could not be accounted for by the MS data. Therefore, these two fractions were no longer analysed in MS 2 mode.

In the A3-15-2 fraction, two sialyl linkage isomers were 11 identified; the same was true for fraction A3-15-3; the glycans were sub-numbered with reference to 12 their m/z values (see inset in A3-15 spectrum). 13 14 Supplementary Figure S4.
