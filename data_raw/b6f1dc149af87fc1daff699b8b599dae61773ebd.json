However, diarrhoeal diseases were the leading cause of death in Somalia (186\u00b77 deaths per 100 000 people) in 2013, which decreased by 26\u00b79% since 1990. The leading cause of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) was ischaemic heart disease for males and lower respiratory infection for females. High blood pressure was the leading risk factor for DALYs in 2013, with an increase of 83\u00b73% since 1990. Risk factors for DALYs varied by country. In low-income countries, childhood wasting was the leading cause of DALYs in Afghanistan, Somalia, and Yemen, whereas unsafe sex was the leading cause in Djibouti. Non-communicable risk factors were the leading cause of DALYs in high-income and middle-income countries in the region. DALY risk factors varied by age, with child and maternal malnutrition affecting the younger age groups (aged 28 days to 4 years), whereas high bodyweight This is an Open Access article under the CC BY license. and systolic blood pressure affected older people (aged 60-80 years). The proportion of DALYs attributed to high body-mass index increased from 3\u00b77% to 7\u00b75% between 1990 and 2013. Burden of mental health problems and drug use increased. Most increases in DALYs, especially from noncommunicable diseases, were due to population growth. The crises in Egypt, Yemen, Libya, and Syria have resulted in a reduction in life expectancy; life expectancy in Syria would have been 5 years higher than that recorded for females and 6 years higher for males had the crisis not occurred.",

A list of all datapoints used in this study are available on our Global Health Data Exchange web page. When data were unavailable, we relied on our ensemble modelling techniques to generate the estimates using other available variables and the information for neighbouring countries or countries with a similar health profile in the region. We used six different modelling strategies for the 240 causes of death using our cause-of-death ensemble model for causes with sufficient information. We estimated national time series from 1950 to 2013 for gross domestic product, educational attainment, tobacco prevalence, and obesity. For mortality rates of children younger than 5 years, we analysed all survey, census, sample registration, and vital registration sources. Wherever possible, we analysed microdata from surveys and censuses with updated methods for child mortality. We corrected for bias in different sources in specific countries. For adult mortality, we identified all available vital registration data, sibling history survey data, sample registration data, and household recall of deaths. We assessed vital registration data for completeness and analysed sibling history data to account for survivor bias, zero-surviving sibships, and recall bias. We used spatiotemporal regression and Gaussian process regression to synthesise all measurements of mortality. We used UN population estimates that account for migration in our analyses. Moreover, we applied mortality shocks based on multiple reports to our analyses.",

We used the exposure level that minimises risk for the population, termed the theoretical minimum risk exposure level. We avoided double counting in the presentation of overall results by computing the overlap for joint risk distributions: behavioural risks alone; environmental or occupational risks alone; metabolic risks alone; behavioural and environmental or occupational risks together; behavioural and metabolic risks together; environmental or occupational and metabolic risks together; and behavioural, environmental or occupational, and metabolic risks together.",

            "text": "The leading cause of death in the eastern Mediterranean region in 2013 was ischaemic heart disease (90\u00b73 deaths per 100 000 people). 8 It surpassed both diarrhoeal diseases and lower respiratory infections as the leading cause of death in 1990, increasing by 17\u00b72%. There was a shift in main causes of death from communicable to non-communicable diseases in the region. Causes of death and their rates of change varied by country. 8 For example, diarrhoeal disease was the leading cause of death in Somalia and accounted for 186\u00b77 deaths per 100 000 people in 2013, a decrease of 26\u00b79% from 1990. 9 All countries observed an increase in life expectancy and healthy life expectancy since 1990, although at different rates (appendix pp 7-8). Afghanistan had the lowest life expectancy and healthy life expectancy (56\u00b75 years vs 49\u00b70 years for men, 56\u00b70 years vs 48\u00b78 years for women, respectively), whereas Qatar had the highest (81\u00b72 years vs 69\u00b72 years for men, 83\u00b71 years vs 69\u00b75 years for women, respectively). Lebanon had a higher increase in healthy life expectancy than life expectancy. Global life expectancy for both sexes increased from 65\u00b73 years in 1990, to 71\u00b75 years in 2013. 4 There was a change in causes of years of life lost (YLLs) from 1990 to 2013 in all countries (appendix p 9). Overall, regional YLLs decreased from 45 312 years per 100 000 people in 1990 to about 24 160 years per 100 000 people in 2013. 8 Cardiovascular diseases, neoplasms, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and transport injuries increased, especially in high-income and middle-income countries in the region, whereas neonatal disorders, diarrhoeal diseases, and lower respiratory infections decreased. HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis were large contributors to YLLs in 2013 in Djibouti. War was a large contributor to YLLs in Syria in 2013 (38\u00b71% of total YLLs). 8 Overall, regional years lived with disability (YLDs) increased from 9526 years per 100 000 people in 1990 to about 10057 years per 100 000 people in 2013. 8 Musculoskeletal disorders and mental disorders and substance abuse were major contributors to YLDs in 2013 and had the highest increase (appendix p 10). Nutritional deficiencies (mainly iron-deficiency anaemia) decreased in the region overall, but remained a large burden in low-income countries. For example, nutritional deficiencies remained one of the leading causes of YLDs in Yemen although the YLDs per 100 000 people decreased slightly by 2% from 1990. 8 Overall, regional DALYs decreased from 54 838 years per 100 000 people in 1990 to about 34 217 years per 100 000 people in 2013. DALYs vary disproportionately by age and sex. Children younger than 5 years contributed to about 33% of total DALYs with a rate of 94 884 years per 100 000 people, compared with 34 217 years per 100 000 people for the general population. 8 Ischaemic heart disease was the leading cause of DALYs in the region in 2013 in males and when data for both sexes were combined, whereas diarrhoeal diseases were the leading cause in 1990 (table 1) . Lower respiratory infection was the leading cause of DALYs for females. Causes of DALYs varied by income; lower respiratory infection was the leading cause of DALYs in low-income countries (appendix p 15), ischaemic heart disease in middle-income countries (appendix p 16), and road injuries in high-income countries (appendix p 17). Causes of DALYs and their change from 1990 by country varied widely (appendix p 11). Causes of DALYs varied by age. For example, DALYs for mental health peaked in early adulthood and declined with age, whereas DALYs for cardiovascular diseases and neoplasms increased with age (appendix p 1). Different patterns of DALYs were observed in different income levels (appendix pp [12] [13] [14] .",

DALYs caused by non-communicable diseases and injuries increased (mainly because of population growth), whereas DALYs caused by communicable diseases decreased, although the actual rates of DALYs decreased for all risk factors (table  3) . Conversely, a steady decrease in life expectancy was observed in Syria because of the continuing war. Therefore, between 1990 and 2013 life expectancy for Syria would have been 6 years higher than observed for males and 5 years higher for females had the crisis not happened. Moreover, our analyses showed that several countries in the region have experienced a slow-down in lowering infant mortality rate. For example, in Syria the annualised rate of reduction in infant mortality between 2010 to 2013 was -9\u00b71%, in sharp contrast with the rate of decrease of 6\u00b70% before 2010. 9",

Moreover, wars and unrest in Afghanistan, Iraq, Palestine, and Somalia have continued or re-emerged, and for many people in these countries, survival is the main challenge, not health. The eastern Mediterranean region is facing several health challenges at a time of uncertainty, and the countries in this region are struggling to meet these challenges.",

These challenges will have a major impact on health outcomes and available resources. The region has historically seen improvements in life expectancy and other health indicators even under stress. However, according to our study, the current situation has resulted in deteriorating health conditions for many countries that are threatening these gains and will have an impact on the region and the rest of the world. On the basis of our data, we call for increased investment in health in the region and the end of ongoing conflicts.

However, Egypt, Tunisia, and Yemen have lost about 0\u00b725 years of life expectancy due to the uprising that began in 2010. When comparing observed life expectancy to expected life expectancy if no crisis had occurred, we found a large decrease in life expectancy in Libya of more than 9 years for males and 6 years for females.",
