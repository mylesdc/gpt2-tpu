The virus-host interactions that governed development of these acute end stage lung diseases and death are unknown. To address this question, we evaluated the role of innate immune signaling in protection from human (Urbani) and a recombinant mouse adapted SARS-CoV, designated rMA15. In contrast to most models of viral pathogenesis, infection of type I, type II or type III interferon knockout mice (129 background) with either Urbani or MA15 viruses resulted in clinical disease outcomes, including transient weight loss, denuding bronchiolitis and alveolar inflammation and recovery, identical to that seen in infection of wildtype mice. This suggests that type I, II and III interferon signaling play minor roles in regulating SARS pathogenesis in mouse models. In contrast, infection of STAT12/2 mice resulted in severe disease, high virus titer, extensive pulmonary lesions and 100% mortality by day 9 and 30 post-infection with rMA15 or Urbani viruses, respectively. Non-lethal in BALB/c mice, Urbani SARS-CoV infection in STAT12/2 mice caused disseminated infection involving the liver, spleen and other tissues after day 9. These findings demonstrated that SARS-CoV pathogenesis is regulated by a STAT1 dependent but type I, II and III interferon receptor independent, mechanism. In contrast to a well documented role in innate immunity, we propose that STAT1 also protects mice via its role as an antagonist of unrestrained cell proliferation.

On initial isolation of SARS-CoV from infected patients, it was identified as a novel Group 2 Coronavirus and the genetic mechanisms governing the increased pathogenicity of the virus remain undefined [1, 2] . In severe cases, SARS-CoV infection rapidly progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) during the acute phase of infection or to an organizing phase diffuse alveolar damage following virus clearance; two clinically devastating end stage lung diseases. The molecular mechanisms governing these severe end stage lung disease outcomes are unknown, although similar pathologies have been reported following H5N1 and 1918 influenza virus infection.",

IFN induced from either infected cells or dendritic cells can activate an antiviral state in neighboring cells to signal that a viral infection is under way [5] .

            "text": "Given the importance of the IFN system in regulating virus growth, many highly pathogenic viruses encode proteins that antagonize components of the innate immune system. The Ebola virus encodes VP35 which blocks STAT1 signaling [13, 14] , influenza NS1 blocks IRF3 activation [15, 16] and V proteins from the Nipah and Hendra viruses induce STAT1 degradation [17] . Several IFN antagonist genes are encoded in the SARS-CoV genome and target IFN sensing and signaling and NFKB induction [18] [19] [20] [21] . However, the role of IFN in regulating SARS-CoV pathogenesis in vivo is less clear. From microarray studies using RNA from PBMC's for 50 SARS patients, Cameron et. al. observed a robust type I IFN response early in the disease and predicted that it was essential for viral clearance and clinical recovery [22] . In addition to a strong IFN response, genes such as CCL2 (MCP-1) and CXCL10 (IP-10) that are typically induced by IFN were also up-regulated in patients at early times in SARS-CoV disease. Interestingly, Cameron and colleagues suggested that the IFN response that served to protect recovered SARS patients could become a dysregulated cytokine storm in severe cases and contribute to increased disease and a suboptimal adaptive immune response. The innate immune response to SARS-CoV also changes with age of the host; 12 month old BALB/c mice respond to SARS-CoV with an exacerbated and faster innate immune induction than 6 to 8 week old mice, potentially explaining their increased susceptibility and lung pathology following infection [23, 24] .",

Specifically, we tested the role of type I, type II, and type III IFN and STAT1 in protection from SARS-CoV infection. We have found that absence of the IFN a/b, IFNc and IFNl, receptors alone or in some instances together, had a limited impact on pathogenicity and clearance of the non-lethal and lethal strains of SARS-CoV in mice. However, STAT1 deficient mice show increased susceptibility, prolonged virus shedding and mortality following infection with either virus. Importantly, STAT12/2 animals developed an organizing phase DAD, similar to lesions noted in severe late stage human cases of SARS. Our data reveals a new mechanistic pathway by which STAT1 regulates the severity of viral pathogenesis in the lung. We show that SARS-CoV pathogenesis is STAT1 dependent but independent of type I, II and III IFN signaling, and we provide evidence consistent with an essential role for STAT1 in the control of SARS-CoV replication, cell proliferation, wound repair and progression to severe organizing phase DAD and lethal disease.",

During the epidemic ,10% of those infected died and the elderly were particularly vulnerable. Severe cases developed acute lung injury with pulmonary fibrosis and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Little is known about the molecular mechanisms governing its virus pathogenesis and high lethality. Using a mouse model of infection with the epidemic strain of SARS-CoV (Urbani) as well as a recombinant mouse adapted strain of SARS-CoV (rMA15), we showed that a protein normally associated with the innate immune response, STAT1, plays an important role in the development of severe end stage lung injury. However, the lack of a normal innate immune type I, type II and type III interferon response did not enhance virus pathogenesis. Our work suggests that STAT1 may play a key role in development of acute lung injury and other chronic lung pathology, most likely by affecting cell proliferation and wound repair pathways.",

By day 5 post-infection, lung lesions were more severe in STAT12/2 mice, consistent with persistently high virus titers ( Figure 2 ). Two features were notable; first, the extent of inflammation was more severe in STAT12/2 mice, with a much greater number of macrophages infiltrating into all areas of the lung, a finding that was not seen in the other mouse strains. Second, thickening of the alveolar septa was seen throughout the lungs with perivascular and peribronchial thickening. By 9 days post-infection, the inflammation continued to increase in STAT12/2 mice while lung inflammation was subsiding in 129 WT, IFNAR12/2 and IFNGR2/2 infected mice. In STAT12/2 mice, inflammation was pervasive throughout the lungs with densely packed infiltrating cells especially prominent throughout the periphery of the tissue. Macrophages continued to infiltrate with the majority residing in the alveolar interstitium. Interestingly, large foci containing densely packed fibroblasts, macrophages and lymphocytes were seen throughout the lungs and scattered atypical large cells were found throughout the foci. A focal mixed inflammatory infiltrate was found with extensive fibrin deposition. Pleuritis signified by a breakdown of the pleura was seen in most samples as well. This pathology was consistent with proliferative and organizing phase diffuse alveolar damage (DAD). It is noteworthy that similar pathologic lesions were seen in many fatal SARS cases [31] [32] [33] [34] .",

Edema was observed around peribronchiolar blood vessels and the larger inflammatory cell infiltrate contained many lymphocytes, and neutrophils with a few eosinophils and macrophages. Abundant viral antigen was seen in bronchiolar epithelium (data not shown). By day 5, the bronchiolar epithelium had foci of regeneration with little necrosis and the peribronchiolar and perivascular inflammation was less severe than at day 3. Plugs of cellular debris and fibrin filled some bronchioles. A blue tinge was noted in the perivascular edema fluid, suggesting early collagen deposition. Viral antigen was much less common in the epithelium but was abundant in the cellular debris in the airways. At day 9, inflammatory cells increased around residual inflammatory lesions, with abundant neutrophils and more macrophages in the lesions. Marked epithelial hyperplasia was also seen in these foci. Bronchiolitis obliterans was seen in a few airways and interstitial lesions developed around some airway lesions, one of which extended to the pleura and producing focal pleuritis. Much of the lung parenchyma was, however, histologically normal. Only a few cells or cell debris was seen expressing viral antigen. By day 15, a fibrinous pleuritis with pyogranulomatous lesions developed in 2 of 3 mice, with focal resolving parenchymal lesions including a few foci of chronic interstitial pneumonia but most of the lung parenchyma remained fairly normal. From day 15-24, a fibrinous peritonitis ( Figure S2A ), pleuritis and pyogranulomatous lesions in spleen, liver and omentum developed as the major lesions that likely contributed to illness and death in the STAT12/2 mice ( Figure S2B -F). These lesions were characterized by a central area of necrosis with numerous neutrophils and an outer zone of macrophages. Viral antigen was found in some of the macrophages in these pyogranulomatous lesions ( Figure S2D , E). Plasma cells became abundant in the splenic lesions by day 24 ( Figure  S2G ). Abundant fibrosis (detected by Masson's trichrome stain) was seen in the splenic and liver lesions at day 24 ( Figure S2F ). The lungs of mice from days 15-24 were mostly normal with areas of residual chronic inflammation and a few pyogranulomas, some of which contained viral antigen.

In situ hybridization was performed on lungs from 129 WT, IFNAR12/2, IFNGR2/2 and STAT12/2 mice harvested at days 2, 5, and 9 post-infection. In all 4 strains of mice, the probe signal was predominantly localized in the airway epithelial cells at day 2 post-infection ( Figure 3A ). This correlated with the pathologic lesions in airway epithelial cells at day 2 postinfection. By day 5 post-infection, viral RNA was virtually eliminated from the control 129, and IFNAR12/2 mice and to a slightly lesser extent in IFNGR2/2 mice. Occasionally, a few cells with viral RNA were noted in the periphery, consistent with the low titers of virus in these animals at day 5. By day 9, there was no viral RNA signal found in the lungs of 129 WT, IFNAR12/2 and IFNGR2/2 mice, corresponding to the lack of viral replication at this time point. In contrast, lungs of STAT12/2 mice showed significant viral RNA signal throughout the lungs, including prominent distribution into the periphery of the lung at early and late times post-infection. Surprisingly, but consistent with the findings on histopathology, viral RNA signal was lost from the airway epithelial cells in the bronchioles by day 9 in STAT12/2 mice and was found throughout the periphery of the lungs, prominently focused in large focal compactions of cells. These foci correspond to the prominent focal lesions noted in H&E stained sections of the lung, which are predominantly composed of fibroblasts, macrophages and lymphocytes ( Figure 3B ). Interestingly, cellular debris can be seen in these foci that may represent lysed airway epithelial cells.",

IFNL is minimally but significantly upregulated during infection in WT 129 mice at day 2 post infection which decreases through the course of 9 days post infection ( Figure 5A ). The receptor for IFNL is a heterodimer of IL10Rb and IL28Ra. IL28Ra2/2 mice have been generated on the BALB/c mouse background but not on the 129 WT mouse background. Thus, although direct comparison with the other mouse strains is not possible, experiments with SARS-CoV in these mice are still informative. As in the C57B6 background, the Urbani virus does not cause disease or weight loss but the virus replicates in the lungs of BALB/c mice. Virus reaches peak titer by day 2 post-infection and infection is resolved by day 7 [36] . In contrast, rMA15 virus infection of BALB/c mice causes death by day 4 or 5 post-infection [30] . We hypothesized that if IFNL was important for protection from SARS-CoV infection, the virus would be more virulent in mice lacking the IFNL receptor and IFNL receptor knockout mice would show evidence of disease while normal BALB/c mice would not. Further, rMA15 virus infection of IL28Ra2/2 mice may result in enhanced pathology with more weight loss, higher virus titer, or increased lung pathology.",

To analyze the effects of knocking out both Types I and III IFN signaling pathways, we treated IFNAR12/2 mice (on the 129 background) with neutralizing antibodies to IL28Ra, the receptor used by IFNl. Mice were injected with 100 mg of anti-IL28Ra antibody at days -1, 1, 3, 5 and 7 days post-infection as described in the literature [37] . We found no difference in weight loss or pathogenesis of rMA15 in these mice compared to mice injected with PBS ( Figure 6 ). Mice showed 15% weight loss by day 4 postinfection but recovered by day 9, ending at their starting weight. Lungs were analyzed at days 2, 4 and 9 post-infection and showed no difference in pathology compared to IFNAR12/2 mice (data not shown). Both groups of mice showed epithelial cell denudation at 2 day post-infection and repair and clearance by day 9. Virus titers were only slightly increased over PBS injected mice but the difference was not statistically significant. This suggests that the inhibition of both Type I and Type III signaling in mice does not increase the pathogenesis of the rMA15 virus and neither protect 129 mice from disease.",

            "text": "SARS-CoV infection in humans rapidly progressed from an atypical pneumonia, to acute phase diffuse alveolar damage and ARDS during the first 10 days of acute lung injury. In many patients this is followed by the development of an organizing phase DAD after virus clearance. Both pathologies were associated with severe clinical outcomes and death, especially prominent in the elderly. The molecular mechanisms and virus-host signaling networks that regulate these progressive end stage lung diseases are unknown but are of considerable importance, given the global disease burden associated with them. Previous studies in our laboratory have demonstrated that aged mice infected with recombinant viruses encoding S glycoproteins from early phase or zoonotic SARS-CoV strains developed ARDS, characterized by hyaline membranes and DAD. In this report, we show that STAT1 deficient mice are especially prone to the development of organizing phase DAD. The innate immune system plays a central role in regulating early host responses to virus infection and promoting adaptive immune responses. The Type I, II and III IFNs are typically produced by different cell populations and use distinct membrane bound receptors to gain entry into cells; Type I uses IFNAR1, Type II uses IFNGR and Type III uses IL28Ra/IL10Rb. However, all three share a common cytoplasmic signaling protein, called STAT1, that is translocated to the nucleus and induces expression of multiple, overlapping IFN regulated genes (ISGs) [38] . Deletion of any or all of the signaling components involved in the STAT1 signaling pathway diminishes the innate immune response to pathogens and increases susceptibility to several bacterial and viral agents. Mice lacking IFN receptors show increased susceptibility to West Nile [9] , influenza [12, 39] , Ebola [11] , Friend virus [40] , RSV [7, 8] and Poliovirus [41] (reviewed in [42] ). Moreover, the same phenotypes are noted in STAT1 2/2 mice, demonstrating a key role of the entire innate immune pathway in regulating disease severity, viral titers, and pathology [10] . In stark contrast, we demonstrate the paradoxical finding that SARS-CoV Urbani and rMA15 viruses induce severe end stage lung disease by a STAT1 dependent mechanism that is independent of IFN receptor type I, II and III signaling. The data point to a novel mechanism by which STAT1 function regulates disease severity in the lung following SARS-CoV induced acute lung injury.",

These results suggest a novel mechanism of STAT1 regulation of severe end stage lung disease following SARS-CoV infection that is independent of it's roles in IFN signaling and ISG expression. Although it is possible that cooperative combinations of several IFNs (IFNa/b, IFNc, IFNl) that signal through STAT1 are required to regulate SARS-CoV infection, we feel that the possibility exists that STAT1's role in controlling cell proliferation and wound healing may be the base cause of the increased disease seen in STAT12/2 mice. Nevertheless, the development of triple knockouts affecting all 3 IFN receptors would address this mechanistic possibility.",

Less well appreciated in viral pathogenesis studies, STAT1 also plays key roles in cell cycle arrest and cell proliferation [43] [44] [45] . Thus, STAT1 defects may augment viral lung disease by several potential mechanisms. STAT1 was shown to be an important controller of tumor formation in several types of cancers including lung, colon, pancreatic and brain cancers [46] [47] [48] and its role in cell proliferation has been studied in the context of pulmonary fibrosis [43] . STAT12/2 mouse fibroblasts showed increased proliferation when exposed to growth factors compared to WT mouse fibroblasts. Additionally, STAT12/2 mice demonstrated a greater susceptibility to chemically induced pulmonary fibrosis via bleomycin treatment. These data suggested that outside of the innate immune response, STAT1 may function as a key regulator of cell proliferation and of the wound healing response [49] . Our data also suggest that STAT1 may regulate the wound healing response following acute lung injury associated with viral infection, similar to its cell cycle regulation seen in other models of disease.",

This suggests that in infected cells, the multiple pathways that inhibit IFN signaling may create essentially a STAT2/2 environment which may contribute to the further pathology seen during disease. As has been described with influenza, it is likely that a cytokine storm significantly contributes to increased pathogenic outcomes by targeting non-infected cells.

            "text": "The molecular mechanisms governing SARS-CoV pathogenesis have only recently begun to be evaluated using mice with targeted genetic defects challenged with the rMA15 virus. Sheahan et. al. identified a role for Myd88, an adapter protein of TLR signaling, and RAG1, necessary for antibody production, in protection from infection and disease. Myd88 2/2 mice showed an enhanced susceptibility to rMA15 virus infection in C57/B6 mice [26] and RAG12/2 mice showed no increased morbidity and mortality from rMA15 virus infection, viral replication in the lungs was detectable through 28 days post-infection [26] . These data suggest that an intricate balance between the innate and adaptive immune response is necessary for protection from SARS-CoV infection. We are currently working on understanding how these two processes interact in the host. Using proteomic and microarray analyses Cameron et al [22] showed that individuals who survived SARS-CoV infection had controlled innate immune, ISG and cytokine responses while individuals who progressed to severe disease demonstrated an uncontrolled innate immune response, with high levels of ISG and immunoglobulin expression, increased cytokine responses and poor antibody responses to the spike protein. The cause of this lack of regulation is not understood.",

Thus, it seems likely that the mouse adapted mutations in rMA15 enhanced the intrinsic pathogenic properties of SARS-CoV to produce severe end stage lung disease in the mice. However, SARS-CoV Urbani spreads from the respiratory tract into the spleen and liver of STAT12/2 mice. This suggests that although the damage may have been induced by viral infection, the pathology results from the host's response to the infection, though it is not clear whether this represents a normal pattern of spread or whether mutations have evolved in the virus that promote spread and distribution to other organs. Similar findings were seen in autopsy samples from individuals who died from SARS. Airways were intact and regenerated while acute cases showed spread to the outer pulmonary parenchyma [52] .",

Recent work has shown that in cells from aged hosts, STAT1 signaling cascades are less responsive to stimuli; STAT1 signaling in aged macrophages were hypo-responsive to IFNc [49] . As observed in our study, IFNc expression increases substantially in STAT12/2 mice. We hypothesize that this may be in response to a lack of negative feedback via the STAT1 signaling pathway. During the SARS epidemic, aged individuals were the cohort with most severe disease and highest mortality rates [53] .

We hypothesize that the increased susceptibility of STAT12/2 mice results from different roles of STAT1 in the cell. First, loss of STAT1 results in a deficient IFN response that results in higher titers of virus in the lungs. Secondly, loss of STAT1 allows for unregulated cell proliferation in response to the innate immune response, causing enhanced damage to the lungs and death of the animals. Our findings also point to an increasing role of the cell damage response to viral infection that can be potential targets for therapy in highly pathogenic respiratory infections.",

Spleen of STAT12/2 mouse at 24 dpi stained with Mason's Trichome stain, showing collagen (blue) in zones around the pyogranulomas, X100. G Spleen of STAT12/2 mouse infected with Urbani virus 22 dpi stained with anti-kappa light chain, showing numerous plasma cells adjacent to the pyogranuloma. Hematoxylin, IHC, X200. Found at: doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1000849.s002 (7.14 MB TIF) Figure S3 Real Time analysis on innate immune response genes. RNA from rMA15 infected WT, IFNAR2/2 and STAT12/2 mice was extracted and used for Realtime analysis of (A) IFNB, (B) IFNA, (C) IL18B, (D) IL18, (E) and (F) OAS1. Graphed is the fold increase over 18S rRNA for each sample at 2, 5 and 9 days post infection. For each timepoint, RNA from 5 mice was harvested and the average is shown with the standard deviation of each sample set. Found at: doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1000849.s003 (0.48 MB EPS) Figure S4 A. Lungs from mice infected with Urbani virus were harvested at days 2, 4, 7 and 21 post-infection (n = 5 for each timepoint). Shown are representative sections from IL28Ra2/2 mouse lungs stained with H&E at each timepoint. B. Mice were infected with rMA15 virus and lungs were harvested at days 2 and 4 post-infection. The infection was lethal for both BALB/c and IL28Ra2/2 mice by day 4 post-infection. Uninfected BALB/c mouse lungs are shown as a comparison. Found at: doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1000849.s004 (4.65 MB TIF)",
