            "text": "B lymphocytes (B cells) play a critical role in adaptive immunity, providing protection from pathogens through the production of specific antibodies. B cells recognize and respond to pathogen-derived antigens through surface B cell receptors (BCRs). The BCR has two interrelated functions in B cell activation. The first is to initiate signal cascades that result in the transcription of a variety of genes associated with B cell activation (Pierce and Liu, 2010) . The second is to mediate antigen uptake and processing, leading to antigen presentation to T cells within the MHC class II context and full activation of the B cells (Lanzavecchia, 1985) . Similarly, BCR-mediated antigen internalization has been shown to facilitate the presentation of lipid antigens in the context of CD1d, which can result in the recruitment of iNKT cell help (Barral et al., 2008; Leadbetter et al., 2008) or the transport of TLR agonists, resulting in TLR7 or TLR9 signaling (Marshak-Rothstein, 2006; Hou et al., 2011) .",

In human B cells, TLR signaling has been suggested to represent a third signal required for the polyclonal activation of naive B cells (Ruprecht and Lanzavecchia, 2006) . Furthermore, TLR signaling has also been implicated in antibody responses in vivo, long-term B cell memory, and plasma cell differentiation (Bernasconi et al., 2002) .

During the last decade, the direct cloning of Ig variable genes from single cells (Babcook et al., 1996; Wardemann et al., 2003) and, more recently, the next-generation sequencing of IgH variable genes have facilitated the isolation of antigen-specific B cells from the plasmablast or memory cell population in the peripheral blood approximately a week after infection or vaccination (Wrammert et al., 2008; Scheid et al., 2009; Smith et al., 2009; Zhu et al., 2013) . One limitation in using some of these antigen-specific B cell isolation methods is imposed by the time frame of the humoral response to infection or immunization, which typically peaks 7 d postvaccination and returns to barely detectable levels of specific antibody by day 14 (Wrammert et al., 2008) . The results of these in vivo studies underscore the need for fast and inexpensive in vitro systems that can recapitulate at least some features of the human immune response.",

The in vitro activation of B cells in an antigen-dependent manner is difficult to achieve, because the wide haplotype variation of MHC IIs necessitates the use of unique T cells specific to a particular MHC II to activate B cells in vitro (Fauci et al., 1976; Borrebaeck et al., 1988) . To overcome these limitations, we developed a novel, in vitro strategy to stimulate human B cells with streptavidin nanoparticles conjugated to both GpG and antigen (Eckl-Dorna and Batista, 2009 ). B cells producing antigen-specific antibodies were identified, quantified, and characterized to determine the antibody repertoire. We validated the utility of this approach using human B cells from healthy individuals against a wide range of infectious targets including tetanus toxoid (TT), hemagglutinin (HA) from several subtypes of influenza A, and the HIV envelope protein gp120. We also determined the physiological effectiveness of the antibodies by measuring their antigen-binding affinities and neutralizing abilities. Additionally, we demonstrated that this method allows selective, in vitro recall of human B cells, overcoming the difficulties of either isolating the infrequent antigen-specific memory B cells present in the peripheral blood of healthy subjects under normal circumstances or the requirement for vaccination or infection and the use of plasmablasts as a source of antigen-specific cells. This is a novel and valuable approach not only to rapidly generate therapeutic antibodies, but also to accelerate immunogen design, testing, and early characterization of human vaccines, obviating the need for laborious, time-consuming, and expensive clinical trials.",

These findings have been exploited as an efficient way of retrieving human monoclonal antibodies in vitro (Traggiai et al., 2004) . We hypothesized that the delivery of a TLR ligand via BCR-mediated internalization might represent a way of exclusively activating B cells with a particular BCR specificity. To determine the best stimulatory conditions for such activation, we first took advantage of an anti-\u03ba-chain antibody to target CpG to the BCR, because 60% of circulating human B cells bear this BCR chain; the rest bear a \u03bb chain. We coated streptavidin polystyrene nanoparticles with a mixture of biotinylated anti-\u03ba antibody and the TLR ligand CpG, as we have previously described in mice (Eckl-Dorna and Batista, 2009) .",

We wondered whether this could be caused by B cells reaching different stages of plasma cell differentiation in each of these conditions. To investigate this, we used flow cytometry to monitor the differentiation of proliferating cells by the expression of the surface molecules CD27 and CD38, which are up-regulated during plasma cell differentiation. When stimulated with soluble CpG, 38% of the cells were CD27 hi /CD38 int , a characteristic phenotype that has been described for plasmablasts (Fig. 2 a; Fink, 2012) . Stimulation with particulate anti-\u03ba-CpG or anti-\u03bb-CpG (but not with particulate anti-\u03ba or anti-\u03bb) led to the production of CD27 hi /CD38 hi cells (44% for anti-\u03ba-CpG and 30% for anti-\u03bb-CpG), characteristic of a plasma cell phenotype (Fig. 2 a) . In line with the plasma cell differentiation stage, we observed an increase in IgG secretion after stimulation with soluble CpG and particulate anti-\u03ba-CpG or anti-\u03bb-CpG and higher levels of IgG antibodies bearing \u03ba-light or \u03bb chain when the cells were stimulated with particulate anti-\u03ba-CpG or anti-\u03bb-CpG, respectively (Fig. 2 b) .

An analysis of the transcriptional activity of all Ig-\u03ba and Ig-\u03bb variable and constant region genes revealed that anti-\u03ba-CpG stimula-tion resulted in the specific enhanced expression of \u03ba-chain genes in CD27 hi /CD38 hi cells, with minimal bystander activation of \u03bb-chain B cells (Fig. 2 e) .

For this experiment, memory B cells were either unstimulated or stimulated with soluble CpG or particulate TT-CpG. It is important to note that memory B cells were purified from healthy donors who had not been recently vaccinated against tetanus or otherwise restimulated. Plasma cell differentiation was assessed by flow cytometry as described earlier. Interestingly, a distinct population of CD27 hi /CD38 hi plasma cells was observed after stimulation with TT-CpG (Fig. 3 a, top row, orange quadrants).

As shown in Fig. 3 a (lower row), 217 of the 2,500 plasma cells sorted after memory B cell stimulation with particulate TT-CpG were TT specific. In contrast, there was a 10-fold decrease in the number of plasma cells (n = 18/2,500) present after memory B cells were stimulated with soluble CpG. To test the specificity of the antibodies produced by bulk-sorted plasma cells after particulate TT-CpG stimulation, we performed ELI SA using TT as a coating antigen (Fig. 3 a, right) . We found that only antibodies produced after particulate TT-CpG stimulation were TT specific, and no signal was produced in the absence of stimulus. Moreover, the ELI SA results showed that these antibodies were TT specific, and they did not exhibit any cross-reactivity to an irrelevant protein control (Fig. 3 a, right) . To unambiguously establish the number of TT-specific plasma cells present in these cultures, we performed singlecell sorting of CD27 hi /CD38 hi plasma cells by FACS. For each cell, we amplified the corresponding heavy and light chains by nested PCR and cloned them into expression vectors. To produce recombinant monoclonal human antibodies of the same specificity in vitro, we transiently expressed 56 antibodies in HEK-293 cells. The culture supernatants were harvested after 3 d, quantified for expressed IgG levels, and screened for antibody specificity by ELI SA (Fig. 3b, left) . The levels of antibody production by individual transfections ranged from 0.5 to 3 \u00b5g/ml, with a mean concentration of 1 \u00b5g/ml. Furthermore, half-maximal binding (EC 50 ) of the TT-specific antibodies was also determined and found to be in the micromolar range, reinforcing the TT specificity of these antibodies (Fig. 3 b, right) .",

Notably, this represents a >1,000-fold enrichment compared with the expected 0.04% circulating TT-specific memory B cells mentioned previously after only 6 d of in vitro stimulation (Giesecke et al., 2014) . Moreover, the multiple encounter of the same antibody sequence is indicative of the in vitro proliferation of a single B cell after stimulation. These antibodies also showed an extensive diversity in V(D)J gene usage, with no dominant preferences for particular genes, and a broad distribution of heavy chain complementaritydetermining region 3 (CDR3) lengths (Table S1 ). Some of the recovered VH segments also show sequence similarities to anti-TT VH gene sequences previously isolated from vaccinated individuals (de Kruif et al., 2009; DeKosky et al., 2013; unpublished data) . Interestingly, we also found two antibodies with identical VH and JH gene usage and CDR3 junctions, but carrying single point mutations (TT-Ab3 and TT-Ab4; Table S1 ; and Fig. S3 a) . These antibodies, although sharing identical heavy (VH1-69/D4-17/JH4) and light (VK-39/ JK4) chain gene usage, differed in the number of mutations in their sequences, indicating that they are clonally related (Table S1 ; and Fig. S3 a) . This is consistent with antibodies produced by individual B cells that most likely originated in vivo via somatic hypermutation but subsequently proliferated in vitro. The identification of 13 unique B cell clones strongly suggests that our in vitro booster vaccination is able to sample a wide repertoire of TT-specific B cells, in particular when taking into consideration that only single 56 activated B cells were used for single-cell sequence analysis.",

This analysis suggests the presence of mutations within framework regions (FWRs) 1-3 and CDR1/2 ( Fig.  S3 b) . VH gene segments showed a higher number of mutations in TT-specific antibodies compared with sequences of unknown specificity (P = 0.005). The number of mutations ranged between 10 and 35 in TT-specific antibodies (21.77 \u00b1 2.17) and between 1 and 29 in those of unknown specificity (12.75 \u00b1 1.26; Fig. 3 d ). An analysis of replacement (R) and silent (S) mutations in the TT-specific antibodies showed that there were more replacements than silent mutations in both the CDRs and the FRWs, although the CDRs displayed a higher overall R/S ratio (Fig. S3 b) . Collectively, there was a higher number of mutations seen in the genes encoding TT-specific antibodies compared with those encoding non-TT-specific cloned antibodies, and a higher frequency of replacement mutations compared with silent mutations, especially in the CDRs, both of which suggest antigen-driven selection. Another possibility, however, is that particulate TT-CpG may have preferentially induced the differentiation or proliferation of a proportion of TT-specific memory cells with higher affinity or mutation.",

The cutoff value for a positive signal was set as more than twofold above background.

Analysis of somatic hypermutation showed that the genes encoding H7-specific antibodies had more somatic mutations than those of unknown specificity. The number of mutations ranged from 11 to 35 in H7-specific cells (20.14 \u00b1 1.95) and from 0 to 28 mutations in those that were not H7 specific (14.16 \u00b1 0.99; Fig. S4 e) .

Interestingly, when we examined the cross-reactivity of H7-positive antibodies against the previous panel of influenza HA subtypes, we found that 12 of the H7-positive antibodies bound to at least one other influenza subtype and that three were panreactive with all subtypes (Fig. 5 f) . In conclusion, by stimulating memory B cells in vitro with particulate H5-or H7-CPG, we were able to generate a high frequency of cross-reactive or even panreactive antibodies.",

To this end, we performed a competitive ELI SA with C179, a cross-neutralizing anti-HA stem antibody (Okuno et al., 1993) . As shown in Fig. 6 c, the neutralizers H5-Ab2 and H5-Ab4 efficiently compete with C179 for binding to the A/California/7/2009 (H1N1) HA, indicating that these antibodies are binding to the HA stem. To further substantiate these findings, we evaluated the binding of these antibodies to different HA mutants by ELI SA. We took advantage of wild-type HA from A/New Caledonia/20/1999 (H1 wt); a mutant HA containing arginine substitutions that block access to the stem epitope (H1 delta stem I45R/T49R), and a mutant with an N-glycan insertion that also prevents access to the stem epitope (H1 delta stem 45glyc). In this assay, the HA stem-binding antibody CR6261 and the HA head-binding antibody CH65 were used as controls. Although both antibodies bound to the positive control H1 wt, the binding of CR6261 to the I45R/T49R or 45glyc mutant proteins was compromised. On the other hand, the binding of Ab CH65 to both mutant variants was unaffected (Fig. 6 d) . Both H5-Ab2 and H5-Ab4 lost the capacity to bind the I45R/T49R mutant ( Fig. 6 d) , confirming that these antibodies bind to the stem epitope. Moreover, these antibodies also showed reduced binding to the 45glyc mutant, further supporting the binding of H2-Ab2 and H5-Ab4 to the HA stem region (Fig. 6 d) .",

Therefore it was important to test the suitability of our approach using an antigen for which we are not relying on the preexistence of memory B cells from previous related-virus exposure. To this end, we stimulated memory B cells from five HIV-uninfected individuals with particulate gp120-CpG. We single-cell sorted, sequenced VH and VL, and expressed 257 antibodies. Eighteen of these antibodies were shown to be positive at recognizing recombinant gp120, as tested by ELI SA and by flow cytometry (Figs. 7 a and S5 a) . VH gene sequence alignment revealed antibodies with identical sequences in three of the five donors, suggesting in vitro B cell clonal expansion (Fig. 7 b) . Analysis of somatic hypermutations in the rearranged VH gene segments showed 13 mutated VH sequences, with five to 34 mutations (16.54 \u00b1 2.58; Table S7 ). This indicates that these B cells might have arisen from B cells that have previously been triggered by an unknown antigen. Additionally, we also identified five antibodies that contain from zero to three mutations from the closest germline (Table S8 ), which may reflect that the B cells that gave rise to these antibodies have not been affinity matured against gp120.",

Although seven of the antibodies were able to bind to one or more proteins of the panel, antibodies gp120-Ab8 and gp120-Ab9 proved to be negative in this assay (Fig. 7 c) . Moreover, biolayer interferometry (BLI) showed that gp120-Ab8 and gp120-Ab9 exhibited a measureable affinity of 89.3 and 124 nM to gp120, respectively, suggesting that they were specific to gp120 and were unlikely to be simply Figure 5 .

Indeed, B cells require second signals such as CD40 or TLR, and the presence of different interleukin cocktails, including IL-21, IL-2, IL-6, and IL-15 (Arpin et al., 1995; Bernasconi et al., 2002; Ettinger et al., 2005; Huggins et al., 2007) . This type of stimulation has been used extensively to effectively activate polyclonal B cells (Corti et al., 2010; Smith et al., 2014) . In contrast to CD40L stimulation, soluble CpG stimulation requires a high concentration, which forces entry through nonspecific uptake by the cells (H\u00e4cker et al., 1998) , triggering a strong activation of B cells irrespective of BCR specificity. In contrast, an advantage of our method is that the binding of CpG to a nanosphere prevents nonspecific entry into B cells, so particulate-CpG can gain access to the TLR9 compartments only via antigen-specific BCR internalization. As a result, only those B cells that bind antigen receive the correct signals to proliferate and differentiate. Importantly, particulate anti-BCR stimulation alone is a poor inducer of proliferation and differentiation. Similarly, soluble CpG alone is sufficient to drive proliferation but not plasma cell differentiation. Stimulation of both BCR and TLR, however, results in robust proliferation, plasma cell differentiation, and antibody secretion. In the future, it will be important to define the precise signals involved in the induction of plasma cell differentiation.",

In addition to the \u03ba/\u03bb proof of principle, we have successfully applied this approach to different antigens, demonstrating its robustness and reproducibility. We have shown that in vitro stimulation of memory B cells with particulate antigen-CpG (TT, influenza HA, gp120) selectively enriched the frequency of CD27 hi /CD38 hi antigen-specific plasma cells despite the very low number of precursors circulating in peripheral blood and regardless of the nature of the pathogen-derived antigen chosen to coat the nanoparticles.

We also found VDJ sequences with point mutations, which most likely represent sister cells that underwent in vivo somatic mutation and were individually stimulated in our in vitro system.

This was further suggested by functional assays in which, of the nine antibodies tested, two demonstrated neutralizing activity against H1N1 HA. Indeed, we demonstrated that the two neutralizing antibodies identified in this study are specific to the stalk of HA. It has been shown that antibodies against the stem domain of HA are able to neutralize a wide spectrum of influenza virus strains and subtypes, because this domain is comparatively conserved (Ekiert et al., 2009; Corti et al., 2011; Dreyfus et al., 2012) . Furthermore, three of the antibodies that were isolated from H1 stimulations, HA-Ab1, HA-Ab2, and HA-Ab3, are clonally related to two antibodies that have been recently identified as predominantly neutralizing antibodies developed upon H5 immunization in humans (Joyce et al., 2016) .

However, all these methodologies rely on large-scale screening to identify only a few truly antigen-specific antibodies. Although more recently, antigen-specific B cell sorting and single-cell cloning have circumvented some of these issues, these approaches are still restricted to high-affinity antibody-antigen interactions (Franz et al., 2011) . In contrast, the method reported here can overcome this barrier, as it does not rely on single BCR-antigen interactions but instead on the avidity of the BCR for the antigen arranged on the particle. As such, our approach allows antigen-specific isolation of Abs with K d values ranging from 10 \u22129 to 10 \u221212 M for TT and influenza HA, and 10 \u22127 to 10 \u22128 M in the case of HIV gp120. Furthermore, our method induces the differentiation into antigen-specific plasma cells with the concomitant up-regulation of immunoglobulin genes compared with memory cells, thereby facilitating single-cell antibody cloning. Thus, our approach could be applied in future for the fast generation of human monoclonal antibodies, and it offers the possibility to interrogate antigen immunogenicity in vitro. This can be achieved in a matter of days, without the need of expensive GMP protein production or the involvement of patients in time-consuming clinical trials (Joyce et al., 2016) . As such, our approach not only complements existing methodologies but also offers an alternative for an in vitro phase 0 trial. This will help in future vaccine development by accelerating the iterative immunogen design before entering into phase I clinical trial.",

Our methodology could have important applications in the production of therapeutic antibodies; specifically, it should allow their production within a shorter time frame in vitro and without the need for vaccination or blood/serum donation from recently infected or vaccinated individuals. In addition, our method offers the potential to evaluate and facilitate new vaccine development by allowing the efficient evaluation of any candidate target antigen.

Anti-phospho-Lyn (Y507), anti-phospho-ERK, anti-phospho-Akt (Ser473), anti-phospho-Syk, anti-phospho-PLC\u03d22, anti-phospho-CD19, antiphospho-SHP-1, and anti-ERK were all from Cell Signaling Technology. The density of the bands was quantified by densitometry, corrected for background, normalized to the density of the actin band in the same sample, and made relative to the unstimulated zero time point for each condition. statistics Differences in CDR3 length and V gene mutations were calculated by paired two-tailed Student's t test. Differences were considered to be statistically significant at values of P \u2264 0.05. EC 50 values were calculated using nonlinear regression (curve fit), parameter: log (agonist) vs. normalized response \u2212 variable slope. IC 50 and logIC 50 values were calculated using nonlinear regression (curve fit), parameter: log (inhibitor) vs. normalized response \u2212 variable slope. All statistical analyses were performed with Prism v6.0a and h. online supplemental material Fig. S1 provides a comparison of in vitro stimulation of memory B cells obtained from fresh versus frozen PBMCs. Fig. S2 describes the phenotype of the CD27 high /CD38 int and CD27 high / CD38 high cell populations and gene expression of transcription factors involved in plasma cell differentiation. Fig. S3 shows an analysis of the sequence of TT-specific antibodies. Fig. S4 shows a sequence analysis of HA-specific antibodies.

Data from one representative experiment of three is shown. (b) Specificity of the recombinant antibodies generated from sorted plasma cells from two donors was tested by ELI SA. After transient transfection of HEK293T cells with plasmids expressing cognate pairs of IgH and IgL genes, the culture supernatant was tested for the presence of antibodies specific for H1 or an irrelevant protein control; the recombinant IgG antibody concentration ranged from 1 to 3 \u00b5g/ml. (c) The frequency of the H1-specific clones is depicted by the pie chart. The percentage of H1-positive antibodies retrieved from each donor is indicated in the center of the pie chart. The numbers outside the pie chart indicate the number of antibody allele sequences with identical IgH and IgL chain rearrangements. (d) Comparison of the absolute numbers of somatic mutations in the VH genes encoding 56 H1-specific and 34 non-H1-specific antibodies. Boxes represent the percentile range (25-75%), the horizontal bar indicates the median, and whiskers extend to the highest and lowest data points. Two-tailed P values were calculated with an unpaired t test (P = 0.0870; NS). (e) Affinity (K d 1/M) of the H1-specific antibodies. Boxes represent the percentile range (25-75%), the horizontal bar indicates the median K d value (7.34 nM) of 14 H1-specific antibodies, and whiskers extend to the highest and lowest data points. (f) ELI SA test to detect cross-reactivity of antibodies derived after H1 stimulation. Strong binding is coded in red (>2.0 OD 405 ), intermediate in orange (1.0-2.0 OD 405 ), and weak in yellow (0.3-1.0 OD 405 ).",

(d) Specificity of the H7 recombinant antibodies retrieved from four donors. Culture supernatants from transfected HEK293T cells, with a mean IgG concentration of 1 \u00b5g/ml, were tested by ELI SA for the presence of antibodies specific for H7 or to an irrelevant protein control. The cutoff considered for positive results was more than twofold background. (e) Frequency of H7-specific clones.
