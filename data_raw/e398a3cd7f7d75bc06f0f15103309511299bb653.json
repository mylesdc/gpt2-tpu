Notwithstanding a number of successful case studies, previous works have shown that using different mobility data sources, such as mobile phone data or census surveys, to parametrize infectious disease models can generate divergent outcomes. Thus, it remains unclear to what extent epidemic modelling results may vary when using different proxies for human movements. Here, we systematically compare 658 000 simulated outbreaks generated with a spatially structured epidemic model based on two different human mobility networks: a commuting network of France extracted from mobile phone data and another extracted from a census survey. We compare epidemic patterns originating from all the 329 possible outbreak seed locations and identify the structural network properties of the seeding nodes that best predict spatial and temporal epidemic patterns to be alike. We find that similarity of simulated epidemics is significantly correlated to connectivity, traffic and population size of the seeding nodes, suggesting that the adequacy of mobile phone data for infectious disease models becomes higher when epidemics spread between highly connected and heavily populated locations, such as large urban areas.",

A detailed description of human mobility is important for characterizing and forecasting the spatial and temporal spread of infectious diseases [19] and human movement data have become an essential ingredient for most spatial epidemic models, both at global [20] [21] [22] and national or continental scale [23] [24] [25] . The urgent need for accurate mobility data to inform epidemic models has been recently spotlighted during the 2014 West Africa Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak [26, 27] . Other recent global public health threats, such as the 2013 MERS-CoV outbreak and the 2016 Zika virus outbreak, have called for a prompt characterization of human movements originating from the affected areas to properly inform modelling efforts and assess the risk of importation to the rest of the world [28, 29] .",

Among the vast literature on the use of mobile phone data, there are a few studies presenting a side-by-side comparison of different proxies for human mobility with applications to infectious disease modelling, especially considering mobile phone data [35] [36] [37] . These studies pointed out some important differences in estimates of human movements from mobile phone records when compared with official surveys or mobility models. More specifically, travel volumes tend to be larger when measured by CDRs than by surveys or census. By contrast, the overall network topology is usually well captured by mobile phone data, with differences mainly affecting less connected or less populated areas [36] .",

We have previously examined the two networks in terms of their statistical features, comparing their topology and distributions of travel flows, and found a good statistical agreement between the two [36] . By contrast, previous results based on simulated epidemics on the two networks have shown that simulation outcomes may vary substantially when using one dataset or the other, depending on the specific outbreak location and disease parameters [36] . Here, we thoroughly assess the adequacy of the mobile phone network to match epidemic patterns that have been generated by simulations using the census data. Our goal is to test the goodness of the mobile phone mobility network to replace the census survey mobility network, which is explicitly assumed to be the best representation of commuting patterns in France. To this aim, we compare the spatio-temporal properties of simulated outbreaks originating from every possible seed of the mobility networks and quantify their similarity in terms of the epidemic invasion tree and arrival time of first infection. We identify the features characterizing the outbreak seed nodes that best correlate the similarity between epidemic patterns and discuss how these results can help to assess the adequacy of mobile phone data to describe recurrent mobility patterns in spatial epidemic models.

We then compared the similarity of spatial epidemic patterns by computing the Jaccard index of the minimum spanning trees. For each different outbreak seed s, the Jaccard index is defined as",

In general, the temporal hierarchy of the epidemics, measured by the Spearman's rank correlation r s between the arrival times of all the nodes, was found to be very similar between the two networks with r s > 0.69 for every seed s of the network. Figure 1a shows that the distribution of r s ranges between r s = 0.69 and r s = 0.94, with averager s = 0.85. The similarity between the spatial infection patterns on the two networks was more widely distributed with values of the Jaccard index ranging between J = 0.13 and J = 0.46, with averageJ = 0.27 ( figure 1b) . Therefore, while the temporal sequence of infected nodes during an outbreak was generally well preserved in the two networks for most of the epidemic seeds, the paths of infection varied significantly with as few as 13% of transmission links shared between infection trees in some scenarios. Figure 1c highlights similarity of temporal patterns measured by r s was only mildly correlated with the spatial similarity measured by J (\u03c1 = 0.33). The two quantities displayed a different behaviour and high values of r s were sometimes associated to low values of J, showing that they provide a different view of the system under study. The similarity of both spatial and temporal epidemic patterns was mainly driven by a few features of the outbreak seed that were in general positively correlated with each other, specifically the degree of a node and its traffic. As shown in table 1, the Pearson's correlation coefficient \u03c1 between all the degree measures and the similarity of temporal (r s ) and spatial patterns (J(i, M, C) Node population, which is generally expected to correlate with degree and traffic, was also found to be a significant predictor for the similarity of epidemic temporal (\u03c1 = 0.403) and spatial patterns (\u03c1 = 0.687) as shown in table 3.

For both temporal and spatial similarity, the best predictive models were based on several variables and hundreds of models were found to be statistically equivalent based on their AIC values. It was not possible, therefore, to identify a parsimonious set of characteristics of the seed node that alone would best predict the epidemic outcomes on both networks. Indeed, designing a set of rules to extrapolate the results of simulated epidemics from a proxy mobility network to another one, and possibly generalizing such rules across different countries, would be of highly practical importance. However, our results suggest that a perfect match between simulated epidemics on two mobility networks cannot be obtained by a simple rescaling or normalization based on a single or few network metrics.",

In our case, both datasets referred to the same year and the definition of commuting in the census data included both home-work and home-school movements, thus virtually representing the best available description to be matched with mobile phone data. Extending our analysis to include all types of movement into an epidemic model can be challenging owing to the lack of data from census or travel surveys on a geographical scale large enough to be compared with mobile phone records.

An even better match could be obtained by refining the normalization procedure and by identifying more accurately home and work locations by including more metadata, as tested in [36] . However, we do not expect these refinements to impact significantly on our results, as they will introduce second order changes in the topology of the mobile phone network. On the other hand, in most real situations CDRs will be affected by geographical biases in network coverages and usage or incurred by certain demographic groups being more frequent phone users [53] , not to mention how difficult the access to such data can be owing to their sensitive nature. Trying to correct for such socioeconomic biases, by taking them into account in the normalization procedure, could provide a potential explanation for the discrepancies observed between epidemic outcomes on the two networks. On the other hand, it would also increase the number of parameters or assumptions in the model. For this reason, we decided to focus on a basic normalization, as it is also more easily generalizable to other settings where socio-economic variables are not easily accessible. Also, alternative sources of mobility have been proposed to complement mobile phone records such as GPS [54] or social media traces [55, 56] , the latter being more easily accessible at the cost of introducing other uncertainties on the demographics of the travellers and the type of movement.",

Results might be different when considering other diseases for which movements other than commuting might be relevant, and for which transmission is driven by environmental conditions, such as cholera or poliovirus. In general, we expect our findings to hold true within the modelling of rapidly disseminated directly transmitted infections.",

Moreover, there is no a priori correct level of aggregation for analysis of human mobility and infectious disease dynamics [58] . It becomes clear that, to obtain a detailed picture of human mobility in an area for epidemic modelling, it is necessary to consider combinations of data in a multilayer fashion [21, 59] . To what extent modelling results are affected by the integration of one particular mobility proxy compared to others, and how this relates to the epidemiological properties of the disease under study-whether it could be a rapidly transmitted infection or a vector borne disease-requires further research.",

Results suggest that obtaining an accurate description of human movements in the area at the origin of the outbreak can be essential to capture its future spreading patterns, and that mobile phones are more reliable in central regions than peripheral ones. However, it would be important to investigate how this requirement can be reduced by changing the spatial resolution of interest and how this depends on the use of mobile phone data or other proxies to approximate human mobility. Continued work along these directions is important to understand how to measure epidemiologically relevant patterns of movement to be further integrated into computational models which can ultimately help in forecasting and controlling disease spread.",
