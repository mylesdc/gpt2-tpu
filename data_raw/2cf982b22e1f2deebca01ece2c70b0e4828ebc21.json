            "text": "The exact role of CD8 + T cells during Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection has been heavily debated, yet it is generally accepted that CD8 + T cells contribute to protection against Mtb. In this study, however, we show that the Mtb-susceptible CBA/J mouse strain accumulates large numbers of CD8 + T cells in the lung as infection progresses, and that these cells display a dysfunctional and immunosuppressive phenotype (PD-1 + , Tim-3 + , CD122 + ). CD8 + T cell expansions from the lungs of Mtb-infected CBA/J mice were also capable of secreting the immunosuppressive cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10), although in vivo CD8 + T cell depletion did not significantly alter Mtb burden. Further analysis revealed that pulmonary CD8 + T cells from Mtb-infected CBA/J mice were clonally expanded, preferentially expressing T cell receptor (TcR) Vb chain 8 (8.2, 8.3) or Vb 14. Although Vb8 + CD8 + T cells were responsible for the majority of IL-10 production, in vivo depletion of Vb8 + did not significantly change the outcome of Mtb infection, which we hypothesize was a consequence of their dual IL-10/IFN-c secreting profiles. Our data demonstrate that IL-10-secreting CD8 + T cells can arise during chronic Mtb infection, although the significance of this T cell population in tuberculosis pathogenesis remains unclear.",

To appreciate the role that the host immune system plays in Mtb reactivation, we used relatively resistant (C57BL/6) or susceptible (CBA/J) mice, whose susceptibility phenotype is most apparent during late stages of infection, to represent differences in the natural progression of TB between different human populations. CBA/J mice have low numbers of antigen-specific CD4 T cells that produce relatively small amounts of IFN-c [1] [2] [3] [4] . CBA/J mice also have elevated amounts of IL-10 during Mtb infection [5, 6] , contributing to their increased susceptibility to infection. However, the importance of CD8 + T cells during Mtb infection in this mouse strain remains unclear.",

PD-1 has classically been used as a marker of T cell exhaustion in viral infection and in cancer [27] [28] [29] [30] , while other studies have found that cells expressing Tim-3 are dysfunctional and lack regulation [31, 32] , and that coexpression of PD-1 and Tim-3 leads to extensive dysfunction of CD8 + T cells [33] . Furthermore, CD8 + T cells expressing both PD-1 and CD122 (the b subunit of the IL-2 receptor) have been shown to have suppressive qualities and secrete IL-10 [34] . We, and others, have previously demonstrated that Mtb susceptibility in CBA/J mice is mediated by excessive pulmonary IL-10 during infection [1, 2, 5, 35, 36] , yet the underlying mechanism remains unclear.

CD8 + T cell expansions expressed the inhibitory molecules PD-1, Tim-3, and/ or CD122, and were capable of secreting IL-10. CD8 + T cells from CBA/J mice also preferentially expressed TcR Vb8 and Vb14, severely limiting the diversity of the CD8 + T cell repertoire. Although Vb8 CD8 + T cells could secrete IL-10, in vivo depletion of this specific T cell clonal population during chronic infection did not overtly change the Mtb burden in the lungs in the timeframe tested, although the amount of IL-10 in the lung was reduced indicating some biological impact of depletion. Comparing mouse strains that are relatively resistant and susceptible to Mtb has enabled us to uncover a previously unappreciated role for CD8 + T cells in Mtb susceptibility, and links the poor T cell function previously described by us [4, 6, 36] with increased production of IL-10 in the CBA/J mouse strain.",

In contrast to the reduced number of CD4 + T cells, CBA/J mice demonstrated a significant late accumulation of CD8 + T cells within the lungs as Mtb infection progressed (Fig. 1b) , eventually reaching or surpassing the number of pulmonary CD8 + T cells observed in C57BL/6 mice. This late accumulation was absent from C57BL/6 mice which reached a plateau at day 60. Skewing of T cell subset proportions in CBA/J mice could be better appreciated by determination of CD4:CD8 ratios throughout the course of infection (Fig. 1c) , where a significant decline in the ratio of CD4 + to CD8 + T cells was observed by day 90 of Mtb infection, preceding the increasing CFU within the lungs of CBA/J mice (Fig. 1d) [4, 6] . BrdU staining of pulmonary CD4 + (Fig. 1e) and CD8 + T (Fig. 1f) cells from CBA/J mice was not dramatically altered throughout infection, suggesting that the increased numbers of CD8 + T cells that were evident in CBA/J mice may not be due to local proliferation, but a consequence of enhanced cellular recruitment. CBA/J mice are known to produce abundant IL-10 in their lungs as Mtb infection progresses [5] and IL-10 can stimulate the proliferation of CD8 + T cells [41] . Therefore, we examined the numbers of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells present in the lungs of CBA/J IL-10 2/2 mice over the course of Mtb infection (Fig. 1g, h) and did not observe any differences between wild-type and IL-10 2/2 CBA/J mice in CD8 + T cell accumulations at late stages of infection, demonstrating that CD8 + T cell expansions occur independent of IL-10. A significant increase in CD4 + and CD8 + T cells was observed in CBA/J IL-10 2/2 mice at day 30, reflecting enhanced T H 1 immunity in these mice (unpublished observations). These data demonstrate that the accumulation of CD8 + T cells in the lungs of CBA/J mice during chronic infection is not mediated by IL-10.",

As expected, C57BL/6 mice had increasing numbers of CD4 + [4] and CD8 + T cells that could produce IFN-c as infection progressed (Fig. 2a) , which paralleled the increasing numbers of T cells within the lung (Fig. 1) . CBA/J showed an equivalent increase in IFN-cproducing CD4 + T cells (Fig. 2b) , albeit at a significantly lower number compared to C57BL/6, as we have previously described [3, 4] . Where the data differed, however, was in the finding that the number of IFN-c-producing CD8 + T cells reached a plateau as early as day 30 post-infection and did not increase any further, despite a significant accumulation of CD8 + T cells within the lungs of CBA/J mice. As Mtb infection progressed we also observed a significant increase in the number of CD8 + T cells from CBA/J mice that could express CD69 (Fig. 2c) , with over 40% of all CD8 + T cells in the lungs of CBA/J mice being activated during chronic infection. CD8 + T cells also expressed the suppressor of T H 1 responses Tim-3 (Fig. 2d) , PD-1 (Fig. 2e) , with a small population expressing both PD-1 and CD122 (Fig. 2f) . Therefore, although highly activated, a proportion of CD8 + T cell expansions from chronic Mtb infected CBA/J mice had a phenotype that was not associated with T H 1 cytokine secretion but was instead linked to immuno-suppressive properties including IL-10 production [34] . Because IL-10 production has been closely linked to Mtb susceptibility of CBA/J mice [5] , we next examined the capacity of CD8 + T cells to produce IL-10.",

CD8 + cells from CBA/J mice, and not C57BL/6 mice, were capable of secreting IL-10 in response to TcR cross-linking (Fig. 3a) . In contrast, CD8 neg cells from both mouse strains were capable of secreting IL-10 under these same conditions (Fig. 3b) . IL-10-secreting CD8 neg cells were predominantly CD4 + as adherent cells were removed during cell purification and we have failed to detect IL-10 within B cells and neutrophils in both mouse strains (not shown). We also observed that CD8 + T cells from CBA/J and C57BL/6 mice were capable of secreting IFN-c under the same culture conditions (measured in the IL-10 ELISPOT supernatants) (Fig. 3c) . Culture of purified CD8 + and CD8 neg cells from Mtb infected CBA/J mice with Mtb-infected BMDCs in the absence of TcR cross-linking, indicative of an Mtb-specific response, resulted in the secretion of IL-10 from both CD8 neg and CD8 + cells (Fig. 3d) . Interestingly, the capacity of CD8 + T cells to produce IL-10 increased over time, in parallel to the increasing CFU and CD8 + T cell numbers in the lung. The low SFU, relative to TcR cross-linking likely reflects the challenges of delivering of Mtb antigen into the appropriate processing pathway for presentation to CD8 + T cells.",

At late stages of Mtb infection, we observed that CD8 + T cells from CBA/J mice primarily expressed two variable regions of the TcR beta chain (Vb). Vb8 (8.2,8.3) and Vb14 were expressed by approximately 45% of all CD8 + T cells in CBA/J mice at day 120 after Mtb infection, compared to a less restrictive repertoire in C57BL/6 mice (Fig. 4a) . Vb expression was comparable on CD4 + T cells from both mouse strains (Fig. 4b) , indicating a unique expansion within the CD8 + T cell pool in CBA/J mice as Mtb infection progressed. More detailed examination over the course of Mtb infection showed that the percentage of CD8 + T cells expressing Vb8 or Vb14 was always significantly higher throughout Mtb infection in CBA/J mice, and this population significantly expanded further at late time points of Mtb infection (Fig. 4c,  d) . Similar to our findings with CD8 + T cell expansions, we found that both Vb8 and Vb14 CD8 + T cells were highly activated (Fig. 4e) .",

Significantly more CD8 + Vb8 + T cells from Mtb-infected CBA/J mice were capable of producing IL-10 than CD8 + Vb8 neg T cells from CBA/J mice or from CD8 + Vb8 + and CD8 + Vb8 neg T cells from C57BL/6 mice (Fig. 4f) . These data indicate a dominant role for CD8 + Vb8 + expressing T cells in the IL-10 production we previously observed in purified CD8 + T cell cultures. Culture supernatants were also assayed for IFN-c by ELISA (Fig. 4g) and our data indicate that CD8 + Vb8 + T cells can have dual secretion of IL-10 and IFN-c, or represent a mixed population, as has been described by others [44] . In vivo depletion of IL-10 producing CD8 + T cells during chronic Mtb infection alters pro-inflammatory responses but fails to modify the bacterial load CD8 + T cells or Vb8 + cells were depleted from wild-type CBA/ J mice from day 90-120 after Mtb infection, a time when IL-10 and Vb8 + CD8 + T cells were increasing in the lungs of Mtbinfected CBA/J mice [5] . Following CD8 + depletion, Mtb CFU (Fig. 5a) , total CD4 + T cell numbers (Fig. 5b) and IFN-cproducing CD4 + T cells (Fig. 5c) were all moderately altered but data did not reach statistical significance. Interestingly, CD8 + T cell depletion led to a significant decrease in the total amount of (Fig. 5d) , reflecting the IL-10secreting capacity of CD8 + T cells we observed in vitro. Depletion of CD4 + T cells led to significantly increased Mtb burden and mortality before day 120 (not shown) showing that depletion of a known protective T cell subset increased susceptibility. Specific depletion of Vb8 + cells also failed to significantly impact the Mtb burden (Fig. 5e) , although a modest reduction in CFU was similarly observed. This modest reduction, similar to our findings with CD8 + T cell depletion, suggests that although IL-10 producing CD8 + T cells may not negatively impact the growth of Mtb during the timeframe we investigated, they do not provide protection.",

CD8 + T cells within the lung expressed CD69, indicative of activation and functional capacity, yet failed to show a concomitant enhancement of IFN-c-producing capacity. These findings indicate that highly activated CD8 + T cells within the lung have alternate function, which we show here to be the capacity to secrete IL-10, measured by ELISPOT due to the known difficulties of measuring IL-10 by intracellular flow cytometry. Altered function was associated with the co-expression of a variety of receptors know for negative regulation of cell function (PD-1, CD122, Tim-3) [25, 28, 33, 34] . In support of our findings, previous studies have shown that in chronic murine Mtb infection PD-1 + T cells can proliferate but fail to secrete IFN-c unless this inhibition is overcome by direct TcR stimulation [45, 46] . It is unclear at this time why CD8 + T cells with inhibitory properties arise in CBA/J mice as Mtb infection progresses but we can hypothesize that this is a consequence of enhanced immune activation and subsequent exhaustion due to increasing bacterial loads in this mouse strain (Fig. 1) [4, 6] .",

            "text": "Our failure to observe any significant change in CFU following CD8 + or Vb8 + T cell depletion can be interpreted in several ways, the simplest being that IL-10-producing CD8 + T cells have no biological influence on the control of Mtb infection. While this is a possibility, we would reason that at the least the presence of IL-10producing CD8 + T cells can be a putative biomarker of TB disease progression as they are only observed in a mouse strain of Mtb susceptibility, and IL-10 producing T cells have been previously described in the blood of TB patients [37] . In support of a negative role for CD8 + T cells in CBA/J mice, in vivo depletion led to a moderate, albeit not significant, decrease in CFU. Thus is in contrast to CD4 + T cell depletion in which all the mice were either dead or moribund before the necropsy time point (data not shown). These findings indicate that some CD8 + T cells from CBA/J mice fail to contribute to protection in a similar manner than might be expected from studies of other mouse strains [47] [48] [49] . One possibility for our failure to detect significant changes in CFU following CD8 + T cell depletion is our observation that CD8 + T cells can secrete both IL-10 and IFN-c. Depletion of all CD8 + T cells would also remove a protective population, leading to a neutral effect. Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that blocking the action of IL-10 in CBA/J mice during Mtb infection provides enhanced protection [5] , and we consider that blocking the action of IL-10 from IL-10/IFN-c-secreting CD8 + T cells contributed to this phenotype.",

CBA/J mice have an endogenous mouse mammary tumor virus (MTV-6) that selectively deletes various TcR Vb chains such as Vb8.1, and Vb 17a [50, 51] however this alone is not sufficient to explain the limited TcR diversity in CBA/J mice. It is possible that Mtb infection leads to specific deletion of certain subsets of protective CD8 + T cells or is driving clonal expansion of less protective cells (Vb8, Vb14). Alternatively Vb8/Vb14 CD8 + T cells in CBA/J mice may respond to a dominant Mtb antigen(s) expressed in vivo, where persistent responsiveness leads to immune exhaustion and subsequent regulation through receptors such as PD-1 and Tim-3. Clonal CD8 + expansions have been described in TB patients [52] , including pediatric TB [42] , supporting the relevance of our findings to TB in man. Clonal CD8 + expansions are also common in the elderly and in many viral models [42, 43, [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] , yet their importance in Mtb infection is still unclear.",
