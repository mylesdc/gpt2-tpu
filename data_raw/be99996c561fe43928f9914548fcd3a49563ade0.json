Objective: We tested the hypothesis that medical students receive insufficient training on correct methods for donning and doffing PPE. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of medical students on clinical rotations at two teaching hospitals to determine the type of training they received in PPE technique. The students performed simulations of contaminated PPE removal with fluorescent lotion on gloves and were assessed for correct PPE technique and skin and/or clothing contamination. To obtain additional information on PPE training during medical education, residents, fellows, and attending physicians completed written questionnaires on PPE training received during medical school and on knowledge of PPE protocols recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Results: Of 27 medical students surveyed, only 11 (41%) reported receiving PPE training, and none had received training requiring demonstration of proficiency. During simulations, 25 of 27 (92.5%) students had one or more lapses in technique and 12 (44%) contaminated their skin with fluorescent lotion. For 100 residents, fellows and attending physicians representing 67 different medical schools, only 53% reported receiving training in use of PPE and only 39% selected correct donning and doffing sequence. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that there is a need for development of effective strategies to train medical students in correct use of PPE.",

Given the need to train medical students in a variety of infection control practices, a practical approach may be to incorporate PPE training into general sessions designed to train personnel in infection control measures. Incorporation of fluorescent lotions or powders into PPE training sessions may be valuable to provide immediate visual feedback on routes and sites of contamination [2] . Use of these methods with a requirement for demonstration of proficiency within an Objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) or routine clinical setting may be effective in reducing the risk for contamination [16] [17] [18] .",

A significant proportion of healthcare delivery has moved from healthcare facilities to outpatient and homecare settings [19, 20] , and it is not uncommon for patients receiving homecare nursing to be colonized or infected with multidrug-resistant organisms [21] . Healthcare-associated infections have a significant financial impact on the U.S. healthcare system, and many of these infections are considered reasonably preventable [22] [23] [24] . Thus, correct use of PPE to prevent pathogen transmission is as important in community healthcare settings as in the hospital.
