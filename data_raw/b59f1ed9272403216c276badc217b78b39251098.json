Here we show that truncated forms of viral genomes that accumulate in infected cells potently trigger the sustained activation of the transcription factors IRF3 and NF-kB and the production type I IFNs through a mechanism independent of IFN signaling. We demonstrate that these defective viral genomes (DVGs) are generated naturally during respiratory infections in vivo even in mice lacking the type I IFN receptor, and their appearance coincides with the production of cytokines during infections with Sendai virus (SeV) or influenza virus. Remarkably, the hallmark antiviral cytokine IFNb is only expressed in lung epithelial cells containing DVGs, while cells within the lung that contain standard viral genomes alone do not express this cytokine. Together, our data indicate that DVGs generated during viral replication are a primary source of danger signals for the initiation of the host immune response to infection.",

In recent years, it has been established that most viral danger signals are derived from oligonucleotide structures exposed during the replication of the viral genomes [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] . However, most viruses produce proteins that antagonize and effectively delay signaling by the primary viral oligonucleotide sensor molecules retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5), allowing the virus to replicate to high titers and produce large amounts of danger signals prior to host intervention [7, 8] . It is currently unclear how the host immune response overcomes viral evasion to initiate a protective antiviral response.",

DVGs have been identified in multiple distinct viral families when the viruses are grown in the laboratory at high multiplicity of infection and span a broad range of hosts, from plants to mammals [12] . Importantly, DVGs are found in patients infected with hepatitis A [13] , hepatitis B [14, 15] , hepatitis C [16] , HIV [17] , dengue virus [18] , and influenza virus [19] .

Our group has also demonstrated that in contrast to standard viral genomes, SeV copy-back DVGs induce the expression of MDA5 and of a number of other interferonstimulated genes in the absence of type I IFN positive feedback [23, 26, 27] . Remarkably, SeV copy-back DVGs show this potent in vitro stimulatory activity even in the presence of functional viral encoded antagonists of the host response [23, 24] . Here, we demonstrate that DVGs that trigger a robust activation of the transcription factors IRF3 and NF-kB accumulate at a high rate in infected cells becoming the main source of viral PAMPs. These DVGs arise naturally during acute respiratory viral infections in mice and provide essential stimuli for the initiation of the antiviral innate immune response in the lung. These data demonstrate the generation of DVGs in vivo during acute respiratory viral infections and suggest a critical role of these kinds of viral genomes in determining the quality of the host response to infection.",

Virus stocks were prepared from the same parental virus and their content of DVGs was determined by calculating the ratio of infectious particles to total particles (ratios are specified in the material and methods section). In addition, copy-back DVGs of these stocks were identified by PCR. One predominant copy-back genome was present in cells infected with SeV Cantell HD (amplicon of 278 bp), while no copy-back defective genome was detected in cells infected with SeV Cantell LD up to six hours after infection (Figs. 1A and S1). Cloning and sequencing of the 278 nt long amplicon confirmed that it corresponded to a previously described SeV Cantell copy-back DVG of 546 nt in length (DVG-546) [28] . Phosphorylation of IRF3 and of the NF-kB repressor IkBa in response to SeV Cantell HD occurred rapidly and was sustained even in type I IFN receptor KO cells (Ifnar1 2/2 ) ( Fig. 1B and C), while no phosphorylation of IRF3 or IkBa was observed for up to ten hours post-infection with SeV Cantell LD despite equivalent or higher expression of the viral protein Np (Fig. 1D) . Corresponding with the strong activation of transcription factors, Ifnb mRNA was expressed in Ifnar1 2/2 cells infected with SeV Cantell HD (Fig. 1E ). In contrast, type I IFN signaling was required for the cellular response to Newcastle disease virus (NDV), an avian virus that only partially inhibits the type I IFN pathway, triggering the expression of type I IFN and other cytokines in the absence of DVGs.",

For this purpose we used SeV strain 52 that normally does not produce highly immunostimulatory copy-back DVGs [24] . Equivalent infectious units of SeV 52 and SeV 52 plus rDVGs had similar levels of total RNA (Fig. 1F ) but infection with virus containing rDVGs strongly induced the antiviral response while virus that lacked DVGs did not (Fig. 1G) confirming the DVG immunostimulatory activity. In addition, presence of rDVGs significantly reduced the expression of SeV Np mRNA, demonstrating their strong interfering capacity (Fig. 1G) . Notably, mouse embryo fibroblasts lacking the type I IFN receptor expressed Ifnb mRNA in response to SeV 52 containing rDVG (Fig. 1H ) and virus containing rDVGs triggered IRF3 phosphorylation independently of type I IFN feedback (Fig. 1I) , mirroring the response to SeV Cantell HD. Altogether, this evidence conclusively shows that SeV copy-back DVGs confer potent immunostimulatory ability to SeV stocks, independent of type I IFN feedback. Notably, potent Ifnb mRNA expression in response to SeV DVGs was independent of IRF1, IRF5, and IRF8 while only partially dependent on IRF7 (Fig. S2 ). This response was maintained in a variety of cell types (Fig. S3) .",

In contrast, MAVS was not required for the response to herpes simplex virus, which can trigger the host response independently of RLRs (Fig. S4 ). In addition, only DVG RNA, but not standard viral genomes, could be amplified from endogenous RIG-I and MDA5 complexes immunoprecipitated from infected cells (Fig.  S4C ), supporting published evidence that DVGs bind to RIG-I preferentially over the standard viral genomes in infected cells [1] . As predicted, association of DVGs with RLRs correlated with type I IFN induction, but not with the level of virus replication (Fig.  S4D ). Importantly, in addition to the primary role of RIG-I in the response to SeV DVGs, MDA5 participates in the induction of type I IFN in primary mouse lung fibroblasts infected with SeV HD (Fig. S4E) , similar to what we have observed in DCs [23, 27] .",

To test this hypothesis, we first determined if SeV strains that accumulate copy-back DVGs early in infection induced faster Ifnb mRNA expression in vitro than viruses with delayed DVG accumulation. For these experiments we used SeV preparations that did not show immunostimulatory activity or evidence of copy-back DVG accumulation by 2 h post-infection and all the viruses were used at a multiplicity of infection of 1.5 TCID 50 /cell. While standard viral genomes of all the different SeV strains used were detected at all tested time points, copy-back DVGs of different sizes were detected starting at 6 h post-infection in cells infected with SeV Z and at later time points in cells infected with SeV 52, Enders, or Cantell LD in both murine lung epithelial cells (TC-1) and bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) (Fig. 3A and B and data not shown). Sequences of the starred PCR products confirming the amplification of copy-back DVGs are shown in Fig. S5 . Remarkably, accumulation of DVGs was directly associated with phosphorylation of IRF3 (Fig. 3C ) and with the expression of Ifnb mRNA (Fig. 3D ), demonstrating that standard viral genomes alone are not sufficient to initiate this response during infection in vitro and strongly supporting a unique ability of naturally arising DVGs to initiate the cellular antiviral response.",

Reduced virulence of SeV Cantell HD was associated with a stronger stimulation of the host antiviral response as shown by the expression of Ifnb mRNA (Fig. 4C ). To conclusively demonstrate the role of DVGs in diminishing virulence in vivo, we co-infected mice with SeV Cantell LD and purified viral particles containing DVGs (defective particles; DPs). Confirming their critical role, DVGs reduced the pathogenicity of SeV Cantell LD in mice, while UV-inactivated DP particles did not provide significant protection (Figs. 4D-F). Interestingly, infection in the presence of DPs resulted in reduced expression of SeV NP protein in the lung at day 7 post-infection, suggesting that in this system, DPs reduce virulence by interfering with virus replication.",

As shown in Fig. 5C , at 6 h post-infection, YFP was expressed only in the presence of DPs and in a dose-dependent manner, and the YFP expression was lost when UV-treated DPs were used. DPs alone were also able to induce YFP in a dose-dependent manner, albeit at much lower levels than during co-infection with SeV.

The generation of DVGs during virus growth in tissue culture is a highly conserved phenomenon among viruses of different species and is tempting to speculate that DVGs provide an evolutionary advantage to the virus by contributing to the preservation of both the virus and the host. Interestingly, immunostimulatory DVGs result from drastic truncations in the genome of the virus that render it a dead end product unable to persist in the absence of helper virus. It will be relevant to determine how DVGs relate to viral ''quasispecies'' that result from mutations as a consequence of having a viral polymerase with a lower fidelity and processivity [37] . Viral quasispecies have been shown to be essential for viral fitness and virulence [37] . Whether DVGs a tradeoff of this viral polymerase characteristic that enables more rapid virus evolution but makes the virus more vulnerable to innate immune detection remains to be established.",

We speculate that the differential DVG requirement may be explained by the poor adaptation of the avian NDV to grow in mice while the murine SeV is fully adapted to grow in this species. A critical factor of this adaptation is the activity of the virally encoded V and C proteins that effectively block the induction of type I IFNs, as well as the type I IFN-mediated amplification of the type I IFN pathway [38, 39, 40, 41] . As NDV is adapted to grow in birds, its antagonistic proteins are not fully functional in mammalian cells [42] allowing unrestricted production and amplification of type I IFNs. In contrast, the SeV C and V proteins very effectively block the cellular response to SeV [40, 42, 43, 44] and no cellular response is observed unless DVGs are present. Interestingly, in the absence of type I IFN feedback (or of the IFN-inducible transcription factor IRF7) SeV DVGs induce a more potent cellular response compared to NDV, suggesting that DVGs have a unique ability to bypass both virus antagonism and the requirement for IRF7 for strong type I IFN production. We have reported that SeV Cantell HD, but not NDV, has the ability to induce the expression of the viral sensor MDA5 independently of type I IFN feedback [27] , and that MDA5 is involved in the recognition of SeV DVGs ( [23] and data in Fig. S4 ). Although it is unclear why this newly synthetized MDA5 is less susceptible to inhibition by the SeV V protein, preferential binding of DVGs to both RIG-I and MDA5 compared to standard SeV genomes, together with the availability of high levels of MDA5, may explain the strong activation of transcription factors and type I IFN expression in response to DVGs, regardless of type I IFN feedback.",

Notably, viruses containing DVGs have significantly reduced virulence. In a previous study, we reported that a SeV strain with a lower propensity to produce DVGs (SeV 52) persisted longer in the lung than a SeV strain able to produce high levels of DVGs (Cantell) [26] . Consistently, we observed higher levels of viral NP protein at day 7 post-infection in the lung of mice infected with SeV Cantell LD, compared to mice infected with SeV Cantell LD plus DPs (Fig. 4G) . In additional studies, we have not observed significant differences in the rate of SeV-specific T cells in the lung of mice infected with SeV LD alone or in the presence of DPs (data not shown and [26] ). Although interpretation of this observation is complicated by the reduced amount of SeV antigen (NP protein) present in infection with SeV LD plus DPs, we favor the hypothesis that DPs diminish virulence by competing for the viral polymerase, thus interfering with the replication of the standard virus, a well-defined characteristic of DVGs. Additionally, enhanced production of type I IFNs in response to DVGs likely contributes to dampened viral replication.",

Intriguingly, during SeV infections in vivo, accumulation of DVGs of high molecular weight preceded the appearance of low molecular weight DVGs, suggesting that the smaller ones may be secondary to longer defective genomic products. Copy-back DVGs are not transcribed due to their promoter properties [10] , thus their stimulatory activity likely derives solely from their genomic composition. IAV DVGs are truncated versions of one of the genomic segments that have natural complementarity among their 39 and 59 ends providing the theoretical capacity to form structures similar to copy-back DVGs. Notably, it is apparent that both SeV genomic and DVG RNAs have the potential to induce a host response when delivered naked into the cells. Based on our data, we predict that in the context of infection, DVG RNA is more available for detection due to their enhanced rate of replication compared to standard viral genomes (Fig. 2) . Interestingly, we have shown that DVGs have the ability to bypass viral-encoded antagonists of the immune response even upon overexpression of viral antagonistic proteins [24] . It remains to be investigated what is the molecular mechanism behind this DVG property.",

In brief, SeV 52, Enders, Z, and Cantell HD were grown in embryonated hen eggs inoculated with 30,000 medium tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ) for 40 h. SeV Cantell HD TCID 50 was calculated by end point dilution in LLCMK2 cells in the presence of trypsin, as described below [24] . SeV Cantell HD total particles were calculated by end point dilution of hemagglutination of chicken red blood cells. SeV Cantell HD stocks had consistently an infectious:total particle ratio of 5,000-15,000. SeV 52 had an infectious:total particle ratio of 24,472. SeV Enders had an infectious:total particle ratio of 38,746. SeV Z had an infectious:total particle ratio of 391,553. SeV Cantell LD was prepared by inoculating embryonated hen eggs with 3 TCID 50 for 40 h. Under these conditions only 33% of the eggs grew virus. Allantoic fluid from those eggs was pooled and diluted 1/10 6 for subsequent inoculation into embryonated hen eggs in a total volume of 100 ml. Allantoic fluid containing virus (80% of the inoculated eggs) was pooled and tittered as described below. SeV Cantell LD stocks had consistently an infectious:total particle ratio of 100,000-200,000. IAV strain PR8 (LD) was grown by inoculating hen embryonated eggs with 30,000 TCID 50 obtained directly from infected lung homogenates. Allantoic fluid containing the virus was collected 40 h later. Egg's allantoic fluid was snap frozen in an ethanol/dryice bath and stored at 280uC. IAV PR8 containing high dose of DI particles (HD) was kindly provided by Dr. Laurence C. Eisenlohr, V.M.D., Ph.D (Thomas Jefferson University). IAV HD was grown by inoculating hen embryonated eggs with 10,000 pfu of egg-passed virus.

In order to optimize the transcription of the DVG, 3 G residues were introduced downstream of the T7 promoter by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene, CA) using the oligonucleotides 59CCACTAGTTAA-TACGACTCACTATAGGGACCAGACAAGAGTTTAAGAG-39 and 59CTCTTAAACTCTTGTCTGGTCCCTATAGTGAG TCGTATTAACTAGTGG-39. BSR-T7 cells were infected with a moi of approximately 66 of partially inactivated SeV strain 52. Virus inactivation was performed by exposing diluted virus to UV light (254 nm model MRL-58, UVP Upland, CA) for 53 sec at a distance of 9 inches from the light source. Virus inactivation diminished the virus replication rate, while allowing the expression of viral proteins necessary for the replication of DVGs. Cells were incubated at 37uC for 1 h before transfection of 3 mg of vector encoding DVG. Transfection was performed with XtremeGENE transfection reagent (Roche) according to manufacturer instructions. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin, 2% NaCO 3 , 0.5 mg/ml trypsin (Worthington) and 0.1% penicillinstreptomycin (Invitrogen) and incubated in 7% CO 2 at 37uC. Cells and supernatant containing SeV 52 and rDPs were harvested after 48 h and 200 ml of the suspension were inoculated in the allantoic cavity of 10-day embryonated hen eggs (B & E Eggs, Silver Springs, PA). After 40 h allantoic fluid was harvest and 200 ml of undiluted fluid were inoculate in 10-day embryonated eggs for virus growth and egg inoculation was repeated for three consecutive passages. Allantoic fluid from the third passage was quick-frozen in dried ice/ethanol and used for infections. Presence of recombinant DVG was confirmed by PCR. No other DVGs were detected.",
