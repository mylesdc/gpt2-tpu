            "text": "Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), a member of genus Deltacoronavirus, is an emerging swine enteropathogenic coronavirus (CoV). Although outstanding efforts have led to the identification of Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus receptors, the receptor for Deltacoronavirus is unclear. Here, we compared the amino acid sequences of several representative CoVs. Phylogenetic analysis showed that PDCoV spike (S) protein was close to the cluster containing transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), which utilizes porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN) as a functional receptor. Ectopic expression of pAPN in non-susceptible BHK-21 cells rendered them susceptible to PDCoV. These results indicate that pAPN may be a functional receptor for PDCoV infection. However, treatment with APN-specific antibody and inhibitors did not completely block PDCoV infection in IPI-2I porcine intestinal epithelial cells. pAPN knockout in IPI-2I cells completely blocked TGEV infection but only slightly decreased PDCoV infection. Homologous modeling of pAPN with the S1 C-terminal domain (S1-CTD) of PDCoV or TGEV showed that TGEV S1-CTD adopted \u03b2-turns (\u03b21-\u03b22 and \u03b23-\u03b24), forming the tip of a \u03b2-barrel, to recognize pAPN. However, only the top residues in the \u03b21-\u03b22 turn of PDCoV S1-CTD had the possibility to support an interaction with pAPN, and the \u03b23-\u03b24 turn failed to contact pAPN. We also discuss the evolution and variation of PDCoV S1-CTD based on structure information, providing clues to explain the usage of pAPN by PDCoV. Taken together, the results presented herein reveal that pAPN is likely not a critical functional receptor for PDCoV, although it is involved in PDCoV infection.",

Considering the cell membrane localization of APN, pAPN in IPI-2I cells is most likely to affect the step of viral adsorption, invasion or release, each of which occurs on the cell membrane. First, the internalization assay was conducted to analyze the earliest viral entry process. RT-qPCR and western blot showed that viral genome RNA copies and protein levels in IPI-2I-APN KO cells were both lower than those in IPI-2I-APN WT cells (Fig. 6a, b) . To further detect the viral assembly or release, IPI-2I-APN KO and IPI-2I-APN WT cell lines were infected with PDCoV, respectively. At 24 h after infection, the cells and supernatants were separately collected for RT-qPCR . At 24 h after incubation, the inhibitors were removed, and MTT reagents (20 \u03bcL, 5 mg/mL) were added.

Although the two proteins shared similar secondary structure elements, the N-terminus of PDCoV S1-CTD was shorter than that of TGEV, which led to a shorter turn of \u03b21-\u03b22 and of \u03b23-\u03b24 in the PDCoV structure (Fig. 8a, b) . Hence, the homologous model showed that S1-CTD of both PDCoV and TGEV adopted \u03b2-turns (\u03b21-\u03b22 and \u03b23-\u03b24), forming the tip of the \u03b2-barrel to recognize pAPN (Fig. 8c) . For TGEV, residues in the two \u03b2-turns both contacted pAPN comfortably, forming a contact network (Fig. 8c) . Conversely, only the top residues in the \u03b21-\u03b22 turn of PDCoV supported an interaction with pAPN, and the \u03b23-\u03b24 turn failed to contact pAPN (Fig. 8c) , indicating that its contribution to the interaction with pAPN is smaller than that of TGEV.

            "text": "As an emerging swine enteropathogenic CoV and the sole member of the genus Deltacoronavirus that has been successfully isolated by cell culture in vitro, PDCoV is a good model to study deltacoronaviruses. However, very little is known about this emerging virus, including its receptor and infection mechanisms. A recent study showed that the \u03b2-sandwich core structure of PDCoV S1-CTD, which may be responsible for receptor recognition, is similar to that of alphacoronaviruses, which mainly use APN as a cellular receptor 27 . Furthermore, PDCoV in infected pigs was primarily detected in the villous epithelium of the mid-jejunum to ileum 20 . Large amounts of APN are also expressed on the surface of porcine small intestine enterocytes 31 . Thus, in this study, we investigated the role of pAPN in PDCoV infection. Interestingly, ectopic expression of pAPN successfully reestablished PDCoV infection in non-susceptible BHK-21 cells, and pAPN overexpression effectively promoted PDCoV infection in poorly susceptible HeLa cells expressing pAPN. However, pAPN knockout in IPI-2I cells, a cell line that was established from porcine ileum and is highly susceptible to PDCoV infection, did not completely block PDCoV infection. We also performed pAPN knock-down experiments with pAPN-specific siRNA in LLC-PK1 (porcine kidney) cells, and the viral titers were decreased by only 0.6 log in pAPN-knock-down LLC-PK1 cells compared to the LLC-PK1 cells transfected with control siRNA (data not shown). A recent study found no interaction between purified pAPN and PDCoV S1-CTD by dot-blot assay 27 . Although we detected a possible weak interaction with the purified full-length PDCoV S protein and pAPN through molecular sieve analysis, a direct interaction could not be confirmed by pull-down assay (data not shown). In contrast, another CoV, TGEV, which uses pAPN as a functional receptor, failed to infect IPI-2I-APN KO cells, as demonstrated by CPE, viral protein expression, and viral genome replication. These results indicate that pAPN plays a decisive role in TGEV infection and only a contributing role in PDCoV infection in IPI-2I cells. Coincidentally, pAPN was initially identified as a PEDV-binding protein in swine kidney cells by virus overlay protein binding assay, and non-susceptible cell lines expressing pAPN became susceptible to PEDV 40, 41 . However, more recent evidence showed that pAPN knockout did not decrease PEDV infection, and no interaction between PEDV S1 and pAPN was detected, implying that pAPN is not a functional receptor for PEDV entry 37 . Thus, whether pAPN promotes PDCoV or PEDV infection through direct interaction with S protein or along with other cellular proteins requires further investigation.",

            "text": "CoV S proteins contribute to the first step of viral infection and seem to be a vital determinant of host range and tissue tropism. Considering that pAPN is a functional receptor for TGEV, but not for PDCoV, we analyzed differences between PDCoV and TGEV S protein structures. In general, S protein S1 subunits, which contain two independent, functional subdomains S1-NTD and S1-CTD, mediate viral entry into cells during CoV infection. Although MHV S1-NTD is reported to recognize sugar receptors and a unique protein receptor carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 34 , protein receptor recognition for most CoVs depends on S1-CTD 46 . In particular, APN receptor in several alphacoronaviruses, such as TGEV and PRCV, interacts with S1-CTD 35 . Understanding the differences between S1-CTD structures of various CoVs is helpful to explain the role of pAPN in viral infection. Therefore, we analyzed the possible recognition of pAPN by PDCoV and TGEV S1-CTD. We found that the \u03b21-\u03b22 and \u03b23-\u03b24 turns in TGEV S1-CTD strongly supported its interaction with pAPN. However, for PDCoV S1-CTD, only residues at the top of the \u03b21-\u03b22 turn contacted pAPN. The markedly shorter \u03b21-\u03b22 and \u03b23-\u03b24 turns in PDCoV S1-CTD may cause insufficient contact with pAPN during viral attachment. These findings may help explain the limited role of pAPN in PDCoV infection. PDCoV can be detected in other tissues of infected pigs 1, 4, 10, 47 , suggesting that another, unidentified protein may contribute to the PDCoV recognition and entry processes. In addition, the S gene of CoV has been shaped by recombination and positive selection that may have led to changes in receptorbinding affinity 48, 49 . For example, isolated MERS-CoV strains from a recent outbreak in South Korea had point mutations in S1-CTD and showed decreased binding ability to the cellular receptor 50 . A highly neurotropic MHV JHMV strain infected host cells through a carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 receptor-independent manner 51 . However, whether the evolution of PDCoV S1-CTD is responsible for the shorter \u03b21-\u03b22 and \u03b23-\u03b24 turns and impaired ability to use pAPN requires further investigation. Moreover, the receptor-binding region of CTD is believed to bear mainly Fig. 8 Homologous modeling of PDCoV or TGEV S1-CTD with pAPN. a Sequence alignment was conducted with PDCoV S1-CTD (GenBank accession no. ALS54086.1) and TGEV S1-CTD (GenBank accession no. ADY39740.1). The secondary structures of S1-CTD were analyzed using the ESPript website (http://espript.ibcp.fr/ESPript/ESPript/index.php). b, c The three-dimensional structures of PDCoV S1-CTD (yellow; PDB ID 6B7N), TGEV S1-CTD (red; PDB ID 4F2M), and pAPN (blue; PDB ID 4F5C) obtained from the Protein Data Bank were analyzed with PyMOL software epitopes recognized by CoV neutralizing antibodies 35, 50, 52, 53 . Thus, the receptor-binding regions of CoVs are under selective pressure from the host immune system. We speculate that the shorter \u03b21-\u03b22 and \u03b23-\u03b24 turns in PDCoV S1-CTD compared with TGEV S1-CTD may be the result of positive immune pressure from the host. Conformational changes help PDCoV to evade host immune surveillance, while the ability of PDCoV to hijack pAPN may be impaired. These findings imply that a yet unidentified receptor may be utilized by PDCoV in the process of viral evolution and variation.",

However, whether pAPN promotes PDCoV infection through direct interaction with PDCoV S protein or with the cooperation of other host proteins must be further elucidated. The findings of slight infection in HeLa cells and successful infection in non-susceptible BHK-21 cells expressing hAPN suggest that a possible co-receptor exists in both porcine and human cells, revealing the potential risk for PDCoV cross-species transmission. Therefore, detailed study focused on virus-host interactions and identification of critical functional receptor usage is necessary to increase the understanding of PDCoV infection. ",
