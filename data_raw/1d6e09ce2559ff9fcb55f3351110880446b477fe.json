Knockdown of these proteins demonstrated their function as viral host factors, with evidence for some factors acting early, while others late in infection. Their requirement by DENV for efficient amplification is likely specific, since protein knockdown did not impair the cell fitness for viral amplification of an unrelated virus. The protein abundances of these host factors were not significantly altered during DENV infection, suggesting their interaction with DENV RNA was due to specific recruitment mechanisms. However, at the global proteome level, DENV altered the abundances of proteins in particular classes, including transporter proteins, which were down regulated, and proteins in the ubiquitin proteasome pathway, which were up regulated.",

However, only a handful of DENV host factors are known. This study reports identification of 79 novel dengue RNA binding proteins using a largescale analysis of cellular proteins that interact with the DENV RNA during a live infection in human cells. Importantly, this analysis proved to have a remarkably low false discovery rate and the confirmed host factors appear to be specific to DENV without compromising the fitness of the cell for viral amplification of other unrelated viruses. Furthermore, these host factors were shown to be required at both early and late stages of the viral life cycle, consistent with the dynamic nature of dengue viral RNA.",

It has a 5' cap, no poly(A) tail, highly structured 5'-and 3'-untranslated regions (UTR), and a single open reading frame (ORF) [reviewed in [3] ]. Following virus entry, the viral RNA is released into the cytoplasm. Viral translation and replication occur in membranous assembly \"factories\" localized in the perinuclear region of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) [4] . The positivestranded RNA molecules are encapsidated; virions are further processed as they are transported through the secretory pathway to the cell surface and released extracellularly [reviewed in [3] ]. In addition to the viral proteins, cellular proteins, termed host factors, participate in most, if not all, steps of the DENV life cycle, including entry, translation, replication, virion assembly, and release [5] . Since viruses require host factors for efficient amplification, targeting host factors can provide an effective antiviral target for which the virus has no genetic control over. Therefore, it may be more difficult for viruses to evolve escape mutants that can replicate efficiently in the absence of the host factor [5, 6] .",

            "text": "Several cellular proteins are known to impact DENV infection. For example, the polypyrimidine-tract-binding protein (PTBP1) is relocalized from the nucleus to the cytoplasm following DENV infection where it enhances DENV amplification by binding to the DENV 3'UTR and to NS4A, a viral protein required for the formation of the viral replication complex [7] [8] [9] [10] . PTBP1 may also stimulate DENV translation [8] , although this is still controversial [7, 9] . While most of the known DENV RNA binding proteins enhance viral amplification, several reduce DENV titers [10] [11] [12] . One such factor, YBX1, inhibits viral translation [12] . Although previous studies have laid a foundation for establishing critical interactions between viral RNA and cellular proteins [ [13] and reviewed in [14] ], the host factors identified thus far likely represent only a fraction of the total network of DENV host factors. Previously, we have described a high-throughput mass spectrometry method termed TUX-MS (thiouracil cross-linking mass spectrometry) to identify host factors that interact with viral RNA during a live infection in cell culture [15] . Importantly, TUX-MS allows for identification of proteins that are bound directly to the viral RNA in living cells. Briefly, during a viral infection in cell culture, thiouridine is biosynthetically incorporated into the viral RNA to serve as a zero-distance cross-linker upon exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light. Thus, proteins that are bound directly to the viral RNA during a live infection are cross-linked to the RNA prior to disruption of cellular compartmentalization. This is particularly valuable for the identification of DENV host proteins, since DENV amplification is tightly associated with cellular membrane structures [4] . Following cross-linking, the viral RNA together with cross-linked proteins are isolated under denaturing conditions and identified by mass spectrometry-based proteomics. Using TUX-MS, we reported previously the successful identification and validation of host factors for poliovirus, pointing to a low false discovery rate of < 12% [15] .",

            "text": "Development of a quantitative thiouridine cross-linking mass spectrometry (qTUX-MS) method for identification of proteins associated with the DENV RNA TUX-MS can be used to identify host factors by incorporating 4-thiouridine (4sU), a zero-distance cross-linker, into the viral RNA (vRNA) to enable cross-linking of proteins bound to vRNA during a live infection in cell culture [15] . Cross-linking is carried out under physiological conditions prior to cell lysis to ensure specificity and reduce false-positives from non-specific RNA protein interactions that occur upon loss of compartmentalization. vRNA is isolated under denaturing conditions and cross-linked proteins are identified using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). To improve quantification of the TUX-MS identified host proteins (qTUX-MS), a SILAC (stable isotope-labelled amino acids in cell culture) approach [16] was used to label the uninfected (mock) and infected cells with either 'heavy' or 'light' amino acids, respectively ( Fig 1A) . When 4-thiouracil (4TU) is present in the medium, Huh7.5 UPRT human hepatoma cell lines stably expressing UPRT (uracil phosphoribosyltransferase) convert 4TU to UMP. Then, the UMP is converted to thiouridine triphosphate (4sUTP) by cellular kinases [22] . Both cellular and viral RNA polymerases use 4sUTP as a substrate during RNA synthesis, which serves as a zero-distance cross-linker, covalently binding proteins to RNAs upon exposure to long wave UV-light. Importantly, protein-protein crosslinking is very inefficient at long UV wavelengths, ensuring that only proteins in direct contact with the reactive thiol group of the 4sU-containing RNA will be cross-linked [23] . We have shown previously that immunoisolation of candidate vRNA-binding proteins identified by TUX-MS (and confirmed by western) could be specifically co-isolated with viral RNA [15] . Together, this study established that TUX-MS can identify bona fide interactions between host proteins and viral RNA. The TUX-MS method was originally developed to capture polyadenylated RNA using oligo(dT) beads [15] . However, as DENV RNA is not polyadenylated, we modified the method to use sequence specific capture of the vRNA using magnetic beads. Following crosslinking in Huh7.5 UPRT cells infected with DENV at 28 hpi and affinity capture of the vRNA, the ribonucleoprotein complexes were eluted from the beads, 'heavy' and 'light' eluates were mixed, and RNase A was used to degrade the RNA. The proteins were digested insolution with trypsin and subjected to quantitative MS-based proteomics ( Fig 1B) . The median 'light' to 'heavy' peptide and protein ratios were calculated, reflecting the specificity of vRNAprotein capture. We identified several classes of proteins, including DENV proteins, known DENV host factors, and putative RNA-interacting host proteins, but most of the qTUX-MS identified factors have not been previously identified through interactions with DENV (S2 Table) .",

Therefore, we opted for a conservative cut-off at 50%, representing twice this median value or 1.5-fold. Common environmental and non-human cell culture contaminants were excluded, since they existed in only the 'light' SILAC state. In addition, our qTUX-MS samples also contained histones: H3, H4, H2A, H2B, H1.5 and macroH2A.1. In a previous study, histones were shown to play roles in dengue infection [28] . However, their functions were mediated through an interaction with a viral capsid protein and were shown to be independent of RNA. In addition, histones are primarily nuclear and highly abundant proteins commonly detected (> 50%) in control affinity purifications compiled across diverse protein-protein interaction studies [29] . For these reasons, histones likely represent non-specific associations rather than DENV RNA binding factors, and thus were excluded from further analysis. In total, 93 cellular proteins passed these selection criteria, 79 of which have not been previously shown to associate with DENV (S2 Table, S1 Dataset). Several of the known DENV host factors were enriched but did not meet the stringent inclusion criteria (S2 Table) , suggesting that there may be additional host factors below our enrichment threshold (see S1 Dataset). Importantly, the subset of 79 host factors represents a significant potential expansion in the number of known DENV host factors, providing a valuable resource to test for pro-viral or antiviral activities during DENV infection.",

To address this, we used SILAC-MS to quantify proteome (i.e., total protein abundance) changes following DENV infection. Comparison of qTUX-MS and proteome SILAC ratios showed that the protein abundances for the 93 qTUX-MS-identified vRNA-binding factors remained largely unchanged (Fig 2A, S1 Fig and  S1 Dataset). On average, for these proteins, the DENV-induced changes in whole cell abundance were \u00b11.1-fold, suggesting that their identification by qTUX-MS was not due to an increase in their abundance in the cell following DENV infection. Noteworthy, a retrospective qualitative comparison of the qTUX-MS identified factors for DENV with those identified in the TUX-MS analysis on poliovirus revealed less than 10% were identified for both viruses [15] ( Fig 2B) . Since the identified proteins are largely DENV specific, qTUX-MS is not biased towards identifying a sub-set of cellular RNA binding proteins. Taken together, our results indicate that the enrichment ratios measured by qTUX-MS is predominantly due to their specific association with the DENV RNA.",

            "text": "While proteins that bound DENV RNA did not show significant changes in abundance upon infection, we performed bioinformatics analysis on the complete proteome dataset of whole cell abundance to determine the global proteome effects of DENV infection under these conditions. In total, 4,907 host proteins were quantified by SILAC MS in biological duplicates (S1 Dataset). The abundance ratios between biological duplicates were reproducible, with only~2% of the ratios varying by > 50% (Fig 3A) . From these duplicates, an average abundance ratio was calculated and the respective proteins were analyzed by PANTHER gene enrichment analysis (S2 Fig) [20] . This analysis found systematic up regulation of proteins in the ubiquitin proteasome pathway (UPP), comprising 18 members of the 26S proteasome as well as various ubiquitinconjugating enzymes (S3 Fig). Many of these enzymes are linked to ubiquitin-dependent proteasome degradation, consistent with the current knowledge that the UPP is important for production of infectious virions [31, 33, 34 ]. Yet, other enzymes, such UBE2N and UBE2V2, catalyze polyubiquitination at Lys-63, which does not lead to proteasome degradation but rather participates in transcriptional activation of target genes and may promote innate immune signaling [35, 36] . In contrast, proteins in the transporter protein class were on average down regulated (Fig 3B and S2 Fig). Assembly of the annotated proteins into Reactome protein networks identified several subnetworks with various transporter activities (S4 Fig). While the abundances of mitochondrial transporters and nucleoporins were the most consistently decreased, not all transporters were down regulated; for example, the lipoprotein (APO) transporters were increased in expression (Fig 3C) . Interestingly, the RNA binding protein class was significantly down regulated (Fig 3B and S2 Fig) , though the effect was not as pronounced as the transporter class (Fig 3B) . The overall down-regulation of RNA binding proteins appears to be driven by changes in cytoplasmic and mitochondrial ribosomal subunits, and proteins involved in RNA degradation and processing (S5 Fig). Nevertheless, the relative protein abundance for the set of 93 (known and putative) DENV binding factors identified by qTUX-MS was largely unchanged, despite being enriched in RNA processing and translation factors (Fig  2A) . Overall, the quantitative proteome analysis suggests that DENV selectively alters the abundance of proteins, and reveals several pathways that could be directly or indirectly modulated in the host response to DENV infection.",

We have randomly selected six qTUX-MS identified host proteins with functions in RNA processing/translation, which were enhanced in the DENV sample ranging from 1.32-to 2.26-fold (DENV/mock). Thus, by validating factors that are only modestly enhanced in the qTUX-MS analysis this will indicate if the qTUX-MS identified factors that are near the cut-off of 1.5-fold are bona fide host factors or not. We assessed the effect of siRNA knockdown of these factors (Fig 5A) on viral production. HeLa UPRT cells were used for siRNA silencing experiments due to higher siRNA transfection efficiency compared with Huh7.5 UPRT cells. Knockdown of five out of six qTUX-MS identified candidates: Non-POU domain-containing octamer-binding protein (NONO), Embryonic stem cell-specific 5-hydroxymethylcytosine-binding protein (HMCES), RBMX (RNA-binding motif protein, X chromosome), hnRNP M and hnRNP F significantly decreased DENV production, while knockdown of hnRNP L had no effect on DENV titer ( Fig  5B; S5 Fig) . Knockdown of PTBP1, a positive control [7, 8] , also resulted in decreased viral titers (Fig 5) . For negative controls, we selected two RNA binding proteins (DDX39 and hnRNP A0) that were not identified by qTUX-MS. DENV titers were not altered following silencing of these two proteins, suggesting that only specific RNA binding proteins are used by DENV. Altogether, our data suggests that RBMX, NONO, HMCES, hnRNP M, hnRNP F are required for viral production. These results demonstrate that qTUX-MS is a robust method with a low false discovery rate for high-throughput identification of viral host factors.",

As a positive control, knockdown of G3BP2 did reduce cell fitness, as previously shown (S6 Fig) [37] . To more rigorously rule out any potential effects of host factor knockdown on cell fitness that would affect viral amplification, an unrelated virus (adenovirus 5), was amplified following knockdowns of the candidate factors. Adenovirus 5 replication was not significantly decreased by RBMX, NONO, hnRNP M, hnRNP F or HMCES siRNA knockdown (Fig 5B and S6C Fig) demonstrating that knockdown of these factors does not affect cell fitness for viral amplification.

As a positive control, knockdown of PTBP1, which is required for DENV replication [7] , reduced DENV RNA levels. Similarly, the intracellular vRNA levels were reduced in cells knocked down for either hnRNP F, RBMX or HMCES. The decrease in dengue RNA levels (Fig 6) is consistent with the decrease in viral titers ( Fig  5B) . Thus, hnRNP F, RBMX or HMCES are required for the early steps in the viral replication cycle, such as translation, replication or RNA stability. In contrast, knockdown of hnRNP M and NONO did not change intracellular viral RNA levels despite the dramatic decrease in viral titers, suggesting they may play a role downstream of replication. Altogether, we have identified and validated five novel host factors for DENV, demonstrating that qTUX-MS can identify factors that function at different stages of the virus life cycle.",

Since diagnostic tests can detect DENV infection at early stages, administration of antivirals could significantly improve survival rates as viral load is correlated with symptom severity [38] . Using antivirals that target host factors may limit the appearance of drug-resistant viruses and may be effective for all DENV serotypes and possibly for multiple flaviviruses [5, 6, 39, 40] . The qTUX-MS analysis identified 79 novel cellular proteins, for which the majority are distinct from those previously identified for poliovirus using a similar approach [15] . This suggests that unrelated RNA viruses have evolved to utilize distinct host RNA binding proteins. Interestingly, PTBP1 and NONO, which were identified in both the poliovirus and DENV TUX-MS analyses, were shown to be required for production of both viruses (this study, Figs 5 and 6) [15, 41, 42] . Further analysis of virus-specific and shared host factors will reveal whether unrelated viruses utilize similar or diverse mechanisms to control viral RNA replication, processing and packaging within cells. The host factors that enhance amplification of both poliovirus and dengue, (Fig 2B) could serve as attractive targets for the development of broad-spectrum antivirals.",

Importantly, the vast majority of these factors have established roles in viral infections or in modulating the antiviral host response to various viruses [53] [54] [55] [56] , including DENV (S2 Table and references within). Our study establishes that RBMX (hnRNP G), hnRNP F and hnRNP M are required for efficient DENV amplification (Fig 5B) . Since several hnRNPs, such as PTBP1 (hnRNP I), hnRNP A1 and hnRNP K, were previously shown to re-localize from the nucleus to the viral replication sites during DENV infection [8, 57, 58] , RBMX, hnRNP F, hnRNP M and possibly other nuclear qTUX-MS identified factors are also likely to be either actively recruited to the viral replication sites or retained in the cytoplasm upon DENV infection. Interestingly, the qTUX-MS identified hnRNPs affect different steps in the DENV life cycle (Fig 6) , suggesting that they have distinct functions during infection. This is consistent with studies that have suggested that DENV RNA structures are dynamic during the viral life cycle [59] and may suggest that host factors play an important role in these structural changes. Furthermore, we showed that knockdown of some hnRNPs (hnRNP A0 and hnRNP L) did not affect dengue viral titers significantly demonstrating that only certain hnRNPs are required for DENV amplification. Since some of hnRNPs are known to modulate cellular gene expression in response to dengue infection [60, 61] , we can not rule out that some of the observed effects on virus titers derive from their roles in regulating host mRNAs.",

While the cellular role of human HMCES is currently unknown, the mouse homologue was suggested to be an RNAbinding protein and predicted to contain a putative peptidase domain [62, 63] . Interestingly, it is possible that the nucleic acid binding domain enhances the protease activity or visa versa as has been shown for other such proteins [64] [65] [66] . For example, Adenovirus uses a nucleic acid binding protease to localize the protease activity to the viral substrates [64] . It has been suggested that the protease is recruited to the empty capsid as an inactive protease, then it becomes fully activated once bound to the viral DNA inside the virion. Using the DNA as a guide wire, it moves along the nucleic acid, searching for capsid and core proteins to cleave, which is required to render the viral particle infectious [64, 67, 68] . However, since we observed that knockdown of HMCES resulted in a decrease in viral RNA, it seems more likely that it might participate in translation, replication or the switch from translation to replication as has been shown for other nucleic acid binding proteases [65, 69] .",

Our analysis of the host cell proteome upon infection also revealed interesting changes, including up regulation of proteins in the ubiquitin pathway and down regulation of transporter proteins. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is one of two major cellular pathways used to degrade 80 to 90% of proteins. Previous studies on DENV infected cell lines and patient samples showed that the ubiquitin pathway was upregulated [31, 39, 70] . Many groups have consistently shown that the ubiquitin proteasome pathway is critical for amplification of a number of flaviruses, including DENV and West Nile virus [31, 34, 71, 72] . However, it remains controversial as to which step in viral amplification is affected by ubiquitination, but it appears to be early during internalization or viral genome release [33, 39, 73] . Further studies will be required to understand how DENV up-regulates the pathway and the mechanism that ubiquitination has in DENV amplification.",

            "text": "Altogether, our study has significantly increased the number of cellular proteins known to interact with the DENV RNA during a live infection in cells. We have also placed these interactions in the context of proteome abundance changes in the infected cells. A recent study by Phillips and colleagues [13] exploited a cross-linking label-free MS approach to identify DENV RNA associating proteins in cell culture by cross-linking the RNA to the proteins using short wavelength UV light and isolating DENV RNA bound proteins by anti-sense DNA affinity capture [74] . While their method identified several DENV host factors [12, [75] [76] [77] , the qTUX-MS method reported here resulted in improved identification of known dengue host factors and putative DENV RNA interacting proteins. There could be several reasons for these results, such as, the qTUX-MS approach achieves greater cross-linking efficiency by using long wave UV light to form crosslinks to 4-thio-uridines compared to short-wavelength UV light, which is inherently inefficient [78] . Moreover, since thio-uridine is a zero distance cross-linker for RNA-bound proteins at long UV wavelengths and protein-protein cross-links are not formed at long UV wavelengths, qTUX-MS may also have achieved improved specificity, as only proteins in direct contact with the viral RNA would be captured [23] . Additionally, qTUX-MS used an MS-based SILAC approach to determine which host proteins were specifically enriched in the vRNA isolations versus mock. Though isotope-labelling is not applicable in all model systems, it does afford greater quantitative accuracy compared to label-free MS strategies [16] .",

Importantly, five out of the six qTUX-MS identified novel factors that were tested were shown to be bona fide host factors. We used robust assays to show that the identified host factors were specifically required for DENV amplification and did not merely result in a decrease in cell fitness for viral amplification. Future studies will reveal whether the identified factors may also be required for other flavivirus infections that cause life-threatening illnesses, such as yellow fever, West Nile, Zika, Japanese and tick-borne encephalitis. Therefore, our data demonstrates that qTUX-MS is an effective technique for identifying novel virus host factors that can be used for a broad spectrum of RNA viruses by simply designing antisense DNA oligonucleotides to allow for efficient sequence-specific isolation of the vRNA.",

Clusters were labelled with the transporter classes and/or activities represented by the majority of proteins within that cluster. (TIF) S5 Fig. Protein network associated with the RNA protein binding PANTHER protein class clustered by Reactome relationships (top) and overlaid with log2 DENV/Mock relative abundance changes (bottom). PANTHER gene enrichment classified 523 proteins annotated as RNA binding proteins, which on average were significantly down regulated upon DENV infection. The corresponding genes were analyzed by the Reactome Functional Interaction (FI) Cytoscape plug-in. Six sub-networks ( 3 genes per network) were assembled with modes colors representing functional clustering by Reactome FI (top) or log2 DENV/Mock relative abundance changes (bottom). Network edges represent Reactome functional interactions:-, protein complex; !, activating;-|, inhibiting; -, predicted. Clusters were labelled with the transporter classes and/or activities represented by the majority of proteins within that cluster.
