Mutations impairing the ability to stimulate IFN secretion or to recognize and adequately respond to IFNs have drastic consequences in terms of exaggerated pathogen susceptibility and increased tumor frequencies. Mice harboring targeted mutations in central components of the IFN system succumb to experimental infections with various pathogens even at very low doses of infection (sometimes in the range of the respective detection limit or even below), while wild-type animals easily survive infections with high numbers of the same pathogen (1, 2) . Human individuals suffering from similar mutations have been identified-often due to overt morbidity and mortality after infection with attenuated live vaccine viruses or otherwise mild and/or opportunistic agents (3) . The importance of IFNs in control of tumors is evident from the findings that mice lacking functional IFN systems are more prone to spontaneous tumor development and increased tumor burden in experimental models (4) (5) (6) as well as from the fact that loss-of-function mutations become enriched in genes coding for central mediators of the IFN system during tumor development (e.g., in the case of melanoma) (7, 8) indicating a pronounced selection pressure elicited by the IFN system.",

Upon binding of the IFN-I to their cognate receptor complex, the Janus kinases phosphorylate the intracellular domains of the receptor chains thereby generating binding sites for signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 1 and STAT2. After the STATs bound the receptors, they become phosphorylated by Tyk2 and Jak1 at a specific tyrosine residue located around amino acid position 700 (Y701 in the case of STAT1). Due to intramolecular interactions between the phosphorylated tyrosine residue of one STAT molecule with the src homology 2 domain of the second STAT molecule and vice versa, an active heterodimer forms. Previous models often implied a de novo interaction of monomeric STAT proteins upon phosphorylation, whereas recent work argues in favor of preformed STAT dimers (10, 11) which change their conformation and orientation upon activation (12) (13) (14) . Together with IFN regulatory factor 9 (IRF9), STAT1, and STAT2 form active heterotrimers called IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) which translocate into the nucleus, bind to specific DNA enhancer elements [called IFNstimulated response elements (ISREs)] and induce the expression of adjacent genes. The binding and recognition of DNA is mediated by both STATs and the IRF9 molecule. Consistently, the central part of the ISRE consensus resembles an IRF DNA binding site (also called IRF-E site) (15) . Type III IFNs have been shown to bind to a distinct receptor complex which is only expressed in certain tissues, but to induce an IFN-I-like signaling and thereby a similar transcriptional ISRE response (16, 17) . Hence, type I and type III IFNs can be grouped according to the activation of ISGF3 transcription factor complexes inducing genes harboring ISRE promoter/enhancer elements.",

Beneath this receptor proximal signaling events, cross-talk can also be induced down-stream by induction of a second layer of transcription factors (e.g., IRFs): IFN\u03b3 strongly induces IRF1 which in turn can enhance genes harboring IRF-E sites. Since the central part of ISRE elements resembles an IRF-E site, IFN\u03b3 can stimulate several IFN-I responsive genes indirectly via IRFs like IRF1. Given these descriptions of overlap and crosstalk between the signaling cascades, it is surprising that both cytokines are thought to induce different biological responses: IFN-I (and IFN-III) are believed to induce a direct antiviral activity, whereas IFN\u03b3 is mainly considered as stimulator of adaptive immune responses (e.g., by enhancing antigen presentation).",

To cope with the issue of less accurate quantification results based on single peptide quantifications (32, 33) , we determined individual coefficients of variation (CVs) for each protein represented by a single unique peptide. Single peptide quantifications with large deviations indicated by an averaged CV >50% were excluded. A comparison of the median CVs showed that this revised group of proteins with single peptide quantification exhibits the same variation as observed for proteins quantified with two peptides (see Figure S1 in Supplementary Material).

After 4 h of IFN exposure, IFN\u03b1 treatment led to a higher number of proteins being upregulated when compared with IFN\u03b3 (45 versus 27 proteins). In clear contrast, after 24 and 48 h, the number of upregulated proteins is five to eight times higher in the case of IFN\u03b3 (55 versus 436 at 24 h). We also observed several proteins which were significantly downregulated. In this respect, the difference between IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3 was even more pronounced, since such protein regulations were clearly more prominent upon IFN\u03b3 treatment. Functional annotations of all proteins being significantly and at least twofold regulated by IFN\u03b1 or IFN\u03b3 were performed for each investigated time point. The obtained results display a broad spectrum of associated molecular functions, biological processes and cellular components (see Figures S2-S4 in Supplementary Material). As expected, for both IFN types, IFN signaling (and several related or similar gene ontologies called, e.g., \"defense response to virus\") was found as a highly enriched biological process among the upregulated proteins. Additionally, several biological processes associated with antigen presentation via MHC-I were found to be enriched among proteins induced by both IFNs after prolonged exposure. In the particular case of IFN\u03b3, the obtained results furthermore indicate, that a broad spectrum of diverse biological processes are altered. This is in line with the expectations based on the tremendously higher number of proteins being regulated by IFN\u03b3 when compared with IFN\u03b1. In addition, the dynamic nature of cellular proteome modulations is nicely demonstrated by the enrichment of particular biological processes among up-and downregulated proteins at various time points. For example, different translational processes were found highly enriched among IFN\u03b3-repressed proteins at 24 h, whereas the same processes were enriched in the IFN\u03b3-induced group of proteins at 48 h (see Supplementary Material).",

Consistent with the notion that STAT1 and STAT2 are IFN-responsive themselves [e.g., Ref. (35) and others], both proteins became also upregulated during IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3 exposure.

Depending on the nature of the respective pathogen, prominent discrepancies concerning the direct antiviral activity have been documented [e.g., (38) ]. According to an oversimplified textbook concept, IFN\u03b1 acts directly antiviral (e.g., by inducing effector proteins such as Mx, PKR, and OAS), whereas IFN\u03b3 modulates adaptive immune responses for example by stimulating MHC expression. Such differences should be reflected by non-overlapping changes in the proteome. Therefore, IFN type-specific complementarities were analyzed on qualitative level to elucidate to which extent both IFNs regulate common as well as distinct sets of proteins. To this end, lists of proteins exhibiting significant at least twofold up-and downregulations after treatment with IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3, respectively, were compared for each time point of analysis. The results are shown in Figure 2A . 75 proteins were only repressed by IFN\u03b3 and 11 proteins only by IFN\u03b1 after 4 h of treatment. At later time points, the majority of proteins being IFN\u03b1 responsive were also responsive to IFN\u03b3. On top of these commonly responsive proteins, IFN\u03b3 was capable to specifically upregulate additional proteins (393 and 267) after 24 and 48 h of treatment. Concerning downregulated proteins, this trend was even more pronounced: after 24 and 48 h, only 2 and 1 protein, respectively, were significantly and at least twofold repressed by IFN\u03b1, whereas IFN\u03b3 also repressed these proteins plus 185 and 110 additional proteins, respectively (Figure 2A) . Beside this qualitative assessment, our approach also allows direct quantitative comparisons of IFN\u03b1-and IFN\u03b3-induced changes by means of correlation analyses. Therefore, we compared the strength of regulation by IFN\u03b1 in relation to the strength of regulation by IFN\u03b3 in scatter plots ( Figure 2B) . In contrast to the previous analysis, all proteins showing significantly altered abundances upon IFN-treatment were included irrespective of the fold change. Linear regression analyses for the investigated time points are shown in Figure 2B . For each time point, proteins being at least twofold regulated by both IFN types showed identical regulation direction-as indicated by the apparent lack of proteins in quadrants II and IV ( Figure 2B) . With only few exceptions, most proteins being specifically regulated at least twofold by one IFN type exhibit a consistent and significant trend upon treatment with the other IFN. However, in the latter case, fold change criteria are often not fulfilled. Regarding the strength of regulations, at 4 h posttreatment the slope of the regression line (~1) indicates that both IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3 have comparable inductive or repressive effects. As indicated by slopes above 1, at 24 and 48 h, protein regulations induced by IFN\u03b3 are more pronounced than the corresponding regulations by IFN\u03b1.",

Thus, the discrepancy in efficacy against different agents must also be reflected in the differential expression of the relevant restriction factors. Based on the global data set, we chose prototypic examples of IFN-responsive proteins with documented antipathogenic activity to highlight that certain proteins are similarly responsive to both IFNs, whereas other are either more IFN\u03b1 or IFN\u03b3 inducible. Although some classical antiviral genes such as Mx1 and PKR responded more to IFN\u03b1, considerable induction became also evident upon IFN\u03b3 treatment (Figure 5, left panel) . A second set of proteins with previously shown antiviral activity against viruses such as HIV and influenza [e.g., BST2/Tetherin, SAMHD1, and IFIT3 (40-42)] were similarly responsive to both IFNs (Figure 5, middle panel) . Most interestingly, a third class of proteins which was more or even almost exclusively responsive to IFN\u03b3 contained proteins such as IDO, GBP5, and PML ( Figure 5 , right panel) which are known to confer antiviral activity (43) (44) (45) .",

To our knowledge, we present the first study in which global proteome alteration induced by type I and II IFNs were directly compared in the same cells at different time points.

This discrepancy is highlighted by the fact that individual IFNs are approved for the treatment of defined diseases, whereas other IFNs are not. Based on the wealth of information on cross-talk between the signaling cascades and the overlapping responsiveness of certain ISGs, this biological difference was rather puzzling. However, our comparative analysis of the global changes within proteomes is fully consistent with this discrepancy: in terms of quality, quantity, and kinetics, IFNinduced changes differ significantly between IFN-I and IFN-II. This effect was most apparent for repressed proteins which were almost exclusively observed in response to IFN\u03b3. Interestingly, although our data uncovers remarkable differences between IFN classes and incubation times, the simple dichotomy that ISRE-activating IFNs (types I and III) act directly antiviral, whereas the GAS-activating IFN\u03b3 acts immunemodulatory is clearly oversimplified: IFN\u03b3 induces several direct antiviral effector proteins at least as strong as IFN\u03b1 or even stronger.

However, these antibodies recognize their cognate antigens with different affinities resulting in an unavoidable bias in the comparative quantification of different proteins. Similarly, MS-based determinations rely on different peptides with non-overlapping characteristics during identification and quantification. For our analysis, we used saturating IFN concentrations. Depending on the ISG and IRepG subsets, we observed pronounced responses either to IFN\u03b1 (see Figure 5 , left panel), to IFN\u03b3 (Figure 5 , right panel) or both IFNs (Figure 5, central panel) indicating the perceptiveness of the cells. In addition, our finding that the differential responses (e.g., gene repression of IRepGs stimulated by IFN\u03b3 but not by IFN\u03b1) were observed on different levels (protein and mRNA), in different species (mouse and human) and in different cell types (macrophages and fibroblasts) suggest that the herein described differences are rather common.

This was consistent with previously described SP1/SP3 dependency of individual genes shown to be repressed by IFN\u03b3 (52) . Despite the lack of ISRE and GAS sequences, IRepG repression was largely lost in STAT1-deficient fibroblasts, suggesting that gene repression by IFN\u03b3 is a mostly neglected ability of its \"signature\" transcription factor STAT1. The data immediately raised two important questions: ( This poses the important future question concerning the biological significance(s) of these IRepGs in terms of the response to pathogens and tumors. It is not difficult to imagine that the IFN-induced downregulation of proteins which are required for the replication of certain pathogens or tumors might have benefits for the host-simply by withholding essential cofactors, e.g., the entry receptor of an intracellular pathogen to prevent its infection. Viruses also rely on numerous intracellular factors and metabolic capabilities of the host cell to allow their own replication. One unifying feature of viruses is their lack of ribosomes and thus their inability to translate proteins outside of host cells. Consistently, the translational machinery is one major battleground between pathogens and host, and several ISGs (e.g., PKR, ISG54, and ISG56) target translation [reviewed in Ref. (55) ]. A downregulation of proteins required for translation (or other essential metabolic pathways such as ATP synthesis) might limit the replication of pathogens. Consistently, we observed that, e.g., eIF2A, eIF3M, and others were repressed by IFN\u03b3 (see Data Sheet S1 in Supplementary Material). Thus, it seems that IRepGs contribute to the restriction of the translational machinery. The seemingly suicidal aspect of such repression might be overcome by strictly controlled (down-) regulation by IFNs upon infection.",

One protein which was downregulated is fatty acid synthase FASN (protein ID P49327, Figure 6B) . From different studies, FASN is known to be required for the replication of hepatitis C virus, dengue virus, respiratory syncytial virus, human parainfluenza 3 (PIV3), astrovirus, and rhinovirus replication (56) (57) (58) (59) (60) . Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that suppression of FASN by IFN\u03b3 might reduce the replication of such viruses. Another example is the protein Ergic53 which is required for the replication of Arena, Corona, and Filoviruses (61) , and which we found to be repressed by IFN\u03b3. Functional studies on IRepGs are definitely needed, but a comparison of herein found IRepGs with genes found in at least two of the three published siRNA screens to be required for HIV replication (62) indicate that the family of IRepGs also comprises additional genes required for HIV replication (e.g., IDH1).",

It is well known that IFNs limit their own signaling by stimulating potent mediators of negative feedback loops (e.g., IFN-induced expression of suppressors of cytokine signaling and protein inhibitor of activated STATs). We hypothesize that IRepGs might be weakly IFN responsive but fully responsive to the effects of the negative feedback cascade. We infer that the responsible proteins should be (I) repressors of transcription, (II) IFN-inducible, and (III) able to \"identify\" IRepGs. Beside SP1 and SP3, three promising candidates for such mechanisms are IRF-2, PRDM1, and Bcl6. All three proteins bind to DNA and repress transcription (64) (65) (66) (67) , all are induced by IFN and recognize ISRE, IRF-E, GAS, or similar DNA elements (30, 65, 68, 69) .",

Conversely, 70, 29, and 40 proteins were only differentially regulated at one particular time point.

Additionally, IFN\u03b3 induces a change in the composition of the proteasome from the constitutive proteasome to the so called immune proteasome by stimulating an exchange of three subunits (PSMB5, 6, and 7) by three alternative subunits [namely PSBM8 (LMP7), 9 (LMP2), and 10 (MECL1)]. Based on the proteome data, we exemplarily compared the regulation of proteins implicated in HLA presentation after IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3 treatment. Consistent with previous reports about MRC-5 cells (39), our proteome analysis identified and quantified HLA proteins corresponding to HLA-A2, -A29, and B44 alleles. Although IFN\u03b3 was superior in inducing the components of antigen presentation, IFN\u03b1 also enhanced the abundance of several proteins (e.g., HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, PSBM9, TAP1, and TAP2) (Figure 4B).
