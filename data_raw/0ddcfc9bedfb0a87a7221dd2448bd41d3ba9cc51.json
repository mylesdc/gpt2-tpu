Using the example of influenza A, we illustrate how the measurement of infection-related quantities that determine the dynamics of viral load within the human host, can inform investigators on the course and severity of infection and the efficacy of a novel treatment. We estimated the values of key infectionrelated quantities that determine the course of natural infection from viral load data, using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. The data were placebo group viral load measurements collected during volunteer challenge studies, conducted by Roche, as part of the oseltamivir trials. We calculated the values of the quantities for each patient and the correlations between the quantities, symptom severity and body temperature. The greatest variation among individuals occurred in the viral load peak and area under the viral load curve. Total symptom severity correlated positively with the basic reproductive number. The most sensitive endpoint for therapeutic trials with the goal to cure patients is the duration of infection. We suggest laboratory experiments to obtain more precise estimates of virological quantities that can supplement clinical endpoint measurements.",

A major part of this cost increase is due to losses incurred on drug candidates that fail during clinical development [2] . Failure may be due to adverse events or an inability to detect beneficial effects on the target disease. The reasons why clinical trials fail to demonstrate efficacy of potential novel treatments are many and complex. Failure is often due to the choice of inadequate endpoints, or poor trial design. Good endpoints in clinical trials should fulfill the following two key criteria: i) they should reflect the action of the treatment on the underlying cause of disease, and ii) they should be reliably quantifiable.",

They typically have a short incubation period (a few days) and rapid onset of clinical symptoms. Consequently, patients usually present at clinics after the viral load peak has passed and the infection is already in the decline phase. Only a few measurements of viral load or symptoms can be taken before the infection terminates due to the immunological response of the human host. Using the example of influenza A, we discuss how a quantitative analysis of viral population growth within the patient can help investigators to define more reliable endpoints and improve the assessment of the efficacy of potential novel treatments.",

For example, symptoms may be measured by asking patients how they are feeling, and therefore are at risk of being subjective and at best semi-quantitative [3] . Moreover, symptoms may not accurately reflect the pathologic process targeted by a specific treatment. In the case of influenza A, respiratory and systemic symptoms are not only caused by viral tissue damage, but also by the immune response to the viral infection itself. In severely ill patients with multiple morbidity-inducing conditions, symptom scores may not give any indication of the successful action of a treatment. Influenza treatment may clear the viral infection, but symptoms may persist due to secondary bacterial pneumonia [4] .",

The model has been developed from a standard model [11] , by assuming that the viral dynamics are much faster than those of infected cells. As we do not have quantitative information on the dynamics of infected cells, this is a sensible assumption that allows us to reduce the number of unknown parameters in the system. The model is general enough to be applicable to other acute viral infections. The analytical properties of this model and the derivation of the infection-related quantities have been discussed elsewhere [10] . In brief, the dynamics of the model are given by the following equations:",

All volunteers were screened for HI titre to exclude pre-existing immunity against the challenge strain. We estimated the parameter values for each patient.

Compared to the 95% credible intervals of individual parameter estimates, the variation among patients in the infection-related quantities shown in Table 2 is relatively small.

Some of these published estimates were derived from tissue culture experiments, where, in the absence of any immune response, R 0 is likely to be higher. The viral strains used also differed in the various studies (influenza A Texas/36/91 (H1N1) in our study, Hong Kong/123/77 (H1N1) in [11] , and Albany/1/98 (H3N2) in [15] ). As some viral strains may disseminate faster through infected tissue than others, infection by such strains may be associated with higher R 0 values. Moreover, some of the earlier studies consider a latent infection stage which can increase estimates of R 0 . We did not consider a latent stage, as the data did not contain enough information to justify additional parameters. In our analysis, peak viral load and viral load AUC are the most variable infection-related quantities. They were also strongly correlated, indicating that viral load AUC is mainly determined by peak viral load. High variability in AUC is thought to reflect high variability in infectiousness among individuals. Table 3 . Pairwise correlations between infection-related quantities, between infection-related quantities and temperature area under the curve, and between infection-related quantities and symptom score area under the curve. Correlations that are significant using the Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons are indicated by an asterisk. Correlations that are significant using the less stringent Benjamini-Hochberg correction are indicated by a diamond. Values below the diagonal show Pearson's correlation coefficient, values above the diagonal show uncorrected p-values for each correlation. AUC S : total symptom score area under the curve. AUC T : temperature area under the curve. R 0 : basic reproductive number. AUC V : viral load area under the curve. FDC: fraction of dead cells at end of infection. t peak : time to peak viral load. V peak : peak viral load. We found that viral load correlates significantly with body temperature and total symptom scores, but the correlations were not very strong. This may indicate that, although viral load is ultimately responsible for infection-related illness, other processes, for example the immune response, cause symptoms. Alternatively, the reporting of symptoms may be rather subjective and therefore difficult to quantify accurately.",

It is also easy to miss the peak viral load, if the measurement intervals are spaced too far apart. This will affect the estimate of the viral load AUC. We recommend taking at least two to three measurements per day, if possible (mainly in phase I studies). This is partly because the reduction in infection duration in treated individuals is typically not more than one day (Fig 5) . If only one measurement per day is taken, it will be difficult to resolve the differences in infection duration between treated and untreated groups. The same rationale holds for measuring the viral decay rate.",

In the case of influenza A, the most common assays are RT-qPCR and TCID 50 [23, 24] .
