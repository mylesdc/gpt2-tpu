            "text": "Circulating RNA may result from excessive cell damage or acute viral infection and can interact with vascular endothelial cells. Despite the obvious clinical implications associated with the presence of circulating RNA, its pathological effects on endothelial cells and the governing molecular mechanisms are still not fully elucidated. We analyzed the effects of double stranded RNA on primary human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (hPAECs). The effect of natural and synthetic doublestranded RNA (dsRNA) on hPAECs was investigated using trans-endothelial electric resistance, molecule trafficking, calcium (Ca 2+ ) homeostasis, gene expression and proliferation studies. Furthermore, the morphology and mechanical changes of the cells caused by synthetic dsRNA was followed by in-situ atomic force microscopy, by vascular-endothelial cadherin and Factin staining. Our results indicated that exposure of hPAECs to synthetic dsRNA led to functional deficits. This was reflected by morphological and mechanical changes and an increase in the permeability of the endothelial monolayer. hPAECs treated with synthetic dsRNA accumulated in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Additionally, the proliferation rate of the cells in the presence of synthetic dsRNA was significantly decreased. Furthermore, we found that natural and synthetic dsRNA modulated Ca 2+ signaling in hPAECs by inhibiting the sarco-endoplasmic Ca 2+ -ATPase (SERCA) which is involved in the regulation of the intracellular Ca 2+ homeostasis and thus cell growth. Even upon synthetic dsRNA stimulation silencing of SERCA3 preserved the endothelial monolayer integrity. Our data identify novel mechanisms by which dsRNA can disrupt endothelial barrier function and these may be relevant in inflammatory processes.",

Local and systemic inflammation, however, can impair endothelial function and can lead to cellular damage increasing endothelial permeability and loss of epithelial barrier function [1, 2] . Endogenous RNA release and circulating RNA like virus-associated double stranded RNA (dsRNA) may contribute to the development of endothelial dysfunction. Endothelial cells express toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) [3] which is activated by dsRNA [4, 5] . The activation of TLR3 affects cell homeostasis [6, 7] and causes changes at functional [8, 9] , as well as inflammatory gene expression level [10] . At cellular level, dsRNA induces a signaling cascade [11, 12] leading to TLR3 receptor upregulation [4, 13] . At organ level, repeated and long-term administration of synthetic dsRNA causes inflammation [14, 15] and leads to impairment of lung function in mice [16] [17] [18] . However, the biological activity of circulating extracellular RNA is poorly understood.",

            "text": "Recently, an extracellular RNA-induced activation of VEGF has been shown, leading to increased permeability of cerebral endothelial cells, which are the main components of the blood brain barrier [19] . This hyperpermeability can occur due to exposure of the cells to total RNA [8] or the synthetic analogue of dsRNA, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (Poly I:C) [20] and can lead to disintegration of adherens junctions [21] . Endothelial permeability regulation [22] and function [23, 24] is a Ca 2+dependent process [1, 25] . A rise in intracellular Ca 2+ in the ECs occurs through Ca 2+ influx or by release from the sarcoendoplasmic reticulum (SER) resulting in plasma membranelocated Ca 2+ channel activation [26, 27] . To maintain the Ca 2+ homeostasis of the cell, the Ca 2+ stores are refilled by the SERmembrane-located sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2+ ATPase (SERCA) [28] . SERCA is encoded by three homologous genes: SERCA1, SERCA2 and SERCA3 [29] , out of these in human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (hPAECs) only SERCA2 and SERCA3 isoforms are expressed [30, 31] . However, SERCA plays an important role not only in the Ca 2+ homeostasis [24, 30, 32] , but it is vital for cell cycle control [33] , proliferation and regulation of cellular permeability as well.",

The precise mechanism by which circulating RNA induces endothelial barrier disruption in the lung has not been completely understood yet. The present study addressed novel pathways of dsRNA effect on primary human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (hPAECs). Our data showed that natural dsRNA treatment significantly decreased electric resistance indicating disruption in the hPAEC monolayer integrity. A similar effect could be observed with the widely used synthetic dsRNA-analog, Poly I:C. Incubation with L-DNA did not cause significant permeability changes indicating the specificity of the dsRNA effect. As dsRNA and Poly I:C treatment mimics viral infection, our results are in line with previous observations on bluetongue virus-infected human primary microvascular endothelial cells [41] . The EC monolayer disrupting effect of dsRNA was further confirmed by using fluorescently labeled dextran trafficking, showing that stimulation with either Poly I:C, total RNA or dsRNA resulted in an increase in transferred dextran amount suggesting a significant loss in endothelial barrier function. The tight, isolating monolayer of the endothelial cells is accomplished by junctional structures, like adherens and tight junctions. The major component for the maintenance of monolayer integrity belongs to the transmembrane protein family, the cadherins [21] . The vascular endothelial cells express in their membrane the vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin) member of this family. Poly I:C incubation decreased VE-cadherin signal, pointing to disrupted cell-cell contacts in the monolayer. A similar decrease was reported as a result of dengue-2 virus infection in human umbilical vein endothelial cells [21] . We observed a similar decrease in the ZO-1 protein upon Poly I:C treatment. Furthermore, our results indicate that not only the junctional proteins contribute to dissociation of intercellular contacts, but also the actin reorganization. The Poly I:C treated cells presented with an intense peripheral actin staining accompanied by cellular shape changes visible on the immunofluorescent pictures. Similar cytoskeletal rearrangement was shown to be induced by 6 h bluetongue virus infection in primary human microvascular endothelial cells [41] . Although, the authors report on a recovery of both electrical resistance and actin/VE-cadherin staining after 24 h, this was not the case in either dsRNA, or Poly I:C treatment in our experiments. This could be explained by the differences between the human lung microvascular and arterial endothelial cells.",

In-situ atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging and force measurements detected structural changes in the endothelial cells at single cell level. Endothelial barrier-disruptive agents have been reported to cause changes in cytoskeletal mechanics of hPAECs [44] . In our AFM images, cells treated with Poly I:C showed an elongated morphological shape. Furthermore, the Poly I:C treatment also led to an approximately 10-fold stiffening of the cells. This is in line with the observations of the effect of other barrier-disruptive agents on hPAECs [44, 45] . The change in the mechanical properties of the cells can lead to disturbed or disrupted cell-cell contacts and may contribute to endothelial dysfunction.",

Our data suggest that, beside structural changes, Poly I:C and dsRNA also affects endothelial Ca 2+ homeostasis. Acute administration of either Poly I:C, or dsRNA did not result in any Ca 2+ response, but 24 hours of treatment led to a significantly prolonged histamine-induced Ca 2+ response, without affecting the basal Ca 2+ level. Further, we focused on intracellular Ca 2+ mobilization. The key player of the Ca 2+ store refilling is the sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase (SERCA) [28] and its proper regulation is vital for normal cell function [33] . An inhibitory effect of Poly I:C on SERCA is suggested by the increased duration of the histamine-induced signal, observed in the presence and absence of extracellullar Ca 2+ . We observed a decrease in the phospholamban phosphorylation upon Poly I:C or dsRNA treatment, which contributes to enhanced block of SERCA function. Phospholamban is a negative regulator of SERCA function [46] . Phospholamban phosphorylation causes its dissociation from SERCA and removes inhibition [47] .",

Thus, our data indicate, that dsRNA does not regulate SERCA expression like its synthetic analogue (Poly I:C). Nonetheless, both caused decrease in the phospholamban phosphorylation. Furthermore, the SERCA blocker (BHQ) induced a dose-dependent inhibition of the hPAEC proliferation, a decrease in the VE-cadherin staining and increase in the transendothelial transport similar to the effect of dsRNA or Poly I:C. The siRNA silencing of SERCA3 on hPAECs confirmed the Figure 5 . Prolonged histamine-induced Ca 2+ plateau in hPAECs after Poly I:C incubation accompanied by SERCA downregulation and phospholamban dephosphorylation. Representative traces of 100 mM histamine induced intracellular Ca 2+ rise under Ca 2+ -free (A) and Ca 2+ (C) conditions showed a prolonged decay of intracellular Ca 2+ level in hPAECs after 24 h Poly I:C (red line), dsRNA (green line) or total RNA (orange line) treatment. As a control, L-DNA had no effect (blue line). Arrow indicates the application of histamine (His).

In rat aortic endothelial cells, a decrease in SERCA activity resulted in a delayed G1 to S phase transition in the cell cycle [33] . SERCA dysfunction has been also reported following exposure of pancreatic beta cells to cytokines [48] . However, in our experiments not only the function, but also the expression of SERCA decreased upon Poly I:C treatment, which could result in disturbance of cell cycle regulation [33] . Exposure of hPAECs to Poly I:C in fact disturbed the regular cell cycle. Furthermore, a dose and time-dependent accumulation of hPAECs in the G1-phase was observed. This increase was accompanied by decrease in the number of cells both, in S and in G2/M phase, indicating that the cell cycle is arrested. In addition, Poly I:C treatment resulted in inhibition of proliferation, with no increase in apoptosis ( Figure S2 , Methods S1). As the Ca 2+ homeostasis of the cells was altered through affecting the SERCA pump but without change in apoptosis, we conclude that Poly I:C causes Ca 2+ mishandling, due to SERCA downregulation and functional inhibition, thereby leading to G1 arrest and finally to inhibition of hPAEC proliferation.",

The cell cycle and the cell monolayer integrity are affected resulting in an accumulation of the hPAECs in G1 phase of the cell cycle. The circulating dsRNA due to reducing phospholamban phosphorylation may alter intracellular Ca 2+ homeostasis and thus cell growth, leading to endothelial cell dysfunction. It is tempting to hypothesize that circulating extracellular RNA (e.g. in viral infection) acts as a barrier disrupting agent and contributes to the development of human pulmonary vascular dysfunction.

The concentrationresponse curve of the Poly I:C-induced inhibition of proliferation resulted in an IC 50 of 2.060.3 mg/mL (Figure 4A; n = 5 for each group).Furthermore, upon Poly I:C treatment a dose-and timedependent accumulation of hPAECs in the G1-phase was observed (Figure 4B). The number of cells in the G1 phase was significantly increased from 62.460.3% (control) to 76.961.8% after 24 h and further raised to 91.561.1% after 48 h of treatment with 25 mg/mL Poly I:C. This increase was accompanied by a decrease in the number of cells both, in the S and in the G2/M phase.",

(A) Both natural double-stranded RNA (squares) and synthetic analogue (Poly I:C, circles) caused a significant, time dependent, linear decrease of the transendothelial electric resistance (TEER) of the human pulmonary artery endothelial cell (hPAEC) monolayer. L-DNA served as a control and had no significant effect. The graph summarizes the results of 6 independent measurements for each treatment and the linear fit of the data. The values were normalized to the TEER of hPAECs at the start of the experiment (*p,0.05, ***p,0.001 compared to Vehicle control). (B) Histogram summarizing the effect of the 24 h treatments on the FITC-dextran permeability of hPAEC. Double-stranded RNA significantly increased FITC-dextran traffic. Similar results were obtained after Poly I:C and total RNA treatment, but not with L-DNA.
