Human and chicken erythrocytes contain both \u03b12-6 and \u03b12-3 sialic acids, although in different relative quantities (human cells contain more \u03b12-6 sialosides than chicken cells 2 . Horse erythrocytes contain hardly any \u03b12-6 sialic acids, while the majority of their \u03b12-3 sialosides are of the N-glycolyl type (NeuGc), which is not present on human or chicken cells, which only contain sialosides of the N-Acetyl type (NeuAc). Nevertheless, viruses that prefer binding to \u03b12-3 NeuAc are also able to agglutinate horse erythrocytes 3 . The mean values of at least two independent experiments performed in triplicate are shown. Standard deviations are indicated and asterisks (*) and crosses ( \u2020) indicate significant differences in HA titer between (mutant) proteins and H7/Teal (A, B and C) or H7/Human (D), respectively (P<0.001; One-way ANOVA followed by a Dunnett's multiple comparison test). Limiting dilutions of pre-complexed soluble trimeric H7 proteins and mutants thereof were applied in the fetuin-binding assay as described in the legend of Figure 1 . The mean values of at least two independent experiments performed in triplicate are shown. The results shown correspond with the data shown in Figure 3 .",
