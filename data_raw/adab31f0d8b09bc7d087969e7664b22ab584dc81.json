Cats account for 3.2 million of these animals, approximately 26 .9% of which are euthanized [1] . In an effort to decrease shelter euthanasia rates and expand opportunities for positive outcomes, companion animal relocation programs have been developed across the country. These programs typically relocate animals from source agencies with limited resources to destination agencies with greater capacity to support the needs of animals and promote positive outcomes.",

Additionally, they do not necessarily specify how best to uphold animal welfare and well-being, public safety and disease prevention in relocation programs. Accordingly, resources on best practices for companion animal relocation have been put forth in the Association of Shelter Veterinarians' Guidelines for Standards of Care in Animal Shelters, the American Veterinary Medical Association's Best Practices for the Relocation of Dogs and Cats for Adoption and the Society of Animal Welfare Administrators' Companion Animal Transport Programs Best Practices [2] [3] [4] . However, as a relatively new and growing practice, operational procedures and best practices for relocating cats are evolving and conflicting recommendations sometimes exist. One study examining canine relocation indicated increased transmission of vector-borne diseases following disaster response [5] , and significant concerns about the potential for disease transmission when making transfer-related decisions have been reported by animal welfare personnel [6] . In addition, state veterinarians and organized veterinary medicine have expressed similar concerns surrounding relocation and infectious disease transmission [7, 8] . The risk of unintentional introduction and transmission of feline infectious diseases through relocation, however, is currently based on anecdotal experience [9] .",

Feline upper respiratory infection (URI) in shelters, primarily driven by feline herpesvirus, has specifically been linked to stress and is a concern surrounding relocation [ [10] [11] [12] . Additional concerns associated with other infectious diseases, such as feline panleukopenia (FPV) and dermatophytosis, include the severity of disease, the environmental stability of the pathogens and the potential for zoonotic transmission (dermatophytosis only). While these infectious diseases can negatively impact destination agencies or the communities they serve, limited data exists to quantify the level of risk [9] . Understanding the prevalence of common infectious diseases in relocated cats will provide data regarding frequency of such conditions and could help inform future recommendations regarding measures to limit unintentional disease introduction and transmission.",

A mixed-effects logistic regression model was used to examine factors associated with URI while accounting for potential similarities among cats from the same source agency, including the likelihood of similar disease outcomes. Three variables were initially selected for inclusion in the model based on potential clinical importance: cat age, time in transport and length of stay at the destination agency. As described in Hosmer, Lemeshow and Sturdivant, initial screening based on univariable logistic regressions of URI on each variable revealed all three as candidates for inclusion in the full model using a selection cutoff, here set at p \u2264 0.1 [14] . Multilevel mixed-effects models include both random effects, which account for grouping of participants who may share similarities (in this case, cats from the same source agency) and traditional (fixed) effects. Accordingly, in the mixed-effects model, source agency was fitted with random intercepts using an independent covariance structure to model shared variance at the source agency level, while cat age, time in transport and length of stay at the destination agency were fitted as fixed effects. Model assumptions of (1) a linear relationship between the explanatory variables and the log odds of the outcome variable and (2) absence of substantial multicollinearity among the explanatory variables were tested in Stata using the boxtid and collin commands, respectively. Model goodness-of-fit was assessed using the global Wald statistic and the likelihood ratio test of the multilevel model versus an ordinary logistic regression. All analyses were performed using listwise deletion (cases with any missing observations were withheld from analysis), resulting in a total of 398 cat records analyzed for the mixed-effects model.",

Table 3 displays the results of the mixed-effects logistic regression model. The overall model was significant, Wald \u03c7 2 (5) = 57.6, p < 0.01. However, the mixed-effects logistic model represented no significant improvement in fit over a regular logistic model, \u03c7 2 (1) = 1.9, p = 0.09. Because Stata's boxtid command is not supported within mixed-effects regression, the regular logistic model was used to assess the assumption of a linear relationship between the explanatory variables and the log odds of URI. None of the variables departed significantly from linearity, upholding this assumption of the model. The mean variance inflation factor (VIF) was 1.1 and tolerance was between 0.9 and 1.0 for all explanatory variables, upholding the assumption of no substantial multicollinearity.",

Indeed, one study documented that 45% of cats start re-shedding feline herpesvirus after incurring a stressful event such as entering a new shelter or being rehoused [18] . The stress associated with hours of transport and being placed into a new shelter is likely to reactivate herpesvirus and contribute to clinical URI after a lag phase of 4-11 days [10] . Accordingly, a higher prevalence of URI in relocated cats should not be unexpected and in the authors' opinion it is surprising that the URI prevalence documented in this study was not higher. It should also be noted that diagnostic testing was not required as part of the case definition for URI; as such, the degree of viral shedding of individual cats was unknown and the true prevalence of URI infection may have been underestimated. As it has been documented that herpesvirus shedding significantly increases within the first 7 days of shelter entry, it is likely that many cats were shedding virus in this study, whether clinically ill or not [16, 19] . Although the cats in this study spent an undisclosed amount of time in previous shelters (their respective source agencies) and even though a direct comparison cannot be made to studies that diagnostically tested for disease, it is likely that the frequency of viral shedding was higher than the noted frequency of clinical cats. Accordingly, understanding that relocated animals are subjected to additional stress and potentially additional disease while in transport vehicles, as well as the fact that they may be subclinically shedding virus, the management of relocated cats should be similar to that of other shelter cats based on currently recognized best practices. Adequate and appropriate low-stress care, housing, sanitation, biosecurity measures and population density should be maintained to minimize the risk of URI development in all cats.",

Feline panleukopenia virus is enzootic in all parts of the United States but is more prevalent in high density populations such as catteries and shelters [20] . Accordingly, sporadic FPV cases and outbreaks are still seen throughout American shelters. It is important to note that six of the seven FPV cases were kittens from the same source agency, were transported in on the same day via a four hour trip and were all diagnosed with FPV one day after intake into the destination agency. It is unknown whether these kittens were littermates. Based on the disease course of FPV and date of FPV diagnosis, these kittens were likely already incubating FPV upon arrival to the destination agency although they were clinically healthy on the day of transport. Thorough screening of animals through physical examination prior to transport to ensure that animals are not showing even mild signs of illness is vital to limiting disease transmission related to relocation. Guidelines on animal relocation emphasize this best practice and state that all animals being transported should receive a medical examination by a trained animal care professional or veterinarian within 24 h of transport [2] [3] [4] . Ideally, screening animals for obvious signs of illness should be performed immediately prior to loading for transport, as well. The routine screening of healthy appearing animals through diagnostic testing means however is not recommended.",

Previous studies have similarly found young age to be a predictor of URI in catteries and shelters [15, 16, 23] . Kittens are more susceptible to disease as maternal immunity wanes, and they suffer more severe clinical signs than adult cats [15, 19] . More than half (53.2%) of the 111 cats affected with URI in this study were kittens younger than five months of age, and their average time to URI diagnosis was six days (range: 0 to 22 days). The incubation period for herpesvirus is 2-6 days for a newly exposed animal [10] . Accordingly, URI in kittens, who are perhaps less likely to be latently infected with herpesvirus compared to older cats, is possibly reflective of infections acquired as a result of novel exposure in the shelter. Although it is unknown whether foster care programs or other offsite placement options would reduce URI prevalence in relocated kittens, these study findings reinforce the value in adhering to established best practices in shelter medicine. This includes separating younger kittens, particularly those too young for adoption, from the general shelter population through appropriately segregated housing and/or placement outside of the shelter (i.e., foster care placement) to minimize the likelihood of exposure [24] .",

The potential for both increased stress and increased disease exposure associated with the physical act of relocation itself likely contributes to increased URI risk. The American Veterinary Medical Association's Best Practices for the Relocation of Dogs and Cats for Adoption recommends that the maximum transport time to an intermediate or final destination should not be greater than 12 h [2] . Accordingly, the average time in transport in this study (17.6 h) is not recommended, and it is possible that other relocation programs, with otherwise similar operations but shorter transport times, may have lower rates of URI. Additional information regarding transport itself that could provide more insights on the environmental stress associated with transport include the method of transportation (e.g., air versus ground), the density of animals on transport, whether transports are multispecies, the ambient temperature within the transport vehicle, and/or whether animals from multiple source agencies are in the same transport vehicle.",

Increased length of stay increases chances of exposure to respiratory pathogens and increases the likelihood of viral reactivation of chronic or previous infection related to environmental stress in the shelter [16, 19] . As explained in Dinnage et al., requiring longer lengths of stay at shelters, such as intake quarantine periods, increases the URI incidence in shelters due to the pathophysiology and clinical nature of URI in shelter populations [15] . This study's findings, while not establishing causality, are consistent with the interpretation that increased time spent in the shelter is associated with increased URI prevalence. Accordingly, minimizing shelter length of stay is critical for URI management from an individual animal perspective as a key method of limiting disease exposure and environmental stress. From a population-based perspective, minimizing shelter length of stay is equally critical in that it maximizes shelter resources, capacity and population flow while simultaneously taking animal well-being into account. Regardless of whether an animal acquires URI due to increased length of stay or whether an animal with URI has a longer stay in the destination agency, increased length of stay related to URI is undesirable in any shelter and has negative impacts on the entire population.",

However, the low number of FPV and ringworm cases noted in this study suggest that quarantine periods for relocated cats should be carefully considered as they may contribute to development of other diseases such as URI without meaningfully reducing risk [15] . While applicable state and municipal regulations surrounding quarantine of relocated animals must be followed, shelters should carefully consider the risks and benefits of voluntarily imposed intake quarantine periods. The risk of infectious disease should be balanced with the shelter's capacity and resources related to quarantine. Animal health status, source and any known infectious disease risk within the source, as well as incubation periods of pathogens of concern should be weighed against increased costs, reduced shelter capacity and the potential adverse health effects of increasing length of stay in the shelter [4] . Routine disease surveillance and the prompt identification and isolation of clinically ill animals can instead be used to mitigate infectious disease concerns [15, 26] .",

However, the study design did have limitations. First, no information was available on feline health status, environmental factors or average length of stay of cats at the source agencies. This study focused only on the population of cats that were transported and all cats had to be overtly healthy on the day of transport to be eligible for relocation. Accordingly, this study did not investigate the general population of shelter cats that would have initially been eligible and/or selected for relocation but may have been excluded from relocation as a result of the subsequent development of physical and/or behavioral health concerns within source agencies. For example, investigation of the total length of stay of cats within the source and destination agencies is warranted, since this study and previous studies have shown that increased length of stay is a risk factor for URI development [15, 16, 25] . The time to onset of URI, whether driven by novel exposure to a respiratory pathogen or the recrudescence of latent feline herpesvirus, is important to consider in light of length of stay at both the source and destination agencies and can convey both a causal and temporal relationship between URI and length of stay. Future investigations could prospectively follow cats in a case-control study within source agencies to their outcomes to create a more accurate and comprehensive representation of the infectious disease prevalence and risks surrounding relocation.",

In addition, information regarding baseline feline infectious disease rates of the destination agency was unavailable. Accordingly, an infectious disease incidence rate at the destination agency, which would have incorporated how many cats were at-risk of developing disease on a daily basis throughout the facility, was not calculated.

The factors assessed in this study may have been associated with other such factors and/or have been associated with the other explanatory factors in the model themselves. In addition, this was a preliminary study that observed disease at the destination agency and did not focus on the development of disease following adoption. Challenges in obtaining and confirming dates and diagnoses for conditions reported by adopters precluded the usefulness of such post-adoption data. It should also be noted that the case definition-based method of URI diagnosis in this study may have resulted in overestimation or underestimation of disease. Lastly, the study was a convenience sample of cats in one geographic location over a period of seven months and may not reflect the infectious disease prevalence and risk factors associated with the general shelter cat population across the United States during all times of the year. Because seasonal variations can affect infectious disease prevalence, this study was purposely conducted over the summer season to ensure a more conservative estimate of infectious disease prevalence was reflected as this is when shelters are typically faced with higher intake numbers and population density related to the increased birth rate of cats. Future studies are needed to continue to explore how relocation programs impact feline health on both the source and destination sides.",

This study reveals that highly contagious feline infectious diseases that can result in high mortality and morbidity of cats, such as FPV and dermatophytosis, were uncommon following transport in one established relocation program. The development of URI in shelters, which has been closely associated with stress, is a predictable concern when relocating cats considering that transport itself, as well as the introduction to a new environment, are stressful events. Factors associated with URI in cats following transport include younger age, longer time in transport and increased length of stay at the destination agency. The prevalence of infectious disease noted in this study is based on the transport of overtly healthy animals in an established relocation program. Although these data are collected from one relocation period over one period of time, they can be used to improve the understanding of factors associated with disease and provide direction and focus for future research. Importantly, this information can help shelters develop protocols around relocated animals to reduce disease transmission within the shelter. Documented strategies that can minimize the risk of developing URI in shelters should be followed for relocated cats at destination agencies, including the provision of larger housing units, minimization of movement of cats within and between cages, utilization of appropriate sanitation methods, minimization of length of stay within the shelter and reduction of shelter population density [17, 27] .",
