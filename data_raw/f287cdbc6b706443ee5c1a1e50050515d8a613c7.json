Unraveling the involvement of miRNA as a key cellular factor during in vitro canine parvovirus (CPV) infection may facilitate the discovery of potential intervention candidates. However, the examination of miRNA expression profiles in CPV in tissue culture systems has not been fully elucidated. Method: In the present study, we utilized high-throughput small RNA-seq (sRNAseq) technology to investigate the altered miRNA profiling in miRNA libraries from uninfected (Control) and CPV-2c infected Crandell Reese Feline Kidney cells. Results: We identified five of known miRNAs (miR-222-5p, miR-365-2-5p, miR-1247-3p, miR-322-5p and miR-361-3p) and three novel miRNAs (Novel 137, Novel 141 and Novel 102) by sRNA-seq with differentially expressed genes in the miRNA repertoire of CPV-infected cells over control. We further predicted the potential target genes of the aforementioned miRNAs using sequence homology algorithms. Notably, the targets of miR-1247-3p exhibited a potential function associated with cellular defense and humoral response to CPV. To extend the probing scheme for gene targets of miR-1247-3p, we explored and performed Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of its target genes. We discovered 229 putative targets from a total of 38 enriched GO terms. The top over-represented GO enrichment in biological process were lymphocyte activation and differentiation, marginal zone B cell differentiation, negative regulation of cytokine production, negative regulation of programed cell death, and negative regulation of signaling. We next constructed a GO biological process network composed of 28 target genes of miR-1247-3p, of How to cite this article Chuammitri P, Vannamahaxay S, Sornpet B, Pringproa K, Patchanee P. 2020.

The virus has a wide host range in many mammalian families, including dogs, cats, ferrets, minks and raccoons (Kapil et al., 2007) . CPV is a non-enveloped virus, single-stranded DNA virus in the Parvoviridae family (Cotmore et al., 2014) . The compact genome (approximately 5,000 nt) encodes two nonstructural proteins (NS1 and NS2) and three capsid proteins (VP1, VP2 and VP3) through an alternative splicing of the same mRNAs (Berns & Parrish, 2007) . CPV is globally distributed, and this virus has been evolutionarily diverged from CPV-1 to its present forms of CPV-2 subtypes; CPV-2, CPV-2a, CPV-2b and CPV-2c (Truyen, 2006) . CPV-2 can cause severe hemorrhagic gastroenteritis in dogs, owing to amino acid substitutions harboring at VP2 capsid protein (Truyen, 2006) .",

The miRNA biogenesis starts with a long nucleotide sequences of the miRNAs which are folded into hairpin configuration, known as \"primary miRNAs or pri-miRNAs\". Later on, the shortening and editing of pri-miRNAs occurred by the activity of Drosha and DGCR9 enzymes, making a shorter version of miRNAs and soon to be called \"pre-miRNA\". The pre-miRNA, an~70-nucleotide in length, is exported to the cytosol where the Dicer repeatedly chops the sequences once again here to make an~20-bp miRNA/miRNA \u00c3 duplex (Krol, Loedige & Filipowicz, 2010) . The functional miRNA,~18-22 nt long, represents a mature miRNA, which can be incorporated into the miRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC). The miRNAs, altogether with its cognate target mRNAs, function as gene expression regulators as part of miRISC by preventing protein translation, mRNA deadenylation, and mRNA target cleavage (Krol, Loedige & Filipowicz, 2010) .",

In RNA-seq, replicates have two main advantages. First, they demonstrate whether the experiment is repeatable, and secondly, they can reveal differences in gene expression between samples. The correlation between samples is an important indicator for testing the reliability of the experiment. The closer the correlation coefficient is to 1, the greater the similarity of the samples. ENCODE suggests that the square of the Pearson correlation coefficient should be larger than 0.92, under ideal experimental conditions (ENCODE Project Consortium, 2004) . In this project, the R 2 were larger than 0.93 (Fig. 3A) . Variations among technical replicates were minimal. These observations can also be confirmed by the correlation matrix. For Pearson correlation, the correlation coefficient within group and between groups were larger than 0.92 demonstrating that the experiment was repeatable, and could be revealed differences in gene expression between samples (Fig. 3A) . The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) showed that, either Control or CPV library was grouped together, differed apart from each other (Fig. 3B) . PCA plot using the first and second principal components is shown in Fig. 3B . There was a clear difference between the CPV-infected and the control samples, along the first two principal components that explain 77.6% of the variance. The mixed gene expression pattern in exploratory miRNA species heterogeneity in Control and CPV infection was retrieved from sRNA-seq. To reduce the complexity of data for interpretation (n = 420, mapped mature miRNAs), we have performed and used the dimension reduction algorithm t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) to review our miRNA expression data (Fig. 3C) . Because of high-dimensional datasets, this technique can be implemented, allowing it to be applied to large real-world datasets, resulting in well suited for the easy visualization. To identify the read count subset defined by specific miRNA gene expression signatures, unsupervised clustering of 420 mature miRNAs were identified and clustered into two groups by t-SNE, matching the known heterogeneity of transcripts of miRNA genes. The t-SNE visualization of Control/CPV showed limited overlap between two miRNA libraries. The t-SNE result of a mixture of miRNAs in Control in combination with infected-cells (CPV) showed dividing data into 2 clusters, as depicted by dots with different color schemes (cluster A-B, Fig. 3C ). For heatmap and hierarchical clustering, the Control and CPV-infected cells could be customarily segmented into visibly two patterns of detection, up-and down-regulated of miRNA genes, with the broad range of uses. Four categorized groups were determined by the representation of heatmap based mainly on Z-score; namely from high (red) to low (green) or base-line expression (black or mixed colored), respectively (Fig. 3D) .",

The abundance ranged from 0.1 TPM to 468,769 TPM in the Control and from 0.1 TPM to 474,115 TPM in the CPV group (GSE135948). After data normalization, eleven miRNAs were changed in abundance in CPV-infected cells by two-fold or more (log 2 expression ratio \u2265 1 or \u2264 1). Among known differentially expressed miRNAs (DEGs), 3 were up-regulated (miR-222-5p, miR-365-2-5p, miR-1247-3p) and 2 (miR-322-5p, miR-361-3p) were down-regulated in the CPV significantly at the FDR < 0.05 level (Fig. 4B) . The miR-17A-5p, miR-147-3p, miR-222-5p, miR-365-2-5p, miR-1247-3p, Novel 4 were upregulated miRNAs in CVP over Control libraries, and miR-322-5p, miR-361-3p, Novel 102, Novel 137, Novel 141 were downregulated miRNAs (Figs. 4C and 4D). In the case of novel miRNAs, the pattern was opposite, as three (Novel 102, Novel 137, Novel 141) were only down-regulated in the CPV group, no up-regulated novel miRNAs were found at the FDR < 0.05 (Fig. 4B ). Of the 75 novel miRNAs that passed the filtering process, differentially expressed novel miRNAs demonstrated 2-fold or greater expression changes (log2 fold change; \u2265 1 or \u2264 1) between the Control and CPV groups were 22 (up-regulated) and 13 down-regulated novel miRNAs, respectively.",

The plot visualizes the differences between measurements taken in two samples, by transforming the data onto log-fold change (M-values) and the MA (A-values) scales, then plotting these values. The MA plots are exploited to visualize high-throughput sequencing analysis. The MA and scatter plot of DEGs showed the predefined up-regulated genes; miR27A-5p, miR-147-3p, miR222-5p, miR365-2-5p and miR1247-3p, with one miRNA (novel 4) with never defined before (Fig. 4C ). For those with downregulation in CPV-infected cells; miR361-5p, miR322-5p The Volcano plot could be used to infer the overall distribution of different expression miRNAs. For the experiment with biological replicate, as the DESeq2 has already eliminated the biological variation, our threshold was normally set as FDR < 0.05 (horizontal dotted line). Volcano plot of gene expression in CPV-infected cells showed fold change (vertical dotted lines) in gene expression regulated genes (FC \u2265 2 (red) or \u2264 \u22122 (green), FDR < 0.05) are highlighted (Fig. 5) . The volcano plot, the MA, and scatter plot show that CPV infection lead to a considerably minimal miRNA transcriptomic response.

As CPV infected stimulated the presence of miR-1247-3p and in turn, to regulate the production of many genes involved in the aforementioned processes, leading to reduction of proteins shared with the common pathways (Fig. 7B) . GO categories were assigned for target genes of miR-1247-3p, and 229 putative targets were identified in the total of 38 enriched GO categories in terms of \"biological process\", \"cellular component\" and \"molecular function\" (Fig. 6) . Based on the biological process (BP), the genes were classified into 33 categories, of which the top ten over-represented GO terms (enrichment) were \"lymphocyte activation involved in immune response\", \"lymphocyte differentiation\", \"marginal zone B cell differentiation\", \"negative regulation of cytokine production\", \"negative regulation of programed cell death\", \"negative regulation of signaling\", \"pattern specification process\", \"regulation of Notch signaling pathway\", \"response to organic substances\" and \"cellular component organization\", respectively (Fig. 8A ). The target genes were primarily varied with respect to function, as revealed by our analysis. In the case of molecular function, the genes were classified into five groups, of which they are mostly involved in \"anion binding\", \"protein binding\" and \"organic cyclic compound binding\". Based on cellular components, the genes were classified into zero categories. In biological process, the enrichments of genes were involved in \"the immune system processes\", for example, \"lymphocyte activation\", \"phagocytosis recognition\" and \"leukocyte activation\". The most over-represented GO term (50.12-fold enrichment) was \"marginal B cell zone differentiation\", involving three genes. Another significant in GO terms that could be emphasized here were \"cell death process\" and \"cell signaling\", since those biological processes were found to be enriched in the target genes of miR-1247-3p. These two terms suggested that miRNAs are tightly involved in activation and signaling at the early phase of viral infection. At the advanced stage, the miRNAs are highly regulated with their targets in the process of the regulation of programed cell death, at the end ( Fig. 8A; Table 1 ). The other up-or down-regulated miRNAs in the current study possessed several hundred to many thousand target genes. No matter how many of the target genes it may involve, there were no significant biological processes that may have been highlighted the relevance in viral infection (Dataset S1). Of particular interest, novel miRNA, namely \"Novel 137\" may have been playing a pivotal role in the defense response to external stimuli. Since the \"intracellular receptor signaling pathway\" and \"histone H4 acetylation\" were two enrichment groups of genes that were highly correlated (Fig. S2) . Furthermore, a gene network was constructed by utilizing the lists of genes involved in multiple biological process in order to illuminate the biological interpretation and meaningful. Of these target genes of differentially expressed miRNA, especially miR-1247-3p, a total of 28 genes was found to be highly diversified in multiple GO terms (Figs. 7B and 8B) . In Figure 8B , the STRING network of PPIs among 28 diversified genes showed highly connected network included 26 genes at the core of the network. The 26 genes in the network were clustered into three groups, categorized by red, green and blue. Two genes (BAX and SOCS5) were excluded from the network, of which, were involved in apoptosis of the cells.",

Compared to recent evidence reported by Sun and coworkers (Sun et al., 2014) , they extensively analyzed the DEGs from miRNA-seq data of the MEV in feline kidney (F81) cell line. They have identified 196 known mammalian miRNAs in their report. Similar to our findings, we have found more known miRNAs in CPV-infected CRFK cells (420 of known miRNAs). Additionally, in MEV-infected cells, they found a minimal number of miRNAs that significantly down-regulated (miR-181b, miR-181d and miR-301) and up-regulated (miR-29b, miR-125b and miR-320a). Consistent with our results, we pinpointed of about three miRNAs that significantly up-regulated in CPV infection (miR-222-5p, miR-1247-3p and miR-365-5p) whereas many more miRNAs were significantly down-regulated (miR-322-5p and miR-361-3p) including Novel 137, Novel 141 and Novel 102 miRNAs. The differences in miRNA species found by two studies reflect the effects of various factors, for example, the virus and cell line used in the studies, which makes it very difficult to compare the results side by side.",

In CRFK infected cells, the gene targets of significant miRNA DEGs functionally belong to immune response (e.g., lymphocyte activation and antibody production), cell communication and signaling, cytokine production, and lastly cell death.

Of particular interests in immunological response to the virus, miR-1247-3p had roughly 229 target genes, whose function can be categorized into 33 GO by GO enrichment analysis (GO biological process term). The miRNA-1247-3p function is estimated to modulate at least 200 genes, involving in 38 GO biological processes (BP) plus molecular function (MF) due to the redundancy with partial target recognition. As stated earlier, miRNA-1247-3p could, at least, be regulated 28 functional genes in our reports, but the actual numbers would be much higher. Our findings in CPV-infection reveal an exceptional function of miR-1247-3p in response to virus, other than the functions as onco-miRNA and controlling of cartilage function (Fang et al., 2018; Martinez-Sanchez & Murphy, 2013) .",

When many affected genes by miRNAs have converged, it will be amplified the signals or expansion of its functions to adjacent gene network. The synergism among genes within GO biological processes in reacting to virus infections, as anticipated in CPV as well, is a common paradigm for effective host defense response. Of the thirty-three GO process categories discovered in the current study, IL-6 was remarkably important cytokine, as a key for marginal zone B cell differentiation, negative regulation of cytokine production, and lymphocyte differentiation, by its action (Safi et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2018) .",
