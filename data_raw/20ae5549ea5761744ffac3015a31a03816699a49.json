Using intracerebral (i.c.) inoculation with mouse polyomavirus (MuPyV), we have shown that CD8 T cells establish a PD-1 hi , tissue-resident memory population in the brains (bT RM ) of mice with a low-level persistent infection. In MuPyV encephalitis, PD-L1 was expressed on infiltrating myeloid cells, microglia and astrocytes, but not on oligodendrocytes. Engagement of PD-1 on anti-MuPyV CD8 T cells limited their effector activity. NanoString gene expression analysis showed that neuroinflammation was higher in PD-L1 \u2212/\u2212 than wild type mice at day 8 post-infection, the peak of the MuPyV-specific CD8 response. During the persistent phase of infection, however, the absence of PD-1 signaling was found to be associated with a lower inflammatory response than in wild type mice. Genetic disruption and intracerebroventricular blockade of PD-1 signaling resulted in an increase in number of MuPyV-specific CD8 bT RM and the fraction of these cells expressing CD103, the \u03b1E integrin commonly used to define tissue-resident T cells. However, PD-L1 \u2212/\u2212 mice persistently infected with MuPyV showed impaired virus control upon i.c. re-infection with MuPyV. Collectively, these data reveal a temporal duality in PD-1-mediated regulation of MuPyV-associated neuroinflammation. PD-1 signaling limited the severity of neuroinflammation during acute infection but sustained a level of inflammation during persistent infection for maintaining control of virus re-infection.",

            "text": "The inhibitory receptor PD-1 plays a dominant role in T cell exhaustion, a state of progressive loss of T cell function resulting from repetitive antigen stimulation such as in chronic viral disease or tumor development (1) . Extensive work using experimental models of chronic infection [lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV)-clone 13, simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)] as well as analysis of T cells from individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus, and hepatitis B virus, demonstrate that blockade of PD-1 signaling restores T cell functionality (2) . Engagement of PD-1 by its ligands PD-L1 (CD274/B7-H1) or PD-L2 (CD273/B7DC) results in recruitment of SHP-phosphatases proximal to the T cell receptor (TCR). These phosphatases inactivate kinase cascades induced by TCR signaling and thereby inhibit downstream pathways required for cytokine production, proliferation, and cytotoxicity (3, 4) . PD-L1 is expressed on a variety of cell types while the expression of PD-L2 is limited to antigen presenting cells (5) (6) (7) . CNS infection with neurotropic coronavirus induced the expression of PD-L1 but not PD-L2 on glia (8) . In addition, only PD-1:PD-L1 interactions are responsible for inhibiting CD8 T cell effector function in mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) CNS infection (9) . PD-1 mediated T cell exhaustion is characterized by increased expression of the transcription factors Eomesodermin (Eomes) and B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein-1 (Blimp-1), co-expression of inhibitory receptors PD-1, Tim3, and 2B4 and diminished effector function [Interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 and degranulation] (2, 10) .",

PD-1 regulates T cell mobility in tissues (14) and T cell survival (10, 15) . Additionally, in chronic high-viremic infections, T cell dysfunction is not absolute as shown by the emergence of CD8 T cell epitope-escape HIV late in infection (16) , and increased viral titers after depletion of CD8 T cells in chronic SIV infection (17, 18) . Recent reports support the concept that CD8 T cell exhaustion is a bona fide state of differentiation adapted by T cells, which enables them to survive and retain functionality during persistent infection (19, 20) . Reversal of T cell exhaustion by blockade of the PD-1:PD-L1 axis indicates that exhausted T cells span a spectrum of dysfunction with the least exhausted cells, characterized as Tim3 \u2212 PD-1 int TCF-1 hi CXCR5 hi cells in LMCV infection (21, 22) , being more susceptible to functional resurrection after checkpoint inhibitor blockade. PD-1 or PD-L1 antibody-mediated blockade has shown remarkable effectiveness for certain types of cancer (23) . Expression of PD-1 has recently been reported in human lung-and brain-resident CD8 T cells, with PD-1 signaling proposed to limit inadvertent deployment of effector mechanisms (24) . Tissue-resident memory CD8 T cells are an essential component of the first line of defense against re-infection in non-lymphoid tissues (24) (25) (26) . Whether PD-1 regulates CD8 T cell activity and affects memory differentiation in non-lymphoid tissues is an open question. Here we asked, in CNS persistent infection, if PD-1 operates to dampen CD8 T cell effector activity and modulate neuroinflammation.",

MuPyV establishes a systemic low-level persistent infection in mice; however, whether the virus persists as a smoldering infection or cycles between latency and reactivation has yet to be experimentally ascertained. Inoculation i.c. with MuPyV gives rise to a stable population of virus-specific PD-1 + tissue-resident memory CD8 T cells in the brain (bT RM ) (27, 28) . Although the role of PD-1 in modulating T cell function has been extensively investigated for virus-specific lymphoid CD8 T cells in the setting of chronic viremia (29) , only a few studies have examined PD-1's impact on T RM responding to a persistent viral CNS infection (8, 9, 30) . In humans, JC polyomavirus (JCPyV) causes several aggressive CNS diseases, the most common being the frequently fatal demyelinating disease progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) (31) . JCP\u03b3V-specific CD8 T cells in PML patients express PD-1 (32) . MCMV, Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV), and JHM mouse hepatitis virus (JHMV) CNS infections demonstrate that excessive CD8 T cell effector activity is immunopathologic (8, 9, 30, 33) . Whether PD-1 regulates neuroinflammation and formation of CD8 T RM in a persistent infection model is incompletely understood.",

In striking contrast, the absence of PD-1 signaling during persistent infection resulted in lower neuroinflammation than in WT mice. PD-1 was further found to affect the differentiation of virus-specific CD8 bT RM . Together, these findings reveal a complex, dynamic impact of PD-1 on neuroinflammation and CD8 bT RM formation and activity during persistent viral encephalitis. (34, 35) .

Brain and spleen cells were stimulated with 1 \u00b5M LT359-368 peptide (SAVKNY(Abu)SKL), no peptide or peptide-pulsed IFN-\u03b3-treated BMDCs for 5-6 h in the presence of brefeldin A, stained for viability and surface markers, fixed, and permeabilized with CytoFix/CytoPerm (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA), then stained for intracellular IFN-\u03b3. Anti-IFN-\u03b3 staining in the absence of peptide was <1% of CD8 + CD44 hi gated cells (data not shown). Samples were acquired on an LSR II or LSRFortessa (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) and data analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR).",

Here, we examined the expression of PD-1 ligands by microglia, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes, as well as by infiltrating monocytes in mice acutely infected with MuPyV (Supplementary Figure 1) . With the exception of oligodendrocytes, all of these cell types variably upregulated PD-L1 after i.c. MuPyV inoculation, with the infiltrating monocytes having the highest frequency of PD-L1 + cells ( Figure 1A) . None of these cells showed expression of PD-L2 (data not shown). Although each of these cell populations was infected by MuPyV, microglia and infiltrating monocytes expressed at least a log higher LT-Ag transcripts than oligodendrocytes ( Figure 1B) . The marginally higher expression of VP1 transcripts in astrocytes vs. oligodendrocytes, while not achieving statistical significance, reinforces previous studies showing that JCPyV more efficiently infects astrocytes than oligodendrocytes in brains of mice engrafted with human glial progenitor cells (47) . We further found that astrocytes, but not oligodendrocytes, express the viral capsid protein, VP1 (Figure 1C) , a result in line with the human chimeric glial mouse-JCPyV infection model showing that astrocytes and not oligodendrocytes support productive infection (47, 48) . In an interesting observation, we found that PD-L1 + astrocytes and microglia harbored a higher viral LT-Ag mRNA load as well ( Figure 1D) . These data show that resident and infiltrating CNS cell types that express PD-L1 are also infected with MuPyV with a positive association between PD-L1 expression and virus infection.",

Upregulation of MHC class II expression on microglia is a commonly used indicator of neuroinflammation (9, 51, 52) . Comparing MHC class II expression on microglia from brains of MuPyV infected WT and PD-L1 \u2212/\u2212 mice, we found significantly higher I-A b (MHC class II) surface expression on microglia from PD-L1 \u2212/\u2212 mice at 8 dpi ( Figure 3A) ; however, by 45 dpi MHC II expression levels on microglia of WT and PD-L1 \u2212/\u2212 mice were comparable ( Figure 3B) . These data point toward an acute-to-persistent infection phase remission of the heightened inflammatory environment in the PD-L1 \u2212/\u2212 mice. Furthermore, we found that brain microglia from mice that were adoptively transferred with IFN-\u03b3-sufficient MuPyV-specific TCR transgenic CD8 T cells upregulated I-A b expression, but no I-A b upregulation was seen in mice that received IFN-\u03b3 deficient-transgenic TCR CD8 T cells ( Figure 3C) . These data support the likelihood that IFN-\u03b3 released by CNS-infiltrating, virus-specific CD8 T cells contributes to neuroinflammation during MuPyV encephalitis.",

At 8 dpi, a higher number of genes were upregulated in PD-L1 \u2212/\u2212 (50 genes) vs. WT mice (25 genes) ( Figure 4A) . However, in persistent infection, the inflammatory landscape profoundly changed, and did so differently between WT and PD-L1 \u2212/\u2212 mice. For example, in WT mice, a number of genes were uniquely expressed in the 8 dpi and 35 dpi datasets. In contrast, the gene set upregulated in PD-L1 \u2212/\u2212 mice at 35 dpi represented a subset of those same genes that were upregulated at 8 dpi (Figures 4B,C) . These differences were further reinforced by principal component analysis (PCA) which showed that the inflammatory gene expression profile in the brains of WT mice at 35 dpi were significantly different from both uninfected as well as 8 dpi WT mice (Figure 4D) . These observations suggest that the neuroinflammatory environment changes considerably over the course of MuPyV infection in the WT mice, while PD-L1 \u2212/\u2212 mice show fewer differences between acute and persistent infection.",

In MCMV infection, PD-1 signaling promoted bT RM formation, but had no effect on virus control (53) . However, unlike in MCMV acute infection, PD-L1 \u2212/\u2212 mice showed only a modest, albeit significant, increase in the number of the D b LT359-tetramer + CD8 T cells; this increase was not seen in the spleen (Figure 6A) . Unexpectedly, the frequency as well as number of D b LT359-specific CD8 T cells expressing CD103 were modestly higher in persistently infected PD-L1 \u2212/\u2212 mice than WT mice (Figure 6B) . We independently confirmed this apparent inverse relationship between PD-1 signaling and CD103 expression on MuPyV-specific CD8 T cells by continuous two-week delivery of anti-PD-1 vs. control IgG in persistently infected WT mice ( Figure 6C) . Interestingly, viral load was unaffected upon either Pdcd1 ablation or antibody-mediated blockade of the PD-1 signaling (Figure 6C and Supplementary Figure 5C) . TGF-\u03b2 produced by CD25 + FoxP3 + CD4 + T cells induces CD103 (55) . During the acute phase of infection, brain infiltrating CD25 + FoxP3 + CD4 + T cells were found to express PD-1. Also, PD-L1 \u2212/\u2212 mice had moderately higher numbers of CD25 + FoxP3 + CD4 T cells compared to the WT mice (Supplementary Figures 4A,B) . This increase coincides with higher TGF-\u03b2 transcripts in the PD-L1 \u2212/\u2212 mice (Supplementary Figure 4C) . These data suggest that the expression of PD-1 on brain infiltrating CD4 T cells could be regulating the observed CD8 T cell response and phenotype in PD-L1 \u2212/\u2212 mice.",

Decreased IRF4 expression was not only restricted to the immunodominant D b LT359 tetramer + CD8 T cells, but was also seen in the D b LT359 tetramer \u2212 CD8 T cells (Supplementary Figure 6A) . To see if the difference in IRF4 expression stemmed from differences in TCR affinity, we performed 2D micropipette cell adhesion assays. Interestingly, no difference in TCR affinities between the D b LT359-specific CD8 T cells from WT and PD-L1 \u2212/\u2212 mice was detected ( Figure 6E) . Expression of LT-Ag transcript in the brain was also found to be similar between WT and PD-L1 \u2212/\u2212 mice, negating the possibility that differences in the expression of IRF4 could be ascribed to the differences in antigen expression (Supplementary Figure 6B) .

Thus, we asked if MuPyV-specific CD8 bT RM developing in the absence of PD-1 signaling undergo terminal exhaustion as an alternative explanation for lower TCR signal strength. Genetic deficiency of PD-L1, did not change the expression of PD-1, 2B4, or Tim3 by MuPyVspecific CD8 T cells (Figure 6F) . Lack of PD-1 signaling also did not affect the expression of the transcription factors Eomes, Blimp-1 and TCF-1 (all known to be associated with exhaustion) by D b LT359-specific CD8 T cells (Figure 6F) . TCF1 hi CXCR5 hi CD8 T cells have been recently defined as the PD-1 + memory subset in LCMV clone 13 infections that exhibited less exhaustion and improved functionality upon PD-1 blockade (21, 22) . In analogous fashion, we found that D b LT359-specific CD8 bT RM in PD-L1 \u2212/\u2212 mice had higher numbers of TCF1 hi CXCR5 hi cells ( Figure 6G) . Taken together, these findings suggest that loss of PD-1 signaling during MuPyV-encephalitis led to increased CD103 expression and did not guide CD8 bT RM toward terminal exhaustion.",

CD103 expression has been associated with improved functionality in CD8 T RM cells (56) . To test bT RM recall responsiveness, we re-inoculated >45 dpi WT and PD-L1 \u2212/\u2212 mice i.c. with MuPyV and compared their ability to control this homologous virus challenge. Five days after re-inoculation, persistently infected WT and PD-L1 \u2212/\u2212 mice showed similar increases in numbers of total CD8 T cells, but significantly more D b LT359-specific CD8 T cells were seen only in the brains of the re-infected WT mice ( Figure 7A) . The difference between total and virus-specific CD8 T cell numbers in the re-infected WT mice suggested that this increase was predominantly due to recall expansion of anti-MuPyV CD8 bT RM rather than recruitment. Importantly, re-infected PD-L1 \u2212/\u2212 mice had an \u223c87-fold increase in virus load in the brain, whereas WT mice showed roughly a 6-fold increase in virus levels ( Figure 7B ). D b LT359-specific CD8 T cells from the brains of WT and PD-L1 \u2212/\u2212 mice at day 5 post-challenge also exhibited similar abilities to produce IFN-\u03b3 and degranulate (e.g., CD107a/b + ) upon LT359 peptide stimulation ( Figure 7C) . The recall response upon re-infection was mainly due to the activation of CD103 + cells, as only CD103 + cells showed high proliferative potential as indicated by their Ki67 expression. We also observed a moderate decrease in Ki67 + cells in PD-L1 \u2212/\u2212 mice ( Figure 7D) . These observations are in line with data in Figure 5B and Supplementary Figure 3 , showing PD-1 signaling deficiency results in failure to sustain an inflammatory environment, resulting in poorer virus control. Moreover, these data support the likelihood that neuroinflammatory factors induced by PD-1 signaling are required to maintain immunologic defense against resurgence of a persistent viral encephalitis.",

For example, VSV and LCMV-Armstrong generate PD-1 \u2212 CD103 + CD8 bT RM , but CD8 bT RM in TMEV and MCMV encephalitis are PD-1 + CD103 + (53, (57) (58) (59) . In contrast, during persistent MuPyV encephalitis, virus-specific CD8 T cells are uniformly PD-1 + , but only \u223c40% express CD103 (28) . In addition, irrespective of CD103 status, MuPyV-specific CD8 bT RM are maintained stably independent of resupply from the circulation; and CD103 + and CD103 \u2212 cells have highly overlapping transcriptomes (28, 60) . However, the CD103 + subset preferentially produces IFN-\u03b3 (28, 60) and proliferates upon i.c. MuPyV re-infection ( Figure 7D) . Moreover, PD-L1 \u2212/\u2212 mice have diminished ability to control virus levels upon homologous virus re-infection, despite having a higher proportion of CD103 + MuPyV-specific CD8 bT RM than WT mice. Although CD103 expression has been linked to CD8 bT RM formation in response to VSV CNS infection (61) , other studies show that CD8 T cell motility in the small intestine mucosa and brain are not dependent on CD103 (58, 62) . In addition, intestinal pathogen-specific CD8 T RM to oral Yersinia pseudotuberculosis infection are comprised of CD103 + and CD103 \u2212 populations, with the latter preferentially localizing to infectious foci (63) . In sum, the potential contributions of CD103 to anatomical localization and function of CD8 T cells in different tissues and in the setting of different pathogen infections remain to be determined.",

            "text": "CD4 T cell-derived cytokines may be involved in upregulating CD103 on CD8 T RM . Nearly all MuPyV-specific CD8 T cells in the brains of CD4 T cell-deficient mice are CD103 \u2212 (60). TGF\u03b2 induces CD103 on T RM (64) (65) (66) ; more TGF-\u03b21 transcripts are detected in brains of PD-L1 \u2212/\u2212 than WT mice persistently infected with MuPyV (Supplementary Figure 4C) . In this connection, all CD25 + CD4 T cells isolated from the brains of acutely MuPyV infected mice are PD-1 + and a fraction are FoxP3 + as well (Supplementary Figures 4A,B) . Together, these data raise the possibility that, in the absence of inhibitory PD-1 signaling, CD4 T cells in the brain produce more cytokines that induce CD103 expression on CD8 bT RM . PD-1 expression by CD8 T cells may not inevitably result in T cell exhaustion. PD-1 has been shown to be dispensable for CD8 T cell exhaustion in chronic LCMV infection (10) . Severity and duration of chronic viral infections are associated with expression of multiple inhibitory receptors by CD8 T cells in addition to PD-1 (67) . In infected WT and PD-L1 \u2212/\u2212 mice, however, PD-1 + D b LT359 specific CD8 bT RM cells expressed equivalent levels of Tim3 and 2B4. Expression of the Blimp1, Eomes and TCF-1 transcription factors was also unaffected by the absence of PD-1 signaling. LT359 peptide-stimulated bT RM from WT and PD-L1 \u2212/\u2212 mice were similarly capable of IFN-\u03b3 production and degranulation, indicating retention of function independent of PD-1 signaling. MuPyV-specific CD8 bT RM from WT and PD-L1 \u2212/\u2212 mice also expressed similar levels of PD-1 during persistent infection. We recently reported that PD-1 downregulation on splenic MuPyV-specific CD8 T cells is followed by Pdcd1 promoter loci remethylation (28) . PD-1 is stably expressed on anti-MuPyV bT RM in PD-L1 \u2212/\u2212 mice. These data support the interpretation that PD-1 signaling does not regulate the methylation status of the Pdcd1 gene promotor. In the brains of PD-L1 \u2212/\u2212 mice a number of upstream regulators were enriched during acute infection but reduced or below threshold during persistent infection (e.g., IFN-\u03b3, IL-15, NOS, NFATC2, and IL12-A), suggesting dynamic epigenetic changes in these genes in the absence of PD-1 signaling.",

Yet, PD-L1 in mouse coronavirus encephalomyelitis is only transiently and poorly expressed on microglia, although oligodendrocytes exhibit high and sustained expression (8) . In MCMV encephalitis, microglia and astrocytes express PD-L1 (9) . In MuPyV infection, PD-L1 was expressed on the infiltrating monocytes, microglia and astrocytes, but not on oligodendrocytes. IFN-\u03b3 is a potent inducer of PD-L1 (9) . The positive correlation between viral LT-Ag mRNA and PD-L1 expression in MuPyV-infected brain cells could be a result of contact of the infected cells with IFN-\u03b3secreting CD8 T cells. A similar mechanism termed \"adaptive resistance\" dampens anti-tumor CD8 effector activity (70, 71) .",

Compared to WT mice, PD-L1 deficiency during acute infection involved upregulated expression of more genes and enrichment of neuroinflammatory pathways (Figures 4, 5 and  Supplementary Figure 3 ). Of these, brains of PD-L1 \u2212/\u2212 mice showed exclusive enrichment of NF-\u03baB and apoptotic pathways, as well as IL-9, IL-12, and IL-3 signaling pathways ( Figure 5 and Supplementary Figure 3) . Although the inflammation transcriptome changed considerably as infection transitioned from acute to persistent infection in WT mice, it failed to do so in PD-L1 \u2212/\u2212 mice ( Figure 4D ). Despite this difference, WT and PD-L1 \u2212/\u2212 mice shared the IL-15 signaling pathway as an upstream regulator. IL-15 is of particular interest, because it is expressed by CNS parenchymal cells as well as by infiltrating immune cells in response to an ongoing inflammatory insult (72) . In addition, IL-15 limits apoptosis in neuronal cells and suppresses nitric oxide production in neurons (72) . The importance of IL-15 in memory CD8 T cell differentiation and establishing CD8 T RM in barrier tissues are well documented (73) (74) (75) (76) . An intriguing possibility is that a deficiency in IL-15 in PD-L1 deficient mice underlies the compromised ability of CD8 T cells to control virus levels upon re-infection and promotes neural cell death during persistent infection.",

Genes in this pathway were found to be significantly enriched in persistently, but not acutely infected, WT mice with the reverse seen in PD-L1 \u2212/\u2212 mice (Figure 5) . Type I and II IFNs have been shown to inhibit JCPyV replication in glial cells in vitro (77, 78) . In a clinical trial to evaluate IFN-\u03b3 as a prophylactic therapy for opportunistic infections in HIV + patients, none receiving IFN-\u03b3 developed PML while 10% of those in the placebo group did (79) . Type I IFNs have been shown to enhance the cytolytic activity of airway-resident memory CD8 T cells a secondary respiratory virus challenge (80) . We reported that Type I and Type II IFNs inhibit MuPyV replication in vitro and in peripherally inoculated mice, that MuPyV infection in vitro and in vivo induces IFN-\u03b2 mRNA, and that Type I IFN regulates MuPyV-specific CD8 T cell memory differentiation and function (81, 82) . JCPyV, as well as BKPyV and SV40, infections induce a STAT1-dependent upregulation of interferon-stimulated genes and production of IFN-\u03b2 (83, 84) . Thus, differences in IFN signaling pathways in WT and PD-L1 \u2212/\u2212 mice may reflect dynamic changes over the course of MuPyV encephalitis in Type I IFN-mediated innate immunity and/or Type II IFN production by CNS-infiltrating virus-specific T cells. It merits emphasizing, however, that the NanoString data do not establish a temporal link between PD-1 signaling and CD8 bT RM development.",

Defects in the PD-1:PD-L1 signaling pathway may lead to increased neuroinflammation at the peak of the CD8 bT RM response, but neuroinflammation was not maintained during the persistent phase of this viral encephalitis. Thus, the inhibitory functions of PD-1 are necessary for the generation of a controlled, sustained inflammatory response in the CNS. These findings offer insights into the role of PD-1 in modulating an immune response of a persistent viral infection in the CNS beyond its documented function as a CD8 T cell inhibitory receptor. ",
