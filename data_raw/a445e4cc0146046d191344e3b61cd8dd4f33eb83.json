Compared with control subjects, infections with HCoV-229E (OR = 5.15, 95%CI = 2.24-11.78), HCoV-OC43 (OR = 6.16, 95%CI = 1.77-21.65) and combine HCoVs (OR = 2.36, 95%CI = 1.5 = 3.72) were associated with upper respiratory tract infections.

The majority of ARI are of viral origin including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Influenza viruses, Rhinoviruses, Parainfluenza viruses, Human metapneumovirus and human coronaviruses (HCoVs) [4] [5] [6] [7] . Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped RNA viruses and belong to the family Coronaviridae and subfamily Coronavirinae. CoVs are positive strand viruses with genome sizes ranging from 27-33 kilobases (kb). They are classified into four genera named Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus [8] . HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E belong to the alphacoronaviruses while HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) belong to the betacoronaviruses [8] . A recent HCoV that was first identified in the Middle East region is termed Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and belongs to the genus Betacoronavirus [9] . Despite the detection of MERS-CoV-related sequences in bats worldwide and neutralising antibodies against MERS-CoV in camels, the evolutionary source of this novel HCoV still remains unclear [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] .",

Some studies in developed countries have reported HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E to be responsible for up to 10% of upper respiratory tract infections [18, 19] whereas others identified these viruses along with HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 to be more prevalent in severe respiratory tract infections of immunocompromised individuals, institutional elderly subjects and infants [20] [21] [22] [23] . Severe infections and deaths have been associated with MERS-CoV infections [17, [24] [25] [26] [27] . Other studies on the contrary identified HCoVs to be quite common in healthy individuals thus raising questions about its association with respiratory illness [28, 29] . Finally, even though HCoVs are believed to be most relevant in young children, the contribution of these viruses to disease in older children and adults still needs to be addressed worldwide [30] .",

A non-parametric K-sample test on the equality of medians was used to evaluate the differences in the medians of the various subgroups of the continuous variables. The association of HCoVs with upper respiratory tract infection was assessed by fitting five logistic regression models controlling for age group, age as a continuous variable and study communities. Results were expressed as adjusted odd ratios and 95% confidence interval (CI). Graphs were plotted using ggplot2 package [38] and R base plots. For all analysis, a two-sided p-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant.",

These differences did not change significantly when low viral loads of less than 100 copies per RT-PCR reaction were excluded from the analysis. Robustness of results against the exclusion of low-copy samples is important, as RT-PCR suffers from inconsistencies at the lower end of the detection range, in particular if carried out in settings with only a basic level of training and technology, such as in this study. Caveats include the potential of contamination of test tubes with low copy numbers of target RNA template. Moreover, test sensitivity can vary greatly at the lower end of the detection range, which is why we have demonstrated for our methodology that more useful results are achieved at levels above 100 copies per reaction.",

This scenario cannot be ruled out, especially because HCoV-NL63 has generally been associated with mild respiratory infection.

A further explanation of this overestimation might be the persistent or residual RNA fragments in the respiratory tract of adults. This phenomenon of RNA persistence was generally described for other respiratory viruses in children [42] [43] [44] .

Other tropical countries like Thailand have however reported peak detections of HCoV-OC43 in winter whereas HCoV-NL63 occurred frequently in autumn [29] . In sub-Saharan African countries with unique seasonal patterns such as harmattan and wet seasons, the circulation of HCoVs tends to be different. Our study recorded high detection rates of HCoVs in the harmattan and the wet seasons compared to the other seasons. Possible explanations for this include seasonal variations in host immune status to infection [47] and changes in humidity which increase viral survival in the environment [48] . In the harmattan season for instance humidity is extremely low with heavy amount of dust that could injure the respiratory system thus exposing individuals to infection [49] .

We also did not find variation in strains from the different communities as well as between cases and controls. This contrasts the observation of variable sequences from the spike region of HCoV-NL63 detected in three different years in the United States of America [51] . It is conceivable that connectivity on an international scale contributes to the variability of the spectrum of prevalent viruses in communities. Such connectivity may be low in the remote communities investigated here.",
