            "text": "Enterovirus (EV) 71 infection is known to cause hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) and in severe cases, induces neurological disorders culminating in fatality. An outbreak of EV71 in South East Asia in 1997 affected over 120,000 people and caused neurological disorders in a few individuals. The control of EV71 infection through public health interventions remains minimal and treatments are only symptomatic. Recently, human scavenger receptor class B, member 2 (SCARB2) has been reported to be a cellular receptor of EV71. We expressed human SCARB2 gene in NIH3T3 cells (3T3-SCARB2) to study the mechanisms of EV71 entry and infection. We demonstrated that human SCARB2 serves as a cellular receptor for EV71 entry. Disruption of expression of SCARB2 using siRNAs can interfere EV71 infection and subsequent inhibit the expression of viral capsid proteins in RD and 3T3-SCARB2 but not Vero cells. SiRNAs specific to clathrin or dynamin or chemical inhibitor of clathrin-mediated endocytosis were all capable of interfering with the entry of EV71 into 3T3-SCARB2 cells. On the other hand, caveolin specific siRNA or inhibitors of caveolae-mediated endocytosis had no effect, confirming that only clathrin-mediated pathway was involved in EV71 infection. Endocytosis of EV71 was also found to be pHdependent requiring endosomal acidification and also required intact membrane cholesterol. In summary, the mechanism of EV71 entry through SCARB2 as the receptor for attachment, and its cellular entry is through a clathrin-mediated and pHdependent endocytic pathway. This study on the receptor and endocytic mechanisms of EV71 infection is useful for the development of effective medications and prophylactic treatment against the enterovirus.",

PSGL-1 is a sialomucin membrane protein widely expressed in leukocytes that plays a role in early stages of inflammation [18, 19, 20] . SCARB2, also called lysosomal integral membrane protein 2 or CD36b like-2, has two transmembrane domains with the N and C termini located in the cytosol [21] . It is expressed in many tissues, participates in membrane transport and the reorganization of the endosomal/ lysosomal compartment [22] and high density lipoprotein endocytosis (HDL) [23] . Based on their PSGL-1-binding capability, different EV71 isolates are classified into PSGL-1-dependent and PSGL-1-independent strains. SK-EV006 (genogroup B3), C7/Osaka (B4), KED005 (C1), 1095 (C2) and 75-Yamagata (C4) are PSGL-1-dependent strains. BrCr (genogroup A), Nagoya (B1), and 02363 (C1) are PSGL-1-independent isolates [16, 24] . Some EV71 strains such as BrCr (A), Nagoya (B1), and Isehara (C) have been reported to utilize SCARB2 as a receptor. Expression of human SCARB2 receptor in unsusceptible cell lines was found to facilitate these strains of EV71 and coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16) infection resulting in the development of cytopathic effects [17] .",

Although the endocytic pathways used by some viruses, such as influenza virus [25] , hepatitis C virus (HCV) [26] , respiratory syncytia virus (RSV) [27, 28] , severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [29] , vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) [30, 31] , simian virus 40 (SV40) [32] , Ebola virus [33] , and echovirus I [34] have been determined. Viruses entering cells through clathrin-or caveolin-mediated endocytosis, as well as clathrin-and caveolinindependent pathways have been reported [35, 36, 37] . In clathrinmediated endocytosis, virus-bound receptors are targeted to clathrin-coated pits (CCPs), which mature into clathrin coated vesicles (CCVs) resulting in the internalization of viruses with their receptors. Caveolin-mediated endocytosis is also a well-characterized process, which involves the association of glycolipid rafts of plasma membrane with caveolins resulting in their internalization [37] . Dynamins, the large GTPase of molecular size 100 KDa are involved in the budding and scission of nascent vesicles from the parent membranes during clathrin-mediated endocytosis [38, 39] . Several studies have identified the recruitment of dynamin to the neck of nascent CCVs prior to fission [40, 41, 42] . Additionally, dynamins have been implicated in the budding of caveolin, phagocytosis and vesicle cycling at the neuron-muscular junction [43] . Recent study has mapped the encoding sequence at the region of amino acid 142 to 204 of human SCARB2 that is critical for EV71 binding and infection [44] . The clathrin-mediated endocytosis as the entry pathway for EV71 infection was identified [45] . However, the detail of receptor-mediated entry mechanism for EV71 has still needs more exploration.",

We have infected the SCARB2overexpressing NIH3T3 cells (3T3-SCARB2), RD, and Vero cells with EV71/E59 strain, a B4 sub-genotype isolated in Taiwan in 2002. Expression of SCARB2 had made the 3T3-SCARB2 and RD cells susceptible to EV71 infection, proving that SCARB2 is a functional receptor of EV71. Both viral infection and replication was well supported in 3T3-SCARB2 and RD cells, while SCARB2-independent EV71 susceptibility was observed in Vero cells. We demonstrates that EV71 entry into 3T3-SCARB2 is through clathrin-dependent endocytosis which was inhibited significantly by knocking down the clathrin or dynamin expression using specific siRNAs or by using inhibitors of clathrin-dependent endocytosis. Moreover, the examined endocytosis of EV71 is pHdependent as it was inhibited by endosomal acidification inhibitors. Taken together, our results demonstrate that EV71 binds to SCARB2 and triggers a clathrin-and dynamin-dependent endocytosis for its entry.",

The expressed SCARB2 protein was identified to have a molecular weight of 80 KDa and the determined expression level was very high in 3T3-SCARB2, moderate in RD cells, but very little in Vero cells. No SCARB2 was detected in the cell lysate from NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 1A) . The following treatment of cells with permealization/fixation solution and then analyzed by flow cytometry also confirmed the cytosolic expression of SCARB2 in 3T3-SCARB2, RD, and Vero cells (Fig. 1B) . However, flow analysis of NIH3T3, 3T3-SCARB2, RD, and Vero cells that pretreated with a non-permealization/fixation solution to maintain the intact membrane structure could not detect SCARB2 on the surface (data not shown). It is probably due to SCARB2 dynamically cycling between the endosomal/lysosomal compartments and plasma membrane while transports cellular proteins from outside of cells into the cells [23] . Moreover, another identified EV71 receptor, PSGL-1, usually expressed in leukocytes [16] . Our RT-PCR analysis also revealed that NIH3T3, Vero and RD cells did not express PSGL-1 (data not shown).",

Cytopathic effects were observed in 3T3-SCARB2, RD, and Vero cells. The expression of EV71 capsid proteins namely VP2 and VP4 in the infected cells was demonstrated by western blot using a VP2-specific monoclonal antibody MAB979 which has been identified [47] . Previous studies showed that multiple capsid proteins of VP0 (38 KDa, a precursor product of VP2+VP4), VP1 (36 KDa), VP2 (28 KDa), VP3 (25 KDa) and VP4 (8 KDa) were detected in the EV71-infected cells [48, 49, 50] . Corroborating these findings, we observed that 3T3-SCARB2, Vero and RD cells infected with EV71 were able to express capsid proteins with molecular weights in the range of 38 KDa (for VP0), and 28 KDa (for VP2), and 25 KDa (for VP3) ( Fig. 2A) . In NIH3T3 cells, neither the cytopathic effect nor the expression of viral capsid proteins was seen confirming that these cells were unsusceptible to EV71 infection and that SCARB2 expression had converted it into a susceptible cell line. The expression level of viral capsid protein was found to synchronize with the increase in multiplicity of infection (MOI) of EV71 from 0.04 to 1. The level of expression of viral capsid protein was the highest in 3T3-SCARB2 cells, moderate in RD cells and the lowest in Vero cells, in which were corresponding to the individual were infected with two different MOI of EV71 and then cultured for 48 hours. After incubation, cell lysates were prepared for western blot using anticapsid MAB979 antibody. (B) Immune plaque forming assay was performed in four different cells infected with 10-fold serial diluted 10 8 pfu/ml stocks of EV71 as described in the Materials and Methods. The immuno-stained plaques were counted and photography was taken. (C) NIH3T3 or SCARB2expressing NIH3T3, RD, and Vero cells cultured in 96-well plate were inoculated with various MOI of EV71 for one hour at room temperature.

By comparison of the order of the susceptibility to EV71 infection (3T3-SCARB2.Vero.RD) with the level of SCARB2 expression (3T3-SCARB2.RD.Vero), it is possible that Vero cells possess other binding proteins to support EV71 infection.",

The expression of dominant-negative dynamin mutants (dynamin K44A ) has been shown to block the formation of clathrin-coated pits and vesicles [55, 56] . These observations have prompted us to investigate whether dynamin may also play a role in EV71 entry mechanism. Dynamin-2 expression could be inhibited after 24 and 48 hours of 3T3-SCARB2 cells transfected with 200 pmoles of dynamin-2specific siRNA as judged by the detection of dynamin (,100 KDa) in the immunoblot assay (the top panel of Fig. 6 ). Dynamin-2specific siRNA pretreatment of 3T3-SCARB2 cells affected the EV71 virus replication in a dose-dependent manner. The production of viral capsid proteins was completely inhibited in cells transfected with 200 pmoles of dynamin-2 siRNA, whereas only moderate inhibition of viral capsid protein was seen in cells treated with 100 pmoles of dynamin-2 siRNA (Fig. 6) . Our observations confirm that dynamin plays a crucial role in EV71 endocytosis through clathrin-mediated pathway.",

Caveolae have been implicated in the uptake of viruses such as SV40, polyomavirus, ebola virus, echovirus I, lentivirus, and others [28, 31, 32, 33, 34, 57] . In the study of caveolae-mediated virus entry, genistein, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, can interrupt caveolaemediated endocytosis [58, 59, 60] , and filipin, a cholesterol-binding agent, is capable of disrupting the caveolar structure and function [61, 62, 63] , were subjected to test the ability in the inhibition of EV71 infection using a two-fold of the maximally effective dose that has been reported [58, 61, 62] . 3T3-SCARB2 cells were treated with genistein prior to the infection with EV71. Maximal dose of 20 mg/mL genistein had no inhibitory effect on the endocytosis of EV71 in infected 3T3-SCARB2 cells (Fig. 7A) , as compared to the control group of A549 cells which pre-treated with the same dose of genistein was significantly resistant to lentivirus-eGFP infection (Fig. 7B) . Similar result was observed in 3T3-SCARB2 cells pre-treated with the maximal dose of 2 mg/mL filipin that had no inhibition in EV71 entry into 3T3-SCARB2 cells (Fig. 8A) . It was in contrast to the significant suppression of the uptake of alexa fluor 594 cholera toxin subunit B (CT-B) conjugate in 3T3-SCARB2 cells by the same dose of filipin (Fig. 8B) . The mechanism of cholera toxin internalization through caveolae endocytosis has been confirmed [62] . Caveolin riched in NIH3T3 cells was known [64] . We further knocked down the endogenous caveolin-1 (CAV-1) by specific siRNA. Caveolin expression could be inhibited after 24 and 48 hours of 3T3-SCARB2 cells transfected with 100 pmoles of CAV-1 siRNA as judged by immunoblot of the caveolin (22 KDa) (the top panel of Fig. 8C ). However, 3T3-SCARB2 cells pre-treated with CAV-1 siRNA did not resist from EV71 infection (Fig. 8C) . These results show clearly that EV71 entry using SCARB2 receptor is through clathrin-but not caveolae-dependent endocytosis.",

Some viruses like RSV, SV40, measles virus, herpes simplex virus I, vaccinia virus and HIV-1 are insensitive to lysosomotropic agents [27, 65, 66, 67] which are able to block endosomal acidification. For most viruses using clathrin-mediated endocytosis, transition from early-to-late stage endosome is pH-dependent [65] . After endocytosis, viruses containing early endosmoes are configured to form acidic (pH 6.0 to 6.5) vesicles and become progressively more acidic as they mature to form late endosomes (pH 5.5 to 6.0). Progressive acidification of endosomes is required for the internalized viruses to establish their infection [65, 68] .",

Previous studies with EV71 indicate that SCARB2 [17] and PSGL-1 [16] serve as cellular receptors for EV71 infection. Although endogenous mouse SCARB2 expressed by NIH3T3 cells has 85.8% homology to human SCARB2, it seems not to participate in the acute infection of NIH3T3 cells with EV71. Only 3T3-SCARB2 cells that overexpress human SCARB2 were highly susceptible to EV71, confirming that the expressed human SCARB2 serves as a receptor conferring susceptibility to EV71 infection. We have also observed that NIH3T3 cells cultured with EV71 for a long time (.5 days), showed some non-specific infection and replication of the virus, as indicated by the cytopathic effect and plaque formation (data not shown). This might be due to either mouse SCARB2 or some other cell surface protein functioning as a receptor for EV71, albeit with very low specificity. Mouse SCARB2 is a poor receptor for EV71 infection of mouse cells was also confirmed by Yamayoshi et al. [74] . In addition, Vero cells that are used as hosts for EV71 infection and production [16, 75] have marginal expression of SCARB2 but no expression of PSGL-1 confirming earlier observation [16] . It is possible that the apparently low expression of SCARB2 in Vero cells might be due to low affinity of the experimental-used anti-SCARB2 polyclonal antibody towards green monkey SCARB2. Additionally, siRNA specific to SCARB2 could not inhibit EV71 infection in Vero cells even though the expression level of SCARB2 was impaired (Fig. 5) , indicating that in these cells some other protein functions as a receptor for EV71 entry.",

The cells were washed three times with serum-containing culture medium and after additional 24 hours of culturing in the presence of the inhibitor, the cells were harvested and lysed for immunoblotting using MAB979 antibody. For lentivirus-eGFP infection, 4610 5 A549 cells were seeded in a 12-well plate one day prior to the treatment with genistein (dissolved in 0.1% DMSO) or vehicle alone for one hour and then infected with lentivirus-eGFP (MOI = 0.1). After infection, cells were washed and then following cell culture until 72 hours. Without infection with lentivirus-eGFP of A549 cells were included as GFP negative control. The same field of fluorescent and visible pictures was taken under the UVfluorescent microscopy (Olympus DP70) and GFP-positive cells were counted. For the assay of the internalization of cholera toxin subunit B (CT-B), 1610 5 3T3-SCARB2 cells were grew on a coverslip one day and then washed to remove any serum prior to the treatment with filipin (dissolved in 0.1% DMSO vehicle) or vehicle alone for one hour at 37 o C.

After 30 minutes incubation, cells were washed and either fixed immediately. The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 minutes at 37 o C and washed three times in PBS. The slides were then mounted with a coverslip and the cells observed in the same field of fluorescent and visible pictures was taken by the confocal microscopy (Leica TCS SP5 II).",

After 24 or 48 hours of transfection, cells were following lysed and detected the content of clathrin light chain B (CLTB) by Western blot using anti-clathrin antibody. Relative expression of siRNAtargeting genes shown in the top panel represented the relative CLTB protein levels of the cells transfected with specific siRNA, compared to the expression in 48 hours transfection of the cells with 100 pmoles control siRNA (Mock) as 1.0 was shown. Lysates were also prepared after 24 or 48 hours of EV71 infection and subjected to analyze the expression of synthetic EV71 capsid protein by western blot using MAB979 antibody. The result was shown in the lower panel. Cellular b-actin was detected by blotting the same membrane with monoclonal anti-b-actin antibody.
