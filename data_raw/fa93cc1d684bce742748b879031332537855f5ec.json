This study evaluated whether postoperative maintenance doses of corticosteroids had an adverse effect on FVFG outcomes in patients with corticosteroid-induced ONFH. We retrospectively reviewed the records of 39 patients (67 hips) who had received maintenance doses of corticosteroids following FVFG. This group was matched to a group of patients who had not received corticosteroids treatment after operation. The mean follow-up duration was 5.4 years for the postoperative corticosteroid administration group (PCA group) and 5.0 years for the control group. At the latest follow-up, the average increase in Harris hip score was 11.1 \u00b1 8.7 points for all hips in the PCA group and 12.6 \u00b1 7.4 points for all hips in the control group ( > 0.05). In the PCA group, through radiographic evaluation, 49 hips were improved, 10 hips appeared unchanged, and 8 hips appeared worse. In the control group, 47 hips were improved, 13 hips appeared unchanged, and 7 hips appeared worse. The results suggested that postoperative maintenance doses of corticosteroids do not have an adverse effect on FVFG outcomes in patients with corticosteroidinduced ONFH.",

The corticosteroid dose of these patients is subsequently gradually decreased to a maintenance dose (daily prednisolone-equivalent dose is 10 mg or below) as clinical improvement is achieved. Maintenance doses of corticosteroids can be given for three months to several years. For some patients, ONFH was first recognized when they were receiving maintenance doses of corticosteroids for their autoimmune diseases. Most of these patients should receive operation immediately, because it is easier to get the satisfactory prognosis at the early stage of ONFH [3, 4] . After operation, maintaining continuous treatment of the primary disease does not permit cessation of corticosteroid in most of them. However, corticosteroids have harmful impact on the femoral head at many aspects. Takano-Murakami et al. found that supraphysiologic doses of glucocorticoids suppressed osteoblast proliferation and the recruitment of osteoclast precursors [5] . Corticosteroids also promote bone marrow stromal cells to develop into adipocytes, while increasing the size of fat cells [6, 7] . Drescher et al. believed that methylprednisolone enhances contraction of the femoral head's lateral epiphyseal arteries and reduces femoral head blood flow [8] . In this case, the adverse impact of corticosteroids on the femoral head might still exist after operation. It is widely accepted that high dose 2",

            "text": "The current operations to treat ONFH include core decompression, proximal femoral osteotomy, vascularized bone grafting, and total hip arthroplasty. For many young patients, hip replacement cannot be expected to last the patient's lifetime. Therefore, attempts should be made to save the femoral head prior to collapse. Conservative treatment is only recommended for patients in preliminary stages of ONFH when symptoms are not significant. The outcome is usually poor with this option, due to the natural history of ONFH [13] . Core decompression is a less invasive surgery and theoretically interrupts the process of ONFH to heal the femoral head [14] . However, conflicting clinical results and the variable natural history of ONFH make interpretation of these studies difficult. The osteotomy was reported to have favourable results in treating ONFH [15] . However, the success of the osteotomy is related to the extent and location of the necrotic lesions. The complication of the osteotomy, such as shortening of the leg and gait abnormalities, remains a concern [16] . Free vascularised fibular grafting is an appealing alternative to core decompression for treatment of ONFH, especially for patients with subchondral bone collapse. During the procedure, the necrotic bone is excised, which may interrupt the cycle of ischaemia and intraosseous hypertension and promote local revascularisation. Then the defect is filled with osteoinductive graft to support the subchondral surface. After the surgery, a period of limited weightbearing benefits the healing construct. Yoo et al. reviewed 81 hips that received FVFG, with a mean follow-up period of 5.2 years and found that 71% had radiological improvement [17] . Judet and Gilbert assessed 68 hips with an average follow-up of 18 years, and found that good results were achieved in 80% of the patients [18] . Berend et al. found that patients with postcollapse osteonecrosis of the femoral head benefit from FVFG, with good overall survival of the joint [19] .",

Two groups of patients were matched as closely as possible according to gender, average age, preoperative corticosteroid dose, preoperative Steinberg stage, and preoperative Harris hip score (HHS), which may be important variables for the prognosis of ONFH. Harris hip score and radiographic changes were used to assess the outcomes in the patients of two groups. The results showed obvious increase in HHS in both groups and there was no significant difference between them. In addition, most of the radiographic results were improved in both groups. Therefore, we believed that postoperative maintenance doses of corticosteroids did not have an adverse effect on the outcomes of FVFG for treatment of corticosteroid-induced ONFH. There is no need to stop corticosteroids treatment to aid the healing of ONFH after the surgery.",

Studies found that corticosteroids adversely impact the femoral head in a dosedependent manner [20] [21] [22] . Maintenance doses of corticosteroids may minimally affect the recovery of ONFH. Second, FVFG has an excellent ability to promote new bone regeneration and revascularization to an extent that exceeds the harmful effects of low-dose corticosteroids. However, we are aware of our study's limitations. First, the current study has only 39 patients, and rigorous conclusions are difficult. Second, the length of follow-up is about 5 years. Therefore, longer-term research with larger numbers of patients will be performed to further confirm the conclusion in the future.",
