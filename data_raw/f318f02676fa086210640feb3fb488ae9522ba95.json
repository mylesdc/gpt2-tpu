The nsps assemble into the viral replication-transcription complex and nsp3, nsp4 and nsp6 are believed to anchor this enzyme complex to modified intracellular membranes. The largest part of the coronavirus nsp4 subunit is hydrophobic and is predicted to be embedded in the membranes.

A prototypical crystal structure at 2.8 \u00c5 resolution was obtained using nsp4 from feline coronavirus. Unmodified and SeMet-substituted proteins were crystallized under similar conditions, resulting in tetragonal crystals that belonged to space group P4 3 . The phase problem was initially solved by single isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering (SIRAS), followed by molecular replacement using a SIRAS-derived composite model. The structure consists of a single domain with a predominantly -helical content displaying a unique fold that could be engaged in proteinprotein interactions.",

Coronaviruses are positive-stranded RNA viruses that are frequently associated with enteric or respiratory diseases in humans, livestock and companion animals (Dye & Siddell, 2005) . At present, they are formally classified into three genetic groups (1-3), with the first two groups further divided into two subgroups (1a/b and 2a/b; Gorbalenya et al., 2004; Lai & Holmes, 2001) , but as our understanding of natural coronavirus diversity progresses novel subgroups continue to be recognized (Woo et al., 2009) . Viruses that belong to different subgroups have diverged profoundly. A fraction of their proteins are subgroup-specific and the amino-acid sequences of their most conserved proteins may differ by as much as 50%. The best-known member of this family, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), belongs to subgroup 2b, whereas feline coronavirus (FCoV), characterized in this study, belongs to subgroup 1a .",

Since the variations are minor and despite the fact that we are working with a construct derived from an FIPV strain, we will henceforth use FCoV as an abbreviation for the virus. The FCoV genome (strain FIPV WSU-79/1146) consists of 29 125 nucleotides and contains six open reading frames (ORFs; Dye & Siddell, 2005) . The first two ORFs, namely ORF1a and ORF1b, comprising the 5 0 -most gene (i.e. gene 1), encode two large replicase polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab. Proteolytic cleavage of these polyproteins by virusencoded proteinases, i.e. the 3C-like main proteinase (M pro in nsp5) and the papain-like accessory proteinases (PL pro 1 and 2 in nsp3), are predicted to give rise to a total of 16 mature nonstructural proteins (nsps; Ziebuhr et al., 2000; Dye & Siddell, 2005) . In addition to the proteases mentioned above, associated enzymatic activities have been identified for several coronavirus nsps, including deubiquitinating and adenosine diphosphate-ribose-1 0 -phosphatase (ADRP) functions (nsp3), RNA-dependent RNA polymerases with low (nsp8) and high (nsp12) processivity, helicase (nsp13), RNA exonuclease and N7-methyltransferase (nsp14), RNA endoribonuclease (nsp15) and 2 0 -O-methyltransferase (nsp16) (Anand et al., 2003; Bhardwaj et al., 2004; Chen et al., 2009; Cheng et al., 2005; Gorbalenya et al., 1989; Harcourt et al., 2004; Imbert et al., 2008; Ivanov, Hertzig et al., 2004; Ratia et al., 2006; Seybert et al., 2000; Snijder et al., 2003) . Tertiary structures, solved using X-ray or/and NMR analyses, have been reported for a substantial number of nsps from at least one coronavirus, typically SARS-CoV (reviewed in Bartlam et al., 2005; Mesters et al., 2006) . These structures represent a variety of separate domains, entire proteins and even multiprotein complexes. Despite these remarkable advances, many domains, including those residing in nsp4, remain poorly characterized.",

It is predicted to be one of the three membranespanning proteins (the others are nsp3 and nsp6) among coronavirus nsps and bioinformatic analyses consistently predict four transmembrane domains in nsp4 (Clementz et al., 2008; Oostra et al., 2007) . An N-terminal transmembrane region (amino acids 1-30) is presumably followed by a large lumenal domain (amino acids 30-280), three closely spaced additional transmembrane regions (amino acids 280-400) and finally a C-terminal domain of about 100 residues that is exposed at the cytoplasmic face of the membrane. Coronavirus infection induces the extensive reorganization of endoplasmic reticulum membranes into a reticulovesicular network (Knoops et al., 2008) that includes many unusual doublemembrane vesicles (Gosert et al., 2002; Harcourt et al., 2004; Shi et al., 1999; Snijder et al., 2006; Stertz et al., 2007) . It is currently believed that nsp4 functions in anchoring the viral replication-transcription complex (RTC) to these modified membranes and independent genetic studies have demon-strated its importance for replication (Clementz et al., 2008; Sparks et al., 2007) .",

The protein was also expressed with the substitution of methionine by selenomethionine (SeMet). The incorporation of SeMet was verified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry. Both native and SeMet-substituted proteins were crystallized from conditions containing ammonium sulfate and PEG 5000.

It is conceivable that in vivo nsp4 dimerization during membrane modification or formation of the RTC may help in bringing the components together and could therefore aid their correct spatial orientation. This would agree with the previously proposed role of nsp4 as an anchor for the assembly of the viral RTC. Fig. 2 shows the sequence alignment, produced with ClustalW2 (Larkin et al., 2007) , of the C-terminal domain of nsp4 for the five coronaviral subgroups. These viruses are FCoV (group 1a), human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63; group 1b), murine hepatitis virus (MHV; group 2a), SARS-CoV (group 2b) and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV; group 3). The nsp4ct sequence identity between viruses belonging to the same group (but different subgroups) is higher than that for viruses belonging to different groups.

The second comprises residues 45-53 that belong to helix 3 and part of loop L 3-4 . Interestingly, the five independent chains of the FCoV nsp4ct structure differ most profoundly in this region, suggesting that it is highly flexible. In the cases of molecules B and E it was disordered and there was no electron density visible for residues 50-52 and 50-55, respectively. In molecules A, C and D this region could be placed into electron density and is involved in dimer formation. High sequence conservation of this cluster and its structural flexibility suggests that it may play an important role in the nsp4ct domain function. Residues 60-71 that belong to helix 4 form the third highly conserved cluster and the fourth cluster consists of the C-terminal residues 81-96. This last cluster contains the highly conserved Tyr84, Pro86 and Pro87 which form the YxPP motif, which is the inverse of the consensus PPxY sequence recognized by the class I WW domains (Linn et al., 1997) . Di Leva et al. (2006) showed that the class I WW domain does not require a peptide with a consensus sequence and can also bind an inverted peptide sequence. The only condition is the presence of the polyproline II (PPII) conformation, which is observed in the case of FCoV nsp4ct. This suggests that region 84-87 is a reasonable candidate for protein-protein interactions. PROSITE (http://www.expasy.org/prosite/) analysis of all FCoV nsps did not identify any possible WW domains, suggesting that the YxPP motif interacting partner is a host protein.",

In this context, it is a surprising finding that deletion of the nsp4ct of MHV (using a reverse genetics system) was reported to be tolerated by the virus (Clementz et al., 2008; Sparks et al., 2007) , with the resulting mutant displaying a modestly attenuated phenotype. Thus, although a similar mutant has not been generated for FCoV or any other coronavirus, the conservation of the nsp4ct domain outlined above would suggest that it is not absolutely required for coronavirus RNA synthesis and/or RTC formation per se. This opens the possibility that, like some other recently characterized coronavirus enzyme functions (Eriksson et al., 2008; Roth-Cross et al., 2009) , the nsp4ct domain might play a role in specific virus-host interactions of the type that are not easily uncovered in cell culture-based systems for virus propagation. Further functional studies are required in order to better understand the detailed role of nsp4 and to identify its partners and therefore its significance in the viral life cycle.",
