While vaccination is broadly used in an effort to prevent BRD, it is far from being fully protective and cases diagnosed from a combination of observed clinical signs without any attempt at identifying the causal pathogens are usually treated with antibiotics. Dairy and beef cattle losses from BRD are profound worldwide and genetic studies have now been initiated to elucidate host loci which underlie susceptibility with the objective of enabling molecular breeding to reduce disease prevalence. In this study, we employed RNA sequencing to examine the bronchial lymph node transcriptomes of controls and beef cattle which had individually been experimentally challenged with bovine respiratory syncytial virus, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis, bovine viral diarrhea virus, Pasteurella multocida, Mannheimia haemolytica or Mycoplasma bovis to identify the genes that are involved in the bovine immune response to infection. We found that 142 differentially expressed genes were located in previously described quantitative trait locus regions associated with risk of BRD. Mutations affecting the expression or amino acid composition of these genes may affect disease susceptibility and could be incorporated into molecular breeding programs.",

The precise cost of BRD to the industry is not well understood [2] , but losses of at least $1 billion annually have been estimated considering costs of prevention, treatment, loss of productivity and labor [3] . Despite BRD being one of the most common and expensive diseases of feedlot cattle, annual morbidity and mortality rates have increased despite the extensive use of vaccines and antimicrobials [4] . BRD is caused by a number of bacterial and viral pathogens which are collectively referred to as the bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC). This complex includes bovine herpes virus type 1 also known as infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR), bovine parainfluenza type 3 virus (PI3), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), and bacterial pathogens Arcanobacterium pyogenes, Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Histophilus somni and Mycoplasma bovis [5] . However, the onset of disease is usually associated with environmental stressors, a susceptible host and the presence of both viral and bacterial pathogens [4] .",

            "text": "Stress resulting from management procedures can predispose calves to an initial infection by a viral pathogen which may suppress the animals' defense mechanisms, facilitating a secondary infection due to the colonization of the lower respiratory tract by bacteria [6] . While respiratory viruses are capable of causing a clinical disease that is consistent with BRD in the absence of a bacterial co-infection [7] , viral infection is usually considered to be the precursor to a secondary bacterial infection which leads to the disease syndrome of BRDC [6, 8] . Although the importance of many environmental and management stress factors, such as weaning and transportation are well understood, as is the fact that susceptibility to BRD is lowly to moderately heritable [9] , the genetic dissection of the specific loci underlying susceptibility has yet to be tackled. Two approaches are commonly used either individually, or in conjunction, for the dissection of loci underlying phenotypic variation. Genome-wide association analysis is used to identify regions of the genome which harbor variants that have large effects on phenotypic variation and gene expression studies are used to identify transcripts which differ in abundance between individuals which differ in phenotype. When these data are integrated, differentially expressed (DE) genes which reside in genomic regions that have been shown to be trait-associated suggests a direct role for these genes in regulating trait variation [10] [11] [12] .",

These variants may be directly selected in livestock populations to reduce the prevalence of multi-agent diseases such as BRDC. The aim of this research was to compare, relative to controls, the bronchial lymph node transcript levels of steers produced from Angus bulls mated to advanced generation Hereford-Angus crossbred cows that were experimentally challenged with IBR, BVDV, BRSV, M. haemolytica, P. multocida or M. bovis. Bronchial lymph nodes were chosen for analysis because the immune response to pathogens in the lung is important to the host response and these nodes contain lymphocytes that come from the lung. Moreover, these nodes are where antigen presentation occurs and where the T and B cells are stimulated. Consequently, bronchial lymph nodes provide the best window into lymphocyte responses within the infected lung compartment.",

Blood was collected and steers seronegative, or with the lowest titers against each bacterial and viral pathogen, were selected. The six to eight month old steers were transported to the University of California Davis where they were maintained in pens, fed a 65% concentrate starter diet and were provided water ad libitum. The challenge studies were performed sequentially starting with the control animals and with animals housed in groups by control or challenge pathogen.

In addition, two control animals were aerosol administered with 8.5 ml of tissue culture media via a nebulizer and two additional control animals were inoculated by intratracheal instillation with 8.5 ml of phosphate buffered saline. The volume of phosphate buffered saline given by intratracheal inoculation was followed by two volumes of air to make sure that no saline was left in the tube; whereas, the tissue culture media was given by aerosol to mimic one mechanism of viral exposure. One animal challenged with M. bovis was euthanized early due to extreme disease and tissues were not collected, leaving 27 animals with bronchial lymph node tissues available for analysis from the optimized study. Strains were obtained as follows: BRSV-Dr. Laurel Clinical scores were recorded daily from 3 days before challenge until euthanasia using a scoring system based on a combination of systems described elsewhere [13] [14] [15] . None of the animals were considered to require treatment with analgesics or anesthetics and these were not provided. Steers were necropsied when clinical signs were determined to have peaked but with the exception of the animal challenged with M. bovis that was euthanized early, these were not considered to be humane end-points. Animals were euthanized on days 7, 15, 6, 5, 15 and 6 post-challenge, when clinical signs had peaked for BRSV, BVDV, IBR, M. haemolytica, M. bovis and P. multocida, respectively. After the steers were euthanized, lungs and other viscera were removed for examination by a certified veterinary pathologist.

Because these RNA-seq data were from a relatively wellannotated organism, and the number of potential novel isoforms appeared to be very large (68.33% of the identified transcripts; Table 1 ), we chose to not use the merged assembly file in the downstream Cuffdiff analysis to avoid the potential for bias caused by assembly errors [21] . The large number of potentially new isoforms was expected because most human multi-exon genes are known to undergo alternative splicing [22] . We manually evaluated 100 potentially new isoforms by randomly sampling transcripts within different size ranges and searching the NCBI 'nr' database for these sequences with BLAST and observed that 76% were new isoforms, 8% were likely assembly artifacts, 10% represented incompletely assembled reference genes (i.e., missing exons or possessing larger 3' or 5' end sequences) and 6% had retained introns.",

First, the variation between biological replicates was assessed using an MDS plot based on all expressed genes, which revealed a strong clustering of samples from control, bacterially and virally challenged animals with little variation between replicates (Fig 1) . The first dimension clearly separated the virus-from the bacteria-challenged and control animals, while the second dimension separated controls from bacteria-and virus-challenged animals and suggests an ordering of pathogenicity. This postulate was also supported by the Jensen-Shannon divergence statistics between the challenged groups estimated from FPKM values for all genes (Fig 2) and by the principal component analysis (PC1 vs PC2; Fig 3) , which show that the perturbation of gene expression was greatest for the animals challenged with viruses. The dynamic range of FPKM values was also evaluated by creating a boxplot of log 10 transformed FPKM values for each biological replicate (Fig 4) . The median FPKM values across the challenge groups were similar and the ranges indicate that our depth of sequence coverage was sufficient to allow the identification of genes with low transcript abundance.",

The DE genes and pathways that were found to be common to all pathogen challenges were up-regulated in the challenged animals and appear to primarily be related to the innate immune response, which enables a rapid antimicrobial host defense prior to the development of the adaptive immune response. This was consistent with the sampling of steers for the challenge experiment which had either no, or low, blood titers against the challenge pathogens. However, the innate immune system may also be involved in determining which antigens the acquired immune system responds to and the manner of that response [27] . We identified several pathways which underlie the immune response mechanisms that are induced following infection. The innate immune system, which responds to all pathogens, recognizes pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by host pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs). The list of PRRs which are known to sense PAMPs is extensive, and includes members of at least four gene families: Toll-like receptors (TLRs), nucleotide oligomerization domain like receptors, C-type lectin receptors and retinoic acid-inducible gene I like receptors. PRR ligation stimulates several signaling pathways that result in the activation of nuclear factor-\u03baB, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and interferon regulatory factors, which mediate the production of cytokines and type I interferons needed for an effective innate response [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] . The pro-inflammatory state that results from these mechanisms is necessary for the generation of a robust antimicrobial environment and for the appropriate stimulation of the adaptive immune response [32] .",

For example, we found the toll-like receptor pathway and MAPK signaling which are responsible for the phosphorylation and activation of kinases which regulate cytokine production [33] , TGF-beta signaling, which functions in cytokine regulation [34] and natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity whereby populations of lymphocytes are activated to cytotoxicity via the production of cytokines and chemokines [35] . The cytokine and chemokine-related pathways were all up-regulated in the challenged animals. Cytokines and chemokines have important functions in the innate and adaptive immune systems. The production of cytokines by innate immune cells occurs as an acute response to inflammation and infection across diverse etiologies. The release of cytokines and chemokines orchestrates immune responses through communication with other cells. For the immune response to efficiently function, the synthesis and release of cytokines must be controlled [36] and the pathways enriched for DE genes detected in our analyses of these data are involved in this process. It is important to note that cytokines underlying the control of viral immunity differ from those that are most relevant to anti-bacterial defense. For example, an effective immune response to BRSV, IBR and BVDV requires the development of cytotoxic T cells, which are critical for the elimination of virus infected cells. Production of interleukin 12 and interferon gamma by T helper type 1 cells facilitates the priming of CD8 cytotoxic T cells. Whereas, in humoral immunity, antibody production is associated with interleukin 4 expression and interleukin 17 stimulates a neutrophil response in the defense against many bacterial pathogens [37] .",

In response to the M. haemolytica challenge, TLR1 and TLR6 are induced while for IBR, TLR2 and TLR4 are induced. TLR2 and TLR4 proteins are present on the surface of immune cells and are known to be involved in the recognition of several viruses via the detection of envelope glycoproteins [38] .

While B cells are critical for the humoral immune response, T helper cells are important for initiation of the humoral response to T dependent antigens. T lymphocytes are also involved in cell-mediated immune responses, both as T helper type 1 cells and as cytotoxic T cells. B cell-related pathways were not detected in response to challenge by any of the bacterial agents which is puzzling because the development of an antibody response usually occurs for infections by each of the bacterial pathogens. Presumably these were induced early in the response to challenge and had abated by the time the animals were euthanized. However, the IPA results revealed that pathways related to B cell receptors were among the most important in the animals' responses to virus challenge.",

There are many shared genes between these 3 pathways that relate to neurological disease. For example, all three include the activation of COX5A and COX5B which are cytochrome C oxidase subunit enzymes in the mitochondrial respiratory chain and defects in mitochondrial function are associated with all three diseases. However, activation of these genes by BRSV and IBR is not likely to be associated with neurological disease in infected cattle. Rather, our findings suggest that neurologic interference may be a common manifestation of infection by pathogenic viruses. A recent study found that neurodegenerative disease-related pathways were induced in HIV-infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells [43] . Potential upstream regulators of these pathways and their target molecules were identified in our analyses (S3, S5, S7, S9, S12 and S13 Tables) and this information may be useful for the development of novel therapeutics.

The LPS activated immune response to bacterial infection results in the production of NKT cells and IFN\u03b3 [47] .
