The Wisconsin Infant Study Cohort (WISC) study was established in central Wisconsin to test the hypothesis that early life animal farm exposures are associated with distinct innate immune cell maturation trajectories, decreased allergen sensitization and reduced respiratory viral illness burden during the first 2 years of life. Beginning in 2013, a total of 240 families have been enrolled, 16,522 biospecimens have been collected, and 4098 questionnaires have been administered and entered into a secure database. Study endpoints include nasal respiratory virus identification and respiratory illness burden score, allergic sensitization, expression of allergic disease, and antiviral immune response maturation and profiles. The WISC study prospective design, broad biospecimen collections, and unique US rural community will provide insights into the role of environmental exposures on early life immune maturation profiles associated with protection from allergic sensitization and significant respiratory viral disease burden. The WISC study findings will ultimately inform development of new strategies to promote resistance to severe respiratory viral illnesses and design primary prevention approaches for allergic diseases for all infants.",

Respiratory infections are particularly high for infants who show early evidence of atopic diseases (e.g. atopic dermatitis) [1] [2] [3] . Epidemiologic and cross-sectional studies suggest that early life farming and animal exposures are associated with major health benefits, influencing immune development and modifying the subsequent risk of allergic diseases, including asthma [4] . Farming effects associated with decreased allergic disease include exposure to unprocessed milk (referred to as farm milk), farm animal waste and housing, and potentially bioactive substances in the farm environment [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . In accordance with previously published studies in Western Europe, our study from central Wisconsin using interview and electronic health records (EHR) demonstrated that children raised in farming environments have a significant decrease in allergic diseases during the first 2 years of life [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . In addition, children who live on farms in Western Europe or Wisconsin Open Access BMC Research Notes *Correspondence: cmseroogy@wisc.edu 5 Division of Allergy, Immunology & Rheumatology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, 1111 Highland Avenue, 4139 WIMR, Madison, WI 53705-2275, USA Full list of author information is available at the end of the article also have a marked reduction in medically-attended respiratory illnesses during the first 2 years of life compared to rural children who do not live on a farm [12, 16] . These collective findings suggest that farm-related exposures promote healthy immune system development in early life and that may lead to reduced burden of respiratory illnesses and allergic diseases. Identification and (prospective) characterization of a cohort of children that are highly protected from developing allergy disease would provide further insights and rationale in naturally-occurring environmental exposures that influence the foundational steps to prevent immune-mediated conditions. This report details the study design, recruitment strategies, biospecimens, and unique characteristics of the Wisconsin Infant Study Cohort (WISC). Expanding upon published epidemiologic findings from our group and others, the WISC study is designed to test the hypothesis that early life animal farm exposures are associated with reduced respiratory viral illness burden, distinct innate immune cell maturation trajectories, and decreased allergen sensitization during the first 2 years of life. Findings from the WISC study will better define the environmental impact of farming-related exposures on respiratory viral illnesses, immune maturation, and allergic sensitization.",

MCHS is a large, integrated care system serving a predominantly rural part of Wisconsin. There are approximately 3500 births per year within MCHS, which serves a region with one of the highest density of farm households (primarily dairy production) in the U.S [17] .

Participants were enrolled as a dyad, as consent was signed before birth by the mother and on behalf of the child after birth. Farm mothers were defined as those who live on, or within 1/8th mile of a farm, or who work on, or have a household member who works on a farm. Farm mothers also have regular exposure to (i.e., direct personal [or household member] contact \u2265 4 days per week) with cattle (cows, calves, bulls, steers), pigs or goats. Non-farm mothers do not live on (or within 1/8th mile of ) a farm, nor work on, or have a household member who works on, a farm. Non-farm mothers also do not visit a farm weekly or more, nor have any farm livestock animals as pets (e.g., cows, goats, pigs, horses, chickens).

In 2015, 24 additional ZIP codes in the Marshfield Epidemiologic Study Area (MESA), which encompasses 10 rural medical centers throughout north-central Wisconsin, were added to increase enrollment [18, 19] . Potentially eligible patients were first mailed an informational postcard on the study, followed by an informational letter and brochure, plus an interest response card. Once eligibility information could be verified in the EHR, an invitation letter was sent (signed by their obstetrics healthcare provider), plus up to six phone call attempts. When reached for the initial phone contact, farm or non-farm categorization and exclusion factors were again verified. If all eligibility criteria were met, a face-to-face invitation and enrollment visit was arranged, typically during scheduled prenatal visits. After informed consent forms were signed during the enrollment visit, a questionnaire to gather information about health history, environmental exposures, and lifestyle was completed.",

Nasal swabs collected at routine surveillance timepoints and during illness episodes are assayed for all common respiratory viruses (e.g. rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus, influenza, parainfluenza, metapneumovirus, bocavirus, enterovirus and adenovirus) by multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at the UW study site [20] . Rhinovirus isolates are partially sequenced to identify strains and to differentiate lengthy single infections from serial infections with different rhinovirus strains. During illnesses, parents are asked to record daily information consisting of scored illness signs/symptoms and temperature measurements (if fever present) in calendar-formatted paper diaries. Illness signs/symptoms are recorded on a 4-point scale (none, mild, moderate, severe) similar to previously published studies [21] [22] [23] . Parents or legal guardians record the data every day until symptoms resolve. The respiratory illness burden index is calculated as area under the curve (AUC) for symptom scores and days of illness.

During the ~ 5-year timeframe from April 2013 through May 2018, the total number of pregnancies electronically screened was 19,450. The majority of these women (67%) resided outside the study's geographic catchment area. Another 18% of those screened were too far along in their pregnancy to begin recruitment, 1% had exclusionary medical conditions, and 8% could not be reached for study contact. The remaining 6% made up the study recruitment pool, consisting of 932 potential non-farm and 429 potential farm women. After initial contact, 612 non-farm and 309 farm women were found to be eligible for WISC. Reasons for ineligibility at this stage mostly included additional medical issues, and ambiguity in establishing farm vs. non-farm status. Of the eligible non-farm women, 145 (24%) consented to WISC, and of eligible farm women, 128 (41%) consented. The enrollment rate was significantly higher for farm vs. non-farm mothers ( X 2 (DF=1) = 30.95, p < 0.001). After birth, 8% of non-farm and 9% of farm children were found to be ineligible due to medical complications from the pregnancy. To date, 115 non-farm families and 94 farm families are enrolled in the study. Of these, 12% have withdrawn, and 4% are still awaiting delivery. The median follow-up time for enrolled children is 27 months. Additional families will be enrolled to replace those withdrawn from the study. Sociodemographic characteristics of the farm and non-farm groups were similar, except that there were significantly more male children born in the farm group (p = 0.03, Table 4 ). Most enrollees lived in counties near the main study site in Marshfield. The vast majority of enrolled mothers gave birth between the age of 25-34 years, and nearly two-thirds had a college education. Home environment and personal health characteristics are described in Table 5 . Compared to non-farm mothers, a significantly greater proportion of farm mothers owned a dog (p < 0.001) or cat (p < 0.001), and regularly drank farm milk (i.e., unprocessed milk obtained directly from a farm) during their pregnancy (p < 0.001), A significantly greater proportion of farm children (at age 2 months) spent at least 1 day per week at another home (p = 0.02), and non-farm mothers were more likely to work outside the home (p = 0.005). Study covariates that were not significantly different between the groups include mode of delivery, maternal history of varied allergic diseases, maternal smoking, and exclusive breastfeeding during the first 2 months of life.",

A subset of the farm pregnant woman (16%) worked on the farm but did not live there. For the pregnant women that live on a farm, 31% also report working on the farm. The WISC farm group mostly live on dairy farms (77%), and 50% are small dairy farms (\u2264 100 cows per farm, Table 6 and Additional file 1: Figure S4 ). Half of the farms have more than one type of farm animal and the vast majority of WISC farms also grow crops. During pregnancy, most of the farm women had regular direct contact with cattle, hay, straw, feed grain, and silage. The majority of both 2 and 9 month old farm group infants spent time in the animal barns on a daily or weekly basis.",

A potential limitation of our study is the lack of air quality monitoring, particularly since ambient air pollution exposure in early life has been associated with the inception of allergic diseases and respiratory health [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] .
