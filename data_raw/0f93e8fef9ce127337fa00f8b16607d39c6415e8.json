            "text": "Chicken gout resulting from nephropathogenic infectious bronchitis virus (NIBV) has become a serious kidney disease problem in chicken worldwide with alterations of the metabolic phenotypes in multiple metabolic pathways. To investigate the mechanisms in chicken responding to NIBV infection, we examined the global transcriptomic and metabolomic profiles of the chicken's kidney using RNA-seq and GC-TOF/MS, respectively. Furthermore, we analyzed the alterations in cecal microorganism composition in chickens using 16S rRNA-seq. Integrated analysis of these three phenotypic datasets further managed to create correlations between the altered kidney transcriptomes and metabolome, and between kidney metabolome and gut microbiome. We found that 2868 genes and 160 metabolites were deferentially expressed or accumulated in the kidney during NIBV infection processes. These genes and metabolites were linked to NIBV-infection related processes, including immune response, signal transduction, peroxisome, purine, and amino acid metabolism. In addition, the comprehensive correlations between the kidney metabolome and cecal microbial community showed contributions of gut microbiota in the progression of NIBV-infection. Taken together, our research comprehensively describes the host responses during NIBV infection and provides new clues for further dissection of specific gene functions, metabolite affections, and the role of gut microbiota during chicken gout. astrovirus (CAstV), and NIBV [4, 6, 7] . Currently, NIBV that causes visceral gout in chicken has become a research hotspot [6, 8] .",

It is a gamma Coronavirus in the Coronavirus family that exhibit strong renal tropism and has become one of the most familiar pathogens that induce visceral gout outbreaks [9] [10] [11] . Initially, some IBV strains have been called nephropathogenic IBV because the starting respiratory infection was followed by a heavy kidney infection. A large number of previous research findings indicate that clinical symptoms of nephropathogenic IBV strains infection include increased water consumption, depression, watery droppings, and significant mortality. Notably, necropsy of chicks that died during nephropathogenic IBV infection showed enlarged and pale kidneys and monosodium urate crystal deposition in the renal tubules and ureters [12] . According to histopathology, NIBV replicates on the epithelial surface of the kidney and causes particle degeneration, vacuolation, and desquamation of the tubular epithelium, as well as massive infiltration of heterophilic granulocytes in the stroma [13] . However, there is a substantial lack of understanding of the pathogenesis of NIBV infection. In addition, it is well known that the gut microbial community is closely associated with the progression of diseases, and Inoue et al. also confirmed that hepatitis C virus infection is associated with gut dysbiosis [14] . In our study, we focus on the cecum as organs of particular interest as they harbor the highest microbial cell densities (up to 10 11 cells g \u22121 ) and are significant sites for recycling of urea, water regulation, and carbohydrate fermentations [15, 16] . Therefore, we suspect that the gut microbiota may be associated with the progression of visceral gout induced by NIBV infection.",

Moreover, the research of the gut microbiota (microbiomics) has brought increasing concern due to its important affection for different diseases [19] . Many scholars have used multi-omics analysis to make great progress in deciphering the pathogenesis of diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease [20] , familial type 1 diabetes [21], autoimmune diseases [22] , and cardiovascular diseases [23] .

It is worth noting that in addition to its occurrence in humans, gout is one of the common diseases that plague poultry and causes huge economic losses to the poultry industry worldwide [3] . Avian gout is commonly divided into visceral gout and joint gout, and the typical clinical pathology of visceral gout is hyperuricemia. According to reports, various aviaries from all over the world have visceral gout, which has become one of the most commonly diagnosed causes of fatality in poultry [4, 5] . In the poultry industry, visceral gout can be caused by many factors, including vitamin A deficiency, high dietary calcium, renal insufficiency, chicken diseased room (Dis, n = 120). Birds in each experimental room were randomly divided into three subgroups (30 birds for each subgroup), with ad libitum access to food and water. Each chicken of Dis groups was intranasally injected with 0.2 mL 10 5 median embryo lethal doses of strain SX9 at 28 days of age [24] , while the Con group intranasally received 0.2 mL of sterile physiological saline. At 38 days of age, four chicken randomly chosen per subgroups were euthanized by carbon dioxide inhalation, then dislocated their cervical vertebra. The samples in a group were pooled and dead birds were not used for analysis. Ten serum samples were randomly collected from surviving chickens in the Con and Dis groups before euthanasia that were used for uric acid test. Six biological replicates of kidney samples were extracted from each group making a total of 12 samples that were used for GC-TOF/MS analysis. Four biological replicates of kidney samples were collected from each group giving a total of eight samples that were used for RNA-seq analysis. Six biological replicates of cecal contents from each group were collected giving a total of 12 samples that were used for 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis ( Figure 1a shows the experimental design).",

Among them, heparin binding, oxidoreductase activity, external side of plasma membrane, extracellular space, membrane, integral component of membrane, oxidation-reduction process, and immune response were the significantly enriched GO terms (p adj < 0.05) in chickens with NIBV infection. To further study the biochemical metabolic pathway and signal transduction pathways related to NIBV infection, KEGG analysis and pathway enrichment analysis were conducted in the KEGG pathway database. There were 901 of the 2868 DEGs that were annotated to 177 pathways in KEGG analysis. The level-2 KEGG classes are shown in Figure 3d , and the 11 significant enriched pathways (Corrected p-value < 0.05 as determined by a Fisher's exact test) are marked with red number. In environmental information processing pathways which include cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) were dramatically regulated. In cellular processes pathway, peroxisome was dramatically affected. In metabolism pathways, metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450, drug metabolism-cytochrome P450, pyruvate metabolism, arginine and proline metabolism, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, and fatty acid degradation were significantly regulated. In organismal systems pathways, intestinal immune network for IgA production and Toll-like receptor signaling pathway were significantly regulated. Furthermore, most of these pathways of the upregulated genes enriched were immune system-related pathways, and \"cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction\" was the most represented pathway. Among these pathways we found upregulated, \"Toll-like receptor signalling pathway\", \"NOD-like receptor signalling pathway\" and \"RIG-I-like receptor signalling pathway\" are pattern recognition signal receptor pathways involved in innate immunity. Simultaneously, the transcriptome showed that the \"peroxisome\" and amino acid metabolite pathways were suppressed in chickens infected with NIBV. Based on the above results, we predicted a schematic diagram of important pathways for chickens in the NIBV infection processes (Figure 3e) . signalling is activated by monosodium urate (MSU) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). The activation of TLRs and the ROS accumulation activates the NLRP3 inflammasome, resulting in proteolytic cleavage of caspase-1 and the maturation of IL-18 and IL-1\u03b2, and MSU has been identified to activate inflammasome complex.",

In the Toll-like receptor signalling pathway (Figure 3f, Signal 1) , a series of upregulated genes were noticed, including TLR4, TLR7, MyD88, IRF5, TRAF3, and IRF7. It was already reported that TLR7 primarily recognizes single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) sequences of RNA viruses that enter endosomes by endocytosis [38] [39] [40] . NIBV used in this experiment is a single-stranded positive sense RNA virus. Thus, the expansion of TLR7 is pivotal for the recognition of NIBV and variable functions of the Toll-like receptor signalling pathway. Moreover, a number of viral glycoproteins have been shown to act as viral PAMPs (Pathogen-associated molecular pattern) that bind to and activate TLR4, leading to IFN-\u03b2 and/or proinflammatory cytokine expression (such as SARS coronavirus) [41] . Ru Liu-Bryan's study has established that host expression of TLR2, TLR4, and their intracellular adapter protein MyD88 is a major mediator of MSU crystal-induced inflammation [42] . This explains the reason for the increase in Tlr4 transcription levels in this experiment. In addition, the transcriptomic analysis showed that NIBV infection also activated the RIG-I-like receptor signalling pathway (Figure 3f , signal 2), which included the transcriptional upregulation of genes such as MDA5, IPS-1, TRAF3, and I\u03baB. This induction may be due to MDA5 acting as a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) sensor to trigger an innate immune response against viral infection [43] [44] [45] , while coronaviruses can produce dsRNA intermediates during replication [46] . RLRs can not only be expressed in cells infected with various viruses but also directly recognize and perceive virus products and virus particles present in the cytosol outside of the endosomes [47] . Therefore, we suspect that the RIG-I-like receptor signalling pathway has a greater role than Toll-like receptor signalling in recognizing NIBV infection. The activation of the Toll-like receptor signalling and RIG-I-like receptor signalling pathways results in the production of chemokines and other cytokines that induce a proinflammatory response and tissue destruction. In our study, several features that are familiar to chickens infected with NIBV are consistent with the immunopathological disease. These features include the pathological damage of kidney and the presence of increased transcription of chemokines and other cytokines, such as IL-8 (interleukin 8), IL-18 (interleukin 18), and TGF-\u03b2 (transforming growth factor \u03b2).",

            "text": "Peroxisomes act to eliminate a microbial infection by modulating the canonical innate immunity pathways through ROS signalling [48] . Several enzymes with antioxidant activity in the peroxisome are involved in neutralizing ROS to protect the cells from ROS damage. Among these enzymes, catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), peroxiredoxin 5 (PRDX5), glutathione S-transferase kappa 1 (GSTK1), dehydrogenase/reductase member 4 (DHRS4), and epoxide hydrolase 2 (EPHX2) are included [49, 50] . Multiple viruses have been shown to use different mechanisms to reduce peroxisome numbers or interfere with their functions. In our study, the \"peroxisome\" was the most important pathway according to the downregulated gene enrichment analysis, which includes CAT, SOD1, DHRS4, and EPHX2 that belong to the peroxisome antioxidant defence system, while the catalase activity was decreased both in kidney and serum ( Figure S3 ). Thus, decreased abundance and/or impaired function of the peroxisome could potentially cause endogenous elevation of ROS. ROS may either straightly trigger NLRP3 inflammasome assemblage or be indirectly sensed through cytoplasmic proteins that modulate inflammasome activity (Figure 3f, signal 3) . The NLRP3 inflammasome senses pathogens or danger signals to promote the maturation of cytokines such as IL-18 [51] . The release of active IL-18 engages IL-18 receptor-harbouring cells and promotes inflammatory responses [52] . In addition, uric acid has been reported as another well-established activator of NLRP3 that is usually generated via xanthine oxidase (XOD), accompanying the generation of O 2",

In addition to being caused by insufficient urate excretion, hyperuricemia can also be caused by excessive production of uric acid [59] . We found a high level of glutamine, which enter the purine metabolic pathway as a raw material for uric acid synthesis. The high level of glutamine can be explained by two reasons. First, the lack of mRNA abundance of the gene GSS in the kidney tissue of the model group inhibited the conversion of glutamine to glutathione. A significant negative correlation between GSS and glutamine has confirmed this finding. Second, the transcription level of the gene glutamic pyruvate transaminase 2 (GPT2) in the model group chickens' kidneys increased significantly. GPT2 is a pyridoxal enzyme that promotes the conversion of \u03b1-ketoglutarate to glutamate [60] . Of note, \u03b1-ketoglutarate is an intermediate in the TCA cycle, and glutamate can be reversibly converted to glutamine by glutamine synthetase. Together, these data point to key genes and metabolites related to elevated uric acid synthesis, which provides us with new insights into host response to NIBV infection.",

It is well known that organisms fuel or instruct the immune response to pathogen threats by modulating metabolic pathways [61] . Innate and acquired immune systems are regulated by a highly interactive network of chemical communications, which include the synthesis of the antigen-presenting machinery, immunoglobulins, and cytokines. This network is highly dependent on the sufficient availability of amino acids. Thus, amino acids affect immune responses either directly or indirectly through their metabolites [62] . In our study, the correlation analysis highlighted a significant positive correlation between Tlr7 and proline, isoleucine, threonine, and valine. According to reports, isoleucine could maintain the development of immune organs and cells and stimulate the secretion of immune molecule substances in humans and animals [63, 64] , valine could improve dendritic cell function [65] , and it has been proved in vitro that threonine plays a key role in lymphocyte proliferation and immunoglobulin production [66] . We observed an increase in the level of amino acids enriched in proline, leucine, and isoleucine biosynthesis pathway, including isoleucine, valine, and threonine. Therefore, changes in these amino acid metabolism pathways may occur through the activation of innate immunity to enhance the body's antiviral response. Although there are many studies on amino acids and immunity, the modulation of amino acid metabolism in innate immune responses is still poorly known and deserves further study.",

Our results showed that the abundance of Bacteroides, Lactobacillus, and Bacteroides vulgatus were significantly reduced in the cecal microbiota of NIBV-infected chickens based on LEfSe analysis. Similar to many other Bacteroides species, especially Bacteroides vulgatus which was shown to promote intestinal homeostasis, the Bacteroides vulgatus-mediated induction of semimature dendritic cells is associated with inflammation silencing [70, 71] . Thus, decreased abundance of Bacteroides vulgatus promotes intestinal flora imbalance and activation of the immune system. Furthermore, it is well accepted that Lactobacillus may lower serum uric acid levels by reducing intestinal absorption of purines in humans [72] . Therefore, a decrease in the abundance of Lactobacillus in the caecum of the model group infected with NIBV further promoted an increase in uric acid levels in serum. The results of our correlation analysis further confirm this point, that is, the negative relationship between the abundance of Bacteroides vulgatus, Lactobacillus and the uric acid concentration. However, the mechanism of NIBV infection leading to a decrease in their abundance still needs further study. Taken together, multitudinous studies to date endorse the concept that a bloom of Proteobacteria in the gut reflects gut dysbiosis or an unstable gut microbial community [73] . In view of balanced gut microbiota with high stabilization that has symbiotic relationships with the immune system of the host, which is capable of suppressing the uncontrolled expansion of Proteobacteria, the increase in the abundance of Proteobacteria in this experiment may be closely related to the immune and metabolic changes caused by NIBV infection.",

In summary, our study comprehensively describes the host responses during NIBV infection and provides new clues for further dissection of specific gene functions, metabolite affections, and the role of gut microbiota during chicken gout.",
