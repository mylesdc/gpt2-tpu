Significant differences in concentrations were found in the median concentration of total protein ( = 0.0336), between 0 months and 1 month ( = 0.0108), 0 and 6 months ( = 0.0023), and 0 and 12 months ( = 0.0027), in mean concentration (g/dL) of albumin ( = 0.0394), between 0 months and 1 month ( = 0.0131), 0 and 6 months ( = 0.0035), and 0 and 12 months ( = 0.0038), and beta-2 fraction ( = 0.0401), between 0 and 6 months ( = 0.0401) and 0 and 12 months ( = 0.0230). This study suggests that total gamma globulin concentration in bovine frozen plasma is stable for 12 months at \u221220 \u2218 C. Total protein, ALB, and beta-2 fraction have significantly different concentrations (g/dL) when compared to prestorage. This study has shown IgG protein fraction stability in bovine fresh frozen plasma collected for transfusion; therefore, bovine fresh frozen plasma seems to be suitable for the treatment of hypogammaglobulinemia (failure of passive transfer) in calves when stored for 12 months at \u221220 \u2218 C.",

Calves are born hypogammaglobulinemic and require colostrum to supply immunoglobulins during the neonatal period. Neonatal calf health is largely dependent on the ingestion and absorption of maternally derived antibodies via colostrum consumption [5] . Failure of passive transfer (inadequate circulating IgG concentration) in calves is a common condition that predisposes calves to increased morbidity and mortality and there is a link between low serum globulins and the incidence of infectious diseases [6] . The importance of the ingestion and absorption of colostral immunoglobulins on morbidity, mortality, growth, and future productivity of dairy calves has been described [7] . Calves with inadequate passive transfer of colostral immunoglobulins have an increased risk of death during the first 3 months after birth [8] , a decreased rate of weight gain [9] , and a decreased survival rate until the end of the first lactation [10, 11] .",

The protocol for this study was approved by the Institutional Ethical Committee for Animal Care at University of Milan (http://www.unimi.it/cataloghi/comitato etico/CE 19dic2012 verbale.pdf). A closed-collection system was used, consisting of sterile human 450 mL blood bags (TERUMO CPDA-1 triple blood bag, GRIFOLS, Italy) containing 20 mL of citrate-phosphate-dextrose-adenine-1 (CPDA-1) anticoagulant, used to collect blood from each cow. From each cow 8 bags of whole blood were collected. Whole blood was collected in a standard fashion from each cow by jugular venipuncture, using a 16-gauge needle attached to a triple-bag closed-collection system on a blood mixer. The closed-collection system consisted of a primary bag containing 63 mL of citrate phosphate-double dextrose solution as anticoagulant, an additive bag that contained 100 mL of additive solution (SAG-Mannitol), and 1 empty satellite bag.",

The effect of duration and temperature of storage on canine plasma and serum constituents has been documented [16] . Most analytes show no or very mild change in canine plasma [16] and concentrations of glucose and total proteins in human samples have been shown to be unaffected by repeated freeze-thaw cycles [27] . Our results concur with results of previous studies that evaluated the effects of freezing and storage on routine assays of total protein and protein fractions in other animals [16] [17] [18] . In those studies, however, blood samples were collected by means of direct venipuncture, using a syringe and needle, and placed in glass or plastic tubes (either empty or containing lithium-heparin), conditions which do not mimic those used for obtaining and storing plasma for transfusion. In our study, when the value of protein fractions was expressed as a percentage of TP, no difference was found between fresh plasma and thawed plasma at any storage time. However, when the values were expressed in g/dL, significant differences were seen, with a number of analytes occurring at higher concentrations in frozen/thawed serum than in fresh serum, for example, mean concentration of TP between 0 months and 1 month (6,4%), 0 and 6 months (6.4%), and 0 and 12 months (3.5%); ALB concentration between 0 months and 1 month, 0 and 6 months, and 0 and 12 months (7.6%); and beta-2 concentration between 0 and 6 months and 0 and 12 months (7.5% and 13.2%, resp.). Reynolds et al. [17] reported similar results in a study examining effects on canine plasma protein after repeated freeze-thaw cycles. In our study the change in the mean values exceeded \"accepted value of within subject biological variation\" and \"total error allowed for people\" [28] , and in the case of beta globulin the percentage of variation exceeded 10%. In accordance with the interpretation of Cray et al. [18] we accepted that differences greater than 10% of the minimal difference are likely to have clinical significance in the interpretation of the biochemical analysis.",

In this study the maximal percentage of variation observed between fresh and frozen plasma was not considered clinically relevant and would not be expected to lead to misinterpretation of the results [17] . Thus, this study demonstrates that in bovine plasma stored at \u221220 \u2218 C changes in protein fractions occur in TP, ALB, and beta-2 globulin expressed as g/dL after 1 month and 6 and 12 months. Since one of the main reasons for use of bovine frozen plasma is the passive transfer of immunity for treatment of hypogammaglobulinemia in calves, the preservation of the gamma globulin fraction is essential. In our study there was no difference between the gamma globulin fraction expressed as g/dL and the percentage in fresh and thawed plasma at any time of storage studied. So bovine fresh frozen plasma seems to be suitable for treatment of hypogammaglobulinemia (failure of passive transfer of immunity) in calves when stored for 12 months at \u221220 \u2218 C.",
