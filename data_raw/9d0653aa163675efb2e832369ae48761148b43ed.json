The SIV H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes have been circulating for more than 30 years, and the SIV subtype H1N2 has been circulating since it was first isolated in Great Britain in 1994 [2, 3] . In April 2009, a new influenza A virus of subtype H1N1 emerged in the human population in Mexico and the United States. This was a multiple reassortant virus containing genes from North American and Eurasian lineages [4, 5] . The virus spread rapidly across the world by human-to-human transmission. Human-to-pig transmission was first reported in Canada in late April 2009, then in European pig population in early September 2009, and has since been reported in several countries all over the world [6] [7] [8] [9] . In October 2009, SIV was reported for the first time in Norway when an integrated pig herd tested positive for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus after showing mild clinical signs of respiratory disease [10] .",

Although pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus contains gene segment genetically related to other swine influenza virus strains circulating in Europe and North America, it shows antigenetic differences in the major glycoproteins of the virus [4] . However, it has been shown that pigs infected or vaccinated with H1N1 European avian-like swine influenza virus could produce cross-reactive antibodies against pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus which protected pigs against the infection of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus [13, 16] .",

Under the surveillance, blood samples from about 500 randomly selected herds are collected annually for specific disease surveillance [17] .

The study targeted the following categories of herds: (i) herds where pigs with influenza-like signs were observed, (ii) herds where the pigs had been exposed to humans with verified pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus infection or influenzalike illness (ILI), and (iii) herds with a history of contact with or in close proximity to infected herds through transfer of animals, usage of common equipment, for example, transport vehicles to slaughterhouse, and visitations from farmers of infected farms. In herds suspected to have an active infection, nasal swabs were collected from 20 pigs at different ages, with priority of sampling pigs with clinical symptoms. In herds without clinical signs, blood samples were collected from at least 20 pigs (sows or slaughtered pigs) for serological testing. Calculation of sample size was done assuming 100% test sensitivity and a within-herd prevalence >15%. The sample size implies that the risk of having 20 nonreactors from a positive farm is less than 4%.",

The biosecurity level is high in both types of herds.

From the herds that tested positive for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 in 2009, 38 herds consisting of 13 nucleus herds, 20 multiplier herds, and five conventional integrated herds were selected for the study. From each herd, blood samples from 20 slaughtered pigs were tested for antibodies against pandemic (H1N1) 2009. Blood samples were taken on the condition that 6 to 12 months had elapsed since the herd first tested positive and that the pigs tested were born at least 2 months after that time. An additional testing was performed in 9 herds about 18 months after the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 introduction. Study 4 consists of data from the national surveillance programme for SI in Norwegian pigs in 2009 and 2010. The program includes all nucleus and multiplier breeding herds and the nucleus unit of all sow pools. In addition, a random selection of conventional pig herds, 300 integrated and piglet-producing herds and 60 fattening herds, was selected from a population of approximately 2500 herds. Ten pigs in each herd were tested. With the exception of pigs from finishing herds, which are sampled at the abattoirs, the blood samples are collected from sows in the herds.",

A herd was considered seropositive if three or more blood samples from the herd were positive for influenza-A-specific NP antibodies. In case one or two of the 20 blood samples from a herd were ELISA positive, the herd was retested with samples from another 20 pigs, and the herd concluded positive if at least one of these samples was seropositive. Positive and/or inconclusive samples were retested for hemagglutinin-specific antibodies using HI assay with A/Sw/Belgium/1/98(H1N1), A/Sw/ Flanders/1/98(H3N2), and A/California/07/2009 (pandemic (H1N1) 2009) as antigens.

It was followed by a first minor wave of infected people during the Summer and a second major wave in the Autumn. Shortly after the onset of the Autumn wave, the first pig herd positive for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus was detected. Most Norwegian pig herds are small and family run. Hence, the farmer and family members must care for the pigs even when being ill. Many of the first positive pig herds had been in contact with people that were confirmed with pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus infection or people with ILI [10] . Herd-to-herd transmission was ruled out because there was no history of contact between herds that were positive for the virus or were seropositive. It is also known that many people could be infected with pandemic (H1N1) 2009 without showing clinical symptoms. This suggests that infected humans, with or without clinical symptoms, were an important factor in the introduction and transmission of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus to the Norwegian pig population. Sequencing analysis of virus isolated from humans and from pigs indicated that almost identical viruses had infected both species [10] . Furthermore, the high prevalence in nucleus and multiplying herds, that normally have no or few contacts with other herds, indicates that humans, and not trade with pigs, were responsible for introduction of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus to Norwegian pigs.",

This suggests virus transmission between pig herds, either by movement of pigs and people visiting infected herds. However, air transmission cannot be excluded [25] .

This has probably contributed to the high prevalence of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus in the Norwegian pig population. It has been shown that European pigs naturally infected or vaccinated with European SIVs have cross-reactive hemagglutinating antibodies against pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus [15, 16] . Moreover, natural infection with influenza virus stimulates mucosal immunity and cellular immune responses, responses that give partial protection against infection with an antigenetically unrelated strain [27, 28] . Surveillance of SIV in Europe prior to the emergence of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus showed that the three SIV subtypes \"avian-like\" H1N1, \"human-like\" H3N2, and \"human-like\" H1N2 were most often found in animals between 3-and 6 months old [29] . It should be noted that Norway is carrying out surveillance for SIV, including 4500-5000 samples from between 450 and 500 herds per year.",

For example, in Australia, pigs naturally infected with pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus only showed mild clinical signs. It was suggested that a lower infection pressure in natural infection as compared to experimental infection, as well as absence of other respiratory pathogens, could result in milder clinical signs [12] . In Norway, only a few pigs showed clinical signs like coughing, fever, and loss of appetite which are typical for SIV [3] . As Norway is free from most other viral respiratory diseases, presence of clinical signs like coughing would alert farmers who would notify their veterinarian or the authorities.",

The results show that there was no seroconversion in pigs born at least two months after the virus was first detected, indicating that there was no ongoing infection in the herds. A possible explanation may be that the Norwegian pig herds are small, and many herds practice batch farrowing of three, five and a half, or seven weeks intervals, with strict sectioning of the herds with allin all-out system. However, results from the surveillance in 2011 show that some pigs born in 2010/2011 are seropositive, indicating an ongoing spread of the infection. It is not clear to what extent this is caused by new introduction from humans or continued virus circulation between susceptible pigs since 2009. Continuing surveillance is important to show whether the virus has become enzootic in the Norwegian pig population.",

As long as Norway is free of other SIV subtypes, the risk of novel reassortant viruses spreading among pigs is low. However, reassortant viruses evolving in humans might be a risk for the Norwegian pig population. It is therefore important to continue the surveillance of SIV and genetic characterization of positive samples. Given the potential long-term presence of influenza virus in Norwegian pigs, it is also interesting to evaluate the economic impact of this disease and assess the cost effectiveness of new biosecurity measures or change in husbandry practices.",

Altogether 91 herds tested positive from 10th of October to 31st of December 2009. In the 55 seropositive herds, 59% (range 5% to 100%) of the individual samples from each herd were positive. From the 54 RT-PCR-positive herds, an average of 65% (range 5% to 100%) of the individual samples from each herd were positive. Geographically, the infected herds were found throughout Norway (Figure 1). In 2010, two out of nine herds tested were positive for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 by RT-PCR. During the first six months of 2011, two out of five herds tested were positive by RT-PCR. These herds were sampled on suspicion of infection with SIV based on clinical signs in the pigs.",
