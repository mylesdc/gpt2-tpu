In April 2009, an outbreak of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection was detected in Mexico, with subsequent cases observed in many other countries, including Portugal. It has spread quickly throughout the world and caused at least 15000 deaths in less than a year [1] . Unlike the disease pattern observed during epidemics of seasonal influenza, many of the severe cases of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection were observed in healthy young people, with approximately 90% of all deaths due to influenza occurring in those younger than 65 years [2] . Most people infected with influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus experienced mild disease, with upper respiratory illness similar to seasonal influenza virus infection. In contrast, gastrointestinal symptoms occurred more frequently in patients infected with pandemic influenza virus than in those with seasonal influenza [3] . According to the Portuguese Influenza Surveillance Program (NISP), 64% of the laboratory-confirmed cases for the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus were detected in the age group of 5-14 years old. A total of 1436 hospitalizations were reported, and the estimated mortality rate was 1.17 per 100000 inhabitants, corresponding to 124 laboratory confirmed influenza deaths [4] .",

Intensive research has been performed on the virulence of the virus including its genomic variability but very little is known about the host genetic background influence in the influenza outcome, despite its crucial impact on the immune response and the course of infection [5] . Consequently, in 2009, the World Health Organization identified studies of the host genetic factors' role on susceptibility to severe influenza as a priority [6] .",

Our results show that the IFITM3 rs12252 variant was associated with respiratory disease hospitalizations but not in the ILI patients with a laboratory confirmed Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection. On the other hand, we observed that the risk of being hospitalized for the CT/CC genotype was 2.54 fold when compared to the TT genotype in ILI patients negative for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection. Given these results, we hypothesize that this variant is involved in the ILI symptoms severity associated with other respiratory infections. During the H1N1 pandemic influenza season, the Portuguese Laboratory Network just carried out the influenza virus detection (influenza A (H1N1)pdm09, influenza A(H1) seasonal, influenza A(H3) and influenza B virus), therefore we must consider the hypothesis of the presence of other infectious agents associated with respiratory disease (adenovirus, coronavirus, rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and other less frequent respiratory agents) in the Influenza negative samples that could explain our results. In addition, some studies show that IFITM3 is also important in the mediation of other virus infections such as West Nile Virus and Dengue Virus [20] and this hypothesis could justify the higher percentage of C allele carriers in the ILI hospitalized Influenza negative cases. The future detection of other respiratory virus in the analyzed samples would be important to clarify our results.",

However, we have reduced this bias by excluding patients with disease onset reported in the contention phase when health authorities had the indication to hospitalise all influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 cases. In addition, the hospitalization criteria that were used in the different health units might not be uniform and could be different from influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 positive and negative cases given the pandemic alert and the indications of the health authorities This differential criterion for hospitalization could explain the presence of the IFITM3 rs12252 association in the negative influenza patients and the absence in the positive influenza patients. The extent of this bias could not be evaluated with the available data. On the other hand, we only performed the confounding adjustment for age and sex variables in the logistic regression analysis, but the reduction of possible confounding bias were also achieved by the exclusion criteria used in the patients selection, excluding patients with known risk factors for influenza infection complication. Regarding the possible selection bias, we were only able to evaluate the representativeness of the influenza hospitalized patients with less 65 years of age without known co morbidities, the patients recorded in the NHD during H1N1 pandemic were not statistical different from the ones included in the study regarding age and sex variables.",
