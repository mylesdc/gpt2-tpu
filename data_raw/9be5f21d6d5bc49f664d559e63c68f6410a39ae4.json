To date, no effective therapy for WNV infection has been developed; therefore, there is urgent need to find an efficient method to prevent WNV disease. In this study, we prepared and evaluated the protective efficacy of immune serum IgG and pepsin-digested F(ab ) 2 fragments from horses immunized with the WNV virus-like particles (VLP) expressing the WNV M and E proteins. Immune equine F(ab ) 2 fragments and immune horse sera efficiently neutralized WNV infection in tissue culture. The passive transfer of equine immune antibodies significantly accelerated the virus clearance in the spleens and brains of WNV infected mice, and reduced mortality. Thus, equine immunoglobulin or equine neutralizing F(ab ) 2 passive immunotherapy is a potential strategy for the prophylactic or therapeutic treatment of patients infected with WNV.",

Some vaccines and treatments have been developed, including imino sugar derivatives [3] , DNA vaccines [4] , interferon treatment, and human monoclonal antibodies [5] . The clinical evaluation of hE16 and other mAb therapeutics for flavivirus infections should monitor for the selection or emergence of resistant variants, especially in immunocompromised patients who are a likely target population for the treatment of severe WNV infections [6] . The use of a large dose of ribavirin inhibited WNV replication in vitro [7] ; however, it was less efficient in vivo-the mortality of the hamsters infected with WNV increased after the ribavirin injection [8] . The WNV RNA replication process is inhibited in vitro by mycophenolate (another candidate inhibitor) [9] , which showed no protective effect in vivo. Another clinical study indicated that interferon alpha (IFN-\u03b1) could be protective against WNV infection [10] ; however, only limited evidence has shown that IFN-\u03b1 could cure patients with serious WNV encephalitis.",

However, vaccine immunizations might not protect patients who have already developed WNV neuroinvasion. As of now, there are no licensed vaccines or therapeutics for human use. In the study of Engle and Diamond, they found that immune mouse antibodies cannot be directly used in humans due to the heterogeneity of intact mouse IgG, which has the risk of inducing an allergic response in humans; human IgGs are not readily available in large quantities [12] . Passive immunotherapy has been proven useful for many infectious diseases. The administration of polyclonal immunoglobulins from hyperimmune animals or humans has controlled hepatitis B virus (HBV) [13] and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [14] . The equine antibodies-especially the F(ab )2 fragments with reduced heterogeneity-are polyclonal, easy to purify in large quantities, and relatively inexpensive and successfully used to prevent Rabies virus infection [15] and snake venom in humans [16, 17] . They can serve as a useful preparedness for WNV pandemic.",

To avoid potential allergic responses, pepsin was used to digest the antibodies and to generate the F(ab )2 fragments. The protective efficacy of the serum IgG and F(ab )2 fragments against WNV was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. The serum IgG and F(ab )2 fragments neutralized WNV infection in tissue culture, as determined by a plaque reduction assay. Furthermore, prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of mice with purified IgG or F(ab )2 fragments significantly decreased the viral loads in the spleens and brains of WNV-infected mice, and reduced mortality. These results indicate that equine immunoglobulin and equine neutralizing F(ab )2 passive immunotherapy could be potentially useful for the treatment of patients infected with WNV.",

Furthermore, we found that the purified equine IgG and F(ab ) 2 also neutralized WNV infection with half effective maximal concentrations (EC50) of 4.1 \u00b5g/mL and 16.5 \u00b5g/mL for the IgG and F(ab ) 2 fragments, respectively ( Figure 3C,D) . Of note, the EC50 of the F(ab ) 2 fragments was lower than that of the IgG in vitro. These results suggest that equine antibody products exhibit highly potent neutralizing activity against WNV in tissue culture. ",

Equine F(ab )2 fragments surmount the bottleneck of antibody yield, possess broader antigenic coverage, and avoid the emergence of escape mutants [25] [26] [27] . Of note, equine antibodies are relatively economical and are readily available. Although convalescent plasma from patients has shown some protective efficacy, the neutralizing antibody titers in patients are generally low, and the limited number of survivors makes this approach impractical [28] [29] [30] .",

The results of this study show that F(ab )2 fragments are not as efficient as IgG, both in vitro and in vivo, and a possible factor contributing to this outcome is that F(ab )2 has a shorter half-life than IgG.",
