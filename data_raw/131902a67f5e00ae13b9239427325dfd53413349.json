It has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as passive immunoprophylaxis for use among infants at high risk, including those born prematurely and those with chronic lung disease or congenital heart disease [8] [9] [10] . However, its high cost ($2,962 per 100-mg vial of palivizumab in June 2013) prevents its use in low-income countries [11] , and as a mAb, it has to be maintained and transported under low temperature. Furthermore, palivizumab must be prescribed by pediatricians or physicians and intramuscularly injected at doctors' offices, hospitals, or clinics, making its use inconvenient. An ideal prophylactic RSV drug should be effective, safe, affordable and easy to use for both infants and the elderly. Therefore, we aimed to identify an antiviral agent that is expected to be as effective and safe as palivizumab, but more affordable and easier to use for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) of RSV infection among infants at high risk.",

We selected ML-modified HSA (ML-HSA) for further study because ML is much cheaper than HP, while HSA is much safer than BSA for human use. The mechanism study indicated that ML-HSA inhibits RSV entry and replication by blocking RSV attachment to the target cells though its interaction with viral G protein.

Lung homogenates (10%; wt/vol) were prepared in Hanks balanced salt solution containing 0.21 M sucrose, 25 mM HEPES, and 5 mM sodium L-glutamate supplemented with 20 U/mL of penicillin G, 20 \u03bcg/mL of streptomycin, and 0.05 \u03bcg/mL of amphotericin B (Sigma). Lung homogenates were frozen on dry ice and thawed to release cell-associated virus. Samples of lung homogenates were centrifuged at 300 \u00d7 g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C, and the supernatants were collected for viral titration in HEp-2 cells. In brief, each test sample was assayed in duplicate sets of serial 3.17-fold dilutions in serum-free DMEM supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U of penicillin and 100 \u03bcg of streptomycin per mL. Each 200-\u03bcL diluted sample was plated to HEp-2 cells in flat-bottom 24-well polystyrene plates (Corning, Acton, MA, USA). Then plaque assay was performed as described above.",

The amino acid sequences of the G proteins of the wild-type strain (parent strain) and ML-HSA resistant strain were compared. We observed 8 amino acid mutations (K62I, K149R, Q152R, N157G, K158R, N161G, N169D, and N179D) in the G protein of the resistant strain, 7 of which were located in the region overlapping the residues 145-186, including the conserved domain (residues 164-186).

BALB/c mice (n = 8) were intranasally administered with ML-HSA at a single dose of 5, 15, 50 or 75 mg/kg, respectively, mixed with RSV Long Strain (2.1 \u00d7 10 5 PFU). Four days post-infection, the mice were sacrificed, and viral titers in the lung homogenates were measured. As shown in Figure 8A , the viral titer in the untreated mice was in the range of 3.4 to 4.4 (mean = 3.98) log10 PFU per gram of lung tissue. The mean viral titers in the lungs of the mice treated with 5 and 15 mg/kg of ML-HSA were 3.97 and 3.7 log10 PFU per gram of lung tissue, respectively, thus showing no significant difference from the untreated group (p > 0.05). The mean viral titers in the lungs of mice treated with 50 and 75 mg/kg of ML-HSA were 2.41 and 2.25 log10 PFU per gram of lung tissue, respectively, which were significantly lower than those in the untreated control group (p < 0.01 for both groups). Thus, the RSV titer in the lungs of mice treated with 5, 15, 50, and 75 mg/kg of ML-HSA was reduced by 2.3%, 46.8%, 97.3% and 98.1%, respectively ( Figure 8B ), suggesting that ML-HSA, at the concentration of 50 and 75 mg/kg, can very effectively inhibit RSV replication in vivo.

While all these anhydride-modified proteins exhibited potent inhibitory activity against infection by RSV A2 and Long strains, HP-and ML-modified BSA and HSA were found to be more effective than other anhydride-modified proteins (Table 1) . We selected ML-modified HSA for further study because (1) HSA is safer than BSA for human use, as some infants may be allergic to bovine proteins; and (2) the purchase price of HP is much higher than that of ML, making the production costs of ML-HSA much lower than those of HP-HSA. In addition, ML is a common anhydride used in pharmaceuticals. McCormick et al. have reported that maleic anhydride-divinyl ether copolymer (MVE-2) inhibits mammary and urinary bladder carcinogenesis [34] . Xie et al. demonstrated that FB006M, an anti-HIV-1 peptide modified with a ML derivative, exhibited no significant toxic effect to animals and human [35] . Based on our toxicity tests, ML-HSA showed no detectable cytotoxicity to HEp-2 and Vero cells ( Figure 2 ).",

We then used a temperature shift assay to determine whether ML-HSA blocks viral attachment or binding to target cells based on the principle that RSV can attach or bind to target cells at 4 \u00b0C, while delaying cell fusion until the temperature is shifted to 18 \u00b0C or higher. Thus, if ML-HSA can block virus attachment to, but not fusion with the target cells, it will still retain inhibitory activity against RSV replication after the unbound ML-HSA and virus are removed following virus attachment at 4 \u00b0C, but before the temperature is raised to 18 \u00b0C or higher [33] . As shown in Figure 4 , ML-HSA had similar IC50s whether or not when the unbound ML-HSA was removed before the temperature was shifted to 37 \u00b0C, confirming that ML-HSA blocks the attachment of RSV to the target cells, possibly by its interaction with the viral G protein. Indeed, ML-HSA binds with the G protein of RSV in a dose-dependent manner, as shown in ELISA ( Figure 6A ). In contrast, both ML-HSA and HSA showed no significant binding to F protein at the concentration up to 1000 nM ( Figure 6B ). However, our results, as herein presented, could not rule out the possibility that ML-HSA might also interact with F protein at a higher concentration in a non-specific way. In addition, the purified F protein that was tested here is likely in a post-fusion conformation, which is expected to be different from the pre-fusion conformation of RSV F protein. Therefore, further determining whether ML-HSA binds to the pre-fusion form of F protein is warranted.",

Interestingly, two Asn residues in this region were substituted with the negatively charged Asp residues (N169D and N179D), leading to increased net negative charges in the binding site of ML-HSA in the G protein, possibly resulting in the decreased electrostatic interaction between the negatively charged ML-HSA and G protein of RSV.",

            "text": "To the best of our knowledge, no RSV vaccine is currently available [37] . Palivizumab, an anti-RSV mAb, has been used as an immunoprophylaxis to prevent RSV infection in infants at high risk of RSV infection, including those with a history of prematurity, chronic lung disease, and congenital heart disease [38] . However, its high cost is prohibitive in low-income countries. As demonstrated in this study, ML-HSA is highly effective in inhibiting RSV infection in vitro in cell culture and in vivo in a mouse model. Furthermore, ML-HSA significantly reduced the titers of RSV in the lungs of mice when it was administered intranasally before challenge with RSV. Therefore, ML-HSA may be used as a prophylactic agent to prevent RSV infection in infants at high-risk or immunocompromised persons of RSV infection. However, unlike palivizumab, which must be intramuscularly injected by nurses or doctors in hospitals, clinics or doctors' offices, ML-HSA can be intranasally administered by the parents of infants in the home or other places. Because of its intranasal application, ML-HSA may be approved for over-the-counter use. Palivizumab must be maintained and transported under low temperature, while ML-HSA may be kept at room temperature for at least 12 weeks based on its high stability ( Figure 2C,D) . Our previous study has also shown that the HP-modified LG protein maintained its antiviral activity for 3 months when it was kept at room temperature [12, 38] . Therefore, ML-HSA might be made into a nasal spray or any other portable form for use with infants at high risk or immunocompromised persons before travelling to high-risk areas, such as hospitals or densely populated public areas, or used directly at such places to acquire protection against RSV cross-infection for a period. In our mouse model of RSV infection, ML-HSA administered 30 min prior to RSV infection yielded a significant protection. However, purified RSV with a high titer was used to infect BALB/c mice, differing from human infection with RSV virions which, in high-risk areas, are suspended in the air with low titer and, hence, easily spread. Therefore, in actual use, longer protection might be obtained with ML-HSA against RSV infection. While this topic outside the scope of the present work, further formulation development and clinical trials make this determination.",
