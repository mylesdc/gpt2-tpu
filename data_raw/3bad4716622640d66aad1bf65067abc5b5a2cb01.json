A safe and effective H5N1 vaccine is urgently needed to reduce the pandemic potential. Hemagglutinin (HA), a major envelope protein accounting for approximately 80% of spikes in influenza virus, is often used as a major antigen for subunit vaccine development. In this study, we conducted a systematic study of the immune response against influenza virus infection following immunization with recombinant HA proteins expressed in insect (Sf9) cells, insect cells that contain exogenous genes for elaborating N-linked glycans (Mimic) and mammalian cells (CHO). While the antibody titers are higher with the insect cell derived HA proteins, the neutralization and HA inhibition titers are much higher with the mammalian cell produced HA proteins. Recombinant HA proteins containing tri-or tetra-antennary complex, terminally sialylated and asialyated-galactose type N-glycans induced better protective immunity in mice to lethal challenge. The results are highly relevant to issues that should be considered in the production of fragment vaccines.",

The first instance of human HPAI H5N1 virus infection occurred in Hong Kong in 1997; it re-emerged in 2003 and has triggered sporadic human infections in Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and Africa with a mortality rate that could be as high as 60% [2] but the true mortality rate of H5N1 infected individuals is currently unknown [3] . Humans can be infected with H5N1 from close contact with infected poultry, and virus mutations have been identified in cases of cross-human transmission. Recent reports indicate that the involvement of HA and PB2 amino acid substitutions leads to easier transmission in ferrets, suggesting that HPAI H5N1 viruses have the potential to evolve and be transmitted between mammals, thus posing the risk of a human pandemic [4, 5] . Accordingly, an effective H5N1 vaccine is urgently needed to reduce pandemic potential.",

These structures clearly elaborate the differences between insect cell expressed HA ( Figure 1A ) and mammalian cell expressed HA ( Figure 1B) . For insect cell expression, the soluble recombinant HA-expressing coding sequences were cloned into a pFast-Bac vector to obtain recombinant baculoviruses for infecting Sf9 and Mimic cells. For CHO cell (mammalian) expression, the HA coding sequence was optimized and cloned into a pISID expression vector containing intron splicing; IRES-driven dhfr gene amplification was performed as described in Lin et al. (2010) [19] . Recombinant HA proteins were obtained from the culture supernatants of Sf9, Mimic, and CHO cells and purified using nickel-chelated affinity chromatography. Results from the Coomassie blue staining of SDS-PAGE gels and anti-H5HA antibodies indicate that recombinant HA proteins from Sf9 cells (Sf9-rHA) had lower molecular weights than the HA proteins from Mimic cells (Mimic-rHA), and that the recombinant HA proteins from CHO cells (CHO-rHA) had the highest molecular weights (Figure 2A,B) . Purified recombinant proteins of sf9-rHA, Mimic-rHA, and CHO-rHA obtained from nickel-chelated affinity chromatography were .90% as shown by Coomassie blue staining (Figure 2A) . Although the purified HA protein was clearly the major component of the final preparations, host cell contaminants (i.e. DNA) and microbial or endotoxin contaminants were also present by the lab-scale purification equipment and procedures. However, the levels of DNA and endotoxin are relatively minor to affect immune responses in this study. We only detected low-level endotoxin in the purified recombinant HA proteins since cultured insect and mammalian cells were used for HA expression (data not shown).",

Figures 2A and 2B demonstrate the removal of terminal sialic acid with decreased molecular weights (CHO-rHA vs. CHO-rHA(+NA)). To further confirm that changing molecular weights reflected differences in glycan form, recombinant HA proteins were treated with Endo H and PNGase F. The high-to-low order of molecular weights following treatment with Endo H was CHO-rHA . CHO-rHA(+NA) . Mimic-rHA . Sf9-rHA ( Figure 2C ). Since Endo H only cleaves the mannose-terminated N-glycans, no molecular weight shifts were observed for CHO-rHA and CHO-rHA(+NA) ( Figure 2C vs. Figure 2A,B) . In contrast, all four recombinant HA proteins had approximately equal molecular weights following treatment with PNGase F ( Figure 2D ). The results confirm that different N-linked glycans were added to the HA glycoproteins via insect or mammalian cell expression. Since similar molecular weights were observed in sf9-rHA and CHO-rHA after PNGase F treatment ( Figure 2D ), the alpha 1-3 fucose on the first GlcNAc, which was resistant to PNGase F, was not the major glycan structure in sf9-rHA. However, no alpha 1-3 fucose exists in CHO-rHA since CHO cells only introduce alpha 1,6fucose to N-glycans [20] .",

The Sf9-rHA primarily contained pauci-mannose (Man 2-3 GlcNAc 2 +/2Fuc; 74.3%) and high-mannose glycans (Man 4-9 GlcNAc 2 +/2Fuc; 17.1%), along with a much smaller amount of hybrid glycans (Man 3 GlcNAc 3 Fuc; 6.9%) ( Figure 3A) . The Mimic-rHA primarily contained biantennary complex glycans without terminal sialic acid (Gal 1-2 Man 3 GlcNAc 4 +/2Fuc; 58%), along with high-mannose (Man 7-9 GlcNAc 2 +/2Fuc; 29.2%), hybrid (Man 3 GlcNAc 3 +/2Fuc; 6%), and minor pauci-mannose glycans (Man 3 GlcNAc 2 +/2Fuc; 3.1%) ( Figure 3B ).

The CHO-rHA(+NA) glycan patterns consisted of complex N-glycans with bi-, tri-, and tetra-antennary structures terminated at galactose ends due to sialic acid-associated NA cleavage.

We only investigated the immune responses elicited by recombinant HA proteins coupled with PELC+CpG adjuvant. Although it is unlikely that the nonadjuvanted recombiant HA proteins can elicit detectable neutralizing antibody response, we still cannot conclude the antigen glycoforms may elicit different B and T cell responses without adjuvant. Antisera were collected 2 wk following the second inoculations. Total anti-HA IgG antibody titers were measured using ELISA (Sf9-rHA, Figure 4A ; CHO-rHA, Figure 4B ).

To examine the effects of Sf9-rHA, Mimic-rHA, CHO-rHA and CHO-rHA(+NA) on antigen presentation, we treated bone marrow-derived DCs with LPS for 1 h, followed by incubation with four groups of rHAs for 3 h and co-culturing with splenocytes obtained from mice immunized with Sf9-rHA. Bone marrow-derived DCs pulsed with Sf9-rHA resulted in the strongest presentation of stimulated IFNc-secreting T cells, followed by DCs pulsed with Mimic-rHA and CHO-rHA ( Figure 6C ). CHO-rHA stimulation was slightly restored by removing the terminal sialic acids of HA-that is, with HILIC-HPLC and used as a standard to provide glucose unit (GU) values for individual peaks recognized in glycan samples from recombinant HA proteins. Shown are HA N-glycan profiles of (A) Sf9-rHA, (B) Mimic-rHA, and (C) CHO-rHA.

Higher levels of IL-2-secreting T cells were also observed in DCs pulsed with Sf9-rHA compared to the other three groups ( Figure 6D ). Parallel studies using animals immunized with Sf9-rHA, Mimic-rHA, CHO-rHA, and CHO-rHA(+NA) reacted with DCs pulsed with each of different constructs also showed that Sf9-rHA resulted in the strongest presentation of stimulated IFN-c-secreting and IL-2-secreting T cells, indicating that the T cells responded best to DCs pulsed with Sf9-rHA no matter which HA molecule the mice were immunized with ( Figure S1 ). Combined, these results indicate a correlation between stronger T cell responses elicited by Sf9-rHA immunization and increases in antigen-presenting DCs.",

While the antibody titers are higher with the insect cell derived HA proteins, the neutralization titers are much higher with the mammalian cell produced HA proteins with complex type N-linked glycans and the antibodies protect mice to lethal challenge.

            "text": "Our finding that CHO-rHA induced higher HI and neutralizing antibody titers than Sf9-rHA is consistent with other studies involving recombinant HA expressed in HEK293 cells [7, 8] . CHO-rHA contains bi-, tri-, and tetra-antennary complex type Nglycans with terminal sialic acid, whereas Sf9-rHA mainly consists of pauci-mannose and high-mannose type N-glycans. It was recently reported that recombinant HA proteins carrying terminal mannose residues induce lower HI antibody titers than HA proteins that carry complex glycans or single GlcNAc units [7, 17] . The findings of the present study are somewhat contradictory to the above in as much as recombinant HA proteins carrying low or high mannose glycans elicited higher titers of HA-specific antibodies and stronger T cell responses. Indeed, the higher the glycan content of tri-and tetra-antennary complex glycans, the greater was the neutralizing and HI titers and consequent protective effect. Therefore, the increased HI and neutralizing antibody titers associated with CHO-rHA are not due to suppressed DC activation by the terminal mannose moieties of HA glycoprotein, as has been reported for influenza HA [7] and HIV-1 gp120 [33] . Instead, we found that Sf9-rHA induced the highest levels of HA-specific total IgG and avidity in three of the four IgG subtypes (IgG2a, IgG2b and IgG3), as well as higher levels of IFN-c-secreting T cells and increased DC antigen presentation efficiency. Although the purified proteins of Sf9-rHA, Mimic-rHA, and CHO-rHA have identical amino acid sequences, the antigen presentation efficiencies of these antigens were significantly different ( Figure 6C , D and Figure S1 ). As it was known that intracellular antigen uptake, routing, and presentation are associated with distinct endocytic receptors such as C-type lectins [34, 35] , the increased antigen presentation efficiency by Sf9-rHA may be through mannose-terminated N-glycans interacted with lectin receptors guiding to early endosomal compartment but still required further investigation.",

Greater sialic acid binding has been reported following the trimming and modification of the oligosaccharides of N-glycans such as single GlcNAc [17] , pauci-mannose, and high-mannose [7, 36] . Removal of the terminal sialic acids of complex type N-glycans increased sialic acid binding [8, 17, 36] . Results from fetuin binding assays with Sf9-rHA, Mimic-rHA, CHO-rHA and CHO-rHA(+NA) indicate a high-to-low binding activity order of Sf9-rHA . Mimic-rHA . CHO-rHA(+NA) . CHO-rHA ( Figure S2 ). Since fetuin contains both a2-3and a2-6-linked sialic acids, we used a 98glycan array to analyze these recombinant HA proteins; our results indicate binding between Sf9-rHA and 18 of 26 a2-3-linked sialic acids, but not between Sf9-rHA and any of the 13 a2-6-linked sialic acids ( Figure S3 ). Mimic-rHA reduced binding to a2-3linked sialic acids by approximately 50%; no binding was observed for a2-6-linked sialic acids. Relatively low bindings were found for CHO-rHA and CHO-rHA(+NA) to a2-3-linked sialic acids, as compared to strong binding to Sf9-rHA. The binding intensity of CHO-rHA to a2-3-linked sialic acids decreased by almost 25 folds as compared to Sf9-rHA; however, CHO-rHA(+NA) further increased the binding to a2-3-linked sialic acids by approximate 3 folds. In contrast, immunization with CHO-rHA elicited higher levels of HI and neutralizing antibodies, and better protective immunity against challenges with live viruses. These results conflict with a recent description of single GlcNAc HA N-glycans increasing the receptor binding of sialic acids, as well as correlations between this increase and increases in both neutral-izing antibody titers and protective immunity in mice [17] . Accordingly, recombinant HA protein antigenicity and immunogenicity may not be directly associated with the receptor binding activity of a2-3-linked sialic acids.",

            "text": "Our results indicate that the removal of terminal sialic acid from bi-, tri-, and tetra-antennary HA complex-type N-glycans improved protective immunity, as determined by reductions in body weight loss (CHO-rHA(+NA) in Figure 8B ). The enhanced protective immunity provided by the removal of sialic acid by neuraminidase can be also due to CHO-rHA protein degradation induced by 37uC/6hr treatment which requires further confirmation. We also found that the terminal sialic acids of complex-type HA glycoproteins did not significantly affect neutralizing antibody titers against homologous and heterologous H5N1 virus clades (Figure 7) , but did induce higher levels of IFN-c-secreting T cells and increase DC-associated antigen presentation efficiency ( Figure 6) . It was reported that recombinant HA proteins from Sf9 and HEK293 cells to show that anti-H5N1 neutralizing antibody responses are not dependent on terminally sialyated Nglycans [8] . Increased DC binding has been reported following the removal of HIV-1 gp120 terminal sialic acid [37] , therefore improved protective immunity from galactose-terminated complex N-glycans may also be due to increased interaction with DCs. In a separate study, HA N-glycans of the PR/8/34 (H1N1) influenza A virus produced in MDCK and Vero cells were all asialyated, with the former containing larger, tri-or tetra-antennary, alpha-and beta-galactose-terminated N-glycans, and the latter containing smaller, exclusively beta-galactose-terminated N-glycans [38] . MDCK cell-derived viruses with the N-glycan pattern have been found to favor antibody responses, while Vero cell-derived influenza viruses with the N-glycan pattern have been described as increasing differential T cell responses mediated by DCs [39] . In the present study, immunization with Mimic-rHA (primarily containing galactose-terminated, bi-antennary, and high-mannose type complex N-glycans) yielded lower levels of protective immunity and decreases in body weight loss (Figure 8 ). This suggests that tri-or tetra-antennary complex-type N-glycans are required for inducing protective immunity against H5N1 virus infection. This strongly suggests that recombinant HA glycoproteins with tri-or tetra-antennary complex type N-glycans (obtainable from engineered CHO cells) have potential for use in subunit vaccine development. Since ferrets are regarded as the most appropriate animal model for H5N1 pathogenesis and therapeutic and prophylactic development [3, 40, 41] , the differences and similarities in the mouse, ferret, and human immune response and the projected testing of these recombinant HA vaccines require further investigation.",

A dextran ladder generated by HILIC-HPLC was used as a standard to obtain glucose unit (GU) values for individual peaks recognized in glycans from rHA antigens.
