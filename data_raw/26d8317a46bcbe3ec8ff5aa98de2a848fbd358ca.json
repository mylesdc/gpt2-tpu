The commonest virus identified was influenza A followed by HRV. HRV typing identified HRV-A and HRV-C as the more common HRV with a wide variety of genotypes. Identification of pathogens in NPA or HRV typing otherwise did not affect clinical outcomes including the hospital length of stay, readmission rates and mortality except that identification of pathogens in asthma exacerbation was associated with a lower rate of readmissions at 30 and 60 days. Conclusions: Many respiratory viruses were associated with AECOPD and asthma exacerbation. HRV-A and HRV-C were the more common HRV associated with exacerbations. Identification of pathogens in NPA was associated with less readmissions for asthma patients at 30 and 60 days. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02866357.",

Among the respiratory viruses, HRV infection preceded as many as 50% of asthma exacerbations in children [11] .

A cross-sectional study of subjects aged < 18 years in Hong Kong between October 2008 and March 2009 found that asthma exacerbation was strongly associated with HRV and specifically HRV-C infections [13] . Similar observation for asthma children in other parts of the world was observed [27] [28] [29] . HRV-C appeared more strongly associated with more severe exacerbations, including those requiring hospitalization [30, 31] . In contrast, our adults with asthma exacerbation had HRV-A being isolated from the NPA more frequently than HRV-C. The pattern thus appeared different from the findings in children. A study in Japan showed that HRV-A or HRV-C had a potential role in precipitating asthma attacks among Japanese adult patients, with a broad genetic divergence [14] . Data on the type of HRV that are associated with AECOPD are scarce. There are more than 168 distinct HRV genotypes, including 80 HRV-A, 32 HRV-B serotypes and 65 newly identified HRV-C genotypes. The HRV structural and genetic variability has inhibited efforts to develop antivirals [14] . Studies in COPD patients generally have not typed the HRV.",

            "text": "Those with history of influenza vaccination appeared to have a higher rate of identification of influenza viruses in the NPA than those without vaccination for both AECOPD and asthma exacerbation though this did not reach statistical significance. A previous study suggested that protective serum antibody titres in COPD patients after influenza vaccination was lower than control subjects [32] . Overall the mortality benefit of influenza vaccine in COPD is suggested by some studies but the impact on exacerbation prevention is less clear [33] . Another systemic review indicated a favorable benefitrisk ratio for seasonal influenza vaccination in patients with COPD [34] . For persons with asthma, a recent systematic review observed that influenza vaccination might be effective in both reducing influenza infection and asthma attacks [35] . However, another Cochrane review has expressed uncertainty of the degree of protection that influenza vaccination might confer against asthma exacerbations that are related to influenza infection [36] . During the study period from August 2016 to July 2017, influenza A(H3N2) was the main circulating strain causing the Summer and Winter epidemics in Hong Kong [37] . Influenza vaccine effectiveness depends on many factors including matching between vaccine strains and the circulating strains, immunocompetence, age, repeated vaccination, antigenic sites and distances in addition to egg adaptation especially for influenza A(H3N2) virus [38] . A previous systematic review found substantial variations in influenza vaccine effectiveness across types and subtypes of influenza with substantially lower protection against H3N2 [39] . Examination of influenza vaccine effectiveness by serology is beyond the scope of this study as it would require a large sample size. In addition, as these patients had some time delay in presenting to the hospitals, it would be difficult to determine whether this was due to current or previous infection or vaccination by measuring influenza antibody based on haemagglutinin inhibition. While identification of pathogens in the NPA was associated with a lower rate of readmissions for asthma, exacerbations of COPD and asthma might also be due to other acute and transient factors such as exposure to air pollutants [4, 5] , change in temperature, etc.",

As the study mainly aimed to assess the subjects in exacerbation state, only 1/5 the number of exacerbation of subjects were recruited as controls. Furthermore, the same subjects were not tested between exacerbations due to the limitation of budget. The exacerbation and stable state subjects were not matched for gender, age and inhaler therapies. There were other factors that might be associated with AECOPD and asthma exacerbations, e.g. air pollution, weather changes, allergic sensitization, etc. that were not investigated. Bacterial infection might also play a part in AECOPD and this was not assessed in this study. Interaction of the microorganisms with other factors such as air pollutions and weather may be important. Although viral and atypical bacteria were identified in some subjects with exacerbations, we could not establish a causative role as some stable subjects also had pathogens identified in their NPA. The subjects involved in this study had severe airway disease exacerbations requiring hospitalizations and the result could not be extrapolated to those with milder illnesses being managed in the community.",
