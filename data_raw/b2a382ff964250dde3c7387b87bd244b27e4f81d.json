(2019) Distinct transcriptional modules in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells response to human respiratory syncytial virus or to human rhinovirus in hospitalized infants with bronchiolitis. PLoS ONE 14(3): e0213501. https://doi.Viral bronchiolitis is frequent and has an important impact on the children's health care due to the high rates of hospitalization and mortality, especially of young infants [1, 2] . Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) is the predominant etiological agent, but infections by other respiratory viruses, such as human rhinovirus (HRV), metapneumovirus, parainfluenza, influenza, adenovirus, and coronavirus, also occur. These infections with different respiratory virus present similar clinical characteristics, so etiological diagnosis can be carried out in clinical practice only by virus identification, either by molecular tests, immunofluorescence or culture methods [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . Although the current guidelines do not indicate routine tests to identify the etiologic agent in infants with bronchiolitis, the etiological diagnosis may contribute to the prevention of nosocomial acquisition, since the transmission mechanisms diverge among respiratory viruses. Knowledge on molecular epidemiology also contributes to programming and organizing prophylactic strategies, such as the use of monoclonal antibodies to HRSV and influenza vaccination [3, 6] . Etiological diagnosis may also contribute for developing specific therapeutic approaches for each agent.",

HRSV is the main agent of bronchiolitis, responsible for high rates of hospitalization and it is a major cause of mortality, especially in premature infants and those with risk factors. Despite this fact, the therapeutic approach consists mainly in supportive measures [3] . HRV is the most common agent of cold and triggering asthma attacks in atopic individuals, however around 35% of asymptomatic subjects have positive results for HRV tests [8] . Serious infections by both agents in early life are associated with recurrent wheezing in the following years, but this association is stronger with HRV. While HRSV infection leads to structural and functional changes in the airways, HRV infections do not cause as many changes and are more related to atopy and asthma [9] . Clinical studies suggest that the use of corticosteroids during the acute phase of infection with high levels of HRV may reduce the risk of recurrent wheezing in the subsequent year [10, 11] .",

Furthermore, PBMC transcriptome profiles can be used to assess disease severity in infants with HRSV [7] and to predict individualized responses to HRV [14] .

In hospitalized infants with bronchiolitis, the analysis of gene expression profiles from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) may be useful for the rapid identification of etiological factors, as well as for developing diagnostic tests, and elucidating pathogenic mechanisms triggered by different viral agents. In this study we conducted a comparative global gene expression analysis of PBMC obtained from two groups of infants with acute viral bronchiolitis who were infected by HRSV (HRSV group) or by HRV (HRV group). We employed a weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) which allows the identification of transcriptional modules and their correlations with HRSV or HRV groups. This approach permitted the identification of distinct transcription modules for the HRSV and HRV groups. According to these data, the immune response to HRSV infection-comparatively to HRV infection-was more associated to the activation of the interferon gamma signaling pathways and less related to neutrophil activation mechanisms. Moreover, we also identified host-response molecular markers that could be used for etiopathogenic diagnosis. These results may contribute to the development of new tests for respiratory virus identification. The finding that distinct transcriptional profiles are associated to specific host responses to HRSV or to HRV may also contribute to the elucidation of the pathogenic mechanisms triggered by different respiratory viruses, paving the way for new therapeutic strategies.

Module identification is based on TOM and in average linkage hierarchical clustering. Finally, dynamic cut-tree algorithm was used for dendrogram's branch selection.

Firstly, we obtained the gene significance (GS), which is a value of the correlation between the trait (here is represented by HRSV or HRV groups) and the gene expression values. The mean GS for a particular module is considered as a measure of module significance (MS).

            "text": "It is well established that systemic neutrophil response correlates with increased disease severity and it is mediated by the neutrophil chemoattractant. In the fatal cases of HRSV inflammatory neutrophils were found widespread in lung tissue [25] . Moreover, Choi et al [23] showed that HRV is associated with neutrophil activation and inflammatory response while HRSV is associated with lymphocyte-mediated inflammation. In this study, the PBMC transcriptomic analysis revealed different expression profiles between HRSV and HRV infection. Five hypo-expressed genes in HRSV group-SYNGR1, AGL, LAMP2, ORM2, and SIRPB1 -are involved in neutrophil activation processes, while three genes expressing neutrophil chemoattractants-CCL15, CCL24, and LGALS3-were hyper-expressed in HRSV infection (S1 and S2 Tables). Our results indicated that the host response to HRSV, compared with HRV, are related to diminished neutrophil activation and increase neutrophil chemotaxis. This negatively (green) or positively (red) correlated is the module with the trait. Five modules presented significant association (p<0.05) with the HRSV group and these modules are indicated by black borders. Distinct PBMC transcriptional modules in the response to HRSV or HRV in bronchiolitis Distinct PBMC transcriptional modules in the response to HRSV or HRV in bronchiolitis response could well be associated to disease severity and, consequently, to longer periods of hospitalization (Table 1) . Another subset of hyper-expressed genes-OAS2, PTAFR, PML, MEFV, CCL15, and CCL24-in HRSV group is related to interferon-gamma pathway (S1 Table) . Interferon induces antiviral effectors encoding genes and exerts a protective effect [25, 26] . Moreover, the balance between pro-and anti-inflammatory T-cell cytokine responses may determine the clinical outcome of HRSV infection. High levels of IFN-gamma might reduce viral replication but increase immunopathology. However, decreased IFN-gamma response has been reported to be associated with severe HRSV infection [27] . The treatment with systemic steroids is controversial regarding the efficacy of systemic steroid use in severe bronchiolitis. Pinto et al [28] showed that infants with severe illness had higher plasma cortisol levels than infants with mild disease, and a decreased IFN-gamma production by PBMCs in severely affected infants. Nevertheless, these two molecular mechanisms-neutrophil chemotaxis and IFN-gamma/cortisol-seem to be important therapeutic targets for modulating HRSVderived immunopathologies.",
