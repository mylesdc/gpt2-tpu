The genomic regions that can faithfully provide assessments consistent with those predicted with full-length genome sequences would be preferable to serve as good candidates of the phylogenetic markers for molecular epidemiological studies of many viruses. Here we employed a statistical method to evaluate the evolutionary relationships between individual viral genes and full-length genomes without tree construction as a way to determine which gene can match the genome well in phylogenetic analyses. This method was performed by calculation of linear correlations between the genetic distance matrices of aligned individual gene sequences and aligned genome sequences. We applied this method to the phylogenetic analyses of porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2), measles virus (MV), hepatitis E virus (HEV) and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). Phylogenetic trees were constructed for comparisons and the possible factors affecting the method accuracy were also discussed in the calculations. The results revealed that this method could produce results consistent with those of previous studies about the proper consensus sequences that could be successfully used as phylogenetic markers. And our results also suggested that these evolutionary correlations could provide useful information for identifying genes that could be used effectively to infer the genetic relationships.",

            "text": "The phylogenetic analysis of viruses is a useful way to estimate their evolutionary relationships and assign genotypes. Until recently, the method commonly used for molecular phylogenetic studies for many viruses typically involved sequencing a gene or partial genomic region (phylogenetic marker) in individual representatives of a collection of strains and inferring a ''gene tree'' based on these sequences and declaring the gene tree to be the estimate of the tree of strain relationships [1] [2] [3] [4] . However, many studies have shown that the evolutionary histories of some individual genes or genomic regions may not be identical to each other within many viruses, which may be due to the recombination, reassortment and selection pressure [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Therefore, several methods such as phylogenetic networks have been developed to infer these evolutionary processes including the recombination events. However, all these analyses could only provide accurate estimates only when all the whole-genome sequences are available [13] . In a molecular epidemiological survey, it is still expensive work to sequence the genome of every strain involved especially when the viral genomes are large, despite the decreasing cost of sequencing. For many viruses, a proper marker region used for the phylogenetic analysis can be still preferable in practical applications to infer the genetic relationships despite the fact that it may sometimes give some misleading assessments ( Figure 1 ).",

All these sequences would be compared with the reference genomes curated in the GenBank and the sequences containing gaps in genomic regions would be discarded unless they were clearly confirmed by other studies. And the sequences that have been fully reported in previous studies, with clear backgrounds and well annotated genome structures were preferred. For the viral strains with conflicting sequences, the sequence meeting the above criteria described above was selected. If the whole-genome sequences of several strains were identical, only one whole-genome sequence was retained. All data were collected before 1 October, 2013. Firstly, 43 PCV2 strains, 28 MV strains, 33 HEV strains and 30 JEV strains were used in the general calculations (Table S1 and Table S2 ). To allow comparisons to be made, large sets of PCV2 sequences (123 strains and 224 strains; Text S1) were also obtained for another calculation. The genomic region sequences for each virus were obtained depending on reference genomes annotated in the NCBI. The main genes (rep and cap) of PCV2, genes coding for structural proteins (N, P, M, F, H and L) and non-structural proteins (C and V) of MV, several genomic regions (MJ-C, GO, KLY-B, MXJ and SGG-A) depending on the literature [7] from HEV and genes coding for structural proteins (E, PreM and cap) and nonstructural protein (NS1, NS2a, NS2b, NS3, NS4a, NS4b and NS5) of JEV were obtained from the selected genomes respectively. The sizes of these individual genes or genomic regions were given in Table S3 .",

However, the trend for each gene was clear enough to estimate its reliability. The r-values of some genes were high and stable (higher and shorter appearance of boxes and whiskers), whereas the rvalues of other genes were more changeable and lower (lower and longer appearance of boxes and whiskers) ( Figure 4 ). As can be seen in Figure 5 , when the r-values were calculated with five PCV2 strains, it was hard to determine which gene had higher correlation with genome because the r-values were highly variable across the different samples. However, when the sample number was greater than 10, the comparison became available with a clear trend in the r-values of the two genes. This was consistent with the results based on samples of different sizes for (Table S4 , S5, S6 and S7) the four viruses, in which the trend was significant and similar when the sample size was greater than 10.",

However, the use of different genomic regions by different laboratories makes it difficult to compare their results and can even give misleading inferences. Unlike the previous tree comparison strategies, we tried to take advantage of a statistical method as an alternative way to provide information for selecting the phylogenetic markers. This method functions like the ''mirrortree'' method, in which the similarity between trees is evaluated with a linear correlation coefficient using genetic distance matrices [23, 25] . The r-values from our calculations represented the similarities and agreed with the result from the direct comparisons of the trees (Figures 3, S1 , S2, and S3). A higher r-value between the whole genome and one individual gene means a more correlated evolutionary rate between them. This method does not require the construction of phylogenetic trees and only the underlying distance matrices are analyzed, which makes this approach independent of any given distance-based tree-construction methods.",

This is consistent with the fact that the N gene and H gene sequences are most commonly recommended for the genetic characterization of wild-type viruses [27, [34] [35] [36] . Although the L gene could reproduce the genome tree well, the large size of sequence limits its utility. For PCV2 which has the smallest genome in the circoviridae family, encoding only two major proteins (rep and cap), the cap gene correlated more strongly and more stably with the full genome than the rep gene in its evolutionary rate, which is consistent with our phylogenetic analysis based on tree comparison (Figure 3 ). This is fully supported by the study of Olvera et al [6] , who considered that the cap gene was a more reliable phylogenetic marker for PCV2 strains because it was able to reconstruct the same tree as the whole viral genome. The cap gene shows much greater variability than the rep gene, which may be due to the fact that the cap protein is the most exposed part of the virus and is the most likely to interact with the host immune system [6, 37] . In JEV, the E gene has been given precedence when there is discordance between the E and other genes because it has been shown to be a better predictor of phylogenies determined by complete genomes [9] . And the NS1 gene and NS5 gene have been also proved as good reference genes for genotypic assignment [16, 38, 39] . In this study, we found that the E and NS5 gene showed the strongest and relatively constant correlation values (0.996) with the full-length genome and the NS1 gene also show a higher r-value (0.993) with the genome (Figure 4 ). It has been known that some genomic regions for HEV genotyping can correlate well with the results from the phylogenetic analyses based on the complete genome [7, 40, 41] . The MJ-C region in the viral RdRp domain has been identified as a substitute for the full-length genome when assigning genotypes [7] . We have drawn the same conclusion as that study by calculating the evolutionary correlations between the HEV genome and the selected regions from the previous study. The MJ-C region showed the highest r-value (0.983) with the full genome, indicating the MJ-C region is evolving in a rate more correlatively with the HEV genome across all the selected regions. However, according to our results (Figure 4) , all the regions of HEV selected for our analysis, including the MJ-C region, showed unstable evolutionary correlations with the genome based on different genome samples. This may suggest that they may be inappropriate for phylogenetic analysis, which was supported by the unreliable bootstrap values in the phylogenetic trees ( Figure S3 ) and may arise partly from the limited informative sites in all the selected regions with sequences short in length.",

Our analysis of differently sized samples of viral strains, as well as random and repetitive sampling of PCV2, showed empirically that an insufficient sample size, which was less than 10, may negatively affect the stability and reliability of rvalues ( Figure 5 and Table S5 ). This may result from insufficient informative variation of each sequence for detection, the limitations of statistical method itself and/or the potential specific variability in evolutionary history. Consequently, an empirical restriction will be recommended that the minimum sample size is 10. Furthermore, no significant difference was found between the results based on a small number (43 strains) and those based on large numbers (123 and 224 strains) of PCV2 viruses. Another factor, the sample source also seemed to play an important role in the calculation for the r-values. While the r-values changed with the different selection of PCV2 strains, it had no influence on the comparison for judgment because of the clear trend between rvalues when the size of sample was sufficiently large. Sufficient information can be provided by more representative strains from different lineages. Moreover, the comparison between the results from calculations with all the selected strains ( Table 1 ) and those of several randomly selected groups with different numbers revealed that estimates from different sample sizes and sample sources ( Figure 4 and Figure 5 ) were consistent with that from one specific calculation with enough number of representative strains. Therefore, a reliable estimate can be made when the calculation is based on a sufficient number of representative strains. In practice, the rvalues would be calculated based on several groups of randomly selected strain sources with the sufficient number, which would yield a more reliable assessment.",

Our method can only give estimates of the correlated evolution level between individual genomic regions and the whole genome of some viruses and then provide the useful information for determining the proper phylogenetic markers for molecular epidemiology. More comprehensive analyses must be performed to choose one specific genome region as a phylogenetic marker.

It was difficult to determine which of the regions SGG-A, MJ-C, and MXJ generates the tree most similar to the genome tree.",
