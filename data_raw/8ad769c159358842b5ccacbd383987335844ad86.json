Some of these characteristics are expected to be related more to contact patterns than to an intrinsic capacity to transmit the virus, e.g., age-specific transmission might be more influenced by social contacts, while being vaccinated might also affect communicability by conferring some level of protection against symptoms. Because the procedure weights transmissibility by the characteristic of the infector and does not account for levels of susceptibility among contacts, the adjustment might not be applicable to factors that impact transmission as a result of a person's interactions. For this reason, due to concerns for collinearity, and because initial unadjusted results indicated differences in transmissibility were more marked based on vaccination and birth pre-vaccination, we chose to adjust our base analyses by these two factors. However, sensitivity analyses performed including more of these characteristics in the weighting procedure showed that patterns of transmissibility in more fully adjusted models were similar to those seen with our base analyses (eTables [4] [5] [6] .",

In these scenarios, the algorithm might assign these cases as a transmission pair even though it might have been an issue of underreporting. To account for this, we excluded putative transmissions outside the observed range of reported serial intervals (approximately from 6 through 18 days), 9 which was also equivalent to the central 95% confidence interval (CI) profile of the serial interval we used. Here we examine results including all putative connections (no restriction analyses). Results are shown in eTables 10-12; the base analyses results are shown for comparison. The median age is based on 2215 measles case-patients. c Measles vaccine was first licensed in the United States in 1963; persons born before 1957 are likely to have been infected naturally and are thus considered to have acceptable presumptive evidence of measles immunity in the United States. d Internationally imported cases are persons who acquired measles outside of the United States and brought their infection into the United States; i.e., they were outside the United States during their exposure period (7-21 days before rash onset), had rash onset within 21 days of entry into the United States, and had no known exposure to measles in the United States during that time. e U.S.-acquired are persons who had not been outside the United States during the 21 days before rash onset or who were known to have been exposed to measles within the United States. f Categorized as either U.S.-resident or foreign visitor (e.g., international tourists and students, new international adoptees, recent immigrants). g Of a measles-containing vaccine; doses were counted if given at least one maximum incubation period (21 days) prior to the onset of rash. h Ten measles case-patients were reported to have received three doses, two to have received four doses, and one to have received five doses of a measles-containing vaccine. i Previous studies indicate reduced antibody responses and increased susceptibility to measles when the first dose is given before 15 months of age (as opposed to when given at 15 months of age or older); the age at first dose was 6-8 months for 8 cases, 9-11 months for 6 cases, 12-14 months for 37 cases, 15-23 months for 21 cases, and 24-71 months for 19 cases. j Time since last documented dose of a measles-containing vaccine; twelve years was the median value of time since vaccination. k E.g., otitis media, diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, pneumonia, thrombocytopenia, encephalitis, and death. l Cases in a single chain of measles transmission that were not genotyped were assigned the same genotype as other cases in the chain. The duration of a chain of transmission was calculated as the difference between the dates of rash onset of the first and last cases. c Seventeen or 74% of the 23 superspreading events occurred either in the first or second day of the outbreak. d Other reported primary settings: Workplace (1), airplane (1), childcare (2), church (3), community (4) ",

The dashed lines indicate the time lag corresponding to the central 95% confidence interval of the serial interval distribution, based on the rash onset of each primary case; thus darker squares (likely primary-secondary pairings) fall within these limits.
