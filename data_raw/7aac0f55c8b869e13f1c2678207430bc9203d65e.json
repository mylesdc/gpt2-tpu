For the former application, the entire set of probes on the microarray is designed to detect the mutations in the viral genome to allow one specific viral species and its subtypes to be discerned. An example of this application is the virus microarrays for discriminating different subtypes of influenza viruses [4, 5] . For the latter application, long oligonucleotide probes (60-or 70-mers) that tolerate sequence mismatches are used for broad detection specificity to a large number of viruses. This study focuses on the latter application: uncovering the identity of viruses present in a sample rather than detecting the mutations of a specific known virus.",

The unknown or unsequenced members of existing viral families can be detected by hybridization to the microarray elements with sequence similarity. Conserved sequences were selected based only on the unidirectional relationship between one genome and the others in the same viral family. A substantial percentage of sequence redundancy exists among these family probes, and a family probe set usually contains a large number of redundant conserved probes. For virus identification, microarray data have been categorized into individual viral families and converted to a linear visualization scale (a bar-coded linear pattern) [2] or an alignment of the probe sequences giving hybridization signal intensities has been employed to determine the true identity of specific viruses [3] .",

Although long probes possess a high hybridization efficiency, they often exhibit poor discrimination of specific viruses. Therefore, significant cross-hybridization of a viral genome to the highly similar noncognate long probes is expected. Thus, identifying viral species using the previously reported viral microarray probe design strategy requires additional intensive computation to analyze the complex hybridization patterns. A software program for implementing such a virus identification strategy has been developed [8] . The program determines the identity of specific virus(es) in a test sample by comparing observed patterns of microarray hybridization intensities with a set of theoretical hybridization energy profiles as computed from the alignments of microarray oligonucleotides against all completely sequenced reference viral genomes available in the Gen-Bank database.",

Our method narrows down the computation of conserved sequences to the genus level and eliminates sequence redundancy within a viral genus probe set by considering the mutual sequence similarity among all the viral genomes in the same genus. Compared with the tiling approach, our approach greatly reduces the redundancy and number of conserved probes for a given viral genus. The method involves two separate sets of probes: (i) the conserved sequence probes for genus identification; and (ii) specific probes for viral species or stain identification. The probe set for each genus contains a panel of 70-mer oligonucleotides that not only covers all the sequenced known viruses of the genus but also maximizes the likelihood of detecting emerging or unsequenced viruses. Long 70-mer probes help to alleviate sequencedependent hybridization variation, improve hybridization efficiency, and enhance the capability of identifying unknown viruses. To compensate for the poor discrimination capability of long probes, additional species-or subtype-specific probes were designed for each fully sequenced virus to enhance the specificity of virus identification. The identity of a virus is determined based on a simple arithmetic algorithm that calculates the average signal intensity of the multiple probes for a virus, in contrast to the intensive computation needed for pattern comparisons. The use of separate genus and species probe sets facilitates a cross-examination strategy to increase the identification accuracy. The identity of a virus is established by the concordant results for both the genus-and cognate-species-specific probes.",

Figure 3A shows the computed conserved sequence segment pool with redundancy (i.e., C'(Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) ) in step 5 of the above probe design algorithm).

In Figure 3C , the column entitled \"sequenced genomes\" lists the number of viruses included for the computation in each genus, and the column entitled \"detection by cross-validation\" contains the Algorithm for designing conserved probes number of viruses detected using the in silico method for each genus. The rightmost column is the positive detection rate for the in silico method for each genus. The computation results showed that most of the computed genus probes -especially for those genera having a larger number of sequenced viral genomes -displayed a good capability of detecting novel viruses, except for the genus of lentivirus, which yielded a worse prediction outcome. This result indicates that both the number of sequenced genomes and the extent of sequence conservation of viral members in a genus are useful factors for assessing the predictive power of the computed conserved sequences. Nevertheless, the in silico cross-validation results produced an average successful detection rate of 92%, which demonstrates the feasibility of the probe design method.",

The virus genus and species identification methods are described in the Methods section. In Figure 4A , the Z-axis represents the genus signal strengths of the three genus probe sets (Y-axis) hybridized to the seven test viral samples (X-axis). The possible genus identity (or identities) of a test viral sample can be determined from the magnitude of the genus signal. Figure 4B demonstrates the determination of the identity of a specific virus. The Z-axis is the specific signal strengths of 26 virus probe sets (Y-axis) hybridized to the 7 test viral samples (X-axis). The specific identity of the test virus can be read directly from the extent of the specific signal strength in the chart. Verifying the results for the genus-specific (Fig.4A ) and cognate-species-specific (Fig. 4B) probes with virus taxonomy (i.e., the correct hierarchical genus and species association) results in the identities of all the test viruses being determined accurately and unambiguously. Figure 4 also demonstrates the use of this method for detecting emerging and unsequenced viruses. We intentionally left out EV71 sequence information in the conserved probe design process and made no EV71 species-specific probes on the test chip. However, the hybridization of EV71 to the chip resulted in a high signal intensity for the enterovirus genus probes, which clearly indicated that the virus belonged to this genus (Fig. 4A) . Moreover, as shown by the hybridization result of the mixed viral sample EV71+SARS-CoV (Fig. 4A) , the probe design method also allows two viruses of different genera to be accurately identified simultaneously. Although JEV cross-hybridized to three noncognate virus probes [ Fig. 4B for Murray Valley encephalitis virus (MEV), West Nile virus (WNV), and Louping ill virus (LIV)] that are of the same genus as flavivirus, the signal strength resulting from the specific hybridization of JEV to its probe was 5-, 30-, and 33-fold higher than that of the probes for the three other viruses, respectively. Therefore, the virus was correctly identified as JEV. All the experiments were performed at least twice. In some cases, the signal intensity of the probes varied in different experiments for the same viral sample. However, our strategy for determining identities exhibits high signal-to-background ratios (as shown in Figure 4 ) and is ",

A larger number of available sequenced viral genomes in a genus makes it easier to identify the conserved sequences of the genus, and greatly enhances the probability of detecting unknown or unsequenced members of the genus. In addition, traditional virus taxonomy is not based on viral genome sequences. Thus, in some cases, the viral genomes are highly divergent among the members of a genus, such that each computed genus probe is only similar to a small fraction of the genus members, or may even be unique. The genus of lentivirus is one example, for which a poor detection rate (55.6%) based on in-silico cross-validation of the conserved genus sequences is shown in Figure 3C .",

Therefore, accurate prediction of cross-hybridization is a prerequisite for the feasibility of the probe design method. In general, 70-80% global sequence similarity or a high local sequence similarity between two sequences could cause substantial crosshybridization [10, [14] [15] [16] . Significant cross-hybridization was reported for a nontarget 70-mer probe that had a (short) 25-bp BLASTN identity match [3] . To obtain as many reliable genus probes as possible, we used a 38-bp BLASTN sequence identity match criterion [10] in the genus probe design. This criterion was chosen to take into account both the global and the local sequence similarities in hybrid formation. Our experimental results show that the criterion reduces false-positive and -negative predictions of hybrid formation. Additionally, the number of genus probes sufficient for twofold coverage of all virus members in a genus ensures high detection accuracy in cases where the hybrid formation criterion may not apply. The experimental results shown in Figure 4 indicate that the hybrid formation criteria used in the genus probe design are sufficient to yield detectable genus probe signals to the target viruses but not to viruses of non-target genera.",

Parallel screening for a broad spectrum of uncharacterized viruses using microarray technology overcomes this limitation and also provides a means of discovering emerging new viruses. Our probe design concept employs a panel of conserved sequence probes to directly classify emerging or unsequenced viruses at the genus level, and specific probes for known virus identification in a direct-readout manner. Moreover, using the two types of probes to determine the identity of a virus in a complementary way further assures detection accuracy. The ability to detect a large variety of viruses using the virus microarray approach has great potential in facilitating the discovery of emerging viruses and diagnosing diseases of unknown etiology or patients infected with unknown or multiple simultaneous viral pathogens.",

            "text": "We developed the following identification procedure to compute the identity of a virus directly from the hybridization signals. First, to minimize nonspecific hybridization, any probe with a fluorescence signal intensity, F, satisfying the following two criteria is eligible to use in the subsequent viral identification procedure: (i) F viral sample / F blank \u2265 3 and (ii) F viral sample -F blank > 1500. To take both the number and signal intensity of probes satisfying the above criteria in a given genus probe set into consideration, the following genus signal strength (defined as a percentage) is used to determine the viral genus identity: Sum(F e | G )/ (Sum(F e | G )), where F e | G represents the hybridization intensity of any eligible genus probe in a genus G, Sum(F e | G ) is the sum of all the F e | G in G, and (Sum(F e | G )) represents the maximum value of Sum(F e | G ) among all the viral genera represented on a microarray. The viral genus identity in a test sample is assigned to the genus with the highest genus signal strength (i.e., 100%). The presence of multiple viruses of different genera in a sample will result in a nonzero genus signal strength. We then score and rank the possible virus identities in the specific probe region on the basis of the specific signal strength, defined as the average signal intensity of the multiple probes for a given virus divided by the maximum average signal intensity of the multiple probes for every virus represented on a microarray (expressed as a percentage). As for the genus determination method, the presence of multiple viruses in the sample will result in a nonzero signal strength. Finally, the identity of the virus is established by the concordant results for both the genusand cognate-species-specific probes.",
