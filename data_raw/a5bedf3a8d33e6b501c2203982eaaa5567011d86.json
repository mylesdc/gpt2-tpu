The animals, six weeks old and clinically healthy, were inoculated with the virulent strain Margarita (secondary virus). For exclusive detection of the Margarita strain, a specific qRT-PCR assay was designed, which proved not to have crossreactivity with the Cat01 strain. The wild boars persistently infected with CSFV were protected from superinfection by the virulent CSFV Margarita strain, as evidenced by the absence of clinical signs and the absence of Margarita RNA detection in serum, swabs and tissue samples. Additionally, in PBMCs, a well-known target for CSFV viral replication, only the primary infecting virus RNA (Cat01 strain) could be detected, even after the isolation in ST cells, demonstrating SIE at the tissue level in vivo. Furthermore, the data analysis of the Margarita qRT-PCR, by means of calculated \u0394Ct values, supported that PBMCs from persistently infected animals were substantially protected from superinfection after in vitro inoculation with the Margarita virus strain, while this virus was able to infect naive PBMCs efficiently. In parallel, IFN-\u03b1 values were undetectable in the sera from animals in Group B after inoculation with the CSFV Margarita strain. Furthermore, these animals were unable to elicit adaptive humoral (no E2-specific or neutralising antibodies) or cellular immune responses (in terms of IFN-\u03b3-producing cells) after inoculation with the second virus. Finally, a sequence analysis could not detect CSFV Margarita RNA in the samples tested from Group B. Our results suggested that the SIE phenomenon might be involved in the evolution and phylogeny of the virus, as well as in CSFV control by vaccination. To the best of our knowledge, this study was one of the first showing efficient suppression of superinfection in PLOS ONE |",

Classical swine fever virus (CSFV) is the etiological agent of a highly contagious viral disease of swine affecting domestic pigs and wild boars [1] , which has caused major losses in stock farming [2, 3] . CSFV is composed of a lipid envelope, a capsid and a single plus-strand RNA genome carrying a single, large open reading frame (ORF) flanked by two untranslated regions (UTRs). The ORF encodes a polyprotein of approximately 3900 amino acids, which are processed by cellular and viral proteases in the four structural proteins-C, E rns , E1, E2-and in the 8 non-structural proteins-N pro , P7, NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B [4] .",

Over the six weeks after postnatal infection, most of the infected animals remained clinically healthy, despite persistent high virus titres in the blood, organs and body secretions. Importantly, these animals were unable to mount any detectable humoral or cellular immune responses. At necropsy, the most prominent gross pathological lesion was severe thymus atrophy. Four weeks after infection, PBMCs from persistently infected seronegative piglets were unresponsive to both specific CSFV and non-specific PHA stimulation in terms of IFN-\u03b3-producing cells. These results suggested the development of an immunosuppression state in these postnatally persistently infected pigs [5, 6] . In addition, it was shown that six-week-old, persistently CSFV-infected pigs were unable to elicit specific immune responses following vaccination with a CSFV lapinised C-strain vaccine (HCLV) [7] . Interestingly, the RNA of the vaccinal C-strain was undetectable by specific RT-PCR [8] in any of the samples analysed after vaccination, including blood, nasal and rectal swabs, or organs throughout the experiment, suggesting a phenomenon of homologous interference, also known as superinfection exclusion (SIE), between the high viral load generated by the primary persistent infection and the CSFV vaccine strain.",

From an evolutionary standpoint, SIE might be a conservative strategy, reducing the likelihood of recombination events between related strains [17, 21, 22] , thus determining the stability of viral sequences within the same cell. From a practical standpoint, SIE has significant implications for the treatment or prevention of viral infections. In this regard, cross-protection of crops by purposeful infection with milder virus isolates is a widely accepted practice, and it is viewed as an effective and economical antiviral management strategy [23] . Additionally, transplantation of HCV-infected liver grafts has been suggested as a treatment for already infected patients, given that the transplantation of a healthy organ would lead to rapid damage to the newly transplanted liver by the virus of the recipient patient [15, 24] .",

Additionally, it was shown that CSFV is generally noncytopathic, and it readily establishes persistent infections in cell culture. Nevertheless, when persistently infected cultures were serially passaged more than 100 times, spontaneous generation of cytopathogenic (cp) CSFV variants could occur. The few surviving cells of the cytopathic effect (CPE), although still infected, were also protected from the CPE after superinfection with cp CSFV [25] . Both studies supported the ability of pestiviruses to generate SIE in cell cultures. Thus, along with the availability of a persistent infection model of CSFV, in the present study, we sought to assess SIE against a highly virulent CSFV strain at the organism level in six-week-old wild boars, rendered persistently CSFV-infected at birth. Our results showed that SIE could occur at the systemic level in CSFV-infected swine.",

These animals were acquired from Gestion Cinegetica Integral SL farm (Segovia, Spain) and were housed in the experimental isolation facilities in the biosecurity level 3 laboratory of the Centre de Recerca en Sanitat Animal (CReSA); they were fed a conventional piglet starter diet and pellets until the end of the trial (Startrite 100, Kwikstart, and Prestarter; SCA Iberica S.A., Zaragoza, Spain) and were handled according to previous studies conducted in CReSA [6] . Group A (animals 1 to 3) was used as controls, and they tested Pestivirus-free at the beginning of the study. The second group (Group B), housed in an independent isolation unit at the BSL-3 facility of CReSA, (animals 4 to 6), were postnatally persistently CSFV-infected animals. These animals, which had been intranasally infected in the first 24 h after birth with the CSFV Cat01 strain, were viraemic and apparently healthy at six weeks old, although being immunosuppressed, they lacked CSFV-specific cellular and humoral responses [5, 6] . Both groups had an average weight of 6 kg per animal. After a five-day acclimation period, all of the animals were experimentally infected by i.m. injection in the neck [33] [34] [35] with 10 5 TCID 50 CSFV Margarita strain. In previous studies, this viral dose caused acute CSF and often induced death at 10-15 days post-infection (dpi) [36] . Sera and nasal and rectal swabs were collected at 0, 3, 7, 10 and 13 dpi. Blood samples for the isolation of PBMCs were obtained at day 0 and at the time of euthanasia.",

Particular stress was placed upon the registration of nervous symptoms [29, 33, 34, 36] . The clinical status of the animals was scored from 0 to 6 [29, 33, 34, 36] as follows: 0: no signs; 1: mild pyrexia; 2: pyrexia plus mild clinical signs; 3: mild-to-moderate clinical signs; 4: moderate clinical signs; 5: moderate-to-severe clinical signs; and 6: death. For ethical reasons, the animals were euthanised when the clinical score reached 5, when exhibiting a fall of the hindquarters, when there was inability to drink or feed, when prostration occurred or when exhibiting moderate nervous disorders. After euthanasia, an exhaustive necropsy was conducted, in which the presence of pathological symptoms in different organs and tissues was evaluated. Surviving wild boars were euthanised at 13 dpi, and urine and tissues (spleen, liver, intestine, mesenteric lymph node, prescapular lymph node, bone marrow, medulla oblongata, lung, kidney, thymus and tonsil) were obtained at necropsy. Euthanasia was performed according to European Directive 2010/63/EU, using a pentobarbital overdose of 60-100 mg/kg administered via the anterior vena cava. The animal care and procedures were in accordance with the guidelines of the Good Experimental Practices (GEP), under the supervision of the Ethical and Animal Welfare Committee of the Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB), and they were approved under number 8804, according to the existing national and European regulations. Additionally, the biosafety level of the viruses used in this study was stated as biosecurity level 3, as approved by the Biosafety Committee of the UAB, with registration assignment AR-296-15.",

Two primers and probes were designed for specific detection of the Margarita strain sequence (1.4 CSFV genogroup) by targeting the 5\u00b4end of the E2 gene, as follows: forward primer (2333-2356), 5\u00b4-AAGATTACGACCACAATTTACAAC-3\u00b4; reverse primer (2411-2431), 5\u00b4-TCC TACTGACCACATTAAGCG-3\u00b4and probe (2369-2389), 5\u00b4-CCATCAAGGCTATCTGCACGG-3\u00b4. The nucleotide positions were based on the genome sequence of the Margarita strain (GenBank accession number AJ704817). The probe was labelled with 6-FAM at the 5\u00b4end and with BHQ1 at the 3\u00b4end. The primers and probe were purified by reverse phase HPLC. The one-step RT-PCR protocol was undertaken using the commercially available TaqMan1 One-Step RT-PCR Master Mix Reagents Kit (Applied Biosystems Roche). The real-time RT-PCR assay was optimised using a total volume of 25 \u03bcl. Real-time qRT-PCR was performed using an Applied Biosystems1 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System. The temperature profile was 30 min at 50\u00b0C (reverse transcription), 15 min at 95\u00b0C (inactivation reverse transcriptase/activation Taq polymerase), followed by 42 cycles of 15 s at 94\u00b0C (denaturation), 30 s at 57\u00b0C (annealing) and 30 s at 68\u00b0C (elongation). Identical temperature profiles were used for all of the real-time RT-PCR runs, and fluorescence values were collected during the annealing step. Twenty CSFV RNA preparations strains were used to determine the specificity and sensitivity of the assay (Table 1) [30, 38] . To exclude the possibility of presence of CSFV Cat01 strain RNA interfering with the assay sensitivity for the CSFV Margarita strain RNA detection, mixtures from serial RNA dilutions from both viral strains were analysed. In addition, mixtures from RNA serum samples of group B (prior to the Margarita strain inoculation), with samples from group A at 7 days post-infection with the Margarita strain, were analysed. initial sample volume of 150 \u03bcL to obtain a final volume of 50 \u03bcL of RNA, which was stored at -80\u00b0C. The presence of CSFV RNA in the serum and in nasal and rectal swabs, as well as in tissue samples, was analysed by a generic CSFV qRT-PCR [39] . This test was used in our laboratory for inter-laboratory comparisons of CSFV diagnoses, organised by the EU Reference Laboratory. Positive results were considered for threshold cycle values (Ct) equal to or less than 42. Samples in which fluorescence was undetectable were considered negative. Additionally, the qRT-PCR specific for the Margarita strain, designed in this work (described above), was used to distinguish those samples infected with the Margarita strain.",

Consequently, to examine whether the PBMCs collected from the CSFV-superinfected animals (group B) and the acutely infected animals (group A), were permissive (or not) to CSFV superinfection, we assayed in vitro inoculation of such samples, with either Cat01 or Margarita CSFV strains. Similarly, PBMC samples were mock-infected. Additionally, PBMCs from a na\u00efve animal were used as controls. As was expected, CSFV-specific Margarita RNA was detected in the PBMCs from animals developing the CSF acute disease (group A) in both mock and Margarita-infected samples. Furthermore, PBMCs from group B in vitro inoculated with Margarita were also positive for CSFV-specific Margarita RNA detection, but with a high Ct value correlated with a lower RNA load (Table 3) . Otherwise, PBMCs from group B in vitro mock-infected were negative for CSFV-specific Margarita RNA detection (Table 3) . Following these findings, to decipher whether the detected RNA load in group B might correspond to RNA traces from the inocula or to the infecting virus, the previously analysed PBMC extracts were inoculated into a ST cell line. Consistently, the detected RNA load notably increased in ST after inoculation with the extract from Margarita in vitro inoculated-na\u00efve PBMCs; the obtained 7.76\u0394 Ct positive value confirmed the infectivity of the virus recovered from the PBMC samples. In contrast, Margarita RNA in group B in vitro mock-infected PBMCs remained undetectable even after ST inoculation. Furthermore, Margarita RNA load detection in group B in vitro Margarita-infected PBMC samples decreased after inoculation of ST cells, corresponding to higher Ct values than those previously detected directly from PBMC extracts.",

Despite the important role that neutralising antibodies play in CSFV protection [29, 54] , complete absence of neutralising antibodies response was found after Margarita strain infection in these animals. Similarly, absence of an IFN-\u03b3-producing cell response against CSFV or PHA was also observed. Considering the role played by IFN-\u03b3 in the control of CSFV infection [34, 55] and the lack of responsiveness to IFN-\u03b3-producing cells after PHA stimulation, the CSFV-superinfected animals maintained a immunosuppression state similar to that previously described in postnatal persistent infection [5, 6] . Previous work has proved how the failure to induce optimal levels of the humoral and cellular responses after CSFV infection promoted the spread of the virus and its relationship with disease progression [29, 54] .

At the same time, the progression of the acute disease in group A was correlated with an increase in levels of endogenous IFN-\u03b1, as has been previously described [29, 46, 56, 57] . The absence of an IFN-\u03b1 response in the Cat01 persistently infected animals after Margarita strain inoculation (secondary infection) probably was due to the almost complete lack of Margarita strain replication in these animals. Otherwise, specific CSFV-blockade phenomena for IFN-\u03b1 might be occurring. Efficient viral strategies to escape the type I IFN-induced antiviral mechanisms have been described within Pestivirus. In this regard, the viral RNA triggers IFN synthesis, and the viral RNase E rns inhibits IFN expression induced by extracellular viral RNA [58] . In addition, the viral protein N pro suppresses type I IFN (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2) induction by mediating proteasomal degradation of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) [58] [59] [60] . For instance, in persistent infection, BVDV maintains \"self-tolerance\" by avoiding the induction of IFN, without compromising the IFN action against unrelated viruses (\"nonself\") [58] . In the case of CSFV-infected pigs, it has been recently demonstrated that functional N pro significantly reduced local IFN-\u03b1 mRNA expression responses at local sites of virus replication [61] . These highly selective \"self\" models of evasion of the interferon defence system might be key elements in the success of persistent infections and could promote, in addition, the generation of SIE phenomena.",

These results suggest that SIE still occurs at the tissue level (Table 3 ).

Nevertheless, the colonisation of a multi-cellular host is a complex process during which the viral load can dramatically change in different organs and at different stages of the infection, and not all of the potential target cells are infected in persistently infected animals despite the high viral load generated by the Cat01 CSFV strain in persistently infected animals [5, 6] . Illustrative examples include some of the works performed to demonstrate SIE at the cellular level because some cells uninfected by one viral primary infection are subsequently infected by the second viral infection [11, 50] . In contrast, the implications of other mechanisms in the host cannot be excluded, and it remains unclear whether the observed phenomenon is really due to a blockage at the level of infection of cells. This was precisely in the case of a citrus tristeza virus (CTV) SIE model, wherein a CTV protein (p33) was required to mediate SIE at the organism level but that did not appear to be implicated in exclusion at the cellular level [50] .",
