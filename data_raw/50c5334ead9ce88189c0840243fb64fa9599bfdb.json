            "text": "The prevalence of bacterial and viral infections is setting dependent. For example, in the winter, a pediatrician in the outpatient setting is expected to encounter substantially more viral infections than a physician in the hospital internal department during the summer. Notably, some measures of diagnostic accuracy such as AUC, sensitivity, and specificity are invariant to the underlying prevalence, whereas other measures of accuracy, such as PPV and NPV are prevalence dependent. In this section, we review the expected signature performance in terms of PPV and NPV in clinical settings with different prevalence of bacterial and viral infections.",
