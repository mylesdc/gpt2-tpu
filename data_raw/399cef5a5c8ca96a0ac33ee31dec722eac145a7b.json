We herein constructed an effective metagenomic method for RNA viruses by targeting long double-stranded (ds)RNA in cellular organisms, which is a hallmark of infection, or the replication of dsRNA and single-stranded (ss)RNA viruses, except for retroviruses. This novel dsRNA targeting metagenomic method is characterized by an extremely high recovery rate of viral RNA sequences, the retrieval of terminal sequences, and uniform read coverage, which has not previously been reported in other metagenomic methods targeting RNA viruses. This method revealed a previously unidentified viral RNA diversity of more than 20 complete RNA viral genomes including dsRNA and ssRNA viruses associated with an environmental diatom colony. Our approach will be a powerful tool for cataloging RNA viruses associated with organisms of interest.",

Historically, viruses are most often recognized as pathogens (38) , and, thus, have been studied in the field of medical and crop science. Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies have enabled us to identify not only viruses associated with diseases, but also those present in natural environments including oceans (41) and soil (12) . Although these sequencing technologies have opened a new era in virus identification (24) , a limited number of methods have been established for virus enrichment and library construction. The diversity and distribution of viruses in non-viral nucleic acid-dominant environments, such as the intracellular environments in which viruses actually replicate, still remain unclear due to technical difficulties (16) . The development of a new procedure for effective virus enrichment and library construction is required in order to understand the full spectrum of diverse viruses.",

Purification and library construction methods have been established for RNA viruses at the extracellular stage (7, 10, 40) . However, the viral read ratio of intracellular RNA viruses (RNA viruses at the intracellular stage) in the RNA-seq library is typically < 1% because mRNA and rRNA are dominant in the total RNA fraction extracted from biological samples (25) . Therefore, the enrichment of viral RNA is essential for maximizing sensitivity in the identification of novel viruses. The physical enrichment of viral particles and nuclease digestion of non-viral nucleotides has been employed to increase the viral read ratio; however, a relatively low abundance of viral reads is still observed in most studies (39) . These techniques are only applicable to specific RNA viruses because not all RNA viruses form viral particles (21) . In addition, difficulties are associated with capturing terminal RNA sequences in an efficient and effective manner (32) and obtaining uniform coverage using the RNA-seq method. Sample preparation methods for effective viral RNA-seq are still inadequate and the sequence information generated is biased and incomplete.",

            "text": "In an attempt to resolve these issues, an environmental viral metagenomic approach targeting intracellular long doublestranded RNA (dsRNA) has recently been examined (2, 6, 9, 37) . Intracellular dsRNA consists of the genomes of dsRNA viruses and replicative intermediates of single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses, and, thus, long dsRNA is known as an RNA virus-specific molecule and molecular marker for RNA virus infection and replication (28) . Therefore, a metagenomic analysis targeting intracellular long dsRNA theoretically retrieves dsRNA and ssRNA viruses, except for ssRNA retroviruses, which do not form dsRNA in the replicative stage. In addition, it is possible to eliminate non-viral nucleic acids such as mRNA and rRNA, which dominate RNA-seq reads, by DNase I, S1 nuclease, RNase, or column chromatography (44) . However, previous studies have reported technical issues with the purification of dsRNA and library construction. Random priming for the reverse transcription of dsRNA does not enable the terminal sequences of the dsRNA molecule to be determined or eliminate significant contamination by non-viral sequences. The heterogeneous sequencing depth in certain viral genome segments is also an issue associated with this method (2, 6, 9, 37) . Although the full-length cDNAs of dsRNA viruses may be obtained using loop primers that are ligated to the dsRNA terminal ends for reverse transcription (8) , this method is only useful for short dsRNA viruses. Therefore, to the best of our knowledge, this method has not yet been applied to a viral metagenomic analysis.",

After excess and hybrid RNAs were removed (34) , cDNA was desalted and concentrated using the MinElute PCR cleanup kit (Qiagen). Primary cDNA strands were re-annealed by lowering the temperature from 95 to 50\u00b0C, as described previously (30) . Second strand DNA polymerization was performed using KOD-plus Neo (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) with a primer complementary to the partial sequence of the PC3-T7 loop primer, PC2 (5\u2032-CCG AAT TCC CGG GAT CC-3\u2032) (34) . After heat activation of KOD-plus Neo in the reaction mixture provided at 96\u00b0C for 2 min, template cDNA was added and incubated at 68\u00b0C for 5 min. After the reaction, cDNA was amplified under the following conditions: 96\u00b0C for 2 min, 25 (for MoCV1-A) or 18 (for diatom colony) cycles of 98\u00b0C for 10 s, and 68\u00b0C for 2 min. Small cDNA and primer dimers were removed using the 1.25 \u00d7 SPRIselect reagent kit (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) according to the Left Side Size Selection procedure in the manufacturer's protocol.",

Purified dsRNAs were fragmented using ultrasound to retrieve all types of dsRNA viruses in order to apply the previously reported full-length dsRNA cloning method using a loop primer (8) . The full-length dsRNA cloning method requires overlapped cDNAs synthesized from both terminal ends for further cDNA amplification, and was only applicable to short dsRNA molecules. Reverse transcription was initiated from the ligated loop primer on both ends of the dsRNA fragment. cDNA was then thermally denatured to allow annealing of single-stranded cDNA with the complementary sequence in the 3\u2032 terminal region. The single-stranded regions of annealed cDNA were filled in with DNA polymerase. The doublestranded cDNA derived from dsRNA was amplified by PCR with a single primer (PC2) in order to obtain sufficient cDNA to construct a sequencing library.",

The results of the sequencing analysis indicated that 99.1% of total reads were derived from the MoCV1-A genome (Table S1 ). Five contigs obtained by de novo assembly were identical to the entire region of the MoCV1-A genome segments attained using a conventional cloning and sequencing method (44, 45) with > 99.9% identity (Table S2) . Read mapping on MoCV1-A genomes (Fig. S2) showed that the sequence coverage of terminal regions was generally higher than that of the central regions of each segment with few exceptions. No obvious relationship was observed between read coverage and GC content (Fig. S2) .

Since ssRNA viruses form an RNA duplex as an intermediate in genome replication, these contigs were most likely derived from replicating ssRNA viruses (11) and not from contaminant ssRNA. An additional seven full-length viral segments with predicted CDSs were also identified; however, we were unable to determine the combination of their segments or reconstruct viral genomes based on information from previously reported viruses.

FLDS also had apparent advan-tages in uniform read coverage and efficiency for retrieving terminal sequences (Fig. 4) . Sequence reads for ssRNA viruses in FLDS were also more abundant than when RNAseq was used for four out of five ssRNA contigs. In addition, by de novo assembly, only six partial viral contigs were obtained using RNA-seq, and no viral contigs specific for total RNA-seq were found. Accordingly, we concluded that FLDS is more efficient than total RNA-seq for the detection and identification of RNA viruses, with the exception of retroviruses, which theoretically cannot be identified using FLDS.",

            "text": "A phylogenetic analysis of viral RNA replicases (RNAdependent RNA polymerase; RdRp) presented the phylogenetic relationship between viral genomes from a diatom colony and known RNA viruses (Fig. S4) . Viruses belonging to the family Totiviridae harbor non-segmented dsRNA genomes and form isometric virions that infect either fungi or protozoa (21) . Thirteen composite genomes of Totiviridaerelated viruses were identified and classified into four clades distinct from the five characterized genera of Totiviridae (clades a-d in Fig. S4A ). Clade c was the sister clade of the proposed genus \"Trichomonasvirus\" and clade d included Ustilaginoidea virens RNA virus 1 (UvRV1). In general, -1 ribosomal frameshift signals [the XXXYYYZ motif (4), in which XXX may be any three identical nucleotides, YYY may be either AAA or UUU, and Z may be A, U, or C] or +1 ribosomal frameshift signals [CCCUUUU (14) or UCCUUUCGU (47)] were located in the upstream region of the 2 nd CDS, and were used in the expression of overlapping viral genes such as the pol (RdRp) of Totivirus and Leishmaniavirus. These regions were examined in an attempt to better classify the identified viruses. However, as in the case of UvRV1, -1 or +1 ribosomal frameshift signals were not found in any of the Totiviridae genomes obtained in this study. CDSs in the predicted Totiviridae virus-like segments DCAVLRS-3 and DCAVLRS-4 showed significant similarities with the gag (coat protein; CP) and pol (RdRp) of known totiviruses, respectively. Totiviridae genomes consist of a single genome segment that encodes the two essential CDSs, whereas DCAVLRS-3 and -4 lacked pol and gag, respectively. These two segments harbored nine identical 5\u2032-terminal nucleotide sequences, which were distinguishable from the other identified terminal viral sequences. Genomic features implied that DCAVLRS-3 and -4 may be parts of a bisegmented viral genome. RdRp in DCADSRV-1 segment 2 showed significant homology with that in fox Picobirnavirus, a member of the Picobirnaviridae, although DCADSRV-1 was phylogenetically distinct from the known Picobirnaviridae viruses (Fig. S4B) . Picobirnaviruses are small, non-enveloped, bisegmented dsRNA viruses that infect animals and humans (21) . The genome structure of DCADSRV-1 was similar to that of the known Picobirnaviridae (21) . DCADSRV-14 was classified into the genus Deltapartitivirus of the family Partitiviridae based on the predicted RdRp sequence (Fig.  S4C) (29) . To date, all of the alphacryptoviruses have been identified from plants including the angiosperm, gymnosperm, and chlorophytes (29) . rRNA sequences belonging to the Streptophyta, including land plants, have not yet been detected by an RNA-seq analysis, whereas Cladophora sp. of the Chlorophyta, a sister division of Streptophyta, were detected (Table S4 ). The CDSs of DCADSRV-15 and a few viral contigs showed significant homology with viruses belonging to the Endornaviridae (dsRNA), Naranviridae (ssRNA), or Hypoviridae (ssRNA), whose virion formation has not yet been observed.",

The presence of multiple UGA codons suggested that the putative coding strand of DCASSRV-2 was likely to be translated in mitochondria.

Among the RNA viral genomes obtained in this study, some dominant populations showed greater similarities to fungal viruses than to known diatom viruses; however, several ssDNA and ssRNA viruses have already been identified from marine diatoms (20, 43) . We cannot exclude the possibility that these viral genomes were derived from fungi associated with a diatom colony, but it is more likely that they came from the major components of a diatom colony because of their high abundance in the RNA viral metagenomic library. Since extracellular viral particles have been a major target of virus surveillance and isolation, information on intracellular viruses in microorganisms is very limited (13, 37) . Therefore, the accumulation of knowledge on intracellular RNA viruses infecting diverse host organisms is essential for understanding the evolution and distribution of RNA viruses. FLDS revealed 22 full-length and some partial composite viral RNA genomes associated with a diatom colony by de novo assembly. These were classified into five dsRNA (Totiviridae, Endornaviridae, Picobirnaviridae, Cystoviridae, and Partitiviridae) and four ssRNA (Flaviviridae, Narnaviridae, Virgaviridae, and Hypoviridae) virus families. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest number of full-length genome sequences of novel RNA viruses identified in one metagenomic library. The viral RNA community successfully detected in this study consisted of dsRNA viruses with or without virion formation and ssRNA viruses detected as replicative intermediates. Our results suggest that FLDS has the potential to detect a wide range of RNA viruses, excluding retroviruses.",

            "text": "Several studies have been performed using metagenomic analyses targeting dsRNA with Next-Generation Sequencing technology. In these studies, viral read abundance reached a maximum of 52.7% (2) . In contrast, FLDS provided extremely high viral read abundance. The improvement in viral read rates with FLDS was likely derived from [1] a combination of repeating cellulose powder column chromatography and subsequent enzymatic treatment, [2] the fragmentation and efficient thermal denaturation of dsRNA prior to cDNA synthesis, and [3] the selective duplex formation of dsRNA-derived cDNA prior to PCR amplification. Furthermore, FLDS also presented advantages in reconstructing complete genome sequences including terminal regions, which are difficult to obtain using RNA-seq and random priming methods (3). The complete sequences of viral RNA segments are beneficial for the identification of RNA virus segments, particularly in cases in which coding CDSs did not show significant similarities with viral CDSs in databases. The application of a fulllength dsRNA cloning method using a PC3-T7 loop primer (8) to fragmented dsRNA enabled us to determine the terminal regions of long dsRNA genomes. Since T4 RNA ligase requires a 5\u2032 phosphoryl-terminated nucleic acid donor (PC3-T7 loop primer) and 3\u2032 hydroxyl-terminated nucleic acid acceptor for ligation activity, dsRNA fragments with 3\u2032 terminal phosphate were not used as substrates. The terminal structures of dsRNA fragmented by ultrasound have not been reported. However, in the case of dsDNA fragmented by ultrasound, double-strand breaks occur preferentially in 5\u2032-CpG-3\u2032 dinucleotides, and the phosphate group is at the 5\u2032 side of G in the products (15) . In this study, fragmented dsRNAs were successfully converted into cDNA and amplified. Taking this into consideration, dsRNA fragmentation using ultrasound with Covaris S220 also produced 3\u2032 hydroxylterminated fragments. Furthermore, the lack of any modifications to the 3\u2032 hydroxyl-terminal of viral RNA genomes (21) also allowed us to retrieve the terminal regions of the RNA viral genome.",
