Extensive use of acyclovir (ACV) results in the development of drug-resistant HSV strains, hence, there is an urgent need to develop new drugs to treat HSV infection. Houttuynia cordata (H. cordata), a natural herbal medicine, has been reported to exhibit anti-HSV effects which is partly NF-\u03baB-dependent. However, the molecular mechanisms by which H. cordata inhibits HSV infection are not elucidated thoroughly. Here, we report that H. cordata water extracts (HCWEs) inhibit the infection of HSV-1, HSV-2, and acyclovirresistant HSV-1 mainly via blocking viral binding and penetration in the beginning of infection. HCWEs also suppress HSV replication. Furthermore, HCWEs attenuate the first-wave of NF-\u03baB activation, which is essential for viral gene expressions. Further analysis of six compounds in HCWEs revealed that quercetin and isoquercitrin inhibit NF-\u03baB activation and additionally, quercetin also has an inhibitory effect on viral entry. These results indicate that HCWEs can inhibit HSV infection through multiple mechanisms and could be a potential lead for development of new drugs for treating HSV.",

HSV-1 can infect the oral mucosa, eyes, nasal mucosa, oropharynx, and nervous system and may cause severe complications including blindness, atypical pneumonia, aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, and even death [1] [2] [3] . HSV-2 is commonly transmitted through the sexual route potentially causing meningitis and encephalitis [4] . Most HSV infections are asymptomatic, but serious systemic symptoms are more often seen in neonates and immune-compromised individuals [5, 6] . The incidence and severity of HSV infections in immunocompromised patients has shown an upward trend in recent years [7] [8] [9] . HSV infections are commonly treated with nucleoside analogues such as acyclovir (ACV) and pencyclovir and certain highly bioavailable prodrugs such as valacyclovir and famciclovir [10, 11] . However, these drugs might promote viral mutations leading to drug-resistant HSVs. About 5% of clinical HSV isolates from immunocompromised patients is ACV-resistant [12] . There is an urgent need to develop new drugs against HSV infection.",

            "text": "HSV entry into host cells is divided into three stages [13] . First, viral glycoprotein B (gB) and gC attach to the surface glycosaminoglycans of host cells [14] . Next, gD post-binds to heparin sulfate and other receptors. In the last step, the viral envelope fuses to the plasma membrane of the host cells and penetrates into the cells. Besides blockage of viral entry, another strategy for developing anti-HSV drugs is to regulate the viral gene expression [15] . HSV viral genes are classified into three clusters in the lytic cycle [16] . HSV immediate-early (IE) genes, ICP0, ICP4, ICP22, ICP27, and ICP47, essential for the viral lytic cycle, are first transcribed and responsible for early (E) and late (L) viral gene expressions after viral entry. Certain cellular factors such as OCT1, early growth response 1, and NF-\u03baB are activated after viral penetration and further promote the viral lytic cycle by regulating the expression of viral IE genes [17] [18] [19] . NF-\u03baB is recruited onto viral ICP0 promoter to accelerate viral replication in HSV-1 lytic cycle [17] . Thus, modulation of the expression of viral IE genes or cellular factors might shed light on development of therapeutic strategies for HSV infections.",

Importantly, some studies have reported that compounds derived from Chinese medicine could block the replication of HSV [21, 22] . N-docosanol, a long chained alcohol, has anti-HSV activity and was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a topical treatment for herpes simplex labialis [21] .

Many studies revealed the inhibitory effects of H. cordata on viral infections, such as HSV, influenza virus, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), and SARS-CoV [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] . Besides anti-viral activities, H. cordata also has anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, and anti-oxidative activities [30, 31] . The major components of H. cordata include phenolic compounds, flavones, and alkaloids. The flavonoid components such as quercetin, isoquercitrin, rutin, hyperin, and quercitrin exhibit antioxidant, antimutagenic and free radical scavenging capacity. The phenolic parts including chlorogenic acid have antipyretic and antibiotic activity [32, 33] .",

However, the molecular mechanisms involved in anti-HSV activity of HCWEs are not thoroughly explored yet. Whether HCWEs execute the inhibitory activity through targeting virus particles, affecting cellular components or both is still unclear. However, the understanding of mechanism-of-action (MOA) and identification of targets are the most critical requisites in new drug development. In this study, we focused on elucidating MOA of HCWEs in addition to suppressing NF-\u03baB activation and identifying the effective component of HCWEs against HSV infection.",

These studies shed light on a new direction for development of anti-HSV drugs, however, the MOA is not well understood. Before we performed this study we first measured the anti-HSV activity of HCWEs because the activity may be different from previous reports due to the different sources of H. cordata and different extraction procedures [27, 28] . The cytotoxicity of HCWEs was measured by MTT assays. Vero cells were treated with serial dilutions of HCWEs at 37\u00b0C for 72 hours. As shown in S1 Table, HCWEs showed low cytotoxicity on Vero cells (CC 50 was greater than 100 mg/ml). Next, the anti-HSV activity of HCWEs was determined by the plaque reduction assay. The results indicated that EC 50 of HCWEs against HSV-1, Acyclovir-resistant HSV-1 (HSV-AR) and HSV-2 were 0.692 mg/ml, 1.11 mg/ml and 0.3 mg/ml, respectively (S1 Table) . Intriguingly, the EC 50 of HCWEs against HSV-AR was similar to that against wild-type HSV virus, and this fact implied that the antiviral mechanisms of HCWEs and ACV might be different. The selective index (SI) scores of HCWEs to HSV-1, HSV-AR, and HSV-2 were 144.51, 90.09, and 333.33 respectively. The inhibitory effects of ACV on HSV were also analyzed, and the EC 50 of ACV against HSV-1, HSV-AR, and HSV-2 were 0.74 mg/ml, 14.02 mg/ml, and 0.82 mg/ml respectively (S1 Table) . We demonstrated self-prepared HCWEs used here could inhibit HSV infection as previous reports [27, 28] .",

The pretreated Vero cells showed no obviously inhibitory effect on HSV-1 infection at a concentration of 10 mg/ml (S1 Fig.) , which is 14 times higher than its EC 50 (0.692 mg/ml). However, in the cases of HSV-1, HSV-2, and even HSV-AR pretreated with 0.01 mg/ml HCWEs, the plaque formation was largely inhibited (Fig. 1A) . These results implied that the anti-HSV effects of HCWEs might target virus particles directly and inhibit further stages of HSV infection. To examine this hypothesis, HCWEs-pretreated HSV-1 and HSV-2 were incubated with Vero cells at 4\u00b0C to allow virus to bind onto cells but not penetrate the cells. The unbound viruses were washed out with PBS, and the cell-bound viruses were analyzed by Western blot analysis.

To characterize the inhibitory mechanism of HCWEs and further identify which stage HCWEs act, the effects of HCWEs on viral binding and penetration were investigated separately. Vero cells were first cooled to 4\u00b0C and infected with viruses in presence of various concentrations of HCWEs for 2 hours. The unbound viruses and HCWEs were washed out with PBS, and the cell-bound viruses were then analyzed by plaque assays. As shown in Fig. 2A , HCWEs inhibited HSV-1, HSV-2, and HSV-AR binding ability in a dose-dependent manner. 0.1 mg/ml HCWEs inhibited 93.27%, 78.65%, and 92.44% of HSV-1, HSV-2, and HSV-AR plaque formation, respectively. ACV was served as a negative control because ACV is a guanosine analogue but does not block viral entry. The results indicated that the plaque formation was not obviously inhibited in the ACV-treated group. In addition to viral binding, we also examined whether HCWEs could influence viral penetration into host cells or not. Vero cells were cooled to 4\u00b0C and incubated with virus for 2 hours. The unbound viruses were washed out with PBS, and the cells were then incubated with HCWEs at 37\u00b0C for viral penetration. After 10 minutes of incubation, neutralization buffer was added to inactivate non-penetrated viruses and the viruspenetrated cells were analyzed by plaque assays. The percentages of inhibition on HSV-1, HSV-2, and HSV-AR penetration at a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml HCWEs were 93.62%, 97.76%, and 97.99%, respectively (Fig. 2B) . To further precisely realize whether the reduction of plaque formation induced by HCWEs can be attributed to blockage of viral binding and penetration at least partly, we would determine the effect of HCWEs on viral entry directly. The translocation of viral tegument protein VP16 into the nucleus and the expression of viral immediate-early protein ICP4 have been used as the indicators to examine HSV entry [37] . HCWEs were added to the host cells at the viral binding or penetration stage as described in Fig. 2A and Fig. 2B , and the nuclear fraction and total proteins were extracted to examine the viral VP16 translocation and viral ICP4 expression by Western blot assays, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3A and Fig. 3B , viral VP16 translocation and viral ICP4 expression were inhibited by HCWEs in both the binding and the penetration stages.",

To determine whether gD is a target of HCWEs, the recombinant gD proteins were expressed by baculovirus expression system and incubated with Vero cells at 37\u00b0C or 4\u00b0C for 1 hour to allow recombinant gD to bind onto Vero cells. The unbound recombinant proteins were washed out with PBS, and the bound recombinant proteins were detected by Western blot assays. As shown in Fig. 4A and Fig. 4B , HCWEs substantially inhibited the binding of recombinant gD onto Vero cells at concentrations of 0.05 mg/ml at both 37\u00b0C and 4\u00b0C. To rule the possibility that the decrease of recombinant gD binding is due to protein degradation caused by HCWEs, the recombinant gD proteins were incubated with different concentrations of HCWEs at 37\u00b0C for 3 hours, and analyzed by Western blot assay. Even in the highest concentration, HCWEs did not lead into gD degradation (S2 Fig.) .",

As shown in Fig. 6 , 1 mg/ml HCWEs obviously inhibited HSV-1 protein expression at 24 h.p.i.. HSV-1 IE genes are responsible for viral E and L gene expression and also essential for the viral lytic cycle. Thus, we next hypothesized that HCWEs could affect viral IE gene expression and further suppress viral proteins after viral entry. The host cells were infected with HSV-1 followed by treatment of HCWEs, and the RNA was extracted from HSV-infected cells at 2, 10, and 16 h.p.i. for analysis of the expression of the IE, E, and L genes, respectively, by real-time PCR (Fig. 7A and Fig. 7B ). ICP0 expression, the viral IE gene, was inhibited by HCWEs in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 7A) . Besides ICP0, the expression of ICP4, ICP22, ICP27 and ICP47 was also determined and the results indicated HCWEs could regulate other viral IE genes expressions slightly (S4 Fig.) . Furthermore, the expression levels of HSV-1 E gene UL52 and L gene UL13 were inhibited by HCWEs up to 300 and 1,000 folds, respectively (Fig. 7B) .

            "text": "During HSV infection, there are two waves of NF-\u03baB activation. The first-wave of NF-\u03baB activation could enhance ICP0 transcription via binding onto viral ICP0 promoter while the second-wave of NF-\u03baB activation could prevent host cells from apoptosis [17] . It has been reported that HCWEs block the second-wave of NF-\u03baB activation in HSV-2 infection [18, 29] . We hypothesized whether HCWEs could suppress the first-wave of NF-\u03baB activation and further eliminate NF-\u03baB binding onto HSV ICP0 promoter. To test this hypothesis, host cells were infected with HSV-1 in the presence of different concentrations of HCWEs, and the cell lysates were harvested for determination of NF-\u03baB activity. The nuclear fractions were extracted and applied to NF-\u03baB translocation analysis by Western blot assay. As shown in Fig. 8A , HCWEs inhibited NF-\u03baB translocation in a dose-dependent manner. To further explore whether HCWEs could inhibit HSV-1 ICP0 promoter activity via inhibition of NF-\u03baB activity, the HSV-1 ICP0 promoter was constructed into the pGL luciferase reporter vector, named as pGL-ICP0 Wt. After transfection, luciferase activity of pGL-ICP0 Wt transfected Fig. 2A and Fig. 2B . Nuclear extracts and total proteins were extracted from virus-infected cells and analyzed by Western blot assays with anti-VP16 and anti-ICP4 antibodies, respectively. \u03b2-actin was used as an internal control for protein loading. cells increased up to 3,000-fold compared with the vector control, pGL, in HSV-1 infection. However, the induction of luciferase activity was suppressed by HCWEs (Fig. 8B ). Although it is well known the expression of ICP0 is regulated by NF-\u03baB, the exact NF-\u03baB binding site on ICP0 promoter is not identified yet. Hence, we first used TRANSFAC software to predict the potential NF-\u03baB binding sites within HSV-1 ICP0 promoter. Only one NF-\u03baB binding site was predicted within the HSV-1 ICP0 promoter. To determine whether the HCWEs-mediated ICP0 suppression was NF-\u03baB-dependent, the predicted NF-\u03baB binding site within pGL-ICP0 Wt was mutated by PCR-based mutagenesis and the resulting plasmid was named as pGL-ICP0 Mut. Fig. 8B showed that the luciferase activity of ICP0-Mut was significantly decreased compared with ICP0-Wt in HSV infection, while there was no obvious suppression between HCWEs treatment and not. The results implied that HSV-1 ICP0 promoter activity was at least partly regulated by NF-\u03baB. To our best knowledge, besides viral ICP0 promoter, there were no potential NF-\u03baB binding sites had been identified within other viral IE genes promoters and that might partially reason why other viral IE genes such as CP4, ICP22, ICP27 and ICP47 did not regulate under HCWEs treatment.

We further studied the anti-HSV mechanism of each active compound. The virus pretreatment assays and virus binding assays showed that quercetin, but not rutin or isoquercitrin, targeted virus particles directly and inhibited viral entry (Fig. 9A and Fig. 9B) . Furthermore, we also identified which compound contributed to inhibition of NF-\u03baB activity by Western blot assay.

It shed light on the development of new anti-HSV drugs for overcoming the surge of drug resistance in HSV. HCWEs affected multiple stages of HSV infection, such as viral entry and viral gene expression, and thus eventually suppress HSV replication. Furthermore, quercetin possesses anti-HSV activities, particularly on inhibition of viral binding, viral penetration, and host NF-\u03baB activation, and isoquercitrin suppresses NF-\u03baB activity. Rutin, another major component of H. cordata, has been shown to have anti-HSV activity, with an EC 50 of 187.58 mg/ml. However, the anti-HSV mechanism of rutin is still unclear and needs to further investigate. Pretreatment of HSV with HCWEs blocked viral plaque formation, but no obvious inhibitory effect was observed in HCWEs-pretreated host cells. The experiments of the ICP4 expression and the VP16 translocation further confirmed that HCWEs inhibited viral entry in both the binding and the penetration stages. HSV gD protein can bind to four coreceptors up to date, including herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM), nectin-1, nectin-2, and 3-O-sulfated heparin sulfate, which is necessary for viral post-binding entry into host cells [38] [39] [40] . UV-inactivated wild-type HSV virions, but not UV-inactivated virions lacking gD, and soluble gD could block HSV infection implied that viral gD is an ideal target for developing anti-HSV drugs [42] [43] [44] [45] . HCWEs inhibited the binding of recombinant gD protein onto host cells. The fact indicated that HCWEs may act on HSV gD protein directly and inhibit viral entry at the stages of viral binding and penetration. Certainly, we could not exclude the possibility that other viral glycoproteins such as viral gB, gC, gH and gL might involve in the inhibition of viral entry.",

            "text": "After viral entry, HCWEs inhibited viral IE genes, E genes, and L genes expressions. Furthermore, HCWEs suppressed HSV-induced NF-\u03baB activation and attenuated NF-\u03baB mediated ICP0 transcription. ICP0, one of the HSV IE genes, could bind to several cellular proteins as well as viral promoters resulting in increased expression of viral E and L genes [46] [47] [48] . Thus, ICP0 is an important gene for the expression of viral E gene and L gene, and it can further regulate HSV replication. VP16, a tegument protein of HSV, can bind to the host cell factor (HCF) and form the VP16-HCF complex. The VP16-HCF complex then binds to the cellular protein, OCT-1, and stimulates the transcription of ICP0. In addition to the transactivating activity of VP16, other cellular cis-acting elements are also important in regulating the expression of ICP0, one of them being NF-\u03baB. NF-\u03baB is a host transcriptional regulator and can be activated in almost all types of cells by many types of stimulations, such as inflammation, bacterial and viral infections [49] . During HSV infection, there are two waves of NF-\u03baB activation. The first-wave was triggered through the binding of viral gD to the cellular receptor, and the activated NF-\u03baB was recruited onto viral ICP0 promoter to enhance ICP0 expression [17] . In the second-wave activation, NF-\u03baB was activated after 6 hours post-infection and could prevent host cells from apoptosis [50] . The compounds with inhibition of NF-\u03baB activation have been reported to exhibit anti-HSV activity. Resveratrol and Lornixicam could downregulate HSV infection-induced NF-\u03baB and further impair viral IE genes expressions and prevent recurrent herpetic stromal keratitis, respectively [51] . It was demonstrated that HCWEs could block HSV infection through inhibiting the second-wave of NF-\u03baB activation and our results revealed that HCWEs could also inhibit the first-wave of NF-\u03baB activation. However, in the time-of-addition assay we found that 0.01 mg/ml HCWEs could not inhibit viral plaque formation. In contrast to post-treatment, pre-treatment with same dose could suppress HSV replication. These evidences suggested that the inhibitory activity of HCWEs against HSV might mainly come from the HCWEs pre-treatment. Taken together, these evidences suggested that HCWEs not only inhibit HSV infection in early stages such as viral binding and penetration but also suppress virus replication via governing viral late genes after viral entry. However, whether other inhibitory mechanisms such as suppression of viral DNA synthesis and block of viral package also involved in suppressing virus replication at this stage were needed to further investigate.",

We found that rutin, quercetin, and isoquercitrin exhibit anti-HSV activities.

To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first report to present the anti-HSV mechanisms of quercetin and isoquercitrin. In the present study, Western blot and virus pretreatment assays revealed that only quercetin could block the binding of HSV to host cells. The NF-\u03baB translocation assays indicated that quercetin and isoquercitrin blocked HSV replication by inhibiting NF-\u03baB activation in virus infection. However, the anti-HSV mechanisms of rutin are still unclear. Moreover, the SI value of isoquercitrin to HSV was greater than 512.8 in this study, indicating a potential target for drug development.",
