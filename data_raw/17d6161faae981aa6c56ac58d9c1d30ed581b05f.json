The translational scanning machine, comprising the 40S ribosomal subunit and a cap-binding initiation factor complex (eIF4F, composed of eIF4E, eIF4G, and eIF4A), recognizes and binds to the 5' end methylated cap structure of mRNA and scans linearly downstream until it reaches an AUG codon embedded in an optimum context for the initiation of protein translation initiation [2] . For most eukaryotic mRNAs, the first AUG encountered by the translation initiation complex acts as the initiation codon. This is termed as the cardinal rule or the first AUG rule. In contrast to the scanning model, IRES can form specific secondary and tertiary structures and interact directly with the translational machinery beyond the AUG start codon.",

And most of the picornaviruses express a protease that specifically cleaves the eIF4G that cause the capbinding protein eIF4E cannot assemble with the 43S ternary complex (comprising eIF3 and the 40S ribosomal subunit charged with eIF2-GTP-Met-tRNA). Thus, upon infection by the picornaviruses, host cellular protein synthesis is shut down and the viral genome is translated from IRES without competition with cellular mRNA. The cleaved eIF4G (named p100) is able to interact with the picornavirus IRESs in the absence of the eIF4E binding domain [4] . Therefore, the IRES maybe a virulence factor and the identification of IRES element of pathogenic viruses can be a benefit for the treatment of the viruses infected disease. In addition, the IRES can be employed in the development of bi-cistronic expression vector that is an important tool for the biotechnology [5] . Thus, to develop an IRES search system (IRSS) for prediction and identification of IRES element(s) in a virus genome is an important issue.",

HeLa cells extracts are required for their optimal activity in the RRL in vitro translation system. In contrast, type II IRES which was found in cardioviruse and aphthoviruse genomes can initiate translation efficiently in RRL [10, 11] . And the HAV IRES can also function in the RRL system [6, 12] . However, the activity of the HAV IRES in the RRL in vitro translation system is stimulated by the liver cell extracts but not by the HeLa cells extracts [13] . HCV-like picornavirus IRES was found in Porcine teschovirus and Simian picornavirus which display IRES activity within the RRL in vitro translation system [14, 15] .",

Unfortunately, the lower homology between different IRES classes will cause inaccuracy of prediction by BLAST using primary sequences. The RNA structure prediction will therefore be useful to enhance the accuracy of de novo secondary structure prediction of IRES elements which depends somehow on good fortune. Many RNA structure prediction models have been used in RNA struc-ture simulation, but there is no suitable model to predict the IRES element. To set up an IRES search system (IRSS), two RNA structure prediction models: comparative sequence analysis and minimum free energy structure, were applied in our IRSS. Comparative sequence analysis [16] is the gold standard for prediction of RNA secondary structure without an all-atom model. Over 97% accuracy of base pairs in ribosomal RNA secondary structures, predicted by comparative sequence analysis, were also demonstrated in high-resolution crystal structures [17] [18] [19] . However, comparative sequence analysis requires a large number of homologous sequences in database. In the absence of necessary homologous sequences, minimum free energy structure prediction can be used to predict the structure of a single RNA sequence with an average of 73% accuracy [20] . This accuracy is sufficient to serve as a starting point to build an alignment for comparative sequence analysis [21] [22] [23] .",

However, IRES element secondary structure prediction is more complicated than other RNA structures due to three different IRES types that are all related with eIF4 and 40S ribosome subunit but diverse RNA structures. In order to develop an IRES search system, we combined the MFE and RNA alignment modeling programs and adjusted the parameters to create a useful search platform for IRES prediction. To develop the IRES search system, it will be necessary to screen the database of virus sequences by the prediction of secondary structure to identify the candidate IRES element in the virus genome, especially those positive strand viruses with 5' untranslated regions.

RNA secondary structure is predicted by different L parameters and then compared with known IRES structure. The alignment score indicats the possibility of de novo IRES. The IRES structures are displayed by RnaViz software and alignment can be edited by any text editor.

In this test, the L parameter of RNALfold was set to 250 (250 bases) to fetch the possible IRES structures because the length of EV71 domain IV is 205 bases.",

The last test sample is HCV, which has a different IRES type to EV71. HCV IRES is located on 5' UTR 1-340 nucleotides.

Three L parameters, 100, 250 and 400, were applied to inspect the discrimination for IRES elements from UTRdb. To determine the best cut-off values of R value in different L parameters, the HCV and Pestivirus 5' UTR are designed as the positive group and others are the negative group.

This database collects the full-length sequences of all mRNAs manifesting IRES activity. A similar work to collect experimentally verified IRES data has been done as UTR database which was also applied in our study. To set up the IRES search tool, we modified and combined two software to become a search flow. The RNAL fold is based on minimum free energy method, thus, longer sequences will reduce its accuracy. That is the major reason why L = 250 is better than L = 400. Minimum free energy prediction has been adopted by most of RNA secondary structure prediction software, unfortunately, its sensitivity is about 72% [20] . This explains that the sensitivity of our IRES search system is less than 72.3%. To conquer this problem, separated predictions for IRES different type structures might be the better option. However, occurrence of more false positives and longer computer CPU running time are the disadvantages. Therefore, more information is required to rule out false positives. The second software, RNA Align program, can compare first and secondary structures of RNA for a precise specific prediction of conserved structures such as Hairpin loop, Budge loop and Interior loop. On the other hand, RNA Align cannot hasten its calculation unless it is replaced by other programs or modifying the source codes.",

However, positive group may contain other virus which might be potential IRES elements. For example, Simian picornavirus has high R value (1.85) in 430-655 nucleotides. Comparison of the two predicted RNA secondary structures, Simian picornavirus domains 2, 4 and 6 (see Figure 5B ) are similar to HCV domain IIIf, IIIa and IIId (see Figure 5A ) respectively. This IRES element has been proved by Chard [33] . Similarities between the two whole structures is up to 41.7% which results to high R value region in Simian picornavirus by IRSS. Another ssRNA positive strand virus, Porcine enterovirus 8, has been discovered as potential IRES element at 190 nucleotides in L = 250 (see Figure 5C ). Its secondary structure also contains domains similar to HCV domains IIIa, IIIb, IIId and IIIf, that was recently proved by Pisarev [15] . The IRES elements of Simian picornavirus and Porcine enterovirus 8 genomes which matched our search results of IRSS. Moreover, IRSS can distinguish known IRES elements from UTRdb (see Figure 3D , E, and Figure 3F ). Our results demonstrate that IRSS is not only to predict RNA secondary structures but also to locate the IRES elements. However, in L = 100 and 400, none of Porcine enterovirus showed potential IRES structure due to various predicted structures in different L parameters, but two Retroviridae viruses, Rous Sarcoma virus and HIV, were located at pos-itive group in our calculation. Rous Sarcoma virus occupies four top scores in L = 100 and one of them, D10652, appears in L = 250 too (see Figure 5D ). The R value of 1060-1272 nucleotide within D10652 is 1.75 (cutting line R = 1.59, L = 250), which is sequence inside gag polyprotein coding region. Thus, this record shows to be false positive. Another Rous Sarcoma virus regions, (X51863 and M21526), were found to have IRES element at 5'UTR. This element forms a few stem loops similar to HCV domains IIIa, IIIb, IIId and IIIe (data not shown). But this IRES element conformation is smaller than HCV and Simian picornavirus. More experimental evidences are necessary to prove this IRES element.",

Species specificity is indeed an important factor in this test. During the second test, longer RNA sequences might cause difficulty in prediction for RNAL program which resulted to less positive results in L = 400. When L parameter was 100, shorter predicted length was easy to locate sub-structure that caused lots of predicted IRES elements that were focused in the same area and also revealed more false positive results. Predicted sub-domains of IRES element might match one of individual HCV domains resulting to the loss of the ability to fetch whole IRES element. After evaluation of all length parameters, middle size (L = 250) of prediction can cover whole IRES structure and also avoids the disadvantages of minimum free energy method. In addition, to improve sensitivity of IRSS, we are also preparing the implementation of a new designed program which will allow us to do similar interactions between 40s rRNA and IRES domains by 3D model. Furthermore, we plan to provide our IRES search system with a web-based interface which will help to define IRES elements. Finally, we believe that the IRSS will provide a useful source for IRES location before experimental study. The IRSS can be a public resource.

The second step is RNA secondary structure comparison which matches the known IRES structures executed by RNA Align program [36] . In our designed IRSS, primary RNA sequences inputted into search flowchart (see Figure 1 ) with individual length parameter (L) is transferred as raw RNA sequences into RNAL fold input format by \"UTR2SQ.pl\" [see Additional file 2] and the \"utr_dp.pl\" program [see Additional file 3]. The utr_dp.pl is the major control batch program to link each stage of IRSS. The output data of RNAL fold is then transformed into RNA Align format by B2RA.pl program [see Additional file 4]. The results of RNA Align software will be displayed as two files: Aligned structure and Alignment score files. Two statistical programs, DIST.R and sort.R [see Additional file 5 and Additional file 6], analyze those alignment scores and calculate the score distribution [37] . For RNA view, B2CT.pl [see Additional file 7] changes the predicted RNA secondary structure into \"connect file format\" (*.ct) which will read by RnaViz [38] to display in screen and print. The essential prerequisite step of this analysis is the calculation of secondary structure's stability by folding sub-sequences of length, L.",

The purpose of this test is to look for EV71 IRES domain IV (240-444 nucleotides) from those virus sequences using our IRES search system. Furthermore, in order to understand the precision of IRSS, the entire virus 5' UTR database (UTRdb, http://www.ba.itb.cnr.it/UTR/) and the target is HCV domain III (accession umber: AF177037) [41] [42] [43] , was input into the IRSS. Domain III of the HCV IRES positions at the initiation codon in the ribosomal mRNA binding cleft by binding the 40S subunit [44] .",

DIST represents the score of secondary structure in comparison with the default score of each RNA structure (base-deletion, basemismatch, arc-mismatch, are-removing, arc-altering and arc-breaking) adopted in RNA align software. Because DIST value will increase concomitantly with longer alignment length, DIST score fails to specify the significance of matched structures from shorter and bigger alignment sequences. Therefore, DIST and ALEN are transformed into a ratio which is defined as R = ALEN/DIST. The R values are collected from all predicted IRES elements including known IRES and potential candidate IRES elements. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) analyzes all R values to make a discriminant line that distinguishes candidate IRES group and non-IRES group. The error rate of IRES search system is estimated in comparison of known IRES structures with candidate IRES elements.",
