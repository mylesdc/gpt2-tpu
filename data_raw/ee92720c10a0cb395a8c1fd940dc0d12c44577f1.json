            "text": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a blood-borne pathogen causing acute and chronic hepatitis. A significant number of people chronically infected with HCV develop cirrhosis and/or liver cancer. The pathophysiologic mechanisms of hepatocyte damage associated with chronic HCV infection are not fully understood yet, mainly due to the lack of an in vitro system able to recapitulate the stages of infection in vivo. Several studies underline that HCV virus replication depends on redox-sensitive cellular pathways; in addition, it is known that virus itself induces alterations of the cellular redox state. However, the exact interplay between HCV replication and oxidative stress has not been elucidated. In particular, the role of reduced glutathione (GSH) in HCV replication and infection is still not clear. We set up an in vitro system, based on low m.o.i. of Huh7.5 cell line with a HCV infectious clone (J6/JFH1), that reproduced the acute and persistent phases of HCV infection up to 76 days of culture. We demonstrated that the acute phase of HCV infection is characterized by the elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) associated in part with an increase of NADPH-oxidase transcripts and activity and a depletion of GSH accompanied by high rates of viral replication and apoptotic cell death. Conversely, the chronic phase is characterized by a reestablishment of reduced environment due to a decreased ROS production and increased GSH content in infected cells that might concur to the establishment of viral persistence. Treatment with the prooxidant auranofin of the persistently infected cultures induced the increase of viral RNA titer, suggesting that a prooxidant state could favor the reactivation of HCV viral replication that in turn caused cell damage and death. Our results suggest that targeting the redox-sensitive host-cells pathways essential for viral replication and/or persistence may represent a promising option for contrasting HCV infection.",

The persistent HCV infection is clinically characterized by lifelong low-level virus production, and it is accompanied by the development of chronic liver infection (in about 80% of infected patients) that can evolve to steatosis, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and in a small percentage (about 20%) of chronically infected patients it can develop to the end-stage hepatocellular carcinoma [2] .",

            "text": "Although the exact molecular mechanisms underlying the HCV-related liver injury are not fully understood, redox alterations of hepatocytes have been extensively described in several chronic liver diseases [3, 4] . Oxidative stress, an imbalance between the reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and their clearance by scavenging molecules, has been recognized as a leading factor in inducing hepatocyte death, inflammation, and fibrogenesis, which are responsible for induction and perpetuation of liver damage [5] . Several authors report a rise of ROS levels during HCV infection [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] , and various viral proteins are known to induce and/or augment the ROS production, including HCV core, E1, E2, nonstructural (NS) 3, NS4B, and NS5A [11, [14] [15] [16] [17] . Moreover, the simultaneous induction of several ROS-producing pathways and enzymes, such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) oxidoreductases [15, 18] and NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) oxidases (NOXs) [15, 16, 19] , also contributes to HCV-induced oxidative stress. On the contrary, other studies report an increase in the antioxidant defenses, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxiredoxin (PRDX), glutathione S-transferase (GST) enzyme activity, and GSH levels [14, [20] [21] [22] [23] . Glutathione is an important radical scavenger that directly and indirectly neutralizes a variety of reactive molecules, such as superoxide anions (O 2 \u22c5\u2212 ), hydroxyl radicals, and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) [24] . The ratio between reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG) form of GSH is considered an important indicator of the antioxidant capacity of the cell.",

Indeed, Roe and collaborators [27] report a significant raise of GSSG in HCV-infected cells, while increased GSH concentration has been demonstrated by de Mochel et al. [19] using the same in vitro infection system. Interestingly, Abdalla et al. [20] describe the different effects of two viral proteins on cell antioxidant defenses. In fact, hepatocytes overexpressing HCV core protein have reduced GSH levels and increased the oxidation of thioredoxin (Trx), while the overexpression of viral NS5A protein (known for its ability to cause oxidative stress) [16] increases antioxidant enzymes (MnSOD and catalase), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and GSH content. Finally, patients with chronic hepatitis C show a depletion of GSH content, which increases after antioxidant treatment [28] . However, different genotypes of HCV exhibit different abilities to induce oxidative stress [29] . In fact, in patients chronically infected with genotype 1a/b, a sharp decrease of reduced GSH level has been observed with respect to the other genotypes, suggesting the more serious disease associated with this genotype [29] .",

Some studies demonstrate that acute HCV infection is associated with an early induction of proteins functioning in cellular stress responses, including the Nrf2-mediated oxidative stress response [23, 25] . On the other hand, HCV core impairs the Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway by inducing the translocation of sMaf proteins in the cytoplasm, where they bind to NS3 as part of the replication complex. As a result, Nrf2 is trapped in the cytoplasm and is unable to function as transcription factor [26, 30] .",

During the first two passages (8 days postinfection), about 80% of the cells were stained for HCV core protein, thus indicating a high rate of HCV replication corresponding to the \"acute\" phase of infection (Figure 1(a) left side). On the contrary, in the late stage of infection (76 days postinfection p.i.), here referred as the \"chronic\" phase, only about 15% of the cells expressed the core protein ( Figure 1 (a) right side). Similarly, the HCV RNA in intracellular compartment reached the highest titer (3 59 \u00d7 10 7 \u00b1 1 3 \u00d7 10 6 copies/\u03bcg total RNA * * * P < 0 001 vs. p0) 8 days p.i., and it decreased after the recovery phase of the cell culture and during the chronic phase (2 09 \u00d7 10 6 \u00b1 1 2 \u00d7 10 6 /\u03bcg total RNA at 44 days p.i and 6 \u00d7 10 5 \u00b1 9 \u00d7 10 2 copies/\u03bcg total RNA at 76 days p.i.) (Figure 1(b) ) that is consistent with a persistently infected cell culture. Furthermore, in correspondence with the maximum titer of HCV RNA, the number of HCV-infected cells was significantly reduced compared to uninfected ones (Figure 1(c) ). In fact, trypan blue dye exclusion assay showed a significant decrease of alive cells during the so-called \"crisis\" phase that lasted about two weeks during which the infected cultures were not splitted. Particularly, on days 8 and 14 most of the cells became rounded, detached from the plate, and floated in the culture medium (data not shown). Furthermore, FACS analysis of annexin V/PI double staining of cells showed that infected cells underwent apoptotic death only during the crisis phase. In fact, as shown in Figure 1 (d) (right panel), the percentage of double-stained PI+/AV+ cells increased with respect to uninfected cells (CTR) at passage 2 (p2). The 5-fold increase in percentage of apoptotic cells (obtained as mean from 4 independent experiments) was detected in infected cultures at 14 days p.i., compared to the uninfected ones ( Figure 1(d) , right panel). Interestingly, apoptotic death in infected cell cultures coincided with the highest intracellular viral RNA titer (Figure 1(b) ), thus suggesting a causative link between the rate of HCV replication and cell death. Subsequently to the crisis phase, cells started a recovery phase at the end of which the number of live cells, in HCV-infected cultures, was comparable to that of control cells (Figure 1(c) ; see value at p4). Accordingly, FACS analysis demonstrated that from 37 days p.i. up to 76 days p.i., the percentage of apoptotic cells returned to control values upon recovery of the cultures (Figure 1 (d) right panel; see values at p4, p6, p13, and p18). Moreover, from this time point up to 76 days p.i. (chronic phase), the percentage of HCV core-positive cells decreased to 15% (Figure 1(a) right panel) vs. 80% of the acute phase, thus mirroring viral titer trend (see Figure 1(b) ). These results strongly suggested a steady state level of HCV replication. Collectively, the results demonstrate that initial infection of Huh7.5 cells with low m.o.i. leads to obtain an acute in vitro infection featured by apoptotic death of infected cells, here named \"acute phase\". This latter is followed by the recovery of the infected cell cultures characterized by lower virus replication and subsequently by the establishment of a persistent infection, here named \"chronic phase\". All these characteristics indicated that an in vitro model of persistent infection with Jc1-HCV was set up.",

As shown in Figure 2 (a), a significant increase in intracellular ROS levels (more than 3 times higher compared to control) was detected in infected cells 8 days p.i.

Since the intracellular redox conditions seem to play a key role in the establishment of the chronic phase of HCV infection, we decided to evaluate whether the oxidative stress could reactivate HCV replication in chronically infected cells. For this reason, a chemical treatment with auranofin (Au), a well-known prooxidant drug [39] that induces ROS production in infected cells [40, 41] , was used. In our experimental model, treatment with Au (200 nM) for 48 hrs was able to induce an increment of intracellular ROS levels by twofold, either in uninfected (CTR) or in HCV-infected cells (Figure 5(a) ). In parallel, the number of intracellular HCV RNA copies in Au-treated cultures was about 40% greater than that of untreated infected cells (Figure 5(b) ). Interestingly, in this condition, only HCV-infected cell cultures underwent apoptosis ( Figure 5(c) ), suggesting that oxidative stress induction could favor viral replication that in turn caused cell damage and death.

            "text": "Oxidative stress has emerged as a key contributor to the development and progression of HCV-induced pathogenesis of liver [34, 35, 42] and the associated development of hepatocellular carcinoma [43] . The lack of an in vitro system that recapitulates the different stages of HCV chronic infection has hampered the disclosure of the exact mechanisms and the mutual effect of HCV infection and oxidative stress pathways on the host cells. In this study, we were able to set up the HCV infectious system in Huh7.5 cells, which are permissive to the JFH1 infectious clone [31] . Particularly, infection of cell monolayers with low m.o.i. of HCV allowed to obtain first an acute infection and subsequently the establishment of a persistent infection. We demonstrated that, during the acute phase, high percentage of infected cells underwent apoptosis and viral titer peaked, whereas during the chronic phase viral replication was reduced and consequently the percentage of apoptotic-infected cells. This model called \"long-term infected cultures\" (LTIC) could mimic the same stages of a natural HCV infection. It is interesting that HCV has long been believed noncytopathic virus, and the hepatocyte damage during infection was considered to be mediated by the immune system. However, consistent with previously reported results [44] , we could demonstrate that HCV induces cell death during in vitro infection of Huh7.5 cells in the absence of RIG-I-mediated innate immune response. The presence of low number of core expressing cells, during the here called \"chronic phase\", paralleled by the low level viral RNA titer, indicated the ability of the JFH1 clone of HCV to persistently infect susceptible cell cultures. With regard to the mechanisms involved in establishing in vitro persistence, there could be a close virus-host cell interaction, and as reported by Zhong et al. [44] , in Huh7.5 cells long-term infected by HCV, some cells resistant to reinfection, due to the loss of HCV receptor CD81, can be selected during the chronic phase. From the virus side, HCV is known to exist as quasispecies in patients in vivo, and during persistent infection in vitro, some virus variants can arise that are more adapted in cultures and able to persist without killing the host cells or having reduced infectivity [44] . These points will deserve deeper investigation in the future. Furthermore, during HCV acute infection, a ROS overproduction, mainly mediated by NADPH-oxidase NOX4, was registered in infected cells. NOXs are a family of seven enzymes, generating O 2 \u22c5\u2212 or H 2 O 2 from molecular oxygen [45] . Accumulating evidence indicates that NOX-mediated ROS production has a critical role in hepatic fibrosis [46, 47] , and in particular, NOX4 is involved in the severity of HCV-associated liver disease [19, 36] , as well as in the regulation of viral replication of different viruses [48] [49] [50] . Here, we found that NOX4 and NOX1 rise mirrored the trend of ROS production and that of viral replication; in fact, their expression was increased during the acute phase of infection, while it decreased late in infection, thus suggesting a critical role for NOXs also in regulating HCV replication cycle. The reason why both NOX enzymes were downmodulated in infected cells during the chronic phase is still unclear, but we hypothesize that it could be a further mechanism induced by the virus to maintain reducing environment into host cell for the establishment of its persistence. Indeed, other viruses are able at the same time to positively and negatively modulate NOX isoforms to their advantage [48] [49] [50] . Further studies will be needed to clarify this aspect.",

Therefore, it is also possible to speculate that nuclear NOX4 may increase during the acute phase of HCV infection in our experimental system, thus promoting the DNA damage and apoptosis of infected cells. Apoptotic death might favor virus spread throughout the cell culture. Further studies are in progress to deepen this aspect. It is important to note, however, that NOXs are not the only source of ROS production in HCV-infected cells [51] . In fact, some viral proteins, i.e., core, NS3/NS4A, and NS5A, have been shown to increase ROS levels [7, 9, [52] [53] [54] through direct or indirect interaction with mitochondria. Therefore, we cannot rule out that ROS increase in HCV-infected cells might be in part produced by mitochondrial compartment, other than NOXs.",

The oxidized environment seems to be necessary for HCV to replicate as demonstrated by viral titer peak in the acute phase. These data are in line with different in vitro studies on viruses responsible for acute infection, demonstrating the role of virus-induced oxidative stress in promoting viral replication [48, 50, [58] [59] [60] .

            "text": "It is known that GSH de novo synthesis is driven by Nrf2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor), one of the major cellular defense mechanisms against oxidative stress and a master regulator of different cytoprotective genes including those involved in the antioxidant GSH pathway [61] . It has been recently demonstrated that higher expression of nuclear Nrf2 contributes to persistent HCV infection and that knockdown of Nrf2 suppresses its persistent infection [62] . The authors suggest that the nuclear translocation of p-Nrf2 might play an important role in the expression of the genes which contribute to regulate apoptosis and HCV persistence [25, 26, 30, 62] . Accordingly, we found higher mRNA levels of GCL and GS enzymes during the recovery period; at the same time, Nrf2 protein content was highly expressed during the chronic phase. On the basis of these evidences, we suggest that the high GSH levels registered in chronically infected cells compared to those measured during the acute phase of infection might be partly related to the activation of Nrf2 pathway.",

In fact several clinical trials reported that antioxidant therapy decreases viral load and ameliorates hepatic damage [63] . However, other studies reported that supplementation with vitamin C, E, and selenium increased the antioxidant status but had no effects on viral load or oxidative markers [64] . All these conflicting results highlight the \"dark side\" of some antioxidants. Therefore, on the basis of our evidences and on the literature available, we suggest to carefully consider the use of antioxidants in chronically HCV-infected patients, since, although they could limit liver tissue injury, they would contribute to establish virus persistence that, in turn, can contribute to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma.",

In the recent years, new drugs acting specifically on HCV viral proteins (DAA) have been developed among which are the inhibitors of protease (telaprevir, boceprevir, and simeprevir) and the last approved RNA polymerase inhibitor, sofosbuvir [65] . Since the emergence of drug-resistant HCV variants has been recently described [66] , there is an urgent need to identify novel targets for the design of new effective therapeutic strategies. In this context, targeting of redox-sensitive host-cells pathways essential for viral replication and/or persistence may represent a promising option for contrasting HCV infection.",

Overall, our data indicate that redox sensitive pathways control the different phases of HCV infection and suggest a particular wariness in the supplementation of exogenous antioxidants in chronically HCV-infected patients for their potential role in favoring viral persistence.",
