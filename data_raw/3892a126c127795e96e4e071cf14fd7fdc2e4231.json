Matrine (MAT), a quinolizidine alkaloid derived from the herb Radix Sophorae Flave, has been recently found to suppress clinical EAE and CNS inflammation. However, whether this effect of MAT is through protecting the integrity and function of the BBB is not known. In the present study, we show that MAT treatment had a therapeutic effect comparable to dexamethasone (DEX) in EAE rats, with reduced Evans Blue extravasation, increased expression of collagen IV, the major component of the basement membrane, and the structure of tight junction (TJ) adaptor protein Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). Furthermore, MAT treatment attenuated expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 and -2 (MMP-9/-2), while it increased the expression of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase-1 and -2 (TIMP-1/-2). Our findings demonstrate that MAT reduces BBB leakage by strengthening basement membrane, inhibiting activities of MMP-2 and -9, and upregulating their inhibitors. Taken together, our results identify a novel mechanism underlying the effect of MAT, a natural compound that could be a novel therapy for MS.",

Matrine has long been used for the treatment of viral hepatitis, cardiac arrhythmia, and skin inflammation, without known side effects [24, 25] . While MAT suppressed development of EAE, its mechanism for neuroprotection has not been elucidated. The purpose of this study was to determine whether MAT treatment inhibits BBB disruption by reducing BBB leakage, strengthening the basement membrane, enhancing TJs, and regulating the balance between MMPs and TIMPs during disease progression of EAE.",

In the present study, we provide evidence that the therapeutic effect of MAT is, at least partially, through its strengthening of BBB integrity, its protection of the basement membrane as well as TJ proteins, and its ability to regulate the balance between MMPs and TIMPs in both the periphery and CNS. BBB destruction has been implicated in many CNS diseases, such as MS and stroke [4, 11] . In MS patients and in the EAE model, breakdown of the BBB is an early critical event, which is associated with the influx of inflammatory cells and, ultimately, with a poor outcome [3] . We thus quantified the extravasation of EB dye into the brain as an indicator of BBB permeability. Indeed, our study showed that EB leakage was markedly increased in the EAE model, which was associated with a decrease in collagen IV and ZO-1 expression in vehicletreated rats compared to naive rats. MAT treatment largely Figure 3 : BBB integrity. Evans Blue was i.v. injected at day 17 p.i. and brains were harvested at 60 min to determine Evans Blue extravasation.

Together, these results demonstrate that BBB integrity is compromised during the development of EAE and that MAT treatment protects the BBB.",

A study by Lee et al. clearly shows that degradation of collagen IV has a role in the pathogenesis of BBB destruction and brain injury [28] . To date, it is not known whether decreased collagen IV contributes to BBB damage caused by EAE. We have shown in the present study that expression of collagen IV mRNA was significantly decreased in the vehicle-treated group compared to the naive group, and a dose-dependent increase of collagen IV mRNA expression was observed in MAT-treated groups. These results indicate that collagen IV degradation plays an important role in BBB disruption and that MAT treatment effectively preserves the content of collagen IV.",

MMPs, a group of zinc-containing endopeptidases, cleave most components of the basement membrane including fibronectin, laminin, proteoglycans, and collagen IV [34, 35] . It has been found that focal MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity is closely associated with the infiltrating T cells penetrating through the parenchymal basement membrane [5, 6] . Upregulation of MMP-2 and MMP-9 resulted in the degradation of TJs after focal ischemia/reperfusion, which can be reversed by MMP inhibition [36, 37] . In addition, a selective upregulation of MMP-9 in MS disease activity has been described [17] . Similarly, a significant increase in MMP-2 expression in the central canal of the cervical spinal cord is a sign of inflammation in acute EAE [38] . Furthermore, among the MMP family, MMP-9, together with MMP-2, is a member of the collagenase IV family, which has been implicated in the degradation of constituents of the basement membranes [15] . Targeting MMPs and chemokines has been considered an important therapeutic approach, alone or in combination with current medications, in enhancing their effect in neurological disorders such as MS [39] . In the present study, significant upregulation of MMP-9 in serum was observed in the vehicle-treated group compared to the naive group, and MAT treatment reduced the levels of MMP-9. Further, the loss of collagen IV and ZO-1 was reduced by blocking MMP-9 and MMP-2 in EAE. These studies suggest that overexpression of MMP-9 and MMP-2 in EAE could have been a causative agent in the reduced intensity of collagen IV and ZO-1; MAT treatment inhibition of MMP-9 and MMP-2 levels will preserve levels of collagen IV and ZO-1 and will thus be beneficial for BBB integrity.",

It has been found that normal homeostasis in the CNS requires a balance between MMPs and TIMPs, while an imbalance between these molecules is often associated with CNS pathology [40] . For example, radiation-induced brain injury is associated with an increased ratio between MMP-2 and TIMP-2 [21] , and a significant increase in the MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratio also correlates with MS activity [17] . In our study, an imbalance between MMP-9 and TIMP-1 was observed in the vehicle-treated EAE group, with upregulation of MMP-9 and downregulation of TIMP-1; this was also the case for balance between MMP-2 and TIMP-2. We could speculate that overexpression of MMP-9/-2 in EAE was counterbalanced by MAT-mediated increase in TIMP-1/-2 expression, thus constituting a steady balance of MMPs and TIMPs that can be attributed to improved BBB function.",

This effect is at least partially through inhibiting activities of MMP-2/-9 and protecting the basement membranes and tight junction proteins, thus improving BBB integrity. As a result, inflammatory infiltration into the CNS is largely reduced, thereby protecting CNS tissues from proinflammatory cell/mediator-induced damage. While the process of immune cell extravasation is partially an endothelial cell-mediated process [44] , whether MAT reduces this pathway of immune cell infiltration is not yet known. Nevertheless, results from the present study, together with the suppressive effect of MAT on Th1/Th17 cells [23] and its safety, suggest that MAT could qualify as an effective, alternative medication in MS therapy and that further study to test this possibility is warranted.",
