This project involved a literature search and the interviewing of ministry of health officials, public health practitioners, and research ethics committee/IRB members in Jamaica and St. Lucia, to obtain suggestions for the best model for efficient coordination and communication between research ethics committees (RECs), and developed a template for expediting review of research protocols in epidemic and emergency conditions.

A standardized application form and a template for the ethical review of research proposals in emergency situations therefore needed to be developed, as well as models for collaboration between various research ethics committees in epidemic situations, especially when multi-centre studies are proposed. This could possibly expedite the conducting of research in public health emergencies, and facilitate the rapid sharing of research outcome data that could be highly beneficial not only to local communities, but also to the global community.",

            "text": "of the literature found nothing written specifically on research or research oversight in emergency situations in the Caribbean, or regarding ministries of health in the Caribbean and policy regarding research in emergency conditions. However, publication regarding the HIV epidemic in Latin America and the Caribbean 7 and the social response were found. 8 Another article described the work of the ministry of health in Haiti and its cholera surveillance during the Haiti Epidemic. 9 However, it provided no guidance on how ministries of health in the Caribbean could address policies regarding research and research ethics review during epidemic situations. Other articles described research endeavours regarding chronic diseases and public health challenges in the Caribbean, 10 integrity research into policy and programmes, 11 and HIV/AIDs and violence against women in the Caribbean islands of Barbados and Dominica, 12 but while they all researched important public health issues in the Caribbean, none contained anything that analytically assessed ministries of health in the Caribbean, or their work in emergency or epidemic or emergency situations, or the role of RECs/IRBs in the process. A further search was then made regarding the work of research ethics committees in the Caribbean. One article stated that guidelines for RECs exist at national and international levels, 13 while another stated that having attained a multinational consensus about what the fundamental guidelines should be, RECs are left to interpret the guidelines and devise their own means of implementing them. 14 Another article addressed research ethics in the Caribbean and capacity building, 15 while another argued for the establishment of RECs across the Caribbean to ensure that clinical research conformed to the highest scientific and ethical standards. 16 The upsurge in international biomedical research projects being conducted in Latin America and the Caribbean and the universal validity of ethical principles were stressed by another article, but again no mention was made regarding the role of research ethics committees in ethics review of research, or the particularity of research in epidemic or emergency conditions. 17 Research did not reveal many publications worldwide with a primary focus on guidance for research ethics review in emergency circumstances, a finding also confirmed by Tansey et al, 18 however, an article was found related to research in low and middle income countries (LMIC) under humanitarian crisis conditions. 19 It acknowledged the necessity for research to accurately describe phenomena in humanitarian emergency situations, and to evaluate the effectiveness and appropriateness of interventions. It purported that whilst the 4 basic ethical principles should be upheld in research, their application in emergency situations may differ from non-emergency situations. The authors opined that victims of emergency situations are vulnerable populations that need special protection from exploitation, and so technical competency to conduct research in emergency situations should include the ability to conduct a fair risk-benefit assessment to come up with a risk management plan, while being culturally sensitive to the needs of the victims of a humanitarian crisis. They proposed that in emergency situations the roles of IRBs may have to be modified without compromising the ethical standards that health researchers have globally attempted to achieve. Another article reviewed specific challenges occurring at the boundary of public health investigations and research, including issues of informed consent and institutional reviews processes, 20 while another looked at ethical issues arising in the context of research in disasters, but with no reference to ethics review of the research. 21 Interestingly, one paper proposed a framework for ethics governance that would encourage conversations about ethical issues in the oversight of research rather than the imposition of quasi-legalistic rules in the context of research being done by M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF). 22 Related to MSF, another article examined the experience of the Ethics Review Board (ERB) of MSF in addressing the process of review and ethical issues that arose in that context. 23 It proposed that when multiple ethical reviews of clinical and vaccine trials are to be done in public health emergencies, they should be accompanied by transparent communication between the ethics committees involved, a proposition that was central to the project conducted in the Caribbean. 7 Caceras CF.

Guidance for managing ethical issues in infectious disease outbreaks have been issued by the World Health Organization (WHO), and includes guidelines on allocating resources, research during infectious disease outbreaks, and the emergency use of unproven interventions outside of research, but again there was no specific guidance on the ethical review of proposals for research during epidemic and emergency situations. 26 A training manual by the WHO on 'Ethics in epidemics, emergencies and disasters: Research, surveillance and patient care', provides an overview on ethics in epidemics, emergencies, and disasters, and seeks to increase core competencies in research and their ethical implications in emergencies, what qualifies as 'research' during emergency responses and would normally qualify for ethics review, and to identify the shortcomings of current normative instruments for use in emergency situations and evaluate alternatives. 27 However, it does not provide a model for communication and collaboration between research ethics committees during emergency situations, nor a standard application form or template to be used for the ethical review of research during emergency conditions. The results of our literature review indicate that there is guidance existing regarding emergency situations with regard to operations under surveillance, and some specific guidance for research in emergency situations. However, no publications exist that could be used to guide research committees regarding expediting research in epidemic or emergency conditions, nor on collaborating when multi-centre research in disaster or emergency situations will be conducted within their jurisdictions.",

            "text": "These intensive interviews conducted in Jamaica and St. Lucia provided invaluable suggestions regarding possible communication and collaboration strategies between research ethics committees, and recommended possible models for the oversight of research in epidemic and emergency situations. 6 | DISCUSSION: THE MODEL FOR REC COLLABORATION AND COMMUNICATION DURING EMERGENCY Researchers who conduct research with human participants should be fully conversant with the fundamental considerations that underpin research ethics, including the requirement of the ethical review of research by a research ethics committee/IRB prior to the commencement of the research endeavour. 28 When research is to be done during emergency conditions or epidemic situations however, it is crucial that research proposals be speedily and efficiently assessed so as to effect the rapid conduct of research to hopefully provide relevant solutions. One example of such a need was the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Toronto in 2003, when clinical researchers complained of delays and missed opportunities for their research protocols due to the need for approval from research ethics boards. 29 Tansey et al thus proposed a framework to guide departures from normal research ethics reviews during emergencies, utilizing the concepts of proportionate review, enhanced diligence, and expedited review. 30 However, their proposal did not address the particular issue of how RECs may collaborate in reviewing proposals for research in epidemic or emergency conditions. RECs customarily conduct concurrent reviews of multi-centre research proposals, but for research proposed during emergency or epidemic situations, such reviews may hinder rather than aid in speeding up an efficient review of protocols. Further, the role, mandate, and jurisdiction of RECs may vary depending on whether they are based in the public sector (Ministry of Health), academic institutions, or are independent and fully autonomous. If research is proposed in Jamaica under an emergency situation (for example, post hurricane conditions), then all four RECs might be approached by researchers, and so collaboration would be vitally important. Whilst that at the national level of the Ministry of Health should be paramount, respondents expressed concerns regarding its inefficiencies as well as pointing to the autonomy that academic institutions have over research within their purview. A similar scenario was found in the OECS, where the REC of St. Lucia has the capacity to review research proposals from the nine member states of the situations when required, and such a model would have been very advantageous to the researchers conducting research in the countries affected by the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak, as they were hindered by insufficient dialogue between the RECs and inadequate harmonization of the multiple review processes involved in such urgent situations. 31 The model of communication and collaboration recommended in this project addressed questions such as -What communication models work best for ministries of health in the Caribbean and research ethics committees? Which would be the most efficient and effective in collaborating on reviews for research in emergency and epidemic situations? Consequently, the recommended model for collaboration to evaluate any proposed research in epidemic and emergency situations is: before any emergency or epidemic Master list of contact information for all stakeholders To be implemented under the auspices of the local Ministry of Health Should function for epidemic and emergency situations only The model is based on the collation of all the recommendations obtained in all the interviews. This template describes a committee that would be activated in regards to research in epidemic or emergency situations, and would involve a single 'ad-hoc' research ethics committee specifically convened for the purpose. It would be relatively small at 6 -7 persons, and comprising representatives from the local ministry of health, the chairs of the pertinent research ethics committees, and any specifically affected or interested parties to be determined locally. Further, community representation and involvement should occur. Research approval decisions or otherwise would be communicated back to the respective research ethics committees via their representatives on this ad-hoc committee. Legislation and legal provisions/support should also be made for the functioning of this committee. 28 Aarons DE. (2003). Issues in Bioethics: Teaching Research Ethics. West Indian Medical Journal: 52(2); 145-50. 29 Tansey et al, op. cit. note 1, p. 1489 . include the address for all the affected research ethics committees, should be made. There should also be a master list of contacts and addresses of all research ethics committees, which would be circulated to all of them.Secretariat support for the ad-hoc research ethics committee should occur. An administrative assistant who would receive relevant training should be a short to medium-term goal.As the conditions hereby described would apply to possible research in public health epidemic or emergency situations, this committee would be activated under the auspices of the local ministry of health, and function for emergency situations and epidemic infections only.",
