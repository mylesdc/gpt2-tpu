In the present study, we observed a high detection rate of PEDV, with 72.5 % (148/204) of diarrhea samples (suckling, weaned, and sows) and 88.5 % (77/87) of farms experiencing acute diarrhea found to be positive for PEDV by reverse transcription PCR. Sequencing and phylogenic analyses of the partial spike gene and ORF3 of PEDV demonstrated that all prevailing Japanese PEDV isolates belonged to novel genotypes that differed from previously reported strains and the two PEDV vaccine strains currently being used in Japan. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis revealed prevailing PEDV isolates in Japan had the greatest genetic similarity to US isolates and were not vaccine-related. Unlike vaccine strains, all prevailing field PEDV isolates in Japan were found to have a number of amino acid differences in the neutralizing epitope domain, COE, which may affect antigenicity and vaccine efficacy. The present study indicates recent PEDV isolates may have been introduced into Japan from overseas and highlights the urgent requirement of novel vaccines for controlling PEDV outbreaks in Japan.",

            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is a highly contagious and devastating viral enteric disease characterized by vomiting, acute onset of severe watery diarrhea, and dehydration. PED has a high infectivity and a particularly significant mortality in piglets (Pensaert and de Bouck 1978) . The porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), an enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the Alphacoronavirus genus of the Coronaviridae family, is responsible for PED. The PEDV genome is approximately 28 Kb in length and is composed of seven open reading frames (ORF) that encode four structural proteins, namely, spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N), and three major non-structural proteins, including replicases 1a and 1b, and ORF3 (Song and Park 2012) . Of the structural protein, the PEDV S protein plays a pivotal role in regulating interactions with specific host cell receptors to mediate viral attachment and entry. Moreover, the S protein is associated with the induction of host neutralizing antibodies, growth adaptation in vitro, and attenuation of virulence in vivo (Song and Park 2012) . Thus, study of the S glycoprotein has been essential in understanding the genetic relationships between PEDV strains, the epidemiological status of PEDV in the field, and the development of vaccines (Song and Park 2012; Chen et al. 2012) ; (Temeeyasen et al. 2014) .",

ORF3 gene plays a role in encoding an ion channel protein (Wang et al. 2012 ) and it has been suggested to be an important determinant for virulence of this virus (Song and Park 2012) . The virulence of PED can be reduced by altering the ORF3 gene through cell culture adaptation (Park et al. 2008) , and variation in ORF3 was reported to be associated with viral attenuation in the natural host (Song et al. 2003) . Also, vaccine-derived isolates with unique continuous deletions of 49 and 51 ORF3 nucleotides have been confirmed (Chen et al. 2010; Park et al. 2008) . Therefore, these unique deletions in the ORF3 gene can be used to differentiate between field and attenuated vaccine strains. Moreover, ORF3 gene variation may represent a useful tool in molecular epidemiological studies of PEDV (Park et al. 2008 (Park et al. , 2011 Song et al. 2003; Chen et al. 2010) .",

Afterwards, there have been sporadic PED outbreaks in intervals of several years. Since late 2013, numerous diarrhea epidemics, suspected to be caused by PED, have occurred in pigs throughout Japan. These epidemics were characterized by severe diarrhea, dehydration, and vomiting in pigs of all ages. Mortality rates were particularly high among suckling pigs. Up to the end of August 2014, more than 410,000 of 1,286,000 pigs from 817 infected farms have died of PED in Japan based from the report of Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) (http://www.maff.go.jp). However, there have been few studies investigating the re-emergence of PEDV in Japan. This study aimed to evaluate the genetic characteristics and molecular epidemiology of the emergent Japanese PEDV isolates using genome analysis and phylogenetic analysis of the partial S gene and ORF3.",

Group G1 can be further divided into 3 subgroups: G1-1, G1-2 and G1-3 ( Fig. 1) .

Generally, ORF3 has utility as a valuable tool in the study of PEDV molecular epidemiology and for differentiating between field and vaccine-derived isolates. Our study revealed that the ORF3 gene of the Japanese vaccine strains, P5-V and 96P4C6, have unique deletions (49 and 4nt, respectively) that can lead to reading frame-shift and coding of truncated polypeptides. This genetic characteristic can be used to differentiate between field and attenuated-derived vaccine PEDV. Moreover, the finding of 49nt deletion in ORF3 gene of P5-V in this study is different from the result of a previous study (Park et al. 2008) in which authors reported that P5-V have 51nt deletion in ORF3 gene. This difference may be due to the genetic variation of P5-V during the time of the study. The results of the present study demonstrated that no deletion were observed in the Japanese field isolates, suggesting that they are not vaccine-related.

The recent Japanese PEDV isolates in this study are marked by solid round symbols, the Japanese strains prior to 2013 are marked by solid diamond symbols, and the vaccine strains being used in Japan are marked by solid square symbols.

In particular, the common isolate 14JM-01 representing 21 PEDV samples from the 5 prefectures in Japan, had 100 % ORF3 gene homology with the majority of US strains (USA/Iowa/18984/2013, USA/Iowa/16465/2013, ISU13-22038-IA-passage9, IA1, IA2, OH1414, OH851, USA/Colorado/2013, MN, Iowa106, and ISU13-22038-IA-homogenate). In contrast, the ORF3 genes of the two vaccine strains, with exception of the identified unique deletions, were found to have low (95.8-97.8 %) nucleotide identity with field Japanese isolates.DiscussionPED has been observed in Japan since the 1980s and a number of attenuated PED vaccines have been developed and used on pig farms to prevent this disease, particularly since late 2013 when PED has reemerged in Japan. However, PEDV infections still spread rapidly and are Phylogenetic analysis of the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus isolates based on the ORF3 of PEDV.
