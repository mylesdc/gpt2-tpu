Efforts focused solely on the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the viral Spike (S) glycoprotein may not optimize neutralizing antibody (NAb) responses. Here we show that immunogens based on full-length S DNA and S1 subunit protein elicit robust serumneutralizing activity against several MERS-CoV strains in mice and non-human primates. Serological analysis and isolation of murine monoclonal antibodies revealed that immunization elicits NAbs to RBD and, non-RBD portions of S1 and S2 subunit. Multiple neutralization mechanisms were demonstrated by solving the atomic structure of a NAb-RBD complex, through sequencing of neutralization escape viruses and by constructing MERS-CoV S variants for serological assays. Immunization of rhesus macaques confers protection against MERS-CoV-induced radiographic pneumonia, as assessed using computerized tomography, supporting this strategy as a promising approach for MERS-CoV vaccine development.",

Since April 2012, 1,348 cases and 479 deaths in over twenty-five countries have been attributed to this novel beta-coronavirus 1, 2 . As human-to-human transmission of the virus is not sustained, a large zoonotic reservoir may serve as a principal source for transmission events [3] [4] [5] [6] . The high case fatality rate, vaguely defined epidemiology, and absence of prophylactic or therapeutic measures against this novel virus have created an urgent need for an effective vaccine should the outbreak expand to pandemic proportions.",

The primary target for neutralizing antibodies is the Spike (S) glycoprotein, cleaved into two subunits: S1, which is distal to the virus membrane and S2, which contains both a transmembrane domain and two heptad-repeat sequences typical of class I fusion glycoproteins 8, 9 . The S1 subunit has been the focus of most immunization strategies against MERS-CoV 10-12 , as it contains the receptorbinding domain (RBD) that mediates virus attachment to its host receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) 13 . Expressing the RBD on multiple vaccine platforms can elicit neutralizing antibodies of high potency [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] that prevent viral attachment across many strains but will not elicit antibodies that contribute to neutralization through fusion inhibition. We developed an alternative vaccine regimen, based on full-length S DNA and a truncated S1 subunit glycoprotein, to elicit a broad repertoire of antibodies with diverse mechanisms of viral neutralization, and found that immunization with these constructs protected non-human primates (NHPs) from severe lung disease after intratracheal challenge with MERS-CoV.",

The England1 strain (GenBank ID: AFY13307) was chosen on the basis of the availability of its sequence and its proximity to a consensus among published sequences, particularly within the RBD. We constructed three plasmid vaccines that encoded (1) full-length, membrane-anchored Spike; (2) transmembranedeleted (DTM) Spike containing the entire ectodomain; and (3) S1 subunit only. All three plasmids were delivered intramuscularly by needle and syringe, followed by electroporation. The two protein subunit vaccines included S-DTM and S1 and were delivered intramuscularly by needle and syringe with Ribi adjuvant. These five candidate vaccines were systematically evaluated in mice according to eight immunization regimens (Fig. 1a) . To test the immunogenicity of our vaccine candidates against multiple MERS-CoV strains-without the requirement of a biosafety level 3 facility-we developed a pseudotyped reporter virus neutralization assay, as we did previously for SARS-CoV [19] [20] [21] [22] . We confirmed that the assay measured viral entry via the MERS-CoV receptor, DPP4, by demonstrating that HEK 293 cells required DPP4 expression on their surface for efficient infection and that soluble DPP4 or anti-DPP4 antibody prevented infection ( Supplementary Fig. 1a-d) .",

The full-length S DNA regimen induced a significantly higher antibody response than the truncated S-DTM or S1 DNA regimens. Antibody titres tended to be either low or undetectable after the first dose of DNA but were boosted 10-fold after immunization with S1 protein. Two doses of S1 protein achieved an IC 90 neutralization titer (90% inhibitory concentration) near that of the DNA/protein regimen. Three of the eight vaccine regimens-S DNA, S DNA-S1 protein and S1 protein alonewere carried forward for detailed evaluation. S-DTM gave low production yields from transfected HEK 293 cells and was not evaluated further. Immune sera (5 weeks after final boost) from these three regimens were tested against a panel of eight pseudoviruses and found to generate equally robust NAb titres against all strains (Fig. 1c) . The sequence homology across strains ( Supplementary Fig. 2) likely accounted for the breadth of neutralization. SARS-CoV pseudovirus was not neutralized by sera from any of the immunized mice. Pseudovirus neutralization results were compared with a live virus microneutralization assay for the JordanN3 strain (GenBank ID: KC776174.1). The pseudovirus neutralization assay was B10-fold more sensitive to neutralization than the live virus, although the two assays correlated well with one another on the basis of relative magnitude ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ).",

First, sera were pre-adsorbed with HEK 293T cells expressing transmembrane-anchored versions of S, S1, S2 and RBD ( Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 4a ) and were screened for neutralization (Fig. 2a) . Sera pre-adsorbed with untransfected cells retained 95% of their original neutralization activity, while negative control pre-immune sera showed no capacity for virus neutralization. The full-length Spike-transfected cells adsorbed virtually all neutralization activity from the immune sera of all three vaccine groups, while the RBD expressed by itself on the cell membrane only adsorbed about half of the neutralizing activity, and only in the S1 protein group, suggesting the possibility that the conformation of RBD presented in the full-length Spike and in the truncated versions may differ. Adsorption with S1 also removed all neutralization activities in the S1 protein group and B60% of neutralizing capacity in the two DNA-primed groups. In contrast, S2 did not deplete neutralization activity in any of the groups, except slightly in mice vaccinated with DNA alone. It is likely that expression of S2 by itself on cells resulted in rearrangement to the post-fusion conformation, and therefore neutralizing epitopes present on the prefusion structure would not have been available for adsorption. Flow cytometric analysis of serum bound to cells that expressed different Spike subunits gave consistent results ( Supplementary Fig. 4c ).",

As seen in the cell adsorption assay, soluble S1 protein removed neutralizing activity of sera from all three vaccine groups, although to a higher degree in the mice immunized only with S1 protein compared with the groups primed with S DNA. Soluble S2 ( Supplementary Fig. 4b ) had no impact on serum neutralization capacity and full-length Spike was not used as a competitor as it could not be expressed in the soluble form. Overall, these data indicated that the serum neutralization activity in the protein-only immunization group was directed primarily against the RBD. The S DNA-only or S DNA-S1 protein-induced immune sera were more complex as more than half of the neutralizing activity was directed against S1; however, there was residual activity that was not absorbed or competed by S1.

Candidate vaccine immunogens were designed on the basis of the Spike glycoprotein sequence of the England1 MERS coronavirus and elicited high neutralization titres. (a) Schematic representation of MERS-CoV Spike protein cDNAs and recombinant proteins. Five vaccine constructs were made: three DNA and two protein subunits. DNA constructs consisted of full-length Spike or truncated versions that either had the transmembrane domain or the entire S2 subunit deleted. The protein constructs contain either a truncated Spike molecule with the transmembrane domain deleted (S-DTM) or the S1 subunit. RBD, receptor-binding domain; SP, signal peptide; TM, transmembrane domain; FTH, foldon (trimerization domain), thrombin (cleavage site) followed by histidine tag; 3CHis, Human rhinovirus 3C protease cleavage site, followed by 6 \u00c2 histidine tag. (b) Immunogenicity of eight vaccine regimens. Five mice per group were immunized with plasmid DNA only at weeks 0, 3 and 6 (groups 1-3); plasmid DNA at weeks 0 and 3 and protein plus Ribi adjuvant at week 6 (groups 4-6); or protein plus Ribi adjuvant at weeks 0 and 4 (groups 7 and 8). Two weeks after each immunization, sera were collected and neutralizing antibody titres were measured against pseudotyped MERS-CoV England1 virus. Open, grey and black bars, respectively, represent the IC 90 neutralization titres (GMT from five mice per group with 95% confidence interval) from the post-prime, first post-boost and second post-boost sera. Each sample was tested in triplicate; all assays were repeated once. A nonparametric two-tailed t-test (Mann-Whitney) was used for statistical analysis, and the relevant P values are indicated. (c) MERS-CoV vaccines induced cross-neutralization to eight MERS-CoV strains. The sera from the mice immunized with MERS-CoV S DNA three times, primed with S DNA and boosted with S1 protein plus Ribi adjuvant, or primed and boosted with S1 protein plus Ribi adjuvant were assayed for neutralization to the eight strains of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV pseudotyped viruses as indicated. IC 90 titre is shown. Data are presented as the mean of triplicates with s.e.'s. Fig. 5a ,b). S DNA immunization induced an IgG2a-dominant response (geometric mean titre (GMT) IgG2a/IgG1 ratio of 6), while S1 protein immunization generated an IgG1-dominant response (GMT IgG2a/IgG1 ratio of 0.06). This IgG subclass response pattern appeared to be determined by the priming immunization as the S DNA prime-S1 protein boost regimen induced a similar pattern and magnitude of IgG2a polarization as the S DNA-only regimen. The IgG2a and IgG1 subclass responses, respectively, reflect T helper 1 cell (Th1)-and T helper 2 cell (Th2)-biased immune response patterns in mice 23 . The IgG2a or Th1-biased response elicited by the DNA-containing regimens is likely due to the induction of interferon-g-producing CD8 T cells that modulate CD4 T-cell differentiation 24, 25 . The monophosphoryl lipid A-based Ribi adjuvant was not sufficient to influence the IgG subclass polarization towards a Th1 phenotype as would be expected 26, 27 . Thus, compared with priming with a protein, DNA priming generated a T helper response that is generally associated with more effective control of viral infections.",

The final round of hybridoma screening generated 45 subclones ( Supplementary Fig. 6 ), four of which (D12, F11, G2 and G4) were selected for additional characterization on the basis of their binding specificity and neutralization potency (Fig. 3 , Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 7 ). All four mAbs demonstrated, using immunofluorescence (IF), binding to live virus (EMC strain)-infected cells ( Supplementary Fig. 8 ). D12 and F11 bound the RBD within the S1 subunit. The mAb G2 was also specific for S1; however, it bound outside the RBD. G4 bound only to the S2 subunit (Fig. 3) . Although not as potent as the RBD-specific mAbs (Table 1) , G2 and G4 were unique as compared with other reported mAbs against MERS-CoV 14-17 in their ability to neutralize virus despite targeting epitopes outside the RBD.

Notably, F11 was unable to neutralize the Bisha1 strain (GenBank ID: KF600620.1) of MERS-CoV ( Supplementary Fig. 9b ), which differs from other strains by an aspartic acid to glycine substitution at residue 509, rendering it resistant to F11 while still susceptible to D12 neutralization. This finding was recapitulated in a pseudotyped virus neutralization assay where F11 neutralization activity against wild-type England1 was ablated with the introduction of a D509G mutation ( Supplementary Fig. 9b ). D12, in contrast, neutralized both viruses irrespective of the amino-acid change at position 509. In addition, the RBD 509G mutation abrogated F11 binding using enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) but did not affect D12 binding (Fig. 4e ).",

The EMC strain of MERS-CoV escaped neutralization by D12 when the serine at position 532 was mutated to either a proline or tryptophan. The introduction of a proline at position 531 removes two hydrogen bonds to the D12 antibody ( Fig. 4c and Supplementary Table 2), while successive prolines at 531 and 532 (proline 532 is native to the RBD) are predicted to alter the side-chain orientation of adjacent residues, likely affecting W535 and E536 interactions with D12. Mutation to a bulky tryptophan side chain would cause a direct clash with the CDR L3, precluding the binding of D12 (Fig. 4c-e) . Although it also targets the RBD, F11 neutralizes MERS-CoV by a different mechanism than D12. Site-directed mutagenesis and competitionbinding studies indicate that F11 makes contact with the RBD on the opposing side of the binding site of D12, at and around residue 509. Binding studies also show that both D12 and F11 can bind to the RBD at the same time ( Supplementary Fig. 11a-c) , suggesting the potential for additive neutralization effects. The differing points of contact made by F11 and D12 on the MERS-CoV RBD are analogous to those of other mAbs specific for the SARS-CoV RBD ( Supplementary Fig. 12a-d) 29, 30 , suggesting convergent mechanisms of neutralization. Furthermore, these data elucidate mechanisms for virus neutralization that involve the disruption of binding between the N-terminal end of the MERS-CoV RBD and its host receptor DPP4.",

Intratracheal inoculation of 5 \u00c2 10 6 p.f.u. of the JordanN3 strain (GenBank ID: KC776174.1) was performed on each animal. The per cent abnormal lung volume in all NHPs peaked on day 3 post challenge; however, the lung infiltrates were significantly more extensive and prolonged in the unvaccinated compared with vaccinated NHPs. A nonparametric two-tailed t-test (Mann-Whitney) was used. *P value o0.05; ** P valueo0.01. (d) Abnormal lung segmental images from selected animals on day 6 post challenge. The images correspond to NHP lung volume data points circled in black in Fig. 5c . The CT images and abnormal lung segments for all 18 animals are shown in Supplementary Fig. 14 33 with pulmonary infiltrates when challenged with MERS-CoV. Virologic sampling from the lungs of these NHPs is complicated as a bronchoalveolar lavage, although increasing the yield of virus recovery would likely confound the radiologic findings. In addition, the JordanN3 strain used to challenge the NHPs may have been less virulent than the EMC strain used in other challenge studies of rhesus macaques. Nonetheless, the pattern of pulmonary disease on high-resolution CT differed significantly between vaccinated and unvaccinated NHPs. In mice, induced mAbs were cross-reactive against multiple MERS-CoV strains and were directed against the RBD of the Spike glycoprotein-preventing attachment-and against epitopes outside the RBD, in the S1 and S2 subunits. The co-crystal structure and analysis of escape mutations provided a mechanistic explanation for neutralization by the RBD-directed neutralizing antibodies. The RBD-specific antibodies we isolated are comparable to others reported in the literature, particularly those isolated from human antibody phage libraries 34 . However, D12 and F11 target different epitopes and are approximately a 1,000-fold more potent in their neutralization capacities than those previously reported. D12 appears to be highly novel in epitope recognition, while F11 shows some epitope overlap with the mAb 3B12 in the T512 loop region. However, the added sensitivity of 3B12 to mutations at positions 540 and 542 is not seen with F11, thus highlighting the difference in their respective epitopes.",

            "text": "Compared with protein alone, S DNA prime-S1 protein boost immunization yielded a more functionally diverse repertoire of neutralizing antibodies and also generated a Th1-biased immune response. The DNA-primed regimen also offered greater and earlier protection from radiographically defined pneumonia in challenged NHPs on the basis of earlier clearance of lung infiltrates, suggesting the potential contribution of effector CD8 \u00fe T cells elicited by DNA immunization. Thus, while a protein-only MERS-CoV vaccine may be the simpler approach, there are potential advantages to include DNA priming, including improvement in the potency and durability of immune responses 35 . In the context of SARS-CoV we have previously shown, in mice, that a DNA prime coupled with an inactivated virus boost enhanced both cellular and humoral immunities 36 . Through modifications in the boost interval, additional improvements in the magnitude and functional properties of the antibody response may also be achieved, as is the case for conventional influenza vaccines [37] [38] [39] , although further studies would be needed to confirm this for these MERS-CoV immunogens.",

In addition to providing a broader array of functional antibody responses, non-RBD-directed antibodies may aid in solving the trimeric Spike glycoprotein structure by targeting quarternary epitopes and stabilizing the prefusion conformation. Structural information on native pre-triggered glycoprotein trimers will be important for informing secondgeneration immunogen designs, as it has been for respiratory syncytial virus 41, 42 . Experimental vaccines that yield mAbs provide information on the key viral structures and mechanisms of neutralization to guide improvements in MERS-CoV immunogens. A similar iterative cycle of rapid, empirical antigen design, antibody discovery and development of reagents and assays to characterize immunogenicity in different animal models may also be applicable to other emerging viral pathogens 42 . DNA and protein vector constructs. We constructed DNA vaccines of MERS-CoV England1 strain Spike (strain England1, GenBank ID: AFY13307) and two truncated versions, S-DTM and S1 (Fig. 1a) . Amino-acid sequences were obtained from GenBank, reverse-translated and codon-optimized for human cell expression. Seventy-five-base pair (bp) oligonucleotide sets with twenty-five-base pair overlaps were synthesized and gel-purified.
