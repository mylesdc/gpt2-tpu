A single imported case of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in South Korea, identified on 20 May 2015, resulted in 150 laboratory-confirmed cases, amplified by infection in hospitals and the transfer of patients within and between hospitals, and caused 15 deaths within 26 days, mainly among patients, visitors and healthcare personnel [2] . This highlighted the need for vigilant surveillance and the importance of swift and thorough contact tracing.",

Upon arriving at the airport, the patient took a taxi to a hotel and checked in before leaving to a private hospital in another taxi. Upon presentation at the emergency room at the private hospital, the patient was promptly diagnosed with heart failure and possible pneumonia. As the patient had travelled from the Middle East that day, MERS was suspected and he was isolated in a negative pressure room (NPU). On day 3, the private hospital notified the Bureau of Epidemiology, under the Thai MOPH, of the Omani patient. RT-PCR for MERS-CoV on upper respiratory tract samples (nasopharyngeal swabs) that were sent on days 2 and 3 resulted in false negatives, leading to a 48-hour delay in diagnosis and a decision to transfer the patient out of the negative pressure unit (NPU) on day 3. Subsequent examination of a sputum sample later on day 3 confirmed MERS-CoV infection in the patient. The patient was immediately transferred back into the NPU.

Although precautions such as ThermoScan are in place at airports in light of the MERS-CoV outbreak in the Middle East and South Korea, cases can slip through checkpoints due to atypical presentations. The patient flew on a commercial airline despite his sickness and was not detected by the ThermoScan at the immigration checkpoint in Bangkok as he was afebrile. He only had a mild, non-productive cough. This case report also provides important lessons regarding clinical case identification. The clinical diagnosis was complicated due to the existence of congestive heart failure, a condition that predisposes to either community-acquired or nosocomial pneumonia of various aetiologies. Furthermore, initial chest radiographs did not show clear signs of interstitial pneumonia as expected with MERS-CoV infection. Various contact tracing methods involving the cooperation of several authorities and business institutes, such as the border control, airline, hotel management, traffic control, local authorities and hospitals, were used to track-down all potential contacts in order to prevent an outbreak. Phone calls, passenger manifests, surveillance videos and immigration cards were essential tools for the successful contact tracing.",

This aligns with the WHO interim guidelines, which encourage using lower respiratory tract samples if available [8] . Physicians, surveillance staff and laboratory personnel must be well-informed about the procedures, reliability and limitations of diagnostic tests, and should be able to recognise signs of mismatch between laboratory results and clinical presentations. In this case, the initial diagnostic testing of upper respiratory tract samples on days 2 and 3 caused a delay in diagnosis that could have facilitated onward transmission. Fortunately, the patient was isolated in a NPU upon initial admission; however, he could have exposed other patients and hospital workers during the 8 hours he spent in regular ICU after the initial false negative test results. The decision to conduct repeated laboratory testing, as well as to test lower respiratory tract samples, was driven by clinical assessment and knowledge of the virus excretion pattern reported in earlier cases.",
