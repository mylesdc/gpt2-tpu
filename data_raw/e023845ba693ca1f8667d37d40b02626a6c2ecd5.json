            "text": "Human mobility is a key component of large-scale spatial-transmission models of infectious diseases. Correctly modeling and quantifying human mobility is critical for improving epidemic control, but may be hindered by data incompleteness or unavailability. Here we explore the opportunity of using proxies for individual mobility to describe commuting flows and predict the diffusion of an influenza-like-illness epidemic. We consider three European countries and the corresponding commuting networks at different resolution scales, obtained from (i) official census surveys, (ii) proxy mobility data extracted from mobile phone call records, and (iii) the radiation model calibrated with census data. Metapopulation models defined on these countries and integrating the different mobility layers are compared in terms of epidemic observables. We show that commuting networks from mobile phone data capture the empirical commuting patterns well, accounting for more than 87% of the total fluxes. The distributions of commuting fluxes per link from mobile phones and census sources are similar and highly correlated, however a systematic overestimation of commuting traffic in the mobile phone data is observed. This leads to epidemics that spread faster than on census commuting networks, once the mobile phone commuting network is considered in the epidemic model, however preserving to a high degree the order of infection of newly affected locations. Proxies' calibration affects the arrival times' agreement across different models, and the observed topological and traffic discrepancies among mobility sources alter the resulting epidemic invasion patterns. Results also suggest that proxies perform differently in approximating commuting patterns for disease spread at different resolution scales, with the radiation model showing higher accuracy than mobile phone data when the seed is central in the network, the opposite being observed for peripheral locations. Proxies should therefore be chosen in light of the desired accuracy for the epidemic situation under study.",

            "text": "One of the biggest challenges that modelers have to face when aiming to understand and reproduce the spatial spread of an infectious disease epidemic is to accurately capture population movements between different locations or regions. In developed countries this task is generally facilitated by the existence of data or statistics at the national or regional level tracking individuals' movements and travels, by purpose, mode, and other indicators if available (see e.g. transport statistics in Europe [1] , commuting, migration data or other types of mobility at country level [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] ). Access to highly detailed and updated data may however still be hindered by national privacy regulations, commercial limitations, or publication delays. The situation becomes increasingly complicated in less-developed regions of the world, where routine data collection may not be envisioned at similar levels of details [7] , but which, most importantly, may be characterized by a high risk of emergence and importation of infectious disease epidemics or may suffer of endemic diseases.",

For rapid directly transmitted infections, daily movements of individuals represent the main mean of spatial transmission. At the worldwide scale, air travel appears to be the most relevant factor for dissemination, as observed during the SARS epidemic [8, 9] and the 2009 H1N1 pandemic [10, 11] . On smaller regional scales, instead, daily commuting is significantly linked to the spread of seasonal influenza [12, 13] , affecting the epidemic behavior at the periphery of the airline transportation infrastructure [14] .",

Such direction of research has gained great popularity, leading to the discovery of universal characteristics of individual mobility patterns, and the possibility to study mobility in space and at timescales that were unreachable before [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . Such increasing volumes of finely resolved human mobility data, thanks to the near ubiquity of mobile phones, also offered an opportunity to contrast the huge deficit of quantitative data on individual mobility from underdeveloped regions.

We first compare the commuting networks extracted from the official census surveys of three European countries (Portugal, Spain and France) to the corresponding proxy networks extracted from three high-resolution datasets tracking the daily movements of millions of mobile phone users in each country. More specifically, we examine through a detailed statistical analysis the ability of mobile phone data to match the empirical commuting patterns reported by census surveys at different geographic scales. We then examine whether the observed discrepancies between the datasets affect the results of epidemic simulations. To this aim, we compare the outcomes of stochastic SIR epidemics simulated on a metapopulation model for recurrent mobility that is based either on the mobile phone commuting networks or the radiation model commuting networks, with respect to the epidemics simulated by integrating the census data. We evaluate how the simulated epidemic behavior depends on the underlying mobility source and on the spatial resolution scale considered, by investigating the time to first infection in each location and the invasion epidemic paths from the seed.",

The data allows us to identify the set of locations visited by each user (georeferenced in terms of tower cells) and to rank them according to the total number of calls placed by a user from each of them. Only users with more than 100 calls are included in the study, to enable the estimation of the individual's commuting mobility pattern. Since mobile phone trajectories clearly include different sorts of daily movements, we need therefore to extract commuter movements only for the comparison with census data, and disregard other types of displacement. Following previous work [22] , we assume that a user's residence corresponds to his/her most visited location, and that his/her workplace corresponds to the second most visited location, both identified in terms of placed calls. We performed a sensitivity analysis on this minimal assumption, by imposing in addition some constraints on the time of the call, to refine our identification of locations of residence and workplace (see Text S1 for additional details) [35, 38] . We thus define a commuting network at the level of cell sites, creating a directed link between each residence and workplace and assigning a weight equal to the total number of users that commute between the two locations. We coarse-grain the mobile phones commuting network from the tower cell scale to the country's administrative subdivisions for comparison with the census data (see Section 1.3 in Text S1 for additional details).

We explored the geographic coverage of the mobile phone dataset for the three countries (see the Analyses subsection for the corresponding methodology adopted).

Equation (1) assumes the knowledge of population data (N i , N j , P ij ) similarly to what we consider available for the census commuting networks and for the basic normalization of mobile phone mobility commuting fluxes, but it also requires additional information, i.e. the total number of residents who commute in each administrative unit. While the latter information may be easily accessible in developed countries, it is important to note that it may not be routinely collected or available in other regions. Given these quantities, the radiation model yields a commuting flux for each pair ij of administrative units of the country under study; after removing connections having w r ij v1, a synthetic commuting network at the given resolution scale is obtained. Previous works have already shown the ability of the radiation model to match census data well from the structural and traffic point of view, in a number of countries [18] . Additional comparisons between the radiation model and gravity models have been performed in the UK [39] . Here therefore we do not consider the radiation model in the comparison analysis of commuting networks and discuss instead its adequacy in the framework of spatial epidemic spreading.",

We assume the national population of every country to be spatially structured in subpopulations defined by the administrative subdivisions described in the previous subsection. We focus on rapid directly transmitted infections, such as influenza-like-illnesses, for which daily regular movements of individuals for commuting purposes were found to correlate well with the observed regional spread [12, 13] . We consider a simple SIR compartmental model [41] , where individuals can be either susceptible (S), infectious (I) or recovered (R) from the infection, assuming a life-long immunity for recovered individuals. The dynamics is discrete and stochastic and individuals are assumed to be homogeneously mixed within each subpopulation. No additional substructure of the population is considered (e.g. schools or workplaces), as our aim is to introduce a rather simple epidemic model to test the adequacy of different commuting sources for the simulation of ILI dissemination within a country. We therefore neglect unnecessary details that may hinder the interpretation of results. Subpopulations are coupled by directed weighted links representing the commuting fluxes between two locations, thus defining the metapopulation structure of the model [40, 41] . No other type of movement is considered.",

Once aggregated at a larger scale (i.e. the various administrative units under consideration), we obtain a population made of individuals living and working in the same unit (non-commuters) and of individuals commuting between two different units. While aggregation leads to a certain fraction of non-commuters, the resulting commuting behavior -expressed by the ratio of commuters vs. non-commuters -is anyway more pronounced likely because of the intrinsic assumption made on the original identification of home/work locations from the data. Different choices can be made that can improve the correct identification of home/work locations, leveraging on the availability of additional data. If timing of the call activity is provided, one possible refined definition would be to identify as home location the tower cell with the largest activity during nighttime, and the work location as the one with the largest activity constrained to daytime (with variations of the definition of these intervals) [32, 33, 38, 56] .

In Portugal, we observe larger fluctuations per region around the average national coverage than in other countries. Predictions for the invasion path obtained with mobile phones for epidemics starting in the capital of the country are not in good agreement with those obtained with census flows (Jv0:5, Figure 4 ). In this case, the central role of the capital, responsible for leading to higher similarity as discussed before, is reduced by the presence of larger (and overestimated) flows connecting less central regions in the mobile phone dataset. This leads to the creation of leaves stemming from peripheral nodes and infecting the closest neighbors, thus strongly reducing the role of the seed in infecting the large majority of nodes at the first generation of invasion. This phenomenon is effectively similar to the one encountered when the epidemic is seeded in a peripheral location.",

Increasingly sophisticated approaches can be developed that use iterative proportional fitting, fixing two marginal values that need to be assumed, i.e. the total numbers of incoming commuters and of outgoing commuters per location (or additional data, such as points of interest in the case of intra-city commuting) [60] .

We have no information on users' age in the mobile phone dataset, therefore movements for work or study are both tracked in users' trajectories. Commuting for study reasons is included in the Portuguese and French census data, whereas Spain reports about workflows only. The impact of not considering students' commuting in the Spanish case is however estimated to be rather low. Spanish data is indeed collected at a high administrative level (provinces), where students' commuting flows may be very weak given that they are usually more localized than those of workers. Data from France shows that 95% of students (aged,15) travel on distances less than 10 km [4] . To estimate the impact of missing students in the Spanish dataset on the province scale, we examined the fraction of commuter movements of students in the French census commuting network aggregated at the level of regions, i.e. similar to the size of Spanish provinces. In France, students represent about 10% of the total commuting flows across regions. If we assume a similar statistics for Spain too, such ratio is not sufficient to explain the discrepancy observed between the normalized mobile phone commuting flows and the census commuting flows in Spain (Table 1 ). In addition, the lack of a portion of individuals in the dataset (e.g. students) would have no impact when using the refined normalization because, in that case, the total number of commuters is set to be equal in both data sets by definition.",

In the case of France, the two datasets belong to the same year (2007). To assess the possible changes in commuting flows with time, we analyzed French yearly data between 2006 and 2009, given their availability (see Table S1 in Text S1). In three years, the total number of commuters in the country increased by about 3%, and every year, the total number of commuters increased by 1% or less. Assuming that similar trends apply to the other countries, we conclude that the total census commuting flows of Spain and Portugal may have increased by 2% and 5%, respectively, a difference being much smaller than the average discrepancy observed between census data and mobile phone data.",

Even if countries under consideration belong to a contiguous area in continental Europe, numerical simulations for the epidemic spread were performed for each country in isolation. This choice is driven by the lack of mobile phone data for cross-border movements (given their national nature), and by the negligible fraction of commuting across countries with respect to national commuting (about 780,000 people in the EU, including EEA/ EFTA, were cross-border commuters in the year 2006/2007 [61] over a total of more than 100 million national commuters). For the sake of completeness, we also checked our results against the inclusion of cross-border commuting in the census network of France, where international movements are predominant in a subset of districts (for instance, in those bordering Switzerland). Results reported in Text S1 show that including cross-border movements in the census commuting networks does not significantly alter the simulated epidemic patterns, keeping our conclusions unchanged.",

Also, long-term migration may play a more significant role than commuting movements in the spread of the polio virus. On the other hand, the concern for the emergence of new infectious diseases with pandemic potential, as in the recent cases of the H7N9 flu in China [64] and the MERS-CoV virus in the Middle East [65, 66] , is significant for developing countries as well, given they may have access to fewer resources for preparedness and control.
