Amapari (AMAV) and Tacaribe (TCRV), two nonpathogenic NW clade B arenaviruses that do not use human TfR1, are closely related to the NW arenaviruses that cause hemorrhagic fevers. Here we show that pseudotyped viruses bearing the surface glycoprotein (GP) of AMAV or TCRV can infect cells using the TfR1 orthologs of several mammalian species, including those of their respective natural hosts, the small rodent Neacomys spinosus and the fruit bat Artibeus jamaicensis. Mutation of one residue in human TfR1 makes it a functional receptor for TCRV, and mutation of four residues makes it a functional receptor for AMAV. Our data support an in vivo role for TfR1 in the replication of most, if not all, NW clade B arenaviruses, and suggest that with modest changes in their GPs the nonpathogenic arenaviruses could use human TfR1 and emerge as human pathogens.",

The family Arenaviridae comprises a single genus (Arenavirus) that contains at least 25 members [2] [3] [4] . Arenaviruses have been classified into two antigenically and geographically distinct groups, the Lassa-lymphocytic choriomeningitis serocomplex (''Old World arenaviruses'') and the Tacaribe serocomplex (''New World arenaviruses'') [5] [6] [7] . The New World (NW) arenavirus cluster is subdivided into clades A, B, and C. In addition, several North American viruses are recombination products of clades A and B (A/B) ( Figure 1 ). All NW arenaviruses that cause hemorrhagic fever in humans are in the B clade. These include the Jun\u00edn (JUNV), Machupo (MACV), Guanarito (GTOV), and Sabi\u00e1 (SABV) viruses, which respectively cause Argentine, Bolivian, Venezuelan, and Brazilian hemorrhagic fevers with high (10-30%) case fatality rates [2, 8, 9] . A novel NW clade B arenavirus, Chapare virus, was recently isolated from a fatal case of hemorrhagic fever in Bolivia [3] .",

Old World arenaviruses and NW clade C arenaviruses Oliveros and Latino use a-dystroglycan as an obligate receptor, while the pathogenic NW clade B arenaviruses MACV, JUNV, GTOV and SABV use human transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) to infect cells [30] [31] [32] [33] . The ability of NW clade B arenaviruses to cause disease in humans correlates with the utilization of human TfR1, a molecule that has several properties favorable to arenaviral replication and viral hemorrhagic fevers; it is rapidly endocytosed into acidic compartments, expressed on endothelial cells, and upregulated on rapidly dividing cells including activated lymphocytes [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] . We have previously shown that recombinant retroviral particles pseudotyped with the GPs of MACV, JUNV, or GTOV efficiently use the TfR1 ortholog of the rodent hosts of these viruses [39] .",

Here, we confirm that AMAV and TCRV do not use human TfR1, and show that they nonetheless efficiently use the TfR1 orthologs of their respective animal hosts, N. spinosus and A. jamaicensis. We also show that mutation of one residue converts human TfR1 into an efficient receptor for TCRV, and replacement of four residues with those found in N. spinosus TfR1 converts human TfR1 into an efficient receptor for AMAV. These data show that TfR1 has an important role in the replication of nonpathogenic NW arenaviruses, and suggest that subtle changes in the GPs of TCRV and AMAV might adapt them to use human TfR1.",

We show here that two of these nonpathogenic viruses, Amapari and Tacaribe, can use animal orthologs of TfR1 to infect cells. We observe that recombinant viruses coated with the entry proteins of Amapari and Tacaribe viruses use the TfR1 orthologs of their natural reservoirs. Modest alteration of human TfR1 converts it to an efficient receptor for Amapari and Tacaribe viruses.

This loop includes tyrosine 211, which is essential for MACV, JUNV, and GTOV to use human TfR1 [39] . We compared the sequences of ZbTfR1, NsTfR1, and AjTfR1 in this region with that of human TfR1, and found several differences between human and animal TfR1 ( Figure 6A and 6B). We sought to determine whether replacing the human TfR1 residues with their equivalents from animal TfR1 orthologs would allow the modified human TfR1 to serve as a receptor for AMAV and TCRV pseudoviruses. Figure 6A shows a panel of eleven human TfR1 variants that were examined. In the first two variants (zh1 and zh2), residues from human TfR1 were replaced with those from ZbTfR1. Four variants (ah2 through ah5) include residues from AjTfR1, and five variants (nh2, nh4, nh5, nh7 and nh8) include NsTfR1 sequence. These variants were expressed in HEK293T cells, and the cells were incubated with TCRV or AMAV pseudoviruses. A variant (zh1) containing two alterations -R208G and DV210 -was an efficient receptor for TCRV ( Figure 6C ). As expected from comparison with zh1, a variant (ah2) containing three AjTfR1 residues in place of human TfR1 residues 208-210 (R208G, L209A, and V210G) was a functional receptor for TCRV ( Figure 6D ). When mutations at R208 and V210 were individually introduced into human TfR1, the variant containing V210G (ah4) supported TCRV pseudovirus entry efficiently, while the variant containing R208G (ah3) was a less efficient receptor. Deletion of V210 (ah5), however, did not convert human TfR1 into a receptor for TCRV. A slightly larger alteration in human TfR1 was necessary for AMAV pseudovirus infection; nh5, which contains four mutations -D204N, K205S, R208G, and DV210 -or nh8, which contains five mutations, were efficient receptors for AMAV ( Figure 6E ). The entry of VSV pseudovirus was unaffected by the introduction of any of the variants. Thus, only minimal alteration of human TfR1 was sufficient for it to serve as an efficient receptor for the nonpathogenic viruses AMAV and TCRV.",

Here we have studied the two best characterized of these viruses, TCRV and AMAV. The GP sequences of these viruses are more similar to those of the pathogenic viruses than they are to each other (Figure 1 ). In spite of the similarity of AMAV and TCRV to the other members of their respective subclades, these nonpathogenic viruses do not utilize human TfR1. In contrast, every clade B virus shown to use human TfR1 causes a South American hemorrhagic fever [24, [32] [33] [34] [35] . There is thus a close correlation between use of human TfR1 and the ability of a NW arenavirus to cause severe human disease. A possible exception is the Whitewater Arroyo virus (WWAV), a NW clade A/B arenavirus that does not appear to use human TfR1, but is tentatively associated with three human fatalities in 1999-2000 [45, 46] . Follow up studies by the CDC, however, failed to find any evidence of WWAV infection in the human tissues mentioned in the original article (Nichol, personal communication). In addition, there have been no further reports of WWAV infection being associated with human disease.",

Our findings shed light on this issue; TCRV and AMAV pseudoviruses efficiently utilize the TfR1 orthologs of several species including those of their native hosts, A. jamaicensis and N. spinosus, respectively (Figures 3 and 4) . As with the pathogenic clade B viruses, AMAV and TCRV utilized most efficiently the TfR1 ortholog of their natural hosts.

We swapped residues in a loop in the apical domain of TfR1 that is a key determinant of host specificity ( Figure 6) . Surprisingly, alteration of a single residue (V210G, ah4) allowed human TfR1 to efficiently support the entry of TCRV pseudovirus, while replacement of four residues in this loop with the corresponding residues of NsTfR1 (nh5) was necessary to support efficient infection by AMAV pseudovirus (Figure 6D and 6E). Although these alterations are made to the receptor, it is reasonable to infer that similarly modest changes in the arenaviral GPs would also permit efficient use of human TfR1. For example, in order to bind human TfR1, TCRV GP would only need to acquire mutations that accommodate V210, present in human TfR1 but absent or replaced by a glycine in animal TfR1 orthologs. Our data, although limited, suggest that small alterations in the arenaviral GP could convert these nonpathogenic NW arenaviruses into human pathogens.",

Similarly, the adaptation of avian influenza viruses to humans is thought to require as few as two amino acid substitutions in the influenza hemagglutinin glycoprotein (HA). These mutations allow HA to bind its human receptor, a2,6 -linked sialosides [48, 49] . Structural studies of the SARS-CoV and influenza A virus entry proteins in complex with their respective receptors have helped to identify and predict entry protein alterations that contribute to the ability of these viruses to cause human disease [48, 50] .

Although TCRV was isolated from bats [19] , the suggestion that Artibeus species bats serve as the natural hosts for TCRV has been questioned [53] . Our observation that AjTfR1 is an efficient receptor for TCRV, and also for JUNV and MACV, supports a role for bats in sustaining the replication of arenaviruses. Ecological surveys of bats for novel arenaviruses are thus warranted, and may afford further insight into the diversity of arenaviruses. In addition, although cats experimentally infected with MACV do not become ill [54] , viral titers in these animals were not determined. The finding that feline TfR1 supports the entry of AMAV and the pathogenic clade B arenaviruses thus highlights a possible role for cats in serving as intermediate hosts in the transmission of NW arenaviruses to humans [39, 40] .",

This observation suggests that these viruses can use more than one receptor, and raises the possibility that the pathogenic clade B arenaviruses may also use an additional receptor [40] . Indeed, certain strains of the Old World arenavirus lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) use both a-dystroglycan dependent and independent pathways to infect cells [55] . An alternative receptor may substitute for TfR1, or function downstream of TfR1 in a manner analogous to the HIV-1 coreceptors. Identification of such a receptor on human cells will likely broaden our understanding of the entry mechanisms of a number of NW arenaviruses.",

The plasmids expressing the TfR1 orthologs of F. domesticus (cat) and C. familiaris (dog) were generously provided by Colin Parrish (Cornell University, Ithaca, NY). TfR1 genes for Neacomys spinosus and Artibeus jamaicensis were cloned from frozen heart and kidney, and liver tissues, respectively. Deposited sequences in GenBank (FJ154604 and FJ154605) cross-reference to catalog numbers of the Museum of Southwestern Biology, University of New Mexico from where these specimens were obtained. RNA was isolated from these tissues using RNAqueous (Ambion), and cDNA was generated by SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis system for RT-PCR (Invitrogen). PCR primers used to amplify the genes for both NsTfR1 or AjTfR1 orthologs are: sense 59 ATGATGGATCAAGCCAGATCAGCAWT-CTCT 39 and anti-sense 59 AAAYTCATTGTCAATGTCC-CAAAYGTCACCA 39. These genes, fused with a C-terminal flag tag, were cloned into the pcDNA3.1 expression vector (Invitrogen). Amino acid substitutions in human TfR1 were performed using the QuikChange method for site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene).",

HEK293T cells or CHO cells were transfected with plasmids expressing various TfR1 orthologs, and at 24 hr, the cells were replated for flow cytometry and infection. At 48 hr post-transfection, TfR1 expression levels were assessed by flow cytometry using an a-flag M2 antibody. In parallel, cells were infected with the indicated pseudoviruses for 2 hours. Twenty-four (HEK293T cells) or forty-eight (CHO cells) hours after infection, the cells were detached with trypsin and the GFP expression levels were measured by flow cytometry, and normalized to that of mock-transfected cells. Values are the average of 2-5 duplicated experiments.",

Infections and immunofluorescence staining were performed as described previously [32] . Briefly, HEK293 cells growing on gelatin-treated glass coverslips were transfected with plasmids encoding AjTfR1, NsTfR1, or human TfR1. Thirty-six hours later, these cells were infected with TCRV or AMAV at a multiplicity of infection of 2.0. At 12 hr post-infection, the cells were washed, fixed with 3% formaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 and incubated with mouse hyperimmune sera specific for NW arenaviruses. Cells were then washed and incubated with a FITC-conjugated secondary antibody.",
