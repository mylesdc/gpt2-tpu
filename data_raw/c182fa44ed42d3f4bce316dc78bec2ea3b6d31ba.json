Codon usage bias analysis can reveal much about the molecular evolution and host adaption of ZIKV. To gain insight into the evolutionary characteristics of ZIKV, we performed a comprehensive analysis on the codon usage pattern in 46 ZIKV strains by calculating the effective number of codons (ENc), codon adaptation index (CAI), relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU), and other indicators. The results indicate that the codon usage bias of ZIKV is relatively low. Several lines of evidence support the hypothesis that translational selection plays a role in shaping the codon usage pattern of ZIKV. The results from a correspondence analysis (CA) indicate that other factors, such as base composition, aromaticity, and hydrophobicity may also be involved in shaping the codon usage pattern of ZIKV. Additionally, the results from a comparative analysis of RSCU between ZIKV and its hosts suggest that ZIKV tends to evolve codon usage patterns that are comparable to those of its hosts. Moreover, selection pressure from Homo sapiens on the ZIKV RSCU patterns was found to be dominant compared with that from Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. Taken together, both natural translational selection and mutation pressure are important for shaping the codon usage pattern of ZIKV. Our findings contribute to understanding the evolution of ZIKV and its adaption to its hosts.",

This virus was first isolated from a blood sample of a Rhesus monkey in Uganda in 1947 and, before its outbreak in Oceania in 2007, it was confined to Africa and Southeast Asia [1] . Since then, ZIKV has been circulating in the Americas, and in May 2015, the first case of ZIKV originating from the Americas was reported in Brazil. Thus far, ZIKV has expanded from South America to more than 28 countries and has aroused the attention of the World Health Organization (WHO) as well as that of many governments [2, 3] . Clinical presentation of ZIKV fever is non-specific; the most common symptoms are rash, fever, arthralgia, myalgia, asthenia, and conjunctivitis. ZIKV is thought to be transmitted to humans mainly the frequency of the nucleotide Y, and f xy the frequency of the dinucleotide XY. As a criterion, If \u03c1 xy >1.23 or <0.78, the XY dinucleotide is considered to be over-represented or under-represented compared with a random association of mononucleotides [22] .",

RSCU was employed to investigate the overall synonymous codon usage bias among the genes, and this value was defined as the ratio of the observed codon usage to the expected value [23] .

Codons used at an average level (no bias) have the RSCU values of 1 [24] . In our comparison of the ZIKV codon usage pattern with those of its hosts, if the RSCU value for the polyprotein-coding region of ZIKV and that of the same codon for the host were both <0.6, >1.6, or between 0.6 and 1.6, their codon usage patterns were judged to be similar [25] .

Interestingly, the role of the translational selection from H. sapiens in shaping the codon usage pattern of ZIKV is different from that of its insect hosts (A. aegypti and A. albopictus). Compared with the codon usage pattern of A. aegypti or A. albopictus, the codon usage pattern of ZIKV is more similar to that of H. sapiens. This discrepancy of similarity in the degree of codon usage between ZIKV and its hosts may be caused by the various defense mechanisms from different hosts against ZIKV infection. Indeed, a recent study indicated that skin immune cells, including fibroblasts, epidermal keratinocytes, and immature dendritic cells, are highly permissive to ZIKV infection and replication, which can lead to the activation of an antiviral innate immune response [39] . Another study found that although A. aegypti and A. albopictus are susceptible to ZIKV infection, they are both low-competent vectors for ZIKV [40] . It is presumed that the evolution of the flavivirus genome sequence involved in anti-host countermeasures may be faster than that of other flavivirus sequence [41] . This may be one reason why the codon usage pattern of ZIKV tends to show more similarities to that of H. sapiens.",

Therefore, we determined the relative abundance of 16 dinucleotides in ZIKV polyprotein-coding regions. The results show that the occurrences of dinucleotides in ZIKV are not randomly distributed and no dinucleotide is present at the expected frequency (Table 3) . Specially, the dinucleotides UG and CA are over-represented (\u03c1 xy > 1.23) while UA and CG are markedly under-represented (\u03c1 xy < 0.78). These data is consistent with previous study, which suggested that the dinucleotides UA and CG are under-represented in many sequence sets [21] . Moreover, the analysis of RSCU values of the eight codons containing CG (UCG, CCG, ACG, GCG, CGU, CGC, CGA, and CGC) suggests that these codons are not preferentially used. Meanwhile, in case of UA containing codons, most of codons are not preferentially selected, except for UAC. Taken together, the composition of dinucleotides plays a role in the synonymous codon usage pattern of ZIKV. The relative abundance of dinucleotides has been shown to influence the codon usage in some RNA viruses [42] . In our study, we found the relative low abundances of CpG and UpA in ZIKV, which may be beneficial for the virus to escape the host anti-viral immune response and complete virus transcription reaction efficiently [43] . The unmethylated CpG can be recognized by the host innate immune system as a pathogen signature, and activates various immune response pathways [42, 44] . UpA deficiency was proposed to avail virus by reducing the risk of nonsense mutations, minimizing the improper transcription and decreasing the opportunities of cleavage by RNase L [45] . ",

The positions of each polyprotein-coding region defined by the first axis (Axis 1) and second axis (Axis 2) are shown in Fig 2. The first axis accounts for 72.93% of the total variation, and the second, third and fourth axes account for 8.99%, 6.33%, and 3.08%, respectively, of the total variation in synonymous codon usage. A correlation analysis also showed that, except G content, the Axis1 is positively correlated with the contents of A, U, A3s, U3s, whereas it is negatively correlated with the GC3s, GC, ENc, C, C3s and G3s (Table 5) .

If a gene is subject to the GC compositional constraints, it will lie on or near Analysis of Codon Usage Bias of ZIKV the theoretical fitting curve that represents random codon usage. In contrast, if a gene is subject to translational selection, it will lie considerably below the expected curve [46] . Here, the ENc value of each polyprotein-coding region of ZIKV was plotted against the corresponding GC3s content (Fig 3) . The resulting points lie considerably below the solid curve, implying that, in addition to mutation pressure, other factors, such as translational selection, also influence the codon usage pattern of ZIKV. This result is generally similar to the related plot in previous study [34] . The base composition and codon usage bias of the ORFs of a species with an A/U-rich genome may be different from those species with G/C-rich genomes. Previous studies have employed a correlation between CAI values and ENc values to demonstrate the effect of mutation and translational selection on the codon usage bias [37, 47] . If the correlation (r) between the two indices approaches -1, this suggests that the translational selection is preferred over mutation. Otherwise, if the r value approaches 0 (no correlation), mutation may be more influential than translational selection. Our results showed that the CAI value of ZIKV is significantly positively correlated with the ENc value (r = -0.749, P<0.01) (Fig 4) . This result reflects the influence of both translational selection and mutation pressure on the codon usage pattern of ZIKV. A significant correlation between the GC12 and GC3 values is regarded to indicate that the mutation pressure dominates over the translational selection pressure in shaping the codon usage bias [22, 46] . If the correlation between GC12 and GC3 is significant, the mutation pressure is regarded as the main force forming the codon usage bias. To further determine the role of mutation pressure and translational selection in shaping the codon usage bias of ZIKV, a correlation analysis was performed to analyze the relationship between GC12 and GC3. There was no significant correlation observed between them (r = 0.25, P>0.05), suggesting that both translational selection and the mutation pressure are involved in shaping the codon usage pattern of ZIKV (Fig 5) .",

Other factors, such as base composition, aromaticity, and hydrophobicity, also have an effect on the codon usage pattern. Importantly, there are similarities between the codon usage patterns of ZIKV and its natural hosts. This study not only provides an understanding about the variation in ZIKV codon usage patterns, but it also contributes to understanding the factors that drive ZIKV evolution.",
