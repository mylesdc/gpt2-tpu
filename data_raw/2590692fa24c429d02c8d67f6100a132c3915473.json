In the first series of compounds, PQ and various CADs were connected by amide bonds and in the second series by acylsemicarbazide functional groups built from the PQ amino group, CONHNH spacer and the carbonyl group originating from the CADs. PQ-CAD amides 3a-k were prepared by a simple one-step condensation reaction of PQ with a series of CAD chlorides (method A) or benzotriazolides 2 (method B). The synthesis of acylsemicarbazides 7a-k included activation of PQ with benzotriazole, preparation of PQ-semicarbazide 6 and its condensation with CAD chlorides 4. All synthesized PQ-CAD conjugates were evaluated for their anticancer, antiviral and antioxidative activities. Almost all compounds from series 3 were selective towards the MCF-7 cell line and active at micromolar concentrations. The o-fluoro derivative 3h showed high activity against HeLa, MCF-7 and in particular against the SW 620 cell line, while acylsemicarbazide 7f with a benzodioxole ring and 7c, 7g and especially 7j with methoxy-, chloro-or trifluoromethyl-substituents in the para position showed high selectivity and high inhibitory activity against MCF-7 cell line at micromolar (7c, 7f, 7g) and nanomolar (7j) levels. Acylsemicarbazide derivatives with trifluoromethyl group(s) 7i, 7j and 7k showed specific activity against human coronavirus (229E) at concentrations which did not alter the normal cell morphology. The same compounds exerted the most potent reducing activity in the DPPH test, together with 7d and 7g, while methoxy (compounds 7c-e), benzodioxole (7f), p-Cl (7g) and m-CF 3 (7i) acylsemicarbazides and amide 3f presented the highest LP inhibition (83%-89%). The dimethoxy derivative 7d was the most potent LOX inhibitor (IC 50 = 10 \u00b5M). The performed biological tests gave evidence of acylsemicarbazide functional group as superior binding group in PQ-CAD conjugates.",

            "text": "The molecular hybridization approach based on the combination of the pharmacophoric moieties of different compounds was used to produce new hybrid molecules with cinnamic acid derivatives (CADs) and primaquine (PQ) motifs. Cinnamic acid (CA, trans-3-phenylacrylic acid, trans-3-phenyl-2-propenoic acid) and its derivatives are naturally occurring substances found in various plants. They are important intermediates in biosynthetic pathways of secondary metabolites, which play key roles in plant growth, development, reproduction and disease resistance [1] . Numerous research papers report various pharmacological activities of CADs [2, 3] . First of all, they exhibit strong antimicrobial, antifungal and antiviral activity [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . A review on natural and synthetic CADs with antimicrobial activity has been recently published [1] . CADs show good to moderate antitubercular activity or synergistic activity with antitubercular drugs [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . Many CADs, especially those with phenolic hydroxyl groups, are well-known antioxidants and are supposed to have several health benefits due to their strong free radical scavenging properties [14] [15] [16] . Methoxy substituted cinnamates play an important role in controlling inflammatory diseases [17] , while methoxy substituted octylcinnamates are efficient sunscreen agents [18] . 3-Hydroxy, 4-hydroxy and 3,4-dihydroxy CADs possess hepatoprotective [19] and hypolipidemic activity [20, 21] , while halogenated derivatives have CNS depressant activity [22] . Some amides derived from CA are potential antimalarial leads [23] . N-cinnamoyl chloroquine, PQ, aminoacridines and 4-aminoquinoline derivatives are reported as dual-action antimalarials and antiproliferative agents [24] [25] [26] [27] . Anticancer potential of piplartine, a CA alkaloid/imide derivative from peppers, and various CADs have been reported in numerous papers and reviewed by Bezerra [28] and De and co-workers [29] . Finally, CA motifs are present in several approved antiallergic drugs, such as cinnarizine, cinaserin and tranilast and antiplatelet agent ozagrel [30] .",

The most active compounds have one or more aromatic rings attached to a PQ scaffold via nitrogen-and oxygen-rich spacers (urea, carbamate, hydroxyurea, double urea). The literature survey showed that hydroxysemicarbazides are potential antitumor agents as well [48] . In the light of the above considerations, we have designed a series of hybrid molecules with cinnamoyl residue as the aromatic component bound by amide or acylsemicarbazide functionality to PQ pharmacophore. Our new series of PQ derivatives differ from the previous ones both in the aromatic region and in the type of spacers. The present study reports the synthesis and characterization of PQ-CAD conjugates and their evaluation as potential anticancer and antiviral agents. The chemopreventive potential on carcinogenesis, inhibition of lipoxygenase as a marker of anti-inflammatory activity and antioxidative ability of PQ-CAD were evaluated as well.",

Amide derivatives 3a-k showed weak activity against L1210 and CEM, and no activity on H460 cell line. Most of the compounds of series 3 were inactive against SW 620. However, 3a and 3i showed mild and 3h very strong activity (IC 50 0.3 \u00b1 0.1 \u00b5M) against the same cell line. Activity against HeLa varied very much: derivatives 3a and 3h showed strong activity in low micromolar concentration (IC 50 4.0 \u00b1 0.9 and 2.1 \u00b1 2.1 \u00b5M, respectively), while the other amide derivatives were either inactive (3c-e) or their activity was very weak (the rest of the compounds in series 3) ( Table 2) . MCF-7 was the most susceptible tumor cell line. Practically all compounds 3 were active in low micromolar concentrations. Again, the most active was the o-fluoro derivative 3h (IC 50 1.1 \u00b1 0.6 \u00b5M). Acylsemicarbazide derivatives 7a-k were more active than amide derivatives and more or less active against all the tested cell lines and, in general, very active against MCF-7. Four compounds, 7c, 7g, 7f and 7j, showed very strong activity against MCF-7 and variable activity against the other tested cell lines. It is interesting to note that three of the most active PQ-CAD derivatives bear substituent in para position (methoxy, chloro and trifluoromethyl, respectively). The most active compound was trifluoromethyl derivative 7j with IC 50 in nanomolar scale (30 \u00b1 20 nM). This derivative exerted 100-to 500-fold higher activity than the anticancer reference drugs and 900-fold higher activity than PQ.",

Compounds of series 3 were inactive towards all tested viruses, while acylsemicarbazide derivatives 7b, 7f (EC 50 = 15 .0 and 12.5 \u00b5M, respectively), 7i, 7j and 7k (EC 50 = 7.9-9.5 \u00b5M) showed moderate activity against human coronavirus (229E), but three or two fold lower activity than UDA (EC 50 = 4 .0 \u00b5M). These compounds did not alter normal cell morphology in confluent HEL cell cultures at 100 \u00b5M concentration (data not shown): selectivity ratio (SI) (MCC to EC 50 ratio, e.g., ratio of minimum cytotoxic concentration (concentration that causes a microscopically detectable alteration of normal cell morphology) and concentration required to reduce virus-induced cytopathogenicity by 50%) was close to ten. It is worth mentioning that the three most active compounds contain trifluoromethyl group: 7i (m-CF 3 , EC 50 = 7.9 \u00b5M), 7j (p-CF 3 , EC 50 = 9 .5 \u00b5M), 7k (two m-CF 3 , EC 50 = 8.4 \u00b5M), while halogen and methoxy derivatives were inactive. Therefore, one can conclude that acylsemicarbazide functional group and the presence of CF 3 motif may be responsible for enhancing antiviral activity against human coronavirus. These findings could be useful in further structural optimization.",

Trifluoromethyl derivatives 7j, 7k, 7i, and dimethoxy 7d and chloro derivative 7g showed the highest reducing activity within the dataset. Perusal of RA values (3a < 7a, 3b < 7b, etc.) supported the fact that keeping the rest structural characteristics the same, the presence of acylsemicarbazide functional group was correlated with higher antioxidant activity.",

            "text": "In the acylsemicarbazide series 7, the attachment of CF 3 group(s) on the cinnamic ring enhanced the antioxidant ability. The presence of two vicinal methoxy groups (m, p) lead to higher activity, compared to the presence of single methoxy group (7d > 7c). On the contrary, the third methoxy group diminished the activity (7e), probably due to steric reasons (bulky radical DPPH could not approach and interact). Replacement of the phenyl ring by a benzo[d] [1, 3] dioxole increased activity (7f > 7a). The nature and/or position of the halogen atom on the cinnamic ring affected the antioxidant potency. Thus, p-Cl derivative 7g was found more potent than o-F 7h. For both groups of compounds no correlation between overall lipophilicity and activity was found (Tables 1 and 3 ). However, hydrophilic contribution of the spacer seems to play a more significant role (log P 3a < 7a, 3b < 7b, etc.)",

In order to diminish the pro-cancerous mechanisms, a key treatment strategy is to reduce the free radical load. Antioxidant activity by scavenging of reactive oxygen species is important in preventing potential damage of cellular compounds such as DNA, proteins and lipids. Moreover, it has been found that LOX inhibitors may have chemopreventive activity in lung carcinogenesis [55] . Reports published over the past three decades support a growth-regulatory role of arachidonic acid metabolites in the etiology of mammary carcinogenesis [56] . Studies have demonstrated that levels of several eicosanoids are increased in breast cancer in comparison to benign breast tumours [56] . In this context, we evaluated the newly prepared PQ-CAD conjugates for their ability to inhibit soybean lipoxygenase (LOX). From the tested compounds, all amides 3, with the exception of 3j, were inactive (10%-45% at 100 \u00b5M). However, acylsemicarbazides 7 exhibited significant activity in LOX inhibition assay (IC 50 values 10-100 \u00b5M). Dimethoxy derivative 7d was the most potent inhibitor with an IC 50 value of 10 \u00b5M (double as the concentration of the reference compound NDGA), followed by 7j and 7h. The compounds with high log P values were not active, so the idea that lipophilicity was an important physicochemical property for LOX inhibition was not supported. Our results indicated that LOX inhibition is accompanied and correlated with antilipid peroxidation and DPPH radical scavenging activity. In general, the presence of acylsemicarbazide moiety in PQ-CAD conjugates led to hybrids with better biological response.",
