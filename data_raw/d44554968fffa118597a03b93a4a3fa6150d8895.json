Thus, a rapid and reliable method is required for epidemiological investigations and to evaluate the effect of immunization. However, the current diagnostic methods for PEDV are time-consuming and very expensive and rarely meet the requirements for clinical application. Nanobodies have been used in the clinic to overcome these problems because of the advantages of their easy expression and high level of stability. In the present work, a novel biotinylated nanobody-based blocking ELISA (bELISA) was developed to detect anti-PEDV antibodies in clinical pig serum.",

Then, purified Nb2-Avi-tag fusion protein was biotinylated in vitro. A novel bELISA was subsequently developed for the first time with biotinylated Nb2. The cutoff value for bELISA was 29.27%. One hundred and fifty clinical serum samples were tested by both newly developed bELISA and commercial kits. The sensitivity and specificity of bELISA were 100% and 93.18%, respectively, and the coincidence rate between the two methods was 94%.",

One of the four structural proteins, the N protein, which is associated with viral replication, transcription and assembly, is a basic internal phosphoprotein important for inducing cell-mediated immunity in the host [8, 9] . Pigs produce high levels of antibodies against the N protein in the early stages of PEDV infection [6, 8] . Anti-N protein IgG antibodies were first detected on day 7 post infection, so the PEDV N protein is the best candidate antigen for early diagnosis because this gene is highly conserved [10] .",

Since the clinical signs and histological changes in PED and other diarrheal diseases, such as transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE), are similar, they cannot be diagnosed without molecular methods and immunoassays [11, 12] . Conventional PEDV diagnostic methods are based on laboratory tests and include virus isolation, conventional reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) [13, 14] , real-time RT-PCR [15] [16] [17] , indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) assay [18] and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [19] . However, these conventional methods are time-consuming, and expensive, exhibit low specificity and sensitivity, and require welltrained technicians and special instruments. Moreover, issues such as false-positive results may arise from crosscontamination between samples or transportation delays [20] . Currently, different types of ELISAs, including indirect [19, 21] , competitive and blocking ELISA, have been widely applied to detect PEDV in large-scale blood or feces samples, but these assays are based on the use of PEDV-specific monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies that require more support cost and exhibit low expression yields and high levels of instability [22] .",

Nanobodies, also termed the variable domain of heavy-chain only antibody (VHH), were surprising discovered in the sera of camelids, such as llamas, dromedaries, camels, alpaca and vicuna [23, 24] . Nanobodies are also the smallest antibodies with complete antigen-binding sites [25] . The single-domain nature of nanobodies due to their lack of light chains confers many special properties not observed in conventional antibodies: including high affinity, thermal stability and high yield in microbial production systems [26, 27] . Moreover, because the molecular weights of nanobodies are only approximately 15 kDa and they are associated with concave epitopes, nanobodies might be better adapted to access hidden targets and cryptic sites than antibodies [22] . Based on these unique features, nanobodies hold great potential as candidates for diverse biomedical applications, such as disease diagnosis and therapeutics [28] .",

Moreover, to obtain soluble nanobodies with high diversity and affinity, 98 clones randomly selected from each round were screened for PEDV N protein by periplasmic extraction followed by phage ELISA. The diversity of the ELISA-positive colonies was determined by sequencing. Plasmids were extracted from 19 clones that exhibited a positive reaction compared with that of the negative control (Fig. 2) and analyzed by sequencing. According to the amino acid sequence of the three highly variable complementary determination regions (CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3) of the clones, the nanobodies were divided into three groups: Nb1, Nb2, and Nb3 (Fig. 3) . The complementary determination regions contained the typical hydrophilic amino acid substitutions in the framework of relatively conservative FR2, including a G/E substitution at position 44 of the three nanobodies and V/F, L/R and W/G substitution at positions 37, 45, and 47 of Nb1 respectively. In addition, the CDR1 and CDR3 regions of Nb1 also contained cysteine residues, which can form disulfide bonds, contribute to the formation of a ring structure and play an important role in stabilizing the structure of the antigen-binding region of the nanobody. This explains the absence of an interaction with the VL domain as well as the high solubility of VHH as a single-domain fragment [32, 33] .",

The titers of three nanobodies and the unrelated nanobody Nb12 were also determined to further assess their binding activity, which indicated that Nb2 has a higher binding activity than Nb1 and Nb3 (Additional file 1: Fig. S3B ).

Notably, the specificity and sensitivity of ELISA were also determined by antibody probe. Currently, the two most commonly used antibody-probes in ELISA are horseradish peroxidase (HPR) and biotin [22, 26, 38] . There is a strong affinity between biotin and streptavidin (SA); one SA molecule can specifically bind four molecules of biotin [36, 39] . In addition, the biotin-SA complex can resist harsh environmental elements, such as proteolytic enzymes, organic solvents, and extreme temperature and pH [22] . Because of its favorable properties, the biotin-SA system is used extensively in diagnostic and therapeutic functions. Therefore, we biotinylated Nb2, a purified nanobody, fused to Avi-tag, using biotin ligase in vitro. Then, we established a new bioNb-based blocking ELISA for the detection of antibodies against PEDV.",

Among those nanobodies, Nb2 showed good specificity and binding activity. Furthermore, a novel, rapid, specific, and lowcost blocking ELISA was developed based on biotinylated Nb2 that can be applied to assess clinical serum samples. This is the first reported case of a nanobody against PEDV and its practical application; therefore, the bELISA may become a promising diagnostic kit for the detection of PEDV antiserum in pig farms.
