For humans, exposure to infected birds can cause conjunctivitis and influenza-like symptoms. NDV infections in mammals are rarely reported. In this study, using next-generation sequencing, an NDV was identified and isolated from Vero cells inoculated with the nasal swab of an aborted dromedary fetus in Dubai, during the time when an NDV outbreak occurred in a pigeon farm located in close proximity to the dairy camel farm where the mother of the aborted dromedary fetus resided, and there were a lot of pigeons in the camel farm. Genome analysis revealed that the structurally and functionally important features of other NDVs were also present in this dromedary NDV genome. Phylogenetic analysis based on the nucleotide sequences of fusion protein (F), hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein (HN) and complete polyprotein showed that the virus belonged to sub-genotype VIg of class II NDV and is most closely related to pigeon NDVs in Egypt in the same year. The present study is the first that demonstrated isolation of NDV in dromedaries. Further study is warranted to investigate the relationship between NDV infection and abortion.",

It is an avian virus causing high morbidities and mortalities in most species of wild and domestic birds globally and is associated with major economic loss in poultry farms worldwide [1] . Transmission of the virus occurs through exposure to the fecal materials and other excretions of infected birds or contaminated food, water and equipment [1] [2] [3] [4] . In birds, NDV mainly causes diseases in the respiratory, neurological, and gastrointestinal systems. Occasionally, NDV has also caused infections in mammals, such as cattle, sheep, and mink [5] [6] [7] . In 1952, NDV was isolated from the lung of a six-month-old calf with pneumonia in the United States [7] . In 2012, it was isolated from the blood of two apparently healthy sheep in India [6] . In 2017, it was isolated from an outbreak of hemorrhagic encephalitis and pneumonia in domestic mink from mainland China [5] . For humans, exposure to infected birds can cause mild self-limiting conjunctivitis and influenza-like symptoms.",

Based on the complete coding sequence of the F protein [8] [9] [10] [11] , NDV strains are classified into class I and class II, with class II NDVs being more diverse, and are further classified into genotypes I to XVIII. In terms of pathogenicity, NDVs can be categorized into velogenic (virulent), mesogenic (intermediate), or lentogenic (non-virulent), which have been linked to their virulence in chickens or the presence of conserved amino acids in the F and HN proteins which are known to be involved in pathogenesis of NDV infection, such as virus attachment, host-cell membrane fusion, virus dissemination, and F protein activation [12] .",

This suggested that haemagglutination protein binding receptor was also present on the membrane of camel red blood cells, implicating that camel may be susceptible to NDV infection [13] . In this article, we report the first isolation of NDV from the aborted fetus of a dromedary in the United Arab Emirates during the process of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) screening, and results of its comparative genome and phylogenetic analysis.",

In the present study, we isolated an NDV from the nasal swab of an aborted dromedary fetus in Dubai using Vero cells, and the virus isolate also produced the typical CPE caused by NDV on chicken embryo fibroblasts. During that period, an NDV outbreak occurred in the pigeon farm located in close proximity to the dairy camel farm where the mother of the aborted dromedary fetus resided and there were a lot of pigeons in the camel farm. We speculate that the mother dromedary had probably acquired the NDV from the pigeons and subsequently transmitted to the fetus. Whole genome sequencing and comparative genome analysis revealed that the structurally and functionally important features in the F and HN proteins of the NDV genome observed in previous studies were also present in the genome of this NDV in dromedary. In particular, it also possessed genomic features similar to other velogenic NDVs, including cleavage site motif 112 KRQKRF 117 in the F protein, conserved amino acid residues at neutralizing epitopes on the HN protein, and the size (i.e., 571 aa) of the HN protein (Tables 1-3 , Figures S1 and S2) [30, 31] . On the other hand, we were aware of the limitation of the present study. Viral cultures on other samples of the fetus or the mother were not performed because it was initially intended for MERS-CoV isolation. It is noteworthy that a virus that could be successfully cultured and isolated from Vero cells was subjected to investigation by next-generation sequencing. This suggested that any potential pathogens that were not able to propagate in the Vero cells may have been missed. Nevertheless, although the possibility of NDV infection being responsible for abortion is unknown, the successful isolation of NDV from the aborted dromedary fetus and the absence of positive bacterial and fungal cultures in the placental samples warrant further investigations on the causal relationship between NDV infection and abortion.",

            "text": "The present dromedary NDV was probably resulted from spillover from NDVs in birds of the Middle East. NDVs of class II genotype VI were first isolated from pigeons in the Middle East in the 1960s and spread rapidly throughout Northern Africa to Europe and other parts of the world [11, 32] . So far, NDVs of genotype VI have been identified in at least 20 countries of three different continents, including Africa, Europe, and Asia [10, 32] . In addition to their widespread distribution, genotype VI NDVs is also highly diverse genetically, dividing into sub-genotypes VIa to Vim [8] [9] [10] [11] 32] . In 2015, NDVs of sub-genotype VIg were detected in apparently healthy pigeons kept in captivity in Egypt [32] . Phylogenetic analysis showed that the NDV isolated from the aborted dromedary fetus in the present study belongs to sub-genotype VIg and is most closely related to the NDVs found in these healthy pigeons from Egypt in the same year ( Figure 2 . In fact, whole genome comparative analysis revealed that there is only 2.5-5.3% difference in the nucleotide sequence between the dromedary NDV from Dubai and the pigeon NDVs from Egypt, substantiating the theory that the virus probably had transmitted directly from pigeons to dromedary. Notably, they also shared almost the same conserved residues and domains responsible for virulence in the F and HN proteins, suggesting that the present dromedary NDV may also be velogenic, similar to other velogenic NDVs of genotype VI (Figures S1 and S2) [12, 33] . Moreover, the present findings are in line with a spillover event recently reported in Nigeria, in which a high degree of sequence similarity between NDVs from domestic and wild birds was observed [34] . The study also discovered some bird species that had not previously been known to be infected by NDVs [34] . Although it is known that pigeons are not migratory, the mechanism of spread of genotype VI NDVs at long distances (i.e., from Egypt to Dubai) in the present study remains to be determined. A possible explanation for the spread of genotype VI NDVs may be due to the international trade of racing pigeons [33] . Further studies to determine the genotype of NDVs circulating in pigeons in Dubai or other parts of the Middle East and to screen for additional NDVs in camels are warranted to understand the present spillover event and the evolution of NDVs.",

The MERS epidemic and discovery of dromedaries as the reservoir of MERS-CoV and our discovery and isolation of a novel dromedary camel CoV UAE-HKU23 have boosted interest in search of more novel viruses in dromedaries [35] [36] [37] . In metagenomics studies and subsequent whole genome sequencing, we discovered two novel genotypes of hepatitis E virus (HEV), a novel genus of enterovirus, a novel astrovirus, two novel bocaparvoviruses, and novel picobirnaviruses and circoviruses in dromedaries [26, [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] . In addition to these metagenomics studies, we have also used next generation sequencing technologies in a previous study and the present study to rapidly identify and sequence the genomes of a West Nile virus and an NDV, respectively [46] . These are the first studies that demonstrate isolation of West Nile virus and NDV in dromedaries. All these studies have remarkably widened the spectrum of viruses found in dromedaries as well as the potential source of infections due the corresponding viruses.",
