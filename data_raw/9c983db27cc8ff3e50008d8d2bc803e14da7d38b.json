            "text": "Flaviviruses, a group of small, enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses, include several medically very important pathogens. Especially Japanese encephalitis virus, yellow fever virus, West Nile virus, dengue virus, Murray Valley encephalitis virus and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) are responsible for large outbreaks of fatal encephalitis or hemorrhagic fevers at diverse geographical regions around the world. Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), a disease caused by TBEV, represents one of the most important and serious neuroinfections in Europe and northeastern Asia. More than 13,000 clinical cases of TBE, including numerous deaths, are reported annually. Despite the medical importance of this disease, some crucial steps in the development of encephalitis remain poorly understood. In humans, TBEV may produce a variety of clinical symptoms, from an asymptomatic disease (70-90% of cases) to a fever and acute or chronic progressive encephalitis. This is influenced by a variety of factors, e.g., the inoculation dose and virulence of the virus [1] , the age, sex and immune status of the host [2] , and also susceptibility based on the host's genetic background. Studies of animal models and epidemiological studies in humans have shown that many apparently non-hereditary diseases, including infectious diseases, develop predominantly in genetically predisposed individuals and that this predisposition is caused by multiple genes [3] . In humans, a functional Toll-like receptor 3 gene may be a risk factor for TBEV infection [4] . A deletion within the chemokine receptor CCR5 (CCR5\u039432), which plays an important role in leukocyte transmigration across the blood-brain barrier, is significantly more frequent in patients with TBE than in TBE-na\u00efve patients with aseptic meningitis [5] . Moreover, the severity and outcome of TBE is associated with variability in the 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase gene cluster (family members are interferoninduced antiviral proteins that play an important role in the endogenous antiviral pathway) [6] and with the rs2287886 single nucleotide polymorphism located in the promoter region of the human CD209 gene [7] . This gene encodes dendritic cell-specific ICAM3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN), a C-type lectin pathogenrecognition receptor expressed on the surface of dendritic cells and some types of macrophages [7] . Taken together, polymorphism in various genes may largely influence the sensitivity of the host to the infection and determine the severity of this disease.",

While high neutralizing antibody response might be crucial for preventing host fatality, high local expression of various proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines in the brain during TBE can be associated with a more severe course of the infection and higher fatality.

No changes in the levels of IL-5 mRNA ( Figure 5I ) were observed in any of the studied mouse strains at any time point. TNF-\u03b1 ( Figure 5B ), CCL2/MCP-1 ( Figure 5C ) and CCL4/MIP-1\u03b2 ( Figure 5D ) mRNA levels increased significantly from day 2 p.i. A significant increase in the level of mRNA for IFN-\u03b3, IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-6 and CCL5/ RANTES (Figure 5 A, G, H, J, E) was seen from day 4 p. i. Expression of IL-1\u03b1 mRNA was enhanced from the day 6 p.i. (Figure 5F ). A large variation in the values of MIP-1\u03b1, IL-10 (data not shown) and IL-2 ( Figure 5H ) mRNA was observed between the individual mice within the strain each day after the i.c. inoculation of TBEV. IFN-\u03b3 mRNA levels were much higher in CcS-11 mice at day 7 p.i. when compared to STS mice (p < 0.05). Similarly, the lowest levels of IL-6 (p < 0.0005) and CCL5/RANTES (BALB/c vs. STS, p < 0.05; CcS-11 vs. STS, p < 0.005) mRNA were detected in STS mice versus BALB/c and CcS-11 mice at day 7 p.i. In contrast, STS mice had very enhanced levels of IL-1\u03b2 mRNA at day 7 p.i. in comparison to BALB/c and CcS-11 mice (p < 0.05). The greatest differences among the infected BALB/c, CcS-11 and STS mice were seen in case of MCP-1 and IP-10 mRNA. CcS-11 mice had the highest levels of MCP-1 mRNA in brains at days 4, 6 (p < 0.05) and 7 p.i. (BALB/c vs. STS, p < 0.005; CcS-11 vs. BALB/c, p < 0.05; CcS-11 vs. STS, p < 0.0005).

BALB/c had lower levels of IP-10 mRNA than CcS-11 mice (p < 0.05), but higher than STS mice (p < 0.05). A correlation between the IP-10 mRNA levels with the sensitivity of mice to the TBEV infection was observed (Figures 1C,  5K) .

            "text": "Mice provide a useful tool for study of human TBE, since they recapitulate the pathological and pathophysiological processes seen in severe human TBE cases. However, biological and virological markers indicating the severity of TBE in mice as well as in humans remain unclear. The severity of TBE can be influenced by a variety of factors, e.g., the inoculation dose and virulence of the virus [1] , the age, sex and immune status of the host [2] , and susceptibility based on the host's genetic background. Generally, age of the host is the most common host risk factor identified for severe forms of flavivirus encephalitis [29] . However, genetic host risk factors play an important role in the development of severe flaviviral neurological diseases as well. Several genetic host factors associated with the severe forms of flavivirus encephalitis have been identified. These include polymorphisms in HLA-A and HLA-B, polymorphism located in the promoter region of the human CD209 gene [7] and functional Toll-like receptor 3 gene [4] , deletion in CCR5 [5] and variability in 2\u00b4-5\u00b4-oligoadenylate synthetase gene cluster [6] . In our study, we developed a new mouse model of hosts differing in the susceptibility to TBEV infection based on CcS/Dem RC mouse strains. We observed clearly different patterns in the susceptibility of the CcS/Dem RC strains to s.c. infection with TBEV. Out of the eight strains tested, one (STS) exhibited low susceptibility, five intermediate susceptibility (CcS-3, CcS-7, CcS-9, CcS-16 and BALB/c) and two strains (CcS-11 and CcS-15) high susceptibility (Additional file 1: Figure S1 ). Differences in MST between the strains CcS-11, BALB/c and STS were also observed after i.c. inoculation of TBEV, i.e., CcS-11 mice had the shortest MST, BALB/c medium MST and STS the longest MST and higher survival ( Figure 1C ). These differences indicate the presence of TBEV susceptibility genes. Different susceptibility to virus infection in recombinant inbred strains between BALB/c and STS mice was also observed in case of infection with murine coronavirus [30] . After i.c. inoculation of 100 pfu of murine coronavirus, all BALB/c mice were highly susceptible and died; in contrast, STS mice were shown to be partially resistant, with a mortality rate of 30%, longer survival times and lower rates of virus production [30] . In our study, RC strain CcS-11, which contains approximately 12.5% genes of the donor strain STS and 87.5% genes of the background strain BALB/c, was more sensitive to TBEV infection than both parental strains BALB/c and STS. The observations of progeny having a phenotype beyond the range of the phenotype of its parents are not rare in traits controlled by multiple genes [18] . Such an observation may be due to multiple gene-gene interactions of quantitative trait loci, which in new combinations of these genes in RC or chromosomal substitution can lead to the appearance of new phenotypes that exceed their range in parental strains [18] . Another possibility is when some progeny receives predominantly susceptible alleles from both parents. These susceptible alleles are distinct from genes H2, Cd209, Tlr3, Ccr5 and Oas1b, which are involved in genetic control of susceptibility to flavivirus encephalitis (see above), because these genes are in CcS-11 localized on segments derived from the background BALB/c strain [ Figure 1A and Mouse Genome Informatics (http://www.informatics.jax.org/)]. We also cannot exclude the possibility of a spontaneous mutation appearing during inbreeding and causing the unique phenotype [18] . Similarly to our study, CcS-11 mice were more susceptible to infection with Leishmania tropica [18] and to Trypanosoma brucei brucei [31] than both parental mouse strains. However, CcS-11 is more resistant to L. major than BALB/c [32] .",

STS mice had very low and delayed viremia when compared with BALB/c and CcS-11 mice after s.c. inoculation. All mice showed brain infection, but lower titers were detected in brains of STS mice, while BALB/c and CcS-11 mice showed higher titers for 3-4 log 10 pfu. This indicated lower replication rates of the virus in STS mice, but no difference in replication rates in BALB/c and CcS-11 mice. To avoid virus-host interactions before virus neuroinvasion, mice were inoculated i.c., and the dynamics of virus growth in the brain was investigated. Although BALB/c, CcS-11 and STS mice showed different MST after i.c. inoculation, almost the same virus titers were observed in all investigated mouse strains at all intervals p.i. (Figure 2 ). Virus replication rate is not, therefore, the main factor influencing MST of the host. Similarly, no differences in tissue tropism, viral load or kinetics were observed during acute West Nile virus infection in mouse strains C57BL/6 and C3H/HeN with higher and lower survival rates, respectively [33] .",

In our previous work using BALB/c, SCID on the BALB/c background, C57BL/6 and C57BL/6 Cd8\u2212/\u2212 mice we reported that CD8 + T-cells have a dual role and mediate recovery, but also immunopathology during TBE [2] . In this study, no differences in the level of CD8 mRNA were seen between the BALB/c, CcS-11 and STS mice after s.c. inoculation. After i.c. inoculation, only STS mice exhibited slightly higher levels of CD8 mRNA (but also CD4 mRNA) than BALB/c mice at day 6 p.i., but no other differences were observed ( Figure 3B ). The most interesting results provided quantification of mRNA for CD19, a cell surface marker of B-cells. No increase of CD19 mRNA was observed after i.c. inoculation in all mouse strains. After s.c. inoculation, strains BALB/c and CcS-11 did not increase the levels of CD19 mRNA in their brains, whereas STS mice exhibited a significant increase ( Figure 3A ). This might indicate stronger B cell infiltration in brains of the less susceptible mice. B cells were also observed in brains in some studies focused on flavivirus encephalitis [34] , predominantly found in the perivascular space. The proportion of B and T cells in the brain may vary depending on the infecting flavivirus [35, 36] . It is known that TBEV, unlike to Japanese encephalitis and West Nile virus infections, induces CXCL13, a B-cell chemoattractant, in the CNS [37] . Although the antibody reaction is clearly important systemically [38] , the importance of B cells infiltrating brain parenchyma in confining of the infection is not clear.",

            "text": "More severe form of TBE associated with higher expression of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines in the brain Accumulation of cytokines and chemokines in the CNS may accentuate progression of encephalitis instead of restricting viral replication [37, [39] [40] [41] . Deregulated or excess release of proinflammatory mediators by the brain may induce tissue damage with different pathology and disease outcome [42] . In this study, we examined the cytokine/chemokine response in brains of the mice differing in susceptibility to TBEV infection (Figures 4  and 5) . We showed that a wide range of cytokine and chemokine mRNAs for TNF-\u03b1, IFN\u03b3, IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, CCL2/MCP-1, CCL5/RANTES, IP-10, MIP-1\u03b1, MIP-1\u03b2 and others was produced in response to TBEV infection. There was no clear correlation between the peak of cytokine/chemokine production and the increase of TBEV in the brain. After i.c. inoculation, all mice had comparable virus titers in the CNS ( Figure 2C ), but the levels of cytokine/chemokine expression differed markedly ( Figure 5 ). STS mice had the highest levels of IL-1\u03b2 mRNA after i.c. TBEV inoculation when compared to other strains of mice. In contrast, it is known that higher levels of IL-1\u03b2 are associated with more severe cases of chikungunya [43] . Most of other cytokine/ chemokine mRNAs tested were on the lowest level in STS mice in comparison to CcS-11 and/or BALB/c mice. The highest levels of proinflammatory cytokines/ chemokines (IFN\u03b3, CCL3/MIP-1\u03b1, CCL2/MCP-1, IP-10) (after s.c. and i.c. inoculation) and IL-5 (after s.c. inoculation) were detected in CcS-11 mice, indicating that these cytokines/chemokines can be associated with a more severe form of TBE in our experimental model. On the other hand, the lowest levels of IL-6 and CCL5/ RANTES, and also CCL3/MIP-1\u03b1 and CCL4/MIP-1\u03b2 mRNAs, were demonstrated in STS mice. These data support the theory that excessive production of proinflammatory mediators could contribute to development of more severe or acute form of TBE. Similarly to our study, higher levels of CCL5/RANTES, CCL3/MIP-1\u03b1, CCL4/MIP-1\u03b2 and IP-10 mRNA were found to be associated with a lethal form of West Nile virus infection in comparison with the non-lethal form [41] . CCL2/ MCP-1 and IP-10 mRNA levels correlated well with the susceptibility of the mouse strains to TBEV infection, i.e., CcS-11 mice had the highest levels, BALB/c medium and STS the lowest. These data were confirmed in two independent experiments. Both these chemokines can have an important role in immunopathology during TBE. It has been demonstrated that neutralization of CCL2/MCP-1 leads to increased survival rates in West Nile virus-infected mice [44] . Expression of IP-10 mRNA exhibited the biggest differences between the studied mouse strains. The chemokine IP-10, which is IFN-\u03b3 inducible and has the ability to attract activated T cells in the CNS, has also been shown to be a potent neurotoxin [45] . In human TBE patients, IP-10 can be detected in serum as well as in cerebrospinal fluid [46, 47] . Using genetically deficient mice and antibody neutralization approaches, it was demonstrated that IP-10 is critical for the recruitment of T-cells into the CNS and survival from West Nile virus infection in mice [48] . However, excessively high levels of IP-10 in the CNS can be very harmful to the host. IP-10 levels in the CNS of HIV-1 -infected individuals correlate positively with disease progression. There is also evidence that IP-10 participates in the neuropathogenesis of SHIV-infected macaques [49, 50] by contributing to the degeneration of neurons possibly through the activation of a calciumdependent apoptotic pathway [45, 51] . Our data strongly suggest that higher levels of IP-10 in the CNS might be associated with more severe forms of TBE. Further studies using mice specifically knocked out for one of the genes identified will determine their contribution to host susceptibility to TBE. Whether the profile of the chemokine production in human cases of TBE will predict the disease outcome requires further study.",

As a rule, the antibodies with relatively high affinity and avidity to the surface proteins of TBEV virions can be detected in neutralization test. Only such antibodies interfere with the interaction of the virus with receptors, preventing it to enter the cell. TBEV infection is associated with breakdown of the host blood-brain barrier [26] ; therefore, the antibodies can penetrate into the CNS. In our study, STS mice had a strong neutralizing antibody response, CcS-11 mice failed to produce neutralizing antibodies, and BALB/ c mice developed neutralizing antibodies but later and at low titers ( Figure 6 ). Therefore, our data on TBE support the importance of neutralizing antibodies in preventing neuroinvasion and host fatality. Similar data were obtained in experiments with the mouse strains C3H/HeN and DBA/2 with higher and lower susceptibility to the Japanese encephalitis virus, respectively [40] . In human TBE patients, those who fail to produce TBEV neutralizing antibodies usually have a very severe course of the infection [52] . The same is seen in patients who receive vaccination against TBEV and develop antibody response, but their antibodies do not have neutralizing capacity [52] .",

            "text": "In summary, our experimental model showed that earlier and greater amounts of neutralizing antibodies could limit neuroinvasion of TBEV and disease progression in less susceptible mice. Moreover, we described that resistant mice exhibit stronger B-cell infiltration (as measured by quantification of changes in mRNA levels of cell surface markers) but lower cytokine/chemokine production in the CNS when compared to the more susceptible mouse strains. The most susceptible mice have the highest overall cytokine/chemokine production in the CNS, particularly of CCL2/MCP-1 and IP-10, which can elevate the primarily proinflammatory environment in the brain, which could result in brain tissue damage and death of the host through immunopathology. This suggests an important role of cytokines and chemokines in the immunopathogenesis of TBE. The host immune response based on the genetic background of the host may therefore play a central role in determining the outcome of TBEV infection.",
