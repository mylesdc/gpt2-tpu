Whenever \u20ac \u3008k\u3009\u03bb /\u03b4 > 1, the existence of an interior root in G(i) leads to a dramatic increase of the recovery time (note the logarithmic scale) to extremely high values compared with those obtained for low infection rates. This problem becomes particularly acute in large populations because the fraction of time the population each state is not the same for different population sizes. The lower panel of Figure 1 shows the fingerprint of the population size on the quasi-stationary distribution for static contact networks with fixed average degree \u20ac \u3008k\u3009 = 49, for \u20ac \u3008k\u3009\u03bb /\u03b4 = 2. With increasing population size, the population spends less and less time close to the single absorbing state of the dynamics, remaining instead in the vicinity of the state associated with the interior root of G(i). This acts to reduce the intrinsic stochasticity of the dynamics, dictating a very slow convergence towards the absorbing state (no disease).",

Typical examples of situations potentially modeled with SIR are flu over a single season or computer virus epidemics. We distinguish three epidemiological states to model the dynamics of such diseases: susceptible (S), infected (I) and, finally, recovered (R), indicating those who have become immune to further infection. The SIR model in infinite, well-mixed populations is defined by a recovery rate and an infection contact rate . The fraction of infected individuals x changes in time according to the following the fraction of individuals z in the recovered class changes according to . (22) 3.1. The SIR model in finite populations We address the SIR model in finite, well-mixed populations in the same way as we addressed the SIS and SI models. The Markov Chain describing the disease dynamics becomes slightly more complicated and has states , where i is the number of infected individuals in the population and r the number of recovered (and immune) individuals ( ). A schematic representation of the Markov Chain is given in the following figure: Note that the states , with , are absorbing states. Each of these states corresponds to the number of individuals that are (or have become) immune at the time the disease goes extinct. the recovery time scale. The gradient of infection, which measures the likelihood for the disease to either expand or shrink in a given state, of infection determines the probability to end up in each of the different absorbing states of the Markov chain.

In the following, we study to which extent such result remains true for variable time scales of the linking dynamics. We start again with a complete network of size N in which one single individual is infected, the rest being susceptible. The simulations proceed exactly as before, i.e., network evolution proceeds simultaneously with disease spreading. Network update events take place with probability , SIR state update events occur otherwise. Each simulation runs until the disease goes extinct. For each value of , we run 10 4 simulations and average the final fraction of individuals that have been affected by the disease, which corresponds to the final fraction of individuals in the recovered class. These results are depicted in Figure 3. The upper dashed line indicates the expected fraction of recovered individuals in a static network (",
