The diagnosis of EDSV has been done by molecular tools since its complete genome sequence was identified. In order to enhance the capabilities of the realtime fluorescence loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RealAmp) assay, we aimed to apply the method for direct detection of the EDSV without viral DNA extraction. In order to detect the presence of the EDSV DNA, three pairs of primers were designed, from the conserved region of fiber gene of the EDSV. Results: For our assay, test and control samples were directly used in the reaction mixture in 10-fold serial dilution. The target DNA was amplified at 65\u00b0C, which yield positive results in a relatively short period of 40-45 min. The method reported in this study is highly sensitive as compared to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and showed no sign of cross-reactivity or false positive results. The RealAmp accomplished specific identification of EDSV among a variety of poultry disease viruses. Conclusions: The direct RealAmp can be used to detect the presence of EDSV. As our result showed, the RealAmp method could be suitable for the direct detection of other DNA viruses.",

EDSV was first reported in 1976, it has also been known as adenovirus 127 and egg-drop-syndrome-76 (EDS-76) virus [1] . EDS is characterized by the production of softshelled, thin shelled, shell-less, and discolored eggs in otherwise healthy chickens [2] . The natural hosts of the EDSV are ducks and geese, however, the virus can also infect chickens, resulting in major economic losses on egg production [3, 4] . EDSV was involved in severe respiratory disease in 1-day-old goslings where the presence of EDSV DNA was found in different organs of the naturally and experimentally infected goslings [5] . Severe acute respiratory symptoms with coughing, dyspnea, and gasping were reported in 9-day-old Pekin ducklings in 2013 [6] . For diagnosis of EDSV, five serological methods have been used and tested [7] . In the recent years, several PCR studies have been published, for diagnosis of all avian adenoviruses that are of relevance for poultry production [8] [9] [10] . Molecular amplification methods were commonly used to diagnose EDSV infection [11] .",

            "text": "Diagnosis of EDS is being performed using molecular technologies in many virus affected countries. The complete genome sequence of egg drop syndrome virus allowed the development of PCR assays for EDSV detection [21] . Since then the hexon based PCR assay was used to detect and differentiate the EDSV from fowl adenoviruses [22] . The conventional PCR methods have been employed in previous studies to diagnose the EDSV infection as a specific and sensitive method as compared to the serological methods [23] . A quantitative real-time PCR (q-PCR) assay based on hexon gene for the rapid detection of EDSV has also been reported [24] . While in 2014 a novel q-PCR assay was used to detect EDSV DNA in samples of interest [25] . Currently, a 151 bp fragment of the EDSV strain 127 penton base gene amplified by PCR with 100% nucleotide identity and confirmed by q-PCR [26] . In the present study, the ESE-Quant tube scanner was capable of detecting samples in real-time, and it could analyse melting curves using computer software [14] . To test large number of samples, the real-time PCR methods are too expensive and the q-PCR machines are not always available. Therefore we designed the first EDSV detection by utilizing an assay based on the direct RealAmp. The results of this study clearly indicated the superiority of the RealAmp assay in the detection of EDSV compared to a conventional PCR assay. In order to facilitate improved virus detection, diluted samples of allantoic fluid, and cell culture supernatants were used in the direct RealAmp assay and the results have showed that our method was successfully identified the EDSV from both samples ( Fig. 3a and b) . The RealAmp cannot give a clear and rapid result, when the sample was highly concentrated (undiluted allantoic fluid sample); the problem lies in the quantity of primer to be much dispersed on different and many DNA pieces. So the selflimiting process could happen (Fig. 3a) . In this study, RealAmp has amplified the EDSV fiber gene by using diluted recombinant plasmid DNA as low as 26 fg per microliter in 40 min, while the PCR was around 2.6 pg per microliter in 1 h and 30 min ( Fig. 5a and 5c ).",
