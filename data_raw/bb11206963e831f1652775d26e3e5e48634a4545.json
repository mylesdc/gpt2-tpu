Therefore, ns-EM methods are very useful for identifying the causal agents as viruses when we are confronted with rare infections and new viruses, as well as for viral infections in minor species and wild animals, when no other standardized methods and/or diagnostic reagents are available [2] [3] [4] .",

The detection of non-A, atypical RVs can be difficult due to the usually lower intestinal load, the lack of specific reagents for immune-enzymatic tests, and the fact that characteristic single-and double-shelled particles may not be readily apparent during ns-EM observation [13] . Using IAEM with convalescent sera makes it possible to detect different PoRVs ( Figures 1A-D) , including those strains belonging to non-A RV groups, which are non-cultivable and not recognized by immuno-enzymatic tests based on Group-A reagents. Actually, only PCR amplification of targeted sequences using Group-specific oligonucleotide primers, followed by nucleotide sequencing, provides an alternative tool to identify non-Group-A RVs [11] . In addition, IAEM with convalescent sera more easily detects other viral agents, present in association with RVs, among which, in our experience [14] , small round fecal virus/enterovirus-like particles are the most frequently present (Table 1 ). An example of a mixed infection in which RVs are associated with unclassified, 28-30 nm roundish particles, is shown in Figure 1C ,E). IAEM negative control showing several rotavirus particles dispersed in the observation field is reported in Figure 1F . (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) . The category \"not classified\" includes \"enterovirus-like viruses\" and the so-called \"small round fecal viruses\". The numbers in italics indicate the percentages calculated based on the total examinations performed each year. The percentage of the positives exams is based on the total examinations although some examinations resulted in more than one positive identification due to the occurrence of multiple infections with two or more viruses in association. IAEM has been routinely used to diagnose enteric viruses in fecal or intestinal samples from pigs with enteric disease (Table 1 ). In northern Italy, from 2002 to 2007, 1374 (38.3%) out of 3589 IAEM examinations tested positive for one or more viruses [14] . Rotavirus (12%) and PED coronaviruses (18.7%) represented the most common viral agents. Other agents included circovirus (4.6%), enterovirus (1.4%), calicivirus (0.5%), adenovirus (0.1%), parvovirus (0.1%), torovirus (0.1%) and small round fecal viruses/enterovirus-like viruses (14.4%), which were not fully classified due to their undefined morphology [14] . Therefore, to improve the knowledge of unclassified enterovirus-like particles, a total of 40 viral isolates were further identified by sequencing the capsid VP1-encoding gene. This lead to their classification as porcine enterovirus, porcine teschovirus and porcine sapelovirus [15] .",

PCV2 was initially isolated in 1991, was later associated with the Post-weaning Multisystemic Wasting Syndrome (PMWS), and it is still present with a high prevalence in commercial pig farms. The small size (18-20 nm) of circovirus makes them difficult to recognize, especially when present as single dispersed particles in the background fecal material, and thus, they are more clearly observed in the intestinal contents of piglets when precipitated in aggregates by IAEM. PCV2 has an immuno-suppressive effect and, thus, it is often detected in association with other viral and bacterial agents. Thus, the use of IAEM with convalescent sera is useful for more readily identifying multiple viral infections in which PCV2 is associated with other viruses. In fact, in one study [18] we used IAEM with anti-PCV2 convalescent sera to examine 101 animals taken from 29 industrial farms where outbreaks of PMWS were reported or lesions typical of PMWS were regularly shown at necropsy. Prior to being used in the IAEM method, the convalescent serum used was determined to be positive (titer 1:10,000) for anti-PCRV2 antibodies by testing in an in-home MAb-based competitive serological ELISA test [19] . Forty-five samples tested positive for PCV2, and it was frequently observed in association with one or more other viruses ( Table 2) . Examples of the association of circovirus particles with other virions, and particularly with rotavirus and enterovirus-like virus particles, are respectively reported in Figure 2A ,B. We then compared the results obtained with IAEM and two others virological methods, immunofluorescence (IF) and PCR, in the identification of PCV2 in the organs of clinically affected pigs sampled during outbreaks of PMWS [20] . Examinations tested different organs, such as lymph nodes and lungs using IF and PCR, and intestinal tracts using IAEM. The results confirmed the lower sensitivity of IAEM compared with PCR (concordance 44.1%) but not compared with IF (concordance 64.7%). By performing a single IAEM test, different associating particles, such as parvovirus-like, enterovirus-like, rotaviruses and PEDV, were simultaneously observed, thus more data were acquired on the interactions between PCV2 and other pathogens potentially involved in the pathogenesis of PMWS syndrome. Indeed, a higher level of PCV2 particles were detected in the caecum in comparison with the small intestine, and in several occasions only the caecum contained circovirus particles [20] .",

In fact, PED was difficult to diagnose since the virus is hard to isolate in vitro and, at that time, few reagents and established methods were available. The specific aggregation by IAEM with convalescent sera of single dispersed fringed particles permitted better recognition and identified PEDV particles by their typical coronavirus morphology ( Figure 4A-C) . The specificity of the convalescent sera employed was ascertained using an immunoperoxidase monolayer assay with the Vero cell-adapted Belgian PEDV isolate CV777 as the antigen. [24] , diagnostic methods were set up as screening tools to evaluate the presence and circulation of PEDV in field surveys. Two immunoassays, based on MAbs produced against the European CV777 reference strain were established for the detection of both antigen (double antibody sandwich ELISA) [25] and antibodies (MAb-based antigen capture ELISA) [26] . To confirm the virological identification we used reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR), as described by Kim et al. [27] that employs primers targeting the S gene [25] . From 2008 to 2014, only sporadic outbreaks were observed in grower and finisher herds. Using IAEM and sandwich ELISAs, 73 PEDV cases, from 60 different farms, out of 1756 cases of enteritis (4.54%) were diagnosed, and 28 strains were further genetically analyzed [28] .",

Because of the antigenic variability of turkey RVs, which belong to different groups (A, D, F, and G), the inability to cultivate in vitro both AstV and non-A RVs, and the scarcity of established molecular techniques, EM methods are still useful to quickly achieve a diagnosis of viral enteritis.

All of the birds sampled were between 1 and 5 weeks old and were suffering from systemic and enteric symptoms characterized by growth retardation, lethargy, anorexia, dehydration, wet droppings and/or diarrhea, which led to weight loss, decreased flock uniformity and increased mortality. A pool of sera, taken three weeks after a clinical episode of enteritis caused by RVs and AstVs, was obtained from convalescent turkeys and used to perform IAEM. The results are reported in Table 3 . Viral particles were observed in 51.4% of the examined samples and rotavirus (26.6%) and astrovirus (25.8%) mostly clumped in medium-large aggregates, were the most frequently detected particles ( Figure 5A ). The presence of antibody halos did not hamper the identification of virions, particularly of rotavirus, which, at the serum dilution used, were mostly showing a typical morphology ( Figure 5B ). AstVs were identified when the 28-30 nm picornavirus-like icosahedral particles displayed the characteristic 5-6 pointed star-shaped surface. However, since the typical star-shaped configuration is usually visible in only approximately 10%-20% of the particles [34] , and it may sometimes be obscured by antibodies when examining stools by IAEM [35] , we classified particles of this size-class as AstV if they showed a somehow structured surface ( Figure 5C ). During the observation of samples prepared using the IAEM method, we also identified other virions, which were sparsely distributed or even in small groups, but were not surrounded or immersed in a halo of antibodies. These included 6.9% enterovirus-like particles (possibly AstVs displaying an undefined morphology and a featureless surface), 4.4% of 18-22 nm parvovirus-like particles, 2.1% coronaviruses (the diagnosis was, in this case confirmed using a hyperimmune serum against turkey coronavirus, kindly provided by Prof. Mo Saif, Ohio State University, Wooster, OH, USA), 1.9% adenovirus and 0.6% rod-shaped virus-like particles (RSVLP) [36] . Often (79 cases), we simultaneously observed in the same sample two or more different viruses in a mixed infection. The combination of RVs plus AstVs was the most common (57 cases), supporting their pathogenic roles and importance as primary agents of enteritis (Table 4) .",

We then sequenced and genetically analyzed the RT-PCR positive samples, and we performed a phylogenetic analysis to distinguish and type them [37] . This study also permitted us to compare the results obtained by the two diagnostic methods (RT-PCR vs. ns-EM) and to draw some conclusions regarding their respective advantages and disadvantages. ns-EM was confirmed as a very useful method for an initial diagnosis of viral enteritis and for the identification and screening of RVs, SRVs, AstVs and ELVs in avian intestinal and fecal samples because it is fast, can identify viruses that cannot be isolated or identified using other methods, and is also able to distinguish mixed infections and particles that are unable to replicate. Nevertheless, it is only sensitive enough to identify the viral particles when the clinical symptoms of enteritis are present, and it does not allow for the further discrimination and characterization of similar viruses, which require the combined use of PCR and sequencing. Based on these conclusions, presently, in routine laboratory procedures, all of the samples from turkey pullets showing enteritis are examined using IAEM with a 1:40 dilution of the original convalescent sera. Samples are simultaneously subjected to RT-PCR to identify the RV and define the Group (A, D, F or G) [38] , as well as to identify and type the AstV [37] . ",

Further attempts to characterize and precisely identify the taxonomy of such viruses were unsuccessful. The possibility that they were circovirus was excluded (Lavazza A. and Todd D., unpublished results) by using the same molecular approach that led to the first identification of the canary circovirus [40] . Unless their taxonomy can be stated, the definition \"parvovirus-like virus\" seems to be appropriate.

However, similarities to the existing EBHS described in brown hares (Lepus europaeus), which had been almost endemic in Europe since the early '80s, became apparent. Unfortunately, the etiology of EBHS was still unclear [43] .",

We attempted to use ns-EM to identify the etiological agent ( Figure 7A,B) , but the existence of icosahedral virions of ~30-32 nm with tiny and short external projections, morphologically resembling calicivirus, was only obtained by IAEM using convalescent sera taken from animals that survived experimental infections. In fact, we observed compact groups of a variable number of viral units, surrounded by a dense halo of antibodies ( Figure 8A ) in most of the samples taken from animals showing typical signs and lesions [44, 45] . By using both the anti-RHDV convalescent sera ( Figure 9A ) and homologous convalescent hare sera ( Figure 9B ) for IAEM examinations of liver homogenates of EBHS affected hares, we were able to identify the viral etiological agent (EBHSV) [45, 46] .",

Nevertheless, the results obtained using IAEM with convalescent sera, as the first approach in the identification and diagnosis of lagoviruses, are valid proof of its importance and utility for discovering new animal viruses. The size of aggregates, containing both empty and full particles, and the width of the antibody halo depend on the specificity of the convalescent sera used.

The cases described in this paper are a clear demonstrations of such statements: IAEM with convalescent sera was used for (I) the first identification of lagoviruses, pig torovirus and pheasant parvovirus; (II) for an easier diagnosis of non-cultivable viruses, such as non-A rotavirus, turkey astrovirus and PED coronavirus; and (III) for detecting mixed infections, such as rotavirus RV associated with astrovirus in turkey or circovirus associated with enterovirus in pigs.",

Nevertheless, some of these adverse conditions may affect other diagnostic techniques as well. Immunoassays may result in false negatives when sampling is not done properly (non-target organs, low viral load or chronic phase) or samples are not well preserved.
