As a consequence, in June 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a global influenza pandemic [2] . A year later, in August 2010, the global pandemic was officially announced as ended [3] . Eventually, more than 214 countries and overseas territories or communities reported laboratory-confirmed cases of 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1), including 18,449 deaths [4] . Accordingly, the influenza A (H1N1) virus became a major public health problem around the world. During the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic, several epidemiological studies examined infection rates and risk factors leading to H1N1 infection among healthcare personnel (HCP) [5, 6] . Due to close contact with infected patients, HCP are exposed to infectious microbes and therefore vulnerable to occupationally acquired infectious diseases such as influenza A (H1N1) [7] . In the United States of America the estimated annual death rate among HCP due to occupational infections was between nine and 42 deaths per million HCP [8] . However, the risk of influenza A (H1N1) infection for HCP was not definitively clarified. The present review therefore aimed to record systematically and assess the published literature relating to the occupational risk of influenza A (H1N1) infection among HCP during the 2009 pandemic. To examine whether HCP ran an increased risk of influenza A (H1N1) infection during the 2009 pandemic, a meta-analysis was performed.",

Thereby the authors distinguish between population-based controls/comparisons (e.g. general population, non-healthcare professionals) and hospital-based controls/comparisons e.g. other healthcare professionals). Studies that did not report any valid control/comparison group or reference data were excluded. Outcome measures were laboratory-confirmed H1N1 infection, seroconversion or seropositivity. According to the Robert-Koch Institute (RKI), evidence of influenza A (H1N1) should be verified by one of the following direct or indirect testing methods: rapid influenza diagnostic test (RIDT), immuno-fluorescent antibody test (IFA), enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), haemagglutination inhibition test (HAI), microneutralisation test (MN) or viral isolation (VI) or culture (VC) [12] .

A study was involved in the meta-analysis if it included the following data for HCP (experimental) and non-HCP (control/comparison): cases (H1N1 pos.), non-cases (H1N1 neg.) and sample size (n). Seropositivity for influenza A (H1N1) was given if the HAI antibody titre was ! 1:40 or the RT-PCR value was 38 [12, 16] . If multiple diagnostic tests were reported in the studies, the most recognised testing method was used to report the final estimate. In this case HAI and RT-PCR were used. Both tests are universally applicable, well validated and frequently used in studies investigating influenza A (H1N1). The purpose of the analysis was to compute combined effect estimates for influenza A (H1N1) infection among HCP, using the Mantel-Haenszel method for binary outcomes. Pooled prevalence ratios, odds ratios (OR) as effect estimates and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated. In a subgroup analysis, studies were stratified by study quality (high and moderate). The presence of heterogeneity was tested using the \u03c7\u00b2 test, taking p < 0.10 as the level of significance. An I\u00b2 test was performed to quantify the diversity between studies. With a sensitivity analysis, the impact of the single studies on the pooled effect estimate finding was verified by stepwise excluding studies from the meta-analysis and examining the estimate stability [17] . In the event of a clear difference in the combined estimate (OR) or I\u00b2, the studies were excluded from further analyses. Possible publication bias due to study size was assessed graphically by means of a funnel plot. The bias is indicated by asymmetry in the plot. If applicable an Egger's linear regression calculation was carried out to test the probability of publication bias by regression analysis [18] . The level of significance for asymmetry is taken as p < 0.10, the calculated intercept is given with a 90% confidence range. The meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager (RevMan 5.3).",

Of the remaining 37 studies that were subjected to full-text screening, nine did not fulfil the eligibility criteria and two had been published twice in different journals. Main reasons for exclusion from the review were a divergent study topic (e.g. influenza vaccination, personal protective equipment use and prevention programmes), a different study population (e.g. focus on influenza patients only), the absence of a control/comparison group or reference data and a different study design (e.g. review, intervention study, outbreak investigation and case study).

            "text": "All 26 studies included in this review were published in English. Eight observational studies were based in Asia (Singapore, Korea, Japan, India, Taiwan and China; Table 2 ). Four studies each were carried out in North America (United States of America and Canada) and in Europe (Spain, Portugal, The Netherlands and Scotland). Three studies were based in Oceania (Australia and New Zealand) and one study in Central America (Mexico). Around 40% of the studies (n = 8) were carried out in general hospitals, five studies in acute care and five in tertiary care hospitals (emergency departments and influenza units), three studies in general practices and one study each in nursing homes, outpatient clinics and primary care medical centres. A variety of healthcare professionals were included in the studies as study subjects (e.g. physicians, general practitioners, nurses, nursing/doctors assistants, therapists, technicians, allied health/ support and administrative staff). All studies performed standardised laboratory tests to confirm the evidence of influenza A (H1N1) infection among study participants. Most studies used the haemagglutination inhibition test (HAI; n = 17) or the reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction method (RT-PCR; n = 10). Eight of the twenty studies (40%) completed a confirmatory test [16, 23, 24, [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] . Almost all studies (n = 19) used blood samples as influenza A (H1N1) diagnostic method [16, [19] [20] [21] [23] [24] [25] [26] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] . Six studies (30%) used nasopharyngeal swabs as additional diagnostic method [20, 21, 24, 28, 36, 37] . The kind of diagnostic method, blood sample or nasopharyngeal swab, has no impact on the prevalence rate of influenza A (H1N1) among HCP or controls/comparisons (data not shown). The sample size ranged from 66 to 15,018 participants. Prevalence rates for 2009 influenza A (H1N1) infection among HCP varied from 1.7% to 27.1%. Eight out of twenty studies (40%) used population-based controls (e.g. general population and non-HCP), eleven (55%) used hospital-based comparisons (e.g. nurses, technicians, students, auxiliary, support and administrative staff) and one study (5%) used reference data from the general population in their study. Prevalence rates among controls/comparisons ranged between 1.0% and 30.0%. Nine high quality [16, 26, [29] [30] [31] [33] [34] [35] 37] and two moderate quality [38, 39] studies showed higher H1N1 prevalence rates for HCP compared to controls/comparisons. Based on the eight quality criteria, fourteen studies (70%) were of high quality (! 10 points) [16, 21, 23, 24, 26, [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] 40, 41] and six studies (30%) of moderate quality (! 5 points) [19, 20, 25, 28, 38, 39] . The most frequent reasons for moderate quality were weaknesses relating to the response rate, description of non-responders, control group and confirmatory test.",

            "text": "Similarly to the observational studies, three out of the six other studies were carried out in Asia (Saudi Arabia, Taiwan and China). Three studies were based in North and South America (United States of America and Brazil). Half of the studies (n = 3) selected tertiary care hospitals/medical centres as the study location. The remaining studies (n = 3) were conducted in general hospitals/medical centres. All six studies performed laboratory tests, with RT-PCR being the most-used testing method (n = 5). For all studies the utilisation of a confirmatory test is unknown [6, 22, 27, [42] [43] [44] . Four out of six studies (67%) used blood samples as diagnostic method [27, [42] [43] [44] . Two studies (33%) used nasopharyngeal swabs [6, 22] . The sample size varied from 282 to 59,270 study subjects. Prevalence rates for HCP ranged between 2.5% and 40.0%. Three studies (50%) involved control groups in their study, two studies populationbased controls (e.g. administrative staff) and one study a hospital-based control (asymptomatic HCP, e.g. nurses and nurse technicians). The remaining studies (n = 3) used hospital-based comparisons (e.g. healthcare assistants and administrative staff). Prevalence rates for controls/ comparisons varied from 0.6% to 2.8%. Three moderate quality studies [42] [43] [44] found higher H1N1 prevalence rates for HCP compared to controls/comparisons. Five out of six studies (83%) were of moderate [22, 27, [42] [43] [44] and one study (17%) of high quality [6] . Several studies examined the job-related effect estimate (Odds Ratio, Relative Risk) of 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) infection among HCP ( Table 3 ). The results show that risk estimates vary from study to study. Three high quality studies [6, 21, 41] and one moderate quality study [25] report a significantly higher risk for HCP compared to controls/comparisons. One study found that the odds were six times higher for physicians in comparison with other professions (e.g. technicians; OR = 6.03, CI = 2.11 to 17.82) [6] . Nukui and colleagues showed similar results. In this study physicians and nurses ran a five times higher odds of influenza A (H1N1) infection than co-medical staff (OR = 5.25, CI = 1.21 to 22.7) [25] . Another study reported a significantly increased odds of influenza A (H1N1) infection for nurses compared to administrative or other staff (OR = 2.7, CI = 1.11 to 6.37) [21] . Chen and colleagues found consistent results for nurses in comparison with allied health staff (OR = 6.1, CI = 1.4 to 26.0) [41] . In contrast to this, one high quality study found a significantly lower risk for HCP compared to other personnel (e.g. soldiers; RR = 0.26, CI = 0.07 to 0.46) [23] . Six high quality studies [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] and one moderate quality study [43] showed no significantly higher or lower risk of influenza A (H1N1) infection for HCP in comparison with non-HCP.",

Moreover, the personal protective equipment (PPE) use among HCP is a frequently investigated topic in infectious diseases research. Many studies analysed the efficacy of PPE like surgical masks, gowns, gloves, goggles, N95 respirators and face shields as well as of hand hygiene [5, 19, 24, 25, 37, 39, 43] . The studies mainly concluded that an adequate PPE use and hand hygiene decrease the risk of influenza A (H1N1) infection among HCP (not shown).",

Because of high evidence of heterogeneity among the studies (\u03c7\u00b2 = 115.97, p < 0.00001, I\u00b2 = 88%) four studies [32, 35, 42, 43] were identified as sources of methodological variability and were excluded from the pooled analysis. The meta-analysis comprised 29,358 subjects (HCP and P/HC) from eleven studies (8 high quality and 3 moderate quality studies). Of these, 1,478 had influenza A (H1N1)-positive test results (Fig 2, part a) . The study population in our meta-analysis included for example physicians, nurses, therapists, laboratory staff and general practitioners. The control groups were all population-based, the comparison groups all hospital-based. In order to adequately address the diversity and heterogeneity of the limited number of studies included in the meta-analysis, the pooled effect estimate was determined using the random effect model [17] . Approximately half of the included subjects (51.2%) were vaccinated against influenza A (H1N1). In two studies the vaccination status was unknown [16, 37] . The pooled prevalence rate was 5.0% (for HCP only: 6.3%). In addition, the pooled analysis showed that the odds for an influenza A (H1N1) infection were significantly higher for HCP compared to all controls/comparisons (OR = 2.08, 95% CI = 1.73 to 2.51). The \u03c7\u00b2 test revealed no evidence of heterogeneity among the studies (\u03c7\u00b2 = 15.35, p = 0.12), the I\u00b2 value was 35% (Fig 2, part a) .

            "text": "To our knowledge the present paper is the first systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the occupational risk of 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) infection among healthcare personnel. In this literature review prevalence rates for 2009 influenza A (H1N1) infection among HCP varied from 1.7% to 27.1% and among controls/comparisons from 1.0% to 30% (see Table 2 ). Eleven out of 20 observational studies (55%; 9 out of 14 high quality and 2 out of 6 moderate quality studies) showed higher H1N1 prevalence rates for HCP compared to controls/comparisons [16, 26, [29] [30] [31] [33] [34] [35] [37] [38] [39] . Aguilar-Madrid and colleagues found a significantly increased odds for an influenza A (H1N1) infection among HCP with >5 contacts to probably infected patients compared to HCP with <5 contacts (OR = 1.47, 95% CI = 1.11 to 1.94) [33] . It is important, however, to mention that the exposure of some hospital-based comparisons could not be clarified. In our meta-analysis the pooled prevalence rate for HCP alone was 6.3% and for all included subjects 5.0%. The pooled analysis further showed a significantly increased OR of 2.08 (95% CI = 1.73 to 2.51) for an influenza A (H1N1) infection among HCP compared to controls/comparisons. The stratified analysis with population-based controls (OR = 1.93, 95% CI = 1.54 to 2.42) and hospital-based comparisons (OR = 2.52, 95% CI = 1.95 to 3.25) confirmed the significantly increased odds of influenza A (H1N1) infection for HCP. Stratified by occupation several high quality studies [6, 21, 41] and one moderate quality study [25] showed that physicians and nurses are particularly at risk for influenza A (H1N1) infection (e.g. OR = 5.25, 95% CI = 1.21 to 22.7; see Table 3 ). Bernard and colleagues also stated that HCP are most likely to be at greater risk of contracting influenza A (H1N1) than the general population due to their constant close contact with infected patients [7] . However, compared with other professions, hospital staff and general practitioners had a significantly lower risk of infection than school staff and schoolchildren [16] . The presence of children in households is a well-known risk factor for an influenza A (H1N1) infection [28, 30, 34] of its own. School staff are also particularly exposed to H1N1 microbes due to their daily work with children, but do not use PPE as HCP do. Similar results are shown in a study by Lee and colleagues [23] . This high quality study found that the risk of infection among HCP was significantly lower than that of staff working as soldiers in military units (RR = 0.26, 95% CI = 0.07 to 0.46). The authors assumed that HCP were at lower risk of infection because of their regularly use of PPE during working hours. School staff and soldiers alike do not use such equipment at work [23] . Several high [24, 37] and moderate [19, 25, 43] quality studies also proved that an adequate PPE use like surgical masks, gowns, gloves and goggles reduces the risk of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) infection.",

Apart from the occupational risk, non-occupational risk factors such as sex, age, vaccination history, influenza-like illness symptoms and other household members were examined. Alagappan and colleagues and Kuster and colleagues found that female sex, younger age, previous influenza-like illness and children under 18 years of age at home are risk factors for contracting influenza A (H1N1) infection among HCP [34, 36] . Three other studies showed similar results [21, 29, 35] . Moreover, study subjects who received a seasonal influenza vaccine were twice as likely to be infected with influenza A (H1N1) virus than unvaccinated subjects [21, 35] . The authors of the high quality studies conclude that seasonal influenza vaccination had no protective effect against the 2009 pandemic [21, 35] . Hudson and colleagues state that this observation may be due to cross-reactivity of antibodies induced by seasonal vaccination to influenza A (H1N1) [35] . Because of the missing protective effect of seasonal influenza vaccination especially during the first period of pandemics it is important that HCP adequately use PPE as prevention strategy against an infection. These findings also emphasize that the risk of H1N1 infection among HCP depends on several factors. However, the results of this study show that the occupation significantly contributes to the risk of infection. Some studies [45] [46] [47] confirmed the occupational risk among HCP for other infections than influenza A (H1N1). The authors found an increased risk of infection among HCP for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), avian influenza (H5N1) infection, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, hepatitis and tuberculosis. Therefore, it can be stated that healthcare is a setting in which employees are particularly vulnerable for acquiring infectious diseases.",

According to the literature the cut-off value for seropositivity is for HAI ! 1:40 [16] . Only one study defined a test result already as seropositive for influenza A (H1N1) if the HAI antibody titre was !1:20 [34] . Seven studies used the current cut-off value of ! 1:40 [16, [29] [30] [31] 33, 37, 38] . In one study the case definition is not clear as the authors used different cut-off values for seropositivity depending on the vaccination status [36] . Two studies used RT-PCR as the only diagnostic method [39, 44] . The type of diagnostic test, HAI or RT-PCR, has no influence on the results of our meta-analysis.

All included studies used population-based controls as control group, hospital-based comparisons as comparison group, HAI as influenza A (H1N1) detection method (with two exceptions; RT-PCR only) [39, 44] and serum samples as diagnostic method (with one unknown) [39] . Three studies [36, 37, 44] used nasopharyngeal swabs as additional testing method. Almost all studies were of high quality (8 out of 11) and had a good study design (cross-sectional study or cohort study). The forest plot also indicates that the confidence intervals belonging to the odds ratios overlap widely. It can be assumed that the degree of inconsistency between the studies is low [56] . Finally, the stratification by control and comparison group confirmed the higher odds of influenza A (H1N1) infection among HCP compared to controls/comparisons.",

This systematic review corroborates the assumption that HCP were particularly at risk of influenza A (H1N1) infection during the 2009 pandemic. The pooled analysis showed a statistically significant increase in the odds of influenza A (H1N1) infection among HCP compared to controls/comparisons. Our findings can help to enhance infection control especially during the first period of pandemics. Due to close contact with infected patients in healthcare settings and decreased protective effect of vaccinations, healthcare facilities should intensify their focus on strategies to prevent an infection among HCP. Well-known strategies such as PPE and hand hygiene are suitable, but HCP should be properly educated in these infection control practices.",
