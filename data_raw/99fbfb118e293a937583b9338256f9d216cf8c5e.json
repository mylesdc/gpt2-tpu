Also, it was demonstrated that AM580 selectively binds to Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Proteins (SREBPs). While the authors showed a heatmap of the lipids that are purportedly changed with viral infection, the details of the method and the identification of the lipids are extremely sketchy to evaluate the analytical methodology. For example, how are the lipids identified? There was neither a description of the identification or a reference to a method. The lipids were presumably extracted by standards Bligh-Dyer method and the extract was analyzed by LC-MS. In the procedure, the authors describing the reconstitution of the dried lipid extract in chloroform-methanol (2:1) but injected directly on LC-MS with initial mobile phase conditions that essentially consist of water (containing 0.5% acetonitrile and 0.1% acetic acid) at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. Despite the presence of methanol in the sample, the sample will be immiscible with the mobile phase at that flow rate. How were they able to perform the chromatography? There was no mention of any internal standards used for LC-MS. How are the lipids quantified to ascertain the changes upon infection? The lipids identified in Figure 1b do not conform to any standard nomenclature nor was there any key in Supplemental data to identify the lipids. More details are needed to evaluate the method and the results presented.",

If not, the link between AM580's ability to inhibit virus replication and lipidomic profile changes are circumstantial at best. In the data presented on the screening of commercial lipid library to inhibit virus replication and enhance cell viability, there are at least two other compounds that are either equal or better than AM580. What are these lipids and do they also bind to SREBPs to inhibit virus replication? Despite the liberal use of the term 'bioactive lipid' by the authors, AM580 is not an endogenous, naturally occurring bioactive lipid. It is a synthetic agonist of RAR\u03b1. Presumably, there could be other compounds in the 'lipid library' that are synthetic and calling them 'bioactive lipids' is misleading or a lack of understanding of what a bioactive lipid is.",

The authors used transcriptomics and lipidomic profiling as well as multiple molecular and biochemical methods to show that proteolytic processes and lipid biosynthesis pathways, including palmitoylation and double-membrane vesicles formation, are affected by SREBP. The latter are known to be essential for virus replication and particle formation. The authors found that a previously established compound (AM580) blocked SREBP binding to sterol regulatory elements (SREs). AM580 treatment post infection inhibited virus replication in vitro (MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, H1N1, EV-A71, ZIKV and AvV5) and in vivo (mouse model for MERS-CoV and Influenza virus). The authors therefore claim to have identified a broad-spectrum antiviral drug.",

The identification of a key regulator of lipid biosynthesis is of interest, in particular, as viruses exploit this pathway to sequester by-products of virus replication (dsRNA) from immune recognition and to produce virus progeny. However, the claim to have identified a broad-acting antiviral therapeutic is in my opinion exaggerated. Neither the applied organoid intestinal model nor the relatively artificial transgenic mouse model justifies the title of the paper, i.e. \"Targeting the SREBP-dependent lipidomic reprogramming by virus infection for broad-spectrum therapeutic intervention\". Importantly, off-target and other downstream effects resulting from AM580 treatment should be investigated. In particular, as the AM580-induced lack of DMV formation may affect innate immune regulation. Supplementary Figure 6 is not sufficient to exclude that AM580 affects immune regulation in context of MERS-CoV replication.",

We agree with the reviewer that knockdown of SREBP1 or 2 did not exhibit similar level of antiviral potency as that of AM580, which might be due to mutual compensation between SREBP1 and SREBP2 when either one protein was impaired (Shimano et al., 1997) . When the SRE-ds DNA-binding activity of both n-SREBP1 and n-SREBP2 were blocked by AM580, there should be an additional/synergistic antiviral effect. This is supported by our observation that double knockdown of SREBP1 and SREBP2 in the additional experiment resulted in about 2 logs decrease of infectious virus particle when compared with the 1 log reduction of individual knockdown. Together with the comments from reviewer #2 regarding the RNAi specificity, we have now included experiments using distinct siRNA targeting the same SREBP1 (i.e. 1_1 and 1_2) and SREBP2 (i.e. 2_1 and 2_2).

For instance, does AM850 affect lipid droplet (LD) accumulation directly or is there just less viral enhancement of LDs because there is less viral replication? Are there no DMVs because of a direct role in DMV formation or because replication is inhibited? A way around this issue is to create cell lines expressing viral proteins/polyproteins responsible for alterations such that their expression is unaffected by the drug. This approach has been used extensively in related virus fields. The authors could also investigate AM850 in uninfected cells or cells inducing lipid metabolism via other means.

We note that our LC gradient and mobile phase compositions are not optimal to cover all lipids classes even though we have used the mixed solution consist of chloroform-methanol (2:1) for lipid extraction. Our current LC protocol is designed for the analysis of polar lipids and was based on the LipidMaps (http://www.lipidmaps.org/) methods with modifications . We have been able to detect large number of lipid mass features including fatty acids, glycerophospholipids and sphingomyelins from our infected and non-infected cell samples, and even in patient samples in previous studies, using the same methodology (Lau et al., 2016; K. K. W. To et al., 2015) . More importantly, the intracellular membranes were mainly consisted of glycerophospholipids, which play important roles in signaling and viral replication cycle. So in the current study, we have focused on these glycerophospholipids changes based on the previously established lipidomics approach. Since acetonitrile can dissolve a wide range of ionic and nonpolar compounds, with the progressive increase of the acetonitrile content in the mobile phase, the present LC-gradient could provide good separations of the targeted lipid class. As an example, the 68 significantly changed lipid features displayed in Supplementary Table 2 has shown that different types of fatty acids, glycerophospholipids and sphingomyelins were successfully separated by the present LC-gradient and were eluted at different retention times. Figure below showed the XIC curves of 12 representative lipid features in the present study.",

The authors used transcriptomics and lipidomic profiling as well as multiple molecular and biochemical methods to show that proteolytic processes and lipid biosynthesis pathways, including palmitoylation and double-membrane vesicles formation, are affected by SREBP. The latter are known to be essential for virus replication and particle formation. The authors found that a previously established compound (AM580) blocked SREBP binding to sterol regulatory elements (SREs). AM580 treatment post infection inhibited virus replication in vitro (MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, H1N1, EV-A71, ZIKV and AvV5) and in vivo (mouse model for MERS-CoV and Influenza virus).

Neither the applied organoid intestinal model nor the relatively artificial transgenic mouse model justifies the title of the paper, i.e. \"Targeting the SREBP-dependent lipidomic reprogramming by virus infection for broad-spectrum therapeutic intervention\". Importantly, off-target and other downstream effects resulting from AM580 treatment should be investigated. In particular, as the AM580-induced lack of DMV formation may affect innate immune regulation. Supplementary Figure 6 is not sufficient to exclude that AM580 affects immune regulation in context of MERS-CoV replication.",

We chose MDMs because they are the key cells involved in the innate immune response. The qPCR result, after normalized by the mock-infected group, suggested that addition of AM580 to the virus-infected cells did not lead to an increase of antiviral IFN-\u03b2 at all timepoints post-infection but a decrease of IFN-\u03b1 and the pro-inflammatory IFN-\u03b3 at the later time-points like 6hpi and 24hpi.

Another report suggests that pro-inflammatory effects of IFN-\u03b3 is believe to outweigh its antiviral effects in SARS patient (Huang et al., 2005) , thus the reduced IFN-\u03b3 production, as detected at 6 and 24hpi, were likely due to the decreased MERS-CoV replication by AM580. Therefore, we believe the inhibition of DMV formation by AM580 and the decreased shielding of dsRNA by DMV does not lead to an increased innate immune response. We have added these Response: we agree with the reviewer that there might be some residual AM580 or other factors in the infectious cell culture supernatant that may disturb the PFU formation. When applying to plaque assay, however, the dilution effect (in our case 50-fold is the lowest dilution factor and then 500, 5000, 5000fold further) would significantly diminish these interferences to the plaque assay.

The fact that AM580 was long known as a selective agonist to RxR\u03b1 and not to RxR\u03b2 but binds to SREBP as shown in this study clearly demonstrates its off-target effects. While removal of the references to AM580 as a bioactive lipid was necessary, the off-target effects has to be acknowledged in the manuscript because there is no guarantee that the compound does not bind to other targets that might come to light in the future.",

This experiment which onvolved performing a double knockdown of SREBP1 and 2 showed a significant 2 log decrease in viral replication which supports the major conclusion of this paper that their newly identified small molecule likely targets these proteins in its MOA.I believe the paper is suitable for publication in Nature Comm.Reviewer #2: Remarks to the Author: the authors have addressed my concerns Reviewer #3: Remarks to the Author: The manuscript is significantly improved with the changes incorporated in response to the comments. A few minor points to note:1. On page 7, line 16, AM580 is referred to as a retinoid derivative. This incorrect. The structure is far from any retinoid structure. AM580 is a synthetic agonist that binds to RxR\u03b1 selectively. Hence, any reference to retinoid should only be as a synthetic agonist.2. While the details of lipidomic analysis are needed to evaluate the manuscript, the methods can be in Supplementary data and can be removed from the main manuscript. On a technical note, the internal standards used to estimate recovery are not the best choices. Lyso-PAF is not a good representative of glycerophospholipids to be extracted similarly. Moreover, the standards are to be added to the sample before adding the extraction solvent, not to the extraction solvent. The way the authors conducted the extraction, overestimates the extraction efficiency, unrealistically minimizes variation in extraction, and does not reflect the true extraction of lipids in the sample. This is a problem even though the lipid level comparison between control and experimental samples was done directly between the identified lipids.Finally, the identification of AM580 as an antiviral compound is purely serendipitous, despite the fact that it came out of a 'lipid' library screen (a few of the compounds in that library are neither lipids nor bioactive!). The fact that AM580 was long known as a selective agonist to RxR\u03b1 and not to RxR\u03b2 but binds to SREBP as shown in this study clearly demonstrates its off-target effects. While removal of the references to AM580 as a bioactive lipid was necessary, the off-target effects has to be acknowledged in the manuscript because there is no guarantee that the compound does not bind to other targets that might come to light in the future.Reviewer #4: Remarks to the Author: All remarks were addressed adequately.
