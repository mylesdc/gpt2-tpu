            "text": "(porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome)-like clinical signs identified by metagenomic sequencing from swine. Its high occurrence may pose a potential threat to the swine industry worldwide. The processes resulting in the emergence and spread of PCV3 remain poorly understood. Herein, the possible origin, genotypes, and evolutionary dynamics of PCV3 based on available genomic sequences are determined. The closest ancestor of PCV3 is found to be within the clade 1 bat CVs. Using different phylogenetic methods, two major genotypes are identified, PCV3a and PCV3b. It is found that the effective population size of PCV3 increased rapidly during late 2013 to early 2014 and this is associated with the diversification of PCV3a and PCV3b. A relatively high effective reproductive number (Re) value and higher evolutionary rate were found compared to other single-stranded DNA viruses, and positive selection on codons 122 and 320 (24 of ORF2) is identified. It is hypothesized that this, together with the prediction of a potential change of an antigenic epitope at position 320, might have allowed PCV3 to escape from the host immune response. Overall, this study has important implications for understanding the ongoing PCV3 cases worldwide and will guide future efforts to develop effective preventive and control measures.",

            "text": "Continuous epidemiological surveillance of emerging viruses is crucial to control widespread. [1] According to the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), the family Circoviridae comprises two genera: Cyclovirus and Circovirus. Viruses from the genus Cyclovirus have been found in humans and chimpanzees. [2] Circoviruses have a wide host range, including human, [2, 3] birds, [4, 5] pigs, [6, 7] dogs, [8] and cattle. [9, 10] Before to 2015, porcine circovirus 1 (PCV1) and PCV2 were considered the only types of porcine circoviruses. PCV1 is nonpathogenic to pigs and was identified in the porcine kidney cell line PK-15. [6, 11] PCV2 is associated with significant clinical signs such as postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS), porcine circovirus-associated diseases (PCVAD), and immunosuppression. [2, 6, 10] In the late 1990s, the first PCV2 outbreak was identified [12, 13] and soon PCV2 became endemic causing severe economic losses in the swine industry. Its high evolutionary rate, the highest recorded for a single-stranded DNA virus until now, could allow an evolutionary dynamics similar to that of single-stranded RNA viruses. [13] The genotype identification of PCV2 was first proposed by the European project in 2008 based on p-distance of neighbor joining (NJ) trees. [14] However, it was questioned by Franzo et al. and others [12, 15, 16] when more sequences became available. Until now, there are three major confirmed genotypes including: PCV2a, PCV2b, and PCV2d, and two genotypes with low prevalence, PCV2c and PCV2e. [16] [17] [18] [19] Genotype shifts may be associated with differences in pathogenicity and vaccine immunity. [12] New standard methods to define PCV2 genotypes are necessary to adapt vaccines to the rapid emergence of new genotypes. [20] Although PCV2 is the cause of big economic losses to the pig industry, there is uncertainty surrounding its origin and evolution. Recently, a novel circovirus was identified by next generation sequence (NGS) analysis of aborted fetuses of sows and named PCV3. [21, 22] The newly discovered virus was associated with PDNS. [23] PCV3 infection might contribute to PDNS and reproductive failure, cardiac, and multisystemic inflammation. [10, 21, 24] It has also been shown that PCV3 found in aborted fetuses is the result of vertical transmission. [21] Like PCV2, there are two major open reading frames (ORFs) in the genome of PCV3: ORF1 encodes proteins involved in viral replication (Rep) and ORF2 encodes a major structural protein, the capsid protein (Cap). [25] PCV3 sequences were detected widely in the USA, [21] China, [26] [27] [28] Brazil, [29] Thailand, [30] Korea, [23] and many European countries, [22, [31] [32] [33] [34] including Poland, Italy, Spain, Denmark, Germany, the UK among others. The PCV3 that was first identified in the USA was more closely related to canine circovirus although with weak bootstrap support. [21] Subsequently, with PCV3 detected in China and other countries, a study reported that it was closely related to some bat circoviruses. [24] Additionally, it was considered that canine CVs and some bat CVs may share a common ancestor within the cluster containing PCV1 and PCV2. [35] Previous studies on the origin of PCV3 are difficult to interpret and compare since different phylogenetic methods and reference sequences were applied. [21, 24, 26] Although phylogenetic analysis is a powerful tool and is now widely used for investigating the evolution of PCV3, there are a large number of different inference methods and a lack of uniformity in the use of these methods by different studies. [22, [24] [25] [26] [27] 29, 31, 33] Considering the controversy of the origin of PCV3 (bat or canine), [21, 24, 26] we analyzed the selected available ORF1 circovirus sequences using maximum-likelihood (ML) and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to trace more accurately the origin of PCV3. Additionally, all available complete PCV3 sequences deposited in GenBank until November 2017 were analyzed by NJ, ML, and MCMC methods to study the molecular genetic relationship. Our results provide a global view of the origin, genetic divergence, and evolutionary dynamics of PCV3 and indicate positive selection and high evolutionary rate, supporting the ongoing genotype shift and outbreaks.",

To trace the origin of PCV3, a ML tree (Figure 1a ) was reconstructed using ORF1 gene sequences. We found that all the PCV3 strains were closely related to the clade 1 bat CVs (which were isolated in China from 2011 to 2013) with a high confidence (bootstrap = 86). The bat virus Rhinolophus ferrumequinum circovirus 1 from China (JQ814849) acted as an outgroup of the clade 1 bat CVs and the PCV3 strains, indicating a potential bat CV origin. Additionally, we also found that the PCV2 and PCV1 strains were closely related to the clade 2 bat CVs in the study of Wu et al. [35] We also discovered that canine CVs are closely related to clade 2 bat CVs and PCV1 and PCV2 strains. However, it was previously reported that canine CVs were closely related to PCV3 strains when comparing complete genomes, although with low bootstrap values. [21] This supports the idea that the conserved Rep protein should be used when inferring the origin of porcine circoviruses in the future. Furthermore, the maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree reconstructed with 81 of the 101 ORF1 sequences (Figure 1b ) showed similar topology with the ML tree, and evidenced a close relationship with clade 1 bat CVs with uncertain divergence time due to the insufficient numbers of sequences currently available (Table S1, Supporting Information).",

            "text": "Since the discovery of PCV3 in 2015, most studies have focused on the genetic characterization of individual isolates and on clinical and epidemiological investigations. [22, 23, 25, 38] Here, we provide new insight into the origin, epidemiology, and evolution of PCV3. We determined, with better accuracy than previous reports, the origin of PCV3 and proposed an evolutionary pathway that led to the emergence of PCV3 worldwide. First, we used conserved coding sequences (ORF1) to trace the potential origin, which was a better and more accurate approach than those previously applied to complete genomes. [21, 24, 26] We found that clade 1 bat CVs which were isolated in China from 2011 to 2013 shared the most recent common ancestor with PCV3. Interestingly, we found several differences with previous reports. First, the pig NW2/USA/2009 strain clustered with the PCV3 clade, which was previously reported to sit as a sole outgroup in the phylogeny. [24] Therefore, we assume that the emergence of PCV3 was before its first detection in 2009 in pigs. However, the accurate origin and divergence time need deep epidemiological surveys to be confirmed. Second, compared to previous studies, [21, 24, 26] more reference sequences were included and we confirmed that PCV3 actually diversified from a clade 1 bat CVs. [35] Furthermore, in accordance with a previous study, we found that PCV1 and PCV2 were closely related to the clade 2 Bat CVs, [35] but not birds. [13] Overall, clade 1 bat CVs are the most likely origin of PCV3 based on the currently available sequences. Generally, bats are considered to be important reservoirs of novel emerging infectious diseases. Circovirus host jumps may be a risk for both the pig industry and public health, similar to the recently reported bat-origin coronavirus detected in pigs. [39, 40] Given that previously recognized NJ p-distance methods that identified PCV2 genotype were questioned by Franzo et al., [15] we explored the phylogenetic history of PCV3 based on recent outbreak strains. [41, 42] For the genotype identification of PCV3, three different algorithms, NJ, ML, and MCC, were used and two stable clades were identified (PCV3a and PCV3b). Additionally, within the PCV3a clade, two stable subclades and flexible IM clades were identified. Compared to previous studies, [24, 31] Adv. Sci. 2018, 5, 1800275 the topologies of the trees provided here, deduced using complete coding sequences, were more stable and accurate ( Figure S4 , Supporting Information). On the other hand, amino acid analysis revealed that S122A and A320V were vital in differentiating the PCV3a and PCV3b clades. Although genotype identification combined with amino acid analysis has been reported by Fu et al. [24] and Fux et al., [31] it is essential to note that: i) both studies included the low sequencing quality strain KY418606 (which has been revised after the two studies were published), misleading the topology of the phylogeny; ii) the subgenotype identification of the two studies was not based on full genomes, while complete coding sequences were used The bold representing the p < 0.05 and posterior probability >0.9, with significant difference. here; and iii) the stable topologies observed in our phylogenetic trees reconstructed with complete coding sequences were confirmed by principle component analysis (PCA) using different sequences in one of our unpublished studies. Therefore, accurate phylogenetic trees and genotype identification of PCV3 should be deduced using unrooted ML trees of complete coding sequences in the future. Phylodynamic analysis revealed that the divergence of PCV3a was earlier than PCV3b. We believe that the short divergence time identified for PCV3a and PCV3b is due to a lack of adequate number of PCV3 sequences. The skyline plot revealed a rapid increase and expansion of the PCV3 population from late 2013 to early 2014. In addition, during this period, PCV3a and PCV3b were formed. The initial phase of an epidemic is usually associated with exponential growth (corresponding to Re = R0). Re must always be less than or equal to R0 by definition. If the value of R0 or Re is more than one, an epidemic may occur. [43] We estimated that the Re of PCV3a and 3b were 3.18 (CI: 0.82-7.96) and 1.82 (CI: 0.63-4.86) in 2016, respectively. Additionally, the high substitution rate of PCV2 within single stranded DNA virus, enabled it to experience an evolutionary dynamics similar to single stranded RNA viruses and, therefore, enhanced the global emergence of PCVD. [13] Interestingly, the substitution rate of PCV3 was relatively higher than PCV2, which might facilitate PCV3 to adapt to different biological conditions and pose a greater threat to the swine population. Overall, these estimated results were consistent with the actual epidemic of PCV3 and indicate that both PCV3a and 3b have high potential for widespread transmission in the future. Thus, epidemiological investigation to prevent this novel disease is crucial. Moreover, our analysis revealed epidemiological features associated with the geographical distribution in China, which might indicate that once PCV3 strains establish into specific areas, they might adapt to the local hosts. Importantly, amino acid site 24 of the ORF2 protein (codon of 320 in the complete coding region) was predicted as a potential epitope and to be under positive selection. This site may be pivotal to the escape of PCV3 from the host immune system leading to a prolonged period of circulation and the divergence of the PCV3a to the PCV3b clade. [44] In conclusion, we confirmed the more accurate bat origin of PCV3, and provided a comprehensive genotype identification. Additionally, we report for the first time that PCV3 replaced PCV2 and became the single stranded DNA virus with highest substitution rate. The rapid increase population and relative high Re value reveals the possibility of a continuous outbreak in the future. Overall, our study aids the understanding of ongoing PCV3 cases worldwide and will guide future efforts to develop effective preventive and control measures.",

A Bayesian skyline coalescent model was set to estimate the efficient population size. Two independent runs were operated with a chain length of 1 \u00d7 10 8 generations and sampled at every 10 000 generations.

Parameters with effective sampling size (ESS) > 200 were accepted. The final MCC trees were replayed in Figtree (v1.4.3) (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/). BaTS (Bayesian tip-significance testing) was used to analyze the correlation among the PCV3 sequences and geographical structure.

The AI and PS statistic were calculated using the BEAST MCC tree to obtain statistical support. A p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
