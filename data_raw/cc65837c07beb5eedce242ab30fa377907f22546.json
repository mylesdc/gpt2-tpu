However, co-detection of multiple agents and bacterial colonization make it difficult to distinguish between asymptomatic infection or illness aetiology. We assessed whether semi-quantitative microbial load data can differentiate between symptomatic and asymptomatic states for common respiratory pathogens. Methods: We obtained throat and nasal swab samples from military trainees at two Thai Army barracks. Specimens were collected at the start and end of 10-week training periods (non-acute samples), and from individuals who developed upper respiratory tract infection during training (acute samples). We analysed the samples using a commercial multiplex respiratory panel comprising 33 bacterial, viral and fungal targets. We used random effects tobit models to compare cycle threshold (Ct) value distributions from non-acute and acute samples.",

In addition, enrolled participants were asked to consult the camp's medical unit if they experienced respiratory symptoms during the training period. Medical staff took a history, conducted a medical exam, and recorded symptoms of upper respiratory illness (URI) or influenza-like illness (ILI). URI was defined as an illness with at least two of the following: (i) runny nose or sneezing; (ii) nasal congestion; (iii) sore throat, hoarseness or difficulty swallowing; (iv) cough; (v) swollen or tender glands in the neck; and (vi) fever (oral temperature > 38\u00b0C). ILI was defined as a respiratory illness with acute onset presenting with fever and cough or sore throat.

These two cohorts were selected because they underwent concurrent routine environmental sampling of air and surfaces within the barracks, which were then similarly tested using the FTD33 kit (data not shown).

In addition, we computed the chi-square (\u03c7 2 ) or Fisher's exact test (for expected values < 5) to assess whether co-detection of specific microbe pairs occurred more frequently than expected by chance in non-acute baseline or acute samples. To account for data censoring at Ct-value = 33, random effects tobit regression models were used to compare Ct-value distributions from non-acute and acute samples, or Ct-value distributions from samples containing a single or multiple organisms.

The use of highly sensitive multiplex PCR diagnostics allowed an accurate characterization of the spectrum of organisms contained in non-acute and acute samples. The data indicate co-circulation of several different viral agents, and high frequency of bacterial colonization in both non-acute and acute samples. Up to one third of respiratory illness cases among army personnel are reportedly caused by viral or bacterial infections [6] . The gathering of individuals from diverse geographic locations and the crowded living conditions increase the risk of microbe transmission in these settings [7] . Illnesses are usually self-limiting, although the emergence of highly virulent strains can lead to high morbidity and mortality [8] . Streptococcus bacteria, adenoviruses, coronaviruses and influenza are among the most widely distributed microbes in the military environment, and are implicated in > 50% of febrile illness cases reported at military medical facilities [6] . We identified each of these organisms in one or more samples. For most of these microbes, overall detection frequencies were comparable in non-acute and acute samples, although influenza B and coronavirus 229 were more commonly identified among acute specimens. Other infectious agents commonly circulating among military personnel include H. influenzae, rhinovirus, and, to a lesser extent, parainfluenza, RSV, and L. pneumophila, although their presence does not necessarily imply the occurrence of clinical symptoms [9] [10] [11] . H. influenzae and rhinoviruses were the most frequently detected organisms in our population in both non-acute and acute samples. We detected parainfluenza and L. pneumophila, but we did not find RSV in any of our samples.",

Among acute diarrhea patients, quantitative amplification of norovirus RNA from fecal samples can help determine pathogen load thresholds that effectively distinguish between causal association and sub-pathogenic carriage [19] . Similarly, rotavirus load correlates with disease severity among children with gastroenteritis [20] . Because of the crucial role of microbial replication in viral pathogenesis, the value of pathogen load quantitation could be most clearly established for gastrointestinal illnesses of viral etiology, although some evidence is available for bacterial infections as well. For instance, microbial load of enteropathogenic E. coli is significantly higher among children with diarrhea compared to control subjects, especially when enteropathogenic E. coli is the sole agent identified [21] . In this study, tobit regression indicated significantly lower microbial load in non-acute relative to acute samples for rhinovirus, HI-nonB, and S. pneumoniae. However, due to a substantial overlap in Ct-value distributions, it was not possible to identify a Ct-value threshold indicating causality for any of these organisms. Previous studies assessing the association of viral load with clinical symptoms of respiratory infections reported similar findings. Mean viral load for rhinovirus and six additional viruses was significantly higher in upper respiratory tract aspirates from children with pneumonia compared to healthy controls, but the overlap in viral load distribution was substantial [22] . In pediatric patients, high rhinovirus load was associated with the presence of lower respiratory tract symptoms [23, 24] , but a threshold for clinical relevance could only be determined if rhinovirus was the sole agent identified [24] . Additional studies reported a correlation between microbial load and occurrence or severity of respiratory symptoms for RSV [25] , bocavirus [26] , and human metapneumovirus (HMPV) [27, 28] , although these findings were inconsistent [29, 30] or conditional on the presence of the virus as a single microbe [31] . We did not detect any significant association between microbial load and clinical manifestations for viruses other than rhinovirus.",

Among children hospitalized with pneumonia, median nasopharyngeal S. pneumoniae load was substantially higher compared to healthy controls [32] . Pneumococcal density was also associated with severity of symptoms [34] and increased duration of children's hospital stay [35] . Similar associations were observed in pneumonic adults, although the correlation was not significant in this population [36] .",

Temporal variations in microbial load may also play an important role if the quantity of nucleic acid is significantly more abundant at the time and location of pathology [30, 33] . In acute respiratory illness patients, high bacterial colonization densities are often associated with the presence of viral co-infections [38] , and clinical manifestations may vary depending on specific co-infection patterns [39] .",

In addition, the data were obtained from throat and nasal swab samples, but our findings may not apply to nasopharyngeal or sputum specimens.
