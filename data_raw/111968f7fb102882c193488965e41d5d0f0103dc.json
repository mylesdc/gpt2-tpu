In particular, it is critical to monitor the appearance of any new emerging subtypes. Comparative phyloinformatics can be used to monitor, analyze, and possibly predict the evolution of viruses. However, in order to utilize the full functionality of available analysis packages for largescale phyloinformatics studies, a team of computer scientists, biostatisticians and virologists is needed -a requirement which cannot be fulfilled in many cases. Furthermore, the time complexities of many algorithms involved leads to prohibitive runtimes on sequential computer platforms. This has so far hindered the use of comparative phyloinformatics as a commonly applied tool in this area.",

The results of this paper are hence twofold. Firstly, this paper demonstrates the usefulness of a graphical user interface system to design and execute complex distributed workflows for large-scale phyloinformatics studies of virus genes. Secondly, the analysis of neuraminidase on different levels of complexity provides valuable insights of this virus's tendency for geographical based clustering in the phylogenetic tree and also shows the importance of glycan sites in its molecular evolution.",

            "text": "Recent occurrences of pandemics like the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) or Avian Influenza clearly underscore the threat and seriousness of global diseases. The steadily growing globalization makes it difficult to contain pandemics to a certain region. Therefore, pandemic control is of highest importance to human health. Unfortunately, the segmented nature of the genome of influenza viruses is very conducive for genetic shifts and their rapid spread across various genera augments genetic drift. For example, the human influenza pandemics in 1957 and 1968 were suggested to have been caused by reassorted influenza viruses [1] . Moreover, the H5N1 outbreak in Hong Kong in 1997 has convincingly demonstrated the ability of an avian virus to make the transition from birds to humans directly without going through a perceived \"permissible host\". In particular, the H5N1 virus is believed to have acquired the hemagglutinin (HA) gene from A/goose/Guangdong/1/96 H5N1 and A/teal/ Hong Kong/W312/97 H6N1, while the internal genes were received from A/quail/Hong Kong/G1/97 H2N2 or A/teal/Hong Kong/W312/97 H6N1, respectively [2] , [3] . Even though this particular strain was eliminated by culling millions of chicken, its ancestors remains circulating in aquatic birds. This paper proposes a new approach to pandemic control by constantly monitoring molecular evolution at both macro level (within the group of viruses) and micro level (within the group of strains) using comparative phyloinformatics. This can facilitate prediction of how these viruses are evolving in terms of spatial, temporal, and host dimensions, and therefore, allows for faster responses to new outbreaks as well as their diagnosis. However, corresponding phylogenetic tree construction algorithms suffer from long runtimes due to their high degrees of computational complexity as well as the large datasets involved. Therefore, it is necessary to develop informatics based solutions that use suitable algorithms and take advantage of distributed computing technologies to make such studies feasible in a reasonable amount of time. Furthermore, these solutions need to be integrated in a framework for pandemic control that is biologist-friendly. As a result, effective vaccines and antivirals can be designed more easily and within a shorter response time, since specific local strains can be targeted directly.",

Its most important function is to remove the terminal sialic acids from HA in order to enable the virus budding. Moreover, it helps the virus spreading through the system by additionally removing sialic acids from cell surfaces.

All twelve core sequences are mapped to the Thai clade. Besides these twelve, ten more sequences were found in this clade, whereby eight of them are fragments. The remaining two are actually complete sequences from Thailand (chicken isolates). However, they were annotated as Neuramindase instead of Neuraminidase [12], [13] which explains why these two entries are missing in the core set. However, querying of Uniprot with \"Influenza virus\" and \"NA\" as query terms has returned these two entries which are clearly captured and validated in our phyloinformatics analysis. Zooming out of the Thai clade has shown the Vietnam clade as its nearest neighbor, followed further by the Indian clade with Vietnam strains as their neighbors. On the next higher level Indonesian, Malaysian and Chinese clades are indicated as neighbors. It would be interesting to further study the Indian clade and verify how closely the Indian strains and Vietnamese strains are related with respect to other genes and also at genome level. Such an analysis may lead to the identification of the origin for Bird Flu in India. Further analysis of the large dataset indicates H9N2 as the nearest clade to H5N1 and non-structural protein as nearest to NA within the H5N1_NA group. The overall tree includes isolates from H3N2 to H15N9. A detailed analysis of each clade and sub-clade within this tree and with reference to the other two trees could lead to an understanding of H5N1's molecular evolution at global level.",

The strains of H5N1_NA cluster spatially rather than temporally or according to host. However, there are subtle differences amongst the outputs of the three algorithms with respect to their resolution. The clustering obtained using NJ seems to be better resolved than the other two in terms of branch length and sub-speciation. A detailed analysis of the Thai clade obtained by ProtPars also has revealed that all the sequences from the core set have been represented in this tree as well. The additional isolates are mostly fragments obtained through PCR amplification and uploaded to Uniprot. An interesting aspect of this clade is the finding that the entry Q5EP24 (Chicken isolate from Vietnam) is placed almost as an outlier in this group. It would be interesting to analyze the genealogies of Vietnam and Thailand clades and to verify whether there are any \"bridging\" isolates such as Q5EP24 that may play an important role in the spread of this deadly disease across the globe. We have analyzed our medium dataset to confirm the pattern we obtained with the core set.

Our analysis of H5N1 NA data utilizing different phylogenetic algorithms have indicated a spatial clustering of this virus based on geographical distribution rather than temporal or host. Of course, single gene product analysis is insufficient to arrive at any biologically relevant conclusion and, hence, we propose to do multiple gene and genome level analysis as our future work. However, even for a single gene analysis the computing power required is formidable and we have used this approach as a proof of the concept that high performance computing is a must for any meaningful phyloinformatics study. Even with the limited amount of data, we have been able to find a clear pattern (geographical clustering) and the importance of glycon sites. However, further detailed studies in conjunction with other proteins such as HA, Polymerase etc., and also at gene and genome level, are required to draw firm conclusions. It is also true that interpretation becomes more difficult if the size of the trees becomes very large. In our experience, zooming onto a cluster of interest (e.g. Thailand and China clades) with relative ease and quickness, using the Quascade middleware is an attractive feature of our study.
