            "text": "Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) genome contains three accessory genes: 3a, 3b and 7. Gene 7 is only present in members of coronavirus genus a1, and encodes a hydrophobic protein of 78 aa. To study gene 7 function, a recombinant TGEV virus lacking gene 7 was engineered (rTGEV-D7). Both the mutant and the parental (rTGEV-wt) viruses showed the same growth and viral RNA accumulation kinetics in tissue cultures. Nevertheless, cells infected with rTGEV-D7 virus showed an increased cytopathic effect caused by an enhanced apoptosis mediated by caspase activation. Macromolecular synthesis analysis showed that rTGEV-D7 virus infection led to host translational shut-off and increased cellular RNA degradation compared with rTGEV-wt infection. An increase of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2a) phosphorylation and an enhanced nuclease, most likely RNase L, activity were observed in rTGEV-D7 virus infected cells. These results suggested that the removal of gene 7 promoted an intensified dsRNA-activated host antiviral response. In protein 7 a conserved sequence motif that potentially mediates binding to protein phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit (PP1c), a key regulator of the cell antiviral defenses, was identified. We postulated that TGEV protein 7 may counteract host antiviral response by its association with PP1c. In fact, pull-down assays demonstrated the interaction between TGEV protein 7, but not a protein 7 mutant lacking PP1c binding motif, with PP1. Moreover, the interaction between protein 7 and PP1 was required, during the infection, for eIF2a dephosphorylation and inhibition of cell RNA degradation. Inoculation of newborn piglets with rTGEV-D7 and rTGEV-wt viruses showed that rTGEV-D7 virus presented accelerated growth kinetics and pathology compared with the parental virus. Overall, the results indicated that gene 7 counteracted host cell defenses, and modified TGEV persistence increasing TGEV survival. Therefore, the acquisition of gene 7 by the TGEV genome most likely has provided a selective advantage to the virus.",

In humans, CoVs produce respiratory tract infections, causing from the common cold to severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that may result in death [3, 4, 5] . In animals, CoVs also cause life-threatening diseases, such as severe enteric and respiratory tract infections, and are economically important pathogens [6] .

This pathway includes the activation of double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR), leading to eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2a) phosphorylation, and the activation of the 29-59-oligoadenylate synthetase (29-59OAS) and its effector enzyme, the ribonuclease L (RNase L), responsible for RNA degradation [8, 9, 10, 11, 12] .

A general mechanism for all CoVs is the induction of structures in infected cells that may hide viral RNAs from the cellular sensors [28, 29] . Some CoVs downregulate host gene expression. In fact, it has been proposed that genus b CoV non structural protein (nsp)1 protein promotes host mRNA degradation in order to suppress host innate immune response [30, 31] . Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV nsp1 has also been involved in the inhibition of the 40S ribosomal subunit translational activity [30] . Moreover, several CoVs may also prevent the translational shutoff due to the antiviral response, using viral components or modulating cellular factors. Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) nsp2 acts as a PKR antagonist [32] , and MHV N protein antagonizes 29-59 OAS activity [33] .

The role of some structural genes, such as SARS-CoV genes E and 6, on CoV pathogenesis has been demonstrated [39, 40, 41, 42] . Nevertheless, the role of other SARS-CoV accessory genes in virus replication and pathogenesis is still under study, as SARS-CoV mutants lacking different combinations of these genes revealed that they had limited impact on virus replication and pathogenesis [37, 38] .",

            "text": "TGEV is a genus a1 CoV that contains three accessory genes: 3a, 3b and 7 [43, 44, 45] . The deletion of gene cluster 3ab demonstrated that these genes were not essential for in vitro and in vivo viral replication [45] . TGEV gene 7 is located at the 39end of the genome, being the last ORF. In general, ORFs located in CoV genomes downstream of nucleocapsid (N) gene have been named as gene 7. And, one to three genes, 7a, 7b and 7c, have been described for several CoVs of genus a, b4 and c3 at the end of their genomes [35, 46, 47] [48] . Nevertheless, most of these genes are not related to each other (J.L.G. Cruz, S. Zu\u00f1 iga and L. Enjuanes, unpublished observations). In fact, new genes located in avian CoVs genomes after the N gene have been named differently as they showed no sequence homology to any other CoV genes [49] . TGEV protein 7 is similar to protein 7a of CoV genus a1, with a 72% homology to feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), canine (CCoV) and porcine respiratory (PRCV) CoVs 7a proteins ( Figure 1A ) [50, 51] . The function of protein 7 has not been identified, and it has been proposed that it could play a role in virulence [52, 53] . The 7ab cluster deletion in FIPV (FIPV-D7ab) resulted in virus attenuation [54] . Nevertheless, the specific role that gene 7a plays in attenuation is not clear, as FIPV-D7ab phenotype was similar to the one observed for a FIPV isolate lacking only gene 7b [55] .",

To avoid gene 7 expression, several modifications that led to an inactive ORF7 transcription regulating core sequence (CS) were introduced ( Figure 1B , left panel). The two first nts of protein 7 translation start codon were also removed ( Figure 1B, left panel) . These mutations introduced into the TGEV infectious cDNA, were predicted to knock down gene 7 expression with minimum alteration to the 39end of the viral genome, which is required for viral replication [58, 59] . All the mutations introduced in the cDNA were present in the recovered rTGEV-D7 virus, after 6 passages in tissue culture of a plaquepurified virus, indicating that they were stably maintained in the rTGEV genome. The absence of subgenomic mRNA-7 in rTGEV-D7 infected cells was confirmed by Northern-blot ( Figure 1B, right panel) . Viral titer and genomic RNA (gRNA) levels were analyzed. Intracellular RNA was only analyzed during those times post infection in which viable cells were bound to the plate (up to 24 hpi). Both mutant and parental viruses showed the same virus growth kinetics and gRNA accumulation ( Figure 1C ). The rTGEV-D7 virus titer decreased after 24 hours post infection (hpi) due to the absence of live cells. This result was expected, rTGEV-D7 virus titer decreased at a ratio of 1 log unit per day due to thermal instability and to the absence of viable cells, at this time",

            "text": "Innate immune response is the first line of antiviral defense. Viruses have developed diverse strategies to evade this deleterious response, ensuring their survival. Several CoV accessory genes play a central role in these pathways. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms by which they exert their function are still unknown. The generation of a rTGEV without gene 7 expression allowed us to study the role of protein 7 in the modulation of the antiviral response. The absence of protein 7 during TGEV infection caused an enhanced apoptosis and a translational shutoff, due to an increased cellular RNA degradation and eIF2a phosphorylation. We identified a protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) binding motif in protein 7, and a TGEV protein 7-PP1 interaction was demonstrated. We propose a novel mechanism to counteract dsRNA-induced antiviral response by RNA viruses. In vitro results were in agreement with the enhanced virulence of the gene 7 deletion mutant virus in infected piglets. Our results demonstrated that protein 7 modifies TGEV virulence, reducing virus pathology and increasing the period of virus shedding. This effect also benefits the host decreasing clinical disease and extending its survival. These observations could justify the incorporation and maintenance of gene 7 to genus a1 CoVs during their evolution. CoV protein 7a sequence alignment, using T-COFFEE [135] . Protein 7a sequences from the canine (CCoV) and porcine respiratory (PRCV) CoVs, transmissible gastroenteritis (TGEV) and feline infectious peritonitis (FIPV) viruses were used.

Nevertheless, 2fold larger plaques were produced by rTGEV-D7 (4 mm diameter), compared with those caused by the parental virus (2 mm diameter) (data not shown). Accordingly, in rTGEV-D7 infected cells the infectious foci were larger than those observed in rTGEV-wt infected ones at 16 hpi (Figure 2A , left panels). This increased CPE progressed until almost no viable cells remained in the rTGEV-D7 infection at 24 hpi (Figure 2A , right panels). The cell death induced by the rTGEV-D7 virus was analyzed by permeabilization, propidium iodide (PI) staining and flow cytometry ( Figure 2B ).

Caspase 3 activation leads to TGEV N protein cleavage [64] , and inhibition of caspase 3 processing, among others caspases, prevents TGEV induced apoptosis [63] . To determine the potential influence of gene 7 on caspase dependent apoptosis, the presence of the processed form of caspase 3 was analyzed by Western-blot using specific antibodies. TGEV infection induced the cleavage of caspase 3 ( Figure 3B ) and, as a consequence, cleaved N protein was also detected (data not shown), as expected [64] . Moreover, the rTGEV-D7 triggered caspase 3 processing faster than the wildtype virus.

To determine whether this was also the case for TGEV-D7 virus, de novo protein synthesis during the infection was evaluated by metabolic labeling. No translational stall was detected during rTGEV-wt infection ( Figure 4A ), as described for other CoVs such as IBV and bovine coronavirus (BCoV), or MHV at early times post infection [32, 33, 72] . In contrast, rTGEV-D7 infection inhibited host translational machinery, an effect detected from 10 hpi. This translational stop affected both cellular and viral protein synthesis ( Figure 4A ). CoVs produce viral mRNAs that are structurally similar to those produced by their host (59 CAPstructure and poly A at the 39end), allowing CoVs to parasitize the host translational machinery. In some CoVs, such as MHV, selective viral protein synthesis occurs concomitantly with host translational inhibition, using a mechanism not fully characterized [73, 74] . To study the mechanism responsible for protein synthesis reduction in TGEV-D7 infection, and to analyze whether viral mRNAs were preferentially translated, the amount of radiolabeled N protein, taken as reference for viral protein synthesis, was related to the total amount of protein (viral plus cellular) per well ( Figure 4B ). The ratio of viral to total protein synthesis showed no significant differences between rTGEV-wt and rTGEV-D7 infected cells ( Figure 4B ). In addition, no differences in viral proteins accumulation were observed at this times post infection (data not shown). These results suggested that protein synthesis at early times post infection was responsible for the virus that was still being produced after translational shutoff. This result suggested that the absence of protein 7 during TGEV infection led to protein synthesis inhibition most likely by inhibiting a cell translation step common to cellular and viral protein synthesis.",

            "text": "In principle, RNA decay could be responsible for the observed translational shutoff. Therefore, total cellular RNA integrity was evaluated using a Bioanalyzer [75, 76, 77] . Wild-type virus infection induced a modest RNA processing, especially at 24 hpi ( Figure 5A ). In contrast, rTGEV-D7 infection induced a faster and stronger cellular RNA degradation ( Figure 5A ). This data indicated that the cellular translational shutoff could be due, at least in part, to cellular mRNA degradation. Moreover, the increase in 28S rRNA degradation ( Figure 5B ), could affect both cellular and viral protein synthesis [78] . Nucleases activated by cell apoptosis could be responsible for the observed RNA degradation [79] . To study whether this was the case, we took advantage of the previous description of the inhibition of TGEV induced apoptosis by the addition of caspases inhibitor ZVAD, without affecting virus production [63] . In fact, after infection of ST cells with wt or rTGEV-D7 viruses in the presence of ZVAD, no CPE was observed. Total RNA was extracted from non-treated or ZVADtreated cells, and the same RNA degradation patterns were observed in both cases ( Figure 5C ), indicating that the increased RNA degradation caused by rTGEV-D7 virus was independent of nucleases activated by cell apoptosis. To determine whether the observed cellular RNA cleavage was due to a dsRNA induced antiviral response, ST cells were treated with polyinosinicpolycytidylic acid [Poly(I:C)], which is a potent activator of this type of response [77, 80, 81] . Cells transfected with Poly(I:C) showed the same RNA degradation pattern as those infected with the rTGEV-D7 and parental viruses ( Figure 5D ), in contrast to mock treated cells. These results suggested that the cellular RNA cleavage increase, during rTGEV-D7 infection, was due to an enhancement of dsRNA induced antiviral activity. In general, the main effector of this process is RNase L [81, 82, 83] . To further analyze the relevance of this nuclease during TGEV infection, a recombinant vaccinia virus (VV) system was used. It was previously described that VV does not induce strong RNA degradation, due to the presence of viral genes that inhibit the RNase L system. To efficiently trigger dsRNA activated RNA degradation by RNase L, cells must be infected by VV expressing 29-59 OAS and RNase L [84] . Taking advantage of the wide host range of VV, porcine ST cells were infected with VV, or VVs 29-59 OAS and RNase L. As expected, VV induced a very slight RNA degradation, that was increased by the coexpression of 29-59 OAS and RNase L ( Figure 5D ). Moreover, the RNA degradation pattern produced by the expression of RNase L system was identical to the one observed after rTGEV-D7 infection, strongly suggesting that RNaseL is the main nuclease involved in the increased RNA degradation after rTGEV-D7 infection.",

In non-infected cells 29-59OAS is expressed at background levels that are significantly increased during some viral infections [85, 86] . Therefore, 29-59OAS1 expression during infection by rTGEV-wt and rTGEV-D7 was evaluated by quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR). TGEV-wt infection induced the expression of the 29-59OAS1, as expected ( Figure 6B ) [87] . rTGEV-D7 infection also activated this pathway. Nevertheless, the slight differences in 29-59OAS1 gene expression between rTGEV-wt and rTGEV-D7 infections could not explain the enhanced nuclease activity observed during mutant virus infection ( Figure 6B ), as 29-59OAS1 mRNA level was even lower for rTGEV-D7 than for rTGEV-wt virus ( Figure 6B ). Viral mRNA levels were measured by RT-qPCR, as the ratio between mRNA and gRNA amounts. No significant differences were observed between rTGEV-D7 and rTGEV-wt viruses, for the accumulation kinetics of both N and M protein mRNAs ( Figure 7A ). Nevertheless, RT-qPCR evaluation did not rule out whether viral rTGEV-D7 mRNAs could have been degraded, as the cellular RNAs were. Therefore, viral RNA integrity was evaluated by Northern blot assay. The total RNA amount loaded from rTGEV-D7 infected cells was 1.5 to 2 fold higher than that loaded from rTGEV-wt infected ones, in order to detect possible degradation species. No degradation of viral mRNAs was detected after infection by rTGEV-wt or rTGEV-D7 ( Figure 7B ), suggesting that viral RNAs were not degraded by the increased nuclease activity.",

Wild-type infection increased eIF2a-P levels ( Figure 8A ), reaching a maximum at 8 hpi ( Figure 8B ). As previously described, for other stress conditions, eIF2a-P levels decreased at late times post-infection [90, 91] . Similarly, rTGEV-D7 infection also induced eIF2a phosphorylation ( Figure 8A ) but to significantly higher levels than those observed during rTGEV-wt infection ( Figures 8A  and 8B) . Interestingly, the highest difference was detected at 10 hpi, concomitantly with the time at which the mutant virus induced the translational shutoff ( Figure 8B ). The increased eIF2a phosphorylation was maintained, although at different levels, from 8hpi to 10 hpi, what could be sufficient to account for the translational shutoff, according to previously published studies [92, 93] . Altogether, this result indicated that, besides cellular RNA degradation, rTGEV-D7-induced translational shutoff is probably due to an increased and sustained eIF2a phosphorylation.",

Three ST-HA-7 cellular clones (C1, C2 and C3), with different protein 7 expression levels were selected ( Figure 9B ). The effect of protein 7 provided in trans on apoptosis and cellular RNA degradation was analyzed. Infection of ST cells by rTGEV-D7 caused a stronger apoptosis than the rTGEV-wt virus, as previously observed ( Figure 9C ). Protein 7 provided in trans significantly reduced apoptosis both in rTGEV-D7 infected cells and in rTGEV-wt infected ones ( Figure 9C ). Moreover, infection of ST cells by rTGEV-D7 caused higher RNA degradation than the rTGEV-wt virus, as previously described ( Figure 9D ). The amount of protein 7 directly correlated with the inhibition of RNA degradation, suggesting that protein 7 expression in trans prevented nuclease activation ( Figure 9D ). Furthermore, GADD34 mRNA expression ( Figure S2A ) and eIF2a phosphorylation levels ( Figure S2B ) were reduced by protein 7 expression in trans. Altogether, these results demonstrated that the specific phenotype of the rTGEV-D7 virus was due to TGEV protein 7 absence, as it was reverted to the rTGEV-wt phenotype, in a dose-dependent manner, by providing protein 7 in trans.",

PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) is activated by ER stress, and could participate in eIF2a phosphorylation during viral infection [98, 99] . Activation of PERK requires the prior activation of the ER chaperone immunoglobulin heavy-chain binding protein (BiP), a biomarker for the onset of the ER stress [100, 101] . Similar levels of BiP were observed in rTGEV-wt or in rTGEV-D7 infected cells during infection ( Figure S3B ), suggesting that PERK would not be differentially activated in the cells infected with the gene 7 deletion mutant virus with respect to those infected with the parental virus. These data strongly suggested that an increased kinase activity was not responsible for the increased eIF2a phosphorylation during rTGEV-D7 virus infection.",

            "text": "The PP1 catalytic subunit (PP1c) can interact with more than 50 regulatory partners. The formation of these complexes determines its substrate specificity, sub-cellular location and activity, allowing PP1 to participate in numerous cellular functions [103, 104] . Therefore, although a decrease in PP1 levels was not detected in rTGEV-D7 infected cells, compared with rTGEV-wt infected ones, protein 7 could modulate PP1 activity. To study this possibility, the functional motifs of CoV genus a1 protein 7 were analyzed using the ELM server [105, 106] . A highly conserved sequence at the C-terminus of the protein was identified as the canonical PP1c-binding motif ( Figure 10A ). The consensus PP1cbinding motif includes a short sequence (R/K)VxF, in which x is any amino acid except those with large hydrophobic residues, surrounded by non-polar residues ( Figure 10B ) [103] . Previous studies have demonstrated that the RVxF motif is sufficient to mediate PP1 binding, whereas the surrounding amino acids are responsible for PP1 binding and allosteric modulation of the enzyme activity [107, 108, 109] . This motif is also present in three viral and several cell proteins, such as herpex simplex virus 1 c 1 34.5, human papilomavirus E6 oncoprotein and African swine fever virus DP71L, and mammalian GADD34 proteins ( Figure 10B ). In all cases, these proteins bind PP1c and promote eIF2a dephosphorylation [94, 102, 110, 111, 112, 113] . We have observed that both rTGEV-wt and rTGEV-D7 virus infections trigger the cell antiviral response, leading to an increased eIF2a-P level. We hypothesized that during rTGEV-wt infection protein 7 may interact through its PP1c-binding motif with the PP1 complex, promoting eIF2a dephosphorylation, leading to normal protein synthesis ( Figure 10C ). In contrast, in rTGEV-D7 infection, the virus could not counteract the high eIF2a-P levels, causing translational shutoff and cell damage ( Figure 10C ). TGEV protein 7-PP1 interaction was evaluated using a pull-down assay with ST-HA-7 cells extracts. Immunoprecipitation with anti-HAagarose followed by immunoblotting with anti-HA showed the presence of protein 7 in both the ST-HA-7 input and immunoprecipitated extracts, but not in ST cells extracts, as expected ( Figure 10D ). Immunoblotting with anti-PP1 confirmed that PP1c was pulled-down together with protein 7 ( Figure 10D ). HA-tagged SARS-CoV E protein, which is also a small viral membrane protein was used as a control bait for immunoprecipitation. The interaction between protein 7 and PP1 was specific, as E protein did not co-immunoprecipitate PP1protein ( Figure 10D ). Moreover, an HA-tagged protein 7 mutant, lacking PP1 binding motif, did not co-immunoprecipitate PP1 protein. Altogether, this results demonstrated TGEV protein 7-PP1 interaction. The presence of eIF2a on the co-immunoprecipitated samples was also analyzed. This factor was specifically co-immunoprecipitated both by native and mutant TGEV protein 7 ( Figure 10D ), suggesting that eIF2a was present in the complex formed by TGEV protein 7 and PP1. Furthermore, the interaction between protein 7 and PP1 was also evaluated in the context of TGEV infection. ST-HA-7 cells were mock infected or infected with rTGEV-D7, to avoid competition with the non-tagged protein 7 encoded by the wild-type virus. PP1 co-immunoprecipitated with HA-tagged protein 7 in rTGEV-D7 infected cells ( Figure S4 ), indicating that TGEV protein 7 also interacts with PP1 in the context of TGEV infection. Moreover, in rTGEV-wt infected ST-HA-7 cells, a decrease in the PP1 co-immunoprecipitated by HAtagged protein 7 was observed in relation to the rTGEV-D7 infected cells ( Figure S4B ), indicating that protein 7, expressed from rTGEV-wt virus, also interacts with PP1, and competed with tagged HA-7 protein for the binding to PP1.",

ST cells were transfected with the HA-tagged protein 7 mutant, and the expression of this protein was confirmed by immunofluorescence (data not shown). As previously observed, rTGEV-D7 virus caused an increased RNA degradation ( Figure 11A ) and eIF2a phosphorylation ( Figure 11B ). Interestingly, protein 7 mutant provided in trans did not reduce the RNA degradation and eIF2a phosphorylation caused by rTGEV-D7 virus (Figure 11 ), although eIF2a was also pulled-down by protein 7 mutant. This data strongly indicated that native TGEV protein 7 modulated RNA degradation and eIF2a phosphorylation by its interaction with PP1 protein, supporting our working hypothesis.",

Both viruses showed similar growth kinetics in the lung, although gene 7 deletion mutant virus reached higher titers than the parental virus at early times post infection ( Figure 12A ). Virulent TGEV strains replicate in the villious epithelial cells of the small intestine and in lung cells, causing severe diarrhea in newborn piglets [57, 114, 115] . The respiratory and enteric tropism of the rTGEVs can be modified by the introduction of an S gene from a virulent strain [57, 114, 115] . The rTGEV-D7 deletion mutant used throughout this paper was generated with an exclusively respiratory tropism (see Materials and Methods). To study the relevance of protein 7 in a virulent virus, a recombinant virus with respiratory and enteric tropism, lacking the expression of the gene 7 (rTGEV-SC11-D7) was engineered [57] . Growth in lung of rTGEV-SC11-wt and rTGEV-SC11-D7 viruses was similar to that of the previous mutant and wild-type viruses (data not shown). Interestingly, the rTGEV-SC11-D7 showed accelerated growth kinetics in gut, compared to the wild-type virus ( Figure 12B ). This behavior correlated with more pronounced clinical symptoms ( Figure S5A ). Both rTGEV-SC11-wt and rTGEV-SC11-D7 infected animals had the same final survival ratio (50%) ( Figure S5B ). Nevertheless, animals infected with rTGEV-SC11-D7 died six days before that those infected with rTGEV-SC11-wt ( Figure S5B ). Accordingly, virus was detected only in sentinel animals in contact with rTGEV-wt infected piglets, but not in those in close proximity to the rTGEV-SC11-D7 infected animals ( Figure 12B ). This result suggested that the presence of protein 7 facilitated animal survival and virus shedding.",

Nevertheless, a similar mechanism was previously described for three DNA virus proteins containing a PP1c-binding motif, encoded by herpex simplex virus-1 (c 1 34.5 protein), papilomavirus (E6 protein) and African swine fever virus (DP71L protein) ( Figure 10B ) [102, 110, 111] .

The degradation pattern was Figure 9 . Complementation of rTGEV-D7 produced apoptosis and RNA degradation by protein 7 provided in trans. Generation of ST cells expressing TGEV protein 7 in trans. (A) Scheme of TGEV protein 7 expressed by the gene transfected into ST cells. Hemaglutinin tag (HA, light blue) was inserted after signal peptide (blue). (B) Protein 7 expression levels for the three ST-HA-7 selected cellular clones (C1, C2 and C3), were analyzed by immunofluorescence (left). Tagged protein 7 was detected with an anti-HA antibody stained in green, and cell nucleus were stained in blue. Percentage of HA-7 expressing cells is indicated. HA-7 protein accumulation was evaluated by Western-blot (right). HA-7 band is indicated, and corresponds to tagged protein cleaved form (7 KDa). (C) ST cells, or ST cells expressing HA-tagged protein 7 (ST-HA-7) were used to analyze apoptosis levels by flow cytometry. Apoptosis levels in mock, rTGEV-wt (wt) and rTGEV-D7 (D7) infected cells were evaluated at 12 hpi. Annexin V-PI double staining was performed to differentiate cells in early apoptosis (Annexin V + , PI 2 ) from those in late apoptosis (Annexin V + , PI + ) stages. (D) ST cells and the three ST-HA-7 cell clones obtained were mock, rTGEV-wt or rTGEV-D7 infected. Total RNA was extracted at 18 hpi. Cellular RNA integrity was analyzed using a Bioanalyzer. 28S and 18S rRNAs are indicated on the right. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1002090.g009 [105, 106] ]. (B) Consensus PP1 binding motif, including a short sequence (R/K)VxF (red), surrounded by non-polar residues. This motif is present in other viral and cellular proteins, such as human simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) c 1 34.5, African identical to that observed after specific RNase L activation, suggesting that this nuclease was the responsible for RNA degradation during TGEV infection. Interestingly, 29-59OAS1 expression, which is required for RNase L activation, was similarly increased after infection with both rTGEV-wt and rTGEV-D7 viruses. These results suggested that protein 7 may be modulating the 29-59OAS pathway at a level prior to RNase L activation ( Figure 14) . Activation of 29-59OAS by dsRNA leads to the synthesis of 59-triphosphorylated, 29-59-oligoadenylates (29-59A) required for RNase L dimerization and activation. The 29-59A are highly unstable due to their potential dephosphorylation at the 59end by general phosphatases, leaving the core oligoadenylate that does not efficiently activate RNase L [117] . We propose that the complex PP1-protein 7 may counteract RNase L activation through the dephosphorylation of 29-59A. In fact, native TGEV protein 7 provided in trans reduced RNA degradation, while a protein 7 mutant that did not bound PP1 was unable to decrease RNA degradation. To our knowledge, this is the first report involving PP1 protein on the dsRNA induced RNA degradation pathway. Surprisingly, viral mRNAs were not differentially degraded after infection with rTGEV-wt or rTGEV-D7, indicating that these mRNAs may be hidden from nuclease activity. Initially, protection of these mRNAs could be mediated by their sheltering in double-membrane vesicles (DMVs), induced by CoV infection, and identified in MHV [28] , SARS-CoV [29] , and TGEV infected cells (A. Nogales, L. Enjuanes and F. Almaz\u00e1n, unpublished results). DMVs may provide an environment for viral RNA synthesis, and prevent the action of components of host defenses, such as antiviral nucleases. The mechanisms for viral mRNA protection at later stages of the viral cycle will require further studies.",

In agreement with our results, it has previously been described that the activation of PKR and 29-59OAS/RNase L pathways generally leads to apoptosis [118, 119] . Furthermore, apoptosis initiated by RNase L requires caspase 3 activity [120] . Interestingly, the growth kinetics of both viruses was similar, indicating that the increased antiviral response and apoptosis, did not compromise virus replication. It has been previously described that inhibition of TGEV-induced apoptosis did not enhance viral production [63] . Similarly, in other CoVs, such as SARS-CoV or MHV, downregulation of PKR or RNase L, respectively, did not affect virus growth [96, 121] . Altogether these results suggest that, at least for these CoVs, the dsRNA-activated response did not affect viral replication. Nevertheless, all these CoVs have developed strategies to counteract the dsRNA antiviral response [33, 122, 123] . These strategies could control the deleterious effect that an exacerbated antiviral response may cause in the host, and therefore in long term virus survival [124] . In fact, rTGEV-D7 virus showed an accelerated growth kinetics in vivo compared to rTGEV-wt. This effect was probably due to a premature cell death in the rTGEV-D7 infected animal tissue that promoted a faster initial propagation of the virus.",

A previously evaluated rTGEV without gene 7 expression showed full attenuation, with 100% survival of infected piglets [52] , what is at variance (but not in contradiction) with the results presented in this work. Fortunately, the two deletion mutant viruses used in the Ortego et al 2003 paper and the one used here are completely different. The mutant virus in the Ortego's paper was derived from a already highly attenuated virus, only causing 20% piglet death after virus administration. It is essential to realize that this virus already included many additional attenuating genome changes: (i) five engineered restriction sites preceding genes 3a, E, M, N and 7; (ii) the duplication of sequences preceding these genes, required to avoid gene overlapping. Furthermore this duplicated sequences, located close to the gene TRS, contained an additional TRS that regulate the expression levels of each gene, what probably influenced the expression levels of these viral genes; and (iii) a deletion spanning 21 nt upstream ORF7 start codon and the first 17 nt of this ORF, that was introduced to prevent the expression of gene 7. In contrast, the TGEV deletion mutant used in this work only included a point mutation in gene 7 CS and a 7 nt deletion to prevent the production of protein 7. Therefore, the changes observed in the pathogenicity of the Ortego's recombinant virus could not be exclusively assigned to gene 7 absence, in contrast to the results presented in this paper.",

Similar effects have been described for other viruses, such as human hepatitis C virus [125] , in which tissue damage was associated to the development of an exacerbated host antiviral response and not with viral replication. Moreover, piglets infected with a TGEV virulent enteric strain lacking protein 7 expression (rTGEV-SC11-D7), developed a faster and more pronounced clinical disease. High pathogenicity resulted in a more rapid host elimination, affecting virus long-term survival as the host is essential for virus propagation.

This fragment, containing nt 23,464 to 28,700 of the TGEV genome, and including the mutations, was cloned in the same restriction sites of the full-length pBAC-TGEV-SPTV FL [129] . To generate a rTGEV-D7 virus with both enteric and respiratory tropism a TGEV-SC11 virus backbone was used [57] . To this end, the pSL-3EMND7 SfoI-BamHI fragment was cloned in the same restriction sites of the full-length pBAC-TGEV-SC11 FL [129] .

(TIF)Figure S3 Effect of protein 7 on kinases implicated in eIF2a phosphorylation. (A) Scheme of eIF2a/eIF2a-P equilibrium influenced by PKR, PERK and PP1 activity. (B) Evaluation of phosphorylated PKR (PKR-P), total PKR and BiP accumulation during rTGEV-wt or rTGEV-D7 infections, at indicated hpi, by Western-blot using specific antibodies. b-actin was detected as loading control. (C) Analysis of PP1 accumulation in ST cells infected with rTGEV-wt or rTGEV-D7 at indicated times post infection, by Western-blot using a specific antibody. b-actin was detected as loading control. (TIF) Figure S4 Interaction between PP1 and TGEV protein 7 in the context of TGEV infection. (A) ST mock infected cells, or ST-HA-7 cells infected with rTGEV-D7 were used for immunoprecipitation. Cell extracts from 16 hpi were incubated with anti-HA agarose. Input, flow through (FT), and final elution (CoIP) samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE. The presence of HA-tagged protein 7 and PP1 was analyzed by Western-blot using specific antibodies. (B) ST-HA-7 mock infected cells, or infected with rTGEV-wt or rTGEV-D7 viruses were used for immunoprecipitation as in (A). Co-immunoprecipitated (Co-IP) samples from different experiments were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and HA-tagged protein 7 and PP1 were detected by Western-blot. The graph represents the ratio between PP1 and HA-7 protein, estimated by densitometry. Error bars represent the standard deviation from the different experiments. (TIF) Figure S5 In vivo rTGEV-SC11-D7 virulence. Three-day-old piglets were inoculated with 1610 7 pfu/animal of rTGEV-SC11wt or rTGEV-SC11-D7 viruses, by three routes (oral, intranasal and intragastric) in combination. (A) Clinical symptoms were analyzed during the experiment. The degree of diarrhea was represented: from 0, meaning healthy animal, to 3, meaning acute diarrhea.
