The inventory included the search of peer-reviewed papers, master and technical reports, conference proceedings, manuals, training materials and projects. The search resulted in a low number of PE activity results until the year 2000, followed by a considerable increase (especially from 2012). Most of the identified activities were implemented in Africa and Asia, and focused on surveillance, disease survey and prioritization, and disease control. Seventy-nine PE practitioners working predominantly in Africa, Asia and Europe (29, 22 and 18 respectively) contributed to the email discussion forum. They proposed various modifications to the existing PE definition and discussed different issues related to the applicatoin of PE, its institutionalization for use in policy development, as well as the priorities for future development. The need to increase the number of PE trained people together with some methodological developments and the application of this methodology in developed countries, were some of the points highlighted during the forum. These factors stress the importance of further developing PE as a useful approach for engaging communities in addressing animal and related public health risks.",

For instance, Catley et al. [1] proposed that the term 'participatory' should include the active involvement of the community in the definition of objectives, interpretation of results and development of solutions. Also, in the context of surveillance, Toribio and Rushton [3] suggested that the participatory process involved in PE should empower stakeholders to solve their own problems and become actively involved in the surveillance system. In the last several years, numerous different projects and studies have used participatory methodologies. Catley et al. [1] provided a comprehensive review on the main strengths and weaknesses of PE in the field of animal health; however, there is not yet a systematic compilation of the activities performed. Moreover, some of the issues highlighted in that review may deserve further attention, such as the challenges due to possible conflicts of interest between community priorities and health policy rules, the institutionalisation of PE activities at the international and national level, priorities for further development, or the needed level of community involvement in order to discriminate what activities may be considered PE.",

The following set of key words (in English) was used: (participatory AND (epidemiology OR surveillance OR outbreak OR control) AND animal). For the term animal, an exhaustive list of terminology (326 terms) referring to all major livestock and poultry species was used as described by Beltran-Alcrudo et al. [5] . On top of the most generic names, synonyms and scientific names, the list included additional terms based on expert opinion on the way livestock species of certain age, gender or neutered status are named. The identified livestock groups included bovines, camelids, equid, swine, poultry, rabbits and small ruminants.",

In addition, a more active involvement of the research community was perceived as a way to provide inputs on the limits and strengths of this methodology and was viewed as a way to promote its use.

The reflection of community priorities was seen by several contributors as something mandatory, since these policies should be stakeholder-based in order to ensure the support and sustainability of the system. In this sense, PE methodology was seen as a tool that could fill this gap, as it should enable a closer contact with farmers and an opportunity to organise their concerns.

Finally, the importance of establishing decentralized animal health policies in order to accommodate regional differences was also mentioned. Additional thoughts focused on the need for more training and capacity building to build a bigger PE workforce. The promotion of the use of PE methods in developed countries was perceived as an important way to draw attention to PE and encourage the use of such approaches in other countries.

Further extensions of this study could include a literature search using other languages. Moreover, part of the literature search was based on peer-reviewed papers and therefore all those studies using PE as a methodology which have not been published or were not included in a technical report, manual, or conference proceeding would not have been identified. In addition, the procedure used to identify past and present projects where PE was used as a methodology was mainly based on replies of the people contacted by email. It could be the case that some did not answer due to time constraints or that relevant practitioners involved in PE projects were not identified. We tried to contact as many individuals as possible; however, we acknowledge that some projects will not have been captured in this review. In the email discussion we had contributions from PE practitioners from different parts of the world, however it has to be taken into account that several PE practitioners might not feel comfortable discussing in English and, therefore, the outcome of the email discussion was clearly biased. In order to simplify the implementation of the discussion, we decided to assume this selection bias; however, it would be a useful exercise to conduct further discussions about the issues raised in this paper at the local level and in the local languages to compile a more complete picture.",

This was also mentioned in the review by Catley et al. [1] , where there were doubts about whether some of the included studies would match the proposed 'participatory approach'. The opposite may also happen, when papers failed to clearly describe the PE approaches used and, hence, failed to be incorporated into this study. What is and what is not PE seems to be a critical aspect, and despite the previously reported working definitions, as evidenced by the lack of consensus to classify the three provided examples, the critical question of what is and what is not PE might not be clear enough. It is acknowledged that there was not enough data on these examples in order to assess if they could be considered as PE, but despite this fact, the second example that was just an assessment of knowledge, attitudes and practices by using a structured questionnaire, was considered as a PE activity by several based on the assessment of social factors. In this sense, it might be useful to differentiate between social epidemiology, which aims to study the impact of social factors on health, and PE, which seeks a more active participation of people.",

This reflection was already elaborated by Toribio and Rushton [3] when deciding whether or not to include PE in the membership examination in epidemiology, asking themselves whether PE could be considered an accepted component of epidemiology practice. As described in that paper, PE is considered a young discipline and some aspects such as a critical analysis of the strengths and weaknesses, or examples of how participatory methods could be combined with conventional tools to add value to decision making processes might deserve deeper revision. An attempt was made to cover some of these issues during the email discussion. However, despite some weaknesses being mentioned, there was not a deep debate about them. In our opinion, this was influenced by most participants being very keen in promoting the use of PE and therefore placed more emphasis on the positive aspects rather than the negative ones. A greater involvement of the research community in PE activities was suggested during the email discussion to provide inputs on the limits and strengths of this methodology. It was remarkable that a high percentage of the contributors to this discussion worked at research centres or universities, which could suggest that this is currently being developed and new advances within this methodology might be expected in the near future. Contributors also suggested that OIE and FAO should develop international standards, guidelines and manuals for the veterinary authorities in order to apply PE. In this sense, it is worthwhile mentioning that a recent surveillance manual launched by the OIE [11] has included a chapter where PE is described and that there are already quite a large number of manuals and training materials available on the web (S3 File).",
