The vaccine encodes a fusion protein composed of a truncated HBV core protein, mutated polymerase protein, and two envelope domains. In this study, we assessed the immunogenicity of Ad-HBV administered to cynomolgus monkeys during a non-clinical safety assessment. Methods: The virus was subcutaneously administered at 1.0 \u00d7 10 9 viral particles (VP)/animal (low-dose group), 1.0 \u00d7 10 10 VP/animal (mid-dose group), and 1.0 \u00d7 10 11 VP/animal (high-dose group); the control groups were administered an Ad5-null virus (1.0 \u00d7 10 11 VP/animal) and saline only.",

Although anti-Ad antibody was produced in all groups (except for the saline control), the antibody titers were significantly lower in the high-dose Ad-HBV group than in the group that received the same dose of the Ad-null empty vector. In addition, the IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 expression levels in the liver were significantly improved for the mid-dose, high-dose, and Ad-null control group (p < 0.05), but not for the low-dose group.",

Ad-HBV is a therapeutic vaccine candidate based on human E1-and E3-deleted replication-defective Ad serotype 5 (Ad5) vectors encoding an HBV fusion protein consisting of a truncated form of the HBV core domain (at the N-terminal) fused to a deleted and mutated HBV polymerase sequence, and two HBV envelope domains are inserted within the polymerase deletions. The nucleotide sequence encoding this HBV fusion protein is based on the HBV isolate Y07587, which was slightly modified [9] .

In all cases, Ad-HBV was demonstrated to effectively induce T cells to produce various cytokines [interferon (IFN)-\u03b3/ tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and interleukin (IL)-2] in response to HBV antigen stimulation [9] . However, there were some potential disadvantages noted, including damage to the host immune response, hepatocytoxicity, and a short half-life; thus, non-clinical safety assessment is essential prior to further clinical development and trial as a vaccine. An unsolved challenge in the development of gene therapy drugs is that the vectors and their encoding proteins ultimately become immunogenic in some patients, thereby provoking an immune response resulting in immunotoxicity [11] . In contrast to therapeutic proteins whose immunogenicity is mainly evaluated by measuring the levels of anti-drug antibodies produced, there is currently no well-established and widely accepted method for the immunogenicity assessment of gene therapy drugs [12, 13] . Therefore, in the present study, we focused on evaluating the immunogenicity of the subcutaneous injection of Ads-HBV vaccines in a non-human primate at different doses to obtain reference data through a non-clinical safety assessment in preparation for a clinical trial.",

Moreover, this candidate vaccine has the advantage of gathering three HBV antigens in one vector together with the capacity to induce potent antiviral responses and broad immunogenic characteristics. Thus, Ad-HBV should be selected as a lead candidate for clinical development. High (%) 0(0%) 0 (0%) 5 (50%) *# 6 (60%) *# 5 (50%) *# IL-2 Low (%) 8(80%) 7 (70%) 1 (10%) 3 (30%) 3 (30%)",
