As a result, the existing notifiable disease surveillance system was unable to provide the most basic epidemiologic data for public health decision-making and action. In the wake of the January 2010 earthquake, the Haitian Ministry of Public Health and Population collaborated with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Pan American Health Organization, and other local and international partners to implement a functional national surveillance system. More than 7 years later, it is important to take the opportunity to reflect on progress made on surveillance and response in Haiti, including disease detection, reporting, outbreak investigation, and response. The national epidemiologic surveillance network that started with 51 sites in 2010 has been expanded to 357 sites as of December 2015. Disease outbreaks identified via the surveillance system, or other surveillance approaches, are investigated by epidemiologists trained by the Ministry of Health's Field Epidemiology Training Program. Other related surveillance modules have been developed on the same model and electronic platform, allowing the country to document the impact of interventions, track progress, and monitor health problems. Sustainability remains the greatest challenge since most of the funding for surveillance come from external sources.",

In 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) recorded more than 150 outbreak reports from 36 countries across all the continents with Zika virus and MERS-CoV as the most commonly reported infections. 2 With expanding international travel, a local epidemic has the potential to spread quickly across borders. 1 Thus, it is critical for countries to have well established systems to prevent, detect, and respond to any public health threat.",

However, this binding document signed by 196 countries has been difficult to implement as fewer than 20% of countries had met IHR goals. [5] [6] [7] By 2014, only about one-third of participating countries (64 countries) reported fully achieving the core capacities. 8 The Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA), which includes 55 countries and stakeholder organizations, was launched in 2014 to help nations meet IHR requirements and promote global health security as an international priority. 9 Priorities under GHSA include assisting countries to develop national infectious disease laboratories, electronic public health reporting systems, emergency operations centers, and effectively trained workforce. 7 In 2015, Haiti was approved as a Phase 2 GHSA country providing impetus to examine and build Haiti's disease surveillance systems and preparedness to face new global disease threats.",

Subsequently, the laboratory-based surveillance was expanded to three other sites. In 2013, the system was also expanded to include severe acute respiratory infections (SARIs) and suspected meningitis. Surveillance officers are responsible for ensuring that all eligible patients are identified and specimens are collected. They administer a brief demographic questionnaire regarding including symptoms and patient history. Stool samples from diarrhea cases are tested for cholera, Salmonella, Shigella, as well as rotavirus in the case of patients under the age of 5 years. Blood samples from febrile patients are tested for malaria, dengue, typhoid, and leptospirosis. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from meningitis cases are cultured and tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Haemophilus influenzae. Nasopharyngeal swabs from SARI cases are tested by PCR for influenza virus type A and B.",

            "text": "Haiti has made incremental progress toward developing a robust, timely surveillance system characterized by collaboration between governmental and nongovernmental institutions at the commune, department, and central levels. Routine surveillance has continuously evolved since 2010, expanding in scale and scope with more sites reporting on more conditions every year since. The ability to add diseases and conditions to the system before and during outbreaks, and if necessary set up enhanced complementary components such as cholera surveillance exemplifies the system's adaptability, scalability, and flexibility. The planned integration of community-based surveillance will improve detection of health threats in rural communities where health-care utilization is very low. 20 In line with CDC and WHO guidelines on Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response, the system should be integrated to coordinate and streamline the portfolio of existing surveillance activities and to maximize efficiency and resources, rather than trying to maintain separate vertical activities. 21 The experience of establishing a surveillance system of national scope in Haiti utilizing existing surveillance infrastructure highlights the fact that it is more efficient to integrate existing disease surveillance data flows into a matrix-like structure where vertical (or in-depth) surveillance systems capture the information necessary to meet the surveillance data needs of a horizontal (or broad) system. Cholera surveillance provides a working example of a vertically designed module capable of being integrated into the horizontal routine system. Such an integrated and centralized platform of surveillance is a step in helping Haiti to conform to the 2005 IHR core capacity requirements for surveillance and response. 22, 23 Through a resolution in 2008, WHO emphasized the role of public health laboratories by calling for the organization of a national public health laboratory that would link national, regional, subregional, and international laboratories. 24 Internationally, the national laboratory has already developed partnerships with the relevant regional laboratory (Caribbean Public Health Agency) and reference laboratories (e.g., CDC-Atlanta). Within the country, the national laboratory is working on implementing in-country regional laboratories that will greatly improve the laboratory component of the surveillance system and ensure that laboratory results are linked in surveillance system with cases. Integrating laboratory confirmation into routine surveillance and its complementary systems is essential to minimize delays in taking public health action. 20 The laboratory-enhanced surveillance system represents a significant step in the long-term transition toward laboratory-based surveillance and a model for how the laboratory testing can be best integrated into routine surveillance STRENGTHENING NATIONAL DISEASE SURVEILLANCE AND RESPONSE activities as capacity in this field continues to grow. However, much work remains to be done along this axis. As one example of an area for future improvement, the ongoing implementation of electronic laboratory information management systems will allow testing results to be linked with case data in real time. Furthermore, laboratory diagnostic capacity at the level of health facilities across the country needs to continue to be improved in parallel to the strengthening of regional reference laboratories. To achieve this, in parallel to building diagnostic capacity at this level, sites should be encouraged to routinely send samples to the national laboratory as a part of their quality assurance program.",

These graduates and future residents will be crucial to link public health surveillance function and participation across all levels of the health-care system. To continue to grow Haiti's human resources capacity, Haiti should continue to develop intermediary and frontline personnel such as surveillance officers, who may not be as skilled, but can perform the functions without significant financial burden to the country. 26 Among all of these developments, it would be unwise to not address the system's sustainability. Since 1975, MSPP has implemented surveillance systems in the country; however, fluctuating donor funding and a lack of substantial governmental financial investment have always threatened, and sometimes disrupted, the stability of these systems. The routine surveillance and other surveillance systems continue to be financed by outside sources, threatening overall sustainability. Surveillance should continue to be a focus for MSPP in the coming years to prevent the collapse of these achievements; however, without national financial investments in surveillance, uncertainty will continue to persist.",
