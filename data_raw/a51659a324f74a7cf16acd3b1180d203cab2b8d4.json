Using the Metacore TM database, 29 DEPs were enriched in a network involved in p53 regulation. Besides, a significantly enriched pathway suggests that the CPV-induced cytopathic effect was probably due to the deficiency of functional CFTR caused by CPV infection. This study uncovered the systemic changes in key cellular factors involved in CPV infection and help to understand the molecular mechanisms of the anti-cancer activity of CPV and the cytopathic effects induced by CPV infection.",

Consequently, CPV replication is restricted to the S phase of the cell cycle 1,2 .",

VP2, which represents 90% of the viral capsid, also functions as a viral ligand that determines the viral host specificity and tissue affinity 4 . NS1, a pleiotropic phosphoprotein, is thought to be a culprit of apoptosis of CPV-infected cells. For instance, NS1 of CPV-2 has been shown to induce caspase-dependent and p53-independent apoptosis 5 .",

Severe haemorrhagic enteritis increases the risk for viral translocation and coliform septicaemia, leading to septic shock and ultimately death 8 .

Anti-cancer therapy using a virus that can selectively target cancer cells has become a popular approach. CPV is a virus that can be potentially used to treat cancer 13 . A previous study has shown that CPV2 NS1 can lead to regression of skin tumours in Wistar rats without producing toxic side effects on healthy cells 14 .

The method is considered more sensitive than difference gel electrophoresis, and it has been demonstrated to be effective and accurate in characterising numerous diseases 19, 20 . In this study, we utilised an iTRAQ-labelled mass spectrometry approach to explore the proteomic changes of F81 cells under different cellular growth behaviour induced by CPV infection. Our findings will help to reveal the biological processes of different infection stages and systematically understand the host response under CPV infection.",

The cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 and analysed between 0 and 60 h post-infection (hpi). As shown in Fig. 1a , the mock-infected cells maintained growth without obvious CPEs. In contrast, CPEs in the infection groups became noticeable at 36 hpi and progressed thereafter, and more than half of the cells had become detached at 60 hpi. As shown in Fig. 1b , the viral titre reached a plateau between 24 hpi and 60 hpi, and then rapidly declined. Using the dynamic changes in CPEs and viral titre as a guide, time points between 12 hpi and 60 hpi were selected for comprehensive proteomic analysis during which the viral titre remained high while the CPEs progressed in the infected cells.",

The features of our experimental design and data analysis are as follows: 1. The kinetic changes in the expression levels of cellular proteins along the infection course, consisting of five different time points, were quantified, which represented an improvement over a cross-sectional picture if only a sample from a single time point was analysed; these results provided us a kinetic view of the changed expression of cellular proteins under the cytopathic insult of CPV infection. 2. Two mocks were analysed. These two mocks helped to distinguish the natural kinetics of the cellular protein expression and helped to set reasonable standards to screen the DEPs. 3. Three biological replicates were prepared for each sample to assess inter-experimental variations. 4. The DEPs identified over the whole infection process were determined to be significant by an analysis of variance test, while those at each of the five time points were determined to be significant by the two-tailed unpaired t test.",

However, such a strategy is dissociated from the status of viral infection and the impact on the infected cells. A different strategy in this study was employed that combined the detected significant changes in DEPs with viral replication and CPEs. In view of the CPEs and the one-step growth curve shown in Fig. 1b , the viral titre was increased quickly during the first 12 hpi. In addition, the DEPs involved in the mitotic cell cycle were significantly enriched by up to 6.74% of the total DEPs at 12 hpi (Fig. 3 ). Since the cells had efficient proliferation at 12 hpi, this time point was suitable for studying the cellular proteins involved in autonomous parvovirus replication.",

A previous study has shown that CPV2 NS1 induces apoptosis mainly through the mitochondrial pathway 37 . Coincidently, we found that BAK1 was up-regulated at 48 hpi and 60 hpi in this study. BAK is a pro-apoptotic regulator that plays a central role in mitochondrial membrane permeabilisation 38 . It suppresses tumourigenesis by mediating apoptosis of tumour cells 39 . For example, BAK over-expression can effectively induce apoptosis in gastric cancer cells 40 . Also, elevations in BAK protein levels have been shown to accelerate apoptosis in murine lymphoid, lung cancer, and breast cancer cells 41 . In addition, VDAC2, which can recruit newly synthesised BAK to the mitochondria to carry out apoptosis 42 , was also up-regulated at 48 hpi and 60 hpi in our study. These findings remind us that the anti-cancer activity of CPV may be closely related to the over-expression of BAK1 and the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway that is mediated by it. Lakshman Santra et al. suggest that CPV2 NS1 might be effective against tumours with the p53 mutation 43 . As a critical effector of apoptosis, BAK can participate in the apoptotic process without activation of p53. Therefore, over-expression of the bak gene may be a new strategy for the treatment of tumours, especially for tumours bearing p53 mutations.",

Increased HSP levels make cells more resistant to apoptosis, but they also can increase immunity to cancer 48 .

In this experiment, we also identified that the HSP70 expression level was increased at 60 hpi and the HSP90A expression level was decreased at 48 hpi and 60 hpi.
