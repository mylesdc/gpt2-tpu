            "text": "Natural Killer (NK) cells play a crucial role in the early phase of immune responses against various pathogens. In swine so far only little information about this lymphocyte population exists. Phenotypical analyses with newly developed monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against porcine NKp46 recently revealed that in blood NKp46and NKp46 + cells with NK phenotype exist with comparable cytotoxic properties. In spleen a third NKp46-defined population with NK phenotype was observed that was characterised by a low to negative CD8\u03b1 and increased NKp46 expression. In the current study it is shown that this NKp46 high phenotype was correlated with an increased expression of CD16 and CD27 compared to the CD8\u03b1 + NKp46and NKp46 + NK-cell subsets in spleen and blood. Additionally NKp46 high NK cells expressed elevated levels of the chemokine receptor CXCR3 on mRNA level. Functional analyses revealed that splenic NKp46 high NK cells produced much higher levels of Interferon-\u03b3 and Tumor Necrosis Factor-\u03b1 upon stimulation with cytokines or phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate/Ionomycin compared to the other two subsets. Furthermore, cross-linking of NKp46 by NKp46-specific mAbs led to a superior CD107a expression in the NKp46 high NK cells, thus indicating a higher cytolytic capacity of this subset. Therefore porcine splenic NKp46 high NK cells represent a highly activated subset of NK cells and may play a profound role in the immune surveillance of this organ.",

Besides their role as cytotoxic cells through the production of perforin and granzymes, NK cells are potent producers of cytokines like Interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 and Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-\u03b1 [3] and thus play important roles in immunomodulation and the defence against viral, parasitic and bacterial pathogens [4] . A considerable number of phenotypically and functionally different NK-cell subsets have been identified up to date [5] . For example, human NK cells can be divided into functionally and also developmentally distinct subsets according to their differing expression of CD56 in combination with CD16 [6, 7] and more recently CD11b and CD27 [8] . In the mouse likewise CD27 and CD11b (Mac-1) are used to dissect NK cells into functionally and developmentally different subsets [9] . Additionally, the chemokine receptor CXCR3 is used in combination with CD27 to distinguish NK-cell subsets in the mouse [10] .",

Moreover, in parasitic as well as in viral infections increases in NK cell number and activity have been reported [14, 15] , but also inhibitory effects on NKcell mediated cytotoxicity and cytokine production by viral infections are described [16] [17] [18] [19] . Despite these hints on important functions of porcine NK cells in vivo, so far no investigations on the existence of functionally differing NK-cell subsets have been reported. Nevertheless, a recent study from our group with newly developed monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the activating receptor NKp46 enabled a more comprehensive insight into the phenotype of porcine NK cells and putative subsets [20] .",

Additionally, this NK-cell subset showed an increased cytokine production and cytolytic activity.

This applied to all animals analysed, resulting in a mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) for NKp46 that was 4-7 times higher than in the splenic NKp46 + subset (7258 \u00b1 1649 to 1362 \u00b1 397 respectively, Figure 1B , upper graph). CD8\u03b1 + NKp46 + cells in blood and spleen showed comparable expression levels of the activating receptor (1462 \u00b1 437 and 1362 \u00b1 397 respectively). We then investigated differences in the expression level of CD8\u03b1 in the respective NK-cell subsets. Splenic NKp46 high NK cells showed a significantly reduced level of CD8\u03b1 expression compared to the other splenic NK-cell subsets in all animals analysed Sequences of primers (5\u00b4-3\u00b4) for target genes as well as primer positions on (+) strand, length of specific product in base pairs (bp) and product melting temperature in\u00b0C are indicated.",

            "text": "In human and mice higher CD27 expression on NK cells is associated with an increased cytokine production [9, 10, 46, 47] . If the same holds true for porcine NK cells, splenic NKp46 high CD27 high NK cells should be the most prominent cytokine producers compared to the other subsets. We therefore compared IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 production between the different NK-cell populations in blood and spleen of several individuals (n = 4). Intracellular staining for IFN-\u03b3 in total PBMC and splenocytes was performed after in vitro stimulation with a combination of rhIL-2, rpIL-12 and rpIL-18 overnight. Cells cultured in medium alone served as negative control and did not show any IFN-\u03b3 production. The percentage of IFN-\u03b3 + NK cells was significantly higher in the blood NKp46 + NK-cell subset compared to blood NKp46cells after cytokine stimulation (21.7% \u00b1 4.7 versus 9.7% \u00b1 3.1, respectively, Figure 2A and B). Nevertheless, the produced amount of IFN-\u03b3 per cell, investigated by the MFI, was similar for both blood NK-cell subsets (19 072 \u00b1 7009 for NKp46 + and 20 006 \u00b1 8634 for NKp46 -, Figure 2B , right graph). Splenic NKp46 high NK cells clearly showed the highest frequency of IFN-\u03b3 + cells compared to the other two splenic subsets whereas NKp46cells had the lowest frequency (NKp46 high : 11.2% \u00b1 3.6%, NKp46 + : 7.2% \u00b1 3, NKp46 -: 2.9% \u00b1 1.5, Figure 2A and B) . Additionally, the amount of IFN-\u03b3 produced per cell was considerably higher in the NKp46 high subset (NKp46 high : 25 790 \u00b1 2615, NKp46 + : 10 432 \u00b1 3211, NKp46 -: 12 008 \u00b1 2396, Figure 2B , right graph). Yet, stimulated splenic NK-cell subsets showed an overall lower frequency of IFN-\u03b3 producing cells compared to blood. Results of intracellular cytokine staining were confirmed by ELISA ( Figure 2C ). FACS-sorted CD3 -CD8\u03b1 + NKp46and CD3 -CD8\u03b1 + NKp46 + NK cells from blood and CD3 -CD8\u03b1 + NKp46 -, CD3 -CD8\u03b1 + NKp46 + and CD3 -CD8\u03b1 dim/-NKp46 high NK cells from spleen were stimulated with rhIL-2, rpIL-12 and rpIL-18 overnight and supernatants were tested for IFN-\u03b3 production. Blood NKp46 + NK cells produced higher levels of IFN-\u03b3 (2 to 3-fold) compared to the blood NKp46subset (58 \u00b1 28 ng/mL versus 21 \u00b1 13 ng/mL, respectively, Figure 2C ), which is consistent with the data obtained by flow cytometry. In spleen differences between the NK-cell subsets were much more pronounced as NKp46 high NK cells showed a 5 to 20-fold higher IFN-\u03b3 production compared to the NKp46 + (217 \u00b1 74 ng/mL to 25 \u00b1 12 ng/mL, Figure 2C ), and 14 to 50-fold higher production compared to the NKp46 -NK cells (217 \u00b1 74 ng/ mL to 9 \u00b1 5 ng/mL).",

We used monoclonal antibodies against NKp46 or CD16 to mimic receptor-specific ligands to look at a possible correlation between receptor density and cytolytic activity of the different NK-cell subsets in blood ( Figure 4 ) and spleen ( Figure 5 ). Background degranulation was determined by using irrelevant-isotype matched control antibodies.",

Splenic NKp46 high NK cells showed highly elevated expression of this activating receptor compared to the other two NKp46-defined subsets in spleen as well as in blood in all animals analysed, which could be demonstrated on protein as well as on mRNA level. Additionally, splenic NKp46 high NK cells displayed a strongly decreased expression of CD8\u03b1, a receptor that was so far described to be expressed by all NK cells in the pig [12, 13] . Of note, also the NKp46and NKp46 + NK cells in blood and spleen showed minor differences in their CD8\u03b1 expression. We observed a negative correlation, thus an increase of NKp46 expression was accompanied by decreased expression level of CD8\u03b1. Furthermore, expression levels of CD16 and the TNF-receptor family member CD27 differed between the three NKp46defined NK-cell subsets. CD27 expression was clearly enhanced in splenic CD8\u03b1 dim/-NKp46 high NK cells and this subset also displayed slightly higher levels of CD16 compared to the other two splenic subsets.

Thus, higher CD56 expression [23, 49, 50] as well as higher CD27 expression [46, 47] was associated with higher surface density of NKp46 on human NK cells. Obviously, the latter is akin to the correlation of NKp46 and CD27 we observed in the pig.

CD27 high NK cells show a higher proliferative capacity and additionally an increased cytokine production compared to the CD27 low NK-cell subset [9, 10] .

Consistent with this data, it was already suggested that higher density of the activating receptor NKp46 on the NK-cell surface is associated with higher cytolytic function [23, 48, 50] . Interestingly, we could not observe an obvious synergistic effect after co-crosslinking of both receptors in our study. Nevertheless, similar results were shown for CD16 and NKp46 co-triggering in resting human NK cells [52] . We observed an overall lower cytotoxic activity in the NKp46subset in blood and spleen when stimulated with anti-CD16 antibody, although the expression level of CD16 was only slightly lower as in the NKp46 + NK cells. In our previous study we showed that blood NKp46porcine NK cells had a cytotoxic capacity comparable to blood NKp46 + NK cells in killing assays using xenogeneic and allogeneic cell lines as targets [20] . The lower killing capacity we observed in this study may be caused by the triggering of only a single activation pathway, whereas the killing of target cells is likely to result from the triggering of several activating receptors and/or lack of inhibitory signals.",

Therefore, the higher cytokine production seems to result from a superior cytokine production on a single cell level as indicated by the higher MFI for IFN-\u03b3 in the splenic NKp46 high NK-cell subset. Similar results could be observed for the cytolytic activity determined by CD107a degranulation assays after receptor triggering. Although the proportion of CD107a + cells was not higher in the splenic NKp46 high subset compared to blood NKp46 + NK cells, NKp46 high NK cells showed the highest CD107a expression levels on a per cell basis. Thus, these data may suggest also a higher killing capacity on a single cell level within the splenic NKp46 high NK cells. Taken the functional findings together, our data indicate that NKp46 high NK cells are in a highly activated state and can readily release high amounts of cytokines or cytolytic granules upon stimulation.",

            "text": "To get further insight into the phenotype of the NKp46defined NK-cells subsets in the pig we finally performed RT-qPCR analyses of distinct NK-cell associated markers. Expression analyses of other activating receptors, namely NKp30 and NKG2D, showed no marked differences between the NKp46-defined NK cell subsets in blood as well as in spleen. Splenic NKp46 high NK cells showed slightly lower levels of the NCR-family member NKp30. NKG2D that is described as important NK-cell receptor involved in target recognition in other species [53] was very uniformly expressed between the different NK-cell subsets in the pig, which is consistent with data in mouse and human where NKG2D shows an overall similar expression pattern between different NK-cell subsets [9, 47] . The most prominent difference in expression between the NKp46defined NK-cell subsets was observed for CXCR3. Splenic NKp46 high NK cells showed elevated levels of this chemokine receptor compared to the other two subsets. Likewise, mouse CD27 high NK cells showed the highest levels of CXCR3 and recently a further sub-division of murine NK-cells by these two markers has been proposed [10] . The chemokine receptor CXCR3 is associated with the recruitment of NK cells into the lymph node [54] and accumulation in tumors [55] . In the murine spleen, CXCR3 is important for intrasplenic trafficking of NK cells upon inflammatory signals [56] as well as the mobilisation and migration of NK cells from the spleen into the periphery [57] . Thus, one can speculate that the elevated expression of CXCR3 on porcine splenic NKp46 high NK cells may indicate that this NK-cell subset is in a \"ready-to-go\" state for recruitment of NK cells into the periphery or within the spleen.",

The cytolytic capacity of NKp46-defined NK-cell subsets (CD8\u03b1 + NKp46 -: blue, CD8\u03b1 + NKp46 + : green) isolated from blood was analysed after receptor triggering. Cells were stimulated with rhIL-2 and rpIL-15 overnight. Triggering of NK-receptors was performed by using monoclonal antibodies against NKp46, CD16 or a combination of both. Irrelevant isotype-matched antibody served as negative control. NK-cell receptor mediated degranulation was assessed by measuring the expression of CD107a on the cell surface by four-colour flow cytometry after one hour incubation.
