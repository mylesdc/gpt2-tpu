An RNA pseudoknot structure located in the overlapping region of the gag and pro genes of Simian Retrovirus type 1 (SRV-1) stimulates frameshifting. However, the experimental characterization of SRV-1 pseudoknot (un)folding dynamics and the effect of the base triple formation is lacking. Here, we report the results of our singlemolecule nanomanipulation using optical tweezers and theoretical simulation by steered molecular dynamics. Our results directly reveal that the energetic coupling between loop 2 and stem 1 via minorgroove base triple formation enhances the mechanical stability. The terminal base pair in stem 1 (directly in contact with a translating ribosome at the slippery site) also affects the mechanical stability of the pseudoknot. The \u22121 frameshifting efficiency is positively correlated with the cooperative onestep unfolding force and inversely correlated with the one-step mechanical unfolding rate at zero force. A significantly improved correlation was observed between \u22121 frameshifting efficiency and unfolding rate at forces of 15-35 pN, consistent with the fact that the ribosome is a force-generating molecular motor with helicase activity. No correlation was observed between thermal stability and \u22121 frameshifting efficiency.",

RNA has been found to play increasingly important and diverse regulatory and catalytic roles in many biological processes ranging from replication, transcription, splicing, to translation 1 . In this study, we focus on understanding how the translation reading frame can be regulated by cis-acting mRNA structures. The translation process is highly regulated and remarkably accurate. Normally, the reading frame needs to be maintained at a constant frame (0 frame) because shifting of the reading frame results in the generation of completely different protein products. Minus-one ribosomal frameshifting is a translational regulatory mechanism programmed by cis-acting mRNA structures and widely utilized by viruses and cells 2-13 . During \u2212 1 ribosomal frameshifting, a ribosome is positioned at a certain sequence of mRNA called slippery sequence, and has a certain probability to move one nucleotide backward, before continuing translation in the new reading frame (\u2212 1 frame) 11, 14, 15 . Minus-one frameshifting is important for (i) maintaining a fixed ratio of certain gene products through the translation of a fusion protein by bypassing the original 0 frame stop codon, and (ii) regulating the half-lives of mRNAs by employing mRNA degradation pathways through premature translation termination at a \u2212 1 frame stop codon 11, 13 .",

A mechanistic picture emerging from the conformational and compositional dynamics studies is that a downstream mRNA pseudoknot or hairpin structure may trap the ribosome at a rotated pre-translocation conformation and slow down the subsequent translation steps in the 0 frame. Upon unfolding the downstream mRNA structure by the ribosome, the ribosome rotates back to the normal conformation to release the tension. In the process of unfolding of the downstream structure, the ribosome has a probability to slip into an alternative frame at the slippery site, eventually resulting in the accommodation of a new cognate aminoacyl-tRNA on the first codon in the \u2212 1 frame.",

Neither of the two spacer sequences is expected to affect the (un)folding dynamics of the downstream pseudoknot which has two G-C pair-rich stems (Fig. 1a) . The mRNA-ribosome interaction is assumed not to be significantly affected by the small change of the unstructured single-stranded spacer.

The structure of SF206 reveals consecutive minor-groove base triples formed between stem 1 and loop 2 (Fig. 1c) . Mutations were designed to disrupt the base triples and the base stacking interactions expected to affect frameshifting efficiencies 19 .

We measured the ensemble thermal unfolding of the oligonucleotide constructs for the pseudoknots (containing the residues 1-34) and a control hairpin (containing the residues 1-19) in 20 mM HEPES, 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 7.3 with varying NaCl concentrations (0 mM, 200 mM or 1 M NaCl).

In the buffer with 0 mM NaCl, except for SF348, two apparent transitions (with melting temperatures at T m,1 and T m,2 , T m,1 < T m,2, ) are observed for all pseudoknots (Fig. 2a,c) . In 0 mM NaCl, the T m,2 of SF206 (~80 \u00b0C, Fig. 2a) is similar to the melting temperature of the control hairpin (stem 1 hairpin) (Fig. 2b) , suggesting that stem 2 (T m,1 ) melts before stem 1 (T m,2 ) in the SRV pseudoknots.

SF348 has a significantly lower T m,1 compared to other pseudoknots, probably because the shortened loop 2 creates steric strain resulting in partial deformation of stem 2 and/ or unstacking with stem 1.",

The absence of a correlation is consistent with previous observations 37 and is likely due to the fact that the formation of stem 2 and minor-groove triples (formed between stem 1 and loop 2) in a pseudoknot may exert a coupling effect in stabilizing stem 1 as has been observed in recent nanopore pseudoknot unzipping experiments 45 .

Thus, the triplex stability may correlate with the frameshifting efficiency. However, the thermal melting transitions for the triplex and stem 2 seem not to be resolved, resulting in one overlapped transition (Fig. 2a ,c,e). Thus, the low-temperature transition (T m,1 , Fig. 2a ,c,e) of the pseudoknots corresponds to the melting of both the tertiary triplex structure and stem 2. We did not observe a clear correlation between T m,1 (in 200 mM or 1 M NaCl) and previously measured in vitro frameshifting efficiency (Fig. 2f) 19 . The absence of a correlation might be due to the fact that the melting of the triplex (formed between stem 1 and loop 2) and duplex (stem 2) are not coupled, i.e., triplex and stem 2 melt independently, but with an overlapped broad melting transition. The relatively broad melting transitions and limited resolution of the experimental data prevented us in extracting the thermodynamic parameters for the transitions 9, 15, 46 . Taken together, our experimental ensemble thermal melting results reveal no correlation between thermal stability and in vitro frameshifting efficiency.",

The data suggest the critical role of A26 in stabilizing the stem 1-loop 2 triplex and compacting the pseudoknot structure. A single hydrogen bond is formed between U27 and G15 in the U27\u2022G15-C5 base triple (Fig. 1a,c) 18 , and the U27C mutation in SF220 is not expected to disrupt the hydrogen bond. However, SF220 has a slightly slower migration compared to SF206, which may be due to an unfavorable stacking between A26 and C27 (both with an exocyclic amine group) resulting in a loosened loop 2. SF348 has a similar migration as SF220, probably because SF348 has a smaller size with a 3-nt loop 2, and the shortened loop 2 results in a more compact pseudoknot structure even without tertiary interaction with stem 1.

To gain insight into the possible determinants of SRV-1 pseudoknot structure for stimulating frameshifting, we carried out single-molecule mechanical unfolding studies using optical tweezers. An H-type pseudoknot structure typically unfolds cooperatively at a relatively high force compared to a hairpin 37, 40, 48, 49 . In our force-ramp experiments, all sequences refolded into pseudoknot structures as indicated by the subsequent unfolding traces with a relatively high unfolding force ( Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. S4 ). More than 95% of pulling cycles showed a one-step unfolding transition during stretching with a force loading rate of about 11 pN/s ( Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. S4 and Table S1 ). Consistent with the force-ramp experiment, the extension versus time traces in the constant-force experiment 50 revealed one-step unfolding from pseudoknot to single-stranded conformation ( Fig. 4c and Supplementary Figs S6 and S7b). Clearly, thermal and mechanical unfolding show different pathways (Fig. 5a,b) . The extension changes of one-step unfolding transition are consistent with the prediction of the extensible wormlike chain (EWLC) model 51 for unfolding of pseudoknots into stretched single strands (Supplementary Table S1 and Fig. S5 ). In rare cases, we observed two-step unfolding traces for SF209 (2.0%), SF217 (0.3%), SF220 (1.2%), SF229 (2.8%), and SF348 (5.0%) (see Figs 4b and 5b, and Supplementary Fig. S4j and Table S1 ). A typical one-step pulling cycle has a large hysteresis, while a typical two-step pulling cycle shows decreased unfolding force and has a decreased hysteresis or is reversible. Varying the force loading rate (5 and 20 pN/s) did not significantly affect the one-step unfolding pathway (see Supplementary Fig. S4 and S5 for example) and kinetics (data not shown).",

At least one of the two major peaks e and f were present in all 10 simulations, which correspond to the disruption of stem 2 and partial disruption of stem 1-loop 2 triplex and stem 1 (Fig. 6b ,e,f). The first small peak (peak d, Fig. 6a ) in the force-extension profile is due to the initial disruption of the base pairs in stem 1 and stem 2 (at the two terminal ends of the pseudoknot, Fig. 6b,d) . The last small peak g (Fig. 6a) corresponds to the final unfolding stage of the remaining base pairs in stem 1 (Fig. 6b,g) . The simulations suggest a common unfolding mechanism, in which stem 2 unfolds first, followed by the unfolding of the triplex and stem 1.",

A relatively large spring constant in the simulations may cause the local mechanical melting of stem 1 and stem 2 at the terminal ends, which is indeed observed in our simulations but not in the pulling experiment. In addition, due to the computational expense, we used a pulling rate in the simulation (1 nm/ns or 1 m/s) which is much faster than the experimental pulling rate (100 nm/s). Furthermore, the experimental time and spatial resolutions (1-10 ms and ~1 nm) are relatively low compared to those of the smoothed simulation traces (0.3 ns and 0.3 nm). A similar difference between experimental and simulated force-extension profiles was reported previously 39 . Nevertheless, the SMD simulation results revealed the relative mechanical stabilities of the three major parts of the RNA pseudoknot SF206 and provide insight into the microscopic unfolding mechanism. SRV-1 mRNA pseudoknots mechanically fold in two steps. More than 99% of the experimental force-ramp refolding trajectories contain two transitions (see Fig. 4a ,b and Supplementary Fig. S4 for example). Consistent with the force-ramp experiment, the extension versus time traces in the constant-force experiment 50 reveal two-step folding traces ( Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. S6 ). The first step corresponds to fast and reversible transition between single-stranded and intermediate states with about 6-7 nm extension change ( Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. S6 ). The extension change of the single-stranded state to intermediate state transition indicates the formation of a 19-nt hairpin containing stem 1 of the pseudoknots (Figs 4d and 5b and Supplementary Fig. S6) .",

            "text": "The second step corresponds to the transition from intermediate state to pseudoknot with 4-5 nm extension change for all the pseudoknots except SF348. For SF348 with a shortened loop 2 ( Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. S1 ), we didn't observe extension change for the transition from intermediate state to pseudoknot ( Supplementary Fig. S7a,c) . After the formation of the pseudoknot structure at low forces, the extension versus time (constant-force) trajectory is stable without hopping (Fig. 4d) , which is consistent with the fact that pseudoknots have relatively high unfolding forces as previously reported 37 on the extension versus time curves (see Supplementary Fig. S6a) , that one of the relatively unstable pseudoknots, SF217, has a lifetime of about tens of seconds for the pseudoknot structure at 15-17 pN. The rapid exchange between the single strand and the hairpin conformations suggests that the stem 1 hairpin structure unfolds and folds multiple times before the native pseudoknot structure can form (Fig. 5b) . SF348 has a similar folding pattern with a relatively smaller extension change for the transition from the intermediate state to the pseudoknot state (Supplementary Fig. S7a,c) due to the presence of a significantly shortened loop 2 ( Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. S1 ). We did not observe the intermediate with stem 2-containing hairpin forming. The formation of stem 2-containing hairpin from single strand would result in an extension decrease of about 8-10 nm at the force range of 10-30 pN, instead of our observed extension decrease of 6-7 nm for the first folding step (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Figs S6 and S7 ). Taken together, stem 1 forms before stem 2 during mechanical folding (Fig. 5b) . Minor-groove base triples enhance the mRNA pseudoknot mechanical stability and thereby stimulate frameshifting. We extracted the pseudoknot one-step unfolding kinetics from unfolding force distributions using Dudko's method ( Supplementary Figs S8 and S9) 52 . Bell's model (see Supplementary methods) was used to fit the force-dependent unfolding rates to extract the rate constant at zero force (k 0 ) (Fig. 7b,c) . A26C mutation in SF217 is expected to result in the disruption of the A26\u2022G4-C16 base triple and base stacking among A25, A26 and U27 (Fig. 1c) 18 . We observed, compared to SF206, a relatively large increase (from \u2212 15.8 \u00b1 0.9 to \u2212 12.8 \u00b1 1.1 s \u22121 ) in one-step mechanical unfolding rate at zero force, lnk 0 (or lnk (0pN) ) and reduction in mean unfolding force (from 33.3 \u00b1 2.2 pN to 27.9 \u00b1 2.2 pN) (Fig. 7a,c) , consistent with the previously observed 19 decrease in frameshifting efficiency (from 21.0% to 6.6%).",

The relative mechanical stabilities (SF206 > SF220 > SF217) are consistent with the relative gel mobilities observed in the PAGE experiment (Fig. 3) , suggesting that gel mobility correlates with structural compactness and mechanical stability for the pseudoknots of the similar size and with the same stem 1 and stem 2.",

Our single-molecule data suggest the critical role of A26 in stabilizing the stem 1-loop 2 triplex and the pseudoknot, consistent with our PAGE result (Fig. 3) . A mutant with a decreased unfolding force typically corresponds to an increased unfolding rate. However, compared to SF217 (A26C), SF229 showed a decrease in lnk 0 value (from \u2212 12.8 \u00b1 1.1 to \u2212 13.6 \u00b1 1.1 s \u22121 ) (Fig. 7c) . The opposite trends of mean unfolding force and unfolding rate observed for SF217 and SF229 might imply that, due to the force generation 52 .

The correlation is best at a stretching force of around 25 pN (see Supplementary Fig. S10 ). (f) In vitro frameshifting efficiency 19 has no correlation with mechanical unfolding transition state position X \u2260 . Error bars of both force and frameshifting efficiency represent standard deviations. Errors of lnk and X \u2260 are reported as standard errors. by the ribosome on the mRNA structure 54-57 , the frameshifting efficiency may correlate better with unfolding kinetics at nonzero forces. Indeed, we observed an improved correlation between frameshifting efficiency and mechanical unfolding rates at forces of 20-30 pN (Fig. 7c-e, Supplementary Fig. S10) . It is also possible that a ribosome exerts its helicase activity by directly acting on some of the loop 2 residues. Thus, compared to other SRV-1 pseudoknots with a purine-rich loop 2, SF229 (with a pyrimidine-rich loop 2) may have varied interactions with the ribosome, which may in turn affect the frameshifting efficiency.",

As revealed by the Cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) studies of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV)-rabbit ribosome complexes, the downstream pseudoknot structure is in direct contact with the ribosome at the slippery site 58 . We tested the effect of the terminal Watson\u2212 Crick base pair of stem 1 of SRV-1 pseudoknot (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. S1 ), which is directly in contact with the ribosome (Fig. 5c) , on the mechanical unfolding and frameshifting 19 . Consistent with our thermal denaturation data (Fig. 2e) and thermodynamic nearest-neighbor model prediction [42] [43] [44] , the mean one-step unfolding forces of SF206, SF209 and SF211 showed the same trend although they are within a small range (33.3 \u00b1 2.2, 31.9 \u00b1 2.1, and 30.5 \u00b1 1.9 pN, respectively) ( Fig. 7a and Supplementary Fig. S8 ).

We observed a better correlation between unfolding rate and frameshifting efficiency at nonzero forces for SF206, SF209, and SF211 (Fig. 7c-e and Supplementary Fig. S10 ). As applying stretching force destabilizes the RNA structures, our results imply that stem 1 is destabilized by the translocating ribosome which has helicase activity 57 in unwinding mRNA structures. Thus, the 5\u2032 terminal base pairs in stem 1, which is in direct contact with the translocating ribosome, can modulate mechanical stability of the pseudoknot and thus frameshifting efficiency, consistent with previous studies on the frameshift-inducing HIV-1 hairpin 17 and antisense oligonucleotides 23 . Thus, frameshifting can be stimulated by enhancing the local stability of the base pairs positioned at the mRNA entrance channel of the ribosome (Fig. 5c ) through (i) directly improving the local base pairing interactions and (ii) indirect energetic coupling by triplex formation.",

We compared the mean one-step unfolding forces ( Fig. 7a and Supplementary Fig. S8 ) to the in vitro frameshifting efficiency values measured previously 19 . The mean one-step unfolding forces have a positive correlation with in vitro frameshifting efficiencies. The unfolding rate constant extracted from Bell's model showed an inverse correlation with in vitro frameshifting efficiency (Fig. 7a-e, Supplementary Figs S9 , and S10 and Tables S1 and S2). Importantly, we note that the inverse correlation between the one-step unfolding rate and frameshifting efficiency was clearly observed in a broad range of forces from 0 to 40 pN (Fig. 7c -e and Supplementary Fig. S10 ). An improved correlation was observed when the forces were closer to the unfolding forces (15-35 pN) , consistent with the fact that a ribosome is a force-generating molecular motor with helicase activity [54] [55] [56] [57] . For example, by applying mechanical stretching force on the translating E. coli ribosome and the 3\u2032 end of an unstructured mRNA, it has been estimated that an actively translating E. coli ribosome can resist a force of about 13 pN 55 . It is in reasonable agreement with an improved correlation between frameshifting efficiency and SRV-1 mRNA pseudoknot unfolding kinetics when the forces are closer to the unfolding forces (15-35 pN) . The discrepancy of the force magnitudes (resistant force of 13 pN for E. coli ribosome versus SRV-1 mRNA pseudoknot unfolding force of 15-35 pN) may be due to the reasons shown below. (i) As a ribosome is a large RNA-protein complex, it is likely that the resistant force of the ribosome is highly dependent on the points of the applied force. (ii) The frameshifting efficiencies for SRV-1 pseudoknots were previously measured for an eukaryotic ribosome (using a commercially available in vitro translation system) 19 . (iii) During ribosomal frameshifting, a ribosome in contact with a downstream frameshifting stimulatory mRNA structure can pause seconds to minutes and change its conformation [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] to facilitate the unwinding of highly stable mRNA structures including pseudoknots. The distances between the folded state and unfolding transition state (X \u2021 ) showed no correlation with frameshifting efficiencies and are about 2 nm for all pseudoknots (Fig. 7f) , which is consistent with the previous results on the unfolding of human telomerase RNA and other pseudoknots 38, 48 .",

Although, the directions and points of the applied force may not be the same as those of the force generated by a ribosome (Fig. 5b,c) , our single-molecule mechanical unfolding results provide unique insights into how compaction of a pseudoknot through coaxial stacking and stem-loop interactions may stabilize the component stems. The single-molecule mechanical unfolding results of SRV-1 pseudoknots suggest that the cooperative mean unfolding force has a positive correlation with \u2212 1 frameshifting efficiency when the slippery sequence and the spacer are maintained largely constant, consistent with previous studies 35, 37 . However, the possible correlation between mechanical unfolding rate and frameshifting efficiency has not been extensively investigated, due to a limited number of mutants studied or a small number of pulling traces obtained for the native pseudoknots [35] [36] [37] 39 . We showed in this study that the cooperative mechanical unfolding rates of the seven SRV-1 pseudoknots studied are inversely proportional to frameshifting efficiencies in a wide range of stretching forces. An improved correlation was observed at the stretching forces of 15-35 pN, consistent with the fact that ribosome is a force-generating molecular motor with helicase activity [54] [55] [56] [57] .",

Each sample was mixed with 6\u00d7 loading dye (QIAGEN) and diluted with buffer to have a final 1\u00d7 loading dye and a final RNA concentration of 1 \u03bc M. Then 20 \u03bc L of each sample was loaded onto a 15% native polyacrylamide gel with 1\u00d7 TBE (89 mM Tris/Borate, 2 mM EDTA, pH 8.3) running buffer. The gel was run at 250 V for 10 h at 4 \u00b0C, and was post-stained with ethidium bromide.",

The ~1160-nt RNA molecules were made by PCR amplification of the plasmids followed by in vitro transcription by T3 RNA polymerase (Promega). The RNAs contain a 475-nt upstream sequence, a 2-nt single-stranded linker (GA), the pseudoknot sequences, a downstream 2-nt single-stranded linker (AU), and a 630-nt downstream sequence. The RNAs were annealed with complementary strands of PCR-generated 475-bp and 630-bp double-stranded DNAs (dsDNAs) to generate RNA/DNA hybrid handles (handle A and handle B). T4 DNA polymerase (NEB) was used to label the 3\u2032 end of the DNA strand of handle A by introducing biotin-16-dUTP (Roche). Handle B was labeled at the 5\u2032 end of the DNA strand by digoxigenin labeled primer during PCR. 1.8-\u03bc m Streptavidin coated polystyrene beads were purchased from Spherotech. Recombinant protein G (Thermo Scientific) was coated on 3-\u03bc m carboxyl coated polystyrene beads (Spherotech) using EDC (Sigma) and sulfo-NHS (Thermo Scientific). Dimethyl pimelimidate (Thermo Scientific) was used to cross-link anti-digoxigenin antibody to the protein G-coated beads. Only appropriately annealed DNA/RNA hybrids are able to form a tether with both types of beads.",

In a force-ramp experiment, the force was changed by moving the optical trap at a force loading rates of about 11 pN/s, with a constant stiffness of about 0.06 pN/nm. The force was maintained by a 200 Hz electronic force feedback in constant-force experiments. The data acquisition rate was 1000 Hz.
