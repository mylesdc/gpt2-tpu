            "text": "Bacterial and viral infections often present with similar symptoms. Etiologic misdiagnosis can alter the trajectory of patient care, including antibiotic overuse. A host-protein signature comprising tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), interferon gamma-induced protein-10 (IP-10), and C-reactive protein (CRP) was validated recently for differentiating bacterial from viral disease. However, a focused head-to-head comparison of its diagnostic performance against other biomarker candidates for this indication was lacking in patients with respiratory infection and fever without source. We compared the signature to other biomarkers and prediction rules using specimens collected prospectively at two secondary medical centers from children and adults. Inclusion criteria included fever > 37.5\u00b0C, symptom duration \u2264 12 days, and presentation with respiratory infection or fever without source. Comparator method was based on expert panel adjudication. Signature and biomarker cutoffs and prediction rules were predefined. Of 493 potentially eligible patients, 314 were assigned unanimous expert panel diagnosis and also had sufficient specimen volume. The resulting cohort comprised 175 (56%) viral and 139 (44%) bacterial infections. Signature sensitivity 93.5% (95% CI 89.1-97.9%), specificity 94.3% (95% CI 90.7-98.0%), or both were significantly higher (all p values < 0.01) than for CRP, procalcitonin, interleukin-6, human neutrophil lipocalin, white blood cell count, absolute neutrophil count, and prediction rules. Signature identified as viral 50/57 viral patients prescribed antibiotics, suggesting potential to reduce antibiotic overuse by 88%. The host-protein signature demonstrated superior diagnostic performance in differentiating viral from bacterial respiratory infections and fever without source. Future utility studies are warranted to validate potential to reduce antibiotic overuse.",

Molecular testing expands our capability to detect specific pathogens; yet, test interpretation can be confounded by pathogen co-infections and significant carriage rates of potentially pathogenic microorganisms, such that molecular tests may contribute to over and under diagnosis [5] . Notably, pathogen-based tests are inherently limited by requirement to sample the infection focus, which is especially challenging in lower respiratory infections and fever without source.

Multiple candidates have been documented, including traditional cellular markers (e.g., white blood cell count, WBC [2] and absolute neutrophil count, ANC [8] ) and soluble host-proteins, both classical (e.g., interleukin-6, IL-6 [9] ; C-reactive protein, CRP [2, [10] [11] [12] ; and procalcitonin, PCT [2, 10, [12] [13] [14] ) and others (e.g., human neutrophil lipocalin, HNL/NGAL [15] ). There are also panels of host nucleic acids in the early stages of development [16] [17] [18] . Additionally, various prediction models have been proposed that combined several markers, for example, the Lab-score, which integrates PCT, CRP, and urinary dipstick results [19] . To date, wide adoption of such biomarkers and prediction rules for discriminating between bacterial and viral infections has been limited by one or more of the following: lack of rigorous clinical validation [7] , narrow applicability (to certain settings, populations, or clinical syndromes) [20] , disputed cutoffs [21] , and not enough added value beyond standard-of-care [22] [23] [24] .",

This is the first diagnostic test based on soluble host-proteins to include both viral-and bacterial-induced biomarkers: tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), which exhibits induced expression in viral infections and reduced expression in bacterial infection; interferon gamma-induced protein-10 (IP-10) that is induced to a greater extent in viral infections and lesser extent in bacterial infections; and CRP, which exhibits the opposite pattern to IP-10. The diagnostic performance has been validated in two double-blind studies [27, 28] , with sensitivity 86.7% (95% confidence interval 75.8-93.1%) and 93.8% (95% CI 87.8-99.8%) and specificity 91.1% (95% CI 87.9-93.6%) and 89.8% (95% CI 85.6-94.0%), respectively. In these former studies, a head-to-head comparison of its diagnostic performance with other biomarkers (at multiple cutoffs) and prediction rules was lacking in patients with respiratory infection (both upper and lower) and fever without source.",

We did not examine nucleic acid panels as, although several research studies support promising performance for differentiating between bacterial and viral infections [16] [17] [18] , currently there are no affordable technologies for measuring multiple RNAs in a quantitative manner in under an hour, restricting application of nucleic acid biomarkers at point-of-care.

The diagnostic value of integrating bacterial and viral biomarkers is supported by a proof-of-concept study of 54 febrile emergency department patients that reported improved discrimination between microbiologically confirmed bacterial and viral infections when TRAIL, IP-10, and PCT were combined into a model as compared to any of the individual biomarkers [38] . In the case of the signature, it is likely that the distinctive expression dynamics of the three proteins in response to bacterial versus viral infections [25] [26] [27] [28] contributes to its superior performance.",

One of the challenges in evaluating tests to distinguish bacterial from viral infection is the lack of a gold standard for etiologic diagnosis [36] . To address this, many studies employ microbiological confirmation as a comparator method, which has the advantage of being well-established and reproducible but the notable disadvantage of restricting the cohort to a small proportion of patients, with likely enrichment for easy to diagnose cases. Indeed, there were 153 patients in the subgroup for whom there was clinically relevant microbiological confirmation of the unanimous expert diagnosis as compared to 314 in the full cohort of patients with unanimous expert diagnosis. Although employing expert panel adjudication has the potential to introduce errors, this comparator method has the fundamental advantage of encompassing a greater proportion of patients and consequently, a study cohort that more closely resembles the real clinical setting, especially relevant for respiratory infections and fever without source that can be hard to diagnose at presentation. Other key strengths are the breadth of index tests compared and that their cutoffs were defined before data analysis.",

Much antibiotic overuse occurs in outpatient settings, particularly for respiratory infections [39] , and since the prevalence of viral infections is typically higher and the severity of disease likely lower, future studies of the signature's diagnostic performance in physician's offices are planned. Furthermore, immunocompromised patients and oncology patients were excluded from The host-protein signature assigned equivocal results to 10.3, 11.6, 11.5, and 14% of patients for the atypical bacteria, RSV, influenza, and adenovirus subgroups, respectively (see Supplementary Figure 1 for additional index test cutoffs this study, populations that would benefit greatly from such a test and merit future study. Another limitation is that the expert panelists were provided with CRP, WBC, and ANC data, introducing a potential incorporation bias when evaluating the diagnostic performance of any tests that incorporate one or more of these biomarkers, including the host-protein signature. However, since clinicians often employ CRP, WBC, and ANC as part of routine care to decide the etiology of infection, it was reasoned that the comparator method may be impaired if the panelists were blinded to these data. Notably, despite the largest potential incorporation bias, the individual biomarkers CRP, WBC, and ANC did not yield superior performance.",

The need for such tests is highlighted by the finding that the treating physicians prescribed antibiotics to one third of the viral-infected patients in the present study cohort. The host-protein signature identified 88% of these cases as viral infections, and therefore, has the potential to reduce antibiotic overuse considerably. Importantly, because both sensitivity and specificity are over 93%, this potential may be fulfilled, as the clinician can be confident about the signature's performance at both ruling-in and ruling-out bacterial infection. This said, the test is not a substitute for physician education on clinical diagnosis and judicious antibiotic use; the host-protein signature is intended for use in conjunction with clinical assessments and other laboratory findings as an aid to differentiate bacterial from viral infection. Future health and economic outcome research is warranted to evaluate the impact of incorporating the signature into routine patient care.",

Bottom left panel: influenza virus (number of patients with bacterial respiratory infection = 112, number of patients with influenza infection = 27).
