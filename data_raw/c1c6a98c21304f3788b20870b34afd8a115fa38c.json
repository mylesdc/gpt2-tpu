What type State and local health departments continue to face unprecedented challenges in preparing for, recognizing, and responding to threats to the public's health. The attacks of 11 September 2001 and the ensuing anthrax mailings of 2001 highlighted the public health readiness and response hurdles posed by intentionally caused injury and illness. At the same time, recent natural disasters have highlighted the need for comparable public health readiness and response capabilities. Public health readiness and response activities can be conceptualized similarly for intentional attacks, natural disasters, and human-caused accidents. Consistent with this view, the federal government has adopted the all-hazards response model as its fundamental paradigm. Adoption of this paradigm provides powerful improvements in efficiency and efficacy, because it reduces the need to create a complex family of situation-specific preparedness and response activities. However, in practice, public health preparedness requires additional models and tools to provide a framework to better understand and prioritize emergency readiness and response needs, as well as to facilitate solutions; this is particularly true at the local health department level. Here, we propose to extend the use of the Haddon matrix-a conceptual model used for more than two decades in injury prevention and response strategies-for this purpose. of advance planning strategy could a local public health department use to identify the contributing factors to this public health emergency? What approaches could a local public health department use to deliver comprehensive public health prevention, intervention, and risk communication measures before, during, and after such an outbreak?",

This SARS model of the Haddon matrix views infectious disease as a form of injury affecting the population on a broad scale. The model allows its users to better understand the multidimensional nature of the epidemic and to identify targets for prevention, mitigation, and intervention. By identifying targeted points of intervention (noted with asterisks in Table 3 ), we can discover potential measures to successfully mitigate the public health threat before, during, and after a SARS event. considered in the event of an emerging infectious disease outbreak such as SARS (Loutfy et al. 2004; Svoboda et al. 2004) . Lessons on public health readiness are often learned painfully after large crises, as was the case during the SARS outbreak of 2003 (Campbell 2004; Hearne et al. 2004 ). Using the Haddon matrix before an event occurs allows us to consider the interplay of variables that might otherwise have been missed (and were missed during the actual events associated with the SARS outbreak). For example, in the preevent phase under physical environment, the Haddon matrix reveals the importance of addressing the need for adequate personal protective equipment; this may seem obvious enough in hindsight, but this issue received insufficient attention before the SARS outbreaks in 2003 (Campbell 2004; Reznikovich and Balicer 2004) .",
