            "text": "Recent epidemiological data indicate that outbreaks of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD), which can be categorized according to its clinical symptoms as typical or atypical, have markedly increased worldwide. A primary causative agent for typical HFMD outbreaks, enterovirus 71 (EV71), has been shown to manipulate the cell cycle in S phase for own replication; however, it is not clear whether coxsackievirus (CVA6), the main agent for atypical HFMD, also regulates the host cell cycle. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that CVA6 infection arrests the host cell cycle in G0/G1-phase. Furthermore, synchronization in G0/G1 phase, but not S phase or G2/M phase, promotes viral production. To investigate the mechanism of cell cycle arrest induced by CVA6 infection, we analyzed cell cycle progression after cell cycle synchronization at G0/G1 or G2/M. Our results demonstrate that CVA6 infection promotes G0/G1 phase entry from G2/M phase, and inhibits G0/G1 exit into S phase. In line with its role to arrest cells in G0/G1 phase, the expression of cyclinD1, CDK4, cyclinE1, CDK2, cyclinB1, CDK1, P53, P21, and P16 is regulated by CVA6. Finally, the non-structural proteins of CVA6, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 3D and protease 3C , are demonstrated to be responsible for the G0/G1-phase arrest. These findings suggest that CVA6 infection arrested cell cycle in G0/G1-phase via non-structural proteins 3D and 3C, which may provide favorable environments for virus production.",

Epidemiological results show that typical HFMD usually is caused by enterovirus 71 (EV71) or coxsackievirus A16 (CA16) (Chan et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2012) . Atypical HFMD, on the other hand, is characterized by severe rash, onychomadesis in young children, and a higher rate of infection in adults, and it is usually induced by coxsackievirus A6 (CVA6). Increasing epidemiological data indicates that outbreaks of CVA6-associated HFMD have markedly increased worldwide in recent years Laga et al., 2016; Li J. S. et al., 2016; Li W. et al., 2016; Mirand et al., 2016) . However, the current vaccine development, drug development or basic research for HFMD principally targets EV71 and CA16. Therefore, strategies for preventing and treating CVA6-related-HFMD are scarce, and even the current knowledge on the infection, pathogenic mechanism, and immunogenicity of CVA6 remains limited.",

Examples can be found among DNA viruses, retroviruses, and RNA viruses. Small DNA viruses, such as simian virus 40 (DeCaprio et al., 1988) , adenovirus (Howe et al., 1990; Eckner et al., 1994) , and human papillomavirus (Werness et al., 1990) , as well as large DNA viruses, such as herpesviruses (Flemington, 2001) , can arrest the host cell cycle to utilize host resources. The Vpr protein of the retrovirus human immunodeficiency virus type 1 is responsible for accumulating cells in G2/M phase (He et al., 1995; Goh et al., 1998) . Among RNA viruses, the coronavirus family virus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) arrests cells in S and G2/M-phase for viral proliferation (Dove et al., 2006; Li et al., 2007) ; mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) (Chen and Makino, 2004) , severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Yuan et al., 2005 (Yuan et al., , 2006 and enterovirus 68 can induce cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase. The etiological agents for typical HFMD, EV71 and CA16, induce cell cycle arrest in S phase for viral production through non-structural protein 3D (Yu et al., 2015) . However, whether the atypical HFMD agent, CVA6, regulates the host cell cycle is not clear.",

Up-regulation of P53 and P16 can inhibit the activity of cyclinD/CDK4 or cyclinD/CDK6 complexes to arrest the cell cycle at G0/G1 phase (Sherr and Roberts, 1995) .

These data suggest that CVA6 infection induces G0/G1-phase accumulation.

At 2 h post-infection, the genomic RNA level in G2/M phase-synchronized cells was not different from the control non-synchronized cells ( Figure 4C) ; however, at 24 h post-infection the genomic level in the synchronized cells was significantly lower than in the control cells (P < 0.01; Figure 4D ). The VP1 expression in G2/M phase-synchronized cells was lower than in control cells at 24 h post-infection (P < 0.01; Figure 4E ). Meanwhile, the TCID 50 /mL of total viruses including supernatant and intracellular viruses was obviously lower in the G2/M phase-synchronized cells (2.95 \u00b1 0.91 \u00d7 10 5 ) than that in the control non-synchronized cells (3.10 \u00b1 0.74 \u00d7 10 6 ) at 24 h post-infection (P < 0.01; Figure 4F ). Therefore, these results indicate that synchronization in G2/M phase does not affect viral entry, but decreases CVA6 production. Therefore, the enhancement of CVA6 replication upon cell cycle arrest is specific for the G0/G1 phase. Followed that, Oridonin, which is an active diterpeniod isolated from Rabdosia rubescens, was utilized to confirm the effects of G2/M-related drugs on viral production. Oridonin induces cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase through inducing DNA damage Zheng et al., 2017) , which is different from nocodazole through interfering with the polymerization of microtubules. To induce G2/M phase synchronization, cells were treated with 8 \u00b5M Oridonin (Figure 5A) . Oridonin obviously accumulated cells in G2/M phase (P < 0.001; Figure 5B ). We also examined the effects of Oridonin on genomic RNA levels. At 2 h post-infection, the genomic RNA level in the control cells was not obvious different with that in G2/M phase-synchronized cells ( Figure 5C) ; however, at 24 h post-infection the genomic level in the G2/M synchronized cells was lower than in the control nonsynchronized cells (P < 0.001; Figure 5D ).

RD cells, mock-infected (M) or infected with CVA6 (I) at an MOI of 1, were collected at 0, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h. The expression of CDK4, CDK6, cyclinD1, P53, P21, P16, cyclinE1, CDK2, cyclinB1, CDK1, and VP1 proteins was analyzed. Histone is the loading control. The results were representative of three independent experiments. Yuan et al., 2006) , we assessed whether the exogenous expression of the non-structural proteins 3D and 3C of CVA6 might mediate G0/G1 arrest. Our results demonstrate that 3D expression shifted the cells toward G0/G1 phase, and the extent of the arrest in G0/G1 phase was dependent on the dose of 3D plasmid that was transfected (0, 0.5, 1, 2 \u00b5g) (R = 0.897; P < 0.001). Similar results were observed for 3C (R = 0.924; P < 0.001) (Figures 8A,B) . To further confirm the role of 3C and 3D in manipulating G0/G1 phase, we transfected PEGFP, 3C-PEGFP and 3D-PEGFP into 293T cells for analyzing successfully transfected cells, and it was found that in PEGFP-transfected cells the ratio of G0/G1 is 24.34 \u00b1 1.89%, in 3C-PEGFP-transfected cells it is 70.79 \u00b1 0.44% (P < 0.001, compared to PEGFP), and in 3D-PEGFPtransfected cells it is 70.79 \u00b1 0.63% (P < 0.001, compared to PEGFP), meanwhile in three groups, for non-transfected cells the ratio of G0/G1 is 55.53 \u00b1 1.07, 57.86 \u00b1 0.24, and 58.60 \u00b1 0.19%, respectively (Figures 8C,D) .

A number of viruses create a favorable environment for own replication through manipulating host cell-cycle (Chen and Makino, 2004; Helt and Harris, 2005; Dove et al., 2006; He et al., 2010; Yu et al., 2015) . Therefore, our results are consistent with the possibility that the G0/G1-phase arrest induced by CVA6 might serve as a strategy for viral proliferation. To evaluate this possibility, cell cycle synchronization in G0/G1, S, and G2/M is executed by serum deprivation, thymidine and nocodazole treatment, respectively. Our results show that G0/G1 synchronization promotes CVA6 replication and viral production but not affecting virus entry, however that synchronization in S and G2/M phase decreases viral replication and inhibits viral production. These results suggest that G0/G1 phase is most favorable for CVA6 production, and that S or G2/M phase is inhibitory for viral production.",

These results are surprising, given that EV71, CA16 and CVA6 each belong to the Picornaviridae family and cause HFMD. Although we do not know the reason for this difference, it could explain why EV71 and CVA6 have different characteristics, such as region of the epidemic (Europe and Asia), symptoms in clinic, and scope of the epidemic. We also demonstrated that human enterovirus 68 (EVD68), which is an alternate emerging pathogen that can cause severe respiratory disease, induces cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase . Therefore, CVA6 and EVD68 share this ability to regulate cell cycle progression at G0/G1. Similar to the results of our study, G2/M synchronization has been shown to inhibit the production of EV71 (Yu et al., 2015) . Therefore, for treatment of either typical or atypical HFMD symptoms, agents inducing G2/M cell cycle arrest should be considered.",

To further understand the mechanism of G0/G1-phase arrest induced by CVA6 infection, host protein expression was examined including cyclinD1, CDK6, CDK4, cyclinE, CDK2, CDK1 and cyclinB1. Each of these proteins was down-regulated after CVA6 infection, though the timepoint of downregulation varied. Furthermore, the CyclinD1 inhibitory proteins P53, P21, and P16 were upregulated by CVA6 infection. These findings support a model in which: (1) CVA6 infection can arrest at G0/G1 phase by down-regulating CDK4, CDK6 and cyclinD1 and upregulating the P53-P21 and P16 pathway; (2) CVA6 infection can inhibit S phase entry by downregulating cyclinE and CDK2 expression; (3) CVA6 infection can promote G2/M exit by down-regulating cyclinB1 and CDK1 expression.",
