The results of molecular biological investigations propose that BEN is a multifactorial disease with genetic predisposition to environmental risk agents. Exome sequencing of 22 000 genes with Illumina Nextera Exome Enrichment Kit was performed on 22 DNA samples (11 Bulgarian patients and 11 Serbian patients). Software analysis was performed via NextGene, Provean, and PolyPhen. The frequency of all annotated genetic variants with deleterious/damaging effect was compared with those of European populations. Then we focused on nonannotated variants (with no data available about them and not found in healthy Bulgarian controls). There is no statistically significant difference between annotated variants in BEN patients and European populations. From nonannotated variants with more than 40% frequency in both patients' groups, we nominated 3 genes with possible deleterious/damaging variants-CELA1, HSPG2, and KCNK5. Mutant genes (CELA1, HSPG2, and KCNK5) in BEN patients encode proteins involved in basement membrane/extracellular matrix and vascular tone, tightly connected to process of angiogenesis. We suggest that an abnormal process of angiogenesis plays a key role in the molecular pathogenesis of BEN.",

The disease affects people living in the alluvial plains along the tributaries of the Danube River in Serbia, Bosnia, Croatia, Bulgaria, and Rumania [1] . Investigations were directed to the epidemiology, etiology, morphology, and treatment of BEN. Results of these studies were reviewed elsewhere [2, 3] . BEN has an onset of between the 40s and 60s, with a long preclinical period. The disease affects both genders with slight female predominance and often leads to terminal kidney failure. About 30-40% of the affected individuals develop uroepithelial tumours of the upper urinary tract [4] . These are mostly papillar carcinomas and are the most common causes of death in BEN patients.",

Other possible agents involved in the etiology of BEN are ochratoxin A and some viruses such as picornavirus, polyomavirus, herpes simplex 1 and 2, adenovirus, hepatitis B, cytomegalovirus, and Epstein-Barr virus [5, 6] .

Epigenetic changes over time display familial clustering [14] and could be implicated in transmitting a \"predisposition\" over generations. Epigenetic modifications being heritable and adaptable at the same time may prove to make a significant contribution to BEN development and may be the link between the effect of environmental factors and genetic composition in BEN progression. In a previous study we have investigated the methylation status across the whole genome in different patient groups, based on gender and endemic region, in comparison to healthy controls from nonendemic regions. Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were determined in BEN patient and controls and the commonly presented DMRs were determined to be the most promising methylation alterations in BEN. SEC61G, IL17RA, and HDAC11 proved to be differently methylated throughout all patient-control pairs [15] .",

Basic histomorphological changes include tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis with sclerosed glomeruli usually of collapsing obsolescence and sclerotic changes in blood vessels. The hypothesis for BEN multifactorial pathogenesis [8] proposes that inherited genetic defects predispose the kidney to damage after exposure to different agents-toxic, immune, or infective. The familial clustering of the disease has prompted genetic investigations [12, 18, 19] . This is the first analysis by NGS sequencing in BEN patients aimed at discovering mutations associated with the disease. Despite intensive molecular studies in BEN, the etiopathogenesis of the disease is still not elucidated and there is no biomarker for disease predisposition. Most of the molecular studies so far have focused on single genes/polymorphisms and very limited information has been provided. Because gene-by-gene analysis by Sanger sequencing is too laborious and expensive, genetic testing has been the exception until recently. Now, next-generation sequencing (NGS) allows for simultaneous and efficient analysis of all known genes for a given trait. Here we applied exome sequencing (comprised of 22 000 genes) in 22 BEN patients in order to detect the most prominent genetic variants with highly probable pathological effect. Recently Poon et al. have applied whole-genome and exome sequencing for analysis of Aristolochic acid-(AA-) associated upper urinary tract urothelial cell carcinoma (UTUC) [20] . AA is a carcinogen that can cause nephrotoxicity as well. Authors observed a high frequency of somatic mutations in chromatin modifiers, particularly KDM6A, in AA-UTUC, demonstrated the sufficiency of AA to induce renal dysplasia in mice, and reproduced the AA mutational signature in experimentally treated human renal tubular cells. Our study was looking for germ-line mutations predisposing to another specific nephropathy-Balkan endemic nephropathy.",

The pattern of laminin staining in glomeruli corresponded to focal and segmental glomerular sclerosis present in the advanced stages of Balkan nephropathy. Later stages were characterized by an intensive expression of laminin in atrophic tubules, much more in proximal than in distal ones.

Tumor angiogenesis, chicken angiogenesis, and mesenteric angiogenesis data suggest that elastin and elastin degradation products play a key role in vascular morphogenesis. CELA1 was expressed in vascular cells in the embryonic lung and in a fetal mesenchymal cell line with angiogenic properties [32] . Degraded elastin causes deposition of hydroxyapatite-like mineral and osteogenic transformation of vascular smooth muscle cells (as they lose the specific -SMA), resulting in vascular calcification [33] . In contrast, collagen-1 levels in areas of calcification are increasing [34] . Changes in both -SMA and elastin inversely correlate with the hemodynamic parameters such as pulse wave velocity (PWV) and lead to media remodeling. This was associated with the increased arterial stiffness observed in CKD rats with vascular calcification. Dysregulation of normal anticalcification factors and elastin degradation represent a pattern of vascular injury existing in patients with end-stage renal diseases [35] .",

In addition, potassium ion (K + ) channel activity is a major regulator of vascular muscle cell membrane potential and is therefore an important determinant of vascular tone. There is growing evidence that the function of several types of vascular K + channels is altered during major cardiovascular diseases, such as chronic hypertension, diabetes, and atherosclerosis [40] . Defects in potassium channels cause abnormal vasodilation responses reflecting a gradual deterioration of vascular mechanisms during the progression of diabetic nephropathy [41] . Enhanced dilator responses and basal activation of K + channels may occur in the renal circulation early during diabetes. An increased K + channel activity may therefore reflect a very high metabolic state of vascular smooth muscle cells [42] .",

This impairment leads to chronic rise in hydrostatic pressure. The increase of the cortical interstitium additionally leads to an increase in the length of diffusion between the tubules and the intertubular and peritubular capillaries. This increase in the length of diffusion subsequently results in the atrophy of the tubules, reduction of reabsorbtion, and therefore impairment of the effective filtration pressure.

Analysis.Analysis of the sequencing data was performed using the Softgenetics NextGene Software (version 2.3.3). The variants found were further analyzed by mutation prediction software Provean and PolyPhen-2 to filter the mutations, which are predicted to be deleterious/damaging. We searched for repeated mutations that are unique or that have significantly higher frequencies in BEN patients as compared to individuals from European populations. We focused on nonannotated variants, predicted as possibly deleterious/damaging by software analysis. We selected mutations based on the following criteria: (i) no data about variants; (ii) no incidence in healthy Bulgarian controls and in European populations; (iii) similar incidence in both Bulgarian and Serbian patients' groups; (iv) mutation frequency of more than 40% in BEN patients.",
