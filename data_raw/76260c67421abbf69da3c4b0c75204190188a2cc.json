In this study, we confirm that a nucleolar phosphoprotein nucleophosmin (NPM1) interacts and co-localizes with the N protein in the nucleolus. In vitro binding studies indicated that aa 148-294 of N and aa 118-188 of NPM1 were required for binding. Interestingly, N protein importation into the nucleolus is independent of the ability of NPM1 to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Furthermore, overexpression of NPM1 promoted PEDV growth, while knockdown of NPM1 suppressed PEDV growth. In addition, binding of N protein to NPM1 protects it from proteolytic degradation by caspase-3, leading to increased cell survival. Taken together, our studies demonstrate a specific interaction of the N protein with the host cell protein NPM1 in the nucleolus. The results suggest potential linkages among viral strategies for the regulation of cell survival activities, possibly through an interaction of N protein with NPM1 which prevents its proteolytic cleavage and enhances cell survival, thus ultimately promoting the replication of PEDV.",

            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is an acute, highly contagious, and devastating viral enteric disease with a high mortality rate in sucking pigs. PED was first reported as a clinical entity in England in 1971 and was shown to be distinct from porcine transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) in 1977 1 . Since then, outbreaks of PED have been reported in many European countries. Currently, PED occurs mainly in Asia, and these outbreaks are more acute and severe than those observed in Europe 2 . In 2010, a large-scale outbreak of PED occurred on swine farms in China and afterwards, in May 2013, this PED virus (PEDV) emerged and spread rapidly in the United States, posing significant economic and public health concerns 3 . The causal agent, PEDV, is a member of the Coronavirinae, which are single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses with the largest genome known. They infect humans, other mammals, and birds, usually causing subclinical or respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases. The PEDV genome is composed of a 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR), at least seven open reading frames (ORF1a, ORF1b, and ORF2 through 6), and a 3\u2032 UTR 4 .

            "text": "how these interactions may lead to porcine disease. The coronavirus N protein is abundantly produced within infected cells. N protein has multiple functions, including as a structural protein that forms complexes with genomic RNA, and plays an important role in enhancing the efficiency of virus transcription and assembly. The identification of host proteins targeted by viral proteins during the infection process provides important insights into the mechanisms of viral protein function. To date, interactions of N protein with numerous host cell proteins have been identified, including hCypA 6 , proteasome subunit p42 7 , Smad3 8 , hnRNP-A1 9 , the chemokine CXCL16 10 , translation elongation factor-1 alpha 11 , cellular pyruvate kinase protein 12 and 14-3-3 13 . Comparative studies among various coronavirus N proteins could aid the development of novel antiviral therapeutics that target interactions between host cell proteins and the N protein 14 . Manipulation of multiple host cell factors by a relatively small number of viral proteins is critical for virus replication and spread. Given the limited coding capacity of the PEDV genome, its protein products must be multifunctional in order to counter host cell antiviral defenses. Although originally thought to serve purely structural roles, N proteins of coronavirus are emerging as important players at the virus-host interface. Our research group has shown that the PEDV N protein localizes not only in the cytoplasm, but also in the nucleolus in infected cells and cells expressing the N protein alone 15 ; however, the factors that determine the nucleolar localization of PEDV N protein and the effect of this localization on virus replication are not clearly understood.",

In this study, to determine the intracellular distribution of N protein at the protein level, PEDV-infected Vero E6 cells were lysed, separated into nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions, and analyzed by western blotting. As shown in Fig. 1A and B, PCNA protein was detected only in the nuclear fraction, whereas GAPDH was mostly present in the cytoplasmic fraction, confirming the successful separation of the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions. The N protein was detected in the virus-infected nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions (Fig. 1C , lanes 3, 4 and 5). In addition, multiple bands appeared on the western blots, because the N proteins of coronaviruses are phosphorylated in virus-infected cells (Fig. 1D ). These results indicate that N is a protein that shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, which is consistent with the role of N protein in viral replication. N protein interacts and co-localizes with NPM1. The nucleolus is structurally divided into three major subcompartments: the fibrillar center, a dense fibrillar component, and a granular component 36 . Three distinct proteins that are mainly located in the nucleolus have been identified 37, 38 : the major nucleolar protein fibrillarin, which is a component of a nucleolar small nuclear ribonucleoprotein that is involved in rRNA processing; NPM1, which is a putative ribosome assembly factor; and nucleolin, which is involved in the processing of precursor rRNA. To characterize the level of expression of N, NPM1, fibrillarin and nucleolin, encoding plasmids were constructed with Myc or 3\u00d7 Flag at the N-terminus of each protein. Individual expression plasmids were transiently transfected into HEK293T cells, and their expression was assessed using western blotting (Fig. S1 ). As measured by western blotting using a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against N (see Supplementary Fig. S1A ), Myc (see Supplementary Fig. S1B ) or Flag (see Supplementary Fig. S1C ) tag, individual expression constructs encoding N, NPM1 and fibrillarin proteins were expressed at different levels at the appropriate size, however, the construct encoding nucleolin failed to be expressed. To investigate the possible molecular target of N in the nucleolar, co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) experiments were performed. The result indicated that N protein showed an interaction with NPM1 in the Co-IP assay ( Fig. 2A,B ). To investigate whether N protein is able to interact with endogenous NPM1 in the context of PEDV infection, virus-infected Vero E6 cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-NPM1 mAb and probed for the presence of N protein with anti-N mAb. N protein was readily detected in PEDV-infected Vero E6 cells (Fig. 2C) , indicating that N protein indeed interacts with endogenous NPM1 protein in PEDV-infected Vero E6 cells. However, the interaction of N protein with fibrillarin or nucleolin was not observed in the Co-IP assay (see supplementary Fig. S2A and B) .",

Various functional domains have been identified within NPM1, including an N-terminal oligomerization domain (OligoD) bearing chaperone activity, the C-terminal nucleic acid binding domain (NBD), and two central acid domains for histone binding (HistonD). To characterize further the interaction of NPM1 and N protein, we mapped the domains of NPM1 necessary for its association with N protein, based on the well-known functional domain of NPM1, and using a series of GST-tagged NPM1 deletion mutants (1-294, 1-117, 118-188, 189-294, 1-188, and 118-294) fused to GST (Fig. 3E) .

            "text": "It has been shown previously that CDK2/cyclin E-mediated phosphorylation of NPM1 on Thr-199 promotes dissociation of NPM1 from centrosomes, allowing the initiation of centrosome duplication 39 . Thus, when the T199A unphosphorylatable mutant is ectopically expressed, T199A binds continuously to centrosomes, resulting in suppression of centrosome duplication 40 . A recent study 41 showed that NPM1 can be sumoylated on both Lys-230 and Lys-263 residues, although Lys 263 is the major sumoylation site. Mutation of K263 alters its subcellular distribution, and K263R mutation makes NPM1 susceptible to caspase-3 cleavage and decreases cell proliferation. Intriguingly, Thr-199, Lys-230 and Lys-263 are all located in the C-terminal domain of the NPM1 protein, which is essential for the interaction of NPM1 with N protein. To explore whether Thr-199, Lys-230 and Lys-263 have a role in the association between NPM1 and N protein, we co-transfected various 3\u00d7 Flag-NPM1 constructs into HEK293T cells with Myc-N. Co-IP assays demonstrated that the unphosphorylated T199A, unsumoylated K230R and K263R were able to bind Myc-N, and had either moderate effects or no effect on N protein binding (Fig. 4 ).",

            "text": "regions of the nucleolus 42 , is associated with preribosomal particles 43 , and forms pentamers that may be important for the assembly of ribosomes 44 . NPM1 has the ability to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm 45 ; it binds to nuclear/nucleolar localization signal containing peptides 45 , and thus serves as a shuttle protein in nuclear/nucleolar import. Interestingly, in this study we also found that the NPM1 interacts with N protein, suggesting that NPM1 may serve as a shuttle protein for transport of N protein into the nucleolus, although the interaction domain of NPM1-N (aa 148-294) is not within the fragment of N protein that contains the nucleolus localization signal (aa 70-90). It is hypothesized that transport of N protein into the nucleolus depends on the movement of NPM1 between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. To examine this hypothesis, we co-transfected HEK293T cells with pAcGFP-N and pDsRed-NPM1, and time-lapse images were acquired at 12-72 hpt at 5 min intervals. The transport into the nucleolus, interaction with NPM1 and export of N protein in transfected cells were clearly observed at 42-43 hpt. As shown in Fig. 5A , NPM1 protein appeared first in the nucleolus (t = 10 min) and then a small amount of N was observed in the nucleolus at 42 hpt (t = 30 min). N protein accumulated continuously in the nucleolus of transfected cells and interacted with NPM1 until t = 30-55 min, and was exported from the nucleolus at t = 55-60 min. Real-time visualization of the kinetics of nucleolar import, interaction with NPM1 and export of N protein indicated that the process was rapid, taking only 30 min in total, thereby ruling out the possibility that the nucleolar localization of N protein is NPM1 independent. The time-lapse video showing the kinetics of nucleolar translocation of N protein and its interaction with NPM1 is provided as supplementary material (Video S3 in the Supplementary materials). To corroborate our findings, we first tested whether depletion of NPM1 by specific siRNAs resulted in reduced nuclear import of N. For this purpose, three pairs of NPM1 siRNAs were synthesized. These siRNAs were transfected into Vero E6 cells, and it was found that NPM1 siRNA (2+ 3) reduced the level of expression of NPM1 (Fig. 5B ). In addition, we examined the viability of cells receiving siRNA using the CCK-8 assay. The results showed that there was no difference between NPM1 RNAi and RNAi control in terms of the viability of transfected cells (see Supplementary Fig. S4 ). As shown in Fig. 5C , transport of N protein was hardly affected in cells with reduced NPM1 levels in comparison with that in the cells treated with a scramble siRNA (siScr), mock-treated cells. As a control, we also co-transfected Vero E6 cells with Myc-N and 3\u00d7 Flag-NPM1, but did not observe a stimulation of nuclear import of Myc-N with the increased expression of the NPM1 protein (Fig. 5D ).",

To this end, siRNA-mediated knockdown of NPM1 in Vero E6 cells infected with PEDV was investigated. As shown in Fig. 7A and B, knockdown of NPM1 resulted in downregulation of N protein expression at 48 or 60 hpi, accompanied by a significant reduction of viral load in the cell culture supernatants in comparison with that in the cells treated with a scramble siRNA (siScr), mock-treated cells, or normal Vero E6 cells (no treatment) (Fig. 7C ). This indicated that growth of PEDV was arrested in cells with a reduced level of NPM1. Together with the results of the overexpression experiments, these data highlight the synergistic action of cellular NPM1 expression on PEDV replication and N protein expression.",

            "text": "Programmed cell death, or apoptosis, is an essential event in animal development and is observed in many developing tissues in both invertebrates and vertebrates. The activation of the caspase family is a central event in apoptosis. Downstream caspases include caspase-3, the precursor form of which is predominantly synthesized in the cytosol 46 . Activated caspase-3 can be translocated from the cytoplasm into the nucleus 47 . Caspase-3 is activated by upstream caspases and then cleaves many intracellular target proteins to induce apoptotic cell death; for example, NPM1 is a substrate of caspase-3 48 . To explore whether N protein binding has any role in mediating the apoptotic cleavage of NPM1, we transiently transfected Myc-N and empty vector into Vero E6 cells and then treated with or without 100 m M of Ac-DEVD-CHO (caspase-3 inhibitor). The cells induced apoptotic cleavage of NPM1 by treatment with an apoptosis inducer, staurosporine (STS), or not. Apoptotic stimulus clearly demonstrated that NPM1 protein cleavage and occurred in empty vector cells following STS treatment. In contrast, NPM1 was almost intact when N was overexpressed in Vero E6 cells with or no STS treatment, highlighting that nucleolus-targeted N prevents apoptotic degradation of NPM1 (Fig. 8A) . Meanwhile, cleaved caspase-3 was found in STS treated cells (Fig. 8A) . Furthermore, Ac-DEVD-CHO, a caspase-3 inhibitor, was able to restore the STS-induced NPM1 and caspase-3 protein cleavage (Fig. 8B ). This suggests that interaction with N protein protects NPM1 from apoptotic degradation. A number of studies have indicated that NPM1, one of the major nucleolar phosphoproteins, is involved in the regulation of nucleolar function during cellular differentiation 49 and in antiapoptosis 48 . To evaluate whether the N-NPM1 complex is important in prevention of apoptosis, we studied Vero E6 cells transiently expressing Myc or Myc-N and induced apoptosis by STS. Compared with cells with no STS treatment, a DNA fragmentation assay revealed that overexpression of PEDV N protein slightly diminished DNA degradation. By contrast, robust DNA fragmentation was detected in cells transiently expressing Myc tag (Fig. 8C ). To evaluate further the antiapoptotic effect of N protein in vivo, we examined the sensitivity of Vero E6 cells transfected with Myc-N or empty vector and with induction of apoptosis by treatment with STS or not. DAPI and TUNEL staining of the nucleus revealed that Myc-N transfected cells displayed greater viability after stimulation by STS and were markedly less sensitive to STS-induced apoptosis than empty vector transfected cells (Fig. 8D) . Collectively, these data demonstrate that the N-NPM1 interaction plays an essential role in protecting cells from apoptotic degradation, thus promoting cell survival.",

The N-terminal nonpolar region and the acidic region of the middle portion of NPM1 are important for its chaperone activity, and the C-terminal is essential for nucleic acid binding 56 . Interestingly, analysis of the binding sites of targeting proteins on NPM1 has revealed that most of them reside in the C-terminal portion of the molecule. For example, NPM1 binds to the nucleolar proteins P120 57 , nucleolin 58 , and Tat 53 through a fragment of NPM1 containing amino acids 187-215 or 194-239.

The binding region of NPM1 for viral proteins HDAg 59 and Rex 52 has been localized to these acidic regions.

Accordingly, many viruses have evolved strategies to prevent or delay apoptosis in order to provide a window of opportunity in which virus replication, assembly and egress can take place. Interfering with apoptosis may also be important for establishment and/or maintenance of persistent infections. With few exceptions, most studies of virus-encoded antiapoptotic proteins have focused on DNA viruses. The known exceptions are the picornavirus-encoded proteins leader and 2BC 62, 63 , as well as the rubella virus capsid protein 64 . Although infection with these viruses induces apoptosis in many cell lines, this is generally observed late in the infection process. In this report, we have demonstrated that the major isoform of the PEDV N protein in infected cells functions to block apoptosis. The protective capacity of N protein is dependent on interaction with NPM1; it protects it from proteolytic cleavage, enhancing cell survival, and positively regulates PEDV replication and growth.",
