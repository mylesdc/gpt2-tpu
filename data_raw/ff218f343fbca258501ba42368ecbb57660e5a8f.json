We here report on an aglycon analogue of the antibiotic teicoplanin (code name LCTA-949) that inhibits DENV-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) in a dose-dependent manner. Virus infection was completely inhibited at concentrations that had no adverse effect on the host cells. These findings were corroborated by quantification of viral RNA levels in culture supernatant. Antiviral activity was also observed against other flaviviruses such as the yellow fever virus and the tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV). In particular, potent antiviral activity was observed against TBEV. Time-of-drugaddition experiments indicated that LCTA-949 inhibits an early stage in the DENV replication cycle; however, a virucidal effect was excluded. This observation was corroborated by the fact that LCTA-949 lacks activity on DENV subgenomic replicon (that does not encode structural proteins) replication. Using a microsopy-based binding and fusion assay employing DiD-labeled viruses, it was shown that LCTA-949 targets the early stage (binding/entry) of the infection. Moreover, LCTA-949 efficiently inhibits infectivity of DENV particles pre-opsonized with antibodies, thus potentially also inhibiting antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). In conclusion, LCTA-949 exerts in vitro activity against several flaviviruses and does so (as shown for DENV) by interfering with an early step in the viral replication cycle.",

            "text": "The genus flavivirus (family Flaviviridae) comprises several pathogens, including dengue virus (DENV), yellow fever virus (YFV), West Nile virus (WNV), tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). Flaviviruses that are pathogenic to man are transmitted to humans by bites of mosquitoes or ticks [1] . The incidence and geographical distribution of the four distinct DENV serotypes and its vector are increasing dramatically. DENV causes more than 50 million infections annually (mainly in South-East Asia and Latin America) and infections with this virus may develop into dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) or dengue shock syndrome (DSS) [2] [3] [4] . Increased disease severity has been associated with pre-existing heterologous DENV antibodies, a phenomenon described as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection. Antibodies have been found to enhance viral entry into Fc-c-receptor-bearing cells and to alter the antiviral immune response, leading to increased virus particle production and subsequent immune activation. During homologous re-infection, antibodies are believed to neutralize the infecting virus and provide life-long protection against disease development. Intriguingly, however, during heterologous re-infection, cross-reactive antibodies have been implicated to enhance viral replication leading to a higher infected cell mass and increased viral burden. There is neither a vaccine nor a specific antiviral therapy available [3] . This is also the case for YFV that, together with DENV, is a leading cause of hemorrhagic fever worldwide, although a highly efficacious vaccine is available [5] . Furthermore, vector-control strategies that were once successful in eliminating YFV have faltered, thereby leading to a re-emergence of the disease [5] . The World Health Organization currently estimates that there are 200,000 cases of yellow fever annually of which over 90% occur in Africa, resulting in about 30,000 deaths per year [6] . There is, as is the case for most of the other flaviviruses, no antiviral drug available for the treatment of YFV infections.",

The ability of DiD-labeled virions to bind to cell surface receptors at increasing concentrations of LCTA-949 was assessed in highly permissive BS-C-1 cells. In untreated cells, on average 65615 DiD-labeled virus particles were detected. Addition of LCTA-949 markedly reduced the number of bound virus particles to cells in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 5A ). At a concentration of 25 mM, LCTA-949 inhibited virus-cell binding by 80%. These results demonstrate that LCTA-949 acts by preventing virus-cell binding. Next, we investigated whether LCTA-949 has an additive effect on the membrane fusion capacity of the virus. To this end, BS-C-1 cells were infected with DiD-labeled DENV-2 particles in the presence of different concentrations of LCTA-949. The relative extent of virus fusion was estimated by measuring the total fluorescent signal per imaging field. Membrane fusion activity of DENV was efficiently reduced in cells treated with the reference controls ammonium chloride and chlorpromazine ( Figure 5B ) [11] . LCTA-949 markedly impaired membrane fusion activity of DENV ( Figure 5A-B) . This effect can likely be ascribed to the low binding efficiency of virions to cells in presence of LCTA-949, as no statistically significant added effect was measured for inhibition of membrane fusion activity as compared to the effect on binding ( Figure 5A ).

Some lectins, in particular those with sugar-binding specificity, were reported to prevent the interaction between the E glycoprotein and the cellular receptor DC-SIGN [18] . In addition to interfering with binding, targeting the E protein may also affect the fusion of the virus particle with cellular membranes. Virtual screening has been employed to identify molecules that interact with the b-OG pocket in the E protein [19] [20] [21] . Although this method seems promising, this screening still needs refinement.

LCTA-949 inhibits not only the replication of DENV, but also that of other flaviviruses albeit with different efficiencies, including YFV, WNV, JEV and in particular TBEV. Time-of-drug-addition studies revealed that the compound exerts its antiviral activity at the time of infection and inhibits binding of the virus to the host cell. This was further supported by the observation that LCTA-949 (in contrast to the replication inhibitor ribavirin) has no effect on DENV subgenomic replicon replication and hence does not inhibit the intracellular replication machinery of the virus. Besides, a microscopy-based binding and fusion assay using DiD-labeled particles revealed that LCTA-949 inhibits DENV infection by preventing binding of the virus to the host cell. This observation may point to an interaction of LCTA-949 with the E protein; however, further studies are needed to elucidate the specific antiviral target(s) of this inhibition. A direct virucidal effect of LCTA-949 was excluded as well.",

The mechanism of action against HIV and coronaviruses has been ascribed to a likely effect on entry [8] . In contrast, the rather pronounced in vitro activity against HCV is caused by an inhibitory effect on intracellular viral replication. It is remarkable, given the fact that flaviviruses and HCV belong to the same family (Flaviviridae), that one and the same molecule inhibits the replication of such closely related viruses by affecting two entirely different stages in the replication cycle. An interesting example of another antiviral agent that inhibits the replication of two different viruses via a different mechanism of action (but by targeting the same cellular factor) are the cyclophilin binding molecules. Cyclosporin A and related analogues (such as the non-immunosuppressive molecules Debio-025 and MIM811) inhibit the activity of cyclophilins, which are essential co-factors in the replication of both HIV and HCV. The inhibitory effect on HIV replication is caused by an interaction with the matrix protein and thus the encapsidation process [22] , whereas the effect on HCV is mediated via the cis/trans isomerisation of HCV NS5A that is required for viral RNA replication [23] .",

However, so far we have not been able to select for drug-resistant variants even not following 20 passages in the presence of suboptimal concentrations of the molecule, indicating a high barrier to resistance. We currently continue our efforts to select for drug-resistant variants. It can as yet not be excluded that LCTA-949 inhibits the entry process via interaction with a cellular target. This would mean that each of the flaviviruses that are susceptible to LCTA-949 use the same cellular factor for entry (that is targeted by LCTA-949). An interaction with the host cell membrane that disturbs the flavivirus entry process can also not been excluded. However, if this should be the mechanism, it may be difficult to explain that the entry process of the closely related HCV is not affected by this molecule. Altogether, the precise mechanism by which LCTA-949 inhibits the binding/ entry process remains to be elucidated. We found that LCTA-949 also interferes with antibodymediated cell entry of DENV particles. ADE is thought to play a pivotal role in the exacerbation of DENV-induced disease during a secondary infection (DHF or DSS). Hence, drugs with properties like those of LCTA-949 could be of particular interest for intervention strategies. LCTA-949 was added to preformed virusantibody complexes and was also shown to result under these conditions in an antiviral effect. These results suggest that LCTA-949 does not interfere with DENV infection through direct binding to the virus receptor since antibody-mediated cell entry of DENV is facilitated by Fc-receptors and not by the virus receptor. Indeed, these results strengthen the hypothesis that LCTA-949 binds not by the host cell receptor of the virus. However, the inhibitory effect is exerted very early since the molecule was washed away in the ADE experiments 1 hr after infection. The particular mechanism by which LCTA-949 inhibits ADE remains to be elucidated.",

Following a 2 hour incubation period, the cell monolayer was washed 3 times with assay medium to remove nonadsorbed virus and cultures were further incubated for 4 days in the presence of the inhibitor. Supernatant was harvested and viral RNA load was determined by real-time quantitative RT-PCR. The 50% effective concentration (EC 50 ), which is defined as the compound concentration that is required to inhibit viral RNA replication by 50%, was determined using logarithmic interpolation. Ribavirin was included as a reference compound. Antiviral assays for JEV, TBEV and WNV were carried out in Vero-B cells in 24-well plates (5610 4 cells/well). Briefly, cells were cultured in MEM supplemented with 7% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, and penicillin-streptomycin. One day after seeding, cells were infected with 100 ml of the viral inoculum (at a multiplicity of infection of either 0.1 or 1) in the presence or absence of LCTA-949.

Prior to the binding assay, cells were incubated for 10 min at 4uC. Subsequently, DiD-labeled DENV was added in the presence or absence of LCTA-949 or a DMSO control, and incubation was continued for 1 h at 4uC. Unbound virus was removed by gently washing the cells three times with cold phenol red-free MEM. Subsequently, cold phenol red-free MEM containing 1% glucose and a glucose oxidase solution (GLOX) was added to the cells and the microscopic analysis was done as described below. GLOX is composed of a 250 mM of glucose oxidase (Type VII from Aspergillus niger, Sigma Aldrich No. G2133) solution, prepared in 200 mL of 16 PBS, and 50 mL of catalase (from beef liver, Roche No. 10106810001). For the fusion assay, the same experimental setup was used except that the cells were kept at 37uC during the experiment. Ammonium chloride (NH 4 Cl, 50 mM) and chlorpromazine (60 mM) were used as negative controls in the fusion assay. The microscopy analysis was done by taking 10 snapshots of randomly selected fields using both differential interference contrast (DIC) and DiD channels. DIC images were taken from each field to make sure that the visualized DiD-particles are bound to a cell and not lying in an empty space with no attached cells. DiD-labeled viruses were detected by epifluorescence microscopy in a Leica Biosystems 6000B instrument by using a 635-nm helium-neon laser. The fluorescent emission was collected by an oil-immersion 1006 objective with a numerical aperture of 1.46 (Leica Microsystems) and imaged using an EM CCD camera (Hamamatsu 9100-02). A thermostatted stage and objective heater were used to keep the temperature at 37uC in the fusion assay. The acquired images were processed and analyzed with ImageJ using an in-house macro. In the binding assay, the total number of bound DiDparticles was counted. The extent of membrane fusion was analyzed by measuring the total fluorescent signal per imaging field at 20 minutes post infection. The quantitative results of the negative controls in the fusion assay were taken as background; hence, they were subtracted from the total fluorescence result of the positive control and LCTA-949 treatments.",

Under the experimental conditions, ,0.2% of the cells were infected with DENV in the absence of mAbs, whereas in presence of enhancing concentrations of anti-E mAb DV2-104 62.8% of the cells were infected with DENV. The infectivity of anti-E DV2-104 mAb opsonized DENV particles was markedly reduced in the presence of LCTA-949 (Figure 6) [EC 50 : 4.060.4 mM and EC 90 : 1261.2 mM]. To confirm that the effect observed is not antibody-specific, the effect of two other anti-E mAbs, DV2-48 or DV2-96 mapped to E domain I/II and to E domain III [12], respectively, were evaluated. In agreement with the results obtained with anti-E mAb DV2-104, the infectivity of DENV-immune complexes formed with anti-E DV2-48 and DV2-96 was significantly reduced in the presence of LCTA-949 [EC 90 s: 1160.3 mM and 1665 mM, respectively (data not shown)].",
