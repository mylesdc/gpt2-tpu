Some viruses subvert LN B cell activation; however, our knowledge of viral hindrance of B cell responses of important human pathogens is lacking. Here, we define mechanisms whereby chikungunya virus (CHIKV), a mosquito-transmitted RNA virus that causes outbreaks of acute and chronic arthritis in humans, hinders dLN antiviral B cell responses. Infection of WT mice with pathogenic, but not acutely cleared CHIKV, induced MyD88dependent recruitment of monocytes and neutrophils to the dLN. Blocking this influx improved lymphocyte accumulation, dLN organization, and CHIKV-specific B cell responses. Both inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and the phagocyte NADPH oxidase (Nox2) contributed to impaired dLN organization and function. Infiltrating monocytes expressed iNOS through a local IRF5-and IFNAR1-dependent pathway that was partially TLR7-dependent. Together, our data suggest that pathogenic CHIKV triggers the influx and activation of monocytes and neutrophils in the dLN that impairs virus-specific B cell responses.",

B cells and virus-specific antibodies (Abs) are important arms of the adaptive immune response for limiting viral dissemination and controlling viral infections. The antiviral Ab response is initiated in the draining lymph node (dLN) through a series of molecular interactions and cellular movements that require intact lymphoid tissue architecture and function. Na\u00efve B cells enter the dLN through high endothelial venules (HEVs) and then migrate to defined follicles subjacent to the dLN subcapsular sinus (SCS) [1] . B cells acquire viral antigen through interactions with SCS macrophages which readily acquire viral antigens borne by the afferent lymphatics [2] . After activation, B cells migrate to the borders of the B cell follicle and to the interfollicular region of the dLN to encounter CD4 + T cells. Some of these activated, proliferating B cells go on to form plasmablasts, while others persist in tight clusters in the follicle, forming germinal centers (GCs) [3, 4] .",

CHIKV, in particular, re-emerged in 2004 to cause massive outbreaks of disease affecting millions [8] . Acute CHIKV disease presents with rapid onset of fever and rash, with severe joint swelling and arthralgia. A high proportion of individuals develop chronic arthralgia or arthritis that lasts for months to years after initial infection [9] . Following CHIKV infection, the humoral response reduces acute disease severity and controls viremia [10] , and passive transfer of immune serum or monoclonal antibodies protects from fatal CHIKV disease [11] [12] [13] . However, B cells and Ab are unable to mediate complete clearance of CHIKV from all sites of infection [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . Thus, chronic CHIKV disease in musculoskeletal tissue may be driven by failure of the adaptive immune response to prevent or control viral persistence.",

In comparison, pathogenic CHIKV strains persist in joint-associated tissue of immunocompetent mice [14, 15] , suggesting that the development of virusspecific B cell responses may be impaired during CHIKV infection. Indeed, we previously found that pathogenic CHIKV strains disable immune responses in the dLN of infected mice by impairing na\u00efve lymphocyte entry and expansion of HEVs [23] . Additionally, the dLN exhibited follicular disorganization, with a loss of the B-T cell border and poor GC formation following pathogenic CHIKV infection. However, the mechanisms leading to architectural disruption and impaired lymphocyte accumulation remained to be defined.",

We also identify a role for local IRF5-driven type I IFN signaling in the dLN that is triggered by TLR7 and one or more additional TLR(s) and promotes iNOS expression in infiltrating monocytes. Overall, our data suggest that the rapid, early influx of monocytes and neutrophils detrimentally impacts the B cell response to pathogenic CHIKV infection through a novel IRF5-dependent mechanism.",

In contrast, the dLN of mice infected with pathogenic, persistent CHIKV strains became highly disorganized as early as 3 days post-infection (dpi), and failed to accumulate lymphocytes or develop GCs due in part to disruption of HEV-mediated lymphocyte recruitment [23] . Consistent with the robust response of the dLN to attenuated 181/25 infection, the presence of LNs is essential for clearance of 181/25 infection from joint-associated tissue (S1 Fig). To elucidate the mechanisms that lead to the rapid disorganization and function of the dLN following pathogenic CHIKV infection, we characterized cell populations at early times post-infection with pathogenic (parental strain AF15561) or attenuated (derivative strain 181/ 25) CHIKV, which differ by only five amino acids across the genome [25] . Pathogenic, but not attenuated CHIKV infection, resulted in increased numbers of monocytes (CD11b + Ly6C hi-Ly6G -) and neutrophils (CD11b hi Ly6C + Ly6G + ) in the blood and dLN within 24 h of infection (S2A- S2C Fig and Fig 1A-1C) . The influx of monocytes and neutrophils into the dLN preceded their arrival in the foot, the site of virus inoculation (S2D- S2F Fig) , which occurs between 3 and 5 dpi [26] . In contrast, few monocytes and neutrophils were present in the dLNs of mock-infected mice or mice inoculated with the attenuated CHIKV strain (Fig 1D) . Consistent with our flow cytometric analysis, immunofluorescence staining of dLN sections at 1 dpi detected a large population of Gr-1 + monocytes and neutrophils in the dLNs of mice infected with pathogenic CHIKV. These cells were mostly localized within the SCS and medullary sinuses, with a smaller population of monocytes and neutrophils within the B cell follicles (Fig 1D) . Thus, during pathogenic, but not attenuated, CHIKV infection, a rapid influx of monocytes and neutrophils into the dLN precedes its extensive disorganization.",

Because monocyte and neutrophil infiltration of the dLN preceded the disruption of lymphocyte populations (Fig 1 and [23] ), we hypothesized that accumulation of myeloid cells in the dLN might disrupt its architecture. To prevent the early influx of monocytes and neutrophils into the dLN, we treated mice with a single dose of anti-Gr-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) the day before inoculation with pathogenic CHIKV, which effectively depleted monocytes and neutrophils from the circulation (Fig  2A-2C ) and the dLN (Fig 2D-2F) . Remarkably, a single anti-Gr-1 mAb treatment prior to pathogenic CHIKV infection restored total cell numbers at 5 dpi in the dLN to levels nearly equivalent to those detected during acutely cleared CHIKV infection (Fig 2G) , an effect that was due principally to changes in B and CD4 + T cell numbers (Fig 2H and 2I) . CD8 + T cell numbers in anti-Gr-1-treated mice remained lower than in mice infected with the attenuated CHIKV strain (Fig 2J) . The failure to fully restore CD8 + T cell numbers may reflect some effect of the anti-Gr-1 mAb on CD8 + T cells, some of which express Gr-1 upon activation [27] . Depletion of monocytes and neutrophils prior to attenuated CHIKV infection did not affect total cell numbers in the dLN at 5 dpi (S3 Fig) .",

We hypothesized that the enhanced lymphocyte accumulation and organization in the dLN of mice depleted of monocytes and neutrophils prior to pathogenic infection would improve GC formation. To investigate this idea, mice were treated with a single dose of anti-Gr-1 or isotype control mAb one day prior to pathogenic CHIKV infection, and GC responses in the dLN were evaluated at 14 dpi by staining sections with the GC B cell marker GL7. Anti-Gr-1 mAbtreated mice had increased numbers of GCs per dLN, and the GCs were larger than those of the isotype control group (Fig 4A-4C) , resulting in an increased total GC area in the dLN ( Fig  4D) . Flow cytometry analysis also showed an increased percentage and number of CD95 + GL7 + GC B cells in the dLN of mice infected with pathogenic CHIKV and treated with anti-Gr-1 mAb (Fig 4E-4G) . Early depletion of monocytes and neutrophils also resulted in greater numbers of CD138 + IgD lo plasma cells (PCs) (Fig 4H-4J ) and increased the number of CHIKV-specific Ab-secreting cells (ASCs) in the dLN (Fig 4K) . The effects of anti-Gr-1 mAb treatment were most pronounced in the dLN, as we observed modest effects on the percentages of GC B cells and plasma cells in the left inguinal LN and the spleen (S4 Fig). Anti-Gr-1 mAb treatment had no effect on the amount of total CHIKV-specific IgG present in serum at day 7, 14, and 28 dpi (Fig 4L) . However, consistent with the effects of anti-Gr-1 mAb treatment on GC formation, we observed an increase in CHIKV neutralization activity in the serum of anti-Gr-1-treated mice compared with the isotype control group at 28 dpi (Fig 4M) . Together, these data demonstrate that early depletion of monocytes and neutrophils during pathogenic CHIKV infection improves the endogenous, polyclonal virus-specific GC B cell responses in the dLN and, despite predominantly impacting the dLN, leads to a modest but detectable improvement in serum Ab neutralization activity.",

The percentage of neutrophils was increased in the dLN of Ifnar1 -/mice compared with WT mice after pathogenic CHIKV infection (Fig 5B and 5C) , which resulted in a similar total number of neutrophils in the dLN of WT and Ifnar1 -/mice (Fig 5D) despite the overall decrease in total number of dLN cells.

Genetic deletion of MyD88 had minimal impact on the total number of cells in the dLN at 24 hpi (Fig 5G) . However, MyD88-dependent signals were required for and contributed to neutrophil (Fig 5H-5J ) and monocyte (Fig 5H, 5K and 5L) recruitment, respectively, to the dLN following pathogenic CHIKV infection. Mice treated with anti-IL-1R blocking mAb at the time of infection showed no change in total cells in the dLN compared with control IgGtreated mice (Fig 5M) , but had reduced neutrophils (percentage and total number; Fig 5N-5P) , indicating that the MyD88-IL-1R signaling axis regulates the rapid accumulation of neutrophils in the dLN during pathogenic CHIKV infection. In contrast, the percentage and total number of monocytes were unchanged in the anti-IL-1R-treated group compared with the IgG-treated group (Fig 5N, 5Q and 5R ). Together, these data demonstrate that in response to pathogenic CHIKV infection 1) type I IFN signaling inhibits and IL-1R signaling promotes, neutrophil recruitment to the dLN, and 2) IL-1R-independent, MyD88-dependent signal(s) promote the recruitment of monocytes to the dLN.",

Moreover, superoxide derived from the activity of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase (NOX2, encoded by gp91phox, also known as Cybb) can combine with NO to form the reactive nitrogen species peroxynitrite (ONOO -), which also can suppress immune responses [34, 35] . Based on this knowledge, we hypothesized that monocytes and neutrophils infiltrating the dLN disrupt lymphocyte accumulation and tissue organization through the actions of iNOS and NOX2. Consistent with the lack of effect of monocyte and neutrophil depletion on accumulation of lymphocytes in the dLN following attenuated CHIKV infection (S3 Fig) , total cell numbers in the dLN were unchanged in Nos2 -/and Nox2 -/mice infected PFU of CHIKV AF15561 in the left footpad.

However, total cell numbers in the dLN were partially restored in Nos2 -/and Nox2 -/mice inoculated with pathogenic CHIKV compared with WT mice (Fig 6A) , suggesting that NO and superoxide contribute to reduced lymphocyte numbers in the dLN during pathogenic CHIKV infection. In addition to partial restoration of lymphocyte numbers, the dLNs of Nos2 -/and Nox2 -/mice infected with pathogenic CHIKV showed improved follicular and paracortical organization, and a more clearly defined B-T cell border compared with the dLN of WT mice (Fig 6B) . These data suggest that both Nos2 and Nox2 contribute to the disruption of lymphocyte organization that occurs during pathogenic CHIKV infection. The partial restoration of cell numbers and markedly improved lymphocyte organization in the dLN were not due to a difference in early monocyte and neutrophil infiltration or localization at 24 hpi between WT, Nos2 -/-, and Nox2 -/mice (Fig 6C-6F) . To define the iNOSexpressing cell type(s) that mediate the Nos2-dependent effects on dLN cell numbers and organization, we analyzed cell populations in the dLN at 24 hpi by flow cytometry. Monocytes elicited by pathogenic CHIKV infection expressed iNOS in the dLN, but not in the blood (Fig 6G  and 6H) . iNOS staining was absent in neutrophils in the dLN (Fig 6G) , and was absent in Nos2 -/mice, as expected (Fig 6G) . Together, these data indicate that expression of Nos2 and Nox2 contribute to impaired lymphocyte accumulation and dLN disorganization, and that monocytes upregulate iNOS expression following entry into the dLN.",

Indeed, type I IFN receptor signaling was required for expression of iNOS in dLN monocytes following CHIKV infection (Fig 7A and 7B) . Type I IFN signaling and either IRF3 or IRF7 are required for protection from fatal CHIKV infection, with IRF7 responsible for systemic type I IFN production [37, 38] . Unexpectedly, both IRF3 and IRF7 were dispensable for iNOS induction in dLN monocytes (Fig 7A and 7B) . Instead, Irf3 -/-Irf5 -/-Irf7 -/triple knockout mice showed diminished monocyte iNOS expression similar to that of Ifnar1 -/mice, suggesting a requirement for IRF5. The dependency on IRF5 for monocyte iNOS expression was confirmed in Irf5 -/mice (Fig 7C and 7D) . Together, these data suggest that IRF5-and IFNAR1-dependent signals act locally in the dLN to induce iNOS expression in infiltrating monocytes during pathogenic CHIKV infection.",

To investigate this idea, we infected WT, Irf3 -/-Irf7 -/-, and Irf3 -/-Irf5 -/-Irf7 -/mice with pathogenic CHIKV. At 24 hpi, we measured the induction of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) including Ccl2, Cxcl10, Ifng, Il6, Ifit1, and Rsad2 mRNA [44, 45] in the inoculated foot and in the dLN by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Each of these ISGs was upregulated in both the foot and dLN of CHIKV-infected WT mice at this timepoint (Fig 8A-8F) . However, upregulation was differentially dependent on IRF3/IRF7 or IRF5 in each tissue. In the inoculated foot, upregulation of all ISGs analyzed was dependent on IRF3/IRF7 (Fig 8A-8F) . However, in the dLN, the induction of Ccl2, Cxc10, Ifng, and Il6 mRNA was similar between WT and Irf3 -/-Irf7 -/mice (Fig 8A-D) , whereas Ifit1 and Rsad2 upregulation in the dLN were only partially dependent on the presence of IRF3/IRF7 (Fig 8E and 8F) . Instead, for each ISG, the combined deficiency of IRF3, IRF5, and IRF7 resulted in reduced upregulation in the dLN compared with WT or Irf3 -/-Irf7 -/mice (Fig 8A-8F) . Together, these data demonstrate that induction of multiple ISGs at the site of inoculation is dependent on IRF3/IRF7, whereas an IRF5-dependent ISG induction pathway is activated in the dLN.",

For example, monocytes recruited to the dLN of LCMVinfected mice co-localize with and deplete virus-specific B cells in the interfollicular area [5] . Here, we show that pathogenic, but not acutely cleared CHIKV, similarly induces rapid recruitment of monocytes and neutrophils to the dLN. During pathogenic CHIKV infection, recruited monocytes and neutrophils localized to the SCS and medullary sinuses, with some We previously observed that pathogenic CHIKV infection blunts the accumulation of lymphocytes in the dLN by impairing recruitment of na\u00efve lymphocytes from the circulation [23] . Failure to recruit new lymphocytes was due to reduced function of high endothelial venules (HEVs) and decreased production of homeostatic chemokines. Preventing the early influx of monocytes and neutrophils into the dLN restored na\u00efve lymphocyte recruitment, as the lymphocyte numbers in the dLN were uniformly increased. Moreover, preventing the influx of monocytes and neutrophils into the dLN improved organization of B cell follicles, the T cell area, and the B-T cell border. It remains to be determined whether these infiltrating myeloid cells directly also affect the function of HEVs or the production of homeostatic chemokines. Furthermore, monocyte and neutrophil depletion improved virus-specific B cell responses in the dLN, with more GC B cells and plasma cells generated. This improved GC formation is likely a downstream consequence of boosted lymphocyte numbers and less perturbed dLN organization earlier during infection.",

In addition, and in contrast to WT mice, pathogenic CHIKV infection had minimal effects on the organization of B cell follicles and the T cell zone in the dLN of Nos2 -/and Nox2 -/mice. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that monocytes, but not neutrophils, upregulated iNOS expression following entry into the dLN. During LCMV infection of mice, monocytes infiltrating the dLN induced apoptosis in virus-specific and bystander B cells in a Nos2-dependent manner [5] . Studies with LCMV also observed B cell depletion in lymphoid tissue, however, individual roles for Nos2 [55] or Gr-1 + cells [56] were not defined. In contrast to LCMV infection, extensive lymphocyte death or an increase in apoptotic lymphocytes does not occur in the dLN following pathogenic CHIKV infection [23] , suggesting that the infiltrating monocytes do not impair B cell responses by inducing death of lymphocytes. Additionally, lymphocyte numbers were restored only partially in mice deficient for Nos2 or Nox2, suggesting that the combined action of Nos2 and Nox2 or other monocyte and/or neutrophil-derived factors contribute to the impairment of naive lymphocyte accumulation and disruption of LN organization. Depletion of either neutrophils or monocytes alone did not restore total lymphocyte numbers in the dLN, indicating that influx of either cell type is sufficient to prevent accumulation of na\u00efve lymphocytes. Although the improved dLN organization and lymphocyte accumulation observed in Nos2deficient mice could be ascribed to lack of iNOS expression uniquely in monocytes, the mechanism(s) by which neutrophils impair lymphocyte accumulation and disrupt dLN architecture remain to be determined.",

            "text": "Type I IFN signaling can modulate monocyte activation and differentiation, with contextdependent pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory effects [36, 54, 57, 58] . Although not required for recruitment of monocytes to the dLN after pathogenic CHIKV infection, type I IFN signaling drives iNOS expression in monocytes following entry into the dLN. Furthermore, IRF5, but not IRF3 or IRF7, was responsible for induction of iNOS. IRF3 or IRF7 are required for protection from fatal CHIKV infection, with systemic type I IFN production being driven by the IRF7 response [37, 38] . However, the contribution of type I IFN signaling and additional IRFs in other aspects of alphavirus pathogenesis remains poorly defined. Our work suggests that an IRF5-dependent pathway acts locally in draining lymphoid tissue following infection with CHIKV, whereas IRF3/7-dependent pathways are activated at the site of inoculation. Studies in IRF5-overexpressing cells found that IRF5 induces a distinct subset of IFN\u03b1 genes compared with other IRFs, such as IRF7 [59] . In addition to IFN\u03b1, IRF5 also promotes the transcription of genes encoding proinflammatory cytokines, such as Il12b, Tnfa, and Il6 [41] and several chemokines [60] . Similar to our observations, IRF5 promotes the induction of several proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, as well as recruitment and activation of lymphocytes in the dLN following West Nile Virus (WNV) infection of mice [61] . However, these IRF5-dependent responses were ultimately protective by limiting viral spread and promoting optimal B cell immunity. In contrast, our data suggest that pathogenic strains of CHIKV trigger an IRF5-dependent inflammatory pathway in the dLN that activates infiltrating monocytes and neutrophils, ultimately causing disruption of dLN architecture and decreased virus-specific B cell responses.",

Upon activation with TLR ligands, IRF5 expression also can be induced in human monocytes, neutrophils, and macrophages [41, 62, 66] . Thus, many immune cell types can express IRF5, either constitutively or upon activation. Viral infections or agonists of TLR7 or TLR9 can activate IRF5 in DCs in vitro in a MyD88-dependent manner [39] [40] [41] . Following pathogenic CHIKV infection, we observed a partial role for TLR7 in iNOS upregulation, suggesting that recognition of endosomal viral RNA contributes to monocyte activation. However, our data suggest role(s) for other MyD88-dependent TLR(s) in activating IRF5 to promote iNOS expression in infiltrating monocytes. One or more of these TLRs may be activated by endogenous damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) released from damaged or dying cells during the early stages of CHIKV infection, either at the site of inoculation or in the dLN. The cell-intrinsic requirements for TLR(s), IRF5, and IFNAR1 expression in dLN monocyte iNOS upregulation during CHIKV infection remain to be determined through the use of conditional knockout mice.",
