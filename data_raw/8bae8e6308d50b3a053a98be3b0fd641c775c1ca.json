Here, we report the genomic reconstruction of GalN/GalNAc utilization pathway in Streptococci and the diversified aga regulons. We delineated two new paralogous AgaR regulators for the GalN/GalNAc catabolism pathway. The electrophoretic mobility shift assays experiment demonstrated that AgaR2 (AgaR1) binds the predicted palindromes, and the combined in vivo data from reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction and RNA-seq suggested that AgaR2 (not AgaR1) can effectively repress the transcription of the target genes. Removal of agaR2 (not agaR1) from Streptococcus suis 05ZYH33 augments significantly the abilities of both adherence to Hep-2 cells and anti-phagocytosis against RAW264.7 macrophage. As anticipated, the dysfunction in AgaR2mediated regulation of S. suis impairs its pathogenicity in experimental models of both mice and piglets. Our finding discovered two novel regulators specific for GalN/GalNAc catabolism and assigned them distinct roles into bacterial infections. To the best of our knowledge, it might represent a first paradigm that links the GalN/GalNAc catabolism pathway to bacterial pathogenesis.",

            "text": "Amino sugars are referred to a variety of diversified/complex monosaccharides in which a hydroxyl group is chemically replaced with the amine group. Most of current knowledge on the metabolism of amino sugars comes from studies with Escherichia coli (Reizer et al. 1996) , Bacillus subtilis (Freymond et al. 2006; Gaugue et al. 2014; Plumbridge 2015) and Streptomycetes coelicolor (Rigali et al. 2008) . Relative to the best-known examples of amino sugars, glucosamine (GlcN) and N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), the investigations on the other two amino sugar derivatives of galactose, N-acetyl-d-galactosamine (GalNAc) and d-galactosamine (GalN), are relatively limited, but increasingly accumulated (Abu-Qarn et al. 2008; Leyn et al. 2012) . It seemed very likely that GalN/GalNAc amino sugars as common components participate in the formation of various cell structures/constitutes in three domains of life (Abu-Qarn et al. 2008; Plumbridge 2015) . In general, not only does GalNAc act as an element of lipopolysaccharide displayed on bacterial cell wall (Bernatchez et al. 2005; Leyn et al. 2012) , and but also connects carbohydrate chains in mammalian mucins (Carraway and Hull 1991) . Additionally, it functions as the substrate in N-acetyl \u03b2galactosidation, a new type of post-translational modification of protein in organisms, including bacterial pathogens (Sadler et al. 1979 ; Barr and Nordin 1980; Davis et al. 1986; Abu-Qarn et al. 2008) . Given the multiple roles played by GalN/GalNAc, we therefore anticipated a hypothesis that GalN/GalNAc metabolism might be linked to bacterial infectivity.",

Interestingly, a recent comparative genomics-based study suggested an extensive diversity in GalN/GalNAc utilization pathways of Proteobacteria such as Shewanella (Leyn et al. 2012) . In particular note the first two steps of this pathway exhibit of high variability, while the latter three steps are largely conserved (Leyn et al. 2012) . In E. coli, not only does AgaR regulator that belongs to the DeoR family of transcriptional factors, act as an autoregulator, but also negatively controls the expression of two aga genes (agaZ and agaS) of GalN/ GalNAc catabolism pathway via direct binding of the specific palindromes in front of these target genes (Ray and Larson 2004) . Although the fact that both GalN and GalNAc can induce activities of these aga genes-encoding protein products is aware, the physiological ligands for AgaR repressor remain unclear (Leyn et al. 2012) .",

According to the differentiation in their bacterial capsule structure, this Streptococcus species is categorized into 35 serotypes (Feng et al. , 2014b . Among them, serotype 2 (SS2) is generally believed to be most virulent, in that it is frequently isolated from clinical diseased swine (Ma et al. 2009; Feng et al. 2014b ) and human sporadic cases (Feng et al. 2009b) and/or big-scale outbreaks (Tang et al. 2006; Chen et al. 2007) . We are aware that SS2 has spread to more than 30 countries/regions and claims nearly 1600 cases of human infections worldwide (Feng et al. 2014b ). The molecular mechanism underlying bacterial pathogenicity has been partially delineated thus far (Feng et al. 2014b) , and these identified virulence determinants include the previouslyknown virulence factors exemplified with capsule (Benga et al. 2008; Seitz et al. 2014 ) and suilysin (Jacobs et al. 1996; Lun et al. 2003; Takeuchi et al. 2014 ). In addition to the regulatory networks amongst the newly identified factors (e.g., the two-component systems SalK/SalR , NisK/NisR [Xu et al. 2014] , CiaRH [Li et al. 2011], etc.) , it would be of particular interest to note the contributions of enzymes from central metabolisms (enolase [Eno] [Esgleas et al. 2008; Feng et al. 2009a; Zhang et al. 2009a; Lu et al. 2012] , glutamine synthase [GlnA] [Si et al. 2009 ], Inosine 5-monophosphate dehydrogenase [Impdh] Zhou et al. 2014 ], etc.) to bacterial pathogenesis (Feng et al. 2014b) .

            "text": "For genomic reconstruction of the regulons, we used the well-established comparative genomics approach (Rodionov 2007) . The approach includes inference of transcriptional factor-binding sites (TFBSs), construction of nucleotide positional weight matrices (PWMs) for TFBSs motifs, and reconstruction of regulons in complete genomes on the basis of prediction of putative TFBSs in the promoter gene regions. First, in the studied Lactobacillales genomes, we revealed orthologs of previously known genes for GalNAc utilization (Table S3 ). Second, we predicted possible transcriptional regulators for the uncovered GalNAc utilization. Candidate regulators were attributed to the regulons by using a genomic colocalization and co-occurence of a putative regulator with the identified GalNAc utilization genes. Such analysis defined two groups of transcriptional regulators belonging to the HutC subfamily of the GntR family (Fig. 7) . For each group of AgaR proteins, we identified putative binding motifs analyzing upstream regions of presumably regulated gene by the Discover Profile tool implemented in the RegPredict Web server (Novichkov et al. 2010) . In this approach, putative TFBSs were determined as overrepresented words in upstream regions of putatively coregulated genes. Based on the genomic co-occurrence and co-presence of genes, it has been proposed that AgaR1binding sites should be located upstream hydrolase and PTS genes while AgaR2 sites ought to be upstream of deacetylase, isomerase, and aldolase genes. For the prediction of putative TFBSs, we analyzed upstream regions of probably related operons, expanding \u2212400 to +100 bp relative to start codon of the first gene of the operon. Both AgaR1 and AgaR2 belong to HutC subfamily. TFBSs for HutC subfamily proteins have structure of an even palindrome (Rigali et al. 2002; Suvorova et al. 2015) . Thus, for prediction of the AgaR1 and AgaR2 TFBSs motifs, we searched for even palindromic DNA motifs of 14-24 bp. Among all motifs found for each set of upstream regions, we selected the longest motif with the highest information content. The selected motif was quality controlled by two approaches, (1) consistency check and (2) phylogenetic footprinting. Consistency check (Mironov et al. 1999; Rodionov 2007) was done, that is, motif was checked for the presence in multiple number of genomes. High quality motif should find predicted TFBSs in upstream regions of predicted regulated operons in genomes having the analyzed regulator, but not in genomes lacking the regulator. Phylogenetic footprinting technique is based on analysis of multiple alignments for upstream regions of orthologous genes (Shelton et al. 1997 ). High quality motif should find predicted TFBSs that are located inside conserved islands of multiple alignments. When the high quality of the motif was confirmed by both consistency check and phylogenetic footprinting, the identified regulatory motifs were used for the construction of the PWMs (profiles) and the obtained matrices were used to determine additional candidate regulatory sites in the analyzed genomes, using the Run Profile tool in the RegPredict Web server. The scores of sites were calculates as a sum of nucleotide weights for each position.",

ANA-3 (Leyn et al. 2012 ). Here we used the same approach for reconstruction of the GalNAc utilization pathway in the zoonotic agent, S. suis ( Fig. 1 and Table S1 ). For integrated genomic reconstruction of GalNAc utilization pathways and concordant transcriptional regulation, we searched orthologs of known GalNAc utilization genes (Leyn et al. 2012 ) in complete Lactobacillales genomes. As a result, the genes encoding, this metabolic pathway was identified in 16 genomes representing four families, Streptococcaceae, Lactobacillaceae, Enterobacteraceae, and Carnobacteriaceae (Table S1 ). The minimal number of genes in the reconstructed regulons was detected in Lactobacillus helveticus and Streptococcus pyogenes. In these organisms, only one or two genes from the GalNAc utilization pathway were found because these genes were insufficient for GalNAc utilization. Most probably, these organisms cannot utilize GalNAc. The minimal gene set allowing utilization of GalNAc is present in a group of closely related genomes including Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus mitis, and Streptococcus pneumonia. This gene set contains genes for regulator (agaR), galactosamine-6-phosphate deaminase/isomerase (agaS), glycoside hydrolase (bgaC), and PTS (gadVWEF). The other well-studied Streptococcus genomes also contain genes for the tagatose-1,6-diphosphate aldolase (agaY). In contrast, all the analyzed Lactobacillus lack agaY gene but contain the gene for N-acetylgalactosamine-phosphate deacetylase (agaA). Amongst Streptococcaceae, agaA gene was identified only in the S. suis genome. The gene for tagatose-6-phosphate kinase (agaZ) was found only in Enterococcus faecalis and Carnobacterium sp. 17-4.",

Thus, the absence of this gene in the Aga regulons points to the ability of the organism to utilize only GalN, but not GalNAc utilization. Thus, organisms lacking agaA gene should have GalN-specific transporters whereas organism having agaA gene should be able to transport GalNAc (Leyn et al. 2012) . To predict the specificity of the Lactobacillaceae transport systems, we compared all the identified PTSs to the previously described ones. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that all the Lactobacillaceae PTSs are orthologous to the transport system from Haemophilus parasuis (Fig. S4 ). This PTS was previously proposed to be specific to GalN-containing oligosaccharides. Co-occurrence and co-localization of this PTS with the hydrolase genes in the most studied genomes confirms its specificity to the oligosaccharides. On the other hand, PTS genes are co-localized also with the agaA gene in the large number of studied genomes (Table S3 ) that designate to the possibility of this system to transport GalNAc or both GalNAc and GalN containing oligomers. However, we cannot have success in predicting the precise specificity of the gad-VWEF encoded PTS, using only the comparative genomics approach.",

Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the predicted regulators form two separate orthologous groups that we named AgaR1 and AgaR2 (Fig. 3) . A strong tendency of agaR1 and agaR2 genes to cluster onto the chromosome with the GalNAc utilization genes suggests conservation of their function (Fig. 2) .

In most analyzed genomes, agaR1 is co-localized with genes for glycoside hydrolase and PTS, whereas agaR2 tends to be clustered onto the chromosome with the genes for deacetylase, isomerase, and aldolase ( Fig. 2 and Table S3 ). Thus, we proposed that AgaR1-binding sites should be located upstream hydrolase and PTS genes while AgaR2 sites ought to be upstream of deacetylase, isomerase, and aldolase genes. Upstream regions of genes presumably regulated by each transcriptional factor were analyzed using Discover Profile tool of the RegPredict Web resource. After the identification of putative-binding motif, we searched for additional regulatory sites in the analyzed genomes and finally reconstructed AgaR1 and AgaR2 regulons.",

Predicted AgaR1-binding sites have a length 20 bp, whereas the predicted-binding sites for AgaR2 are 18 bp sequences ( Fig. 5A and Table  S4 ). Both AgaR1 and AgaR2-binding motifs have a palindrome AT-rich central part. The AgaR1-binding motif is AT-rich at all times and quite degenerated, that is, has moderate information content. On the other hand, the AgaR2-binding motif is more CG-rich and conserved and has a higher information content than AgaR1-binding motif. Additionally, AgaR2-binding motif demonstrate similarities with the motifs of some regulators, previously characterized experimentally or in silico, such as GnbR of Lactobacillus casei BL23 (Bidart et al. 2014) and NagR proteins of B. subtilis (Bertram et al. 2011; Leyn et al. 2013 ) and various Lactoacillales (Ravcheev et al. 2013) . Composition of the AgaR1 and AgaR2 regulons varies between species (Fig. 2) . In Lactobacillus rhamnosus (L. rhamnosus), Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis), and Carnobacterium sp. 17-4, all genes for GalNAc utilization are organized in a single operon that is regulated by a single regulator, AgaR2 in the first two genomes and AgaR1 in the last one ( Fig. 2 and Table S3 ). In the most part of the Streptococcaceae and Lactobaciilaceae genomes, we observed a strong \"division of labor\" between the two regulators (Fig. 2) . Thus, AgaR1-binding sites were found upstream of hydrolase/PTS genes, whereas AgaR2 looks to regulate genes for deacetylase/isomerase/aldolase (Fig. 2) . In the genomes of S. suis, Lactobacillus gasseri (L. gasseri) and Lactobacillus johnsonii (L. johnsonii), overlapping of regulons was detected (Fig. 2) . In all these genomes, genes for the transport system seemed likely to be under double regulation by AgaR1 and AgaR2.

The 6xHis tagged version of this recombinant S. suis AgaR2 protein was also determined by Western blot using the anti-6xHis tag primary antibody (Fig. 4B) . Chemical cross-linking assays with the EGS cross-linker visualized clearly the EGS dose-dependent dimerization of AgaR2, indicating its predominant solution structure of this protein is a dimer (Fig. 4C) . Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry-based determination of tryptic peptides of the recombinant AgaR2 protein band excised from an SDS-PAGE gel (Fig. 4A ) verified its identity, in that the peptides matched S. suis SSU05_0447 protein with 77% coverage of the expected peptides (Fig. 4D) .",

Given that two possibilities are present (either the contaminated protein with the molecular mass at the dimeric position, or the dimeric form of AgaR1), Western blotting with the anti-6xHis tag primary antibody was conducted. As anticipated, it clearly showed that two protein bands with an appropriate molecular mass (~31 kDa for monomer and ~60 kDa for dimer), ruling out the possibility of protein contamination (Fig. S2B ). This observation is unexpected, but not without precedent. In fact we recently encountered a similar scenario in the case of the Brucella BioR regulator that is also a member of the GntR family transcription factor (Feng et al. 2013a ). The essence of BioR1 forming a dimer was further proved by chemical cross-linking assays (Fig. S2C) . MS-based analyses of two protein bands of AgaR1 (one is cut from a dimer, the other is collected from a monomer) validated exactly the identity wherein the two forms of peptides covered S. suis SSU05_0448 protein at the level of no less than 80% ( Fig. S2D and E).",

Thereby, we employed EMSA to probe the binding of the AgaR2 (and/or AgaR1) protein to the cognate palindromes (Table S4 , Fig. 5A and B) . On the S. suis chromosome, totally three putative AgaR2-binding sites (SSU05_0195 probe, SSU05_1259 probe and SSU05_0448/9 site 2 probe) were localized, whereas only one possible AgaR1-recognizable site (SSU05_0448/9 site 1 probe) was detected. Because of the absence of the predicted AgaR2binding site upstream of the agaR2 gene, we expected that this gene is not autoregulated. Indeed, EMSA experiments suggested that AgaR2 protein cannot bind to its own promoter region (SSU05_0447 probe), ruling out the possibility of autoregulation by AgaR2 regulator (Fig. 5C ). By contrast, EMSA tests revealed clearly that AgaR2 protein bound the other three AgaR2-binding palindromes in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5D-F) . Additionally, we also used S. suis AgaR2 protein to evaluate the function of the two AgaR-binding sites in front of the EF1809 locus of E. faecalis V583, a close relative of S. suis. As a result, AgaR2 physically interacted with the EF1809 site 2, TTGTGGTTATAACCAGTT (Fig. 5H) , but not the EF1809 site 1, TTTATTGACAAAATAAAAAA (Fig. 5G) further validated the specificity of AgaR2 binding.",

The \u0394agaR2 (\u0394447) isogenic mutant was constructed, using an approach of homologous recombination, and its complementary strain C\u0394agaR2 (C\u0394447) was generated through the low-copy plasmid pVA838-borne expression of agaR2 gene (Table S1 ). We noted that the deletion of agaR2 does not affect its growth (Fig. S1A) . Additionally, no obvious alteration of capsule was observed in the \u0394 agaR2 mutant in comparison with the WT strain 05ZYH33 (Fig. S1B and C) . The qPCR-based transcriptional analyses showed that removal of agaR2 gene gave at least five-fold increment of agaS (agaAY and bgaC-gadVWEF operon) expression (Fig. 6B) . Whereas the transcription of the above target genes was restored to the level seen in its parental strain S. suis 05ZYH33 (Fig. 6B) . Similar results were also observed in altered expression profile of the \u0394agaR2 mutant revealed by the RNA-Seq (e.g., expression of the three genes SSU05_0195 (agaS), SSU05_1259 (agaA), and SSU05_1258 (agaY) are elevated upon removal of agaR2, Table 1 ). Therefore, it seemed true that AgaR2 is a functional repressor for the Streptococcus GalNAc utilization pathway. In contrast, we failed to visualize any significant alteration of the bgaC (SSU05_0448) expression level in the \u0394agaR1 mutant in comparison with the WT strain and its complementary strain CagaR1 (not shown). The suggested possibility that agaR1 might play an uncovered role or be an evolutional relic with loss of physiological demand and/or advantage, in that (1) there is no in vivo regulatory role attributed to its protein product AgaR1 although it retains DNA-binding activity to its own promoter, (2) the fact that all the other GalNAc metabolism-related genes are without control by AgaR1 is due to the lack of the predicted AgaR1-recognizable palindromes, (3) no physiological function can be present in GalNAc metabolism, even AgaR1 can autoregulate itself. Thus, our subsequent interests focused on AgaR2 regulator.",

First, Hep-2 cell line was used to evaluate the ability of bacterial adherence ( Fig. 7A and B) , and RAW264.7 macrophage was subjected to dissecting its capability of anti-phagocytosis ( Fig. 7C and D) . Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-based experiments elucidated that around threefold increment of bacterial adherence potential to Hep-2 cells was given in the \u0394agaR2 mutant relative to the WT 05ZYH33 strain (Fig. 7A and B) . Furthermore, the deletion of agaR2 gene was found to give nearly fivefold increment of anti-phagocytosis ability against RAW264.7 macrophage ( Fig. 7C and D) . This finding was in much similarity to scenarios seen with both \u0394neuB and \u0394cps2B mutants of S. suis 2 (note: the two genes are involved in bacterial surface architecture) . Thereby, we anticipated that the enhancement in abilities of bacterial attachment and anti-phagocytosis might be partially due to the altered carbohydrates with GalN/ GalNAc residues on bacterial cell wall surface and this kind of alteration could be attributed to the dysfunction in AgaR2-mediated regulation of GalN/GalNAc utilization pathway. In contrast, no obvious difference between the \u0394agaR1 mutant and its parental strain 05ZYH33 was observed on either bacterial adherence to Hep-2 cell line or bacterial anti-phagocytosis against RAW264.7 macrophage (not shown). In fact, such a different effect exerted by AgaR2 (and AgaR1) is not very surprising, in that only Aga2 (not AgaR1) evolved to possess a regulatory role in controlling GalNAc catabolism in S. suis.",

In the mice infection assays, all the 10 BALB/c (4week old, female) mice infected with the WT strain 05ZYH33 were sick shortly, and most of the rats died within 60 h (Fig. 7E ). By contrast, mice of the negative control group inoculated with THB survived (not shown). In particular note, nearly all the mice infected with the \u0394agaR2 mutant survived, while most of animals injected with the complementary strain C\u0394agaR2 died within 3 days. To verify the results obtained from the above model of mice, we repeated the infection tests using the model of SPF-piglets, natural hosts for S. suis. As a result, we observed that the six SPF-piglets inoculated with WT virulent strain developed most of the typical disease symptoms (high fever, limping, swollen joints, etc.), and most of them died on day 1 (Fig. 7F) . As expected, all the piglets infected with the \u0394agaR2 mutant survived during the period of entire experiment. However, the re-introduction of agaR2 gene into the \u0394agaR2 mutant restored fully its strong virulence (Fig. 7F) . Collectively, we believed that the prevalent regulator AgaR2 for GalN/GalNAc utilization pathway contributes to bacterial infectivity of S. suis, although we failed to note an apparent role of the other secondary regulator AgaR1 in bacterial pathogenicity (not shown).",

As you can see from the working model, AgaZ is absent in S. suis. It seemed likely that our continued genomic analyses pointed out that S. suis actually lacks any ortholog of this gene. Thereby, we speculated that the loss of AgaZ function in S. suis might be compensated by two other genes that are not in aga regulon: (1) SSU05_1041 (lacC2; tagatose 6-phosphate kinase, EC 2.7.1.144), (2) SSU05_0543 (pfk, 6-phosphofructokinase, EC 2.7.1.11).

            "text": "Through extensive analyses for genomic contexts from Firmicutes, we dissected two GalN/GalNAc pathwayspecific regulators namely AgaR2 and AgaR1. The agaR1 gene is divergently transcribed into genes forming an operon and encoding a \u03b2galactosidase (BgaC) (Hu et al. 2014 ) and a PTS sugar uptake system (named agaBCDE that could be a GalN uptake system). The agaR2 gene in many Streptococcus species is located in front of the genes encoding the predicted galactosamine-6-phosphate isomerase and Tagatose 1,6-diphosphate aldolase, two key enzymes in the AGA catablic pathway. In S. suis, the locus SSU05_0448 is annotated to be agaR1, whereas SSU05_0447 is referred to agaR2. Somewhat evolutionally distinct from the paradigm regulator (the E. coli agaR protein product) that belongs to the DeoR family of transcription factor, the two newly identified regulators AgaR2 and AgaR1 are classified into the GntR family of transcription repressors (Figs. 3, S1) . Additionally, it seemed likely that the two GntR-like regulators (AgaR2 and AgaR1) themselves fit into two different subgroups and might possess the varied preference in their DNAbinding sites (Figs. 3, S4) . The fact that AgaR2-recognizable palindrome is predicted to be present in front of multiple target genes whereas AgaR1 has only one site located in its own promoter region (Fig. 2 ) raised the possibility that AgaR2 could have been evolved into a prevalent/ major regulator for GalN/GalNAc utilization pathway (AgaR1 might be a minor/and even a cryptic regulator). Our in vitro gel shift assays validated the direct interaction between the AgaR2 (and/or AgaR1) protein and its binding sites (Figs. 5, S3 ). Given the facts that a significant regulated expression of GalN/GalNAc utilization-related genes (such as agaS, agaAY , and bgaC) by AgaR2 was observed, however, no in vivo role could be attributed to AgaR1, we came to be more confident that AgaR2 relative to AgaR1 acts as a prevalent/leading player in modulating expression of genes encoding bacterial GalN/ GalNAc catabolism in most Firmicutes. However, we did not obtain evidence for physiological ligand/molecular effector of AgaR2 repressor, although we observed that GalNAc does induce the expression of GalN/GalNAc catabolism-related genes such as agaS (Fig. 6C) .",

The triangle on the top represents the addition of the EGS cross-linker in varied concentrations (0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, 5, 10, 20 \u03bcmol/L in the right-hand eight lanes [left to right]). The minus sign denotes no addition of EGS. The protein sample was separated with 12% SDS-PAGE. The MS-based identification of the purified AgaR1 protein with the solution structure of both monomer (in D) and dimer (in E). The tryptic peptides that match the AgaR1 protein are given in bold and under-lined type. Figure S3 . Binding of AgaR1 to the predicted palindromes. The predicted AgaR1-binding site (in A) of SSU05_0448/9 gene bound AgaR1 (SSU05_0448) protein, whereas the AgaR2-binding site (in B) of this locus does not interact with AgaR1 protein. (C) Streptococcus suis AgaR1 protein bound to the predicted AgaR1 site of EF814 gene from Enterococcus faecalis V583. (D) S. suis AgaR1 protein bound to the putative AgaR1 site of EF1809 gene from E. faecalis V583. The minus sign denotes no addition of AgaA1 protein. The protein levels of AgaR2 (on the right-hand four lanes of each panel [left to right]) were 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 pmol. The protein samples were incubated with 0.2 pmol of the DIG-labeled probe in a total volume of 15 \u03bcL. A representative result from three independent gel shift assays (7% native PAGE) is given. Figure S4 . Phylogenetic analyses of phosphotransferase system (PTS). In total, the PTS system is classified into five sub-groups, one of which is PTS-V (highlighted in blue). Locus tag of PTS system is showed here for AgaC, SSU05_0451 is indicated in red.",
