This self-assembling protein nanoparticle contains five CD8 + HLA-A03-11 supertypes-restricted epitopes from antigens expressed during Toxoplasma gondii's lifecycle, the universal CD4 + T cell epitope PADRE, and flagellin as a scaffold and TLR5 agonist. These CD8 + T cell epitopes were separated by N/KAAA spacers and optimized for proteasomal cleavage. Self-assembling protein nanoparticle adjuvanted with TLR4 ligand-emulsion GLA-SE were evaluated for their efficacy in inducing IFN-\u03b3 responses and protection of HLA-A*1101 transgenic mice against T. gondii. Immunization, using self-assembling protein nanoparticle-GLA-SE, activated CD8 + T cells to produce IFN-\u03b3. Self-assembling protein nanoparticle-GLA-SE also protected HLA-A*1101 transgenic mice against subsequent challenge with Type II parasites. Hence, combining CD8 + T cell-eliciting peptides and PADRE into a multi-epitope protein that forms a nanoparticle, administered with GLA-SE, leads to efficient presentation by major histocompatibility complex Class I and II molecules. Furthermore, these results suggest that activation of TLR4 and TLR5 could be useful for development of vaccines that elicit T cells to prevent toxoplasmosis in humans.",

Protection is achieved through stimulation of CD4 + helper T lymphocytes and CD8 + IFN-\u03b3 producing T lymphocyte responses. These CD8 + T cells recognize octamer/nonamer peptides presented on HLA supermotif molecules on infected cells. Previously, our laboratory (RM, KE) identified epitopes eliciting CD8 + T cells derived from proteins expressed during different phases of the Toxoplasma life cycle. HLA-A02, A03-11 and B07 human, supermotif, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules are present in~90% of humans, [3] [4] [5] [6] and therefore are capable of presenting these epitopes. As the discovery of such protective peptide epitopes accumulates, mechanisms are needed to effectively present these epitopes to the immune system of the host.",

            "text": "We have pioneered a platform known as Self-Assembling Protein Nanoparticles (SAPNs). [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] SAPNs induce a strong immune response due to the repetitive display of antigens. 7, 10, 12 They promote immune responses by CD4 + as well as CD8 + T cells by incorporating the T cell epitopes into the core architecture of the nanoparticle. 8, 9, 11 They trigger a strong innate immune response by activating the TLR5 pathway through the adjuvant flagellin. 13 Because of their size and shape they have the potential to reach follicular dendritic cells that are critical for antigen presentation and processing. 14 Although macrophages play a role in immunity, interactions between SAPN and macrophages were not studied. SAPNs induce immune response that are orders of magnitudes stronger than Keyhole limpet hemocyanin, which is a standard vaccine carrier. We previously designed SAPN-based vaccine candidates for various infectious diseases including malaria, 10, 11, 14, 15 HIV, 16 SARS, 17 and influenza. 18 Earlier findings, and recent parallel work with a recombinant polypeptide, SAPNs, and GLA-SE ( Fig. 1 and unpublished data [DL] ) provide the foundation for our present studies. These earlier findings provide a basis for use of immunosense selected peptides from different genetic isolates of T. gondii (Fig. 1a) , a flagellin scaffold, 7, 8, 13, 19 and adjuvanting with GLA-SE. [20] [21] [22] [23] Earlier studies from the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research with malaria based SAPNs demonstrated that flagellin molecules improved immunogenicity (DL, PB, unpublished work). Initially, this was the basis for using flagellin as a SAPN scaffold in our T. gondii studies (Fig. 1b) . This approach was also used in our work with influenza. 24 This work suggested that flagellin would be helpful as a scaffold and immunogen in our newest T. gondii work.",

Purified IgG from a control monkey did not protect any mice; 3) Purified IgG from immunized monkeys, mixed with P. falciparum sporozoites, prevented the sporozoite from infecting primary hepatocytes from human liver in tissue culture. IgG from control monkeys did not. Thus, we used this preliminary, foundational data when we chose GLA-SE as the adjuvant for our studies herein. GLA-SE has two components, GLA and SE. GLA is too hydrophobic to be used alone and any formulation of GLA would have other excipients making the formulation nonequivalent to GLA. Earlier studies demonstrated that the emulsion, called \"SE\", did not adjuvant most proteins when administered alone. At present, GLA-SE is in pre-clinical studies or clinical trials as an adjuvant to prevent cancer, herpes, Leishmania, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections. Our earlier studies also demonstrated that GLA-SE was superior to ALUM as an adjuvant for our polypeptide. 25 GLA-SE was also superior to ALUM in primates immunized with SAPN. In fact, ALUM diminished the response to GLA-SE plus SAPN (DL, PB, unpublished work).",

They were conjugated with PADRE, a universal CD4 + helper T lymphocyte epitope. 26 This synthetic polypeptide is effective in mice and more effective than the pooled peptides separately. 5, 23 PADRE binds promiscuously to MHC class II variants, and augments effector functions of CD8 + T cells through stimulation of IL2 production by CD4 + T helper cells. 27, 28 Epitopes eliciting both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells are important components in the formulation of successful vaccines that drive protective responses. 29 Our data show that incorporating PADRE into the SAPN constructs and delivering it in TLR4 ligand emulsion adjuvant (GLA-SE), resulted in activation of CD8 + T cells. This vaccine formulation led these cells to produce IFN-\u03b3. They protected against subsequent challenge with Type II parasites given as a high inoculum.

            "text": "The location of CD8 + epitopes within a protein sequence has been shown to be critical. Our arrangement of peptide epitopes into a polypeptide induced robust immunity. 25 Deconvolution of peptide components has shown that certain epitopes alone may have different toxicity when separated from other peptides (El Bissati, McLeod, et al., in preparation). We already know that the adjuvanted polypeptide can protect in studies that are described in a separate manuscript. 25 We also found that the HLA Class 1, A*1101 interacting peptides are specific for HLA A*1101 and not to other HLA supermotifs B7 or A2. 25 Further, we demonstrated that the mouse C57Bl6 macrophages cannot present these peptides to HLA A*1101 T cells. 25 Further, these five CD8 + epitopes, as well as full-length proteins from which they originate, were characterized to determine how well conserved the proteins, and especially the specific peptides we included, are across multiple strains of genetically divergent parasites from different geographic regions (Tables 2-4 genetically divergent strains (Fig. 1a) supports the use of an immunosense approach. This approach creates a single protein which contains the relevant epitopes but does not include extraneous epitopes that are potentially harmful, as certain T. gondii epitopes are known to be. There were far fewer polymorphisms in our smaller octamer nonamer peptides (Tables 2-4 ) than in the full-length proteins (Table 3 , Figs. S1-S5). There were good binding octamer/nonamers for three A11 epitopes among all the different genetic isolates ( Table 4 ). The predicted binding scores for the peptides from the many genetically polymorphic strains were high for all but two peptides (Table 4 ). In contrast, it would take many full-length variants to obtain good geographic coverage of either of these polymorphic proteins if peptides other than our octamer/nonamer were critical to that protection. This provides further conceptual support for using an immunosense approach to make a vaccine with, potential to work well, and most parsimoniously, in many geographic areas. There are recent data concerning the unique processing of T. gondii proteins in human cells. Quite remarkably, there are longer (likely decoy) peptides that bind HLA-A2 in the natural infection of THP1 cells. 37 This makes our targeted immunosense approach, beginning with human cells, then using HLA transgenic mice, especially valuable in creating a vaccine for people, rather than mice. These are critical considerations important beyond a vaccine protective against just this organism, when one wants to have broad utility across different demographics, worldwide. This is what we are working toward because of the substantial disease burden of toxoplasmosis as a global clinical problem. 38 Data from studies of human cells and mice, in our work, considered together, demonstrate the robust and practical use of this model system. [3] [4] [5] [6] 25 Antigen processing and presentation in humans and mice have differences that are well known. For example, as shown elegantly, recently, 39 human and murine tapasin diverge in sequence. These tapasins are chaperones of MHC class I molecules. Newer murine models with human tapasin and proteasome might improve vaccine potency and be more relevant to human vaccine development. 39 Alternatively, our optimized cleavage sites, based on human infection, using human PBMC, may work as effectively in our HLA-A*1101 mice. This comparison will be tested in future studies. Further, there are other significant differences between mice and humans. Murine models have been imperfect predictors of vaccine performance in humans, apart from differences in HLA, tapasin or variants of ERAP. Differences in ERAP between mice and humans does not cause differences in processing and presentation. Other differences between mice and humans include very different total blood volume, rate of metabolism, skin composition/absorption rate, different TLR specificities, as well as other basic differences between murine and human cells. For example, human T cells, express Class II MHC, while mouse T cells do not. Nonetheless, relating to the question of whether HLA transgenic mice are a good approximation of human responses, Sette et al. made the following comment: despite the differences, when this issue was considered in detail, practical studies confirm that \"although there ought to be a difference, actual data in peer reviewed studies, show that there is little difference\". 40 Humanized mice with blood and liver transplants and other modifications are also still imperfect. These humanized mouse systems have not yet worked really well to demonstrate practical feasibility. For vaccine development, the FDA requires animal in vivo immunogenic data for IND submission. Vaccine developers have followed this requirement for the vaccines they are creating, which include viral vector or VLP-based vaccines. To date, there is no system that allows skipping the animal testing step. Most vaccines (e.g. viral, virus-like particles, proteins, bacterial) generate an immune response in an animal model. These immune responses provide preliminary data prior to studies in non-human primates and then in humans. This approach permits one to conclude that the vaccine is safe and 'active', even if the animal model is not absolutely predictive of precise human correlates, although that would be ideal. We have found that our approach appears to provide insight and to work effectively. [3] [4] [5] 25 This approach includes using bioinformatics, testing human cells for immunogenicity, and then testing those down-selected peptides re-assembled into a protein with linkers designed for proper cleavage. 41 This is followed by testing for efficacy and safety using HLA transgenic mice. [3] [4] [5] 25 This approach is shown in our data herein, in our previous foundational experiments, 25 and also by many others using other systems. This is for both immunogenicity of peptides or polypeptides or DNA or RNA in human cells first. This is then extended to murine cells, followed by protection measured as reduced parasite burden and enhanced survival. Although imperfect, there is considerable prior support, and support in these recent studies. The use of HLA transgenic mice can obviate problems of heterogeneity, both for MHC supermotifs, and parasite isolates. This is in a proven practical manner in vaccine development. 19, 37, [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] The issues of genetic polymorphism, as well as potential harmful constituents, are amplified in full-length natural proteins (Tables 1-4 ; Fig. 1 , S1-S5). Thus, the choice of peptides that are sufficient to interact with HLA molecules that are present in more than 90% of the human population can be made using bioinformatics in a rational and parsimonious manner. This approach considers parasite genetic variation in an inductive, immunosense manner that is proving to be valuable for development of vaccines for humans. The inclusion of flagellin into immunogens can serve as a potential adjuvant. [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] There is experience where flagellin has been safe and effective as an adjuvant in pre-clinical animal studies. [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] It also has been effective when used for immunizations of both younger and older persons in clinical trials for influenza vaccines. [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] There is a robust literature which describes studies of the mechanisms whereby this TLR5 ligand functions as an adjuvant. [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] In summary, our study showed that a SAPN-protein chain with five CD8 + T cell-eliciting MHC class I epitopes from T. gondii, and the MHC class II epitope PADRE, can be refolded to form a nanoparticle. Using HLA-A*1101 transgenic mice, we demonstrate that the SAPN emulsified in GLA-SE adjuvant elicits a protective MHC class I response. Thus, our work demonstrates that we have developed an improved assembly of peptides for cross presentation of CD8 + T cell eliciting epitopes (Fig. 6 ) in vaccines to prevent toxoplasmosis.",

Fourteen thousand cells per well were seeded in a 96-well plate at passages 5-9. 20-4 h later, we removed growth media. Growth media was replaced with DMEM high glucose (Hyclone, Logan, UT). This contained either a SAPN, or recombinant flagellin (Novus Biologicals), at concentrations of 0.1, 1, 10, 100, 1000 ng/mL, each in triplicate. Media alone was present in control wells. Wells were exposed to the stimulus for 24 h. Then, supernatant was collected and used to determine whether SEAP was present. This was determined with a Reporter Assay kit for SEAP (Novus Biologicals). This was done using the manufacturer's instructions. Media-only controls were used to normalize SEAP activity. This was used to determine each construct's EC50. Triplicate determinations were utilized for each experimental condition.",

Anesthesia was performed in an O 2 -rich induction chamber with 2% isoflurane. 25 Imaging took place 12 min after receiving luciferin. 25 Living Image \u00ae 2.20.1 software (Xenogen) was used for assessment of photonic emissions. 25 Pseudocolor representations of light intensity and mean photons/region of interest represent parasite burden in the imaging. 25 All these mouse experiments were replicated a minimum of two times, as in our earlier work. 25 In each group we used five mice.",

Ligating these receptors leads to the production of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-12, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1) and the expression of co-stimulatory molecules on the antigen-presenting cell surface. It remains to be determined whether the GLA-SE emulsion independently ligates TLR4 or whether SAPN are entrapped in the emulsion when this occurs, so both possibilities are shown.
