The mechanisms of HSV-1 infection and HSV-1's interactions with various host cells have been studied and reviewed extensively. Type I interferons were secreted by host cells upon HSV infection and play a vital role in controlling virus proliferation. A few studies, however, have focused on HSV-1 infection without the presence of interferon (IFN) signaling. In this study, HEK 293T cells with low toll-like receptor (TLR) and stimulator of interferon genes protein (STING) expression were infected with HSV-1 and subjected to a quantitative proteomic analysis. By using a subcellular fractionation strategy and high-performance mass spectrometry, a total of 6607 host proteins were quantified, of which 498 proteins were differentially regulated. A bioinformatics analysis indicated that multiple signaling pathways might be involved in HSV-1 infection. A further functional study indicated the role of Interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3), Coiled-coil-helix-coiled-coil-helix domain-containing protein 2 (CHCHD2), and Tripartite motif-containing protein 27 (TRIM27) in inhibiting viral DNA replication and proliferation. Our data provide a global view of host responses to HSV-1 infection in HEK 293T cells and identify the proteins involved in the HSV-1 infection process.",

According to a WHO report [1] , HSV-1 is estimated to have infected 67% of the world's population under the age of fifty. HSV-1 infection establishes life-long latency with reactivation triggered by stimuli like UV light, tissue damage, or compromised immunity [2] . The severity of HSV-1 infection varies from mild symptoms, such as cold sores and watery blisters on the skin or mucous membranes, to life-threatening encephalitis in humans [3] . As a double-stranded DNA virus, HSV-1 has a linear genome of 152 kbp surrounded by a protein layer called a tegument and a bilayer envelope with viral glycoproteins [4] . During infection, the virus first binds the receptors present on host cell surfaces through glycoproteins of the viral envelope and then transitions from attachment to penetration, leading to the release of the viral capsid and tegument proteins into the cytoplasm. Later, viral capsids with tegument proteins use the microtubule network to transfer to the nuclear envelope, where they interact with nuclear pores and release their uncoated genomes into the nucleoplasm to perform viral transcription and replication. During these processes, the viruses will utilize various host cell systems to promote their own replication.",

            "text": "As a powerful tool with high throughput and accuracy, MS-based proteomic analyses have been used increasingly in the analysis of virus-host interactions, aiming to discover new drug targets or unveil unknown mechanisms. Until now, proteomic analyses of HSV-1 have focused on virally induced changes in the cellular proteome [5] [6] [7] or protein post-translational modifications [8] and virus-protein interactions [9] [10] [11] during infection. In this study, a stable isotope-labeled amino acid culture (SILAC)-based quantitative proteomic analysis of HSV-1 infected HEK 293T cells was performed, aiming to explore the effects of HSV-1 infection on the host proteome. An RNAi-based functional analysis was employed to explore the role of several regulated host proteins in viral replication. In addition, the host cell activates various antiviral responses to limit viral infection. The entry of HSV-1 into host cells triggers a series of both innate and adaptive immune responses, in which innate immunity plays a central role in determining the final fate of infection [12] . HSV-1 and Sendai virus (SeV) have been employed as models for DNA and RNA viruses, respectively, and have been extensively used in virus-host interaction studies, especially in studies investigating the mechanisms of the host's immune response to DNA viruses and RNA viruses. A comparative analysis of the effects of SeV and HSV-1 infection on the host proteome has never been reported. Our previous SILAC-based quantitative analysis of SeV-infected HEK 293T cells highlighted several biological processes that may be involved in the viral replication process and virus-induced innate immune response [13] . In this study, we also compared the effects of SeV infection and HSV-1 infection on HEK 293T cells, and the biological processes regulated by both HSV-1 and SeV were identified. Our quantitative proteomic analysis of HSV-1-and SeV-infected cells can also help us to better understand HSV-1-or SeV-induced immune responses.",

HEK 293T cells are highly permissive to HSV-1 infection and have low TLR and STING expression, and thus their innate immune response during infection with a DNA virus is weak, resulting in weak activation of Interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and related biological processes. We performed a quantitative proteomic analysis on HEK 293T cells to minimize the effect of interferons on the regulation of host proteins and biological processes. Twenty hours p.i. was chosen as the time point for late phase, because we found that the HSV-1 DNA level was much higher ( Figure 1A) , and no significant apoptosis can be observed at this time point. This observation is consistent with the understanding that HSV-1 takes around 16-20 h to complete a lytic cycle [5] . However, the intracellular mRNA levels of IFNB1 and ISG56 were comparable between 4 and 20 h p.i., suggesting that type I IFN (IFN-I) production was not activated in HSV-1-infected HEK 293T cells, which is consistent with the literature [14, 15] .

These proteins were selected based on a comparison with our previous quantitative analysis of RNA virus-infected host cells. CHCHD2 was also regulated by SeV [13] , and IFITM3 was regulated by JEV [16] , while TRIM27 was only regulated by HSV-1. HEK 293T cells were transfected with siRNAs against IFITM3, CHCHD2, and TRIM27, and 24 h later, the cells were collected, and intracellular mRNAs were harvested for quantitative RT-PCR to test the knockdown efficiency of these siRNAs ( Figure 5A ). All six pairs of siRNAs decreased gene expression significantly and, therefore, were used for the following assays. Next, HEK 293T cells were transfected with the indicated siRNAs, and 24 h later, the cells were infected with HSV-1 at an MOI of 5. At 20 h p.i., both the cells and supernatants were collected, and the intracellular viral genomic DNA level was measured by quantitative RT-PCR. As shown in Figure 5B , the intracellular levels of HSV-1 DNA were significantly higher in cells transfected with siRNAs against IFITM3, CHCHD2, or TRIM27, suggesting that the knockdown of IFITM3, CHCHD2, or TRIM27 increased the intracellular level of HSV-1 DNA. We also determined viral titers in the supernatants, and found that the knockdown of IFITM3, CHCHD2, or TRIM27 also increased the HSV-1 titer ( Figure 5C ). This implies that IFITM3, CHCHD2, and TRIM27 play positive roles in defending against HSV-1 infection. [27] . Our previous study found that CHCHD2 can be induced by Zika virus infection in HeLa cells and may promote ZIKV replication and inhibit virus-induced IFN-I production [28] . We found that CHCHD2 was downregulated by HSV-1 infection in HEK 293T cells, and the knockdown of CHCHD2 can increase HSV-1 production in a cell culture supernatant ( Figure 5 ). However, the detailed role of CHCHD2 on virus proliferation at the molecular level is still unknown, and more studies are needed. In sum, by using a quantitative proteomic analysis of HSV-1-infected HEK 293T cells at two time points, we provided a global view of host-viral protein interactions during infection in the absence of type I IFN. We identified multiple pathways that may participate in HSV-1 infection through a GO analysis. A functional assay suggested a positive role of three proteins: IFITM3, CHCHD2, and TRIM27 in the anti-HSV-1 process. The role of CHCHD2 in inhibiting HSV-1 replication has never been reported. Further studies on these proteins are necessary for further understanding of the underlying mechanisms and may help us discover new targets for antiviral treatments. ",

            "text": "HSV-1 is a widespread contagious pathogen and has been studied for decades. During the last few decades, MS-based proteomic methods have contributed significantly to revealing more factors and mechanisms involved in HSV-1 infection and the corresponding host responses. A quantitative proteomic analysis using a 2D gel strategy was performed to explore the effects of HSV-1 infection on the host proteome [5, 6, 17] . However, due to the limits of the gel-based strategy, the number of regulated proteins identified was low. Berard et al. also performed a SILAC-based quantitative proteomic analysis of HSV-1 infected cells [7] , but they only used two replicates. In this study, a comprehensive analysis of HSV-1-infected HEK 239T cells was performed. To reduce the complexity of the proteins analyzed, cells were sub-fractionated into nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions, and three replicates were performed. A total of 6607 host proteins were quantified, of which 498 proteins were differentially regulated (Table S1) . A GO analysis based on a biological process highlighted several proteins groups that were affected by HSV-1 infection. The significance of the NF-\u03baB pathway [18] and the ubiquitin-proteasome system [19] on virus-host interactions during HSV infection have been reported repeatedly. In agreement with these reports, \"NIK/NF-\u03baB signaling\" and \"protein ubiquitination involved in ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process\" were enriched in our GO data. The \"positive regulation of GTPase activity\", \"negative regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter\", and \"negative regulation of cell proliferation\" enriched in this study coincided with previous results that showed HSV can activate dynamin 2 GTPase [20] and alter the loading and positioning of RNA Polymerase II on host genes [21] and that the translation initiation factor eIF2\u03b1 is inhibited by protein kinase RNA-activated (PKR) activation [22] , respectively.",

A wealth of data has suggested that IFITM3 strongly protects host cells against a broad range of viruses, including SARS coronavirus, influenza A virus, human immunodeficiency virus type 1, and Zika virus [23] . The antiviral effects of IFITM3 might be attributed to the blockage of virus entry by inhibiting the fusion of the virus membrane, though the mechanisms are still unclear. One possible mechanism is that by binding with vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein A (VAPA), IFITM3 disrupts intracellular cholesterol homeostasis and blocks viral release to cytosol [24] . This is consistent with our data and explains our finding that HSV-1 increases IFITM3 expression, and knockdown of this gene leads to higher virus proliferation.",

Our previous study found that CHCHD2 can be induced by Zika virus infection in HeLa cells and may promote ZIKV replication and inhibit virus-induced IFN-I production [28] . We found that CHCHD2 was downregulated by HSV-1 infection in HEK 293T cells, and the knockdown of CHCHD2 can increase HSV-1 production in a cell culture supernatant ( Figure 5 ). However, the detailed role of CHCHD2 on virus proliferation at the molecular level is still unknown, and more studies are needed.",

Y-axis: The intracellular level of HSV-1 DNA relative to NC. (C) The effects of the knockdown of selected proteins on virus titer in the supernatant. HEK 293T cells were transfected with mock or siRNAs for the selected genes, followed by a 24 h culture and then infected with HSV-1 at an MOI of 5. Supernatants were collected and viral titers in the supernatants was measured. The values are presented as the mean \u00b1 SD of three replicates. The cells transfected with scrambled siRNAs are indicated as NC. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01.",
