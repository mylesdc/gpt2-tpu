            "text": "T-cell-mediated immunotherapy of hematological malignancies requires selection of targeted tumor-associated antigens and T-cell epitopes contained in these tumor proteins. Epidermal growth factor receptor pathway substrate 8 (EPS8), whose function is pivotal for tumor proliferation, progression and metastasis, has been found to be overexpressed in most human tumor types, while its expression in normal tissue is low. The aim of the present study was to identify human leukemia antigen (HLA)-A*0201-restricted epitopes of EPS8 by using a reverse immunology approach. To achieve this, computer algorithms were used to predict HLA-A*0201 molecular binding, proteasome cleavage patterns as well as translocation of transporters associated with antigen processing. Candidate peptides were experimentally validated by T2 binding affinity assay and brefeldin-A decay assay. The functional avidity of peptide-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) induced from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy volunteers were evaluated by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assay and a cytotoxicity assay. Four peptides, designated as P455, P92, P276 and P360, had high affinity and stability of binding towards the HLA-A*0201 molecule, and specific CTLs induced by them significantly responded to the corresponding peptides and secreted IFN-\u03b3. At the same time, the CTLs were able to specifically lyse EPS8-expressing cell lines in an HLA-A*0201-restricted manner. The present study demonstrated that P455, P92, P276 and P360 were CTL epitopes of EPS8, and were able to be used for epitope-defined adoptive T-cell transfer and multi-epitope-based vaccine design.",

Identification of LAA and its cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) epitopes are of major importance for the development of tumor antigen-specific therapeutic and prophylactic vaccines.

EPS8 upregulation is thus expected to be involved in human carcinogenesis, implying that this gene may be used as a target in tumor immunotherapy. A previous study by our group demonstrated an elevated expression of EPS8 in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), its overexpression was inversely correlated with overall survival of patients (15) , and EPS8 protein as a vaccine reagent induced a CTL response in a murine breast carcinoma model (16) . From the aforementioned facts, it was speculated that this gene may be a prognostic marker and could be a target for immunotherapy of hematological malignancies.",

This cell line is transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP)-deficient and expresses HLA-A2. In the absence of exogenous antigen peptide load, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I expression levels on its surface are very low due to the poor stability of non-peptide-loaded MHC class I molecules. Epitope prediction. To identify the potential T-cell epitopes for EPS8, the HLA-A*0201 allele was screened, covering a wide range of populations (17) . First, the protein sequence was screened for the best binding epitopes using the algorithms SYFPEITHI (http://www.syfpeithi.de/) and Bioinformatics and Molecular Analysis Section (BIMAS; http://www-bimas. cit.nih.gov/). The cut-off score was adjusted to >20 for SYFPEITHI and T 1/2 >100 for BIMAS, and peptides matching these two criteria and which were shared by the two algorithms were selected. Second, the NetChop algorithm (http://www. cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetChop/) was used to predict whether the selected peptides in the first step would be cleaved at the C-terminus. Third, protein sequences were analyzed with five different algorithms for HLA-A*0201, including immune epitope database (IEDB; http://www.iedb.org/), NetMHC (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetMHC/), SVMHC (http://www.sbc.su.se/~pierre/svmhc/), EpiJen (http://www. ddg-pharmfac.net/epijen/EpiJen/EpiJen.htm) and Rankpep (http://imed.med.ucm.es/Tools/rankpep.html). Peptides predicted by at least four algorithms were selected. The known HLA-A*0201-restricted carcinoembryonic antigen peptide-1 (CAP-1, YLSGANLNL) was used as a positive control peptide (18) , while the HBcAg-derived HLA-A*2402-restricted peptide HBc117e125 (EYLVSFGVW) was used as a negative control peptide (19) , and all peptides were synthesized using standard 9-fluorenylmethyl-oxycarbonyl chemistry by the Chinese Peptide Company (Hangzhou, China). They were of >95% purity as determined by reverse-phase chromatography and their identity was confirmed by mass spectrometry. The lyophilized peptide powder was dissolved according to the manufacturer's instructions in ultrapure water or in dimethylsulfoxide (BioLegend), diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Invitrogen Life Technologies) to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml and stored in aliquots at -80\u02daC until use.",

T2 cells are TAP-deficient and HLA-A*0201-positive, but due to the poor stability of non-peptide-loaded HLA-A*0201 molecules, its HLA-A*0201 expression levels on the surface are low. Exogenous peptides are able to induce the accumulation of HLA-A*0201 molecules, and thus, upregulation of HLA-A*0201 molecules on T2 cells may be detected by florescent intensity exchange which reflects peptide binding ability to HLA-A*0201 molecules. Briefly, T2 cells were incubated overnight with peptides (final concentration, 100 \u00b5M) in IMDM serum-free medium containing human \u03b22-microglobulin (final concentration, 3 \u00b5g/ml) in a humidified 26\u02daC incubator with 5% CO 2 .

Three duplicate wells were set to each group and experiments were repeated three times; CAP-1 was used as a positive control, HBc117e125 was used as negative control, and T2 cells without any added peptide was used as a background control. The fluorescence index (FI) was calculated using the following formula: FI = [mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) sample -MFI background ] / MFI backgro und , where MFI background represents the value without peptide. FI>1.5 indicated that the peptide had a high affinity for HLA-A*0201 molecules, 1.0<FI<1.5 indicated that the peptide had moderate affinity for the HLA-A*0201 molecule, and 0.5<FI<1.0 indicated that the peptide had low affinity for the HLA-A*0201 molecule.",

HSCT is the only potential method to cure hematological malignancies, but relapse rates remain high, particularly in patients transplanted during relapse or in second or subsequent remission (28) . Therefore, efforts are required to seek for novel avenues which are tumor-specific and have synergy with current treatment methods; from this viewpoint, therapeutic vaccines against LAAs are an optimal choice. Mounting evidence demonstrated the existence of LAAs (29) ; as most LAAs are not muted, their immunogenicity is often poor; however, at the same time, the immunity evoked by current therapeutic vaccines targeting LAAs is far from optimal. Accordingly, isolating specific components that have immunogenicity and can induce a strong immune response are rational choices for vaccines. Therefore, the most important task in the discovery of cancer vaccines is to identify novel TAAs and their CTL epitopes in order to make additional therapeutic targets available which are closely associated with tumor incidence and progression. Reverse immunology has been commonly used to identify epitopes of LAAs (30) .",

The third event is the assembly of peptides with HLA class I heavy and light chains in the ER for cell surface presentation (34) (35) (36) (37) (38) (39) . Peptides processed and presented through these three steps have the highest potential to be CTL epitopes. In the final step of the in silico analysis, five different popular algorithms were used to further confirm the selected peptides, leading to the final selection of four 9-mer peptides. It is worth mentioning that the aim of the present study was to identify dominant T-cell epitopes. For this, a combined prediction using SYFPEITHI and BIMAS was utilized, resulting in only four peptides, which significantly saved time by narrowing the validation scope. However, this does not indicate that there are only four CTL epitopes within the EPS8 protein sequence; due to stringent restrictions arising from the selection criteria, several potential subdominant epitopes may have been ignored. BIMAS and SYFPEITHY are based on the principle of binding motifs/quantitative matrices (39) , and in spite of numerous novel algorithms that have emerged, they remain to be commonly used in current studies. The main reason for this may be the large dataset they comprise, which is important, as most predictions are dataset-driven -the bigger the dataset, the more accurate the prediction. One weakness of the motifs or quantitative matrices is the ignorance of the contribution of the overall peptide structure to binding. To overcome the limitations of motif-based predictions, more powerful methods based on tools including ANN, PSSM, SMM and SVMHC were used. It was reported that a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 80% can be achieved with ANN (40) . Together with proteasomal cleavages and TAP translocation prediction, it was speculated that the anchor residues of selected peptides could chemically complement the main pockets of the peptide-binding groove of the HLA molecule.",

Their binding affinity to the HLA-A*0201 molecule was evaluated using the TAP-deficient cell line T2. When exogenous peptides were added, the HLA-A*0201 molecule on the surface of T2 accumulated, resulting in a change in fluorescent intensity, which changes in the MFI reflecting their binding affinity to the HLA-A*0201 molecule. Of the four peptides, peptide 455 and 360 had the highest affinity to the HLA-A*0201 molecule, while peptide 276 and 92 had a relatively low binding affinity to the HLA-A*0201 molecule.

Following the identification of the CTL epitopes, the present study assessed the peptide/MHC complex stability by using the BFA decay assay. BFA inhibits protein synthesis in cultured cells and reversibly inhibits the intracellular translocation of proteins to the cell surface for secretion or expression (46, 47) ; therefore, the accumulated complex remained stable on the cells. When peptide-pulsed T2 cells were continuously cultured in the presence of BFA at 37\u02daC, their MFI on the cells decreased, the peptide/HLA-A*0201 molecule complex dissociated naturally, and DC 50 -values indicated that the 455 and 360/HLA-A*0201 molecule complexes were more stable than those of peptide 276 and peptide 92.

Three tumor cell lines and T2 were selected as target cells.

            "text": "In the present study it was observed that peptide binding affinity and peptide/HLA complex stability did not correlate well with their intensity of immunogenicity; for example, irrespective of its low affinity or complex stability with HLA-A*0201 molecule, the relatively weak binder peptide 92 stimulated PBMCs more strongly to secret the highest amount of IFN-\u03b3 than the strong binder peptide 455, which stimulated the least amount of IFN-\u03b3 secretion by the PBMCs. At the same time, compared to the mean lysis rates of CTLs induced by other peptides, the mean lysis rate of peptide 92-induced CTLs was the highest to MCF-7 and T2 pulsed with corresponding peptide. The reason of this may be based on the interaction dynamics of the T-cell receptor (TCR)-peptide/MHC complex, which is closely associated with T-cell activation and subsequently its differential fate (49) . There is a physiological affinity range, which is optimal to activate T-cells, and a plateau of T-cell functional activity above a defined affinity threshold has been reported, suggesting that all clustered TCRs will be occupied above the defined threshold, and further increases in affinity do not contribute to T-cell functions; therefore, above a defined threshold, TCRs with higher avidity may not be at an advantage over lower-avidity TCRs in the exertion of cytotoxic function (50) . Furthermore, negative feedback mechanisms, including programmed death 1 and lymphocyte activation gene-3 (CD223), would further curtail the potency of high-avidity TCRs (51) (52) (53) . The discrepancy observed in the present study may be ascribed to the peptide affinity of high-affinity binding peptides above the defined affinity threshold. Another reason may be the supra-optimal antigen dose. Evidence suggested that culturing of CTLs in vitro in the presence of high-or low-dose antigen leads to polarization of low-and high-avidity responses, respectively (54, 55) . In regard to low-or intermediate-affinity peptides, the peptide dose used for CTL induction in the present study may have been supra-optimal for high-affinity peptides, with the optimal TCR stimulation peptide dose for maintenance of high-avidity T cells ex vivo being 1 ng/ml and resulting in retained avidity, proliferation and ability to kill specific targets. By contrast, the supra-optimal TCR stimulation peptide dose (10 \u00b5g/ml peptide) for high-avidity T-cell maintenance ex vivo resulted in reduced avidity and failure to kill tumor cells (56) . The present study highlights the importance of optimal stimulation for the induction and maintenance of high-avidity CTL. Due to certain limitations, the present study did not further explore the best affinity to HLA molecules, which is in favor of peptide-specific CTL induction and maintenance.",

Second, background signals of target cells that lacked tumor antigens or restriction were observed, implying that non-specific killing effects still existed. The reason for this may be ascribed to the use of bulk CTL instead of CD8+ T cell from the colon as effectors. Furthermore, CD8+ T cells were not sorted from PBMCs for CTL induction at the beginning and designated antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells (DCs) were not used; this may have resulted in inadequate antigen processing and presentation. Despite these drawbacks, from an economic and practical point of view, the methods used in the present study are an economical and rapid method for epitope validation. Furthermore, total PBMCs include a variety of cell types, including monocytes and DCs, which can be used as antigen-presenting cells (APC) (57) .",

They had good binding affinity for the HLA-A*0201 molecule and their peptide/HLA-A*0201 complex stability was high. At the same time, these peptides promoted lymphocyte proliferation, and their specific CTLs responded to the corresponding peptides and secreted IFN-\u03b3. They were also able to recognize and lyse ESP8-expressing target tumor cells in an HLA-A*0201-restricted manner, and they were naturally processed and presented on tumor cells. Among them, peptide 92 was the most promising as an antigenic epitope to target tumor cells due to its higher immunogenicity. Future studies will be required to investigate the clinical utility of the identified epitopes by using blood samples from patients with hematological malignancies.",
