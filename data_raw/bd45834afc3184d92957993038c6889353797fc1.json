            "text": "Zika virus (ZIKV), a member of the Flaviviridae family, is the most recent emerging arbovirus with pandemic potential. During infection, viruses trigger the host cell stress response, leading to changes in RNA translation and the assembly of large aggregates of stalled translation preinitiation complexes, termed stress granules (SGs). Several reports demonstrate that flaviviruses modulate the assembly of stress granules (SG). As an emerging pathogen, little is known however about how ZIKV modulates the host cell stress response. In this work, we investigate how ZIKV modulates SG assembly. We demonstrate that ZIKV negatively impacts SG assembly under oxidative stress conditions induced by sodium arsenite (Ars), a treatment that leads to the phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1. By contrast, no measurable difference in SG assembly was observed between mock and ZIKV-infected cells treated with sodium selenite (Se) or Pateamine A (PatA), compounds that trigger eIF2\u03b1-independent SG assembly. Interestingly, ZIKV infection markedly impaired the phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 triggered in Ars-treated infected cells, and the abrogation of SG assembly in ZIKV-infected cells is, at least in part, dependent on eIF2\u03b1 dephosphorylation. These data demonstrate that ZIKV elicits mechanisms to counteract host anti-viral stress responses to promote a cellular environment propitious for viral replication.",

            "text": "Zika virus (ZIKV) is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the genus Flavivirus of the family Flaviviridae, which also includes yellow fever (YFV), West Nile (WNV), dengue (DENV) and Japanese encephalitis viruses (JEV) [1] . The genome of ZIKV encodes a large polyprotein precursor that is co-and post-translationally processed by viral and cellular proteases into three structural proteins [capsid (C), precursor of membrane (prM), and envelope (E)] and seven nonstructural proteins [(NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B and NS5)] that are involved in virus replication, which takes place in the cytoplasm of the host cell [2] . Like other Flavivirus members, ZIKV relies mainly on arthropods such as mosquitoes or ticks for transmission and thus is classified as an arthropod-borne virus (arbovirus). The main arthropod vectors of ZIKV are Aedes sp. mosquitoes (A. aegypti or A. albopictus) [3] . Along with the vector-borne transmission, other routes of ZIKV transmission have been demonstrated, including sexual transmission, transplacental and perinatal transmission and blood transfusion [4] , raising the concern about the global spread of the disease. ZIKV was first isolated from a rhesus monkey in the Zika Forest (Uganda) in 1947 [5] . For more than 50 years, ZIKV was rarely reported to cause disease in humans and was commonly associated with mild illness. In 2007, there was an outbreak in the Federated States of Micronesia [6] , followed by outbreaks in French Polynesia in 2013-14, in which severe neurological complications were reported [7] . Since then, ZIKV is considered to be the most recent emerging arbovirus with pandemic potential [8] . In 2015, autochthonous transmission of ZIKV was confirmed in the northeastern region of Brazil [9] . A dramatic increase in reported cases of microcephaly in the affected Brazilian regions suggested an association between ZIKV infection and fetal malformations [10] and neurological disorders in adults, including Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome and meningoencephalitis [11] . In February 2016, the World Health Organization declared a public health emergency of international concern regarding neurological disorders associated with the rapid emergence of ZIKV in Oceania and the Americas [12] .",

            "text": "In response to conditions of environmental stress, eukaryotic cells activate kinases (HRI, GCN2, PKR and PERK) that phosphorylate eIF2\u03b1 (eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha) to ease cellular injury or, alternatively, to induce apoptosis. Phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 reduces global translation by impairing the formation of the ternary complex eIF2-GTP-tRNA Met , allowing cells to conserve resources and to initiate a reconfiguration of gene expression to effectively manage stress conditions [13] . Protein synthesis arrest triggers the assembly of stress granules (SG), that are large ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) aggregates formed by stalled translation preinitiation complexes [14, 15] . The major components of SG are untranslated mRNAs, eukaryotic translation initiation factors (eIF4E, eIF4G, eIF4A, eIF2), the 40S ribosomal subunit and RNAbinding proteins such as the poly(A) binding protein (PABP), T-cell intracellular antigen 1 (TIA-1), TIA-1-related protein (TIAR), and Ras GTPase activating protein-binding protein 1 (G3BP1) [16] . Distinct cell host processes are interrupted or co-opted during viral infection, leading to the activation of cell stress responses on many levels. SG assembly lowers the cytosolic availability of components of the cellular translation machinery and functions as a platform that connects stress and antiviral innate responses, implying an overall antagonistic relationship between viruses and SGs [17] . In this sense, viruses have evolved a plethora of strategies to guarantee their replication by preventing or blocking SG assembly in infected cells, for example by co-opting RNA granule factors and/or blockage of activation of eIF2\u03b1 kinases, such as PKR [18] .",

Ars is an oxidative agent that rapidly induces SG assembly through phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 [31] . SG assembly was determined by indirect immunofluorescence of TIAR and eIF4G and infected cells were identified by the presence of the viral protein NS1. In the absence of stress, mock-infected (blue arrows) and ZIKV-infected cells (red arrows) exhibited SG assembly at a rate of 0.61% and 0%, respectively (Fig 2A, top panels and Fig 2B) , indicating that ZIKV infection does not induce the assembly of SG. In mock-infected cells, Ars treatment induced abundant SG assembly as expected, with 81.4% of the cells presenting TIAR and eIF4G co-localized in cytoplasmic puncta (Fig 2A and 2B ). In contrast, ZIKV infected cells presented SG at a rate of only 21.6% (Fig 2A, bottom panel and Fig 2B) . Similar results were observed when U2OS cells were used in place of Vero cells (S1 Fig).

For example, coronaviruses can induce GADD34 expression to enhance PP1 activity and consequently the dephosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 [34], and herpesviruses encode a viral protein that mimics the function of GADD34 [35] . We examined the phosphorylation status of eIF2\u03b1 in ZIKV infected untreated or Ars treated cells. Protein lysates were analyzed by Western blotting using an antibody specific for eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation at S51. As shown in Fig 4A and 4B , little phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 was detected in mock-infected and untreated Vero cells, with a slight increase in p-eIF2\u03b1 in ZIKV-infected cells. As expected, high levels of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation (40-fold increase) were observed in extracts of mock-infected cells treated with Ars. However, in ZIKV-infected and Ars treated cells, levels of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation were ZIKV recruits TIAR to sites of viral RNA replication. Vero cells were infected with ZIKV with an MOI of 0.5 and A. at 24 hpi, cells were treated with Actinomycin D and the nascent viral RNA was labeled with BrUTP and detected by immunofluorescence/laser scanning confocal microscopy (IF/LSCM) using a 40X objective lens; B. at 24 hpi, cells were fixed and the viral protein NS1 was detected by immunofluorescence followed by confocal microscopy.

ZIKV replication was confirmed by the detection of the viral protein NS1 in cell extracts. The amount of total eIF2\u03b1 was similar under all conditions tested (Fig 4A) , indicating that ZIKV replication does not alter its expression. To further confirm that ZIKV-infected cells exhibit lower levels of p-eIF2\u03b1 under arsenite treatment, phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 was also analyzed by IF/LSCM. As shown in Fig 4C, phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 is strongly induced in the cytoplasm of non-infected cells (blue arrows). In contrast, in ZIKVinfected cells, the phospho-eIF2\u03b1 signal is visibly weaker (red arrow). Upon arsenite treatment, the fluorescence intensity of p-eIF2\u03b1 in infected cells was in average 30% lower in ZIKV-infected cells in comparison to mock-infected cells (Fig 4D) .

Our results show that are GADD34 levels are significantly higher in ZIKV-infected cells as compared to uninfected cells (Fig 6A and 6B) . To evaluate the role of GADD34/PP1A activity on ZIKV-infected cells, we treated cells with salubrinal and its derivative sal003, small molecules that selectively inhibit the PP1/GADD34-mediated dephosphorylation of phospho-eIF2\u03b1 [36, 37] . Vero cells were treated with 75 \u03bcM of salubrinal or 10 \u03bcM of sal003 for 3 h prior to the addition of Ars to the cells. The phosphorylation status of eIF2\u03b1 was evaluated by western blotting analysis (Fig 6C) . In cells treated with salubrinal prior to Ars-induced stress, ZIKV-infected cells present higher levels of phospho-eIF2\u03b1 as compared to mock-infected control (Fig 6C, compare lanes 6 and 8) . Similar results were obtained with sal003 [37] (S2 Fig). The assembly of SG in the distinct conditions was monitored by indirect immunofluorescence. SGs were induced in 23.1\u00b16.5% of ZIKV-infected cells treated with Ars. This value increased to 47.8\u00b17.0% in cells that were treated with salubrinal prior to Ars-induced stress and was not significantly different from mock-infected cells (Fig 6D and 6E ). No significant difference was observed between control or salubrinal pre-presence of the viral protein NS1. Blue arrows: uninfected cells; red arrows: infected cells. B.

In this process, viruses trigger the host cell stress response, which can lead to the assembly of SGs [17] . Since viral replication relies on the host translational machinery, most viruses suppress the stress response pathway and SG assembly at some point of their replicative cycle [18] .

This contrasts with the results recently published by Roth and colleagues [19] that describe the assembly of SG-like structures on Huh-7 cells infected with ZIKV. It is possible that those distinct findings are due to the usage of distinct cell lines. In our work, we also show that ZIKV and blocks SG assembly triggered by treatment of cells with Ars (Fig 2) and DTT (Fig 5) . These finds are similar to the ones described recently by Roth and colleagues, in which they describe that flaviviruses block SG assembly independently of the eIF2\u03b1 kinase activated by stress [19] .

Several reports have shown that members of the Flaviviridae family modulate SG assembly in infected cells. The 3' stem loop from the viral minus strand of WNV and DENV captures TIA-1 and TIAR to promote viral genome RNA synthesis and inhibit SG assembly [29, 41] . JEV capsid protein interaction with Caprin-1 leads to the sequestration of several SG components, such as G3BP1 and USP10, in the perinuclear region of infected cells, resulting in impairment of SG assembly [30] and bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) blocks Ars-mediated SG assembly [42] . TIA1 and TIAR are recruited to tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) sites of replication [43] . Finally, hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication leads to oscillating SG assembly/disassembly in infected cells through controlling the phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 and co-opting TIA-1, TIAR and G3BP1 [44, 45] . More recently, Roth and colleagues [19] demonstrated that DENV and ZIKV uncouple translation suppression from the stress response by a mechanism that is yet to be identified.",

The assembly of SG triggered by both molecules is independent of the phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1, suggesting that ZIKV blocks stress granules assembly mainly via eIF2\u03b1 signaling. Interestingly, this does not seem to be a general feature of flaviviral infections, as it has been demonstrated by Roth and colleagues that DENV inhibits SG assembly induced by hippuristanol, an inhibitor of eIF4A RNA binding [19] . The phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 is a key regulator of mRNA translation initiation, and the level of phospho-eIF2\u03b1 is modulated by the activities of kinases and phosphatases [46] . Oxidative stress induced by Ars culminates on eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation by HRI [31], which prevents the recycling of the eIF2-GTP-tRNA Met ternary complex, leading to polysome disassembly and consequent translational arrest and SG assembly [14] .",

Our results show that ZIKV attenuates eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation triggered by Ars (Fig 4) and DTT ( Fig 5) and this ability is, at least in part, a consequence of modulating its dephosphorylation, as supported by the observation that treatment of cells with salubrinal reverses the ZIKVmediated blockage of SG assembly induced by Ars (Fig 6) . Similar to the finding of Wang and colleagues using coronavirus [34], we demonstrated that ZIKV infection induces a moderate increase in GADD34 expression (Fig 6A and 6B) . Recently, Buchman and colleagues [47] described a mechanism by which trehalose modulates p-eIF2\u03b1 levels and stress granule assembly/disassembly by enhancing the expression of GADD34 and CReP. The increase in the cellular levels of the PP1 phosphatase subunits could lead to faster dephosphorylation of p-eIF2\u03b1 and disassembly of SGs, thereby rendering the cells able to recover more quickly from stress. It is possible that the enhanced levels of GADD34 found in ZIKV-infected cells play a similar role in response to stress.",

ICP34.5 is a protein homologous to GADD34 encoded by HSV that is essential for HSV replication in some cell types. It binds cellular PP1 and promotes eIF2\u03b1 dephosphorylation, ensuring viral replication despite activation of PKR [35] . Treatment of HSV-infected cells with salubrinal inhibits viral replication in a dose-dependent manner and leads to higher phospho-eIF2\u03b1 levels [36, 52] . Similarly, our results demonstrate that ZIKV replication is severely impaired in salubrinal-treated cells (Fig 7) , indicating that ZIKV relies to some extent on eIF2\u03b1 dephosphorylation for its replication. These findings are distinct from the model proposed by Roth and colleagues [19] , in which modulation of SG assembly in ZIKV-infected cells was independent of eIF2\u03b1 dephosphorylation promoted by elevated GADD34 levels.

This ability may reflect one of the many strategies that ZIKV has evolved to control the host stress response and demonstrate that ZIKV elicits mechanisms to counteract host anti-viral stress responses to promote a cellular environment propitious for viral replication. Elucidation of the interaction of viral components with host factors involved in SG assembly may provide new insights into the pathology of ZIKV infection and lead to the identification of novel targets for therapeutic intervention.",

The SG markers G3BP-1 and eIF4G were observed by IF/ LSCM and infected cells were identified by the presence of the viral protein NS1. Blue arrows: uninfected cells; red arrows: infected cells. B. At least 150 cells in each condition were analyzed. Cells with at least 3 SG were considered positive. Data are presented as mean \u00b1 SD from 3 independent experiments. C. U2OS cells were infected with ZIKV with an MOI of 0.5 or mock-infected and treated at 24 hpi with 500 \u03bcM Ars for 1 h to induce cellular stress. Lysates were analyzed for S51-phospho(P)-eIF2\u03b1 and eIF2\u03b1 (total) by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. B. Densitometry quantification of p-eIF2\u03b1 was determined by ImageJ analysis. Values presented in the graph are normalized against the total amount of eIF2\u03b1 in the cell lysate and represent fold change with the untreated mock-infected cells being arbitrarily set to 1. Asterisks represent the statistically significant difference between mock and ZIKV-infected cells (Two-way ANOVA; p < 0.05) (TIF) S2 Fig. eIF2\u03b1 dephosphorylation modulated by ZIKV is inhibited by sal003. Vero cells were infected with ZIKV or mock-infected and treated at 24 hpi with 10 \u03bcM sal003 for 3 h to block the dephosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 and then treated with 500 \u03bcM Ars for 1 h to induce cellular stress. Lysates were analyzed for S51-phospho(P)-eIF2\u03b1 and eIF2\u03b1 (total) by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting.
