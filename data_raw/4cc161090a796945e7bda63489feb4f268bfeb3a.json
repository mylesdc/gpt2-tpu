Co-immunoprecipitation analysis showed that the NCAM was a binding partner of spike protein. neurons, glia, skeletal muscle and natural killer cells [20] . NCAM is a member of the immunoglobulin supergene family of Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) [21] . CAMs play important roles in cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions in both mature and developing nervous system [22] . During development, they are involved in cell migration, axon guidance, target recognition, and synapse formation; while in the mature nervous system, they maintain synaptic connections, cellcell contacts, and neuron-glial interactions [22] . Injuries to the nervous systems break the stable state of the tissues and the repair of damaged tissues and regeneration of axons require the participation of CAMs both as adhesion molecules and as signal transduction molecules [22] . NCAM has been implicated as having a role in cell-cell adhesion, neurite outgrowth, synaptic plasticity, and learning and memory [23, 24] . There is evidence that PHE-CoV is disseminated throughout the central nervous system by direct transfer of virus from neuron to neuron [25] . Thus, by binding to NCAM, the PHE-",

CoV might increase the probability of gaining access form peripheral nervous system to the central nervous system. Affected piglets show the clinical symptoms such as generalized muscle trembling, abnormal walking, lack of co-ordination, ears held back, convulsions and lying on the side and paddling legs. If PHE-CoV bind to NCAM, certain aspects of the clinical symptoms may be readily explained. NCAM is expressed in the surface of developing muscle with a spatiotemporal pattern that is consistent with a role in neuromuscular junction (NMJ) formation [26] . Only NCAM of the CAMs appears on the surface of muscle cells in parallel with the ability of the muscle cell surface to accept synapses [27] . Levels of NCAM in muscle are regulated in parallel with the susceptibility of muscle to innervation. NCAM-induced sprouting is thought to be induced via homophilic binding between NCAMs in the neural and the muscle surfaces, that in turn induces growth promoting mechanisms in the nerve process [26] .",

HcoV-OC43, BCV and PHE-CoV recognize sialic acid-containing receptors similar to those of influenza C viruses [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] . Polysialic acid (PSA) is a developmentally regulated carbohydrate composed of a linear homopolymer of a-2,8-linked sialic acid residues [33] . NCAM undergoes post-translational modification during development, leading to the abundant addition of PSA chains on its extracellular domain [34] . PSA on NCAM is developmentally regulated thus playing a prominent role in different forms of neural plasticity spanning from embryonic to adult nervous system, including axonal growth, outgrowth and fasciculation, cell migration, synaptic plasticity, activity-induced plasticity, neuronal-glial plasticity, embryonic and adult neurogenesis [35] .",

            "text": "The entry of coronaviruses is a multi-step process that involve: docking on the plasma membrane, binding to a receptor or co-receptors and delivery of the viral genome into the host cell. Docking of viruses on the plasma membrane of a susceptible cell is the first step during virus entry. Docking involves non-specific interactions between the viral envelope protein and carbohydrate moieties like heparan sulfate or sialic acid on the surface of cells. These initial docking interactions may lead to Table 3 Oligonucleotides for siRNA construction concentration of virus at the plasma membrane of a susceptible cell that in turn may enhance the infectivity of the virus by facilitating the interactions of the envelope protein with a cellular receptor that promotes virus entry. Reovirus strains that have sialic acid-binding activity attach to cells with 5-fold more avidity than strains that do not bind sialic acid, and their infectivity is enhanced 50-100 fold [36] . After docking at the surface of a susceptible cell, the virus binds a receptor molecule(s) that in turn triggers conformational changes that result in virus entry. We speculate that the entry of PHE-CoV is a multi-step process. The Hemagglutininesterase (HE) protein of PHE-CoV binds to polysialic acid (PSA) moieties, while the spike (S) protein of PHE-CoV binds to NCAM at the plasma. Additionally, porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis is an infectious disease affecting mainly pigs under 3 weeks old [37] . During the embryonic development of the brain, NCAM undergoes posttranslational modifications leading to the addition of a-2,8-polysialic acid (PSA) chains on its extracellular domain [38] . This embryonic highly PSA-NCAM is expressed abundantly throughout the brain until early postnatal period and is involved in neurite extension and synaptogenesis [38] . In the adult brain, however, PSA-NCAM expression is considerably reduced, although it has been shown to be expressed in certain areas (e.g. the olfactory bulb and hippocampus) [34] .",

In addition, it is likely that a cell line approved for vaccine production, and one that is made permissive for viral replication through expression of NCAM, will be the most efficient largescale producer of whole-killed or attenuated virus for use as a vaccine. There are a number of chronic neurologic diseases, such as myasthenia gravis, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, and Alzheimer's disease, for which some evidence of viral etiology exists [39] . One explanation for these diseases is that after a virus binds to a cellular constituent acting as a receptor, the receptor might be altered. Identification of the specific neuronal constituents to which neurotropic viruses bind will allow for an analysis of the potential effects of these interactions on functional or antigenic alterations of receptors [40] .",
