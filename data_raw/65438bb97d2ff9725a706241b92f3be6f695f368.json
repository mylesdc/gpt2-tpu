Conversely, far less attention has been paid to pathogen transmission from domestic animals to wildlife. Here, we focus on the case of game restocking, which implies the release of millions of animals worldwide each year. We conducted a 2year study in the Camargue (Southern France) to investigate the influence of hand-reared Mallard releases on avian influenza virus dynamics in surrounding wildlife. We sampled Mallards (cloacal swabs) from several game duck facilities in 2009 and 2010 before their release. A very high (99%) infection rate caused by an H10N7 strain was detected in the game bird facility we sampled in 2009. We did not detect this strain in shot ducks we sampled, neither during the infection rates ranged from 0 to 24% in hand-reared ducks. The 2009 H10N7 strain was fully sequenced. It results from multiple reassortment events between Eurasian low pathogenic strains. Interestingly, H10N7 strains had previously caused human infections in Egypt and Australia. The H10 and N7 segments we sequenced were clearly distinct from the Australian ones but they belonged to the same large cluster as the Egyptian ones. We did not observe any mutation linked to increased virulence, transmission to mammals, or antiviral resistance in the H10N7 strain we identified. Our results indicate that the potential role of hand-reared Mallards in influenza virus epizootics must be taken into account given the likely risk of viral exchange between game bird facilities and wild habitats, owing to duck rearing conditions. Measures implemented to limit transmission from wildlife to domestic animals as well as measures to control transmission from domestic animals to wild ones need to be equally reinforced.",

Indeed, approximately 80% of the infectious diseases that recently emerged were zoonotic [2] . The role of wildlife in emerging pathogen transmission to humans and domestic animals has in many cases been pointed out [3\u00b15] . Conversely, pathogen transmission from domestic animals to wildlife has received far less attention, although the importance of this issue was often mentioned [6, 7] . Indeed, contacts between wildlife and livestock or their environment sometimes result in wildlife diseases with conservation issues [8, 9] . Besides, handreared animal releases into the wild for either conservation or exploitation purposes represent a particular case in which handreared individuals eventually share natural habitats with their wild congeners. In both cases such releases can dramatically influence disease dynamics in the surrounding wild animal populations [ 10\u00b1 14] .",

Birds are the most frequently involved, with millions of individuals being released annually in Europe only. For example more than 3 millions red-legged partridges are released annually in Spain [15] , and ca. 1.4 million Mallards are being so in France [16] . The Camargue region, a complex network of wetlands situated in the Rhone delta, is a major duck winter quarter [17] and a central place for wildfowl hunting in France [18] . Hunting is also among the most important economic activities in the area, which is one of the reasons for the massive Mallard releases in the Camargue [19] . At least 30 000 hand-reared individuals are released annually in the region [20] . Maximum Mallard numbers in the wild are reached in September after the beginning of the hunting season, with 56 500 individuals on average over the last seven years (Gauthier-Clerc, unpubl. data), these numbers certainly include a mixing of wild and released Mallards. Given its central position on the flyway of many European migratory species, the Camargue is also a potential hotspot for the introduction and transmission of bird-borne pathogens [21] .",

            "text": "For this reason, avian influenza viruses (AIV) have been studied since 2004 in the area. These negative-sense single stranded RNA viruses belonging to the Orthomyxoviridae family are commonly characterized by the combination of their surface proteins: hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) [22, 23] . AIVs are highly variable and undergo continuous genetic evolution via two mechanisms: i) accumulation of point mutations at each replication cycle, ii) reassortment involving gene segment exchanges that occur when a cell is co-infected by different viruses [24] . These mechanisms contribute to the emergence of new variants with the ability to transmit to new hosts and/or with epidemic or even pandemic potential. Aquatic birds, particularly Anseriforms (ducks, geese and swans) and Charadriiforms (gulls, terns and shorebirds) constitute their major natural reservoir [23, 25] . The AIV circulating in wild birds are usually low pathogenic ones (LPAIV). LPAIV generally have little impact on their host [26, 27] , although some studies have reported a possible influence on migration capacities [28] . Besides, when LPAIV of H5 or H7 subtypes are transmitted from wild birds to domestic ones reared in artificial environments, their virulence can evolve to high pathogenicity [29, 30] . Highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIV), such as HP H5N1 strains currently circulating in Asia and Africa, are still of great economic concern, notably due to the cost of preventive actions including vaccination and massive birds culling [31] . Moreover, HPAIV infections represent a threat for human health since 603 HPAIV H5N1 human infections including 356 fatal cases have been reported worldwide since 2003 [32] .",

            "text": "To clear this gap we conducted a 2-year study in the Camargue to investigate the potential influence of hand-reared Mallard releases on AIV dynamics in surrounding wildlife. We first hypothesized that, owing to high density rearing conditions and to their genetic uniformity, hand-reared Mallards should be highly susceptible to AIV infections and could play an amplification role in AIV dynamics. This phenomenon has already been pointed out in red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa) reared for hunting in Spain, where Escherichia coli prevalence was much higher in hand-reared populations before their release than in the wild ones [36] . To test this assumption we collected cloacal swabs from Mallards reared for hunting in several game bird facilities (GBF) in 2009 and 2010, and analysed these samples to measure AIV prevalence. Second, we hypothesized that AIV exchange occurs between wild and hand-reared Mallards, potentially leading either to the circulation of new strains in wild populations or to the amplification and dispersal of wild strains. Indeed, no barrier prevents AIV exchange between wild birds and hand-reared ducks in the GBF since water flows exist between pens and ponds used by wild birds. Moreover, as the GBF roofs are made of nets wild birds can deposit feces in the pens. Finally, hand-reared ducks are in direct contact with wild ones after their release. To investigate these issues, we tested shot waterfowl before and after handreared Mallards were sampled. Noteworthy, genetic analyses suggest that 76% of hunted Mallards in the Camargue have a captive origin [37] . Considering the low annual survival of released Mallards (0.8\u00b115.9% depending on the release site) [37] , the individuals we tested from the Camargue hunting bags certainly included a large proportion of ducks released some months before being shot. These released ducks cannot be differentiated morphologically from the wild ones [38] . Here we hence analyzed shot ducks as a whole since they are a representative sample of the Mallard population wintering in the Camargue, which is composed of individuals of both wild and captive origin that share habitats and can thus be considered as a single epidemiological unit.",

Thirdly, we tested for the presence of mutations conferring resistance to common antiviral drugs, since such resistance has recently been recorded in wild birds, notably in Sweden [40] .

Determination of the sequence of the whole genome was performed in order to gain insights into its phylogeny and molecular characteristics. The phylogenetic analysis of four H10N7 Camargue isolates confirmed that they were very closely related to each other and formed a cluster (Figures 1 and S1 ). Analysis of each of the sequences of the 8 viral segments highlighted some shared characteristics (Figures 1 and S1). First, the sequences of all segments were clearly distinct from those of LPAIV strains from the North-American lineage. Second, none were closely related to highly pathogenic viruses (H5N1 or H7N7) that circulated in Europe and Asia. However, the PB2 segment was more closely related to the Asian HP H5N1 cluster than to most of the European LPAIV strains we included in our phylogenetic analysis. This finding suggests an ancient Asian origin of this segment. Third, the sequences of all segments were closely related to Eurasian strains. Interestingly, the most closelyrelated Eurasian strains differed between segments. As an example the LPAIV strain A/mute swan/Hungary/5973/2007 (H7N7) was very closely related to the H10N7 Camargue virus for the N7 segment, but less so for the M segment and belonged to a distant phylogenetic group for the PB2 segment. In the same way, the LPAIV strain A/mallard/Netherlands/9/2005 (H7N7) was closely related to the H10N7 Camargue virus for the M segment, whereas its PB2 segment belonged to a distinct phylogenetic group. African strains that we included in our analysis were part of Eurasian clusters and clearly distinct from American strains. For one of them, A/Pekin duck/South Africa/AI1642/2009 (H10N7) the NS, N7 and H10 sequences were closely related to those of the H10N7 Camargue virus but available sequences of two other segments (NP and M) were clearly distinct. Finally, it is important to note that based on the analysis of partial sequences of the H10 (data not shown) the H10N7 strains that caused human infections in Australia (Genebank accession numbers ADG58106 and ADG58107; Ratnamohan,V.M. and Dwyer, D.E. unpublished) are clearly distinct from the H10N7 Camargue strain. On the contrary Egyptian H10N7 strains that circulated in birds in 2004, i.e. at the time of the detection of two human infections [41] , are relatively closely related to the H10N7 Camargue strain. However, this relatedness is difficult to interpret since the involved nodes are not strongly supported statistically (Figure 1) .",

No known determinants of adaptation to mammals (humans or mice) were detected. In addition, we did not identify any mutation known to be linked with increased virulence in mammals. Yet, we detected the V149A mutation in PB2, which is associated with high virulence in chickens. However, 149A was also observed in low pathogenic H7 strains sampled from wild and domestic ducks in China. This suggests that this mutation alone does not increase the virulence in ducks [42] .

This shows that massive outbreaks can occasionally affect GBF, potentially impacting on AIV dynamics in the wild populations with which hand-reared Mallards are in contact before and after their release into the wild. This pattern has already been highlighted in Spain where rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) restocking caused sarcoptic mange dispersion in the wild rabbit population, leading to massive decrease in numbers [11] . The possible outcomes of GBF infection onto wild duck populations should here depend on the origin of the strain involved. Indeed, low pathogenic AIV strains that naturally circulate in wild ducks have little impact on their health [26] . Our data did not permit to determine the origin of the strain we identified in 2009.

Nevertheless, our sampling effort was limited in time to the hunting seasons: we do not have any data from February to August 2009. We therefore cannot exclude that the H10N7 strain originated from wild birds. Population density during the breeding season is low in wild Mallard [45] , and thus, even if the H10N7 Camargue virus originated from wild birds, hand-reared Mallards would then have played an amplifying role. In addition, commercial trade of Mallard chicks is common and most of the juveniles sampled in this study traveled 600 km from the producer when one-day old. It is also possible that the H10N7 Camargue strain originated from the birthplace of the chicks. If so, domestic ducks would have both played an amplifying role and potentially a dispersal one, since they could have spread a new strain in wild duck populations.",

Furthermore, the lack of large-scale dispersal of that H10N7 strain could be due to different parameters. First, we sampled the hand-reared ducks of the GBF1 21 days before their release. It is possible that only few birds were still excreting viruses when released into the wild, since excretion time in birds can be as short as 2 days (although it can also last up to 30 days in some cases) [46\u00b148]. Second, a parallel capturerecapture demographic study ran in the Camargue has shown that hand-reared Mallards exhibit low monthly survival before the hunting season (only 44% survive from release until the onset of the hunting period on average) [49] . Moreover, their dispersal capacities appear to be very low [49] . The same pattern has been observed for red-legged partridges released in Spain [13] . Although intestinal parasites were much more numerous in the individuals living in the hunting estates where domestic birds were released, this was interestingly not observed in the neighboring estates [13] . It is possible that the poor survival and low dispersal of the hand-reared Mallards after release limited the potential spread of the H10N7 Camargue virus within the Mallard population in the wild.",

Again we could not highlight any AIV exchange between ducks living in captivity and in the wild. Yet, hand-reared ducks are exposed to wild bird feces and GBF are connected to wild bird habitats through common use of water. Thus, AIV exchanges are very likely to exist. Our results highlighted that: i) GBF represent an epidemiological compartment into which important AIV outbreaks can occur; ii) a significant proportion of Mallards wintering in the Camargue are infected by LPAIV, including H5 strains that are known to be able to evolve to HPAIV in domestic birds [30] . Knowing that rearing conditions in the GBF may favor AIV exchanges between wild and hand-reared Mallards, these findings outline the need for influenza surveillance in GBF to prevent HPAIV outbreaks in both wild and domestic birds in the region.",

            "text": "We used the phylogenetical analysis of whole-genome sequence of the H10N7 Camargue strain as a supplementary tool to get insights into its evolutionary and geographical origins. The four isolates studied clearly belonged to a cluster that did not include other strains. The infections we detected were therefore certainly due to a single introduction event. All the viral segments of the H10N7 Camargue strain belong to the Eurasiatic lineage also including African strains. The sequences of the extremities of the N7 segment, that exhibit features characteristic of the Eurasian lineage viruses, confirmed this finding. The Eurasian lineage is clearly distinct from the American lineage and our observations further support the fact that inter-hemispheric AIV exchanges are rare. The Camargue strain was also distinct from the H10N7 viruses that previously caused human infections in Australia, but belonged to the same large cluster as the Egyptian H10N7 strains that circulated in birds when H10N7 human infections occurred in this country. These Egyptian strains did not cause severe disease. Nevertheless, this information raises concern about a possible transmission to humans of strains such as the Camargue one, in particular to the GBF owners and hunters who live in close contact with ducks. Interestingly, the strains that are genetically closest relatives differ for each segment of the H10N7 Camargue strain. The Camargue strain thus seems to result from multiple reassortments between different Eurasiatic strains, a common phenomenon which has been illustrated by many studies [50, 51] . Regrettably, we could not determine if the H10N7 Camargue strain was more closely related to strains observed in the wild or in GBF. Indeed, the data associated with viral sequences from AIV infected Mallards in GenBank are often too scarce to determine if the sample was taken on a wild or a domestic individual. This underlines the need for more detailed information on AIV sequences included in common databases.",

Our results do not support this assumption. The sequences of the studied segments presented typical avian characteristics. No mutation known to contribute to transmission to humans was detected. Moreover, the Camargue strain is a low pathogenic one like all viruses isolated during our research program in the Camargue since 2005 [33, 52] . No mutation conferring antiviral resistance was detected. This analysis therefore failed to highlight any risk factor linked to this particular strain. Yet, one must keep in mind that we only looked for mutations previously described in the literature, while many others may remain undiscovered so far. It is also important to stress that most experimental studies focusing on mutations modifying host specificity and virulence are carried out on chicken, although it has been demonstrated that phenotypic outcomes of a given mutation can greatly differ from one host species to another [42] .",

            "text": "In conclusion, our results point out the important role that could be played by hand-reared ducks released for hunting in AIV dynamics. As we did not detect similar AIV strains in shot and hand-reared ducks we could not prove that AIV exchanges exist between these two epidemiological compartments. Yet, due to rearing conditions in GBF, AIV exchange risks seem to be high enough to urge for sanitary control of hand-reared animals prior to their release into the wild, which appears to be highly insufficient so far. Such surveillance would also prevent HPAIV circulation that may arise from the evolution in GBF of H5 LPAIV that proved to be commonly infecting free-living ducks in the Camargue. The world organization for animal health (OIE) stresses that surveillance of AIV infection should be applied to all domesticated birds including those used``for restocking supplies of game'' [53] , but control measures generally appear to be poor in game bird rearing estates. This surveillance gap has recently been highlighted in the USA, where game bird holders reported very variable sanitary practices [54] . The problem appears similar in Europe, including France. Additionally, according to French law, game birds should be ringed to allow for the differentiation of wild and released individuals [55] . Most of GBF owners ignore this obligation. If released birds were clearly identified the specific role they may have in AIV dynamics could be addressed both before and after their release. Our study illustrates the reality of the epidemiological consequences that can result from surveillance gaps and the knowledge that could be gained if released individuals were recognizable. Sharing knowledge and strictly controlling viral exchanges between wild birds and all kinds of domestic ones represent major steps to anticipate and face HPAIV epizootics.",

Using a network of hunters, 299 and 552 samples were taken on locally shot Mallards during the 2008/2009 and 2009/2010 hunting seasons (September to January), respectively. Samples were collected on hand-reared Mallards during the pre-release ringing sessions of these birds in one GBF in 2009 and 4 GBF (including the one sampled in 2009) in 2010. Ducks were juveniles (5 to 10 weeks old), reared in open-air and released immediately or within a few days or weeks after sampling",
