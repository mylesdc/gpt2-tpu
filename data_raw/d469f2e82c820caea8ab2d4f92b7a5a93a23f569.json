Medical charts of all the 193 patients who died (cases) and the 386 randomly selected patients who recovered (controls) were investigated in 177 hospitals. Household interviews were conducted with those who had survived and the closest relative of those who had died. 73.6% of cases and 38.1% of controls were at risk of developing influenza-related complications. The 18-to-59-year age group (OR = 2.31, 95%CI: 1.31-4.10 (reference up to 18 years of age)), presence of risk conditions for severity of influenza (OR = 1.99, 95%CI: 1.11-3.57, if one or OR = 6.05, 95%CI: 2.76-13.28, if more than one), obesity (OR = 2.73, 95%CI: 1.28-5.83), immunosuppression (OR = 3.43, 95%CI: 1.28-9.19), and search for previous care associated with the hospitalization (OR = 3.35, 95%CI: 1.75-6.40) were risk factors for death. Antiviral treatment performed within 72 hours of the onset of symptoms (OR = 0.17, 95%CI: 0.08-0.37, if within 48hours, and OR = 0.30, 95%CI: 0.11-0.81, if between 48 and 72 hours) was protective against death. The identification of high-risk patients and early treatment are important factors for reducing morbi-mortality from influenza.",

The following data were collected: previous pathological history, occurrence of pregnancy, health care, symptomatology during admission, laboratory and radiological tests, need for ICU admission, treatment, complications and disease progression. The International Classification of Diseases, 10 th revision-ICD-10, was used for coding comorbidities indicated in the medical charts. The Ministry of Health provided the antiviral drug known as Oseltamivir for treatment during the pandemic. The protocol for clinical management established that the treatment was for cases hospitalized with SARI and ambulatory patients with risk conditions for severity. Treatment should be started within 48hours after symptom onset. All patients studied had laboratory confirmations of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 from respiratory secretion samples analyzed using the RT-PCR method, performed by the Adolfo Lutz Institute [16] . The definition of SARI included: fever associated with cough and dyspnea; pneumonia; respiratory insufficiency; tachypnea; radiological changes compatible with pneumonia; oxygen therapy or mechanical ventilation.

Variables with p-value < 0.20 in the univariate analysis and adjustment variables were selected for the multiple logistic regression, which used forward stepwise strategy. The model including all patients assessed the following dichotomous categorical variables: health insurance, previous care, vaccination against influenza in 2009, sex (reference category = male); and the following risk conditions: diabetes mellitus, obesity, chronic kidney disease, chronic liver disease, immunosuppression, chronic cardiovascular disease, chronic neurological disease and delay in development, using the absence of a condition as a reference category. The model also assessed: age group [<18 years (reference), 18 to 59 years, 60 years], use of antiviral therapy [no use (reference category), 48 hours after the onset of symptoms, > 48 and 72 hours, > 72 hours], high-risk individuals or those with any of the risk conditions listed above adapted from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-CDC [18] [no condition (reference category), one condition, and two or more conditions], and time between onset of symptoms and admission in days as the continuous variable. The model was controlled for epidemiologic week of admission at hospital (categorized as EW26-28 (reference), EW29-31 and EW31-34), and income. A second model was developed with patients aged 18 years and over, which also assessed level of education [without formal education or incomplete primary education, complete primary education, complete secondary education, complete higher education (reference category)] and occupational risk [very high and high, average and low (reference category)]. Patients aged 18 to 22 years with incomplete higher education were included in reference category of education. For the modelling, patients with no occupation were included in the reference category of occupational risk. Significance of variables was assessed by Wald test and adjustment of models by Hosmer-Lemeshow test.",

Some studies have analyzed risk factors for severity of the disease and deaths, comparing patients hospitalized in ICUs and in wards [13, 14, [20] [21] [22] [23] , whereas one study used the rate of mortality from influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 in two epidemic waves [24] . A study conducted in Australia analyzed risk factors for hospitalization due to influenza, comparing cases with controls without infection in the community [25] . Other studies have analyzed epidemiological surveillance data, including mortality rates and comparisons among deaths, hospitalizations, treatment and other factors [9, 10, 12, [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] . Some of the factors associated with death identified in this study have been described by other authors, such as the presence of comorbidities [31, 35] , age18years [13] , obesity [15, 19, 20] , neurological and developmental diseases [23, 24, 31] and immunosuppression [15, 21, 24, 34] . Children showed lower risk of death, despite a similar proportion of treatment than adults. A similar result was observed in a study of systematic review and metaanalysis, where the risk of death was 0.28 (95% CI 0.19-0.141), when compared to young adults [36] . In contrast, other factors associated with severity of infection that have been reported by different researchers, such as diabetes [19, 34] ; other chronic pulmonary diseases, excluding asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [20] ; chronic pulmonary disease, including asthma [31] ; and chronic cardiovascular disease [21, 24, 34] , were not associated with mortality in the present study. The population assessed, which was restricted to hospitalized patients with severe influenza could at least partly explain these differences. Diabetes, chronic cardiovascular and kidney disease, associated with death in univariate analysis, did not remain risk factors after multiple analysis. The design of this study, with data collected on medical charts and household interviews, allowed for adjustments in the analysis that can also explain part of these differences.",

Underreporting of SARI by health professionals is likely to have occurred, as reporting this disease was not compulsory in Brazil before the pandemic. However, during the pandemic, professionals were more sensitive to reporting it. The system for notification, which was mandatory during the epidemic, was facilitated to allow for rapid notifications. The availability of samples from autopsies of cases (deaths) could have resulted in greater access to the laboratory diagnosis of this infection. Household data collection could also have caused information bias, as data on cases were collected through interviews with family members, while data on controls were obtained from the patients themselves, when they were adults. The proportion of refusals of household interviews was higher among cases (7.3%) than controls (1.6%), p = 0.001. Another possible limitation was memory bias, as a result of the time between the hospitalization and interview. However, the information analyzed from household interviews was about socio-demographic characteristics, which is less vulnerable to information and memory bias. Data on preexisting diseases were obtained from medical charts in hospitals, where they are completed at the moment of hospitalization, in the presence of the patients. The quality of completion of medical charts can differ between hospitals. Nonetheless, information about the presence of chronic diseases, clinical management of patients, laboratory results, radiological tests and treatment was available in these charts. The difficulties encountered during data collection were minimized by the use of a standardized questionnaire.",

Another relevant result was the antiviral treatment within the first 72 hours of onset of symptoms as a protective factor, also emphasizing the need to warn the population about the importance of seeking early medical care when an influenza-like illness appears, especially among high-risk groups and those with signs of disease aggravation. Training of health professionals, especially physicians, is required for adequate clinical management of patients and early antiviral treatment.",
