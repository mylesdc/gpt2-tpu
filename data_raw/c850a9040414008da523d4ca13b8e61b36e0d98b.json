            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first identified in 2012 as a novel etiological agent of severe respiratory disease in humans. As during infection by other viruses, host sensing of viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) induces several antiviral pathways. These include interferon (IFN), oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)-RNase L, and protein kinase R (PKR). Coronaviruses, including MERS-CoV, potently suppress the activation of these pathways, inducing only modest host responses. Our study describes the functions of two accessory proteins unique to MERS-CoV and related viruses, NS4a and NS4b, during infection in human airway epithelium-derived A549 cells. NS4a has been previously characterized as a dsRNA binding protein, while NS4b is a 2=,5=-phosphodiesterase with structural and enzymatic similarity to NS2 encoded by mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). We found that deletion of NS4a results in increased interferon lambda (IFNL1) expression, as does mutation of either the catalytic site or nuclear localization sequence of NS4b. All of the mutant viruses we tested exhibited slight decreases in replication. We previously reported that, like MHV NS2, NS4b antagonizes OAS-RNase L, but suppression of IFN is a previously unidentified function for viral phosphodiesterases. Unexpectedly, deletion of NS4a does not result in robust activation of the PKR or OAS-RNase L pathways. Therefore, MERS-CoV likely encodes other proteins that contribute to suppression or evasion of these antiviral innate immune pathways that should be an important focus of future work. This study provides additional insight into the complex interactions between MERS-CoV and the host immune response.",

More than 2,200 cases and 800 deaths have been reported to date, yet there are no licensed vaccines or treatments. Coronaviruses encode unique accessory proteins that are not required for replication but most likely play roles in immune antagonism and/or pathogenesis. Our study describes the functions of MERS-CoV accessory proteins NS4a and NS4b during infection of a human airway-derived cell line. Loss of these accessory proteins during MERS-CoV infection leads to host antiviral activation and modestly attenuates replication. In the case of both NS4a and NS4b, we have identified roles during infection not previously described, yet the lack of robust activation suggests much remains to be learned about the interactions between MERS-CoV and the infected host. of infection to uncover the full range of their interactions with the innate immune response.",

Briefly, MERS-\u0394NS4a was generated by altering the start codon (ATG\u00a1ATT) and adding an in-frame stop codon 10 codons downstream (TGG\u00a1TGA) to ablate synthesis of the FIG 1 MERS-CoV NS4a and NS4b recombinant mutants.

Cell lysates were prepared at 24 and 48 h postinfection, analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and probed by Western blotting with rabbit antiserum against NS4a and NS4b or mouse monoclonal antibodies against MERS nucleocapsid protein (N) and GAPDH.

More recent studies utilizing recombinant MERS-CoV have more completely elucidated the functions of some of these proteins, but conflicted with early reporter studies. NS4a, a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) binding protein, prevents the generation of protein kinase R (PKR)-induced stress granules in some cell types (18) .

In contrast to the Embecovirus PDEs, NS4b has an N-terminal nuclear localization signal (NLS) and is localized primarily to the nucleus of infected cells (16, 19) .

Consistent with earlier studies, NS4a prevents phosphorylation of PKR and the induction of IFN and interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression. However, PKR activation in the absence of NS4a does not result in phosphorylation of eIF2\u2423 (eukaryotic initiation factor 2\u2423) or translation arrest in A549 cells, in contrast to recent findings in a different cell type (18) . Unlike other viral dsRNA binding proteins such as vaccinia virus E3L (21) and influenza virus NS1 (22) , NS4a does not play a significant role in OAS-RNase L antagonism during MERS-CoV infection, as deletion of NS4a does not result in RNase L activation or enhance RNase L activation in the context of MERS-CoV encoding catalytically inactive NS4b.",

This is a unique role for virus-encoded phosphodiesterases, which otherwise lack an NLS and act solely as OAS-RNase L antagonists (12, (23) (24) (25) (26) . Together, the results demonstrate that NS4a and NS4b mediate both expected and unexpected functions during MERS-CoV infection and further demonstrate the importance of studying the function of these proteins in the context NS4a protein. MERS-\u0394NS4ab was generated by engineering a 951-nucleotide deletion of open reading frame 4a (ORF4a) and the majority of ORF4b without disrupting the transcription regulatory sequence (TRS) of NS5. To verify the loss of NS4b and/or NS4a expression by these mutants, human A549 cells stably expressing the MERS-CoV receptor DPP4 (A549 DPP4 ) were infected with MERS-CoV mutants at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10, and protein lysates were harvested at 24 and 48 h postinfection (hpi) to assess protein expression by Western blotting. As expected, NS4a is not synthesized during infection with MERS-\u0394NS4a, and neither protein is detectable during MERS-\u0394NS4ab infection (Fig. 1C) .",

MERS-NS4b H182R encodes NS4b with a catalytically inactive phosphodiesterase domain, which was generated from the MERS-CoV infectious clone as previously described (19, 27) . The NS4b NLS was previously described as bipartite (RKR 11 KRR), with the first basic motif more potently determining nuclear localization (12, 16) . However, this first motif overlaps with the upstream ORF4a, and so mutation of the RKR motif without causing amino acid changes in ORF4a is impossible. To determine how to construct the NS4b NLS mutant (NS4b NLSmut ), we mapped the nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequence by expressing wild-type (WT) and various NLS mutant NS4b genes from a pCAGGS vector in A549 cells and detecting NS4b proteins by immunofluorescent staining (Fig. 2A) . These plasmids expressed NS4b proteins with mutations of the RKR motif, the downstream KRR motif, and a previously undescribed basic motif that lies between the two previously characterized motifs (RKR 5 KKLR 2 KRR). All mutant proteins exhibited primarily cytoplasmic localization; thus, we engineered mutation of the central (KKLR) and The nuclear localization signal (NLS) was mapped by mutating basic residues in pCAGGS-NS4b, and NS4b was ectopically expressed in A549 cells by DNA transfection. Twenty-four hours posttransfection, cells were fixed and stained for NS4b using anti-NS4b rabbit serum and goat anti-rabbit AF594 secondary antibody.

To assess the impact of NS4a and NS4b mutation on viral replication, we carried out growth curve experiments in Vero and A549 DPP4 cells with MERS-\u0394NS4a and MERS-\u0394NS4ab. Vero cells lack a type I IFN response and were used to ensure recombinant viruses are not inherently replication deficient. We infected both cell types with WT or mutant MERS-CoV at an MOI of 1 and harvested supernatant at predetermined times postinfection for titration by plaque assay. All viruses replicated with equivalent kinetics to WT MERS-CoV and to equal titers in Vero cells, indicating that deletion of NS4a and NS4b does not disrupt critical aspects of the viral life cycle (Fig. 4A ). In contrast, deletion of NS4a and/or NS4b modestly attenuated MERS-CoV replication in A549 DPP4 cells at an MOI of 1, with the reductions in titer significant at most time points ( Fig. 4B and C) . Deletion of both NS4a and NS4b resulted in a slightly greater attenuation than deletion of NS4a alone, though this difference was not statistically significant. That replication of these mutant viruses is attenuated in A549 DPP4 cells and not in permissive Vero cells strongly suggests that the deficiency is linked to the intact antiviral responses in A549 cells.",

We aimed to systematically characterize the role of NS4a and NS4b in antagonism of IFN induction during MERS-CoV infection. To ensure that our newly generated A549 DPP4 cells were a suitable platform for investigating MERS-CoV suppression of the IFN response, we infected them with Sendai virus (SeV), Sindbis virus (SINV), To determine if NS4a and/or NS4b contributes to suppression of IFN expression, we infected A549 DPP4 cells with WT MERS-CoV, MERS-\u0394NS4a, and MERS-\u0394NS4ab and at 24 and 36 h postinfection compared gene expression of IFN and selected ISGs by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). In contrast to the minimal increases observed during WT MERS-CoV infection over mock-infected cells, MERS-\u0394NS4a or MERS-\u0394NS4ab infection resulted in significantly elevated levels of IFNL1 mRNA and representative ISG OAS2 and IFIT2 mRNAs. Interestingly there was no significant induction of type I IFN (Fig. 5C ). We did not observe any significant additive effect on antiviral gene expression from the additional deletion of NS4b. However, deletion of ORF4a and/or -b (Fig. 5C ) did not result in IFN induction approaching the levels we observed in response to SeV and SINV infection (Fig. 5B) , suggesting MERS-CoV encodes additional, potent IFN antagonists and/or utilizes other mechanisms such as sequestration of dsRNA in membrane-bound RTCs to avoid sensing by antiviral receptors.",

We previously reported that MERS-CoV NS4b is a member of the 2H-phosphoesterase superfamily of proteins and antagonizes OAS-RNase L activation during MERS-CoV infection through its 2=,5=-PDE activity (19, 29) . Unlike previously studied viral PDEs such as mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) NS2, the torovirus pp1a C-terminal domain, and the rotavirus VP3 C-terminal domain, which exhibit primarily cytoplasmic localization (23, 24) , NS4b localizes primarily to the nucleus (Fig. 2B) , suggesting additional functions. Earlier studies suggested that NS4b nuclear localization might be important for suppressing IFN expression (15) , but no previous studies have specifically addressed the role of its catalytic activity in IFN antagonism (30) . To characterize the function of the NS4b PDE domain and NLS, we used recombinant MERS-NS4b H182R and MERS-NS4b NLSmut . In Vero cells, both mutant viruses replicated with equivalent kinetics to WT MERS-CoV and to equal titers (Fig. 6A ). In A549 DPP4 cells, both viruses are modestly and similarly attenuated at late time points To further investigate whether PDE-dependent IFN antagonism is unique to MERS-CoV NS4b, we infected A549 cells stably expressing the MHV receptor CEACAM-1 (A549 mCEACAM-1 ) with WT MHV or MHV encoding catalytically inactive NS2 (MHV-NS2 H126R ), its native PDE. Both viruses induced slightly more IFNL1 expression than we observed for MERS-CoV, but MHV-NS2 H126R did so to an identical degree as WT MHV (Fig. 6E) , demonstrating that the MHV PDE does not antagonize IFN induction in this cell type, consistent with our previous observation in murine cells (31) .",

Since RNase L activation by MERS-NS4b H182R is less robust than by other viruses such as SINV in A549 DPP4 cells (Fig. 7) , we hypothesized that NS4a may contribute to antagonism of this pathway during MERS-CoV infection. To test this hypothesis, we infected A549 DPP4 cells at an MOI of 5, harvested RNA 48 h postinfection, and assessed rRNA degradation using a Bioanalyzer (19, 23) .

A recent study showed that loss of NS4a during infection led to PKR activation, translational arrest, and stress granule formation, but only in certain cell types (18) . We investigated whether NS4a antagonizes the dsRNA binding antiviral effector protein kinase R (PKR) during MERS-CoV infection in A549 DPP4 cells. A549 DPP4 cells were infected with WT MERS-CoV and MERS-\u0394NS4a at an MOI of 3, lysed at 24 h postinfection and analyzed for PKR activation by Western blotting. MERS-\u0394NS4a, but not WT MERS-CoV, induced PKR phosphorylation (Fig. 9A) . PKR phosphorylation during MERS-\u0394NS4a infection was also observed at 16 and 48 h postinfection (data not shown). However, despite the activation of PKR, we did not detect phosphorylation of eIF2\u2423 above background levels, suggesting that activation of PKR by MERS-\u0394NS4a in A549 DPP4 cells is not sufficient to engage downstream elements of this pathway or that MERS-CoV encodes an additional antagonist that blocks steps downstream of PKR phosphorylation. In contrast, SINV infection promotes robust phosphorylation of PKR and eIF2\u2423 in the same cells, indicating the lack of eIF2\u2423 phosphorylation during MERS-\u0394NS4a is not due to a deficiency of this pathway in A549 DPP4 cells (Fig. 9A) .",

Our study, as well as recent reports from other labs, has shown that deletion of MERS-CoV accessory proteins from recombinant viruses leads to enhanced activation of antiviral pathways. However, these effects are relatively small compared to those in other RNA viruses, and deletion of these accessory proteins only mildly attenuates replication. This is in contrast to early studies utilizing overexpression and reporter plasmids or ectopic expression from heterologous virus showing robust suppression of IFNB induction by NS4a and NS4b (11, (13) (14) (15) (16) .

These modest differences are consistent with previous studies of MERS-CoV accessory proteins (10, 12, 14, 18, 30) . Furthermore, there is a clinical report of human isolates with a 16-amino-acid deletion in NS4a (37) and West African camel MERS-CoV isolates with ORF3 and ORF4b deletions, likely due to founder effects upon introduction into these populations (30) . The isolation of these viruses supports findings that MERS-CoV accessory proteins are not definitive determinants of viral replication.

We observed a fastermigrating protein, also staining with antiserum directed against NS4b (Fig. 1C) .

Based on the role of the viral dsRNA binding proteins NS1 of influenza virus and E3L of vaccinia virus (21, 22, 33) in blocking RNase L activation as well as IFN and PKR, we hypothesized that NS4a contributes to antagonism of OAS-RNase L. Surprisingly, infection with MERS-\u0394NS4a did not induce increased rRNA degradation compared to wild-type virus, nor did NS4a deletion produce any additive effect on RNase L activation in combination with deletion of NS4b. Nevertheless, the lack of robust RNase L activation even when NS4b is catalytically inactive suggests the possibility MERS-CoV does encode additional antagonists. One intriguing possibility is nsp15; its MHV ortholog has recently been described as contributing to evasion of multiple dsRNA-sensing pathways (42, 43) . Alternatively, as has been speculated for MHV, MERS-CoV dsRNA may be contained, even in the absence of NS4a, in viral replication/ transcription complexes (RTCs) and therefore hidden from antiviral sensors (44, 45) .",

One previous study showed that ectopically expressed NS4a inhibits PKR activation and can functionally replace the native PKR antagonist of encephalomyocarditis virus (14) . Deletion of NS4a within recombinant MERS-CoV has previously been shown to result in enhanced translation arrest compared to WT MERS-CoV in HeLa cells (18) . Consistent with this, we found that deletion of NS4a results in PKR phosphorylation, but in A549 DPP4 cells, this did not lead to phosphorylation of eIF2\u2423 above background levels, and MERS-\u0394NS4a did not induce more translation arrest than WT MERS-CoV. In 293T DPP4 cells, MERS-CoV induced translation arrest as previously reported (36), but we did not observe a more robust effect during MERS-\u0394NS4a infection. Furthermore, PKR was not phosphorylated in 293T DPP4 cells during MERS-\u0394NS4a infection, confirming the PKR-independent mechanism of translational arrest and highlight-ing differences between cell types in antiviral pathway activation. These differences demonstrate the importance of using multiple model systems to fully elucidate interactions between viral proteins and host immune pathways.",
