Therefore, two sea cucumber species, Holothuria leucospilota and Stichopus vastus, were collected from Lampung (Indonesia), and 127 bacterial strains were identified by partial 16S rRNA-gene sequencing analysis and compared with the NCBI database. In addition, the overall bacterial diversity from tissue samples of the sea cucumbers H. leucospilota and S. vastus was analyzed using the cultivation-independent Illumina MiSEQ analysis. Selected bacterial isolates were grown to high densities and the extracted biomass was tested against a selection of bacteria and fungi as well as the hepatitis C virus (HCV). Identification of putative bioactive bacterial-derived compounds were performed by analyzing the accurate mass of the precursor/parent ions (MS 1 ) as well as product/daughter ions (MS 2 ) using high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) analysis of all active fractions. With this attempt we were able to identify 23 putatively known and two previously unidentified precursor ions. Moreover, through 16S rRNA-gene sequencing we were able to identify putatively novel bacterial species from the phyla Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria and also Firmicutes. Our findings suggest that sea cucumbers like H. leucospilota and S. vastus are promising sources for the isolation of novel bacterial species that produce compounds with potentially high biotechnological potential.",

About 47.4% (9 out of 19) of the bacterial extracts from the internal part of the H. leucospilota showed activity against Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis and 15.8% (3 out of 19) were active against Staphylococcus aureus. Strain HL 55, identified as Kocuria flava (99.21% sequence similarity), displayed potent activity against the two Gram-positives strains and additional activity against the Gram-negative E. coli (Table 2 ). Only one strain from the internal parts of the H. leucospilota showed activity against filamentous fungi M. hiemalis (5.3%, 1 out of 19). However, fungal activity was markedly higher against filamentous fungi M. hiemalis and R. glutinis when bacterial extracts from the external parts of H. leucospilota were tested (22.2%, 6 out of 27 tested).\"",

In addition, the potentially novel Actinobacteria genera and species displayed anti HCV properties, requiring further research on these bacteria to identify the new anti-infective compounds.

Another interesting bioactivity of valinomycin was its potency against the causative agent of the world's first pandemic in the 21 st century; the SARS-CoV virus. Unfortunately, valinomycin also showed enhanced cytotoxicity that prevented the drug to enter the clinical phase [63, 64] . The other precursor ions (cf.

However, one should keep in mind that identified precursor ions in either MS 1 or MS 2 compound databases might still be false positive, if they contained only a low number of matched peaks of their product/daughter ions. Precursor annotation as false positive in MS 2 databases has been reported to be in linear correlation with true positive precursor annotation [66] . It means, as more compounds or libraries are added to MS 2 databases, the probability of a false positive analysis of the target compounds becomes higher. Orthogonal analysis of the compounds (cf.

We choose the rich nutrient media MA and M1 for the isolation as it was used in the previous publications [30, 31, 68] . While the lower nutrient MA2 media was provided to allow slow growing bacteria more time to form colonies before the agar plates were eventually covered by fast growing bacteria like in the MA media. We swabbed with sterile cotton buds the surface of sea cucumbers after they had been washed with sterile sea water to isolate the associated bacteria. Swaps were streaked onto agar plates. In addition, a one cm piece from the outer and inner (intestine) body part was mixed with 1 mL of sterile sea water, homogenized and serially diluted to give 10\u00d7, 100\u00d7, and 1000\u00d7 dilutions.

The composite forward primer consisted of the Illumina 5' adapter, a 8-nt barcode, a 10-nt pad sequence, a 2-nt linker and the 515F-Y 16S rRNA gene-specific primer, whereas the composite reverse primer consisted of the Illumina 3' adapter, a 8-nt barcode, a 10-nt pad sequence, a 2-nt linker and the 806 rB 16S rRNA gene-specific primer [74] (Table S3) . PCR amplifications were performed in a final reaction volume of 25 \u00b5L containing 5 \u00b5L Green GoTaq \u00ae reaction buffer (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), 0.5 \u00b5L 10 mM dNTPs (Promega), 0.5 \u00b5L 10 \u00b5M forward primer, 0.5 \u00b5L 10 \u00b5M reverse primer, 0.15 \u00b5L GoTaq \u00ae DNA polymerase (5 U/\u00b5L, Promega) and 1 \u00b5L template DNA (0.1-10 ng/\u00b5L). The PCR program consisted of: initial denaturation of 2 min at 95 \u2022 C; 30 cycles of denaturation at 95 \u2022 C for 20 s, annealing at 55 \u2022 C for 15 s, and extension at 72 \u2022 C for 2 min; and final extension at 72 \u2022 C for 10 min. Samples were amplified in triplicate, after which the reaction volumes were pooled and 5 \u00b5L combined solution was run on a 1% agarose gel to assess amplification success. Next, the PCR products were purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Venlo, The Netherlands). DNA was eluted from the spin column with 10 \u00b5L distilled DNase/RNase-free water (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA). The DNA concentration of the elute was measured with the Nanodrop 2000c (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). An equimolar mixture of PCR products from unique samples, i.e., a sample library, was prepared and run on a 1% agarose gel. The gel band at~292 bp was extracted and purified using the ZymocleanTM Gel DNA Recovery Kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA). Elution was done with distilled DNase/RNase-free water. The sample mixture was reduced in volume by vacuum drying, and subsequently sent for Illumina paired end MiSEQ sequencing (2 \u00d7 250 bp) at GATC Biotech (Konstanz, Germany). A negative control sample was also included in the sample library because weak amplification was regularly detected in PCRs without template. The 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequences were deposited in the ENA SRA database under accession number PRJEB31855 (Table S3 ).",

Based on these results the 69 active strains were further cultured and extracted to be tested against human pathogenic microorganisms. Seed cultures were prepared by picking a bacterial colony from a 24 to 48 h old marine agar plate into a 15 mL Falcon tube holding 10 mL of liquid Marine Broth media (Carl Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany). After 3 days, 1 mL of this starting culture was transferred to 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask holding 100 mL of fresh Marine Broth media. All flasks were incubated at room temperature (about 23 \u2022 C) for 10 days to assure that the cultures reached the late stationary phase. Broth cultures were extracted with ethyl acetate (EtOAc; HPLC grade VWR International GmbH, Hannover, Germany) using Ultra-Turrax T65 (IKA, Staufen, Germany) at 12.000 rpm for 30 s with a broth culture: EtOAc partition of 1:2 (v/v). EtOAc extracts were separated from the aqueous phase by using a separation funnel.

A total of 20 \u00b5L raw extract 1 mg/mL and 180 \u00b5L bacterial/fungal suspension was tested in seven 1:2 serial dilution steps (dilution steps A to H) in 96-well plates for tissue cultures (TPP). Bacteria were cultivated in Mueller-Hinton bouillon (Roth) and fungi/yeasts in MYC medium (1.0% phytone peptone, 1.0% glucose, and 1.19% HEPES, pH 7.0). Start OD 600 was 0.01 for B. subtilis, E. coli and S. aureus; start OD 548 was 0.1 for M. hiemalis, C. albicans, R. glutinis, M. smegmatis and P. aeruginosa. The test organisms were cultivated at 30 \u2022 C and 160 rpm overnight. In this study, we use letter A-H for showing the different serial dilution steps of 1:2 (A: starting concentration-first well; B: first 1:2 dilution step-second well,...H: final dilution-last well). So, the highest bioactivity of the extract is the highest dilution (highest letter) in which the well still showed activity. Extracts showing activity in at least three wells were fractionated with semi-preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for peak-activity correlation. HPLC conditions were as described in [78] . Every 30 s 150 \u00b5L extract were collected in a new well of 96-well plates. After fractionation, the dried plate (N 2 ) was inoculated with the former inhibited test organism (150 \u00b5L/well) and incubated overnight. The inhibited wells could be correlated with peaks/retention time/UV-spectrum in the chromatogram. Active extracts were further analyzed by UPLC-HRMS.",

A linear gradient from 95% H 2 O and 5% MeCN to 5%H 2 O and 95% MeCN was used. The buffer system was acetic acid and 5 mM ammonium acetate. Eluent was detected by ESI-MS monitoring m/z 50-2000. Peaks were analyzed using software Bruker Data Analysis 4.2 (Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Bremen, Germany). The exact mass of the detected compounds was then compared to various databases namely Marinlit (Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK), Dictionary of Natural Product (ChemNetBase, Taylor&Francis, Abingdon, UK), METLIN (Scripps Research, La Jolla, CA, USA), and GNPS (University of California San Diego (UCSD), La Jolla, CA, USA) with a search variance of \u00b1 0.01-0.005 Dalton. This method enables a rapid detection of putatively novel bioactive compounds prior to time-consuming compound isolation. MS 2 were obtained in UPLC-HRMS (Waters Synapt G2-Si, Milford, MA, USA) with the same system as mentioned above. Peaks were analyzed using the software Waters MassLynx V4.1 (Milford, MA, USA). In this study, masses were measured in the positive mode. We analyzed the MS 2 data by using METLIN and MASST GNPS to identify the likely fragments of the compounds or its analogues. Search parameter in METLIN MS/MS fragment were precursor tolerance of 20 ppm, collision energy 40 eV, MS/MS tolerance 0.01 Da. The peaks were picked from the 30 highest peaks in the MS 2 spectra before the precursor m/z. The MASST GNPS are open MS 2 search engine like gene analysis in BLAST in NCBI [79] . Parameter for the analysis were minimum cosine score 0.3; minimum matched peaks 6; parent mass tolerance 2; fragment mass tolerance 0.2; search also analog; and search database was GNPS.",

Intriguingly, medermycin's precursor in the GNPS database was m/z 457.17 with adduct ion [M + H] + . A difference of 1.01 with the precursor in our sample and also with the exact mass in the MS 1 databases. One of the closest matched compounds for the precursor ion m/z 490.207 was the antibiotic OA 6129E (489.2145 [M]), which had been originally isolated from Streptomyces sp. OA-6129 [47]. The MS 2 spectra of the compound was not mentioned in those articles. However, comparison of the MS 2 spectra 490.207 [M + H] + with the GNPS Database resulted in low similarity to candesartan (precursor ion of m/z 441.17, cosine score of 0.61, and only 7 shared peaks)",
