Currently, the viruses virulence determinants and host gene expressions during FIPV infection are not fully understood. Methods: RNA sequencing of Crandell Rees Feline Kidney (CRFK) cells, infected with FIPV strain 79-1146 at 3 hours post infection (h.p.i), were sequenced using the Illumina next generation sequencing approach. Bioinformatic's analysis, based on Felis catus 2X annotated shotgun reference genome, using CLC bio Genome Workbench mapped both control and infected cell reads to 18899 genes out of 19046 annotated genes. Kal's Z test statistical analysis was used to analyse the differentially expressed genes from the infected CRFK cells. Real time RT-qPCR was developed for further transcriptional profiling of three genes (PD-1, PD-L1 and A3H) in infected CRFK cells and Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) from healthy and FIP-diseased cats.",

Most genes were closely clustered together, suggesting a homogeneous expression. The majority of the genes that were significantly regulated, were those associated with monocytes-macrophage and Th1 cell functions, and the regulation of apoptosis. Real time RT-qPCR developed focusing on 2 up-regulated genes (PD-L1 and A3H) together with an apoptosis associated gene PD-1 expressions in FIPV infected CRFK cells and in PBMCs from healthy and FIP diagnosed cats produced concordant results with transcriptome data. Conclusion: The possible roles of these genes, and their importance in feline coronaviruses infection, are discussed.",

FECV is very common in the cat population worldwide, and has been shown to have infected 20-60% pet cats and shed by 75-100% cats in multi-cat environments [1, 2] . Of those shedding the virus, 1-5% will develop Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP) disease [3] . Within the biotypes, the viruses are differentiated further into serotype I and serotype II, based on virus neutralizing antibodies. Type I FECV and FIPV strains are more ubiquitous worldwide and are more likely to cause clinical FIP, while type II strains are less common, but more adaptable to cell culture [2] .",

Studies have shown that several mutations throughout the FIPV genome were detected, but mutations at 3c membrane protein and 7b secretory glycoprotein genes were suggested to be responsible for transforming FECV to FIPV [4, 5] . A recent study revealed that mutation of the S1/S2 locus and modulation of a furin recognition site normally present in the S gene of FECVs is a critical contributing factor for development of FIP [6] . Furthermore, it was found that FIPV infection is associated with T cell depletion by apoptosis; although the virus cannot infect CD4+ and CD8+ T cells [7, 8] . Therefore, apoptosis of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells is probably caused by mediators from infected macrophages and/or intestinal epithelial cells [8, 9] . Hence, little is known about the interaction of the virus and host cells; especially the early cellular transcriptional responses towards virus infection, virus mechanism of inducing T cell apoptosis, and the absence of cell-mediated immunity (CMI) response in FIP infected cats.",

The reference feline genome sequence assembly of transcriptome analysis of early infection (3 h.p.i.) of CRFK cells with FIPV 79-1146 showed that the expressions of 215 transcripts (0.8% of the trimmed annotated) were statistically significant, based on Kal's Z test. Only 96 transcripts, which consisted of 44 up-regulated genes and 17 down-regulated genes, were expressed with fold absolute changes of 2 or more. Since only one sample per group was analysed, Kal's Z test was used to determine the significant differences in the expression profiles. Study has shown that this test evaluates single sample against another single sample where each group in an experiment has only one sample [16] . This test is based on an approximation of the binomial distribution by the normal distribution considering proportions Figure 1 Scatter plot of control RNA-seq RPKM versus infected RNA-seq RPKM of significant transcripts (p < 0.05) with absolute fold change value of 2 or more. Most genes from both samples are closely clustered except for 4 genes label 1 to 6. 1 and 2 are MX1 transcripts 1 and 2, respectively, 3 and 4 = RSAD2 transcripts 1 and 2, respectively, 5 = PLIN2 and 6 = SERPINB1. rather than raw counts so that it can be used reliably on libraries of different size. The transcriptional profiles of selected genes in FIPV in vitro infected cells, as well as cats diagnosed with FIP, were explored. The expressions of A3H, which involved in viral RNA and DNA editing causing mutation during RNA virus infection [17] and PD-1 and its ligand (PD-L1), which are involved in programmed cell death and negative regulation of T cells immune response [18] , were characterised. A3H has antiretroviral activity by generating lethal hypermutations in viral genomes and is associated with increased resistance to HIV-1 infection in certain populations [19] . In the case of felines, A3H (but not A3C) has been found to reduce the infectivity of feline leukemia virus [17] . It is interesting to detect that the expression of A3H is readily expressed at higher levels in PBMCs than in FIPV infected cells (Tables 3  and 5 ), indicating the possible involvement of the gene in antiviral activity. Furthermore, the up-regulation of the gene is less, compared to PD-1 and PD-L1 in FIPV diagnosed cats. In addition, the expressions of A3H are significantly up-regulated in FIPV infected CRFK cells at 48 h.p.i. The actual reason for this high expression of A3H is unclear, but suggests that this gene is essential in restricting viral replication or forming part of the type 1 interferon-induced innate response, since recent study has indicated the involvement of A3H in restricting virus replication [17, 20] .",

In general, their expressions are correlated to each other. Similar patterns were also observed in chronic FIV infection [21] and in HIV infection in humans [22] ; where they were associated with increasing immune dysfunction and T cell depletion. Previous studies have shown that although FIPV cannot infect CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells [8] , cats infected with the virus showed T cell depletion by apoptosis resulting in an acute immunodeficiency [7] . Hence, we hypothesized that PD-L1 could be a mediator that mediates apoptosis of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, since its expression is found in a wide range of nonhematopoietic cells [23] . Furthermore, the blockade of PD-L1 expression was found to enhance T cell immunity and cytokine production [24] . Nevertheless, more studies are required to confirm our hypothesis.",

Even though the study was performed on infected CRFK cells, a kidney epithelial cells, it is interesting to note that transcriptome analysis of cells proposed that the inflammation process was associated with proinflammatory and Th1-like cytokines production, due to the up-regulation of several chemokine genes, such as CCL8, CXCL10, and CCL17; and genes associated with innate immune responses, such as PHF11, ATF3, and IRF1. Further study on infection of FIPV in particularly type I FIPV on macrophage-like cells namely fcwf-4 cells and samples from FIP diagnosed cats will add more value to our findings. Furthermore, the down-regulation of CRIP1 (a T helper regulatory gene) ( Table 2 ) also suggests that FIPV infection is associated with Th1 response, based on a study on CRIP1 gene in mice, transgenic mice, and in murine cell line [25] . In that study, they found that the down-regulation of CRIP was associated with the expression of IL-2, IFN-\u03b3, and TNF\u03b1. Previous studies have shown that in vitro and in vivo FIPV infections were associated with TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 expressions [9, 26] .",

In our study, we found that at 3 hours, a few complete virus genomes that completely aligned to FIPV 79-1146 reference genome sequence (data not shown) has already been assembled. MX1 expression was up-regulated in FIPV infection (Table 1) , similar to other RNA virus infections, its role in FIP pathogenesis is still unclear and requires further investigation. Previous studies have shown that the expression of MX1 gene inhibits viral replication during various RNA virus infections [28, 29] . Early in vitro FIPV infection is also associated with a marked increase in the expression of RSAD2 (radical Sadenosyl methionine domain-containing protein 2) also known as viperin (Table 1) . Previous studies have shown viperin involvement in inhibiting viral RNA and/or protein synthesis during different virus infections, such as the West Nile virus, Dengue virus, and hepatitis virus [30, 31] . Hence, further study is required to define the role of viperin in FIPV replication and infection. Serine Proteinase Inhibitor clade B member 1 (SERPINB1) is the only gene that was markedly down-regulated (Table 2) . SERPINB1 functions as an inhibitor of the neutrophil serine proteases, found at inflammatory sites where the inhibition of the gene prevents tissue destruction by phagocytic cells during the virus clearance process by infiltrating neutrophils and monocytes [32, 33] . Thus, SERPINB1 down-regulation could possibly be part of innate immune response in recruiting phagocytic cells for the proteolytic destruction of infected cells. Besides genes that modulate T cell functions, several genes with proapoptotic and/or anti-apoptotic are also differentially regulated; thus highlighting their functions in regulating the apoptosis of virus infected cells (Additional file 1: Table S1 and Additional file 1: Table S2 ). However, the pro-apoptotic gene YAP-65 or YAP-1, which was found up-regulated in FIV infection in CRFK cells [34] , was not up-regulated in this study.",

Six FIP diagnosed domestic short hair breed cats, with ages ranging from 8 months to adult, that were admitted to University Veterinary Hospital, UPM, were considered for this study ( Table 4 ). The cats tested negative for FeLV and FIV antibodies, but positive for FCoV antibodies, and showed abdominal/pleural effusion. Meanwhile, 5 healthy cats, with negative results for FCoV, FeLV, and FIV antibodies, were selected as controls. The kits for FCoV, FeLV and FIV antibody tests originated from Biogal's feline coronavirus (FCoV) [FIP] ImmunoComb\u00ae Antibody test kit (Biogal Galed Laboratories, USA) and IDEXX's SNAP\u00ae Combo FeLV Ag/FIV Antibody test kit (IDEXX Laboratories, USA), respectively. The tests were performed as per the methods recommended in their respective manuals. The health assessment and blood collection of the cats were performed by a trained and certified veterinarian (GTS). The sampling were performed according to internationally recognized guidelines and recommended by the Animal Care and Use Committee at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Universiti Putra Malaysia. Two to 5 ml of cat blood was drawn and stored at 4\u00b0C in BD Vacutainer\u00ae (BD USA) EDTA-K2 tubes. Parts of the blood were used for the test kits, while the rest was processed for PBMCs extraction. PBMCs were isolated using the Ficoll-Paque\u2122 Plus (GE Healthcare, USA) method, according to the manufacturers protocol. Total RNA from PBMCs was isolated using an RNeasy mini plus kit (Qiagen, Germany), as described by the manufacturer. RNA quantity and purity was measured and assessed using a Nanodrop Nanophotometer P-class (Implen GmbH, Germany). The isolated RNA samples were either kept at \u221280\u00b0C for further analysis, or immediately used for real-time RT-qPCR analysis.",
