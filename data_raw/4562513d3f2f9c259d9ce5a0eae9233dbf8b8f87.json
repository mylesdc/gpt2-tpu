            "text": "Intestinal epithelial cells play an important role in the nutrition absorption and immune response against pathogens. The absorption and barrier functions are heavily dependent on mitochondrial function [6] [7] [8] . Because mitochondria also play important roles as energy sources, platforms for inflammatory and immune response signaling, and regulators of apoptosis, the mitochondrial mass, function and integrity are strictly regulated in order to respond to varying energy requirements and environmental conditions [9] . Dysfunctional or damaged mitochondria trigger a destructive cycle of mitochondrial damage and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, which is detrimental to cell survival [10] . Therefore, cells maintain a balance between mitochondrial biogenesis [11] and the removal of damaged mitochondria [12] . Evidence suggests that mitophagy may counteract apoptosis [13] [14] [15] . Several viruses such as Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) [16] and Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) [17] stimulate mitophagy and attenuate apoptosis, presumably to enhance viral replication. Although TGEV induces apoptosis in some cell lines, but not in intestinal epithelial cells [5] , the potential role played by mitophagy in this system has not yet been explored. Here, we present experiments that examine the effect of TGEV infection on mitochondrial function and mitophagy in the nontransformed porcine intestinal epithelial cell line IPEC-J2. IPEC-J2 cell is originally isolated from jejunal epithelia of a neonatal unsuckled piglet, models in vivo function of the small intestine more closely than colon tumorigenic cell lines [18] [19] [20] [21] . Our data reveal that TGEV infection promotes selective autophagic degradation of damaged mitochondria via mitophagy, which attenuates apoptosis and enhances viral infection.",

As shown as in Figure 1A and 1B, the level of membrane electric potential (\u0394\u03c8), decrease at 12 hours after TGEV infection, reaches a minimum at 24 hours, despite treated with ciclosporin A (CsA) or not. The decrease of \u0394\u03c8 could be partial suppressed by CsA (a strong stabilizer of \u0394\u03c8) treatment. The reduction of membrane potential is often associated with cell apoptosis. However, the expected apoptosis does not occur after TGEV infection ( Figure 1C ). The total mitochondrial mass is another important factor to contribute \u0394\u03c8. Using MitoTracker Green FM (total mitochondria) and MitoTracker Red CMXRos (functional mitochondria), we found that the tendency of total mitochondrial mass is similar with that of \u0394\u03c8 after TGEV infection ( Figure  1E ) and the ratio of dysfunctional mitochondria does not change significantly ( Figure 1D ). The decrease of total mitochondrial mass indicated mitochondria degradation, which usually performed by autophagy.",

In TGEV-infected cells, mRFP puncta have accumulated in the cytoplasm at 12 h to 48 h post-infection, whereas EGFP puncta are weak. A similar response is seen in cells treated with rapamycin, indicating that complete autophagic flux is induced by TGEV infection. It is worth noting that chloroquine (CQ), an inhibiter of lysosomal degradation, could induce incomplete autophagy with or without Rapamycin in IPEC-J2 cells.

IPEC-J2 cells were infected with TGEV for 0 h, 3 h, 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, 36 h, and 48 h, after which, Annexin V-PI double staining was performed to differentiate cells in early apoptosis (Annexin V+, PI-) from those in late apoptosis (Annexin V+, PI+). d. IPEC-J2 cells were infected with TGEV for 0 h, 12 h, 24 h, and 48 h. Cells treated for 12 h with CsA or Rotenone were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. Abnormal and normal mitochondria were quantitated by FACS using the fluorescent probes Mitotracker Green (stains all mitochondria) and Mitotracker Red (stains functional mitochondria). Populations are shown as dot plots. The fraction of dysfunctional mitochondria was calculated for three independent experiments as 100% \u00d7 [(green stained mitochondria) -(red stained mitochondria)] / (green stained mitochondria). e. the statistical results of mitotracker Green in Figure 1D .

After TGEV infection, EGFP-LC3B clearly translocates to mitochondria 12 h and 24 h after infection, but co-localization of EGFP-LC3B and mito-mCherry decreases after 48 h ( Figure 3A and 3B). To examine whether mitophagic flux is complete, a sensitive dual fluorescence reporter expressing mRFP-EGFP-mito fused in-frame to a mitochondrial targeting sequence (transmembrane structure of Bcl-xL) was employed to observe the completion of the mitophagic process by delivery of the engulfed mitochondria to lysosomes for degradation. As show as in Figure S2 , lots of mitochondria present as puncta, with weak green florescent and bright red florescent, especially at 24 h and 48 h post TGEV infection. Combined with the complete autophagic flux ( Figure 2G , 2H and Figure S1 ), we presumed the mitophagic degradation is not inhibited by TGEV infection.",

To examine the location of N on mitochondrial dependent viral infection, we constructed the lentiviral vector pLVX-N-Flag (resistance to puromycin) and transfected to IPEC-J2 cells. The co-localization with N-Flag and mitochondria is presented in Figure S3A . Moreover, the morphology of mitochondria in N-Flag cells is different with control cells ( Figure S3A ). In addition, the ROS and mtROS ( Figure S3B and S3C) is also increased, but does not cause obvious apoptosis ( Figure S3D ) by N-Flag protein expression. The total mitochondrial mass is also decreased ( Figure S3E ) in N-Flag cells, which indicate mitophagy may be actived. To confirm that, we constructed the pLVX-EGFP-LC3B (resistance to blasticidin) lentiviral and transfected to N-Flag cells. As show as in Figure S3G , the co-localization of mitochondria, N-Flag and EGFP-LC3B puncta is presented in N-Flag cells.

To determine whether mitophagy attenuates apoptosis during TGEV infection, IPEC-J2 cells were simultaneously stained with Propidium Iodide (PI) and Annexin V at 0 h, 24 h, and 48 h post-infection, and analyzed by flow cytometry. The apoptosis of IPEC-J2 cells treated with CCCP was similar to that observed in untreated cells. In contrast, 3-MA treatment ( Figure 4G ) and ATG5 knockdown ( Figure 4H ) both increased apoptosis in infected cells. However, the moderate increase of apoptosis by inhibition of autophagy, drug or knockdown, indicate autophagy play multiple roles in promotion TGEV infection. Finally, TGEV infection increased early apoptosis and inhibited late apoptosis when IPEC-J2 cells were pre-treated with Rotenone ( Figure 4G ), a drug that stimulates apoptosis by increasing mitochondrial ROS. Together, these experiments demonstrate that mitophagy promote the infection of TGEV partly by attenuating cell apoptosis.",

Our data show that ROS levels is fluctuated without abnormally high level. We also examined mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) production during TGEV infection by measuring the fluorescence of DHE. Between 0.5 h to 12h after infection, mtROS production decreased, but was restored and increased after 24 h ( Figure 5B ). To further examine oxidative stress status, we measured mRNA levels for three proteins known to be involved in modulating ROS levels: As shown as in www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget and analyzed for indirect immunofluorescence using an anti-TGEV N protein antibody, followed by the corresponding secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Flour 647, as described in Materials and Methods. Cell nuclei were counterstained with DAPI and fluorescence signals were visualized by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. In the images, the colors correspond to nuclei (white), N (blue), EGFP-LC3 (green), and mito-mCherry (red). Co-localized signals for N, EGFP-LC3 and mitochondria are white in the cytoplasm of the merged images. Higher magnification images represent the regions enclosed in white squares. The co-location of EGFP and mCherry punctra was counted and showed in b. c. IPEC-J2 cells were pre-treated with or without CCCP, followed by mock or TGEV infection for 24 h. SQSTM1, N and HSP60 were then detected by western blot in mitochondrial or cytoplasmic cell fractions. mtHSP60 and GAPDH were used as loading controls for mitochondrial and cytoplasmic fractions, respectively. d. Quantitative results for SQSTM1 in mitochondria fraction, the data represent the mean \u00b1 SD of three independent experiments. One-way ANOVA; *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01. Figure 5C -5E, the expression of SCD and eNOS begins to increase 12 h after TGEV infection, and reaches the highest level at 48 h (P < 0.01). The expression of Nrf2 decreases at 3 h and 6 h after TGEV infection and then increases from 12 h to 72 h, with a maximum at 24 h (P < 0.01). Since oxidative stress plays important roles in mitophagy [34, 35] , we then explored the relationship between oxidative stress and mitophagy during TGEV infection. As shown as in Figure 6A and 6B lift and middle panel, the expression of LC3-I, LC3-II decreased and N expression increased at 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h after TGEV infection in GSH-treated cells ( Figure 6A and 6B right panel). To exclude the possibility of decreased mitochondrial injury by GSH, mitochondrial membrane potential and mitochondrial mass were monitored. Results ( Figure 7A and 7B) show that, in GSH-treated cells, the mitochondrial membrane potential also decreases after TGEV infection, but the total mitochondrial mass increases after TGEV infection, indicating the quality of mitochondria decreased and mitophagic degradation inhibited.",

Importantly, suppression of DJ-1 expression strongly reduces the expression of viral protein N and the viral progeny yield in TGEV infected IPEC-J2 cells compared with controls ( Figure 8D and 8F). In contrast, the ROS level in DJ-1 knockdown cells is extremely high during TGEV infection compared with controls ( Figure 8G ).

Despite of the powerful function in energy generation, mitochondria could release a lot of pro-apoptotic factors, such as ROS and cytochrome c, after injury [45] . Thus, the moderate and timely mitophagy promotes cell survival and homeostatic by regulating of energy generation and by clearing dysfunctional mitochondria that signal for apoptosis. In addition, mitophagy is essential for mitochondrial turnover [46] to avoid ATP exhausting, which will consequently leading to necrosis [47] . In our study, the decrease in mitochondrial mass and increase in SQSTM1 in the mitochondrial cell fraction further supports the emergence of mitophagy after TGEV infection. The number of mitochondria within cells is regulated by the balance between mitochondrial biogenesis [48] and the removal of damaged mitochondria. Damaged mitochondria, as well as other impaired organelles and proteins in cells are degraded by specific autophagy-lysosome pathway [11] . Using the dual fluorescence reporter lentivirial pLVX-mRFP-EGFP-Bcl-xL, we demonstrated that TGEV induces complete mitophagy evident by fusion of mitophagosome with lysosome. Furthermore, CCCP treatment induces mitophagy by decreasing mitochondrial membrane potential [49] , causing mitochondrial fragments to appear in the cytoplasmic fraction ( Figure 3C ). In contrast, TGEV infection decreased mitochondrial but we found the fluorescent intensity of EGFP was recovered after immunofluorescence (data not show). Therefore, the model of mRFP-EGFP fused with Bclxl transmembrane structure is only suitable for living cells.In general, the inhibition of apoptosis is a common strategy to persist viral infection in many chronic virus diseases [29, 33, 50] . As mitochondria is regarded to function as the control point in apoptotic pathways [51] , it is plausible that mitophagy may play a role in the modulation of apoptosis. Most notably, mitochondrial is the main ROS factory, which functions as a signaling molecule through oxidation of redox-sensitive cysteine residues and inhibition of protein phosphorylation [52] . Because ROS can function as a destructive agent at high levels, resulting in cell death [53] [54] [55] , cellular ROS homeostasis is tightly regulated. A relationship between TGEV infection and ROS production has been reported [56] but infection did not induce a significant increase of ROS in IPEC-J2 cells. These results are in contrast with those reported for ST cells after TGEV infection [22] . Due to the strong energy and material basis metabolism and the large number of mitochondria [57] , the intestinal epithelial cells have the great potential to produce ROS leading to the powerful ability to control oxidative stress.",

In addition, autophagy is required to degrade ROS-producing organelles such as mitochondria and peroxisomes [58] . Mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) activates general mitophagy to suppress oxidative damage [59] . We find that the peak of TGEV virus infection is accompanied by ROS or mtROS accumulation and mitochondrial degradation, but apoptosis is nearly undetectable. Obvious mitophagy can be observed 12 h after TGEV infection, and can be suppressed by GSH treatment. Many reports have shown that GSH or other antioxidants treatment could effectively inhibit apoptosis caused by oxidative stress [60] [61] [62] . The impaired mitochondria could release ROS and other pro-apoptotic substances, such as cytochrome c, etc., to promote apoptosis. The inhibition of autophagy by GSH, suppress the removing of damaged mitochondria, which may release other pro-apoptotic substances, and promote the apoptosis after TGEV infection. While, the suppressing ROS by antioxidants also inhibits apoptosis. The final effect of GSH on cell apoptosis may be combined with the inhibition of mitophagy and elimination of abnormal ROS. These data suggest that oxidative stress play an important role in mitophagy and apoptosis post TGEV infection.",

            "text": "Autophagy is an effective way to resist viral invasion [63] and replication [64] [65] [66] [67] . The immune response, especially Type I IFN responses, promote autophagy to inhibit virus replication [68] . However, some viruses can highjack the autophagic structure as viral replication sites [66, 67] . Accumulated studies indicate that many coronavirus utilise the autophagy membrane structures to replication [69] . Moreover, SARS-CoV ORF9b could localize to mitochondria and induce autophagy, which caused the MAVS signalosome degradation to further suppress antiviral transcriptional responses [70] . TGEV coronavirus contains 4 major structural proteins: spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. Previous study has demonstrated that, the nucleocapsid protein of CoVs facilitated virus RNA switching and was required for efficient transcription [71] . Moreover, TGEV nucleocapsid protein could interact with EF1a and facilitate viral replication [72] . Coronavirus nucleocapsid could localize in cytoplasm and nucleus [73] [74] [75] . While, in our results, the subcellular localization of TGEV nucleocapsid was mainly found in mitochondria, which was inconsistent with different studies [76, 77] . Although, the ROS and mtROS are elevated, distinct fragmented mitochondrial morphology is observed, and the total mitochondrial mass is decreased by N protein expression, but the mitochondrial membrane potential is not changed ( Figure  S3 ). These results indicate the balance of mitochondrial quality and quantity in IPEC-J2 cells is very successful. Despite the N protein localizing on almost mitochondria ( Figure S3A ), the number of mitophagosames are limited ( Figure S3G ). These results indicate the mitochondrial localization of N protein may create same injury but be not directly related to the mitophagy. The directly inducer may be the injured mitochondria, which is eliminated by fission form normal mitochondrial and degraded by mitophagy. Together, the nucleocapsid of TGEV may contribute to the mitochondrial injury and induction of mitophagy during TGEV infection.",

The role of DJ-1 in the regulation of oxidative stress has been extensively studied in neurodegenerative diseases [82] [83] [84] .

Despite of much work for DJ-1 in regulation of oxidative stress and mitophagy, the role of DJ-1 in autophagy/mitophagy is poorly understood. Our work indicates that mitophagy benefits TGEV infection by eliminating damaged mitochondria, thereby controlling ROS release and blocking oxidative damage. TGEV infection increases DJ-1 expression, and DJ-1 knockdown reduces autophagy and mitophagy, causing an increase in apoptosis and a decrease in TGEV infection. Furthermore, mitochondria become vulnerable in IPEC-J2 cell after DJ-1 knockdown, especially after infection with TGEV, and ROS release increases significantly, which is partly counteracted by GSH treatment. Our results are consistent with recent work in DJ-1 -/mice exhibit increased sensitivity to oxidative stress [86] , and glutathione or NAC treatment attenuates DJ-1-deficiency-induced phenotypes [82] . Given that DJ-1-mediated mitophagy is required to prevent TGEVinduced apoptosis, and thus favors viral infection and persistence.",

More research is needed to explain the association between mitophagy and TGEV infection, especially in vivo.

In green/red merged images, yellow puncta (mRFP+ EGFP+) indicate autophagosomes, while red puncta (mRFP+ EGFP-) indicate autolysosomes. Rapamycin can efficiently induce autophagic flux resulting in red puncta accumulation [88, 89] , while CQ can efficiently inhibit the fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes resulting in yellow puncta accumulation [90, 91] .
