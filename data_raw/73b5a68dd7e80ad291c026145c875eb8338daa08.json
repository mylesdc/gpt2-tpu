The precise coordinates of the centre of each virus particle were determined by applying a circle detection algorithm based on the circular Hough transform 1 (cHough). To the reconstructed superresolution image (in which circular viruses can be readily observed, see Figure 2a and 3), the determination of the centre of each particle is essential for the particle alignment procedure. The use of the cHough algorithm for the detection of the virus and the determination of their centre is a more robust and more efficient approach than object detection followed by calculation of the centre of mass. First, because the detection and the determination of the centre are determined simultaneously and not in two separate analysis steps but, also, because the circle detection of the cHough is very robust to occlusion, particle clusters, non-uniform labelling and presence of background.",

Those simulated particles were analysed by cHough using the same routine as with the experimental data. The distribution of error between the estimated and simulated centre of particle was obtained and found to be approximatively Gaussian.

Here, the use of primary or secondary labelling with either 10 or 20 nm average localization precision was tested. We note that, as the number of localization increases the error decreases. This is in agreement with the fact that more localization will render a better defined particle, for which the centre can be determined with higher accuracy. For a fixed number of localizations per particle, decreasing the labelling size or the localization error both result in a lower alignment error. In fact, both contribute to a more compact particle for which the edges and therefore the centre can be determined with higher precision. However, secondary labelling often exhibited a larger number of localization per particle (see Figure 3 ), therefore compensating for the larger linker size. Therefore, the alignment error was relatively constant across dataset (~10 nm), of the order of the localization error.",

The mTurquoise localizations were corrected for chromatic aberration with a two-colour transformation using rapidSTORM. The transformation between the two channels was obtained with the method described for 2-colour dSTORM. Additionally, a linear spatial offset affected the localizations obtained between the two channels. This linear offset was constant across a single field of view and could therefore be corrected by calculating the centre of mass of each group of data point obtained for each field of view.",

Our data can be modelled as a set of randomly oriented coordinates on a sphere (random sphere point picking 4 ), that is projected on the 2D imaging plane and then affected by a localization error. Similarly to the MCV model, these data can be modelled using Monte-Carlo simulation. In this case, the total localization error is a result of the localization error of the centre of the capsid and the alignment error. The capsid centroid localization error can be estimated using Mortensen et al. formulae and leads to a typical localization error of the order of 5 nm thanks to the high signal to noise ratio obtained in the mTurquoise dataset.

For VP1/2, an offset of 14 nm was measured. This lower offset value may reflect the fact that this capsid-bound protein is thought to be located close to the capsid and is expected to exhibit little to no offset 6 . This value of offset may then be a result of an analysis bias due to the fact that we underestimated the total localization precision. In fact, as we showed previously 7 , it is difficult to totally correct for the chromatic offset and random residual error may still reside.
