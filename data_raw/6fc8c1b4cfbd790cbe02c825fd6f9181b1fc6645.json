In the UK, the NHS Direct telephone service was used by many of these patients. We used qualitative interviews to identify the main reasons why people approached NHS Direct with concerns about swine flu and to identify aspects of their contact which were reassuring, using a framework approach. Methods: 33 patients participated in semi-structured interviews. All patients had telephoned NHS Direct between 11 and 14 May with concerns about swine flu and had been assessed as being unlikely to have the illness. Results: Reasons for seeking advice about swine flu included: the presence of unexpectedly severe flu-like symptoms; uncertainties about how one can catch swine flu; concern about giving it to others; pressure from friends or employers; and seeking 'peace of mind.' Most participants found speaking to NHS Direct reassuring or useful. Helpful aspects included: having swine flu ruled out; receiving an alternative explanation for symptoms; clarification on how swine flu is transmitted; and the perceived credibility of NHS Direct. No-one reported anything that had increased their anxiety and only one participant subsequently sought additional advice about swine flu from elsewhere. Conclusions: Future major incidents involving other forms of chemical, biological or radiological hazards may also cause large numbers of unexposed people to seek health advice. Our data suggest that providing telephone triage and information is helpful in such instances, particularly where advice can be given via a trusted, pre-existing service.",

            "text": "The 2009 outbreak of influenza A (H1N1), or 'swine flu,' killed 457 people in the UK between April 2009 and March 2010 [1] . Although the illness turned out to be relatively mild for most people, the early stages of the outbreak were characterised by uncertainty as to the nature and severity of the illness, with concern being expressed about the ability of medical services to cope with the volume of patients who might require help. While most attention focused on the ability of hospitals and primary care trusts to care for patients suffering from swine flu, [2] in practice most people who initially sought help did not have the illness. In the UK, NHS Direct, which is a 24 hour telephone and online health advice and information service staffed primarily by nurses and health information advisors, received approximately 63 000 calls relating to swine flu in the first month of the outbreak [3] . During the same period only 185 cases of swine flu were confirmed across the UK [4] . Although the tendency for large numbers of unaffected individuals to seek advice and assistance from the health services is a common occurrence during major public health incidents, [5, 6] little evidence exists as to what factors motivate these patients to seek help. A common assumption is that this group consists of worried patients who require reassurance. [e.g. [7, 8] ]",

After the World Health Organisation declared on 29 April that a pandemic was imminent, widespread Government advertisements about the condition began to appear in the UK, including an information leaflet delivered to every house in the country [9] . These mass media campaigns were supplemented by websites and an automated telephone line which contained more detailed information. Members of the public were advised that if they had \"just returned from Mexico or an affected country\" and \"think [you] might have swine flu\" they should check their symptoms on-line, call the automated telephone number and then telephone either their GP or NHS Direct \"if you have taken these steps and are still concerned.\" [9] Similar remote triage systems have also been used in other countries during both the swine flu outbreak and in previous major public health incidents [10, 11] . Similar systems are also recommended for future incidents [5, 6] .",

All of these issues tend to increase levels of public concern [13] and make it difficult to provide effective reassurance to patients. Indeed, during one previous major incident in the UK, some people who spoke to NHS Direct or to the UK's Health Protection Agency by telephone reported that this contact added to their confusion or made them suspicious as to why they had been asked to contact these services at all [14] .",

We first looked for quotes from each transcript which related to one of these main themes. Within each theme, we then grouped quotes together which appeared to reflect the same underlying sub-theme, using an iterative process of refining and re-labelling these sub-themes. Once themes were identified, two researchers re-examined each transcript and identified how many participants had explicitly mentioned each sub-theme to ensure that they reflected general experiences among our participants rather than idiosyncratic findings relating to single people.",

Their explanations suggested a variety of perceptions as to what might count as exposure, ranging from mixing with others who had returned from an affected region (\"I'm a teacher, and a number of the kids had come back from the States, so I thought it was a possibility\"), to having been in roughly the same location as a known case (\"I came down with flu symptoms and I work at [an] airport. And there was two confirmed cases of swine flu gone through\"), to being among unknown people (\"I'm in a [waiting room] where patients are coming in all the time. Nobody is walking round with a label or a badge on saying 'I've just been to Mexico'\"). In contrast, other participants sought advice due to concern that they might expose others. For example, one commented that \"I work with children all day, so it's more for my fear that if I've got something like that, then it would go amongst children,\" while another explained that \"I just phoned up to make sure that I didn't have [swine flu]..., because I was visiting my parents and they're quite elderly and I was a bit worried.\"",

While previous reports have highlighted the need for strategies that are designed to reduce the number of unexposed patients who seek care in future incidents, surprisingly little is known about the factors which produce this 'surge' of patients [5, 6] A common perception has previously been that such patients are \"the worried well.\" [e.g. [7, 8] ] However, our results suggest that this is inaccurate. For our participants, the presence of worry or a desire for 'peace of mind' were only some of the motivations that were cited for seeking advice: worry was by no means a necessary prerequisite for someone making contact with NHS Direct.
