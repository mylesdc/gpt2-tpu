In this report, we describe the discovery and genomic characterization of partetraviruses in bovine and ovine samples from China. These partetraviruses were detected by PCR in 1.8% of bovine liver samples, 66.7% of ovine liver samples and 71.4% of ovine spleen samples. One of the bovine partetraviruses detected in the present samples is phylogenetically distinct from previously reported bovine partetraviruses and likely represents a novel genotype. The ovine partetravirus is a novel partetravirus and phylogenetically most related to the bovine partetraviruses. The genome organization is conserved amongst these viruses, including the presence of a putative transmembrane protein encoded by an overlapping reading frame in ORF2. Results from the present study provide further support to the classification of partetraviruses as a separate genus in Parvovirinae.",

            "text": "The parvoviruses are a group of small, non-enveloped animal viruses with a single-stranded DNA genome between 4 and 6 kb in size [1] . At least 2 open reading frames (ORF) are present in the parvovirus genome, with ORF1 encoding the non-structural proteins and ORF2 encoding the viral capsid proteins. Some parvovirus genomes may contain an additional ORF encoding for other proteins, such as the non-structural protein NP1 found in human bocavirus and bovine parvovirus. Under the current International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) classification system, the Parvoviridae are divided into two subfamilies based on their host range: the Parvovirinae which infect vertebrates, and the Densovirinae which mainly infect insects and other arthropods. The Parvovirinae are further subdivided into 5 genera: the amdoviruses, bocaviruses, dependoviruses, erythroviruses, and the parvoviruses. Novel parvoviruses discovered in recent years, such as the human partetravirus (previously known as human parvovirus 4 or PARV4) [2] , are not included in the current classification system, and will be addressed by the ICTV in an upcoming update. Some human parvoviruses are well-known pathogens associated with a range of diseases in infected patients. Parvovirus B19 (also known as erythrovirus B19) can cause syndromes ranging from erythema infectiosum in children to late intrauterine death in pregnant women. The human bocavirus, a parvovirus discovered only in 2005, was associated with respiratory disease and could be detected in stool of children [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] , although clear assessment of its pathogenicity is confounded by the frequent codetection of other respiratory viruses [9, 10] and its presence in the stool of healthy children. On the other hand, the human partetravirus was initially discovered in patients suffering from acute viral syndrome [2] , but its association with clinical disease has yet to be confirmed despite positive PCR detection in blood products, HIV-infected patients, intravenous drug users, transplant patients and blood donors in different localities [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18] .",

We first reported the discovery of porcine and bovine partetraviruses (also known as hokoviruses previously), which are novel related animal parvoviruses found in Hong Kong [19] . Closely related porcine partetraviruses have since been found in German wild boar populations [20] , while human partetravirus-like viral DNA was detected in the plasma samples of a chimpanzee and baboon in Cameroon [21] . As the genetic distances between human partetravirus and other known parvoviruses at the time of its discovery were relatively large, it was unclear if the human partetravirus had diverged from a human parvovirus ancestor early in the history of parvovirus evolution or if it had diverged from an undiscovered animal parvovirus. Parvovirus evolution is characterized by the development of host-specificity and congruent viral and host phylogenies [22] , which has led to the hypothesis of long-term co-evolution of parvoviruses and their hosts. In addition, evolutionary rates can vary significantly among different parvovirus species [23, 24] , which complicates evolutionary analysis between distant parvoviruses. Hence, the identification of related partetraviruses in animals has contributed to our knowledge of the evolutionary history of the human partetravirus.",

Similar to our earlier attempt at sequencing the complete genomes of other PARV4-like animal parvoviruses [19] , the obtained genome lengths were shorter than expected, as sequencing of the ends of the genomes was hampered by the presence of extensive hairpin structures. Pairwise comparison of the genome sequences of the parvoviruses was performed. Among the presently identified bovine partetraviruses, HK4 was highly similar (99.3299.4% nucleotide sequence identity) to the bovine partetraviruses reported previously, while HK5 showed much greater sequence divergence (90.0-90.1% nucleotide sequence identity). The genome sequences of the ovine parvoviruses were 100% identical, and they exhibited 68.2-68.3% nucleotide sequence identities to that of the bovine partetraviruses and around 64.0% nucleotide sequence identities to that of the porcine partetraviruses. Results of further sequence comparison with related parvoviruses were shown in Tables 1 and 2. All sequenced virus strains possessed a genome organization typical of parvoviruses. There were two large non-overlapping ORFs, with ORF1 encoding a non-structural polyprotein NS1 and ORF2 encoding overlapping VP1/VP2 capsid proteins and a small conserved putative protein. A small non-coding gap of around 115 nucleotides was found between the two ORFs. Inverted terminal repeats were found at the 59 and 39 ends of the viral genome. Further sequence analysis was not performed for the bovine partetravirus HK4 due to its high genetic similarity with previously characterized bovine partetraviruses. For bovine partetravirus HK5, the predicted NS1 protein consists of 652 aa and is 73.9 kDa in molecular weight. Conserved sequence features including helicase and ATPase domains are present, in agreement with the non-structural functional role of NS1 in parvovirus replication. The VP1 protein is predicted to contain 931 aa and is 102.8 kDa in molecular weight, which is comparable to that of previously identified bovine partetraviruses and larger than the Similar to other partetraviruses, there exists a putative third ORF in a different reading frame within the VP1u region for both bovine partetravirus HK5 and ovine parvovirus. In agreement with previous studies, the phospholipase A 2 motifs of ORF2 are found in the VP1u region, which is also the most conserved region among partetraviruses [19, 35] . The putative third ORF encodes a small protein containing a single transmembrane helix spanning 20 aa in the centre, with predicted molecular weights of 9.5 kDa in bovine partetravirus HK5 and 9.7 kDa in ovine parvovirus. The aa sequences of this putative protein are conserved among human, bovine, ovine and porcine partetraviruses, with pairwise sequence identities ranging from 59.3% (between porcine partetravirus HK7 and ovine partetravirus) to 96.4% (between bovine partetravirus HK1 and bovine partetravirus HK5).",

Bovine partetraviruses HK4 and HK5 formed a cluster with known bovine partetraviruses, although the genetic distance between HK5 and the other bovine partetraviruses suggested that it should be considered as a different genotype of bovine partetravirus. The 4 identical strains of ovine parvovirus are clearly shown to be distinct from the other known partetraviruses, and are most closely related to bovine partetraviruses. Based on these results, we recognize these ovine parvoviruses as a new member of the partetraviruses and propose to describe them as ovine partetraviruses.

Although no clear association has been found between clinical disease and human partetraviruses, the relatively high prevalence of PARV4 in human blood products has raised safety concerns, especially since available evidence appears to support possible parenteral transmission of the virus [14, 36, 37, 38, 39] . Similarly, animal partetraviruses have not been found to be associated with any clinical diseases in the hosts, and are detected frequently in apparently healthy animals [19, 20, 21] . So far, these viruses were mostly detected in liver, spleen, lymph node and bone marrow, suggesting significant tropism for lymphoid tissue, although there is also a report of detecting PARV4 DNA at relatively high frequencies in other organs such as the heart, lungs and kidneys [12] . The development of immune electron microscopy and related techniques can determine the intracellular location and cellular tropism of partetraviruses in infected tissues, and success have been reported with the visualization of PARV4 particles in a high-titre-positive plasma sample [40] . This will aid efforts to target screening for subclinical disease in patients or animals with positive partetravirus detection by PCR or serology.",

Initially, parvoviruses were thought to evolve slowly relative to RNA viruses due to the utilization of the high-fidelity host DNA polymerase during replication. This was also supported by the very limited sequence diversity of the human pathogenic parvovirus B19 that were known at the time. However, studies examining the evolutionary rate of different parvoviruses suggested that the evolutionary rates of parvoviruses are generally fast and comparable to those of RNA viruses. Moreover, a broad range of rates have been observed for different viruses: 1.7610 24 substitution/site/year (s/s/yr) in canine parvovirus, 9.4610 25 s/ s/yr in the closely related feline panleukopenia parvovirus [23] , 8.6610 24 s/s/yr in human bocavirus [41] , 1610 24 s/s/yr in parvovirus B19 [42] . In particular, it has been inferred that the evolutionary rate were as high as 0.727.1610 23 s/s/yr during the time interval from which canine parvovirus emerged. The discovery of additional genotypes of parvovirus B19 has also bolstered the view of parvoviruses as fast-evolving viruses [43, 44] .",

            "text": "Nonetheless, questions remain on certain aspects of parvovirus evolution. Although virus-host co-evolution had been proposed as an important mechanism in the emergence of new animal parvoviruses [22] , this hypothesis cannot be easily reconciled with the high evolutionary rates observed in diverse parvoviruses, as the evolutionary timescale of the genetic distance between the animal hosts would be several orders of magnitude greater than that of the genetic distance between the corresponding parvoviruses. While the effects of negative selection on parvoviruses highly adapted to their animal host may slow further evolution of the virus, it is unlike to account for the discrepancy between host and virus evolution to a significant degree. In comparison, observations on the emergence of canine parvovirus from feline panleukopenia parvovirus [45] and the experimental cross-species infection of rodent parvoviruses provide more support to the role of crossspecies transmission in the evolution of parvoviruses. This would also be more consistent with the degree of recombination seen in diverse parvoviruses [46] , which would have required frequent cross-species transmission and co-infection of different parvoviruses in the same host [47] . The present detection of these partetraviruses in organs of otherwise healthy animals suggests the possibility of viral persistence, although comprehensive sampling of other sites such as the respiratory tract would be needed to exclude acute infections. Relatively little is known about persistence of partetraviruses in animal hosts, although the phenomenon is well-described for other parvoviruses. Genomic DNA of human erythrovirus genotype 1 has been found to persist in the synovial membranes of both patients with chronic arthropathy and healthy individuals [48] . A larger study has additionally uncovered information on the distribution and persistence among different genotypes of human erythrovirus, which revealed the epidemiological history of these genotypes in the human population [49] . The exact mechanism for viral persistence has not been fully elucidated for many parvoviruses, though site-specific integration has been described for adeno-associated viruses [50] . Among the partetraviruses, the phenomenon of persistence is best studied in the human partetravirus genotype PARV4, which has been found in the blood, lymphoid tissue and bone marrow of HIV-infected patients [12, 18] . Results from interferon c enzyme-linked immunospot assays suggested that PARV4 persistence may be present at 26% of hepatitis C virus-positive individuals [51] .",

The distinct cluster formation by these related viruses on phylogenetic trees argue for the consideration of the viruses to be classified in a new genus, which has already been suggested in a current ICTV taxonomic proposal.

The overall dN/dS as calculated by the SLAC method were 0.130 for both ORF1 and ORF2. The present results are consistent with the biological functions of the viral proteins, as VP2 (encoded by ORF2) is responsible for receptor binding and would be under greater selection pressure for host adaptation and immune evasion. The significance of these identified sites wouldTable 2. Pairwise ORF2 sequence comparison of bovine and ovine partetraviruses (PtV) with related parvoviruses (PV).",
