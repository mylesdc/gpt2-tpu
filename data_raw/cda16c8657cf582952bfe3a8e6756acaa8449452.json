It is generally believed that the interaction between different infectious agents plays an important role in regard to respiratory diseases. Therefore, we used high-throughput sequencing combined with viral metagenomics to characterise the viral community of tonsil samples from pigs coming from a conventional herd with lesions in the respiratory tract at slaughter. In parallel, samples from specific pathogen-free pigs were also analysed. This study showed a variable co-infection rate in the different pigs. The differences were not seen at the group level but in individual pigs. Some viruses such as adenoviruses and certain picornaviruses could be found in most pigs, while others such as different parvoviruses and anelloviruses were only identified in a few pigs. In addition, the complete coding region of porcine parvovirus 7 was obtained, as were the complete genomes of two teschoviruses. The results from this study will aid in elucidating which viruses are circulating in both healthy pigs and in pigs associated with respiratory illness. This knowledge is needed for future investigations into the role of viral-viral interactions in relation to disease development.",

            "text": "Viral infections are of major concern within the pig production industry, in that they cause not only severe disease but also subclinical infections [1, 2] that can have severe economic consequences [3, 4] . It is becoming evident that a number of factors, including multiple microorganisms, often act synergistically to create a certain clinical picture. This is particularly evident in, for example, complex respiratory and enteric diseases. Known major respiratory viruses include porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), swine Influenza A virus (swine AIV), and pseudorabies virus (PRV); porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) and porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) are also believed to be involved [1, 2] . It is highly plausible that other viruses could be of importance as well, but they have been overlooked. Some reasons for this could be that diagnostic labs are not searching actively for them, because they are not believed to be involved in respiratory diseases, or because they have not even been discovered yet. Additionally, it is known that the combination of viruses and/or bacteria, as well as different management and environmental factors, are of importance. A viral infection that under certain circumstances does not cause any apparent problems for the infected host can, under other circumstances, have severe consequences. Considering this, it is important not only to identify individual viruses in a host but also to investigate the entire viral community.",

To understand complex diseases and the role that different viruses may or may not play, we need to identify which viruses are circulating in the porcine population regardless of health status. Thereby, we could possibly identify viruses that make up a basal virome at different ages, in different herds, in connection to different health statuses, etc. This knowledge could be used to understand the effects of different viral-coinfections. In pursuit of this goal, we also investigated the virome of specific pathogen-free (SPF) pigs.",

In brief, eight tonsils from SPF pigs (Yorkshire \u00d7 Landrace) originating from a herd (Serogrisen, Ransta, Sweden) declared free from major swine pathogens [13] were collected. The viruses the SPF pigs were declared free from included swine AIV, PRRSV, PRV, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, African swine fever virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, foot and mouth disease virus, rabies virus, classical swine fever virus, swine vesicular disease virus, and transmissible gastroenteritis virus. Similarly, eight tonsils were obtained from conventionally reared pigs from a farrow-to-finish herd with a high prevalence of respiratory lesions (pneumonia and pleuritic) registered in the respiratory tract of the pigs at slaughter. Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) was known to be present in both herds, but there were no clinical signs of PCV2-associated diseases.

The selection was mainly based on the number of reads and their distribution across the viral genome.

Using this method, the coverage of the genomes was obtained, and, in the case of complete coverage, the consensus sequence was extracted. In the case of porcine parvovirus 7 (PPV7), primers were designed based on the mapped reads to cover the gaps and low coverage regions. The complete PPV7 viral genome was amplified using the KAPA LongRange HotStart PCR Kit (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) according to the following protocol: 25 \u00b5L reaction mixture of 1\u00d7 PCR buffer, 1.5 mM MgCl 2 , 0.2 mM dNTP, 0.5 mM of each primer, and 0.625U KAPA LongRange HotStart DNA Polymerase.

The PCR products were purified with the Thermo Fisher PCR purification kit (Waltham, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions and were sent for sequencing at Macrogen. The sequences were assembled using SeqMan (Lasergene 9, DNASTAR, Madison, WI, USA). The phylogenetic analyses were performed using MEGA7 [15] .

These were subsequently used for annotation and downstream analysis. The annotation showed the presence of a large number of vertebrate viruses, including both DNA and RNA viruses, in each individual pig (Table 1 ). In total, viruses from nine families were identified, and in the majority of these families, not only one but several different genera were recovered. Members of the Adenoviridae and Picornaviridae family could be detected in all or in nearly all pigs in the study, while other families such as Circoviridae and Caliciviridae were less common. The reads/contigs annotated to each virus could, in some cases, such as that of teschovirus (see more details below), cover the complete genome, while for others, only a few number of short single reads matched. In the coming sections, a number of the viruses identified will be described more in detail. Table 1 . Viruses identified in the viral metagenomic analysis.

However, for several of them, larger mastadenovirus contigs were produced. In one case, a contig of 11,576 base pairs was identified. For porcine mastadenovirus A, the trimmed HTS reads, from the dataset (S7) with the most adenovirus sequences identified, was mapped back to the most similar porcine adenovirus 3 genome found in the GenBank (AB026117.1) to see if more of the genome could be recovered. However, even with this approach, it was impossible to recover the complete genome, and only approximately 60% coverage was achieved. However, the reads were spread out across the genome and a 90-100% identity on the nucleotide level and 78-100% identity on the amino acid level were observed. As mentioned, porcine mastadenovirus B was also identified in 10 animals, showing high sequence identity to porcine adenovirus 4.

Major viral pathogens associated with respiratory disease are PRRSV, PRV, and swine AIV, which are all known to induce respiratory disease and lesions. Other viruses such as paramyxovirus (PMV), porcine cytomegalovirus (PCMV), PCV2, PRCV, and TTSuV are considered minor pathogens that could play a role through co-infection or in combination with other outer factors [1, 2] . In this study, none of the viruses considered major pathogens were detected, which was partly expected, as Sweden has been declared free from PRRSV and PRV.

The viruses that differed between the two groups were porcine lymphotrophic herpes virus 1, adeno-associated virus, unclassified circovirus, and porcine sapelovirus A and sapovirus, which were only present in conventionally reared pigs, while TTSuV2 only was detected in one SPF pig. The fact that many of the viruses were found in both groups was not surprising, as many studies have shown a high co-infection rate of several viruses in both healthy pigs and in pigs with different disease complexes [14, 18, 19] . Many respiratory viruses are also known to be ubiquitous in pig populations. It is possible that viral load could play a role in the development of clinical signs, but also that co-infections could have a synergistic effect. For example, enhanced respiratory disease development has been seen in co-infection situations with PRRSV and viruses such as PRCV [20, 21] , swine AIV [21] , and PCV2 [22, 23] . The exact mechanisms behind this are not always clear, but it is known that suppression of the immune system and alteration of cytokine responses can be important [24] . Some viruses can also affect macrophage function [25, 26] . Considering that different viruses affect the host in different ways, the order that viruses infect their hosts could be important for particular outcomes, hence making them very complicated to study. Furthermore, bacteria are also known to induce respiratory disease, either alone or through viral-bacterial/bacterial-bacterial interactions [1, 2] . In addition, migration of parasites through the lungs may also aggravate signs of respiratory diseases.",

For example, adenoviruses were present in all pigs, and 16 out of 18 pigs were positive for picornaviruses. Porcine adenovirus is ubiquitous throughout the world; although the virus has been isolated in connection to disease investigations, it is not considered a major pathogen but rather is believed to often result in subclinical infection [27] . There are three species of porcine adenovirus recognised: porcine mastadenovirus A (porcine adenovirus 1-3), porcine mastadenovirus B (porcine adenovirus 4), and porcine mastadenovirus C (porcine adenovirus 5) [28] . Of these, porcine adenovirus 3 and 4 were identified in the different samples from this study. A total of 94% of the pigs were positive for porcine adenovirus 3 and 63% for porcine adenovirus 4. No sequence reads were classified as porcine adenovirus 5. There is a lack of complete genomes of adenoviruses available, making the classification of the reads in this kind of dataset difficult. It is likely, for example, that many of the reads referred to as \"other mastadenovirus\" in Table 1 could be porcine adenovirus 4 but have been classified as \"other mastadenovirus\" because only the fibre, pVIII, E1B 55K, and DNA repeat region have been previously sequenced. The dataset may also contain more divergent porcine adenovirus/es that are not classified in any of the present genera.",

We have previously, using metagenomics, discovered porcine bocavirus 1 [9, 16] in Swedish pigs; PBoV3 has also been shown to be present in Sweden [14] . The pathogenicity of these viruses is not well known, and they have been detected in both healthy pigs and in pigs suffering from both respiratory and enteric diseases [29] . In our study, there was no major difference in the detection rate of these viruses between the two groups. In four of the samples, an additional parvovirus, porcine parvovirus 7, was identified. This virus was first detected in 2016 from a rectal swab collected from an adult pig in the US and showed a very low identity to any known parvovirus [30] . The virus in that study was detected in different sample types and at a detection rate of 8.6%. Since that first discovery, this virus has also been identified in China [31] . The non-structural protein of the PPV7 characterised in Sweden showed a high degree of similarity (93.1-94.6%) to the US and China isolates, while the capsid was more divergent, with a nucleotide identity of 84.7-86.8%. The potential role of this virus in connection to disease has yet to be determined.",

Picornaviruses can cause subclinical infection, as well as diseases ranging from those with mild symptoms such as fever to more severe diseases [32] . In two of the conventionally reared pigs, a high number of teschoviral reads were identified, enabling the assembly of two complete genomes. Porcine teschovirus is endemic in pigs worldwide, and there are 13 known serotypes [28] . Often the infection is subclinical, but PTV-1 is associated with encephalomyelitis (Teschen disease). PTV2, PTV3, and PTV5 have been associated with a milder version called Talfan disease [32] . The viruses identified in these two pigs showed were most similar to PTV-10, which has not been associated with disease, and whether they belong to the serotype 10 remains to be determined.",
