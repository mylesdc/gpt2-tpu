            "text": "Progress in combatting zoonoses that emerge from wildlife is often constrained by limited knowledge of the biology of pathogens within reservoir hosts. We focus on the host-pathogen dynamics of four emerging viruses associated with bats: Hendra, Nipah, Ebola, and Marburg viruses. Spillover of bat infections to humans and domestic animals often coincides with pulses of viral excretion within bat populations, but the mechanisms driving such pulses are unclear. Three hypotheses dominate current research on these emerging bat infections. First, pulses of viral excretion could reflect seasonal epidemic cycles driven by natural variations in population densities and contact rates among hosts. If lifelong immunity follows recovery, viruses may disappear locally but persist globally through migration; in either case, new outbreaks occur once births replenish the susceptible pool. Second, epidemic cycles could be the result of waning immunity within bats, allowing local circulation of viruses through oscillating herd immunity. Third, pulses could be generated by episodic shedding from persistently infected bats through a combination of physiological and ecological factors. The three scenarios can yield similar patterns in epidemiological surveys, but strategies to predict or manage spillover risk resulting from each scenario will be different. We outline an agenda for research on viruses emerging from bats that would allow for differentiation among the scenarios and inform development of evidence-based interventions to limit threats to human and animal health. These concepts and methods are applicable to a wide range of pathogens that affect humans, domestic animals, and wildlife.",

We outline three distinct scenarios that could generate pulses of viral excretion in bats (Figs 1 and 2) . Although the scenarios fall along a continuum, each one leads to a different set of hypotheses that can be tested in the field or laboratory. Within-and between-host processes drive the first and second scenarios: pulses of transmission among bats with clearance of infection and either long-term ( Fig 1A) or waning immunity ( Fig 1B) . Within-host processes drive the third scenario, with pulses triggered by viral reactivation in persistently infected bats (Fig 1C) . A common driver among the three scenarios is seasonal forcing, which occurs through birth pulses, seasonal transmission, waning maternal immunity in young, and periods of environmental or physiological stress (Fig 2) . Research efforts often reflect the working hypothesis that pulses are driven by between-host transmission or that pulses are driven by within-host processes of reactivation, but often without using data collection methods that would allow them to be distinguished [5, [13] [14] [15] [16] . In reality, the evidence for either hypothesis has not been fully assessed for the emerging viruses discussed here.",

Second, experimental infections may be unsuccessful at reproducing natural infections in bats. For example, after Hendra virus and Nipah virus were isolated, amplified, and experimentally inoculated into bats, viral excretion was rarely detected [25, 26] , although interpretations were hampered because lifetime infection histories of wild caught bats were unknown.

This assumption may be derived from evidence of persistent flavivirus and Rio Bravo virus infections during experiments conducted in the 1960s and 1970s [38, 39] , and a common paradigm that reservoir hosts carry persistent infections (e.g., hantavirus in rodents and simian immunodeficiency virus [SIV] in primates [40, 41] ). More recently, simultaneous shedding of several viruses (and sometimes bacteria) from many individuals was observed during pulses of excretion [e.g., [42] [43] [44] ; this observation could be explained by within-host persistence. Some features of the immune systems of bats appear to be different from those of other mammals, and this has fueled speculation that bats may host persistent infections [16] . For example, the set point of interferon responses in bats appears to be relatively high compared to other mammals [45] . The latter is consistent with the possibility that bats rapidly control viral replication, thus avoiding the pathological consequences of disease observed in other species [45] . Moreover, it has been proposed that bats can coexist with pathogens due to adaptations inadvertently acquired during the evolution of flight [46] [47] [48] . Despite this growing body of research on batpathogen interactions, there is no direct evidence that henipaviruses or filoviruses persistently infect their bat hosts.",

Second, persistent latent or low-level infections from which virus can be reactivated may become established in bats [13] . In theory, persistent bat viruses could reactivate in response to processes that affect host immunity, such as stress, pregnancy, or poor nutrition [5, 14] . Whether a particular individual clears infection or remains persistently or latently infected may depend on immune status, dose received, coinfections, route of infection, history of infection, and individual variation-all factors that may differ amongst individuals and through time [18] .",

Nevertheless, the different cellular interactions between viruses and reservoir hosts versus incidental hosts may lead to different mechanisms of persistence. For example, the ability of bats to control viral replication may limit the capacity of viruses such as Hendra and Nipah to spread to the central nervous system of bats. In general, characterization of host pathogen dynamics in a spillover host does not provide evidence for the dynamics being similar in reservoir hosts [5, 27] . Recrudescent Nipah virus infection was reported in a bat, but the evidence presented was weak and alternative explanations were not ruled out [13] .",

In the 1960s Sulkin et al. [53] described recurrent viremias in bats and susceptibility to reinfection with Japanese B encephalitis virus, establishing a paradigm for bats as hosts of recurrent infections. By contrast, repeat challenge studies with Rabies virus in one bat species confronted our assumptions about the universal lethality of rabies virus in mammals. Although some individual bats experienced acute, lethal infections, other individuals survived with protective immunity and never shed virus [54] . Contemporary work on emerging bat viruses has been less conclusive. Bats challenged with Marburg virus seroconverted and were protected from viral replication when rechallenged 48 days later, suggesting some short-term protection after recovery from acute viremia [32] . In contrast, 50% of bats inoculated with Hendra or Nipah virus seroconverted, and there was no consistent relation between seroconversion and recovery of viral genome [25] . Moreover, in another study, bats excreted Nipah virus in urine while neutralizing antibody was present in the serum [26] . Together, these studies indicated that antibodies may not be the primary driver of henipavirus clearance in bats [55] . Reinfection experiments with Nipah virus were inconclusive; most bats did not respond to the first inoculation with productive infections [25] . Waning prevalence of Hendra virus antibody was reported in a maternity colony of Pteropus scapulatus over six months [9] , and waning maternal henipavirus antibodies have been reported in numerous systems [e.g., 9, 56, 57] , but the effective protection conferred by these antibodies was not determined. The association between antibodies and Ebola viral nucleic acids in samples from bats was unclear [58] .",

Transmission events cannot be observed directly, viral infections of reservoir hosts may be asymptomatic, and sampling of individuals through time is difficult. Therefore, inferences must be drawn from multiple sources of indirect evidence. Bat viruses have been detected in urine, feces, saliva, and soiled fruit, indicating the potential for virus transmission via excreta between bats in the wild [5, 59] . However, under laboratory conditions, bat-to-bat transmission for most of these viruses is difficult to achieve (Table 2 ) [e.g., 32]. Following experimental inoculations, viral shedding by bats for both Nipah and Hendra viruses was minimal [25] , although continuous exposure to a low-dose viral rain may increase the probability of infection [5] . Natural and experimental vertical transmission of Hendra virus has been documented, but inconsistently and under specific conditions, such as parenteral inoculation (but not oronasal inoculation) [25, 29] . A few longitudinal serological and virological surveys and theoretical models have proposed that seasonal patterns in incidence or spillover could be explained by peaks of transmission in response to demographic or ecological drivers such as birth pulses, waning maternal immunity, and migration [12, 15, 60, 61] , but these proposed dynamics have not been confirmed.",

The dynamics of Hendra virus and Nipah virus, which are also paramyxoviruses, have been assumed to be similar to those of measles and distemper [e.g., 15]. A recent model of filoviruses in bats similarly assumed that SIR dynamics characterized Ebola and Marburg viruses in bats [60] . In the absence of antigenic evolution, SIR pathogens render recovered hosts immune. Therefore, epidemic pulses can only occur after births or immigration have replenished the pool of susceptible individuals [17] . Large, regular outbreaks of zoonotic viruses within bat populations could occur through local viral extinction and then recolonization, seasonal aggregations, or the influx of susceptible juveniles [5, 15, 60] .",

Replacement of susceptible individuals from within populations also contributes to endemic persistence of pathogens in small populations. Whether this scenario may occur in bats has not been explored.

However, seroprevalence is a poor metric for quantifying epidemic dynamics. If antibodies persist within bats, seroprevalence measures cumulative exposure. If antibody persistence exceeds the period over which hosts move between populations, then antibody prevalence may not reflect the epidemic history of the sampled population, but simply the infection history of the individual [63] .

(2) The period over which individuals are resampled must exceed that of the infectious period (and therefore the infectious period must be known). (3) The host's lifetime must far exceed the infectious period. (4) Pathogen must be detectable without lethal sampling. It is our contention that, if these conditions are met, it should be possible to distinguish among scenarios. In a population with waning immunity and cyclical reinfection, the probability that a given individual becomes infected is expected to be equal to the prevalence of infection among other individuals of similar age and the same sex. Therefore, past infection status is not expected to predict present infection status. In contrast, if individuals are persistently infected but shed episodically, the prevalence of infection among previously positive individuals will be higher than among the population, and past infection increases the likelihood of positive infection status (Table 1) . However, large sample sizes and intermediate levels of prevalence probably are required to distinguish cyclical reinfection from persistent infections, and alternative explanations for patterns of prevalence may be difficult to reject. For example, the individuals most likely to be exposed may appear to be persistently infected. In this case, complementing longitudinal sampling with sequence data may improve inferences.",

Viral reintroduction followed by extinction could result in pulses with low levels of viral diversity (Fig 3A) . In contrast, pulses driven by reactivation may contain higher viral diversity given the longer evolutionary history of the virus in the population (Fig 3B) . The opposite pattern is expected in comparisons of viral diversity across multiple pulses. Each pulse of reintroduced viruses is more likely to represent a different viral lineage, but reactivated viruses may be similar among pulses. Therefore, reintroduced pulses are expected to create low lineage diversity within an outbreak, but higher lineage diversity among outbreaks. The opposite could be expected for pulses driven by reactivation. For example, diverse lineages of Marburg virus circulated simultaneously within and among bat colonies in Uganda across years [67] , a pattern that is more consistent with persistence within hosts and reactivation than pulses of reintroduction, which would require simultaneous extinction-recolonization of multiple strains. Information on viral diversity should ideally be coupled with knowledge of the landscape-level and host community-level distribution of viral lineages, enabling inference to the geographic or species origins of viral reintroductions to focal populations [68] .",

Because viral evolutionary rates can be estimated for many species or can be approximated from better-studied related viruses [69] , internal branches of the phylogenetic tree connecting pulses of infection in the same bat population may be too long to be plausible under a model of reactivation. Moreover, because neutral evolutionary rates are likely to be slow while viruses are latent, even less evolutionary distance would be expected between pulses driven by reactivation compared to viruses that circulate continuously over the same timespan [70, 71] . Predictions of coalescent theory may also help identify recolonizing viruses because viral effective population size is expected to be driven by transmission between individuals [72] . Therefore, effective population sizes are expected to increase exponentially during pulses driven by reintroduction and between-host transmission but may appear stable in pulses driven by reactivation [73] . However, this effect may dissipate if reactivated infections of a few individuals drive a more extensive outbreak with betweenindividual transmission (i.e., pulses that are driven by multiple mechanisms). Also, as with any such analysis, reconstructions of effective population size depend on a number of epidemiological and evolutionary factors (e.g., selection) as well as sampling effort, so they must be considered with some caution [72] .",

In this regard, sequencing both neutrally evolving and selected parts of the viral genome would be advantageous and is increasingly practical with advances in whole genome sequencing [74] . These methods will be most powerful in rapidly evolving RNA viruses that are temporally and spatially sampled, but this requires major investment in field sampling of highly mobile species like bats, particularly when the prevalence of detection of viral genomes can be low.

Assuming an SIR scenario for Filoviruses in Rousettus aegyptiacus bats, Hayman [60] investigated the relative importance of parameters controlling bat life history and infection dynamics, highlighting the key role played by the biannual birth pulses that are characteristic of this species. Plowright et al. [15] used models to demonstrate that Hendra virus prevalence and seroprevalence studies were inadequate to distinguish between SIR or SILI dynamics in fruit bats. Although models cannot prove a certain epidemiological scenario exists, they can identify patterns that may help distinguish between scenarios, and therefore parameters, that are important to measure in the natural systems.

We propose that multiple processes can lead to similar spatial and temporal patterns in prevalence and seroprevalence data, and, to our knowledge, existing empirical data often are insufficient to identify the underlying mechanisms. We encourage researchers to collect appropriate data to identify the scenarios driving pulses of excretion of emerging bat viruses because strategies to predict or reduce spillover risk should depend on the mechanisms' underlying dynamics (Table 1) . Current management strategies include dispersing bats, culling bats, preventing contact between bats and spillover hosts, or vaccinating spillover hosts [80, 81] . With the exception of equine vaccination for Hendra virus, few data exist on the efficacy of these strategies. Simulations combined with knowledge of bat virus dynamics can be used to assess the relative effectiveness of each strategy and identify situations in which management action may be counterproductive. For example, culling bats may decrease spillover risk if transmission of the virus increases as population size increases (SIR dynamics), whereas culling may increase spillover risk if pulses are driven by viral reactivation after stress (SILI dynamics). Dispersing bat colonies has clear potential for unintended consequences if pulses are driven by recolonization (SIR dynamics) or by viral reactivation (SILI dynamics). Predicting pulses driven by SIR, SIRS, or SILI dynamics may require information on herd immunity, withinand between-group transmission, and environmental stress, respectively. Thus, the research with the greatest potential to inform prediction and management of spillover varies among scenarios (Table 1) .",

Different shapes represent different viral strains within a population and different colors within a shape reflect variation within strains that have a recent common ancestor. (A) In the case of SIR/SIRS dynamics, acute infections are reintroduced and then cleared at the population level between each pulse. At each point in time, the pathogen within individuals in the population either has the same genotype (e.g., blue circles at pulse 1, red squares at pulse 2) or has closely related genotypes with a common ancestor (matching shape but different color). (B) In the case of SILI dynamics, individuals remain infected over time. Genetic diversity is determined in part by within-host viral evolution. Therefore, genotypes are likely to differ among individuals (many unique shape and color combinations, with some consistency over time).

(C) In a scenario of viral extinction and reintroduction, all strains at a given pulse are closely related and have a recent common ancestor.
