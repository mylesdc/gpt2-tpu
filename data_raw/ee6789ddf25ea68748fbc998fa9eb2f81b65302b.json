It has a land area of ~720 square kilometres and its mainland spans 50km from east to west and 27km from north to south [1] . Like many other highly urbanised cities, most residents live in high-rise apartment flats with many neighbours. Despite intensive eradication efforts, the Aedes mosquitoes (Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus) remain at large in these living environments [2, 3] . The close proximity of these mosquitoes and humans allow for more interactions between them which may trigger arbovirus outbreaks such as dengue [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] , Chikungunya [5, 9, 10] , and Zika [11] . The mild clinical severity of most Zika infections may allow an ambulant infected individual to seed new foci of infection [12] [13] [14] , e.g. around their workplace or school. This is particularly salient as the small size of the country means the distance travelled from home to work in Singapore constitutes a larger fraction of the country's size than in most other countries at risk of arboviruses. As a result, the transmission patterns of vector-borne disease may be more comparable to other high-urban cities than to other countries.",

From the Singapore census in 2010 [15] , 87% of the population relies on some means of transport to get to work or school, of whom about 57% regularly use the public transport to get to school/work. Most public transport is paid for using a contactless payment card (commonly called an EZ-link card) that allows capture of transport usage data, including the times and locations of trips. All trips made over a one-month period (August 2013) were provided as anonymous data by the Land Transport Authority of Singapore. From these, we extracted out all records in which a trip started or ended within a 1km square cantered on the initial outbreak focus. For each card (which we treated as equivalent to a unique individual: although cards are transferable, commonly individuals retain a single card for years) in this reduced dataset, we inferred primary and secondary addresses based on the following algorithm, which we labelled their home and work location, respectively.",

When an individual neglected to 'tap out' at the end of a journey, as can happen on buses, there is no end point recorded for the journey, and for such journeys, only the start point was used. We extracted the card number for any trip that started or ended within a 1km square centred on the initial focus of the outbreak in Aljunied.

We then identified the point among these with the highest summed kernel to be the imputed home location. Bus stops are typically located quite close to one another and to high density urban neighbourhoods where most Singaporeans live, so the error between the actual home and imputed home is likely to be of the order of a few hundred meters.",

Consequently, these challenges make defining the likelihood function of the parameters difficult. To address these challenges, we developed a Bayesian data augmentation framework which considers the source of infection as augmented data or nuisance parameters [16] . In this analysis, the parameter space includes the unknown source of infection, following the approach of Gibson and colleagues [17] . The parameters in the model are defined in the table below. ",
