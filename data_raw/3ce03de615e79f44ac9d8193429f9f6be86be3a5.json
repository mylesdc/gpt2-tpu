Lower limit of detection studies using whole virus particles demonstrated that sensitivity for assays was in the range of 1-2 copies per reaction. No cross reactivity was observed with a number of commonly encountered viral strains. Proficiency panels showed 100% concordance with the expected results and the assays performed as well as, if not better than, other assays used in laboratories worldwide.

After initial assay validation the method was then used to test clinical samples obtained during the 2016/ 2017 dengue 2 outbreak on Vanuatu. Traditional detection of flaviviruses and alphaviruses in clinical samples has largely relied on Enzyme Immuno Assays. It is well established that EIA assays for ZIKV virus show a high degree of cross reactivity with dengue positive samples [26] . In addition, it has been shown that dengue IgG and IgM assays can cross react with ZIKV-positive patient samples [27] . Furthermore, conventional Enzyme Immuno Assays are unable to differentiate between the individual DENV serotypes and are generally less sensitive than molecular assays. Other methods of detecting unknown aetiological agents of disease include the use of microarrays fabricated with large numbers of oligonucleotides probes specific for individual pathogens. Hybridisation of clinical samples to such arrays can be used to detect the presence of viral genomes in infected individuals [28] . In addition, with the advent of next generation sequencing and the continuing reduction of costs associated with this technology it is now feasible to apply this method to viral discovery [29] . However, these new methods are still more costly, time consuming and lack the sensitivity when compared to more established methods such as RT-PCR, which can generate positive signals in around 1 hour.",

Similar geographical patterns are also seen with 3base technology and its application to dengue diagnosis alphaviruses. One advantage of the current pan-flavivirus/pan-alphavirus/pan-dengue screening test is that the assays can be used in any global region to quickly detect the presence of an unknown viral infection. Once a viral family has been identified, individual typing reactions can be used to determine the pathogen responsible for disease.

It was reported that between 2012 and 2014, dengue (serotypes 1-4), CHIKV and ZIKV viruses were circulating in the region with over 120,000 people infected and that this number may be highly underreported. During that time 28 outbreaks of disease were reported. These numbers include 18 DENV (serotypes 1-4), 7 CHIKV and 3 ZIKV outbreaks [30] . These outbreaks result in a heavy toll on the islands' health system. Thus rapid testing methods are required in the region to enhance surveillance and assist with critical response measures to limit the spread of disease.",

Prior to testing, a preliminary study was undertaken to determine if samples such as a mouth swab or urine could be used to detect the presence of DENV, instead of the more invasive blood test. In a small number of patients presenting with DENV-like symptoms (n = 4) matched mouth swabs, urine and serum or plasma samples were obtained and processed. Although DENV RNA could be detected in both urine and mouth swabs the levels were significantly reduced compared to the matched serum/plasma samples.

Anker and Arima previously found an excess of males among reported DENV cases \ufffd 15 years of age [34] however this was not supported in this limited study perhaps due to the small sample set. correlated with the island population, where for most islands, the incidence of DENV infection was not significantly different to the average national incidence (0.416 per 1000 people). However, the islands of Aniwa (P = 0.0035), Ambae (P<0.00001), Tongoa (P<0.00001), and Emae (P<0.00001) had a higher number of positive cases than would be expected from the number of residents alone. Interestingly the island of Santo, with a population of 46, 078, showed a statistically significant decrease in the number of dengue cases recorded (0.018 per 1000; P = 0.0016) compared to the national average. However, the most striking examples are the islands of Emae, Tongoa and Ambae. Ambae has a population of 11061 with 14 confirmed dengue cases while Tongoa and Emae had 2243 and 684 residents with a total of 5 and 6 cases respectively. Aniwa had 1 case of dengue and is home to only 229 inhabitants thus can be excluded as a reservoir of increased dengue infection due to the small population and only 1 case of infection. Although this study is relatively small with a total of 116 confirmed cases from the whole Vanuatu region, perhaps the islands Emae, Tongoa and Ambae had a higher number of mosquitoes harbouring DENV thus leading to the increased number of positive cases observed in residents of the island (Fig 7) .",

NS1 and pan-flavivirus were in 100% concordance where data was available.

The highest numbers of dengue cases were reported in January 2017 with a decline in February. Interestingly, the number of cases of dengue infection then increased again in the month of March. March coincides with the start of routine testing of patients attending the Port Vila Central Hospital with DENV like symptoms using the pan-flavivirus/pan-alphavirus/pan-dengue molecular assays. The increase of dengue cases seen in March may be attributed to an increase in sensitivity when using molecular methods compared to conventional EIA. Fig 6 shows age related DENV infections. As can be seen from the data the number of positive dengue cases mirrors the age demographics of the islands of Vanuatu [35]. Fig 7 shows the number of DENV dengue cases by island of residence with the incidence per 1000 residents included. Efate has the largest population of Vanuatu with 86,250 residents and as would be expected also has the highest number of residents with confirmed DENV infection, with 26 cases over the period of testing.
