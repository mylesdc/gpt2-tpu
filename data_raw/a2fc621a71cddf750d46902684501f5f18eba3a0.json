Although the virus is not pandemic among humans, it poses a great threat to public health due to its zoonotic origin. Thus, both preventative and therapeutic countermeasures are urgently needed. In this study, we discovered a panel of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against MERS-CoV, which mapped to a wide range of regions on the spike (S) protein of the virus. In addition to mAbs with neutralizing epitopes located on the receptor-binding domain, one mAb, 5F9, which binds to the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the MERS-CoV S1 subunit, showed efficient neutralizing activity against the wild-type MERS-CoV strain EMC/2012, with a half maximal inhibitory concentration of 0.2 \u03bcg/mL. We concluded that a novel neutralizing epitope for MERS-CoV also resides on the NTD of the S protein, indicating that the NTD might be important during the viral infection process. Our findings have significant implications for further vaccine design and for the development of prophylactic and therapeutic monoclonal immunotherapies against MERS-CoV infection.",

[6] [7] [8] Although some human-to-human transmission cases, including contact with health care workers and family members, have been reported, [9] [10] [11] [12] it remains possible that the virus could acquire an adaptive mutation during repeated interspecies transmission events. Due to its potential threat, MERS-CoV has been listed as a Category C Priority Pathogen by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. However, neither licensed vaccines nor antiviral drugs against MERS-CoV have been approved for clinical use. Efficient countermeasures against this virus are urgently needed.",

            "text": "MERS-CoV is an enveloped positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the lineage C \u03b2-CoV genus. The MERS-CoV genome is 30 kb and encodes the 5\u2032-replicase structural protein (spike-envelope-membrane-nucleocapsid)-poly (A)-3\u2032. [13] [14] [15] The highly glycosylated spike (S) protein mediates viral infections and is a primary determinant of cell tropism and pathogenesis. It assembles as a trimer on the viral particle surface and contains two functional subunits. The S1 subunit (residues 1-751) is mainly responsible for mediating viral particle attachment to the cell surface and is dependent on the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) receptor. 16, 17 The S2 subunit (residues 752-1353) facilitates the subsequent fusion of the virus with the host cell membrane ( Figures 1A and 1B) . To deliver the viral nucleic acid into the host cell, the S1 subunit binds to the cellular receptor and triggers conformational changes in the S2 subunit, which then inserts its fusion peptide into the target cell membrane to form a six-helix bundle fusion core that prepares the viral and cell membranes for fusion. 19 The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S1 subunit serves as a determinant region for the production of MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] and has been the target for the development of a number of promising MERS-CoV vaccine candidates. [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] The MERS-CoV RBD maps to a 200-300 residue region spanning residues 358-588, 367-588, 367-606, 377-588 and 377-662, which are located in the S1 subunit C-terminal domain. 16, 17, [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] The specific interaction between MERS-CoV RBD and its receptor DPP4 (also known as CD26) has also been revealed at the atomic level by structural analysis. 16, 17 Accumulating evidence shows that all the neutralizing antibodies with therapeutic potential against MERS-CoV interfere with the association of RBD with DPP4. [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] In addition to the immunogenic RBD, the undefined N-terminal domain (NTD) accounting for a large portion of S1 may serve as a functional component of the MERS-CoV S1 subunit. NTD has been recognized as the receptor-binding site in several CoVs, including murine hepatitis virus. 41 In this study, we discovered a neutralizing mAb that specifically recognizes the MERS-CoV S protein NTD. This study highlights the importance of the region in the viral infection process, which may enable us to better understand the underlying neutralizing mechanism of natural MERS-CoV infection. These findings pave the way for MERS-CoV vaccine and immunotherapy development.",

Recently, one study showed that SARS-CoV infection is affected by the inactive-to-active state transition of the S glycoprotein trimer. In addition, the loops connecting the NTD to the C-terminal domain (CTD) 1 and CTD1 to CTD2 were found to play key roles in the conformational switch. 43 Lassa virus (LASV) envelope glycoprotein complex (GPC) is another class I viral fusion protein that initiates infection by processing into GP1, GP2 and an unusual stable signal peptide (SSP). GP1 is responsible for receptor binding, while GP2 mediates the fusion of the virion with a cell membrane. Previous studies demonstrated that gaps in the glycan shield of LASV GPC permitted neutralizing antibodies to interact simultaneously with the N-terminal extension of GP1 and either the fusion loop or the T-loop of GP2, inhibiting the structural alterations required for fusion. 44 These discoveries showed that maintaining glycoprotein structural integrity during viral infection is necessary and that neutralizing mAbs targeting different surface glycoprotein epitopes can interfere with structural state switching.

These features may imply that certain epitopes on the NTD of MERS-CoV S1 are structurally or functionally close to the ones on the RBD and that the mAbs targeting these epitopes can interfere with receptor binding or the post-fusion stage. The glycan composition of class I envelope glycoproteins can shield a virus against the neutralizing effect of a mAb. A neutralizing mAb against the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein was found to bind to the residues and glycans on gp41 and gp120, thereby precluding the CD4and/or co-receptor-induced conformational changes required for membrane fusion. 45 The S proteins of the Coronaviridae family, consisting of four genera (\u03b1-, \u03b2-, \u03b3and \u03b4-CoVs), are also class I envelope glycoproteins, and all use the S1 protein RBD or NTD to interact with cellular receptors or co-receptors for viral attachment. 46 To the best of our knowledge, most \u03b1-CoVs and some \u03b2-CoVs, including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and HCoV-HKU1, use protein moieties as their recognition receptors, and their main functional RBDs are located in the CTD of S1. In contrast, the RBDs of bovine CoV, human CoV OC43 and one avian \u03b3-CoV are located in the NTD, and sugar moieties are the main receptors.

Subsequently, DPP4-expressing Huh7.5 cells, upon reaching a density of 5 \u00d7 10 3 /well in a 96-well plate, were infected with 200 TCID 50 (50% tissue culture infective dose) pseudovirus MERS-CoV in the presence or absence of mAbs. The culture medium was renewed with fresh medium containing 2% FBS 18-20 h post-infection, and luciferase activity was determined after an additional 48 h incubation using an Infinite M1000 illuminometer.The neutralizing activity of the mAbs against live MERS-CoV was also determined in DPP4-expressing Vero E6 cells. Upon reaching a density of 5 \u00d7 10 4 /well in a 12-well plate, cell monolayers were infected with 30-35 plaque-forming units (PFU) of live virus in the presence or absence of the mAb. After three days of incubation at 37\u02daC, the inhibitory capacity of the mAbs was assessed by determining the numbers of PFU compared with the potent MERS-CoV anti-RBD and anti-N9 mAbs. All experiments associated with live MERS-CoV were conducted in a BSL-3 laboratory at the National Institute of Viral Diseases Control and Prevention, China CDC.",

(B) Inhibition of pseudovirus MERS-CoV entry into Huh7.5 cells by the isolated mAbs. Each of the selected mAbs (1 \u03bcg/mL), anti-N9 mAb (1 \u03bcg/mL) and anti-serum (1:10 000) were evaluated for their neutralizing activity against pseudotyped MERS-CoV after incubation with 293FT cell surface-expressing MERS-CoV S proteins. Neutralizing activity was defined as occurring when the inhibition percentage exceeded 50%. The results shown are representative of three independent experiments. N-terminal domain, NTD. The 5F9 antibody bound to the rNTD with high affinity. Recombinant proteins at 1 \u03bcg/mL were used to coat plates overnight at 4\u00b0C, and each of the mAbs was serially diluted in PBS and assessed for binding affinity and specificity to MERS-CoV rNTD (A) and rRBD (B).
