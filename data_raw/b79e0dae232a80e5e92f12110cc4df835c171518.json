            "text": "Background: The Gene Ontology project is a collaborative effort to provide descriptions of gene products in a consistent and computable language, and in a species-independent manner. The Gene Ontology is designed to be applicable to all organisms but up to now has been largely under-utilized for prokaryotes and viruses, in part because of a lack of appropriate ontology terms. Methods: To address this issue, we have developed a set of Gene Ontology classes that are applicable to microbes and their hosts, improving both coverage and quality in this area of the Gene Ontology. Describing microbial and viral gene products brings with it the additional challenge of capturing both the host and the microbe. Recognising this, we have worked closely with annotation groups to test and optimize the GO classes, and we describe here a set of annotation guidelines that allow the controlled description of two interacting organisms. Conclusions: Building on the microbial resources already in existence such as ViralZone, UniProtKB keywords and MeGO, this project provides an integrated ontology to describe interactions between microbial species and their hosts, with mappings to the external resources above. Housing this information within the freely-accessible Gene Ontology project allows the classes and annotation structure to be utilized by a large community of biologists and users.",

            "text": "The Gene Ontology (GO) is a bioinformatics resource to describe functional attributes of gene products across all kingdoms of life. The GO project is a collaborative effort developing three ontologies to describe the molecular actions of a gene product, the biological process those actions are part of, and the cellular locations in which they are active. First developed in 1998 [1] , the Gene Ontologies arose from the need for standard descriptions to define a given object or process, and contained terms summarising the biology of three organisms (mouse, fly and yeast). GO has since grown to be the most popular bio-ontology used for describing gene product characteristics [2, 3] . It now contains more than 40,000 terms, expressed using the W3C standard ontology language OWL2 [4] . Subsequent to or in parallel with ontology construction, GO classes are associated with a gene product; this association is termed an annotation. Annotations are the result of manual analysis by trained curators and/or computational methods. Annotations are linked to an underlying source and include an evidence code [5] indicating the supporting data. Biological ontologies and related annotations have proven invaluable in interpreting accumulated biological data, where the volume of information and variations in terminology can pose problems. GO annotation in particular has been used in analyses ranging from small-scale queries about a protein or pathway of interest to large-scale high-throughput studies including, among others, gene enrichment analyses, microarray analyses, predicting gene functions and textmining (e.g. [6] [7] [8] [9] provide a representative overview). These analyses have allowed biologists to rapidly gain knowledge about their gene product or gene product set.",

            "text": "Although GO was initially developed for eukaryotic organisms, primarily to support the work of eukaryotic model organism databases, GO has long been applicable to organisms beyond this taxonomic group [10, 11] . Despite this, GO remains largely under-utilized for prokaryotes, single-celled eukaryotic species, and viruses, as shown by manual annotation counts to these groups [12] . This project aims to promote microbial GO annotations, firstly by developing GO terms applicable to microbial processes and structures, and secondly by putting in place an annotation structure that allows description of both the microbe and the host environment. A number of microbial resources are already in existence; the integrated microbial genome network (IMG) [13] provides users with a set of tools to compare the genes, genomes and functions of microbial genomes. The MeGO vocabulary uses the GO format to describe the functions of mobile genetic elements, and the MeGO terms are used to annotate phage and plasmid protein families in the ACLAME database [14] . The Infectious Disease Ontology (IDO) and its sub-domain-specific extensions represent entities relevant to infectious diseases [15] . For viruses, many connected resources are available for data retrieval and analysis. ViralZone [16] provides molecular information for all virus groups, along with virion and genome figures in the form of fact sheets. The ViralZone pages have supplied information sources for many of the new viral GO terms (Fig. 1) , and we have worked alongside the Viral-Zone team [17] to provide reciprocal mappings to both ViralZone pages and UniProtKB keywords (labels that can be used to retrieve particular subsets of UniProtKB entries) [18] . The Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource (ViPR) [19] provides an integrated repository of data and analysis tools for human pathogenic viruses. The Virus Variation Resource [20] is a web-based resource initially designed for accessing large influenza sequence datasets [21] , and now housing sequence data for multiple viral and viroid genomes including Dengue virus [22] and West Nile Virus, together with a set of displays to view and explore the viral sequence datasets. The VIPERdb database [23] describes icosahedral virus capsid structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) including detailed structural and computational analyses. The Virus (re-)annotation database ViRAD [24] annotates protein-coding sequences in RNA viruses represented in the NCBI RefSeq database. Alignments of the resulting sequence are analysed to identify novel protein-coding reading frames and non-coding functional elements embedded within the protein-coding regions.",

This was largely because little annotation had been generated for the species typically participating in these processes. The exception was Plasmodium falciparum, which was fully annotated with GO classes in 2002 Fig. 1 Nuclear egress represented in ViralZone and the Gene Ontology. Viral capsids assembled in the nucleus can migrate to the cytoplasm by utilizing an unusual export pathway termed 'nuclear egress'. In this process, the viral capsid is delivered into the perinuclear space, producing a vesicular intermediate after fission. After fusion with the outer nuclear membrane, the naked capsid is released into the cytosol. The corresponding GO term 'exit of virus from host cell nucleus by nuclear egress' (GO:0046802) is mapped to ViralZone entry 1952. The sub-processes are described by GO terms 'nuclear capsid assembly' (GO:0039708) corresponding to ViralZone entry 1516, 'viral budding from nuclear membrane' (GO:0046765), 'fusion of viral membrane with host outer nuclear membrane' (GO:0039700) and 'viral capsid secondary envelopment' (GO:0046745) [25] . The host/parasite classes that existed at the time had no common root class, and it was often ambiguous as to whether the process involved a second organism or not. For example, the process of cell lysis can either be induced in a host organism by its parasite, or can be an endogenous process whereby the immune system destroys its own infected cells. GO had only a single term for this process, which did not allow annotators to distinguish between endogenously and exogenously induced cytolysis.",

The classes we created had to encompass this diversity whilst remaining general enough to be used to make inferences across species. For example, different microbes use a variety of mechanisms to adhere to their host organisms: via type IV pili in the case of bacteria, via specific infective structures such as the appressorium in parasitic fungi and via receptormediated binding in viruses. These disparate processes have a generic grouping under the GO multi-organism process sub-tree of 'adhesion of symbiont to host' (GO:0044406).",

For example, during most viral transcription it is the host polymerase that provides the activity, so having a separate term describing only the virus contribution is not appropriate. We thus decided that viral processes should be largely agnostic as to whether the process is from the perspective of the host or the virus. For example, 'viral entry into host cell' (GO:0046718) can be used to annotate both the viral and host proteins involved in the entry process (Fig. 3 ).

This loosely mirrors the top-level divisions made in ViralZone [17] , and allows us to capture the canonical host process that the virus is subverting or modifying Fig. 2 The triad structure in the multi-organism process node. The design of the upper-level classes in the multi-organism process subtree loosely follows a common 'triad' pattern in which there is a general parent class with two subclasses each specific for either the host or symbiont perspective. For example, 'acquisition of nutrients from other organism during symbiotic interaction' (GO:0051816) has the subtypes 'acquisition of nutrients from host' (GO:0044002) and 'acquisition of nutrients from symbiont' (GO:0051850). Full triads are only created where both subclasses are relevant. Blue arrows denote part_of relationships between classes, and black arrows denote is_a relationships between classes. The Gene Ontology uses multiple axes of classification, reflecting the multiple, scientifically valid ways that biological entities can classified. Thus any GO class can have multiple is_a parents. Image taken from QuickGO [12] ( Fig. 4) . We decided that phage processes were not distinct enough to require their own subtree, although some sub-processes will be unique to phages. For example the classes 'viral genome ejection through host cell envelope' (GO:0039678) and 'viral DNA genome packaging, headful' (GO:0098006) would only be applicable to phages and their hosts, with the phagespecific nature of these terms captured using synonyms. This is consistent with the way GO is modelled for single-organism processes that are specific to a species group. For the purpose of GO, we also decided that viruses do not 'develop' in the sense that multicellular organisms do. Thus new viral-specific classes are not subclasses or parts of the current 'developmental process' (GO:0032502) GO class.",

Note that these latter two classes are not included in the count since these nodes mostly include classes that are not applicable to microbes such as female pregnancy and mating behavior. Given the redundancy between database sequences, it is perhaps more useful to record that over 51,000 of these annotations are associated with UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entries. For a more detailed breakdown of the annotation count, see Fig. 7 . Fig. 6 Relationships used to formalise multi-organism annotations. An extended GO annotation system will allow annotators to record relationships between interacting organisms in a multi-organism process. Here, the involvement of the host receptor, ICAM1, in receptor-mediated attachment of Human Rhinovirus 3 to human host cells is used as an example Fig. 7 The breakdown of multi-organism process annotations into manual and electronically-derived methods. Counts exclude 'multimulticellular organism process' (GO:0044706) and 'multi-organism reproductive process' (GO:0044703). Manual experimental annotations include annotations with evidence codes IMP, IGI, IPI, IDA, IEP and EXP. Manual non-experimental annotations include annotations with evidence codes ISS, TAS, NAS, ND, IC, RCA, IBA, IBD, IKR, IRD, ISA, ISM, ISO and IGC. Annotations with an IEA (inferred from electronic annotation) code are further broken-down into mapping methods for UniProtKB Keywords-to-GO (UniProtKW2GO), InterPro2GO, and HAMAP2GO. Refer to the text for details of the InterPro2GO and UniProtKB Keywords2GO mapping methods. For HAMAP2GO mappings, GO terms are manually assigned to each HAMAP (High-quality Automated and Manual Annotation of microbial Proteins) family rule, and transferred between highly orthologous microbial proteins. Further IEA methods are not shown for conciseness. Reactome mappings receive a TAS (traceable author statement) evidence code, and are therefore included in the manual non-experimental annotation count. Annotation counts are given for UniProtKB/ Swiss-Prot identifiers which provide a non-redundant source of protein sequences, and were recorded on October 8th 2014",

To supplement the manual methods, annotations are also derived electronically from mappings of GO classes to relevant (sometimes equivalent) terms in external systems and databases. These mappings are useful both for checking consistency and for automatically deriving GO annotations. The mapping process is referenced for traceability, and most annotations assigned by this method have an 'inferred by electronic annotation' (IEA) evidence code.

Annotated genes and proteins can be viewed at any level in the tree by selecting the ' Associations' tab. The multiorganism process ontology and annotated proteins can also be viewed and downloaded from the UniProt GO browser QuickGO [12] . This is done by searching for 'multi-organism process' and navigating down the tree using the 'Child terms' tab. Annotated proteins for the selected term can be viewed in the 'Protein Annotation' tab. The annotated proteins can be further filtered e.g. by taxon using the 'Filter' option and downloaded with the 'Download' button.",
