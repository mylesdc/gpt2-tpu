            "text": "Background: Interaction between immune system and Chandipura virus (CHPV) during different stages of its life cycle remain poorly understood. The exact route of virus entry into the blood and CNS invasion has not been clearly defined. The present study was undertaken to assess the population in PBMC that supports the growth of virus and to detect active virus replication in PBMC as well as its subsets. Methods: PBMC subsets viz.: CD3 + , CD14 + , CD19 + , CD56 + cells were separated and infected with CHPV. The infected cells were then assessed for transcription (N gene primer) and replication (NP gene primer) of CHPV by PCR. The supernatant collected from infected cells were titrated in Baby Hamster Kidney (BHK) cells to assess virus release. The cytokine and chemokine expression was quantified by flow cytometry. Results: Amplification of N and NP gene was detected in CD14 + (monocyte) and CD19 + (B cell), significant increase in virus titre was also observed in these subsets. It was observed that, although the levels of IL-6 and IL-10 were elevated in CD14 + cells as compared to CD19 + cells, the differences were not significant. However the levels of TNF\u03b1 and IL-8 were significantly elevated in CD14 + cells than in CD19 + cells. The levels of chemokine (CXCL9, CCL5, CCL2, CXCL10) were significantly elevated in CHPV infected PBMC as compared to uninfected cells. CCL2 and CXCL9 were significantly increased in CHPV infected CD14 + cells as compared to CD19 + cells. Conclusion: CD14 + and CD19 + cells support active replication of CHPV. High viral load was detected in CD14 + cells infected with CHPV hence it might be the primary target cells for active replication of CHPV. An elevated levels of cytokines and chemokines observed in CD14 + cells may help in predicting the pathogenecity of CHPV and possible entry into the central nervous system.",

            "text": "Viruses belonging to the Vesiculovirus genera share similar genomic and structural organization [6, 7] . The molecular regulations of their replication and transcription events are also comparable. The five transcriptional units are transcribed by a single promoter at the 3\u2032end and code for the nucleocapsid protein (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), glycoprotein (G) and polymerase large protein (L). The RNA genome is tightly encapsidated by the viral N protein to form helical ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP). This encapsidated genome serves as template for both replication and transcription. One of the molecules that have been implicated in the trasnscription-replication switch is the viral N protein. The intracellular concentration of N protein modulates the transition of polymerase action from transcription to replication by encapsidating the nascent leader RNA and thereby suppressing the intergenic transcription termination signals. In VSV, it was suggested that N-P complex formation could be the key mechanism for this switch. Infected cell extract immunodepleted of N-P complex with an antibody against P protein was unable to support replication in an in vitro assay. All these reports strongly suggest a possible auxiliary function of P protein in viral replication [8] [9] [10] [11] .",

The studies in the murine model reveal that blood cells are attractive targets for CHPV as they are located mainly in the circulation and causes acute inflammation followed by dissemination into the central nervous system [14, 15] . CHPV was isolated from patient's leukocytes suggest that blood leukocytes could be infected and involved in viral production [4] . The exact route of entry to the susceptible cells in the central nervous system (CNS) and the events taking place during the acute blood phase of CHPV infections has not been clearly understood. Interactions between immune system during CHPV life cycle remains poorly defined. Although the role of cytokine and chemokine is unclear, increased levels of certain cytokines has been observed in CHPV related encephalopathy in children [16] . However the interaction of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and its subsets with CHPV is unclear. In this study we tried to understand the susceptibility of PBMC and its subtypes to CHPV infection. We have also assessed cytokine and chemokine levels from the infected cell population which could give us the insight of CHPV pathogenesis.",

There are no animal models that mimic the clinical syndrome of severe encephalitis in humans and therefore observational studies of patient cohorts are the main source of understanding immunopathogenesis of CHPV infection [5, 16] . Limited studies in mice revealed that CHPV induces viremia followed by dissemination of the virus to secondary infection sites and reach the CNS. During peripheral circulation, blood leukocytes such as monocytes, dendritic cells and natural killer (NK) cells are the main components of innate immunity and they have been implicated in the immunopathogenesis of many viral diseases. These cells are attractive virus targets because they are located mainly in the circulation and peripheral tissues moreover they can assist virus dissemination [14, 15] .",

            "text": "Our result demonstrates that CHPV replicate in monocytes as well as in B cells and trigger cytokine response. In vitro model of unfractionated PBMC infected with CHPV indicated lodging of virus. Although the intracellular positive staining for CHPV was observed, very low numbers of cells were infected even at high viral load (MOI = 10) and hence no significant conclusions could be drawn (flow cytometry, data not shown). In order to assess the replication in infected cells, the virus release and the replicative intermediates were analyzed. Consistent to earlier report by A. Roy et al. [12] , the transcriptive intermediate (N gene) was detected after 2 h pi and replicative intermediate (NP gene) were detected after 4 h pi in PBMC infected with CHPV. It has been proposed that during CHPV transcription, progressive termination at each gene junction produce the positive sense leader RNA and 5\u2032mRNA corresponding to 5 viral genes that are N, P, M, G and L [2, 7] . The detection of N gene amplification indicated the positive strand RNA genome i.e., transcription in the infected cells. During replication, the gene junction termination signals are ignored to produce positive strand polycistronic RNA complementary to the whole genome which then serves as the template for the synthesis of progeny genome RNA [2, 7, 12] . Data represented here further revealed the NP gene amplification which is the replication template present only during virus replication, was found in infected cells. To determine the extent of replication in PBMC, infectious virus titres were determined using supernatants collected at various time We further extended our studies to pinpoint the target cell(s) of CHPV infection in PBMC. PBMC consist of roughly 70 % T cells, 10 % B cells, 10 % Monocytes and 1 % NK cells [19] . The CD3 + (T cells), CD14 + (Monocytes), CD19 + (B cells), CD56 + (NKcells) were infected with MOI = 5 of CHPV. Monocyte and B cell support active replication of CHPV. The replication of CHPV observed in monocytes or B cells was not due to the contamination of either cell as subsets used for studies contained high percentage of monocyte/B cell. Infected cells coexpressed the cell markers (CD14/CD19) and viral antigens. One of our key findings is that primary monocyte without stimulation or differentiation was permissive for CHPV replication. The titres of virus released from the infected monocytes (5 log TCID 50 ) were found significantly higher than B cells (3 log TCID 50 ). It was reported that B cell line (Raji) adapted dengue virus could replicate in B lymphocytes in in vitro infection model [20, 21] . The CHPV used in the current study was not grown /adapted in any B cell and monocyte cell line or PBMC. Cells treated with sodium azide exhibited the presence of both N and NP gene amplification. Thus the efficiency of infection probably reflects viral entry receptors expressed on these cells that requires further studies. Studies on other members of Rhabdoviridae family such as VSV and rabies virus demonstrated that monocytes support replication of these viruses. It was also reported that rabies virus infects murine macrophages (IC-21 and bone marrow derived macrophages) as well as human macrophage cell (U937 and THP-1) in-vitro [19, [22] [23] [24] . Several studies on arboviral model suggested that blood leukocyte such as monocytes and B cells support viral growth. Chikungunya virus actively replicates in monocytes whereas in dengue virus, monocytes are the primary cells among PBMC, while B lymphocytes also harbours and supports dengue virus infection [17, 20, 21, 25] . Overall we observed that monocytes and B cells are permissible for CHPV growth. The experimental conditions used thus reflect more closely the environment where these subsets may encounter in vivo virus infection. The modulation of the cytokine and chemokine responses during the course of CHPV has not been fully elucidated. It has been shown that during early infection (within 24 h) there is pro-and anti-inflammatory response to CHPV infection in vitro; however, the dynamics of cytokine and chemokine response during the course of CHPV replication in human is unknown. We further investigated the ability of purified monocyte/ B cells to trigger the cytokine and chemokine response after CHPV infection. Elevated levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and TNF\u03b1 were observed in CHPV infected PBMC as compared to their mock controls. IL-6, IL-10, TNF\u03b1 levels were significantly higher in monocytes as compared to B cells.",

Elevated levels of CCL2, CCL5, CXCL9, and CXCL10 were observed in infected monocytes and B cells as compared to their controls. However, the secreted levels of CCL2 and CXCL9 were significantly higher in monocytes as compared to B cell. Although the role of chemokines in CHPV infection is unclear, the increased levels of CCL2 during CHPV infection in mice model might play a role in increasing the permeability of blood brain barrier (BBB) to allow virus into CNS [14, 15] . Increased level of CCL2 might also explain the accumulation of lymphocytes and macrophages in the spleen, lymph nodes and other tissue [27] .",

Moreover it was also reported that CCL2 is responsible for increased permeability and transmigration of HIV infected human leukocytes across BBB in in vitro model [30] . Here the up regulations of CCL2 and CXCL9 in CHPV infected monocytes were observed. Changes in cytokine and chemokine levels during the course of CHPV infection could have a major impact on the immune system; influencing pathogenesis by enhancing or suppressing CHPV replication as well as favouring the formation of infected cell reservoirs in CNS needs to be determined.",
