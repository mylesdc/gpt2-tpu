Antibodies against the filovirus surface glycoprotein (GP) have been shown to provide life-saving therapy in nonhuman primates, but such antibodies are generally virus-specific. Many monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been described against Ebola virus. In contrast, relatively few have been described against Marburg virus. Here we present ten mAbs elicited by immunization of mice using recombinant mucin-deleted GPs from different Marburg virus (MARV) strains. Surprisingly, two of the mAbs raised against MARV GP also cross-react with the mucin-deleted GP cores of all tested ebolaviruses (Ebola, Sudan, Bundibugyo, Reston), but these epitopes are masked differently by the mucin-like domains themselves. The most efficacious mAbs in this panel were found to recognize a novel \"wing\" feature on the GP2 subunit that is unique to Marburg and does not exist in Ebola. Two of these anti-wing antibodies confer 90 and 100% protection, respectively, one hour post-exposure in mice challenged with MARV.",

The filovirus family includes the major genera ebolavirus and marburgvirus and the newly discovered cuevavirus. In the ebolavirus genus are five known species: Ebola virus (EBOV), Sudan virus (SUDV), Bundibugyo virus (BDBV), Reston virus (RESTV), and Ta\u00ef Forest virus (TAFV). In the marburgvirus genus, there is one species, the eponymously named Marburg virus (MARV) [1] . MARV is further subdivided into different strains, including Ci67, Musoke, Ravn and Angola. Ravn is the most divergent strain of MARV, differing by 21% in genomic sequence from other Marburg strains [2] , and is sometimes referenced as a separate filovirus species.",

            "text": "The filoviruses present a single viral protein on their envelope surface, the glycoprotein (GP), which is responsible for attachment and entry of viruses into target cells. GP is expressed as a precursor that is cleaved by furin in the producer cell to yield two subunits: GP1 and GP2, which remain linked by a disulfide bond [12, 13] . GP1 contains the putative receptor-binding region [14] , as well as two heavily glycosylated domains: a glycan cap which sits immediately atop the putative receptor-binding site and a larger, largely unstructured mucin-like domain [15, 16] . The mucin-like domains contain a dense clustering of N-and O-linked glycans and likely mask the GP from immune surveillance [17, 18] . The second subunit of GP, termed GP2, possesses the transmembrane domain that anchors GP into the viral surface and the hydrophobic fusion peptide required for fusion. In ebolaviruses, the furin cleavage site lies at residue 501 and the entire mucin-like domain is attached to the GP1 subunit. In Marburg virus, however, the furin cleavage site lies at residue 435, splitting the mucin-like domain so that a portion of it remains attached to the GP2 subunit [19] . We have termed this 66 amino-acid N-terminal GP2 extension the \"GP2 wing\".",

This cleavage event removes the glycan cap and the mucin-like domain, resulting in a loss of over 70% of the molecular mass of GP [23] [24] [25] . Endosomal cleavage renders GP competent for receptor binding [22, 26, 27] , allowing the exposed GP1 head to bind a shared filovirus receptor, Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) [28, 29] . Although antibodies that broadly cross-react among ebola-and marburgvirus GPs would be highly desirable, only one such antibody, MR72, has been described [30] . Recent work in non-human primates has demonstrated that passive administration of monoclonal antibody (mAb) cocktails against GP can provide highly effective post-exposure therapy for EBOV infection [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] . Polyclonal sera against Marburg virus has shown similar efficacy, suggesting that antibodies could also be a viable treatment option for MARV infection [36] . However, fewer monoclonal antibodies, from which such cocktails could be developed, are currently available for MARV. One human survivor panel has recently been described; most of these mAbs compete for the same site on the GP1 core [16, 30] . Antibodies targeting other epitopes on Marburg GP would be desirable in order to form a treatment cocktail.",

Combining mAbs with non-overlapping epitopes can significantly increase the overall potency of the cocktail over the individual mAbs alone [37] , and can mitigate antigenic escape by the virus [38, 39] . Anti-viral antibodies are often selected based on neutralization, or the ability of the mAbs to prevent viral entry into target cells in vitro. However, for filoviruses as well as other viruses, neutralization in vitro does not necessarily correlate with protection in vivo [40, 41] . Non-neutralizing antibodies are known to confer protection by antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), phagocytosis, prevention of virus budding, and other mechanisms [42, 43] . Indeed, one successful anti-EBOV oligoclonal cocktail is composed entirely of antibodies that are not potent neutralizers [32, 44] .",

Immunogens included GP1-mucin-deleted ectodomains (GP\u0394muc) from Marburg strains Ci67, Musoke, Angola, and Ravn. Mucin-deleted immunogens were used to direct the immune response away from the highly variable mucin-like domains. Ten antibodies were chosen and analyzed for in vitro neutralization, in vivo efficacy, and biochemical recognition of MARV and EBOV GPs. Antibodies against multiple epitopes were found. Four antibodies target a novel MARV-specific \"wing\" epitope on GP2 (30G3, 30G4, 30G5 and 54G2), and confer 60-100% protection in mice challenged with MARV. A separate MARV-specific antibody, 9A11, directed against an epitope in GP1, confers 65% protection. Another mAb directed against GP1, 40G1, confers 40% protection and was found to be broadly cross-reactive among the core of filovirus GPs, including both marburg-and ebolaviruses.",

All ten mAbs exhibit medium binding (EC50 between 20ng/ml and 200ng/ml, colored dark yellow) to high binding (EC50 <20ng/ml, colored orange) against Ravn GP and GP\u0394muc ( Fig 1B) , but only seven of the mAbs cross-react with GP from other MARV strains ( Fig 1C) . All mAbs bind the protease-cleaved Ravn GP core, termed GPcl, as well as GP\u0394muc, with the exception of 9A11. Antibody 9A11 exhibits an 8-fold decrease in binding to GPcl as compared to GP\u0394muc ( Fig  1B) . Additionally, to evaluate whether the mAbs have the capacity to bind cell-surface GP, ELI-SAs were performed with virus-like particles (VLPs) bearing full-length wild-type MARV Ravn GP. Eight mAbs bind as well (or nearly as well) to VLPs as purified recombinant Ravn GP. In contrast, 2A12 exhibits nearly 10-fold weaker binding to VLPs than to GP ectodomain, and 54G3 binding to VLPs is lost at the highest concentration tested (Fig 1B) .",

Pepscan identified linear epitopes for only four mAbs, 30G3, 30G4, 30G5 and 54G2, all of which overlap within residues 451-471 ( Fig 2B) . This shared region lies in an extension of GP2 that is specific to MARV (as a result of the furin cleavage site shift from 501 in EBOV to 435 in MARV), which we have termed the GP2 wing (Fig 2A) . In order to confirm the pepscan results, we engineered a GP\u0394muc with an additional deletion of residues 436-483, termed GP\u0394muc\u0394w (Fig 2A) . Indeed, binding to GP\u0394muc\u0394w is lost for only the four anti-wing mAbs, whilst the remaining six mAbs against different epitopes do bind GP\u0394muc\u0394w (S2 Fig).

The most notable change is residue 465, which is a Glu (E) in Ravn but a Lys (K) in the other strains ( Fig 2B) . Wing mAbs 54G2 and 30G3 are specific for MARV Ravn. Correspondingly, ELISA data comparing binding of wild-type Ravn GP\u0394muc to E465K Ravn GP\u0394muc confirm that the presence of Lys at position 465 (as exists in other strains of MARV) likely hinders binding of 54G2 and 30G3. 30G5, however, still retains some binding to E465K, while 30G4 is unaffected by this mutation, retaining binding at 2 and 0.2ug/ml ( Fig 2C) . These results agree with pepscan results (based on 15-mer peptides overlapping by 5 amino acids) which define the epitope for 30G4 as slightly shifted away from position 465, towards the N-terminus of GP2 ( Fig 2B) . This shift may explain why 30G4 is the most cross-reactive of the 4 anti-wing mabs ( Fig 1C) .",

Those that conferred the greatest in vivo protection are directed against a novel \"wing\" domain on MARV GP2. This wing region is a MARV-specific portion of the mucin-like domain attached to GP2. Such an epitope does not exist in ebolaviruses because the entire mucin-like domain is attached to GP1. Although this study size was small, we note that GP2 wing-directed mAbs were only obtained when mice were immunized with mucin-deleted Ravn GP. It may be tempting to assume that this epitope is masked by the mucin-like domain; however, anti-wing mAbs are able to access their epitope on mucin-containing GP, neutralize pseuodviruses bearing mucin-containing GP and provide in vivo efficacy when challenged with Marburg virus. We believe that the elicitation of anti-wing antibodies when using Ravn GP\u0394muc may instead result from the greater homogeneity and stability of Ravn GP\u0394muc over other MARV antigens. A seven-year protein engineering effort in our laboratory to identify crystallizable versions of MARV GP indeed found that GPs produced from strain Ravn are the most homogenous, and have a lesser tendency to aggregate than those from other strains of MARV [16] . The homogeneity may have lead to improved presentation of this protective epitope within this study.",

The \"base\" of GP is a common site of neutralization for the ebolaviruses and is the epitope target of anti-EBOV neutralizing antibodies KZ52 [15] , 2G4 and 4G7 [46] , as well as the anti-SUDV mAb 16F6 [47] . Perhaps the presence of the flexible GP2-wing in MARV blocks access to this site on the GP core. Nonetheless, antibodies directed against the GP wing itself do have the potential to be fully protective, and represent a novel epitope in MARV for therapeutic cocktail design. The most protective of these mAbs, 30G5, is promising but only binds with high affinity to the GP from Ravn, and hence, protection by 30G5 against other MARV strains may be limited. In contrast, monoclonal antibody 30G4 only confers 60% efficacy, yet cross-reacts with mucin-containing GPs from four strains of MARV. However, 30G4 is a murine IgG1, an isotype that typically exhibits weaker immune effector activity than murine IgG2a [48] . Replacement of the constant domain framework may improve its in vivo efficacy.",

These antibodies, 40G1 and 2D8, bind all MARV GPs, but only bind Ebola, Sudan, Bundibugyo and Reston GP from which the mucin-like domain is deleted (Fig 5) . Hence, these highly conserved epitopes are exposed on marburgvirus GPs, but masked on ebolavirus GPs. These observations parallel those obtained from a panel of anti-MARV GP antibodies isolated from a human survivor [30] , and support structural observations that the orientation of the mucin-like domains differs between EBOV and MARV [16] . Indeed, no cross-filovirus anti-GP antibody (reactive to both ebola and marburg) has yet been elicited by an ebolavirus GP immunogen, nor has any such antibody yet been isolated from an ebolavirus survivor. Although the filovirus cross-reactive mAb 40G1 confers only 40% survival, 40G1 or another antibody like it [30] may be useful in an immunotherapeutic cocktail because a highly conserved epitope would likely be less subject to antigenic escape. Antibody 9A11 is also directed against GP1 but its pattern of binding is distinct from 40G1 and 2D8. 9A11 is the only mAb in this panel that has a lower affinity to GPcl than GP or GP\u0394muc. This suggests that the epitope of 9A11 is partially lost upon cleavage and that 9A11 could be similar to a glycan cap binder like 13C6 or 1H3 for EBOV GP [46] . Unfortunately, due to the single preferred orientation of GP\u0394muc + 9A11 Fab particles on negative stain EM grids, a high-resolution reconstruction could not be determined, and better understanding of the 9A11 epitope awaits further study. 9A11 affords 65% protection in vivo and is highly crossreactive among MARV ectodomain GPs.",

In this study of mAbs against MARV, none of the mAbs offered significant in vitro neutralization, yet several did confer partial to complete in vivo protection against MARV one hour after challenge. Although this study is limited in scope, we note that among this set of antibodies, those that exhibited in vitro neutralization also conferred the best in vivo protection.

All antibodies were blinded by IBT before submission to USAMRIID researchers. Animals were weighed and monitored daily over a 28 day period post-challenge, at which point mice were euthanized in accordance with an IACUC-approved protocol. Once animals were symptomatic, they were examined twice per day. Health was scored using the following parameters: 0 = normal, 1 = reduced grooming/ruffled fur, 2 = subdued, 3 = lethargic/hunched posture (provide DietGel for hydration), 4 = unresponsive; euthanize.
