            "text": "Juniperus rigida (J.rigida) which is endemic to East Asia, has traditionally been used as an ethnomedicinal plant in China. This study was undertaken to evaluate the quality of J. rigida samples derived from 11 primary regions in China. Ten phenolic compounds were simultaneously quantified using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), and chlorogenic acid, catechin, podophyllotoxin, and amentoflavone were found to be the main compounds in J. rigida needles, with the highest contents detected for catechin and podophyllotoxin. J. rigida from Jilin (S9, S10) and Liaoning (S11) exhibited the highest contents of phenolic profiles (total phenolics, total flavonoids and 10 phenolic compounds) and the strongest antioxidant and antibacterial activities, followed by Shaanxi (S2, S3). A similarity analysis (SA) demonstrated substantial similarities in fingerprint chromatograms, from which 14 common peaks were selected. The similarity values varied from 0.85 to 0.98. Chemometrics techniques, including hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), principal component analysis (PCA), and discriminant analysis (DA), were further applied to facilitate accurate classification and quantification of the J. rigida samples derived from the 11 regions. The results supported HPLC data showing that all J. rigida samples exhibit considerable variations in phenolic profiles, and the samples were further clustered into three major groups coincident with their geographical regions of origin. In addition, two discriminant functions with a 100% discrimination ratio were constructed to further distinguish and classify samples with unknown membership on the basis of eigenvalues to allow optimal discrimination among the groups. Our comprehensive findings on matching phenolic profiles and bioactivities along with data from fingerprint chromatograms with chemometrics provide an effective tool for screening and quality evaluation of J. rigida and related medicinal preparations.",

The berries of J. rigida have been widely used in Korean traditional medicine to treat rheumatoid arthritis and dropsy (Lee et al., 2010) and its branches and leaves utilized in traditional Mongolian medicine in China and as an important raw material to provide essential oil for the chemical industry (Wei and Shibamoto, 2007; Wu and Lin, 2014; Abdel et al., 2015) . Chemical and pharmacological research on J. rigida has led to the discovery of bioactive components, such as flavonoids and phenolic compounds that potentially contribute to its antioxidant activity (Robards et al., 1999; Woo et al., 2011; Taviano et al., 2013) . Moreover, lignans and flavonoids from J. rigida, such as catechin, podophyllotoxin, and amentoflavone, exert strong biological effects, including anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and antiviral activities (Lee et al., 2008; Gordien et al., 2009; Ryu et al., 2010; Lesjak et al., 2011 Lesjak et al., , 2013 Lesjak et al., , 2014 Jeong et al., 2012) .",

            "text": "Total Phenolic and Flavonoid Contents of J. rigida Needles from Different Regions Among J. rigida derived from the 11 districts, the total phenolic and total flavonoid contents varied significantly ( Table 2) . Total phenolic compounds were the most abundant in Fengcheng (S11) with contents of 31.64 mmol equiv. GAE/100 g, and lowest in Dabaozhen (S6) with contents of 13.34 mmol equiv. GAE/100 g. Consistent with total phenolic content data, the highest and lowest total flavonoid contents were detected in S11 and S6 (84.53 mmol equiv. QUE/100 g, 39.05 mmol equiv. QUE/100 g, respectively). Overall, abundance of total phenolic and flavonoid contents of J. rigida was in the order: Fengcheng (S11), Changbai Mountain (S10), Yijun (S3), Fugu (S2), Chongli (S5), Xiaosuangou (S7), Jinhua (S9), Datong (S4), Wulahada (S8), Helan Mountain (S1), Dabaozhen (S6). Therefore, among the diverse J. rigida samples, those from Fengcheng and Changbai Mountain were of the highest quality due to their rich phenolic contents. Variations in the total phenolic and flavonoid contents in J. rigida needles were potentially due to differences in the levels, properties, and proportions of their active ingredients, which, in turn, may be attributed to distribution in diverse geological zones, leading to different therapeutic properties of the same species from various growth regions. 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, and 13 were identified as chlorogenic acid, catechin, cumaric acid, rutin, hyperoside, ellagic acid, podophyllotoxin, amentoflavone, formononetin, and galangal, respectively (Figure 2, G0) . Total contents of the identified compounds varied significantly among the regions (p < 0.05, Table 3 ), the highest recorded in S2 (746.65 mg/g) followed by S6 (694.02 mg/g) and S3 (666.40 mg/g), and the lowest in S11 (415.27 mg/g) and S8 (411.74 mg/g). In all 11 J. rigida samples, chlorogenic acid, catechin, podophyllotoxin, and amentoflavone were the most abundant phenolic compounds. The contents of these four compounds varied from 53.32 \u00b1 0.17 to 163.38 \u00b1 0.17 mg/g DW, 112.52 \u00b1 0.08 to 288.88 \u00b1 0.38 mg/g DW, 71.11 \u00b1 0.06 to 189.18 \u00b1 0.04 mg/g DW and 57.68 \u00b1 0.01 to 146.16 \u00b1 0.05 mg/g DW, respectively. Ellagic acid and formononetin were the least abundant phenolic compounds, with contents ranging from 2.82 \u00b1 0.02 to 3.01 \u00b1 0.06 mg/g DW and 2.22 \u00b1 0.01 to 5.68 \u00b1 0.02 mg/g DW, respectively. Chlorogenic acid, catechin, podophyllotoxin, and amentoflavone are well-known human health antioxidants (Harwood et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2013) . Previous studies have shown that these active components are abundant in J. rigida and have significant potential for application as natural antioxidants in the food and drug industries. Since the contents of phenolic compounds in J. rigida needles from different geographical sources vary considerably, a standard protocol for effective quality evaluation of J. rigida appears essential.",

The score plot of the first three principal components, PC1 and PC2, visually revealed a positive influence on quality evaluation of J. rigida from different regions (Figure 4) . PCA results were consistent with HCA findings, indicative of different chemical profiles from distinct locations. Analysis of the loading plot of PC1 against PC2 (Figure 5 ) revealed that peaks contributing to PC1 (7, 9, 10, 11, and 13) influenced the cluster in a top-down order. These were the compounds that distinguished S2, S3 and S9 as Group 1. Peaks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 14 that mainly contributed to PC2 led to the classification of S10 and S11 as Group 3. The remaining samples comprised Group 2. In summary, since PC1 contributing more peaks than PC2, samples on the right side of Figure 5 were presumed to be of higher quality. Accordingly, we concluded that J. rigida collected from Shaanxi province (S2, S3) and Jinhua (S9) were of the highest quality.

Firstly, J. rigida samples derived from Fengcheng (S11) and Changbai Mountain (S10) were of the highest quality in terms of effective bacterial inhibitor and bactericidal activities, attributable to their high total phenolic and total flavonoid contents and antibacterial effects. Secondly, J. rigida samples from Jinhua (S9) and Shaanxi (S2, S3) contained the most active ingredients (10 phenolic compounds) and showed the strongest antioxidant activities. These results provide critical information for quality evaluation of J. rigida samples from different geographical regions. Integrated information from comparisons and analyses revealed that samples of J. rigida collected from Jilin and Liaoning province displayed the highest bioactivity, possibly attributable to the geographical location at high altitudes and cold climatic conditions, followed by samples from Shaanxi province.",
