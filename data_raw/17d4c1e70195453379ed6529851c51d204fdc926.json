Investigations of naturally occurring respiratory infections in a herd setting are an opportunity for accurate estimates of the consequences. This article presents estimates based on individual monitoring of weight and concentrate intake of several hundred bulls previous to, during and after a respiratory infection outbreak with bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) as the main pathogen. The aim of the study was to analyse the association between exposure to BRSV, weight gain and feed conversion rate, quantify any change in these parameters, and estimate the duration of the change in production.",

In addition, the performance of apparently healthy animals that are exposed during an outbreak are severely negatively affected. The duration of this decrease in production in animals after recovery, or animals that have not shown disease at all, has not previously been documented. These losses will easily be underestimated, but contribute significantly to the costs for the producer. The findings emphasize the importance of BRSV infection for profitability and animal welfare in cattle husbandry. The study also illustrates that utilising intra-herd comparison of health and production parameters is a productive approach to estimate consequences of an outbreak.",

A plot showing the age distribution after this procedure is presented in Fig. 1 . The procedure resulted in a reduction of the N value corresponding to any given day so that it led to a reduction from a maximum of 220 bulls to 143. Most of the reduction was obviously associated with the untreated group as they were of higher age.

Firstly, the clinical signs and the high number of cases in a short period of time indicate a highly virulent infectious agent being the likely cause of the outbreak investigated in the present study. Serological examination did indicate BRSV infection in most animals. Even if increasing antibody levels to BCoV and BPIV3 were also detected, the increase was present in a lower number of animals. In addition, BRSV was detected by RTqPCR. Furthermore it is reported that BPIV3 acting as a single agent mainly causes mild disease, and even when coinciding with BRSV infection it does not change the clinical signs significantly [27, 28] . Similarly, respiratory BCoV infections usually cause mild disease in infected calves [29] . Infection with BRSV predispose to infection with opportunistic bacteria [7] , and it has been reported that 40 % of the viral infections lead to secondary bacterial infections [8] . In Norway, Pasteurella multocida and Trueperella pyogenes are the two most common bacteria causing secondary infections. Mannheimia haemolytica are also relatively commonly detected and Histophilus somni appears to be rare [30, 31] . Primary pulmonary pasteurellosis is generally uncommon in beef or dairy cattle in Norway, and it has never been diagnosed in the centre described in the present study. The severity and character of the outbreak indicated a secondary origin of the bacteria cultured from lung tissue. BRSV as the principal pathogen in the outbreak is also supported by the detection of pathological lesions typical for BRSV infection and the IHC with positive staining of BRS viral antigen. The losses connected with the outbreak may be due to either primary effect of the virus and/or secondary bacterial infections. At first, the analysis of vaccination status seemed to indicate a protective effect of vaccination. However, because the age distribution between the two groups with respect to experiment variable as well as outcome variable (medical treatment) was highly unequal, it is not possible to draw this kind of conclusion. Higher age would be associated with, i.e., generally stronger physique, more acquired immunity from factors outside of vaccination, and more time for the vaccine to have produced any effect. The data thus are not suitable for this type of analysis.",

This indicates that the drop was caused by a reduced intake of roughage and/or water in the initial phase of disease and that even sick bulls manage to finish their concentrate. It is significant in the sense that sick cattle usually have a decreased appetite, so that a normal concentrate feed consumption may falsely be interpreted as a sign of good health unless one also considers other observations. Except for a 3-week period of the outbreak, the total amount of roughage consumed in the present population was reported to be as normal.",

            "text": "The findings emphasize the economic significance of BRSV infection. As an illustration of the clinical significance of the differences concerning the AAW variable, a bull with an AAW of 1.20 at 300 days of age would be 30 kg heavier than a bull of the same age with an AAW of 1.10. At 150 days, the same AAW difference corresponds to 15 kg. Similarly, a reduced daily weight gain from 1255 to 1144 g (Table 4 ), will over 8 months amount to 23 extra days needed for the more slowly growing bull to reach the same weight. For similar rearing systems, these numbers may be multiplied with the economic figures appropriate for a specific country or industry, to produce cost estimates. Some considerations of factors associated with the studied herd are important for interpreting the results correctly. At any moment there are animals of different ages and weights being housed in different areas throughout the building. Furthermore, removal of older and introduction of new bulls occurs regularly. Finally, there is a possible effect of season as longitudinal fluctuations occur in ambient temperature, roughage quality, staff composition, and stocking density. In the present study it was attempted to control for such factors, firstly by ensuring equal age distribution between the groups compared. Furthermore, when comparing bulls that had been housed at different times of the year, the comparison was made by using year as the grouping variable, ensuring that any seasonal influence would be similar across the two groups. However, the herd composition was not fully comparable from 2011 to 2012, or the graphs in e.g. Fig. 3 would have been more congruent and eventually differed only in level. Early 2011 had an influx of an unusual large group of young test bulls. A full adjustment for age differences was not possible and this may have influenced the statistics for the first part of the year. However, in the following months this effect fades as the curves attain similar shapes.",

            "text": "To provide even more robust comparisons, it would have been preferable to use more years than just one for comparison with the outbreak year. Preceding years, e.g. 2010 were considered, but these years were also problem years with high frequency of respiratory disease cases, which was in fact the reason why the initial research project was started. Those years may not have made a meaningful contrast and were therefore abandoned. Even earlier years were not readily available from the test centre's recording system and shortly after 2012, weight gain was no longer one of the phenotypic test variables. The quality control of this variable was then less rigorous and it would consequently not be as suitable for analysis. However, the value of adding several seasons of comparisons also has its limits. Pooling too many years would tend to compound a lot of variation from many sources into an average that may or may not represent a good base for comparisons. Our comparison year has a well-documented health status and is close to the outbreak year, which ensures that herd level factors have had less time to change. The true size of the effect of the outbreak in the study herd is arguably underestimated by our analyses. The higher number of deaths in the outbreak year compared to the control year is one cause. These cases could obviously not be fully included in analyses or graphs, but had they lived, their data would undoubtedly have emphasized the poor performance of their group. Furthermore, the available bull level disease information was in the form of a dichotomous treatment variable, which certainly will classify the sickest animals correctly but probably missed some bulls with milder clinical signs. Nevertheless, these bulls may also show decreased performance parameters. On the other hand, genetic progress would in itself contribute to higher performance the next year, which produces an opposite estimation bias. However, the increase in growth rate in this cattle population is well documented and amounts to a reduction of 1 day in a bull's time to slaughter [34] , which is on a lower order of magnitude than the differences found in the present study and therefore not very important to the discussion.",

More specifically, the study shows that BRSV affects the growth performance of bulls for several months after infection. The effect is most pronounced in animals that are seriously affected during infection, but a significant loss of performance can also be detected in animals showing mild or no signs of disease, and despite apparent recovery. This amounts to a significant part of the costs associated with BRSV, however they may easily be underestimated. Such losses are of great concern to the farmer and must be taken into account in any cost-benefit analysis of preventive measures towards BRSV infection, whether on herd or population level.",
