            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoV) comprise a large group of emerging human and animal pathogens, including the highly pathogenic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) strains. The molecular mechanisms regulating emerging coronavirus pathogenesis are complex and include virus-host interactions associated with entry, replication, egress and innate immune control. Epigenetics research investigates the genetic and non-genetic factors that regulate phenotypic variation, usually caused by external and environmental factors that alter host expression patterns and performance without any change in the underlying genotype. Epigenetic modifications, such as histone modifications, DNA methylation, chromatin remodeling, and non-coding RNAs, function as important regulators that remodel host chromatin, altering host expression patterns and networks in a highly flexible manner. For most of the past two and a half decades, research has focused on the molecular mechanisms by which RNA viruses antagonize the signaling and sensing components that regulate induction of the host innate immune and antiviral defense programs upon infection. More recently, a growing body of evidence supports the hypothesis that viruses, even lytic RNA viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm, have developed intricate, highly evolved, and well-coordinated processes that are designed to regulate the host epigenome, and control host innate immune antiviral defense processes, thereby promoting robust virus replication and pathogenesis. In this article, we discuss the strategies that are used to evaluate the mechanisms by which viruses regulate the host epigenome, especially focusing on highly pathogenic respiratory RNA virus infections as a model. By combining measures of epigenome reorganization with RNA and proteomic datasets, we articulate a spatial-temporal data integration approach to identify regulatory genomic clusters and regions that play a crucial role in the host's innate immune response, thereby defining a new viral antagonism mechanism following emerging coronavirus infection.",

From the initial outbreak, SARS-CoV rapidly spread across the globe causing 8000 infections and~800 deaths in 28 countries; mortality rates approached 50% in aged individuals [1] [2] [3] . From its animal reservoir in Chinese horseshoe bats (genus Rhinolophus), the SARS-CoV was thought to have adapted to Palm civets and raccoon dogs in open markets, before finally colonizing human populations [4] . More recent studies have shown that SARS-CoV, as well as a large reservoir of SARS-like bat CoV (SL-CoV) have the ability to efficiently utilize the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor for docking and entry and replicate efficiently in primary human airway epithelial cells. These data document the presence of a large animal reservoir (ORFs) . The 5\u2032 end is capped and contains a leader sequence (L). SARS-CoV encodes for 14 ORFs, including ORF1, which is processed into nsp1 to nsp16, 4 structural ORFs (S, E, M, and N) in grey, and luxury downstream ORFs (3a, 3b, 6, 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b and 9b). nsp: nonstructural protein; S: spike; E: envelope; M: matrix; and N: nucleoprotein.",

Following infection, pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) such as retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5), Toll-like receptors (e.g., TLR 3, 4 and 7) and other sensing molecules recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) in viral components, such as viral structure proteins or viral nucleic acid. Successful recognition initiates a signaling cascade that activates an antiviral state in the host. Several main players of innate immunity, such as signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88), TLR4, TLR7 and TLR3/TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-\u03b2 (TRIF), function to dampen infection severity during coronavirus infection in vivo [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . Similarly, interferons (IFN\u2212alpha (\u03b1) and IFN-beta (\u03b2), IFN-gamma (\u03b3)) also play critical roles in controlling SARS-CoV in vivo and in vitro [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] 18, 19] . Data from the 2002/2003 outbreak have demonstrated that differential IFN and interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression levels in patients correlated with SARS disease outcomes. Several mouse models for SARS-CoV pathogenesis confirmed protective roles of MyD88, TLRs and select ISGs [12, 14, 16, 20] .",

            "text": "Like other viral pathogens, coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have evolved genetic functions that delay and/or antagonize pathogen recognition as well as ISG effector functions. SARS-CoV encodes several proteins that modulate innate immune signaling through the antagonism of the induction of interferon. As mentioned above, several nsps that are encoded by ORF1 (ORF1a/b), like nsp1, nsp3 papain-like protease, nsp14 and nsp16 antagonize various sensing or signaling programs and NF\u03ba\u03b2, or function to cap viral messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and evade interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFIT) 1-3 ISGs [11, [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] (Figure 1 ). These nsps show high homology to proteins of other human coronaviruses and are critical for efficient viral replication. Several downstream open reading frames like ORF3a, ORF3b and ORF6 also antagonize sensing or signaling pathways, or block karyopherin 2 nuclear import [13, 21] (Figure 1 ). MERS-CoV also encodes several luxury functions with interferon antagonism activities, including ORF4a, ORF4b and perhaps ORF5, noting that ORF4b antagonizes phosphodiesterase activity and RNAse L activation [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . However, how the exact underlying mechanisms allow these antagonistic molecules to interfere with the effector molecules that establish an antiviral state, assist in wound repair, or prime and enhance an adaptive immune response, which is critical for clearance, is still under study. Recent studies have suggested that RNA viruses like coronaviruses and influenza viruses are able to manipulate the host's epigenome, potentially heralding entirely new mechanisms of viral antagonism and new targets for therapeutic intervention and control [18, 31] . The purpose of this review is to summarize the available methodology to study the epigenetic mechanisms that allow study of the epigenome during infection with coronavirus and other RNA viruses.",

Over the last decade, research efforts have revealed a dynamic range of epigenetic factors that shape and regulate chromatin status, leading to changes in host gene expression patterns, and therefore to alterations in phenotypes. Epigenetic modifications are significant in regulating cellular mechanisms and pathways during embryonic development, in memory function, in immunity and in disease [32, 33] . While mutations directly affect the genetic material by changing the genetic code, epigenetic modifications change the chromatin structure or modify the nucleic acid without altering the genetic code. This makes epigenetic modifications reversible, flexible, and quickly responsive to changes in the environment and other exposures. Based on this ability, the study of epigenetic modifications is an important interface between the environment and the genome [32] . Over the last decade, epigenetics research has made rapid progress in understanding developmental biology, memory, and inheritability functions. More recently, it has become increasingly important in studies of oncology, adaptive and innate immunity, and infectious diseases [34, 35] . It is becoming well established that many DNA viruses, and to some lesser extent RNA viruses, have evolved functions that antagonize the regulatory machine of the host epigenome, leading to regulated changes in host gene expression that lead to a favorable environment for virus replication and spread [36] .",

Another benefit of the human genome project was the development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology. Epigenetics research adopted the NGS techniques early on by refining methods like ChIP-Seq, RNA-Seq, and MeDIP-Seq [38, 39] . Today, these are routine methods for the investigation of genome-wide changes in DNA methylation, histone modification, and DNA-protein interactions. Similarly, in the field of infectious disease research, high-throughput DNA analyses have enabled the genome-wide examination of epigenetic modifications and DNA methylation, providing systematic, large-scale association testing with disease phenotypes. It is likely that many common diseases, cancers, and infectious disease outcomes in humans are mediated by genetic and environmental factors. Likewise, epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) provide a systematic identification of genome-wide epigenetic variants associated with disease outcomes [40] . EWAS can collect information about variation of epigenetic markers, global epigenetic patterns, and genome-wide distribution of epigenetic markers which can provide functional correlation with genotypes and phenotypes associated with particular pathological or non-pathological outcomes, defining new disease-associated marks [40, 41] . In particular, the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project has advanced our understanding of the principles of genome, epigenome and chromatin organization, discovering and identifying formerly unknown histone modifications, nucleosome positions, and chromosome-wide maps of regulatory chromatin structures [38, 42, 43] . GENCODE, a part of ENCODE, now contains an extensive catalogued transcript, and pseudogene and long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) resources, helping to develop and to identify histone modifications and variants from several combinatorial patterns that define active promoters/TSSs (transcription start sites), transcribed gene bodies, inactive regions, and enhancers [44, 45] . Several techniques described below are now commonly used in studies that integrate different data types including transcriptomics, proteomics, and epigenomics [46] . These allow us to validate and discover new molecular pathways that could lead to new discoveries in developmental biology, memory, and disease.",

At this time, several chemical modifications have been identified and characterized: lysine acetylation, lysine and arginine methylation, serine and threonine phosphorylation, and lysine ubiquitination and sumoylation. These modifications are found on H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 histone subunits [48, 49] . In 2001, Jenuwein and colleagues described the histone code, hypothesizing that a coding mechanism within the chromatin structure is regulated by chemical modifications to the histone tail, a concept which is now well supported by the literature [50] . We now know that distinct modifications of the histone tails interact with different sets of chromatin-associated proteins ( Table 1) . As a result, modifications on the same or different histone tails may be interdependent and generate various combinations on any one nucleosome, thereby supporting the modification-induced recruitment of chromatin-associated proteins. Consequently, the specificity of the downstream information is guaranteed and a specific crosstalk between histone modifications is possible. The last decade has shown that this regulatory instance of nucleosomes and chromatin structure on the genome has emerged as a critically important determinant of cellular transcription, replication, and differentiation state.",

To match the complexity of the modification patterns, 'readers' are often organized in protein complexes, containing a bromodomain, chromodomain, and tudor domains and harboring several putative modification-dependent binding sites. Many of the histone modifying enzymes belong to complex protein superfamilies that show stringent substrate, catalytic, and tissue specificity. This way, these proteins regulate DNA accessibility together with ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes, which are mediating remodeling of nucleosomes, like moving, ejecting or restructuring nucleosomes. This mediates pioneer transcription factors, that are involved in recruiting transcription machinery complexes, like the RNA polymerase II (Pol II) complex, or insulator proteins, to bind at nucleosome-free DNA regions and initiate gene expression.

It occurs at the 5 position of the cytosine ring within CpG nucleotides by adding a methyl group to create 5-methylcytosine (5mC). The modification is mediated by a family of enzymes, the DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) ( Figure 2B ). DNMT3a and DNMT3b have been described as de novo methyltransferases, preferentially targeting unmethylated CpG islands (CGIs) in the genome to initiate DNA methylation [64] . Studies have shown that DNMT1 functions as maintenance methyltrasferase, ensuring that the methylation status is maintained during DNA replication and following cell division [65] . However, DNA methylation as an epigenetic marker is highly dynamic, and therefore crucial in gene silencing and gene regulation, the establishment of heterochromatin, and in regulating the stability of the chromosome [66] . Hypermethylation of repetitive DNA sequences in combination with certain histone marks results in the condensation of chromatin and therefore in the establishment of heterochromatin [67] . Recently, DNA hydroxymethylation (5hmC) has been identified as another form of DNA methylation. Several studies have shown that enzymes of the ten-eleven translocation (TET)-family catalyze the modification and that it has a major role in embryonic neuronal development. [68, 69] .",

For many years, lncRNAs were considered to be unimportant junk byproducts of evolution and were ignored by most of the research community. However, this group of RNAs is now recognized as a critical regulator in chromatin remodeling, transcriptional regulation, and post-transcriptional processing [72] . Epigenetics and microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate whole gene expression patterns transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally, respectively ( Figure 2C ) [73] . At the same time, epigenetics and miRNAs control each other to form a regulatory circuit and to maintain normal physiological functions [74] . Several miRNAs have been identified that target genes that control epigenetic pathways, like DNMTs and histone methyltransferases (HMTs), thus controlling chromatin structure by regulating by regulating histone modifier molecules. The expression of miRNAs on the other hand is regulated by histone modification and DNA methylation, forming an epigenetics-miRNA regulatory circuit [73] .",

In brief, genomic DNA is sheared and precipitated with a monoclonal antibody that recognizes 5-methylcytidine. Another approach based on immune precipitation is the Methyl-DNA binding protein ChIP using the Methyl-CpG-binding domain protein 2 (MBD2), a member of the MBD protein family. The resulting enrichment of methylated DNA can be determined by PCR to assess the methylation state of CpG islands in individual promoters or gene regions of interest. Alternatively, precipitated methylated DNA can be combined with large-scale analysis using microarrays or next-generation-sequencing [84, 85] .",

Another approach uses restriction enzymes, like HpaII/MspI, which are blocked or not blocked by CpG methylation. After treatment of the total DNA with the enzymes the distribution and extent of DNA methylation can be analyzed by quantitative PCR targeting regions of interest.

The innate immune system not only regulates cell intrinsic defense programs in response to microbial attack but also has a critical role in activating and shaping the adaptive immune response. The innate immune system accomplishes this by being able to generate and drive a transcriptional response that is both cell-and stimulus-specific.

These PAMPs use unique and overlapping signaling cascades to activate effector transcriptional programs that regulate antimicrobial defense pathways. Most of the research has focused on elucidating the exact signaling programs that regulate antimicrobial defense to different pathogens and the microbial countermeasures that inactive specific pathways [92, 93] . More recently, a growing body of evidence has determined that chromatin modifications and epigenetic regulation play a crucial role in shaping the activated host response to a microbial invasion [35, 94, 95] . Advances in sequencing technologies have significantly increased our ability to sensitively and specifically measure the transcriptional state at a single-cell level. Systems biology approaches have revealed the more complex gene interaction networks that become activated or repressed. These mechanisms have been essential in understanding the functional specialization of cells as individual units of the innate immune system, the flexibility in mounting innate and inflammatory immune response, and in deciphering the mechanism of communication and interactions within specific cell populations.",

These cell-specific signals can be mediated through cell-cell contact or by secretion of IFN and TNF. Thus, the ability of their epigenome to change within minutes after a stimulus is not just essential for initiating a rapid antiviral host response but is also essential to ensure a persistent and specific defense response. This way, epigenetic mechanisms are responsible for the priming and the memory of these responses and for guaranteeing a functional and highly regulated host response beyond the initial activation wave.",

The infection of Calu3 cells with the tested respiratory viruses resulted in diverse virus-specific ISG expression signatures. The highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza A (HPIA) virus showed a rapid manipulation of ISG with strong down-and up-regulation of specific ISG sets at 7 h post infection. In contrast, the 2009 pandemic H1N1 strain showed no ISG modulation, and the infected cells mounted a robust IFN-induced antiviral state starting at 3 h post infection. SARS-CoV infection of Calu3 cells also showed a strong induction of ISG effectors, but the response was significantly delayed with peak expression at 24 to 48 h post infection. In 2012, the newly emerged MERS-CoV showed delayed ISG production with effects visible at 18-h post infection (hpi), with significant inhibition of expression of specific ISG subsets. Overall, the viral manipulation of the host antiviral IFN response results in successful virus infection and viral replication, defining a viral antagonistic approach, which may be a mechanism to interfere with the host's innate immune response [22] .",

We showed that the promoter regions of ISG genes contained more histones with active marks of H3K4me than the repressive H3K27me3 mark, therefore favoring open chromatin and promoting active transcription and ISG expression during H1N1-2009 and SARS-CoV infection. In contrast, infection of Calu3 with the highly pathogenic HPAI and MERS-CoV resulted in increased levels of H3K27me3 and decreased levels of H3K4me3 occupancy at the promoter regions of subsets of specific ISGs, which were not induced, demonstrating that these viruses have developed antagonistic mechanisms to specifically target the IFN arm of the innate immunity ( Figure 4 ). We have expanded this dataset by using a genome-wide ChIP-Seq approach. This allows us to choose any set of cellular effector molecules and to study their histone modification profile during infection. Figure 5 shows as an example the expression profile of ISGs during the early phase MERS-CoV infection. As already described by Menachery et al., expression of ISGs effectors occurred rather late after infection at 12 hpi to 18 hpi. However, MERS-CoV infection in Calu3 induces the upregulation and down-regulation of ISGs. We then applied ChIP-Seq data to the expression data. When we looked at the expression level of ISG transcripts at 18 hpi, we could see how the histone modification promoter profile at 12 hpi corresponded with the transcriptomic data. ISGs that were downregulated during infection showed increased occupancy of H3K27m3 modification in their promoter region (indicated in yellow) and ISGs that were upregulated during infection showed increased occupancy of H3K4me3 within their promoter region (blue).",

Combining systems biology approaches like epigenomic, transcriptomic and proteomic datasets provides a data integration approach to identify regulatory genomic clusters and regions that play a crucial role in the host's antiviral response (Figure 7 ) [116, 117] . Moreover, systems biology approaches allow the development of models to make comparisons of data across pathogens to better predict complex biological systems. For example, the integration across systems-based data types will allow us to predict gene expression and to infer new gene regulatory networks. Using comparatively generated data from multiple levels of biological systems will allow the association between phenotypic outcome and variation, and the prediction of gene expression using only a few epigenetic features ( Figure 7 ) [117, 118] . These genome-wide based predictions are essential to define and interpret gene regulatory networks (GRNs). By linking epigenetic features to gene activation, gene expression levels are integrated into enrichment profiles which can be interpreted as clusters of differential enrichment patterns and then used to map interactions of virus and host to infer the identity of genes that are implicated in disease and pathogenesis associated with the virus [117] . Mechanisms by which viruses could modulate the host's chromatin include sequestration and displacement of chromatin-associated proteins, interference with the chromatin remodeling machinery, DNA-binding transcription factors, histone modifying enzymes, and direct alteration of methylation and acetylation state of histones and histone mimicry [18, 31, 114, 115] .

            "text": "Recent advancements through basic research in the understanding of the mechanisms involved in viral chromatin modification in lytic viruses have opened a new window into previously unknown mechanisms of viral antagonism and host-virus interactions, including genetic factors that influence both protective or pathogenic host responses. The subsequent identification and improved understanding of these mechanisms open new avenues for the development of antiviral drugs by illuminating new targets for specific inhibitors. Established model systems for latent and persistent viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) and herpesviruses have already demonstrated modulation of the viral infection by chromatin [119, 120] . As described here, a growing number of studies also show modulation of viral infection by chromatin in lytic virus infections. The emerging parallels between the existing knowledge of chromatin's effect on and interaction with latent and persistent viruses and the emerging understanding of its comparable interaction with lytic viruses suggest that a greater focus on chromatin-based therapies for a variety of virus families could reveal fundamental new landscapes of virus-host interaction that play critical roles in disease severity.",
