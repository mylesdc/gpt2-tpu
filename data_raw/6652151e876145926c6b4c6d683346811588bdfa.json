Effort to find antivirals for it has focused on bioflavonoids, a plant-derived polyphenolic compounds with many potential health benefits. In the present study, antiviral activity of four types of bioflavonoid against dengue virus type -2 (DENV-2) in Vero cell was evaluated. Anti-dengue activity of these compounds was determined at different stages of DENV-2 infection and replication cycle. DENV replication was measured by Foci Forming Unit Reduction Assay (FFURA) and quantitative RT-PCR. Selectivity Index value (SI) was determined as the ratio of cytotoxic concentration 50 (CC 50 ) to inhibitory concentration 50 (IC 50 ) for each compound. Results: The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) of quercetin against dengue virus was 35.7 \u03bcg mL -1 when it was used after virus adsorption to the cells. The IC 50 decreased to 28.9 \u03bcg mL -1 when the cells were treated continuously for 5 h before virus infection and up to 4 days post-infection. The SI values for quercetin were 7.07 and 8.74 \u03bcg mL -1 , respectively, the highest compared to all bioflavonoids studied. Naringin only exhibited antiadsorption effects against DENV-2 with IC 50 = 168.2 \u03bcg mL -1 and its related SI was 1.3. Daidzein showed a weak anti-dengue activity with IC 50 = 142.6 \u03bcg mL -1 when the DENV-2 infected cells were treated after virus adsorption. The SI value for this compound was 1.03. Hesperetin did not exhibit any antiviral activity against DENV-2. The findings obtained from Foci Forming Unit Reduction Assay (FFURA) were corroborated by findings of the qRT-PCR assays. Quercetin and daidzein (50 \u03bcg mL -1 ) reduced DENV-2 RNA levels by 67% and 25%, respectively. There was no significant inhibition of DENV-2 RNA levels with naringin and hesperetin.",

            "text": "Dengue virus (DENV) is a member of the genus flavivirus of the Flaviviridae family. It is a significant human pathogen which causes a wide spectrum of clinical illnesses ranging from a silent or mild febrile infection, self-limited dengue fever (DF) to the severe dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). There are four dengue virus genotypes, DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3 and DENV-4 which are transmitted to humans mainly by two species of mosquitoes, Aedes agypti and Aedes Albopictus [1] . All four DENV can cause dengue. To date there are no effective vaccine or antiviral treatment for dengue. Dengue patients are usually supportively-treated until they recover without any specific treatment measures. Several studies have shown that the level of viremia correlates with the severity of disease with high viremia often seen in severe dengue. Hence, antivirals that can reduce the level of viremia or the viremic phase could possibly reduce the severity of dengue.",

Hesperetin is a flavonone and its glycoside form, hesperidin is water soluble and it could be found in various citrus fruits. After ingestion of hesperidin, its sugar moiety is released from the backbone of this compound and the aglycone form known as hesperetin can be released. In vitro antiviral activities of hesperetin have been reported against some RNA viruses [14] [15] [16] . Naringin on the other hand, is a flavonone glycoside found abundantly in grapefruit juice. Antiviral activity of naringin were reported against HSV-1 and HSV-2 but this finding remains controversial [12, 17] . Daidzein is an isoflavone found in soybeans and its antiviral activity against influenza viruses has been reported [18] . Currently, there is no published data on the possible anti-dengue virus activities of quercetin, hesperetin, naringin and daidzein. Therefore, in this study we evaluated these compounds activities on DENV-2 (NGC strain) replication in cell culture system. The effects of each compound were evaluated against different stages of dengue virus replication including virus adsorption, intracellular replication and direct virucidal activities.",

Viral RNA was extracted using two types of RNA extraction kits (QIAamp Viral RNA mini kit and RNeasy mini kit) (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Quantitative RT-PCR assay was performed by adding 1 \u03bcl of extracted DENV RNA to the SensiMix SYBR green reagent (Quantace, Watford, United Kingdom) which contained 7.4 \u03bcl ddH2O, 10 \u03bcl 2X SensiMix One-Step, 0.4 \u03bcl 50X SYBR Green solution, 10 units of RNAse Inhibitor, 50 pmol of forward (DNF) and also reverse (D2R) primers [21] . All samples were assayed in triplicate. The amplifications were performed using the DNA Engine Opticon system (MJ Research/Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) with the following thermal conditions: reverse transcription at 50\u00b0C for 30 min, initial denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 10 min, followed by 45 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 sec, 59\u00b0C for 30 sec and 72\u00b0C for 30 sec. Melting curve analysis was subsequently performed at temperature from 60\u00b0C to 98\u00b0C to verify the assay specificity. For absolute quantitation of the viral RNA, a standard curve was established with a serially diluted RNA extracted from DENV-2 stock with known titer.",

The noted differences between SI values for quercetin could be due to the intracellular accumulation of quercetin during continuous treatment. A weak effect for prophylactic activity of quercetin however, was also observed. These findings suggest that the main anti-dengue activity of quercetin is likely due to its activity against the different stages of intracellular replication of DENV-2 instead of early stages of its replication cycle such as virus attachment or entry.

However, the effects of other flavonoids against cellular RNA polymerases and formation of the complex with RNA have been reported suggesting that quercetin could also affect the similar replication enzymes [25, 26] . Sylimarin, a flavonoid found effective against hepatitis C virus (HCV), another member of flaviviridae family [27] , inhibits virus replication by inhibiting the activity of viral RNA polymerase. In our study, results from the qRT-PCR supported the findings from the viral foci reduction assays that quercetin inhibits DENV-2 replication and the significant reduction in the DENV specific RNA suggests that quercetin may also target the virus replication machinery, namely by inhibiting the RNA polymerase. Antiviral activity of naringin has been evaluated against few herpesviruses and rotavirus but their reported antiviral activities against HSV-1 and HSV-2 are inconclusive [12, 17] . In addition it was reported that naringin did not exhibit any antiviral activity against another RNA virus, sindbis virus [14] . In the present study, the only anti-dengue activity of this flavonoid was demonstrated against adsorption and attachment of virus to the Vero cells and based on its antiviral activity (IC 50 = 168.2 \u03bcg mL -1 ) and its related selectivity index (SI = 1.3), it may not be a good candidate for further development as anti-dengue drug. Similarly, daidzein activity against DENV-2 was not significant compared to quercetin (SI = 1.03). Continuous treatment of the infected Vero cells from 5 h before virus infection up to 4 days post infection did not improve its anti-dengue activity significantly. This compound therefore, could not be a suitable candidate for further development as anti-dengue drug. Hesperetin, the other flavonoid evaluated in our study, did not show no anti-dengue activity in any stages of virus infection and replication processes and this is despite the previously reported antiviral activity of hesperetin against sindbis virus [14] . Therefore, hesperetin is also not recommended for further investigations for anti-dengue drug development. In all our experiments, we showed that 0.5% of DMSO, the highest concentration of solvent used in the bioflavonoid treatment did not exhibit any antiviral activity against DENV-2 and this eliminated any probable antiviral activity from DMSO.",

While the flavonoids in general share common basic molecular base structure, flavone (2-phenyl-1,4-benzopyrone), we showed here that the flavanone, hesperetin, and flavanone glycoside, naringin, showed no significant anti-DENV replication activities. In addition, we had earlier shown that naringenin [28] , another flavanone metabolized from naringin and here, daidzein, an isoflavone also had no significant DENV replication inhibition properties. While quercetin was shown here to be effective in inhibiting DENV replication, its glycoside form, rutin (quercetin-3-O-rutinoside) showed no significant inhibition properties [28] . These suggest that while flavonol could be the basic molecule that possesses anti DENV replication properties, specific structural properties of the different flavonol derivatives would have different effects on the efficacy of the compounds against dengue.",

Several strategies to increase the bioavailability of quercetin that include using lipids and emulsifiers, co-crystalization of quercetin or using ester-based precursors have been investigated [32] [33] [34] . The other topic of research would be combination drug study. At its current calculated IC 50 values, the antiviral efficacy of quercetin can be further improved possibly by combining it with other potential anti-dengue compounds. This is exemplified in a study that reported the synergistic effect of \u03b1glucoside in combination with a standard antiviral drug, ribavirin is effective against dengue infection [35] .",

Similarly, qRT-PCR analysis showed that there was no significant decrease in copy number of DENV-2 RNA following direct treatment of DENV-2 with the different concentrations of each compound (data not shown).DiscussionRecent studies have shown that flavonoids such as glabranine and 7-O-Methyle glabranine exhibited significant antiviral activities against dengue virus. In vitro treatment of infected cells with these flavonoids resulted in Anti-viral assay of flavonoids against DENV-2 intracellular replication. Foci forming unit reduction assay (FFURA) was used to evaluate the in vitro anti-dengue virus activities of flavonoids after viral adsorption (a) and the respective DENV-2 RNA copies were quantified using qRT-PCR (b).
