In spite of these challenges, hospital wastes are sometimes not properly handled in Nigeria. To date, there has not been an adequate study on the effect and fate of burnt hospital waste on agricultural soil. The effect of burnt hospital wastes on the agricultural soil was conducted on soils sampled around farm settlement near Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospital Complex, Ile-Ife, South West Nigeria. PIXE technique was employed with a 1.7 MV 5SDH Tandem Pelletron accelerator available at Centre for Energy Research and Development O.A.U Ile-Ife, Nigeria. Eleven elements-Si, Cl, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Zr and Pb were detected and their concentrations and enrichment factors determined. The presence of Pb and Cl at the elevated concentrations range of (77.8 \u00b1 3.5 -279.6 \u00b1 97.6 and 102.2 \u00b1 37.4 -167.2\u00b117.43) ppm respectively in this study, is of serious health concern because of the agricultural practices in the neighborhoods of the study sites. There is a need for proper handling of hospital and other related hazardous wastes because of the possibility of such posing serious environmental pollution problems.",

About 2.5 million tons of waste is generated per year around OAUTHC complex (Inyang, 2010) . A large amount of solid waste is generated in the hospital during diagnosis and treatment of diseases. The solid waste may contain human organs, bandages, syringes, test tubes, tissues cell culture and other plastic materials. These wastes can cause health hazards and indeed, is a veritable source of transmission of HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B and other diseases. The incinerator is an effective and hygienic way for disposal of hospital waste. It is only in very few teaching hospitals in Nigeria that there exits functional incinerators. In Western Europe more than 600 incinerator plants are in operation Li et al., 2003 . The dumping of infectious/toxic waste on the soil and sometimes burning them like the case in this study, can lead to contamination of crops and underground water which can cause very serious harm to unsuspected consumers.",

The soil samples were thoroughly mixed in clean plastic buckets before sub samples were collected, taken to the laboratory, air dried and sieved through 2 mm sieve. The dried samples for pelleting were ground in agate mortar/pestle. A 20% ultrapure Carbon was added to each of the samples. The soil sample and the ultrapure carbon where afterward homogenised in the agate mortar before pelletization was done. The protocol adopted so as to avoid the cross contamination of the samples during grinding and pelleting are detailed somewhere Inyang et al., 2012. From each sample 13 mm diameter of about 20 g weight thick pellets were made with Spec-caps by applying 10 t pressure with hydraulic pelletized machine. The soil sampling was conducted in the month of July, 2010, about the peak of rain season when topsoil is predominantly wet with fresh loading of metal contaminants.",

A Canberra Si (Li) detector Model ESLX 30-150, with the associated pulse processing electronics and Canberra Genie 2000 (3.1) MCA card interfaced to a PC were used for the X-ray data acquisition.

The values obtained in this study which are above the maximum allowable contents of metals for agricultural purposes as proposed by Blankenship et al. 1994 in these soils are indicative of anthropogenic action of the burnt hospital waste dump on the soil total elemental composition. For example, the mean content of Zn obtained by other investigators with soil of anthropogenic sources in different countries ranged from 17 to 125 ppm (Blankenship et al. 1994; Kramlich et al. 1989) which is in agreement with the findings in this study.

According to Table 2 the enrichment of the potential toxic elements like Cl and Pb could not be calculated because of the absence of these elements in the reference material (the control). Potassium, Ti and Mn showed moderate enrichment with ranged factor of (2-5) while Si, Ca and were significantly enriched with the ranged factor of (5-20). Iron showed the highest enrichment (Table 2 ) in this study having the average enrichment factor of 23.9. Obiajunwa et al. (2002) had advocated that enrichment factor greater than 10 can cause adverse health effect to soil plant, man and animal. Nevertheless the presence of Cl and Pb in the site of the study and the absence of the same in the control can be attributable to the pollution (contamination) from the burnt hospital waste. The accuracy of our experimental values was assured by the analysis of the soil standard IAEA soil-7. The results of this analysis, presented in Table 3 , are in good agreement with the certified values (IAEA 2000).",

The PIXE technique used in the analysis of soil sampled around burnt hospital waste dump at the OAUTH Complex Ile-Ife, south western Nigeria was adequate for this kind of study. Eleven elements-Si, Cl, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Zr and Pb were detected at an elevated concentration when compared with the control. In all highest enrichment was obtained in Fe. Moderate enrichment factors for Si, K, Ca, Ti, Cr and Zr were obtained. The level and the fate of these elements especially Cl and Pb is of serious environmental and health concern owing to the fact that there are intensive subsistence agricultural practices at and near the sites of the study. A future investigation to quantify dioxin and furan that is associated with the geochemistry of Cl is essential owing to the toxicity of these compounds.",
