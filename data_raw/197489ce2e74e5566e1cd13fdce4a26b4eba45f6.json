To verify the whether IGEs suppress IAV replication in a PACT-dependent manner, IAV RNA replication, expression of PACT and the phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 in A549 cells were detected; the levels of IFN\u03b2, PACT and PKR in mouse lung tissues were determined; and the activity of IAV polymerase was evaluated in PACT-compromised cells. The results indicated that IGEs sufficiently alleviated cell damage and suppressed IAV replication in vitro, protecting mice from IAV-induced injury and lethal IAV infection. These anti-IAV effects might be related to disrupted interplay between IVA polymerase and PACT and/or prevention of a PACT-dependent overactivated IFN-I antiviral response. Taken together, our findings reveal a new facet of the mechanisms by which IGEs fight the influenza A virus in a PACT-dependent manner.",

            "text": "Influenza virus polymerase requires a large number of host cell factors to engage in the viral RNA transcription and replication processes 19, 20 . The interactions between influenza polymerase and host cell factors were identified by diverse methods, such as genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) screens 21 , proteomic approaches 22 , and systematic immunoprecipitation analysis 23 . Host factor PACT is a double-stranded RNA-binding protein that is also known to be an activator of the cellular dsRNA-dependent protein kinase, PKR 24 . PACT is involved in the interaction between influenza A virus (IAV) and host cells, and it can substantially enhance RIG-I activation and phosphorylate eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2\u03b1) to induce an IFN type I response, which is suppressed by the nonstructural influenza virus protein NS1 25, 26 . Recently, researchers have emphasized that, during IAV infection, PACT exerts its antiviral activity primarily by interacting with and inhibiting IAV polymerase. It has been demonstrated that PACT is associated with PA, PB1, and PB2 27 . Compromising PACT in IAV-infected A549 cells led to the enhancement of vRNA transcription and replication and IFN\u03b2 production. In addition, vRNA replication was increased by knocking down PACT in both A549 cells and IFN-insufficient Vero cells 28 .",

PACT functions as an activator of RIG-I to facilitate the viral induction of type I IFNs. To verify the type I IFN response induced by IAV infection, the levels of IFN\u03b2, PACT and PKR in the lung tissues were evaluated by ELISAs. Five days after the mice were inoculated with influenza virus A/FM1/47, the levels of IFN\u03b2, PACT and PKR were remarkably more pronounced.

According to the results of the dual-luciferase reporter gene assay, the HEK-293T cells transfected with only with pFlu-luc showed very low relative luciferase activity for the IAV RNA polymerase. In contrast, cells co-transfected with plasmids containing NP, PA, PB1, PB2 and Flu-luc showed relatively high RNA polymerase activity. Of note, our results indicated that knocking down PACT enhanced IAV polymerase activity, a finding that was consistent with that of a previous study. Hence, virus replication that was catalysed by IAV polymerase was enhanced by compromising the action of PACT, which was identified as an antiviral host factor. In addition, IGEs treatment at doses of 320 and 160 \u03bcg/ml showed a relatively weak suppressive effect on IAV polymerase activity in the PACT-knockdown HEK-293T cells. Collectively, the data from the current study demonstrated that IGEs treatment might inhibit IAV replication in a PACT-dependent manner.",

            "text": "In conclusion, our research indicated that IGEs sufficiently alleviated cell damage and suppressed IAV replication in vitro, protected the lung tissues from IAV-induced injury in mice models of influenza-induced pneumonia and rescued mice from lethal IAV infection. These anti-IAV effects might be related to disrupted interplay between the IVA polymerase and the cellular double-stranded RNA-binding protein PACT, which prevents the overactivation of the PACT-dependent IFN-I antiviral response induced by IAV infection. Taken together, our findings reveal a new facet of the mechanism of IGEs action against the influenza A virus, for which it inhibited IAV replication in a PACT-dependent manner. The current study might pave the way for the development of new antiviral agents against IAV. Sample preparation. First the powder of dried fruits (2 kg) was reflux-extracted twice with 70% ethanol, and then the extracts were combined and centrifuged. Next, the supernatant fluid was vacuum dried to remove traces of alcohol, and the concentrated solution was diluted with water to a mass concentration of 0.5 g/ml. The filtrate was passed through AB-8 macroporous resin and then successively eluted with water and 50% ethanol. www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ The 50% ethanol eluted fractions were combined and dried as the extract sample. The sample was stored at 4\u00b0C and dissolved in double distilled water at the time of use. The purity of the geniposide was 39.4%, and the purity of the iridoid glycosides in the sample was > 90%, as detected by UV spectrophotometry(T6, Beijing General Instrument Co. LTD, Beijing, China).",
