Bartha-DupGreen (BDG) was injected intraperitoneally or into the epididymal white adipose tissue (left side) to initiate retrograde transsynaptic spread of infection into the CNS, with or without the selective depletion of microglia with PLX5622. The propagation of infection in the brain was assessed 5 days after infection. Note the marked increase of PRV-immunopositive neurons (cyan) in the brain in the absence of microglia. This includes the spread of infection to higher cortical areas, including the piriform cortex, the insular cortex and the primary motor cortex after intraperitoneal injection. Due to the primarily sympathetic autonomic innervation of the white adipose tissue, the infection affects mostly the piriform cortex in microglia depleted animals, whereas the virus does not the reach the cerebral cortex in control mice. 3Vthird ventricle.

Microglial processes (dark DAB-precipitate, yellow pseudocolor) are found in the vicinity of neurons (cytoplasm: cyan pseudocolor, nucleus: green psudocolor). The infected neuron contains a high level of anti-PRV immunogold particles (black grains), viral capsids and mature virions (insert). The non-infected animal is void of viral particles and PRV-immunogold particles, confirming the specificity of the antibody. Scale bar: 1 \u00b5m. b) TEM images show that microglial processes (dark DAB-precipitate, yellow pseudocolor) find and contact PRV-infected neurons even at the early phases of infection, when only low levels of anti-PRV immunogold labeling is present (cytoplasm: cyan pseudocolor, nucleus: green psudocolor). Arrowheads mark sites of microglial contacts, arrows point to a synapse on the dendrite of an infected neuron. Scale bar: 300 nm on left panel, 200 nm on right panel. c) TEM pictures (first panel) show that DAB-positive microglia (yellow pseudocolor) completely lack viral capsids and anti-PRV immunogold particles, in contrary to PRV-infected neurons (cyan pseudocolor). Confocal pictures (second panel) showing that microglia do not express the immediate early GFP marker, in contrast to neurons, where a strong GFP expression can be seen in both the cell bodies and neurites. Scale bars: 1 \u00b5m on TEM images, 50 \u00b5m, 10 \u00b5m on the confocal panels. Neuronal cultures were infected with a low titre of BDG to induce slow propagation of infection enabling the investigation of apoptotic and dead cells by using neuron-specific live annexin V staining and Propidium iodide (PI), respectively. Infected neurons show neither annexin V binding nor PI uptake until several hours following the appearance of the immediate early reporter protein, GFP. Neuron-specific live annexin V staining was first detected in neurons with decaying GFP expression. Note GFP high /annexin -(asteriks) and GFP low /annexin + (arrowheads) cells. PI entered cells only with intense annexin V labelling and little or no detectable GFP expression (arrow) indicating advanced infection. Immunostaining of the same cell culture after 32h postinfection revealed viral structural proteins (PRV) both in the GFP high and GFP low cells, indicating that both immediate-early reporter protein expression and viral protein expression precede the onset of infection-induced neuronal apoptosis. The images were captured with a Zeiss Axiovert epifluorescent microscope. Scale bar: 50 \u03bcm. b) Propidium iodide (PI, red) uptake was not altered in infected neurons 16 hours after infection. This particular PI uptake experiment was performed in parallel cultures to those used for HPLC analysis (Fig4.a,b). Scale bar: 50 \u03bcm. Figure 7 . P2Y12 is expressed by Iba1-positive microglia in the brain. P2Y12 immunofluorescence precisely identifies microglia in the brain that are co-expressing the microglia/macrophage marker Iba1. Note that virtually all microglia are P2Y12-positive. P2Y12 immunostaining is absent in P2Y12 -/mice. P2Y12 immunofluorescence co-localises with Iba1 and GFP in Cx3Cr1 +/gfp microglia recruited to infected neurons expressing the immediate early marker, DSRed. Data are expressed as mean \u00b1 s.e.m. n.s.not significant, Scale bar: 100 \u00b5m (top), 50 \u00b5m (bottom). Figure 8 . The amount of disintegrated and dead cells is markedly increased in the brain in microglia-depleted and P2Y12 -/mice. a) Cresyl violet staining was performed on brain sections derived from control, P2Y12 -/and microglia-depleted mice 6 days after BDG infection. The number of disintegrated cells were increased (b), while the number of intact cells were markedly decreased (c) in the hypothalamus (PVN) of P2Y12 -/and microglia-depleted mice compared to control animals. d) The number of morphologically intact cells (based on cresyl violet staining) show negative correlation with the number of intact, PRV-immunopositive cells (as presented in Fig.2a ). e) The number of disintegrated, PRV-positive cells in Fig.2a correlates with morphologically damaged cells based on cresyl violet staining. b,c, one-way ANOWA, followed by Tukey's post hoc test, b, *P<0.05 Control vs P2Y12 -/-, **P<0.01 Control vs Depleted. c, one-way ANOWA, followed by tukey's post hoc test, **P<0.01 Control vs P2Y12 -/-; P2Y12 -/vs Depleted, ****P<0.0001 Control vs Depleted. Scale bar: 10 \u03bcm. Figure 9 . Selective depletion of microglia does interfere with main blood cell populations. Cx3Cr1 +/gfp mice were fed a PLX5622 chow diet for 21 days to deplete microglia. On the 16th day of the diet, a group of mice were injected with Bartha-DupGreen (BDG). Blood samples were collected from control mice and from mice 5 days after virus infection with or without microglia depletion, and labelled with mixtures of specific antibodies against leukocyte markers followed by flow cytometric analysis. Total blood cell counts were calculated by using 15 \u00b5m polystyrene microbeads (Polybead Microspheres, 18328-5). The number of CD8 -(P5 gate) T lymphocytes, CD11b + Ly6c + SSC high Ly6G + granulocytes (P8 gate), CD11b + Ly6c high Cx3Cr1 + (Ly6G -) monocytes (P7 gate) and MHCII + CD11b -B cells (P18 gate) were no different between control, depleted, control infected and depleted infected animals. In association with the profoundly increased CNS infection in microglia depleted mice, numbers of CD3 + CD8 + T lymphocytes (P4 gate) and CD11b + Ly6c + SSC high Ly6G + granulocytes (P8 gate) showed significant difference between depleted and depleted virus infected animals. Data are expressed as mean \u00b1 s.e.m. one-way ANOVA, n=4. n.s. -not significant. Figure 10 . Selective depletion of microglia does interfere with leukocyte numbers in the spleen. Cx3Cr1 +/gfp mice were fed a PLX5622 chow diet for 21 days to deplete microglia. On the 16 th day of the diet mice were injected with Bartha-DupGreen (BDG). Blood samples were collected from control mice and from mice 5 days after PRV infection, and labelled with mixtures of specific antibodies against leukocyte markers followed by flow cytometric analysis. Numbers of CD8 + T cells (P3 gate), CD8 -T cells (P4 gate) and MHCII + B cells (P9 gate) were not different between control, depleted, control infected and depleted infected animals. Spleen macrophages (Cx3Cr1-gfp + F4/80 + cells, P8 gate), granulocytes (P3* gate, CD11b + , Ly6c + , SSC high cells) and monocytes (P4# gate, CD11b low Ly6c vhigh cells) were not different between control, depleted, control infected and depleted infected mice. Data are expressed as mean \u00b1 s.e.m. One-way ANOVA, n=4. Figure 11 . Virus infection and selective manipulation of microglia do not alter the numbers of T lymphocytes in the brain. Cx3Cr1 +/gfp mice were fed a PLX5622 chow diet for 21 days to deplete microglia. On the 16 th day of the diet mice were injected with Bartha-DupGreen (BDG), to assess the role of microglia in inflammatory cell recruitment into the brain. Brain cells were isolated and T lymphocytes labelled with CD8, CD3 antibodies followed by flow cytometric analysis.

To enable a defined, exclusively retrograde transsynaptic spread of infection in vivo, the neuroinvasiveness of BDG was modified by insertion of a GFP gene expression cassette to the putative antisense promoter (ASP) located at the repeated invert region of the virus. This construct also allows time-mapping the spread of infection in individual cells [3, 4, 7] . The activity of the strong immediate-early promoter/enhancer of the human cytomegalovirus is independent from the viral protein, enabling very early stages of infection to be detected by GFP expression. PRV genes encoding structural proteins are driven by late promoters, resulting in the appearance of the virus proteins in the late stage of the infection. In a set of studies, mice were infected with BDG on 16 th day of PLX5622 diet to assess the effect of microglia depletion on central propagation of virus infection. For in vivo two-photon imaging, Cx3Cr1 GFP/+ mice were infected with PRV-Bartha-DupDsRed (BDR) [2] enabling the co-detection of infected neurons with microglia. The virus was grown in porcine kidney (PK)-15 cells to a titer of 6x10 8 plaque-forming units (PFU)/ml. After virus injection (10 \u03bcl intraperitoneally or into the epididymal white adipose tissue), mice were let to survive for 6 or 7 days and were regularly monitored for neurobehavioral symptoms.",

Then the sections were incubated for 48 hours in the following solutions of primary antibodies diluted in TBS: either guinea-pig anti-Iba1 (1:500, #234 004, Synaptic Systems) or chicken anti-eGFP (in case of the Cx3CR1 GFP/+ mice, 1:1000, #A10262, ThermoFisher Scientific) was mixed with rabbit anti-PRV (1:500, from Lynn Enquist). To eliminate non-specific binding, the anti-PRV antibody solution was incubated with control brain sections for one day before use. After repeated washes in TBS, sections were treated with blocking solution (Gel-BS) containing 0.5% cold water fish skin gelatin (#900.033, Aurion, The Netherlands) and 0.5% HSA in TBS for 1 h. This was followed by 24 h incubation in the following solutions of secondary antibodies diluted in Gel-BS: 1. Sections were washed in TBS, and tris-buffer (TB) pH 7.6, and the immunoperoxidase reaction was developed using 3,3-diaminobenzidine as chromogen (DAB, #32750-25G-F, Sigma-Aldrich). After repeated washes in TBS and enhancement conditioning solution (ECS, #500.055, Aurion), gold particles were intensified using the silver enhancement solution (SE-EM, #500.044, Aurion) for 60 minutes at room temperature. After subsequent washes, sections were treated with 0.5 % osmiumtetroxide in PB for 20 minutes. Then sections were dehydrated in ascending ethanol series and acetonitrile, and embedded in epoxy resin (Durcupan, #44610-1EA, Sigma-Aldrich). During dehydration sections were treated with 1% uranylacetate in 70% ethanol for 20 minutes. After polymerization, 70 nm thick sections were cut on a Leica EM UC6 ultramicrotome (Nussloch, Germany), and picked up on formvarcoated single-slot copper grids. The sections were examined using a Hitachi H-7100 electron microscope (Tokyo, Japan) and a side-mounted Veleta CCD camera (Olympus Soft Imaging Solutions).",

The culture media after the acid extraction was centrifuged as described above. The extracted purines were kept at -20 o C until analysis. The adenine nucleotides and adenosine in extracts from cells and culture media were determined by online column switching separation using Discovery HS C18 50 x 2-mm and 150 x2-mm columns. The flow rate of the mobile phases [\"A\" 10 mM potassium phosphate, 0.25 mM EDTA \"B\" with 0.45 mM octane sulphonyl acid sodium salt, 8 % acetonitrile (v/v), 2 % methanol (v/v), pH 5.2] was 350 or 450 \u00b5l/min, respectively in a step gradient application. The enrichment and stripping flow rate of buffer [10 mM potassium phosphate, pH 5.2] was during 4 min and the total runtime was 55 min. The HPLC system used was a Shimadzu LC-20 AD Analytical & Measuring Instruments System, with an Agilent 1100 Series Variable Wavelength Detector set at 253nm. Concentrations were calculated by a two-point calibration curve using internal standard method. The data are expressed as pmol per mg protein or pmol per mL.",

Following three, 10 min washes in PBS, the sections were incubated with biotinylated secondary antibody for 2 h. The staining was performed with Vectastain ABC Elite kit using DAB as the chromogen. After washing thoroughly with distilled water, sections were postfixed in 1% OsO4, dehydrated in ethanol, stained with 1% uranyl acetate in 50% ethanol for 30 min, and embedded in Taab 812. Negative control experiments were performed using the same protocol but substituting pre-immune serum for the primary antibody. Ultrathin sections were cut using a Leica UCT ultramicrotome (Leica Microsystems, Milton Keynes, UK) and examined using a Hitachi 7100 transmission electron microscope (Hitachi; Tokyo, Japan).",
