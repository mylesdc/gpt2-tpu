The corresponding genomic region is of particular interest, as it harbors more disease associations than any other region in the human genome, including associations with infectious diseases, autoimmune disorders, cancers, and neuropsychiatric diseases. Certain MHC molecules can bind to a much wider range of epitopes than others, but the functional implication of such an elevated epitope-binding repertoire has remained largely unclear. It has been suggested that by recognizing more peptide segments, such promiscuous MHC molecules promote immune response against a broader range of pathogens. If so, the geographical distribution of MHC promiscuity level should be shaped by pathogen diversity. Three lines of evidence support the hypothesis. First, we found that in pathogen-rich geographical regions, humans are more likely to carry highly promiscuous MHC class II DRB1 alleles. Second, the switch between specialist and generalist antigen presentation has occurred repeatedly and in a rapid manner during human evolution. Third, molecular positions that define promiscuity level of MHC class II molecules are especially diverse and are under positive selection in human populations. Taken together, our work indicates that pathogen load maintains generalist adaptive immune recognition, with implications for medical genetics and epidemiology.",

Co-evolutionary arms race with pathogens is considered largely responsible for the observed exceptionally high levels of genetic diversity [3] [4] [5] [6] , yet it cannot fully account for the observed geographic differences in human MHC genetic diversity [7, 8] . This indicates that, beyond MHC allelic diversity, other MHC-related factors contribute to the capacity of human populations to withstand pathogens. In this paper, we argue that peptide-binding repertoire size (or, shortly, promiscuity) of MHC alleles is one important factor.",

            "text": "Recent empirical studies demonstrated that there is a substantial variation in the size of the bound and presented antigen repertoire across MHC class I alleles. Certain MHC class I alleles appear to be promiscuous and are capable of binding an exceptionally large set of epitope peptide segments [9, 10] . For example, Paul and colleagues carried out bioinformatics analysis to predict the binding capacity of common HLA-A and HLA-B alleles to a set of 30,000 dengue virus-derived peptides [11] . The analysis revealed over 16-fold variation in the number of peptides bound by the different alleles, indicating significant variation in epitope repertoire size across HLA molecules. The authors selected three alleles for further study in an in vivo transgenic mouse model. Immunization of the corresponding HLA transgenic mouse strains with a set of dengue virus-derived peptides revealed a positive relationship between epitope repertoire size and immunogenicity. Similarly, Kosmrlj and colleagues computed the fraction of self-peptides that bind to various HLA-B molecules, and found that this fraction varies extensively across four HLA-B alleles [12] . The authors then demonstrated that the self-peptidebinding repertoire of HLA-B shapes the native repertoire of T-cell clones developed in the thymus, with implications for recognizing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epitopes. Their results could explain why individuals carrying HLA-B \ufffd 57 alleles can maintain low HIV RNA without therapy. Remarkably, analogous MHC class I alleles with the HLA-B \ufffd 27 superfamily is widespread in Chinese rhesus macaques, animals which show especially slow progression of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)/HIV [13] . Finally, by focusing on seven chicken MHC class I haplotypes and four human HLA-B alleles, Chappel and colleagues demonstrated that MHC class I molecules that can bind a wide range of viral epitopes show lowered expression on the cellular surfaces of immune cells, such as monocytes and lymphocytes [9] . The authors suggested that the breadth of epitope-binding repertoire shapes genetic susceptibility to Marek's disease virus in chickens and HIV disease progression in humans.",

However, it remains to be established whether this relationship generally holds across MHC class I and II alleles and a wide range of infectious diseases.

Second, DRB1 shows the strongest general signature of selection among HLA class II loci [20] , while at the same time showing the weakest evidence for divergent allele advantage, an alternative mechanism at the genotype level for presenting a broader set epitopes [21] . Third, DRB1 has diversified very rapidly in the human lineage [22] . Many of the DRB1 alleles appear to be human specific and most likely evolved after the migration of ancestral human populations out of Africa [22] . These periods have been associated with human populations encountering numerous new pathogens [18, 23] . For other HLA class II loci, the level of genetic diversity is lower [19, 24] , probably driven by selection for functions partly unrelated to pathogens. Notably, HLA-DQ has a fundamental role in the development of immune tolerance [25, 26] , while HLA-DP contributes to the presentation of epitopes of intracellular origins [27] [28] [29] . Fourth, epitope-binding prediction algorithms show higher accuracy for DRB1 than for other HLA class II loci [30, 31] . Finally, the abundance of DRB1 on the cell surface is especially high compared with other HLA class II molecules [32] [33] [34] . Subsequently, we also evaluated promiscuity patterns of HLA class I molecules.",

The set of investigated epitopes was derived from the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) and contains 2,691 peptide epitopes of 71 pathogens known to be bound by certain HLA class II alleles [38] (S1 Data). Epitopes showing high levels of amino acid similarity to each other were excluded from the analysis (See Methods). Most included epitopes are 15 to 20 amino acids long and are found in only one of the 71 pathogens (S1 Fig, S1 Data) . The NetMHCIIpan algorithm was used to predict individual epitope-MHC interactions [30] , not least because it outperforms other prediction algorithms [31] . The breadth of epitope-binding repertoire or, shortly, the level of promiscuity of individual HLA-DRB1 alleles was estimated as the fraction of epitopes with a binding affinity stronger than 50 nM to the given MHC molecule. This threshold corresponds to high-affinity binding, which is frequently observed in MHC molecules displaying immunodominance [39] . We found large variation in promiscuity levels across HLA-DRB1 alleles (S2 Fig, S2 Data) . Using a smaller dataset with information from both approaches, we show that the computationally predicted and the empirically estimated promiscuity values are strongly correlated with each other (Spearman's rho: 0.78, ",

More direct support on the causal relationship between the two variables comes from analysis of prior human genetic studies. To investigate this issue, we focused on two geographically widespread allelic groups with exceptionally high (HLA-DRB1 \ufffd 12) and exceptionally low (HLA-DRB1 \ufffd 03) promiscuity values, respectively, and conducted literature mining on their reported associations with infectious diseases (S3 Table) . As expected, HLA-DRB1 \ufffd 12 was associated with protection against at least five infectious diseases, while HLA-DRB1 \ufffd 03 was associated with susceptibilities to eight infectious diseases, which is highly unlikely by chance (Fisher test, P = 0.003) (S3 Table, S5 Data). The data also indicate local adaptation towards elevated promiscuity under diverse pathogen pressure. The HLA-DRB1 \ufffd 12:02 allele is prevalent in specific regions of Southeast Asia. Compared with other alleles detected in this region, HLA-DRB1 \ufffd 12:02 has a relatively high promiscuity value (top . Indeed, this allele is associated with protection from recurrent pulmonary tuberculosis, recurrent typhoid fever, and hepatosplenic schistomiasis (S5 Data), all of which are endemic diseases in Southeast Asia [44] [45] [46] . Remarkably, the frequency of this allele increases with extracellular pathogen diversity in this region ( Fig 2B) . Together, these observations support the hypothesis that promiscuous epitope binding of HLA-DRB1 alleles is favored by selection when extracellular pathogen diversity is high.",

            "text": "An important unresolved issue is how promiscuity has changed during the course of human evolution. Under the assumption that local pathogen diversity drives the evolution of epitope recognition of HLA class II alleles, promiscuity as a molecular trait should have evolved rapidly as human populations expanded into new territories. To investigate this issue, we combined an established phylogeny of HLA-DRB1 alleles [47] with predicted epitope-binding promiscuity values. We found that alleles with a high promiscuity level have a patchy distribution across the tree (S6 Fig), indicating that high promiscuity has multiple independent origins. To investigate this observation further, we selected a set of 96 HLA-DRB1 alleles with a detectable frequency in at least one human population and appropriate sequence data (see Methods). A comparison of all pairs of these alleles revealed that even very closely related alleles show major differences in promiscuity levels ( Fig 3A) . For example, alleles belonging to the HLA-DRB1 \ufffd 13 group show over 98% amino acid sequence identity to each other, but display as much as 57-fold variation in the predicted promiscuity levels. We conclude that the switch between high and low promiscuity levels has occurred repeatedly and in a rapid manner during the allelic diversification of the HLA-DRB1 locus. We next asked how selection on promiscuity has shaped the genetic diversity along the epitope-binding region of HLA molecules. To quantify protein sequence variability at each amino acid position, we calculated the Shannon entropy index based on the alignment of the 96 selected HLA-DRB1 alleles from above. For each position, we also calculated promiscuity fragility, that is, the median impact of single amino acid substitutions on promiscuity (see Methods). A strong positive correlation was found between Shannon entropy and promiscuity fragility ( The above data suggest a link between allele promiscuity and HLA-DRB1 diversification, probably as an outcome of selection for locally optimized promiscuity levels.",

As a result, there is no correlation between amino acid distance and promiscuity fold difference (Spearman's rho = 0.02, P = 0.19). Amino acid distances were binned as shown on the figure (n = 308, 1,168, 564, 654, 1,492). Violin plots show the density function of promiscuity fold difference values for allele pairs in the given bin. White circles show median values; bold black lines show the interquartile range. (B) Sequence variability of an amino acid site in the epitope-binding region of HLA-DRB1 (measured as Shannon entropy) correlates positively with the site's promiscuity fragility, measured as the median predicted promiscuity fold difference caused by a random amino acid change at the given site (see inset, Spearman's rho: 0.76, P = 0.0001). Sites that have a larger impact on promiscuity are more diverse in human populations. Line in inset represents linear regression between the two variables. The same result was obtained when promiscuity fragility was calculated based on nucleotide substitutions instead of amino acid substitutions (Spearman's rho: 0.73, P = 0.0004, see Methods) or when sequence variability was measured as nonsynonymous nucleotide diversity (\u03c0 A ) instead of sequence entropy (S7 Fig).

By binding short peptide segments (epitopes), MHC molecules guide both immune response against pathogens and tolerance to self-peptides.

It harbors more disease associations than any other regions in the human genome, including associations with infectious diseases, autoimmune disorders, tumors, and neuropsychiatric diseases [52, 53] . A growing body of literature is now revealing that certain MHC class I alleles can bind a wider range of epitopes than others, but the functional implications of this variation remain largely unknown [10] . By recognizing a larger variety of epitopes, such promiscuous MHC alleles promote immune response against a broader range of pathogens at the individual level. Therefore, promiscuous epitope binding of MHC molecules should be favored by selection in geographic regions where extracellular pathogen diversity is high.

This suggest that these alleles are not particularly favored by natural selection in these areas. Why should it be so? First, high promiscuity may not be able to cope with the rise of novel and highly virulent pathogens. In such cases, displaying a particular epitope might be the most efficient way to achieve resistance, and high promiscuity might be suboptimal due to a reduced specificity [9, 10] . Second, high promiscuity level may elevate the risk of immune reactions against host tissues and non-harmful proteins [9, 64] . Clearly, future work should elucidate the evolutionary trade-offs between protection from pathogens and genetic susceptibility to autoimmune diseases. This will require high-throughput experimental methods to determine epitope-binding repertoire [65] , and HLA transgenic mice studies on the role of promiscuity in immune response [66] .",

The experimental studies include HLA-binding assays, T-cell activation assays, and immunopeptidomic studies as well. Epitopes of all available viral, bacterial, and eukaryotic pathogens known to be bound by at least one HLA-I or HLA-II allele were extracted from IEDB. Reference proteomes of pathogenic species that carry at least one of the collected epitope sequences were retrieved from the Uniprot database (102 for HLA-I and 71 for HLA-II epitopes) [71] . Only epitopes of these species were analyzed further. All proteomes were scanned for each epitope sequence, and epitope sequences found in only one proteome (i.e., species-specific epitopes) were kept for further analysis. Highly similar epitope sequences were identified using Clustal Omega [72] and excluded as follows. A protein distance matrix was created and epitopes were discarded iteratively. In each iteration, the epitope pairs with the lowest k-tuple distance were identified. Then, the epitope with the highest average similarity to all other sequences was excluded. Iterations were repeated until distance values less than 0.5 (corresponding to greater than approximately 50% sequence identity) were eliminated from the matrix [73] . Note that this filtering procedure was carried out separately for epitope sequences bound by HLA-I and HLA-II.",

Populations were grouped in an iterative manner. In each iteration, all maximal cliques (i.e., subsets of nodes that are fully connected to each other) in the network were identified. Maximal cliques represent groups of populations in which all populations have similar allele compositions to each other. Then, mean genetic distance within each clique was calculated. The clique with the lowest average distance was selected and its populations were grouped together. Then, this clique was deleted from the network. Iterations were repeated until no maximal cliques remained in the network. Grouping of populations was carried out using different distance value cutoffs (1st, 5th, 10th, and 15th rank percentile of all distance values). The resulting population groups and the individual populations that remained in the network were treated as independent data points in subsequent statistical analyses. Mean promiscuity level in population groups was calculated by averaging population promiscuity values.",

To this end, nucleotide sequences of DRB1 alleles that contained full exon 2 and 3 regions were downloaded from the IPD-IMGT/HLA database [19] . To limit our analyses to alleles that have an impact on the inferred promiscuity level of a population, we considered only those sequences that had a nonzero frequency in at least one human population (see above). From allele groups that code for the same protein sequence (synonymous differences, differentiated by the third set of digits in the HLA nomenclature), one of the alleles was randomly chosen. This selection procedure resulted in 96 alleles. Multiple alignment of nucleotide sequences was performed using the MUSCLE algorithm as implemented in the MEGA software [77] and converted to protein sequence alignments. Amino acid distance was calculated using the Jones-Taylor-Thornton substitution model in MEGA [77] (Fig 3A) . Epitope-binding region sites-as defined previously [30]-were excluded when calculating amino acid distance. The rationale behind this exclusion is that these sites are known to be under positive selection [78, 79] and are therefore less informative on evolutionary distance. Additionally, by removing these sites, the amino acid distance remains independent of promiscuity predictions. Finally, as intragenic recombination may distort the inference of evolutionary distance, we identified such events across all alleles following the protocol of Satta and colleagues [80] using GENE-CONV [81] and RDP algorithms [82] as implemented in the RDP software [83] . Recombinant alleles were removed when calculating amino acid distance.",

IEDB, Immune Epitope Database. (TIF) S4 Fig. Predicted promiscuity levels are robust to changes in binding threshold, prediction algorithm, and epitope set. The computational prediction of epitope-binding promiscuity was carried out using different binding thresholds: 50 nM for strong binding, which results in the selection of immunodominant peptides [39], and 500 nM and 1,000 nM thresholds, which minimize the number of false negative hits [90]. (A-C) The proportion of 2,691 epitopes bound by HLA-DRB1 alleles showed strong correlation between (A) 50 nM and 500 nM, (B) 50 nM and 1,000 nM, and (C) 500 nM and 1,000 nM binding thresholds (Spearman's rho: 0.95, 0.91, and 0.99 respectively, P < 2 \u00d7 10 \u221216 for all analyses). (D) To further ensure the robustness of the predicted promiscuity values, we repeated the predictions using an alternative algorithm, MHC2SKPan as implemented by the MHC2SKPan server [91] (again, promiscuity was calculated using a 50 nM binding threshold). Promiscuity values calculated based on the two algorithms showed a strong correlation (Spearman's rho: 0.92, P < 2 \u00d7 10 \u221216 ). (E) The proportion of epitopes bound by HLA-DRB1 molecules was independent of the exact epitope set used for the calculations. Specifically, predictions were carried out using epitopes of only extracellular or only intracellular pathogens, and strong correlation was found between binding promiscuity of intracellular and extracellular epitopes (Spearman's rho: 0.99, P < 2 \u00d7 10 \u221216 ).

The number of recognized pathogen species (i.e., those with at least one epitope computationally predicted to be bound by the HLA molecule) is plotted against the computationally predicted promiscuity of the HLA-DRB1 allele. The two variables are strongly correlated (Spearman's rho: 0.99, P < 2 \u00d7 10 \u221216 ). Red curve indicates smooth curve fitted using cubic smoothing spline method in R (see Methods).

Phylogeny of DRB1 alleles from Yasukochi and colleagues [47], with predicted epitope-binding promiscuity shown color coded. Alleles were sorted into five equally sized bins according to their promiscuity values. High promiscuity alleles (dark red) are scattered on the tree, suggesting multiple independent origins. Bootstrap percentage values greater than 80% are shown on the internal nodes. The underlying data for this figure can be found in S4 Data. (TIF) S7 Fig. Amino acid positions in the epitope-binding region of HLA-DRB1 that have a larger impact on promiscuity are more diverse in human populations. Average nonsynonymous nucleotide diversity of an amino acid site in the epitope-binding region (measured as \u03c0 A , see Methods) correlates positively with the site's promiscuity fragility, measured as the median predicted promiscuity fold difference caused by a random amino acid change at the given site (Spearman's rho = 0.59, P = 0.0075). \u03c0 A values were calculated for each human population using data on allele frequencies (see Methods). Points represent the average \u03c0 A values of an amino acid site across all populations. Error bars show standard error. The underlying data for this figure can be found in S4 Data.
