Because the pace of sequence accumulation tends to exceed the pace of experimental studies of protein function and the roles of individual amino acids, statistical tools to identify meaningful patterns in protein diversity are essential. Large sequence alignments from fast-evolving micro-organisms are particularly challenging to dissect using standard tools from phylogenetics and multivariate statistics because biologically relevant functional signals are easily masked by neutral variation and noise. To meet this need, a novel computational method is introduced that is easily executed in parallel using a cluster environment and can handle thousands of sequences with minimal subjective input from the user. The usefulness of this kind of machine learning is demonstrated by applying it to nearly 5000 haemagglutinin sequences of influenza A/H3N2.Antigenic and 3D structural mapping of the results show that the method can recover the major jumps in antigenic phenotype that occurred between 1968 and 2013 and identify specific amino acids associated with these changes. The method is expected to provide a useful tool to uncover patterns of protein evolution.",

However, the use of such unfocused methods for extracting information is problematic when the biologically relevant signals are masked by noise introduced due to sequencing errors or functionally neutral variation.

For microbial proteins one important question is which isolates or strains constitute phenotypically distinct groups, distinguished by specific amino acids fixed by selection. It is also useful to know which positions and amino acids are probably directly under selection. Statistically, these questions correspond to the task of simultaneously clustering a protein sequence alignment in two ways, by the rows to identify the relevant groups of strains and by the columns to identify which amino acid positions define the clusters. As both the number of groups and the relevant sequence positions are often unknown, statistical inference is required. Bayesian modelling is particularly well suited for such model selection problems, as by specifying probabilistic prior information for the unknowns in the model, one can efficiently focus the search and avoid overfitting.",

Our approach is based on a twoway clustering model inspired by an earlier method (K-Pax) for clustering single protein sequence alignments from distant homologues to identify substructure within a protein superfamily (Marttinen et al., 2006) . Our current method possesses two significant improvements over the original K-Pax, one related to accuracy and the other to the technical specifications of the priors and model. These changes permit the method to be used to study a large number of closely related sequences as well as several proteins simultaneously. A useful feature of our model definition is that it enables an analytically obtainable Bayesian score of model fitness. This feature permits the use of parallel computation in model optimization, as the scores are directly comparable from independent optimization runs without approximation errors caused by, for example, Monte Carlo methods.",

This paper introduces the first fast modelbased machine learning method targeted to identify genomic positions that are likely to display nonsynonymous variation due to selection pressure. The method is widely applicable to aid in generation of hypotheses for experimental work and to pinpoint plausible candidates for further study and data acquisition. Results on influenza A/H3N2 highlight the potential to significantly advance the process towards understanding the mechanisms linked to the success of major pathogens.",

For the purpose of obtaining a model family and an inference algorithm that can efficiently capture signals of diversifying and directional selection from S, we transform the multiple sequence alignment into an n \u00a3 LjAj binary matrix, where each column corresponds to an indicator variable of a particular element in A being observed at position l.

For a discrete posterior distribution over a space of such high cardinality and complex topology, it is unlikely that any standard Markov chain Monte Carlo approach would be able to efficiently explore the distribution and estimate the mode using a reasonable amount of computational time. Therefore, we have developed a greedy optimization algorithm for fitting the model to a multiple sequence alignment. An advantage of the analytical tractability of the model is that any two model structures can be compared using the difference in log posterior, and hence estimates from multiple independent parallel or sequential algorithm runs can be ranked in a straightforward manner. Similarly, posterior uncertainty around the mode estimate can be easily numerically summarized, for example using Bayes factors against neighbouring model configurations.",

The value for k was chosen according to the highest posterior probability score. This procedure generated initial partitions lying in a neighbourhood of the optimal solution and allowed the algorithm to converge in less than 6 h (2.6 GHz processor with 2 GB RAM). The optimal model allocated the 4898 sequences into 57 different groups while simultaneously detecting 117 (out of 567 possible) cluster-defining sites. As a comparison, the adjusted Rand index between our solution and the kmedoids partition with the same number of clusters is 0.824. The two partitions are very similar and their discrepancy is completely explained by a small rearrangement of the units. This result can be interpreted by noting that Kpax2 gives different weights to matrix columns, whereas standard clustering techniques do not make any distinction between noise and signal sites.",

Both measures agreed. The tree in Fig. 3 was reconstructed by choosing, for each group, the ancestor associated with the minimum distance. The core clusters can be interpreted as the backbone clades of the A/H3N2 HA phylogeny, connecting the viruses observed in 1968 to the most recent ones. The classical ladder shape of the phylogenetic tree is conserved when only one consensus sequence per core cluster is used (Fig. 4) . These cluster transitions closely resemble those reported by Smith et al. (2004) based on a carefully curated set of sequences, which represents less than 10 % of the data analysed here. The evolutionary relationships among all the 57 clusters are shown in Fig. S1 . Figure 5 shows how the characteristic sites of the core clusters have evolved over time. This reflects the dominant role of the B-cell epitopes in contrast to T-cell epitopes (Suzuki, 2006) . To quantify the distribution of these changes over time, we calculated unadjusted estimates of mutation A. Pessia and others rates in each epitope and elsewhere in HA1 (Table 1) . Antigenic drift is thought to occur when an average of four amino acid changes accumulates over time (Koel et al., 2013) . Many of the cluster transitions in Fig. 5 agree with this definition, but some carry fewer substitutions, which illustrates the usefulness of more flexible, statistical Rates have been estimated as y=\u00f0lt\u00de, where y is the total number of amino acid changes, l is the length of the region and t is the time difference in years between two clusters.

The most comprehensive transition occurs in the 1996 group where changes occurred in all five epitopes, shown as a pronounced jump in antigenic space (Fig. 6) . Interestingly, sequential changes in core characteristic sites rarely occur in close proximity, even when within the same epitope. This raises the possibility that selection tends to favour alternation across the protein surface, even within a single domain.
