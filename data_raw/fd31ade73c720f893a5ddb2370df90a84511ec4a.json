            "text": "Swine influenza virus (SIV) is the cause of an acute respiratory disease that affects swine worldwide. SIV infection is characterized by fever, inactivity, decreased food intake, respiratory distress, coughing, sneezing, conjunctivitis, and nasal discharge. 1, 2 Disease severity is affected by many factors, including the viral strain, but typically, the onset of disease is sudden. The incubation period is between 1 and 3 days, with rapid recovery beginning 4-7 days after onset. The disease is characterized by high morbidity and generally low mortality rates. 3 Influenza A viruses are members of the Orthomyxoviridae family and are 80-120 nm enveloped viruses with segmented, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA genomes. 3 The segmented genome of influenza virus allows reassortment between different viruses, and once cells are infected with two or more different influenza viruses, the exchange of RNA segments between the viruses allows the generation of progeny containing a novel combination of genes. 3 The viral surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) are the main targets of the host immune response, and they are important for host specificity and virulence. 4 HA binds to the cell receptor N-acetylneuraminic acid-2,3-galactose linkage or to the N-acetylneuraminic acid-2,6-galactose linkage on sialyloligosaccharides of avian and mammalian viruses, respectively. 5 Swine have been considered to be a potential 'mixing vessel' because they have receptors for both avian and human influenza viruses. 6 In 2009, a new influenza virus emerged in the human population of North America. Pandemic H1N1 (H1N1pdm09), which has a unique genome with six gene segments (PB1, PB2, PA, HA, NP, and NS) from the triple reassortant swine lineage of the North American virus and the M and NA gene derived from the Eurasian lineage of the swine influenza virus, 7 had never before been recognized in swine. Immediately after the spread of H1N1pdm09 in human populations, outbreaks in pigs were reported in many countries worldwide. 8 Brazil is the fifth leading global pork producer and the fourth largest pork exporter, and swine production is economically important. However, few studies have investigated the presence of SIV antibodies or virus isolates in Brazilian pigs. In Brazil, SIV was first isolated in 1978 in a pig from Minas Gerais state. 9 One study reported a low prevalence of antibodies against H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes in pigs from 10 Brazilian states between 1996 and 1999. 10 Further studies demonstrated the prevalence of anti-influenza antibodies against human 11 and swine viruses 12 in southeastern Brazil. In a seroprevalence study in Paran a (southern Brazil), the authors reported that 46% of the sampled farms were positive for anti-H3N2 antibodies, and the prevalence of antibodies against human H3N2 in those pigs was 20%. 13 After the H1N1pdm09 outbreak, few studies reported the presence of influenza virus in Brazilian herds. 14, 15 However, no data are available concerning the prevalence of antibodies against swine influenza virus in Brazilian herds after 2009. In Brazil, a vaccine protecting swine against influenza virus was licensed on May 2014. Prior to that vaccine, the presence of anti-influenza antibodies in pigs was attributed to natural infection. Recently, there were many reports regarding respiratory outbreaks in farms around the country 16 and producers and veterinarians began vaccinating against swine influenza to reduce economic losses.",

Thirty farms (F1 to F30) from the four larger pig production areas in Minas Gerais state (Zona da Mata, Tri\u00e2ngulo Mineiro/Alto Parana \u0131ba, South/Southwest and the Belo Horizonte metropolitan area) were selected for this study ( Figure 1 ); these farms represented approximately 2\u00c14% of all herds in the state. All sampled farms were registered with the agency responsible for the state health surveillance. The number of farms was calculated based on the premise that each repetition has a maximum weight of 3\u00c133% in the sample, 17 and the response was expressed as a percentage. At each farm, blood samples were randomly collected from 20 animals in each production cycle category: breeding animals (sows and gilts), farrowing crate (2-3 weeks), nursery (4-7 weeks), grower pigs (8-14 weeks), and finisher pigs (15-16 weeks) . In total, there were 100 samples per farm and 3000 animals in the study. All farms were farrow-to-finishing operations, with no SIV vaccination history, and most farms utilized allin-all-out production systems. The farms had between 160 and 1950 sows, and three farms had experienced respiratory disease outbreaks with swine influenza diagnostic confirmed between 3 and 6 months prior to the sample collection. This study was conducted under the approval of the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais ethics committee. All herd owners provided consent for the use of the sera.",

The detection of anti-influenza antibodies in most of the farms suggests virus circulation, once Brazil had no approved vaccination program against influenza while this experiment was being performed.

The rates of animals with anti-influenza antibodies found in this study were lower than those previously reported for many countries. One study reported that 66\u00c13% of the animals at swine farms in the United States had antibodies against subtype H1; a lower rate (33\u00c17%) was detected for antibodies against the H3 subtype. 19 Another study investigating the seroprevalence of antibodies against H1N1, H3N2, and H1N2 in sows from European herds detected seroprevalence rates that were >50% for H1N1 and H3N2 in Belgium (80\u00c18% and 53\u00c18%, respectively) and in Germany (70\u00c18% and 58\u00c16%, respectively).

Using a H3N2 from different country might be one factor to explain the low prevalence for antibodies against H3N2 in our study. Despite of that, due the cross-protection, our results could be useful to show H3N2 general circulation in Brazil.",

Moreover, the timing of influenza infection may vary based on the type of production system. 21 A study comparing the timing of infection in finisher pigs in nonvaccinated farrow-to-finish herds and specialized finishing herds showed that infection was highest at the beginning of the finishing period in farrow-to-finish herds, while in finishing herds, the incidence of influenza infections was highest in the end of the same period. 21 Differences in the time of influenza infection occurrence may require different preventive measures, and because passive antibodies may interfere in the immune response to vaccination or infection, vaccination strategies must be analyzed to improve protection against influenza infection. Based on our results, it is not possible to suggest a single vaccination program against influenza virus because susceptible animals were generally detected in all categories of the production system. Thus, some strategies, such as female-only vaccination or female vaccination followed by vaccination of pigs at 7-8 weeks, could be helpful, depending on the immunity of the herd.",

According to our results, the percentage of seronegative pigs for H1N1pdm09 virus increased with age, and the highest values were observed in nursery and grower pigs. Overall, influenza virus circulates in the herds and may cause disease in susceptible pigs 21 regardless of age. The presence of seronegative animals in the nursery and grower phases (after reported outbreaks in these ages) suggests that influenza virus was circulating in the farms but that during the sampling, the virus was not circulating in the nursery and grower pig categories.",

The serological profiles differed for both viruses and among geographical areas, suggesting a high variety of viral circulation across the state and resulting in seronegative animals that were susceptible to influenza infection and respiratory disease outbreaks. Little information is available regarding the influenza subtypes circulating in swine in the country, and because the lack of cross-protection between different subtypes is one of the obstacles preventing the development of efficacious vaccines and prevention of influenza infection in swine, more studies are needed to improve the knowledge of viral circulation and to determine the best strategies for preventing economic losses related to influenza virus infection in Brazil. Studies involving serological surveillance for the influenza virus in other regions in Brazil, detection of endemic viruses circulating in swine herds and monitoring the genetic evolution of these samples by sequencing could be useful to provide information about molecular epidemiology of SIV and provide data for vaccine production and control of influenza virus in Brazil.",
