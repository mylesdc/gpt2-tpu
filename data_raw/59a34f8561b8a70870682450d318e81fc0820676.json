Mouse studies demonstrated safety, immunogenicity, and protective efficacy of these live or inactivated RABV/EBOV vaccines. Here, we evaluated these vaccines in nonhuman primates. Our results indicate that all three vaccines do induce potent immune responses against both RABV and EBOV, while the protection of immunized animals against EBOV was largely dependent on the quality of humoral immune response against EBOV GP. We also determined if the induced antibodies against EBOV GP differ in their target, affinity, or the isotype. Our results show that IgG1-biased humoral responses as well as high levels of GP-specific antibodies were beneficial for the control of EBOV infection after immunization. These results further support the concept that a successful EBOV vaccine needs to induce strong antibodies against EBOV. We also showed that a dual vaccine against RABV and filoviruses is achievable; therefore addressing concerns for the marketability of this urgently needed vaccine.",

While the public health burden of filovirus infections remains low relative to other public health threats in Africa, outbreaks continue to affect the Central African region including recent outbreaks in Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2012. The high case fatality rate, the increasing public health threat in Africa, and the biodefense concerns associated with these viruses have resulted in considerable activity in filovirus vaccine development [2, 3] . Several vaccination strategies, including DNA, adenovirus, recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV), virus-like particles (VLPs) and recombinant parainfluenza virus vectored vaccines, have been developed to deliver primarily the EBOV glycoprotein (GP) as antigen and have been shown to confer protection in animal models [2, [4] [5] [6] [7] . While each vaccine strategy has shown promising results and is protective in macaques, concerns such as vaccine safety, preexisting vector immunity, manufacturing, or lack of commercial interest have slowed progress.",

The majority of evidence suggests that IgG antibody levels are important for protection in immunized macaques (adenovirus or rVSV-vectored EBOV GP) although the contribution of neutralizing antibodies to protection is unclear [8, 9] . Further support for the potential contribution of antibodies to protection was recently provided by two studies demonstrating that passive transfer of purified IgG from NHP survivor sera or neutralizing monoclonal antibody cocktails could confer protection from Ebola or Marburg virus infections [10, 11] . In addition Marzi et. al. showed that the rVSV mechanism of protection for EBOV is mediated by antibodies [12] .",

Using T cell depletion experiments, Sullivan et al. recently concluded that EBOV-specific CD8 + T cells and not humoral immunity mediated protection from EBOV infection upon adenovirus/EBOV-GP immunization [13] . Collectively, these studies suggest that immune parameters that correlate with and/or confer protection may be multi-factorial and vary by vaccination platform. However, we also need to consider that there are likely different requirements for the induction of anti-EBOV immunity and the recall response after exposure to the pathogen. It is not likely that long-lived immunity can be achieved without T-helper cells. In the case of GP-specific antibodies it needs to be shown that they are maintained over time or CD4 + T helper cells will be required to mount fast responses after infection.",

Furthermore, EBOV vaccines could be utilized in endangered wildlife species such as gorillas and chimpanzees in Central Africa where they are at risk of lethal EBOV disease. Epidemiologic studies have indicated that EBOV outbreaks have resulted in numerous deaths of these animals in Gabon and the Democratic Republic of Congo, hindering conservation efforts to protect these populations [14] [15] [16] . A vaccine to protect these at risk NHPs would have a second critical benefit to humans. As EBOV is a zoonotic disease with documented human outbreaks, which can arise from contact with diseased NHPs [17] , prevention of disease in these animals might reduce the frequency of EBOV transmission into humans resulting in reduced frequency of outbreaks.",

To this end, we have utilized the rabies virus (RABV) vaccine platform to develop (a) replication-competent, (b) replication-deficient, and (c) chemically inactivated vaccines expressing EBOV GP (strain Mayinga) [18] . As RABV is still a considerable public health issue in Africa with an estimated 24,000 deaths reported yearly [19] [20] [21] , a bivalent vaccine that confers protection from RABV and EBOV would be an economical and efficient public health tool. The RABV vaccine platform has proven to be an excellent vaccine vector for safe induction of immunity to HIV, SARS-CoV, and hepatitis C virus [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . Further attenuated RABV-vectored vaccines have been generated by the deletion of the RABV glycoprotein (G) gene and propagation of viruses on trans-complementing cell lines that express RABV G [25, 27, 28] . Additionally, beta-propiolactonemediated inactivation of RABV-vectored vaccines has been used to generate killed vaccine candidates against hepatitis C virus and bacillus anthracis with optimal safety profiles [22, 29] . Our primary focus is the development of an inactivated vaccine for use in humans based on the potential for superior safety and the successful history of the existing beta propiolactone-inactivated RABV vaccine that is widely used in humans. However, in addition to the development of inactivated RABV/EBOV vaccines, the parental recombinant RABV vaccine used to generate the RABV/EBOV vaccine candidates is derived from the SAD B19 strain which is used for wildlife vaccination by baiting in Europe suggesting additional applications of our vaccine candidates [30, 31] . Therefore, live attenuated RABV/EBOV vaccines could be considered for use in Africa in an analogous campaign to protect at risk NHPs from lethal EBOV infections.",

We followed the immune response of the vaccinated animals over time after vaccination as well as after challenge ( Figure 1B) . Notably, the goal of this novel vaccine approach was to develop a vaccine that protects from two different highly lethal diseases, rabies and filovirus induced hemorrhagic fever. Therefore, we followed both RABV and EBOV GP-specific immune responses. As shown in Figure 2A , all three vaccines and the empty control vector induced seroconversion against RABV G as early as day 7 after immunization, with increasing IgG levels at day 14 and slightly decreasing levels for the sera collected at day 28. In contrast, at day 7, EBOV GP-specific humoral responses were only detected in sera from animals vaccinated with the replication-deficient vaccine ( Figure 2B ). On day 14, all groups (groups 2-4) showed a positive signal in the EBOV GP-specific ELISA whereas for the control animals (group 1) only background signals were detected ( Figure 2B ). Interestingly, the replicationdeficient (RABV G-deleted) vector expressing EBOV GP induced the highest EBOV GP-specific responses but the lowest RABV G responses. This is most likely due to the fact that this virus does not encode RABV G and the RABV G-specific immune response results from the G protein contained in the initial vaccine particle preparation [27] .

The increased frequency of EBOV outbreaks along with its potential to be used as a bioterrorism agent has dramatically strengthened filovirus vaccine research and development. While there are currently no approved vaccines or post exposure treatments available for human use, several vaccine candidates have shown to protect nonhuman primates from lethal EBOV challenge. Our primary focus is to develop vaccine candidates to protect humans and endangered wildlife species at risk of infection in Africa. Here, we evaluated the efficacy and immunogenicity of our dual vaccines against EBOV and rabies virus (RABV) in rhesus macaques. Our live replication-competent vaccine provided 100% protection following EBOV challenge while the replication-deficient and inactivated candidates provided 50% protection. Interestingly, protection is dependent on the quality of the antibodies rather than the quantity. All three RABV-based EBOV vaccines did induce antibody levels necessary for protection from RABV infection. These results encourage the further development of these novel dual vaccines directed against two of the most lethal viral diseases.",

Notably, the VNA titers were well above the critical level of 0.5 international units (I.U.), which is considered protective from RABV infection in humans [33] . Similar to the total IgG levels against RABV G, we detected an increase of the RABV-specific immune responses by VNA for all vaccine groups. In contrast to RABV, we were unable to detect significant levels of virus-neutralizing antibodies directed against EBOV for groups 2-4 compared to the controls of group 1 (data not shown). We also analyzed the cellular responses utilizing an IFN-c specific ELI-SPOT from larger blood samples collected at day 14 and 42. As shown in Table 1 , animals of the control group did not mount any cellular responses when stimulated with EBOV GP-specific peptide pools. The highest responses were detected for animals immunized with the replication-competent vaccine, followed by the replication-deficient and the killed viral particles at day 14.

NHP1 and NHP2 rapidly developed disease and reached the hemorrhagic state (rash) on day 6 and 7 post challenge, respectively, at which point animals had to be euthanized according to approved protocol. Based on this finding, we infected the remaining 13 animals on day 70 with the same challenge virus stock and dose. For each challenge experiment, physical exams and blood draws were performed at day 0, 3, 6, 12, 16, 22, and 28 post-challenge. The outcome of the EBOV challenge and the clinical findings are presented in Figure 3 . As show in Figure 3A , all animals immunized with the live replication-competent vaccine, BNSP333-GP (group 2), survived the challenge. As expected, all animals in the control group (NHP 1-3) had to be humanely euthanized according to approved protocol mainly based on high viremia at day 6 ( Figure 3C ) and rash. Two of four animals from group 3, which were immunized with the replication-deficient vaccine (NHP8 and NHP9), and two of four animals from group 4, which received the inactivated RABV/EBOV particles (NHP14 and NHP15), had to be euthanized. The viral loads detected in the blood of these animals (NHP8, NHP9, NHP14 and NHP15) did not differ from those of the three control animals NHP1-3 ( Figure 3C ). Interestingly, five out of the twelve animals (NHP4, NHP5, NHP6, NHP11 and NHP12) controlled challenge virus replication with undetectable viremia, whereas for three animals (NHP7, NHP10 and NHP13) the challenge virus was detected transiently at one (group 2 and 3) or two time points (group 4) ( Figure 3C ). The lack of protection was also reflected clinically ( Figure 3B , D-F). Animal body temperature, on average, increased within the first few days after challenge but returned to the original temperatures near day 12 post challenge ( Figure 3B ). Platelet count significantly decreased after challenge for the unprotected animals whereas protected animals regained normal platelet levels by day 12 post challenge ( Figure 3D ). Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ( Figure 3E ) and serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels ( Figure 3F ) monitored liver function. Elevated levels, as seen by days 3-6, indicated liver damage as a result of EBOV infection.",

As shown in Figure 4 , the three animals of the control group failed to mount any EBOV GP-specific responses during the course of the EBOV infection. In contrast, all three groups of vaccinated NHPs (groups 2, 3 and 4) had similar levels of anti-EBOV GP antibodies at the day of challenge ( Figure 4A , challenge day 0). The EBOV GP-specific antibodies remained at these levels 3 days after challenge ( Figure 4B, challenge day 3) . Interestingly, a rapid increase to high levels of EBOV GP-specific IgG was observed on day 6 after challenge in the serum of the five animals that survived (NHP4, NHP5, NHP6, NHP11, and NHP12). Notably, these high antibody levels were detected in those animals that did not have detectable levels of EBOV RNA in their blood during the course of challenge. The three animals (NHP7, NHP10, and NHP13), which did show a lower but significant increase in EBOV GP-specific antibodies 6 days after challenge, demonstrated transient levels of EBOV viremia but survived ( figure 3C ). Lastly, we failed to detect an increase in the humoral responses against EBOV GP in the serum of four animals on day 6 post challenge (NHP8, NHP9, NHP14, and NHP15). These were the animals that had to be humanely euthanized. Based on these results, we concluded that one requirement for a successful RABVbased EBOV vaccine is the rapid recall response of humoral immunity against EBOV GP after EBOV challenge. The results presented above also indicate that virus specific antibodies are important to control EBOV infection. However, the antibody titers against EBOV GP at the day of challenge were similar for all three groups and, more importantly, the same within groups 3 and 4 where two animals in each group were protected while the other two were not. Therefore, we decided to analyze the humoral immune responses in greater detail.",

Th1 dependent IgG1 antibodies in NHPs have been shown to possess better antiviral properties by mediating antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and complement activation [35] . Therefore, we performed an isotype-specific ELISA utilizing full-length EBOV GP to determine if any differences in the antibody isotypes occurred between the vaccines. As shown in Figure 6 , the positive control NHP ratio of IgG2/IgG1 on day 0 post-challenge was around 1.0, whereas this ratio was an average of about 2.0 for all the vaccinated animals from groups 2-4. However, six days after challenge this IgG2/IgG1 ratio changed to ,1.0 for the sera collected for the animals from group 2, which is the group where all four animals survived. In contrast, the average of the IgG2/ IgG1 ratio for group 3 was 2.0 and for group 4 was 1.5. In both of these groups two animals were not protected. These data suggest that IgG1-biased humoral responses might be beneficial for the control of EBOV infection. This contention was further supported by the analysis of the individual animals in groups 2 and 4. As shown in Figures 3 and 6 , NHP7 (group 2) had detectable EBOV RNA in the blood on day 6 and also had the highest IgG2/IgG1 ratio of 1.6. The same is true for group 4 where both protected animals had an IgG2/IgG1 ratio below 1.0, whereas the unprotected animals were above 2.0. The only exception from this observation is one protected animal in group 3 (NHP10), which had a clear bias towards an IgG2 response indicated by an IgG2/IgG1 of almost 3.0. However, this animal had a very low antibody response even on day 6 after challenge ( Figure 4) . Lastly, the final outcome at four weeks after challenge was similar for all surviving animals with an IgG1-biased response and an IgG2/ IgG1 ratio of about 0.8 (similar to the positive control). In general, this novel finding strongly indicates that an IgG1-biased immune response against EBOV GP is advantageous for protection and should be further evaluated with larger animal numbers and for other vaccine approaches.",

Secondly, and even more interestingly, challenge with EBOV does increase the avidity of the antibodies directed to EBOV GP (see Figure 7 , challenge (B) Isotype ratios for protected animals versus unprotected animals after EBOV challenge. The isotype ratios of the protected animals were not statistically significant when compared to the ratios of the unprotected animals. When analyzing the isotype ratios of group 2 and group 4 protected animals to the unprotected animals in group 4, there is a significant difference (***, p,0.001). Statistical analysis was performed using unpaired t-test with Welch's correction to compare two groups. Results shown are presented as the mean. *p,0.05, **p,0.01, ***p,0.001. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1003389.g006 day 0 and post challenge day 3). In order to investigate if this is an antigen-specific effect, we analyzed the avidity of the RABV Gspecific antibodies and observed a similar increase in avidity of the RABV G-specific antibodies compared to EBOV GP-specific antibodies, which was also confirmed by VNA (supplemental Figure S1 ). The VNA showed a significant increase in the surviving animals of about 3 to 4-fold. Even though we can only speculate about the mechanism of protection, there is a clear increase of the immune response even against an antigen (e.g. RABV G) not expressed during the challenge virus infection.",

This finding is not too surprising because acute viral infections are often controlled by antibodies rather than cytotoxic T-cells, which in general are more important for the control of chronic infections [38] . However, previous research did suggest CD8 + T-cells as the major player for protection from EBOV infection in a single vaccination strategy [13] . This has been challenged by recent studies indicating that, in general, protection of NHPs by different EBOV vaccines seems to depend on the presence of anti-EBOV GP antibodies as well as EBOV GP-specific CD4 + T-helper cells [9, 12] . Moreover, it cannot be excluded that CD8 + T-cells play a role in viral clearance but no CD8 + memory T-cells are needed. Lastly, the relatively high background in our ELISPOT assay might have prevented us to detect low cellular responses. In any case, our results indicated a major role of EBOV GP-specific antibodies to control the challenge virus replication, and we therefore focused on these responses in greater detail. In this regard, the finding that only 50% of NHPs in groups 3 and 4 were protected was an advantage, because all three groups of vaccinated NHPs did have similar levels of anti-EBOV GP antibodies as analyzed using an EBOV GP-specific ELISA. This suggested a qualitative difference in the humoral responses for the three vaccines.",

These findings indicate that antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) might play a major role in protection from EBOV infection. Because ADCC depends on IgG1 antibody responses, we analyzed the total IgG response and also the IgG subtype responses (e.g. IgG1 and IgG2). Our results indicated that all protected animals, independent of the group, had an IgG2/IgG1 ratio of ,0.8 whereas the unprotected animals had a higher ratio of ,2.5. Interestingly, two animals from group 3 and group 4, NHP10 and NHP13, transiently had the highest viral loads and also had IgG2/ IgG1 ratios that fell between those of unprotected and protected animals. These results clearly indicate that the quality of the antibodies in regard to the isotypes is very important for a successful EBOV vaccine based on EBOV GP. However, the protected animals from group 2 and 4 had also the highest total antibody levels and therefore we conclude that in the case of a rabies-based EBOV vaccine, high level of GP-specific antibodies that are IgG1-bias are very likely to be significant as shown for groups 2 and 4 in Figure 6B .",

In the case of replication-competent RABV vectors expressing EBOV GP, no further improvements are necessary and such a vector could be used to protect NHPs from EBOV in the endemic setting. Of note, it would be best to establish efficacy via an oral application, which is already well established for live RABV in wildlife [30, 31] . The replication-deficient and the inactivated RABV particles did not protect all animals; therefore, the responses induced by these vaccines need to be improved to resemble the responses detected for the replication-competent vaccine, BNSP333-GP, which did protect 100% of the animals. In any case, for the replicationdeficient vector, the virus could be concentrated so higher titers such as the once used for the replication competent vaccine can be used for the immunization. We cannot exclude the possibility that using a five-fold lower titer for the immunizations than was used for BNSP333-GP was responsible for this difference in protection.",

In the case of the inactivated virions containing EBOV GP, a new construct containing an exact fusion of the RABV G cytoplasmic domain to EBOV GP increased the incorporation level about two-fold (the previous construct contained two foreign amino acids between the EBOV GP transmembrane domain and the RABV G cytoplasmic domain) and showed better responses than the current construct in mice (Willet and Schnell, unpublished data). Moreover, we discovered that the glycosylation pattern of EBOV GP was different for RABV particles grown on BSR cells than particles grown on VERO cells (data not shown). Therefore, we believe that the utilization of particles containing higher levels of EBOV GP and perhaps an additional immunization dose would bring the protection rate to 100% of the animals, a reachable goal for a safe and promising dual vaccine.",

Plates were incubated overnight at 4uC, washed three times with PBST, and incubated for 2 hours with 100 uL/well of goat anti-human IgG-HRP. Plates were washed with PBST and developed with 200 uL/ well of SigmaFast o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (OPD) substrate. After incubating for 5 minutes at room temperature, the reaction was stopped with 50 uL of 3 M H 2 SO 4 and the absorbance was read at 490 nm. IgG subclass specific ELISAs were performed for EBOV GP and RABV G with anti-human (Abcam) and anti-rhesus (NIH NHP Reagent Source) antibodies. Plates were incubated with OPD substrate for 8-13 minutes before stopping the reaction with 3 M H 2 SO 4 .",

The avidity assays were set up similar to the ELISA protocol described above however the sera samples were diluted to the concentration that would yield an OD reading of 0.8 nm. Prior to incubation with the secondary antibody, the plates were treated with increasing concentrations of NaSCN in PBS (0 M, 1 M, 2 M, 3 M, 4 M, 5 M, 6 M) for 15 minutes at room temperature. Wells receiving 0 M NaSCN were incubated with PBS. The plates were immediately washed three times with PBST (0.025% Tween in PBS) before continuing with the ELISA protocol. All avidity assays were performed in triplicate.",
