During the period of 2002 -2003, the SARS virus spread slowly in the early stage (Nov. 24, 2002 -Jan. 30, 2003 . The spread accelerated quickly in the middle stage (February of 2003) and continued through the late stage for several more months. This speed-up is associated with changes in the viral DNA sequences. In particular, the S protein accrued five amino acid mutations in quick succession in the early phase. In short, the SARS virus underwent several rounds of genetic adaptation after making the leap from the civet cats to humans.",

As of February 10, 2020, there are 55 genomes of 2019-nCoVs available. The 31 sequences obtained before Jan. 22 are almost entirely from within China (with one exception from USA). Curiously, after Jan. 22, the representation flips completely, with all 24 sequences reported from outside China, including Japan, Korea, Singapore, Australia, USA, France, England, and others. Such partitions will make data interpretation difficult as the influences of time and geography cannot be dis-entangled. This trend in data reporting (or acquisition) is troubling.",

The key question is \"Are 2019-nCovs evolving adaptively in human populations?\" If the answer is no, then we should have already known much about 2019-nCoVs. It would be a small comfort if these viruses are not changing rapidly. At least in the period between December 2019 and early February 2020, this seemed to be the case. Among the 55 genomes analyzed, only 8 amino acid (AA) mutations can be found in at least two samples. Most important, the distribution of these mutations (in technical terms, frequency spectrum) is nearly the same as that of \"silent\" mutations, which generally have little functional effects. This modest degree of evolution is in sharp contrast with the SARS virus at the stage of widespread infection.",

These viruses could have \"cut their teeth\" as a lowly contagious virus between the secondary host and humans, becoming gradually adapted to humans in the process. The recent outbreak may have happened after the last step was taken. If pangolins are indeed the secondary host, as has been reported, then the small differences between the viruses in pangolins and humans might be this last step. The low evolutionary rate, the high contagious rate and the modest virulence all seem to suggest 2019-nCoVs to be in a mature stage of evolution in humans.",

First, most of the AA changes discovered are from the more recent samples reported from outside China, thus hinting AA changes to be part of the viral adaptation. Second, the 8 AA mutations appear clustered as if having one AA mutation would make it more likely to acquire another one. Third, and particularly alarming, is the most successful AA mutation at position 28144 of the ORF8 gene. This mutation occurs once in the 13 samples (7.8%) collected before January 5, all from Wuhan. In the 42 samples collected after January 10, all from outside Wuhan, the mutation is observed in 18 samples (43%). While this jump may seem startling, the sample size is really too small to afford strong statistical confidence. Hence, our call for more data is highly relevant here as the 28144 mutation may, or may not, be a very dangerous one. Furthermore, the second most successful AA mutation, although found in only 5 of the 55 samples, is scattered wide among samples from outside mainland China; they are from Orange County (CA2/2020, USA), Paris (IDF0373, 0373/2020, France), Kaohsiung (2/2020, China) and Clayton (VIC01/2020, Australia).",

Two-months is also roughly the length of the first stage of SARS virus evolution. We hope that the pattern observed above is due to stochastic fluctuations inherent in small data sets, especially the non-random ones (e.g., samples from the same family). There is no reason to be unduly alarmed but, again, accurate and timely releases of data remain the only way to be sure.",

Academic journals. including National Science Review, must take a carrot-and-stick approach. On the carrot side, we have proposed that journals accept for publication genomic data lightly analyzed soon after their acquisition [1] .
