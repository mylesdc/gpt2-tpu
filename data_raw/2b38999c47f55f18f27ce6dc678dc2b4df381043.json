            "text": "Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging pathogen causally associated with serious sequelae in fetuses, inducing fetal microcephaly and other neurodevelopment defects. ZIKV is primarily transmitted by mosquitoes, but can persist in human semen and sperm, and sexual transmission has been documented. Moreover, exposure of type-I interferon knockout mice to ZIKV results in severe damage to the testes, epididymis and sperm. Candidate ZIKV vaccines have shown protective efficacy in preclinical studies carried out in animal models, and several vaccines have entered clinical trials. Here, we report that administration of a synthetic DNA vaccine encoding ZIKV pre-membrane and envelope (prME) completely protects mice against ZIKV-associated damage to the testes and sperm and prevents viral persistence in the testes following challenge with a contemporary strain of ZIKV. These data suggest that DNA vaccination merits further investigation as a potential means to reduce ZIKV persistence in the male reproductive tract.",

            "text": "Z ika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging pathogen causally associated with serious sequelae in fetuses, inducing fetal microcephaly and other neurodevelopment defects [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . ZIKV has been shown to persist in human semen [7] [8] [9] and sperm 10 up to several months after the onset of symptoms, and male-to-male 11 or male-to-female sexual transmission has been reported 7, [12] [13] [14] . Consistent with these observations, type I IFN receptor a chain null mice (Ifnar1 \u00c0 / \u00c0 ) exposed to ZIKV by the subcutaneous (s.c.) route contain high viral loads in the testes 15, 16 . Further, exposure of male Ifnar1 \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice to ZIKV and exposure of type I IFN-depleted wild-type mice to mouse-adapted ZIKV results in severe damage to the testis, epididymis and sperm with a measurable reduction in fertility 17, 18 . Moreover, male rhesus and cynomolgus macaques exposed to ZIKV by the s.c. route have high viral loads in semen, and infected cells can be detected in the prostate, seminal vesicles and testes 19 .",

High viral RNA loads (3 \u00c2 10 7 to 1 \u00c2 10 12 genome equivalents per gram) were detected in the testes at 7 d.p.i. and persisted at day 21 d.p.i. (Fig. 1a) . Infectious virus (up to 3.2 \u00c2 10 8 TCID 50 per g) were identified in the majority of mice testes at 21 d.p.i by standard infectious assay ( Supplementary Fig. 2a ). No ZIKV RNA or infectious virus were detected in uninfected control animals at any point throughout the study. At day 14 post-infection, a decrease in testicle size ( Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 2b ) and weight (Fig. 1c) were observed in several of the infected mice, which became more pronounced at day 21 with means that were significantly different (two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) Po0.0001). Microscopic evidence of damage to the seminiferous epithelium was evident at 7 d.p.i. which may include degeneration of the spermatogenic lineage (Fig. 1d, upper panel) . Viral antigen was observed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) multifocally throughout the seminiferous epithelium which includes all layers of maturing spermatogenic cells and Sertoli cells (Fig. 1d, middle panel) . In the testis at 14 d.p.i. there were large areas where the normal architecture of the seminiferous tubule was completely replaced by necrotic debris and inflammatory cells, primarily neutrophils (Fig. 1d, upper panel) . The connective tissue areas surrounding the tubules were expanded by an infiltrate of mixed inflammatory cells including macrophages, neutrophils and lymphocytes (Fig. 1d, upper panel) . Abundant viral antigen was observed in affected seminiferous tubules (Fig. 1d, middle panel) . At 21 days the normal architecture was completely effaced with massive loss of seminiferous tubules and replacement by fibrous tissue and inflammatory cells (Fig. 1d, upper panel) , and lymphocyte infiltration, including macrophages, was observed ( Supplementary Fig. 2c,d) . Abundant viral antigen was observed within remaining affected seminiferous tubules (Fig. 1d , middle panel). Through 7, 14 and 21 d.p.i. there was increasing evidence of cell death via the mechanism of apoptosis as assessed by TUNEL staining (Fig. 1d , lower panels). Scattered necrosis of epithelial cells was noted in the epididymis at 7 d.p.i. with abundant necrotic sloughed epithelial cells and degenerating spermatozoa present in the lumens (Fig. 1e, upper panel) . Abundant viral antigen staining was observed by IHC in the epididymal lumens (Fig. 1e, lower panel) . In the epididymis at 14 d.p.i., the lining cells were low cuboidal with increased basophilia, reflecting loss of cells and attempted regeneration. The lumens contained numerous sloughed necrotic epithelial cells, degenerating spermatozoa and a small number of normal appearing spermatozoa (Fig. 1e, upper panel) . Only scattered, infected lining epithelial cells were observed at day 14 but viral antigen was observed within the lumens affecting the sloughed cells and spermatozoa (Fig. 1e , lower panel). At 21 d.p.i, the epididymal lumens contained primarily necrotic debris and degenerated cells (Fig. 1e, upper panel) . Abundant viral antigen staining was also observed within the epididymal lumens (Fig. 1e , lower panel).",

In order to determine whether the vaccine could protect against ZIKV-induced damage to the male reproductive tract a ZIKV-prME DNA vaccination study was initiated. Five-week-old Ifnar1 \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice received two vaccinations by the i.m. route with electroporation-mediated DNA delivery at 2-week intervals with 25 mg of the control vector (pVax1) or ZIKV-prME DNA vaccine (ZV-prME). Mice were challenged 2 weeks after the second immunization with a total of 1 \u00c2 10 6 p.f.u. of ZIKV strain PRVABC59 by the s.c. route. The testes and epididymis were harvested at 28 d.p.i. from sham-vaccinated and vaccinated mice and compared to testes obtained from age-matched phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) mock-infected and ZIKV-infected mice. Unvaccinated and sham-vaccinated mice that received a ZIKV challenge lost weight and 30% of the mice were euthanized due to weigh loss and other morbidity, including hind-limb paralysis ( Supplementary Fig. 3a-c) . Conversely, prME-vaccinated mice did not show signs of morbidity and mortality ( Supplementary Fig. 3a-c) , exhibiting normal pathology comparable to unchallenged control mice. Following ZIKV challenge, high ZIKV RNA loads were detected in the testes of unvaccinated and sham-vaccinated mice, but no detectable virus was present in the testes of the synthetic prME-vaccinated mice (Fig. 3a) . Moreover, there was an evident reduction in testis size (Fig. 3b) and weight (Fig. 3c ) in all unvaccinated and sham-vaccinated mice that received a ZIKV-challenge compared to the uninfected and prME-vaccinated mice (two-way ANOVA P \u00bc 0.0001). The testis size (Fig. 3b) and weight (Fig. 3c) were not significantly different in sham-vaccinated compared to untreated-infected mice. Histopathological analysis revealed that unvaccinated or sham-vaccinated mice exposed to ZIKV suffered severe damage to the testis with the normal architecture disrupted Figure 1 | ZIKV infection of the testis and epididymis.

Immune cell infiltrates into the testes consisting of CD4 \u00fe , CD8 \u00fe and NK cells ( Supplementary Fig. 3d ) and macrophages ( Supplementary  Fig. 3e ) were observed in unvaccinated, but not prME-vaccinated mice exposed to ZIKV.

While the disease phenotype observed in ZIKV-infected Ifnar1 \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice, including weight loss and neurological signs, is more severe than the mild illness typically associated with human infection; this model provides a stringent test to evaluate the ability of investigational therapeutics and vaccines to protect against ZIKV pathogenesis, including the mitigation and prevention of genitourinary signs and viral persistence within the male reproductive tract. Administration of the control plasmid vector, pVax1, before ZIKV infection resulted in an apparent reduction in ZIKV RNA detected in the testis (Fig. 3a) , increase in testis weight (Fig. 3c) , reduction in ZIKV RNA detected in the sperm (Fig. 4a) and improved sperm parameters (Fig. 4c-f) parameters between pVax1 and non-treated infected mice were not statistically significant (ANOVA P40.05). We speculate that pVax1 treatment alone could stimulate a non-specific inflammatory response from the injection of naked DNA followed by electroporation. This phenomenon has been reported previously in vertebrates in part due to unmethylated CpG motifs within plasmid DNA molecules 27 . Future studies with larger group sizes could be performed to investigate this possibility. ZIKV persistence in human semen 7-9 and sperm 10 has been documented for up to several months following the onset of symptoms, and pathological genitourinary symptoms have been described in infected men, including microhematospermia and dysuria 12, 13, 28 . However, deleterious effects on sperm parameters and fertility, transient or otherwise, in ZIKV-infected males, including those exposed to the virus in utero, have not been reported to this day. Studies on this subject will be critical to better understand the physiopathology of ZIKV in humans as well as the full utility of the mouse models of ZIKV infection. There is, however, precedent for such an occurrence: while typically spontaneously self-resolving, bilateral mumps orchitis has been shown to result in suboptimal fertility in infected men 29 . Further, sexual transmission of ZIKV between humans has been well documented 7, [11] [12] [13] [14] , and additional studies are likely warranted in a mouse model of sexual ZIKV transmission 30 to also assess the ability of investigational therapeutics and vaccines to prevent this from occurring.",

The mice were randomly assigned into their respective groups and housed and treated in a temperature-controlled, light-cycled facility in accordance with the Public Health Agency of Canada Institutional Animal Care Committee guidelines. Mice were immunized with 25 mg of DNA in a total volume of 30 ml of water delivered into the tibialis anterior muscle with in vivo EP delivery. In vivo EP was delivered with the CELLECTRA adaptive constant current EP device (Inovio Pharmaceuticals, PA) at the same site immediately following DNA injection. A three-pronged CELLECTRA minimally invasive device was inserted B2mm into the muscle. Square-wave pulses were delivered through a triangular 3-electrode array consisting of 26-gauge solid stainless steel electrodes and two constant current pulses of 0.1 Amps were delivered for 52 ms per pulse separated by a 1 s delay. Further protocols for the use of EP have been previously described in detail 35 . Mice were immunized two times at 2-week intervals and challenged 2 weeks after the final immunization. Blinding of the animal experiments were not performed, and samples sizes were not calculated a priori. No animals were excluded from the data analysis.",
