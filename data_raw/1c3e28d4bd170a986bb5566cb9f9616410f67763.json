In this way, parameters estimated from this dataset read as: cross-group mixing ! = 0.11, and contact ratio ! = 1.1. The former is in the ballpark for the estimates for Europe and quite close to the average European value of 0.097, the latter points out a behavior close to the one observed for Belgium, where adults are the principal responsible for the long range seeding and also the drivers of the local spreading since they interact more than children. From census data we have an estimate of the fraction of children ! = 0.24, which is quite close to the European value. ",
