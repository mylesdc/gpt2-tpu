The in vivo study explored the demoting effects of astragalin on epithelial to mesenchymal transition in BALB/c mice sensitized with ovalbumin (OVA). Results: The exposure of 20 \u03bcM H 2 O 2 for 72 h accelerated E-cadherin loss and vimentin induction in airway epithelial BEAS-2B cells, which was reversed by non-toxic astragalin at 1-20 \u03bcM. Astragalin allayed the airway tissue levels of ROS and vimentin enhanced by OVA challenge. Collagen type 1 production increased in H 2 O 2 -exposed epithelial cells and collagen fiber deposition was observed in OVA-challenged mouse airways. This study further investigated that the oxidative stress-triggered autophagic regulation was responsible for inducing airway fibrosis. H 2 O 2 highly enhanced the expression induction of the autophagy-related beclin-1 and light chains 3A/B (LC3A/B) within 4 h and astragalin blocked such induction by H 2 O 2 . This compound deterred the ROS-promoted autophagosome formation in BEAS-2B cells. Consistently, in OVA-sensitized mice the expression of beclin-1 and LC3A/B was highly induced, and oral administration of astragalin suppressed the autophagosome formation with inhibiting the induction of these proteins in OVA-challenged airway subepithelium. Induction of autophagy by spermidine influenced the epithelial induction of E-cadherin and vimentin that was blocked by treating astragalin.",

Oxidative stress contributes to airway and lung damage and consequently to several respiratory inflammatory diseases, including cystic fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [9] . Also, excessive production of ROS is thought to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of asthma, where exhaled levels of ROS positively correlate with disease severity [10] . Recent investigation has shown a crucial involvement of autophagy in the pathogenic processes underlying pulmonary diseases [11] . Indeed, autophagy is observed in the lung in response to oxidative stress evoked by the exposure to environmental toxicants [7, 11] . Thus, the role of autophagy in pulmonary toxicity may offer new clues to strategies to treat lung injury linked to oxidative stress [12] . However, whether autophagy is responsible for promoting cell survival or cytotoxicity in the airways and lung remains elusive. In addition, the function of autophagy in the disease pathogenesis is still unclear and may entail impaired or elevated autophagic activity or imbalances in the activation of autophagic proteins.",

One investigation reveals that pretreatment with astragalin can improve survival during lethal endotoxemia and attenuate inflammatory responses in a murine model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury [17] . Our recent study showed that astragalin antagonized endotoxin-induced oxidative stress leading to epithelial eosinophilia and Figure 1 Chemical structure of astragalin (A), cytoprotection of astragalin against H 2 O 2 (B), and number of neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (C, BALF). BEAS-2B cells were cultured with 20 \u03bcM H 2 O 2 in the absence and presence of 1-20 \u03bcM astragalin for 72 h (B) and cell viability (mean \u00b1 SEM, n = 4) was measured by MTT assay. BALF was harvested from BALB/c mice (n = 6, each group) 24 h after the final challenge with OVA or PBS vehicle (C). The bar graphs represent quantitative results and means without a common letter differ, P < 0.05. apoptosis [18] . However, the inhibitory effects of astragalin on pulmonary fibrosis and autophagy are not yet elucidated. Based on the literature evidence that astragalin possesses antioxidant property and anti-allergic activity [17, 18] , the current study investigated whether astragalin inhibited epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) leading to pulmonary fibrosis and autophagic activity of H 2 O 2 -exposed airway epithelial BEAS-2B cells and in ovalbumin (OVA)-challenged mice. Furthermore, the interconnection between pulmonary fibrosis and autophagy under oxidative episodes was explored to emphasize a role underlying autophagy in asthmatic fibrosis.",

The non-purified diet composition is as follows: NLT (Not Less Than) 20.5% crude protein, NLT 3.5% crude fat, NMT (Not More Than) 8.0% crude fiber, NMT 8.0% crude ash, NLT 0.5% calcium and NLT 0.5% phosphorus. Mice were allowed to acclimatize for 1 week before beginning the experiments. Mice were divided into four subgroups (n = 6 for each subgroup). Mice were sensitized with 20 \u03bcg OVA dissolved in a solution of 30 \u03bcl PBS and 50 \u03bcl Imject Alum by a subcutaneous injection twice on day 0 and day 14. For the dietary interventions, 0.1 ml astragalin solution (10 or 20 mg/kg BW) was orally administrated to OVA-sensitized mice 1 h before challenge. On day 28, 29 and 30, 5% OVA inhalation to mice was performed for 20 min in a plastic chamber linked to an ultrasonic nebulizer (Clenny 2 Aerosol, Medel, Italy). Control mice were sensitized and challenged with PBS as the OVA vehicle. Twenty four hours after the latest provocation (day 30), all mice were killed with an anesthetic (2 \u03bcl/kg rompun and 8 \u03bcl/kg zoletil, i.p.). The trachea was cannulated, and both lungs and airways were rinsed in 1 ml PBS for the collection of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). The numbers of inflammatory cells including eosinophils in BALF were determined using a Hemavet HV950 Multispecies Hematologic Analyzer (Drew Scientific, Oxford, CT). The right lungs were collected, frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at \u221280\u00b0C until used for Western blotting. Left lungs were preserved and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and then used for immunohistochemical analyses. The total inflammatory cell number in the BALF of mice exposed to OVA increased with a predominance of eosinophils ( Figure 1C ). The oral administration of astragalin deterred the increase in the number of eosinophils in OVA-treated mice, indicating that astragalin alleviated airway inflammation.",

Pulmonary fibrosis, a progressive and lethal lung disease, is characterized by inflammation and accumulation of ECM components [27] . This study showed that the oxidant H 2 O 2 enhanced the collagen type-1 production and the OVA antigen augmented the collagen fiber deposition in the airway subepithelial compartments. Pulmonary fibrosis as well as how best to relieve an imbalance in ROS production would be major therapeutic challenges for which new strategies are warranted. In the present study astragalin as an antioxidant was effective in encumbering airway fibrosis triggered by oxidative stress.

In this study astragalin allayed the EMT process by restoring Ecadherin expression and reducing vimentin induction in oxidant-experienced airway epithelial cells and OVAchallenged airway tissues. There is growing evidence suggesting that EMT entails TGF-\u03b21 in alveolar epithelial cells and may contribute to airway remodeling in severe asthma and fibrotic lung diseases [10] . In addition, the association between ROS and TGF-\u03b21-induced fibrosis has been discussed [26] . Oxidative stress elicits the production of cytokines and growth factors that may play a pivotal role in invasive myofibroblastic differentiation and collagen deposition.
