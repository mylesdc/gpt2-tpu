            "text": "Dogs has been extensively used as animal models for medical research and drug evaluation, such as studying human breast cancer carcinogenesis (Abdelmegeed and Mohammed, 2018) , Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) (Wells, 2018) , management of furcation defect (Afifi et al., 2018) , chronic myocardial infarction (MI) (Xiong et al., 2018) , comparative pathogenesis study of H3N2 canine influenza virus (CIV) challenged (Luo et al., 2018) , long term safety and efficacy of AAV gene therapy (Lee et al., 2018) . Therefore, it is critical to make sure that the dogs used as laboratory animals are free of special pathogens. In China, according to the national standard of laboratory dogs, the rabies virus (RV), canine parvovirus (CPV), canine adenovirus (CAV), and canine distemper virus (CDV) are the items that must be tested. All the laboratory dogs and their living houses should be checked up with these viruses regularly for quality monitoring. However, the currently existing detection method recommended by the industry standard is conventional PCR. To complete the whole check routine, four individual PCR should be carried out, which is time-consuming, especially when dealing with a large scale of samples. A rapid and sensitive multiplex pathogens detection technology is needed to meet the detection requirement of monitoring the animal health status and the sanitary of their living environment. Unlike the existing multiplex PCR methods that only focus on two or three targets and cannot be adapted to high-throughput testing. The luminescent beads are a novel platform for multiplex high-throughput detection and can simultaneously detect up to 100 targets in a single reaction (Dunbar, 2006; Liu et al., 2012) . This tool had been adapted for use in genetic analysis, gene expression analysis, SNP analysis, and pathogen identification (Chen et al., 2000; Ocheretina et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2016) . The Luminex xTAG assay was designed for multiple nucleic acid detection in a single reaction through the hybridization of magnetic microspheres and PCR products (Chen et al., 2015; Reslova et al., 2017) . The magnetic microspheres pre-coupled with anti-MagPlex-TAG oligo-nucleotides capture the matching oligo-nucleotide presented on the 5 end of PCR amplicons. A Luminex fluorescence reader is then used for analytical measurements of bead types. This technology is commercially available for respiratory viral pathogens and gastrointestinal pathogens for human clinical diagnoses (Pabbaraju et al., 2011; Duong et al., 2016) , and barely reports on applications in veterinary research.",

All viruses, nucleic acids and vaccines were stored at \u221280 \u2022 C until use. Clinical samples were obtained from the local veterinary clinic in Guangzhou, China. DNA and RNA were extracted using a commercial automatic nucleic acid extraction instrument (Tiangen Biotech, Beijing, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions.",
