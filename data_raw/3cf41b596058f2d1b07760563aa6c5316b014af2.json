Despite widespread outbreaks in many countries, no effective PDCoV vaccines are currently available. Here, we generated, for the first time, a full-length infectious cDNA clone of PDCoV. We further manipulated the infectious clone by replacing the NS6 gene with a green fluorescent protein (GFP) to generate rPDCoV-\u0394NS6-GFP; likewise, rPDCoV-\u0394NS7 was constructed by removing the ATG start codons of the NS7 gene. Growth kinetics studies suggest that rPDCoV-\u0394NS7 could replicate similarly to that of the wild-type PDCoV, whereas rPDCoV-\u0394NS6-GFP exhibited a substantial reduction of viral titer in vitro and in vivo. Piglets inoculated with rPDCoV-\u0394NS7 or wild-type PDCoV showed similar diarrheic scores and pathological injury. In contrast, rPDCoV-\u0394NS6-GFPinfected piglets did not show any clinical signs, indicating that the NS6 protein is an important virulence factor of PDCoV and that the NS6-deficient mutant virus might be a promising live-attenuated vaccine candidate. Taken together, the reverse genetics platform described here not only provides more insights into the role of PDCoV accessory proteins in viral replication and pathogenesis, but also allows the development of novel vaccines against PDCoV infection.",

They are currently classified into four genera, the Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-, and Deltacoronavirus, identified in diverse animal species including humans [2] . With its origin still unknown, porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is a recently emerged deltacoronavirus in swine. It particularly targets neonatal piglets, causing acute diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration and high mortality [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . In 2012, PDCoV was first identified in swine herds in Hong Kong and was subsequently reported as an enteric pathogen causing diarrhea in the United States in 2014 [2, 3, [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Shortly thereafter, PDCoV has been reported in South Korea, mainland China and Thailand [4, 12, 13] . Currently, PDCoV, together with other enteric viruses including porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), rotavirus (RV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), is causing enormous economic losses in the swine industry worldwide [9, 14] .",

The genome organization is similar to those of other reported delta-CoVs with the typical gene order of: 5 \u2032 UTR-ORF1a/1b-S-E-M-NS6-N-NS7-3 \u2032 UTR [3, 8, 12] . ORF1a and ORF1b encode two large replicase precursor polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, with the expression of the latter involving a \u22121 ribosomal frameshift mechanism [16] . According to studies on other CoVs, the replicase pp1a and pp1ab are generally cleaved by virus-encoded proteases into 15 non-structural proteins involved in viral transcription and replication. PDCoV encodes the traditional coronavirus structural proteins, the spike glycoprotein (S), the envelope protein (E), the membrane glycoprotein (M), and the nucleocapsid protein (N). Although general characteristics of the coronaviral proteins and their roles in viral replication have been clarified, the detailed functions and roles of the proteins encoded by PDCoV in host cells and animals are still largely unknown.",

For example, replacement the ORF3 with the red fluorescent protein (RFP) gene in PEDV resulted in the partial attenuation of the virus in piglets [27] . Deletion of the ORF 6 in SARS-CoV also led to a significant attenuation in animal models [24] . Similarly, MHV and FIPV mutants bearing defective accessory protein genes were also dramatically attenuated when inoculated into their natural hosts [17, 28] . Recently, PDCoV NS6, which is located between the M and N, and NS7, which is occupied within the N gene in an alternative ORF, were identified as the accessory proteins [29] . Moreover, NS7a, a 100-amino-acid-polypeptide identical to the C-terminus of NS7, has also been identified as a novel accessory protein [30] . To the best of our knowledge, no previous reports have addressed the role of PDCoV proteins, particularly the accessory proteins, in viral replication and pathogenicity.",

Thus, these unique overhangs between each fragment allow for the systematic, directional, and efficient assembly of each fragment into the full-length genomic cDNA of PDCoV by in vitro ligation. In addition, three naturally occurring BsmBI restriction sites, separately located in fragment B, D, F, were removed by C-T changes at positions 6857, 15616, 23753, respectively. Notably, changes in BsmBI cutting sites gave rise to silent mutations, thereby not affecting protein products.

Following three rounds of plaque purification, the infectivity of rPDCoV in LLC-PK1 cells was confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence assays (IFA) using nucleocapsid (N) protein-specific antibodies ( Figure 1B ).

As expected, NS6 or NS7 expression was not detected in cells infected with mutants with disrupted NS6 or NS7, whereas N expression was apparent in those infected by all recombinant viruses ( Figure 2C ). Strong GFP signal was also detected in cells infected with rPDCoV-\u0394NS6-GFP ( Figure 2C ), suggesting the viral sgmRNA corresponding to the GFP gene was expressed effectively. In addition, the NS6, NS7 and N proteins expression in the cell culture infected by various recombinant viruses were also examined by western blot analysis ( Figure 2D ), which were in congruence with results of the IFA. It is noteworthy that the expression of NS7a was also abolished in the rPDCoV-\u0394NS7infected cells ( Figure 2C ) as its initiation codon was also altered (from ATG to ACG) in the rPDCoV-\u0394NS7 cDNA clone.

A very similar growth pattern was also observed in infected IPI-2I cells ( Figure 3C ). To further explore whether the reduced viral yield of rPDCoV-\u0394NS6-GFP was due to the absence of NS6 expression, we performed a complementation analysis in LLC-PK1 cells transiently expressing NS6 protein. Interestingly, cells transfected with the NS6-expressing plasmid exhibited significant enhancement of viral titers for both PDCoV and rPDCoV-\u0394NS6-GFP, compared to those transfected with empty vector ( Figure 3D ).

Within 2 days post-inoculation (DPI), all piglets orally fed with PDCoV-, rPDCoV-, and rPDCoV-\u0394NS7 experienced varying degrees of diarrhea, vomiting, lethargy, and anorexia (Table 1) .

Of note, we could still detect the fecal PDCoV RNA levels in rPDCoV-\u0394NS6-GFPinoculated piglets at 1-7 DPI, but they were significantly lower compared to other groups ( Figure 4A ). To investigate the in vivo proliferative capacity and pathogenicity between PDCoV and its deletion mutants, three pigs from each group were randomly selected and sacrificed on 4 DPI.

Until now, at least six pathogenic coronaviruses have been reported in swine, including porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), Swine Acute Diarrhea Syndrome Coronavirus (SADS-CoV), porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) and Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV). PDCoV is among newly emerged enteropathogenic coronaviruses known to cause severe diarrhea in suckling piglets. To date, no effective vaccines are available to control PDCoV outbreaks. In this study, we successfully constructed the full-length cDNA clone of PDCoV strain CHN-HG-2017 to rescue the infectious PDCoV in vitro, the first reverse genetic system for deltacoronaviruses until now. This technology platform is currently needed for the rational design of attenuated viruses. In addition, this infectious clone serves as a useful molecular tool for systematically investigating the role of viral genes in deltacoronavirus replication, pathogenesis, and virulence. The full-length cDNA clone of PDCoV was assembled from a panel of six adjoining fragments using in vitro ligation; an approach successfully utilized for developing the infectious clones of TGEV, MHV, IBV, NL63, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and PEDV [27, [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] . The full-length sequence of rPDCoV was identical to the parental PDCoV strain, except for three silent mutations introduced to remove BsmBI restriction sites. The parental PDCoV and rPDCoV demonstrated similar biological characteristics. Both caused indistinguishable CPE in LLC-PK1 cells ( Figure 1B) , exhibited comparable levels of protein expression ( Figure 2D ), generated nearly alike plaque size in LLC-PK1 cells ( Figure 3A) , and replicated with similar growth kinetics in LLC-PK1 and IPI-2I cells ( Figure 3B and C) .",

Currently, the role of accessory proteins in the replication of delta-CoVs are not clearly elucidated. Here, we employed the reverse genetics to construct recombinant PDCoVs with abortive NS6 or NS7 genes and demonstrated that both NS6 and NS7 were not essential for PDCoV replication in vitro ( Figure 2C and D) . In addition, we showed, using rPDCoV-\u0394NS7, that the NS7a, a newly identified accessory protein encoded by PDCoV [30] , is also not required for efficient replication in LLC-PK1 cells. However, it is important to emphasize that while rPDCoV-\u0394NS7 with both NS7 and NS7a deletion exhibited similar growth kinetics with the parental virus in vitro, rPDCoV lacking the functional NS6 displayed markedly lower replication efficiency ( Figure 3B and C). These data thus suggested that PDCoV accessory protein NS6, but not NS7, is very like play a key role in promoting viral replication.",

            "text": "Although dispensable for viral replication, coronavirus accessory proteins usually play pivotal roles in viral infection and pathogenesis in vivo. Menachery et al. reported that deletion of ORF3, ORF4a, ORF4b, and ORF5 in MERS-CoV led to a significant attenuation of the virus in mice [38] . On the other hand, newborn piglets infected with TGEV lacking protein 7 expression developed a faster and more pronounced clinical disease compared with the parental virus [39] . In this study, piglets infected with rPDCoV-\u0394NS6-GFP showed minimal clinical signs, with significantly lower viral RNA copy numbers in small intestines compared with wild-type virus. In contrast, piglets orally fed with rPDCoV-\u0394NS7 exhibited clinical manifestations and pathological injury similar to those infected with the wild-type virus (Figures 4-6, Table 1 ). These results suggested that the NS6 protein is necessary for efficient viral replication in vivo, which may be attributable to the high pathogenicity of PDCoV. Recently, Fang et al. demonstrated that the PDCoV NS6 predominantly localize to the ER complex and ER-Golgi intermediate compartment, which is the site of coronavirus assembly and packaging [29] , suggesting that NS6 may be involved in virus assembly. Moreover, PDCoV NS6 was identified as an inhibitor of IFN-\u03b2 expression by interacting with RIG-I and MDA5 to impede their association with doublestranded RNA, thus disturbing RLR-mediated IFN-\u03b2 signal pathway [40] . It is thus probable that the NS6 protein might contribute to PDCoV pathogenesis by, at least in part, regulating virus-host interaction. Given that rPDCoV-\u0394NS6-GFP is highly attenuated in vivo, it could be considered a promising vaccine candidate for PDCoV. Although immunological profiles of pigs inoculated with rPDCoV-\u0394NS6-GFP are still needed to fully support its applicability, our study here provides the basis for rational development of recombinant live attenuated PDCoV vaccines.",

All cDNA fragments were synthesized based on PDCoV passage 3 sequence (GenBank accession number MF095123.1) and were ligated in the pJET1.2/blunt Cloning Vector (Thermo Scientific). Three naturally occurring BsmBI restriction sites were removed by silent mutations to produce unique BsmBI sites at appropriate locations across the PDCoV genome. Sequences of all PDCoV fragments were verified by sequencing after plasmids preparation from bacterial cultures. The plasmids containing PDCoV fragments were digested or double-digested with BsmBI, MluI, or XhoI designated in Figure 1A , separated on a 0.8% agarose gel, excised, and purified using a QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen). The digested PDCoV fragments were mixed and ligated overnight at 4\u00b0C using T4 DNA ligase (Thermo Scientific), phenol/chloroform extracted, and precipitated with isopropyl alcohol.

All piglets were confirmed negative for PDCoV, PEDV, TGEV, and rotavirus by virus-specific RT-PCRs on rectal swabs. Neutralizing antibodies against PDCoV were not detected in sera of the piglets or sow. After 1 day acclimation, piglets were orally challenged with 10 ml of PDCoV, rPDCoV, rPDCoV -\u0394NS6-GFP, or rPDCoV-\u0394NS7 at a dose of 1.0 \u00d7 10 7 TCID 50 , while the mock-infected group was inoculated with 10 ml of maintenance medium. Piglets were monitored daily for the presence of vomiting and clinical signs of diarrhea, lethargy, and anorexia. Diarrhea severity was scored with the following criteria: 0, normal; 1, pasty stool; 2, semiliquid diarrhea; and 3, liquid diarrhea. Rectal swabs were collected daily for detecting virus shedding by a quantitative PDCoV N-gene based real-time RT-PCR. At 4 DPI, three piglets in each group were randomly selected and necropsied, the different sections of the small intestine (duodenum, jejunum, ileum) were collected for detection of viral RNA by RT-qPCR and histopathological examination by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining.
