However, it is not unusual to encounter cloning difficulties for one or more influenza genes while attempting to recover virus de novo. To overcome some of these shortcomings we sought to develop partial or full plasmid-free RG systems. The influenza gene of choice is assembled into a RG competent unit by virtue of overlapping PCR reactions containing a cDNA copy of the viral gene segment under the control of RNA polymerase I promoter (pol1) and termination (t1) signals -herein referred to as Flu PCR amplicons. Transfection of tissue culture cells with either HA or NA Flu PCR amplicons and 7 plasmids encoding the remaining influenza RG units, resulted in efficient virus rescue. Likewise, transfections including both HA and NA Flu PCR amplicons and 6 RG plasmids also resulted in efficient virus rescue. In addition, influenza viruses were recovered from a full set of Flu PCR amplicons without the use of plasmids.",

The viral RNA (vRNA) is found in the virion and infected cells in the form of viral ribonucleoprotein particles (vRNPs) associated with three polymerase subunits (PB1, PB2, and PA) and the nucleoprotein (NP) [4, 5] . The virus encodes for two surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), the proton pump transmembrane protein (M2), the matrix protein (M1), the nuclear export protein (NS2/NEP), the nonstructural protein (NS1) and, in some influenza viruses (from an alternative translation start site in segment 1) the PB1-F2, an apoptosis modulatory protein [6] [7] [8] . Additional viral protein products include PB1-N40, derived from an alternative start site within the PB1 ORF, resulting in a protein product that lacks the first 39 aa of PB1, and PA-X, derived from the PA mRNA and consists of the N-terminal 191 aa of PA fused to 61 aa that result from +1 frameshifting [9, 10] .",

            "text": "De novo synthesis of influenza viruses by reverse genetics (RG) requires not only the viral RNA but also the viral protein components [11] [12] [13] [14] . Thus, RG systems for influenza rely invariably on a dual promoter concept: One for the synthesis of vRNA segments and another for the synthesis of viral mRNAs [11] . Since the termini of influenza vRNAs are crucial for virus replication, plasmids carrying a RNA polymerase I (pol1) or T7 RNA polymerase promoters have been used to generate vRNAs with the exact 39 end, whereas a pol1 terminator sequence (t1) or a hepatitis h ribozyme have been used to generate the exact 59 end. Plasmids carrying typical RNA polymerase II (pol2) promoters (CMV and/or chicken b-actin promoters) have been utilized for the synthesis of influenza mRNAs [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . Despite the great advantages of this technology, and although variations to the plasmid-based approach have been developed, they inevitably rely on a cloning step [20, 21] . A system that does not rely on cloning could speed up studies on the significance of mutations in the viral genome for replication and/or modulation of virulence. In this report, Flu PCR amplicons, instead of plasmids, are an efficient and viable alternative to the plasmid-based RG system.",

In order to determine whether a Flu PCR amplicon could be transfected into cells and be amplified by the influenza polymerase complex, a PCR product was produced encoding the GFP reporter gene in negative orientation flanked by the influenza segment 7 untranslated regions (UTRs) and further flanked by the human pol1 promoter and the mouse t1 termination signal, pol1EGFPt1 (Fig. 1A, Fig. S1A , Table S1 ). Co-transfection of the pol1EGFPt1 amplicon along with 4 protein expression plasmids encoding the influenza virus polymerase complex (3P) and NP into 293T cells resulted in efficient amplification of the reporter replicon and detection of green fluorescence signal ( Fig. 2A) . The proportion of green cells observed was comparable to those observed in the positive control cells co-transfected with pHW72-EGFP and the 3P and NP expression plasmids (Fig. 2B) . The fluorescence signal of another amplicon, pol1EGFPutr, which lacks the t1 signal, was present in fewer cells compared to the pol1EGFPt1 amplicon indicating that run off transcription by the RNA pol1 complex may result in vRNA fragments with incorrect and/or incomplete influenza sequences (Fig. 2C ). As expected, no fluorescence signal appeared when cells were transfected with a Flu GFP PCR amplicon lacking the pol1 and t1 elements (UTREGFPutr) (Fig. 2D ) or by removing the PB1 plasmid in cotransfected cells with either PCR amplicons or pHW72-EGFP plasmid ( Fig. 2E and data not shown) .",

            "text": "In order to demonstrate whether Flu PCR amplicons could be used to replace plasmids in the RG system, the strains mouse-adapted A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) [22] and A/chicken/ North Sumatra/072/2010 (H5N1) -herein referred to as H1N1pdm and 072, respectively -were used as donors for the HA and NA genes ( Fig. 1B and Fig. 3) . A specific set of internal primers designed within conserved regions of these gene segments were then developed in order to maximize gene amplification from viral cDNA preparations and to assemble the appropriate HA and NA PCR amplicons (Fig. 3, Fig. S 2A and B) . The pol1HA pdm t1 PCR amplicon carried a full-length copy of the HA gene from the H1N1pdm strain flanked by the pol1 and t1 signals ( Fig. 2A) . With respect to the 072 HA gene, the internal primers were designed to delete (D) the polybasic amino acid signal sequence (RERRKRRR) and replace it with one carrying a monobasic cleavage site (TETR) (Fig. 3B, Fig. S 2) . Similar strategies were followed to create the NA amplicons pol1NA pdm t1 and polNA 072 t1 from viral cDNAs ( Fig. 3C and D) . Full-length pol1HA pdm t1 and pol1NA pdm t1 PCR amplicons were obtained and confirmed by sequencing (Fig. 2E ). In addition, full-length HA and NA PCR amplicons were generated lacking either the t1 sequence or both the pol1 and t1 sequences, which serve as controls for efficiency of virus rescue as described below. Sequencing results confirmed the amplification of an overlapping DH5 HA amplicon, pol1HA D072 t1, with a deleted polybasic cleavage site and the full-length amplification of the polNA 072 t1 (Fig. 3F, Fig. S 2) . . PCR-based reverse genetics. A) PCR-based Flu reporter replicon encoding GFP: PCR amplification was performed using primers spanning the pol1 to t1 sequences and pHW72EGFP. After agarose gel purification and testing to show that the PCR product is devoid of plasmid DNA contamination, the Flu GFP amplicon is transfected into 293T cells along with four expression plasmids encoding the polymerase complex of influenza virus. Expression of GFP reflects influenza polymerase activity on a vRNA Flu GFP replicon generated from pol1 transcription of the Flu GFP amplicon. Variations to this these are described in the main text and shown in Fig. 2 . B) Starting with a influenza virus candidate, vRNA, cDNA and reconstitution of a full-length Flu PCR amplicon (in this case, the HA and NA PCR amplicons are depicted) is performed. Transfection of Flu PCR amplicons along with appropriate complementary RG plasmids into susceptible cells leads to the generation of recombinant influenza viruses with the desired gene constellation. The strategy speeds up the reverse genetics process by obviating a classical cloning step, which is currently part of the plasmid-based RG system. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0046378.g001 Efficient influenza virus rescue using Flu PCR amplicons in either ''1+7'' or ''2+6'' modes The pol1HA pdm t1 or pol1HA D072 t1 HA PCR amplicons (Table 1) were co-transfected into co-cultured 293T/MDCK cells in a ''1+7'' mode along with 7 RG plasmids encoding the corresponding additional gene segments from the influenza A/Puerto Rico/ 8/1934 (H1N1) strain (PR8). At 48 h and 72 h post-transfection (hpt) cells co-transfected with the pol1HA pdm t1 PCR amplicon plus 7 RG PR8 plasmids (H1 pdm :7PR8) showed typical virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE). H1 pdm :7PR8 virus titers at 72 hpt reached 3.16610 4 TCID 50 /ml, which was 5 times lower than the one obtained using the corresponding pH1pdm RG plasmid (pH1 pdm :7PR8, 1.58610 5 TCID 50 /ml) ( Table 1) . After a subsequent blind passage in MDCK cells or 9 day-old embryonated chicken eggs, virus titers increased .10 7 TCID 50 /ml with either the pol1HA pdm t1 PCR amplicon or the whole plasmid-based RG system. Likewise, the DH5N1 virus could be rescued using the pol1HAD 072 t1 HA PCR amplicon and 7 RG PR8 plasmids (H5D 072 :7PR8, Table 1 ). At 72 hpt, H5D 072 :7PR8 virus titer in transfected cells was 1.58610 4 TCID 50 /ml, and increased to 2.32610 8 TCID 50 /ml when passaged in eggs (Table 1) . At 72 hpt, the TICD 50 titer of the PCR-based H5D 072 :7PR8 virus was 10, 000 times less than that of pH5D 072 :7PR8 virus, which was obtained with the bidirectional pRF1437 plasmid ( Table 1) .",

By plaque assay, the H5D 072 :7PR8 virus was found to form plaques in agar plates in the presence, but not in the absence, of 1 mg/mL TPCK- (Fig. 4C) , consistent with the reconstitution of a monobasic cleavage site in the HA gene during PCR amplification. To further confirm that these viruses carry a DH5 gene and/or do not present additional mutations introduced during PCR amplification, each of these viruses was plaquepurified and the HA gene was sequenced and analyzed for 48 plaque-purified viruses for each of three RG viruses, H5D 072 :7PR8, pH5D 072 :7PR8 , and control RG-derived PR8. Every single virus isolate from the H5D 072 :7PR8 virus group contained a monobasic cleavage site identical to the one designed in the PCR primers. Mutations were identified elsewhere but in only 4 out of the 48 sequences analyzed for the H5D 072 :7PR8 virus and in each case corresponded to single nucleotide changes (Table  S2 ). The mutations caused amino acids changes in 3 of them; however, these changes did not alter the antigenic make up of these viruses by HI assay (Table S2) . No mutations were identified in HA sequences derived from plaques obtained from the RGderived PR8 or pH5 D072 :7PR8 viruses (data not shown).

Similarly, PCR amplicons for HA and NA lacking both the pol1 and t1 signals were prepared and used as controls.

The strategy to produce full-length HA and NA PCR amplicons was based on amplification of the pol1 promoter from the pDP2002 vector, subtype specific internal primers for HA and NA and, depending on the product, primers containing a t1 termination signal. A) The HA pdm was amplified with the following overlapping fragments: 1, fragment spanning the primer set pT1FragFwd and SwHA-931R (which incorporates the t1 signal), 2, fragment spanning from the SwHA-752F and polFragRev, and 3, polI promoter fragment amplified using polF and hPol1Rev primers.

            "text": "In this report, a significant modification was introduced to the plasmid-based reverse genetics system [25, 26] for influenza based on PCR amplicons. In order to optimize and maximize amplification of the genes of interest, a strategy involving overlapping PCR fragments for each segment was designed and used in conjunction with a high fidelity polymerase and corresponding buffer, Phusion high-fidelity PCR master mix with GC Buffer (New England Biolabs). This enzyme performed the best in our hands, compared to seven other commercially available DNA polymerases (Supplementary materials and methods S1). The synthesis of full length Flu PCR amplicons implies producing overlapping PCR fragments with distinct differences in GC-versus AT-rich regions. The human and canine pol1 promoters are approximately 75% GC-rich whereas the HA segment is approximately 60% AT-rich (data not shown). The approach succeeded in producing overlapping PCR amplicons for the HA and NA segments from different subtypes, including H1N1pdm, H5N1, or H9N2 (not shown) and from the 6 internal gene segments of the PR8 strain by designing overlapping primers and optimizing the PCR conditions (Fig. S 2) . The amount obtained in each reaction for full length Flu PCR amplicons was in the order of 1,5 mg (Fig. 2) , which is sufficient for transfection and virus rescue and comparable to the amount of plasmid DNA used for transfection in the conventional plasmid-based RG system (Table 1) . For the H5N1 vaccine candidates, the polybasic cleavage site (RERRRKKR) in highly pathogenic strains was easily removed and replaced by a low pathogenic sequence (TETR) by virtue of adequate set of primers and overlapping PCR (Table S1, Fig. 3 and Fig. S 2) . Plaque assays revealed that the rescued H5D 072 PCR:7PR8 virus was strictly dependent on the presence of TPCK-trypsin, which strongly suggests that the virus Viruses recovered by reverse genetics were used to infect MDCK cells at a MOI of 0.001. At 36 hpi, cells were fixed with 4% Paraformaldehyde in PBS solution (Santa Cruz) and viral antigen detected by IFA using subtype specific monoclonal antibodies and FITC-labeled antimouse antibodies (green). Counterstaining was performed with propidium iodide (red).

This is not surprising since each overlapping PCR fragment is produced and purified independently prior to assembly the reaction to generate the full length PCR product. In addition, a low mutation rate was observed with approximately 8% of the plaque-purified viruses having a single nucleotide mutation. It is not fully understood at this stage whether those mutations are naturally present in the wild type 072 virus. Notably, the HA gene of clone 43 (Table S2 ) contained a mutation at aa position 151, which was shown related to a switch of receptor specificity from a 2,3 to a 2, 6 linked sialic acids [27] . Since the 072 virus used in this report has undergone more than one passage in eggs, it is possible that the homogeneity of its population had contributed to the finding of the small mutation rate among the H5D 072 PCR:7PR8 clones. Nevertheless, the results clearly show that the PCR-based RG strategy does not create a heterogeneous virus population. In this regard, it could be argued that the PCR-based approach will be most likely better represent the virus population present in the original virus isolated compared to the plasmid-based system.",

Such analysis is beyond the scope of the present report. It could also be argued that the PCR-based system may produce a more variable virus population than the one that is obtained using the plasmid-based system. Although there is such possibility, it is an inherent nature of influenza viruses to evolve through point mutations and therefore no reverse genetics system is error free. However, the sequencing of reassortants produced in this study does not show mutations that would alter the antigenicity of the HA surface proteins. In this regard, for vaccine development, as long as the vaccine seed stock is antigenically identical to the vaccine candidate, other mutations would be irrelevant. In fact, inactivated influenza vaccines prepared by classical reassortment have only two pre-requisites: 1) HA surface gene derived from the vaccine candidate and 2) high growth in eggs. Full genome sequencing of vaccine viruses is not a pre-requisite for approval of the vaccine by the FDA.",

Using a combination of PCR amplicons and plasmids, it would be possible to streamline the study of gene variants for one or more gene segments and determine fitness, pathogenesis or any other biological aspect of the virus. Several mutant viruses with mutations in one or more genes could be produced without having to prepare individual clones. Recovery of viruses entirely from PCR products implies that other viral systems could be amenable to a similar strategy. This could be particularly important for viruses with genomes larger than the influenza virus that are occasionally associated with cloning difficulties or plasmid instability. In fact, PCR amplification for the purpose of virus generation has already been done for coronaviruses, although the PCR product was used as template for in vitro RNA transcription and the resulting RNA was later transfected into cells [28] . In summary, a RG system for influenza was developed that does not require a cloning step for recovery of viruses and has profound implications for vaccine development, pandemic preparedness, and for the study of influenza viruses.",

A) PCR-based Flu reporter replicon encoding GFP: PCR amplification was performed using primers spanning the pol1 to t1 sequences and pHW72EGFP. After agarose gel purification and testing to show that the PCR product is devoid of plasmid DNA contamination, the Flu GFP amplicon is transfected into 293T cells along with four expression plasmids encoding the polymerase complex of influenza virus. Expression of GFP reflects influenza polymerase activity on a vRNA Flu GFP replicon generated from pol1 transcription of the Flu GFP amplicon. Variations to this these are described in the main text and shown in Fig. 2. B) Starting with a influenza virus candidate, vRNA, cDNA and reconstitution of a full-length Flu PCR amplicon (in this case, the HA and NA PCR amplicons are depicted) is performed. Transfection of Flu PCR amplicons along with appropriate complementary RG plasmids into susceptible cells leads to the generation of recombinant influenza viruses with the desired gene constellation. The strategy speeds up the reverse genetics process by obviating a classical cloning step, which is currently part of the plasmid-based RG system. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0046378.g001",

The strategy to produce full-length HA and NA PCR amplicons was based on amplification of the pol1 promoter from the pDP2002 vector, subtype specific internal primers for HA and NA and, depending on the product, primers containing a t1 termination signal. A) The HA pdm was amplified with the following overlapping fragments: 1, fragment spanning the primer set pT1FragFwd and SwHA-931R (which incorporates the t1 signal), 2, fragment spanning from the SwHA-752F and polFragRev, and 3, polI promoter fragment amplified using polF and hPol1Rev primers. The three PCR products above were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and combined in equal proportions (10 ng each) to create the full length pol1HA pdm t1 PCR amplicon using the primer pair pT1FragFwd and hPol1Rev. B) An overlapping PCR strategy to produce an H5 HA segment in which the polybasic cleavage site from the chicken/North Sumatra strain was removed and replaced by the sequence of low pathogenic virus following the strategy described above.
