            "text": "Virus-host interactions drive a remarkable diversity of immune responses and countermeasures. We found that two RNA viruses with broad host ranges, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and Sindbis virus (SINV), are completely restricted in their replication after entry into Lepidopteran cells. This restriction is overcome when cells are co-infected with vaccinia virus (VACV), a vertebrate DNA virus. Using RNAi screening, we show that Lepidopteran RNAi, Nuclear Factor-\u03baB, and ubiquitin-proteasome pathways restrict RNA virus infection. Surprisingly, a highly conserved, uncharacterized VACV protein, A51R, can partially overcome this virus restriction. We show that A51R is also critical for VACV replication in vertebrate cells and for pathogenesis in mice. Interestingly, A51R colocalizes with, and stabilizes, host microtubules and also associates with ubiquitin. We show that A51R promotes viral protein stability, possibly by preventing ubiquitindependent targeting of viral proteins for destruction. Importantly, our studies reveal exciting new opportunities to study virus-host interactions in experimentally-tractable Lepidopteran systems.",

Thus, not surprisingly, investigations into virus-host interactions have produced important and fundamental new insights into both cellular and pathophysiology (Panda and Cherry, 2012) . Invertebrate model organisms have proven useful in elucidating a wide range of host responses to infection and because many of these responses are well conserved, studies in model organisms are often directly relevant to human health (Moser et al., 2010; Panda and Cherry, 2012; Moy et al., 2014) . Notably, studies of invertebrate antiviral RNA interference (RNAi) pathways (Fire et al., 1998; Zhou and Rana, 2013) have produced powerful tools for probing and manipulating gene function, with potential utility for direct therapeutic intervention (Blake et al., 2012) .",

Dipteran organisms, such as Drosophila melanogaster, have been the primary focus of virus-host studies in invertebrates and Drosophila RNAi screens have greatly enhanced our understanding of how eukaryotic host factors can promote or inhibit virus replication (Cherry, 2011) . These studies have almost exclusively focused on RNA viruses (Xu and Cherry, 2014) . In contrast to Dipterans, most virus-host studies in the order Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies) have focused on DNA viruses, particularly baculoviruses (Ikeda et al., 2013) . These studies have provided key insights into highly conserved mechanisms by which Lepidopterans combat DNA virus infection (Ikeda et al., 2013) . Thus, while Lepidopterans provide a relevant model for studying DNA virus-host interaction they have not previously been used to probe restrictions to RNA virus replication.",

Exploring the susceptibility and responses of L. dispar and other Lepidopterans to virus infection is of particular importance in designing new and effective virus-based biocontrol strategies to minimize the devastating economic impact these species continue to have on the forest industry (Sparks et al., 2013) . L. dispar-derived cell lines are susceptible to a wide variety of invertebrate DNA viruses, and as such, they are often used in virus-host studies (Sparks and Gundersen-Rindal, 2011) . Interestingly, L. dispar-derived LD652 cells can also support a limited infection by vaccinia virus (VACV), a vertebrate poxvirus encoding a large dsDNA genome (Li et al., 1998) . During infection of LD652 cells, VACV undergoes early gene expression, DNA replication and late gene expression, but the infection is abortive due to a defect in one or more steps of virion morphogenesis (Li et al., 1998) . VACV entry and early gene expression have also been documented in Drosophila cells, however viral DNA replication and subsequent late gene expression were not detected, indicating that VACV replication is blocked earlier in its life cycle in Drosophila cells than in LD652 cells (Moser et al., 2010) . Despite these limitations, RNAi screening of VACV-infected Drosophila cells has identified multiple host factors required for VACV entry in eukaryotic hosts (Moser et al., 2010) . Thus, the LD652 cell culture system provides a unique model in which to explore multiple aspects of vertebrate DNA virus biology, including basic replication strategies and suppression of host immune pathways by viral proteins.",

This species of moth was accidently introduced into North America from Europe in the late 1800s, and its caterpillars have become a major pest because they destroy hardwood trees and forests. Gypsy moth outbreaks are still a serious problem, but their numbers can be kept in check by using biological control strategies, such as DNA viruses. However, the response of gypsy moths to infection by RNA viruses has not been studied extensively. Gammon et al. now show that, after being infected with one of two different RNA viruses, gypsy moth cells can slow down and eventually halt the replication of the RNA viruses. However, if the gypsy moth cells are also infected with a DNA virus, they lose their ability to restrict the replication of the RNA virus. Gammon et al. discovered that the moth's immunity to RNA virus infection is disarmed by a protein called A51R from the DNA virus. This protein increases the stability of the proteins in the RNA virus, most likely by stopping the moth from breaking them down.",

We unexpectedly found that LD652 cells restrict both VSV and SINV replication after virus entry. Using RNAi to knock down the expression of candidate L. dispar antiviral immunity factors, we show that specific RNAi and innate immune pathway components restrict RNA virus replication. We also uncover a role for the Lepidopteran ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) in restricting RNA virus replication. Surprisingly, co-infection with VACV strongly suppressed this restriction, suggesting that VACV encodes one or more factors that promote RNA virus replication. Using RNAi and genetic techniques, we found that the highly conserved, and previously uncharacterized, VACV A51R gene product is sufficient to alleviate the LD652 cell restriction to VSV and SINV replication. Interestingly, A51R formed aggregate-and filament-like structures that colocalize with microtubules (MTs) and protected MTs from depolymerization. Using alanine mutagenesis, we further show that an A51R point mutant with reduced RNA virus rescue ability still forms filamentous structures and stabilizes MTs, suggesting that A51R functions, in addition to MT stabilization, are required for disarming Lepidopteran antiviral immunity. Using mass spectrometry-based techniques, we found that A51R co-immunoprecipitates with several host proteins, including ubiquitin (Ub). Using radiolabeling and immunoblotting, we show that A51R does not affect viral mRNA translation rates but does promote virus protein stability, possibly by inhibiting Ub-dependent host targeting of viral proteins for degradation. Importantly, we show that A51R is also required for efficient replication of VACV in vertebrate cells and for pathogenesis in mice, indicating that A51R is a VACV virulence factor. Collectively, our findings demonstrate the utility of Lepidopteran systems for the study of RNA-and DNA virus host interactions and shed light on how this economically-important order of insects restricts virus replication.",

In single infections with VSV-GFP (Kato et al., 2005) or SINV-GFP (Cristea et al., 2006) , we found that, even at a high multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10, <4% of LD652 cells exhibited GFP fluorescence by 96 hr post-infection (hpi) ( Figure 1A,B) . A previous report indicated that VACV enters LD652 cells and reaches the stage of late gene expression but ultimately fails to complete virion morphogenesis (Li et al., 1998) . VACV, like other poxviruses, encodes numerous immunomodulatory proteins that inhibit a wide variety of host antiviral pathways (Smith et al., 2013) . We therefore wondered if VACV co-infection (although abortive) might nevertheless overcome an immune response in LD652 cells that restricts RNA virus replication. Consistent with this idea, when LD652 cells were co-infected with VSV-GFP or SINV-GFP and the Western Reserve (WR) strain of VACV (VACV-WR), the number of GFP-positive cells increased to \u223c77% (VSV-GFP) and \u223c45% (SINV-GFP) by 96 hpi (Figure 1A,B) .",

We did, however detect a small amount of VSV Matrix (M) structural protein ( Figure 1E ). Enhancement of LUC and SINV E1 capsid protein expression during VACV-WR co-infection with SINV-LUC was also confirmed by immunoblot ( Figure 1F ). Importantly, measurement of VSV-LUC and SINV-LUC titers from LD652 cultures also reflected LUC activity, remaining unchanged over time in single infections but increasing during VACV-WR co-infection ( Figure 1G,H) .

Furthermore, at 8 hpi RT-PCR analysis of VSV-and SINVinfected cells detected a similar level of viral transcripts with or without VACV-WR co-infection ( Figure 1-figure supplement 1C,D) . Remarkably, we could also rescue VSV and SINV gene expression (albeit to reduced levels) by the addition of VACV-WR as late as 24 hpi with RNA virus (Figure 1 figure supplement 1E,F).

We chose an ActD dose range such that the highest dose (0.1 \u03bcg/ml) reduced cell viability by \u223c50% after 48 hr of treatment ( Figure 2A) . We found that the higher ActD doses enhanced viral gene expression by as much as \u223c100-fold compared to control treatments ( Figure 2B ). These results suggest that host cell transcription is required for LD652 resistance to RNA virus infection and that LD652 cells express antiviral immunity factors. It should be noted that ActD treatment can induce apoptosis in invertebrate cells (Wang et al., 2008) and previous studies have found apoptosis induction to enhance SINV replication in mosquitoes (Wang et al., 2012) , thus it is possible that the enhanced viral replication observed in the presence of ActD may be in part due to apoptosis induction in LD652 cells.",

To test if VACV binding and entry into LD652 cells is sufficient to rescue RNA virus infection in the absence of VACV gene expression, we co-infected LD652 cells with VSV or SINV and a heat-inactivated strain of VACV expressing the late A5L core protein fused to GFP (A5L-GFP) (Carter et al., 2003) . Heat inactivated VACV, which can enter cells but cannot express its genes (Dales and Kajioka, 1964) , failed to rescue VSV and SINV replication ( Figure 3A) , indicating that VACV gene expression was required for rescue. Next we treated co-infected cells with the viral DNA polymerase inhibitor cytosine arabinoside (AraC) at a dose that blocks viral DNA replication and subsequent late poxvirus gene expression (Li et al., 1998) . We confirmed that AraC treatments blocked late VACV gene expression by immunoblotting for A5L-GFP in the absence or presence of AraC (data not shown). We found that inhibiting post-replicative VACV gene expression did not prevent rescue of either VSV or SINV ( Figure 3B ), narrowing the RNA virus rescue activity to one or more of the 118 early VACV genes (Yang et al., 2010) . We next screened a collection of VACV mutants for their ability to rescue RNA viruses in LD652 cells. We found that the attenuated modified VACV strain Ankara (VACV-MVA) (Antoine et al., 1998) failed to fully rescue either VSV or SINV as compared to either VACV-WR or Copenhagen strains ( Figure 3C,D) , despite similar levels of viral gene expression by all three VACV strains ( Figure 3E ). These results suggested that VACV-MVA is defective for one or more factors required for RNA virus rescue in LD652 cells.",

            "text": "To confirm the necessity of A51R for VACV rescue of RNA virus infection, we created a recombinant VACV-WR strain with a deletion of the A51R gene (\u0394A51R) (Figure 4-figure supplement 2A) . Importantly, we found that co-infection with \u0394A51R resulted in a 100-fold reduction in VSV gene expression relative to co-infection with VACV-WR ( Figure 4C ). VSV was rescued by co-infecting with revertant VACV strains ( Figure 4C ), expressing a Flag-tagged A51R gene (Flag-A51R) reintroduced into either the A51R locus (\u0394A51R FA51R ) or the VACV thymidine kinase (J2R) locus (\u0394J2R/\u0394A51R FA51R ). In addition, we reverted the \u0394A51R strain with a Flag-tagged form of the VACV-MVA A51R gene (Flag-MVAA51R) introduced into the J2R locus (\u0394J2R/\u0394A51R FMVAA51R ). Flag-A51R and Flag-MVAA51R proteins migrated as single bands of \u223c38 and 35 kDa, respectively, on immunoblots ( Figure 4 -figure supplement 2B,C). The lower molecular weight of the VACV-MVA protein is likely due to a C-terminal truncation of \u223c20 amino acids that results from a genomic deletion that occurred during VACV-MVA passage in culture (Antoine et al., 1998) . Furthermore, consistent with the idea that the VACV-MVA A51R protein is not functional, we found that the \u0394J2R/\u0394A51R FMVAA51R strain failed to fully rescue VSV ( Figure 4C ). Importantly, immunoblot of lysates from a time course of A51R FA51R infection confirmed that Flag-A51R is expressed early in VACV infection, as it was detected by 2 hpi in the absence or presence of AraC ( Figure 4-figure supplement 2D ). Together these results indicate that A51R is an early VACV protein necessary to relieve the restriction of VSV in LD652 cells.",

Although only \u223c40-60% of cells expressed detectable Flag-A51R protein (data not shown), we observed an \u223c60-fold increase in VSV and 12-fold increase in SINV gene expression relative to control transfections with empty p166 vector or vector encoding Flag-tagged GFP (Flag-GFP) ( Figure 4E ). Immunoblots confirmed similar levels of Flag-GFP and Flag-A51R expression in these lysates ( Figure 4F ). VSV and SINV titers were similarly enhanced by Flag-A51R transfection ( Figure 4G-H) . These results indicate that Flag-A51R expression is sufficient to overcome the host restriction to RNA virus replication in the absence of other VACV proteins.

Strikingly, we found that A51R from each poxvirus enhanced VSV gene expression to a similar level ( Figure 5 ).

Moreover, using similar assays, we found that A51R homologs from other poxviruses also co-localize with and protect MTs from depolymerization ( Figure 7-figure supplement 2B) . Finally, in LD652 cells, as in vertebrate cells, Flag-A51R formed aggregates and filamentous structures that co-localized with and protected MTs from depolymerization by the MT-depolymerizing agent vincristine ( Figure 7B ). Taken together, our findings suggest that the ability of A51R to interact with the host MT cytoskeleton is a conserved property of A51R proteins.",

Therefore we performed systematic alanine mutagenesis of A51R residues that were directly conserved or conserved based on charge. After screening over 30 point mutations throughout the VACV A51R protein, we found that almost all of the mutants displayed significantly reduced protein stability, rendering virus rescue and MT-related functions difficult to assess (data not shown). However, alanine substitution of residue R321, which lies within the C-terminal region of A51R that is missing in VACV-MVA A51R ( Figure 8A) , produced a suitable mutant for analysis. Flag-A51R R321A proteins displayed a reduced VSV rescue phenotype when compared to Flag-A51R proteins ( Figure 8B ) despite similar levels of expression ( Figure 8C) . Importantly, when expressed in LD652 cells in the presence of vincristine, both Flag-A51R ( Figure 8D ; Video 1) and Flag-A51R R321A ( Figure 8D ; Video 2) formed filamentous structures that overlapped with tubulin staining ( Figure 8D ).

            "text": "The previous results suggested that A51R may provide functions, beyond MT stabilization, that promote RNA virus replication. In order to explore A51R protein complexes we used highly-sensitive (Washburn et al., 2001) to identify proteins associated with A51R immunoprecipitation (IP) complexes using mass spectrometry. We transfected LD652 cells with either empty vector or with Flag-A51R expression vector and then analyzed Flag antibody immunoprecipitates 48 hr post-transfection. We matched peptides identified in these LD652 cell immunoprecipitates to Flag-A51R sequence as well as to the available Bombyx mori proteome. Filtering differential normalized spectral abundance factor (NSAF) (Zybailov et al., 2006) values from both control and Flag-A51R immunoprecipitates identified the four most-enriched proteins in Flag-A51R treatments. These proteins are the target Flag-A51R, myosin II essential light chain (a constituent of the actomyosin cytoskeleton [Clark et al., 2007] ), Ub, and ribosomal protein S15 (a component of the 40S subunit of the ribosome that has also been shown to modulate the activity of specific E3 ubiquitin ligases [Daftuar et al., 2013] ) ( Table 2 ). Unfortunately we found that the majority of A51R associated with insoluble cell fractions, making direct immunoblot analysis of immunoprecipitated materials impossible. Given our knowledge that RNAi of Ub transcripts ( Figure 2C,D) or inhibition of the UPS system (Figure 2-figure supplement 1) enhances RNA virus gene expression in L. dispar cells and that A51R associates with Ub, we asked if A51R expression might affect viral protein stability. To first investigate if there were differences in viral protein translation rates in the presence of A51R, we used a two hour pulse of [ 35 S]methionine to label newly-synthesized proteins in virus-infected LD652 cells. We then analyzed the abundance of newly synthesized, radiolabeled VSV N protein after immunoprecipitation from these lysates. We found that radiolabeled VSV N protein was undetectable in cells infected only with either VACV-WR (control) or VSV-LUC. In contrast, we found significant quantities of radiolabeled VSV N protein in VSV-LUC-infected cells that were also infected with either VACV-WR or \u0394A51R strains ( Figure 9A, top panel) . These results suggest that viral protein translation rates are too low to be detected by this method in VSV-LUC single infections but are detectable (and surprisingly similar) in co-infections with VACV-WR or \u0394A51R strains. When whole cell extracts from these experiments were immunoblotted for total VSV N protein levels, again we found that VSV N was not detected in either VACV-WR or VSV-LUC single infection lysates. However, total VSV N protein levels were dramatically reduced in \u0394A51R co-infections compared to co-infections with VACV-WR ( Figure 9A , middle panel). To determine if the reduced VSV N protein levels in \u0394A51R co-infections might be due to altered VSV N protein stability, we calculated the half-life of newly-synthesized VSV N protein using pulsechase analyses. Although newly synthesized VSV N protein could be detected during co-infection with either VACV-WR or \u0394A51R strains ( Figure 9B) , the levels of radiolabeled protein appeared to diminish more rapidly during \u0394A51R co-infection ( Figure 9C ). Regression analyses of pulse-chase experiments estimated the half-life of VSV N to be \u223c5.3 hr during co-infection with VACV-WR while only \u223c1.8 hr during co-infection with the \u0394A51R strain. Collectively, these data suggest that A51R associates with Ub and promotes viral protein stability.",

We therefore pre-treated BSC-40 cells with interferon (IFN) to induce an antiviral state in cells prior to VACV infection and asked whether A51R is required to overcome an IFN response. Comparing the titers of VACV-WR, \u0394A51R, or \u0394A51R FA51R cultures pretreated with IFN to parallel cultures without IFN treatment, we found that IFN pre-treatment reduced VACV-WR and \u0394A51R FA51R titers by \u223c10-fold by 24 hpi relative to control treatment. \u0394A51R titers, Figure 9 . A51R promotes RNA virus protein stability in LD652 cells. Cells were infected with the indicated strains for 72 hr and then pulsed for 2 hr with [ 35 S]methionine. To visualize radiolabeled, nascent VSV N protein, cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecpitation with anti-VSV N protein antibodies and immunoprecipitated complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography (top panel). Equal fractions of each total cellular lysate were also used in parallel immunoblot experiments to detect total VSV N (middle panel) or actin protein levels. (B and C) Cells were infected with VSV-LUC and the indicated VACV strains as in (A), pulsed for 2 hr with [ 35 S]methionine and then chased for the indicated times at which point cell lysates were collected and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-VSV N antibodies. Immunoprecipitated complexes were then separated by SDS-PAGE, visualized by autoradiography (B) and the percentage of radiolabeled VSV N protein remaining (compared to T = 0, representing the end point of the 2 hr pulse) at each time point post-pulse was plotted (C). Note that lysates containing radiolabeled VSV N protein from VACV-WR and \u0394A51R co-infections time courses (B) were processed separately and thus band intensities between VACV infection treatments are not directly comparable.

We also used an RNAi screen to identify A51R as a poxvirus factor that overcomes Lepidopteran immunity to virus infection. A51R stabilizes a subset of host MTs and promotes RNA virus protein stability, which might be explained by its association with Ub. In addition we have shown that A51R is critical for VACV infection in vertebrate cells and is a virulence factor in mice.

On the other hand, viruses may also benefit from inhibiting or reversing ubiquitination. For example, baculovirus-encoded Ub homologs can inhibit Ub chain elongation (Haas et al., 1996) , and several viruses encode potent deubiquitinating enzymes (Lindner, 2007) .

To our knowledge, this is the first example of heterologous virus rescue by a vertebrate virus in an invertebrate host. In mammalian cell culture, VACV also enhances VSV replication, but the VACV-encoded IFN response antagonists E3L and B18R are the major determinants of this rescue (Le Boeuf et al., 2010; Shors et al., 1998) . Since the IFN response appears to be vertebrate-specific (Mukherjee et al., 2014) , it was perhaps not surprising that we failed to observe any effect of E3L or B18R deletion on VACV-dependent VSV rescue in L. dispar cells (data not shown). Instead, we identified the previously uncharacterized VACV gene product A51R as a major determinant of VACV-mediated RNA virus rescue. Additional VACV proteins are likely to contribute to suppression of antiviral activity in L. dispar cells, since both VSV and SINV replication were partially rescued by co-infection with the \u0394A51R strain. This might explain why newly synthesized, radiolableled VSV N proteins were undetectable in single infections yet at relatively abundant (and similar) levels during co-infection with either VACV-WR or \u0394A51R strains, despite the lack of N protein accumulation in the latter co-infection. Thus, the highly restrictive nature of VSV and SINV infections in L. dispar cells, in combination with our sensitive LUC-based detection methods, may prove useful in identifying additional novel immunomodulators encoded by VACV and other viruses.",

First, our analysis indicates that A51R-mediated rescue occurs at a step after RNA virus entry. Second, the findings that A51R promotes RNA virus infection in multiple Lepidopteran (but not Dipteran) cells and promotes VACV infection in vertebrate hosts, suggests that A51R overcomes immunity mechanisms that are shared between Lepidopterans and mammals but absent or easily antagonized in Dipteran insects. Third, the suppression of host restriction to RNA virus replication and the association with MTs are both conserved features of A51R homologs from disparate vertebrate poxviruses, suggesting that both immunomodulatory and MT-stabilization functions may be important for poxvirus replication. This idea is supported by the reduced replication of the \u0394A51R strain in vertebrate cell culture and in mice. Finally, the association of A51R with Ub and the A51Rdependent VSV protein stabilization we observed, along with the aforementioned roles of the UPS in restricting RNA virus replication, point to a role for A51R in usurping or inhibiting host Ub machinery.",

Furthermore, the truncated VACV-MVA A51R protein fails to form filamentous, nocodazole-resistant MTs. Thus, the presence or absence of functional A51R could explain why the nocodazole-resistant 'MT pieces' previously observed in VACV-infected cells were not observed in uninfected or VACV-MVA-infected cells (Ploubidou et al., 2000; Schepis et al., 2006) . Our results suggest that A51R is the elusive MT-stabilizing factor encoded by VACV.",

            "text": "When we initially observed an inability of VACV-MVA A51R to both rescue RNA virus replication and stabilize MTs, we hypothesized that stabilization of MTs may be the mechanism by which A51R promotes virus replication. Previous studies implicate MTs in promoting VSV and SINV gene expression (Qiu et al., 1998; Heinrich et al., 2010) , and tubulin has been shown to promote VSV RNA polymerase activity in vitro (Moyer et al., 1986) . Furthermore, VSV transport to the cell surface is reported to be Research article MT-dependent (Das et al., 2006) . However, a recent study found no effect of MT depolymerization on VSV and SINV replication (Matthews et al., 2013) . Thus the role of MTs in VSV and SINV replication remains unresolved. Considering the very early restriction of RNA virus gene expression in LD652 cells, it seems unlikely that A51R overcomes host restriction by promoting RNA virus transport on stabilized MTs. Furthermore, our studies with the A51R R321A mutant indicate that RNA virus rescue is not fully mediated by MT association or stabilization and therefore must require an additional function encoded by A51R. This finding however, does not rule out the possibility that MT-association is required for A51R immunosuppressive function or stability.",

            "text": "It is possible that A51R subverts host antiviral responses partly by perturbing MT-dependent transport of host factors and/or organelles. Previously it has been shown that VACV-WR infection causes redistribution of endosomes from dispersed cytosolic locations to large perinuclear clusters, suggesting that outward, MT-dependent endosomal trafficking might be impaired during VACV infection (Schepis et al., 2006) . This endosome clustering phenomenon requires early gene expression and one or more activities lacking in VACV-MVA (Schepis et al., 2006) . A51R fits these criteria, and thus could be the VACV factor that induces endosome clustering, perhaps to overcome a host mechanism that could otherwise trap viruses in endosomes. It is interesting to note that even at relatively late times post-infection (e.g., 24 hr) we detected punctate immunofluorescence staining patterns for VSV N and SINV E1 virion-associated proteins inside LD652 cells. It is possible that these punctate structures represent virions trapped inside endosomes as both VSV (Mire et al., 2010) and SINV (DeTulleo and Kirchhausen, 1998) can utilize endocytic modes of entry. It will be interesting in the future to determine if the expression of wild-type or mutant forms of A51R alter endosomal distribution in L. dispar cells and whether endosomal redistribution correlates with virus replication. Unfortunately, we have not yet found suitable reagents for monitoring endosome distributions in L. dispar.",

This phenomenon is particularly striking given the overall 10-fold lower total (intracellular + extracellular) virus titers of the \u0394A51R strain. The release of EEV is MT-dependent (Ploubidou et al., 2000) , and EEV is known to elicit neutralizing antibodies (Smith et al., 2002) . Thus it is possible that A51R attenuates virion transport along MTs, and subsequent EEV release, in order to allow the virus to escape activation of host immune responses (Schepis et al., 2006) . Interestingly, the Dryvax strain of VACV, which is used for smallpox vaccination, encodes a fragmented A51R gene (Qin et al., 2011) . These observations, along with the attenuated virulence of \u0394A51R strain in vivo, raise the intriguing possibility that loss of A51R function contributes to the induction of poxvirus immunity.",

Although we do not yet know specifically how A51R promotes virus protein stability, it is possible that A51R-dependent sequestration of Ub (or removal of Ub from viral proteins) acts to overcome a Ub-dependent mechanism that either activates host antiviral protein effectors or directly targets nascent viral proteins for destruction. This latter hypothesis predicts that Lepidopterans cells might have a mechanism to target protein synthesis that is coupled to cytoplasmic transcription. Importantly, inhibition of the UPS in L. dispar cells only enhanced LUC activity when cells were infected with LUC-encoding viruses and not when cells were simply transfected with a LUC expression plasmid. Given that VACV, VSV and SINV are all cytoplasmically-replicating viruses and that plasmid-based transcription of luc mRNA would occur in the nucleus, this hypothesis is not unreasonable.

This sample yielded 238,502,918 raw reads, which were subjected to quality control procedures implemented using the FASTX-toolkit (Provided by Dr G Hannon, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories, NY). Specifically, artifact reads were eliminated, and end sequences whose Phred scores corresponded to an error rate exceeding 1% were clipped. Only end-trimmed reads of 36 bases or longer were retained, and these were also required to have not less than 90% of their bases possessing a Phred score of 21 or higher. Post cleaning, the sample had 122,295,683 sequences (12,148,224,605 bases).

PUTs were partitioned into gold (7055 entries), silver (6353) and bronze (8251) tiers on the basis of alignment quality as described in Sparks et al. (2013) . The gold and silver tiers collectively defined a set of 13,408 unique PUTs mapping to 7593 unique NCBI NR records. These gold and silver tier PUTs were used to identify potential immunityrelated L. dispar transcripts and for the design of dsRNAs for RNAi. The cDNA sequences of the L. dispar transcripts identified in Figure 2C ,D are available in Supplementary file 1.",

Equal quantities of each lysate were subjected to immunoprecipitation in NP-40 buffer containing protease-inhibitor cocktail (Roche) using anti-Flag antibodies and protein G Dynabeads (Invitrogen). Immunoprecipitates were eluted from Dynabeads using glycine-HCl (pH 2) treatment for 10 min and were subsequently neutralized with neutralization buffer (0.5 M Tris-HCl, 1.5M NaCl). MuDPIT analyses of these eluted fractions were performed using an Accela HPLC and a Thermo LTQ connected to a homemade electrospray stage. Protein identification was performed with Integrated Proteomics Pipeline-IP2 (Integrated Proteomics Applications, Inc., San Diego, CA. http://www.integratedproteomics.com/). Tandem mass spectra were extracted from raw files using RawExtract 1.9.9 (McDonald et al., 2004) , searched against the Bombyx mori UniprotKB proteome (as well as Flag-A51R sequence), reversed sequenced using ProLuCID, (Peng et al., 2003) , and peptide candidates were filtered using DTASelect with the parameters -p 1 -y 1 --trypstat --sfp 0.01 -in Tabb et al.

After the 2 hr pulse, [ 35 S]methionine-containing medium was replaced with normal growth medium and lysates were then extracted either immediately (T = 0) or at the indicated times post-pulse using radioimmunoprecipitation buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1.0% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0). These whole cell extracts were then subjected to IP with anti-VSV N (10G4) antibodies or used directly in immunoblots to determine total VSV N protein levels. [ 35 S]-labeled VSV N IP complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE and then either dried on Whatman chromatography paper or directly transferred to nitrocellulose membranes.

Body weight, morbidity and mortality were monitored for 20-28 days. When necessary, animals were euthanized by administering pentobarbital sodium. To determine the extent of viral replication, 5 mice per group were euthanized at day 4 and 6 post-infection, and tissues were collected and processed as previously described (Duraffour et al., 2013) . Viral loads in tissue homogenates were titrated on HEL cells. Survival curves between VACV-WR and \u0394A51R virus-infected groups were compared using log-rank (Mantel-Cox) tests and tissue virus titers were compared using unpaired Mann Whitney tests. Statistical tests were performed using GraphPad Prism v6 software.Author contributions DBG, Conception and design, Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article; SD, DKR, MES, CCW, JJM, Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data; HH, RS, YC, GA, JRY, Acquisition of data, Drafting or revising the article; JHC, DC, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article; DEG-R, Acquisition of data, Drafting or revising the article, Contributed unpublished essential data or reagents; WLM, NS, Analysis and interpretation",
