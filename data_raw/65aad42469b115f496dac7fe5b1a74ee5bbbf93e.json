            "text": "Studies have suggested that excessive activation of the host immune system including macrophages is responsible for the severe pathologies mediated by IFV infection. Here, we focused on the X11 protein family member Mint3/ Apba3, known to promote ATP production via glycolysis by activating hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) in macrophages, and examined its roles in lung pathogenesis and anti-viral defence upon IFV infection. Mint3-deficient mice exhibited improved influenza pneumonia with reduced inflammatory cytokines/ chemokine levels and neutrophil infiltration in the IFV-infected lungs without alteration in viral burden, type-I interferon production, or acquired immunity. In macrophages, Mint3 depletion attenuated NF-\u03baB signalling and the resultant cytokine/chemokine production in response to IFV infection by increasing I\u03baB\u03b1 and activating the cellular energy sensor AMPK, respectively. Thus, Mint3 might represent one of the likely therapeutic targets for the treatment of severe influenza pneumonia without affecting host anti-viral defence through suppressing macrophage cytokine/chemokine production.",

            "text": "Munc18-1-interacting protein 3 (Mint3), also known as amyloid-\u03b2 A4 precursor protein-binding family A member 3 (Apba3), is a member of the X11 protein family 20, 21 . Mint3 is expressed in most cell types and localizes to the trans-Golgi network by interacting with membrane proteins such as amyloid precursor protein and furin 22, 23 . Previously, we have revealed that Mint3 activates hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) even in the presence of oxygen by suppressing its inhibitor, factor-inhibiting HIF-1 (FIH-1) 24 . Mint3 requires a transmembrane protease MT1-MMP/MMP14 to bind and suppress FIH-1 25, 26 . Thus, Mint3-mediated HIF-1 activation is limited to MT1-MMP expressing cells such as macrophages and cancer cells [25] [26] [27] . Mint3-deficient mice are viable and show no apparent defect. However, Mint3-deficent macrophages exhibit a defect in ATP production via glycolysis owing to reduced HIF-1 activity 25, 27, 28 . Mint3-deficient macrophages also showed impaired cytokine production in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 27 . Since FIH-1 also hydroxylates molecules other than HIF-1\u03b1 including I\u03ba B\u03b1 29 which inhibits the NF-\u03ba B signalling, FIH-1 suppression by Mint3 might affect inflammatory cytokine/ chemokine production via not only HIF-1 but also the NF\u03ba B signalling in macrophages. Because macrophages are one of the main sources of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines, here we hypothesized that Mint3 likely played roles in influenza pneumonia and in host protection against IFV.",

Consistent with the pathological data, the total number of infiltrated cells in BALF from Mint3 \u2212/\u2212 mice was decreased compared to that from WT mice on days 4 and 8 after IFV infection ( Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. S1a-c) . This was attributed to the significant decrease in neutrophils that comprised the major subpopulations of infiltrated cells (Fig. 1c) . In contrast, the numbers of T, B, and natural killer cells as well as macrophages were not significantly altered in BALF from the Mint3 \u2212/\u2212 lungs (Fig. 1c) . The levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, i.e., IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 , CCL3/MIP-1\u03b1 , CXCL1/KC, and CXCL10/IP-10, which have been reported to contribute to lung pathology 11, 12, 16 , also decreased in BALF from Mint3 \u2212/\u2212 mice compared to those from WT mice on day 4 after infection (Fig. 1d ). In addition, the levels of CXCL1/KC and CXCL10/IP-10 in BALF from Mint3 \u2212/\u2212 mice remained lower than those from WT mice on day 8 after infection. These data indicate that host Mint3 contributes to cytokine/chemokine production including the neutrophil chemoattractant CXCL1/KC at an early time point after IFV infection and influences subsequent inflammatory cell recruitment and lung pathology at a later time point. Collectively, Mint3 depletion attenuated the severe influenza pneumonia and improved host mortality in mice.",

To evaluate the impact of Mint3 deficiency on anti-IFV protection, we first analysed the viral copy number in the IFV-infected lungs of WT and Mint3 \u2212/\u2212 mice on day 0, 4, and 8 following the IFV infection. Mint3 depletion did not largely affect the viral copy number in the IFV-infected lungs (Fig. 2a) . Type-I interferons (IFN-\u03b1 /\u03b2 ) are the primary factors that induce host resistance to IFV. In particular, IFN-\u03b1 induction in the late stage of IFV infection is essential for protection against IFV 31, 32 . In contrast to cytokine/chemokine production, no significant difference was observed in IFN-\u03b1 production in the infected lungs between WT and Mint3 \u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 2b) . Notably, the level of the type-II interferon IFN-\u03b3 was significantly lower in the lungs of Mint3 \u2212/\u2212 mice than in those of WT mice on day 8 but not on day 4 after infection ( Fig. 2b) for unknown reasons. Next, we assessed the induction of humoral acquired immunity against IFV in Mint3 \u2212/\u2212 mice. WT and Mint3 \u2212/\u2212 mice were infected again with IFV on day 21 after the first infection (representing the second infection) and the production of virus-specific antibodies was analysed on day 7 after the second infection. Mint3 depletion in mice affected neither the production of virus-specific IgG in the serum nor virus-specific IgA in the lung mucosa (Fig. 2c) . Collectively, these data suggest that Mint3 is dispensable for the induction of protective immunity against IFV infection in mice.",

Macrophages and dendritic cells are known to comprise an early source of inflammatory cytokines and type-I interferons in pulmonary IFV infection 11, 16 . Mint3 depletion affects macrophage function owing to reduced HIF-1 activity and ATP production via glycolysis 25, 27, 28 . Thus, we focused on the function of Mint3 in macrophages and dendritic cells, and examined whether Mint3 in macrophages and dendritic cells is required for cytokine/chemokine production in response to IFV. Alveolar macrophages (AMFs), thioglycolate-induced peritoneal macrophages (TG-MFs), bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMFs), bone marrow-derived conventional dendritic cells (cDCs), or Flt3 ligand-induced plasmacytoid dendritic cells (FLT3L-DCs) prepared from WT or Mint3 \u2212/\u2212 mice were brought into contact with IFV in vitro and the production of IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 , and CCL2/MCP-1 was measured. The cytokine/chemokine production in response to IFV Supplementary Fig. S2c ). However, Mint3 depletion did not affect IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 , or CCL2/ MCP-1 production in cDCs (Fig. 3d ) and FLT3-DCs ( Fig. 3e ) in response to IFV. Thus, the reduced cytokine/ chemokine production by macrophages in response to IFV, but not by dendritic cells, likely accounts at least in part for the attenuation of influenza pneumonia in Mint3 \u2212/\u2212 mice.",

Next, nuclear translocation of NF-\u03ba B in IFV-stimulated BMMFs was examined by immunoblotting. Notably, NF-\u03ba B protein levels in the nuclear extracts of Mint3 \u2212/\u2212 BMMFs were lower than those of WT cells at the starting point (0 h) and remained lower during the observed time after IFV infection (Fig. 4b) .",

Thus, we analysed I\u03ba B and IKK in the cytoplasmic extracts from IFV-infected WT and Mint3 \u2212/\u2212 BMMFs. The expression and phosphorylation levels of IKK\u03b1 and IKK\u03b2 showed no apparent differences between WT and Mint3 \u2212/\u2212 BMMFs (Fig. 4c) .

In turn, a lower proportion of I\u03ba B\u03b1 was phosphorylated in Mint3 \u2212/\u2212 BMMFs after IFV stimulation (Fig. 4c) .

We hypothesized that the defect of ATP production via glycolysis and the resulting AMPK activation by Mint3 depletion also affects the IFV-induced NF-\u03ba B signalling in macrophages. To address this, WT and Mint3 \u2212/\u2212 BMMFs were infected with IFV in the presence of a glycolysis inhibitor, 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG), a mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation inhibitor, oligomycin, or vehicle, and the inflammatory cytokine/chemokine production was analysed. 2-DG but not oligomycin treatment decreased the inflammatory cytokine/chemokine production in WT BMMFs to the levels of Mint3 \u2212/\u2212 cells. The AMPK activator, 5-aminoimidazole-4 -carbox-amide-1-\u03b2 -D-ribofuranoside (AICAR), also decreased the inflammatory cytokine/chemokine production in WT BMMFs to the levels of Mint3 \u2212/\u2212 cells (Fig. 5c) . Next, we examined whether AMPK activation via the glycolysis defect relates to the I\u03ba B accumulation observed in Mint3 \u2212/\u2212 BMMFs (Fig. 4c) . To address this issue, I\u03ba B\u03b1 and AMPK\u03b1 in IFV-infected WT BMMFs treated with or without 2-DG were analysed. 2-DG treatment did not impact either total or phosphorylated I\u03ba B\u03b1 levels whereas both total and phosphorylated AMPK\u03b1 levels increased in IFV-infected WT BMMFs (Fig. 5d) and nuclear NF-\u03ba B levels decreased (Fig. 5e) . These results indicate that AMPK activation via the glycolysis defect attenuates NF-\u03ba B signalling independently from I\u03ba B accumulation in IFV-infected macrophages. In turn, we next examined whether I\u03ba B accumulation alone could attenuate NF-\u03ba B signalling in IFV-infected macrophages. To address this possibility, IFV-infected WT BMMFs were treated with or without an I\u03ba B\u03b1 phosphorylation inhibitor, BAY 11-7082 37 . BAY 11-7082 treatment decreased phosphorylated I\u03ba B\u03b1 levels and increased total I\u03ba B\u03b1 levels without affecting total and phosphorylated AMPK\u03b1 levels in IFV-infected WT BMMFs (Fig. 5f ). Under this condition, BAY 11-7082 treatment decreased nuclear NF-\u03ba B levels in WT BMMFs 3-6 h after IFV infection (Fig. 5g) . BAY 11-7082 treatment also decreased the inflammatory cytokine/chemokine production in WT BMMFs to the levels of Mint3 \u2212/\u2212 cells (Fig. 5h) . Thus, Mint3 depletion independently caused both AMPK activation and I\u03ba B accumulation, each of which could separately attenuate NF-\u03ba B signalling independently in macrophages.",

Type II interferon IFN-\u03b3 production was reduced in the lungs of Mint3 \u2212/\u2212 mice compared to that in the lungs of WT mice on day 8 but not on day 4 after IFV infection (Fig. 2b) .

IFN-\u03b3 is not essential for viral clearance 39 ; however, its presence during IFV infection ameliorates the severity of inflammation and lung injury 40 . Although how much the reduction of IFN-\u03b3 levels by Mint3 depletion affects the IFV-mediated lung injury remains unclear, supplementation with IFN-\u03b3 might support therapies of IFV-infected lung diseases based on Mint3 inhibition.",

Thus, Mint3 depletion activated AMPK and thereby suppressed the NF-\u03ba B signalling in macrophages. Notably, AMPK\u03b1 protein levels increased after IFV infection in Mint3 \u2212/\u2212 and 2-DG treated WT macrophages, whereas the basal protein levels of AMPK\u03b1 were comparable between WT and Mint3 \u2212/\u2212 macrophages (Fig. 5b,d) . Infectious stress might boost the AMPK signalling by increasing the amount of AMPK\u03b1 protein in macrophages in combination with energy stress. Besides AMPK, HIF-1 also influences cytokine/chemokine transcription directly 41, 42 . Thus, Mint3-mediated HIF-1 activation might also contribute to the cytokine/chemokine production independently from AMPK in macrophages. In addition to AMPK, I\u03ba B\u03b1 was also accumulated in Mint3 \u2212/\u2212 macrophages. Although activated/phosphorylated IKK\u03b1 /\u03b2 levels were comparable, less I\u03ba B\u03b1 was phosphorylated in Mint3 \u2212/\u2212 macrophages than in WT cells after IFV infection. Mint3 activates HIF-1 by suppressing its inhibitor, FIH-1. FIH-1 is an asparaginyl hydroxylase and hydroxylates the \u03b1 subunit of HIF-1 and other molecules including I\u03ba B\u03b1 29 . Although the hydroxylation of I\u03ba B\u03b1 by FIH-1 has not been reported to affect the stability of I\u03ba B\u03b1 in vitro 43 , FIH-1 might influence the phosphorylation state of I\u03ba B\u03b1 in macrophages.",

The lungs were instilled with 1 mL pre-warmed phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, followed by the retrieval of lavage fluid aliquots. Cells in the BAL fluid (BALF) were counted after red blood cell lysis and subjected to flow cytometric analysis. The supernatants of the BALF were subjected to multi cytokine/chemokine expression analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Antigen-specific B cell responses. B cell-mediated humoral responses were measured as virion-specific immunoglobulin production by ELISA, as previously described 51 . Briefly, 96-well ELISA plates (Corning, Corning, NY) were coated with ultrasonicated influenza virion (A/California/07/2009 strain) at 5 \u00d7 10 6 PFU/mL in a carbonate buffer (pH 9.6) and incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Plates were then washed with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (Wako). Serum and BALF collected from mice at day 7 after the secondary infection were serially diluted with PBS/Tween 20 containing 5% skim milk, applied onto the virion-coated plates, and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. After washing, goat anti-mouse total IgG or IgA conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Jackson Immunoresearch, Baltimore Pike, PA) was applied and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. After washing, the plates were stained with a TMB Substrate Set (Biolegend). The reaction was terminated with 1 M H 2 SO 4 (Wako) and the absorbance was measured.",
