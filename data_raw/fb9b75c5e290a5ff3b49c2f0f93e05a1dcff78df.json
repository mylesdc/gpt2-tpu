            "text": "Tollip plays an important role in the interleukin-1 receptor IL-1R and Toll pathways. As a modulator of the immune pathway, it indirectly controls the amount of antimicrobial peptides. This could indicate a vital step in maintaining animal immune systems and preventing infection. Evolutionary questions are crucial to understanding the conservation and functioning of the biochemical pathways like the Tollip-mediated one. Through an analysis of 36 sequences of the Tollip protein from different animal taxa, downloaded from Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databank, we inferred diverse evolutionary parameters, such as molecular selection and structure conservation, by analyzing residue by residue, beyond the canonical parameters to this type of study, as maximum likelihood trees. We found that Tollip presented different trends in its evolving history. In primates, the protein is becoming more unstable, just the opposite is observed in the arthropod group. The most interesting finding was the concentration of positively selected residues at amino terminal ends. Some observed topological incongruences in maximum likelihood trees of complete and curated Tollip data sets could be explained through horizontal transfers, evidenced by recombination detection. These results suggest that there is more to be researched and understood about this protein.",

These data are largely used in bioinformatics, covering various areas such as computer science, mathematics and biological engineering several. Thus it is possible to optimize these studies, in a simple way [3] . The bioinformatic data can be used in phylogenetic analysis, as it is used in most branches of biology, such as phylogenetic trees for paralog genes [4] , population analysis [5] , evolution, epidemiology [6, 7] , and genomic and metagenomic sequence comparison [8] . Protein phylogeny is used to indicate synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions along with the branches in order to identify cases of rapid changes of amino acids [9] . The analysis of different trees allows for the observation of topological incongruences, differences in the formation of taxa, and the relationship between nodes and trees [10, 11] . The complete phylogenetic inference at species level is presented in the Tree of Life (ToL) Web Project. ToL is a collaborative project of hundreds of phylogenetic researchers correlating diverse sources of information, including morphological, physiological, and molecular information.

            "text": "The presence of pathogens in the environment can interfere in the survival and reproduction of individuals in a population, leading to new evolutionary trends [13, 14] . Multicellular organisms have a rapid immune response to pathogens entering, named innate immunity. This response is performed by specialized cells, which have specific receptors for pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) [15, 16] , the most noticeable are Toll-Like Receptors (TLRs) [17] . Tollip (Toll-interacting protein) participates in the signaling pathway of the TLR with an endogenous modulatory role. Tollip has a target N-terminal Myb1 (Tom1) binding domain (TBD), a conserved core domain 2 (C2) and a Cterminal portion of coupling ubiquitin to endoplasmic reticulum degradation (CUE). In resting cells, Tollip controls the activation pathway of Myeloid differentiation primary response gene (88) (MyD88)-dependent NF-kB in two different ways. First, Tollip associates with IL-1R, TLR4 after LPS activation, inhibiting the immune response mediated by TLR [18, 19] . This association requires TLR-TIR domain and intact C-terminal region of Tollip, CUE domain. Second, Tollip binds directly to interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-1 (IRAK-1) by inhibiting an autophosphorylation but without promoting its degradation. Overexpression of Tollip leads to inhibition of TLR2, TLR4, and IL-1R signaling, confirming a modulatory role of Tollip in immune responses [20] [21] [22] [23] .",

First, Tollip protein sequences previously aligned at Clustal W2 [45] were backtranslated at BioEdit [46] package using standard genetic code, to normalize the codon frequencies and bring/make the comparisons more accurate. Once recombination eventually creates mosaic sequences in which evolutionary history at each site may be different. Then, GARD method [47] available in Datamonkey server [48] was also used to search for evidence of phylogenetic incongruences, and to identify the number and location of breakpoints corresponding to recombination events. In order to confirm GARD results, the recombination was assessed using a recombination cost ''delta dirac'' and mutation cost ''Hamming'', implemented in the Recco program [49] . The gap extension cost was fixed to 0.2 and the statistical significance of the analysis was obtained after 1000 permutations. Validation of the previously obtained results was performed with the six methods implemented in the RDP3 program [50] : RDP [51] , GENECONV [52] , BootScan [53] , Maximum Chisquared Test [54] , CHIMAERA [55] and Sister Scan [56] . The analysis was performed with default settings for the detection methods, a Bonferroni corrected P-value cut-off of 0.05, and a requirement that each potential event had to be detected simultaneously by four or more methods.",

Tollip participates in several immune pathways, mediated or not by Myd88 [18, 19] , modulating the responses and the loss or reduction of its affinity to molecular complexes made between it and several other compounds, like IRAK-1 [20] [21] [22] [23] , could trigger an exaggerated response of the immune system, leading to death in some cases. Though, there are studies, like Didierlaurent's [62] , which affirm that mice lacking Tollip become healthy and fertile. Despite all identified polymorphisms and mutations of Tollip, we could not make any inferences about its role in the TLRtriggering activation of dendritic cells, without more in vitro and in vivo tests. Although, some studies [22, 62] have revealed that Tollip does not have a fundamental function in the TLRtriggering activation pathway of dendritic cells. Mutant mice lacking the tollip gene, when compared with wild-type mice, have been shown to not have significant differences. Therefore, mutations in key-residues for Tollip activity does not imply differences at the activation level of dendritic cells.",

The standard deviation of the number of residues in a protein probably reflects a process of tertiary structure \"stabilization\", evidenced by increasing AI values, which were positively correlated (r = 0.366; p = 0.14) with arthropod group. Higher molecular weights showed higher hydrophobicity by AI (p = 20.407; r = 0.007) and GRAVY results showed similar findings, being correlated with AI too (r = 0.671; p = 3.7610 26 ). These aliphatic residues seem to be essential to the evolving process of this protein. The ININ revealed by itself a tendency of accumulation of instabilities in all groups except the arthropods, once a positive correlation of these values was shown between primates group (r = 0.515, p = 0.001) and another negative was shown between arthropods and ININ (r = 20.413; p = 0.006). These tendencies are related with a hydrophobization of the entire molecule, which increase the molecule lifetime, being advantageous for their group due to rapid molecular ratio and molecular turnover [63] [64] [65] .",

The cell environment of superior chordata can be very unstable which enables physiological reactions, with rapid and efficient beginnings and ends.

We tried to identify the pattern of hydrophobic pockets, but it was seen that aliphatic residual apolarity is homogenously distributed along the entire sequence ( Figure 3.A and B) . The main residues, evidenced by conservation ( Figure 2 .A), likely construct the reaction pockets and in the order of the modular characteristics of this protein [66] , the alphahelixes and beta-sheets are domains for binding to specific ligands.

Potential recombinant events identified in Tollip with RDP. (Table 3) . RDP showed the same breaking-points ( Figure 5 ) which comprised the hypothesis that recombinational events generated or could isolate some groups bringing new specific pathways. Some incongruences, as discussed before, could be explained by these events. Owing to a strange pattern of recombination found, the most probable hypothesis to support our findings is the horizontal transfer mediated by viruses or bacteria [68] , that lived in the same environment of the two species, as some donors could not be identified with a high-threshold confidence level, these events could take part of very long and intrinsic evolutionary histories. The molecular clock evaluated with the sequences (Table 4 ) showed that the sequences really presented different evolving patterns, where the sequences have increasing patterns of substitution when the complexity of the organisms become higher. These findings suggested that the Tollip evolutionary pattern is related with successive insertions and deletions that change the protein primary structure in order to bring less stable products; this is explained by the protein turnover that turns higher when the available energy and size of the animal increases [63] [64] [65] .",

The protein domains from amino-terminal ends are under a high positive selection, indicating that these parts of protein are variable and become higher adaptative values with more variability. Several consecutive amino acids presented in the second domain in the sequence a relative conservation, including a tendency to negative selection. These residues are related with the activity of the protein. Indeed, they could participate in the Tollip The molecular clock test was performed by comparing the ML value for the given topology with and without the molecular clock constraints under Poisson model [32] . The null hypothesis of equal evolutionary rate throughout the trees were rejected at a 5% significance level (P,,0.05). The analysis involved 36 amino acid sequences. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated. There were a total of 88 positions in the final dataset. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA5 [24] . doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0097219.t004 protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions, crucial to the right performance on the pathway. The modulatory activity of Tollip is directly related to their association with different intracellular factors, such as other proteins and calcium ions. We have noted that these residues responsible for such interactions suffer broadly neutral to negative selection, which in fact was obviously expected in order to keep their functionality.",

Residue 222 is occupied by A in 52.78% of sequences and is largely distributed in vertebrate sequences (subgroups 1-10), excluding oaa sequences. We found that it suffers a strong positive selection, through Selecton analysis (Fig. 6) , shown as residue 245.

This study also shows an association between minor homozygote of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), named rs5743899, and a trend of reduced levels of Tollip mRNA in comparison with heterozygotes and major homozygotes, driving down the Tollip expression levels regulating cytokine response. Still, another SNP (rs3750920) was associated with increased levels of Tollip mRNA, providing protection to the organism against TB. The hypofunctional Tollip genotype has an association with increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines and increased risk of TB, as well as production of augmented proinflammatory cytokines. However, the assessed SNPs were related to synonymous variations or mutations in non-coding regions, and therefore, our data could not reveal any kind of correlation with that. Shah et al. [71] finds that tollip's effect in murine models are not applicable because tollip behaves differently in humans. There is a need for more research in this area.",

The three dimensional structure analysis revealed the modular characteristic of this protein and the necessity of Ca 2+ to keep the correct pocket of C2 domain. Ligand association studies revealed that 768 ligand probably could inhibit the Tollip activity. Positively selected residues were found in almost all domains, but a considerable part of them are relatively conserved, indicating a conservation of active pockets, which is consistent with maintaining protein right activity. The tested animal groups were differentially grouped, when studied with parsimonious and nonparsimonious residues, and revealed through molecular clock analysis that they present different selection and evolving speeds. The recombination supports diverse incongruences observed in the phylogenetic trees obtained with complete and cured Tollip data sets. There are no evidences that support a homogeneity in this immunologic pathway, once Tollip presented evolving trends that are not constant for all groups.
