Here, we report the recovery and characterization of infectious immunodeficiency-related vaccine-derived rubella viruses (iVDRV) from diagnostic skin biopsies of four patients. Sequence evolution within PID hosts was studied by comparison of the complete genomic sequences of the iVDRVs with the genome of the vaccine virus RA27/3. The degree of divergence of each iVDRV correlated with the duration of persistence indicating continuous intrahost evolution. The evolution rates for synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions were estimated to be 5.7 x 10 \u22123 subs/site/year and 8.9 x 10 \u22124 subs/site/year, respectively. Mutational spectra and signatures indicated a major role for APOBEC cytidine deaminases and a secondary role for ADAR adenosine deaminases in generating diversity of iVDRVs. The distributions of mutations across the genes and 3D hotspots for amino acid substitutions in the E1 glycoprotein identified regions that may be under positive selective pressure. Quasispecies diversity was higher in granulomas than in recovered infectious iVDRVs. Growth properties of iVDRVs were assessed in WI-38 fibroblast cultures. None of the iVDRV isolates showed complete reversion to wild type PLOS Pathogens | https://doi.",

            "text": "Introduction Rubella virus (RV) is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus in the Rubivirus genus, which has been recently moved from the Togaviridae to a new family, Matonaviridae [1] . A total of 13 RV genotypes, which represent 2 clades, have been recognized, but 2 genotypes, 1E and 2B, are currently the most common worldwide. RV replicates at low levels and produces little cytopathology both in vitro and in vivo. A distinct feature of RV is the ability to persist in the placenta and fetus and in immune privileged body sites of immunologically competent individuals [2, 3] . Persistent RV infection is associated with a congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) and a number of less common pathologies such as rubella encephalitis and Fuchs uveitis [4, 5] . The live attenuated vaccine strain, RA27/3 (a virus from the likely extinct 1a genotype and a part of the MMR vaccine), is currently used in the US and globally. It has high immunogenicity, generates long-term immunity after a single dose, is effective in preventing clinical disease, and has a very low rate of adverse events [6] . Worldwide, implementation of rubella vaccination programs has resulted in elimination of rubella and CRS from the Americas and significant reduction in the burden of disease in some developed countries [7] . Similar to wild type RV, RA27/3 can persist in immunologically competent individuals for a limited time causing mild complications, such as transient arthralgia or arthritis in adult women [8] . The vaccine virus involvement in the pathology of Fuchs uveitis is also suspected [5, 9] . The vaccine virus has not been associated with congenital defects, but asymptomatic persistent infections of the fetus have been reported after inadvertent vaccination of unknowingly pregnant women [10] .",

Live vaccines, including rubella vaccine, are contraindicated for individuals with severe antibody deficiency, T-cell deficiencies or innate immune defects because they may cause severe or chronic disease [12] . Unfortunately, PID diagnosis often occurs after vaccination with MMR (usually given at the age of 12-15 months). Nevertheless, adverse outcomes related to MMR vaccination of children who are diagnosed with PID are thought to be rare [13] .",

Prominent T cell deficiencies, often with concurrent antibody deficiencies, are common characteristics of PID patients with RV positive granulomas [17, 19] . Immunohistochemical analysis of granulomatous lesions revealed that M2 macrophages in the center of granulomas most commonly harbored RV antigen [17] .

The RV RNA concentration in both NP swabs was low,~2-4x10 2 copies/ml of the swab sample. Virus culture using 0.5 ml of both samples (~100 RV RNA molecules/flask) was unsuccessful most probably due to the low number of infectious particles in the sample. The ratio of foci forming units (ffu) per RV genome was previously determined to be about 1/40 in both RA27/3 and wtRV-infected cell cultures [21] and was lower in clinical samples. Thus we estimate only 2-3 ffu per flask or less in these two isolation attempts. The presence of RV RNA in the sequential NP samples indicates that viral shedding into a nasopharyngeal cavity can occur. Three sera and one PBMC sample from three patients were all negative by RT-qPCR indicating a lack of viremia.",

The consensus sequences of the full RV genomes in the P1 and P4 stocks were identical showing consensus sequence stability for at least three passages in Vero cells. Phylogenetic analysis of the sequences obtained from primary granuloma samples (including previously described RVs/ Oulu.FIN/22.15/GR (GeneBank#KU958641.1), with full genomes of the WHO RV reference viruses showed that all sequences derived from the patients' samples belong to genotype 1a (Fig 1) . RA27/3 vaccine strain was basal to all sequenced iVDRV. These viruses were somewhat more distantly related to other vaccine strains, which are also genotype 1a. Comparative analysis of six iVDRV RVs and four RVi genomic sequences revealed multiple (from 95 to 292) single nucleotide substitutions compared to the RA27/3 parental virus, many of them nonsynonymous (Fig 2, S1 Table, S1 Data). Amino acid substitutions in the iVDRV proteins were observed at a total 247 positions (S2 Table) . The majority of substitutions (192 out of total 247, 76.5%) were found only in iVDRV strains, whereas the remaining substitutions in 55 amino acid positions (23.5%) were also observed in various wtRV strains and may represent reversions to wtRV. Notably, 142 substitutions (57.5%) occurred at invariant amino acids in wtRV, which circulated worldwide during a period 1961-2012 (S2 Table, S2 and S3  Data) . Thus, the spectrum of amino acid substitutions appears to be different between wtRV, which circulated in normal populations during 1961-2012, and iVDRV persisting in immunodeficient individuals (S2 Table) , but additional studies of cross sectional diversity are needed to further confirm this observation.",

Hence we characterized viral diversity by molecular cloning followed by Sanger sequencing. We selected the granuloma biopsy from the CA case and paired virus stock for the comparison of RV genetic variability in an original clinical sample versus virus isolate because of the largest differences between RVi and RVs consensus sequences: a 6-nt (2-aa) deletion and a total of 85-nt substitutions in RVi relative to RVs, of which 22 were nonsynonymous. The E1 gene fragment was amplified with high fidelity DNA polymerase using total RNA isolated from the granuloma biopsy or from the CA6944 P1 viral stock, cloned and sequenced. In total, 39 RVs and 30 RVi clones were sequenced and analyzed for diversity and complexity. Genetic diversity within quasispecies in the original granuloma specimen (mean and max genetic distance = 0.006 and 0.018) was higher than in the P1 virus stock (mean and max genetic distance = 0.001 and 0.003) (S4 Data). Low complexity was observed in the virus stock (18/30 (60%) identical sequences), whereas iVDRV quasispecies in the granuloma were highly heterogeneous. We found two peaks in the distribution of the pairwise genetic distances between individual quasispecies (Fig 3B, S4 Data) . Within-patient phylogenetic analysis of the quasispecies further confirmed that two distinct iVDRV subpopulations were present in the granuloma lesion ( Fig 3C) . All quasispecies from the virus stock grouped together with only 7 (18%) quasispecies from the lesion in subpopulation 1, which explains the difference between the consensus sequences for RVs and RVi in this case. There was only one synonymous substitution in the quasispecies of the isolate compared to the consensus sequence of quasispecies in the granuloma subpopulation 1. Taken together, these data demonstrate a complex population structure of iVDRV quasispecies in the granuloma lesions with only a small subset of quasispecies being infectious in Vero cell culture.",

The overall trend is a positive linear association between the number of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions and the duration of persistence and, thus, either or both substitution types may be useful as molecular clocks for the determination of the time iVDRV genomes have persisted in patients.

Underlying data can be found in the S4 Data file. c. Neighbor-joining tree (non-rooted) for quasispecies within the granuloma sample (n = 39, blue circles) and virus isolate (n = 30, red circles) from the CA case. The genetic distances were computed using the Maximum Composite Likelihood method. The scale bar indicates the number of base substitutions per site. Since the sequence of vaccine virus and the time of vaccine administration were known, the rate of evolution of iVDRV strains was calculated by direct pairwise comparisons of iVDRV RVs genomic sequences with the sequence of the ancestor, RA27/3 vaccine, using SNAP. The estimated iVDRV evolution rates varied slightly among the patients (S3 Table) with the average dS rate of 5.7 x 10 \u22123 subs/site/year and average dN rate of 8.9 x 10 \u22124 subs/site/year. The dS rates were similar for all genes, while the dN rates differed among the genes. The overall iVDRV evolution rate was estimated to be 1.8 x 10 \u22123 subs/site/year. The consensus genomic sequences and protein sequences of iVDRV from anatomically separated body sites (arm skin and NP cavity) of the LA case were substantially different from each other (Fig 5A) indicating coexistence of different iVDRV lineages in this patient. Phylogenetic tree (Fig 5B) shows the genetic relationships between full genomes of RA27/3 and two lineages, LA-GR and LA-NP. Using the determined dS and dN rates, we estimated that two lineages separated~1.1 years or 1.0 year, respectfully, after MMR.",

To evaluate the selection pressure on individual RV genes, we calculated a dN/dS ratio for each RV gene for each patient (Fig 4B) . Calculation of the dN/dS ratio is one of the means to estimate the presence and direction of selection [23] . Overall, the SP genes were less constrained and more diverged than the NSP genes. Since different functional and structural domains in proteins are often under a different selection pressure and evolve at different rates [24] , we examined evolutionary patterns in the iVDRV proteins by calculating the cumulative behavior of the average dN and dS per codon, moving codon by codon along each gene ( Fig 4C, S5 Data) . The dS curves were similar between the different genes and along the each gene length representing a baseline of mutation fixation because synonymous mutations are largely neutral. The increase in cumulative substitution index, however, differed substantially between the genes and different regions of the same gene. The regions with constant cumulative dN values indicate strong purifying selection and, mostly, define conserved protein domains, e.g. the methyltransferase, ADP-ribose binding and protease domains of the p150 gene and the entire p90 gene encoding RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Glycoprotein E1 is the most conserved among the SP proteins; all domains appear to be under strong negative pressure except the first 100 residues. Similar dN and dS curves in the N-terminal half of the capsid (C) protein suggest neutral evolution in this region, which is responsible for association with genomic RV RNA [25] . The C-terminal part of C protein appears to be under the purifying selection, but the function of this domain is not yet clear. The C protein has been shown to enhance RV replication, interact with a number of cellular proteins and inhibit apoptosis, but specific amino acids/domains involved in those interactions have not been determined [26, 27] . Evolution of most of the E2 protein appears to be neutral since dN and dS curves were similar. Alternatively, E2 protein could be a subject to diversifying and purifying selection. The E2 region between aa 110 and 200, where non-synonymous mutations predominate, could be under positive selection. Unfortunately, functional and structural domains in E2 have not been defined in detail. Infectious vaccine-derived rubella viruses in immunodeficiencies Data). The second major component of the mutation spectrum was U-to-C substitutions. There was smaller number of C-to-U and U-to-C changes in the RV negative strand than in the positive strand (expressed as G-to-A and A-to-G changes in the positive strand in the Fig  6A) . The mutation profile and the strand bias agree with the previously suggested roles of APOBEC (apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like) cytidine deaminases and ADAR (Adenosine Deaminase Acting on RNA) in generating nucleotide diversity in RNA viruses [28] [29] [30] .",

The three dimensional structure of the M33 RV strain E1 has been recently solved [46] . The amino acid sequences of E1 glycoprotein from M33 and RA27/3 strains (both belong to the genotype 1a) are identical. To gain insight into the driving forces of E1 evolution within PID patients, we mapped 39 amino acid substitutions, which occurred in RVs and RVi, onto the spatial structure of a single chain of E1 (Fig 7, S4  Table) . Analysis revealed two \"mutation hotspots\" in the E1 spatial structure, which were defined as clusters of commonly mutated residues in van der Waals contact with one another. The mutation hotspot I involves residues I32, A34, K158, Q351, P415 in the vicinity of the neutralizing epitopes NT1 and NT2. None of the hotspot I substitutions (except Q351) were present in infectious virus isolates suggesting these mutations may be detrimental for RV infectivity in cell culture. The mutation hotspot II, which includes hydrophobic residues I50, V57, F84, V87 and the residue E118, is located near the E1 fusion loops.

A260V substitution in the NT3 epitope and two mutations in the NT4 epitope, S282A and I280T/M, were located in the proposed membrane contact region of E1 in close proximity to the fusion loops [46] . The substitutions in aa position 280 (the NT3 epitope) co-occurred in three iVDRV strains and, thus, might be important for interactions with neutralizing antibody. The spatial location of the NT3 and NT4 epitopes near the fusion loops suggests that antibodies targeting these epitopes may neutralize RV infectivity by interfering with the fusion process thus preventing cell entry. L245V substitution was mapped to the NT2 epitope, which is located in close proximity to the NT1 epitope and similar to the NT1 is not exposed on the surface of the trimer. The neutralization mechanism of antibodies targeting NT2 is mostly likely similar to the mechanism proposed for NT1, which is interference with the formation of E1 trimer, which is a pre-fusion form of E1 [46] . Taken together, these data suggest that granuloma-associated rubella virus is under selective pressure from both neutralizing antibodies and T cells.",

Similar to RV-Dz, iVDRV spread after low MOI infections was reduced compared to RA27/3. The size of foci formed by iVDRV on Vero monolayers were smaller than that of RV-Dz and RA27/3, confirming reduced abilities of iVDRVs to spread in cell culture (Fig 8B) . The efficiencies of cell spread varied depending on the iVDRV isolate with OR5810 being the least efficient. RV RNA replication on the single cell level was assessed using RNA-FISH. WI-38 cells were mock infected or infected with the RV strains at MOI = 5 for two days and then genomic RV RNA was detected by in situ hybridization with a probe set specific for the positive RNA strand ( Fig 8C) . As previously observed in endothelial cells [21] , the total amounts of genomic RV RNA per a cell were substantially higher in RA27/3 than RV-Dz infected WI-38 cells. In iVDRV infected monolayers, most cells produced low quantities of genomic RV RNA, similar to that of RV-Dz, but isolated cells producing somewhat higher levels of cellular RV RNA than RV-Dz were also observed ( Fig 8C) .",

            "text": "One of the key findings of the study is a discovery that all tested granulomas contained infectious iVDRV, which have different biologic properties in tissue culture, compared to the parental vaccine virus. A remarkable feature of the isolated iVDRV is their changes in cytocidal characteristics in tissue culture of cells derived from fibroblasts, presumably an initial target of RA27/3 replication after subcutaneous vaccination. Notably, RA27/3 was cytopathic in fibroblasts whereas wt RV strains were not cytopathic in most cell types tested, including fibroblasts, and establish long-term persistent infections [21, 50] . Unfortunately, no easily available animal model for rubella virus pathology exists and thus extending these tissue culture results will likely require natural history studies in both PID patients and normal individuals Infectious vaccine-derived rubella viruses in immunodeficiencies vaccinated with RA27/3. Changes in tissue tropism of iVDRVs would be a significant observation, especially if evidence of transmission to normal individuals is found. Whole genome sequencing revealed that each of the recovered viruses contained multiple predominantly virus-specific nucleotide and amino acid substitutions with respect to RA27/3, which gives a molecular basis for the differences in their biological properties from each other and vaccine virus. Our estimate of the overall evolutionary rate of iVDRV (1.8 x 10 \u22123 subs/site/ year) based on the whole genome sequences is consistent with evolutionary rates reported for other small RNA viruses [51] and somewhat higher that those reported for wtRV (genotype 1E: 9.16 \u00d7 10 \u22124 -1.04 \u00d7 10 \u22123 subs/site/year) in populations with person-to-person transmission [52] . Higher iVDRV evolution rates may be due to continuous viral replication and selection during chronic infection in a single individual as opposed to intermittent replication and selection during disease outbreaks.",

Many persisting RNA viruses are maintained in a host as quasispecies [53] . High quasispecies complexity allows viruses to quickly adapt to changing conditions within a host and thus represents a challenge for antiviral therapies, e.g. selection of drug-resistant virus variants. Indeed, mutant spectrum complexity could be a factor in predicting disease progression and response to antivirals [54, 55] . Coexistence of two genetically distinct quasispecies subpopulations in the CA patient granuloma and two iVDRV lineages in the NP cavity and skin lesion of the LA patient which we report here suggests that a viral population structure in chronically infected patients could be more complicated than currently appreciated. Distinct lineages at each site of persistence and the lack of viremia indicate that the virus spreads locally by cell-to-cell spread perhaps because circulating virus (viremia) can be effectively neutralized by the high level of RV neutralizing antibodies detected in the patients. Granulomas are often present in multiple body locations in the skin as well in internal organs, e.g. liver, kidney or spleen [18, 19] . It would be interesting to compare virus sequences from multiple granuloma sites in more patients to verify that multiple iVDRV lineages may persist and evolve independently at different body sites and whether recombination between lineages occurs. Such compartmentalization of genetically and possibly antigenically distinct viral subpopulations, which has been reported for a number of viruses including hepatitis C and HIV, may contribute to the maintenance of persistent infections [56, 57] .",

However, our study provides evidence that the cellular factors, one or more tCn-specific APOBECs and ADAR, are the most prominent source of mutations in persisting iVDRV genomes (Fig 6) , increasing genetic diversity and thus participating in iVDRV evolution. Interestingly, high levels of expression of the APOBEC3 genes and APO-BEC3-mediated C-to-U RNA editing activity of a subset of cellular RNAs have been detected in monocytes and macrophages [33, 58] , one of the target cells for RV in granulomas in PID patients [17] . RNA editing by the host ADAR system has been proposed as a factor of evolution of many positive and negative-sense RNA viruses [30, 59] , whereas the ability of APO-BEC3 family members to restrict viral replication has been reported only for four RNA viruses, measles, mumps, respiratory syncytial virus, and coronavirus [60, 61] . Inhibition of viral replication for these 4 viruses was only demonstrated in vitro, in cell cultures overexpressing APOBEC proteins, and was mediated by APOBEC activities other than cytidine deamination. To our knowledge, our report is the first study describing mRNA editing signature of APOBECs in a genome of RNA virus after long-term persistence in vivo. However, more studies are needed to assign RV RNA editing activity to specific members of the APOBEC family.",

Therefore, we expected that persisting iVDRV will undergo sequential genetic bottlenecks when a limited number of founder viruses spreads within a host generating independent virus population at different locations. Linear accumulation of substitutions, both synonymous and nonsynonymous, in iVDRV genomes in different individuals and different body sites over the period of persistence is compatible with the prediction that random genetic drift is the main force driving iVDRV genome evolution, at least during a chronic phase of infection. Another known consequence of genetic drift is an appearance of numerous atypical mutations, which could be the molecular basis of the fitness loss of persisting viruses [55] . Indeed, the majority of amino acid substitutions were specific for iVDRV strains and many of them occurred in the positions that are invariant in wtRV, e.g. mutations in the highly conserved p150 methyltransferase domain and RdRp catalytic domain (S2 Table) .",

The structural proteins were less constrained with E1 being more conserved than C or E2. This is consistent with the data obtained for evolution of wtRV in immunologically competent individuals [52, 62] . We have also identified several possible regions under positive selection (mutated B and T cell epitopes, Table 2 ). Since adaptive evolution of viruses is often strongly coupled with their antigenic evolution, it is reasonable to suggest that the mutations in the predicted B and T-cell epitopes in iVDRV have been positively selected by the combined immune pressure of immunoglobulin therapy and an ongoing cellular and humoral immune response from the patient. Data on poor neutralization of iVDRV strains by some sera from vaccinated individuals further support the hypothesis that the emergence of immune escape variants might be one of the mechanisms of iVDRV persistence. There were, however, discrepancies between the presence of mutations in the E1 neutralizing epitopes and the ability of some iVDRV to avoid neutralization by vaccinees sera. For example, the virus most resistant to neutralization, RI6328, did not have mutations in known E1 epitopes, whereas CA6944 had mutations in 3 out of 4 known epitopes, but was neutralized effectively. It is a likely possibility that not all neutralizing sites in RV have been identified. The number of known CTL epitopes is also small; only three CTL epitopes, all in C protein, have been reported and it is not known to what extent sequence variability in those epitopes can be tolerated [44, 45] . Overall, poor understanding of the antigenic structure of RA27/3 vaccine and wtRV strains hampers investigations of possible mechanisms of iVDRV escape from immune surveillance and its contribution to iVDRV persistence.",

RV neutralization titers (ranging from 40 to 2040) were reported for commercial lots of immunoglobulin produced prior to introduction of rubella vaccine [63] . Determination of RV neutralizing titers in currently produced immunoglobulin preparations, and in sequential serum samples collected at different times after initiation of immunoglobulin therapy, may help to define the contributions of IVIG therapy and a patient's own immune system to the neutralizing capacity of patient sera.

Since only a low level of RV RNA was detected in 2 out of 5 sequential NP samples from one case out of three tested, the risk may be low. The frequency and intensity of virus secretion into the NP cavity as well as transmissibility of these viruses to non-immune contacts should be determined in a larger study group. In the US, an estimated 4000 individuals with PID have granuloma complications and thus may be potential iVDRV carriers [15] . Long-term iVDRV secretion by these individuals may have implications for rubella and CRS elimination programs. Even if iVDRV carriers shed low virus quantities, opportunities to transmit virus to susceptible contacts including non-immune siblings and other patients in PID clinics may occur during decades-long iVDRV persistence.",

A detailed understanding of rubella virus persistence in PID patients will require in part the accumulation of information on the viruses from more patients and from serial samples from individual patients. Unfortunately, the only reliable specimen so far known for iVDRV isolation and sequencing is a skin biopsy. Obtaining sequential skin samples from PID patients, most of them children, over an extended period of time would be challenging and would require human subject oversight appropriate for such a research study. Nonetheless, important conclusions regarding the overall trends of iVDRV evolution within a PID host and properties of persisting iVDRV can be drawn from the analysis of the limited number of diagnostic biopsy samples described here.",

Furthermore, T-cell exhaustion is known to be important for other chronic viral infections [65] . We hypothesize that cellular immune defects delay viral clearance and exacerbate what would be a limited persistent infection in persons with normal immunity, leading to years or decades long infections and resulting in damage to multiple tissues in PID individuals. However, we note that limitations in existing data leave open the possibility that other factors, e.g. changing tissue tropism for the virus or antibody escape mutants, are the crucial factors determining this extended persistence. In addition, since the most important property of rubella viruses, their teratogenic potential, is poorly understood, we cannot accurately predict the effect of mutations found here on teratogenic potential from the tissue culture results presented here.",

There are thousands of persons currently with cutaneous granulomas associated with iVDRVs predicted to be in the United States alone [15] , and the association between RV and granulomatous disease has been established in blinded studies [17] . The median excretion time for prolonged poliovirus in PID is only 1.3 years compared to decades-long RV replication in granuloma.

For example, the genomes of poliovirus and influenza virus are also under purifying selection but selection for and against specific changes is found as well. With poliovirus, the accumulation of mutations and genetic rearrangements likely increases the chances of reversion to neurovirulence, but the strains from immunocompromised persons are still vaccine-like [66] . We report here changes in iVDRV in their cytopathologic characteristics, but the lack of an animal model for rubella virus induced pathology limits further evaluation of the significance of these tissue culture findings, in an experimental setting. For influenza virus, the recent report of parallel evolution of viruses in immunocompromised persons and in global circulation is intriguing [68] , but since iVDRVs are not known to circulate, important parallels with this report are unlikely. We report differences in the mutations in iVDRV and changes in wild type viruses (S2 Table) , but the significance of these differences will require analysis of more sequences. In addition, unfortunately, the molecular surveillance for rubella viruses is far inferior to that for influenza virus or poliovirus, which is also a significant constraint on testing similar parallel evolution of rubella viruses in PID patients.",

Our results strongly indicate the ongoing replication and evolution of the rubella vaccine in PID persons resulted in emergence of iVDRV strains with biological properties distinct from RA27/3. To our knowledge, this is the first study detailing mRNA editing signatures associated with APOBEC enzymes in an RNA virus. Furthermore, we provide evidence that most of the iVDRV genome is under negative selection and random genetic drift is the primary mechanism for the evolutions of iVDRV genomes with positive selection playing a role. These results may provide information useful in designing therapies for PID patients with granulomas associated with rubella vaccine. Finally, persistence of rubella virus occurs in a number of serious diseases, e.g. CRS and Fuchs uveitis, and findings from persistent rubella virus vaccine replication in PIDs may be useful in understanding these rubella virus-associated diseases.",

Quantitative real-time RT-qPCR for rubella, measles and mumps viruses, have been described elsewhere [71] [74] [76] . A detailed description of the full-genome sequencing strategy for rubella virus has been published [62] . Briefly, five overlapping genomic fragments were produced by RT-PCR using primers listed in Table 4 . The PCR fragments were sequenced by the Sanger method. The sequences of genomic ends were determined using the 5'/3' RACE kit as directed by the manufacturer (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). The sequences were named according to the WHO RV naming convention [77] with modifications. The RVs prefix was used for the designation of sequences obtained from total RNA isolated from a clinical sample, while the RVi prefix was used for the designation of sequences obtained from recovered RV isolates; epi week in the name indicated the date of sample collection instead of an onset date; the addition of GR or NP indicated that the sequences originated from granuloma and NP swab, respectively. The sequences were aligned using the Muscle algorithm [78] and alignments were annotated according to the RA27/3 genome using Geneious software version 11.1.2 (Biomatters LTD). Phylogenetic analyses were performed with Mega7 software [79] . The number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (dS) and nonsynonymous substitution per nonsynonymous site (dN), the dN/dS ratios and the average behavior of each codon for synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations were calculated for all pairwise comparisons of iVDRV RVs sequences with the RA27/3 ancestor sequence by the method of Nei and Gojobory [80] using Synonymous Non-synonymous Analysis Program SNAP v2.1.1 [81] (https://www.hiv.lanl.gov/ content/sequence/SNAP/SNAP.html). This program adjusts for multiple hits by using the Jukes-Cantor correction [82] .",

These mutations were used to evaluate enrichment of APOBEC mutation signatures and the prediction scores for ADAR activity. Enrichment with a mutation signature was defined as the fold excess of actual mutation counts in cytosines of the RV plus strand falling into a signature motif divided by the counts expected with random mutagenesis and calculations were described in detail in [37] . Briefly, we calculated the ratio of two ratios, the ratio of the number of mutations in cytosines falling into signature-specific trinucleotide context to the total number of mutated cytosines as well as the ratio of the number of signature specific trinucleotides to the total number of cytosines in the genomic background. For this background, we considered only the areas of 41 nucleotides centered around the mutated base (column \"CONTEXT(+/-20)\" in S1 Data Supplementary table; note that this Table displays bases in DNA format to allow compatibility and comparisons with mutation signature outputs of APOBEC mutagenesis in DNA). This allowed us to minimize possible distortion of enrichment calculations by the influence of local RNA secondary structure on mutagenesis, which could excessively shield some genomic areas from APOBEC because this enzyme cannot deaminate cytosines in double stranded structures. The example of the formula to calculate E uCa , Enrichment (i.e., fold-excess over random expectation) for uCa mutation signature is:",

Unlike the exquisitely specific to single stranded RNA and DNA APOBEC cytidine deaminases, ADARs act on adenines imbedded into double stranded RNA folds, so prediction of ADAR deamination sites should account for combination of knowledge about experimentally defined short nucleotide motifs and a potential to form double stranded structure. The prediction scores for ADAR activity on adenines were generated using the web-based tool Inosine-Predict (http://hci-bio-app.hci.utah.edu:8081/Bass/InosinePredict) and [85] .

The failure to isolate infectious virus in the previously reported case prompted us to modify the culture protocol to enhance virus recovery from biopsy specimens (see Methods). To estimate the number of infected cells in the cultures, cells from each isolation were seeded onto chamber slides after each passage and then immunostained for RV structural proteins E1, E2 and C. Almost all cells were positive in the 14-dpi cultures of CA6499 and RI6318, whereas less than 1% RV-positive cells were detected in the 21-dpi cultures of the LA3331 and OR5810.
