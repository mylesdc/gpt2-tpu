Nevertheless, little information about synonymous codon usage pattern of HAV genome in the process of its evolution is available. In this study, the key genetic determinants of codon usage in HAV were examined. Results: The overall extent of codon usage bias in HAV is high in Picornaviridae. And the patterns of synonymous codon usage are quite different in HAV genomes from different location. The base composition is closely correlated with codon usage bias. Furthermore, the most important determinant that results in such a high codon bias in HAV is mutation pressure rather than natural selection. Conclusions: HAV presents a higher codon usage bias than other members of Picornaviridae. Compositional constraint is a significant element that influences the variation of synonymous codon usage in HAV genome. Besides, mutation pressure is supposed to be the major factor shaping the hyperendemic codon usage pattern of HAV.",

            "text": "Hepatitis A virus (HAV), the causative agent of type A viral hepatitis, is an ancient human virus that was first identified in the stools of infected people in 1973 [1] . HAV is a non-enveloped, single-stranded positive-sence RNA virus which belongs to order Picornavirales, family Picornaviridae, the genus Hepatovirus in virus taxonomy [2] [3] [4] . The genome of HAV is approximately 7500 nucleotide in length and contains a large open-reading frame (ORF) encoding a polyprotein in which the major capsid proteins represent the amino-terminal third, with the remainder of the polyprotein comprising a series of nonstructural proteins required for HAV RNA replication: 2B, 2C, 3A, 3B, 3C pro and 3D pol . Based on the studies of genetics, HAV was proposed to divide into six different genotypes [5] . However, there is only one known serological group of human HAV [6, 7] . Although HAV causes occasional, dramatic disease outbreaks of acute hepatitis with fatal outcomes in otherwise healthy adults as well as isolated severe cases of hepatitis, it has never been associated with chronic liver disease [8] .",

These alternative codons for the same amino acid are termed as synonymous codons. Synonymous mutations tend to occur in the third base position, but the cases can be interchanged without altering the primary sequence of the polypeptide product. Some reports indicate that synonymous codons are not chosen equally both within and between genomes [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . In general, codon usage variation may be the product of natural selection and/or mutation pressure for accurate and efficient translation in various organisms [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . It is well known that codon usage variation is considered as an indicator of the forces shaping genome evolution. In addition, compared with natural selection, mutation pressure plays an important role in synonymous codon usage pattern in some RNA viruses [18, 22, 23] .",

But MBB which isolated from North Africa had a special codon usage pattern contrasting with the other IB strains. All above imply that these strains of HAV isolated from different places, even the same genotype, have different trend in codon usage variation. Interestingly, the pattern of codon usage in vaccine strain H2 change to MBB-like pattern after continuous culturing in a human diploid cell line (KMB17), i.e. H2K5 and H2K20, suggesting that host was an element that could dramatically influence the codon usage pattern.",

There was a complex correlation existing in nucleotide compositions. In detail, A 3 %, C 3 % and G 3 % have a significant negative correlation with C%, U% and A%, respectively. These data suggest that the nucleotide constraint may influence synonymous codon usage. However, A 3 % has non-correlation with U%, and U 3 % has non-correlation with A%, C%, G % and (C+G)%, respectively, which haven't indicated any peculiarity about synonymous codon usage. Furthermore, C 3 % and G 3 % have non-correlation with G% and C% respectively, indicating these data probably don't reflect the true feature of synonymous codon usage as well. Therefore, linear regression analysis was implemented to analyze the correlation between synonymous codon usage bias and nucleotide compositions. Details of correlation analysis between the first two principle axes (\u0192' 1 and \u0192' 2 ) of each HAV genome in COA and nucleotide contents were analyzed (Table 4 ). In surprise, only A 3 % has a significant correlation with both principle axes which represent the major trend in codon usage variation, suggesting that nucleotide A is the major factor influencing the synonymous codon usage pattern of HAV genome. However, interestingly, although the (\u0192' 2 ) value has non-correlation with base nucleotide C and G contents on the third codon position respectively, it is observably related to (C 3 +G 3 )%, suggesting that codon usage patterns in HAV probably be correlated with (C 3 +G 3 )% to a specific extent. Overall, compositional constraint is a factor shaping the pattern of synonymous codon usage in HAV genome.",

Nucleotide U content was the highest, and the ratio of U 3 % was much higher than the other base composition on the third codon position (Table 3) , which interpreted why most of the preferentially used codons are U-ended codons ( Table 2 ). Despite the ratio of U 3 % was the highest, the major compositional constraint, which shaping the synonymous codon usage pattern of HAV genome, was from the percent of nucleotide A on the third codon position (Table 4) . Moreover, two principle axes (\u0192' 1 and \u0192' 2 ) are not correlated with the other base compositions except nucleotide A (Table 4 ). This discovery was different from many reports which suggest that C+G compositional constraints were the major factor influencing codon usage bias in virus genome [18, 29, 30] . Therefore, we supposed that the compositional constraint was from not only C+G contents but also A and/or U contents. In addition, we found that A 3 % has a remarkable correlation with (C+G)% (Table 3) . Hence, we could infer that A 3 % could influence the synonymous codon usage pattern through coordinating the contents of (C+G)%.",

We wished to determine which should be responsible for the extreme codon usage bias in HAV. In the present study, the mutational pressure was determined to be the more important factor for the codon usage bias in HAV, which is shown in Figure 2 , indicating that the codon usage in HAV genome is influenced by the C+G content which is usually assumed to be the result of mutational pressure. Actually, it is previously reported that mutation pressure rather than natural selection is the most important determinant of the codon bias in human RNA viruses [23] . Since mutation rates in RNA viruses are much higher than those in DNA viruses [31] , it is understandable that mutational pressure is the major factor of shaping codon usage pattern in the 21 HAV strains included in our study. Despite this, HAV does not appear to undergo the rapid accumulation of genetic changes seen in many RNA viruses. Because HAV exploits a very low translation rate and a very low replication rate to promote and ensure its survival [26, 32] , it shows a quite low mutation rate than other members of the family Picornaviridae [24, 33] .",

Furthermore, how does it form kinds of trends in codon usage variation among different stains (Shown in Figure 1 ) in the condition of the similar nucleotide contents (Table 2 )? This could be ascribed to the distinct endemicity of HAV, which is speculated from the result of COA. Early comparative studies of the nucleotide sequences of different human HAV strain suggested that sequence correlation could be correlated with the geographical origin of viruses [34, 35] . It is well known that quasispecies dynamics is characterized by continuous generation of variant viral genomes, competition among them, and selection of the fittest mutant distributions in any given environment. As other RNA viruses, HAV exists in vivo as distributions of closely related variant referred to as quasispecies [25, 32] . HAV strains maintained their low rate of accumulating mutations over a long period of time so that it developed specific ecological niches [33] . Because of surviving in different geographical area, different human race and different rounds of replication, the extreme codon usage bias of HAV was established over a long time. Moreover, in the context of a very low mutation rate, the extreme codon usage bias of HAV was conserved so that a distinct endemicity was generated.",

Besides, compositional constraint is another factor influencing the synonymous codon usage in HAV. Although basic knowledge of codon usage patterns of HAV and the factors regulating the synonymous codon usage are demonstrated in our present study, more comprehensive analysis is necessary for revealing the deeper characteristic of synonymous codon usage in HAV genome.",
