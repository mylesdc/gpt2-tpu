Neutrophils transmigrated through our model toward airway fluid from children with lower respiratory viral infections coinfected with bacteria had elevated levels of neutrophil activation markers but paradoxically exhibited an inability to kill bacteria and a defective respiratory burst compared with children without bacterial coinfection. The airway fluid from children with bacterial coinfections had higher levels of neutrophil elastase activity, as well as myeloperoxidase levels compared to children without bacterial coinfection. Neutrophils transmigrated into the aspirate fluid from children with bacterial coinfection showed decreased respiratory burst and killing activity against H. influenzae and S. aureus compared to those transmigrated into the aspirate fluid from children without bacterial coinfection. Use of a novel transmigration model recapitulates this pathological phenotype in vitro that would otherwise be impossible in a patient, opening avenues for future mechanistic and therapeutic research.",

We cannot predict which children will recover quickly versus those who will progress to severe ARDS. No ARDS-specific pharmacological treatments exist, rather treatment is supportive using lung-protective ventilation strategies and the administration of antibiotics for suspected bacterial infection. The study of immune regulation in children is needed because both the lung and immunity are maturing during this critical stage of development and the primary cause of PARDS is direct lung injury due to infection 1,2 .",

Airway neutrophils from adults with ARDS have enhanced survival, a primed respiratory burst response, and increased phagocytic capacity 5 . In patients with pulmonary diseases characterized by chronic bacterial infections, such as cystic fibrosis, airway neutrophils inhibit T-cell function via two pathways -by depletion of arginine following degranulation and activation of Arginase-1 (Arg1), and by activation of the programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1)/programmed death-1 (PD-1) axis, resulting in reduced proliferation and impaired effector functions 6-15 . By contrast, pulmonary environmental influence on immune cell regulation is poorly characterized in PARDS due to the lack of a model system able to recapitulate the airway neutrophil phenotype in severe paediatric lung injury.",

Understanding the biology of neutrophils recruited to the lung during PARDS is crucial for advancing prognostication, risk stratification, and development of novel therapeutic strategies for children who progress to severe PARDS. Herein we hypothesized that markers of degranulation on the surface of airway neutrophils and in the cell-free airway fluid within 24-hours of intubation would be associated with bacterial respiratory co-infection. We used an in vitro model based on blood neutrophil transepithelial migration into the airway fluid of endotracheally intubated children with suspected or confirmed lower airway viral infections at risk for progressing to or with PARDS 16 . We hypothesized that neutrophils recruited to the cell-free airway fluid of children with bacterial coinfections would have a defective respiratory burst and ability to kill bacteria compared to children with no bacterial coinfection.",

Coincubation of neutrophils with pooled Day 1 ASN, without transmigration, for the same duration in serum-free media resulted in stimulation of the respiratory burst with no increase in intensity with addition of fMLF. Neutrophils transmigrated toward ASN was bimodal with a diminished fMLF-stimulated respiratory burst compared with neutrophils transmigrated toward LTB4. Transmigration through the small airway epithelial model primes neutrophils for an increased respiratory burst to fMLF stimulation, similar in intensity to PMA stimulus, compared with blood neutrophils stimulated with GM-CSF (compare Fig. 5A,B) .",

In contrast with this conventional paradigm, the findings presented here support the notion that a large population of neutrophils remains viable and undergo profound changes upon recruitment to the airways of these patients. Viable airway neutrophils demonstrated surface mobilization of multiple sets of granules, and lose surface expression of CD16, a key phagocytic receptor. Furthermore, airway neutrophils increased expression of HLA-DR, typically associated with professional antigen-presenting cells, thus reflecting functional changes. To further investigate this process, we adapted an airway inflammation model developed in our group to study diseases of chronic lung inflammation (CF, asthma, COPD) to acute lung inflammatory processes occurring in children with acute respiratory failure due to lower airway infections. This model allowed www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ for transepithelial recruitment and pathological conditioning of neutrophils by cell-free patient airway fluid and recapitulated cardinal features of airway neutrophils collected from these patients in vivo. In addition, we identified an association between active HNE exocytosis and bacterial coinfections within 24 hours of endotracheal intubation in these patients and observed that neutrophils recruited to the cell-free airway fluid of patients coinfected with bacteria become deficient in their respiratory burst capacity and in their ability to kill bacteria.",

While extracellular HNE can reflect live neutrophil activation and degranulation, in the tracheal aspirate both necrotic and neutrophils releasing neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) may also contribute to increased extracellular levels of HNE, thus precluding the use of extracellular HNE activity as a stringent marker of live neutrophil degranulation. Elevated levels of MMP-9 in the lung epithelial lining fluid of patients with ARDS has also been associated with increased severity of lung injury 34, 35 . Primary granule exocytosis in airway compared to blood neutrophils is evidenced by the increase in CD63 expression in addition to decreases in CD16 and CD35 expression as the latter proteins contain HNE and MMP cleavage sites and may also be removed by membrane reuptake 9, 36 . While CD62L downregulation is expected, CD16 expression is generally increased upon transmigration due to degranulation of secretory vesicles www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ and tertiary granules 37, 38 ; however, CD16 can be downregulated if endocytosed and cleaved by high activity levels of HNE and MMP-9 16, 36 . Secondary granule exocytosis in airway neutrophils is evidenced by an increase in CD66b expression compared to blood neutrophils. Whether this abnormal activation response can be leveraged therapeutically remains unclear. Indeed, HNE inhibitors, such as sivelestat, have failed to improve mortality in ARDS patients likely due to competing proteases, release of other damage-associated molecular pattern molecules and alarmins, and the immunomodulatory effects of neutrophils on T-cells in the airways of ARDS patients 39 . Significant differences in neutrophil activation markers between the blood and airway compartments observed in our patient population is consistent with prior studies 5, 9, 16, 22, 40 . Our results highlight the importance of studying the airway fluid and cells recruited therein, rather than simply inferring airway neutrophil behavior and function based on cells isolated from blood.",

Interestingly, one of the roles assigned to the healthy pulmonary vasculature is to selectively retain primed neutrophils, deprime and release them into the bloodstream 42 . This depriming mechanism may be dysfunctional in ARDS, resulting in release of primed neutrophils into the systemic vasculature that can damage extra-pulmonary organs 42 . Migration of healthy donor neutrophils through our small airway epithelial model primes these neutrophils to undergo a respiratory burst; however, migration to ASN with high NE activity had an attenuated respiratory burst upon fMLF stimulation. The decreased respiratory burst in the presence of HNE-rich ASN from bacterially coinfected patients may serve as rapidly assessed biomarker of bacterial coinfection. The mechanism to explain the poor killing of H. influenzae and S. aureus by neutrophils transmigrated to HNE-rich ASN in our model, which is associated with the clinical outcome of a bacterial coinfection, remains to be explored. An increase in relative Arg1 gene transcript levels has been shown in blood neutrophils from ARDS patients relative to healthy volunteers 5 consistent with our finding of an upregulation in Arg1 surface expression in neutrophils transmigrated to bacterial coinfected ASN. The influence of other immunoregulatory pathways, such as the PD-L1/PD-1 axis, are under investigation as a possible mechanism to explain bacterial coinfection in some children for viral induced respiratory failure.",

            "text": "While our transepithelial neutrophil migration model sets up the possibility for controlled studies of the fate of neutrophils in PARDS patients, we acknowledge several limitations. First, we did not perform full functional analyses on primary airway neutrophils due to limited cellular material from patients. Instead, we used cell surface markers of activation as a proxy to inform how well our transepithelial migration model compared to the changes seen in blood and airway neutrophils from patients. In addition, most of our experimental data comes from the transepithelial migration model which recapitulates the small airways -respiratory generation 8 to 16. The tracheal aspirates from the patients were actually collected from airway generation 1 to 2; however, bronchoalveolar lavage of children is not commonly performed unless needed for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes for severe lung injury. Second, we are limited in our ability to collect blood samples from children with a weight under 6 kg or without a central venous or arterial catheter for blood sampling, which made paired comparisons between blood and airway neutrophils from each patient impossible. Nevertheless, despite our limited numbers of patients, we sampled enough patients to identify significant differences in activation and immunomodulatory markers on neutrophils. Although we previously showed differential neutrophil behavior comparing hypertonic saline-induced sputum cells from CF patients and healthy adults 9,16,22 , we were not able to include controls in this study owing to ethical limitations on obtaining non-clinically indicated airway lavage samples on children intubated for elective surgeries. In addition, children intubated for airway protection, rather than for respiratory failure due to a pulmonary cause, do not have neutrophil-rich airway lavage samples making a direct comparison of cellular material impossible to perform. Instead, we focused on serial blood and airway compartment sampling over time in the PICU to profile how neutrophils change such that each patient may act as their own control in future studies. While children in this study ranged in age from 9 days to 16 years, the majority were under 2 years of age limiting comparisons of neutrophil behavior stratified by age. Finally, patients included in this study were infected with a variety of respiratory viruses and due to limited sample size, we cannot determine the effect of any one virus on airway neutrophil behavior or susceptibility to bacterial coinfection. Despite the infectious heterogeneity of our limited number of samples, we were able to detect a significant neutrophil dysfunction signal in the presence of an activated neutrophil environment.",

In addition, we showed that bacterial coinfections on Day 1 of illness may be predicted using markers of neutrophil granule release, immunomodulatory proteins, and metabolic activities, which may inform antimicrobial treatment of patients. Finally, we showcased a novel in vitro transmigration model to study airway neutrophil function following recruitment to and conditioning by patient cell-free airway fluid, laying critical foundations for future mechanistic and therapeutic studies of airway neutrophils in PARDS.",
