            "text": "Vertebrate interferon-induced transmembrane (IFITM) genes have been demonstrated to have extensive and diverse functions, playing important roles in the evolution of vertebrates. Despite observance of their functionality, the evolutionary dynamics of this gene family are complex and currently unknown. Here, we performed detailed evolutionary analyses to unravel the evolutionary history of the vertebrate IFITM family. A total of 174 IFITM orthologous genes and 112 pseudogenes were identified from 27 vertebrate genome sequences. The vertebrate IFITM family can be divided into immunity-related IFITM (IR-IFITM), IFITM5 and IFITM10 sub-families in phylogeny, implying origins from three different progenitors. In general, vertebrate IFITM genes are located in two loci, one containing the IFITM10 gene, and the other locus containing IFITM5 and various numbers of IR-IFITM genes. Conservation of evolutionary synteny was observed in these IFITM genes. Significant functional divergence was detected among the three IFITM sub-families. No gene duplication or positive selection was found in IFITM5 sub-family, implying the functional conservation of IFITM5 in vertebrate evolution, which is involved in bone formation. No IFITM5 locus was identified in the marmoset genome, suggesting a potential association with the tiny size of this monkey. The IFITM10 sub-family was divided into two groups: aquatic and terrestrial types. Functional divergence was detected between the two groups, and five IFITM10-like genes from frog were dispersed into the two groups. Both gene duplication and positive selection were observed in aquatic vertebrate IFITM10-like genes, indicating that IFITM10 might be associated with the adaptation to aquatic environments. A large number of lineage-and species-specific gene duplications were observed in IR-IFITM sub-family and positive selection was detected in IR-IFITM of primates and rodents. Because primates have experienced a long history of viral infection, such rapid expansion and positive selection suggests that the evolution of primate IR-IFITM genes is associated with broad-spectrum antiviral activity.",

More recently, these genes were identified as novel types of antiviral restriction factors with a wide spectrum of antiviral activity against influenza A viruses (e.g. H1N1 viruses), West Nile virus, dengue virus, filoviruses, HIV-1, HCV, venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and even SARS-coronavirus [8, [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . The main function of IFITM5 is associated with bone development in vertebrates [4, 19, 20] . IFITM6 seems to be involved in macrophage functions in tumor suppression [20] . To date, however, there is no information about the functions of IFITM7 and IFITM10.",

As important virus inhibitors, IFITM1, IFITM2 and IFITM3 may have also undergone a similar co-evolutionary process, such as other antiviral restriction factors do. Despite this connection, relationships between antiviral functions and adaptive evolution in IFITM family have seldom been reported and although previous reports had illustrated the phylogenetic history of IFITM family in some eukaryotic species [2, 30, 31] , there has been no detailed information about IFITM genes in vertebrates. In this study, we performed detailed evolutionary analyses not only to test whether the primate IFITM genes evolved under positive selection throughout primate evolution, but also to unravel the evolutionary history of vertebrate IFITM family.",

The taxa included ten non-mammalian vertebrates (five fishes: stickleback, tetraodon, medaka, fugu, zebrafish; one amphibian: frog; one nonavian reptile: lizard; three birds: chicken, turkey, zebra finch) and 17 mammals covering six primates (human, chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, macaque, marmoset), four glires (mouse, guinea pig, rat, and rabbit), five other mammals (tree shrew, cow, horse, dog and elephant), 1 metatherian (opossum) and 1 prototherian (platypus). We divided the newly identified genes into three types based on the following criteria: (i) functional genes, which contain full-length ORFs with intact CD225 domain and C-terminal TMDs; (ii) putative functional genes, which have CD225 domains but contain incomplete ORFs; and (iii) pseudogenes, which are sequences with pre-mature stop codons.",

By contrast, 134 functional genes were identified from 17 mammalian species, ranging from one in platypus or rabbit to 26 in marmoset. Additionally, 14 putative functional genes including 13 in mammals and one in non-mammalian vertebrates were identified. Among the 10 non-mammalian and 17 mammalian species, 10 and 102 pseudogenes were identified, respectively. Interestingly, among 10 non-mammalian vertebrates, frog has the highest number (six functional genes and eight pseudogenes) of IFITM-related sequences. Among the 17 mammals, marmoset has the highest number (40) of IFITM-related sequences, of which 26 are functional genes.

Because IFITM7 has chromosome location independent from any other IFITM genes, and only mouse and rat have IFITM7 gene, we did not take it into account in this analysis. Orthologous relationships between IFITM family members were well confirmed with conserved syntenies (Fig. 4A ). All these genes are located in one chromosome and form two loci in terrestrial vertebrates, except in cow that has two loci in two different chromosomes. With the exception of IFITM10, that is located at one locus, all other IFITM genes gather together and form a gene-cluster in the other locus. In teleosts (e.g. zebrafish), the two loci are dispersed in two different chromosomes. Although we identified two loci in two scaffolds of frog, whether they are dispersed in two different chromosomes is still unknown. We investigated genes flanking both sides of the two IFITM loci, and found that the two loci have almost completely same flanking genes from lower (e.g. zebrafish) to higher (e.g. human) vertebrate species. These findings suggest that chromosomal fusion might have occurred during the vertebrate evolution from aquatic to terrestrial species. Furthermore, all these IFITM genes have two exons, and the IFITM gene-clusters exhibit consistent gene order in four hominids, two rodents and three birds, supporting the syntenic relationship of IFITM genes.",

A strong signal of positive selection was detected. Eight sites were identified as under positive selection at the level of posterior probability.0.8 (Table 3) . We further constructed the phylogeny of frog IFITM10-related genes and counted the numbers of non-synonymous (n) and synonymous (s) substitutions on each branch (Fig. S6) .

Among 12 pairwise comparisons with significantly higher dN than dS, eight occur between the primate sequences (Fig. 5C) , three between the rodent sequences (Fig. 5D) , and one between cow sequences. Further site-specific analysis detected two positively selected sites (PSS) in the primate IR-IFITM genes and one in the rodent IR-IFITM genes ( Table 3) . No PSS was detected in the primate IFITM1 and IFITM2&3 subgroups. Because positive selection is generally associated with the occurrence of gene duplication [35] , and a large number of gene duplications were observed in the marmoset IR-IFITM genes, we also performed site-specific analysis on marmoset IR-IFITM genes.

All vertebrate IFITM genes are divided into three clades ( Fig. 2A) , implying origins from three progenitors. Clades I, II and III contain IR-IFITM, IFITM5 and IFITM10 genes, respectively. Substantial functional divergences occurred between IR-IFITM, IFITM5 and IFITM10 genes, indicating that IR-IFITM, IFITM5 and IFITM10 experienced individual evolutions. IR-IFITM, IFITM5 and IFITM10 genes are usually located in two loci (Fig. 4) . One locus contains only the IFITM10 gene, and the other locus contains various numbers of IR-IFITM genes with a syntenic location with IFITM5, forming an IFITM genecluster. The two loci can be used as good markers to trace the evolutionary history of IFITM family. They are located in two different chromosomes in lower aquatic vertebrates, and evolved to lie in one chromosome by chromosomal fusion in higher mammals (Fig. 4A) . The syntenic relationship of IR-IFITM genes and the presence of more IR-IFITM genes in mammals than other vertebrates suggest that IR-IFITM gene sub-family experienced a rapid expansion via tandem duplication during evolution from lower vertebrates to mammals.",

IFITM5 is involved in bone formation and considered as a bone-specific modulator of mineralization. The vertebrate IFITM5 genes form an independent clade in IFITM family ( Fig. 2A) . Neither gene duplication nor positive selection was identified in IFITM5 sub-family ( Fig. 6B and Table 3 ), implying the functional conservation of IFITM5 in vertebrate evolution. Interestingly, no IFITM5 gene was found in the genomic data of two primate species, gorilla and marmoset. Gorilla has a close phylogenetic relationship with human and chimpanzee. In human and chimpanzee, IFITM5 is located upstream of the IFITM1-IFITM2-IFITM3 gene-cluster in chromosome 11. IFITM1, IFITM2 and IFITM3 in gorilla are also located in chromosome 11, and form a similar gene-cluster to those of human and chimpanzee (Fig. 4) . Therefore, gorilla is also presumed to have an IFITM5 gene upstream of the IFITM1-IFITM2-IFITM3 gene-cluster. In fact, we found a region with incomplete sequencing at the corresponding locus of human or chimpanzee IFITM5 genes in chromosome 11 of gorilla, explaining why we could not identify IFITM5 gene locus in current gorilla genome dataset. In contrast, marmoset has special IFITM gene organization and experienced rapid gene expansion, thus forming unique species-specific gene cluster (Fig. 3) . Considering that marmoset is one of the smallest monkeys in the world, as well as that IFITM5 plays a crucial role in bone formation [19, 36] , we inferred that marmoset most likely lost its IFITM5 during the long period of evolution. Nevertheless, whether the loss of IFITM5 gene contributes to the tiny size of the marmoset needs to be determined by future studies.",

All various vertebrate IFITM10 genes can be divided into two subgroups, one of which contains IFITM10 from terrestrial vertebrates with frog IFITM10 at the basal position, suggesting that terrestrial vertebrates and frog share a common IFITM10 ancestor. The other one contains IFITM10 from aquatic vertebrates, as well as four frog IFITM10-like genes. Significant signal of functional divergence was observed between the two subgroups (Table 2) , possibly suggesting an association with terrestrial and aquatic environments. In particular, both gene duplication and positive selection can be detected in IFITM10 or IFITM10like genes from the aquatic vertebrates ( Fig. 6D and Table 3 ), indicating that IFITM10 is associated with the adaptation to aquatic environments. There are one IFITM10 gene and four IFITM10-like genes in frog (Fig. 2C ). An episodic adaptive evolution was found on the branch leading to three frog IFITM10like genes (Fig. S6) , supporting the association of IFITM10 with terrestrial and/or aquatic environments. However, what the function of IFITM10 is and how it helps the aquatic vertebrates to adapt to aquatic environments still need to be determined. Distinct from IFITM5 and IFITM10, the IR-IFITM sub-family contains IFITM1, IFITM2, IFITM3, IFITM6, IFITM7, as well as a large number of IFITM-like genes [37, 38] . This sub-family forms a large clade in the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 3) . The IR-IFITM genes from same mammalian species, such as dog, horse, cow, elephant, guinea pig and tree shrew, cluster together and form species-specific IR-IFITM gene sub-clusters (Fig. 3) , in-dicating that gene duplication occurred after the separation of these mammalian species in a species-specific pattern. The same IFITM member from mouse and rat cluster together, indicating that the gene duplication there occurred prior to the separation of the two species in a lineage-specific pattern. The rodent IFITM1, IFITM2 and IFITM3 sub-groups cluster together (Fig. 3) , suggesting a close phylogenetic relationship and similar functions. IFITM6 and IFITM7 are specific for the rodents. The rat and mouse IFITM6 genes cluster together and further group with the guinea pig IR-IFITM gene sub-cluster. Mouse IFITM7 clusters closely with mouse IFITM1 gene and rat IFITM7 clusters closely Evolutionary Dynamics of IFITM Gene Family with rat IFITM3 gene (Fig. 3) , which might indicate IFITM7 has similar functions to IFITM1 or IFITM3.",

IFITM1, IFITM2 and IFITM3 have miscellaneous functions including cell adhesion, antiproliferation, tumor suppression and embryonic development. Apart from these biological functions, human IFITM1, IFITM2 and IFITM3 have a broad-spectrum of antiviral activity, possibly brought on by inhibiting the viral entry processes [14, 18, 39] . In particular, human IFITM3 and IFITM2 appear to have higher antiviral activity than IFITM1 [14] and IFITM3 has been reported to inhibit virus replication in other mammals [40] . These findings suggest that after IFITM1 occurrence, the generation of IFITM2 and IFITM3 might be associated with host defense against various virus infections.",

We detected positive selection acting on marmoset IR-IFITM genes (Table 3) . Macaque and marmoset are susceptible to infection by many contemporary viruses and are often used as suitable non-human primate models for viral infectious disease studies [9, [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] . Cell lines (e.g. kidney cells) from marmoset can be infected by most primate viruses, such as flaviviridae family of viruses (GBV-B), lassa virus, peste des petitis ruminants (PPR) virus and so on [59, 60, 61] . These imply that marmoset and macaque might be able to be infected by the ancestors of contemporary primate viruses and/or some unknown viruses during early evolution of primates. Additionally, relative to pig IFITM3 that has been demonstrated to have an antiviral activity [40] , IFITM1, IFITM2 and IFITM3 genes from macaque and marmoset have higher similarity to human IFITM1, IFITM2 and IFITM3 in sequence and domain organization. These imply that although lacking experimental support, the IR-IFITM genes from macaque and marmoset might have similar antiviral activity to human IFITM1, IFITM2 and IFITM3. Therefore, the rapid expansion of IR-IFITM genes might be ascribed to the infection of marmosets by viruses.",

After deleting the redundancies and merging overlapping sequences, the remained sequences with.150 nt were analyzed by GENSCAN to identify the putative coding sequence. Each candidate IFITM gene was used as a query to BLAST against GenBank non-redundant protein database to make sure the best hit is an IFITM gene. The exons and intron of the remained sequences were detected with GeneWise. The presences of CD225 domain and C-terminal TMD in candidate sequences were identified using the online tools SMART (http://smart.emblheidelberg.de) and SOSUI (http://bp.nuap.nagoya-u.ac.jp/sosui/ ), respectively. If the sequence did not have complete CD225 domain and the C-terminal TMD, or its open reading frame (ORF) was disrupted, this sequence was regarded as a pseudogene. To avoid the possible error in pseudogene identification, the PSEDOPIPE approach (http://pseudofam.pseudogene.org/ pages/main/about.jsf) [63] was further used to confirm identified IFITM pseudogenes. On the other hand, because authentic IFITM proteins are in a range of 102 to 157 amino acids [2] , the candidates that are outside above range and have complete open reading frame, complete CD225 domain and the C-terminal TMD were identified as functional genes and referred to as IFITM-like genes.",

Type I sites represent amino acids conservation in one cluster, but high variability in another, suggesting that these residues have been subjected to different functional constraints. The coefficient of functional divergence, h, ranging from 0 to 1, was used to test the statistical significance of functional divergence that has occurred between different clusters. A null hypothesis of h = 0 indicates that the evolutionary rate is virtually the same between two clusters at each site. When h.0.5, the null hypothesis is considered to be significantly rejected. The important amino acid residues most likely to be responsible for functional divergence were then predicted by calculating the site-specific profile based on posterior analysis for all pairs of clusters with functional divergence.
