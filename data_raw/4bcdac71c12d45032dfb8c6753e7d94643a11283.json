The most effective and economical way to protect against Sudan ebolavirus disease is prophylactic vaccination. However, there are no licensed vaccines to prevent SUDV infections. In this study, a bacterium-like particle (BLP)-based vaccine displaying the extracellular domain of the SUDV glycoprotein (eGP) was developed based on a gram-positive enhancer matrix-protein anchor (GEM-PA) surface display system. Expression of the recombinant GEM-displayed eGP (eGP-PA-GEM) was verified by Western blotting and immunofluorescence assays. The SUDV BLPs (SBLPs), which were mixed with Montanide ISA 201VG plus Poly (I:C) combined adjuvant, could induce high SUDV GP-specific IgG titers of up to 1:40,960 and robust virus-neutralizing antibody titers reached 1:460. The SBLP also elicited T-helper 1 (Th1) and T-helper 2 (Th2) cell-mediated immunity. These data indicate that the SBLP subunit vaccine has the potential to be developed into a promising candidate vaccine against SUDV infections. Viruses 2019, 11, 1149 2 of 15 and receiving unprecedented attention worldwide [4]. Unfortunately, an EVD outbreak occurred again in 2018 in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo and, as of August 2019, a total of 2997 EVD cases had been reported, including 2892 confirmed cases with 1998 deaths (overall case fatality rate of 67%) [5]. Since the first outbreak was reported in 1976, five different species of ebolaviruses, including Ebola virus (EBOV), Sudan virus (SUDV), Reston virus (RESTV), Bundibugyo virus (BDBV), and Ta\u00ef Forest virus (TAFV,) have been identified and their genomic sequences differ by~35-45% [2]",

Multiple vaccines and monoclonal antibodies against EBOV have been developed, but very few of them can effectively prevent and control SUDV infection [8] . Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a safe and efficacious vaccine against SUDV.",

            "text": "The EBOV genome encodes nine structural proteins, including the surface envelope glycoprotein (GP) as the only membrane protein [9] . The mature GP protein forms homotrimers on the surface of infected cells and virions, which is crucial for receptor binding, viral entry, and host immunity induction, making GP an ideal vaccine target [10] . A number of candidate vaccines for EBOV have demonstrated protection against lethal EBOV challenge in animal models and progressed to clinical trials, and most of these vaccines, including DNA vaccines [11], vaccines based on viral vectors, such as recombinant adenovirus [12] and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) [13], and protein-based vaccines, such as virus-like particles (VLPs) [14], have been based on GP. Most notably, a number of the candidate vaccines currently under clinical phase evaluation are viral vector-based vaccines [15, 16] . While recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV)-based and recombinant adenovirus type-5 vector (rAd5)-based EBOV candidate vaccines have been shown to be highly efficacious against EBOV infection and transmission, numerous side effects, such as fever, acute arthritis, and skin lesions, have been reported [15, 17, 18] . In addition, preexisting antibodies, costs, and side effects should also be considered. In contrast, EBOV subunit vaccines may offer a relatively safe alternative for inducing immune responses against an antigen of interest [19, 20] . However, EBOV subunit vaccines would face hurdles related to immunogenicity, thus requiring selection of the antigen delivery vector and an appropriate adjuvant or even adjuvant combinations [15] .",

The GEM-PA surface display system consist of GEM particles based on nonliving and nongenetically modified gram-positive Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis) bacteria and a PA derived from the L. lactis peptidoglycan hydrolase AcmA [22] . Antigens fused with the PA can be anchored effectively and stably to the peptidoglycan of GEM particles and induce antigen-specific immune responses [23] . Furthermore, a vaccine approach based on the GEM-PA surface display system eliminates the risk of including recombinant DNA in the vaccine [24, 25] . As a safe, effective, inexpensive, multifunctional platform with a high loading capacity for protein antigens, the GEM-PA surface display system has been applied to a Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus vaccine [26], a respiratory syncytial virus vaccine, and porcine circovirus type 2 vaccines [25], among others.",

The strategy for designing the eGP-PA fusion protein, in which eGP is fused to the PA with a linker, is shown in Figure 1B . IFA results showed that, compared to control cells, Sf9 cells expressing the eGP-PA fusion protein emitted strong green fluorescence ( Figure 1C ). WB showed that eGP-PA was successfully expressed and present as a 130 KDa protein in supernatants and precipitates after supersonic schizolysis ( Figure 1D ,E). Furthermore, as shown in Figure 1D , the mouse anti-SUDV-GP1 monoclonal antibody only reacted specifically with SBLP. All these results indicated that the recombinant eGP-PA protein reacted with anti-SUDV-GP1 monoclonal antibodies with good antigenicity ( Figure 1C -E). ",

However, some studies have shown that immunization with unadjuvanted GP nanoparticle vaccines by intramuscular (IM) injection induces IgG1 antibodies but not IgG2a antibodies against GP [27, 34, 35] . Therefore, we assumed that this outcome might be related to the presence of GEM particles, which can induce Th1-type immune responses when used as a vaccine adjuvant [36] [37] [38] . This skewing might be the result of an interaction with Toll-like receptor (TLR)-2 by the peptidoglycan present in the GEM particles as TLR-2 activation can shift the immune response toward a Th1-type response [39, 40] . As far as we know, this is the first report that an eGP-based SUDV subunit vaccine can induce a mixed Th1/Th2 immune response without an adjuvant. The importance of a mixed Th1 and Th2 response in mediating protection against lethal EBOV infection has been demonstrated in several reports [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] .",

ISA 201VG, which was developed for commercial products made with water-in-oil-in-water emulsions, can effectively improve immune response and protection [46] . Poly (I:C) has been demonstrated to be a potent adjuvant with the ability to enhance host innate and adaptive immune responses [36, 47, 48] . Immunization of mice with ISA 201VG mixed with Poly (I:C)-adjuvanted SBLP resulted in significant increases in SUDV GP-specific IgG, IgG1, and IgG2a and SUDV pseudotyped virus-neutralizing antibody titers, which are considered to be important correlates of protection [34, 49] . We used the ratio of IgG1 to IgG2a as an indirect method to evaluate induced Th1-and Th2-type biases, respectively, in immune responses. Interestingly, the ratio of IgG2a/IgG1 showed no significant difference between SBLP alone and with an adjuvant. However, in most studies, ISA 201VG and Poly (I:C) adjuvants induced a Th1-polarized immune response [50, 51] . We assumed that the presence of the GEM particles may change this bias. Further investigations are warranted to confirm the immunological adjuvant function of the GEM particles in the SBLP subunit vaccine.",

Our results showed that SBLP resulted in significant increases in the secretion of these cytokines and that these levels also significantly increased in the presence of the ISA 201VG plus Poly (I:C) adjuvant.

Our results clearly demonstrated that SBLP with ISA 201VG plus Poly (I:C) had high immunogenicity and could elicit robust specific humoral and cellular immunity in vaccinated mice. While protective efficacy evaluation of SBLP vaccines in animal models must be performed in a future study, our results strongly support the potential of GEM-PA particles as a display and delivery system for subunit vaccine development. Additionally, efforts are underway to optimize the SBLP primary immune response effect.
