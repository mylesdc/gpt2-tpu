However, reliable laboratory services continue to be limited in many low-and middle-income countries (2, 3) . Although there have been positive examples of laboratory responses to outbreaks (4-6), a number of well-documented events including some at the convergence of human, animal and environmental health have shown how a lack of robust laboratory systems can impede disease detection, control and prevention efforts (7) (8) (9) . These circumstances highlight the importance of building sustainable national health laboratory systems including strong linkages and cooperation between sectors and within the health system. Such systems require laboratory leaders who can lead and manage laboratories under any circumstances including potentially turbulent environments, to advocate for appropriate laboratory diagnostics, and to build strong collaborative networks with relevant sectors at every level of the health system in support of better health for people, animals, and their shared environment (10) .",

The action verbs that describe the levels of proficiency for each area of activity were developed based on the Structure of the Observed Learning Outcome (SOLO) (22) and Bloom's (23) taxonomies. Some modifications of the verbs were incorporated to represent learning outcomes specifically related to leadership.

Each performance activity within the competencies is specified at three levels of proficiency: developing, skilled and expert. The developing level may be utilized when fostering promising future leaders, whereas the skilled and expert levels may be applied by more experienced professionals. The three-step approach to reaching expert proficiency allows for development of programs appropriate to a wide range of countries with step-wise progress as a goal. The competencies also provide a global perspective recognizing that situations and needs vary considerably between countries. The competencies may be applied to variously structured laboratory systems and may be utilized at the system, organizational or facility level for maximum impact. With the rapid advancement of technology, the need for leaders who can navigate in a changing environment and stay informed and up-to-date is paramount. The CF addresses this issue by emphasizing the importance of research and recognizing that technical competencies are subject to change and require regular updates.",

Fostering and mentoring laboratory leaders who understand the need for collaboration between all sectors of health laboratories will allow national health laboratory systems to grow and flourish through communication and coordination of activities. In a world where health events are becoming increasingly complex and can rarely be managed by a single sector alone, this CF was developed to enable leaders to set up multidisciplinary teams to respond to such health events as well as to promote a multidisciplinary vision for the management of laboratories and laboratory systems.",
