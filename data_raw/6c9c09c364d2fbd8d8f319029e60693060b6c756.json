Following two subcutaneous immunizations, goats developed high titers of CpHV-1-specific serum and vaginal IgG and high serum virus neutralization (VN) titers. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) stimulated in vitro with inactivated CpHV-1 produced high levels of soluble IFN-gamma and exhibited high frequencies of IFN-gamma producing cells while soluble IL-4 was undetectable. On the other hand, control goats receiving the inactivated CpHV-1 vaccine without adjuvant produced only low serum antibody responses. A vaginal challenge with virulent CpHV-1 was performed in all vaccinated goats and in na\u00efve goats to assess the efficacy of the two vaccines. Vaginal disease was not detected in goats vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 plus MF59 TM and these animals had undetectable levels of infectious challenge virus in their vaginal washes. Goats vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 in the absence of adjuvant exhibited a less severe disease when compared to na\u00efve goats but shed titers of challenge virus that were similar to those of na\u00efve goats. Detection and quantitation of latent CpHV-1 DNA in sacral ganglia in challenged goats revealed that the inactivated CpHV-1 plus MF59 TM vaccine was able to significantly reduce the latent viral load when compared either to the na\u00efve goats or to the goats vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 in the absence of adjuvant. Thus, a vaccine composed of inactivated CpHV-1 plus MF59 TM as adjuvant was strongly immunogenic and induced effective immunity against vaginal CpHV-1 infection in goats.",

            "text": "Caprine herpesvirus 1 (CpHV-1) is an Alphaherpesvirus [1] responsible for lethal systemic infections in 1-to 2-week-old kids [2, 3] and for mild to subclinical infections in adult goats [4, 5] . Clinical manifestations in adult goats involve the respiratory or the reproductive tract [6] depending on the site of virus entry although CpHV-1 infects preferentially the genital mucosa. Following primary genital infection, the virus replicates in the mucosal epithelium and spreads to sacral ganglia to establish latency [7] . Genital CpHV-1 infections are characterized by painful erythematous-oedematous lesions evolving into vesicles and ulcers healing in two weeks [8] ; balanoposthitis, vaginitis, infertility or abortion are often observed during primary or recurrent infections. Although the CpHV-1 infection is distributed worldwide and major economical losses occur in Mediterranean countries, no vaccines are commercially available. An ideal vaccine against CpHV-1 should prevent primary infection and replication in the vaginal mucosa and should interfere with the establishment of latency; in fact, reactivation of latent virus and mucosal shedding are responsible for CpHV-1 transmission to other animals in the same flock and to newborns. Interestingly, CpHV-1 shares several biological features with human HSV-2, such as, the tropism for the vaginal epithelium, the type of genital lesions and the establishment of latency in sacral ganglia [7, 9, 10] .",

In addition, intranasal vaccination with a live attenuated gE negative Bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1) vaccine was shown to confer partial cross-reactive protection to goats challenged vaginally with CpHV-1 [13] . Collectively, the above studies have suggested that either virus neutralization (VN) activity in serum or CpHV-1-specific vaginal IgA contribute to protection although the precise role played by antibody responses to protection against vaginal CpHV-1 infection needs to be specifically addressed. In addition, the role played by cell-mediated immune responses in controlling CpHV-1 infection and reactivation remains unknown.",

Briefly, 96-well polystyrene plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) were coated with CpHV-1 diluted in carbonate buffer and incubated overnight at 4uC on a shaker. After blocking and washing steps, serial 2-fold dilutions of individual sera or vaginal washes were added to duplicate wells. After incubation overnight at 4uC, plates were washed and HRPconjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG (Bethyl, Montgomery, USA) or HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgA (Bethyl) or HRP-conjugated sheep anti-bovine IgG1 (Bethyl) or HRP-conjugated sheep antibovine IgG2 (Bethyl) were added to the wells and incubated overnight at 4uC. After final washings and addition of ABTS, the colorimetric reaction was measured at 405 nm with an ELISA plate reader (Biorad, Hercules, USA). In vitro IFN-gamma and IL-4 measurements Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from heparinized blood samples using the standard density-gradient separation procedure (Lympholyte, CEDARLANE laboratories Ltd., Burlington, NC, USA) and washed twice with sterile HBSS. PBMC at 2610 6 viable cells/ml were incubated for 5 days at 37uC with 5% CO 2 in complete medium (RPMI 1640 supplemented with 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, 2 mM Lglutamine, 10% heat-inactivated FBS) for determination of cytokine secretion. PBMC cultures were stimulated with inactivated CpHV-1 (10 mg/ml) since previous studies [21] showed that optimal cytokine secretion was induced with that amount of antigen; MDBK cell lysates without virus did not stimulate cytokine secretion thus excluding any cell-specific cytokine response. Cultures left unstimulated served as negative controls. In each experiment, parallel cultures were set up with PBMC isolated from goats: i) vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 only; ii) vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 plus MF59 TM ; iii) na\u00efve. The levels of soluble IL-4 in culture supernatants were measured by using a commercially available ELISA kit (Thermo Scientific) shown to be able to detect caprine IL-4 [21] and the test was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The levels of soluble IFN-gamma in culture supernatants were determined by using a commercially available ELISA kit (Bovigam, Prionics, Victoria, Australia) with a modification since quantification was achieved by using bovine recombinant IFN-gamma (Thermo Scientific) as a standard. The sensitivity of the IL-4 and IFNgamma kits was 5 pg/ml. For the measurement of IFN-gamma spot-forming cells (IFN-gamma SFC) a commercially available ELISPOT kit specific for bovine IFN-gamma and cross-reactive with caprine IFN-gamma [21] was employed and the test was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. In particular, PBMC suspensions were directly cultured onto nitrocellulose-well plates included in the kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA) and IFN-gamma SFC were counted with the aid of a dissecting microscope (Leica MS5, Leica Microsystems Srl, Milan, Italy).",

It is remarkable that, in goats vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 plus MF59 TM , the infectious challenge virus was undetectable by the standard cell-culture test from day 1 to day 14 post challenge (Fig. 4A) and this was probably due to neutralization of the virus (whose genome was detected) by the antigen-specific vaginal antibodies (Fig. 1C) . In addition, the number of CpHV-1 genomes detected on day 1 post challenge in vaginal swabs from goats vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 plus MF59 TM (2.7610 4 62.0610 4 ) was approximately 20-fold lower than that measured in swabs from naive goats (5.7610 5 64.8610 5 ) and approximately 4-fold lower than that measured in goats vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 only (1.1610 5 69.7610 4 ) (Fig. 4B) .

The vaccine-induced immune responses were protective as they reduced the replication of challenge virus in the genital mucosa to undetectable levels and significantly reduced the establishment of latency in sacral ganglia after challenge. Since the latent viral load is the most relevant factor that predicts reactivation rates of animals latently infected with HSV [30, 31] , the present results suggest that vaccination with inactivated CpHV-1 plus MF59 TM could at least influence the rate of recurrent infections thereby reducing the transmission of the infection to other animals in the same flock. To our knowledge this is the first study showing that a similar level of protection against an alphaherpesvirus could be achieved in a natural host by vaccination.",

            "text": "MF59 TM is a detergent-stabilized oil-in-water emulsion consisting of small drops of oil (squalene) surrounded by a monolayer of non-ionic detergents. [14] . MF59 TM is able to increase the immunogenicity of several types of antigens, promotes both antibody and cell-mediated immune responses and has an excellent safety record [14] [15] [16] [17] 32] ; it is indeed licensed for human use in the European Union and it is a component of seasonal and pandemic injectable human flu-vaccines [33] . The adjuvant MF59 TM has been administered, mostly by the intramuscular route, to several animal species (from rodents to non-human primates) though data in ruminants are limited to immunogenicity not to vaccine efficacy [34] . After intramuscular delivery, muscle cells were shown to be targets of MF59 TM [35, 36] , and its adjuvant activity could be associated with the active recruitment of antigen presenting cells to the injection site. The high efficacy of MF59 TM observed in the present study following subcutaneous administration with inactivated CpHV-1 could be due to the crucial role played by epidermal and dermal dendritic cells in priming na\u00efve T cells [37] [38] [39] [40] . In addition, the use of a whole virus as immunogen, rather than single glycoproteins, could have contributed to the observed high efficacy due to the presence of natural TLR ligands in the vaccine. In this regard, human trials have shown that HSV-2 subunit vaccines (containing gB and gD) are unable to confer full protection in humans [41] [42] [43] . However, it should be underlined that although, in the veterinary field, the use of a classical whole inactivated virus as immunogen could be more practical and less expensive than the use of individual antigens, further studies are mandatory in order to identify potential protective CpHV-1 antigens that could be tested for immunogenicity and efficacy in vaccination protocols.",

            "text": "The present study suggests that IgG produced following parenteral immunization of goats could transudate from serum to vaginal secretions contributing to protective immunity against vaginal CpHV-1 infection. The presence of Ag-specific IgG in the preferential site of entry of CpHV-1 would provide a first line of defense against infection that could be further implemented by the physiologic increase in serum transudation which occurs during Figure 6 . Distribution and quantitation of CpHV-1 genomic DNA in sacral ganglia from goats vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 and challenged with virulent CpHV-1. Vaccines were given on day 0 and day 10. All goats were challenged vaginally two weeks following the second vaccination with 4 ml of virulent CpHV-1 suspension (10 5 TCID 50 /50 ml) as described in Materials and Methods. The five pairs of sacral ganglia were excised one month after challenge, the DNA was extracted from individual ganglion to detect and quantitate the number of CpHV-1 genomes by real-time PCR. Data (arithmetic mean 6 SEM) are cumulative from 2 independent experiments i.e., experiment n.3 and experiment n.4, performed as described in Materials and Methods with a total of 6 goats in the na\u00efve group, a total of 6 goats in the inactivated CpHV-1 only vaccinated group and a total of 6 goats in the inactivated CpHV-1 plus MF59 TM vaccinated group. White circles (right ganglia), black circles (left ganglia). A single asterisk (*) denotes probability, p, ,0.05 that the number of CpHV-1 genomes in the second (or in the fifth) pair of ganglia of goats vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 plus MF59 TM was equivalent to that of na\u00efve goats. A double asterisk (**) denotes probability, p, ,0.001 that the number of CpHV-1 genomes in the third (or in fourth) pair of ganglia of goats vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 plus MF59 TM was equivalent to that of na\u00efve goats. Statistical differences were calculated by the one-way ANOVA test followed by the Tukey's post-hoc test. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0034913.g006 the vaginal herpetic infection [44, 45] . On the other hand, CpHV-1-specific serum IgG and VN antibodies could contribute to protection by intercepting the virus escaped from the mucosa. Indeed, it is remarkable that serum antibodies specific to HSV have been shown to: i) neutralize herpesviruses at the axon terminus/synapses; ii) promote intra-axonal neutralization; iii) inhibit axonal spread to epidermal cells [46, 47] . Consistent with the above findings, the inactivated CpHV-1 plus MF59 TM vaccine was able to interfere with the replication of CpHV-1 in the genital mucosa and to significantly reduce the load of latent CpHV-1 in sacral ganglia. Indeed, in some animals (i.e., 4 out of 6) immunized with inactivated CpHV-1 plus MF59 TM , the vaccine was able to reduce the establishment of latency to undetectable levels in all five pairs of sacral ganglia.",

            "text": "Several studies on immunity to HSV-1/HSV-2 vaccines [42, 43, [48] [49] [50] [51] as well as studies on immunity elicited by inactivated whole MCMV vaccines [52] [53] [54] have shown that antigen-specific antibody responses produced after immunization are only able to limit the severity of the disease caused by these herpesviruses and that T cell responses play a major role in controlling primary infection and reactivations. Results from the present study seem to extend this observation also to CpHV-1. Indeed, immune serum antibodies generated following immunization seem to provide only partial protection from genital disease (e.g, as it occurs in goats vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 only), while appear to leave unabated acute viral replication in the genital mucosa thereby allowing the establishment of a latent infection in sacral ganglia. The data reported here suggest that, in goats vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 plus MF59 TM , CpHV-1-specific vaginal IgG and IFN-gamma production are associated with protective immunity against vaginal CpHV-1 infection although the relative contribution of antibody (mucosal and/or systemic) and IFN-gamma production to protection against vaginal CpHV-1 challenge remains to be specifically addressed in future studies. The adjuvant MF59 TM was able to induce high levels of antigen-specific IFN-gamma which is a key soluble mediator in control and resolution of HSV-2 infection [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] . Although, IFN-gamma is a major cytokine produced by T helper 1 lymphocytes and it induces CD8 + CTL, future studies will be necessary to determine the contribution of each PBMC subset (e.g., CD4 + , CD8 + , WC1 + , NK) to IFN-gamma production in goats vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 plus MF59 TM . In addition, the analysis should be expanded to other cytokines and chemokines to test whether other soluble mediators contribute to the protection observed in goats vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 plus MF59 TM .",

The same probability, p, ,0.001 was observed when VN titers (A), serum IgG titers (B) and vaginal IgG titers (C) in goats vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 plus MF59 TM were compared to those of goats vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 only on day 20 post immunization. Statistical differences were calculated by the one-way ANOVA test followed by the Tukey's post-hoc test. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0034913.g001",

All goats were challenged vaginally two weeks following the second vaccination as described in Materials and Methods with 4 ml of virulent CpHV-1 suspension (10 5 TCID 50 /50 ml). Na\u00efve goats were included as unvaccinated controls. Goats were monitored daily for 14 days post-challenge and vaginal swabs were collected daily and employed to quantitate the viral shedding. Titration of the infectious virus in vaginal swabs was achieved by measuring the cytopathic effect of serial dilutions of the sample in MDBK cultures (A) while the number of CpHV-1 genomes in vaginal swabs was measured by real-time PCR (B). Clinical scores were also recorded daily following the possible to exclude that the challenge virus had caused some pathological changes that were not visible upon gross examination of goats.",
