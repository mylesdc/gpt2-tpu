            "text": "A characteristic feature of aggressive malignancy is the overexpression of lactic acid dehydrogenase-(LDH-) A, concomitant to pericellular accumulation of lactate. In a recent high-throughput screening, we identified Rhus chinensis (Mill.) gallnut (RCG) (also known as Galla Chinensis) extract as a potent (IC 50 < 1 g/mL) inhibitor of human LDH-A (hLDH-A). In this study, through bioactivity guided fractionation of the crude extract, the data demonstrate that penta-1,2,3,4,6-O-galloyl--D-glucose (PGG) was a primary constituent responsible for hLDH-A inhibition, present at \u223c9.95 \u00b1 0.34% dry weight. Theoretical molecular docking studies of hLDH-A indicate that PGG acts through competitive binding at the NADH cofactor site, effects confirmed by functional enzyme studies where the IC 50 = 27.32 nM was reversed with increasing concentration of NADH. Moreover, we confirm protein expression of hLDH-A in MDA-231 human breast carcinoma cells and show that PGG was toxic (LC 50 = 94.18 M), parallel to attenuated lactic acid production (IC 50 = 97.81 M). In a 72-hour cell proliferation assay, PGG was found to be a potent cytostatic agent with ability to halt cell division (IC 50 = 1.2 M) relative to paclitaxel (IC 50 < 100 nM). In summary, these findings demonstrate that PGG is a potent hLDH-A inhibitor with significant capacity to halt proliferation of human breast cancer cells.",

While major advances have been made in design of chemotherapy agents, radiation, and surgical procedures, mortality rates remain high. Terminal cancer requires innovative therapeutic approaches, which are currently limited. Traditional use of herbs to treat diverse human illnesses dates back to thousands of years, but in today's society the use of natural product remedies is defined amongst others under the classification of \"complementary and alternative medicines\" (CAMs) [1] [2] [3] . The field of CAM is of global interest, in particular to augment traditional chemotherapies, prevent cancer remission, or serve as basic chemopreventive strategies [4] [5] [6] [7] .",

Rhus chinensis gall (RCG) is the abnormal growth of Rhus chinensis leaves caused by Chinese aphid Schlechtendalia chinensis [8, 9] , also used for decades by indigenous people in the treatment of diarrhea, hemorrhage, and inflammation [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . In a recent study conducted in our laboratory, a high-throughput screening of natural products revealed the extract of RGC to halt the proliferation of human breast cancer cells [7] and inhibit hLDH-A [18] , an enzyme which plays a significant role in driving aggressive malignancies [2, [19] [20] [21] , chemo-and radiotherapy resistance [22, 23] , tumorigenic potential [24] [25] [26] , and metastatic processes [22] . It is believed that the abundance of lactic acid produced and released by tumor cells assists in invasion and motility [27] where a low pH weakens the extracellular stroma which helps tumor cells to dislodge and burrow in the blood and lymphatic systems [28] .",

For some unknown reason, cancer cells inherently thrive in slightly acidic pH, are extremely vulnerable to necrosis as the pH shifts toward alkaline, and will sustain a steady state pH through metabolic inversion or fluctuating dominance between glycolytic-rate substrate level phosphorylation (SLP) and mitochondrial (mt) oxidative phosphorylation to control lactic acid production [50] . If this is the case, then hLDH-A would comprise a vehicle to maintain acidic pH where tumor cells thrive, but the question after much work still remains as to why tumor cells require ample concentrations of acid.",

Its effect in tumor cells baring high expression of hLDH-A resulted in blocking proliferation. Future research will be required to determine in detail cause-effect relationship between hLDH-A inhibition and biochemical metabolic or process related effects in tumor cells.",
