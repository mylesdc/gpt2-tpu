The biosynthetic and metabolic pathways for a core secondary metabolite in L. macranthoides, chlorogenic acid (CGA), have been elucidated in many species. However, the mechanisms of CGA biosynthesis and the related gene regulatory network in L. macranthoides are still not well understood. In this study, CGA content was quantified by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and CGA levels differed significantly among three tissues; specifically, the CGA content in young leaves (YL) was greater than that in young stems (YS), which was greater than that in mature flowers (MF). Transcriptome analysis of L. macranthoides yielded a total of 53,533,014 clean reads (average length 90 bp) and 76,453 unigenes (average length 703 bp). A total of 3,767 unigenes were involved in biosynthesis pathways of secondary metabolites. Of these unigenes, 80 were possibly related to CGA biosynthesis. Furthermore, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened in different tissues including YL, MF and YS. In these tissues, 24 DEGs were found to be associated with CGA biosynthesis, including six phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) genes, six 4-coumarate coenzyme A ligase (4CL) genes, four cinnamate 4-Hydroxylase (C4H) genes, seven hydroxycinnamoyl transferase/hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA quinate transferase HCT/HQT genes and one coumarate 3-hydroxylase (C3H) gene.These results further the understanding of CGA biosynthesis and the related regulatory network in L. macranthoides.",

In the 2010 Chinese Pharmacopoeia, L. macranthoides is registered as \"mountain honeysuckle\" [1] . In light of the preventive and therapeutic role of L. macranthoides in the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS, 2003) and H1N1 (2009) outbreaks in China, the demand for L. macranthoides has dramatically increased. The entire plant of L. macranthoides, and particularly the buds and leaves, is used as medicine. Phenolic acids, flavonoids, volatile oils and saponins are major chemical components of L. macranthoides [2] . These components predominately account for the multiple medicinal effects of L. macranthoides, which include antioxidant [3, 4, 5] , detoxification [6] , anti-inflammatory [7] , anti-cancer [8, 9, 10, 11] , anti-cardiovascular disease and pain relief properties [12] . Moreover, L. macranthoides can be effectively applied in the treatment of H1N1 respiratory syndrome and hand-foot-and-mouth disease [13] . Chlorogenic acid (CGA) is the most interesting of the biologically active ingredients of L. macranthoides.",

The rate-limiting role of HQT in CGA biosynthesis in tomato, coffee, artichoke and other plants [24] has been confirmed by HQT transgenic plants in tomato [20] . Moreover, the HQT gene may be indispensable in CGA synthesis in L. japonica [26] . Three different CGA synthesis pathways have been hypothesized. First, CGA is generated from caffeic acid coenzyme A and quinic acid via catalysis by HQT [20] . Second, CGA is produced from coumaroyl quinic acid mediated by hydroxycinnamoyl CoA shikimate/quinate hydroxycinnamoyl transferase (HCT) [27] . Third, caffeic acid glucosidase serves as an active intermediate [28] . We hypothesized that the key CGA biosynthetic pathways may be different in different species.",

            "text": "L. macranthoides is a relative of L. japonica, and the CGA content in L. macranthoides was twofold higher than of the content in L. japonica [41] . Correspondingly, transcriptome sequencing demonstrated that the number of genes involved in CGA synthesis in L. macranthoides was greater than the number in L. japonica (Table 2 and S3 Table) . There are 10 PAL, 25 4CL, 9 C3H and 29 HCT/HQT genes in L. macranthoides, whereas there are 8 PAL, 21 4CL, 5 C3H and 3 HCT/HQT genes in L. japonica [29] . The phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway involved in CGA biosynthesis (ko00940) was identified using KEGG metabolic pathways. Moreover, candidate metabolic pathways for CGA biosynthesis were identified (Fig 3) . Unlike the commonly recognized three pathways for CGA biosynthesis in Lonicera japonica or other species [29] , only two biosynthesis pathways were identified in L. macranthoides. See panels 1 and 2 of Fig 3. RNA-Seq showed that some of the genes predicted to be involved in CGA synthesis were differentially expressed among YL, YS and MF in L. macranthoides. Using NCBI BLAST alignment, we identified genes encoding key enzymes in the CGA biosynthesis pathway (Fig 4) . These genes included six PAL, six 4CL, four C4H, one C3H and seven HCT/HQT genes. One PAL gene (CL3556.contig5) was down-regulated in YS and MF compared with YL, and three genes (CL3556.contig1, CL3556.contig3 and Unigene21985) were up-regulated. Moreover, the expression levels of CL3556.contig2 and 4 were up-and down-regulated respectively and down-regulated in MF respectively as compared to YL, whereas CL3556.contig2 expression was down-regulated in YS with respect to YL. The six 4CL genes identified by RNA-Seq showed up-regulation in MF in comparison to YL. Compared to YL, except for CL3820.con-tig2, all 4CL genes were up-regulated in YS. Four C4H genes were differentially expressed in the three tissues. With respect to YL, except for CL6280.contig1 showing up-regulation, no obvious change was observed in the other three genes in YS. Furthermore, all four C4H genes were down-regulated in MF. Seven HCT/HQT genes were differentially expressed in different tissues. The other six genes showed significantly lower expression in MF than in YL excepted for Unigene13576. Similarly, the genes including CL7436.contig1, Unigene13202, Uni-gene29578 and Unigene34376 were dramatically down-regulated in YS compared with YL. The expression of one C3H gene (Unigene23258) was down-regulated in MF compared with YL, while it was up-regulated in YS. These DEGs, especially those functioning downstream in the metabolic pathway, may provide valuable clues for elucidating the CGA biosynthesis pathway. Many studies have shown that HCT and HQT are key genes involved in CGA biosynthesis in plants [24, 25, 26] . To further explore the evolutionary relationships of HCT/HQT genes between L. macranthoides and other species, a phylogenetic tree was generated based on seven differentially expressed HCT/HQT genes and 18 sequences obtained from NCBI. Uni-gene32558 was found to share a relatively high sequence homology with the HCT genes in Cynara cardunculus (JF338139.1, DQ104740.1), Platycodon grandiflorus (JN392753.1), Coffea canephora (EF137954.1, EF153930.1) and Coffea Arabica (EF143341.1) (Fig 5) . Similarly, among the seven HCT/HQT unigenes, CL7436.congtig1 is classified into same subcluster with HQT sequences and shares the highest sequence homology with HQT in L. japonica (JF261014.1, GQ847546.1). It is noteworthy that the CL3069.contig1 and Unigene13202 share relatively high sequence homology with the HCT sequences in Pyrus bretschneideri (JQ280304.1) and Camellia sinensis (JQ619537.1), whereas Unigene13576, Unigene29578 and Unigene34376 did not show high sequence homology with HCT/HQT genes in other species.",

The CGA content in L. macranthoides is higher than that in traditional honeysuckle in Northern China (Lonicera japonica) [42] . However, the molecular mechanism underlying CGA biosynthesis in L. macranthoides remains unclear. Several studies have focused on the transcriptome and expression profile of genes related to CGA synthesis in L. japonica [13, 29, 30] . However, few described similar data CGA biosynthesis in L. macranthoides [13, 26] . Moreover, there are no reports on the metabolic pathway and transcriptome underlying the biosynthesis of CGA, a core secondary metabolite in L. macranthoides. We used the Illumina HiSeq\u2122 2000 platform to investigate gene expression profiles and the key pathways for CGA biosynthesis in L. macranthoides. CGA content differs significantly in different tissues of L. macranthoides. The RNA from MF, YS and YL samples of L. macranthoides was mixed in equal amounts for transcriptome sequencing. A total of 76,453 unigenes were obtained. Based on these data, RNA-Seq analysis was performed on the three different tissues and DEGs were identified.",

            "text": "CGA content in Lonicera plants is determined by multiple factors including developmental stage and growth environment [43, 44] , treatment methods [45] and tissues region [46, 47] . Our study found that CGA content varied in different stages of development (data not shown). Moreover, we found significant differences in the CGA content of different tissues of L. macranthoides, which was highest in YL and lowest in MF (Fig 1D) . This result differs from the previous reports that CGA content in the flowers was higher than that in the leaves of L. japonica [13] , which could be due to the differences in the growth environment or the development stage of the collected samples. CGAs are important phenolic acids produced in many plant species via secondary metabolism. Currently, three main pathways, which involve many important enzymes, have been identified in CGA biosynthesis pathways in plants [29] . Studies in L. japonica, coffee, artichoke and other plants have revealed that PAL, C4H and 4CL are the common enzymes in the upstream CGA metabolic pathway [24, 29, 48] . The present study identified two possible pathways for CGA biosynthesis and candidate genes related to CGA biosynthesis in L. macranthoides (Fig 3) . These two pathways were identified in previous studies in L. japonica, coffee, artichoke, tobacco, tomato and other plants [20, 24] . The third pathway, in which caffeoyl glucoside serves as an activated intermediate, has only been reported in sweet potato [49] . And, DEGs related to CGA biosynthesis were identified, including six PAL, four C4H, six C4L, one C3H and seven HQT/HCT genes. Among them, the expression level of a PAL gene (CL3556.contig4) corresponded well with CGA content in different tissues (Fig 1  and Fig 6) . Similarly, its orthologous gene PAL1 (79% identity) in Coffea canephora was identified to be in high expression at the small green stage, which correlated with the high production of CGA during the SG stage [50] . These results indicate the involvement of PAL in CGA accumulation. We also found that the transcripts of three C4H genes (CL11374.contig1, CL11374.contig2 and Unigene36506) were positively correlated with the CGA content, indicating their important role in CGA biosynthesis. On the contrary, a previous study in L. japonica displayed that LjC4H2 is critical gene that regulate CGA content within the organs, not LjC4H1 which showed highest identity to the C4H genes (CL11374.contig1 and CL11374. contig2) in L. macranthoides identified in our study [13] . Besides,the correlations (either positive or negative) between CGA content and gene expressions of the remaining PAL, C4H and 4CL genes in different tissues were very weak (Fig 4) . These unigenes in the upstream of CGA biosynthesis pathways may be shared by the phenylpropanoid pathway and other metabolic pathways [29] and are not the key rate-limiting enzymes in L. macranthoides [23] . It is also likely that different homologous genes encoding the same enzyme may differ in function. Future transgenic experiments targeting each transcript may further explore the key genes involved in CGA biosynthesis in L. macranthoides.",

The role of HCT in CGA biosynthesis has been demonstrated in tobacco, tomato [20] and artichoke [48, 52] . However, HQT is only involved in CGA biosynthesis. Two isoforms of HQT, HQT1 and HQT2, contribute to CGA synthesis in artichoke [24] . In the present study, 7 unigenes encoding HQT/HCT showed organ-differential expression, and the transcripts of 6 HQT/HCT genes were correlated with CGA content in different tissues (Fig 4) , suggesting their key roles in CGA biosynthesis in L. macranthoides. Among them, uni-gene32558 shares a relatively high sequence homology with the HCT genes in artichoke and coffee (Fig 5) , which were considered to be involved in the synthesis of CGA [48, 52, 53] . CL7436.congtig1 shares the highest homology with the HQT gene in L. japonica (Fig 5) . However, it's a controversial issue about the role of this gene in CGA biosynthesis. Peng et al. [26] showed that tissue distribution of HQT was in accordance with the pattern of CGA content, indicating its essential role in CGA biosynthesis. Whereas, Yuan et al. [13] found that LjHQTs did not show significant organ preferential expression and may not be the critical genes regulating CGA content. And our results strongly support the forward view. In addition, CL3069. contig1 and Unigene13202 share relatively high sequence similarity with HCT/HQT of some species and are thus candidate HCT/HQT genes (Fig 5) .

Transcriptome analysis revealed that 3767 unigenes classified into 33 pathways are involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. These data provide genomic resources for further study of the molecular mechanism of secondary metabolism in L. macranthoides. Furthermore, we identified 447 genes associated with pathways for phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, and we found two candidate pathways for CGA biosynthesis in L. macranthoides. Several genes, including one PAL, three C4H and four HCT/HQT genes, showed correlation with CGA content, suggesting their key role in CGA biosynthesis.These results characterize a potential molecular regulatory mechanism for CGA biosynthesis, and in doing so provide a wealth of candidate genes for future studies to engineer improvement of L. macranthoides.
