BLI is an optical analytical technique that measures interference patterns from white light reflected by two surfaces at the tip of a disposable biosensor: (1) a proprietary reference surface (constant) and (2) a sample or chemistry surface (variable). It monitors in real time the interaction between two different molecules with one-the ligand-immobilized onto the biosensor surface, while the other-the analyte-is kept in solution. Biosensors are coated with and are covalently or non-covalently linked with different biological molecules that allow for kinetics or quantitation measurements of the molecules bound to the tip [2, 3] .",

Such information is necessary when characterizing and studying molecular interactions and is important for complementing other technologies when providing functional information of a molecule. In a typical BLI binding kinetics experiment, the assay begins with an initial baseline using an assay buffer, followed by a ligand molecule immobilization on the surface of the biosensor (loading), followed by another baseline step and association or analyte binding step, then finalized with dissociation in the presence of buffer only. The binding response is measured and reported in real time in the form of a sensorgram trace, which is then fitted using specified algorithms based on known binding models [2] . Kinetics measures how fast an interaction occurs and is depicted by the relationship between association rate constant (k a ) and dissociation rate constant (k d ). These constants are expressed as k a , M \u22121 s \u22121 and k d , s \u22121 . Affinity measures how strong the interaction is and is depicted when binding reaches an equilibrium. It is usually referred as affinity constant (K D ) or dissociation equilibrium constant, which is expressed in molar as the concentration of analyte required to occupy 50% of the surface ligand sites at equilibrium. These constants are readily calculated during software data analysis. For quantitation experiments, the molecule(s) bound to the biosensor are quantified in relation to a set of standards of similar characteristics. Software algorithms based on known curve equations deliver quantitation and CV% information [2, 3] .",

In addition, techniques such as ELISA and SRID can exhibit high variability, resulting in lower accuracy and poor precision.

Since large-scale vaccination efforts against smallpox ended, the general population may no longer be protected against orthopoxviruses, which include monkeypox virus and various strains of cowpox viruses. BLI technology is being used as a tool to help in the search of cross-species neutralizers and to help with vaccine design and development against the vaccinia virus. A well-orchestrated BLI strategy is summarized and illustrated on Figure 1 , in which the authors studied the L1 epitopes to understand the protective mechanism of the anti-L1 antibody, as the L1 antibody is an important target for viral neutralization [6] . L1 residues N27, Q31, and D35 were subjected to single-alanine substitution using site-directed mutagenesis, and the mutated recombinant L1 proteins were immobilized onto Ni-NTA biosensors via its C-terminal hexahistamine tag, and anti-L1 mAbs used as analyte. By measuring the affinity constant (K D ), association rate constant (k a ) and dissociation rate constant (k d ) using 1:1 binding model, the authors compared the binding kinetics of WT-L1 (wild type), N27A, Q31A, and D35A against mAbs [6] . As a result, they found no binding of D35A against M12B9-Fabs, while no significant difference was observed between wild type and N27A and Q31A (Figure 1, table) . No significant effect on binding affinity was observed with other L1 mAbs studied. These results show that M12B9 binds with L1 protein with high affinity, but a single D35A substitution in L1 abolishes the binding, which proves that D35 side chain is essential for binding a group of potent neutralizing antibodies.",

In the following example, BLI was used to test HCV epitope scaffolds' affinity to neutralizing antibodies. Contrary to smallpox, there are no vaccines against hepatitis C virus (HCV). The development of a prophylactic vaccine against HCV has been hindered due to the great diversity in the viral structure and host immune response. He et al. [10] designed HCV epitope scaffolds from the antigenic sites of glycoproteins E1 and E2. The authors searched and filtered potential scaffolds using a matrix meta-server method composed of six different databases: TM-align(F), TM-align(C), SPalign, CLICK, FAST, and Mammoth. Then, the authors used MD simulations to study the dynamics of potential epitope scaffolds in solution. The selected epitope scaffolds were his-tagged, transiently expressed in cells, purified, and their affinities tested on an BLI Octet instrument. Such multi-scale scaffolding is promising for such complex pathogen-host interactions. Structural modeling and computational designs can be tested experimentally for activity and affinity using the different platforms of BLI, transforming theory into reality. In their research, the authors used a BLI instrument-an Octet RED96-to show binding affinity between HCV epitope scaffolds to the neutralizing antibodies, which helped to characterize and select most efficient scaffolds ( Figure 2 ) [10] .",

The use of label-free biosensors like BLI and SPR for the biochemical characterization of epitope scaffolds has contributed to several case studies reported for influenza [11] , RSV [12] , and HIV [13] . Biosensor technologies provide affinity and kinetics binding information that is crucial for characterization studies. Like SPR, BLI can provide the on and off rate constants of antibody binding to the antigen by fitting a model function to the binding data, therefore providing the affinity of the interaction. ",

Diagram depicts biotinylated MrkA antigen immobilized on a streptavidin (SA) biosensor and exposed to competing antibody clones, which interact with corresponding epitopes. Sensorgram, adapted from Wang et al. 2017 [14] with permission, shows binding curve of different clones; buffer and clone 4 (binding site not available) are controls. This strategy shows use for finding anti-MrkA antibodies that have strong affinity for the MrkA epitope. BLI Octet instruments are accepted as a complimentary tool for epitope binning because of their versatility as they enable the parallel analysis of 96 independent analyte/ligand pairs [15] . Biosensor platforms can assist with different types of binning assay formats-in-tandem, premix, and classical sandwich epitope binning-due to their label-free, real-time capabilities. Usually, classical sandwich and in-tandem formats are used for crude monoclonal antibody (mAb) supernatants, while premix assays are used with purified mAbs for quantitation assays [16, 17] . BLI works with all the binning formats. For crude samples, SPR and SPRi technologies are not ideal because the more complex samples can cause clogs and blockages on the microfluidics systems [18] . BLI also offers many advantages over traditional technologies such as ELISA for epitope binning because it provides real-time information and label-free experimental design. ELISA, on the other hand, may distort molecule conformation, miss information on low affinity antibody pairs, and limit the ability to troubleshoot the assay due to its limited end-point, label-dependent technology [19] . In the example described above, ELISA is useful as a complementary technology and can be used in combination with BLI and other technologies. Although difficult to use for in-tandem assays, ELISA is traditionally used for sandwich and premix assays.",

For example, Bruno [34] noticed that when they used long (200 base pair) aptamers for binding to peptide based biomarkers, the aptamer contracted, resulting into a smaller molecule that exhibited negative response signals upon binding to the peptide. Friedman et al. [35] found BLI to be invaluable for the characterization of aptamer pool enrichment, which is traditionally accessed by radio-labeling aptamers with either ATP [\u03b1 \u2212 32 P] for in vitro transcription or ATP [\u03b3 \u2212 32 P] for 5 end labeling. The authors found that radiolabeling disrupted aptamer function, while the RT-LF BLI biosensor technology provided fast high-throughput and reliable affinity information that could be tested in parallel for comparison of samples from different selection rounds [35] . In addition, radiolabeling is a cumbersome technique that requires careful manipulation and extra waste disposal costs. Aptamers are useful for vaccine and immunotherapeutic initiatives because highly specific aptamers can bind to viral proteins to inhibit or block fusion, penetration, or replication [34, 36] .",
