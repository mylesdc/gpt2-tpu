            "text": "The Plasmodium falciparum cysteine proteases falcipain-2 and falcipain-3 degrade host hemoglobin to provide free amino acids for parasite protein synthesis. Hemoglobin hydrolysis has been described as an ordered process initiated by aspartic proteases, but cysteine protease inhibitors completely block the process, suggesting that cysteine proteases can also initiate hemoglobin hydrolysis. To characterize the specific roles of falcipains, we used three approaches. First, using random P 1 -P 4 amino acid substrate libraries, falcipain-2 and falcipain-3 demonstrated strong preference for cleavage sites with Leu at the P 2 position. Second, with overlapping peptides spanning a and b globin and proteolysis-dependent 18 O labeling, hydrolysis was seen at many cleavage sites. Third, with intact hemoglobin, numerous cleavage products were identified. Our results suggest that hemoglobin hydrolysis by malaria parasites is not a highly ordered process, but rather proceeds with rapid cleavage by falcipains at multiple sites. However, falcipain-2 and falcipain-3 show strong specificity for P 2 Leu in small peptide substrates, in agreement with the specificity in optimized small molecule inhibitors that was identified previously. These results are consistent with a principal role of falcipain-2 and falcipain-3 in the hydrolysis of hemoglobin by P. falciparum and with the possibility of developing small molecule inhibitors with optimized specificity as antimalarial agents.

Among impediments to effective control of this disease is increasing resistance to most available drugs [3] . New artemisinin-based combination therapies offer excellent efficacy, but resistance to most artemisinin partner drugs has already been seen [4] , and resistance to artemisinins may be emerging [5] . The pipeline for development of other classes of effective antimalarials, especially compounds that act against novel biochemical targets, is limited. To facilitate development of such compounds, it is important to characterize the biochemical features and biological roles of new drug targets.",

            "text": "Falcipain-2 and falcipain-3 are papain-family cysteine proteases of P. falciparum that are currently the subjects of in-depth drug discovery efforts [6] . These proteases are expressed sequentially across the life cycle of erythrocytic parasites, with expression of falcipain-2 beginning in early trophozoites followed by expression of falcipain-3 in late trophozoites and schizonts [7] . The proteases are hemoglobinases that reside in the food vacuole of intraerythrocytic parasites, where they degrade hemoglobin, in concert with other proteases [8] , to provide the parasite with amino acids for growth and development [9] . Treatment of erythrocytic parasites with cysteine protease inhibitors or disruption of the falcipain-2 gene results in accumulation of undegraded hemoglobin in the food vacuole, confirming a role for this enzyme in hemoglobin hydrolysis [6, 10] . Disruption of the falcipain-3 gene could not be achieved, but the gene was readily replaced with a tagged functional copy, indicating that falcipain-3 is essential for survival of intraerythrocytic parasites [11] . These results support studies of falcipain inhibitors as new antimalarial agents.",

In brief, urea solubilized inclusion bodies from bacteria over-expressing the mature domains of either falcipain-2 or falcipain-3 fused to a 66HIS tag were purified by ultra-filtration and bound to Nickel-Nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) columns. After several washes with buffer containing 8 M urea and 10-60 mM imidazole, bound protein was eluted sequentially with 500 mM and 1 M imidazole in the presence of urea. Refolding of falcipain-2 was achieved by diluting the eluates 100fold in 100 mM Tris-HCl, 30% glycerol, 250 mM arginine, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM reduced-glutathione (GSH), 1 mM oxidizedglutathione (GSSG), pH 9.2 and incubating at 4uC overnight. Refolding of falcipain-3 was achieved by diluting the eluates 100fold in 100 mM Tris-HCl, 15% sucrose, 250 mM arginine, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM GSH, 1 mM GSSG, pH 9.2 and incubating at 4uC overnight. The refolded proteins were concentrated 50-fold, run over a Q-Sepharose column, and eluted with a gradient of NaCl starting at 500 mM. Eluates were examined by SDS-PAGE and for activity against the synthetic substrate, Z-Leu-Arg-AMC (benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Arg-7-amino-4-methyl-coumarin). Fractions with highest enzyme activity were pooled and concentrated using a 10 KDa cut-off ultra-filtration column (Amicon). Enzymes were stored in 50% glycerol at 280uC.",

To best distinguish falcipain cleavage products from minor fragments contaminating synthetic peptides, the proteases and peptide substrates were incubated with 50% H 2 18 O. With proteolytic cleavage, the C-terminal ends of the newly generated peptides, but not false products, bore 18 O either by enzyme catalysis or isotope exchange [19, 20] . Peptides were incubated with falcipain-2 or falcipain-3 for varied intervals, and reaction products were assessed by MALDI-TOF MS/MS analysis. We used stringent criteria to distinguish newly generated peptides from false positive and ambiguous products, based on ratios of labeled to unlabeled peptides and frequencies of appearance at several time points. Multiple cleavage sites were identified for both falcipains (Fig. 2a-d, top arrows) . Considering the sequences most preferred in our positional scanning library analysis, cleavages by falcipain-2 were seen at 25 of 36 positions with P 2 Leu and by falcipain-3 at 22 of 36 such positions. Analysis of the step-wise hydrolysis of peptides over time yielded a complex picture for both a and b globin and either falcipain-2 or falcipain-3 (Fig. 3) . Identification of the most common amino acids at cleavage sites was, of course, influenced by the prevalence of different residues in hemoglobin. At the P 2 position, Leu was most common, but cleavages of peptides with P 2 Val and other amino acids were also well represented (Fig. 4) . A more thorough analysis of cleavage for each amino acid at each P 1-4 position is in supplementary material (Table S1; Figure S1 ). These experiments also showed that the most preferred P 1 9 amino acids were Ala and Leu. However, this preference was modest, with cleavages demonstrated at sites with multiple different prime-side amino acids. At the P 2 9 position Ala was slightly preferred. There was no particular amino acid preference at the P 3 9 or P 4 9 position.",

Rather, we identified over a hundred peptides of molecular weight 9 kDa or less after 5 minute incubations of human hemoglobin with falcipain-2 or falcipain-3 (data not shown). For simplicity, we therefore concentrated on identification of hemoglobin cleavage fragments after an extended incubation with falcipain-2 or falcipain-3. Reactions were performed after incubation of hemoglobin with 50% H 2 18 O, and the identities of hemoglobin cleavage fragments were characterized by LC-MS/MS. Data were filtered based on 18 O incorporation, as described above for analysis of peptide hydrolysis. We then mapped cleavage sites on (Fig. 2a-d, bottom arrows) . Cleavage sites were identified in both the loops (blue color) and helices (red color) of human globin, with no particular preference for buried or exposed cleavage sites on the hemoglobin tertiary structure (Fig. 2e) . Of note, the data obtained for falcipain-2 were nearly identical to those for falcipain-3 for hydrolysis of hemoglobin and were very similar to those for hydrolysis of globin peptides by both proteases.",

However, characterization of a specific pathway for hemoglobin hydrolysis by falcipain-2 and falcipain-3 has been difficult. We now present a detailed analysis of hydrolysis of short peptide substrates, 12-mer peptides encompassing a and b globin, and intact human hemoglobin by falcipain-2 and falcipain-3. We show that the proteases have distinct specificity for short peptide substrates with Leu at the P 2 position, but that against larger substrates specificity is less marked. Indeed, the proteases rapidly cleaved globin peptides and intact hemoglobin at multiple different sequences. These results suggest that falcipain-2 and falcipain-3 do not cleave host hemoglobin via an ordered process, but rather that the proteases efficiently cleave the substrate by rapid hydrolysis at many different sites on the protein.",

Although this methodology is most useful for highly selective enzymes, valuable information can also be extracted from substrate profiles with enzymes that are quite promiscuous, as in the case of the falcipains and other papain family cysteine proteases [21] .

Hydrophobic amino acids at P 2 were strongly preferered by falcipain-2 and falcipain-3, as seen with many other papain-family proteases [21] .

Other papain-family proteases not included in the prior survey appear to show a stronger preference for P 2 Leu, notably the human proteases cathepsin K and cathepsin S [21] . As discussed in more detail below, we found that the striking preference for P 2 Leu in small substrates did not predict specificity only for cleavage sites with P 2 Leu in larger peptide or protein substrates. Nonetheless, this specificity has been seen also in small molecule inhibitors of falcipain-2 and falcipain-3; inhibitors with either Phe or Leu at P 2 were effective, but typically activity improved ,10-fold for fluoromethyl ketones, vinyl sulfones, and aldehydes with P 2 Leu [23,38,39]. Thus, although of limited utility in discriminating activity against native protein substrates, the elaboration of enzyme specificity using tetrapeptide scanning libraries provided accurate prediction of optimal small molecule inhibitors. Appreciation of the fine specificity of inhibition of falcipains is contributing to drug discovery efforts directed against these proteases [6] .",

            "text": "Ordered pathways for the hydrolysis of hemoglobin have been demonstrated in studies with isolated aspartic proteases from two parasites that hydrolyze this substrate, schistosome worms that degrade hemoglobin extracellularly [44] and malaria parasites that degrade hemoglobin in an intracellular acidic organelle [12] . However, prior attempts to map out pathways of hemoglobin hydrolysis for cysteine proteases of schistosomes or malaria parasites have been unsuccessful due to an inability to identify the ordered generation of cleavage fragments (Shenai BR, Sajid M, and Rosenthal PJ, unpublished observations). A key goal of the present study was to more rigorously test the hypothesis that falcipain-2 and falcipain-3 indeed hydrolyze hemoglobin through an ordered pathway of cleavage events and, in any event, to identify globin peptide and hemoglobin cleavage fragments after incubation with falcipains. Despite rigorous filtering to identify only bona fide cleavage fragments, we found that falcipain-2 and falcipain-3 cleaved hemoglobin simultaneously (within our limits of analysis) at many sites. Thus, the enzymes appear to degrade hemoglobin not via an ordered hydrolytic pathway, but through rapid hydrolysis of multiple sites. This result is consistent with known features of other papain-family cysteine proteases, which also have quite broad specificity against protein substrates [21] . Indeed, the prototype enzyme papain is used in a number of industrial applications that take advantage of its broad substrate specificity. Lysosomal cysteine proteases similarly demonstrate broad specificity, and appear to be responsible for extensive proteolytic activity in this organelle [21] . In malaria parasites, where the food vacuole appears to serve as the homolog of the lysosome, and where hemoglobin appears to be the primary proteolytic substrate [12] , it seems likely that falcipain-2 and falcipain-3 are responsible for the bulk of cleavages that reduce hemoglobin from a complex tetramer to single amino acids. Additional proteases, notably plasmepsin I-IV [12, 45] , dipeptidyl aminopeptidase I [46, 47] and falcilysin [48, 49] , also appear to contribute to the efficient hydrolysis of hemoglobin in the food vacuole, and the presence of multiple proteases of multiple classes suggests a degree of redundancy in this process [9] . Despite the presence of multiple proteases in the food vacuole, it is noteworthy that treatment of cultured parasites with specific inhibitors of cysteine proteases fully blocked the hydrolysis of hemoglobin, highlighting the key role for the falcipains in this process [22] .",

This feature of the falcipains likely facilitates particularly efficient hydrolysis of hemoglobin and may contribute to the ability of the proteases to cleave hemoglobin at multiple sites. However, it is difficult to predict interaction between the protease and substrate based on known structures [28, 29] , as once initial cleavages of hemoglobin take place, the structure of hemoglobin will be altered, and multiple peptide bonds will presumably be accessible to cleavage by the falcipains.",

This analysis identified a series of hemoglobin cleavage fragments, with cleavage sites at mean intervals of 8.4 amino acids. Comparison of identified cleavage sites from the prior analysis of food vacuole extracts with our analysis of cleavage by recombinant falcipains identified many shared cleavage sites, but also cleavages identified only after incubation with food vacuole extract or only after incubation with recombinant falcipains. Specifically, only 15 of 37 cleavages identified in the prior study after incubation with food vacuole extracts were seen after incubation with falcipain-2 or falcipain-3. Therefore, some hemoglobin cleavages appeared to be generated uniquely by proteases other than the falcipains. However, considering both our globin peptides and intact hemoglobin results, we observed over 100 different cleavage sites within hemoglobin, with 90 of these not seen after incubation with food vacuole extract. Some falcipain activity may have been missed in studies of vacuole extracts due to chosen assay conditions, the presence of enzyme inhibitors in extracts, or loss of enzymes during sample preparation.

            "text": "Our study has important limitations. First, the precise analysis of cleavage of globin peptides or hemoglobin by falcipains proved to be technically very challenging. Analysis of products after incubations of globin peptides with the proteases identified many products, suggesting the presence of contaminating fragments in commercial peptides. We therefore used 18 O labeling and assessments for reproducibility over time to identify genuine cleavage fragments. However, this approach necessarily involved the establishment of arbitrary filtering criteria, and may have inappropriately excluded some cleavage sites and/or included false cleavage sites. Second, analysis of cleavage of intact hemoglobin was cost-and labor-intensive, limiting our ability to evaluate a broad range of hydrolytic time points. Thus, our ability to identify any single hemoglobin cleavage site for falcipain-2 or falcipain-3 from our studies is somewhat limited, although cleavages seen consistently with both falcipains at multiple time points and with both peptide and intact hemoglobin substrates are very likely to represent true biological cleavage sites. Third, our study used ultrafiltration to isolate peptide cleavage fragments generated from intact hemoglobin. This procedure might lead to selective loss of certain peptides. To investigate that possibility, we previously analyzed tryptic digests of proteins prior to and after ultrafiltration, and we did not observe significant differences between the samples (Hardt, M., unpublished observation). Nonetheless, we cannot exclude the possibility that certain peptides might have been lost due to this separation technology, but, based on our overall sequence coverage of hemoglobin, this potential loss appeared to be minimal. In any event, our overall result is clear: falcipain-2 and falcipain-3 are capable of rapid hydrolysis of hemoglobin at multiple cleavage sites.",

Both falcipain-2 and falcipain-3, which are expressed sequentially, contribute importantly to the necessary hydrolysis of hemoglobin by intraerythrocytic parasites. Indeed, our results show that the falcipains rapidly hydrolyze hemoglobin at multiple sites, allowing efficient degradation of this substrate, and suggesting that the falcipains are the key proteases responsible for the massive hydrolysis of hemoglobin that occurs over the course of the intraerythrocytic life cycle of P. falciparum.
