At present there is no effective specific therapy against MERS-CoV. The use of convalescent plasma (CP) has been suggested as a potential therapy based on existing evidence from other viral infections. We aim to study the feasibility of CP therapy as well as its safety and clinical and laboratory effects in critically ill patients with MERS-CoV infection. We will also examine the pharmacokinetics of the MERS-CoV antibody response and viral load over the course of MERS-CoV infection. This study will inform a future randomized controlled trial that will examine the efficacy of CP therapy for MERS-CoV infection. In the CP collection phase, potential donors will be tested by the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) techniques for the presence of anti-MERS-CoV antibodies. Subjects with anti-MERS-CoV IFA titer of \u22651:160 and no clinical or laboratory evidence of MERS-CoV infection will be screened for eligibility for plasma donation according to standard donation criteria. In the CP therapy phase, 20 consecutive critically ill patients admitted to intensive care unit with laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection will be enrolled and each will receive 2 units of CP. Post enrollment, patients will be followed for clinical and laboratory outcomes that include anti-MERS-CoV antibodies and viral load.",

            "text": "The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was initially identified in September 2012 from samples obtained from a Saudi Arabian patient who developed severe acute respiratory infection and subsequent acute renal failure leading to death (Zaki et al. 2012) . As of September 30, 2015, a total of 1589 cases have been identified with 567 related deaths (World Health Orgnization 2015) . To date, there is no specific treatment of proven effect for MERS-CoV infection. Public Health England and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium (ISARIC) have published a decision support tool for clinicians managing cases of MERS-CoV infection. The document suggests that current evidence is strongest for testing convalescent plasma (CP) or other therapeutics which contain neutralizing antibodies (such as hyperimmune immunoglobulin) for treatment of serious MERS-CoV illness (Public Health England 2015) . Prior experience in SARS and severe influenza suggest that CP may be considered for patients who are deteriorating (despite other specific and supportive therapy) and in whom the virus remains detectable (Hung et al. 2011; Luke et al. 2006; Cheng et al. 2005; Kong and Zhou 2006; Yeh et al. 2005) . A recent systematic review of 32 reports from SARS and severe influenza concluded that CP therapy appears safe and may reduce mortality, especially if administered early in the illness (Mair-Jenkins et al. 2015 ). An exploratory post hoc meta-analysis showed a statistically significant reduction in the pooled odds of mortality following treatment compared to placebo or no therapy (odds ratio 0.25; 95 % confidence interval 0.14-0.45; I 2 = 0 %) (Mair-Jenkins et al. 2015) . Citing case series, the authors commented that (1) patients with severe presentations appeared to demonstrate temporal clinical improvements after treatment with CP and (2) administration as early as possible in the diseases course appears to be associated with greatest potential clinical effect. One randomized clinical trial (RCT) in critically ill influenza A (H1N1pdm09)-infected patients found a survival benefit when hyperimmune globulin was administered within 5 days of symptom onset (Hung et al. 2013) .",

While an RCT will be required to evaluate effectiveness, evaluating effectiveness on clinical endpoints such as mortality will likely require several hundred to several thousand seriously ill MERS-CoV patients in order to achieve sufficient statistical power, anticipating reasonable potential effect sizes. Additionally, CP from different MERS-CoV survivors will likely contain differing levels of neutralizing anti-MERS-CoV antibodies. Since seriously ill MERS-CoV-infected patients may have detectable viral RNA in various locations that can be sampled (for example lower respiratory tract secretions) for prolonged periods, it might be possible to first determine the relationship between neutralizing antibody dose and antiviral effects on clinical and laboratory features in a small open-label study. This information would be very helpful to design of an RCT and in determining the most appropriate neutralizing antibody dose, or dosing range for the study. This may also inform dose selection for follow-on anti-MERS-CoV antibody preparations currently in preclinical development (for example, neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal human neutralizing immunoglobulin derived from transchromosomic cattle (personal communication, Thomas C. Luke).",

Results will be reported as the optic density (OD) ratio, which is calculated as the OD value of the patient's sample divided by the calibrator OD value. We will use the cut-off values recommended by the manufacturer: a ratio of <0.8 is considered negative, >0.8 and <1.1 borderline and a ratio of >1.1 is considered positive. Confirmation will be done by the Indirect Fluorescent Antibody (IFA, Euroimmun AG, L\u00fcbeck, Germany) according to manufacturer's instructions. Samples with \u22651:10 will be considered reactive according to the manufacturer's instructions, subjects will be considered candidate for plasma donation if they have titers of \u22651:160; which is a similar threshold to what has been used in a convalescent plasma trial for H1N1 influenza (Hung et al. 2011) .",

In the CP collection phase subjects will be enrolled from 4 different cohorts, in order to explore all potential donors. It is unknown, at this point, which subjects are likely to have high antibody titers and therefore be CP donors. We are hoping that this feasibility study will help identifying a group of superdonors who have very high titers. By identifying the characteristics of such individuals, a more focused approach for donation can be followed. The CP therapy phase is not designed to establish efficacy; such objective requires an adequately powered randomized controlled trial. However, we believe performing this feasibility study is an essential step to examine the safety, clinical and laboratory effects and the pharmacokinetics of the MERS-CoV antibody response. The study involves giving critically ill patients this therapy in a controlled monitored setting. However, a recent systematic review suggested that early treatment with CP is likely to be more effective than late treatment (Mair-Jenkins et al. 2015) . Therefore, if the feasibility study shows that CP is safe and feasible, the next step should be a randomized controlled trial that is sufficiently powered to detect effect on mortality and enrolls patients early in the course of the disease.",
