            "text": "To support their replication, viruses take advantage of numerous cellular factors and processes. Recent large-scale screens have identified hundreds of such factors, yet little is known about how viruses exploit any of these. Influenza virus infection post-translationally activates P58 IPK , a cellular inhibitor of the interferon-induced, dsRNA-activated eIF2a kinase, PKR. Here, we report that infection of P58 IPK knockout mice with influenza virus resulted in increased lung pathology, immune cell apoptosis, PKR activation, and mortality. Analysis of lung transcriptional profiles, including those induced by the reconstructed 1918 pandemic virus, revealed increased expression of genes associated with the cell death, immune, and inflammatory responses. These experiments represent the first use of a mammalian infection model to demonstrate the role of P58 IPK in the antiviral response. Our results suggest that P58 IPK represents a new class of molecule, a cellular inhibitor of the host defense (CIHD), as P58 IPK is activated during virus infection to inhibit virus-induced apoptosis and inflammation to prolong host survival, even while prolonging viral replication.",

The response is initiated when pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), present in microbial proteins or RNAs, engage cellular pathogen-recognition receptors (PRRs) such as RIG-I, MDA5, or the toll-like receptors [1] . Upon engagement, these PRRs activate proteins such as IRF3, IRF7, and NF-kB, which translocate to the nucleus and induce the type I interferon (IFN) response [2] . Type I IFNs in turn induce the expression of numerous IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), including IFNc, interleukin (IL)-6, and the dsRNAactivated protein kinase, PKR [3] . Downstream targets of PKR include the a subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2a), NF-kB, and additional ISGs [4] [5] [6] , thus amplifying the IFN response via a positive feedback mechanism.",

The activation of P58 IPK results in reduced levels of PKRmediated eIF2a phosphorylation, which has long been thought to benefit influenza virus by maintaining a high rate of viral protein translation [8, 9] . P58 IPK is also activated at the transcriptional level in response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. During ER stress, P58 IPK inhibits another eIF2a kinase, PERK, which functions to regulate protein synthesis during the unfolded protein response [10, 11] . P58 IPK also plays a larger role in the protein processing efficiency of the ER by binding to misfolded proteins and acting as a co-chaperone [12] [13] [14] .",

This effect was due to P58 IPK functioning through a PKRdependent mechanism that is independent of PERK. We also showed that P58 IPK functions similarly during infection with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) or reovirus. These findings again suggested that influenza virus benefits from P58 IPK activation, presumably to the detriment of the host.",

To this end, we infected mice lacking P58 IPK with either the mouse-adapted A/ PR/8/34 (PR8) strain or the reconstructed 1918 (r1918) pandemic influenza virus. We then examined viral replication, lung pathology, PKR and eIF2a phosphorylation, cytokine expression, and global gene transcriptional profiles. We found that influenza virus infections were more lethal in mice lacking P58 IPK , due to increased lung pathology and inflammation. Therefore, just as P58 IPK plays a role in restoring homeostasis during ER stress through its interaction with PERK, P58 IPK may function during virus infection to restore homeostasis during the antiviral and inflammatory response through its interaction with PKR. Our findings suggest that P58 IPK represents a new class of molecule that is activated during virus infection to help regulate the host antiviral response. While a number of host proteins exist which are crucial in determining the antiviral response, P58 IPK is the first to be identified in a mammalian system which inhibits the defense response for proper development of the antiviral state. We coin this new class of regulators ''Cellular Inhibitors of the Host Defense'' (CIHDs).",

Although P58 IPK2/2 and wild-type mice exhibited similar weight loss (morbidity) over time (data not shown), mortality was markedly increased in P58 IPK2/2 mice. This phenotype was particularly pronounced at lower infectious doses ( Figure 1A ). When infected with 10 2 PFU, all P58 IPK2/2 mice died by day 5, whereas only 33% of wild-type mice died by day 6, and the others recovered. This corresponded to a fifty percent lethal dose (LD 50 ) of 10 1.3 PFU for P58 IPK2/2 mice and 10 2.0 PFU for wild-type mice. The increased mortality in P58 IPK2/2 mice was not due to increased viral load, since viral titers in the lungs of all infected mice were similar at each time point ( Figure 1B) . Furthermore, mortality was not caused by viral attachment or initial infection alone, since experiments with a replication-deficient virus (PR8DNS1) [15] did not produce disease in either mouse genotype (data not shown).",

Because influenza virus encodes only eight genes, it is dependent upon cellular proteins and processes for the generation of new viruses. One of these proteins is P58 IPK , the activation of which has long been thought to be required for efficient viral replication. To study how P58 IPK affects the ability of influenza virus to replicate and cause disease, we infected a strain of mice that lacks the gene for P58 IPK . We found that viruses replicated just as efficiently in mice lacking the P58 IPK gene, but that these mice were more susceptible to a fatal infection. The increased mortality rate in these mice was due to greater lung pathology and a heightened inflammatory response. Our results show that P58 IPK represents a new type of protein that benefits the host by reducing pathology and prolonging survival, even though it may also benefit the virus by allowing it to replicate for a longer period of time.",

The gene expression data showed a dramatic increase in chemokine expression in P58 IPK2/2 mice, which likely resulted in an exaggerated inflammatory response [26] . Although some gene expression values were low, even small changes in gene expression can have a drastic effect on biological function [27] . In addition, GSEA indicated that the GO categories were significantly perturbed, even if the genes within the categories were not highly regulated. Together, our gene expression analyses showed that the absence of P58 IPK during influenza virus infection caused an increase in inflammatory, immune response, and cell death-related genes at early times post infection, likely prognostic of the eventual increased lung pathology and ultimately death.",

One important cytokine that has been shown to be over-expressed during fatal influenza virus infection is interleukin-6 (IL-6) [28] . Using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), we found that IL-6 levels were increased in the lungs of P58 IPK2/2 mice compared with wild-type animals throughout the course of infection ( Figure 5A ). Furthermore, we detected increased levels of IL-6 in the serum of infected P58 IPK2/2 mice at day 5 post infection ( Figure 5B ). This increase in IL-6 protein in the serum and lungs of infected P58 IPK2/2 mice was accompanied by a drastic increase in IL-6 mRNA. ( Figure 5C ). Furthermore, levels of IFNb mRNA were significantly increased in the lungs of P58 IPK2/2 mice at day 3 post infection ( Figure 5D ). IFNb induction results in the increased production of IL-6 [29] , and together, the expression of these two cytokines suggests that a greater IFN and cytokine response contributes to the increased lung pathology and higher mortality rate associated with influenza virus infection of P58 IPK2/2 mice.",

This corresponded to an LD 50 of 10 1.8 PFU for P58 IPK2/2 mice and 10 2.5 PFU for wild-type mice. Similar to PR8, wild-type mice required five times the dose of r1918 to achieve fifty percent mortality, as compared to P58 IPK2/2 mice.

All infected samples were compared to genotype-matched mock-infected samples via microarrays analysis. Replicate samples were then in silico error-weighted pooled and re-ratioed to compare P58 IPK2/2 gene expression to wild-type gene expression. Following GSEA analysis using only those genes which were significantly regulated, the top gene ontology categories related to the immune response were selected (see Figure S7 for entire table).

However, of particular interest are the set of genes present in the middle panel of this Figure, which were induced in P58 IPK2/2 mice in response to infection with either PR8 or r1918, but which were induced in wild-type mice only in response to the r1918 virus. To evaluate the functional relationships of these genes more closely, we used Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) to create a network of the set of genes in the middle of Figure 7A , showing direct or indirect interactions reported for these cell-death-and inflammatory-response-related genes ( Figure 7B ). The network is centered around tumor necrosis factor (Tnf), which is interesting because activation of Tnf-related pathways has been shown to be associated with H5N1 influenza viral infections of macrophages [31] .

Here, we have specifically shown, through detailed high-throughput and biochemical analysis, how P58 IPK may protect the host during influenza virus infection. In previous reports, we demonstrated that P58 IPK is activated upon infection with influenza virus [32] and that P58 IPK binds to and inhibits PKR [7, 33] . We also showed that cells devoid of P58 IPK exhibit higher levels PKR activation and eIF2a phosphorylation, yet lower levels of viral mRNA translation during influenza virus infection [8] . Together, these results suggest that P58 IPK activation is required for more efficient influenza virus replication in vitro and that the virus usurps P58 IPK activation to the detriment of the host. However, our current study has expanded and changed our understanding of how the activation of P58 IPK impacts viral replication since we have now shown that the absence of P58 IPK did not affect levels of viral load in vivo, although we did not examine rates of viral replication. Nevertheless, influenza virus infection in P58 IPK2/2 mice resulted in increased mortality due to a heightened inflammatory response marked by increased lung pathology and apoptosis. Furthermore, at the lowest doses of influenza virus, wild-type mice recovered from infection, suggesting that P58 IPK benefits the host during infection.",

A model describing these results is presented in Figure 8 , which is divided into two categories: the apoptotic and inflammatory responses. P58 IPK functions through each via its inhibition of PKR. P58 IPK inhibits the apoptotic response via its inhibition of PKR-mediated caspase activation and eIF2a phosphorylation. P58 IPK also inhibits the inflammatory response via its inhibition of PKR-mediated NF-kB activation, which ultimately activates IFN-stimulated genes. Therefore, P58 IPK is necessary to counterbalance the activities of PKR, and together, the over-activation of pathways downstream of PKR results in increased host pathology and mortality [20, 28] . While our analysis revealed that neither PERK nor its downstream targets were activated during influenza virus infection, we regard these negative results as inconclusive due to the difficultly in performing these experiments, especially with regard to sample preparation [34] . Since influenza virus hemagglutinin has been shown to cause ER stress [35] , we are performing experiments with more sensitive assays to look for markers of ER stress in influenza virus-infected mice.",

Although a definite connection between PKR and FADD-mediated caspase 8 activation remains to be determined, apoptosis is induced by the over-expression of PKR [38] . Additionally, caspase 8 activation results in caspase 3 activation, resulting in apoptosis [39] . Fas ligand (FasL), Tnf, and caspases 1 and 7, which activate caspases 8 and 3 [40] [41] [42] [43] , were identified in our microarray analysis as being more up-regulated in P58 IPK2/2 mice during influenza virus infection. We also previously demonstrated that P58 IPK is anti-apoptotic, as nude mice injected with cells over-expressing P58 IPK undergo malignant transformation [19] . Finally, P58 IPK2/2 mice, which have basal levels of ER stress [12, 13] , exhibit increased caspase 3 activation and apoptosis of b-cells in the pancreas [44] . We have now shown that the stimulus of influenza virus infection in lung tissue contributes to increased apoptosis in the absence of P58 IPK . This was marked by increased and prolonged eIF2a phosphorylation [21] and increased caspase 3 activation in the lungs of these mice.",

            "text": "With respect to the inflammatory response arm of the model, PKR activates NF-kB, which in turn activates Foxp3, IFNb, and IFNc, and a number of chemokines [18, 45, 46] . Each of the downstream NF-kB responses shown in Figure 8 , among many others, was up-regulated in P58 IPK2/2 mice as compared with wild-type mice. Again, this is likely due to uncontrolled activation of PKR in the absence of P58 IPK . Treatment of bronchial epithelial cells with dsRNA activates both PKR and NF-kB, which results in the secretion of pro-inflammatory interleukins and chemokines [47] . This response could lead to increased lung pathogenesis during a viral infection, which was a striking difference between influenza virus-infected P58 IPK2/2 and wildtype mice. While only one lung lobe was analyzed for each mouse, and neither step sectioning nor bronchoalveolar lavages were performed, pathogenesis in P58 IPK2/2 mice was marked by increased macrophage infiltration and hyaline membrane formation. Hyaline membranes obstruct the exchange of oxygen across the alveolar walls and is characteristic of diffuse alveolar damage [48] . It is also a characteristic sign of lethal influenza virus . Both PR8 and r1918 infections result in an exaggerated inflammatory response in infected P58 IPK2/2 mice. (A) Venn diagram analysis was performed on a sample set derived from P58 IPK2/2 and wild-type (WT) mice infected with the PR8 or r1918 strains of influenza virus in triplicate at 1 day post infection. All infected samples were compared to genotype-matched mock-infected samples via microarrays analysis. Replicate samples were then pooled and error-weighted in silico. For each virus, a gene set was isolated which included genes which were up-regulated in P58 IPK2/2 mice as compared to mock and as compared to wild-type mice. The intersection of the sets for both PR8 and r1918 infection was isolated for IPA. Of the 113 genes in this set, 65 had annotation, and 47 of those had functions related to the inflammatory and cell death responses; log 10 ratio regulation of these genes in P58 IPK2/2 and wild-type mice as compared to mock is represented for both viral infections. The bar graph represents the log 10 ratio of P58 IPK2/2 to wild-type gene regulation, showing that each gene is more up-regulated in P58 IPK2/2 mice. (B) IPA network analysis of the middle set of genes in (A) highlights a subset of genes that are up-regulated in wild-type mice during r1918 infection but not PR8 infection. This diagram shows the direct or indirect interactions reported for these cell-death-(blue shading) and inflammatory-response-related (yellow shading) genes. Genes shaded orange fit into both categories. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1000438.g007 infections in cynomolgus monkeys [49] . In culture, influenza virus infection of macrophages stimulates the release of IL-6 [50] , and we observed an increase in IL-6 mRNA and protein levels in the lungs of virus-infected P58 IPK2/2 mice due to increased macrophage infiltration in the lungs of these animals. Increased levels of IL-6 have also been associated with fatal influenza virus infections [51, 52] , which is consistent with the increased mortality observed in P58 IPK2/2 mice. This is especially significant because it was at day 5 post infection, when IL-6 levels were highest, that mice lacking P58 IPK died from infection. IFNb expression has been shown to be correlated with IL-6 expression during influenza virus infection and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)coronavirus infection [53, 54] , and IFNb expression was also elevated in influenza virus-infected P58 IPK2/2 mice. Antiviral and inflammatory responses are typically necessary to clear the virus and to recover from infection [55] . However, during infection with a virus such as Ebola virus, the marked overexpression of genes associated with the immune and inflammatory response may contribute to disease pathology and death [56, 57] . We have also shown that infection of mice or macaques with H5N1 avian influenza viruses, or the 1918 pandemic virus, results in rapid disease and death, most likely due to an early and dysregulated host inflammatory response, which is associated with severe lung disease and mortality [22, 31, 52, 58, 59] . Our current genomic profiling data suggest a similar phenomenon is occurring in P58 IPK2/2 mice infected with influenza virus, where the significant expression of immune response-related genes at 1 day post infection was correlated with eventual death of the animal. In contrast, the expression profiles from wild-type mice exhibited increased expression of inflammatory response genes, but not until later times post infection, which was correlated with prolonged survival. Not only did these observations hold for the mouseadapted PR8 virus, but also for the human 1918 pandemic strain. This is noteworthy, because two strains of influenza virus, each with different species specificity, produced the same disease phenotype in P58 IPK2/2 mice via the same pathway. Furthermore, we identified a subset of genes, focused largely around Tnf and matrix metallopeptidase 3 (Mmp3), which were up-regulated in wild-type mice only during r1918 infection and not PR8 infection. Although it has been shown that Tnf activation increases the expression of Mmp3 [60] , and that matrix metallopeptidases are up-regulated in airway epithelium disease in which macrophages and eosinophils are highly present [61] , it has not previously been shown that Mmp3 activation is a function of influenza virus infection. This suggests that even by 1 day post infection, lung cells are undergoing a remodeling process which will ultimately lead to pathogenesis and mortality, by a potentially novel pathway, during pandemic influenza virus infection.",

The results of our study are therefore somewhat different than those observed in plant virus infection models, where plants lacking P58 IPK also exhibited increased host death. Since plants lacking P58 IPK exhibited lower levels of viral replication, it was concluded that P58 IPK is required for virulence and acts a susceptibility factor [9] . However, unlike animals, plants do not invoke cell death as part of their immune response to virus infection. Since we have shown that in wild-type mice P58 IPK functions to modulate the innate immune, inflammatory, and cell death responses during viral infection, resulting in decreased pathology and a lower mortality rate, activation of mammalian P58 IPK actually functions to reduce the virulence of influenza virus infection. Thus, we have identified P58 IPK as a new class of molecule that is activated during virus infection to inhibit the over-activation of inflammatory and cell death responses in order to prolong host survival. Further studies as to how to modulate the P58 IPK pathway, and thus the host's antiviral and inflammatory response, may lead to the discovery of novel therapeutics for targeted intervention during a pandemic influenza virus infection.",

(A) Venn diagram analysis was performed on a sample set derived from P58 IPK2/2 and wild-type (WT) mice infected with the PR8 or r1918 strains of influenza virus in triplicate at 1 day post infection. All infected samples were compared to genotype-matched mock-infected samples via microarrays analysis. Replicate samples were then pooled and error-weighted in silico. For each virus, a gene set was isolated which included genes which were up-regulated in P58 IPK2/2 mice as compared to mock and as compared to wild-type mice. The intersection of the sets for both PR8 and r1918 infection was isolated for IPA. Of the 113 genes in this set, 65 had annotation, and 47 of those had functions related to the inflammatory and cell death responses; log 10 ratio regulation of these genes in P58 IPK2/2 and wild-type mice as compared to mock is represented for both viral infections. The bar graph represents the log 10 ratio of P58 IPK2/2 to wild-type gene regulation, showing that each gene is more up-regulated in P58 IPK2/2 mice. (B) IPA network analysis of the middle set of genes in (A) highlights a subset of genes that are up-regulated in wild-type mice during r1918 infection but not PR8 infection.

Viral yields were calculated according to the formula: yield t = x = (log 10 (PFU/ml) t = x )/(log 10 (PFU/ml) t = 0 ), where t is time and x is the time post infection.Azygous and apical lung lobes were homogenized in mammalian extraction buffer (Pierce) supplemented with 16 complete protease inhibitor (Roche), 25 mM b-glycerophosphate, 1 mM Na 3 VO 4 , and 1 mM NaF. Total protein content was determined for clarified lung homogenates using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Homogenates were separated by SDS-PAGE, with the same amount of total protein being loaded into each lane, and then transferred to nitrocellulose paper. Immunoblots were blocked for 1 h in PBS containing 0.5% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat dry milk, washed in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, and incubated at 4uC overnight with rabbit-anti-eIF2a[pS 51 ] phosphospecific antibody (Biosource International), a rabbit polyclonal antibody recognizing full-length eIF2a (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or a mouse monoclonal actin antibody (MP Biochemicals) in PBS containing 0.5% Tween 20 and 1% nonfat dry milk. Membranes were washed, incubated for 2 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse or anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (Jackson Immunoresearch), and bound antibodies detected with ECL Western blotting detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences/GE Healthcare). To determine levels of PKR and phosphorylated PKR, 400 mg of total protein from lung homogenates were immunoprecipitated with an antibody recognizing total PKR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h at 4uC followed by an overnight incubation at 4uC with Protein A Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences/GE Healthcare). Beads were washed with NETN buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.5% NP-40). Western blotting was then performed for total PKR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and pT 451 PKR (Invitrogen) as described by the product analysis sheets.Blood was also collected at the time of sacrifice and serum was separated by centrifugation. Using equal amounts of total protein in serum or azygous and apical lung lobe homogenates, absolute levels of IL-6 were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using the Quantikine assay kit (R&D Systems) as described by their protocol.",

Sections were also immunostained for cleaved caspase 3 and macrophage marker F4/80 as described [63] . Influenza virus NP was detected with a rabbit polyclonal antibody (a kind gift from Adolfo Garc\u00eda-Sastre) at 1:8000 and using the protocol described for cleaved caspase 3 without antigen retrieval.To score lung inflammation and damage, a semi-quantitative scoring system was used; for this, the entire cardiac lobe surface was analyzed with respect to the following parameters: alveolitis, peribronchiolitis, and perivasculitis. Each parameter was graded on a scale of 0-4 with 0 as ''absent,'' 1 as ''slight,'' 2 as ''mild,'' 3 as ''moderate,'' and 4 as ''severe.'' The total ''lung inflammation scor'' for each mouse lung lobe was determined as the sum of the scores for each parameter, the maximum being 12. The average, standard deviation, and P-values from a two-tailed t-test assuming non-equal variance were determined for each set of triplicate mice for each genotype. Representative micrographs from the most significant doses are presented for both genotypes.",
