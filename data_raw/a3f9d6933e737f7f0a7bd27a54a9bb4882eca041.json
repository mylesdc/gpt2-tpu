            "text": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide in children aged <5 years and older adults with acute lower respiratory infections (ALRIs). However, few studies regarding the epidemiology of hospitalizations for RSV infection have been performed previously in China. Here, we aimed to describe the clinical and epidemiologic characteristics of hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed RSV infection in eastern China. Active surveillance for hospitalized ALRI patients using a broad case definition based on symptoms was performed from 2009-2013 in 12 sentinel hospitals in eastern China. Clinical and epidemiologic data pertaining to hospitalized patients of all ages with laboratory-confirmed RSV infection by PCR assay were collected and analyzed in this study. From 2009 to 2013, 1046 hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed RSV infection were enrolled in this study, and 14.7% of patients had subtype A, 24.2% of patients had subtype B, 23.8% of patients with subtype not performed, and 37.3% of patients had RSV coinfections with other viruses. RSV and influenza coinfections (33.3%) were the most common coinfections noted in this study. Moreover, young children aged <5 years (89.1%, 932/1046), particularly young infants aged <1 year (43.3%, 453/1046), represented the highest proportion of patients with RSV infections. In contrast, older adults aged !60 years (1.1%, 12/1046) represented the lowest proportion of patients with RSV infections among enrolled patients. The peak RSV infection period occurred mainly during autumn and winter, and 57% and 66% of patients exhibited symptoms such as fever (body temperature !38\u02daC) and cough separately. Additionally, only a small number of patients were treated with broad-spectrum antiviral drugs, and most of patients were treated with antimicrobial PLOS ONE | drugs that were not appropriate for RSV infection. RSV is a leading viral pathogen and a common cause of viral infection in young children aged <5 years with ALRIs in eastern China. Effective vaccines and antiviral agents targeting RSV are needed to mitigate its large public health impact.",

From 2009 to 2013, a total of 1046 hospitalized ALRI patients (children and adults) were treated at 12 sentinel hospitals in eastern China. We found that most patients had RSV single-infections and that 37.3% had mixed viral infections caused by RSV and other respiratory tract viruses. Additionally, we observed that coinfections with RSV and influenza were the most frequently diagnosed mixed infections among our patient population, a finding consistent with those of previous studies in China [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] and other countries [15, [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . Taken together, these findings indicate that coinfections may influence severe illnesses in patients with RSV infections, especially in young children aged <5 years. Although many studies regarding RSV have focused on children aged <5 years and elderly adults, among whom the morbidity and mortality rates of RSV infection are high, little is known regarding the effects of RSV among patients of all ages. We analyzed the overall age distributions of the patients with RSV infections. Our results indicated that children aged <5 years represented the largest proportion of patients with RSV infections (86.4%) and coinfections (83.3%), particularly young children (total: 62.3%; coinfections: 48.7%) aged <2 years, compared to patients aged !5 years. These observations indicate that an association exists between RSV prevalence and age, a finding consistent with those of previous reports in China, Japan, Thailand and other countries [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [24] [25] [26] [27] .",

            "text": "Our surveillance data indicate that RSV infection occurred almost year-round from 2009 to 2013 and peaked mainly during autumn and winter in areas of eastern China with subtropical climates, results similar to those reported previously in China and other countries [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] but different from those reported in tropical countries [16] . These findings indicate that RSV infection is characterized by a seasonality that may be associated with regional climate and demographic factors [6, 12, 22] . The seasonality of RSV is different in tropical and subtropical countries; thus, hospitals in these countries can utilize seasonally timed interventions and specific vaccination and hospital infection control strategies [1, 9, 13] . Most of the patients enrolled in this study had symptoms of fever (temperature !38\u00b0C) and cough, and moderately significant differences in temperature and cough were observed between patients with RSV coinfections and patients with RSV single-infections. These observations are consistent with those of previous reports [17] [18] [19] . A few patients experienced shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, the majority of whom suffered from RSV coinfections, indicating that RSV coinfections with other viruses can cause more severe disease than RSV single-infections. However, the proportions of patients with pneumonia were not significantly different between patients with RSV coinfection and patients with RSV single-infection, indicating that pneumonia development was likely related to other factors, such as patient age, patient physical condition, and viral load [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] . Generally, viral infections do not significantly affect common laboratory parameters (such as WBC, PO 2 , and PCO 2 ), particularly during their early stages [11, [29] [30] . Our data indicated that there were no significant differences in laboratory parameters between patients with RSV single-infections and patients with coinfections. Currently, only a few antivirals exist that are effect against RSV infections and other viral infections, and delays in viral testing have important effects on infection severity, particularly among patients with RSV, influenza virus and enterovirus infections [1, 11, 30] . In our study, only a few patients with RSV infections were treated with broad-spectrum antiviral drugs (Ribavirin and Potassium sodium dehydroandroandrographolide succinate) that were not specific for RSV. Most of the antimicrobial drugs administered to patients in this study were not appropriate for patients with RSV infection but are commonly used in such patients in China. It is well known that antimicrobial drug overuse selects for highly resistant organisms, causes immune dysfunction, and increases viral loads, which may explain the high morbidity and mortality rates associated with RSV infection [12, [26] [27] [28] .",

RSV infection is common in young children, and implementing disease control strategies (such as safe vaccination) during the appropriate seasons may have a significant impact on public health. Clinical and laboratory data pertaining to patients with RSV infection may be helpful for optimizing patient treatments. Timely and accurate diagnosis of RSV infection in patients with ALRIs is necessary to prevent large-scale RSV spread and to reduce the burden imposed by the disease and the misuse of antimicrobial drugs. These preliminary results indicate that more surveillance data are needed to estimate the RSV disease burden and to determine whether geographic locations, climate, other environmental factors and RSV coinfections impact the severity ofRSV-related epidemics.",
