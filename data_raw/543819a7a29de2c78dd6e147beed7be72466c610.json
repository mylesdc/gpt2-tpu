            "text": "Background: Laboratory testing is a fundamental component of influenza surveillance for detecting novel strains with pandemic potential and informing biannual vaccine strain selection. The United States (U.S.) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), under the auspices of its WHO Collaborating Center for Influenza, is one of the major public health agencies which provides support globally to build national capacity for influenza surveillance. Our main objective was to determine if laboratory assessments supported capacity building efforts for improved global influenza surveillance. Methods: In 2010, 35 national influenza laboratories were assessed in 34 countries, using a standardized tool. Post-assessment, each laboratory received a report with a list of recommendations for improvement. Uptake of recommendations were reviewed 3.2 mean years after the initial assessments and categorized as complete, in-progress, no action or no update. This was a retrospective study; follow-up took place through routine project management rather than at a set time-point post-assessment. WHO data on National Influenza Centre (NIC) designation, External Quality Assessment Project (EQAP) participation and FluNet reporting was used to measure laboratory capacity longitudinally and independently of the assessments. All data was further stratified by World Bank country income category. Results: At follow-up, 81 % of 614 recommendations were either complete (350) or in-progress (145) for 32 laboratories (91 % response rate). The number of countries reporting to FluNet and the number of specimens they reported annually increased between 2005, when they were first funded by CDC, and 2010, the assessment year (p < 0.01). Improvements were also seen in EQAP participation and NIC designation over time and more so for low and lower-middle income countries. Conclusions: Assessments using a standardized tool have been beneficial to improving laboratory-based influenza surveillance. Specific recommendations helped countries identify and prioritize areas for improvement. Data from assessments helped CDC focus its technical assistance by country and region. Low and lower-middle income countries made greater improvements in their laboratories compared with upper-middle income countries. Future research could include an analysis of annual funding and technical assistance by country. Our approach serves as an example for capacity building for other diseases.",

It is completed during country site visits by influenza experts from U.S. public health laboratories (including CDC) who make recommendations for improvement based on their observations and responses to the questions. Site visits or 'assessments' also provide an opportunity to deliver technical assistance, and to identify the resource requirements for each laboratory.

This may be the result of funding constraints, since all participating laboratories were located in low-and middle-income countries. Most procurement recommendations required expenditure, for example, purchasing equipment. Likewise, staff training is likely to require financial resources for travel, to send staff overseas, or bring experts into a country. By comparison, many general recommendations required a change in laboratory practices or procedures needing little or no funding. For example, altering an influenza testing algorithm or updating written standard operating procedures (SOPs) requires staff time and expertise, but not expenditure and may therefore have been easier to implement. The assessments have helped determine how to best work with participating laboratories to improve influenza testing and surveillance. For example, an analysis of the first 26 assessments helped determine that training in laboratory management, especially quality assurance (QA) and biosafety, were needed most among African countries. As a consequence, CDC, APHL and the National Institute for Communicable Diseases in South Africa developed and delivered the course \"Improving Influenza Laboratory Management Practices\" in Johannesburg in early 2011. This course covered a broad range of topics, and was subsequently tailored to regional training conducted in Bangkok in March 2012 and Istanbul in May 2014. These three courses have provided training to a total of 112 participants from 59 countries.",

Types of troubleshooting included addressing poor PCR efficiency and inadequate growth of cells for tissue culture and virus isolation. During one site visit, an assessor set up a new piece of equipment for the automated extraction and purification of influenza RNA, which was awaiting installation.

We have inferred that funding and technical assistance provided by CDC between 2005 and 2010 has contributed to the improvement in capacity outcomes observed, but additional data and further analysis would be required to demonstrate this with greater confidence. Furthermore, we acknowledge the larger WHO GISRS and WHOCCs, in addition to other organizations, which have also contributed substantially to capacity building efforts. Our analysis of results by country income level may be limited to some extent by the small number of countries in the low income and upper-middle income categories; it is harder to show statistically significant improvements in these categories, especially among the upper-middle income countries which were performing better at baseline than low-and lower-middle income countries.",

In the early stages of this pandemic, GISRS facilitated the rapid sharing and analysis of virological specimens, allowing the WHO CC at CDC to quickly develop a diagnostic test which was then shared via the GISRS and Influenza Reagent Resource (IRR) websites [27] . Data from GISRS on circulating strains was used to establish vaccine candidates from which the pandemic vaccine was developed [27] . GISRS also played a pivotal role in mapping the spread of the virus globally [27] . GISRS, as well as the WHO's influenza EQAP, has served as a model for improving laboratory surveillance for other IHR notifiable diseases, for example, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus [28] and dengue fever [29] .",
