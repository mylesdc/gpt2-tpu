The viral genomic RNA (gRNA) is approximately 8 kb in length; encoding the gag, pol, and env genes in the 5\u2032-3\u2032 direction (Fig. 1a) . Replication of the gRNA depends upon the binding of a host-derived tRNA, which primes the synthesis of negative-sense cDNA intermediates that are subsequently converted to dsDNA harbouring long terminal repeats (LTRs) at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 termini (Fig. 1a ) [1] . The LTRs contain the sequences required for integration of the virus into host chromosomal DNA, as well as regulatory elements that promote RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription of viral RNA from the integrated provirus. These RNA transcripts may be spliced to give rise to mRNAs encoding the envelope (Env) glycoproteins (Fig. 1a) ; or they may remain unspliced, in which case they can either be utilised for the translation of the Gag and Gag-Pol polyproteins (Fig. 1a) , or packaged into newly synthesised virions as non-covalently associated gRNA dimers [2, 3] .",

We carried out sequencing of total RNA (RNASeq) and sequencing of ribosome-protected RNA fragments (RPFs) (RiboSeq)-also known as ribosome profilingof MuLV-infected Rat2 cells (a rodent-derived cell line). These data allowed us to delineate the transcription and translation of MuLV RNA in unprecedented detail. , R, and U5 repeats within the LTRs, and the gag, pol and env coding regions. U3 houses the viral promoter region, while the transcription start site (TSS) corresponds to the first nucleotide of the R region. The poly-adenylation (poly-A) signal also occurs within R. Translation of pol is dependent upon readthrough of the gag gene termination codon. Two distinct mRNA species are produced from the provirus template, with the gag-pol transcript being unspliced and the env transcript being spliced at the indicated positions. b Rat2 cells were infected with MuLV and at 96 h p.i. cell lysates were prepared, separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted using a polyclonal anti-capsid (p30) serum.

RiboSeq CHX, RiboSeq HAR and RNASeq libraries were prepared for each biological sample and deep sequenced. A meta-analysis of reads mapping to host RefSeq mRNA transcripts showed excellent phasing of the RiboSeq libraries for both biological repeats (Additional file 1: Fig. S1 ). Ribosomal occupancy of these transcripts in the HAR-treated sample was strongly enriched at known initiation codons, whereas the coverage in the CHX-only samples was more uniformly distributed across coding regions (Additional file 1: Fig. S1 ). Figure 1c shows the normalised RiboSeq CHX (red) and RNASeq (purple) positive-sense coverage of the MuLV RNA. For all libraries, negative-sense mapping reads (dark blue) were present in much lower quantities than positive-sense mapping reads. The RiboSeq read density was considerably higher in the gag and env coding regions compared with pol. This is expected, given that pol translation is dependent upon a proportion of ribosomes undergoing stop codon readthrough (see below). The lengths of RPFs mapping to both viral and host RNA showed a sharp peak at 29 nt, consistent with the size of mRNA fragments protected by translating eukaryotic ribosomes from digestion by RNase I [10] (Additional file 1: Fig. S2 ). In contrast, the length distribution of virus-mapped RNASeq reads was much broader (Additional file 1: Fig. S2 ), as it is largely determined by the region excised from the gel during the gel size selection step of RNASeq library preparation (corresponding to approximately 28-34 nt).",

Suppression of termination is promoted by a 63-nt readthrough signal located downstream of the gag UAG, consisting of an 8-nt purine-rich spacer sequence followed by an RNA pseudoknot structure [12] [13] [14] . To estimate the efficiency of readthrough, we measured the density (as reads per kilobase per million mapped reads; RPKM) of RPFs mapping to the gag and pol coding regions, and normalised these values by the equivalent RNASeq read densities to at least partly control for PCR and ligation biases. As can be seen in Fig. 1d , we found that 6-8% of ribosomes proceed beyond the gag UAG codon and translate pol. These data constitute the first direct measurements of the relative ribosomal occupancy of gag and pol during MuLV infection, and are in close agreement with previous in vitro reporter assays that have been used to estimate the readthrough efficiency [8] . The efficiency of gag stop codon readthrough is therefore ~ 100 fold above the background level (i.e. that observed in the absence of specific stimulatory sequences [15] ). This regulatory strategy appears to allow the virus to tightly and reliably control the stoichiometric ratio of the associated protein products [8] .",

Previously, it has been reported that initiation of Glyco-Gag synthesis begins at a noncanonical (CUG) initiation codon located at nt 357-359 of the MuLV genome [16] . This codon occurs within a favourable context (accCUGg) [16] (in mammalian cells, the presence of an A residue at position \u2212 3, or G residues at \u2212 3 and + 4-relative to the first nucleotide of a potential start codon-is favourable for initiation [22, 23] ). Surprisingly, however, our RiboSeq HAR library reveals very low coverage at this CUG codon (Fig. 2 -light green rectangle represents the N-terminal extension of gag, as per [16] ). It is possible that technical biases-for example nuclease bias, PCR bias, ligation bias, or some combination of these-resulting from variations in local nucleotide composition might contribute towards the low coverage observed at this CUG. Supporting this possibility, RNASeq density was also particularly low at this position.",

Translation may proceed contiguously from this codon through the gag ORF; thus, presumably, giving rise to an alternative Glyco-Gag isoform which is N-terminally extended by a further 12 amino acids (MELTSSEHPAAT, assuming GUG is decoded by Met-tRNA i ) relative to the canonical Glyco-Gag. The GUG codon is present in some but not all MuLV strains, and is not well conserved among other gammaretroviral lineages for which sequence data are currently available (Additional file 1: Fig. S3-highlighted in green) , although some sequences have alternative nearby potential non-AUG initiation sites. Note that a 77 kDa Glyco-Gag species of unknown origin has been described previously [16, 24] and might represent an N-terminally extended Glyco-Gag.

Accordingly, the density of mapped RiboSeq reads increased substantially downstream of the env splice acceptor, relative to the pol-encoding region immediately upstream (Fig. 1c) . Two clear ribosomal initiation peaks were observed at two CUG codons located at nucleotides 249 and 215 upstream of the AUG env initiation codon (Fig. 3) . The first CUG is found within a strong initiation context (aguCUGg), and is associated with a 34-codon uORF (\"env-uORF-1\"). The second occurs within a medium to poor initiation context (caaCUGg) and is associated with a 91-codon uORF (\"env-uORF-2\") that is in-frame with the pol gene and encodes the C-terminal tail of the MuLV integrase (Fig. 3) . In agreement with the HAR initiation profiling data, the RiboSeq CHX density (normalized to RNASeq density) within env-uORF-2 was four-fold higher, on average, than that in the remainder of the pol gene. An alternative splice form, SD\u2032, has been identified that uses a splice donor in the middle of gag (nt 1596) and the canonical env splice acceptor; SD\u2032 encodes a product comprising Fig. 3 Coverage of the region surrounding the MuLV env gene splice acceptor. Bar plots show the number of 5\u2032 read ends (with + 12 nt offset) mapped to viral RNA in RiboSeq HAR, RiboSeq CHX and RNASeq libraries generated from Rat2 cell infections, in reads per million (RPM). Blue, green and orange bars correspond to reads mapping in phases 0, + 1 and + 2, respectively, relative to the env ORF. Translation of env-uORF-1 and env-uORF-2 is initiated from CUG codons that coincide with large peaks in RiboSeq HAR data the N-terminal part of Gag fused to the C-terminal end of Pol [30, 31] . However, the excess ribosome density at the 3\u2032 end of pol clearly starts at the env-uORF-1 and env-uORF-2 CUG initiation codons, not at the SD\u2032/env splice acceptor site (Fig. 3) , thus indicating that the bulk of translation in env-uORF-2 comes from initiation on the env transcript rather than translation of the gag-pol fusion ORF on the SD\u2032 transcript. Interestingly, the C-terminal region of the integrase that would be encoded by env-uORF-2 is known to interact with the bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) protein family members, which in turn interact with acetylated histone tails, thus facilitating integration of the proviral genome at actively transcribed regions of the host chromosome [32, 33] .",

However, the genomes of most lineages harbour multiple potential alternative initiation sites that are in-frame with the pol gene and within the env transcript leader (Additional file 1: Fig. S4 codons highlighted in cyan). Most of these possible alternative initiation codons have contexts which are at least as strong as that of the MuLV env-uORF-2 CUG. Hence, it is possible that distinct initiation sites are used for the translation of the integrase C-terminal domain. It should also be noted that the Rhinolophus ferrumequinum retrovirus pol gene is split into two separate coding regions; the latter of which encompasses the C-terminal tail of the integrase [34] and is included in the given alignment.",
