Here, with a view to understanding the underlying mechanisms, we first systematically dissected the exact signaling network in BTV-induced autophagy. We found that the activity of mTOR, a crucial pivot, was inhibited by BTV1 infection, subsequently leading to downstream p70S6K suppression and autophagy initiation. We then explored the upstream regulators of mTOR and analyzed their activities via a series of assays. We found BTV1-induced autophagy to be independent of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway. However, the BTV1-induced inhibition of PI3K/Akt was found to be partially responsible for mTOR inactivation and subsequent autophagy initiation. Furthermore, we found unexpectedly that AMPK seemed to play a more important role in BTV1induced autophagy. Elevated [Ca 2+ ] cyto -mediated activation of CaMKK\u03b2 exactly managed the activation of AMPK, which then positively regulated autophagy through suppressing mTOR. We must emphasize that TSC2 is a fatal mediator between upstream Akt or AMPK and downstream mTOR through its phosphorylation. Taken together, our data suggested that the BTV1-induced inhibition of the Akt-TSC2-mTOR pathway and the upregulation of the AMPK-TSC2-mTOR pathway both contributed to autophagy initiation and further favored virus replication.",

Many efforts have been made in the past few years to decipher the regulatory network of autophagy initiation from yeast to mammals [15] [16] [17] . Several signaling cascades have been reported to regulate autophagy. The major control complex for autophagy is the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which, when active, inhibits the initiation of the pathway 18-20 . Many diverse cellular signals converge on mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) to regulate autophagy upstream of the core machinery 21 . The serine/threonine kinase Akt (also known as PKB) has been shown to modulate autophagic activity regulated by the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway 22,23 . Mutations causing Akt activation or inactivation would, respectively, suppress and induce autophagy. Molecules upstream of mTOR, such as AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), have been shown to inhibit mTORC1 and lead to activation of the autophagic process. AMPK, a crucial factor in sensing cellular energy and ion homeostasis 24,25 , negatively regulates mTOR either by directly inhibiting mTOR or by activating tuberous sclerosis protein 2 (TSC2) protein, an upstream negative effector of mTOR 26-28 . Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are central molecules mediating signaling pathways in innate immunity. To date, seven distinct groups of MAPKs have been characterized in mammalian cells. Of these seven, the most extensively studied are ERK1/2, c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) and p38 MAPKs (p38 \u03b1 /\u03b2 /\u03b3 /\u03b4 ), which have also been reported to regulate autophagy activity 29 . In addition, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, p53, nuclear factor-\u03ba B (NF-\u03ba B) and other mTOR-independent pathways are also involved in the regulatory network of autophagy [30] [31] [32] .",

To understand the pathogenicity of a virus, one of the key questions in virology is how viruses gain temporary or long-term control over their hosts. Viruses must evolve strategies that utilize or usurp cellular processes to facilitate their own propagation. Macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy) is a conserved cellular catabolic process that mediates the removal of damaged organelles and long-lived cytoplasmic macromolecules via a lysosomal degradative pathway 9 . Recently, a multitude of studies have reported that viral infections have complex interconnections with the autophagic process 10 . Autophagy has intracellular antimicrobial properties and plays a role in immune responses to viral infections. However, many viruses, including a number of RNA viruses, have been shown to evade or subvert this process to benefit their replication [11] [12] [13] . A similar phenomenon was also observed in our previous study, which revealed that BTV infection can activate autophagy and utilize it",

Rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor, was used as a positive control.

            "text": "To confirm whether mTOR is repressed by BTV1 in a replication stage-dependent manner, we performed an immunoblotting assay using samples collected at various infection times. The results showed that mTOR phosphorylation activity displayed a reduced trend with the replication of the virus. Consistently, the phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 kinase-1(p70S6K), a hallmark substrate of mTORC1, was also found to be diminished with increasing infection time (Fig. 1b) . The ratios of p-mTOR/mTOR and p-p70S6K/p70S6K were notably decreased by approximately 3.5 times and 4.5 times, respectively, at 36 hpi. (Fig. 1c , Upper and middle panels, P < 0.01). As expected, the increase in LC3-II was monitored at the indicated times after BTV1 infection relative to mock-infected cells (Fig. 1b) . Similarly, the indicator ratio of LC3-II to \u03b2 -actin was significantly increased by approximately 3 times at 24 hpi and 4 times at 36 hpi (Fig. 1c , Lower panel, P < 0.01). Meanwhile, monoclonal antibodies that specifically recognize the BTV1 VP2 and NS3 proteins were used to track the progression of infection. Collectively, these observations indicate that BTV1 induces autophagy by inhibiting mTOR signaling, and the process is dependent on viral replication. Autophagy initiated by BTV1 is not dependent on the ERK1/2-mTOR pathway. To investigate the upstream regulators targeting mTOR, a systematic screening strategy was formulated. Because the ERK1/2 pathway is reported to play a key role in the inhibition of mTOR and thus the positive regulation of autophagy 35 , we first examined whether ERK1/2 participates in autophagy induction in BTV1 infected cells. Because the autophagy phenomenon and mTOR activity are more obvious during the middle-late stage of virus replication, the following tests all used two timepoints: 24 and 36 hpi. Figure 2a shows that the bands of phospho-ERK1/2 hardly changed in BTV1-infected cells relative to the uninfected group, which implied that phospho-ERK1/2 was not involved in BTV1-induced autophagy. Further confirmation assays were conducted by the inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation with the specific inhibitor U0126. The results showed that the p-ERK1/2 band reduced significantly with U0126 treatment, meaning the inhibitory effect of the drug was obvious. However, the inhibition of p-ERK1/2 by U0126 hardly affect the trends of mTOR phosphorylation and LC3 conversion caused by BTV1 infection (Fig. 2b , Lane 2 and 4), which suggested that ERK1/2 was not the functional upstream regulator of mTOR-LC3 pathway in BTV1 infection (Fig. 2b) . Additionally, immunofluorescence analysis was used to quantify the LC3 punctae, another marker of autophagy. After transfection with pEGFP-LC3, the addition of U0126 did not obviously alter the number of EGFP-LC3 punctae relative to the DMSO group with or without BTV1 infection in BSR cells (Fig. 2c ,d, P > 0.05). Thus, we conclude that ERK1/2 signaling is not involved in BTV1-induced autophagy. Our findings of viral titer determination are consistent with previous observations of VP2 in western blotting, indicating that U0126 treatment did not affect virus replication (Fig. 2e ). All the above results suggest that BTV1-induced autophagy initiation is not dependent on the ERK1/2-mTOR pathway.",

Therefore, we examined Akt activity to investigate whether autophagy induced by BTV1 infection was involved in this mTOR-dependent pathway. We found that BTV1 induced a marked reduction in Akt and mTOR activity as well as a great increase in LC3-II, especially at 36 hpi (Fig. 3a) , implying that Akt positively regulates mTOR. Next, to further obtain evidence for the interconnection between decreased Akt signaling and mTOR-dependent autophagy, activator insulin was exposed to BSR cells with or without BTV1 infection. Figure 3b showed that after insulin treatment, the decreases in Akt and mTOR phosphorylation were restored in BTV1-infected or mock-treated cells, which led to reduced autophagy (Fig. 3b) . Similar findings were seen in the confocal image of BTV1 plus insulin, showing fewer accumulated GFP-LC3 punctae in Fig. 3c ,d. As expected, autophagy suppression led to decreased extracellular and intracellular virus yields with insulin treatment, especially at 36 hpi (Fig. 3e) , indicating that Akt links to autophagy and BTV replication at a late stage of infection. Moreover, we constructed mutant plasmids to examine the effects of dominant-negative (DN) and constitutively active (myr) Akt variants on autophagy and virus replication. We found that the abundance levels of LC3-II and NS3 protein were partially recovered by the presence of DN-Akt and partially degraded by myr-Akt compared with the vector group or WT-Akt group (Fig. 3f) . Taken together, our data show that the Akt-mTOR pathway contributes to the regulation of autophagy and naturally affects BTV1 (c) Bar graphs showed the relative abundances of phosphorylated mTOR (p-mTOR), p-p70S6K and LC3-II protein (normalized to corresponding total protein or \u03b2 -actin).

In addition to Akt, another key mediator of mTOR is AMPK, which has been demonstrated to negatively regulate mTOR activity 37, 38 . We sought to determine whether BTV-induced mTOR inactivation in BSR cells involves AMPK. First, BSR cells were infected with BTV1 or treated with AICAR (an AMPK activator) 39 for 36 h to assess the AMPK activity. Figure 4a shows that BTV1 infection led to increased AMPK activity in BSR cells, as evidenced by the heightened expression level of phospho-AMPK. Then, we further analyzed the links of AMPK activation and mTOR inhibition with BTV1 infection. Figure 4b shows that BTV1-infection significantly increased the phosphorylation of AMPK at 24 and 36 hpi, while the levels of p-mTOR steadily decreased, which accordingly resulted in an increase in LC3-II. Thus, it is reasonable to speculate that AMPK might relate to the mTOR signaling pathways. Previous reports proposed that AMPK could be activated via Ca 2+ /calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase (CaMKK\u03b2 ) and subsequently inhibited mTOR 40 . So the level of CaMKK\u03b2 was also examined and found elevated in BTV1-infected cells at 24 and 36 hpi compared with mock cells (Fig. 4c ). This observation is consistent with the result for AMPK. Accordingly, it is reasonable to speculate that the CaMKK\u03b2 -AMPK-mTOR signaling pathwaymay be involved in BTV1-induced autophagy.",

The puncta formation of GFP-LC3 was further examined. Compared with uninfected cells, significant puncta formation was found in BTV-infected cells but was dramatically reduced with the application of Compound C (Fig. 5b,c) , so we concluded that AMPK could positively regulate autophagy. Additionally, in our previous study, we found that autophagy affected the state of BTV infection. Here, we found that the inhibition of autophagy with Compound C via AMPK not only downregulated the expression of VP2 and NS3 in BTV1-infected cells at 36 hpi ( Fig. 5a) but also decreased the yields of BTV progeny both inside and outside the infected cells at 24 and 36 hpi (Fig. 5d ).

BSR cells were infected with BTV1, as previously performed, in the absence or presence of STO-609, a specific CaMKK\u03b2 inhibitor 42 . Lysed samples were used to evaluate the activity of AMPK and mTOR. As expected, STO-609 treatment not only significantly inhibited the BTV-induced increase in the phosphorylation of AMPK but also restored the BTV-induced decrease in the phosphorylation of mTOR, implying that CaMKK\u03b2 is an upstream regulator of the AMPK-mTOR axis (Fig. 6a) . A large number of GFP-LC3 puncta were observed in BTV1-infected cells, an indicator of autophagy activation, whereas these puncta were reduced dramatically upon STO-609 treatment, suggesting that activated autophagy was inhibited (Fig. 6b,c) . Thus, we concluded that CaMKK\u03b2 could positively regulate autophagy. The significant reduction in extracellular viral load and intracellular virus titer when exposed to STO-609 reflected that CaMKK\u03b2 is required for BTV1 replication (Fig. 6d) . As before, siRNAs targeting CaMKK\u03b2 were used to confirm the results of the drug tests (Fig. 6e) . As shown in Fig. 6f , compared with the negative control group, BSR cells transfected with CaMKK\u03b2 -targeting siRNAs exhibited a similar phenomenon with STO-609 treatment: AMPK expression and LC3-II level were suppressed, and p-mTOR protein was regained. The depressed extracellular and intracellular viral loads (Fig. 6g) and reduced viral proteins synthesis (Fig. 6f) indicated that autophagy inhibition via CaMKK\u03b2 inhibition also disturbed BTV1 replication. In brief, our data suggest that CaMKK\u03b2 is responsible for the AMPK-mTOR axis and BTV1 infection. In an attempt to elucidate further the mechanism, upstream inducer was progressively explored.",

We observed that the fluorescence intensity of the peaks shifted rightward with the infection, meaning that [Ca 2+ ] cyto levels increased progressively with increasing infection time (Fig. 7a) . Further, to determine whether the BTV-induced increase in [Ca 2+ ] cyto actually performs signaling through CaMKK\u03b2 and AMPK for autophagy induction, we first applied ionomycin as a positive control to perform our assay. Ionomycin (Iono), a Ca 2+ ionophore that serves as a mobile Ca 2+ carrier, allows Ca 2+ fluxes from both the extracelluar space and the ER causing a rapid burst in cytosolic calcium levels and CaMKK\u03b2 and AMPK activation 45 . As shown in Fig. 7b ,c, compared with mock cells, BSR cells treated with BTV1 or ionomycin exhibited similar change trends in [Ca 2+ ] cyto and related moleculars, suggesting that BTV-induced Ca 2+ signaling may lead to autophagy stimulation by the same way. Based on these findings, we reasoned that if chelation of calcium resulted in contrary effects. 1,2-Bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N\u2032 ,N\u2032-tetraacetic acid tetrakis(acetoxymethyl ester) (BAPTA-AM) is a well-established chelator of intracellular calcium ions 40 . As expected, the fluorescence intensity of the peak shifted leftward with BAPTA-AM treatment, indicating that BAPTA-AM treatment indeed obviously reduced [Ca 2+ ] cyto level (Fig. 7d) . Accordingly, the addition of BAPTA-AM to the cells significantly abolished the activities of CaMKK\u03b2 and AMPK. In addition, the remarkable decrease of LC3 expression with BAPTA-AM was accompanied by an obvious reduction in viral proteins synthesis (Fig. 7e ). All these reflected that Ca 2+ is required for functional autophagy in a CaMKK\u03b2 -and AMPK-dependent manner during BTV infection.",

Based on our existing data, we then planned to focus our attention on TSC2. To address whether TSC2 is an essential intermediate in both the Akt-mTOR and AMPK-mTOR signaling pathways, TSC2 gene knockdown was first performed using TSC2-specific siRNAs to predict related molecules. Some pairs of siRNAs targeting TSC2 (Mesocricetus auratus/mau, GI:524963743) and TSC2 (Cricetulus griseus/cgr, GI:625196261) were designed and screened, and we chose siTSC2 (mau2#) for further use because it exhibited the most significant effect (Fig. 8a) . Nontarget siRNA was used as a negative control (siNC). We found that BTV1 infection induced the activation of TSC2 and reduced mTOR activity. The suppression of TSC2 by siRNA recovered mTOR phosphorylation and then downregulated LC3-II (Fig. 8b) , suggesting that TSC2 regulated autophagy via mTOR. Furthermore, Akt inhibition and AMPK activation caused by BTV1 infection were not markedly altered in BSR cells treated with TSC2-specific siRNA compared to cells treated with control siRNA (Fig. 8b) , implying that Akt and AMPK might be upstream regulators of TSC2 in BTV1-mediated autophagy. To thoroughly confirm this conclusion, we transfected BSR cells with Akt mutant plasmids and siR-NAs against AMPK, respectively, then infected the cells with BTV1 for 36 h, and the protein lysates were analyzed. We found that the activation of Akt with plasmid myr-Akt repressed p-TSC2, and the inhibition of Akt with DN-Akt recovered TSC2 activity (Fig. 8c) . The inhibition of AMPK also suppressed TSC2 activation (Fig. 8d ). All these results indicated that TSC2 is a crucial downstream effector of Akt and AMPK. In addition, LC3 aggregation was markedly decreased in infected cells treated with TSC2-specific siRNA compared to cells treated with control siRNA (Fig. 8e,f) , which suggested that TSC2 was required for the BTV1-induced autophagic response. TSC2 interference ultimately led to impaired replication of BTV through the disturbance of autophagy (Fig. 8g) . These results imply that TSC2 is a pivotal intermediate of the Akt-mTOR and AMPK-mTOR signaling pathways, ultimately contributing to BTV1-induced autophagy. Figure 8h shows a hypothetical model depicting the signaling mechanisms of BTV1-induced autophagy in BSR cells.",

The different classes of PI3K exert distinct effects on autophagy 49 . Increases in the class I PI3K product, PIP3, inhibit autophagy by inducing Akt activation. In other words, class I PI3K/Akt is a negatively regulated pathway of autophagy. In contrast, increasing the levels of the class III Scientific RepoRts | 6:23130 | DOI: 10.1038/srep23130 PI3K product, PI-3-P, stimulates autophagy. For BTV1, our results suggest that the down-regulation of p-mTOR can be partly attributed to Akt inactivation after BTV1 infection, which leads to autophagy activation (Fig. 3) . Mutations causing Akt activation or inactivation cause the suppression and induction of autophagy, respectively. These results are consistent with a previous report 50 . Similarly to BTV, with slight differences, avian reovirus protein p17-mediated Tpr suppression negatively regulates PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling for its own replication, and HCV infection induces ER stress, which inhibits the Akt-TSC-mTORC1 pathway, thus inhibiting ULK1, and subsequently upregulates autophagy 34, 51 . Thus, we deduce that different viruses utilize the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway to promote autophagy through various stimulatory molecules. In addition, it is worth mentioning that the functions of the PI3K/Akt pathway are not limited to autophagy induction. The PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is involved in multi-cellular processes such as glucose metabolism, protein synthesis, and proliferation. It also appears to be associated with the host cell immune response to counteract viral infection 52 . Moreover, previous investigations have suggested that many viruses rely on the activation of this pathway for their replication 53, 54 . Hence, we conclude that the PI3K/Akt pathway is a complex and crucial pathway that is distinctively manipulated by various viruses, depending on the virus type or stage of viral replication.",

            "text": "AMPK is a critical regulator of the cellular metabolism and plays an important role in the autophagy process. Phosphorylated AMPK can either negatively regulate the mTOR complex (mTORC1) or directly phosphorylate ULK1, both of which can initiate the autophagy process 38 . Tracking back upstream from AMPK demonstrated that two signals were involved, Ca 2+ -mediated CaMKK\u03b2 and cellular energy. Calcium and CAMKK\u03b2 are involved in AMPK activation in hypothalamic neurons, T cells and endothelial cells, indicating that the calcium metabolism also plays a role in AMPK-mTOR-mediated autophagy regulation 40 . Recent research findings have shown that, in rotavirus-infected cells, CaMKK\u03b2 is stimulated by the increase in the intracellular Ca 2+ level and further activates AMPK, the latter potently inducing autophagy 55 . Rotavirus-encoded viroporin NSP4 plays a key role in this process. Because BTV and rotavirus all belong to the Reoviridae family, and the NS3 of BTV shares a similar structure with viroporin, this CaMKK\u03b2 signaling was verified in BTV1-induced autophagy. Quite predictably, BTV infection caused the elevation of [Ca 2+ ] cyto and Ca 2+ -mediated activation of CaMKK\u03b2 , leading to the phosphorylation of AMPK and the initiation of autophagy (Figs 4-7) . Although BTV1 infection indeed could elevate cytosolic calcium, the mechanisms by which this occurs are unclear. We speculated that BTV might encode one or more proteins to change the biomembrane permeability to calcium, causing the increased [Ca 2+ ] cyto originated from ER or Golgi [Ca 2+ ] stores, or extracellular environment. In our previous study, we have confirmed that ER stress response is involved in BTV-induced autophagy 56 , which remined us there might be some links between ER stress and elevated [Ca 2+ ] cyto . It's worth noting that many viruses, such as poliovirus, coxsackievirus, and hepatitis B virus, all could induce [Ca 2+ ] cyto increase as well as CaMKK\u03b2 activation 57, 58 , leading to the speculation that virus-mediated CaMKK\u03b2 activation through elevated [Ca 2+ ] cyto might be a common mechanism for the induction of autophagy. Moreover, we noted that the effects of AMPK inhibition on BTV1-induced autophagy are slightly greater than the effects of CaMKK\u03b2 inhibition, so we speculated that AMPK might be simultaneously activated by some other upstream signals, which are currently unclear. According to the literature reports, AMPK is a serine-threonine kinase that functions as a fuel gauge and maintains energy homeostasis during cellular stress 59 . AMPK is sensitive to the cytosolic AMP-to-ATP ratio, and metabolic stress activates autophagy through the suppression of mTOR signaling 24 . Thus, whether the decreased ATP level is triggered by BTV1 infection and participates in the activation of AMPK and the induction of autophagy needs to be further explored.",

(h) A hypothetical model signaling network involving ERK1/2, Akt and AMPK in BTV1-induced autophagy. BTV1 infection induces the suppression of Akt and upregulation of AMPK via [Ca 2+ ] cyto -mediated CaMKK\u03b2 activation, leading to the TSC2-mediated inhibition of mTOR and downstream p70S6K, ultimately leading to autophagy initiation. In addition, ERK1/2 is not involved in BTV1induced autophagy. The whole signaling network is utilized by BTV1 for its own benefit. and virus titers were calculated as TCID 50 /mL using the Reed-Muench method. All data are shown as the means of three independent experiments. Cell viability assay. The cell viability assay was performed using the WST-1 cell proliferation and cytotoxicity assay kit according to the manufacturer's protocol.
