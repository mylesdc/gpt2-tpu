However, earlier studies have showed that the bleeding incidence of this regimen was high [4, 5] . Reducing infusion time to 2-h have demonstrated promising results with decreased major bleeding rate. Additionally, we have observed that the UK-2 h (20 000 U/kg over 2 h) regime has superior thrombolytic effects over the UK-12 h regimen for fresh thrombi in a canine PE model [6] . Because of the potential advantages of lower bleeding risk, increased effectiveness for fresh thrombi, convenience and lower cost, UK-2 h becomes a promising regimen. However, there is no direct comparison between this regimen with the ACCP recommended UK12 h regimen.",

Although this inclusion may potentially make our efficacy comparison of the two regimens less conclusive, subgroup analysis did show that UK-2 h regimen was effective not only for patients with intermediate risk PE but also for patients with hemodynamic instability. Nevertheless, future studies with anticoagulation control in patients with intermediate risk PE will be valuable to determine whether thrombolytic therapy is indeed beneficial in these patients. Currently, giving LMWH is not a routine practice for high risk PE patients. However, subcutaneous injection of LMWH has been shown to produce greater efficacy, less hemorrhagic risk, and improved convenience in clinical research and practice. Considering its advantages, it would be safe to use LMWH in high risk PE patients after thrombolytic therapy.",

Therefore, we could not draw a confirmed conclusion. Further studies with larger sample size are desirable to determine the efficacy and safety of this UK 2 h regimen. There is a serious imbalance in the number of patients between the two treatment groups which was attributable to smaller case numbers assigned to 2-hour vs 12-hour UK infusion. Larger sample size and centralized randomization should avoid this type of imbalance to some extent.",

Few randomized trials have assessed the potential long-term benefits of thrombolytic therapy in acute massive PE except the study reported by Meneveau et al [31] . The study suggested that a 2-h regimen of streptokinase can be routinely used in patients with massive PE and maintained cardiac output without obviously compromising efficacy or safety.
