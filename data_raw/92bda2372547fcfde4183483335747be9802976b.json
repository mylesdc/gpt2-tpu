In this study, we describe a novel mode of its antiviral action. We demonstrate that the supernatant from IFN--treated cultured cells restricted HBV and HCV infection by inhibiting viral entry into hepatoma cells. The factors contained in the supernatant competed with the virus for binding to heparan glycosaminoglycansthe nonspecific attachment step shared by HBV and HCV. Secreted factors of high molecular mass that bind to heparin columns elicited the antiviral effect. In conclusion, IFN-is able to induce soluble factors that can bind to heparan glycosaminoglycans thus leading to the inhibition of viral binding.",

This study and followup researches led to the development of IFN as a therapeutic tool to treat a number of infectious diseases, in particular chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis C. IFN elicits antiviral actions by inducing a wide array of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). By interacting with their specific receptors, IFN activates signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) complexes. Phosphorylated STAT then activates the classical Janus kinase-STAT signaling pathway and initiates the transcription of different ISGs [2] .",

IFITM was originally identified through RNAi genetic screening and was shown to inhibit infections of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), influenza A virus, West Nile virus, and Dengue virus. Later IFITM proteins were found to potently restrict entry and infections by a number of highly pathogenic viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), filoviruses, HCV, and SARS coronavirus [17, 19, [41] [42] [43] [44] . Recently, researchers identified cholesterol-25-hydroxylase (CH25H) as a broad antiviral ISG [45] . CH25H converts cholesterol into a soluble antiviral factor, 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC). 25HC treatment in cultured cells inhibited growth of a broad group of enveloped viruses including VSV, HIV, and herpes simplex virus.

In the case of chronic infection entry inhibition prohibits infection from spreading to naive cells, which together with antiviral therapy eliminates infected cells providing higher chance of cure. For example, in HIV infection this has been accomplished with the interference of virus entry using a gp41 protein derived peptide, enfuvirtide, which prevents fusion of the virus with the host cellular membrane [47] . Virus entry inhibition also provides an opportunity to prevent recurrent hepatitis B after liver transplantation. Previous studies demonstrate that acylated HBV preS-derived lipopeptides targeting viral envelope protein components could prevent the interaction of HBV with its cellular receptor, thus preventing de novo HBV infection in humanized mice [48] . Since hepatitis Delta virus uses the same receptor as HBV, HBV entry inhibitors are equally effective against both viruses [49] . Although there is no evidence indicating that HBV can propagate by cell-to-cell transmission, numerous enveloped viruses have been shown to employ modes of spreading involving both direct cell-cell transmission and the release of progeny viruses into the extracellular space [50] . Further study showed the myristoylated preS-derived peptide Myrcludex-B could block HBV cell-to-cell dissemination among human hepatocytes in the liver of humanized mice [51] . Similarly, in the context of HCV infection, an entry inhibitor targeting viral receptor claudin-1 used in monotherapy was shown to cure chronic infection in the infected humanized mice [52] .",

(b) Protein size of each fraction. (c) Differentiated HepaRG cells were incubated with indicated samples for 24 hours and then infected with HBV. HBeAg was evaluated by ELISA 4 days after infection. (d) Highly purified HBV SVPs from chronic HBV carriers were added to heparin-coated (25 g/mL) 96-well plate and treated with different fractions. Plates were incubated for 2 h at 37 \u2218 C, and heparin-bound SVPs were detected using an HBsAg ELISA kit. (e) Differentiated HepaRG cells were incubated with elution treated by glycosidase, or trypsin, or proteinase K for 24 hours and then infected with HBV. HBsAg was evaluated by ELISA 4 days after infection. IFN-induced factors inhibit HCV replication. Huh7.5 cells were seeded in 96-well plates in triplicate 24 h prior to virus infection. HCV luciferase reporter virus was used to infect cells at an MOI of 0.1 TCID50/cell. 1000 IU/mL of IFN-, 10 L of prepared \"elution\" or \"concentrate\" was added to the culture medium (total volume = 200 L) from the beginning of inoculation until the cells were lysed 72 h later after HCV infection. Luciferase activity was determined and one of two independent experiments is displayed as mean \u00b1 SD.",
