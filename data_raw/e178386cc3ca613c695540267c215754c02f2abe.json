            "text": "Lassa virus causes hemorrhagic fever characterized by immunosuppression. The nucleoprotein of Lassa virus, termed NP, binds the viral genome. It also has an additional enzymatic activity as an exonuclease that specifically digests doublestranded RNA (dsRNA). dsRNA is a strong signal to the innate immune system of viral infection. Digestion of dsRNA by the NP exonuclease activity appears to cause suppression of innate immune signaling in the infected cell. Although the fold of the NP enzyme is conserved and the active site completely conserved with other exonucleases in its DEDDh family, NP is atypical among exonucleases in its preference for dsRNA and its strict specificity for one substrate. Here, we present the crystal structure of Lassa virus NP in complex with dsRNA. We find that unlike the exonuclease in Klenow fragment, the double-stranded nucleic acid in complex with Lassa NP remains base-paired instead of splitting, and that binding of the paired complementary strand is achieved by ''relocation'' of a basic loop motif from its typical exonuclease position. Further, we find that just one single glycine that contacts the substrate strand and one single tyrosine that stacks with a base of the complementary, non-substrate strand are responsible for the unique substrate specificity. This work thus provides templates for development of antiviral drugs that would be specific for viral, rather than host exonucleases of similar fold and active site, and illustrates how a very few amino acid changes confer alternate specificity and biological phenotype to an enzyme.

The unique digestion of dsRNA by Lassa virus NP probably removes this pathogen-associated molecular pattern, and allows the virus to replicate without strong interference by the innate immune system. Structural features that confer this unique enzymatic specificity to NP were not apparent from previous crystal structures of the NP exonuclease, in which no substrate was bound. Here we present the crystal structure of the exonuclease domain of Lassa NP in complex with eight bases of dsRNA. This structure demonstrates that the unique substrate specificity is conferred by an extremely limited number of residues outside the enzymatic active site.",

One copy of NPD340 was found in the asymmetric unit. Initial Fo-Fc difference maps and 2Fo-Fc maps generated from the molecular replacement solution showed clear density for NPD340, as well as additional density for the dsRNA, which was not present in the search model ( Figure 1 ). The dsRNA was built manually. Iterative cycles of model building were performed using Coot [16] and subsequent rounds of refinement were carried out using PHENIX. 5% of the reflections were set aside for R free calculations. Simulated annealing was employed early in refinement to reduce model bias of the molecular replace-ment search model and simulating-annealing omit maps were used to confirm the RNA density. Custom hydrogen-bonding restraints between base-pairing nucleotides were generated using the 'PDB to 3D restraints' server [17] to maintain proper RNA base hydrogen-bonding distances. Initial models were uploaded to the server to identify hydrogen-bonding base pairs and to generate weighted ideal distance restraints of 2.9 \u00c5 between hydrogen-bond donors and acceptors of opposing nucleotide bases, which were then added to the refinement.

The single all-purine and all-pyrimidine strands were annealed to yield dsRNAs that each contain one all-purine and one all-pyrimidine strand. Digestion of dsRNA by Lassa NP is sequence-independent, and thus, there is equal likelihood for either the purinecontaining or the pyrimidine-containing strand to be digested. Correspondingly, the electron density does not distinguish between the two. Hence, we have arbitrarily modeled the strand leading into the active site (the substrate strand) as the purine-containing strand and the complementary, non-substrate strand as the pyrimidine-containing strand (Figure 1 and Figure 2 ).",

Alignment of the Lassa NP-dsRNA complex, with structures of ISG-20 [5] and e186 [6] , each in complex with a mononucleotide, shows that the positional arrangement of the active site nucleotide is extremely similar amongst all three DEDDh exonucleases (Figure 3b ).

When dsRNA is incubated with WT NP, the labeled RNA is digested within five minutes. By contrast, Y429A and Y429L-containing NPs show incomplete digestion even after 60 minutes (Figure 5b ).

These exonucleases contain a basic loop motif adjacent to the active site that may facilitate melting of duplex DNA in order to provide a suitable single-stranded 39 end for the active site [6, 9, 19] . Certainly, mutation of this basic loop in KF and Trex2 reduces exonuclease activity [9, 21] , suggesting a role for the motif in binding nucleic acid, particularly the non-substrate strand as it extends from the active site [9, 21] . We note that in Lassa NP, the site that is positionally equivalent to the basic loop of the other exonucleases is neither basic nor loop-shaped, but is instead much shorter and mostly hydrophobic (Figure 7) . However, Lassa NP does encode a different basic loop located on the opposite side of the active site. Mutation of the basic residues in this loop also disrupts exonuclease activity [3] . This loop is in the correct position to interact with the non-substrate strand as it is ''freed'' from the duplex as the exonuclease reaction proceeds. Importantly, the ''relocation'' of the basic loop motif in Lassa NP may account for the differential mode of binding of duplex substrates seen between Lassa NP and the other exonucleases.",

            "text": "Mutational analysis of Lassa NP suggests that Y429 is the only critical contact to the non-substrate strand. Processive exonucleases such as Lassa NP require the stepwise procession of the substrate into and the subsequent removal of the product out of the active site. It is possible that interaction between Y429 and the RNA may facilitate this action. This is supported by the fact that mutation of Y429 to alanine or leucine permits binding, but greatly inhibits the digestion of RNA. Interestingly, other DEDDh exonucleases such as ISG-20 [5] , Trex 1 [7] , Trex 2 [18] and e186 [6] do not contain a Tyr or other aromatic residue equivalent to Y429 of Lassa NP, and as previously mentioned, no other DEDDh exonuclease has been shown to have strict specificity for a doublestranded substrate. Thus, biochemical analysis and comparison to other exonuclease structures suggests that the specificity of Lassa NP for double-stranded substrates over single-stranded substrates is likely derived from the p-p stacking interaction between the tyrosine ring and the RNA base that previously complemented the one cleaved off in the active site. Further, a hydrogen bond between the RNA-specific 29OH and the G392 in the active site could explain why the exonuclease activity of Lassa NP is specific for RNA over DNA in the substrate strand. This additional hydrogen bond, which would only be present in RNA, may help anchor the nucleotide within the active site. Although the contact is to the main-chain nitrogen and G392 is not part of the DEDDh motif, previous work demonstrated that mutation of G392 to alanine disrupts both the exonuclease function and the immunosuppressive function of NP [3] . The position of the main-chain nitrogen afforded by the uniquely flexible glycine seems to be important for proper orientation of the 39 nucleotide of an incoming RNA strand relative to critical residues of the active site. Mutation of this residue to anything other than glycine would result in Q and y backbone dihedral [6] ) is illustrated in yellow, Trex2 (PDB code 1Y97 [9] ) in magenta, and Lassa NP in green. All of these exonucleases contain a basic loop motif. In e186, the basic motif (K141, R142, R151) lies above and to the right of the active site. In Trex 2, the basic loop is in the same general position, but all residues except for R152 are disordered and indicated by a dotted line. In Lassa NP, no such loop exists in this location and instead strand b5 and helix a5 are directly connected by an IDIAL hydrophobic sequence (residues I482 to L486). Instead, Lassa NP has a basic loop motif in a projecting ''arm'' located to the left of the active site rather than above and to the right. This loop contains K516, K517, K518 and R519, although the side chains are disordered in this structure. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0044211.g007 angles outside allowable regions, unless several surrounding residues, including the active site D389 and E391, rearrange to accommodate it. Hence, mutation of G392 may force the active site into a non-functional arrangement. Curiously, the coronaviruses are the only other viruses known to encode a DEDDh exonuclease. SARS-CoV nsp14 was recently shown to be involved in RNA synthesis and genome fidelity [22, 23] . Notably, nsp14 will digest ssRNA and dsRNA, but not DNA, and also has a conserved glycine in the same position as Lassa NP G392. Although structural information is not yet available for nsp14, it is possible that in this enzyme as well, the Q and y backbone dihedral angles uniquely available to a glycine residue dictate the strict specificity for RNA over DNA.",

Due to mutation of E391 to alanine, the second catalytic divalent ion is not bound in the active site. (b) Comparison of the active site of Lassa NP E391A to the active sites of the DEDDh exonucleases ISG-20 (cyan, PDB code 1WLJ[5]) and e186 (yellow, PDB code 1J54[6]), which were determined in complex with mononucleotides. Both cations are apparent in the structures of ISG-20 and e186. Amino acid numbering of the shared DEDDh motif is for Lassa NP.(c) A model of wild-type Lassa NP in complex with the terminal G8 mononucleotide. The crystallized ion MgB is drawn in grey. The position of E391 and the cation in site A are based on their positions in the unbound structure (PDB code 3Q7B[3]). Hydrogen bonds are colored red; coordination bonds are colored black; an arrow indicates the position of the next nucleotide in the digested strand. Expected water molecules, based on structural similarity to other DEDDh exonucleases, are drawn in pale blue. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0044211.g003",

(a) The substrate strand, which leads into the active site, forms hydrogen bonds to the NP through the phosphate backbone and by contacts to G8. D426 hydrogen bonds to its nitrogenous base, and the main chain nitrogen of G392 makes hydrogen bonds to the 29 and 39OH of its ribose sugar. (b) The non-substrate strand forms hydrogen bonds between the 29OH of C1 and Q425, and the 29OH of C4 and D465. There is also a base stacking interaction between C1 and Y429. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0044211.g004Additionally, modeling of hybrid substrates suggests that Lassa NP can only efficiently bind to A-form duplex substrates. Modeling of B-form DNA demonstrates clashes would likely occur between the DNA and protein. However, there do not appear to be any clashes when A-form ssDNA is modeled as part of a hybrid RNA:DNA substrate (Figure 8). Notably, dsRNA is naturally found as A-form in the cell.",
