This study provides a very promising discovery that a peptide, designated Z2, derived from the stem region of ZIKV E protein potently inhibits in vitro and in vivo infection of ZIKV. The authors have demonstrated that Z2 can interact with the ZIKV surface protein and disrupt the integrity of viral membranes, resulting in the release of viral genomic RNA and inactivation of ZIKV particles. Intraperitoneal administration of Z2 was highly effective in protecting type I interferon receptor-deficient mice against lethal ZIKV challenge. Most importantly, the authors have shown that Z2 could penetrat e the placental barrier to enter fetus tissues and is safe for use in pregnant mice and their fetuses. Therefore, this peptide has great potential to be further developed as a safe and effective anti-ZIKV drug to treat ZIKV infection in high-risk populations, particularly the pregnant women.",

It would be very interesting if the authors are able to detect the presence of Z2 peptide in the mouse testis tissue.

The synthetic peptide Z2 is derived from the stem region of ZIKV envelope protein and is able to penetrate the placental barrier of pregnant, non-infected mice. Conversely, daily injection of Z2 protected non-pregnant mice from a lethal infection challenge with ZIKV. As other peptide drugs were previously used in pregnant women to prevent HIV transmission to the child and based on the presented data, this concept seems promising. As mode of action, the manuscript shows that Z2 disrupts the membrane of the enveloped ZIKV, leads to the release of viral genomes, and thus abrogates infectivity. The used methods are well suited to address the raised research questions, and the experiments are well controlled, including unrelated peptides or viruses. Nevertheless, several key points on the route of virus challenge and safety profile need to be addressed as outlined below before the manuscript may be suited for publication in Nature Communications.",

The results that Z2 reaches fetuses of non-infected A129 mice (IVIS imaging of fluorescently labeled Z2, Fig. 4 ) seem disconnected from the data, showing that Z2 can protect adult not pregnant mice from ZIKV infection (survival data, Fig. 6 ). A major claim of the manuscript is that Z2 can be used during pregnancy to protect fet uses from ZIKV infection, but this claim is actually not addressed by the data. The authors need to provide evidence that Z2 can prevent teratogenic effects in pregnant A129 mice by protecting the developing fetuses from ZIKV infection. These experiments c ould be performed using a lower and sublethal dose of ZIKV in pregnant mice and determine fetal development.",

Safety of Z2 was, however, only tested in pregnant mice the dose that protected non-pregnant mice from ZIKV infection (10 mg/kg) and a 2-fold higher dose (20 mg/kg). Even though not showing in vitro cytotoxicity for cell lines (Fig. S4 ) or mouse red blood cells (Fig. S4) , the performed test in mice is not sufficient to conclude about toxicity in vivo. Along the same lines, the shift in fluorescence of E-protein negative cells in Fig. 3B may indicate a non-specific binding of Z2 to non-infected cells, and Z2 reaches non-infected fetuses (Fig. 4) , suggesting binding to non-infected cells and potential off-target effects. Consequently, a dose-escalation study in pregnant mice needs to be performed to determine potential toxicity.",

The results showed that Z2 treatment could reduce viremia in ZIKV-infected pregnant C57BL/6 mice (p < 0.05) (Figure 6A) . At the same time, viral RNA load in placentas from the Z2-treated pregnant mice was significantly lower than that from vehicle-treated mice (p < 0.01), and the infection rate decreased from 18/24 to 12/24 ( Figure 6B) . Interestingly, Z2 treatment resulted in the decrease of infection rate of fetal head from 14/24 to 2/24 (p < 0.001) ( Figure 6C) . These results suggest that Z2 may inactivate ZIKV virions either before or after the virions have penetrated the placenta to fetus, thus reducing the infection rate of fetuses, as well as protecting against vertical transmission of ZIKV in pregnant mice.\" \"Antiviral efficacy of Z2 in pregnant C57BL/6 mice Antiviral efficacy of Z2 in pregnant mice was evaluated using the method as previously reported 39 . Briefly, 24 pregnant C57BL/6 mice (E12-14) were assigned randomly to two groups and infected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 1 x 10 5 PFU of ZIKV (SZ01).

Supplementary Figure 13 : Pharmacokinetic study of Z2. SD rats (200 \u00b1 10 g, n=3) were administrated 10 mg/kg Z2 intravenously via the tail vein. Blood samples were collected through retro-orbital bleeding at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8 and 12 h after administration and centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 5 min to obtain the serum samples. Then 150 \u03bcl methanol containing 15 \u03bcg C24M peptide (MTWEEWDKKIEEYTKKIEELIKKS) as an internal standard was added to 50 \u03bcl serum to precipitate the protein. After centrifugation at 17,000 rpm for 10 min, the supernatant was subjected to liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis, using an AB SCIEX QTRAP 6500 instrument (SCIEX, Boston, USA). All concentration data were dose-normalized and plotted as serum drug concentration time curves. PK solutions 2.0 (noncompartmental pharmacokinetics data analysis) was utilized to analyze the pharmacokinetic parameters. Response: We apologize for the confusion. In our revised manuscript, we removed Figure 5A and added the following statement \"The same legend was used for Figure 5A -5D.\" (highlighted in yellow) in the figure legend of the new Figure 5 . We converted the original Figure 5F to Supplementary Figure S11. (Fig. S4 ) or mouse red blood cells (Fig. S4) , the performed test in mice is not sufficient to conclude about toxicity in vivo. Along the same lines, the shift in fluorescence of E-protein negative cells in Fig. 3B may indicate a non-specific binding of Z2 to non-infected cells, and Z2 reaches noninfected fetuses (Fig. 4) , suggesting binding to non-infected cells and potential off-target effects. Consequently, a dose-escalation study in pregnant mice needs to be performed to determine potential toxicity.",

We have added experiments to determine the potential in vivo toxicity of Z2 at dose of 40, 80, and 120 mg/kg body of weight, to pregnant mice. As shown in new Figure 5 , moms or pups in each group grew normally. Z2 treated groups camparing with PBS group showed no significant differences in ALT and creatinine in the blood, and histological sections of organs were normal without exception. These results suggest that Z2 at the dose as high as 120 mg/kg is safe for pregnant mice, which is 11-fold higher than that providing protection against ZIKV infection in vivo. Indeed, some non-specific binding of Z2 was observed. However, we believe that this very limited non-specific binding will not significantly affect the in vivo efficacy of Z2.",

This study provides a very promising discovery that a peptide, designated Z2, derived from the stem region of ZIKV E protein potently inhibits in vitro and in vivo infection of ZIKV. The authors have demonstrated that Z2 can interact with the ZIKV surface protein and disrupt the integrity of viral membranes, resulting in the release of viral genomic RNA and inactivation of ZIKV particles. Intraperitoneal administration of Z2 was highly effective in protecting type I interferon receptor-deficient mice against lethal ZIKV challenge. Most importantly, the authors have shown that Z2 could penetrate the placental barrier to enter fetus tissues and is safe for use in pregnant mice and their fetuses. Therefore, this peptide has great potential to be further developed as a safe and effective anti-ZIKV drug to treat ZIKV infection in high-risk populations, particularly the pregnant women.",

We previously did plan to investigate whether Z2 could prevent teratogenic effects in pregnant A129 mice by protecting the developing fetuses from ZIKV infection. However, because of the difficulty in obtaining enough pregnant A129 mice (at least 10, E12-14), as noted above, we could not perform the necessary experiments before submission of our original manuscript. Fortunately, Dr. Cheng-Feng Qin (co-corresponding author) and his colleagues have recently established a C57BL/6 pregnant mouse model to study ZIKV vertical transmission 5 . Therefore, we were able to use this mouse model to determine whether Z2 is able to block transmission of ZIKV transplacentally. As shown in newFigure 6, treatment with Z2 could significantly decrease the viremia of pregnant C57BL/6 mice and reduce the rate of ZIKV infection of placentas and fetal heads. Please see our response to Reviewer #2's critique (#1.2) for more details.2.Fig. 5: The authors claim that Z2 is a safe peptide drug candidate for use in pregnant women. Safety of Z2 was, however, only tested in pregnant mice the dose that protected non-pregnant mice from ZIKV infection (10 mg/kg) and a 2-fold higher dose (20 mg/kg).

Since we cannot get AG129 mice from animal suppliers in China, we obtained AG6 mice (I/II interferon receptor-deficient, C57BL/6 background). It has been shown that AG6 mice can be used as the lethal mouse model for studying infection of Dengue virus. 8 According to the reviewer's suggestion, we inoculated ZIKV subcutaneously (a natural route of ZIKV transmission) and injected Z2 peptide intraperitoneally, to analyze the efficacy of Z2 in AG6 mice. As shown in Figure 7C and 7D, Z2 intraperitoneally administered was highly effective against the lethal challenge with ZIKV via a subcutaneous route in the mouse footpad.",
