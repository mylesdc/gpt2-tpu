To define key cell types that require type I IFN signaling to orchestrate immunity against West Nile virus (WNV), we infected mice with conditional deletions of the type I IFN receptor (IFNAR) gene. Deletion of the Ifnar gene in subsets of myeloid cells resulted in uncontrolled WNV replication, vasoactive cytokine production, sepsis, organ damage, and death that were remarkably similar to infection of Ifnar 2/2 mice completely lacking type I IFN signaling. In Mavs 2/2 6Ifnar 2/2 myeloid cells and mice lacking both Ifnar and the RIG-I-like receptor adaptor gene Mavs, cytokine production was muted despite high levels of WNV infection. Thus, in myeloid cells, viral infection triggers signaling through MAVS to induce proinflammatory cytokines that can result in sepsis and organ damage. Viral pathogenesis was caused in part by massive complement activation, as liver damage was minimized in animals lacking complement components C3 or factor B or treated with neutralizing anti-C5 antibodies. Disease in Ifnar 2/2 and CD11c Cre + Ifnar f/f mice also was facilitated by the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-a, as blocking antibodies diminished complement activation and prolonged survival without altering viral burden. Collectively, our findings establish the dominant role of type I IFN signaling in myeloid cells in restricting virus infection and controlling pathological inflammation and tissue injury.",

RNA intermediates of viral replication are recognized by cytosolic and endosomal pattern recognition receptors (PRR), such as RIG-I-like receptors (RLR) or Toll-like receptors (TLR), which signal through adaptor molecules (e.g., MAVS, TRIF, and MyD88) and transcription factors (e.g., IRF-3 and IRF-7) to induce type I IFN expression and secretion. Type I IFNs bind to a heterodimeric receptor (IFNAR) and mediate pleiotropic effects downstream of a canonical Janus kinase (JAK)-Signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) signaling pathway. This results in the induction of antiviral IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), activation of antigen-presenting cells, and regulation of cytokine and chemokine production (reviewed in [2] ). Although IFNAR is expressed on all nucleated cells, individual cell types may respond differently to signaling by type I IFN, as evidenced by overlapping yet distinct transcriptional programs [3, 4] .",

Mosquitoes transmit WNV and in the skin CD11c + cells and keratinocytes are believed to be initial targets of infection [9, 10] . Infected DCs migrate to the draining lymph node (LN) where viral replication ensues, resulting in viremia and spread to other peripheral organs [11] . Viral replication in the skin and LN induces a local and systemic type I IFN response, which is critical for limiting WNV replication and preventing dissemination to the brain and spinal cord. Indeed, subcutaneous WNV infection of Ifnar 2/2 mice results in a rapidly fatal infection, which is associated with high viremia and altered tissue and cellular tropism compared to wild-type (WT) mice [12, 13] . Analogously, Mavs 2/2 mice, which lack RLR signaling, exhibit increased susceptibility to WNV infection in many tissues [14] . Recent reports also have observed that the control and regulation of WNV infection requires IL-1\u00df production [15] [16] [17] , and that inflammasome activation synergizes with type I IFN signaling to suppress WNV replication.",

Thus, the dominant antiviral effects in vivo of type I IFN signaling against WNV occur in myeloid cell types. Analysis of WNV-infected mice revealed preferential infection of Ifnar 2/2 myeloid cells, and this resulted in a syndrome of ''cytokine storm'', which was associated with liver and kidney damage, and rapid death. Immunopathogenesis in WNV-infected Ifnar 2/2 and CD11c Cre + Ifnar f/f mice animals was mitigated by exogenous administration of TNF-a blocking antibodies, and the sepsis syndrome was associated with massive alternative pathway complement activation as tissue damage was improved in mice lacking the complement components C3 or factor B.

Although WNV-infected Ifnar 2/2 and CD11c Cre + Ifnar f/f mice rapidly deteriorated, clinical signs of neuroinvasive disease including limb paralysis, seizures, ataxia, or sustained tremors were not apparent. Ifnar 2/2 and CD11c Cre + Ifnar f/f mice were more vulnerable to WNV infection than Cre 2 Ifnar f/f littermate controls or CD19 Cre + Ifnar f/f mice, which lack IFNAR expression only on B cells. The decreased expression of IFNAR on CD11c Cre + Ifnar f/f cells was confirmed in mice following WNV infection (Fig. 1B) . Thus, the loss of IFNAR expression on CD11c + cells resulted in a clinical phenotype after WNV infection that was nearly identical to a deletion of IFNAR on all cells.

CHIKV preferentially targets myoblasts, fibroblasts, and some M\u00d8 populations but is not reported to infect DCs [27] . As seen previously [28] , Ifnar 2/2 mice infected with CHIKV succumbed to infection within 4 to 5 days. In contrast, the CD11c Cre + Ifnar f/f , LysM Cre + Ifnar f/f , or the Cre 2 Ifnar f/f littermate control mice failed to develop lethal CHIKV infection. Thus, selective deletion of IFNAR expression on CD11c + or other myeloid cells did not make mice vulnerable to other viruses, even if a complete gene deletion did; these results are consistent with studies with the coronavirus MHV, which showed a partial lethality phenotype in CD11c Cre + Ifnar f/f mice [20] .",

To address this question in the context of West Nile virus (WNV) pathogenesis, we infected mice that specifically delete the type I IFN receptor gene (Ifnar) in subsets of myeloid cells, including dendritic cells and macrophages. Remarkably, mice lacking Ifnar expression only in myeloid cell subsets rapidly developed a sepsis-like syndrome that was characterized by enhanced WNV infection and visceral organ injury and caused by massive proinflammatory cytokine production and complement activation. By using additional gene targeted deletion mice, we show that WNV infection triggered signaling through the RIG-I like receptor adaptor protein MAVS to cause complement activation, sepsis, and tissue damage. Indeed, liver damage was minimized in animals lacking specific complement components, or treated with neutralizing anti-complement or anti-TNF-a antibodies. Our results establish how type I IFN signaling in dendritic cells and macrophages restricts infection, controls inflammatory cascades, and prevents pathogenesis in vivo.",

Histological analysis of visceral organs from Ifnar 2/2 and CD11c Cre + Ifnar f/f mice showed increased cellular infiltrates, coagulation necrosis, and tissue destruction after WNV infection of the liver, spleen, and draining LN when compared to the Cre 2 Ifnar f/f mice. However, little to no cellular infiltrate or tissue destruction was observed in the brains of any of the mice at this early time point (Fig. 3A-D) . Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) analysis confirmed greater numbers of dead cells in the liver, spleen, and LN but not in the brains of Ifnar 2/2 and CD11c Cre + Ifnar f/f mice (Fig. 3E-H) . Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed to determine whether these phenotypes correlated with cellular infection. Despite the high titer (10 8 FFU/mg) of infectious virus in liver homogenates (Fig. 2B) , we observed relatively low levels of WNV antigen staining in hepatic sections from Ifnar 2/2 and CD11c Cre + Ifnar f/f mice (Fig. 3I) . We also failed to observe any obvious brain pathology in mice at 48 hours and this correlated with a paucity of viral antigen in tissue sections. In comparison, WNV antigen staining was more apparent in the draining LN and the spleen of Ifnar 2/2 and CD11c Cre + Ifnar f/f mice compared to Cre 2 Ifnar f/f mice ( Fig. 3J and K). Combined with the flow cytometry data on cell subsets (Fig. 2H) , our analysis suggests that the enhanced viral burden in Ifnar 2/2 and CD11c Cre + Ifnar f/f mice was attributable to preferential infection of Ifnar 2/2 CD11c + cells. The high viral titers in some organs (e.g., liver and brain) showing little WNV antigen staining by IHC might be due to infected CD11c + Ifnar 2/2 cells that were retained in blood vessels; these animals showed a deteriorating clinical phenotype and were difficult to perfuse despite large volumes of saline administration. Overall, the histology revealed a high degree of tissue injury in lymphoid compartments of WNV-infected Ifnar 2/2 and CD11c Cre + Ifnar f/f mice that reflected enhanced infection of cells lacking IFNAR expression. Tissue destruction in some organs, however, did not appear commensurate with the level of viral antigen present in the tissue parenchyma.",

The relative staining of IFNAR on CD11c + CD8 + CD3 2 , CD11c + CD4 + CD3 2 and CD19 + CD11c 2 CD3 2 is shown.

The elevated serum BUN and creatinine values indicate that WNV-infected Ifnar 2/2 and CD11c Cre + Ifnar f/f mice experienced acute renal injury. The elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST) reflect acute hepatic injury, which could be due to direct viral infection (although not seen by IHC), immunemediated injury, or ischemia. The observed hypoglycemia may be secondary to depleted glycogen stores, impaired gluconeogenesis, or increased peripheral glucose utilization that occurs during infection or sepsis [29] . Similarly elevated serum levels of AST and ALT and decreased levels of glucose were observed in WNVinfected LysM Cre + Ifnar f/f mice, compatible with a syndrome of acute hepatic injury ( Fig. 4C-E) .",

The massive increase in multiple proinflammatory cytokines after WNV infection in Ifnar 2/2 and CD11c or LysM Cre + Ifnar f/f mice coupled with renal and hepatic injury and low viral antigen staining in tissues suggested a picture of sepsis due to ''cytokine storm''. In comparison, relatively small increases in only six of the cytokines were observed in CHIKV infected Ifnar 2/2 and Cre 2 Ifnar f/f mice ( Fig. S1 and Table S1 ).",

Analysis of viremia revealed ,10 3 to 10 6 -fold higher levels in Ifnar 2/2 (1.6610 8 FFU/ml, P = 0.03), Mavs 2/2 (4.4610 5 FFU/ml, P = 0.03), and Mavs 2/2 6Ifnar 2/2 DKO (2.0610 8 FFU/ml, P = 0.03) mice compared to WT (2.3610 2 FFU/ml) mice (Fig. 6A) . Among CD11c + cells isolated from the spleen, a similar percentage of cells were infected with WNV in Ifnar 2/2 , Mavs 2/2 , and Mavs 2/2 6Ifnar 2/2 DKO mice compared to WT mice (Fig. 6B) . We next measured cytokine levels at 48 hours after WNV infection of Ifnar 2/2 , Mavs 2/2 , Mavs 2/2 6Ifnar 2/2 DKO, and WT mice ( Fig. 6C and Table 2 ). Only serum from the Ifnar 2/2 mice revealed the profile of elevated cytokine levels. Microarray analysis from the spleens of WNVinfected Ifnar 2/2 , Mavs 2/2 , Mavs 2/2 6Ifnar 2/2 DKO, and WT mice ( Fig. 6D ) corroborated these findings. mRNA levels of cytokines associated with NF-kB and inflammasome activation (e.g., TNF-a, IL-6, IL-1\u00df, and IL-33) were elevated in the spleens of Ifnar 2/2 mice compared to Mavs 2/2 , Mavs 2/2 6Ifnar 2/2 DKO, or WT mice. To further define the linkage between MAVS and cytokine production, we infected bone marrow derived DCs (BMDCs) from Ifnar 2/2 , Mavs 2/2 , Mavs 2/2 6Ifnar 2/2 DKO, and WT mice. As anticipated, higher levels of WNV infection were observed in Ifnar 2/2 , Mavs 2/2 , Mavs 2/2 6Ifnar 2/2 DKO cells compared to WT cells (Fig. 6E) . At 24 and 48 hours, we detected lower amounts of phosphorylation of the p65 subunit NF-kB in Ifnar 2/2 BMDC (Fig. 6F) . A deficiency of MAVS alone, however, did not reduce p65 phosphorylation substantially indicating the existence of MAVS-dependent and -independent (yet IFNAR-dependent) pathways for NF-kB activation after WNV infection. In the absence of both MAVS and IFNAR, there was noticeably reduced p65 phosphorylation, as well as lower levels of IL-1\u00df, IL-6, CCL5, and other ISGs (IFIT1, IFIT2, and IFIT3) mRNA (Fig. S2) ; these results in BMDCs were consistent with the decrease in NF-kB-dependent cytokines produced in Mavs 2/2 6Ifnar 2/2 DKO compared to Ifnar 2/2 mice. The elevated expression of IFIT genes in WNV-infected Ifnar 2/2 mice was not unexpected; even though IFIT genes are ISGs, their expression can be induced directly by IRF-3 [38, 39] . In Ifnar 2/2 BMDCs, the increase in WNV infection results in enhanced RNA PAMP generation, MAVS signaling, and IRF-3 nuclear translocation, which induces IFIT genes independently of the IFN signaling pathway.",

This observation suggested that PRR signaling through MAVS was required for inflammasome activation. Prior studies had established that NLRP3 is the key Nod-like receptor inducing IL-1b and restricting WNV infection in mice [17] . To test whether the increase in IL-1b levels observed in WNV-infected Ifnar 2/2 mice was due to excess triggering of the NLRP3 inflammasome, we used a MAb (MAR1-5A3) to block IFNAR signaling in WT or Nlrp3 2/2 BMDCs and mice. At 48 hours after WNV infection, Western blot analysis revealed reduced amounts of cleaved IL-1\u00df in the MAR1-5A3-treated Nlrp3 2/2 compared to MAR1-5A3 treated-WT BMDC (Fig. S3A ) despite equivalent levels of viral replication (Fig. S3B) . Consistent with this, blockade of type I IFN signaling resulted in enhanced mRNA expression of IL1\u00df (and other cytokines, IL-6, and TNF-a) in WT but not Nlrp3 2/2 BMDCs infected with WNV (Fig. S3C) . In vivo, serum cytokine levels were higher in WNV-infected WT and Nlrp3 2/2 mice treated with MAR1-5A3 compared to those receiving the isotype control MAb (Fig. S3D) . However, with the exception of IL-1\u00df and possibly IL-6, cytokine levels in WNV-infected MAR1-5A3 treated Nlrp3 2/2 and WT mice were similar ( Fig. S3D and data not shown). Although inflammasome activation generates vasoactive cytokines, in the context of the enhanced WNV replication in Ifnar-signaling deficient animals, this did not contribute to visceral organ injury. Consistent with this, inflammasome assembly or signaling deficient animals (Nlpr3 2/2 , IL1r 2/2 , or caspase-1/11 2/2 mice) that were treated with MAR1-5A3 sustained similar gross and microscopic liver and renal injury compared to WT mice treated with MAR1-5A3 or Ifnar 2/2 mice ( Fig. S3E -G, and data not shown).",

            "text": "Cre + Ifnar f/f mice To assess whether the inflammatory response contributed to the multi-organ injury and lethality, we neutralized TNF-a activity (Fig. 7A) . Administration of a TNF-a blocking MAb (200 mg), which inhibited both soluble and cell surface-associated forms [40] , one day prior to infection increased the median survival time of Ifnar 2/2 (from 3 to 5 days, P = 0.002) and CD11c Cre + Ifnar f/f (from 3 to 8 days, P = 0.0009) mice. To support of our hypothesis that the multi-organ failure induced by ''cytokine storm'' contributed to disease in the Ifnar 2/2 and CD11c Cre + Ifnar f/f mice, we measured viral titers in the serum of anti-TNF-a and isotype control MAb treated mice (Fig. 7B) . Viremia at 48 hours post infection was not different suggesting that the beneficial effect of anti-TNF-a therapy was not due to effects on viral replication. Analysis of blood chemistries at 48 hours after infection of the CD11c Cre + Ifnar f/f and Ifnar 2/2 mice following anti-TNF-a treatment revealed improved AST, ALT, and glucose levels that were not different from WNV-infected Cre 2 Ifnar f/f control mice Table 3 ). Cytokine analysis at 48 hours after infection showed reduced serum levels of 13 cytokines following anti-TNF-a MAb treatment in both the Ifnar 2/2 and CD11c Cre + Ifnar f/f mice ( Table 4) . Although reduced levels of IL-1\u00df and IL-6 were observed in Ifnar 2/2 mice after anti-TNF-a MAb treatment, five cytokines (IL-2, IL-12p40, GM-CSF, Rantes (CCL5), and MIP1-\u00df (CCL4)) that were decreased in CD11c Cre + Ifnar f/f mice were not altered in Ifnar 2/2 mice. Thus, TNF-a blockade can reduce induction of most but not all of the proinflammatory cytokines, and this correlated with Cre + Ifnar f/f and Ifnar 2/2 animals succumbing to WNV infection less rapidly (Fig. 7A ).",

            "text": "Humans infected with Dengue virus, a closely related flavivirus, develop vascular leakage and sepsis syndrome and have evidence of extensive complement activation in their plasma and tissues [41] [42] [43] . Prior studies also have established that TNF-a regulates expression of complement genes in myeloid cells [44] . We hypothesized that complement activation and production of anaphylatoxins (e.g., C3a and C5a) might be induced by TNF-a and contribute to disease pathogenesis in WNV-infected CD11c-Cre + Ifnar f/f mice. To evaluate this hypothesis, we first assessed mRNA levels of individual complement components in the spleen and liver of WNV-infected WT, Mavs 2/2 , Ifnar 2/2 , and Mavs 2/2 6Ifnar 2/2 DKO mice. Notably, C3 and factor B (fB) levels were greater in WNV-infected Ifnar 2/2 mice compared to the other genotypes ( Fig. 8A) suggesting that expression of key complement components was regulated via a MAVS-dependent pathway. We next examined complement activation in serum by assessing levels of complement proteins and split products by Western blot and ELISA. At 24 to 48 hours after WNV infection, levels of C3, fB, and their cleaved products of (C3-a2 and Ba) were higher in Ifnar 2/2 and CD11c-Cre + Ifnar f/f mice compared to WT mice (Fig. 8B) . These results confirm the induction of key complement proteins and activation of the complement cascade in vivo. In contrast, C3 and fB cleavage products were decreased or absent in the serum of WNV-infected Mavs 2/2 or Ifnar 2/2 6Mavs 2/2 DKO mice at 48 hours (Fig. 8C) , indicating that RLR signaling through MAVS was required for complement induction and activation. Consistent with a role for complement contributing to pathogenesis, liver injury at 48 hours was minimized in WNV-infected C3 2/2 and fB 2/2 mice given the IFNAR-blocking MAb MAR1-5A3 compared to similarly-treated WT mice. Analysis of blood chemistries after WNV infection of MAR1-5A3 treated C3 2/2 and fB 2/2 mice revealed normal AST and ALT values, compared to MAR1-5A3 treated C57BL/6 control mice (Fig. 8D) , even though viremia and cytokine levels remained elevated ( Fig. 8E and F). While liver injury persisted in MAR1-5A3-treated Mbl-a 2/2 6Mbl-c 2/2 DKO or C4 2/2 mice, indicating that disease was induced primarily by the alterative and not classical or lectin pathways of complement activation, glycemia was restored to normal levels. A partial phenotype also was observed in MAR1-5A3-treated C3aR 2/2 mice, which delete the receptor for the complement anaphylatoxin C3a: Cytokine (IL-1\u00df, IL-6, and TNFa) and liver enzymes levels remained elevated in the serum but glucose levels normalized (Fig. S4) . In comparison, treatment of CD11c-Cre + Ifnar f/f mice with neutralizing MAbs against C5 reduced liver injury and prevented hypoglycemia compared to animals administered isotype control MAbs (Fig. 8G) . To link our findings showing TNF-a signaling and complement activation contribute to WNV-induced disease and sepsis, we assessed complement activation in WNV-infected CD11c-Cre + Ifnar f/f mice treated with blocking anti-TNF-a MAbs. Lower levels of C3 and factor B split-products (C3-a2, C3a, and Ba) were observed in the serum and plasma of mice administered blocking TNF-a compared to isotype control MAbs ( Fig. 8H and I) . These experiments place pathologic complement activation downstream of viral infection, MAVS signaling, and TNF-a signaling and indicate that it contributes to the sepsis-like syndrome.",

            "text": "Although the contribution of type I IFN signaling to the control of viral infection in vivo is established, its importance in specific cell subsets remains less well understood. We evaluated the function of type I IFN signaling in myeloid cells in vivo against WNV infection. We targeted these cells because prior studies had indicated that WNV replicated preferentially in CD11b + and CD11c + cells [12, 45] . A striking phenotype was observed after WNV infection of CD11c or LysM Cre + Ifnar f/f mice, as these animals succumbed with a similar rate and kinetics compared to the complete gene deletion Ifnar 2/2 mice. In contrast, deletion of IFNAR expression only on B cells (CD19 Cre + Ifnar f/f ) showed a phenotype after WNV infection that resembled the Cre 2 Ifnar f/f mice. Viral burden in several organs of CD11c Cre + Ifnar f/f mice was markedly elevated and approached that seen in Ifnar 2/2 mice. performed to determine the genes that had different expression levels with infection compared to levels in mock infections for each of the four mouse strains (1.5 fold change cut-off). Quantitative analysis of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines is shown on the right. E. WT, Ifnar 2/2 , Mavs 2/2 , Ifnar 2/2 6Mavs 2/2 DKO BMDCs were infected with WNV and 0, 24 or 48 hours later viral burden in the supernatant was measured. The data are the mean of three independent experiments. Error bars indicate SD. Asterisks denote statistical significance relative to WT cells (*, P,0.05; **, P,0.01). F. Western blot showing phospho-p65 and total (relative) p65 staining in WT, Mavs 2/2 , Ifnar 2/2 , Ifnar 2/2 6Mavs 2/2 DKO BMDCs at 0 (M, mock), 24 Our experiments revealed a dominant antiviral effect in vivo of type I IFN signaling in myeloid cells, either CD11c + cells or M\u00d8/ monocytes/granulocytes. Pathological analyses showed preferential WNV infection of Ifnar 2/2 myeloid cells, and this resulted in ''cytokine storm'', which was associated with liver and kidney damage, and rapid death. High levels of WNV RNA in Ifnar 2/2 myeloid cells triggered uncontrolled production of proinflammatory cytokines, pathological complement induction and activation, which together caused a sepsis-like syndrome. This phenotype did not occur universally: whereas 100% of Ifnar 2/2 mice succumbed to infection with the arthritogenic CHIKV alphavirus, no disease or lethality was observed in CD11c or LysM Cre + Ifnar f/f mice. The phenotype after WNV infection of CD11c or LysM Cre + Ifnar f/f mice varies from that observed after infection with MHV [20] or MNoV [22] . In the MHV study, increased vulnerability was observed in LysM Cre + Ifnar f/f mice but it did not recapitulate that seen in Ifnar 2/2 mice. In comparison, deletion on Ifnar on CD11c + cells resulted in only a subset (,30%) of animals dying, and this occurred almost a week later. In the MNoV study, IFNAR-dependent responses in M\u00d8 and DCs limited viral Cre + Ifnar f/f and Ifnar 2/2 mice. A. Eight-to ten-week-old CD11c Cre + Ifnar f/f and Ifnar 2/2 mice were injected via an intraperitoneal route with 200 mg of anti-TNF-a or isotype control MAbs one day prior to infection with 10 2 PFU of WNV by footpad injection. Survival differences were statistically significant between anti-TNF-a and isotype control MAb-treated CD11c Cre + Ifnar f/f mice (***, P,0.0001) and anti-TNF-a and isotype control MAb-treated Ifnar 2/2 mice (***, P,0.0001). The data is pooled from two independent experiments (n = 8 for all groups). B. Viral burden in serum. Eight-to ten-week-old CD11c Cre + Ifnar f/f and Ifnar 2/2 mice were injected with 200 mg of anti-TNF-a or isotype control MAb and Cre 2 Ifnar f/f were left untreated one day prior to infection with 10 2 PFU of WNV. Infectious virus in the serum was determined from samples harvested at 48 hours post-infection. Differences were not statistically different. C. Eight-to tenweek-old CD11c Cre + Ifnar f/f and Ifnar 2/2 mice were administered 200 mg of anti-TNF-a or isotype control MAb via an intraperitoneal route one day prior to inoculation of 10 2 PFU of WNV by footpad injection. Glucose (GLU), AST, and ALT levels were analyzed from serum obtained 48 hours after infection. The data are pooled from two independent experiments (n = 8 for all groups). Asterisks indicate differences that are statistically significant (*, P,0.05; **, P,0.01). doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1004086.g007 infection but were dispensable for preventing lethal infection, as all MNoV-infected CD11c or LysM Cre + Ifnar f/f animals survived in contrast to Ifnar 2/2 mice. Systemic cytokine levels were not measured in either study. Related to these findings, cell typerestricted deletion of Stat1 in M\u00d8, monocytes, and granulocytes (LysM Cre + Stat1 f/f ) but not DCs (CD11c Cre + Stat1 f/f ) resulted in enhanced lethality after Listeria monocytogenes infection [20, 21] . Higher levels of cytokines and chemokines were observed in Listeria-infected LysM Cre + Stat1 f/f mice, although they were lower than in infected Stat1 2/2 mice. Analogous to our studies, Listeriainfected mice lacking IFNAR expression on M\u00d8 also sustained liver damage. Thus, loss of IFNAR expression in distinct populations of cells can enhance pathogenesis of viral and bacterial pathogens, although the level of mortality and cytokine production can vary.",

While the susceptibility phenotype is related to the higher levels of WNV replication, the contribution of cytokines was not assessed. Although we measured high viral titers in the serum, organs, and brains of CD11c Cre + Ifnar f/f and Ifnar 2/2 mice, IHC revealed less viral antigen staining in the brain parenchyma than anticipated by the viral titer data. This suggested to us that (a) the high levels of WNV in brain homogenates could be due to infected cells in the intravascular space that were not removed despite extensive perfusion; and/or (b) although CD11c Cre + Ifnar f/f , LysM Cre + Ifnar f/f and Ifnar 2/2 mice rapidly succumbed to WNV, it might not be due to infection in the brain. Indeed, high levels of TNF-a and IL-1\u00df and other proinflammatory cytokines were present in the serum of CD11c or LysM Cre + Ifnar f/f and Ifnar 2/2 mice but not in infected Cre 2 Ifnar f/f mice at 48 hours. Vasoactive cytokines affect blood vessel permeability and vascular tone [47, 48] , and could have limited perfusion in the CD11c Cre + Ifnar f/f and Ifnar 2/2 mice. Our results are most consistent with a model in which cytokine-mediated changes to the vasculature limited organ perfusion and resulted in high titers that reflect viral burden in blood rather than replication within the parenchyma of some tissues.",

Our studies in CD11c Cre + Ifnar f/f and Ifnar 2/2 mice revealed that serum levels of twenty different inflammatory cytokines were elevated at 48 hours after WNV inoculation. Loss of type I IFN signaling on the CD11c + or other myeloid cells affected viral tropism and resulted in dysregulated cytokine responses after WNV infection.

Inflammasome activation requires two signals: signal 1 induces transcription of IL-1b (reviewed in [52] ) and signal 2 promotes assembly of a multiprotein complex that activates caspase-1 to cleave IL-1\u00df and IL-18 to their mature forms [53] .

Liver injury was minimized in WNV-infected C3 2/2 , fB 2/2 , and C5-depleted mice lacking type I IFN signaling, indicating that tissue damage required activation of the alternative complement pathway. A survival benefit was not observed in WNV-infected C3 2/2 , fB 2/2 , and C5-depleted mice lacking type I IFN signaling (A. Pinto and M.

Associated with WNV infection of CD11c Cre + Ifnar f/f and Ifnar 2/2 mice, we observed massive activation of complement including accumulation of C3 and fB split products. The induction of C3, fB, and other complement proteins in the spleen and liver occurred after WNV infection in a MAVSdependent manner. Indeed, in the serum of mice lacking MAVS alone or MAVS and IFNAR, we failed to observe the accumulation of C3 and fB cleavage products after WNV infection. These and other results place complement induction and/or activation downstream of TNF-a, possibly through direct actions on myeloid cells and/or hepatocytes. We propose a model for virus-induced sepsis-like syndrome (Fig. 9 ) in which infection in myeloid cells results in excessive viral RNA production, RIG-I and/or MDA5 recognition, MAVS signaling, NF-kB activation, proinflammatory cytokine production (including TNF-a), complement protein induction, alternative pathway activation, and complement anaphylatoxin production. Enhanced infection in myeloid cells could occur because of experimental blockade or genetic deficiency of IFNAR or through virus-induced immune evasion mechanisms; many human viruses target and disenable key components of the type I IFN signaling cascade [68] [69] [70] [71] . As recent studies with bacterial sepsis models also suggest key roles for fB and complement peptides in mediating vascular leakage and hemodynamic instability [72] [73] [74] , pharmacological blockade of C3a and C5a might mitigate the sepsis-like syndrome after viral infections, including the more globally relevant flavivirus, Dengue virus.",

An absence of IFNAR signaling in myeloid cells facilitated WNV infection and caused MAVSdependent dysregulated cytokine responses that promoted induction and activation of the alternative complement pathway, which resulted in tissue injury. As different viruses antagonize IFNAR function by targeting distinct steps in the downstream signaling pathway including Jak1, Tyk2, Stat1, and Stat2 phosphorylation (reviewed in [75] ), this model of infection and inflammation may be relevant in the context of other infections. Given these findings, targeted anti-cytokine and/or immunomodulatory agents may be a possible therapeutic option when sepsis is induced by massive viral infection in subsets of myeloid cells.",

After a 4 minute incubation at room temperature (RT) the samples were heated at 65uC for 4 minutes. The samples were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE using Tris-Glycine running buffer and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked overnight with 5% nonfat dried milk in Trisborate saline (TBS) buffer. Primary goat anti-mouse C3 (1/10,000 dilution; MP Biomedicals) or goat anti-human factor B (1/5,000 dilution; Complement Technology, Inc.) antibodies were incubated with the membranes for 1.5 hours at RT.

Myeloid cells that lack signaling (due to Ifnar gene deletion, pharmacological blockade with anti-IFNAR MAbs, or IFN signaling antagonism by viruses) are more susceptible to infection. In the context of WNV infection, increased viral replication results in enhanced RNA PAMP generation, which activates MAVS via recruitment to the mitochondria. This results in downstream activation of IRF-3 and NF-kB and also assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome. IRF-3 activation and nuclear translocation promotes induction of a limited set of ISGs. NF-kB activation and nuclear translocation promotes expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-6 and TNF-a) and chemokines (CCL5 and CXCL10). Soluble TNF-a can modulate endothelial cells function and integrity and also induce complement factor expression in myeloid and hepatic cells, including C3 and factor B. Higher levels of C3 and factor B in the context of increased WNV in plasma results in excessive complement activation (via the alternative pathway), which can liberate the C3a and C5a anaphylatoxins. Along with TNF-a, these promote changes to vascular permeability and tone that result in hypotension and visceral organ (e.g., liver and kidney) damage. Independently, excessive virus infection in restricted tissues (e.g., spleen and LN) can cause organ damage. The pathological effects of this cascade can be mitigated by administration of blocking MAbs to TNF-a or C5. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1004086.g009",
