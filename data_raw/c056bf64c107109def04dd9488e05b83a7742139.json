However, little is known about microbial changes during cryptosporidiosis, one of the most important diarrhoeal diseases caused by protozoa in cattle. In this study, alterations in the faecal microbiota of neonatal calves as a result of Cryptosporidium parvum infection were investigated on a C. parvum-positive farm. Comparisons were made among groups of C. parvum-infected, rotavirus-infected, and the pathogen-negative calves. A specific increase in the abundance of Fusobacterium was observed in the faecal microbiota of C. parvum-infected animals. Diarrhoea severity increased in accordance with the abundance of C. parvum and Fusobacterium. Moreover, the specific increase of Fusobacterium appeared to be a universal feature of C. parvum infection, since neonatal calves from geographically separated areas showed the same result. These observations indicated that the growth of Fusobacterium may be an important aggravating factor of cryptosporidiosis.",

The parasite is widely distributed and is a common cause of severe neonatal diarrhoea among calves, with cryptosporidiosis being one of the most important infectious diarrhoeal diseases caused by protozoa for the cattle industry. While cryptosporidiosis is usually mild and self-limiting in immunocompetent humans, individuals with various immune disorders, including acquired immune deficiency syndrome, often contract chronic, life-threating infections 12 . While nitazoxanide has been licensed for the treatment of Cryptosporidium-induced diarrhoea in humans 13 , its efficacy in calves remains unclear 14 . Although one study reported beneficial effects of nitazoxanide in the treatment of cryptosporidiosis in experimentally-infected neonatal calves 15 , another study revealed no prophylactic or therapeutic efficacy 16 . Therefore, clinical disease control in calves has been hampered by the lack of drugs and vaccines that are effective for either treatment or prevention of cryptosporidiosis 17, 18 .",

Moreover, a study using severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice supported the hypothesis that resistance of adult mice to C. parvum infection does not require a specific immune response but can be mediated by nonspecific mechanisms associated with the presence of intestinal microflora 20 . This hypothesis was based on results showing that C. parvum was not readily detected in flora-bearing adult SCID mice, while germfree SCID mice were heavily infected following challenge with the parasite 20 . These observations indicate that some interaction occurs between C. parvum and the faecal microbiota in infected hosts.",

In calves, probiotic administration or the use of lactic acid bacteria has been identified as a tool to maintain the intestinal microbial balance and to prevent the establishment of opportunistic pathogens 28 . Therefore, dietary differences between farms, especially in the presence or absence of probiotic Table S1 ).

However, in this study, the specific increase of Fusobacterium was observed not only in animals from farm #A, but also in calves from completely different locations (Table 1, Fig. 3 ). This suggests that the growth of Fusobacterium is a common feature among C. parvum-positive calves, regardless of differences in diet and environmental conditions between farms. www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ The oocyst shedding pattern of C. parvum observed in this study (Fig. 4a ) was similar to those recorded in previous reports 29, 30 . Interestingly, the initiation of oocyst shedding (at 8 days old) appeared to coincided with the increase of Fusobacterium (at 8 days old) (Fig. 4a) . The protozoan infection occurred prior to the increase in Fusobacterium growth because the oocyst incubation period in dairy cattle is 3 to 6 days prior to shedding 11 . Moreover, the relative ratios of the bacteria tended to increase in accordance with increasing numbers of oocysts (Fig. 4b) . These observations suggest that the increase in C. parvum may benefit the growth of Fusobacterium. The beneficial interaction between these two microbes appeared to be universal based on the strong positive correlation between C. parvum and Fusobacterium observed in faecal samples from different origins (Fig. 3) .",

Challenge of human volunteers with C. parvum showed that the number of oocysts excreted in faeces was significantly higher in subjects with diarrhoea than in those with enteric symptoms but no diarrhoea 31 . In addition, a previous study on risk factors for neonatal calf diarrhoea caused by C. parvum reported a significant association between high oocyst number and the occurrence of diarrhoea 32 . In the present study, faecal scores appeared to worsen (Fig. 4a ) with corresponding increases in the abundance of both C. parvum (Fig. 4a) and Fusobacterium (Figs 2a and 4a) . Therefore, the increase of Fusobacterium appears to be an important aggravating factor for cryptosporidiosis because the growth of the bacterium increases the C. parvum load in neonatal calves (Figs 3b and 4b ). An animal model using neonatal calves for C. parvum challenge will be required in the future to gather direct evidence of the co-increase of C. parvum and Fusobacterium.",

Damage to microvilli on the surface of intestinal epithelial cells caused by the growth of C. parvum increases susceptibility to Fusobacterium infection. Fusobacterium then becomes a dominant genus and grows effectively because of its ability to adhere to and invade intestinal cells [33] [34] [35] , which may cause severe diarrhoea in cattle. Because this hypothesis remains unconfirmed, a pathological analysis of intestinal cells is needed to understand the beneficial interaction between C. parvum and Fusobacterium.",

A previous study showed that a 2-week course of combination antibiotic therapy (amoxicillin, 1,500 mg; tetracycline, 1,500 mg; and metronidazole, 750 mg/day) reduces the density of F. varium in the mucosa, resulting in a higher remission rate in the treatment group compared with the control group 38 . The present study suggests that this kind of antibiotic therapy targeting Fusobacterium may also relieve the severity of diarrhoea in cryptosporidiosis cases. This is the first study to reveal a significant correlation between Fusobacterium and C. parvum in cases of neonatal calf diarrhoea. The increase of Fusobacterium in the faecal microbiota is likely to be an important aggravating factor of cryptosporidiosis in calves. This novel finding may contribute to the development of improved control strategies for cryptosporidiosis.",

An average value for the relative abundance across the six sampling points for each genus is shown using a gradient scale. (a) The 261 analysed genera(Table S2)were plotted as rows in which the most abundant genus in the C. parvum-only infected group is shown at the top. The next most abundant genera are shown sequentially in order of abundance. (b) The 10 most abundant genera (shown on the left-hand side) in the C. parvum-only-infected group in comparison with the corresponding abundances in the rotavirusonly-infected and pathogen-negative groups. The top 10 genera were obtained from (a). A specific increase of Fusobacterium in the C. parvum-only-infected group was suggested.
