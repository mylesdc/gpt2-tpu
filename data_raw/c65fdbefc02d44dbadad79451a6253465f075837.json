Among these pathogens are a group of viruses that belong to Coronaviridae. Coronaviridae is a family of enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses that are usually characterized by an enveloped, spherical particle with a diameter in the range of 120-160 nm and a crown-like appearance 2 . Coronaviruses usually cause respiratory tract infections, pneumonia, gastroenteritis, epidemic diarrhoea, enteric infections, hepatitis, encephalomyelitis, and kidney failure. Their hosts include humans, porcines, bovines, murines, avians, and other animals. In the past 12 years, two emerging infectious diseases-severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-attacked humans and animals worldwide and caused approximately 774 human deaths and 315 human deaths, respectively (http://www.who.int/csr/sars/ country/table2004_04_21/en/, http://www.who.int/csr/don/2014_07_23_mers/en/).

Among all proteins encoded by the coronavirus, the spike protein on the virion surface is the most critical protein, as it mediates both cell attachment and membrane fusion; a few nucleotide changes on the spike gene can cause interspecies transmission 6 . The spike protein primarily consists of three segments, i.e., an ectodomain, a transmembrane anchor, and a short intracellular tail. The ectodomain has two subunits for invading hosts: S1 is responsible for binding receptors and S2 is responsible for membrane fusion 7 . A receptor-binding domain (RBD) near the C-terminal of S1 is primarily responsible for receptor recognition.

According to probability principles, a shorter nucleotide fragment has a lower chance of variation due to evolution, and the copies of this fragment in a genome tend not to change significantly. This phenomenon is helpful for evolutionary analysis. Dinucleotides are the most stable of these fragments because they are the shortest, and their bias values are usually diverse among species and they are highly invariant for a given individual genome 9 . Dinucleotide abundance has been proven to be reliable in the identification and classification of sequences from viral genomes [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . Support vector machines (SVMs) are a group of supervised machine learning methods that were originally introduced by Vapnik as a linear classifier 18 . Their current standard incarnation (soft margin) comprises associated learning algorithms for classification and regression analysis 19 . The basic principle of class separation for a SVM is mapping vectors into a high-dimensional feature space and finding an optimal separating hyperplane between the two classes in this space by maximizing the margin between the classes' closest points. The points on the boundaries are referred to as support vectors, and the middle of the margin is the optimal separating hyperplane, which forms the largest gap between two sets of data 20 . Based on this gap, the points of different attributes fall into different classes. Several types of algorithms exist for a SVM to address classification problems for multiple classes and high-dimension data. SVMs perform well in multiple areas of biological analysis, including the evaluation of microarray expression data, the detection of remote protein homologies, and the recognition of translation initiation sites 21 . Instances in which the established classification is questionable or wrong can be identified if an SVM is used for prediction of training samples.",

All parameters show significant differences across the host groups (Kruskal-Wallis tests, p < 2.2e-16); therefore, they were subsequently employed as factors in statistical models for discriminant analyses. Empirically, a dinucleotide relative abundance or dinucleotide bias (e.g., \u03c1 xy ) is significantly high if \u03c1 \u2265 . . Among the 16 dinucleotides in this study, the CpA and TpG show an average abundance that is significantly higher than the expected values (\u03c1 CA = 1.29, \u03c1 TG = 1.28), whereas the average bias of CpG is extremely low (\u03c1 CG = 0.44). This result indicates that the observed abundances of CpA and TpG are significantly higher than their expected values, and the observed abundance of CpG is significantly lower than the expected value. The G+ C content is minimal (31-47%) . This finding indicates that coronaviruses exhibit a low density of nucleotide sequences and may be sensitive to heat or alkali.

The sequences of these coronaviruses (civet-CoVs) are similar not only to each other but also to SARS-CoV. Cross-host evolution research of SARS-CoV in palm civet and humans indicated that the variations in spike genes seemed to be essential for the transition of coronavirus from animal-to-human transmission to human-to-human transmission 25 . In addition to cross-neutralization with SARS-CoV, these SARS-like civet-CoVs can use human ACE2 as an entry receptor 26 . Bats are the reservoir hosts of a number of coronaviruses, and a recent study also suggests that bats are natural reservoirs of these SARS-like coronaviruses, whereas palm civets and humans are intermediate hosts 1 . All hosts predicted by the SVM are humans, which supports the previously mentioned research.

Samples 42-44 (RsSHC014, Rs3367 and SL-CoV-WIV1) consist of three SARS-like coronaviruses from bats 30 . Analyses based on the sequence similarities and cultures in the cell lines suggest that Rs3367 and SL-CoV-WIV1 are capable of using a SARS-CoV receptor for cell entry and pose a threat to humans, whereas RsSHC014 cannot 30 . Our study provides a precise support to these conclusions.

Our analysis supports the finding that this coronavirus is capable of infecting bovine. These analyses imply that this strain is capable of interspecies transmission between bovines and alpacas. Samples 46 and 47 are enteric coronaviruses from bovines and humans; they have been identified as the same strain named \"Human enteric coronavirus 4408\" in the NCBI database due to the similarity between their spike protein sequences of 99.9%. Although they are similar to the human coronavirus OC43 and the bovine coronavirus, evidences from morphological, immunological, and genomic studies indicate that they are closer to bovine coronavirus than to human coronavirus (unpublished research, from personal communication). This finding is consistent with our analysis. In addition, avian and bat are worthy of attentions as potential hosts due to the small MD values.",

These dinucleotide biases are common characteristics of RNA viruses in vertebrates 11, 12, 15, 16 . As most vertebrates exhibit a very low CpG representation in genomes, RNA viruses may gradually adapt to the accumulation of host mutations and mimic the host gene's dinucleotide patterns for survival 11 . For DNA viruses, the most-accepted mechanisms for the suppression of CpG dinucleotides are the methylation of CpG nucleotides and the subsequent deamination of 5-methylcytosine, which renders CpG a mutational hotspot 24 . For RNA viruses, a different hypothesis is that the RNA viruses encounter different selection pressures when they switch to a new host, and viral RNA genes mimic host mRNAs to avoid immune detection 11 . Similar to other human ssRNA viruses, coronaviruses show a strong correlation between CpG pressure and C+ G content (Pearson's correlation coefficient, r = 0.5443, p < 2.2e-16, our data). A lower C+ G content usually indicates that the nucleotide sequence of the virus is unstable or is highly variable under evolutionary selection pressure. Considering that the mutation rates for RNA viruses are significantly higher than the mutation rates for DNA viruses 32 , mutational pressure may be the most important determinant of the bias in codon usage in human RNA viruses, such as coronaviruses 14 .",

Unlike the Euclidian distance (ED), which measures the absolute distance between points or mass centres in space, the Mahalanobis distance considers the variances within a population and the covariance between variables. In some cases, especially when a population with individuals who are scattered across a wide range is located close to a \"tight\" population with smaller internal variations, the MD may classify marginal individuals from the latter into the \"loose\" population even if they are \"close\" to a \"tight\" population according to the ED. The MD enables \"loose\" populations to have a greater number of points. The SVM has a different philosophy. SVM separates populations by finding a hyperplane that maximizes the distances between populations. When a \"loose\" population is close to the boundary of a \"tight\" population, SVM is more likely to find this hyperplane within the former. This finding explains SVM's tendency to exclude outliers from a \"loose\" population.",
