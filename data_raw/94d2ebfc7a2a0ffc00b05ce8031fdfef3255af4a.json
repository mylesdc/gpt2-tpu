The patient returned from Angola, a non-epidemic country, with an infection of a new reassortant from different lineages of Rift Valley fever viruses (RVFVs). The patient developed multiorgan dysfunction and gradually recovered with continuous renal replacement therapy and a short regimen of methylprednisolone treatment. The disordered cytokines and chemokines in the plasma of the patient revealed hypercytokinemia, but the levels of protective cytokines were low upon admission and fluctuated as the disease improved. Whole-genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis revealed that the imported strain was a reassortant comprising the L and M genes from lineage E and the S gene from lineage A. This case highlights that RVFV had undergone genetic reassortment, which could potentially alter its biological properties, cause large outbreaks and pose a serious threat to global public health as well as the livestock breeding industry.",

These data confirmed the presence of hypercytokinemia, also known as a 'cytokine storm', which may have contributed to the immunopathogenesis in the patient. In contrast, the levels of cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2, IL-1Ra, IL-2, IL-3, IL-6, IL-7, IL-9, IL-13, IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1, which are correlated with protective immune responses to viruses, were gradually increased in conjunction with the improvement of the symptoms (Figures 3H-3L) . The IL-9, IL-13 and TNF-\u03b1 levels on day 7 were even below the lower end of the 95% CI of healthy controls but increased afterwards (Supplementary Table S1 ). Starting at day 14, the levels of these cytokines gradually reduced concomitant with the amelioration of viremia in the patient, which may reveal the role of the adaptive immune process.

A small percentage of patients develop severe indications including liver failure, renal failure, thrombocytopenia, encephalitis, haemorrhage and miscarriage. [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] For the first case of imported RVF in China, we used high-volume continuous renal replacement therapy, which treated the renal failure, and methylprednisolone, which reduced the inflammation in the patient. 17 In previous studies, 18, 19 the pro-inflammatory mediators IL-1\u03b1, IL-1Ra, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, MIG and IP10 were significantly increased in fatal cases. In our study, 21 cytokines and chemokines in the plasma of the patient were measured upon admission and were higher than the levels in healthy controls, which further demonstrated the contribution of dysregulated inflammatory responses in host individuals to RVFV pathogenesis. The non-structural protein NSs, which is encoded by the S segment of RVFV, has been implicated as the primary virulence factor. NSs can counteract the antiviral effects of the host's type I interferon response. 20, 21 In this patient on day 7 of disease onset, the levels of cytokines related to the protective immune response (Figures 3H-3L) were equal to or lower than normal levels but gradually increased on day 9 concomitant with the improvement of the disease symptoms.

Combined with the phylogenetic evidence and epidemiological data, we propose a model to illustrate the potential source of the imported strain ( Figure 4D ). RVFV was regarded as originating from eastern Africa and was transmitted to southern Africa in the 1950s. 2 The descendants of these eastern African strains, such as the Zimbabwe strain (2373/74) and the South African strain (Kakamas), continued to circulate in southern Africa. In the 1970s, another RVFV lineage (lineage A) with a genetic constellation that differed from that of the southern African lineage swept through several African countries and was also transmitted to southern Africa no later than the 1970s. Genetic reassortment might have occurred between descendants of these two lineages in an unknown host somewhere in southern Africa, which would have given rise to the imported strain described here.",

In addition, whether this reassortment was responsible for the severe clinical outcomes of this patient should be pursued as well.",

The subclinical infection results in long-term RVFV circulation in a wide range of hosts throughout Africa, thus increasing the possibility of the accumulation of genetic mutations in the virus via genetic recombination, genetic reassortment and random point mutations. These 'neglected' viral variants might result in large outbreaks and potentially pose a threat to public health, as we have learned from the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak in western Africa, 22 the 2016 Zika virus outbreak in South America and the Caribbean countries 23 and the 2015 Middle East respiratory syndrome virus outbreak in eastern Asia. 24, 25 Therefore, vaccines and antiviral agents should be developed in order to control these 'neglected' tropical diseases.

The phylogenetic trees constructed using the L, M and S gene sequences of the worldwide RVFVs are displayed in A-C, respectively.
