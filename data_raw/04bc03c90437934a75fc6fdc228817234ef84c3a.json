            "text": "a new immunosuppressive Molecule emodin induces both cD4 + FoxP3 + and cD8 + cD122 + regulatory T cells and suppresses Murine allograft rejection Due to vigorous alloimmunity, an allograft is usually rejected without any conventional immunosuppressive treatment. However, continuous global immunosuppression may cause severe side effects, including tumors and infections. Mounting evidence has shown that cyclosporine (CsA), a common immunosuppressant used in clinic, impedes allograft tolerance by dampening regulatory T cells (Tregs), although it inhibits allograft rejection at the same time. Therefore, it is necessary to seek an alternative immunosuppressive drug that spares Tregs with high efficiency in suppression but low toxicity. In this study, we investigated the capacity of emodin, an anthraquinone molecule originally extracted from certain natural plants, to prolong transplant survival in a mouse model and explored the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying its action. We found that emodin significantly extended skin allograft survival and hindered CD3 + T cell infiltration in the allograft, accompanied by an increase in CD4 + Foxp3 + and CD8 + CD122 + Treg frequencies and numbers but a reduction in effector CD8 + CD44 high CD62L low T cells in recipient mice. Emodin also inhibited effector CD8 + T cells proliferation in vivo. However, CD4 + CD25 + , but not CD8 + CD122 + , Tregs derived from emodin-treated recipients were more potent in suppression of allograft rejection than those isolated from control recipients, suggesting that emodin also enhances the suppressive function of CD4 + CD25 + Tregs. Interestingly, depleting CD25 + Tregs largely reversed skin allograft survival prolonged by emodin while depleting CD122 + Tregs only partially abrogated the same allograft survival. Furthermore, we found that emodin hindered dendritic cell (DC) maturation and reduced alloantibody production posttransplantation. Finally, we demonstrated that emodin inhibited in vitro proliferation of T cells and blocked their mTOR signaling as well. Therefore, emodin may be a novel mTOR inhibitor that suppresses alloimmunity by inducing both CD4 + FoxP3 + and CD8 + CD122 + Tregs, suppressing alloantibody production, and hindering DC maturation. Thus, emodin is a newly emerging immunosuppressant and could be utilized in clinical transplantation in the future. inTrODUcTiOn Organ transplantation is an essential and efficient approach to replacing a dysfunctional organ in patients suffering from an end-stage organ disease. However, allogeneic transplantation induces a series of allograft rejection episodes and immune responses, which are mainly mediated by alloreactive T cells (1, 2) . Therefore, global immunosuppressive agents, such as cyclosporine (CsA), are needed to stop acute allograft rejection by suppressing T cell activation. On the other hand, regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a critical role in maintaining allograft survival or tolerance by inhibiting alloreactive T cell activation (3) while a reduction in their generation or activation contributes to allograft rejection (4) . Although conventional immunosuppressants can prevent acute rejection, they may also cause severe side effects, including tumors and infections. Furthermore, a global immunosuppressive agent, such as CsA, inhibits the generation and function of Tregs (5, 6), likely hindering tolerance induction. Although another global immunosuppressant rapamycin, a typical mTOR inhibitor, can spare Tregs (7, 8) , it may still cause same side effects as other global immunosuppressive agents do. Therefore, it is imperative to seek an alternative immunosuppressant that does not compromise Tregs, yet with high efficiency in suppression, low toxicity, and high affordability. Emodin, 1,3,8-trihydroxy-6-methylanthraquinone, is an active anthraquinone originally isolated from certain natural plants, including Rheum palmatum (9) and Cassia obtusifolia (10) . Emodin has long been used to treat chronic kidney diseases with few side effects (11) . Recently, many studies have also documented laxative effects of emodin as well as its inhibitory effects on tumors (12) , viruses (13) , bacteria (14) , and inflammation (15) without any major side effect. Furthermore, emodin is also available in China at a low cost. Therefore, emodin may exhibit unique advantages over other mTOR inhibitors in terms of the side effect issue and affordability.",

Nevertheless, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying its suppression of liver allograft rejection are unknown. It is also unclear whether emodin suppresses rejection of other types of organ transplants beyond a liver allograft, which may develop spontaneous tolerance. In this study, we found that emodin significantly prolonged survival of a skin allograft, a stringent transplant model. Combined treatments with both emodin and CsA further extended the skin allograft survival. Emodin significantly increased the frequencies of both CD4 + CD25 + and CD8 + CD122 + Tregs while reducing the numbers of effector CD8 + T cells. Furthermore, CD4 + CD25 + Tregs isolated from emodin-treated recipient mice were more potent in suppression of allograft rejection than those derived from control recipients, suggesting that emodin enhances CD4 + CD25 + Treg function.

As shown in Figure 4 , emodin significantly increased the percentages and absolute numbers of CD4 + Foxp3 + Tregs in draining LNs while CsA did the opposite.

To determine the effects of emodin on alloreactive T cell proliferation in vitro, one-way MLR was set up using irradiated Balb/C splenocytes as stimulators and B6-derived T cells as responders. As shown in Figure 10 , either emodin or CsA inhibited T cell proliferation 3 ( Figure 10A ) or 5 days ( Figure 10B ) after MLR culture. Moreover, combined treatments with both emodin and CsA further suppressed T cell proliferation compared to the treatment with emodin or CsA alone. Previous experiments using rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR (22) , have proved that mTOR signal transduction suppresses the development and function of Tregs and that rapamycin promotes CD4 + Foxp3 + Treg generation (23) . Since our results demonstrated that emodin increased the frequencies of CD4 + Foxp3 + Tregs, we determined whether emodin would also induce Tregs by blocking mTOR signaling. T cells were activated in an MLR in the medium without or with emodin for 48 h, and the phosphorylation of p70S6K protein (P-p70S6K) was measured via western blotting. As shown in Figure 10C , emodin effectively inhibited the phosphorylation of downstream protein p70S6K at Ser411 compared to the control group while CsA only slightly reduced its phosphorylation. These results indicate that emodin likely exerts its effects on Treg generation and T cell proliferation through blocking mTOR signaling pathway. 4 | Emodin increases the frequencies and numbers of CD4 + Foxp3 + regulatory T cells (Tregs).

Using a mouse model of skin transplantation, FigUre 6 | Emodin-induced CD4 + CD25 + or CD8 + CD122 + regulatory T cells (Tregs) suppress skin allograft rejection in Rag1 \u2212/\u2212 recipient mice. CD4 + CD25 + or CD8 + CD122 + Tregs were isolated via FACS cell sorting from B6 recipient mice that were transplanted with BALB/c skin and treated with emodin and/or CsA. CD4 + CD25 + (a) or CD8 + CD122 + (B) Tregs (0.4 \u00d7 10 6 ), together with B6-derived na\u00efve CD3 + T cells (2 \u00d7 10 6 ), were adoptively transferred to Rag1 \u2212/\u2212 mice (B6 background) that were then transplanted with a BALB/c skin graft. Skin allograft rejection in Rag1 \u2212/\u2212 recipient mice was observed (n = 7-8 grafts). Our results demonstrated that emodin suppressed effector CD8 + T cell expansion but did not promote CD4 + and CD8 + T cell apoptosis in recipient mice, suggesting that emodin is noncytotoxic in our animal model. However, a previous study showed that emodin induced the apoptosis of Dalton's lymphoma cells in vivo via modulating hydrogen peroxide metabolizing antioxidant enzymes (26) . Although it is unclear why emodin induced the apoptosis of lymphoma cells, but not primary T cells, we speculate that rapidly growing tumor cells may be more vulnerable to mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis than normal primary T cells in wild-type mice.",

They represent only a small fraction of CD4 + T cells and express \u03b1 chain of IL-2 receptor (CD25) FigUre 9 | Emodin hinders dendritic cell (DC) maturation posttransplantation. Draining lymph node (LN) and spleen cells were isolated from B6 recipient mice that were transplanted with BALB/c skin and treated with CsA and/or emodin. 10 days after allogeneic skin transplantation, CD11c + CD86 + (a) and CD11c + CD80 + (B) DCs in recipients were enumerated by flow cytometry. Bar graphs represent the absolute numbers of the DCs. Data were pooled from three separate experiments and presented as means \u00b1 SD (n = 6-9 mice). Data are shown as means \u00b1 SD (n = 6 samples). One representative of three separate experiments is shown. Moreover, western blots for phosphorylated p70S6K and total p70S6K were performed two days after the similar MLR culture (c). GAPDH was used as a loading control. One representing image from three separate experiments is shown. OD values in column graphs were pooled from four separate experiments. Data are presented as means \u00b1 SD (n = 4 bands) after corrections by GAPDH. Results demonstrated that emodin mostly blocked the phosphorylation of p70S6K. (27) (28) (29) . Either induction of endogenous CD4 + CD25 + Tregs or adoptive transfer of exogenous Tregs prevents autoimmune diseases and allograft rejection in animal models (30) (31) (32) (33) (34) (35) (36) (37) . Here, we found that emodin upregulated CD4 + Foxp3 + Tregs in the draining LNs of transplanted mice while CsA reduced their numbers, suggesting that emodin and CsA suppress allograft rejection via a totally different mechanism. CsA is a common immunosuppressant for suppression of allograft rejection through the formation of a cyclosporin-cyclophilin complex and prevention of T cell activation (38) , resulting in reduced IL-2 expression, impaired generation of CD4 + Foxp3 + Tregs (39, 40) and compromised tolerance. In our studies, CsA treatment led to similar reductions in the frequencies and numbers of Tregs, which were reversed by emodin administration, suggesting that emodin can correct the deficiency of CsA in terms of its repression of Tregs. Thus, potential tolerance-breaking effects of CsA may be offset by emodin. It is unclear why the frequencies and numbers of these Tregs in spleens were not affected by emodin. It is possible that an increase in Tregs in the draining LNs of the recipient mice treated with emodin was due to the presence of alloantigen-specific Tregs given that Ag-specific T/Treg cell frequencies are generally lower in spleens than in the draining LNs. On the other hand, depletion of CD4 + Foxp3 + Tregs mostly reversed allograft survival extended by emodin, indicating that suppression of allograft rejection by emodin is mostly dependent on CD4 + Foxp3 + Tregs. Recent studies have shown that CD8 + CD122 + T cells are also Tregs that suppress conventional T cell responses (41) (42) (43) (44) (45) (46) and autoimmune diseases (47, 48) . We have previously demonstrated that CD8 + CD122 + T cells not only are Tregs (49, 50) , but also are more potent in suppression of allograft rejection than conventional CD4 + CD25 + Tregs (21) . In this study, we found that both emodin and CsA significantly increased the frequency of CD8 + CD122 + Tregs in both LNs and spleens of the recipients, indicating that the signaling pathways activating CD8 + CD122 + Tregs are different from those activating CD4 + Foxp3 + Tregs. Interestingly, emodin augmented the absolute number of CD8 + CD122 + Tregs in the LNs, but not the spleen. It is possible that most Tregs induced by emodin migrated to the draining LNs or the allograft. On the other hand, neither emodin nor CsA enhanced the suppressive capacity of CD8 + CD122 + Tregs, implying that emodin-induced CD8 + CD122 + Tregs are not necessarily alloantigen-specific. Furthermore, depletion of CD8 + CD122 + Tregs only partially reversed allograft survival induced by emodin, indicating that inhibition of allograft rejection by emodin is not totally dependent on CD8 + CD122 + Tregs.",

We, therefore, speculated that emodin exerted its suppressive effects on T cell responses via inhibition of mTOR signaling, leading to an increase in the Treg generation. Indeed, we found that emodin-treated T cells exhibited a dramatic decrease in the activation of their mTOR signaling, which is induced by TCR stimulation (51) , and also a reduction in their proliferation, indicating that emodin suppresses allograft rejection by blocking T-cell mTOR signaling, leading to the Treg generation, which in turn prolongs allograft survival.",

In our studies, we found that emodin reduced CD11c + CD86 + DC numbers in LNs of recipient mice while decreasing CD11c + CD80 + DC numbers in spleens of the recipients, suggesting that emodin hinders DC maturation in the context of allotransplantation. It remains to be determined why emodin differentially impacts CD11c + CD86 + and CD11c + CD80 + subsets of DCs in the LNs and spleens of the recipient mice. However, our results are actually consistent with a previous study showing that emodin inhibited DC maturation in vitro (53) , implying that emodin indeed suppresses DC differentiation or maturation. It is also unclear how emodin reduces DC numbers. It is possible that emodin regulates the expression of various tolllike receptors.",

Further, administration of emodin induced both CD4 + FoxP3 + and CD8 + CD122 + Tregs while inhibiting the expansion of effector CD8 + T cells in transplanted mice. Emodin also suppressed alloantibody production and hindered DC maturation posttransplantation. Finally, emodin suppressed T cell proliferation and mTOR signaling in vitro.
