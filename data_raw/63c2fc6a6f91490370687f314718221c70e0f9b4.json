A combination of clinical symptoms and results of presumptive treatment with anti-malarial drugs were some of the definitions for malaria cases at that time. In the study, annual malaria incidence (AMI) was used to replace annual parasite incidence as the outcome variable, so the AMI included both microscopy confirmed cases and cured cases by presumptive treatment. The amount and impact of intervention activities were described for each stage in the process from hyperendemicity to elimination, although the quantitative relationship between AMI and intervention activities was not done because of unavailability of sequential data. In linear regression analysis, independent variables for social and economic development were national GDP in billions of China Yuan (CNY) and urbanization rate (%). In Hekou County, banana growing is major part of the economy, which has changed the environment in terms of malaria transmission. Transition from paddy field to banana plantation reduces breeding sites for mosquito larvae, and insecticides used in growing bananas kills mosquitoes. In this reason, BPA (hectares) was used as an independent variable for environmental changes (Fig. 2) . In order to obtain a more normal distribution of data, all outcome and independent variables were transformed into common logarithms, and then a linear regression analysis was used to analyse relationships of AMI respectively with GDP, urbanization rate, and BPA from 1952 to 2013 [20] . The number of malaria cases during 2014-2015 was zero, so data of the 2 years could not be taken into the analysis model. The rapid development of society and economy has improved health information system and reduced the data bias from 2000 to 2015, so the analysis model was conducted for years 2000-2013 again. In order to learn the impact of socio-economic development and environmental change, a bilinear regression analysis was conducted to on AMI association with national GDP and BPA, and with urbanization rate and BPA for years 2000-2013 [20] .",

In 1939, Yunnan Commission of Malaria Control and six Provincial Institutes for Malaria Control (PIMC) were established in the Province, and PIMC 6 was allocated in Hekou County. PIMC 6 organized outreach teams visiting communities to treat malaria, promote use of bed nets, and treat mosquito larvae breeding sites with emerald green (copper acetoarsenit).

According to results of SDI from former senior malaria control staff, a malaria control station (MCS) was established to recruit and train health staff in early 1952, and then a malaria control structure comprised of technical officers from military medicine departments and health sector of central and local governments, community health staff (CHWs) and village malaria control workers (VMCWs) was created. The leaders were political officers who managed technical officers, and technical officers trained, guided and managed CHWs who trained, guided and managed VMCWs. One VMCW was in charge of five to ten households to administer drugs and spray insecticides. Malaria investigation and control activities were initiated in the winter of 1952. Two treatment methods were utilized: (1) presumptive treatment was given to people with enlarged spleens and malaria attack episodes in prior 6 months; (2) intermittent preventive treatment (IPT), once a week, was administered to others. Methods for vector control were treatment of larval breeding sites with insecticides in the low-transmission dry season from December to April, and indoor residual spraying (IRS) in the high-transmission rainy season from May to November; in addition, community mobilization was conducted for environmental management. During those years of low supplies, drugs and insecticides were used as long as they were available. Occasionally obtainable drugs were quinacrine hydrochloride, quinine sulfate, paludrine and/or plasmoquine. Obtainable insecticides were dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) or hexachlorocyolohexane (C6H6C6). These interventions reduced AMI from 358.62 per 1000 person-years (89.32% Plasmodium falciparum of cases) in 1953 to 5.69 per 1000 person-years in 1960 (Table 1 ; Fig. 3 ).",

Chloroquine and pamaquine were introduced for malaria treatment in this period. However, anti-malarial efforts were halted by the Great Cultural Revolution from 1966 to 1976. The AES was combined into Hekou County Hospital in 1968, and then detached from the hospital in 1971. This led to under-reporting of malaria; no malaria was reported in 1969 (Table 1 ; Fig. 3 ).",

When a malaria epidemic broke out in 1987: AMI increased to 34.41 per 1000 person-years and five malaria-related deaths in the year; Honghe Prefecture had the highest number of malaria cases among 17 prefectures in Yunnan Province. Ultimately, deterioration of the malaria situation brought a political will to malaria control. Hehong Prefecture Government invested enough funding for anti-malarial drugs and insecticides. Additionally, artemisinin was registered in China in 1986. Introduction of artemisinin saved the life in control of the epidemic, and then oral and injective artemisinin monotherapy was recommended as the first line drugs for treatment of P. falciprum malaria and artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACTs) as the second line treatment in China. By 2002, AMI was lowered to fewer than one per 1000 person-years (Table 1 ; Fig. 3 ).",

Stable political and social status is important for effective malaria interventions. Paper-based records and interviewees' descriptions showed that Hekou was part of the hyperendemic areas before the establishment of People's Republic of China. Malaria burden during Yunnan-Vietnam railway construction is one of the earliest highlighted records on malaria burden in China. In spite of the fatality difference in Chinese and French records, the two records document a heavy malaria burden (Table 1 ). In those war-ridden years, it was difficult to carry out effective malaria intervention. The new government of China put people's wellbeing in an important position and gave political commitment to malaria control. In the context of shortage of armamentarium, medicine and human resources, the effective collaboration between military and civil medicine sectors set up an effective system for malaria prevention and treatment in a short time, which reduced malaria burden significantly (Fig. 3) . Importantly, the system of malaria control expanded into a primary health care system (PHCS). Similarly, malaria elimination in Sri Lanka documented the importance of political will for malaria control. Strong governmental commitment eliminated malaria in this underdeveloped country [21] .",

The PHCS in rural areas was called rural cooperative medical system (RCMS) that was developed under collective financing and public support from the People's Commune. Health personnel and facilities were organized on a three-tier system (county, commune and village). 'Barefoot doctors' were the backbone of the RCMS and their emphasis was on prevention. They were trained in both therapeutics and prophylaxis, both western and traditional Chinese medicine. In addition, women barefoot doctors learn midwifery, maternal and childcare [22] . The PHCS provided basic health services to one-fifth of the world's population [23] , and improved Table 2 Results of linear regression analysis between annual malaria incidence (AMI) and independent variables in Hekou, Yunnan Province, China R correlation coefficient, R 2 coefficient of determination, 95% CI 95% confidence interval, NGDP national gross domestic product, NUR national urbanization rate, YNGDP Yunnan Provincial gross domestic product, YNUR Yunnan Provincial urbanization rate, BPA banana planting area communicable disease control, including malaria, by using 'mass mobilization' , public education, and auxiliary personnel training. The RCMS that was operated by the villagers on a collective and mutual aid basis effectively maintained activities of malaria prevention and treatment. The villagers received free medical care in the cooperative health stations [24] . Malaria epidemics occurred in many other parts of Yunnan Province where the activities of RCMS were sharply curtailed during the great culture revolution (Fig. 3) . From 1968 to 1977, a population of 1,877,539 was affected by malaria epidemic in Yunnan alone and 1142 people died of malaria-related diseases; 409,117 malaria cases, 217.9 per 1000 person-years AMI and 26.11% (40,383/154,700) parasite prevalence was reported in the epidemic [11] . However, the RCMS provided malaria treatment and prevention, ensuring low and stable malaria prevalence in Hekou even though the county's anti-epidemic station was combined into the county hospital and unable to fully collect and report on malaria cases. Strong public health system is basis of for malaria control and elimination. China's post-1978 economic reforms in agricultural production and public financing diminished collective financing and public support for the RCMS. The continuing decline in the RCMS seriously affected healthcare: the number of barefoot doctors per capita diminished; most barefoot doctors forewent continuing education; there was an increase in the financial burden borne by farmers; and hospitals experienced financial problems. With the collapse of RCMS financing, many barefoot doctors created private practices, charging patients for service and selling drugs [25, 26] . Accumulative impact of economic reforms contributed to the malaria epidemic in 1987. The epidemic and increasing malaria incidence attracted the attention of local government to invest for drugs and insecticides. However, financing and personnel problems in healthcare were not solved until after the epidemic of SARS in 2003. The epidemic of SARS urged a strong commitment from central government to public health, including financing and coordinating a national malaria control and elimination programme. Meanwhile, international investment (2003-2012) from the GFATM accelerated malaria control and elimination in China (Table 1) .",

In spite of facing challenges today, such as resistance of anti-malarial drugs and insecticides [2] , and the difficulty of finding a radical cure of vivax malaria [27] , enough intervention could be effective. When five of the six GMS countries (all except China) reported artemisinin resistance of P. falciparum [28] , the high coverage of intervention dramatically reduced the malaria burden [9] , while drug sensitivity of malaria parasites has not changed significantly along the China-Myanmar border [29, 30] .",

One of the major obstacles to achieving malaria elimination is movement across international borders. Strengthening surveillance activities for rapid identification of importation or re-introduction of malaria is essential to address the movement of malaria [10] . During American and Vietnam conflict from 1955 to 1975, China gave a full support to Vietnam for malaria control. The collaboration might contribute a stable malaria situation in Hekou County in the time. In 2010, collaboration and information exchange mechanism, including annual meeting, routine information exchange, migrant management was again established between China Hekou County and Vietnam Lao Cai Province for border malaria surveillance and control (Table 1 ) [31] . That overall incidence of malaria is low in Vietnam, where the most affected are the central and south central hilly and mountainous areas, and malaria transmission is interrupted in northern provinces [32, 33] , would also benefit malaria elimination of Hekou County on the China-Vietnam border.",

The close relationship between AMI and NGDP and NUR documented that facilitated malaria elimination in Hekou (Table 2 ; Fig. 4 ). Growth of GDP provided assurance of financial investment for malaria control and urbanization. Increasing production has been changing the biophysical environment. Increasing banana-growing areas reduce mosquito-breeding sites, and the use of insecticides kills mosquitoes directly. This is showed by the strong correlation between the AMI and BPA, especially during 2000-2013 when the BPA were increasing rapidly (Table 2 ; Fig. 4 ). Results of bilinear regression analysis indicate that socio-economic development and biophysical environment changes are associated with reduction of burden and elimination of malaria, as well as interventions, in Hekou County (Table 2 ; Fig. 4 ).",

Firstly, data of individual interventions and associated reduction of the malaria burden are not available, population level figures and qualitative descriptions are used as replacements. The results on malaria burden before 1951 was descriptive and were based on fragmentary descriptions. Similar limitation is that an ecological study existed in the study that was not able to prove impact given the lack of a control [35] , only suggestive evidences can be provided. Secondly, from 1966 to 1986, malaria cases might have been under-reported, so that the true malaria situation cannot be documented (Table 1; Fig. 3 ). Thirdly, although the single and bilinear regression analysis documents that socio-economic development and environmental change contributes to reduced malaria burden and elimination, it cannot be used to document quantitative contributions from control interventions because of lack of sequential data of interventions. Fourthly, annually sequential data of GDP and urbanization for Hekou County are not available, so the national and provincial data are used for the linear regression analysis. However, Hekou is an underdeveloped border county in China so that investments from upper government, such as national and provincial governments, are the main resource for regional socio-economic development as well as malaria control. From this view, the national and provincial data for the analysis would work equally as the data from the county level.",

First, political commitment and governmental executive ability are pivotal for malaria control and elimination. Under strong governmental commitment many socio-economic constraints (such as financial and human resources) could be overcome and healthcare systems can be strengthened. Second, national health orientations and policies can dramatically affect efficacy and interventions of malaria control. Third, integration of primary healthcare together with malaria control contributes to sustainability of effective malaria control and surveillance. Fourth, high coverage of malaria intervention and population access to the intervention is crucial at any stage of malaria control and elimination. Fifth, malaria incidence is affected by socio-economic development, biophysical environment change, and malaria situation of neighbouring countries or regions. Multifaceted factors, including political commitment, effective interventions, socio-economic development, and changing biophysical environment work together for the elimination of malaria in Hekou (Additional file 1).",
