Nasal and throat swabs were collected from 397 children with URTIs and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimens were collected from 323 children with LRTIs. RT-PCR/PCR was used to examine all samples for IFV, PIV, RSV, RV, hMPV, HBoV, CoV, ADV, RSV, and EV. Viral pathogens were detected in 47.10% of URTI samples and 66.57% samples, and the incidence of viral coinfection was 5.29% and 21.05%, respectively. IFV was the most common virus in URTIs, with a detection rate of 19.40%, followed by PIV (10.83%), RV (10.58%), and EV (6.30%). For LRTIs, PIV and RV were both detected in 27% of samples, followed by RSV (9.91%), HBoV (8.36%), IFV (5.57%), and hMPV (5.57%). RSV and HBoV were more prevalent in the youngest children of no more than six months. Meanwhile, RV, PIV, and RSV were the most frequent viruses combined with bacterial pathogens in LRTIs. In conclusion, the spectrum of respiratory virus infections in URTIs and LRTIs differed in terms of the most common pathogens, seasonal distribution, and coinfection rate.",

The most common viral causes of ARTI worldwide include respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses (PIVs), influenza viruses (IFVs), enteroviruses (EVs), adenoviruses (ADVs), human rhinoviruses (HRVs), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), and human coronaviruses (HCoVs) 229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1. There are an increasing number of cases with severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by coronaviruses, including NL63, HKU1 [4] [5] [6] , and human bocavirus [7] , and the WU and KI polyomaviruses have been discovered to cause acute respiratory tract infections [8, 9] .",

The clinical symptoms of subjects are summarized in Table 1 . Patients with URTIs enrolled in the study were selected by physicians according to the presence of one or more respiratory symptoms as described previously [15] . In addition to the symptoms of URTIs, patients with radiological pulmonary abnormalities, such as evidence of pneumonia, bronchopneumonia, increased lung markings, dyspnea, or abnormal pulmonary breath sounds, were diagnosed with a LRTI.

The virus positive rate was approximately 20% higher in LRTIs than in URTIs. This may have been due to lower viral loads in nasal and throat swabs compared with bronchoalveolar lavage fluids [21] . The three principal pathogens in children with ARTIs were RV, IFV and PIV. The epidemiology differed between URTIs and LRTIs.

This is entirely different from the situation in adults. Ren et al. reported that IFV plays a major role in both URTIs and LRTIs in Chinese adults. Also, the detection rate for IFV (19.70%) in adults with URTIs is in accordance with our data from children [22] . Given that the same method of detection was used, these data may indicate that the IFV infection rate is similar in children and adults. The seasonality of IFV in children was also similar to that found in adults. IFV infection was observed most commonly during autumn and winter [22] , with no infections in May, July, or June, and only one case was found in August. Considering the fact that the study was performed during the global pandemic H1N1 influence A [23] , the peaks of IFV infection in our study, especially for URTIs, could be explained in part by the unusual influenza epidemiology this year, although the children recruited in our study were not attending the specific H1N1 clinic provided by the hospital. RV and PIV were the predominant viruses found in LRTIs, with a similar detection rate that was as high as 27%. These two viruses were also the most common in the URTI spectrum, with detection rates of approximately 11%. RSV was the next most commonly detected virus after RV and PIV, with a positivity rate of 9.91%.",

RSV has been reported to be the principal pathogen in LRTIs in many studies, with rates that range from 28.5% to 64.7% [24] [25] [26] . In Beijing city, RSV was reported to be the predominant virus in LRTIs in children, with a positive rate of 27%; PIV, MPV, and HCoV were not observed between 2004 and 2006 [27] . Between March 2007 and January 2008, RSV, RV, and PIV were reported to be the three principal viral causes of LRTIs, with detection rates of 48.3%, 27.1%, and 13.3%, respectively [28] . Also in Beijing city, during the period from March 2007 to March 2010, positivity rates for RSV, HRV, and PIV were 50.9%, 36.2%, and 12.0%, respectively, in children aged below 1 year [29] . A report from Changsha city also showed that RSV was prevalent in late autumn and winter, but not in spring or summer [30] . These conflicting results could be explained by regional or environmental variability.",

In our study, however, IFV coinfections were rare, and the reasons for this need to be explored. The combinations of respiratory virus coinfection are complex. RSV-hMPV and RSV-RV coinfection have been reported with a high incidence in children [35, 36] . Our study found a high prevalence of PIV-RV coinfection, which was reasonable given the high positivity rates for these two viruses. The correlation between coinfection and disease severity is controversial. Children with hMPV-RSV coinfection have more severe symptoms than those with a single infection [37, 38] , but a negative correlation between hMPV-RSV coinfection and disease severity has also been reported [39] . In our study, mixed infections were prone to be found in patients with severe clinical symptoms.",
