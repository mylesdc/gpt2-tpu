The etiologic agent, CCHF orthonairovirus (CCHFV), can infect several mammals in nature but only seems to cause clinical disease in humans. Over the past two decades there has been an increase in total number of CCHF case reports, including imported CCHF patients, and an expansion of CCHF endemic areas. Despite its increased public health burden there are currently no licensed vaccines or treatments to prevent CCHF. We here report the development and assessment of the protective efficacy of an adenovirus (Ad)-based vaccine expressing the nucleocapsid protein (N) of CCHFV (Ad-N) in a lethal immunocompromised mouse model of CCHF. The results show that Ad-N can protect mice from CCHF mortality and that this platform should be considered for future CCHFV vaccine strategies.",

The virus has a wide host range and causes a transient viremia in many wild, domesticated and laboratory mammals [1, 4, 5] . Humans usually acquire infection by tick bite or through unprotected contact with body fluids of infected animals or humans; additionally, several nosocomial outbreaks have been reported [1, 2] . In contrast to humans, adult immuno-competent mammals have not yet been reported to develop signs of disease [1, 2, 6 ]. This has impaired animal model development and hampered the testing of medical countermeasures against CCHF. CCHFV is an interferonsensitive virus and its replication is highly reduced by treatment with interferon in interferon-signaling competent cells [7] [8] [9] . These observations led to the discovery that adult mice with gene knockouts in interferon signaling pathways, such as the signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 (STAT1 -/-) and the interferon \u03b1/\u03b2 receptor (IFNAR -/-) mouse strains, are highly susceptible to CCHFV infection mimicking some hallmarks of human disease [10] [11] [12] .",

Over the past 20 years, CCHF has emerged or re-emerged in several countries often with dramatically increased case numbers. Furthermore, there has been a marked increase of imported cases of CCHF in European and South Asian countries [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . The root causes of the increased CCHF incidence rates are not fully understood, but factors such as shifts in climate patterns, animal and human migratory patterns, population increase in livestock and wildlife accompanied by changes in agricultural practices and increased land use may be responsible [18, 19] . Thus, there is a pressing need to develop prophylactic and therapeutic countermeasures against this significant emerging zoonosis.",

Full protection against lethal CCHFV challenge in a mouse model was achieved with DNA plasmids expressing GPC subunits and N, as well as a MVA vector expressing the GPC open reading frame. Partial protection was observed with whole inactivated virus preparations, a DNA plasmid expressing GPC, VLPs (consisting of N, GPC and L), and a combined plasmid DNA (GPC subunits and N)/VLP vaccination approach [23] [24] [25] . No protection was achieved with a soluble glycoprotein subunit vaccine and MVA expressing CCHFV N. Overall, these studies implicate immune responses to the glycoproteins as most important for protection, however the glycoprotein subunit platform has not shown any protection despite inducing a significant antibody response [22] . Due to the high genetic diversity of the surface glycoproteins (69-99% amino acid identity between CCHFV strains), a broadly efficacious vaccine may need an additional, more genetically conserved CCHFV antigen such as N (91-99% amino acid identity between CCHFV strains) [26, 27] .",

The mouse strains include the interferon signaling deficient IFNAR -/and STAT1 -/mouse strains and the humanized Hu-NSG-SGM3 mice [10] [11] [12] 29] . The Hu-NSG-SGM3 express certain human cytokines and human leukocytes, however the disease progression is somewhat atypical as the disease is primarily neurological [29] . Both the STAT1 -/and IFNAR -/mice possess complete sets of murine immune systems, but their cells either have altered response to interferon signaling or do not respond to type I interferon signaling, respectively, leading to rapid disease more reminiscent of human hemorrhagic fever [10-12]. IFNAR -/mice are highly susceptible to severe disease caused by several viral agents [11, 12, [30] [31] due to lower and/or altered immune responses to infections compared with wild type mice [32] [33] [34] [35] . The IFNAR -/mice frequently do not respond as quickly to infection as wild type mice and, furthermore, CCHFV replicates to higher levels than in wild type mice [12] . The increased difficulty in protecting IFNAR -/mice from infection seems associated with insufficient immune responses due to inadequate cross-priming of antigen presenting cells [32] . Thus, efficacy testing of vaccines in this model can be difficult as protective vaccines must elicit proper immune responses by circumventing IFNAR -/dampened antigen priming, and must stimulate an effective adaptive immune response that can compensate for the lack of antiviral state activation and reduction of CCHFV replication normally mediated by type I interferon signaling. Therefore, IFNAR -/mice should be considered a \"higher bar\" for efficacy testing of vaccines than fully immunocompetent rodent models.",

Therefore, an Ad-based platform was utilized here to address whether IFNAR -/mice can be protected from lethal CCHFV infection using only the more conserved CCHFV N as the antigen. In this study, IFNAR -/mice vaccinated with Ad-N developed IgG responses to CCHFV N (S1 Fig) and were partially protected from CCHFV challenge (Figs 1-3; S2 Fig) . Due to a lack of GPC antigen in the vaccine preparations protection is unlikely to be mediated by neutralizing antibodies but rather due to priming of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells and/or non-neutralizing antibody responses as has been previously reported for the Ad platform in other IFNAR -/vaccine studies [38] . Additional experiments are required to demonstrate which of the CD4+, CD8+ T cell and/or antibody responses after vaccination/infection are responsible for protection. Several studies have evaluated correlates of protection in IFNAR -/mice to CCHFV infection. The role of adaptive immune responses following MVA immunization was evaluated using the transfer of antibodies and/or T-cells to na\u00efve IFNAR -/mice [36] , while vaccine studies employing DNA and VLP vaccination were evaluated using circulating cytokine profiling [24] and/or IgG subtype ratios [24, 25] . These or alternate experiments, such as selective depletion of B-and T-cell populations following vaccination, could also determine the importance of each of the two arms of the adaptive immune system in response to Ad vaccination. However, it is important to caution that despite their utility and appropriateness for early stage vaccine testing, IFNAR -/mice are severely immuno-compromised, inbred mice and therefore may generate different protective immune responses than immuno-competent outbred populations of humans and/or animals [12] .",

However, as has been recently reported for Ebola, having an efficacious vaccine on hand for emergencies can help to contain outbreaks and protect medical staff attending patients [39] . To this end having readily available vaccine stockpiles which can be efficiently produced, have an acceptable shelflife, can be efficiently delivered to patients and clinical staff in outbreak regions, and have undergone at least clinical phase II testing would be of great importance against sporadic, lifethreatening, emerging infectious diseases such as CCHF. The Ad platform fulfils these criteria and should, in addition to other vaccines, be considered for vaccine stockpiles.",

Partial efficacy of up to 78% following a prime-boost vaccination strategy mediated by this more conserved CCHFV antigen demonstrates its critical role in protection and suggest its future consideration for CCHFV vaccine strategies.

Expression of CCHFV N was demonstrated utilizing rabbit N1028 polyclonal antiserum. (B) IFNAR -/mice (n = 3) were immunized with Ad-N (prime-boost regimen) and antibody responses (IgG) were detected by ELISA four weeks after boost vaccination. Lysed whole CCHFV particles derived from infected SW13 cells and supernatant from mock-infected SW13 cells were used as positive and negative antigens, respectively. The serum of na\u00efve IFNAR -/mice (n = 3) was used as a negative control (na\u00efve) and serum from IFNAR -/mice (n = 2), which had survived a CCHFV infection after vaccination, was used as a positive control (survivor).
