Photonic crystal nanobeam cavity (PCNC) sensors have attracted great attention due to high-quality factors and small-mode volumes (Q/V) and good on-chip integrability with optical waveguides/circuits. In this review, we focus on nanoscale optical sensing based on PCNC sensors, including ultrahigh figure of merit (FOM) sensing, single nanoparticle trapping, label-free molecule detection and an integrated sensor array for multiplexed sensing. We believe that the PCNC sensors featuring ultracompact footprint, high monolithic integration capability, fast response and ultrahigh sensitivity sensing ability, etc., will provide a promising platform for further developing lab-on-a-chip devices for biosensing and other functionalities.",

A comprehensive overview about basic properties and sensing mechanisms of 1D-PCNCs sensors is discussed in Section 2. In Section 3, firstly, we introduce the efforts to pursue ultra-high figure of merit (FOM) in refractive index (RI) sensing based on 1D-PCNCs. Secondly, we outline the applications of 1D-PCNC sensors on single nanoparticle and label-free molecule (viruses, proteins and DNAs) detection. Thirdly, a monolithic integrated 1D-PCNC sensor array for multiplexed sensing is introduced explicitly. In addition, we present other sensing applications of 1D-PCNC sensors such as temperature sensing and optomechanical sensing, etc. Next, we review the nanofabrication and coupling techniques in the development of 1D-PCNC sensors in Section 4. Finally, we draw a brief conclusion. Figure 2. (a) Schematic of photonic circuits. The green lines, red boxes and black boxes represent waveguides, PCNCs and grating couplers, respectively.

Label-free optical sensors exhibit distinguished potential for the detection of nanoscale analytes (physical, chemical, and biological) owing to their good performance in non-invasiveness, fast response, real time in situ detection capability and immunity to electromagnetic interference. In recent years, various optical sensors have been developed for sensing applications, including mach-zehnder interferometers (MZI) [13, 14] , surface plasmon resonators (SPR) [15, 16] , fiber Bragg gratings (FBG) [17] , and optical microcavities [18, 19] . Among these, optical microcavities are considered to be excellent platforms for optical sensing due to the high-quality factors (Q) and small-mode volumes (V). The optical",

With recent advances in research on PhC cavities both theoretically and experimentally [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] , PCNCs have been extensively applied for optical sensing. PCNC sensors are advantageous for optical sensing because of their ultra-high Q/V. Firstly, Q can be expressed as the ratio of the cavity central resonance wavelength to its linewidth, namely, Q = \u03bb 0 /\u03b4\u03bb = \u03c9\u03c4, where \u03c9 is the angular frequency and \u03c4 is the cavity photon life time. The longer the photon life time, the stronger the interaction between light and matter will be. Higher Q exhibits narrower resonance linewidth (\u03b4\u03bb), and determines the minimum resonance shift (\u2206\u03bb) detectable by the system. Next, V describes the light confinement ability. A small V implies that the mode field is highly localized, which can significantly enhance the light-matter interactions. The high Q and small V enable 1D-PCNC to be an excellent platform for lab-on-a-chip optical sensing based on the resonance mode shift or mode broadening mechanism [19] .",

According to perturbation theory [39] , the wavelength shift \u2206\u03bb generated by a small index perturbation \u2206n of the surrounding analytes can be calculated.

Sensitivity of this sensor was more than 200 nm/RIU (refractive index unit) while Q exceeds 30,000 in air and 20,000 in water. Then, Gong et al. [48] designed and fabricated 1D-PCNCs using silica. They used trapezoidal cavity designs in Si and Si 3 N 4 [27, 36] , but considered silica plates suspended in free space. The simulation showed that Q exceeded 10 4 with the mode volume of 2.0 (\u03bb/n) 3 at the visible wavelength range (600-716 nm). For example, Yao et al. reported an optical sensor with an ultra-high sensitivity based on the 1D-PhC stack mode-gap cavity [49] . By introducing the width-tapering structure that was quadratically modulated, a waveguide coupled 1D-PhC stack mode-gap cavity was designed. The measured Q was up to 1.74 \u00d7 10 7 with mode volume of 1.48 (\u03bb/n Si ) 3 [49] . The confined mode accounted for most electric field energy, which interacted strongly with the detection target. The S was as high as 269 nm/RIU. For a higher sensitivity, the optical resonance field requires to be confined in a small mode volume and interact strongly with the analytes. The S can be improved by the following methods: designing the air mode (AM) PCNC to localize the optical field in the air holes (circular [50, 51] , elliptical [52] ); embedding a nano-slot into the dielectric mode (DM) PCNC and the light can be localized in the nano-slot [40, [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] . For example, Wang et al. presented InGaAsP PhC slot nanobeam slow optical waveguides, which embedded InAs quantum dots [53] . The 900 nm/RIU measurement record of S fully confirms that the electric field can be strongly localized in the slot region. In 2017, Liu et al. proposed a suspended ultra-sensitive silicon nitride (Si 3 N 4 ) PCNC sensor [59] . Si 3 N 4 has been considered as an alternative material for SOI platforms because of low-cost, CMOS compatible properties and relatively low RI (n~2). Furthermore, the loss of Si 3 N 4 waveguides based on plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) thin films at the visible wavelength band was less than 1 dB/cm [60] . All outstanding advantages introduced above enable Si 3 N 4 to be a reliable choice for visible sensing applications. The S of 321 nm/RIU was also obtained at the wavelength of~700 nm with higher order mode. Moreover, the slotted geometry was exploited to provide strong light confinement and enhanced localized field, which resulted in an ultra-small mode volume. Thus, the performance advantages of ultra-high sensitivity, ultra-high Q factor, and ultra-small mode volume enabled the proposed single 1-D PhC-SNCs to be promising candidates for lab-on-chip sensing arrays. Much research has been proposed to optimize structure design to obtain high Q and high S simultaneously with PCNC RI sensors. For example, Quan et al. presented the design of high Q polymeric PCNCs in 2011, which consisted of two polymers with the refractive index contrast of 1.15 [61] . Furthermore, at a 100 microwatt power level, thermo-optical bistability could be observed. The nanobeam cavity included a ridge waveguide, and the ridge waveguide was perforated with elliptical holes grating. At the same time, the cavities immersed in D2O was measured, and the absorption of the cavity in the range of telecommunication frequency was negligible.

Furthermore, at a 100 microwatt power level, thermo-optical bistability could be observed. The nanobeam cavity included a ridge waveguide, and the ridge waveguide was perforated with elliptical holes grating. At the same time, the cavities immersed in D2O was measured, and the absorption of the cavity in the range of telecommunication frequency was negligible.

For example, Quan et al. presented the design of high Q polymeric PCNCs in 2011, which consisted of two polymers with the refractive index contrast of 1.15 [61] . Furthermore, at a 100 microwatt power level, thermo-optical bistability could be observed. The nanobeam cavity included a ridge waveguide, and the ridge waveguide was perforated with elliptical holes grating. At the same time, the cavities immersed in D 2 O was measured, and the absorption of the cavity in the range of telecommunication frequency was negligible. The highest Q factor obtained in D 2 O was 36,000. A lower ratio of the system (index ratio = 1.15) was achieved while the Q was almost one order of magnitude higher than that formerly proved (Q = 5000 in air and index ratio = 1.46) [36] . They also demonstrated that the FOM of these devices was two orders of magnitude higher than sensors based on SPR, and better than the commercial Biacore TM sensors. The evanescent field of the polymer nanobeam cavity can be extended to the surrounding medium, which is more than the widely applied silicon-based nanophotonic sensors because of the low RI contrast. Therefore, the wavelength shift of the polymer cavity was more sensitive to the variations of the volume RI in the ambient medium. By combining functional nanostructures with new materials, we hope to inspire new applications such as non-linear optics, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), and photoluminescent devices. Moreover, Yang et al. demonstrated a 1D-PhC single nanobeam cavity based on air mode in 2015 [50] . For the AM, the optical resonance field was strongly confined in the air area and overlapped with the analytes, enhancing the interaction between light and matter. Consequently, a high Q of 5.16 \u00d7 10 6 and S of 537.8 nm/RIU were achieved at wavelength of 1350 nm. In most sensing applications where water was used as carrier liquid, the Q of sensor has been limited to about 10 4 due to the absorption of water at the telecommunication wavelength, resulting in a FOM of about 4000. Therefore, the 1D-PhC single nanobeam AM cavity sensor was considered a promising platform for RI sensing. In addition, a nano-slotted parallel multibeam cavity was proposed by Yang et al. in 2013. When absorption was ignored, they obtained S > 800 nm/RIU and Q > 10 7 in liquid in the range of telecommunication wavelength [62] . Then, Kim et al. demonstrated a high Q and S optical sensor based on PCNC with the second lowest air band edge mode, achieving S of~631 nm/RIU and Q > 23,300 and theoretical FOM was more than 9500 [63] . In order to achieve ultra-high Q and S simultaneously, Yang et al. proposed two different designs (AM, DM) of ultra-compact photonic crystal nanofiber cavities (PCNFCs) in 2018. By numerical simulation, the Q and S of Q~1.1 \u00d7 10 7 , S = 563.6 nm/RIU and Q~2.1 \u00d7 10 5 , S = 736.8 nm/RIU were obtained, and the FOM was up to 4.31 \u00d7 10 6 and 1.13 \u00d7 10 5 , respectively [64] . Compared with the previous works of PCNFCs, Q/V was more than two orders of magnitude. In addition, the index contrast of proposed device in this work was reduced more two times than previous research works. In 2017, Sun et al. proposed a single PhC slot nanobeam cavity with rectangular-shaped air holes, which achieved S of 835 nm/RIU and Q of 5.50 \u00d7 10 5 with mode volume down to 0.03 (\u03bb/n air ) 3 , and an ultra-high FOM with 2.92 \u00d7 10 5 was obtained [65] . Obviously, the light was mainly confined in the slotted region which indicated analytes can be strongly interacted with light. Xu In addition, they demonstrated that both an ultra-high S of 750.89 nm/RIU and Q of 2.67 \u00d7 10 7 in air can be obtained simultaneously, resulting in FOM > 10 7 [67] . The results demonstrated that the proposed sensor is potentially an ideal platform for on-chip sensing owing to high sensitivity, small footprints and masses.",

Optical sensors such as nano-waveguide sensors [69] [70] [71] [72] , WGM microcavity sensors [73] , and PhC microcavity sensors [74, 75] have attracted great attention due to high S, low cost and small size, which has been successfully used for single nanoparticle detection. Moreover, the sensitivity and detection limit are the major factors to characterize the performance of optical sensors. Compared with nano-waveguide sensors, optical microcavities can confine light in a small mode volume, which results in the strong light-environment interactions and then leads to ultra-high sensitivity as well as the low detection limit. Among these, PhC cavities have potentially higher sensitivities than WGM cavities due to their small cavity volume [44] . Therefore, the detection limit is comparable to WGM cavities although the Q of PhC cavities is not as high as WGM microcavity sensors.

Hence, researches have been put forward to optimize PCNCs design in order to obtain high FOM and ultra-low detection limit for biomolecules detection. Several research projects have been carried out for biosening by integrating microfluidic with PCNCs. For example, by embedding PCNCs inside a microfluidic channel and functionalized with biotin, as shown in Figure 1a , single streptavidin molecule with a concentration of 2 pM was detected, as shown in Figure 1b [21] . This device provided a platform for ultra-sensitive and label-free biomolecules detection. Tardif et al. finished the identification of three different kinds of bacteria using 1D-PhC, which provided a reference for the investigation of larger numbers of bacteria with different shapes, sizes and properties, as shown in Figure 1c ,d [80] . Based on PCNCs, Liang et al proposed PhC chips with Q of 14,000 for label-free protein detection and detected carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) biomarker from 0.1 pg/mL to 10 \u00b5g/mL [81] , as shown in Figure 2a Figure 3a [82] . Furthermore, they have successfully achieved the label-free detection of DNA-protein dynamics with an ultra-high Q/V, as shown in Figure 3b . The research demonstrated the limitation of traditional fluorescent labeling methods and provide an attractive option for single-molecule drug discovery. Rodriguez et al. demonstrated a PCNC by utilizing a porous silicon with large internal surface area, which allowed enhanced molecular capture and direct light-matter interaction in 2019 [83] , as shown in Figure 3c . In this work, the surface detection S was approximately 1.6 pm/nM for 16-base nucleic acid molecules, as depicted in Figure 3d. 0.1 pg/mL to 10 \u03bcg/mL [81] , as shown in Figure 2a ,b. In addition, the device can be mass-produced with scalable deep-ultraviolet (UV) lithography, enabling biological sensor chips to be practical and commercial. To obtain high Q and high S simultaneously, Yang et al. proposed nanoslotted parallel quadrabeam PhC cavity (NPQC) with high FOM > 2000, as shown in Figure 2c and experimentally observed streptavidin-biotin binding events via mode shift, achieving the detection of streptavidin molecule with concentration down to 10 ag/mL, as shown in Figure 2d [54] . Later, in the year of 2017, Liang et al. designed a hybrid photonic-plasmonic antenna-in-a-nanocavity biosensor, as demonstrated in Figure 3a [82] .

In summary, for both the detection of single nanoparticles and biomolecules introduced above, the adsorption of single nanoparticles and biomolecules onto the PCNCs is monitored via the resonance wavelength shift and linewidth broadening.

In this work, PCNCs side coupled to input/output waveguides, and each nanobeam cavity and waveguide was separated in different fluid channels, as shown in Figure 4a . To illustrate the nanoscale optofluidic sensor array, the authors fabricated fluidic architecture by a soft lithography technique with a flexible polymer PDMS, which successfully achieved the detection of water and CaCl 2 solution with a RI resolution of 7 \u00d7 10 \u22125 and the detection limit of 35 ag. Later, they demonstrated the multiplexed ability of the structure introduced above via the separate and simultaneous detection of three kinds of interleukins in 2009 [85] , as shown in Figure 4b . Moreover, Yang et al. demonstrated a 3-parallel-channel integrated sensor array with footprint of 4.5 \u00b5m \u00d7 50 \u00b5m (width \u00d7 length) in 2016 and the S of each channel is 112.6 nm/RIU, 121.7 nm/RIU, 148.5 nm/RIU [86] , shown in Figure 4c ,d. These ultra-compact devices have been considered as promising platform for further lab-on-chip applications with high integration and ultra-sensitive multiplexed sensing abilities. Except for a nanobeam sensors array, a single nanobeam cavity also can be used for multiplexed sensing. For example, another cascaded side coupled structure for multiplexed sensing has been proposed by Liu et al. [87] , as shown in Figure 4e . There two PCNCs for different sensing, one is air-mode cavity for RI sensing and another is dielectric-mode cavity for temperature sensing. Moreover, experiments have been carried out for the RI sensing and temperature sensing in glucose solution, obtaining the highest RI sensitivity of 254.6 nm/RIU for air-mode cavity and temperature sensitivity of 56.4 pm/ \u2022 C for dielectric-mode cavity, as shown in Figure 4f .

These ultra-compact devices have been considered as promising platform for further lab-on-chip applications with high integration and ultra-sensitive multiplexed sensing abilities. Except for a nanobeam sensors array, a single nanobeam cavity also can be used for multiplexed sensing. For example, another cascaded side coupled structure for multiplexed sensing has been proposed by Liu et al. [87] , as shown in Figure 4e . There two PCNCs for different sensing, one is air-mode cavity for RI sensing and another is dielectric-mode cavity for temperature sensing. Moreover, experiments have been carried out for the RI sensing and temperature sensing in glucose solution, obtaining the highest RI sensitivity of 254.6 nm/RIU for air-mode cavity and temperature sensitivity of 56.4 pm/\u00b0C for dielectric-mode cavity, as shown in Figure 4f . This structure shows the excellent capabilities in multiparametric sensing applications due to the simple configuration, easy fabrication and convenient integration. In general, with the rapid development of PCNC design and fabrication over the past few years, PCNCs have been considered an excellent platform for nanoscale ultra-compact integrated sensor array devices with ultra-high S and multiplexed sensing abilities owing to their ultra-small Q/V, as well as high integrability with waveguides and photonic circuits [88] .",

In addition, the work also held the potential for high-precision sensing by compensating thermal refraction effect based on two materials with opposite thermo-optic effect. PCNCs can also be applied for physical sensing by adjusting the coupling between a light field and nanomechanical motion. Moreover, 1D-PCNCs have attracted great attention in optomechanical sensing owing to their smaller size as well as the higher design flexibility. For example, Wu et al. in 2014 proposed a physical sensor based on a PhC split-beam cavity, achieving the detection of optomechanical torque. The measurement of sub-pg torsional can be realized, obtaining the S of 500 MHz/nm for dissipative coupling and 2 GHz/nm for dispersive coupling. In addition, as shown in Figure 6a , the S of the cantilever-type mechanical resonance sensor was 1.2 \u00d7 10 \u221220 nm/ \u221a Hz and 1.3 \u00d7 10 \u221221 nm/ \u221a Hz under environmental conditions and low vacuum, respectively [94] . In 2015, Kaviani et al. introduced an optomechanical sensor with strong non-linear optomechanical coupling, low mass, and wide light mode spacing [95] . As illustrated in Figure 6b , it was a photonic crystal \"paddle nanocavity\" that combined working principles of membrane-in-the middle (MIM) cavities [96, 97] and PCNC optomechanical devices [98] . Leijssen et al. [99] then realized an optomechanical sensor using a sliced PhC nanobeam, combining such strongly localized light fields with a low-mass mechanical mode, as shown in Figure 6c . Eichenfield et al. [27] demonstrated an optomechanical sensor consist of two Si 3 N 4 nanobeams in the near-field of each other, forming a so-called \"zipper\" cavity. In 2017, Du et al. introduced a resonant Lorentz force magnetic-field sensor based on dual-coupled PCNCs [100] , as shown in Figure 6d . Compared with the Lorentz force magnetometer of microelectro mechanical systems (MEMS), the magnetic-field sensor presented the advantages of ultra-compact and a wide working bandwidth (160 Hz). The sensor has a much smaller footprint and thus have a potentially higher spatial sensing resolution of the magnetic field. It may be suitable for magnetometer arrays employed for a magnetic marker.",

In summary, the development of nanofabrication techniques promotes the investigation of PCNCs with a view to miniaturization and intellectualization, as well as the development of integrated optical devices. Moreover, coupling techniques are the key factors to solve the issue of optical transmission loss, playing an important part in sensing applications of PCNCs. Therefore, nanofabrication and coupling techniques need to be considered in the development of PCNC sensors. In the future, the micro-nano optical sensors can be used in internet of things (IoT) and intelligent optical network. The advanced and unique performance of the micro-nano optical sensors will play an important role in the future development of converged, collaborative and co-automatic optical networks [109] .",

We reviewed sensing applications of 1D-PCNC sensors including ultra-high FOM RI sensing, single nanoparticle and label-free molecule detection, integrated sensor arrays for multiplexed sensing and other sensing applications. In addition, the nanofabrication and coupling techniques of 1D-PCNC sensors were reviewed. Unambiguously, the 1D-PCNC will continue to generate new opportunities for nanoscale optical sensing considering new paradigms about structures and functional materials. We believe that the 1D-PCNC is potentially a promising platform for biosensing and other lab-on-a-chip applications. ",
