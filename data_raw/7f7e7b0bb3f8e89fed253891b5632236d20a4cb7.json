Despite the proven usefulness of peak VO 2 , achieving quality and consistency of data in children remains a challenge. Peak VO 2 is developmentally divergent, varying with age, maturity and sex, and is highly correlated with body size and composition [10, 11] . It has been convention to scale peak VO 2 by simply dividing absolute peak VO 2 (mL. min -1 ) by body mass (ratio scaling). This however, results in a different pattern of development in peak VO 2 in comparison to absolute peak VO 2 , with absolute peak VO 2 in boys increasing with age, but ratio-scaled peak VO 2 remaining unchanged [12] . Similarly in girls, increases in absolute peak VO 2 are noted with increasing age until a levelling off in puberty, but ratio-scaled peak VO 2 declines with age [12] .",

The development of peak VO 2 has been described using allometric scaling (log-linear analysis of covariance with body mass as the covariate) in Caucasian children and adolescents, and the same developmental pattern as absolute peak VO 2 has been noted with age i.e., peak VO 2 increases in boys with age, whereas in girls it increases until about 14 years of age when a leveling off is observed [15] .

At this point the speed was held constant and the gradient increased by 1% every minute until volitional exhaustion. Heart rate was monitored continuously during the test. Participants wore a comfortably fitted facemask (Hans Rudolph paediatric large size, 8950 series) and breath-by breath gas samples were collected and analyzed throughout the test using the Medgraphics CPX/DTM metabolic cart (Medical Graphics Corporation, St. Paul, MN), calibrated prior to each test. Peak VO 2 was determined when two of the following three conditions were reached: 1) a respiratory exchange ratio (RER)>1.0, 2) heart rate within 5% of age predicted maximum, 3) the participant was exhausted and refused to carry on despite strong verbal encouragement [22] .",

In order to determine the age and sex-specific mean and standard deviation (SD) of peak VO 2 for sample size calculation, we collected pilot data from 261 healthy children aged 9-16 years.

A log-linear regression model was constructed using log (peak VO 2 ) as the dependent and log (body weight) as independent variables. The interaction effects of age and sex were tested and found to significantly modulate the association between body mass and peak VO 2 , justifying the need for sex and age specific exponents. Therefore, allometric scaling was done separately for 4 different subgroups: (1) younger (aged from 8 to 11.99 years) males; (2) older (aged from 12 to 16.99 years) males; (3) younger females (aged from 8 to 11.99 years) and (4) older females (aged from 12 to 16.99 years). Outliers were identified using the least median of squares eliminator and removed from analyses [26] . Regression diagnostics were performed to ensure the models were appropriate [27] . Shapiro-Wilks normality test was used to evaluate the normality of the residuals. Homoscedasticity was assessed by plotting the standardized residuals against the standardized predicted value. The resulting beta coefficients were used as the allometric exponents. Peak VO 2 can then be allometrically scaled using the equation: allometrically scaled peak VO 2 \u00bc unscaled peak VO 2 body mass exponent Pearson correlation analysis was used to examine the association of the scaled peak VO 2 with body size (body mass and height) and age to verify the effectiveness of the allometric scaling approach for controlling for body size within the specific age groups.

A stepwise regression was used to evaluate the association between peak VO 2 and body size and age. The linear (x), second-order (x 2 ) and third-order (x 3 ) effects of age, height and weight were tested and the resulting regression equations were used to predict peak VO 2 . Subjects with the resulting standardised predicted VO 2 greater than 3 or less than -3 were considered as outliers and were excluded. As the variance of the residual values varied with body size and the variations are different between sexes and age groups, age-and sex-specific models were established to predict the standard deviation with body size using the method suggested by Altman [28] . First, linear regression was used to examine the association between the absolute value of the residual values and body size. Since the residual values were normally distributed, the absolute values of the residual values had a half-normal distribution. The mean of a half-normal distribution is p (2/\u03c0). The SD of the residuals can be estimated as the product of the mean of the absolute residuals and p (\u03c0/2). It follows that the predicted values from the regression of the absolute residuals on body size multiplied by p (\u03c0/2) would be the estimates of SD of the signed residual, and hence of peak VO 2 . As a result, two regression models were developed for each sex and age group, one for the prediction of peak VO 2 and the other for the prediction of SD. Z scores were calculated using the following formula:",

            "text": "Similar to previous reports, we show that absolute peak VO 2 increases with age in both sexes [30] [31] [32] [33] . A greater peak VO 2 in boys compared to girls becomes significant from 12 to 13 years of age, with the difference gradually widening as age increases. This sex-related variability in peak VO 2 likely relates in part to differences in body composition with boys having a higher ratio of fat-free mass/stature 2 and a lower ratio of total body fat/stature 2 after adolescence [34] . Indeed, we show that boys had a significantly lower percentage of body fat (thus a higher percentage of fat-free mass) than girls. In addition, the lower peak VO 2 in the girls in our study compared to boys after 12 years of age, may be related to the onset of menarche at around 12 years in girls from Southern China [35] . which results in increases in fat-mass and a reduced rate of growth [36] . The absolute peak VO 2 values presented here are considerably lower than the predicted values using Armstrong and Welsman's regression equations [12] , which were generated from data on Caucasian children and adolescents. It is possible that because Southern Chinese children reach peak height velocity at an earlier age, this results in less time for prepubertal growth [37] compared to Caucasian children and therefore developmentally divergent peak VO 2 . The developmental pattern of ratio-scaled peak VO 2 in girls in the current study shows, similar to Northern Chinese girls, peak VO 2 declined with age [38] . However, a different developmental pattern to the Northern Chinese for ratio scaled peak VO 2 was observed in the boys in our study, with values remaining steady from 8 to 12 years, then gradually increasing. In Northern Chinese boys ratio-scaled peak VO 2 increased from 10 to 13 years and then remained steady [38] . Despite ratio-scaled peak VO 2 remaining the most popular method of expressing peak VO 2 [12, 13, 39] , ratio-scaled peak VO 2 was negatively correlated with body mass and height.",

These findings suggest that the influence body mass has on peak VO 2 differs by age. The developmental pattern for allometric scaled peak VO 2 differed from that of absolute peak VO 2 , with increases observed from 11 to 12 years of age in both sexes, and continued increases from 12 to 15 years of age in older males.
