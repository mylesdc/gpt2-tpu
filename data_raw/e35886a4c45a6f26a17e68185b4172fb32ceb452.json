Therefore, the HA protein is regarded as a suitable target for the development of influenza virus detection devices. In this study, we isolated single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) aptamers binding to the HA1 subunit of subtype H1 (H1-HA1), but not to the HA1 subunit of subtype H5 (H5-HA1), using a counter-systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (counter-SELEX) procedure. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and surface plasmon resonance studies showed that the selected aptamers bind tightly to H1-HA1 with dissociation constants in the nanomolar range. Western blot analysis demonstrated that the aptamers were binding to H1-HA1 in a concentration-dependent manner, yet were not binding to H5-HA1. Interestingly, the selected aptamers contained G-rich sequences in the central random nucleotides region. Further biophysical analysis showed that the G-rich sequences formed a G-quadruplex structure, which is a distinctive structure compared to the starting ssDNA library. Using flow cytometry analysis, we found that the aptamers did not bind to the receptor-binding site of H1-HA1. These results indicate that the selected aptamers that distinguish H1-HA1 from H5-HA1 can be developed as unique probes for the detection of the H1 subtype of influenza virus.",

Thus far, aptamers have been developed for a wide range of purposes such as biosensors, medical diagnosis, and therapy [16, 17] . In order to improve aptamer production, enhanced versions of SELEX were established, such as counter-SELEX, toggle-SELEX, cell-SELEX, and others [18] . Using counter-SELEX methods, the Polisky group created an RNA aptamer that could distinguish between theophylline and caffeine, differing by only one methyl group [19] , while the Famulok group made aptamers discriminating between cytohesin-1 and cytohesin-2 [20]. As these and other previous studies indicated, aptamers generated by counter-SELEX can discern minute differences between targets of closely related structures [21, 22] . Based on this sensitivity, it can be assumed that aptamers selected by counter-SELEX might be ideal diagnostic tools for differentiating between HA subtypes.",

Bioinformatic analysis using Clus-talW2 (Fig 5B) revealed that the selected aptamers comprise of characteristic clusters of nucleotides in the 45-nucleotide random sequence region (indicated by asterisks) and contain seven nucleotides (GGGTGGG) followed by (G(N)GGGGGTGG), (GGT), and (GGG(N)T(N)G).

We pre-incubated FITC-labeled aptamers with H1-HA1 or H5-HA1 and added the complexes to HEK293T cells harboring sialic acid on the surface. As shown in Fig 7, the shifts of FITC and PE labels with H1-HA1 and H5-HA1 indicate that aptamer-H1-HA1 complexes were bound to sialic acid on the HEK293T cell surface, whereas H5-HA1 was bound to sialic acid with no aptamer attached. Therefore, the selected aptamers were found to bind selectively to H1-HA1 and not to H5-HA1, while they did not interfere with the sialic acid-binding ability of HA1 regardless of the subtype, suggesting that the aptamers were not binding to the sialic acid-binding region of HA1.",

            "text": "Upon influenza virus infection, surface glycoprotein HA recognizes and binds to sialic acid of the host cell membrane, leading to membrane fusion between the virus envelope and the endosome [33] . The identification of the type of HA present on the viral surface could aid in the determination of the species that can be infected and the type of sialic acid that is necessary (Sia\u03b12-6Gal or Sia\u03b12-3Gal) for viral infection [34] . Therefore, an efficient and accurate method to detect the several types of HA is important for the determination of the influenza subtype in infected species. When HA1 sequences of subtypes H1 and H5 were aligned by BLAST, the two proteins were found to have 55% identity and 73% similarity. Therefore, the development of an ssDNA aptamer that can distinguish between H1 and H5 was assumed to be useful for the subtle differentiation between two influenza subtypes. We constructed an ssDNA pool of 88-mers containing a randomized sequence region of 45 nucleotides in the center, which was screened using counter-SELEX in order to isolate ssDNA aptamers binding specifically to H1-HA1 protein, but not to H5-HA1. After 14 cycles of selection, we were able to select three ssDNA aptamers and measure their binding affinities to H1-HA1 by ELISA and SPR. Both methods produced similar results in a range of nanomolar K d values. In addition to determining K d values, ELISA and SPR experiments demonstrated that the fixed aptamers on the surface of a plate or chip were able to bind to the H1-HA1 protein. This indicates that appropriate protein-specific ssDNA aptamers would make good probes for the development of biosensors. Further analysis by western blotting demonstrated that the selected aptamers could be used as substitutes for commercial anti-H1-HA1 protein antibodies (S4 Fig). Based on the fact that aptamers are called \"chemical antibodies\" for their high affinity to target molecules, the isolation of good aptamers should be very attractive for the development of immunological reagents and diagnostic systems [35, 36] .",

In addition to prediction, the structure of aptamers was analyzed by CD, showing that the selected aptamers have two G-quadruplex structures. According to a previous study, a stable G-quadruplex structure of selected aptamers has a strong binding capacity to a target protein [39] . Therefore, it is likely that a G-quadruplex structure plays an important role in the binding to H1-HA1, although the exact binding mode is still unclear [40] .",

The Arnon group discovered a DNA aptamer that can prevent viral infection by blocking the receptor-binding region of HA (amino acid 91-261) regardless of the subtype (H1N1, H2N2, and H3N2) [41] . Using counter-SELEX, the Kumar group selected an RNA aptamer that can distinguish H3 subtypes (H3N2) of different strains [42] , while they recently isolated an aptamer binding to H5N1 and H7N7 viruses and inhibiting HA-glycan interactions [43] . The Kim group isolated RNA aptamers that bind to H5-HA1 (H5N2) and suppress viral infection [44, 45] . In most previous studies, the isolated aptamers were binding to the receptorbinding region of HA proteins. To determine whether our selected aptamers were also binding to the receptor-binding region of HA, thereby inhibiting the interaction with the receptor of the host cell, flow cytometry analysis was performed. Interestingly, our selected aptamers did not block the interaction between H1-HA1 protein and the receptor of the host cell, indicating that the aptamers bind to H1-HA1 in a region other than the receptor-binding region. Therefore, our selected aptamers are not expected to inhibit HA-mediated membrane fusion.",

The gel was stained with Coomassie brilliant blue. The western blot was performed using GST antibody-HRP. (C) Amino acid sequence alignment of H1-HA1 and H5-HA1 by BLAST. Asterisks and dots represent identities and positives, respectively. (TIF) S2 Fig. Hemagglutination assay. The purified HA1 proteins have hemagglutination activity. When 30 \u03bcg of H1-HA1 was mixed with 40 \u03bcl of 1% (v/v) chicken RBCs, efficient agglutination of erythrocytes started. In case of H5-HA1, aggregation of erythrocytes started from 35 \u03bcg of the protein. Same experiments were repeated with BSA as a negative control. (TIF) S3 Fig. Western blot analysis with whole cell lysates. The selected aptamers does not bind to cell lysates, which indicates no non-specific binding of aptamers to cell lysates. Beta-actin was used as a control. (TIF) S4 Fig. Western blot analysis with commercial antibodies and the selected aptamers. The band intensities generated using commercial antibodies (HA1 and GST antibodies) and the selected aptamers were similar to each other. (TIF) S1 Methods.
