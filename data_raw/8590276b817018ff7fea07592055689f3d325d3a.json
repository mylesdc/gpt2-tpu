Recently, the crystal structure of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) PL1 has been solved, which was similar to that of SARS-CoV PL2 pro , which may antagonize host innate immunity. However, very little is known about whether TGEV PL1 can antagonize host innate immune response. Here, we presented evidence that TGEV PL1 encoded by the replicase gene could suppress the IFNexpression and inhibit the nuclear translocation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). The ability to antagonize IFN-production was dependent on the intact catalytic activity of PL1. Furthermore, TGEV PL1 exerted deubiquitinase (DUB) activity which strongly inhibited the retinoic acid-induced gene I-(RIG-1-) and stimulator of interferon gene-(STING-) dependent IFN expression. Our data collectively suggest that TGEV PL1 can inhibit the IFN-expression and interfere with RIG-1-and STING-mediated signaling through a viral DUB activity. Our study has yielded strong evidence for the TGEV PL1 mechanisms that counteract the host innate immunity.",

The initiation of IFN expression is triggered by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) through host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) [2] . After viral RNAs are sensed by PRRs, signals are transmitted to different downstream adaptor molecules (such as IFNpromoter stimulator 1 (IPS-1)); and then I B kinase-(IKK-) related kinases are recruited. Next, interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), nuclear factor B (NF-B), and ATF-2/c-jun are activated by the kinase complexes and translocate to the nucleus and directly induce the expression of type I IFNs [3] .",

CoVs are positive-strand RNA viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm of infected cells [4] . CoVs encode two types of cysteine proteases, M pro , and papain-like proteases, PL1 and PL2, which contained nonstructural protein 5 (nsp5) and nsp3, respectively. PL pro is served mainly as in processing of the replicase pp1a and pp1ab polypeptides [5] . Other than their role in replicase polyprotein processing, PL2 domains possess an additional but related enzymatic activity, in HCoV-NL63 [6] , MHV [7] , SARS-CoV [8, 9] , and MERS-CoV [10] , through their deubiquitination (DUB) enzymes, which play a key role in antagonizing IFN induction. However, TGEV PL1 processes the nsp2/nsp3 site and is capable of hydrolyzing isopeptide bonds in both Lys48-and 2 BioMed Research International Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains [11] . Whether TGEV PL1 could antagonize the production of IFNs was unknown.",

In order to determine whether TGEV PL1 is capable of blocking IFN-production, we assessed IFN-promoter activity in the presence of PL1 (Figure 1(a) ). HEK 293T cells were cotransfected with TGEV PL1 and IFN-luciferase or Renilla luciferase reporter plasmids for 24 h and subsequently infected with SeV to activate the RIG-1-dependent IFN-expression pathway. We observed the inhibition of SeV-induced IFN-promoter activation in the presence of PL1, similar to the antagonistic function of NL63 PLP2 and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) PLP2, clearly indicating that TGEV PL1 could act as an interferon antagonist. To establish the mechanisms by which PL1 inhibits IFNexpression, transcriptional activities of NF-B, IRF3, and AP-1 were analyzed using the luciferase assay to identify the precise transcription factor involved. Notably, the luciferase activities of all three transcription factors were significantly inhibited by TGEV PL1 in a dose-dependent manner ( Figures  1(b) , 1(c), and 1(d)). Furthermore, Flag-PL1 also significantly inhibited IFN-production in PK-15 cells at protein level ( Figure 1(e) ), which was further confirmed with the result that TGEV PL1 could block the production of interferon. To further establish whether TGEV PL1 affects IRF3 phosphorylation or migration from the cytoplasm to nucleus, HEK293T cells were transfected with TGEV PL1 and/or IRF3-EGFP. Then the result was analyzed using Western blot and confocal microscopy. In Figure 1(f) , the level of p-IRF3 was decreased significantly by TGEV PL1 compared with that of SeV-induced. Furthermore, IRF3-EGFP was located in the cytoplasm compared with mock-infected HEK293T cells but translocated to the nucleus when the cells were inoculated with SeV. In contrast, after being inoculated with SeV, it was found that IRF3-EGFP was translocated from cytoplasm to nuclear in mock infected HEK293T cell, which was not observed in cells transfected with TGEV PL1 (Figure 1(g) ).",

TGEV PL1 mutation at two of the catalytic sites (C32A and H183A) led to almost complete loss of IFN antagonistic activity, relative to wild-type TGEV PL1, but the D196A mutant showed a little inhibition for IFN-promoter activity (Figures 3(a), 3(b) , 3(c), 3(d), and 3(e)). Based on the results, we conclude that the intact catalytic triad of TGEV PL1 is required to inhibit activation of the IFN-promoter driven by STING and TBK-1. Recent studies have revealed that STING acts as a scaffold protein for TBK-1 and IRF3 and links them to the MAVS complex in mitochondria upon viral infection [16] . Moreover, activation of STING is critical for stimulation of IRF-3 activity. Here, we observed that TGEV PL1 protein inhibits STING-and TBK-1-induced activation of IFN-.

Recently, DUBs have been reported in a variety of viruses, such as foot-and-mouth disease virus, Lpro [23] , human cytomegalovirus, UL48 [24] , herpes simplex virus type 1, UL36 [25] , and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, nsp2 [26, 27] . Interestingly, all CoVs have evolved to encode DUB enzymes, which may contribute to modulation of the innate immune response. PLP of HCoV-NL63, SARS-CoV, MHV, PEDV, and MERS-CoV dramatically reduced the levels of ubiquitinated STING, RIG-I, TBK1, and IRF-3 to negatively regulate host antiviral innate immunity. Here, we showed that TGEV PL1 interferes with and significantly inhibits ubiquitination of RIG-1 and STING, which are essential activators of type I IFN signaling. Then, the levels of phosphorylated IRF-3 were reduced, which blocked nuclear translocation of IRF3 to activate the transcript of IFNs. Three catalytically inactive mutants of TGEV PL1 (C32A, H183A, and D196A) found to be defective in DUB activity failed to inhibit virus-induced INF-expression, indicating that the DUB function of TGEV PL1 is directly involved in inhibition of type I IFN induction. However, the membrane protein M and envelope protein E of TGEV were translated at the late step of the replication as the major inducing component of IFNs. Further studies are required to establish the precise functions of PL1 protease/DUB activity in coronavirus interactions with the host innate immune response.",

We found that TGEV PL1 displayed IFN antagonist activity dependent on the intact catalytic triad (C32, H183, and D196) and interfered with RIG-1-and STING-mediated signaling through a viral DUB activity. These characteristics of TGEV PL1 served as a multifunctional protein with a critical regulatory role in TGEV interactions with the host antiviral innate immune response. Moreover, these findings contribute to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of innate immunity evasion strategies utilized by TGEV.",
