Seven index cases out of 152 total cases from the Ebola outbreak in Guinea did not have known possible times of infection. Incubation periods were not estimated for these individuals in the original manuscript describing this outbreak (6) , and these seven observations were excluded from our analysis, leaving 145 observations of the incubation period for Ebola. We note that there may be biased sampling of incubation periods as typically only more severe cases may be reported or observed, and these cases may have different incubation periods than cases with less severe symptoms.",

For parameter uncertainty, we computed each outcome scenario probability from a sample of the posterior distribution of gamma parameters for a fixed u. For uncertainty in the infection time, we assumed that u was distributed uniformly, and calculated outcome probabilities for a set of random samples from this distribution while holding the gamma parameters fixed at their posterior median values. To account for both uncertainties, we sampled simultaneously from both distributions. We chose the maximum u value such that max(u)/2 + m = 90 th percentile of T. This implies that for Ebola max(u) = 16.8 days. While our model explicitly propagates uncertainty in the incubation period distribution, a formal, data-driven understanding of the uncertainty for other model parameters is not likely to be available to public health practitioners in practice. For one of the most critical model parameters, the probability that a monitored individual is infected with the disease of interest, our model can assess several different plausible values at a single time. Four model parameters (reproductive rate of the disease, cost of a false positive, cost per person-day of monitoring, and cost per case) are each specified to lie within a fixed range.

Similarly, we extrapolate that 1000 some or high risk individuals could have been eligible for monitoring in the United States over the entire course of the outbreak.

This represented 5,025 unique persons, some of whom were monitored on more than one occasion. During the course of these individuals being actively monitored by DOHMH, some individuals developed symptoms that could possibly have indicated the onset of Ebola. Specifically, there were 122 occasions of an individual experiencing fever, diarrhea, vomiting, or unexplained bleeding/bruising. These symptomatic individuals were evaluated by DOHMH staff, and 39 were referred for follow-up testing for Ebola at a hospital or other medical facility. We assumed that 30 of those seeking care sought care at a hospital, representing 1% of the total number of monitored individuals. Subsequent analyses showed little sensitivity to this assumption, as the overall proportion was so small.
