Viral phylogenies are commonly inferred from aligned molecular sequence data, using the information available in substitutions shared by descent [3] [4] [5] [6] . Short time-scales dominate in the development of rapidly emerging disease strains, such that the number of observed substitutions between sequences can be too low to yield well-resolved phylogenies.

            "text": "Insertions and deletions (indels) are a promising category of molecular sequence information that is largely ignored in phylogenetic reconstruction. Researchers commonly remove gaps from molecular sequences alignments by coding them as missing data or by throwing out columns that contain gaps [3] [4] [5] [6] . Indels may be useful to resolve deep branches in the Tree of Life that are difficult to resolve using information in shared substitutions [7, 8] . At the other extreme, on which we focus here, indels can help to resolve phylogenies in situations where the number of nucleotide substitutions is inadequate. For example, indels in non-coding chloroplast DNA have been helpful in resolving the branching order of recent plant radiations [9, 10] . The rate of indel events in these regions approaches or surpasses the rate of substitution, making indels too important to ignore [10] . Several species of viruses are also known to accumulate indels, sometimes at a high rate. Cheyner et al. [11] note that indel rates are higher than substitution rates in hyper-variable regions of Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV) and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). Other viruses also experience indels on short time-scales. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) accumulates deletions in the core/pre-core region during the course of infection [12] , while Equine Infectious Anemia Virus accumulates insertions [13] . Three deletion variants of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) appeared during the beginning of the SARS outbreak in China [14] . Influenza B viruses accumulate indels over several decades [15] . We note that these viruses are all RNA viruses, with the exception of HBV. Although HBV is a DNA virus, it reverse transcribes its DNA genome from an RNA intermediate. Redelings and Suchard (2005) describe a statistical method of incorporating indel information into phylogeny estimation. This method uses a joint reconstruction framework that simultaneously infers the alignment, tree, and insertion/deletion rates. Estimation proceeds through Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) within a Bayesian framework and naturally accounts for uncertainty in alignments, phylogenies, and other parameters through posterior probabilities. Unlike sensitivity analysis [16, 17] , this approach takes into account uncertainty resulting from the myriad of near-optimal alignments. This approach involves averaging over unobserved quantities such as the alignment and interal node states, which can lead to improved estimates [18] . This is different from other approaches which iteratively optimize a heuristically chosen cost function until no improvement is seen [19, 20] . Joint estimation of alignment and phylogeny sidesteps bias that results from conditioning on a single alignment estimate [21, 18] , bias which may be exaggerated when indel information is inappropriately used. This method is based on a probabilistic model of sequence evolution that contains insertion and deletion events as well as substitution events. Heuristic \"costs\" for opening and extending gaps are replaced by the insertion/ deletion rate and the mean indel length respectively, which are biologically interpretable parameters and can be estimated from the data without circularity [22, 23] . Gaps are not treated as a fifth character state, since this overweights the evidence of shared indels by treating an indel of multiple residues as multiple shared indels [3] . Instead, the indel process is separate and independent of the substitution process, and allows indels of several residues simultaneously. In addition, because alignments represent positional homology, the indel process does not allow a newly inserted character to be aligned to a previously deleted character.",

Under both models, we fixed f = for equivalence and set independent nucleotide frequencies to their empirical estimates. The log marginal likelihood is -1555.7 \u00b1 0.3 for the singlet model and -1579.8 \u00b1 0.3 for the triplet model (Table 2) . To examine the substantial decrease of 24.1 log units between models, we calculate the posterior distribution of parsimony tree lengths under both models. The posterior median tree length is 104 substitutions with a 95% BCI of (103,106) for the singlet model and increases to 109 substitutions with a 95% BCI of (108,110) for the triplet model. To verify that this increase results from forcing indels out of phase, we first calculate the posterior distribution of the number of indels under the singlet model. The posterior mean number of indels is 11.0 and the BCI is (11, 11) . The posterior mean number of indels beginning 0, 1, or 2 nucleotides from the beginning of a codon is 2.6, 5.8, and 2.6 respectively. The 95% BCI for the number of indels beginning inside a codon is (6, 10) . Inspecting the alignment estimate from the MAP point using a \"gold\" plot demonstrates alignment uncertainty (data not shown). In the MAP alignment we observe 11 indel events. Only 5 of the indels are consistently present with unambiguous phase, and none of these indels can be placed between codons. Interestingly, one indel of 3 nucleotides occurs independently in clades (16, 17) , 19 , and 22 according to the MAP estimate ( Figure 5 ). We note that augmented alignments such as those used in our model distinguish between indels shared by state and indel shared by descent through the inclusion of Felsenstein wildcard sequences at internal nodes of \u03c4.",

The posterior odds in favor of the clade (10, 12, 18) decrease by a factor of 8.0 from 24.6 to 3.1 ( Table 2) . We note that in one column of the singlet MAP alignment estimate, only variants 10, 12 and 18 have an A residue, while other taxa have either a G residue or a gap (Figure 5a) . However, the triplet model shifts these gaps out of the column to avoid breaking a codon. Taxa that contain a gap in this column under the singlet alignment contain A residues according to the triplet MAP alignment, decreasing the support for (10, 12, 18) clade ( Figure 5b) .

However, accounting for the fact that one triplet contains three nucleotides, the HKY \u00d7 3 model predicts a mean indel length of 1.1 triplets and 3.2 nucleotides, but the HKY model predicts a mean indel length of 1.6 nucleotides. This may be because a geometric distribution on the number of nucleotides in a gap does not fit the data as well as a geometric distribution on the number of triplets in a gap. This is especially true in data sets such as the present one in which the number of triplets tends to be small. It may also be because the indel model used is fragment-based. Finally, we note that estimates of 7.5 for \u03ba in the HKY \u00d7 3 model are quite similar to estimates of about 7.2 under the HKY model.",

The number of branches supported only under the joint model is 2, 2, and 2. The joint model supports the clades (16, 17) and (21, 24 ) over the traditional model at all three levels of PP. The traditional model supports the clade (19, 21, 24, 25) at a PP of 0.980 compared to 0.887 with indel information. The traditional model also supports the clade (10, 12, 15, 16, 18, 19, 21, 24, 25) at PP > 0.9 that has support < 0.5 when indel information is included. This results because the large clade conflicts with the clade (16, 17) that is supported by two shared indels. Thus, the number of branches supported in only one of the two models at each level of PP is 4, 3, and 2. Since the joint model balances substitution and indel information as well as taking alignment ambiguity into account we assume that these differences represent an improvement in the accuracy of estimation. However, because the true tree is not observed, we cannot be certain which, if any, of the predictions is correct. The partitions supported under the two models at PP > 0.99 are depicted in Figure 6 . In summary, indel information conflicts with one branch in the substitution-only tree and down-weights the evidence for another branch. The conflicting branch is ruled out by the support of 2 shared indels for the clade (16, 17) , although one of these is homoplastic.",

Triplet alignments may shift indels and cause misaligned residues. (a) Maximum a posteriori (MAP) alignment estimate under the singlet HKY model. (b) MAP alignment estimate under the triplet HKY \u00d7 3 model. In the triplet alignment, two G residues (blue) and four A residues (red) are forced into a different column to avoid breaking the alignment-wide reading frame. The displaced A residues join A residues from strains 10, 12, and 18 (green) which were previously the only A residues in that column. Under both models, the MAP alignment estimates display 8 gaps. The alignment of internal sequences (not shown) indicates that these gaps arose from 5 indel events on branches partitioning clades (20, 23) , (21, 24) , (16, 17) , (19) , and (22) . Thus, the gaps in sequences 19 and 22 arose independently of the gap in (16,17) even though they have the same length and position.

Golenberg et al. analyze non-coding spacer regions between chloroplast genes in a parsimony framework and claim that indels shared by state recur more often than substitutions shared by state [32] , leading to a concern that indels are not reliable characters for phylogenetic analysis. However, Simmons and Ochoterana find indels to be reliable markers with low levels of homoplasy [33] . This contrast is partially explained by noting that the original Golenberg study incorrectly codes overlapping gaps of different lengths as homologous, leading to false homoplasy. Improved methods of coding indels when gaps overlap can lead to more accurate and more informative indel characters [33, 34] . In addition, researchers note that chloroplast intergenic spacers contain indel \"hotspots\" and that sequence duplications or changes in the number of tandem repeats occur at a significantly higher rate than non-repeat indels [32, 10] . This high rate can lead to identical but non-homologous insertions in different taxa, and so repeat indels experience higher homoplasy than non-repeat indels [9] . Repeat indels should therefore be down-weighted, but unfortunately an appropriate weighting scheme has not yet been developed [35] . We also note that current alignment algorithms do not recognize duplications or indel hotspots, so that automatic alignments must be adjusted manually. Despite these difficulties with repeat indels, researchers have examined intergenic spacers in various plant species using improved indel coding and find that indel information is consistent with substitution information and largely reinforces it, improving phylogenetic resolution and support [9, 10] . In some analyses, indels are useful only in distinguishing larger groups [36] . Despite the utility of indels in phylogeny estimation, most researchers note difficulties in indel coding that result from alignment ambiguity [35] . This can be true even when the number of substitutions is too small to yield well-resolved phylogenies. While alignment ambiguity causes general problems with gap placement, some specific problems are worthy of mention. For example, aligning insertions of questionable homology may create spurious evidence for common ancestry [35] . Also, when the number of tandem sequence repeats decreases, it is unclear which repeat has been deleted. Resolving these ambiguities to yield a single alignment can increase the support for some trees while decreasing the support for others, leading to bias, and so regions whose homology is uncertain should be thrown out [35] .",

Although the indel model described here improves on common multiple alignment algorithms by allowing indels to be shared by descent, it has some limitations. First, the model assumes that the indel rate is spatially homogeneous. However, biological sequences contain indel \"hotspots\" where indels are more likely to occur as well as invariant regions where indels are prohibited. Incorrectly accounting for rates at which indels occur in different regions can lead to over-weighting of the indel evidence. Clustal W attempts to place indels in hydrophilic regions of amino acid sequences, but does not have a mechanism for locating hotspots in non-coding sequences or hotspots resulting from weak selection or positive selection. Second, the indel model makes the common assumption that residues in a single sequence are never homologous. Duplications violate this assumption and are treated as insertions of random sequence by the indel process. Third, changes in the number of tandem repeats of a short sequence often occur at a higher rate than other indels via slipped-strand mispairing (SSM). However, no commonly used alignment program accounts for within-sequence homology or SSM. An improved stochastic process model that accounts for these properties of biological sequences is highly desirable in order to accurately weight shared indel evidence and to produce both more accurate alignments and phylogenies.",

Forcing indels to codon boundaries results in a decrease in model fit of 24.1 log units because of an increase in the number of inferred substitutions. Thus choosing a codon model over a singlet model involves a tradeoff between a substantially improved substitution model and a possibility of incorrect homology in the alignment. Because the effects of the latter can be significant when the total number of substitutions is small, we welcome the development of an improved substitution model that does not force this tradeoff. Such a substitution model would be able to calculate the likelihood of a singlet alignment while making use of codon frequencies and differentiating between synonymous and non-synonymous changes.",

We call f(x) a collapsing function if for any x and y in \u03a9 we have x \u2208 f(x) and f(x) and f(y) are either identical or disjoint. If f is a collapsing function, then it partitions \u03a9 into a set of non-overlapping subsets, which we refer to as collapsed points. We denote the set of collapsed points as f(\u03a9), and note that the probability \u03c0*(f(x)) of each collapsed point f(x) can be naturally defined as the integral of the probabilities \u03c0(y) of points y \u2208 f(x). Because the collapsed points are disjoint sets, these probabilities sum to 1 and yield a probability distribution on collapsed points.",

From here it may terminate by transitioning to the end state (E), or it may enter a match (+/+), insert (-/+) or delete (+/-) fragment. Each fragment has probability \u03b4(t) of being an insert or delete fragment. Fragment lengths are geometric with continuation probability \u03b5. After the end of a fragment, the Markov chain returns to the central silent state where it may begin a new fragment. The silent state that indicates fragment boundaries can be removed, resulting in transitions only between non-silent states. The model is a fragment based model because the direct transition probability from (+/+) to (+/+) without going through the silent state is \u03b5 and not 0. The pair-HMM represents an improper distribution because the probabilities of outgoing edges of the central silent state do not sum to 1. terms of substitution time and refer to the pairwise alignment distribution on branch b as .

This means that it is often impractical to analyze data sets with greater than 12 taxa or sequence lengths longer than about 750 letters (nucleotide, amino acid, or codon). Analyzing data sets of this size often takes about a week on current hardware. However, we wish to emphasize two points. First, the long computation time is not required to make a simple estimate, but to obtain measures of confidence that are accurate enough to publish. For simple estimates or unpublished results, significantly larger data sets can be analyzed. Second, the amount of time required to analyze a data set depends not just on the size of the data set, but on various characteristics such as the level of uncertainty. For example, the second example in this paper contains 27 taxa of maximum length 612 and took about 3 weeks to analyze.",
