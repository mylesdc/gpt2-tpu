Both pseudotyped lentiviral vectors transduced cancer stem-like cells characterized by their CD133-, nestin-and SOX2-expression, the ability to form spheroids in neural stem cell medium and to express astrocytic and neuronal differentiation markers under serum conditions. In a therapeutic approach using the suicide gene herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-1-tk) fused to eGFP, both lentiviral vectors mediated a complete remission of solid tumors as seen on MRI resulting in a highly significant survival benefit (p,0.001) compared to control groups.

Therefore, this model is well suited for the study of new therapeutic strategies. Still, reports using this or other clinically relevant models for experimental therapy are scarce. Recently, we analyzed the therapeutic potential of the HSV-1-based oncolytic Herpes vector G207 in the biopsy spheroid-based GBM model. The tumor volume in treated animals was reduced compared to control groups, but there was no significant survival advantage [4] . In contrast, the same therapy was more effective in a cell line-based animal model [5] and as a result is currently investigated in a phase I/II clinical study [6] . In the present investigation we used the invasive xenograft model to evaluate transduction and therapeutic efficacy of lentiviral pseudotyped vectors. Gammaretroviral vectors derived from the Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV) have been the most frequently used retroviruses for gene therapy of brain tumors [7] [8] [9] [10] . However, despite promising results in animal models, clinical trials using retroviral vector supernatants or retroviral packaging cells have failed [11] [12] [13] . One major drawback of gammaretroviral vectors is the exclusive transduction of dividing cells, since in human gliomas, the majority of tumor cells do not divide within a given treatment window. Therefore, lentiviral vectors with their ability to also transduce non-dividing cells are attractive candidates for the treatment of brain cancer. In previous studies, we have developed gammaretroviral and lentiviral vectors pseudotyped with the glycoproteins (GP) of the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) [14, 15] . These vectors have a broad host range and can be concentrated by ultracentrifugation for in vivo applications. In addition, LCMV-GP is not cytotoxic, and stable recombinant packaging cell lines can be established [16, 17] . Recently, we showed that lentiviral LCMV-GP pseudotypes efficiently delivered transgenes to rat glioma cells in vivo, while resident neurons were not transduced [18] . Furthermore, we showed a significant therapeutic effect of LCMV-GP pseudotyped lentiviral vectors in the cell-line based 9L rat glioma model using the suicide gene HSV-1-tk. VSV-G lentiviral pseudotypes also showed a significant efficacy, similar to that of LCMV pseudotypes, which was mainly mediated by a bystander effect of transduced normal brain cells [19] .",

Briefly, tissue samples were minced into ,0.5 mm fragments and placed into 80 cm 2 tissue culture flasks (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) base-coated with 0.75% agar (Difco, Detroit, MI). The spheroids were maintained in a standard tissue culture incubator with 5% CO 2 and 100% relative humidity at 37uC. The medium was changed once a week. Spheroids with diameters between 400 and 600 mm were selected for in vitro experiments and for intracerebral implantation.",

The vectors were injected into the center of progressively growing lesions using microprocessor-controlled stereotactic infusion. The injection coordinates were estimated after analyzing MRI images for each individual lesion. The injection volume applied was 2610 ml and the vector titre 1610 7 / ml for all vectors. Transduction efficiency was evaluated 7 days after vector injection. Both lentiviral pseudotyped vectors showed very efficient transduction of the tumors ( Figure 3A,D) . When analyzed at higher magnification, both LCMV-GP and VSV-G pseudotyped lentiviral vectors showed efficient transgene delivery to nestin-positive tumor cells in solid ( Figure 3B ,E) and invasive tumor areas ( Figure 3C ,F). In contrast, the retroviral vector only transduced a few scattered tumor cells near the injection site (Figure 3 G,H) . For a quantitative comparison of transduction efficiency between the two lentiviral pseudotyped vectors, the GFP-positive areas were measured on histological slides (see material and methods). The total volume of transduced tumor tissue was 7.0563.51 mm 3 for LCMV-GP pseudotyped vectors and 4.0562.04 mm 3 for VSV-G pseudotyped vectors ( Figure 3I) .

This model was established several years ago [20] and its growth pattern as well as geno-and phenotypic similarity to glioblastoma in patients has been extensively characterized [3] . A striking difference of our model compared to other cell-line based models is the highly invasive behaviour of the lesions, similar to glioblastoma in patients. Our model is based on spheroids derived from patient biopsies that are passaged serially in the brains of nude rats. First generation tumors are highly invasive and grow without signs of angiogenesis. Late generation tumors show an angiogenic phenotype, but are still invasive. Our in vitro experiments revealed that both lentiviral vectors transduced spheroids derived from both low and high generation tumors very efficiently. In contrast, retroviral vectors transduced only high generation spheroids and displayed a much lower efficiency of gene transfer than both lentiviral vectors. This difference can only be attributed to the vector backbone, as the glycoprotein which is responsible for virus entry into the cell was the same for the retroviral and one of the lentivral vectors applied (LCMV-GP). The most important feature that distinguishes lentiviral from retroviral vectors is their ability to infect non-dividing cells. It is known that glioma spheroids, especially primary biopsy spheroids, contain a significant fraction of non-dividing cells, which cannot be transduced by retroviral vectors. It has previously been shown that the cultured biopsy spheroids show a similar cell proliferation as seen in glioblastoma patients [20] .",

In previous studies using a rat glioma model, we also showed a more specific transduction of glioma cells by LCMV-GP pseudotyped vectors compared to VSV-G pseudotyped vectors [18, 19] . In fact, in these studies, the VSV-G pseudotyped vectors transduced normal brain cells at a much higher frequency than in this study. This can be explained by the mode of vector delivery, because in the previous studies, we injected the vectors both into the tumor core as well as into tumor border areas. In the present study, we injected the vectors into the tumor core only using convection enhanced delivery. We used this method because it results in a high distribution volume of drug and vector and is currently used as a delivery method in clinical studies [28] . In addition, the tumor model we apply here is highly invasive and lacks a sharply demarcated brain tumor/normal brain interface, present in the rat glioma model. Another explanation could be the species difference as we used human glioma cells in this study in contrast to rat glioma cells in the previous work. VSV-G pseudotyped vectors might have a higher tropism for human glioma cells than for rat normal host cells. However, as the receptor for VSV-G is unknown [29] , this remains a hypothesis. The targeting of cancer stem cells or cancer stem-like cells in human tumors including glioblastoma has recently evolved as a major aim in cancer therapy. These stem cells are suggested to initiate cancer and might be resistant to therapy, thus being responsible for tumor recurrence [30] [31] [32] . Yet, recent studies have initiated a controversial discussion whether cancer stem cells really exist [33, 34] . Therefore, we use the term ''cancer stem-like cells'' in our study to designate cells which have certain stem-like properties described previously. We showed that both lentiviral vectors transduced CD133-positive and CD133-negative cells. CD133-positive cells have been identified as cancer initiating cells and cancer stem cells in many different cancers including glioblastoma [30, 35] . However, more recent reports questioned these findings showing that CD133-negative popopulations can include cancer initiating cells as well [36, 37] . The efficient targeting of CD133-positive and CD133-negative glioma cells has also been described for adenoviral vectors [38, 39] .",

Spheroids from both sorted cell populations expressed the neural stem cell markers nestin and SOX2 and showed the ability to express the differentiation markers GFAP and b-tubulinIII under serum conditions. These properties have been described for neural progenitor cells [40] as well as for cancer stem-like cells in human glioblastoma [26] . Thus, the cell populations transduced by LCMV or VSV pseudotyped lentiviral vectors showed features of cancer stem-like cells which might be an important target for therapy.",

Using MRI to follow tumor growth, we detected complete remission in 7 out of 8 animals for LCMV-GP and VSV-G pseudotyped vectors after 30 days of ganciclovir treatment. HSV-1-tk has been reported to be an effective therapeutic gene in previous studies [19, 41] . The limited success in clinical studies has been a result of inefficient gene delivery systems rather than lack of efficacy of the suicide mechanism [11] . However, there is still space for improvement of the prodrug delivery such as application length, treatment intervals and route of delivery. Tai et al. demonstrated that multiple cycles of prodrug application are superior over one cycle of prodrug [42] . In our study, we still detected GFP-positive tumor cells after one cycle (30 days) of ganciclovir administration in treated animals indicating that application in cycles might also improve the therapeutic effect in this setting. Further, these results demonstrate that vector-transduced tumor cells retain the ability to invade brain tissue and migrate even to distant brain regions.",
