Leukocytes activated in an adaptive immune response access brain tissue by passing through the blood-brain barrier. The chemokine CCL5/RANTES is involved in recruitment of these cells to the brain acting via the receptors CCR1, CCR3 and mainly CCR5. Here, we evaluated the role of CCR5 on traffic of leukocytes in the brain microvasculature, cellular and cytokines profile in a severe form of herpetic encephalitis. Results: Wild type and mice lacking CCR5 (CCR5 -/-) were inoculated intracerebrally with 10 4 PFU of neurotropic HSV-1. We evaluated the traffic of leukocytes in the brain microvasculature using intravital microscopy and the profile of cytokines by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay at 1 day post infection. Flow cytometry and histopathological analyses were also carried out in brain tissue. Absence of CCR5 leads to lower viral load and an increased leukocyte adhesion in brain microvasculature, predominantly of neutrophils (CD11 + Ly6G + cells). Moreover, there was a significant increase in the levels of MIP-1/CCL2, RANTES/CCL5, KC/CXCL1 and MIG/CXCL9 in the brain of infected CCR5 -/mice.",

Conventional treatment of HSV-1 encephalitis (HSE) involves the use of antiviral therapies, current guidelines for the treatment of HSV-1 recommend intravenous acyclovir [2] . However, there is some evidence showing that modulation of inflammatory response may be beneficial [3] . In this regard, Kamei and coworkers [4] showed that higher proinflammatory cytokine levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from HSE patients were associated with a worse outcome of the disease and the decrease in cytokine levels after corticosteroid treatment resulted in a better outcome. Therefore the severity of the HSE depends at least in part on the inflammatory response [4] .",

The recruitment of leukocytes is composed of a series of events which are dependent on multiple protein interactions [5] [6] [7] . Intravital microscopy studies allow the visualization of leukocyte/endothelial cell interaction in vessels in vivo and have revealed that leukocytes must first tether and roll along the venular wall before they can attach firmly and emigrate out of the vasculature [8, 9] .",

CCL5/RANTES is a chemokine member of CC family that recruits monocytes, T cells, basophils and eosinophils, acting via the receptors CCR1, CCR3 and CCR5 [13] . Chemokines constitute a rapidly growing family of proteins and receptor-chemokine interactions are known to be promiscuous and redundant. For instance, CCR5 is a Gprotein-coupled seven-transmembrane receptor expressed in different cell types like T cells, macrophages, dendritic cells and microglia, and that binds to several chemokines, including: CCL3 (MIP-1alpha/Macrophage Inflammatory Protein b-chemokine), CCL4 (MIP-1beta), CCL5 (RANTES), CCL8 (MCP-2), CCL11 (eotaxin), CCL14 (HCC-1), CCL16 (HCC-4) [14] . Besides the CC family of chemokines, there is also the CXC family of chemokines, which is important in the chemotaxis of several immune cells. For example, Kc/CXCL-1 and MIG/ CXCL9 are chemokines that attract neutrophils and T cell to the inflammatory site, respectively. Kc presents a chemotactic role similar to that played by the human CXCL8.",

These conflicting results suggest that there is a Figure 5 Chemokine levels in the CNS after intracerebral inoculation with 10 4 PFU of HSV-1 in WT (n = 10) and CCR5 -/mice (n = 13). Cytokines were measured in brain extracts by ELISA at 1 dpi.

Statistical analysis used: one-way ANOVA with Tukey correction. significant difference between the immune response elicited in the periphery (i.e. cornea) and the response in the CNS in CCR5 -/mice infected with HSV-1. When the virus is inoculated in peripheral sites, such as cornea, an immune response against HSV-1 can develop in trigeminal ganglia and related lymph nodes. This response can modulate the immune response before HSV-1 reaches the CNS, differing from the current study in which the virus was directly inoculated in the brain. Previous studies involving other knock out mice have also demonstrated conflicting data depending on the route of HSV-1 inoculation. For instance, Lundberg and coworkers [29] demonstrated that TNF-\u03b1 antiviral effects are independent of TNFR1 in mice infected with HSV-1 by corneal scarification. When the virus was inoculated in the periphery of C57BL/6 mice, immune response of the host efficiently controlled virus infection even without TNFR1 [29] . Conversely, it was described a significant decrease in the survival rate of TNFR1 \u2212/\u2212 mice infected by intracranial route [30] . The use of intracranial route is a way to elicit an immune response directly from the CNS, aiming to exclude immune activation in the periphery. In this regard, TNFR1 seemed to be relevant for the control of HSV-1 replication in CNS when there is no activation of the immune system in the periphery [30] .",

CD8 + T lymphocytes are the first mononuclear cells that cross the blood brain barrier and move toward the infected tissue. The role played by CD8 + lymphocytes in HSV-1 encephalitis is still controversial. While one study reported no significant differences in viral load or viral reactivation when the virus was injected in cornea of mice lacking CD8 + T cells [33] , another report showed persistent elevated viral titers in the brain of CD8-deficient, suggesting a role for CD8 + T cells in the control of HSV-1 replication [34] . In the current study, we found no difference in the levels of CD8 + lymphocytes in CCR5 -/mice, thus, these cells cannot account for the decrease in viral load in the brain of CCR5 -/mice. Following CD8 + T lymphocytes, tissuepenetrating Th1 CD4 + T cells contact local antigen presenting cells. This may result in an up-regulation of MHC molecules and secretion of more chemotactic molecules [35] . The inflammatory site during encephalitis involves the immune cells cited above and also B cells. Mice deficient for B cell had increased susceptibility to HSV-1 after peritoneal infection, presenting increased viral replication in the CNS. Thus, those results evidenced the importance of B cells in the control of viral replication.",

CCL5/RANTES is able to bind other chemokine receptors like CCR1 and CCR3, possibly compensating the absence of CCR5 in the trafficking and migration of leukocytes [36] . Using intravital microscopy, we found that CCR5 -/infected mice presented an increase of leukocyte adhesion to the pial microvasculature. Bearing in mind that CCR5 is one of the most important receptors in leukocyte migration, this result seems paradoxical. However, one limitation of this technique is the impossibility to identify the kind of leukocyte that roll and adhere in vessels [8] .
