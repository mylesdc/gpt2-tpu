Patients presenting with SI can pose a diagnostic challenge for clinicians in determining the underlying etiology; consequently it can be difficult to select the most appropriate options for treatment and patient management 1-5 . There is a clinical need for rapid diagnostic tests that can help clinicians distinguish between non-infectious, viral and bacterial etiologies of SI in (critically ill) patients. Without such tests, patients may be over-prescribed antibiotics when there is little clinical evidence of infection 4, 6 . Reducing inappropriate and unnecessary use of antibiotics, the concept of antibiotic stewardship, is essential in slowing the spread of resistant bacteria 7 .",

Our current investigation builds upon and extends previous host biomarker studies by identifying a molecular signature that is demonstrably specific to SI caused by a broad range of pathogenic viruses that represent all seven Baltimore virus classification groups and that cause infection in different tissues in multiple mammalian species. We used, as a discriminating function, the Area Under Curve (AUC) in Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC) analysis, and boosted specificity by employing a filtering step in our discovery process whereby biomarkers with high AUCs for non-viral causes of SI were removed. Independent validation of the signature in adult and pediatric cohorts demonstrated a strong discrimination of viral vs. non-viral causes of SI. Notably, this viral signature relies on only four biomarkers, and this high degree of parsimony should help to ensure the performance robustness necessary for effective translation to a rapid point-of-care format.",

An initial search was conducted across 13 Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets (Table 1 ) from human adult and pediatric subjects, and one GEO dataset from macaques. These 14 discovery datasets (comprising 417 cases and 182 controls) spanned three Baltimore Group I viruses (cytomegalovirus, human herpesvirus 6, enterovirus), one Group III virus (rotavirus), two Group IV viruses (Dengue, hepatitis C), and six Group V viruses (influenza, Lassa virus, rhinovirus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and measles virus). Next, a comprehensive, stepwise filtering approach was applied to 19 additional GEO datasets comprising a total of 1337 cases and 1106 controls (Table 1) , to exclude genes that were differentially expressed in conditions that may present as SI but appear unrelated to viral systemic inflammation. The end result, after the filtering step was applied, was a \"pan-viral\" signature based on the expression levels of four genes: Interferon Stimulated Gene 15 (ISG15), Interleukin 16 (IL16), 2\u2032,5\u2032-Oligoadenylate Synthetase Like (OASL), and Adhesion G Protein Coupled Receptor E5 (ADGRE5). Table 2 summarizes what is known about the role, function and tissue expression of these four genes. Three of the genes (ISG15, OASL, IL16) have previously been reported to be associated with host response to viral infection, although they are not entirely specific to such a response. The four genes are all strongly expressed in whole blood and white blood cells, and to a lesser degree in most other tissues.",

Adenovirus capsids are known to induce an innate inflammatory response 28 . Gene expression analyses were performed on liver samples taken six hours post-infection for both wild type mice, and mice rendered deficient for complement component 3 (C3) by gene targeting. We observed a clear difference (AUC = 1.00) in pan-viral signature values between infected and mock-infected mice. Whilst the authors found a \"blunted\" immune response to adenovirus injection in the C3-deficient mice, we found little overall difference in pan-viral signature response, suggesting that the absence of C3 does not affect the pan-viral signature value.

This study 30 used an Affymetrix 24 K Genechip Porcine Genome Array to generate gene expression data. This microarray unfortunately did not include the OASL gene. We therefore were limited to analyzing this dataset using a linear combination of just two of the four genes, ISG15 and IL16, which carries most of the diagnostic 32 .

A second clinical study 40 (clinicaltrials.gov reference # NCT02728401) was undertaken that involved pediatric patients (age range: 38 weeks estimated gestational age -18 years) in intensive care (see Supplementary Text S2 and Table S3 for study details, and Table S4 for line data). Using all available clinical information, including clinical microbiology and virus testing, the patients were retrospectively diagnosed with bacterial sepsis (n = 25), bacterial sepsis with a viral coinfection (n = 10), viral SI (n = 5), or sterile post-surgical SI (n = 29). Testing of respiratory samples from the cohort, using the BioFire FilmArray Respiratory Panel (Biofire Diagnostics, Utah, USA), identified viruses in Baltimore group I (varicella-zoster virus; herpes simplex virus), Baltimore group IV (rhinovirus/enterovirus; coronavirus HKU1; norovirus Type 2) and Baltimore group V (parainfluenza 3; respiratory syncytial virus; metapneumovirus). Results are displayed graphically in Fig. 7 , Panel B and summarized in Table 3 .Whilst only a limited number of viral patients were included in this study (n = 5), the pan-viral signature resolved viral SI from non-infectious SI with AUC 0.91, and resolved viral SI from bacterial sepsis with AUC 0.76. Similar to our observation in the adult study (Fig. 7, panel A above) , the pan-viral signature was much less effective at separating bacterial sepsis from non-infectious SI (AUC 0.60) demonstrating that the signature is specific for viral systemic inflammation and not bacterial systemic inflammation. Discordance between RPD and the pan-viral score in some cases suggests the possibility that either some patients had undetected viral infections, that the pan-viral signature had reduced specificity in children, or the study was not sufficiently powered to draw definitive conclusions. Resolution of viral vs. bacterial SI using two specific signatures. We have previously discovered and validated a four-gene host response signature (SeptiCyte TM LAB) for differentiating SI due to either bacterial or non-infectious etiology 41 . Given that the pan-viral signature was developed to be specific for discrimination of viral vs. non-infectious SI, and appears to be largely unaffected by bacterial infection, we hypothesized it would be possible to apply the two signatures simultaneously to allow a three-way discrimination between non-infectious SI, viral SI, and bacterial SI.",

This study enrolled 273 patients of which 115, 70 and 88 received retrospective clinical diagnoses of bacterial infection, viral infection, and non-infectious illness, respectively. We analysed GSE63990 using an 8-gene classifier consisting of the four pan-viral signature genes (IL16, ISG15, OASL, ADGRE5) combined with the four genes (CEACAM4, LAMP1, PLA2G7, PLAC8) from SeptiCyte TM LAB. The line data used in our analysis is given in Supplementary Table S5 . We applied a Random Forest -multidimensional scaling (RF-MDS) analysis 43-45 using the combined eight genes. Figure 8 (Panels A, B) presents two different visual representations of the analysis, which show that the GSE63990 dataset has been resolved into the three patient subgroups of bacterial infection (green), viral infection (purple), and non-infectious illness (orange). An animated representation of this analysis, in which the figure is rotated in three dimensions, is provided in Supplementary Animation S1. To assess whether these 8 genes were contributing materially to the underlying biology, and thus to the clinical diagnoses of viral, bacterial or non-infectious illness, we used the resampling method described by Li et al. 46 and created 2,000 permutations of GSE63990 in which the group labels were randomly shuffled. Application of the Random Forest model to the permuted datasets failed to resolve the three groups, after group label randomization. Thus the classifier was found to be significant under the null hypothesis. That is, the results presented in Fig. 8 illustrate a true dependency between the 8 genes and the response labels, at a significance level of p < 0.001. Additional details of the permutation test are provided in Supplementary Figures S7 and S8 .",

A plausible hypothesis regarding the functional significance of three of the genes in the pan-viral signature (ISG15, OASL, IL16) is that they relate to type 1 interferon signaling. ISG15, a well-studied component of the type 1 interferon-mediated response to viral infection, is a mediator of ISGylation, a protein modification similar to ubiquination [49] [50] [51] [52] . OASL is a non-enzymatic member of the highly conserved OAS gene family 53 and is also a component of the Type 1 interferon response to viral infection 54, 55 . IL16 is a cytokine with multiple functions, having been linked to inhibition of HIV-1 infection 56, 57 , modulation of HBV infection 58 , lentiviral infection 59 and autoimmune and allergic disorders 60, 61 . A paper from some years ago 62 demonstrated that IFN-\u03b1 induces the secretion of IL-16 by several cell types. A more recent paper 63 reported a negative effect of IFN-\u03b21a (a type 1 interferon) on the expression level of IL-16; thus IL16 may also be functionally related to the Type 1 interferon pathway, although the linkage is not especially well studied or documented. Finally, although ADGRE5 has not been linked to interferon Type 1 signaling, this gene has previously been directly associated with host response to infection by human papilloma virus 64 and HIV 65 . Additionally, the ADGRE5 ligand DAF (decay accelerating factor) is the cellular receptor for both echovirus 66, 67 and coxsackie virus 68, 69 .",

However, we have found that prior work was limited by either a large number of genes/probes required, a lack of specificity of the signatures in light of other possible causes of SI, or a lack of validation across a broad range of virus types. For example, Zaas et al. 19 identified a 30-gene signature from microarray analysis of symptomatic vs. asymptomatic subjects infected with rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, or influenza A; this signature was able to discriminate symptomatic influenza A-infected subjects from both healthy subjects and bacterially-infected subjects in a second independent cohort. Other researchers 17, 18, 20, 70 have described signatures for discriminating between viral infections and other conditions, but with limitations relating to the large number of biomarkers in the signature (>18), a limited number of viruses examined, or a lack of demonstrated specificity with respect to possible bacterial co-infection or SI due to non-infectious causes. Tsalik et al. 42 identified host gene expression signatures for viral, bacterial and non-infectious causes of acute respiratory inflammation. Whilst respiratory illness accounts for a large proportion of patients presenting to emergency clinics, the viral signature identified in this study consisted of a large number of genes (n = 33) and was not validated on patients with SI as a result of viral infection of body systems other than respiratory. Sweeney et al. 22, 71 described an 11-gene signature for differentiating infectious and non-infectious SI, and also a 7-gene signature for differentiating bacterial and viral SI, but not non-infectious SI. Used in succession the authors claimed that such signatures could be used as an \"integrated antibiotics decision model\". Finally, Herberg et al. 23 described a two-gene signature for differentiating viral and bacterial infection in febrile children. This signature was developed without using a cohort of non-infectious SI and therefore the output is binary and assumes that patients have a viral or bacterial infection. Our approach to discovery of host response viral biomarkers is novel in comparison to the prior studies because we have: (1) included representative pathogenic viruses from all seven Baltimore viral classification groups, thus providing evidence that innate immune response commonalities may be potentially harnessed for broad diagnostic utility across diverse viral infection; (2) incorporated datasets from multiple mammalian species to demonstrate the robustness that host response -based methods offer; (3) used non-infectious SI as our control group, recognizing the fact that discriminating viral, bacterial, and non-infectious causes of SI is a highly critical and difficult distinction to make on the basis of clinical features alone 6, 41, 71, 72 ; (4) applied a comprehensive specificity screen to eliminate biomarkers that respond to potentially confounding medical conditions or demographic variables; and (5) applied strong selection pressure towards minimizing the number of biomarkers in the pan-viral signature to avoid overfitting and to enable a straightforward conversion to a practical assay format, such as a format employing reverse transcription -quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR).",

Analysis of the time-course datasets revealed that, in general, it took up to three days post-exposure for the pan-viral signature to first register a significant difference compared to pre-exposure samples; the pan-viral signature response coincided with the ability to first detect virus in tissue but preceded viremia, clinical signs and antibody response.",

Once the assay has been translated to a single assay technology and sample type, then more precise comparisons between different viral infections and disease severities can be made. Second, Baltimore Group II is under-represented in our validation data. The dataset that we analyzed (GSE14790, porcine circovirus infection) did not include OASL. Because the genes comprising the pan-viral signature were discovered by a process in which gene pairs were linearly combined, we present results for the linear combination of ISG15 and IL16, which still carries significant diagnostic power in the cohort tested (GSE14790). We expect that eventually additional Baltimore group II datasets will become available, which will allow a more in-depth validation of the pan-viral signature performance in this viral group.",

Our observations from a variety of validation datasets suggest that the pan-viral signature could potentially have multiple clinical applications: as an early diagnostic tool, in monitoring recovery from viral infections, in monitoring host response to therapeutic interventions, in monitoring host response to vaccines, and/or in surveillance of populations at risk. For example, in combination with a bacterial signature that has inherent high negative predictive value, the pan-viral signature could potentially be a useful tool in an antibiotic stewardship program, or in providing guidance for ongoing diagnostic testing. It could also prove useful in identifying patients early in the course of a viral infection, which in turn could affect decisions on infection control and patient isolation, especially in disease outbreaks. Additional clinical studies will be needed to determine if the pan-viral signature has clinical utility for these or other purposes.",

Such specificity allows this signature to be combined with our SeptiCyte TM LAB signature, which has specificity for bacterial SI. The combination of virus-specific and bacteria-specific host SI signatures may provide clinicians with timely information to aid in informed decision making in patients presenting with SI, for example in deciding whether to initiate or cease antibiotics. Ultimately, clinical utility for a \"pan-viral\" signature may be found in combination with an infection status classifier, like that we have previously described 40 whereby together, both the probability of systemic infection, along with infection type (i.e. bacterial vs. viral) can be rapidly determined and factored into patient management and treatment decisions.",

In the discovery phase we searched for RNA transcripts or transcript combinations with expression levels that varied during a host response to viral infection. The initial search was conducted across 13 datasets from human adult and pediatric subjects, plus one set of data from macaques. We expected there to be some variability between datasets in quantification of the levels of particular RNA transcripts because different studies used different sample types, sample collection tubes, experimental platforms (microarrays, RNA-seq), and data reduction/processing methods to estimate gene expression levels. A considerable literature has arisen on comparing gene expression results across platforms [76] [77] [78] [79] and on estimating the biases that may arise specifically within microarray-based approaches 80, 81 and RNA-seq -based approaches [82] [83] [84] .

Regression analysis was then applied across the search space, with RNA transcripts combined in pairs, using a linear objective function with coefficients set to \u22121 or +1 for the log 2 expression value of each transcript in a pair. In theory, each core dataset produced 36,000,000 transcript pairs to examine (not taking into account reciprocal pairs). Setting the coefficients to \u22121 or +1 (instead of allowing the coefficients to vary) reduced the computational effort to a manageable level. ROC curve analysis on each transcript pair then allowed the transcript pairs to be ranked by AUC for their ability to separate the case and control groups in each of the core datasets.",
