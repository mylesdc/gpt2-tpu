            "text": "Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has been widely used to detect oil-spill areas through the backscattering intensity difference between oil and background pixels. However, since the signal is similar to that produced by other phenomena, positive identification can be challenging. In this study we developed an algorithm to effectively analyze large-scale oil spill areas in SAR images by focusing on optimizing the input layer to artificial neural network (ANN) through removal the factor of lowering the accuracy. An ANN algorithm was used to generate probability maps of oil spills. Highly accurate pixel-based data processing was conducted through false or un-detection element reduction by normalizing the image or applying a non-local (NL) means filter and median filter to the input neurons for ANN. In addition, the standard deviation of co-polarized phase difference (CPD) was used to reduce false detection from the look-alike with weak damping effect. The algorithm was validated using TerraSAR-X images of an oil spill caused by stranded oil tanker Volganefti-139 in the Kerch Strait in 2007. According to the validation results of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, the oil spill was detected with an accuracy of about 95.19% and un-detection or false detection by look-alike and speckle noise was greatly reduced.",

Further improved oil spill detection algorithms, which are based on the intensity difference between the target and background pixels, have been proposed by exploiting (i) the texture information of sea surface cover types [14] [15] [16] [17] ; (ii) the statistical value of oil spills [17] [18] [19] or (iii) the edge detection between oil spill and the oil-free surface [20] [21] [22] [23] . However, the methods suffer from a false detection problem due to look-alikes that produce a similar signal with oil spill; for example, low-wind zones (wind speed < 3 m/s), internal wave, ship wake and biogenic films [24, 25] . To overcome this issue, morphological features of oil spills (i.e., perimeter, area, and complexity) or wind data have been used for oil spill detection [13, 26] . However, it can be difficult (i) to define standard shapes for oil spills owing to the high fluidity or (ii) to distinguish the shape of oil spills from that of look-alikes (e.g., ship wake and biogenic films).",

In most studies, an artificial neural network (ANN) of object-based algorithm is usually applied to detect oil spills, the first reason is to use the morphological features as input neurons. The second is that the machine learning method is highly dependent on the input layer, especially, there is a problem that false detection and non-detection due to the noise of the input data is greatly increased when using the pixel-based ANN algorithm. Thus, most studies have adopted an object-based algorithm. However, the object-based algorithm has problems that the dark spot detection accuracy is considerably low, and it is furthermore difficult to automate the algorithm. Moreover, in the case of massive outflow accidents (e.g., the sinking of an oil tanker), it is almost impossible to apply the algorithm because oil forms one big object and normal morphological characteristics can be significantly altered.",

Four polarized images (HH, HV, VV, and VH) can be obtained from SAR sensors according to the transmitting and receiving modes of the radar signal. Among them, co-polarization (HH or VV) occurs when transmit and receive polarizations are identical. The phase difference between VV-and HH-polarized images can be represented by the co-polarized phase difference (CPD), and CPD has a higher correlation with oil spill than it does with look-alikes, which have a weak-damping effect [32] . In addition, the coherence between VV-and HH-polarized images are very low in oil spill areas, whereas it is very high in oil-free areas, which is close to 1. The coherence denotes the degree of correlation between two complex signals. For more optimal solution of oil spill detection using the co-polarized information, we need to focus on the creation process of optimal input neurons for the ANN algorithm from co-polarized SAR imagery, because the creation of optimal input neurons is very important in the ANN technique [33] .",

For this, we focus on (i) the oil spill enhancement from the intensity and phase information of the co-polarized TerraSAR-X imagery and (ii) the precise identification of oil-covered surface from the oil spill-enhanced images via the ANN approach. Four maps were extracted from the HH and VV single-look complex (SLC) images, which include the intensity, texture, coherence and phase texture maps, and then oil-covered areas in the maps were emphasized through multi-looking and the non-local (NL) means and median filtering. The ANN approach is used to generate an oil spill probability map from the four emphasized maps, and then oil-covered areas are identified from the probability map. The oil spill detection performance is validated by using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. In addition, we compare between the results from the presence and absence of the phase information, because most SAR images are acquired from the single-polarization. The proposed method has the advantage that it can estimate the oil spill probability at the pixel unit, and hence it would be effectively used for large-scale oil spill accidents. Moreover, the proposed method enables us (i) to reduce false detection associated with look-alike as well as (ii) to improve the detection performance of oil spill areas.",

Oil spills can be caused by people making mistakes, equipment breaking down, natural disasters, etc. The 2010 Gulf oil spill and the 2011 Bohai bay oil spill are well-known large marine oil spill events [2] [3] [4] [5] . Oil rapidly spreads out on the water's surface, and it forms a thin oil slick. As the oil continues spreading, the oil slick gets thinner, and consequently the slick becomes a very thin sheen. The oil spills can be very harmful to birds, turtles, fishes and shellfish. Thus, it has a negative effect on both economy and ecosystem. The economic damage is caused by the destruction of the ecosystem, and then the oil spill pollution causes, not only immediate damage, but also persistent problems [6] . In order to minimize the damage, it is most important to monitor the oil spill and establish proper measures according to the monitoring results.",

The intensity gives us the reflectivity information of the surface roughness and dielectric constant, while the phase enables us to estimate the scattering information of the object. Since the intensity and phase information are largely dependent on objects, they are allowed to identify the objects from the information. Moreover, texture information can be additionally obtained from both the intensity and phase images. The texture information can be used to further improve object identifications. Figure 2 is a detailed workflow of data processing designed for this study. The HH and VV SLC images were used for generate four input neurons, which are composed of (i) NL-means filtered intensity map; (ii) normalized intensity texture map; (iii) coherence map, and (iv) phase texture map. The ANN was learned by using pixel values of training samples from the four input neurons and an oil spill probability map was then generated by processing through learned neural network and land masking data. The most important points when creating the input layer are (i) to enhance the contrast between target and background pixel values and (ii) to eliminate elements that can cause false detection or un-detection. In the process of generating each input neuron, filter techniques were applied to remove factors that degraded accuracy. In the intensity images, an NL-means filter was used to remove speckle noise that caused un-detection and false detection. In the phase texture and the coherence maps, a median filter was applied to remove ships, which were false sensing elements. In the learning steps of the neural network, a back-propagation algorithm was used. This algorithm updates the weights of hidden layers to minimize total error at the output layer. The ANN algorithm implemented in MATLAB software was used in this study. Four input neurons were learned with sigmoid function and neural networks were iteratively performed during 2000 epochs with 0.01 learning rate. Consequently, eight neurons were in the hidden layer and one linear output layer was created. The hyperparameters were determined by an empirical evaluation. In this study, oil spill samples of ten thousand pixels were selected from the oil spill areas reported by [31, 33] . A total of 50% of the oil spill samples were randomly selected as training/validating data for the two-fold cross-validation, and the others were determined to be test data. The look-alike pixels were used as the non-oil spill training pixels.",

Even though the ship is not completely removed from the coherence image, there is a very low probability of false detection, because the oil spill area and ship are clearly contrasted in intensity based images which is other input neurons of the ANN approach using coherence map. Figure 7a shows the CPD image, which is generated from the HH and VV polarizations image, so that the oil-free surface is generally close to zero, and it is noisy in the land, ship and oil spill areas. Figure 7b shows that the phase texture image obtained by applying Equation (4) to the CPD image. This map has a high correlation with the oil spill and a low value in the look-alike region having the weak-damping effect. In look-alike region, this map contained no bright pixels. Therefore, if using the phase texture image which have been removed ship, it is possible that oil spill is accurately detected without false detection caused by look-alike and ship. As in the case of removing the ship from the coherence image, the median filter was applied to the image and the signal by the ship was reduced (Figure 7c ). so that the oil-free surface is generally close to zero, and it is noisy in the land, ship and oil spill areas. Figure 7b shows that the phase texture image obtained by applying Equation (4) to the CPD image. This map has a high correlation with the oil spill and a low value in the look-alike region having the weak-damping effect. In look-alike region, this map contained no bright pixels. Therefore, if using the phase texture image which have been removed ship, it is possible that oil spill is accurately detected without false detection caused by look-alike and ship. As in the case of removing the ship from the coherence image, the median filter was applied to the image and the signal by the ship was reduced (Figure 7c ). Figure 8 shows the four input neurons of the ANN. The oil spill and oil-free surfaces are clearly distinguished from each other in the four images. In particular, thick oil is more distinguishable in Figure 8c ,d generated from the phase information compared to other images. In addition, in the lookalike region with red box, its value is similar to the surrounding ocean value unlike Figure 8a ,b, because it is well-known that the PDF of the look-alikes are very close to that of oil-free surfaces in the coherence and phase texture maps [32] . However, the thin oil areas could be more easily recognized from the images generated by intensity information, and the strong contrast between oil spill and ship was found in Figure 8c ,d. Figure 8 shows the four input neurons of the ANN. The oil spill and oil-free surfaces are clearly distinguished from each other in the four images. In particular, thick oil is more distinguishable in Figure 8c ,d generated from the phase information compared to other images. In addition, in the look-alike region with red box, its value is similar to the surrounding ocean value unlike Figure 8a ,b, because it is well-known that the PDF of the look-alikes are very close to that of oil-free surfaces in the coherence and phase texture maps [32] . However, the thin oil areas could be more easily recognized from the images generated by intensity information, and the strong contrast between oil spill and ship was found in Figure 8c ,d. Using the four neurons, oil spill probability maps were generated. When generating the probability maps, 50% of the oil spill area (as classified by visual inspection) was used to train and validate the neural network model. Figure 9a ,b shows oil spill probability maps estimated by Process 1 and Process 2, respectively. The results of Process 1 and Process 2 show no significant difference when compared it visually. Both results seem to have properly detected the oil spill area. The Figure 9c ,d shows the histogram of each probability to compare the distribution of the values. In Process 1, a peak is observed around a probability of 0.1, which is formed by pixels corresponding to the oil-free surface. The frequency of other probabilities except the probability due to the oil-free surface is not much different. In other words, it is difficult to determine the threshold value for distinguishing between oil spill and oil-free because the peak due to oil spill is not observed clearly. On the other hand, in Figure 8d , peaks are observed at a probability of about 0.1 and one peak is additionally observed at around 0.9, which is a pixel representing oil spilled on the ocean. It can be seen that it is easier to determine the threshold between the two covers in probability because the two distributions have distinct peaks. That is, when all four input neurons are used, it means that the oil spill area can be detected more accurately. A (look-alike region), B (oil spill region) and C (oil-free surface region) sites were selected to compare the probabilities of the two results according to cover type. Figure 10a -c shows the look-alike region of intensity, and the results of Process 1 and Process 2, respectively. Using our new procedure, the probability of the look-alike was clearly lowered (Figure 10c ). For the probability map calculated using only the intensity layers, the highest probability value of a look-alike was ~0.65 (Figure 10b ). For the probability map calculated using all layers, the highest probability value of a look-alike was less than ~0.36 (Figure 5c ). This reflects the ability of the phase texture map to distinguish biogenic film and oil spills. Based on these results, we confirmed that using dual-polarized HH and VV phase information together is more effective for detecting oil spills than using only intensity images. Using the four neurons, oil spill probability maps were generated. When generating the probability maps, 50% of the oil spill area (as classified by visual inspection) was used to train and validate the neural network model. Figure 9a ,b shows oil spill probability maps estimated by Process 1 and Process 2, respectively. The results of Process 1 and Process 2 show no significant difference when compared it visually.

In Process 1, a peak is observed around a probability of 0.1, which is formed by pixels corresponding to the oil-free surface.

That is, when all four input neurons are used, it means that the oil spill area can be detected more accurately. A (look-alike region), B (oil spill region) and C (oil-free surface region) sites were selected to compare the probabilities of the two results according to cover type. Figure 11b is the histogram of site B. The histograms represented by green color in both graphs are based on Process 1, and the histograms in red color are based on Process 2. In the histogram of Process 1, the probability of an oil-free area being oil spill was relatively higher than in the probability map using phase information together with intensity information. Whereas oil-covered pixel is represented slightly low. As a result of numerical analysis, in process 2 using phase information, mean and standard deviation of oil-free region decreased by 0.02 and 0.01, respectively. In oil region, mean value decreased by 0.04 and standard deviation of 0.03. This difference is due to the coherence and phase texture maps. Both images showed a distinct contrast value between oil spill and oil-free ocean surface pixels. Coherence values were closer to 1 in ocean areas, but considerably smaller in the oil region. In contrast, for the phase texture map high pixel values were seen in the oil spill area, whereas low values were seen for ocean surface areas. So, the probability map produced using the proposed method allow for the clear discrimination.",

Both images showed a distinct contrast value between oil spill and oil-free ocean surface pixels. Coherence values were closer to 1 in ocean areas, but considerably smaller in the oil region. In contrast, for the phase texture map high pixel values were seen in the oil spill area, whereas low values were seen for ocean surface areas. So, the probability map produced using the proposed method allow for the clear discrimination. oil spill pixels judged to be oil-free pixels, whereas sensitivity relates to oil spill pixels classified as oil-covered pixels. The area under the curve (AUC) is the calculated value of the bottom area of the ROC curve. AUC values range from 0.5 to 1, and those closer to 1 (100%) represent more meaningful models. Values less than 0.5 are considered to be worthless [40] . According to [41] , AUC is divided into five levels: excellent (0.9-1.0), good (0.8-0.9), fair (0.7-0.8), poor (0.6-0.7), and fail (0.5-0.6). In this study, 50% of the oil spill samples was used for the training data and the accuracy of the results was verified using the remaining 50%. Verification of the two results showed 95.03% and 95.19% high accuracy, respectively, as shown in Figure 12 . This reflects the fact that both results detected almost all of the oil spill areas and the numbers of biogenic film pixels were relatively low in comparison.",

In this study, specificity relates to non-oil spill pixels judged to be oil-free pixels, whereas sensitivity relates to oil spill pixels classified as oil-covered pixels. The area under the curve (AUC) is the calculated value of the bottom area of the ROC curve. AUC values range from 0.5 to 1, and those closer to 1 (100%) represent more meaningful models. Values less than 0.5 are considered to be worthless [40] . According to [41] , AUC is divided into five levels: excellent (0.9-1.0), good (0.8-0.9), fair (0.7-0.8), poor (0.6-0.7), and fail (0.5-0.6). In this study, 50% of the oil spill samples was used for the training data and the accuracy of the results was verified using the remaining 50%. Verification of the two results showed 95.03% and 95.19% high accuracy, respectively, as shown in Figure 12 . This reflects the fact that both results detected almost all of the oil spill areas and the numbers of biogenic film pixels were relatively low in comparison. The results confirm that using the proposed algorithm, the ocean surface is less likely to be classified as oil and the removal effect of biogenic film is improved. However, the results would not be enough to present the robustness of the proposed method.

Some look-alikes can be identified using ancillary data such as currents and winds, but some look-alikes are still difficult to distinguish from oil spills, affecting the accuracy of detection. To solve this problem, research has been carried out to consider morphological features using object-based ANN. However, as mentioned earlier, the accuracy of the method is significantly reduced except when the oil spill has a distinctive strip shape and in the case of large oil spill accidents, it is difficult to divide the dark spot on an object-by-object.",

So, we used intensity image and phase information to detect the oil spill in pixel unit with high accuracy. In addition, in order to generate for accurate probability map, we also designed a preprocessing step to create an input layer optimized for oil spill detection; by eliminating false-detective and un-detective factor in each layer and by enhancing the contrast between the background pixel and the target pixel. In this study, an oil spill probability map was constructed by applying ANN with input neurons, including an NL-means filtered intensity map, a normalized texture map of intensity, and a coherence and phase texture map. The proposed algorithm shows improved results and its accuracy of about 95.19% is validated by using an ROC curve. The results of comparing the two probability maps according to the presence or absence of phase information, it can be seen that the probability of oil spill detection is increased when the phase information is used. Although it is slight, the probability of the oil-free surface being classified as an oil spill is entirely reduced. That is, the phase information enhances the accuracy of the classification by strengthening the contrast between the pixel in which the oil exists and the pixel that does not exist. It is also confirmed that by using the phase information together, it reduces the probability of about 0.3 in the look-alike with weak damping effect.",

In addition, by reducing the factors that cause false detection in pixel units, the detection was successful even when the morphological characteristics of the oil were not clearly revealed, such as the case of the large oil spill accident. Thus, it is expected that the accuracy of oil spill detection can be dramatically increased with additional data, which could remove look-alike regions such as low-wind zone and rainy cell.",

In addition, the current algorithm uses a median filter to remove the ship but it causes loss the detail of the image, so it will be more effective to detect the ship using the ship detection algorithm and lower the probability of the corresponding pixel in the modified algorithm. It is also necessary to further study what reduces the noise level of the texture map of the intensity image effectively. ",

The storm resulted in four vessel accidents, including the oil tanker Volganeft-139, which became stranded and within four days had spilled 2000 tons of oil into the sea. The oil impacted on both the Taman and Crimean peninsulas depending on wind and ocean currents",
