            "text": "Populations of Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) undergo a surprisingly large amount of genetic drift in infected patients despite very large population sizes, which are predicted to be mostly deterministic. Several models have been proposed to explain this phenomenon, but all of them implicitly assume that the process of virus replication itself does not contribute to genetic drift. We developed an assay to measure the amount of genetic drift for HIV populations replicating in cell culture. The assay relies on creation of HIV populations of known size and measurements of variation in frequency of a neutral allele. Using this assay, we show that HIV undergoes approximately ten times more genetic drift than would be expected from its population size, which we defined as the number of infected cells in the culture. We showed that a large portion of the increase in genetic drift is due to non-synchronous infection of target cells. When infections are synchronized, genetic drift for the virus is only 3-fold higher than expected from its population size. Thus, the stochastic nature of biological processes involved in viral replication contributes to increased genetic drift in HIV populations. We propose that appreciation of these effects will allow better understanding of the evolutionary forces acting on HIV in infected patients.",

            "text": "Genetic drift is defined as stochastic fluctuations in frequencies of alleles in a population. Generally, large populations are less stochastic and undergo less genetic drift than smaller populations. While viruses exhibit very large population sizes, suggesting that the genetic processes in these populations are mostly deterministic, it has been recently appreciated that genetic drift is an important factor in virus evolution. For example, plant viruses undergo severe bottleneck events both when spreading from one plant to another and within an individual infected plant, which leads to frequent founder effects in their populations [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] . Significant contribution of genetic drift has also been proposed for evolution of animal and human viruses, such as norovirus [7] , measles [8] , hepatitis B virus [9] , coronavirus [10] , Dengue virus [11] , rabies virus [12] , and hantavirus [13] . However, accurate determination of the role of genetic drift in evolution of animal viruses is complicated, because genetic drift, a stochastic process, is hard to discern from antigenic drift, which is a selection-driven process associated with individual differences in immune responses of infected hosts. Nevertheless, studies aimed at separating the role of the immune response still find a significant influence of genetic drift in evolution of some animal viruses [14, 15, 16] .",

The majority of the work on genetic drift in animal viruses has focused on large scale viral populations, comparing viruses either in geographically isolated regions or in consecutive epidemics and, therefore, does not distinguish between the intra-and inter-host genetic drift.",

Multiple studies observed that genetic drift of HIV-1 within an infected individual is several orders of magnitude larger than would be predicted from the total number of infected cells in the body [17, 18, 19, 20, 21] . Several models have been proposed to explain the observed high genetic drift, including multiple selective sweeps [22] , metapopulation structure [23, 24] and rare but severe population bottlenecks [25] . All of these models, however, implicitly assume that viral population replicating under homogenous well-mixed conditions should behave as an ideal population. Ideal populations are expected to undergo a certain amount of genetic drift, but real viral populations are also influenced by to the stochastic nature of the biological processes involved in viral replication. Therefore, real viral populations can be expected to have an excess of genetic drift, even under ''close-to-ideal'' conditions. The degree to which viral replication process contributes to genetic drift in viral populations is the main interest of our study.",

Both variants carry a frameshift insertion in the vpr gene, resulting in non-functional Vpr protein, which is not necessary for viral replication in cell culture. The insertions in the two variants differ in length by 4 bp, which allows accurate measurement of the frequency of each variant in viral mixtures by the PCR-based GeneScan assay (see Materials and Methods). Neither Vpr-FS nor Vpr-FS-StuI has an advantage for replication in culture, i.e. the variants are selectively neutral (data not shown).

At that point, the cell-free virus from virus-positive wells was collected and analyzed by the GeneScan assay to determine the frequency of the two alleles in each of the replicate cultures. The observed Vpr-FS and Vpr-FS-StuI frequencies in each set of replicates were used to calculate the average variance of the observed frequency from the expected 50%. We used this variance as a measure of genetic drift. In parallel, the size of viral population at the beginning of each experiment was calculated by measuring tissue culture infectious dose 50% (TCID50), which the amount of virus that infects 50% of the wells at a given dilution (see figure legend to Figure 1B ).

When the amount of virus used for infection was decreased, Vpr-FS-StuI frequency showed wider variation. Because the same 1:1 viral mixture was used for all dilutions, the variation in the frequencies of the two neutral variants must have been caused by genetic drift.

We measured the amount of genetic drift in HIV populations, replicating in the controlled environment of cell culture. We found that HIV populations exhibit approximately 10fold more genetic drift than would be expected for an ideal population of similar size. Non-synchronous timing of infection is partially responsible for the increase, but other unidentified factors also contribute. While the increase in genetic drift observed for HIV in culture is not sufficient to explain the several orders of magnitude increase in intrapatient genetic drift, it provides strong experimental evidence for the intrinsic stochasticity of the HIV replication cycle.

Thus, we measured Vpr-FS-StuI variance in cultures where the virus mixture was bound to the Raji-DC-SIGN cells prior to the addition of target C8166 cells. In order to do this, we used Raji-DC-SIGN cells, which cannot be infected by wild type HIV, but can bind the virus through the DC-SIGN molecule on their surface and enhance its infectivity by presenting the virus to the surfaces of uninfected cells [26, 27] . Raji-DC-SIGN cells were incubated with virus for 1 h and then washed three times with media to remove all unbound virus. The cells were then mixed with the target C8166 cells to mediate infection in trans. V total under these conditions was only 4.5 fold higher than V ideal ( Figure 4A ), a statistically significant reduction from the 10.5 ratio of V total to V ideal observed in direct C8166 infections (Table 1) . In order to test whether genetic drift was affected by pre-bound state of the virus or the simple presence of Raji-DC-SIGN cells in culture, we mixed C8166 cells with Raji-DC-SIGN cells prior to addition of the virus ( Figure 4B ). Because the simple presence of Raji-DC-SIGN in culture did not affect genetic drift of HIV, as evidenced by 9.5-fold increase of V total over V ideal ( Figure 4B and Table 1 ), this result suggested that the reduction of genetic drift was connected to the state of the virus in the beginning of infection.

The infection was synchronized by washing off non-bound virus after one hour of incubation with C8166 target cells as described above to avoid the increase in genetic drift that happens due to non-synchronous infection. The continuing rounds of viral replication were blocked by addition of antiviral drug nevirapine to the final concentration of 5 uM at 18 hr post-infection. At 72 h post-infection, cell-free virus was collected for the GeneScan analysis and nevirapine-free media was added to cells to allow viral replication and TCID50 measurement. Genetic drift under these conditions was similar to genetic drift in synchronized cultures after multiple rounds of viral replication ( Figure 4D and Table 1 ).

As a result, in non-synchronized infections there exists an ''early'' virus population, which has a temporal advantage over the ''late'' viral population. ''Early'' population produces new virions faster and contributes to the next generation of infected cells more than the ''late'' population. Therefore, the small size of the ''early'' population defines to a large degree the amount of genetic drift observed in the total population. The potential influence of such Variance is significantly greater than the variance of the standard C8166 condition. 3 Variance is significantly less than the variance of the standard C8166 condition. 4 Adjusted for differences in population sizes. CI is 95% confidence intervals. doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1000431.t001",

            "text": "non-discrete generations on genetic drift is a well-described phenomenon in population genetics (for review see [28] ). Indeed, we found that genetic drift can be significantly reduced when infections are synchronized. Synchronization removes the ''late'' viral population and, therefore, the total size of viral population becomes much closer to the size of the ''early'' population. This results in a more synchronous production of virus particles in the second generation (the major contributor to genetic drift), which becomes discrete reducing the observed genetic drift. Yet even in synchronized infections, genetic drift is higher in HIV populations than in an ideal population. We believe that the reasons for that lie in differences in metabolic state of target cells, their lifespan, or expression levels of positive and negative factors involved in viral replication. These and other individual differences between target cells can introduce stochastic events into the viral life cycle. For example, it has recently been proposed that positive feedback loops in transactivation of RNA synthesis by viral protein Tat lead to stochastic differences in levels of viral gene expression [29] . As a result, the viral population is randomly divided into actively replicating and latent subpopulations. In general, these and other factors may lead to a non-Poisson distribution in the number of progeny per parent and affect the amount of genetic drift in the population [30] . Interestingly, our data showed that genetic drift in a heterogeneous mixture of C8166 and CEMx174 cells was similar to genetic drift in a more homogeneous C8166 culture, which appears to contradict this prediction. However, it is possible that the differences between target cells in those experiments were not sufficient to result in an observable effect. Additional experiments are needed to establish the relevant biological differences of different target cells and the effect of those differences on genetic drift in viral populations.",

            "text": "All current models of HIV genetic drift implicitly assume that the process of viral replication itself is stochastic only to the degree of an ideal population of a given size [21, 22, 23, 25] . Our results show that this is not the case. Populations of HIV in cell culture undergo approximately tenfold more genetic drift than would be expected from their population sizes. This increase is not sufficient to explain the several orders of magnitude excess in genetic drift of HIV observed in patients [17, 19, 20, 21] , but it provides experimental evidence for one source of genetic variation in HIV populations. Indeed, the factors that we proposed to explain the increased genetic drift of HIV in culture should play similar, or even larger, roles in HIV populations in patients. There, infections should be less synchronized than in culture and the individual differences between target cells should be larger than in cell lines or highly stimulated PBMCs that we used in our experiments. Our data suggest that the existing models which explain this excess of genetic drift through multiple selective sweeps [22] , metapopula- tion structure [23, 24] or rare severe population bottlenecks [25] may overestimate the influence of those factors on HIV population genetics. We believe our findings will allow creation of better models describing forces acting on HIV population genetics in an infected person. Genetic drift is a powerful evolutionary force and understanding the factors contributing to it is crucial for our understanding of HIV evolution.",

Fragments of genomes containing insertions are amplified in RT-PCR reactions using fluorescently labeled primers. Relative abundance of products of different length can be quantitated from fluorescence intensity of the corresponding bands in GeneScan assay. B. Scheme of the experimental approach used to correlate the number of infected cells to the amount of genetic drift. Viral variants Vpr-FS and Vpr-FS-StuI are mixed in 1:1 ratio. The mixture is serially diluted and used to infect multiple replicates of cell cultures (shown 6 replicates for each dilution). Cultures are scored as positive (black circles) or negative (white circles) for HIV infection. Cell-free virus is collected from virus-positive wells and the frequency of virions of each variant is measured by the GeneScan assay. The data is used to calculate the amount of genetic drift for each dilution. Dilutions containing positive and negative wells are used to calculate TCID50, which provides the measure of viral population size at the start of the experiment. doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1000431.g001",

Infections were synchronized. Virus mixture was incubated with target cells for 1 hour, after which the cells were washed to remove unbound virus and resuspended in fresh media. D. Infection was synchronized as in panel C. After 15 hours viral replication was blocked by addition of nevirapine.
