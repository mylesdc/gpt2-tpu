The aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of A. pleuropneumoniae and M. hyopneumoniae, as well as that of the secondary invaders Pasteurella multocida and Streptococcus suis by serology in four pig herds (A-D) using age segregated rearing systems with high incidences of pleuritic lesions at slaughter.",

Pigs seroconverted to both agents during the early phase of the fattening period. In herd C, pigs seroconverted to P. multocida during the early phase of the fattening period and thereafter to A. pleuropneumoniae. In herd D, the levels of antibodies to P. multocida exceeded A 450 > 1.0 in absence (A 450 < 0.5) of antibodies to A. pleuropneumoniae. The levels of serum antibodies to M. hyopneumoniae and to S. suis remained below A 450 < 1.0 in all four herds.

As the number of transmission events between pigs in a population is equal to the number of pigs multiplied with the number of pigs minus one [x = n * (n \u2212 1)], they will escalate as the herd size increase [7] . Thus, the number of transmission events between pigs will increase with a factor of around four if a population is doubled and with a factor of around 100 if a population is enlarged ten times.",

M. hyopneumoniae and A. pleuropneumoniae are important pathogenic microbes, but co-infections may intensify or prolong clinical signs of respiratory disease [8] [9] [10] [11] . It has also been observed that the incidence of respiratory illness may vary with season [12] . Therefore, infections in the respiratory tract of grower pigs have become regarded as a syndrome rather than linked to single microorganisms [11, 13, 14] . This syndrome is referred to as the porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC). As stated above PRDC is regarded to be dominated by bacterial species, and important primarily pathogenic bacterial species include M. hyopneumoniae [1] [2] [3] and A. pleuropneumoniae [4] [5] [6] . The frequent demonstration of interferon-\u03b1 in serum in growers during the first week after arrival to fattening herds [15, 16] suggest that PRDC can be associated with viral infections, and that PRDC can also include the influence of secondary invaders such as Pasteurella spp [17, 18] .",

            "text": "When Sweden in 1986 as the first country in the world banned the use of low dose antibiotics in animal feed for growth promotion, some introductory health disturbances were recorded. As a consequence, a strict age segregated rearing from birth to slaughter was implemented in a large scale, which improved health as well as productivity [19, 20] . As seen in Fig. 1 , the incidence of recorded pathogenic lesions in the respiratory tract at slaughter decreased during the last decade of the twentieth century [21] . The registrations of pneumonia at slaughter has remained stable at that level since then. In contrast, the incidence of recorded pleuritis at slaughter has continuously increased since the year 2000, as has the clinical evidence of actinobacillosis [22] . Discussions concerning the reason for this increase has included suggestions of introduction of new strains, or mutation of existing strains of A. pleuropneumoniae. However, acute actinobacillosis has in Sweden historically been dominated by serotype 2, and is still dominated by that serotype [22] . Further, Pulse Field Gel Electrophoreses has revealed that strains isolated in the twenty-first century were identical to strains isolated in the 1970s and 1980s [23] . As a consequence, the increase of actinobacillosis and pleuritic recordings at slaughter has merely been linked to the continuously increasing herd sizes with increasing number of transmissions of microbes between pigs, within and between units [22] .",

It could of course, be argued that pulmonary lesions due to M. hyopneumoniae heal with time [28, 29] , and therefore, infections gained during the early rearing period could escape detection at slaughter. However, the low levels (A 450 < 1.0 in all herds) of antibodies to M. hyopneumoniae recorded show that the registrations of pneumonia were correct. Still, the slight increase of serum antibodies to M. hyopneumoniae at the end of the rearing period in herds B, C and D indicate the presence of M. hyopneumoniae in these herds, and that should not be neglected. The global market weight of pigs varies from around 80-180 kg, and is at present around 120 kg in Sweden, which is reached at an age of 6-7 months. If the market weight increase also the rearing period will be prolonged with more days at risk for each pig, which may pave the way for clinical signs of M. hyopneumoniae. Although the pathogen load differs between Sweden and Italy, it is notable that M. hyopneumoniae-like lesions were recorded in 2268 out of 4889 pigs (45.4 %) slaughtered at an age of 9-10 months in Italy [30] .",

This suggested a strong influence from P. multocida as also has been suggested earlier [17, 18, 31] . Also the levels of antibodies to M. hyopneumoniae and S. suis increased to some extent during the end of the rearing period However, as the antibody levels to these microbes remained at low levels (A 450 < 1.0) their influence on the lung score were considered to be less significant.

Still, the increasing levels of antibodies to A. pleuropneumoniae serotype 2 at the end of the rearing period suggested an influence of A. pleuropneumoniae also in this herd, and it is notable that the levels of antibodies to M. hyopneumoniae increased slightly during the end of the rearing period. As P. multocida is regarded to be a secondary invader, something else than A. pleuropneumoniae or M. hyopneumoniae ought to have paved the way for that microbe. Although this remain undiagnosed in the present study, the frequent demonstrations of interferon-\u03b1 in serum of fattening pigs during the first week after allocation [15, 16] indicate that viral infections may be precursors to P. multocida and the frequent findings of different virus in pigs using novel techniques [32] support that hypothesis. The early infections with P. multocida may by themselves not necessarily have induced pleuritic lesions, but obviously the infection with P. multocida already was established as the pigs became infected with A. pleuropneumoniae and colonies of P. multocida already on site may have amplified the effect of the subsequent A. pleuropneumoniae infection.",

The mean concentration of antibodies to A. pleuropneumoniae serotype 2 and 3 remained below the cut offvalue during the entire rearing period. Instead, pigs were seropositive to P. multocida already on arrival to the fattening unit and the level of serum antibodies to P. multocida increased throughout the rearing period in absence of antibodies to the other microbes. This clearly indicated that pleuritic lesions may evolve at high frequencies also in absence of A. pleuropneumoniae, as also has been suggested by others [33] . Likewise, no correlation between A. pleuropneumoniae and pleuritis at individual level was seen in herds with low incidences of pleuritic lesions recorded at slaughter [34] . Instead seroconversion to M. hyopneumoniae during the early fattening period was related to pleuritis at an individual level in such herds, which indicated an influence of secondary infections [34] . Therefore, the common presence of serum antibodies to P. multocida is of interest. However, in the present study, P. multocida was associated with a high prevalence of pleuritic lesions recorded at slaughter in absence of M. hyopneumoniae. Thereby, the true initial cause for these lesions still remains unknown and warrants further investigations. Since viral infections repeatedly has been demonstrated during the early fattening period [15, 16] viral infections may well have preceded the serological response to P. multocida.",
