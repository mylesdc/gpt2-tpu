During 2005-2015, we estimated a total of 10 313 DALYs were lost due to leptospirosis comprising a total of 1804 years-lived with disability (YLDs) and 8509 years-life lost (YLLs). Males had the highest burden of disease (7149 DALYs) compared to females (3164 DALYs). The highest burden estimate was attributed to younger individuals aged 10-19 years who lived in southern provinces of China. During 2005-2015, this age group contributed to approximately 3078 DALYs corresponding to 30% of the total DALYs lost in China. Yet, our analysis indicated a declining trend in burden estimates (P < 0.001) since 2005 and remained relatively low during 2011-2015. Low burden estimates have been identified in the endemic regions where infections principally distributed. Most of the changes in DALY estimates were driven by changes in YLLs.",

In addition, while in the last five years the incidence has been reported at very low-level, this might not reflect the true incidence of leptospirosis. Strengthened surveillance in the endemic regions is, hence, substantially required to capture the actual prevalence to better control leptospirosis in China.",

Leptospirosis remains a significant public health problem in the country where a broad range of potential reservoirs and serovars are still circulating in the country. Furthermore, rapid population growth, poverty, and industrialization have led to excessive urbanization and environmental changes such as deforestation and urban expansion [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] , which might influence disease nidality through direct impacts on the natural habitat of reservoirs and affects the spillover of infection between wildlife animals, domestic animals, and humans. Also, extreme weather events such as flooding following typhoons may significantly impact impoverish communities with lack of access to safe water and sanitation and health services [6] , leading to an increased risk of Leptospira exposures.",

We estimated the DALYs for each year by adding the number of Years of Life Lost due to death in the population (YLLs) and the number of Years Lived with Disability (YLDs) due to the disease [19] . The estimate of YLLs was obtained by multiplying number of cases per year and the standard life expectancy at the age of death in years. To estimate life expectancy at the age of death, we used a standard life table used for the estimation of Global Burden of Disease 2010 [20] . YLDs were calculated by multiplying incidence, disability weight (DW), and duration of the illness. The disability weight used for the estimation of YLDs was the same that used in a study elsewhere [3] . In brief, all death cases were defined as fatal cases. Thus, we were given a DW of 0.573 for one month as it was assumed that they had dialysis before death. For non-fatal cases, we assumed that there were 70% acute cases and 30% had chronic sequelae. Of those acute cases, 50% is mild (given a DW 0.053 for 2 months), 40% is moderate (DW 0.21-2 months), and 10% severe (DW 0.562 for 2 weeks, 0.51 for 2 weeks, and 0.21 for 1 month). Of those chronic cases, a DW of 0.245 for two months to three years was given. In our DALYs calculation, we did not consider age-weighting and discounting.",

We observed a remarkable decline in reported incidence and mortality in all provinces especially in region A and B where leptospirosis is principally most prevalent, such as Sichuan and Yunnan. These findings are in line with previous county-level studies which also reported a reduction in notified incidence while local outbreaks still frequently reported in some areas [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . Our analysis indicates that following a steep downward trend during 2005-2010, the reported incidence of leptospirosis in China remained quite low during the last five years. This finding suggests that China might have reached a low-level leptospirosis transmission similar to other developed countries [27] although this might not indicate a real epidemiological situation as evidenced by the existence of persistent geographical foci of infection that can potentially lead to future outbreaks in the country. Also, we observed marked variation in fatality-rates across regions over time, which may be explained by the heterogeneity the level of awareness and knowledge among populations towards leptospirosis, inadequate measures for early diagnosis and treatment especially during outbreaks, delay in seeking treatment, and severity of illness due to variation to Leptospira exposure and localized risk factors. Hence, more targeted control efforts are needed especially in those high-risk areas and economically less developed areas by enhancing awareness, improving access to safe water and sanitation facilities, and strengthening healthcare and local surveillance systems.",

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that attempted to quantify the spatiotemporal heterogeneity in the burden of leptospirosis using time-series historical notification data, especially in China. From 2005 to 2015, it was estimated that more than 10 000 DALYs lost due to infections where the burden predominantly contributed by high YLLs. However, our estimates are in stark contrast with those reported by a study elsewhere [3] . Our smaller DALYs estimates may reflect the sharp reduction in both reported incidence and mortality that occurred during 2005 to 2015.",

[3] was mainly generated based on the morbidity and mortality estimates developed by another study elsewhere [2] that involved modelling on the morbidity and mortality data by incorporating several variables, adjustments, and uncertainties. Their study was a global study and applied a global model to each country. It is important to consider previous studies. We also identified variation in the surveillance system capacity, as evidenced by the difference in laboratory-confirmed cases among provinces, which means that adjustments should be cautiously applied for the whole country. Applying adjustments to the whole country could be over/underestimated the actual incidence and mortality rates. Changes in incidence and burden can be partly associated with improvement in prevention and control measures including health promotion activities, sanitation, and the application of leptospirosis vaccination programme [10, 16, 26, 28, 29] . In terms of the surveillance system, the development of NIDRIS and CIDARS following outbreaks of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 have helped efficiently improve the timeliness, completeness, and coverage of the data across China as well as facilitates early detection of diseases outbreaks [16] . However, it has been confirmed that during 2005-2015, there has been no significant change in the surveillance systems, specifically for leptospirosis. While, in terms of the vaccination programme, human leptospirosis vaccine has been developed since 1958 and until now it has been administered to high-risk populations in China during the epidemic seasons. A multivalent inactivated vaccine is currently the only available in China [29] . Changes in ecological and social conditions that have been underway in China in the past 20 years may also have played an essential role in leptospirosis epidemiology. Changes in the landscape, agricultural practices and livestock husbandry, for instance, restriction on livestock herding, farming commercialization, and pigs or livestock vaccination [10, 30] that happened in China could have impacted the transmission rate of leptospirosis in China. Industrialization, for example, has led to significant epidemiological shifts in rural areas through the introduction of agricultural technology and mechanization which might reduce the rate of human exposure to the Leptospira-contaminated environment. Also, we had noticed that there were significant anthropogenic ecological changes following the development of the Three Gorges Dam and the nationwide reforestation programme called \"Grain for Green\", which probably had an effect of leptospirosis transmission. Water impoundment in many endemic areas has been known to have an impact on rodents' habitat and population dynamics of the pathogen in those regions [31, 32] . These projects have also been reported to have had a substantial impact on another rodent-and water-borne diseases, such as hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome and schistosomiasis [33] [34] [35] . However, the role of environmental changes on space-time variation on leptospirosis incidence and burden still needs to be explored. Also, a substantial change in the quality of livestock husbandry in China (e.g., improved waste management and farm biosecurity) might also have contributed to a decrease in transmission rate in livestock [10] . A review of significant changes in the epidemiology of infectious diseases in China, including leptospirosis, has also been described elsewhere [14, 36] .",

            "text": "Our results demonstrate that the highest DALY was attributed to younger individuals aged 10-19 years due to higher mortality (YLLs) observed in this group. Interestingly, higher DALYs estimates were identified in economically less-developed provinces in China including Guangxi in Region A and Guizhou and Sichuan in Region B. Guangxi and Guizhou are known to have low Gross Regional Product among provinces in China [18] . High burden estimates in school-aged children may probably be associated with lack of parental supervision because of parental migration from rural to the cities that happened during the last three decades. Lack of parental supervision on preventing their children from unhealthy behaviors and environment may likely increase the risk of pathogenic exposure and children's health [37] . Additionally, rural migration has shifted labor allocation and participation in families in farming activities, where children, women, and elderly become more active in farming [38, 39] and, therefore, they are more likely to be exposed to Leptospira-contaminated environments. It has been indicated in our findings that 5% of the total cases among farmers were attributed to young farmers (aged under 20 years). Health education and awareness amongst this population group, especially in rural communities is, therefore essential to further reduce the risk in this demographic group. These findings highlight the importance of improving current local surveillance for leptospirosis and health care services for the high-risk populations living in the high-risk areas identified in our study. We also found that disease transmission might have emerged in some counties located in temperate regions to the north of the country although at the very low rate. This may partly be due to change in environmental conditions (i.e., climate variation and changes in land use/land cover) or the translocation of potential reservoirs from adjoining endemic regions. Climate variation notably the increase in temperatures may have driven the spread of Leptospira towards temperate regions in China through its impact on rodent population growth in these areas [40] . Several outbreaks in China have been thought to be associated with high rainfall intensity [26] . However, we suggest that further investigation should be performed to determine whether the emerging incidence may correlate with changes in climate and other environmental and social conditions (e.g., human migration).",

Also, since leptospirosis often presenting a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations, more untreated cases or false-negative cases might occur and lead to a high number of underreported and misdiagnosed cases, especially in resourcelimited endemic areas. The recent finding indicated the presence of leptospiral infection among patients with undifferentiated fever in Hainan province [41] , suggesting that the incidence and burden may be underestimated. Thus, enhanced-surveillance prospective populationbased studies may help to determine existing leptospirosis cases in China better.",

In addition, while in the last five years the incidence has been reported at very low-level, this might not reflect the actual incidence of leptospirosis. Active surveillance studies on acute febrile illnesses are urgently required. Finally, these findings may help to design targeted intervention strategies in China to reduce the burden of human leptospirosis. An evaluation of the role of environment and socioeconomic on the changing leptospirosis epidemiology and burden should be considered in the future works.",
