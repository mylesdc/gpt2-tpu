This program generated 47 transcriptomic and proteomic datasets from 30 studies that investigate in vivo and in vitro host responses to viral infections. Human pathogens in the Orthomyxoviridae and Coronaviridae families, especially pandemic H1N1 and avian H5N1 influenza A viruses and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), were investigated. Study validation was demonstrated via experimental quality control measures and meta-analysis of independent experiments performed under similar conditions. Primary assay results are archived at the GEO and PeptideAtlas public repositories, while processed statistical results together with standardized metadata are publically available at the Influenza Research Database (www.fludb.org) and the Virus Pathogen Resource (www.viprbrc.org). By comparing data from mutant versus wild-type virus and host strains, RNA versus protein differential expression, and infection with genetically similar strains, these data can be used to further investigate genetic and physiological determinants of host responses to viral infection.",

            "text": "With the recognition that host responses to pathogen infection play key roles in disease severity and mortality, virologists have shifted toward integrated systems biology approaches to identify therapeutics that target host pathways 1, 2 . To support the cross-disciplinary approaches necessary to address a systemslevel analysis, the Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) established the Systems Biology for Infectious Diseases Research (SysBio) program that provided support for four centers from 2008-2013: Systems Influenza, Systems Virology, Systems Biology of Enteropathogens, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis Systems Biology 3 . The Systems Influenza and Systems Virology centers focused on elucidating the mechanisms of how viral regulation of the host cellular circuitry contributes to viral replication and disease severity, thereby elucidating host pathways that could serve as potential new therapeutic targets. Several publications have reported the findings from these virology-focused SysBio centers. Overall characterization of the host responses demonstrated that pro-inflammatory interferon (IFN) signalling pathways were enriched following infection with either influenza A or Betacoronavirus infection in vitro 4, 5 and in vivo 6, 7 . These studies characterized several aspects of viral-host interactions that influence disease severity. Experiments designed to tease out the contribution of the virus and the host to the severity of host response reported that specific mutations in the H5N1 viral genome affected the kinetics and magnitude of the host response, rather than changes in specific host response factors 8 . Another study found that early response signatures to influenza virus infection correlated with the severity of late disease 9 . Lipidomics analysis of mice infected with various influenza A virus strains of varying pathogenicity have also been reported 10 . Similarly, the disease severity of SARS-CoV correlated with the dysregulation of the urokinase pathway and an increase in fibrinolysin pathway activity 7 . An integrated network interrogation approach using both transcriptomic and proteomic data sets predicted a subset of key regulator molecules responding to SARS-CoV and influenza infections that could be used as host targets for therapeutic intervention 11, 12 . Genetic modification of non-structural protein 16 in SARS-CoV showed enhanced susceptibility to type I and III interferon responses, making it a good vaccine strain candidate 13 .",

The working group leveraged existing public archiving strategies to store the primary assay results and devised metadata standards to represent the experiment descriptions and interpreted results in a consistent and standardized way. The final derived host response data and associated structured standardized metadata were made publically available at the BRC appropriate for the system under study.

From Orthomyxoviridae, two influenza A subtypes H5N1 and H1N1 were chosen in order to investigate influenza viruses with higher and lower reported pathogenicity, respectively. Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza H5N1 (HPAI) has been commonly referred to as 'Avian Flu' as it is endemic in bird populations. HPAI is known to exhibit 'stuttering transmission' in humans, with a relatively high mortality rates (>50%), but to-date has not acquired efficient human-to-human transmission. This high mortality rate together with its pathological similarities to the 1918 H1N1 'Spanish Flu' make it an important model to study and prevent future lethal pandemics. On the other hand, the more recent seasonal and pandemic H1N1 strains are considered to have lower pathogenicity, rarely causing severe disease or death. Since its emergence, pandemic H1N1 has been found to recur in the human population as a seasonal influenza. H1N1 influenza isolates used in these studies include recent pandemic strains, previous seasonal strains, and a reconstructed 1918 strain.",

To generate the AMT tag database, aliquots of the virus infected or mock-infected samples were combined to make the appropriate sample pools. Each pool was subjected to strong cation exchange fractionation as described above, and each fraction was analyzed by capillary LC-MS/MS. The SEQUEST analysis software was used to match the MS/MS fragmentation spectra with sequences from the appropriate UniProt/Swiss-Prot protein database. When searching, SEQUEST used a dynamic mass modification on methionine residues corresponding to oxidation (15.9949 Da) and a static mass modification on cysteinyl residues to account for alkylation by iodoacetamide (57.0215 Da). Peptides passing the following filter criteria were stored as AMT tags in a Microsoft SQL Server database: 1) SEQUEST DelCn2 value \u2265 0.10 (normalized Xcorr difference between the top scoring peptide and the second highest scoring peptide in each MS/MS spectrum) and 2) for the mouse lung tissue database, a SEQUEST correlation score (Xcorr) \u2265 1.6, 2.4, and 3.2 for fully tryptic peptides with 1+, 2+, and 3+ charge states, respectively, and Xcorr \u2265 4.3, and 4.7 for partially tryptic or non-tryptic protein terminal peptides with 2+, and 3+ charge states, respectively. While for the human cell line database, a SEQUEST correlation score (Xcorr) \u2265 2, 2.6, and 3.5 for fully tryptic peptides with 1+, 2+, and 3+ charge states, respectively, and Xcorr \u2265 2.5, 3.6, and 4.1 for partially tryptic or non-tryptic protein terminal peptides with 1+, 2+, and 3+ charge states, respectively. These filter criteria resulted in estimated peptide false discovery rates of o2% based on target-decoy database searches for both lung and cell samples. Nontryptic peptides were excluded, and a minimum peptide length of 6 amino acid residues was required. The elution times for these peptides were normalized to a range of 0 to 1 using a predictive peptide LC normalized elution time (NET) model and linear regression. A NET average and standard deviation are assigned to each identified peptide if the same peptide is observed in multiple analyses. Both calculated monoisotopic masses and observed NETs of identified peptides were included in the AMT tag database.

Similarly, the mice that were exposed to virus in either experiment showed a dose-dependent decrease in mean % body weight. The viral growth kinetics for A/California/04/2009 in the CA04M001 study showed mean viral titers peaking at 2 dpi regardless of the viral concentration present in the initial inoculation. In contrast, the growth kinetics for A/Viet Nam/1203/2004 used in the IM001 study showed mean viral titers peaking at 2 days post infection when the initial inoculum contained either 10 3 or 10 4 plaque forming units (PFU) of virus; whereas mean viral titers were highest at 4 dpi when the initial inoculum contained 10 2 PFU of virus.",

Another measure of technical validity of the combined laboratory and analytical workflow is that the Host Factor Biosets derived from similar experiment samples treated in a similar way should have similar membership, thereby indicating experimental reproducibility. To examine experimental reproducibility, we determined the overlap that was observed between all experiments that used the same virus strains in the same infection system. In the evaluation reported here, we used datasets reporting results from wild-type A/California/04/2009 (H1N1), A/Viet Nam/1203/04 (H5N1), and SARS-CoV as being representatives of all experiments. In order to avoid complications related to slight differences in infection kinetics, we took the union of all biosets across the entire time course from each experiment (i.e. the non-redundant set of differentially expressed genes) for comparison. This approach can lead to a discrepancy between the total number of genes in each experiment due to differences in number of time points sampled. As an alternative strategy, the data could also be more strictly paired using specific time points and dosages.",

Since the magnitude of the responses and the number of time points differ between experiments, we calculated the percentage overlap of the number of host factors using the smallest set as the denominator for the sake of comparison. The smallest set was chosen as the denominator to calculate percentage overlap, which may not be an ideal comparison since this would tend to result in higher reproducibility values than if the largest set was used as the denominator. However, since we are primarily interested in measuring the commonality between similar experiments that have slight variations in study designs and are inherently noisy, we chose to focus on determining if the smaller set is largely a subset of the larger sets, which would demonstrate that the these significant hits are reproducible even in the presence of confounding variables such as biological and technical variation. For transcriptomic experiments the following overlap was observed: 83% for A/California/04/2009 in Calu-3 (Fig. 2a) , 91% for A/Viet Nam/1203/2004 in Calu-3 (Fig. 2b, 3-way comparison) , 62% for A/California/04/2009 in C57BL/6 ( Fig. 2c) , 77% for A/Viet Nam/1203/2004 in C57BL/6 ( Fig. 2d) , 72% for A/California/04/2009 in HAE cells (Fig. 2e) , and 40% for SARS-CoV in HAE cells (Fig. 2f) . For the one replicated proteomic experiment, in which A/Viet Nam/1203/2004 was used to infect Calu-3, 43% overlap was observed (Fig. 2g) . The reproducibility of host responses to both pandemic and highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses was high in both the Calu-3 cell line and mouse infection systems. Reproducibility using HAE was somewhat lower both in terms of the absolute number of host factor responding (Fig. 2e ) and the percentage overlap (only 39% in Fig. 2f) , perhaps due to the variability in establishing similar cell culture conditions using primary epithelial cells. Reproducibility of proteomic results was also somewhat lower with an overlap of 43% following infection of Calu-3 with A/Viet Nam/1203/2004 (Fig. 2g) .",

Although the pairwise comparisons of the host response to virus infection were somewhat variable, the differences appeared to correlate with the virulence of the infecting virus. No overlap was observed between all three virulent viruses and the A/Brisbane/59/2007 strain. In contrast, 262 host factors (66%) were shared in mice infected with the three virulent viruses (Fig. 3a) . Performing a functional annotation analysis for this list of 262 genes identified the same list of GO terms as reported in the original study 6 except for the exclusion of cardiovascular disease and cancer. Similar analyses designed to compare the host response to other related viruses could be performed using the datasets that are currently available in IRD/ViPR.

One of the goals behind making these datasets freely available through public database resources like GEO, ViPR and IRD is to support their incorporation into meta-analysis approaches that include new experiments being performed by the research community. To facilitate this kind of meta-analysis, considerable effort has been dedicated to providing complete descriptions of all experimental and data analysis methodologies, combined with structured, standardized metadata describing selected key aspects of the experiment design, especially regarding the experiment www.nature.com/sdata/ SCIENTIFIC DATA | 1:140033 | DOI: 10.1038/sdata.2014.33 factors that serve as the independent (manipulated) variables in the study in ViPR and IRD.

Many bioinformatics data processing workflows currently implement a 'one size fits all' approach with a single algorithm being applied to all datasets without regard for the specific nuances of each individual dataset. The problem with this approach is that the processing algorithms and parameters that are ideal for one dataset may not be optimal for other datasets-especially when dealing with different experimental systems. Hence, processing of the data using a single universally-applied algorithm may not sufficiently address the individual requirements of each dataset. To truly solve this underlying problem, an analytical workflow that explores the relevant parameter space for a diverse set of algorithms would need to be implemented. This approach would provide an objective and automated process to intelligently 'choose' the optimal combination of parameters and algorithms that produce the best set of results for each individual dataset. Such an approach could be implemented in analytical workflow suites like Galaxy or GenePattern 57,58 to objectively and confidently reprocess the raw data from each '-omics' dataset in a data-driven fashion to further improve the quality of the derived data. Until such a system is developed, we advocate for using the processed data that was provided by the original submitters and subjected to the peer-review process when performing meta-analyses given its overall high quality.",
