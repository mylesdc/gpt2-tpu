Although the strategy of antagonizing influenza infection through vaccination has been partially successful, the necessity for effective antiviral agents is underscored by the toxic side effects of currently available drugs and the emergence of drug-resistant variants (2) (3) (4) . Influenza viruses, like any other viruses, are obligate intracellular pathogens that exploit the host cellular machinery to replicate. The identification of cellular mechanisms required for the virus life cycle not only sheds light on its trafficking characteristics but also provides strategies for interfering with host factors as an alternative approach to inhibit viral infection.",

Various functional assay systems have been used for screening host factors involved in the influenza virus replication cycle thus far. From RNA interference (RNAi)-based genome-wide screening strategies in Drosophila (5) and mammalian systems (6 -9) to other approaches, including proteomics (10, 11) , yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) 3 analyses (7, 12) , and microarrays (7, (13) (14) (15) , extensive information has been acquired. Multiple cellular networks have been implicated in influenza virus replication through either direct protein-protein interactions (10, 16) or signaling pathways (17) . Although these strategies unveiled hundreds of genes important for the virus life cycle, their functional relevance and molecular mechanisms are still poorly understood. Among others approaches, effort has been invested to dissect how the cellular interactors of viral ribonucleoprotein complexes regulate the replication and transcription of influenza virus (18) . Host interactors of the non-structural protein 1 (NS1), a multifunctional protein mod-ulating several aspects of the virus replication cycle with a major role in inhibiting interferon mediated immune response, have also been extensively studied (16) . However, little attention has been drawn to identifying cellular factors associated with the viral matrix protein 2 (M2).",

M2 is a minor protein of the viral envelope that forms a homotetramer in its native state (19, 20) . Interestingly, M2 possesses the longest C-terminal tail among the three viral envelope proteins, namely hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase, and M2. It is an ion channel that was initially discovered as the target of the antiviral drug amantadine and facilitates diffusion of protons to the interior of the endosomally entrapped virus (21) . Low pH induces a conformational change in HA and subsequently triggers fusion with the endosomal membrane during virus entry (22) . M2 is a 97-residue single-pass membrane protein that displays considerable pleiotropism. It determines the filamentous morphology of some viral strains through binding to cholesterol (23) (24) (25) . The cytoplasmic tail (CT) of M2 interacts with M1 at the site of virus budding for efficient packaging of virus particles (26, 27) . Rossman et al. (28) reported a role of M2-CT in mediating cholesterol-dependent alteration in membrane curvature at the neck of budding virions, leading to host ESCRT pathway-independent membrane scission.",

Hence, the identification of cellular interactors of M2 would provide mechanistic insights into influenza pathogenesis and possibilities for development of novel strategies to interfere with multiple steps of the infection process. By using M2-CT as bait, we screened a human placenta complementary DNA (cDNA) library to identify host proteins that either facilitate or restrict viral infection. Cyclin D3, a key regulator of cell cycle G 0 /G 1 phase progression, was uncovered as a novel host factor interacting with M2-CT. The physical interaction between M2 and cyclin D3 was confirmed in virusinfected cells. Influenza A virus (IAV) infection resulted in host cell cycle arrest in G 0 /G 1 phase, which was accompanied by cyclin D3 relocalization and degradation. Using a combination of small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated genetic analyses we further showed that cyclin D3 restricts IAV production, independent of its role in the cell cycle. The restriction of cyclin D3 on IAV life cycle did not impair viral protein synthesis but interfered with M1-M2 binding, which may result in defective assembly and release of progeny virions. The role of cyclin D3 in the context of influenza infection has not been described previously. More interestingly, our results suggest a novel function of cyclin D3 that is beyond its classical function in cell cycle regulation.",

Among the three viral envelope proteins, M2 possesses the longest CT with a high probability of interactions with the cellular machinery at various steps of the virus life cycle. These include fusion, intracellular trafficking through the secretory pathway (31) , and virus assembly and budding at the plasma membrane (24, 32) . It is of considerable interest to identify intracellular interactors of M2-CT, not only to elucidate cellular components that are exploited by influenza, but also to understand host defenses involved in restricting the virus life cycle. To this end, a random-primed cDNA library from human placenta was screened by Y2H using the IAV M2-CT as bait (Fig. 1A) . The screening revealed human cyclin D3 (GenBank TM accession number NM_001760.2) as one of the most prominent interactors of M2-CT, as summarized in Table 1 . Sequence alignment of the positive clones pointed to amino acid residues 138 -251 as the minimal interacting domain for M2-CT (Fig. 1B) . The M2-binding domain on cyclin D3 is largely outside of its cyclin box, which is responsible for binding to and activation of cyclindependent kinases (33, 34) and also the region in which the greatest homology occurs among the D-type cyclins (35) . This finding, together with the absence of other cyclins among positive clones, suggests a certain degree of specificity of the interaction, which was tested in the next series of experiments.",

To achieve unbiased analysis, A549 cells were infected with influenza A/WSN/33 virus at an MOI of 0.5 to have a mixed population of infected and uninfected cells in the same sample. Cells were fixed at 24 h postinfection (p.i.) and stained for cyclin D3 and M2 proteins. In uninfected cells, cyclin D3 resides both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm with only the nuclear CDK4/6-cyclin D3 complex displaying retinoblastoma (Rb)-directed kinase activity (44) . Interestingly, upon virus infection, a much weaker cyclin D3 signal was observed in the nuclei of infected cells compared with control cells, as revealed by M2 staining. These results suggest that cyclin D3 is redistributed from the nucleus to the cytosol as a response to infection ( Fig. 2A, top panels) . The effect of M2 protein on cyclin D3 relocalization was recapitulated in analogous experiments using A549 cells expressing M2 protein alone ( Fig. 2A , bottom panels), which resulted in the apparent reduction of cyclin D3 from the nucleus, similar to the phenotype induced by viral infection.",

Cytoplasm-and nucleus-enriched extracts were prepared from A/WSN/33-infected (MOI of 2 to achieve a more homogeneous infection of the cell culture) and uninfected A549 cells. Lamin B1 and GAPDH were used as markers to verify clear separation of nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions. Total intracellular level of cyclin D3 in virus-infected cells decreased to \u03f360% of that observed in mock-infected cells (Fig. 2, B and C, top) . Densitometric analysis indicates that 10% of total cyclin D3 was found in the nucleus of uninfected cells. This is very likely an underestimation because cyclin D3, being soluble, would leak from the nuclear into the cytoplasmic fraction during the experimental procedures. The percentage of nuclear cyclin D3 dropped to \u03fd4% at 8 h p.i. (Fig. 2C, bottom) , indicating trans- Numbers, amino acid positions. C, GST pull-down assay using whole cell lysates from A549 cells. Samples were incubated with either naked beads, GST control (GST), or GST fused to the cytoplasmic tail of A/WSN/33 virus M2 protein (GST-M2-CT) and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-cyclin D3 antibodies after pull-down. Results are representative of three and two independent experiments for cyclin D3 and cyclin D1 pull-down, respectively. Dotted lines, sliced lanes from the same gel. GST protein input was revealed by Coomassie Blue staining. D, co-immunoprecipitation of M2 with cyclin D3. HEK 293T cells infected with A/WSN/33 virus at an MOI of 2 were lysed at 6 h after infection and subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) with anti-FLAG or isotype control antibodies. Cell lysates or pellets following immunoprecipitation were analyzed by immunoblotting (IB) using the indicated antibodies. Transfection and infection conditions are shown above the blots. Results are representative of three independent experiments. E, HEK 293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding Myc-tagged cyclins 48 h before infection with A/WSN/33 virus at an MOI of 2. Cells were lysed at 6 h after infection and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc or isotype control antibodies. Cell lysates or pellets following immunoprecipitation were analyzed by immunoblotting using the indicated antibodies. Transfection and infection conditions are shown above the blots. M2 was found to interact with all cyclins tested, albeit to different intensities. Results are representative of three independent experiments. Quantitation of M2 pull-down levels was performed by densitometric analysis of immunoblots. M2 level was normalized to the respective immunoprecipitated Myc-tagged protein level in each condition. The degree of association of M2 with cyclin D1 was around 50% that of cyclin D3 when the same amount of cyclins was immunoprecipitated. Weak binding of M2 to cyclin D2 and cyclin E1, which plays a role in the cell cycle clock one step later than D-type cyclins and is required for cell cycle G 1 /S transition in association with cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), was also observed in our experiments. The bar graph shows the mean \u03ee S.D. (error bars) of three independent experiments. **, p \u03fd 0.005; ***, p \u03fd 0.0001 by one-way ANOVA. 2D ). Most of cyclin D3 appeared in the cytosolic fraction under these conditions. Interaction of cyclin D3 with M2, combined with its enrichment in the cytosol upon M2 expression strongly suggests that this association must occur in the cytosol, either directly or as a complex presumably en route to assembly and release of intact progeny virions.",

Given the decrease in total intracellular cyclin D3 levels observed in virus-infected cells, we next addressed whether influenza virus modulates cyclin D3 protein levels in addition to altering its subcellular localization. The expression profiles of cyclin D3 and another cell cycle G 1 phase regulator, cyclin E, were measured through immunoblotting. Cyclin D3 was dramatically down-regulated by IAV infection to almost undetectable levels compared with uninfected cells at 24 h p.i. (Fig. 3A , top). A time course analysis revealed that the steady-state levels of cyclin D3 started declining at 6 h p.i. and decreased by \u03f350% at 9 h p.i. (Fig. 3A, bottom) . Cyclin E, which is activated at the late stage of cell cycle G 1 phase to facilitate G 1 /S transition, displayed only a moderate reduction under identical conditions (Fig. 3A) , contrary to the finding by He et al. (49) , where cyclin E was vastly down-regulated by IAV infection. However, no quantitative analysis was provided in their study, preventing us from comparing the reduction level. It is worth noting that cyclin E exists as multiple proteins ranging in size from M r 35,000 to 50,000 in tumor cell lines, as illustrated by others (see also Fig. 3A ) (50, 51) . However, only one band size of cyclin E was shown in their study, although the same cell type was used. The differential regulation of cyclin D3 and cyclin E indicates that IAV infection specifically deregulates components in the early G 1 phase (G 0 /G 1 phase) of the cell cycle machinery.",

Cells were infected with A/WSN/33 virus in the absence or presence of proteasome inhibitors, MG-101 or MG-132, and tested for cyclin D3 levels. MG-101, also known as calpain inhibitor I, inhibits both proteasome and calpain activities (52) . Calpain is a calcium-dependent protease that produces limited proteolysis of its substrates. Resulting fragments are further degraded by other proteolytic pathways, including proteasome (52) . Calpain has been reported to regulate cyclin D1 at the posttranscriptional level (53) . MG-132 is a proteasome inhibitor that prevents degradation of ubiquitin-conjugated proteins (54) . Uninfected cells were treated with the same drugs to control for the baseline oscillation of cyclin D3 levels. Proteasome inhibition did not affect cyclin D3 abundance in uninfected cells; however, blocking proteasome activity led to a significant stabilization of cyclin D3 in virus-infected cells. MG-101 and MG-132 treatments blocked cyclin D3 degradation by \u03f350 and \u03f360%, respectively, compared with the vehicle control (DMSO)treated group, as measured by densitometric analysis of immunoblots (Fig. 3B) . Thus, an obvious rescue of cyclin D3 was observed after one round of infection (9 h p.i.) through the use of proteasome inhibitors. The regulation of other cell cycle moderators was also investigated. Although viral infection also resulted in cyclin D1, CDK4, and CDK6 down-regulation on protein level (Fig. 4A) , the level of down-regulation is not as robust as that of cyclin D3, and their protein levels could not be rescued by protease and calpain inhibitor when compared with cyclin D3 (Fig. 4B ). These findings suggest that IAV posts a cyclin D3-specific effect during infection.",

The interaction between cyclin D3 and M2-CT during the viral life cycle implies a potential regulation of host cell cycle by IAV. This is supported by our observation that cyclin D3 is actively removed from the nucleus and degraded by the proteasome in virus-infected cells. To address whether the cell cycle is compromised, a quantitative profiling of cell cycle kinetics was performed on virus-infected A549 cells. Using an asynchronously growing cell population, we found that virus-infected cells accumulated at G 1 phase when compared with the uninfected group (data not shown). To reduce variability due to a mixed population of cells in differential phases of the cell cycle, we first synchronized them before infection in G 1 using lovastatin, a fungal metabolite shown to affect cell cycle distribution in a reversible manner (55) . Cells were released from the lovastatin block and stimulated with mevalonate at the time of infection to trigger progression into later cell cycle stages. BrdU incorporation and DNA content staining showed that virus infection brought about a cell cycle arrest at 9 h p.i. (Fig. 5A) . The overlay of cell cycle patterns of virus-infected and uninfected cells indicates that infection decreased the peaks representing cells in S and G 2 /M phases (Fig. 5B) . The percentages of cells in G 1 phase exhibited a progressive, time-dependent drop from 83.0 \u03ee 2.1 to 80.1 \u03ee 0.9% and subsequently 45.7 \u03ee 2.8% (at 0, 9, and 24 h p.i., respectively; means \u03ee S.D. of three experiments) in the mock-infected samples. This reduction reflects progression of cells through G 1 phase, followed by entry into the later stages of the cell cycle. In contrast, cells infected by A/WSN/33 virus remained in G 1 with the percentage of cells in G 1 phase hovering above 80% at all time points (Fig. 5C ). Our results demonstrate that IAV infection impairs progression of cell cycle through the G 1 /S intersection.",

            "text": "To further prove that IAV infection induced cell cycle arrest in G 1 phase, we used a separate approach. Cells were preaccumulated in G 2 /M phase by treatment with RO-3306, a CDK1 inhibitor (56) . At 0 h p.i., both A/WSN/33-infected and control samples had comparable percentages of cells in all phases of the cell cycle (Fig. 5D) . Similar to the result obtained with lovastatin, the cell cycle pattern of virus-infected cells showed lower peaks for both S and G 2 /M phases when compared with uninfected cells (Fig. 5E ). Upon recovery of cells from drug restriction, both uninfected and infected cells resumed division and initiated a new round of cell cycle, displaying an increased percentage of cells representing G 0 /G 1 phase at 9 h p.i.; only uninfected cells, however, progressed further into S phase. The percentage of cells in G 0 /G 1 phase dropped from around 85 to 65% in the control sample, whereas it remained constant in IAV-infected cells (Fig. 5F ). Collectively, these results indicate that IAV infection perturbs normal cell cycle progression in human cell lines and installs a block at G 0 /G 1 phase. D-type cyclins activate CDK4/6, which initiate phosphorylation of Rb at multiple sites. Hyperphosphorylated Rb (ppRb) releases transcription factor E2F and leads to the activation and transcription of cell cycle progression-responsive genes (38, 57, 58) . To test whether IAV-induced cell cycle arrest was imposed by Rb, the phosphorylation status of Rb was monitored. Phosphorylation on serine 780 (ppRb Ser-780) is specifically catalyzed by the cyclin D-CDK4/6 complex but not cyclin E-CDK2 (59) . Not surprisingly, IAV infection progressively resulted in diminished levels of ppRb Ser-780 as a function of time (Fig.  6A) . Furthermore, serine 807/811 phosphorylation on Rb (ppRb Ser-807/811), which affects the S phase of the cell cycle displayed a similar trend (60) (Fig. 6A) , an observation consistent with the virus-induced block at G 0 /G 1 phase. In line with the down-regulation of ppRb proteins, accumulation of hypophosphorylated Rb (pRb) was observed (Fig. 6A) . Inhibition of cell cycle can also occur through induction of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs). P21 WAF1/CIP1 is a \"universal\" CKI that inhibits both cyclin and CDK subunits to install a p53-dependent G 1 phase arrest (61) . Interestingly, upon infection, p21 WAF1/CIP1 was down-regulated through proteasomal degradation, indicating that IAV-induced G 0 /G 1 arrest was not mediated through the p53/p21 WAF1/CIP1 pathway (Fig. 6, A and B) . Expression levels of p16 from the INK4 family of CKI, which specifically inhibits the catalytic subunits of CDK4 and CDK6, were also measured. No increase in p16 INK4A was observed even after prolonged infection time (data not shown).",

Control (NT siRNA-treated) and cyclin D3-deficient cells were infected with A/WSN/33 at an MOI of 0.01 to allow multiple rounds of infection.

Because cyclin D3-M2 interaction was identified using avian M2-CT, we measured the effect of Ccnd3 knockdown on the replication of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus and observed a more \u03fe10-fold higher progeny virus production in cyclin D3-deficient cells when compared with control group at 24 h p.i.

Concomitant knockdown of Ccnd3 and Rb1 rescued cells from the G 0 /G 1 phase block imposed by cyclin D3 deficiency, allowing us to measure the effect of cyclin D3 alone on virus replication. In addition, we included a Ccne1 knockdown, which induced cell cycle arrest at the G 1 /S interface without affecting cyclin D3 levels. To gain further confidence in the specificity of the cyclin D3 siRNA, we included a second siRNA duplex specific for cyclin D3 (CCND3 #2). Both individual siRNAs and siRNA combinations resulted in significant reduction of the desired gene expressions (Fig.  7C ). In the control siRNA-treated cell population, around 55% of cells were found in G 0 /G 1 phase of the cell cycle. As expected, knockdown of Ccnd3 alone arrested cell cycle progression in A549 cells with \u03f365% (CCND3 #1) or \u03f370% (CCDN3 #2) of cells in G 0 /G 1 phase when compared with cells treated with NT siRNA. A concomitant Ccnd3/Rb1 knockdown rescued cell cycle progression into S phase. Knockdown of Ccne1 expression in A549 cells induced a more robust cell cycle G 0 /G 1 phase accumulation than Ccnd3 knockdown with \u03f380% cells in G 0 /G 1 phase (Fig. 7D) . For all siRNA-mediated knockdowns, cells were subjected to infection with A/WSN/33 virus at an MOI of 0.01 at 72 h post-transfection for progeny virus production. Ccnd3 knockdown with the two individual siRNA duplexes increased progeny virus titers by approximately 1 log. Despite the rescue in cell cycle progression, a double knockdown of Ccnd3/Rb1 did not normalize virus production when compared with NT siRNA-treated cells. A 5-fold difference in viral titers persisted between control cells and those that harbored a double knockdown in Ccnd3/Rb1. Virus titers from cells with Ccne1 knockdown were comparable with those from Ccnd3/Rb1 double knockdown (Fig. 7E, left) .",

We postulated that binding of cyclin D3 to M2-CT might affect M1-M2 interaction, resulting in attenuated virus release due to either (i) production of defective virus particles due to improper packaging or (ii) incomplete assembly of virions and hence generation of fewer particles. To test this hypothesis, HEK 293T cells were co-transfected with cyclin D3, M1, and M2. Cells expressing M1 and M2 without exogenous cyclin D3 were used as control.

Densitometric analysis revealed that a reduction of \u03f370% in binding of M1 to M2 was observed when cyclin D3 was overexpressed (Fig. 10A, right) . An isotype control antibody used in parallel did not bind to M1 (Fig. 10A, left, lane 3) . Our results demonstrate that (i) cyclin D3 does not affect viral protein synthesis during IAV life cycle and (ii) interaction between M1 and M2 is significantly attenuated in the presence of cyclin D3. We propose that through competition with M1 for M2 binding, cyclin D3 restricts IAV production either through reduced or defective progeny virion formation. To test this hypothesis, cyclin D3-deficient cells and control cells were infected with A/WSN/33 to measure plasma membrane expression of viral M2 protein within one cycle of infection. As illustrated in Fig. 6C , more M2 was detected at the plasma membrane in cyclin D3-deficient cells. This suggests that without the blockage imposed by cyclin D3, a greater amount of M2 could reach the cell surface and/or at a faster pace, thus facilitating the recruitment of viral internal components to the plasma membrane for assembly and budding. This trend could be observed at both time intervals, as summarized in Fig. 10B . In addition, we could validate these results using confocal imaging. Overexpression of cyclin D3 resulted in both M1 and M2 being predominantly confined to the early secretory network compared with control cells with endogenous cyclin D3 levels, where a significant fraction of M2 appeared at the plasma membrane (Fig. 10C) . Interestingly, although the absence of cyclin E1 (a weak interactor of M2), facilitates IAV progeny virus production, this effect occurs through a different mechanism because M2 surface expression remained unaffected in cells depleted of cyclin E1 (data not shown).",

We previously identified annexin A6 as a novel interactor with the M2-CT, which impairs budding and release of IAV at late stages of the virus life cycle (69) . More recently, M2 was found to interact with the ATG8/LC3 family of ubiquitin-related proteins residing on the autophagosomal membranes (70, 71) .

Being a key regulator of cell cycle progression, Ccnd3 knockdown by default leads to cell cycle G 0 /G 1 phase arrest, providing a favorable environment for IAV replication. Our results indicate that cyclin D3 functions beyond its role in cell cycle in the context of influenza infection. The absence of cyclin D3 in combination with accumulation of cell cycle in G 1 phase appears to have an additive effect on IAV progeny virus production, indicating that cyclin D3 deficiency specifically facilitates influenza virus production independently of the cell cycle. Instead, co-immunoprecipitation with M2 suggests that cyclin D3 impairs nascent virus production at a late stage of the virus life cycle by interfering with M1-M2 binding (Fig. 11 ). Our results illustrate yet another mechanism that IAV has evolved to counteract host defenses; cyclin D3 is redistributed from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where it is targeted for proteasomal degradation. Indeed, mislocalization and subsequent down-regulation of restriction factors is one of the recurring mechanisms viruses have adopted to overcome host defenses (72) . The presence of M2 traps cyclin D3 in the cytoplasm through two possible mechanisms: (i) M2 interacts with newly synthesized cyclin D3 and prevents it from translocating into the nucleus, or (ii) cyclin D3 is retained by M2 in the cytoplasm after its nuclear export. A detailed mechanism of how cyclin D3 is targeted to the proteasome complex and which E3-ligase ubiquitylates it will be pursued in future investigations. Down-regulation of the cyclin D3 transcript was previously observed in H5N1-infected cells, but its implication had not been addressed (73) . Our study has expanded the repertoire of IAV-M2 host interactors and proposes a novel function of cyclin D3 in the life cycle of IAV.",

For instance, HIV-1 accessory protein Vpr is reported to induce arrest in G 2 by activating protein phosphatase 2A, which acts on mitosis inhibitors Wee1 kinase and Cdc25 phosphatase (74) . Similar to our findings, some other viral proteins have been found to bind members of the cyclin family. Persistent infection with borna disease virus results in reduced G 2 to M progression (75) . Like-wise, the nucleoprotein of SARS-CoV inhibits the activity of CDK4 by binding to cyclin D, which blocks S phase progression (76) . Viral proteins associate with particular cell cycle components, thereby deregulating the host cell cycle clock to alter the environment for more efficient replication. It remains to be determined whether M2-cyclin D3 interaction inhibits the kinase activity of CDK4/6 after IAV infection. A cell cycle arrest in G 0 /G 1 by IAV infection was first reported by He et al. (49) , although this phenomenon was not investigated in mechanistic terms. The non-structural protein 1 (NS1) of IAV was later discovered to interact with and inhibit the activity of the Ras homolog gene family member A (RhoA), providing some molecular insights into the mechanism of IAV-induced cell cycle perturbation (77) . The present study quantitatively demonstrated that IAV infection imposes a specific G 0 /G 1 arrest and established cyclin D3 mislocalization and degradation following its interaction with M2 as the underlying molecular correlate.",

We demonstrated that the increase in progeny virus production upon Ccnd3 knockdown was not a result of enhanced viral protein synthesis in host cells. Instead, the inhibitory effect of cyclin D3 on IAV infection is due to its interaction with viral M2 protein, as measured by competitive co-immunoprecipitation assays. We hypothesize that cyclin D3-M2 interaction either masks the domain on M2 mediating binding to M1 or has a higher affinity than that between M1 and M2. Another possibility is that cyclin D3-M2 interaction sequesters the amount of available M2. Consequently, limited M1-M2 binding during the budding process of IAV infection results in fewer progeny virions being efficiently packaged and released from host cells. Several host factors have been identified that interfere with the late stage of the viral life cycle, among which tetherin (also known as BST-2) is the best characterized. In addition, interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) products are a group of newly emerging host restriction factors that can control viral, bacterial, and parasite infection, as exemplified by viperin and ISG15, to name a few (78 -81) . The current study includes cyclin D3 in the family of IAV budding inhibitors and provides insights into the dynamic interplay between cyclin D3 and M2 during IAV infection.",

Viral titers were obtained by a plaque assay on MDCK cells. Briefly, serial 10-fold dilutions of virus stocks were adsorbed onto a confluent monolayer of MDCK cells for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. Next, viral inoculums were removed, and cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4. Cells were then covered with 1% semisolid agar in DMEM complemented with 0.3% BSA and 1 g/ml FIGURE 11 . Working model of cyclin D3 function in the context of influenza virus budding. In normal cells, cyclin D3 displays nuclear localization, which is essential for cell cycle regulation. During influenza A virus infection, cyclin D3 interacts with viral M2 protein. The cyclin D3-M2 interaction impairs binding of M2 to M1, which is required for virus assembly and budding at the plasma membrane. In the absence of cyclin D3, more infectious progeny virus particles are released into the supernatant of virus-infected cells. Influenza virus, however, antagonizes cyclin D3 inhibition by (i) redistributing cyclin D3 between nucleus and cytoplasm, which contributes to cell cycle G 0 /G 1 arrest, thus facilitating virus replication, and (ii) targeting cyclin D3 to the proteasomal degradation pathway in the cytoplasm to remove its interference with M1-M2 binding.",
