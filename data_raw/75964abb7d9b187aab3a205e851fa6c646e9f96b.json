However, there currently exists no systematic mapping between cell types and the diseases they can cause. Methods: In this study, we integrate protein-protein interaction data with high-quality cell-type-specific gene expression data from the FANTOM5 project to build the largest collection of cell-type-specific interactomes created to date. We develop a novel method, called gene set compactness (GSC), that contrasts the relative positions of disease-associated genes across 73 cell-type-specific interactomes to map genes associated with 196 diseases to the cell types they affect. We conduct text-mining of the PubMed database to produce an independent resource of disease-associated cell types, which we use to validate our method. Results: The GSC method successfully identifies known disease-cell-type associations, as well as highlighting associations that warrant further study. This includes mast cells and multiple sclerosis, a cell population currently being targeted in a multiple sclerosis phase 2 clinical trial. Furthermore, we build a cell-type-based diseasome using the cell types identified as manifesting each disease, offering insight into diseases linked through etiology. Conclusions: The data set produced in this study represents the first large-scale mapping of diseases to the cell types in which they are manifested and will therefore be useful in the study of disease systems. Overall, we demonstrate that our approach links disease-associated genes to the phenotypes they produce, a key goal within systems medicine.",

It is estimated that there are at least 400 different cell types present within the human body [1] , each performing a unique repertoire of functions, the disruption of which may lead to the development of a disease [2] . Thousands of genes that influence human disease have been identified through linkage analysis, genome-wide association studies and genome sequencing [3] . In many cases, the cell types that these genes directly affect and through which promote disease development have yet to be characterized or are still being debated. Identification of these cell types previously limited the large-scale mapping of diseases to cell types.",

            "text": "The molecular basis of diseases can also be explored using the interactome, a network created by integrating all interactions known to occur between proteins. Tens of thousands of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) have been identified [12] and used in tasks such as the prioritization of disease-associated genes [13, 14] and the prediction of the phenotypic impact of single amino acid variants [15] . However, the majority of methods that detect PPIs operate in vitro, meaning that unlike gene expression, we have little understanding of the contexts in which PPIs take place. This lack of context-specific PPI data means that the majority of methods that use the interactome to explore the molecular basis of a disease use a generic PPI network [13, 14] , rather than a PPI network specific to the context of the disease being studied. This has been seen to limit the success of these methods [16] . Computational approaches have been developed to create context-specific biological networks [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . These approaches often use gene expression data to modify generic PPI networks, either through the removal of proteins not expressed in a given context [16] [17] [18] 20] or through the re-weighting of interactions deemed more likely to occur in a given context [16] . Whilst these methods have been used to create tissue-specific interactomes, few cell-type-specific interactomes have been created.",

This approach is validated using text-mined disease-cell-type associations from the PubMed database. An implementation of the method described in this study and the 73 cell-type-specific interactomes are available to download [22, 23] . These resources will be useful in the identification of additional disease-associated cell types as more gene expression data become available, as well as in the development of tools better able to explore the etiology of a disease given its cellular context.

We next removed diseases classified as congenital, hereditary, and neonatal diseases and abnormalities (due to the lack of fetal data within the gene expression data set) and neoplasms (due to the previous observation that unlike other diseases, cancer-associated genes tend not to be overexpressed in the tissues in which the cancers are located [6] ) using the disease classifications provided by DisGeNET (reducing the number of diseases to 2143). We then removed associations extracted from the literature supported only by a single evidence source (reducing the number of diseases to 1898). To increase the number of genes associated with each disease, we pooled the genes associated with sub-types of diseases wherever possible, by removing the number that follows the disease name in many DisGeNET entries (reducing the number of diseases to 1679). We also removed genes for which there were no gene expression data in the expression data set (reducing the number of diseases to 1557). Finally, we removed diseases that did not map to a disease medical subject heading (MeSH) term (from trees C and F03 of the 2015 MeSH tree structure, reducing the number of diseases to 1544). All genes were mapped to Ensembl gene identifiers using the biomaRt R package [24] . The GSC method works by measuring network distances between pairs of genes and therefore cannot be applied to diseases with only a single associated gene. For this reason, it is not possible to apply the GSC method to all of the 1544 diseases with one or more associated genes. We have demonstrated that the GSC method works well when applied to diseases with six or more associated genes (see 'Parameter selection' below). Of the 1544 diseases with one or more associated genes, 196 diseases have six or more associated genes. In the main analyses, we therefore used this subset of 196 diseases.",

Complete linkage agglomerative hierarchical clustering was run using the JSD to cluster the samples. The resulting tree was cut at a height of 0.35 to split the samples into discrete clusters within each sub-facet. For each sub-facet, samples not contained within the largest cluster were removed. If no cluster contained more than one sample, all samples mapped to the sub-facet were removed. In total, 331 (91.4 %) of the 362 primary cell samples passed this quality control procedure.

The analyses conducted in this study require a single expression profile for each cell type and it was therefore necessary to combine these replicate samples. As previously explained, each sub-facet contains samples corresponding to a single cell type and these sub-facets are further organized into broader facets. However, the cell types found throughout the body are not represented equally within these facets and sub-facets. Cell types that are less accessible or more difficult to isolate from primary tissues, such as pancreatic cells and dendritic cells, are less well represented. This can be seen by comparing the number of sub-facets contained within each facet: the dendritic cell facet contains three sub-facets, while the vascular-associated smooth muscle cell facet contains ten sub-facets. If we were to combine samples using the sub-facet groupings then we would produce a disproportionately large number of vascular-associated smooth muscle cell expression profiles, which would potentially have a deleterious effect on the later analyses. Many of the sub-facets contained within these larger facets may represent similar cell types and therefore contain samples with similar gene expression profiles. Therefore, to produce a single expression profile for each cell type whilst avoiding the production of similar expression profiles as a result of uneven cell-type representation, we considered the similarity of the expression profiles of the samples within each facet.",

If the mean JSD was less than 0.25, we combined samples by their facet, producing a single expression profile under the name of the facet. A value of 0.25 was chosen after manual inspection of the functional-similarity of the sub-facets contained within each facet, along with the mean JSD between the samples within each facet. As previously mentioned, the vascular-associated smooth muscle cell facet contains ten sub-facets, many of which are functionally similar. Conversely, the mesenchymal stem cell facet contains seven sub-facets, representing stem cell populations that will form diverse cell and tissue types, including adipose tissue, hepatic cells and osteoblasts. We speculated that disruption to these diverse cell and tissue types may produce different phenotypes and therefore chose a value that would produce distinct expression profiles for each of these sub-facets. The mean JSD between the mesenchymal stem cell facet samples is 0.259 and we therefore chose a value of 0.25 to produce distinct expression profiles for the sub-facets within this facet, whilst producing a single expression profile for those facets containing functionally similar sub-facets, including the vascular-associated smooth muscle cell facet.

This would prohibit the use of the random walk with restart (RWR) method to measure distances between vertex pairs as these high-weight edges would come to dominate the movement of the walker.

In a weighted graph, the probability distribution is based upon the weights of the edges, so that the walker is more likely to travel along an edge of high weight. As the number of time steps increases, the probability that the random walker will be located at each vertex converges to a steady state [31] .",

Cellular pathways are represented within PPI networks and because of this, sets of disease-associated genes tend to cluster within PPI networks [4, 40] .

Pathways whose disruption leads to a disease are likely to be active within the cell types associated with the disease. Therefore, we would expect disease-associated genes to cluster most strongly in the interactomes specific to the disease-manifesting cell types, providing us with a method of identifying these cell types. As no cell-type-specific interactomes are available, we integrated the FANTOM5 project cell-type-specific gene expression data with 32,275 PPIs from the STRING database [12] to build the largest collection of cell-typespecific interactomes currently available. In these interactomes, each vertex represents a gene and each edge a physical interaction weighted using the product of the gene pair's percentile-normalized gene expression scores (Additional file 8: Figure S4) .",

The compactness score is defined as the mean distance between pairs of vertices in a set in a graph. The smaller the compactness score of a vertex set, the stronger the interactions between the Fig. 1 Monocyte-specific psoriasis sub-network. To create the sub-network, the protein products of all psoriasis-associated genes (squares) and their interacting partners (circles) were identified. To improve visual interpretation, psoriasis-associated genes with more than 15 interacting partners were removed. The more overexpressed each gene is in monocytes, the darker the color of the vertex. Edges with larger weights are darker blue and thicker. This sub-network is enriched with high-weight edges (P = 0.0001 when genes with more than 15 interacting partners are not removed) that connect many of the disease-associated genes, suggesting that cell-type-specific interactomes may be useful in gene prioritization vertices in the set. If a vertex set interacts more strongly than expected by chance, then the vertex set can be said to cluster [30] .",

This was done using the cross-referencing provided by the FANTOM Consortium and DisGeNET, a number of controlled vocabularies, including UMLS [34] and Uberon [33] , the MeSH database and manual curation. Mapping diseases was relatively simple, as there exists a unique MeSH term for the majority of diseases in DisGeNET. Mapping cell types was more difficult, due to the relatively small number of cell types represented in the MeSH database. For example, the 73 cell types include five different types A B C Fig. 2 Overview of the GSC, text-mining and GSO methods. (A) For the GSC method, percentile-normalized relative gene expression scores are integrated with PPI data to create interactomes. Permuted interactomes are created by permuting the expression scores. The compactness score of the disease-associated gene set is computed for each observed and permuted interactome and empirical P values produced by counting the proportion of permuted compactness scores less than the observed compactness score. (B) To complete the text-mining, diseases from DisGeNET and cell types from the FANTOM5 project were mapped to MeSH terms using a number of controlled vocabularies. These MeSH terms were then used to query PubMed and count the number of articles individually and co-mentioning terms. Fisher's exact test was used to determine whether the number of co-mentioning articles is greater than expected by chance. (C) For the GSO method, percentile-normalized gene expression scores are used to create observed and permuted expression profiles. The mean expression score of the disease-associated gene set is then computed for the observed and permuted expression profiles. Empirical P values are computed by counting the numbers of permuted scores greater that each observed score of fibroblast (fibroblasts of the choroid plexus, gingiva, lymphatic vessel, periodontium and tunica adventitia of artery). The MeSH database does not contain a unique term for each of these fibroblast sub-types. We therefore combined the most-representative cellular MeSH term (in this example 'Fibroblast') with anatomical MeSH terms to differentiate between the cell types. These combined MeSH terms were then used to query PubMed. A one-tailed Fisher's exact test was used to identify cell-type/disease pairs co-mentioned more frequently than expected by chance [35] . In total, text-mining identified 1150 associations between the 73 cell types and the 196 diseases (Additional file 14: Table S9 ).",

At these FDRs, the overlap between the GSO and text-mining results is also significant. While a similar proportion of GSC-and GSO-identified associations are supported by text-mining (Additional file 20: Figure S8 ), the advantage of using cell-type-specific interactomes to explore the molecular mechanisms that drive disease is their ability to identify previously unidentified disease-associated genes and pathways. These results demonstrate that disease-associated genes interact more strongly in the interactomes of the disease-manifesting cell types. These interactomes are therefore more likely to be informative when identifying previously unidentified disease-associated genes. The GSC and GSO methods identify different sets of associated cell types, indicating that they represent complementary approaches. However, there is still a large amount of support between the GSC and GSO methods (Additional file 21: Figure S9 ). For 64.0 % of diseases, at least 50 % of the associations identified by the GSC method are supported by the GSO method.",

The GSC, GSO and text-mining methods identify different numbers of associations between diseases and cell types of different classes (Table 2) . A greater proportion of the cell types identified by the GSC and GSO methods as being associated with immune system diseases are cell types of the immune system. Conversely, a greater proportion of the cell types identified by textmining as being associated with cardiovascular diseases and mental disorders are cell types of the cardiovascular system and neural cell types, respectively. The GSC and GSO methods identify low numbers of cardiovascular cell types as being associated with cardiovascular diseases, compared to text-mining. This may indicate that these methods are less effective when applied to this disease class. Many of the cell types identified as associated with cardiovascular diseases by the GSC and GSO methods are cell types of the immune system, possibly reflecting an important role for the immune system in cardiovascular disease development [42] . As previously mentioned, the text-mining method used in this study does not take into account the context in which a cell type or disease is mentioned and therefore cannot distinguish between the cell types directly affected by the disease-associated genes and indirectly affected cell types. This may contribute to the differences seen between the methods. To test this, textmining methods that are able to incorporate the contexts in which cell types and diseases are mentioned in articles will need to be developed and applied. The MeSH database and cell ontology were used to identify diseases and cell types belonging to each class. A disease and cell type were said to belong to a class if they were descendants of the following terms: cardiovascular diseases (C14), cardiovascular cells (CL:0002139 and CL:0002494), immune system diseases (C20), immune system cells (CL:0000738), mental disorders (F03) and neural cells (CL:0002319).

Although text-mining does not identify an association between mast cells and MS, there is some evidence that mast cells may play a role in the initiation and progression of the disease. Mast cells are known to be key regulators of the permeability of the blood-brain barrier [44] and decreased permeability of this barrier is one of the earliest signs of MS [45] . Furthermore masitinib, an inhibitor of mast cell activity, migration and survival, was seen to produce small but non-significant improvements in MS patients in a phase 2a clinical trial [46] .

It has been suggested that natural killer cells may contribute to this endothelial cell dysfunction through the production of signaling proteins that affect the migration of the endothelial cells [50] . Adipocytes produce adipokines known to affect endothelial cell function and have therefore also been implicated in endothelial cell dysfunction [51] . Furthermore, obesity is known to both affect the production of these adipokines and increase the risk of preeclampsia threefold [51] .

While many individuals exhibit age-related changes within their joints, only some display the symptoms associated with osteoarthritis [53] . Multiple genes have been identified as being associated with osteoarthritis, but how these genes influence the development of the disease is still not known. Chondrocytes are the only cell type residing in the adult cartilage matrix and are responsible for the repair of the cartilage [54] . Osteoarthritis-associated genes may therefore influence the development of the disease through the disruption of the chondrocytes and this repair process. Parts of the inflammatory complement system have been observed to be present at elevated levels in the synovial fluids of individuals with early-stage osteoarthritis [55] . Mice models of osteoarthritis genetically deficient in these complement components exhibit less cartilage loss than mice that are not deficient in these components [55] . This demonstrates the importance of the immune system in the development of osteoarthritis and raises the possibility that osteoarthritis-associated genes promote the development of the disease through the disruption of the cells of the immune system. However, the GSC method identifies chondrocytes as the cell type most significantly associated with osteoarthritis (q = 0.005), supporting the hypothesis that chondrocyte dysregulation is key to the development of the disease.

However, morbid obesity (classified as a body mass index greater than 40 [62] ) is most strongly correlated with four diseases of the immune system (three from the immune system diseases class and celiac disease). Increased macrophage numbers have been observed in the adipose tissues of both obese mice and obese humans and to contribute to the activation of inflammatory pathways in these tissues [64] . Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s), a cell population involved in the regulation of adaptive immunity [65] , have been recently observed to be critically involved in the regulation of brown and beige adipocytes [66] , which are linked to the prevention of weight gain [67] . Furthermore, ILC2s have been observed at lower frequencies in the adipose tissues of obese humans compared to non-obese humans [66] , leading to the suggestion that disruption of this immune system cell population may promote obesity in humans. These results, along with the connections in the diseasome between morbid obesity and diseases of the immune system, provide support for involvement of the immune system in the development and progression of severe forms of obesity. Integration of disease-manifesting cell-type data with additional genomic and clinical data will likely improve our ability to identify important connections between diseases.",

Moreover, the power of a study aimed at detecting the cis-effect on gene expression using biological samples is greatly limited by the presence of a non-homogeneous cell population in these tissues, such as blood, adipose or liver tissues. We have developed a novel approach that integrates cell-type-specific gene expression data with PPI data to identify those cell types through which sets of disease-associated genes exert their effect.

We have used text-mining to demonstrate that by comparing the clustering of disease-associated genes across cell-type-specific interactomes, it is possible to identify disease-manifesting cell types. It has recently been shown that the enrichment of disease-causing SNPs within cell-type-specific cis-regulatory regions can also be used to identify the cell types in which a disease is manifested [68] .

Many of the psoriasis-associated genes form part of a monocytespecific sub-network enriched with high-weight edges (P = 0.0001, see 'Methods'). This sub-network could be used to prioritize additional psoriasis-associated genes. Genes that do not form part of this monocytespecific sub-network may influence the disease through another cell type.

Performance of the GSC method when applied to interactomes created using various confidence score cutoffs and run using various restart probabilities.

Performance of the GSC method when applied to sets of diseases with different numbers of associated genes. Performance is measured using associations identified by the text-mining as true positives. Sets of disease-cell-type associations were produced by applying an FDR cutoff of 10 % to the GSC and text-mined associations. Overlap significance was measured using Fisher's exact test.

Simulated (A) percentile-normalized gene expression scores and (B) PPI data are used. Edge weights (w) in the re-weighted network (C) are the product of the expression scores of the interactors. Higher weights are indicative of stronger interactions and therefore smaller distances between the interactors. To illustrate this, the distance along each edge is set as the reciprocal of the weight. The thickness and color of each edge is also proportional to the weight, with higher-weight edges represented by thicker and darker lines. Each vertex is colored by its gene expression score, so that vertices with higher expression scores are darker in color. From this toy example, it is clear that re-weighting the edges of the network results in the high-scoring vertices interacting more strongly (for example, g and h).

Disease-cell-type associations were ranked by their q value. The number of associations represents the size of the set of the top-ranked disease-cell-type associations. To compute the proportion of disease-cell-type associations supported by text-mining, it was necessary to apply an FDR cutoff to the text-mining results. Here we use three cutoffs: (A) 10 %, (B) 1 % and (C) 0.1 %. The GSC method assigned 219 associations the lowest-possible P value, while the GSO method assigned 211 associations this P value. It was not possible to order these top-ranked associations and therefore the GSC and GSO curves start at 219 and 211 respectively. (PDF 706 kb ) Additional file 21: Figure S9 . Histograms showing the proportions of disease-associated cell types identified by one method supported by another. An FDR cutoff of 10 % was applied to the results of each method to produce sets of disease-cell-type associations. For each disease, the proportion of associations identified by method m 1 supported by method ",
