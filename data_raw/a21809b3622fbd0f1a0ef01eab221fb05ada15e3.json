Risk factors for high mortality and prolonged morbidity after RSV infection include premature birth, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, congenital heart disease, and Down syndrome. However, some previously healthy, full-term children who are infected with RSV also require hospitalization and even experience severe sequelae or death. Case presentation: In this report, we present the case of an RSV-associated death of a child who was born at full-term and developed normally up to the age of 2 years old. Cardiopulmonary arrest occurred within 3 days after the onset of symptoms, which included cough and high fever. Complete brain edema was prominent, and encephalopathy was developing. Viral antigen detection and microbiome analyses of oral swab and nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens verified an RSV infection, while bacterial culture of blood specimens yielded negative results. The RSV strain detected in this patient was subtyped as RSVB9, and no mutation was found in the six antigenic sites for targeted drugs or vaccines. Conclusions: The patient had a severe infection associated with RSV, which was very likely the cause of her central nervous system infection and acute neurological complications.",

In most cases, the virus is not fatal. The most severe infections and well-defined high-risk groups, including infants with a history of premature birth, and those with chronic lung disease, congenital heart disease, cystic fibrosis and immunodeficiency [2] . For those high-risk infants, palivizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody which has produced favorable results to date, is strongly recommended to be administered prophylactically [3] . However, most children with RSV infection were previously healthy, and it is often difficult to predict deterioration of RSV infection [2, 4] .",

The symptoms started on 10 November (3 days before admission), with a fever (up to 39.8\u00b0C) but no chills, rash or convulsions. Ibuprofen was given orally. The body temperature decreased for 4 to 5 h but then climbed to 40.3\u00b0C. Shortness of breath accompanied the fever, and the body temperature did not decrease obviously after the oral administration of ibuprofen. Wheezing caused by the retention of phlegm in the throat and a single paroxysmal cough occurred. The patient occasionally coughed up a small amount of yellow phlegm and had a slightly runny nose. She had no asthma, breathing difficulty or hemoptysis; she had lethargy and a poor appetite but no vomiting or diarrhea. On 11 November (2 days before admission), the patient still had a high fever, and her body temperature fluctuated around approximately 40\u00b0C. The patient's body temperature did not obviously decrease after she was given oral ibuprofen and acetaminophen alternately. Acute infection was considered from then on. The patient received an intravenous infusion of 0.14 g Zithromax and 120 mg rographolide as well as aerosol inhalation of 2 mg budesonide, but her fever persisted, and her body temperature rose to a peak of 40\u00b0C. On 12 November (1 day before admission), the patient still had a persistent fever and wheezing due to the retention of phlegm in her throat. She had shortness of breath, a light cough, and a drooping spirit, accompanied by a rash on the torso and limbs. Her appetite was slightly improved, and she had no vomiting or convulsions. On 13 November, the patient had sudden respiratory and cardiac arrest 3 h before admission. She was immediately and continuously treated with cardiopulmonary resuscitation by physicians and the intravenous injection of adrenaline (4 times). She was treated with trachea cannula and mechanical ventilation, and her heart beat recovered approximately 15 min later, but the patient remained in a deep comatose state with no spontaneous breathing. Then, the patient was transferred to our hospital and immediately underwent electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring. Bloody fluid was visible in the indwelling gastrointestinal decompression tube, and the blood-gas analysis showed metabolic acidosis. The patient was treated with sodium bicarbonate to correct the acidosis. She was diagnosed with an acute CNS infection and brain hernia. After cardiopulmonary resuscitation, she was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). The head CT scan showed extensive brain swelling, decreased brain parenchymal density, narrowed cerebral ventricles and cisterns. These findings prompted a diagnosis of extensive brain edema and hernia. The chest posteroanterior radiograph showed fuzzy, coarse bilateral lung markings, visible small patchy shadows in the right inferior lung and a clear pulmonary hilus. These findings were diagnosed as pneumonia. Routine blood examination results suggested the presence of a bacterial infection; thus, the patient was treated with vancomycin and meropenem to control an infection. After that, immunoglobulin (1 g/kg) was administered for immune support. The patient was still in a deep coma state, and light reflexes of both pupils were absent. The patient's spontaneous breathing was weak and irregular, and she had no response to painful stimulation. Compared with earlier, her rash was reduced, and the pulmonary lesions shown on the chest posteroanterior radiograph were slightly absorbed. Immunoglobulin (1 g/ kg) was continuously administered to neutralize pathogens. On 15 November (3 days after admission), transcranial Doppler ultrasound assessment showed that the patient's anterior and posterior cerebral circulation corresponded to the diagnostic criteria for brain death. On 17 November (5 days after admission), various organ functions failed, and the patient could not tolerate a spontaneous breathing test. Her guardian chose to quit treatment, and the patient died.",

The mechanism of RSV-related apnea is unknown, but a significantly reinforced laryngeal chemoreflex or an immature respiratory center in infancy has been proposed [11, 13] . Evidence of an encephalitic pathology caused by RSV infection is sparse. The presence of RSV in CSF, detected using polymerase chain reaction, was reported in a single case of a 4-month-old boy with febrile seizure [14] .

This disease progresses quickly in a small number of cases, especially in children younger than 3 years old. At 1-5 days after onset, complications such as meningitis, encephalitis, encephalomyelitis, pulmonary edema and circulatory disorders occur. A very small number of infections worsen and lead to death. However, symptoms such as herpes and pulmonary edema were not observed in this patient, and both viral pathogen analyses showed negative results for enteroviruses, so this speculation was not supported. (2) High pathogenic influenza virus infection: the typical symptoms include fever, cough, sore throat, headache, body pain and fatigue. Some patients progress quickly to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), shock and acute necrotic brain injury. However, this child underwent repeated influenza A virus antigen detection, and all results were negative; thus, this speculation was not supported. (3) Fulminant myocarditis: the initial symptoms primarily include fever, cough, fatigue and vomiting. The disease develops rapidly and can lead to sudden congestive heart failure, cardiogenic shock, and Adam-Strokes syndrome. ECG sometimes demonstrates ST-T changes, myocardial infarction, and arrhythmia. The cardiac ultrasound may show left ventricular enlargement. However, no abnormalities were observed in the ECG or heart ultrasound analyses of our patient; thus, this speculation was not supported.",

We could not be sure whether the neuroinvasion of RSV did occur in this case because RSV has only rarely been identified in CNS specimens [12] . This finding is somewhat similar to that of influenza encephalitis. Britton et al. have described cases of influenza-associated neurological disease without testing for influenza viruses in CSF specimens [16] . Whether the influenza virus invades the CNS or not is still controversial. Fujimoto et al. reported that influenza virus RNA was detected in the CSF of 71.4% (5/7) of patients who developed influenza-associated acute encephalopathy/encephalitis [17] . However, in other reports, only a small number of patients were positive for viral RNA in the CSF and brain, and there was a lack of inflammation in the brain tissue of fatal cases [18] [19] [20] [21] . In the reported cases, no influenza RNA was detectable in the CSF. However, this finding does not exclude influenza as a cause of the encephalitis because the viral RNA may have been cleared by the time the CSF was taken. The fact that the RNA is no longer detectable does not Fig. 1 Heatmap based on the read numbers of pathogens derived from the oral swab, nasopharyngeal aspirate, and serum specimens. The clinical specimens are listed in the bottom row, and the pathogen names are presented in the left column. The boxes colored from blue to red represent the metagenomic sequencing reads observed (the reads varied between 2 0 and 2 15 ) exclude an earlier CNS insult by the virus causing the current symptoms. For the case reported here, although direct evidence of RSV infection in the CNS was not available, the clinical symptoms together with the laboratory findings and metagenomic analysis results suggested that the patient may have had severe sepsis that potentially resulting from an RSV infection with a high probability of CNS infection and acute neurological complications.",
