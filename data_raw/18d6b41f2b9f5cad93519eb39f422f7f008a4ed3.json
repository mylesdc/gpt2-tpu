However, understanding of the role of respiratory tract microbiota in the clinical course of pediatric CAP is limited. Methods: We sought to compare microbiota profiles in induced sputum and nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal (NP/OP) samples from children and to identify microbiota profiles associated with CAP severity. We used 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing and several measures of microbiota profiles, including principal component analysis (PCA), to describe the respiratory microbiota in 383 children, 6 months to <18 years, hospitalized with CAP. We examined associations between induced sputum and NP/OP microbiota profiles and CAP severity (hospital length of stay and intensive care unit admission) using logistic regression.",

However, newer models of CAP pathogenesis posit that the upper and lower airways are a complex and connected ecosystem and that CAP occurs as a consequence of disruptions in respiratory tract homeostasis [5] . Few, if any, culture-independent studies have examined associations between the clinical course of CAP in hospitalized children and samples from both the upper and lower respiratory tract.",

Nasopharyngeal (NP), oropharyngeal (OP), and induced sputum samples were collected from children at the Memphis, TN site. The value of respiratory tract samples for detection of bacterial CAP pathogens in children has been debated [19, 20] . Culture data from induced sputum samples have been shown to provide useful information in children with pneumonia [20] and cystic fibrosis [21] . While sputum samples have limitations, we hypothesized that they would provide relevant information regarding microbial environment of the lower airways in children with CAP [20, 22, 23] . Our overall goal was to describe the respiratory tract microbiota in children hospitalized with CAP. Specifically we sought to 1) use 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) microbial profiling to determine whether microbiota profiles differ between induced sputum and NP/OP samples from children hospitalized with CAP, and 2) identify microbiota profiles associated with CAP severity as measured by length of hospital stay (LOS) and intensive care unit (ICU) admission.",

First, we examined the distribution of the relative abundance of each taxon more frequent than 0.8 % of the microbial community (n = 22 taxa). The distributions for relative abundances were highly skewed; therefore, we identified the top quartile of the distribution within each age group. Cutoff values for the 75 th percentile are shown in Additional file 1: Table S1 . We then created a binary variable for each sample taxon as being in the top quartile of the distribution or not. Second, we identified individual taxa that were differentially abundant in groups of samples using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LefSe) [31] . We used 2.0 as the threshold cutoff value on the logarithmic LDA score for identifying taxa that differed in abundance between comparison groups [31] . Taxa within the airway microbiota may co-colonize based on similar nutritional requirements or utilization of secondary metabolites [32] . Thus, for our third approach, we used principal component analysis (PCA) to examine relationships among the same 22 taxa identified above. PCA is a statistical method used to identify groups of correlated variables within a dataset (e.g., bacterial taxa) [33] . These subsets of correlated variables are then combined into independent factors that represent linear relationships among taxa. The factors are interpreted as reflecting underlying processes that created the observed associations. We specified an eigenvalue of one and an orthogonal rotation in the PCA. Taxa with a loading value of at least \u00b1 0.4 were retained and considered taxa of interest for that factor [10, 11, 33] .",

To explore associations between measures of microbiota profiles and CAP severity, we used multivariate logistic regression. In order to identify potential confounders, we evaluated unadjusted associations between individual patient characteristics and exposures of interest (e.g., taxa identified by LefSe as differentially abundant between groups) and outcomes (i.e., LOS or ICU admission) by chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, and analysis of variance or paired t-tests as appropriate.

Factor scores from PCA were included in models as continuous variables. Models were adjusted for potential confounders if they were associated with the exposure and the outcome (P < 0.15) in unadjusted analyses [34] .

Subsequent analyses were stratified by age group due to the age difference in prevalence of bacteria and respiratory viruses in this study population (Additional file 1: Table S2 ), and previously described differences in the prevalence of colonization by potential CAP pathogens and CAP severity by age [24, 36, 37] . (Table 2 and Additional file 2: Figure S1 ). In contrast, Streptococcus, Prevotella, or Pasteurellaceae was the dominant taxon in individual sputum samples for the majority of children 5 to <18 years ( Table 2 and Additional file 2: Figure S1 ).",

In contrast, we identified individual taxa and three different community profiles (factors) in sputum samples that were associated with CAP severity. These data suggest that 1) induced sputum samples provide useful information for understanding the microbial environment of the respiratory tract in children hospitalized with CAP, and 2) high relative abundance and certain combinations of bacteria in the respiratory tract (e.g., Gram-negative taxa such as Porphyromonadaceae and Prevotella) may be linked to the clinical course of CAP in hospitalized children. Commensals may contribute to the clinical course of CAP by altering host immune responses or the virulence of potential pathogens in a synergistic or additive manner [12] [13] [14] . Commensals may also produce \u03b2lactamases that interfere with antibiotic treatment of respiratory tract infections due to physical proximity with pathogens [38] [39] [40] . In healthy individuals, distinct microbiota live in different body sites [41] . NP and OP samples were combined prior to 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis and we could not tell whether the taxa originated from an NP or OP site. Moreover, we cannot definitively determine whether our sputum samples contained predominantly lower respiratory tract bacteria or upper respiratory tract taxa acquired during sampling. However, microbiota studies indicate that: 1) the upper and lower respiratory tract form an interconnected and complex ecosystem; 2) there is erosion of the zones of demarcation that differentiate microbiota niches in diseased compared to healthy states; and 3) non-native resident taxa frequently and transiently invade interconnected body sites within the respiratory tract [5, 23, 42, 43] . Even if our induced sputum samples contained taxa from the upper respiratory tract, these taxa may still contribute to the microenvironment in the lung by production of metabolites and/or by stimulation of systemic host responses [23] . In children 6 months to <5 years, high relative abundance of Actinomyces, Veillonella, and Rothia were associated with a decreased odds of LOS \u22654 days each individually and as a group. Actinomyces and Rothia are both Gram-positive members of the family Actinomycetaceae and Veillonella is a Gram-negative anaerobe. These taxa are generally considered part of the normal flora but have been identified in individuals with CAP [7, [44] [45] [46] . High relative abundance of Gram-negative aerobes Haemophilus and Pasteurellacea and low relative abundance of Streptococcus were associated with ICU admission. Non-typeable H. influenzae has frequently been isolated from children with recurrent CAP [47] . However, H. influenzae was only designated as the etiology of CAP in one child in our study using standard diagnostic methods.",

These species have been associated with pneumonia [48] , but a negative association with severe CAP has not been appreciated previously. PCA analysis showed that high relative abundance of Porphyromonadaceae, Bacteriodales, Lactobacillales, and Prevotella and low relative abundance of Streptococcus were associated with increased odds of LOS \u22654 days in children \u22655 years. Gram-positive Lactobacillales (i.e., lactic acid bacteria) are generally associated with respiratory health [9] . However, Gramnegative anaerobes including Porphyromonas species, Bacteroides, and pigmented Prevotella have been detected in cases of aspiration pneumonia and empyema in children [49] . When these taxa are identified in children with pneumonia, they are often found in mixed infections [50] . Prevotella intermedia, an oral bacterium, was recently shown to have synergistic effects on S. pneumoniae virulence in murine models of bacteremic pneumonia [51] . Transtrachial aspiration followed by culture has been used to identify anaerobes in 22-33 % of adults with CAP [52] . Thus, Gram-negative anaerobes such as Prevotella may play an important and underappreciated role in the clinical course of CAP in older children. A natural question is whether 16S rRNA microbial profiling adds important information relative to culturebased protocols. Log transformed relative abundances of Streptococcus, Heamophilus, Moraxella, and Staphylococcus were significantly associated with identification of S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, M. cattharalis, and S. aureus by culture (P = <0.0001 for each species identified by culture and the corresponding genus level taxon as determined by t-test). Culture of S. aureus was associated with increased odds of a LOS \u22654 days [aOR 2.48; 95 % CI 1. 25-4.90 ] in children 6 months to <5 years (Additional file 1: Table S3 ). Culture of the other bacterial pathogens from sputum was not associated with CAP severity (Additional file 1: Table S3 ). Thus, our data suggest that important insights can be gained by culture-independent analysis of the microbial community in sputum samples from children with CAP.",

            "text": "Our study has limitations and any potential causal associations between the presence of the identified taxa and CAP severity must be interpreted with caution. Induced sputum samples were collected once and we could not evaluate temporal changes in the microbiota. Contamination in 16S rRNA microbial profiling and metagenomic studies has been linked previously to water-and soil-associated bacteria [53] . We did not sequence reagent controls and there was potential for contamination despite our use of molecular biology grade water and commercial kits [53] . While we cannot definitively rule out contamination, we have several lines of evidence to suggest that our data reflect the community composition of our clinical samples: 1) samples were processed in random order, PCR cycles were kept to a minimum, and PCR reactions were done in duplicate as recommended by Salter et al. [53] ; 2) we limited our analyses to taxa present in greater than 0.8 % of the microbial community and did not include rare taxa in our analyses; and 3) our dominant taxa are consistent with those generally identified in studies of the human respiratory tract [11, 26, 27] . We did not calculate alpha and beta diversity measures because of concerns regarding the potential for inflation of diversity estimates due to contamination, PCR amplification, and sequencing errors on the Illumina platform [54, 55] . Our study population had high a proportion of children with asthma/ reactive airway disease and other chronic conditions and our results may not be generalizable to all hospitalized children with CAP. An improved understanding of the role of the respiratory microbiota in CAP may yield novel approaches towards prevention or treatment. For example, strategies for selectively introducing commensals (e.g., microbiota transplants) to promote optimal levels of biodiversity in the airways may emerge as effective methods for treating disease. However, more data are needed regarding the role of the respiratory microbiota in the clinical course of CAP before the translational goals of manipulating the respiratory flora for optimal health and resolution of disease can be realized. Additional studies are needed to confirm our findings and to provide mechanistic insights into relationships between the respiratory tract microbiota and CAP. Future data from laboratory and prospective epidemiologic studies will facilitate the design of effective prevention and treatment strategies for CAP that maintain the health-associated homeostasis between children and their commensal flora.",
