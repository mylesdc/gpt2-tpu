            "text": "Wild poliovirus (WPV) persists in diverse locales worldwide, spreading outward from endemic areas. In response to the international threat of WPV transmission and changes in the national vaccination policy, we established an environmental surveillance system to monitor the circulation of wild and vaccine-related poliovirus in Taiwan. From July 2012 to December 2013, we collected sewage specimens every month from 10 sewage treatment plants located throughout Taiwan. The specimens were concentrated by the two-phase separation method and then inoculated into L20B, RD, and A549 cells for virus isolation. Viral isolates were identified and serotyped by immunofluorescence assay or molecular analysis. A total of 300 sewage samples were collected, and the results showed 163 samples (54.3%) were positive for virus, and 268 isolates were identified. Among these, 75 samples (25%) were positive for enterovirus (EV), but no poliovirus was found. In addition, 92 isolates were identified as enteroviruses and the most common serotypes were coxsackievirus B4, coxsackievirus B3, and coxsackievirus B2. Interestingly, 102 (34%) and 82 (27.3%) specimens were positive for mammalian orthoreovirus (MRV) and adenovirus, respectively. This study confirmed that sewage surveillance can be a useful additional modality for monitoring the possible presence of wild-type or vaccine-derived poliovirus in wastewater, and can indicate the current types of viruses circulating in the population. Furthermore, since MRV was found in children with acute necrotizing encephalopathy and meningitis, the high incidence of MRV detected by environmental surveillance warrants further investigation.",

An unexpected PCR product was observed. After sequencing and blasting the NCBI database, the PCR products were identified as mammalian orthoreovirus (MRV). A possible reason for the unexpected identification of MRV by PanEV RT-PCR may be due to the similarity between the primer and L1 gene of MRV, as MRV was formerly classified as ECHO 10 [37] . In a study by Lelli et al., specific primers for the L1 region of all types of MRV were then applied to isolates which stained positive for the PanEV blend antibody in L20B cells [38] .

Therefore, to clarify the MRV genotypes isolated in this study, the S1 region (outer capsid gene) of the isolates was sequenced and compared with the sequences of MRV reference strains. Fig 4 shows the phylogenetic analysis of three serotypes of MRV based upon the S1 gene (nucleotides 147 to 1253) sequences. Thirty-one MRV were identified, including thirteen Type 1 (MRV1), fifteen Type 2 (MRV2), and three Type 3 (MRV3). Among these, MRV1 was more prevalent in 2012, whereas MRV1 and MRV2 co-circulated in 2013, and MRV3 was detected only in Neihu and Hualien, in northern and eastern Taiwan, in 2013. Sequence analysis and the phylogenetic tree showed that MRV1 and MRV2 persistently circulated in Taiwan and most MRV isolated in Taiwan was closely related to the reference strains isolated from patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome or meningitis reported previously in other countries.

During this 18-month survey period, 300 raw sewage specimens were examined to detect the presence of viruses. The results showed that coxsackievirus type B, echoviruses, adenoviruses, and mammalian orthoreoviruses were isolated from the sewage specimens with a positive rate of 54.3%, but no poliovirus was found. Among these, enteroviruses (34.3%) and MRV (35.1%) predominated, followed by adenovirus (30.6%). Based on data provided by the WHO, at least 30% of concentrated sewage from grab samples can be expected to test positive for NPEV [41] . Therefore, the high rate of non-polio enteroviruses in the environment can be considered proof that the environmental samples were processed and analyzed appropriately to preserve virus infectivity. This study was undertaken to supplement poliovirus surveillance in Taiwan by monitoring the possible presence of wild-type (WPV) or vaccine-derived (cVDPV) poliovirus in wastewater with a view to obtaining further evidence supporting the maintenance of Taiwan's polio-free status. The frequencies of detection of different enteroviruses differed by geographical area and year, but overall, coxsackievirus type B strains were isolated more often than echoviruses. These findings are similar to the results of some studies on sewage surveillance in other countries [42] [43] [44] [45] . Among coxsackievirus B strains, CVB2, CVB3, and CVB4 were the most prevalent between July 2012 and 2013 in Taiwan; however, CVB1 and CVB6 were not isolated in this study. According to a surveillance report by Taiwan's Centers of Disease Control (Taiwan CDC), among the coxsackievirus B strains, CVB3 and CVB4 were more frequent in 2012, whereas CVB2 and CVB4 predominated in 2013. This phenomenon was in agreement with the results of this study that showed the majority subtype of coxsackievirus B in 2012 was CVB3, which shifted to CVB2 and CVB4 in 2013. The results indicated that the environmental virus Phylogenetic analysis of the S1 gene of mammalian orthoreovirus. The S1 gene of MRV (nucleotides 147 to 1253) was analyzed. The unrooted tree was generated by the MEGA6 program using the neighbor-joining method with reference strains from the NCBI database. The GenBank accession number for the reference strains is given in brackets next to the virus name. The evolutionary distances were calculated using the Kimura 2-parameter method. Bootstrap value was computed on 1000 replicates and the significance of branch length was estimated by maximum likelihood. Only values higher than 70% are shown. strains reflect the viruses circulating in the population and highlight the potential risk of viruses spreading via wastewater. In addition, the rare isolation of coxsackievirus type A in our study might be related to the lower susceptibility of the cells used to isolate the viruses or the lower resistance of the viruses in the environment and the isolation process.",

It can be classified into three major serotypes: Type 1 Lang (T1L), Type 2 Jones (T2J), and Type 3 Dearing (T3D), which commonly cause asymptomatic infections or mild respiratory tract illness and enteritis in infants and children [37, 59, 60] . Other studies have reported a seropositive rate of more than 70% in 4-year-old children [27, 61] . Recently, a few novel MRV viruses were found in humans, such as, novel Type 2 MRV (MRV2TOU05), which seems to be closely related to porcine and human strains first isolated from 2 children with acute necrotizing encephalopathy in France; the mother of one patient also had influenza-like symptoms, and specific antibodies against MRV2TOU05 were detected [62] . Another novel Type 3 MRV was isolated from a child in the United States with meningitis. The virus also showed systemic spread and was found to produce lethal encephalitis in newborn mice after peroral inoculation [31] . Besides the novel MRV-infected pediatric cases, another novel MRV (Kampar virus) was identified from a throat swab of a 54-year-old patient with high fever, acute respiratory disease, and vomiting. Based on epidemiological tracing, there is a high probability that Kampar virus originated from fruit bats and is capable of causing human to human transmission according to the results of serological studies [63] . In previous studies, reoviruses were commonly found in environmental water sources, and human fecal contamination has been suggested as the source of the virus [64, 65] . Our PCR sequencing data of isolated MRV showed that mammalian orthoreoviruses Types 1, 2, and 3 were present in the environment. Sequence analysis also showed that MRV1 and MRV2 persistently circulated in Taiwan and most MRV isolated in Taiwan were closely related to the reference strains isolated from patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome or meningitis. These results suggest that the reoviruses isolated from sewage may have the potential to infect humans. However, no cases of MRV infection have been reported in Taiwan to date. Since the identification of MRV requires additional molecular analysis, it may be missed by routine viral identification. In addition, this study identified MRV from L20B cells, which are not normally used in routine settings. The etiologic agent remains unknown in many cases of encephalitis (32%-75%) [62] . MRV may be a potential risk factor with public health implications. Thus, L20B cell should be tested for routine viral isolation and PCR test is needed to identify MRV when MRV is suspected in human subjects.",

Our results showed that Taiwan was poliovirus vaccine strain-free in the environment two years after the oral poliovirus vaccine was replaced by the inactivated poliovirus vaccine. Although our surveillance data were negative for poliovirus, long-term monitoring is still needed to allow prompt action should WPV ever be detected. In addition, we combined cell culture and RT-PCR to assay large volumes of sewage and identify the viruses, so that infectious viruses could be detected, thereby providing meaningful data that can be applied in public health risk assessments. This is the first study to report the prevalence of MRV in sewage in Taiwan. The observations made in this investigation highlight the potential risk of MRV infection in humans. This report also suggests that continuous periodic surveillance of environmental virus is necessary to prevent the outbreak of disease or reduce casualties. Finally, since MRV was frequently identified in our environmental specimens, it is imperative that human cases with suspected MPV infection be thoroughly evaluated. Table.
