The formation of autophagosomes was induced by NSP3 and NSP5 and developed from the ER; the fusion of these autophagosomes with lysosomes was limited. Although NSP3 and NSP5 are ER transmembrane proteins, these proteins did not activate the ER stress signaling pathways.

PRRSV is an enveloped, single-stranded positive-strand RNA virus with a genome of approximately 15.4 kb that includes at least 9 open reading frames (ORFs); ORF1a and ORF1b encode nonstructural proteins (NSPs), and ORF2-ORF7 encode structural proteins [4, 5] . These NSPs are involved in viral replication and play key roles in regulating genomic transcription [6] . Among these NSPs, NSP3 and NSP5 are predicted to be transmembrane proteins and NSP9 possesses viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity [7] . PRRSV is usually grown in Marc-145 cells, which originated from monkey kidney epithelial cells.",

Generally, autophagy is triggered in cells stimulated with external factors, such as starvation or viral infection; the marker of autophagy is the formation of autophagosomes [10] . The integrated autophagy course primarily comprises three processes: first, the formation of autophagosomes; then, the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes; and last, degradation of the cargo in lysosomes. The first step of the autophagy process is that a membrane possibly derived from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) elongates, becomes curled, and then surrounds part of the cytoplasm, followed by the degradation of organelles, proteins and other cellular components. In this process, two proteins, namely, ATG12 and ATG5, form complexes via ubiquitin-like conjugation [11, 12] . Furthermore, ATG16 interacts with the ATG12-ATG5 complex to form the ATG12-ATG5-ATG16 protein complex, which plays a significant role in forming autophagosomes [13] . Finally, lysosomes fuse with mature autophagosomes to form autophagolysosomes; the contents of the autophagosome are degraded, and the substances inside the autophagolysosomes are delivered to the cytoplasm for transformation into amino acids and energy for cytoplasmic metabolism [14] .",

The ER is the main site of protein synthesis, lipid production and calcium ion storage in eukaryotic cells. A variety of proteins in the ER must be folded, assembled, processed, packaged and transported to the Golgi apparatus [16] . Once the cells are stimulated with internal and external factors, the balance between ER morphology and function is affected by the changes in molecular biochemistry. Protein processing and transport are blocked, and a large number of unfolded or misfolded proteins accumulate in the ER, leading to the unfolded protein response (UPR) [17] [18] [19] , which operates through three signaling pathways that play significant roles in regulating autophagy during viral infection [20, 21] . The ER stress response was recently shown to be induced by PRRSV infection, leading to the activation of JNK signaling pathways [22] .",

Additionally, NSP3 and NSP5 are ER transmembrane proteins, but these two NSPs trigger limited ER stress, and the autophagosomes induced by these two NSPs are derived from the ER and accumulate autophagic cargo to prevent fusion with lysosomes. Furthermore, an NSP3 truncation mutant consisting of only the hydrophobic domains did not induce the formation of autophagosomes.

Because PRRSV induced the formation of autophagosomes, we further explored which PRRSV NSPs played important roles in this process. Eukaryotic expression vectors carrying the Nsp cDNAs with an N-terminal mCherry tag were constructed and transfected into Marc-145 cells (Additional file 2: Figure S1 ). As shown in Fig. 2a and b, the GFP-LC3 puncta accumulated in Nsp3-mCherry-, Nsp5-mCherry-and Nsp9-mCherry-transfected cells. NSP9 is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) that plays important roles in viral transcription and replication, and NSP3 and NSP5 are predicted to be transmembrane proteins; these proteins are anchored on the cytoplasmic membrane and are part of the membrane-bound replication and transcription complex. Furthermore, LC3 levels were detected using immunoblotting to determine the effects of the two transmembrane proteins on autophagy. p62/sequestosome-1 is a protein that can bind to LC3 as a scaffold protein or a signaling adapter and may be increased at the beginning of autophagy process and degraded gradually. Based on the data presented in Fig. 2c , immunoblotting and immunofluorescence assay showed that the expression of the p62 protein was increased, indicating that NSP3 and NSP5 of PRRSV induced the formation of autophagosomes. As shown in Fig. 2d , a higher LC3II/ LC3I ratio was observed in Nsp3-mCherry-and Nsp5-mCherry-transfected cells than in mock-infected cells. We identified some of the effects of these two transmembrane proteins on cell autophagy to determine whether the NSPs affected cytoplasmic membrane fusion.",

Thus, PRRSV NSP3 and NSP5 are integral transmembrane proteins of the ER but not the mitochondria. The activation of autophagy is always affected by ER stress, which is due to protein processing dysfunctions; the C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) is overexpressed [38] , and the Xbp1 mRNA is spliced by phosphorylated IRE1. PRRSV triggers the activation of the IRE1\u03b1 and PERK branches of the UPR, suggesting that CHOP overexpression is activated by the PERK pathway and that the autophagosomes induced by PRRSV NSP3 and NSP5 are derived from the ER; therefore, we examined CHOP expression using immunoblotting, and we determined the splicing of the Xbp1 mRNA using PCR. As shown in Fig. 5c , compared to the expression of CHOP in mock-infected cells, this protein was noticeably upregulated in PRRSV-infected cells; however, the expression of CHOP in Nsp3-mCherry-and Nsp5-mCherry-transfected cells was not significantly Fig. 3 Autophagosomes originated from the ER but not mitochondria. a Marc-145 cells were transfected with Nsp3-mCherry and Nsp5-mCherry for 24 h; ATG5 is labeled in green, and nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue). Scale bars: 10 \u03bcm. Statistical analysis of the Pearson correlation coefficient for calnexin and ATG5. The Pearson colocalization coefficient is presented as the ratio of punctate signals of calnexin that were positive for ATG5. b Nsp3-mCherry and Nsp5-mCherry were expressed in Marc-145 cells. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were cultured with MitoTracker Green, a marker of mitochondria, and were then fixed and immunostained with an anti-ATG5 antibody (pink). Nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue). Scale bars: 10 \u03bcm. Statistical analysis of the Pearson correlation coefficient for MitoTracker Green and ATG5. The colocalization coefficient is presented as the ratio of fluorescent signals of MitoTracker Green that were negative for ATG5 changed. Thus, the involvement of PRRSV NSP3 and NSP5 in autophagy was not regulated by an ER stress-dependent pathway.",

As illustrated in Fig. 6b , the NSP3 mutant was successfully constructed, and the truncated protein exhibited a lower molecular weight than the normal NSP3 protein.

            "text": "Autophagy plays an important role in both the innate and adaptive immune responses, both of which eliminate intracellular microbes [39] . However, many pathogens that invade cells induce the formation of double-membrane autophagosomes to facilitate their own replication [40] . Almost all viruses induce the formation of autophagosomes, and autophagosomes provide the site for viral replication and assembly [41] . Additionally, individual nonstructural proteins or structural proteins may perform viral functions, such as inducing apoptosis or necrosis. In the present study, PRRSV CH-1a induced the formation of autophagosomes in the infected cells; these autophagosomes are purported to be the site of viral replication. Viral nonstructural proteins play important roles in the replication of the viral RNA and in the synthesis of viral particles. In virus-infected cells, the virus interferes with and destroys the normal metabolism of the host cell, causing cell death or apoptosis [42] . In many studies, viral nonstructural proteins have been shown to play important roles in virus-induced autophagy. In HCV-infected cells, NS3/4A blocks the RIG-I signaling pathway in the early stages of autophagy and modulates the binding of mitochondria-associated immunity-associated GTPase family M (IRGM) to promote autophagy [43] . Similarly, JEV NS3 targets IRGM to modulate autophagy [44] , and CBV2 protein 2B, whose C-terminal sequence plays a decisive role in autophagy, rearranges the cell membrane [45] . In our study, GFP-LC3 puncta accumulated in Nsp3-mCherry-, Nsp5-mCherry-and Nsp9-mCherry-transfected cells and p62 expression was increased, indicating that NSP3, NSP5 and NSP9 induced the formation of autophagosomes. Furthermore, we detected an increase in the ratio of LC3II to LC3I in cells transfected with Nsp3 and Nsp5, along with an increased expression of p62, confirming that NSP3 and NSP5 induce autophagy.",
