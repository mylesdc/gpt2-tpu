Various stages of computational and chemical biology research can benefit from this knowledge. The search for putative off-targets and the establishment of polypharmacological effects by comparing binding sites led to promising results for numerous projects. Although many cavity comparison methods are available, a comprehensive analysis to guide the choice of a tool for a specific application is wanting. Moreover, the broad variety of binding site modeling approaches, comparison algorithms, and scoring metrics impedes this choice. Herein, we aim to elucidate strengths and weaknesses of binding site comparison methodologies. A detailed benchmark study is the only possibility to rationalize the selection of appropriate tools for different scenarios. Specific evaluation data sets were developed to shed light on multiple aspects of binding site comparison. An assembly of all applied benchmark sets (ProSPECCTs-Protein Site Pairs for the Evaluation of Cavity Comparison Tools) is made available for the evaluation and optimization of further and still emerging methods. The results indicate the importance of such analyses to facilitate the choice of a methodology that complies with the requirements of a specific scientific challenge.",

On the other hand, the huge number of methods hampers the efficient selection of a specific tool. Our research is dedicated to the analysis of different cavity comparison tools. We use several binding site data sets to establish guidelines which can be applied to ensure a successful application of comparison methods by circumventing potential pitfalls. ",

            "text": "In parallel with the ever increasing number of available protein structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) [1] , various in silico techniques were developed to apply this structural knowledge [2] . In addition to molecular docking, structure-based pharmacophore searches, and MD (molecular dynamics) simulations, the comparison of ligand binding sites of available protein structures became a promising tool to exploit accessible knowledge and apply it to a range of scientific problems. It has proven to be beneficial in numerous drug discovery projects [3] [4] [5] and has been successfully applied in protein function prediction [4] and polypharmacology prediction [6] . However, the number of available binding site comparison methods is still growing [6] and it is becoming increasingly difficult to choose the most suitable method for a specific area of research. Although binding site similarities can now be retrieved from elaborate similarity databases [7] [8] [9] [10] , it is often advisable to perform additional comparisons, or it may even be necessary if proprietary structures are used. The importance of selecting an appropriate program and underlying binding site similarity metric is comprehensively summarized in an article by Kellenberger et al. [11] . The impact of the similarity measure on the study outcome was recently analyzed for one cavity comparison method [12] . The authors conclude that an assessment of the similarity measures employed is essential for the evaluation and optimization of novel comparison approaches. Binding site comparisons can be applied to investigate minor dissimilarities between evolutionarily related binding sites, as well as to reveal similarities between proteins that share no obvious global (sequence or structural) similarity. The latter kind of similarity between unrelated proteins is not only important for the analysis of off-target effects or in investigating polypharmacological activity of small molecules, but can also contribute at the very beginning of a drug discovery process by suggesting potential novel scaffolds and compound classes [13] . It is also possible to predict the function of uncharacterized proteins using structural data from well characterized proteins with a similar binding site. A detailed review of successful applications of various binding site comparison methods can be found elsewhere [5] .",

However, standardized benchmark data sets, as known for other in silico methodologies [14] [15] [16] , have never been developed for cavity comparison tools. This often precludes the selection of a suitable tool. The analysis presented herein aims to enable interested scientists to choose an appropriate tool for comparing ligand binding sites for specific applications. We have designed various independent and objective data sets to elucidate strengths and weaknesses of different comparison tools. The impact of these data sets with regard to various applications for binding site comparison will be discussed in detail. The foremost question to be addressed when selecting a suitable tool is: \"What is the aim of the binding site comparison?\" It has to be stated that binding site similarity \"lies in the eye of the beholder\". As a matter of fact, a method that can be used for all conceivable application domains might never be developed. The selection of the most suitable method will always depend on the available resources, the application domain, and the individual needs of the researcher. Sometimes, a combination of different tools could lead to optimal outcomes. Our results provide a number of indicators for the weaknesses and putative application domains of selected binding site comparison approaches. Ultimately, data sets and decision criteria are provided, which enable researchers to rationalize the choice of a binding site comparison method. Such analyses will hopefully assist in the development of an appropriate workflow, which ensures meaningful results. The complete sets of similar and dissimilar protein cavity pairs (ProSPECCTs-Protein Site Pairs for the Evaluation of Cavity Comparison Tools) are available for further benchmark studies and the evaluation of alternative and novel tools.",

A recent, impressive example shows that the combination of various tools of structure-based modeling and binding site comparison delivers insight into putative mechanisms of drug action [17] . Herein, we analyzed binding site comparison methods which are based on fingerprints (e.g., SiteAlign [18] and TIFP (Interaction Fingerprint Triplets) [19] ), graphs (e.g., Cavbase [20, 21] and IsoMIF [22] ), grids (VolSite/Shaper [23] ), and those that make use of alternative approaches (PocketMatch [24] and SiteHopper [25] ). KRIPO (Key Representation of Interaction in Pockets), that was originally designed for sub-pocket matching to facilitate bioisosteric replacement, can also be applied for ligand binding site comparison [26] and was included in our analysis. Additionally, TM-align [27] , which was developed to compare protein structures based on their overall structure, was evaluated as it was successfully applied in various medicinal chemistry scenarios. The freely available tools CMASA [28] , COFACTOR [29] , and Pocket-FEATURE [30] could not be analyzed. Both CMASA and COFACTOR can only be applied with pre-prepared data sets; they enable the user to compare the binding site of interest against sets of precomputed binding sites. PocketFEATURE is not publicly available.",

In contrast, an analysis of the AUC values, which represent the tools' overall performance, shows that some methods are highly sensitive with respect to binding site definition (FuzCav, PocketMatch, RAPMAD). This effect is most pronounced for binding site comparison tools that compare protein-ligand interactions. The interaction patterns of similar protein binding sites with different ligands strongly deviate from each other (Fig 3) . An overview of the aligned protein-ligand complexes can be found in S1 Fig. IsoMIF and KRIPO clearly outperform Grim and TIFP. While the former solely rely on the ligand for the site definition, the latter derive interactions based on the bound molecules. Both methods are highly dependent on the ligand's size and its chemical nature. Interaction-based tools should therefore be used in combination with a large set of available protein-ligand structures. If the number of known complex structures is low, it may be useful to perform molecular docking studies for further known ligands and use the resultant binding poses for the comparison in addition to experimentally derived complex structures. Moreover, the use of \"compound ligands\" might improve the results, i.e. using a number of ligands from different aligned structures for binding site definition. A similar approach was successfully applied in a study of binding site similarities [68] , but was restricted to similar or identical ligands. Alternatively, the analysis of ligand substructures (fragments) and their corresponding interaction patterns (sub-pockets), as described for KRIPO [26, 56] , might increase the robustness of binding site similarity searches.",

In this reduced set, comprising only 45 structures, the Tanimoto coefficient between all ligand pairs of one group never falls below 0.6 (S3 Table) . The performance of nearly all methods improved with this data set. In particular, the interaction-based methods' AUC values and EFs increased significantly. However, only slight improvements were observed for surface-and residue-based methods (S2 Fig) , as their binding site representation does not depend on bound ligands. The ligands in this data set show highly similar interaction patterns. In practice, structures of similar binding site pairs of unrelated proteins interacting with similar or even identical ligands are rarely known [64] . Consequently, residue-and surface-based methods should be preferentially used for drug repurposing, polypharmacology studies, or off-target prediction. A comparison of the graph-based methods Cavbase and Grim to their faster counterparts RAPMAD and TIFP shows a drop in sensitivity for the less accurate histogram-and fingerprint-based methods. Lower accuracy can be expected for nearly all fingerprint-, histogram-, or sorted-list based methods. The use of these tools is only recommended for very large data sets because the major benefit is their low run time. Nevertheless, the early enrichment is promising for all methods, underlining their general applicability. For the comparison of a small number of complex structures, e.g. to deduce evolutionary relationships or to analyze differences within a certain protein class, it might be beneficial to use a time-consuming but accurate method. In case of sites with chemically diverse ligands, interaction-based methods that generate ligand-dependent interaction patterns should not be applied.",

The ability of the applied scoring schemes to discriminate between active (i.e. similar) and inactive (i.e. dissimilar) cavity pairs was also analyzed using data set 1. This is vital to the application of binding site comparison methods. S3-S5 Figs show box plots that illustrate the distribution of scores for similar and dissimilar site pairs. These plots might assist in distinguishing between similar and dissimilar binding site matches in a query-based comparison. The statistical data derived from the Welch's t-test are given in S4 Table and underline the utility of the different scoring schemes in delimiting similar and dissimilar sites. A clear score-dependent distinction between active and inactive pairs can be observed for the residue-based methods Cavbase, SiteAlign, and TM-align as well as for the surface-based methods ProBiS and SiteHopper. In the publication introducing SiteAlign reasonable cut-off distances for similar binding site pairs for the distance measures d1 and d2 are given [18] . The threshold for d2 (below 0.2) agrees with our data (S3 Fig) for distance d3 differing from d2 only in the center used for distance calculations. The distances between the upper and lower limits of the active and inactive pairs are high for SiteAlign, SMAP, TM-align, and SiteHopper compared to other tools. The structures in this data set are highly similar as the protein structures share the same sequence. Pairs of similar binding sites of unrelated structures will consequently result in lower scores. A large gap between the mean scores of active and inactive pairs is beneficial, as similar but not identical binding sites are likely to yield scores in between these mean values. Therefore, the box plots are useful to estimate meaningful score ranges for similar sites, but should never be misinterpreted as fixed score thresholds applicable for specific binding site comparison projects (see next Results section).",

The use of binding site prediction, molecular docking, and a detailed visual inspection of the identified similarities are indispensable for TIFP, Grim, IsoMIF, and KRIPO. In contrast, residue-and surface-based methods are the best choice for the elucidation of relationships between sites in complex with different ligands. The scoring metrics for most tools ensure a good discrimination between similar and dissimilar binding site pairs. Nevertheless, the use of fast and unspecific, but sensitive methods (RAPMAD, PocketMatch, FuzCav) should be avoided whenever possible. Their high false negative rates also show that a high proportion of similar pairs remain undiscovered by these methods.",

Such observations encouraged us to design a second data set for analyzing whether conformational changes influence the outcome of binding site comparison methods. Solution NMR structures provide easy access to a conformational ensembles of protein structures with the same binding sites containing larger and smaller conformational variations. The binding site RMSD (root-meansquare deviation) values are higher than for data set 1 (S2 and S5 Tables).

This result points toward a challenge concerning automated druggability estimation in combination with binding site flexibility, as already observed during the development of automated druggability prediction methods [72, 73] . Following the introduction of the principle of binding site druggability [74] , i.e. the potential of a cavity to accommodate drug-like small molecules leading to a modulation of protein function, different computational methods were developed for automated structurebased prediction of druggable binding sites [75] . VolSite initially calculates druggability scores for the binding sites of interest. If the score drops below a certain threshold the binding site is regarded as non-druggable. For non-druggable binding sites, no cavities are extracted for comparison purposes. Intriguingly, certain models of one solution NMR ensemble were predicted as druggable whereas others were predicted as non-druggable. This prevented the comparison for some binding site pairs (see failure rates in S10 Fig) . The previously described sensitivity of binding site comparison tools toward binding site definition and flexibility also holds true for druggability prediction. Most computational druggability prediction methods are trained based on binding site descriptors, e.g. the hydrophobicity, the number of hydrogen bond donor and acceptor atoms, and various geometric properties. These characteristics fluctuate highly within the NMR ensembles (S6 Table) .",

The question arises whether the algorithms analyzed are able to distinguish between pairs of similar binding sites and decoy structures containing several residue substitutions leading to different physicochemical and geometrical properties. Data set 1 provided the basis for these benchmark data sets. One structure from each group of structures with identical sequences was chosen and one to five residues were substituted by similarly sized residues with different physicochemical properties (decoy structures in data set 3) or by residues whose number of carbon and hetero atoms differs by at least three atoms (decoy structures in data set 4). For the different methodologies, we aimed at investigating whether pairs of binding sites with identical sequences are ranked high while pairs consisting of an original structure and a decoy structure receive lower rankings. For data set 3 (different physicochemical properties), decoy binding site variants with one, two, three, four, or five substitutions were generated (see Methods section for more details). Intriguingly, the methods SiteAlign, SMAP, SiteEngine, SiteHopper, and Shaper were significantly (S21 Table) superior to all interaction-based methods in terms of the AUC values. The early enrichment of active pairs is comparably high, although the high early enrichment of active pairs for SiteAlign is unique. The results for TM-align are explicable when considering that the method returns a score that is independent of the type of matched residues.

A color gradient was applied to highlight a prominent negative correlation (green), a correlation coefficient of -0.5 (yellow), and no correlation at all or a positive correlation (red). No cavities could be extracted for Cavbase and RAPMAD comparisons for decoy structures generated from the structure with the PDB ID 4ca7 (n.d.). and Grim which were outperformed by IsoMIF in the two previously discussed data sets. The same holds true for PocketMatch and ProBiS. In some cases, no correlation at all can be observed. The difficulties in the differentiation between original and decoy structures might arise from the isosteric substitutions which retain the overall binding site shape. We therefore created a second data set of decoy binding sites to evaluate the influence of cavity shape on the final outcome of this study. Randomly chosen residues were replaced by residues with a different shape (data set 4, see Methods section for details). The final outcome is depicted in Fig 7. A general trend in comparison to data set 3 is that most surface-based methods are characterized by a slightly better performance. This holds especially true for Shaper and VolSite/Shaper. The introduction of differently sized residues causes these improvements. In contrast, the performance of ProBiS and the interaction-based methods did not improve. Strikingly, the performance of SMAP is worse than for data set 3. This tool seems to be more sensitive toward the residues' chemical properties than toward shape. A plausible explanation is that SMAP models geometric binding site features based on the C\u03b1 coordinates which do not change upon the introduction of mutations. The superiority of SiteAlign compared to all other tools with respect to early enrichment is also pronounced for this data set. The poor correlation between score and number of substitutions observed for PocketMatch, ProBiS, Grim, IsoMIF, and TIFP did not improve despite the introduction of differently sized residues with modified chemical properties (Table 4 ).

No cavities could be extracted for Cavbase and RAPMAD comparisons for decoy structures generated from the structure with the PDB ID 4ca7 (n.d. In summary, a potential applicability domain of SiteAlign is the accurate evaluation of minor binding site differences. This can be of interest for polypharmacology studies and drug repurposing projects as well as for the evaluation of off-target effects. The same holds true for SMAP and SiteHopper although they show a lower early enrichment. These tools do not necessarily require structural ensembles as input as their sensitivity with respect to binding site flexibility is low. Therefore, no additional computational costs arise for the application of the methods. Methods which enable such accurate scoring measures might be suitable choices to post-process potential matches of similar binding sites obtained with the help of a faster, but less accurate binding site comparison tool.",

Consequently, the application of these tools might offer an opportunity to correlate ligand affinities with binding site similarities, e.g. for protein kinases [68, 77, 78] . A clear differentiation between minor dissimilarities is an essential necessity for such analyses and the abovementioned tools might be helpful to reliably rank binding sites according to their similarities. However, if a robust method is needed that should not be influenced by minor dissimilarities, one of the other tools should be used.

The authors screened the PDB for identical ligands, but included some pre-filtering steps: cofactors as well as ligands found in at least 15 complexes, with a molecular weight above 500 g/mol, or less than 10 non-hydrogen atoms were excluded. The resulting 62 pairs of protein-ligand complexes were classified and divided into three classes according to the similarities of ligand interactions: similar interactions of the ligands with similar protein functionalities (class A), similar interactions of the ligands with different protein functional groups (class B), and different functional groups of the ligands interacting with the proteins (class C). The calculation of per atom van der Waals and electrostatic interaction energies per ligand atom and their subsequent normalization enabled this detailed comparison of ligand-site interactions. Protein-ligand complexes of class A were used as active pairs in our analysis of all 62 binding site pairs. Due to the small number of protein pairs, EFs for 1.6%, 8.1%, 16.1%, 32.3%, 48.4%, 64.5%, and 80.6% of screened data set were calculated. The results are given in Fig 10. The ROC curves indicate a random ranking of active and inactive pairs for all methods analyzed herein. A significant differentiation between the tools' AUC values is only possible in a few cases (S25 Table) and the data set size precluded the decision for a suitable tool. The performance improvements using more appropriate scoring measures are also negligible for this data set.",

            "text": "Based on the per atom score analysis of Barelier et al. [64] , one might expect that the ligands nicely overlay for high scoring pairs of binding sites. The underlying binding site alignments of class A pairs were therefore analyzed for tools with a high early enrichment and enable the visualization of the underlying match (Cavbase, SMAP, TM-align, ProBiS, and VolSite/ Shaper). Fig 11 shows the binding site alignments for some high-scoring site pairs. The bestscored Cavbase match reflects an acceptable overlay of captopril bound to angiotensin-converting enzyme and leukotriene A4 hydrolase. The match between these binding sites was also the highest-scoring of all active pairs for TM-align. A good superposition of the bound identical ligands could be achieved. The second highest ranked true positive match yielded a superposition with poorly aligned ligands. The SMAP alignment of the class A pair with the highest score does not superpose the ligands in a satisfactory manner. Nevertheless, it is obvious that the tool was able to identify residue-based binding site similarities. A closer look shows that the residues taken into account for comparison are rather broadly distributed across the proteins providing a possible explanation for the unsatisfactory superposition. Only one significant (according to the expectation values) match was found by ProBiS for the binding sites of the abovementioned captopril binding proteins with a good agreement of the ligand atom positions in the alignment. Shaper-derived alignments also do not provide perfect alignments of ligand atoms for the best-scored hits, although ligand moieties with a similar physicochemical nature overlap. These results indicate that a visual inspection of the best ranked binding site pairs is a crucial step to assess the significance of the identified matches. Binding site similarity can only be a reasonable explanation for the binding of identical or similar ligands if the corresponding ligand atoms overlap in the superposition.",

A binding site analysis of the structures involved in the different similarity classes and druggable sites of a sequence-culled sc-PDB [65] subset led to the results presented in Fig 12. While the hydrophobicity and aromaticity of the binding sites in the benchmark set is higher than that for the sc-PDB [65] pockets, the number of hydrogen bond donor and acceptor atoms is lower. This underlines the finding that binding site similarity does not always imply a similar binding mode adopted by the ligands. For rather hydrophobic and aromatic ligands, multiple binding modes are possible irrespective of the underlying binding site alignment. Moreover, the generation of an accurate superposition is hampered by the fact that for highly hydrophobic binding sites a broad variety of acceptable cavity alignments can be obtained. We conclude that the generation of a similar data set-taking into account only druggable binding sites with a broad range of interaction types-might be more valuable in the evaluation of the performance of binding site comparison methods.",

The score thresholds to discriminate similar and dissimilar site pairs were determined using the ROC-based Youden's J statistic [85] based on data set 1 and data set 7. Both thresholds were applied for sensitivity and specificity calculations. The rank column gives the rank of the respective method within all methods for the corresponding sensitivity. Sensitivity and specificity values for thresholds that were assigned by the methods' developers are given in brackets. For SiteAlign, Shaper, VolSite/Shaper, and TIFP, the corresponding scoring measure is different from the one used in our study. calculated for the seven data sets shows that they have to be carefully chosen dependent on the anticipated outcome. Similarity scoring for binding sites is an ambitious undertaking (see benchmark studies for data set 1). The reliability of the similarity measures varies with binding site flexibility, bound ligands, and the binding site definition. The development of meaningful benchmark data sets is challenging which is due to the lack of knowledge of site-specific bioactivities and the sparseness of known protein-ligand complex structures with similar ligands. Unfortunately, meaningful cut-offs cannot be determined before having even more protein ligand complex structures and bioactivity data with binding site annotations. In line with other investigations concerning this topic [11, 43, 89] , we argue that these factors preclude the assignment of thresholds for a binary classification of similar and dissimilar binding site pairs. The discovery of unexplored site similarities. Finally, we asked the question: \"What are the similarities which most of the tools miss?\". To this end, the box plots for the different methods (S3-S5 Figs) were taken as a basis for the identification of \"difficult cavity pairs\". Active pairs with similarity or distance values in the range of dissimilar pairs for most methods were analyzed. The methods with the highest scores for these matches were applied to generate alignments of the pairs. Some of these are depicted in Fig 14. The general outcome of this analysis reveals the difficulties in finding similar pockets. The example in Fig 14A was first identified by the residue-based method Cavbase [35] . Intriguingly, a low Cavbase similarity score of 3.25 was assigned for this site pair in the present study. In contrast, the interaction-based method IsoMIF scored this pair highly and provided the presented site alignment. It is obvious that this match cannot be found by residue-based methods as the chemical nature of most aligned residues is different. Nevertheless, similarities were detected with respect to site interaction patterns. Site-Align was applied for the identification of the match between synapsin and PIM-1 kinase [41] . In contrast to the previous example, SiteAlign assigns a high score to the match and it can be found within the best-scored pairs. A high ranking for this cavity pair was also observed for the surface-based method SiteEngine. The alignment in Fig 14B illustrates why it is so difficult for many methods to identify this similarity. Although the atoms of both ligands align as expected, residue correspondences are difficult to find and only sub-parts of both pockets are similar. This final analysis underlines that it is impossible to identify a \"best-performing tool\". Some of the similar cavity pairs were within the best-scored hits for one, but not all tools. The results of two or more tools are often complementary. This holds especially true for binding sites sharing common interaction patterns or surface properties which are not evident on a residue-based level.",

Nevertheless, it is possible to differentiate between very fast methods (several microseconds per comparison), moderately fast methods (several milliseconds per comparison), and comparably slow methods (several seconds per comparison). Depending on the desired outcome and the size of the data set, the computational cost might be a limiting factor and the use of some methods becomes infeasible. For a comparison of a single binding site of interest against all known pockets as stored in the sc-PDB [65] (9,283 entries) on a single CPU, three days will be necessary using SiteAlign while PocketMatch will perform these comparisons within 0.28 seconds. For an all-against-all comparison, RAPMAD is approximately 9,200 times faster than the graph-based method Cavbase. In contrast, TIFP is only twice as fast as the graph-based method Grim. Such minor differences suggest the use of the better-performing method. The run time also depends on the type of comparisons. Pairwise comparisons were performed for Grim, IsoMIF, VolSite/Shaper, SiteAlign, SMAP, TIFP, and TM-align, i.e. the tool was invoked for each comparison separately. This might become the time-limiting step for some methods. Cavbase, FuzCav, PocketMatch, ProBiS, RAPMAD, SiteEngine, and Site-Hopper allow the comparison of one query against a list of targets in one run. This causes a speedup as the tool has to be invoked only once. For ProBiS, the conversion of PDB files to a surface file format is necessary. Thus the cavity preparation time reflects this preliminary step. Additionally, KRIPO and RAPMAD enable even faster comparisons by providing SQLite databases of the modeled sites and the automated calculation of similarity matrices. These factors illustrate the difficulty in analyzing and comparing run times. In this analysis, we chose the fastest option available for each tool. The computational cost will therefore differ depending on the tool's implementation and the type of approach employed (comparing distinct binding site pairs, query-based analyses, generation of distance matrices, etc.).",

            "text": "Plenty of factors influence the decision for a suitable binding site comparison tool. S13 Table  summarizes the tools' characteristics with respect to the most important criteria and provides a detailed assessment of the tools' performance. First of all, the necessary pre-processing of structures might have an impact on the choice. The preparation of large data sets, e.g. for the prediction of potential off-targets using all known binding sites, requires tools that enable an automated and flawless binding site processing and annotation. We divided this criterion into two parts. Firstly, it is important that binding sites can be prepared in an automated fashion. For example, the KRIPO developers generated scripts to automatically process the binding sites of interest. The same holds true for FuzCav, Grim, TIFP, Shaper, and VolSite/Shaper (although for some PDB structures ligand MOL2 templates have to be provided). Cavbase and RAPMAD require XML-formatted cavity descriptions as input which can be generated with the help of the CSD Python API [90] in an automated fashion. Secondly, the inclusion of all available binding sites might be crucial (S10 Fig). The prediction of potential off-targets and identification of novel binding sites require comprehensive cavity data sets. It is also vital that the chosen tools are reasonably fast with respect to such applications (run time). Sometimes, it is of interest to investigate the similarity between predicted binding sites and already known ones, e.g. for the identification of druggable binding sites of novel targets. Many interaction-based methods will not be able to compare predicted pockets (Grim, KRIPO, TIFP). SiteEngine will also fail as the tool relies on protein-and ligand-surface construction to compare the resulting sites' surfaces. Furthermore, SMAP does not provide the possibility to process detected binding sites. The only possibility is the generation of putative ligand binding modes via docking or pharmacophore searches to obtain structures with bound ligands for these methods. The tools Cavbase, FuzCav, RAPMAD, Shaper, and IsoMIF come along with implemented binding site identification approaches. Additionally, PocketMatch, ProBiS, SiteAlign, and TMalign process user-defined binding sites based on residues. Therefore, it is possible to apply them to externally predicted binding sites. SiteHopper was shown to compare predicted pockets as long as fpocket [91] -derived cavities are utilized as a pseudo-ligand [53] .",

If a clear classification of similar and dissimilar pairs is necessary, the appropriate cut-off has to be evaluated with a data set that reflects the main purpose of the analysis. Score thresholds for the decoy data sets (data set 3 and 4) should be taken into account if binding sites with minor dissimilarities are compared. In contrast to the elucidation of local binding site similarities or similarities of pockets of unrelated proteins, the less restrictive cut-offs determined for the data set of Kahraman and colleagues [63] or data set 7 are more appropriate. The methods SMAP and ProBiS offer additional statistical measures to estimate the significance of a binding site match.

Depending on the problem to be addressed, other criteria out of a multitude as given in S13 Table might also facilitate the choice. We strongly recommend this comprehensive table for further details. Nevertheless, we wanted to give an example for guiding the way to the most appropriate tool according to the criteria selected. FuzCav seems to fulfil all criteria in the Venn diagram and can be safely applied for evolutionary analyses. However, the binding site matches cannot be visualized. Hence, the method is not suited for querybased drug repurposing projects which require a detailed examination of the identified similarities. The use of KRIPO enables the generation of site alignments, but the method is not applicable for predicted sites and consequently not suited for function prediction. ProBiS failed to rank the similarity according to the number of residue substitutions and will probably fail to accurately score minor cavity dissimilarities. As this is decisive in the analysis of evolutionary binding site relationships, such scenarios should be analyzed with SiteAlign, SiteEngine, or SMAP. A potential user can thereby iteratively exclude tools to arrive at a final choice. Fig 15B puts all results into context and can be used to discuss possible application areas for the binding site analysis tools. The applicability suggestions for the different types of tools are based on previous studies illustrating different uses in drug discovery [5] . However, the diagram also hints at possible fields of applications yet unexploited, for example, the use of interactionbased methods for selectivity prediction or surface-based methods for target elucidation. Of course, the general aim of a study, the basis of data, and the number of comparisons necessary will influence the choice of a method. The embedding of a tool in an elaborate in silico workflow might serve to diminish certain weaknesses. Methods never applied to date for a certain field of research might provide useful results within specialized projects. Some obvious new applications are the use of interaction-based methods for the analysis of protein-protein and proteinligand interactions or drug repurposing approaches exploiting the outcome of surface-based site comparisons. The prediction of off-targets with comparably fast residue-based approaches is another unexplored application. Furthermore, some tools have never been applied in independent studies. Several projects which made use of Grim [97] , RAPMAD [98] , and SiteHopper [99] demonstrate their unique capabilities.

The impact of the ease and completeness of binding site pre-processing steps increases with an increasing number of proteins used for comparison. While both factors are crucial for elaborate projects, e.g. off-target prediction or the identification of novel binding sites, their importance decreases for relatively small data sets used in selectivity profiling or polypharmacology prediction. An application to predicted binding sites is relevant for off-target prediction, drug repurposing, or the identification of potential targets. For polypharmacology elucidation, one generally refers to known druggable binding sites. The analysis of similar binding sites to elucidate minor structural differences is highly influenced by the binding site's definition and flexibility, as is the ranking with respect to binding site properties. In contrast, the elucidation of similarities between the cavities of unrelated proteins does not necessarily depend on accurate scoring. MD simulations or the use of NMR ensembles might help to circumvent a potential failure of binding site comparison due to insufficient consideration of protein flexibility. It is necessary to unravel the similarity between functionally unrelated binding sites which bind similar ligands when understanding polypharmacology. Visualization of identified similarities, which is essential when dealing with non-obvious similarities, is not necessarily crucial for selectivity profiling or analyzing evolutionary relationships. These criteria should become the focus of future benchmark analyses of other promising site comparison approaches as such analyses can guide the rational choice of a method.",
