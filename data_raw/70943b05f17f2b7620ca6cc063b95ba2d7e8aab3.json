            "text": "Avian paramyxoviruses (APMV) serotypes 1-9 are frequently isolated from domestic and wild birds worldwide. APMV-1 (also called Newcastle disease virus, NDV) is attenuated in non-human primates and is being developed as a candidate human vaccine vector. The vector potential of the other serotypes was unknown. In the present study, we evaluated nine different biologically-or recombinantly-derived APMV strains for the ability to replicate and cause disease in rhesus macaque model. Five of the viruses were: biologically-derived wild type (wt) APMV-2, -3, -5, -7 and -9. Another virus was a recombinant (r) version of wt APMV-4. The remaining three viruses were versions of wt rAPMV-2, -4 and -7 in which the F cleavage site had been modified to be multi-basic. Rhesus macaques were inoculated intranasally and intratracheally and monitored for clinical disease, virus shedding from the upper and lower respiratory tract, and seroconversion. Virus shedding was not detected for wt APMV-5. Very limited shedding was detected for wt rAPMV-4 and modified rAPMV-4, and only in a subset of animals. Shedding by the other viruses was detected in every infected animal, and usually from both the upper and lower respiratory tract. In particular, shedding over a number of days in every animal was observed for modified rAPMV-2, wt APMV-7, and modified rAPMV-7. Modification of the F protein cleavage site appeared to increase shedding by wt rAPMV-2 and marginally by wt rAPMV-4. All APMVs except wt APMV-5 induced a virus-specific serum antibody response in all infected animals. None of the animals exhibited any clinical disease signs. These results indicate that APMVs 2, 3, 4, 7, and 9 are competent to infect non-human primates, but are moderately-to-highly restricted, depending on the serotype. This suggests that they are not likely to significantly infect primates in nature, and represent promising attenuated candidates for vector development.",

            "text": "The avian paramyxoviruses (APMVs) are isolated from wild and domestic birds all over the world. The APMVs have been divided into nine serotypes (APMV 1 to 9) based on hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and neuraminidase inhibition (NI) assays [1] . More recently, viruses representing potential APMV serotypes 10 and 11 were isolated from Rockhopper Penguins [2] and common teal [3] , respectively. APMV-1, which includes all strains of Newcastle disease virus (NDV), has been extensively characterized because virulent NDV strains cause severe disease in chickens. NDV strains are divided into three pathotypes based on their virulence in chickens: highly virulent (velogenic) strains cause severe respiratory and neurologic diseases; moderately virulent (mesogenic) strains cause milder disease, and nonpathogenic (lentogenic) strains cause inapparent infection. Mesogenic and lentogenic strains of NDV are highly restricted for replication and highly attenuated in non-avian species including primates, and are being developed as vaccine vectors for animal and human pathogens. Previous studies have shown that APMV serotypes 2-9 replicate not only in avian species, but also in mice and hamsters [4, 5] . However, their ability to replicate and possibly cause disease in primates, and their potential as human vaccine vectors, were unknown.",

            "text": "The APMVs belong to family Paramyxoviridae, a large and diverse family that includes viruses from a wide variety of mammalian, avian, reptilian, and fish species around the world [6] . Some members of the family are responsible for major human and animal diseases, while others cause inapparent infections. Paramyxoviruses are pleomorphic and enveloped and contain a non-segmented, negative-sense, single-stranded RNA genome of 13-19 kb. On the basis of virus structure, genome organization and sequence relatedness, the family Paramyxoviridae is divided in to two subfamilies: Paramyxovirinae and Pneumovirinae [6] . The subfam-ily Paramyxovirinae is divided into five genera: Respirovirus (including Sendai virus and human parainfluenza virus types 1 and 3), Rubulavirus (including parainfluenza virus 5 [previously known as simian virus type 5], mumps virus, and human parainfluenza virus types 2 and 4), Morbillivirus (including measles and canine distemper viruses), Henipavirus (comprising Hendra and Nipah viruses), and Avulavirus (comprising the APMVs). Subfamily Pneumovirinae contains two genera, Pneumovirus (including human and bovine respiratory syncytial viruses) and Metapneumovirus (comprising human metapneumovirus and the avian metapneumoviruses) [6, 7] Although a lot of information is available for APMV-1, much less is known about the molecular biology, pathogenicity and host range of the other APMV serotypes. As an initial step towards their characterization, we have recently determined the complete genome sequences of APMV-2 to -9 [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] and we have developed reverse genetics systems for APMV-2, -3, -4 and -7 [16] [17] [18] [19] . However, the biological characteristics and pathogenicity of APMV-2 to -9 remain poorly understood. APMV-2 has been associated with severe respiratory disease, reduced egg production and infertility in turkeys [20, 21] . APMV-3 has been associated with encephalitis and high mortality in caged birds, respiratory disease in turkeys and stunted growth in young chickens [22, 23] . APMV-4 strains have been isolated from chickens, ducks and geese [19] . APMV-5 causes disease in budgerigars that is characterized by depression, dyspnoea, diarrhea and high mortality [24] . APMV-6 and -7 cause mild respiratory disease in turkeys and are associated with a drop in egg production [25, 26] . APMV-8 and -9, isolated from ducks, waterfowl, and other wild birds, did not produce any clinical signs of viral infection in chickens [27, 28] In the last 10 years, reverse genetic techniques have made it possible to engineer NDV as a potential vaccine vector for both human and animal uses [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] . NDV vectors expressing a number of foreign antigens have been evaluated not only in avian hosts, but also in murine and nonhuman primate models [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [40] [41] [42] . Several strains of NDV have been shown to be highly restricted for replication in these mammalian models, indicating that they are highly attenuated due to a strong host range restriction and represent promising vaccine vectors. However, NDV strains are highly related antigenically, and therefore the use of NDV vectors for multiple purposes would be compromised by the induction of vector-specific immunity. This limitation might be overcome by using other APMV serotypes that are antigenically distinct from NDV as alternative vaccine vectors. In addition, it is possible that one or more of the other APMV serotypes might have other advantageous properties that cannot be predicted, such as increased immunogenicity compared to NDV. Furthermore, the possibility exists that one or more of the other APMV serotypes might be pathogenic in certain non-avian hosts including primates. For example, an APMV-2-like virus was previously recovered from a cynomolgus monkey with respiratory disease [43] , and an APMV-3-like virus was recovered from pigs [44] . Therefore, evaluation of APMV-2 to -9 in non-avian species was warranted.",

However, rodents are uncertain predictors of performance in other species such as humans because it is possible, and indeed likely, that there will be differences in the level of host range restriction between rodents and other species including primates. In the present study, we sought to evaluate the replication and pathogenicity of APMV-2, -3, -4, -5, -7 and -9 in rhesus macaques as a surrogate for humans. The viruses included biologically-and recombinantly-derived wt viruses as well as several recombinant viruses in which the F protein cleavage site had been modified to be multi-basic and to contain the optimal furin protease cleavage site motif RX(R/K)RQ (signature R and K residues underlined). This was done because the presence of a furin motif in the F protein cleavage site typically facilitates cleavage and is a major determinant of virulence for NDV strains [45, 46] , although this paradigm is uncertain for the other APMV serotypes [16, 18, 19] . The present study showed that, except for APMV-5, all of the APMVs under evaluation replicated at varying levels in rhesus macaques without inducing any apparent clinical disease signs. Thus, APMV serotypes 2, 3, 4, 7, and 9 are infectious, replication-competent and attenuated in non-human primates. In future work, the reverse genetics system for APMV-2, -4, and -7 will be used for the development of APMV vectored vaccines.",

Briefly, serial twofold dilutions of serum samples were prepared in 20 ml volumes of enzyme buffer (33 mM 2-N-morpholino ethanesulfonic acid [MES], pH 6.5, and 4 mM calcium chloride) in a 96-well plate. 20 ml APMV-5, diluted in enzyme buffer to a constant NA amount (an optical density at 450 nm [OD 450 ] of 100,000), was added as source of NA, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Ten microliters of 12.5% (vol/vol) dimethyl sulfoxide was added to each well of a fluorometric assay plate (black 96-well plates; Microfluor, Franklin, MA). Ten microliters of each serum and virus mixture was transferred in duplicate to the assay plate. 10 ml of diluted virus or enzyme buffer alone were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 30 ml of substrate mix [1 volume of 330 mM MES, pH 6.4; 3 volumes of 10 mM calcium chloride; and 2 volumes of 0.5 mM 29-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-a-D-N-acetylneuraminic acid (MUN) (Sigma)] to give a final concentration of 100 mM MUN in the assay. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37uC for 15 min with shaking, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of 150 ml of termination buffer (0.014 M sodium hydroxide in 83% [vol/vol] ethanol). The extent of the reaction was quantified by fluorometry at an excitation wavelength of 360 nm and an emission wavelength of 450 nm using the Victor3 multilabel plate reader (PerkinElmer). Readings from the substrate blanks were subtracted from the virus sample readings. The average background-corrected NA activity was calculated from 12 independent wells.

Among the nine established serotypes, APMV-1 (NDV) is the most extensively characterized due to its importance as a major pathogen of poultry. APMV serotypes 2 to 9 are frequently isolated from both domestic and wild birds, but have been largely uncharacterized until recently. NDV has been shown to infect not only avian species but also nonavian species, although its replication is restricted in non-avian hosts [29, 30] . NDV is being developed as promising viral vaccine vector for delivery of a number of antigens of animal and human pathogens [51] . However, the potential of APMV-2 to -9 as vaccine vectors for humans was not known. Previously, we demonstrated the replication of APMV-2 to -9 in hamsters and mice [4, 5] . However, low phylogenetic and anatomic relatedness between the rodent models and humans necessitate the use of more relevant models for assessment of replication and pathogenicity of APMV-2 to -9.",

            "text": "In this study, we chose to evaluate nine different APMV strains. Six of these were wt viruses representing six different serotypes, specifically biologically-derived wt APMV -2, -3, -5, -7, and -9, as well as a recombinant version of wt APMV-4. We chose wt APMV-2, -5, -7 and wt rAPMV-4 because we previously showed that replication of these viruses in cell culture does not require, and is not enhanced by, exogenous protease supplementation [8, 11, 13, 19] . Since this property is known to correlate with pantropic replication and virulence by NDV in chickens, it was possible that it might confer increased replication of these non-NDV APMVs in the rhesus macaques, although we note that this NDV paradigm had not been consistent for these non-NDV APMVs in chickens [16, 18, 19] . Wt APMV-3 was selected because this virus replicates to high titer in cell culture and a reverse genetics system has been developed for this serotype [9, 17] . Wt APMV-9 was selected because this virus replicates well in nasal turbinate and lungs of mice and hamsters [4, 5] . The other three viruses evaluated in this study were recombinant versions of APMV-2, -4, and -7 in which the naturally-occurring F protein cleavage sites were replaced by multi-basic cleavage sites containing the optimal furin motif. Specifically, rAPMV-2 (type 1 Africa) contained the multi-basic cleavage site RRRRRQF that is present in a virulent African NDV strain; rAPMV-4/Fc-BC contained the cleavage site RRQKRQF derived from the mesogenic NDV strain Baudette C; and rAPMV-7/Fcs-5B contained the cleavage site RRKKRQF derived from the velogenic NDV strain Nigeria/95. As noted, in NDV, multi-basic cleavage sites generally are associated with greater virulence in chickens. Rhesus macaques infected with APMV-2, -3, -4, -5, -7 and -9 showed no signs of any disease. APMV-2, -3, -7, and -9 replicated to low titers in upper respiratory tract as evidenced by low level of shedding of these viruses in nasal washes of animals from day 1 to 7. APMV-4 and -5 were found negative for shedding from upper respiratory tract. Similarly, we previously showed that rhesus macaques or African green monkeys that were infected by the combined intranasal and intratracheal routes with NDV strain BC were mostly negative for viral shedding [29] . Together, these results indicate that APMVs are highly restricted in replication in the upper respiratory tract of monkeys. However, analysis of BAL samples in the present study revealed replication of all these APMVs except wt APMV-5 in lower respiratory tract until day 6 post infection, although at different levels. The magnitude of shedding of wt APMV-2, rAPMV-2 (type 1 Africa), wt APMV-3, wt APMV-7, and rAPMV-7/Fcs-5B was moderate, while in case of wt APMV-9, wt rAPMV-4, and rAPMV-4/Fc-BC it was low. In contrast, a very low level of shedding (as determined by plaque assay of tracheal lavages or samples of lung tissues) was detected from lower respiratory tract of AGMs infected with NDV in earlier studies [29] . This indicates that, compared to NDV, wt and recombinant APMV-2 and 7, and wt APMV-3 replicate more efficiently in the lower respiratory tract in non-human primates. This apparent increased replication may provide an advantageous increase in immunogenicity for an expressed foreign antigen. Despite the somewhat greater replication of certain APMVs in the respiratory tract, analysis of fecal samples of rhesus macaques infected with all these APMVs revealed no shedding, suggesting a lack of spread to the gastrointestinal tract. These observations suggest that like NDV, APMV-2, -3, -4,-7 and -9 are highly restricted and highly attenuated in non-human primates.",

One possible explanation is that there might be a lower density of APMV receptors in the upper respiratory tract of non-human primates compared to lower respiratory tract, and hence a lower level of replication. A second possible factor is that birds have a higher body temperature compared to primates. Therefore, both the upper and lower respiratory tract of primates may be suboptimal for APMV replication, and this effect would be more pronounced in the upper respiratory tract due to its relatively lower temperature. The low level of shedding of APMVs from upper respiratory tract of non-human primates predicts that shedding also should be reduced from humans, which would limit release into the environment and would be a desirable feature for a vaccine vector.",

The introduction of the multi-basic sites also increased virus replication in vitro -by 10-fold [16, 18, 19] in the case of rAPMV-2 (type 1 Africa) and rAPMV-7/Fcs-5B, and by 500-to 5000-fold in the case of rAPMV-4/Fc-BC. However, there was no observed difference in replication or pathogenicity in chickens [16, 18, 19] . For the purpose of developing APMV vaccine vectors for possible human use, these mutations had at least two potential advantages. First, the increased growth in vitro would facilitate vaccine manufacture. Second, the cleavage site mutations might increase vector replication in primates, in which case a modest increase in replication might increase the immunogenicity of an expressed foreign antigen while retaining the attenuation phenotype. In the present study, the introduction of the multi-basic sites were associated with an apparent increase in replication in the case of *This is continuation of the experiment described in Tables\u00f4 2 and 3.

All the values are averages from three independent experiments. The mean serum HI titers in all the day 0 serum samples were 0. The serum neutralizing antibody titers were expressed as mean reciprocal log 2 of the serum dilution resulting in complete neutralization of infection in 50% of the wells (mean 6 standard errors of the mean). The limit of detection is 0. The mean neutralizing antibody titers in all the day 0 serum samples were 0. 1 The antibody response to APMV-5 was evaluated by NI assay as described in Materials and Methods. The NI titer is expressed as the mean reciprocal log 2 (6 standard errors of the mean) of the highest serum dilution causing neuraminidase inhibition. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0075456.t004 Figure 1 . Analysis of the reactivity of sera from rhesus macaques collected following infection with the indicated APMVs, evaluated by Western blotting against purified virus of the homologous APMV strain. Virus representing each of the indicated APMV strains was rAPMV-2 (type 1 Africa), and possibly a marginal increase in the case of rAPMV-4/Fc-BC, and an apparent decrease in replication in the case of rAPMV-7/Fcs-5B. With respect to the absence of clinical disease, the mutants remained as attenuated as their wt parents. However, a larger study would be required to confirm these preliminary observations. A single inoculation via combined intranasal and intratracheal routes in rhesus macaques with wt APMV-2, wt APMV-3, wt APMV-7, rAPMV-7/Fcs-5B and wt APMV-9 induced substantial HI antibody titer, whereas serum HI antibody responses induced by rAPMV-2 (type 1 Africa), wt rAPMV-4, rAPMV-4/Fc-BC, and wt APMV-5 was low. The HI titers correlated either completely or partially with the level of shedding from the lower respiratory tract except in the case of wt APMV-5, for which no shedding was observed but a low level of NI titer was produced. To date, APMV-5 has only been isolated from budgerigars, which are thought to be its natural host [24] . These observations indicated that this virus probably is strongly host restricted.",

In the cases of wt APMV-3, rAPMV-4, rAPMV-4/Fc-BC, and wt APMV-9, the neutralization titers were higher compared to the HI titers, whereas the converse was true for the remaining APMVs. Since HI titers reflect antibodies specific for the attachment site of HN whereas neutralizing antibodies reflect broader antibody responses against antigenic sites throughout the HN and F proteins, the instances of relatively higher neutralizing titers might reflect a disproportionately greater contribution from additional epitopes in the HN and F proteins.",

These serotypes are thus candidates for further development as vaccines for human use. In the cases of wt rAPMV-4, rAPMV-4/Fc-BC, and wt APMV-5 (where not all of the monkeys seroconverted) and rAPMV-2 (type 1 Africa), the HI antibody titers were lower than that induced by NDV in a previous study [52] , suggesting that these serotypes are less promising. One incongruity in the present study is the low titers of HI antibodies, and lack of detectable neutralizing antibodies, induced by rAPMV-2 (type 1 Africa) despite the relatively robust replication of this vector and compared to the greater immunogenicity of its wt APMV-2 parent despite the lower replication of the parent.",
