Pattern formation in activator-inhibitor systems has been studied in networks, revealing differences from the classical continuous media. Here we study pattern formation in a new framework, namely multiplex networks. These are systems where activator and inhibitor species occupy separate nodes in different layers. Species react across layers but diffuse only within their own layer of distinct network topology. This multiplicity generates heterogeneous patterns with significant differences from those observed in single-layer networks. Remarkably, diffusion-induced instability can occur even if the two species have the same mobility rates; condition which can never destabilize single-layer networks. The instability condition is revealed using perturbation theory and expressed by a combination of degrees in the different layers. Our theory demonstrates that the existence of such topology-driven instabilities is generic in multiplex networks, providing a new mechanism of pattern formation.",

Such media are often described by reaction-diffusion systems and consist of elements obeying an activator-inhibitor dynamics with local coupling. In his pioneering paper 1 , Turing showed that a uniform steady state can be spontaneously destabilized, leading to a spontaneous formation of a periodic spatial pattern, when reacting species diffuse with different mobilities. It was later proposed by Gierer and Meinhardt 4 that an activator-inhibitor chemical reaction is a typical example achieving Turing's scenario. Turing instability is a classical mechanism of self-organization far from equilibrium, and plays an important role in biological morphogenesis. It has been extensively studied in biological 4-6 and chemical 7 systems, as well as real ecosystems 8, 9 .",

Condition (3) implies that a sufficiently large value of \u03c3 (v) brings about instability, in the same manner as the Turing instability. However, an alternative scenario of the instability is revealed by equation (3). This can happen by increasing k (v) , even if the mobilities are equal (\u03c3 (u) = \u03c3 (v) ). This instability occurs in a strikingly different regime from classical Turing instabilities. Figure 2a shows the linear stability of system (1)-(2) for varying k (v) , holding k (u) fixed. We clearly see that the uniform steady state is always a solution of the multiplex system. It is linearly stable (green line) for small values of k (v) . But at some critical value of k (v) which satisfies equation (3), the system undergoes a transcritical bifurcation (red point) and becomes unstable (magenta line). Two new branches of solutions arise from the transcritical bifurcation. The unstable branch (magenta line) undergoes a second bifurcation (blue point), this time a saddle-node, giving rise to a new branch of stable solutions (green line) different from the uniform steady state. Figure 2b shows the transcritical (red line) and the saddle-node bifurcation (blue line) in the k (v) -k (u) plane. The curve of the transcritical bifurcation is given by equation (3), while the curve of the saddle-node bifurcation has been derived by numerical continuation. One can see from equation (3) that by increasing k (v) , the boundary curve (red line) asymptotically approaches k (u) = f u /\u03c3 (u) . This indicates that the instability can be observed if a node has sufficiently large k (v) , while its cunterpart has degree k (u) less than the value mentioned above. This fact reveals an important difference from the classical Turing instability, which always takes place by increasing \u03c3 (v) irrespective of \u03c3 (u) 26 .",

In ecological multiplex networks, for example, pairs of nodes might represent separate habitat patches which communicate through dispersal connections. However, prey and predators may use different connections (such as forest paths, rivers and tributaries or various transportation systems) to move among the fragmented habitats. Often, predators have more choices to move; in our representation their layer is more densely connected than the prey's layer. This is exactly the sort of situation that favors the Turing-like instability and the subsequent establishment of Turing patterns. Considering that self-organized patterns can be found in real ecosystems 8, 9 it is possible that such patterns can also be observed in natural ecological systems for which the multiplex structure is innate.",
