The domestic cat, the definitive host species with the largest worldwide population, has become evolutionarily and epidemiologically the most important host of T. gondii. The outcome of T. gondii infection is influenced by congenital and acquired host characteristics. We detected differences in T. gondii seroprevalence by cat breed in our previous studies. The aims of this study were to estimate T. gondii seroprevalence in selected domestic cat breeds, and to evaluate whether being of a certain breed is associated with T. gondii seropositivity, when the age and lifestyle of the cat are taken into account. The studied breeds were the Birman, British Shorthair, Burmese, Korat, Norwegian Forest Cat, Ocicat, Persian, and Siamese. Plasma samples were analyzed for the presence of immunoglobulin G antibodies against T. gondii with a commercial direct agglutination test at dilution 1:40. The samples were accompanied by owner-completed questionnaires that provided background data on the cats. Overall, 41.12% of the 1121 cats tested seropositive, and the seroprevalence increased with age. The Burmese had the lowest seroprevalence (18.82%) and the Persian had the highest (60.00%). According to the final multivariable logistic regression model, the odds to test seropositive were four to seven times higher in Birmans, Ocicats, Norwegian Forest Cats, and Persians when compared with the Burmese, while older age and receiving raw meat were also risk factors for T. gondii seropositivity. This study showed that T. gondii seroprevalence varies by cat breed and identified being of certain breeds, older age, and receiving raw meat as risk factors for seropositivity.",

The method has not been validated for analysis of feline samples, but it has been used for detecting antibodies against T. gondii in cats in several studies [1, 24, 25] . In this method, possible immunoglobulin M antibodies are denatured by 2-mercaptoethanol. The samples were diluted 1:40, and samples that tested positive were defined as seropositive. All plates contained the positive and negative controls provided with the kit in two dilutions (1:40 and 1:4000), and antigen control. We read the results after 18 hours of incubation.

A similar proportion of kittens was included in this study as in the Finnish study [24] , whereas the larger proportion of kittens included in this study than in the Estonian study [25] could partly explain that difference. All these estimates of seroprevalence are conservative and likely underestimate T. gondii infection prevalence, because the method used is indirect and detects only immunoglobulin G antibodies. Recently infected cats have not produced these antibodies yet and appear seronegative. Moreover, using a single dilution, we expected few cats with high antibody titers to test seronegative because of the prozone phenomenon [24] .",

            "text": "The Finnish feline biobank, which was utilized in this study, is based on voluntary contributions. The cat owners who had contributed to the biobank might keep their cats differently than cat owners who did not participate. Moreover, cats that are difficult to handle at a veterinary clinic may be less likely to be sampled. Thus, the results of this study may represent mainly co-operative cats whose owners were interested in participating in the feline biobank effort. In addition, different types of owners might be more likely to choose cats of particular breeds, which can influence the lifestyle of cats of a certain breed. The background information for the cats was reported by the owners, and there may be recall bias. How cats are kept varies around the world, and T. gondii infection pressure varies between and within countries. In Finland, a geographical north-south gradient in T. gondii seroprevalence has been described in Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) [27] , and in moose (Alces alces) and domestic sheep (Ovis aries) [28] . The lynxes that originated from the south-west of Finland had a significantly higher T. gondii seroprevalence than the lynxes from north-east [27] . Similarly, the seroprevalence in moose and sheep was higher in south-western and lower in northern parts of Finland [28] . It is unknown whether the gradient in T. gondii prevalence is present also in small prey that domestic cats that are allowed to hunt could catch, but the seroprevalence in cats living near the capital city, located in the south, was similar to that in cats from other parts of the country [24] . For each cat included in this study, in addition to breed, we had data on the known major risk factors for T. gondii seropositivity: age, whether the cat was receiving raw meat, and whether the cat had outdoor access. Because the infection is usually acquired and seroprevalence increases with age (as shown also in this study), these risk factors were relevant to include in the analyses. In particular, raw meat given to the cats by the owners is a major lifestyle risk factor for T. gondii seropositivity in Finland [24] . In this study, in addition to the breed of the cat, the age of the cat and whether it was receiving raw meat were statistically significant variables in the final multivariable model for T. gondii seropositivity. The type and origin of the raw meat given to the cats were, unfortunately, unknown.",

Mammals, including humans, and birds can acquire T. gondii infection by ingesting sporulated oocysts, which have been shed in unsporulated form by infected felids. The only wild felid living in Finland is the Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx), which has not been shown to shed T. gondii oocysts [27] . The domestic cat is considered to be the most important host species of T. gondii evolutionarily and also epidemiologically for example in regions where domestic cats outnumber the other definitive hosts [2, 24, 27] . Most seropositive cats are considered to have previously shed oocysts in their feces [1] . From serology results, we can thus retrospectively conclude that a high proportion of cats of a breed with high T. gondii seroprevalence has shed T. gondii oocysts, while the proportional potential contribution to the environmental oocyst contamination by cats of a breed with lower seroprevalence has been smaller. It is unknown whether shedding of T. gondii oocysts (length of the shedding period, number of oocysts shed) differs by domestic cat breed.",
