The objective of our study was to assess the significance of HCoVs in the etiology of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) in children <6 years of age. Methods: Stool samples and nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs collected from 260 children hospitalized for AGE (160 also had respiratory symptoms) and 157 otherwise healthy control children admitted for elective surgery were tested for the presence of four HCoVs using real time RT-PCR. Registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (reg. NCT00987519). Results: HCoVs were more frequent in patients with AGE than in controls (23/260, 8.8% versus 4/151, 2.6%; odds ratio, OR 3.3; 95% confidence interval, CI 1.3-10.0; P = 0.01). Three of four HCoV-positive members in the control group, asymptomatic when sampled, recalled gastrointestinal or respiratory symptoms within the previous 14 days. In patients with AGE, HCoVs were present in NP samples more often than in stools (22/256, 8.6%, versus 6/ 260, 2.3%; P = 0.0004). In 5/6 children with HCoVs detected in stools, the viruses were also detected in NP swabs. Patients had a significantly higher probability of HCoV detection in stool (OR 4; 95% CI 1.4-15.3; P = 0.006) and also in stool and/or NP (OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.3-10.0; P = 0.01) than healthy controls. All four HCoVs species were detected in stool and NP samples. Conclusions: Although HCoVs were more frequently detected in patients with AGE than in the control group, high prevalence of HCoVs in NP swabs compounded by their low occurrence in stool samples and detection of other viruses in stool samples, indicate that HCoVs probably play only a minor role in causing gastrointestinal illness in children <6 years old.",

            "text": "Human coronaviruses (HCoVs), known since the late 1960s, have been recognized as a frequent cause of mild respiratory tract infections (RTIs) and occasionally as a potential cause of severe lower RTI in premature infants and children with underlying diseases [1] . Their role in enteric infections is less clear. Even though coronavirus-like particles have been seen by electron microscopy in stool samples from patients with diarrhea, they have been also found in healthy individuals [2] . However, coronaviruses are associated with diarrheal disease in several animal species. Thus, a dual enteric and respiratory tropism has been reported for the bovine coronavirus causing winter dysentery in calves [3] . Interest in coronaviruses in relation to enteric diseases in humans increased with the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and identification of SARS-CoV in 2003 [4, 5] . SARS was characterized clinically by signs/ symptoms of severe lower RTI but several patients also had gastrointestinal complaints [6, 7] . Diarrhea has also been a prominent clinical feature in several patients with respiratory infection caused by other HCoVs [8] [9] [10] . Furthermore, all HCoV species were recently detected in stool samples of patients with acute gastroenteritis (AGE) by modern molecular methods, but their role in human gastrointestinal infections remains uncertain [11] [12] [13] . In previous studies, HCoVs were demonstrated in patients with gastrointestinal and/or respiratory involvement, but in none of these studies was concurrent collection of stool and respiratory samples performed. The main objective of the present study was to evaluate the presence of HCoVs in simultaneously collected stool samples and nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs in children with AGE (with or without associated respiratory symptoms) and in control subjects, with the aim of appraising their role in the etiology of AGE.",

In the present study we assessed the significance of HCoVs in the etiology of AGE in children <6 years old by testing samples from stools and NP swabs for the presence of four HCoVs by RT-PCR. In the patients with AGE, follow-up sampling was performed 14 days after the initial testing and we acquired detailed clinical information for each participant. Our study revealed that HCoVs were present in patients with AGE and that viruses were more prevalent in the patients than in the control group (23/260, 8.8% versus 4/151, 2.6%, OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.3-10.0%, P = 0.01). Moreover, the higher probability of HCoV detection in the stool samples of patients with AGE than among controls (OR 4; 95% CI 1.4-15.3; P = 0.006) indicated a causal association of HCoVs with AGE. This was supported by the observation that three of four HCoV-positive members of the control group, who were asymptomatic at the time of sampling, reported symptoms within a 14day period before sampling. However, in patients with AGE one would think that the etiologic agent is more likely to be demonstrated predominantly in stool samples, whereas in our study HCoVs were detected more often in NP swabs than in stools (22/256, 8 .6% versus 6/ 260, 2.3%; P = 0.0004). In addition, in five of six children with HCoVs detected in the stool samples, the viruses were also demonstrated in NP swabs. There are several partial explanations for this. The course of the events in HCoVs infection might have been similar to those known to be operative in animals and as suggested for SARS-CoV [6, 14] . Thus, fecal-oral transmission is followed by intestinal damage, leading to viremia and respiratory infection. However, we tested all patients with HCoVs found in stool samples or NP swabs for the presence of the viruses in blood but did not get any positive result. In addition, viremia usually results in the involvement of the lower RTI whereas upper RTI is usually the result of direct spread of infection through neighboring tissues. Although we cannot exclude viremia that was missed in our patients, it seems more likely that HCoVs did not cause viremia. The other possibility is that oral transmission of HCoVs is followed by gastrointestinal infection in patients with AGE and in the majority of children by symptomatic or asymptomatic NP infections because of the direct spread of viruses from the oral cavity to the nasopharynx, or secondarily from the gastrointestinal region from vomiting (69.6% of our children experienced vomiting in addition to diarrhea). Because enveloped HCoVs viruses are not stable in stools, their persistence is much more limited and transient than in the upper respiratory tract. This could explain the lower detection rate of HCoVs in stools than in NP swabs. The third possibility is that the primary location of HCoVs replication is in the nasopharynx, resulting in asymptomatic or symptomatic respiratory infections, and that the HCoVs occasionally found in stool samples had their origin in the respiratory system but were passed down the alimentary tract. This theory would enable an elegant explanation for the higher proportion of NP swabs positive for HCoVs than in stools and for the finding that all but one patient with HCoVs in the stool samples also had them present in NP swabs, but does not explain AGE, which should have been caused by other agent. The theory is further supported by the finding that only in two children HCoVs were found as a sole viral agent in stool while in four cases the presence of other viruses known to cause AGE was also established. Surprisingly, HCoVs were detected as a single viral pathogen in 8/9 (88.9%) NP swabs from children with AGE without concomitant respiratory symptoms.",

Stool specimens, NP swabs and blood samples were obtained at admission and at a followup visit 14 days after the initial sampling. Children in the same age group admitted to the Department of Pediatric Surgery and Intensive Care for planned elective surgical procedures (i.e. inguinal hernia repair, testicular retention or hydrocele) were selected as a healthy control group. Only children without infections in last four weeks preceding the surgery were eligible for surgery admission. All children were clinically examined and only those without any symptoms of infection were admitted. Approximately one third of the admitted children have not been included due to parents' refusal of entering the study or due to logistical problems with sample collection. In this group, stool samples and NP swabs were collected at admission. At this time, information was obtained on the presence of signs and symptoms compatible with gastrointestinal and/ or respiratory infection within the last 14 days. To minimize children's discomfort nasopharyngeal sampling was performed after patients underwent anesthesia.",
