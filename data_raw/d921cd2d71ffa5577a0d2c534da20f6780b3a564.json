            "text": "The genome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causal organism of tuberculosis (TB), encodes a unique protein family known as the PE/PPE/PGRS family, present exclusively in the genus Mycobacterium and nowhere else in the living kingdom, with largely unexplored functions. We describe the functional significance of the PGRS domain of Rv0297, a member of this family. In silico analyses revealed the presence of intrinsically disordered stretches and putative endoplasmic reticulum (ER) localization signals in the PGRS domain of Rv0297 (Rv0297PGRS). The PGRS domain aids in ER localization, which was shown by infecting macrophage cells with M. tuberculosis and by overexpressing the protein by transfection in macrophage cells followed by activation of the unfolded protein response, as evident from increased expression of GRP78/GRP94 and CHOP/ATF4, leading to disruption of intracellular Ca 2\u03e9 homeostasis and increased nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The consequent activation of the effector caspase-8 resulted in apoptosis of macrophages, which was Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) dependent. Administration of recombinant Rv0297PGRS (rRv0297PGRS) also exhibited similar effects. These results implicate a hitherto-unknown role of the PGRS domain of the PE_PGRS protein family in ER stress-mediated cell death through TLR4. Since this protein is already known to be present at later stages of infection in human granulomas it points to the possibility of it being employed by M. tuberculosis for its dissemination via an apoptotic mechanism. IMPORTANCE Apoptosis is generally thought to be a defense mechanism in protecting the host against Mycobacterium tuberculosis in early stages of infection. However, apoptosis during later stages in lung granulomas may favor the bacterium in disseminating the disease. ER stress has been found to induce apoptosis in TB granulomas, in zones where apoptotic macrophages accumulate in mice and humans. In this study, we report ER stress-mediated apoptosis of host cells by the Rv0297encoded PE_PGRS5 protein of M. tuberculosis exceptionally present in the pathogenic Mycobacterium genus. The PGRS domain of Rv0297 aids the protein in localizing to the ER and induces the unfolded protein response followed by apoptosis of macrophages. The effect of the Rv0297PGRS domain was found to be TLR4 depen-",

One-third of the world's population is estimated to be latently infected with M. tuberculosis.

            "text": "Approximately 10% of the coding capacity of the M. tuberculosis genome is dedicated to the PE and PPE gene family members, so termed due to the occurrence of PE and PPE domains close to the N-terminal region (3) (4) (5) . This family is present exclusively in the genus Mycobacterium and nowhere else in the living kingdom (4) . Various PE/PPE proteins of M. tuberculosis have been reported to be expressed upon infection of macrophages and play crucial roles in virulence, antigenic diversity, and modulation of the host immune response (6) (7) (8) . Numerous members of the PE gene family display several copies of polymorphic guanine-cytosine-rich sequences (PGRSs) at their C-terminal ends in the so-called PE_PGRS subfamily (9) . In the past decade, there has been a growing interest in determining the role of PE_PGRS proteins in the pathophysiology of TB due to their limited presence in nonpathogenic mycobacteria (10) . Various members of the PE_PGRS family stimulate strong T-cell responses and immune quorum sensing (3, 11) . The PGRS domain of M. tuberculosis PE_PGRS33 (Rv1818c) is responsible for inducing humoral as well as cellular immune responses in humans, and there is also evidence for the presence of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I)-restricted CD8 \u03e9 T cells in mice, suggesting their highly immunogenic nature (12, 13) . Mutations in the homologs of PE_PGRS62 and PE_PGRS30 in Mycobacterium marinum resulted in reduced persistence of these bacteria in granulomas (14) . In addition, the Wag22 PE_PGRS antigen-mediated immune response was found to be involved in sustaining latent infection in a mouse model of chronic M. tuberculosis infection (15) . PE_PGRS proteins have also been found at the cell surface of M. tuberculosis and found to affect its cell surface interactions (16) . Their association with the cell wall and surface exposure also leads to trafficking of these proteins out of the mycobacterial phagosome into endocytic compartments. Few of the PE_PGRS proteins are exocytosed into the extracellular environment (17) . Localization of Rv1818c to mitochondria resulted in induction of cell death (18) and was also shown to be involved in enhanced survival of Mycobacterium smegmatis in macrophages (11) .",

This study was designed to delineate the mechanism of action of Rv0297 on host cell death, particularly the role of its PGRS domain alone or in fusion with the PE domain.

Having shown the ability of the PGRS domain to mediate ER localization, we then considered the functional consequences of such targeting. To begin with, we determined the effects of the accumulation of the Rv0297PGRS domain alone or in combination with other PE domains on host cell functions. Given the association of the ER with the UPR, the levels of UPR pathway proteins, such as GRP78 and GRP94, were investigated. We simultaneously explored the levels of ATF4 (28) and CHOP (29), well-known ER stress markers. These transcription regulators target genes that are involved in host cell apoptosis (30) . Immunoblotting studies clearly showed the overexpression of GRP78/GRP94 and ATF4/CHOP, compared to the PE control, in cells transfected with the Rv0297PGRS domain alone or in combination with other PE domains ( Fig. 1B and C) . Transfection with the Rv0297PGRS domain alone or the full-length protein in murine macrophages, as opposed to the PE domain, induced overexpression of GRP78 and GRP94 ( Fig. 1B and C, compare lanes 5 and 6 with lane 4) as evident from immunoblotting. A construct carrying the Rv0297PGRS domain fused with Rv1788PE protein ( Fig. 1B and C, lane 2) and the Rv0297PGRS domain fused with the Rv1818cPE domain ( Fig. 1B and C, lane 8) was able to induce the overexpression of these ER-specific chaperones/stress markers compared to their respective native proteins. These results were also verified by densitometric analysis (Fig. S6 ).

Extending the above results, we measured the levels of Ca 2\u03e9 ion release from the ER, in cells transfected with various constructs.

These results demonstrated that induction of apoptosis by Rv0297PGRS is facilitated by classical caspase-8-dependent pathways, similarly to Rv1818c-mediated apoptosis (36) .",

Few of the PE_PGRS proteins of M. tuberculosis were known to interact with TLRs, mainly the TLR2 type.

In order to decipher the biological effects of localization within the ER of the host cells, we investigated the ER stress pathways in cells harboring various domains of Rv0297 as well as another PE protein (Rv1788) and PE_PGRS protein (Rv1818c). Our results show that the Rv0297 PGRS domain is involved in ER stress. Notably, it has been shown that when stress is excessively high, the UPR pathway shifts from a prosurvival to a prodeath mode (42) . GRP78 and GRP94 are well-established ER chaperone molecules which have a crucial role in maintaining cell viability under numerous cell stresses (43) . Under pathological conditions, altered levels of ATF4 and CHOP-crucial proteins expressed during ER stress-induced apoptosis-have been shown (22) . Using GRP94, GRP78, ATF4, and CHOP as standard UPR markers for ER stress, we showed upregulation of these markers as a consequence of Rv0297PGRS domain expression in macrophages. Together, these data suggest that, in later stages of M. tuberculosis infection, the ER stress sensors might be upregulated for induction of apoptosis as a reaction to M. tuberculosis infection. Disruption of Ca 2\u03e9 homeostasis is a contributing element of ER stress. We therefore also investigated the possible involvement of the Rv0297PGRS-mediated Ca 2\u03e9 ion release in ER stress in RAW 264.7 cells. The levels of intracellular Ca 2\u03e9 ions in RAW 264.7 cells were shown to be elevated using a fluorescent Ca 2\u03e9 indicator. ROS and NO generation represent essential mechanisms invoked by macrophages to control M. tuberculosis (44) . These antimicrobial species play a critical role in controlling intracel-lular bacteria. Interestingly, ER stress pathways are also induced by ROS or NO (45) . Our results indicate that Rv0297PGRS induces both NO and ROS production in RAW 264.7 cells. We also showed that ectopic expression of the PGRS domain affects the levels of caspase-8, an effector caspase usually activated by the extrinsic apoptotic pathway (46) . Caspase-8 and caspase-3 are the key caspases involved in ER stress-mediated apoptosis (47) .",

An increased disordered region present in Rv0297PGRS might be responsible for differences in organelle localization and function from Rv1818cPGRS. Fusion of Rv0297PGRS with other PE domains allowed them to be targeted to the ER. Protein sequence alignment revealed some extra sequences in the Rv0297PGRS domain, possibly containing motifs responsible for ER localization. Rv1818c, a well-characterized protein known to be localized to mitochondria, while sharing some common motifs apparently lacks a few of them (see Table S3 in the supplemental material). While some ER signal sequences are present in Rv0297PGRS, we were unable to identify the precise signature motifs which enable exclusive targeting to the ER. It is presumable that these sequences might not be responsible for organelle-specific targeting but could be responsible for organelle targeting generically. Furthermore, some of these signals might be responsible for retention of Rv0297PGRS in the host ER, leading to generation of the stress response and induction of caspase-8-mediated apoptosis.",

Recently, it was demonstrated that PE_PGRS30 is required for virulence, as its deletion from M. tuberculosis compromised its capacity to colonize in lung tissue and hampered tissue damage. The inactivation of the gene also leads to inhibition of phagolysosome fusion in macrophages (50) . Similarly, M. tuberculosis PE_PGRS17 promotes the death of host macrophages as well as increases in the secretion of the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u2423) (51) .

The ER stress pathway was initially recognized as a cellular mechanism activated by the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER to maintain proper ER functions. In addition, ER stress pathways are also involved in protection of cells by several other cellular stresses. However, when stress reaches a critical level, apoptosis is induced to eliminate injured cells (54) . In later stages of M. tuberculosis infection, the consequence of cell death favors the pathogen. A mature TB granuloma in human patients has slight vascularization and a limited access to immune cells such as macrophages and lymphocytes (25) . The stimulation of cellular apoptosis in the infected and foamy macrophages, which are profusely present, will cause accumulation of caseum and the development of disease pathology. M. tuberculosis takes benefit of this pathology by liquefaction and cavitation of the granuloma, in order to transmit infectious bacilli into the airways. As a result, whereas apoptosis could be advantageous to the host at low bacterial numbers at early stages of infection, it is harmful after the disease has advanced and fibrocaseous granulomas have been generated. Mycobacterial phenolic glycolipid-dependent production of CCL2 in human alveolar macrophages serves as a source for recruitment of permissive macrophages to sustain and disseminate the mycobacterial infection (55) .",

However, it is yet to be established whether TLR2 interaction is the common property of PE/PPE proteins. The complex interactive network of PE/PPE proteins with host cell receptors modulates the pathogenesis of disease. In contrast, an important role of both TLR2 and TLR4 in induction of macrophage apoptosis upon M. tuberculosis infection has also been shown. TLR4-dependent signaling is important in maintaining the balance between necrosis and apoptosis of macrophages (62) . We report for the first time the interaction of TLR4 with Rv0297PGRS of M. tuberculosis in execution of host cell apoptosis. In silico analysis revealed that Rv0297 interacts with TLR4, which was also corroborated by our in vitro TLR4 and Rv0297PGRS interaction assay. Confocal images of this interaction clearly indicated the presence of interacting complexes on the surface of RAW 264.7 cells, but they were totally absent on the cells lacking TLR4. Also, the induction of ROS and NO from macrophages was found to be dependent on TLR4 interaction. RAW cells lacking TLR4 were unable to undergo apoptosis upon stimulation with rRv0297PGRS. All these results supported the functioning of Rv0297 in a TLR4-dependent manner.
