In reality, many hosts form multi-species aggregations and may be infected with an assemblage of pathogens. We used a meta-transcriptomic approach to characterize the viromes of nine avian species in the Anseriformes (ducks) and Charadriiformes (shorebirds). This revealed the presence of 27 viral species, of which 24 were novel, including double-stranded RNA viruses (Picobirnaviridae and Reoviridae), single-stranded RNA viruses (Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Picornaviridae), a retrotranscribing DNA virus (Hepadnaviridae), and a single-stranded DNA virus (Parvoviridae). These viruses comprise multihost generalist viruses and those that are host-specific, indicative of both virome connectivity (host sharing) and heterogeneity (host specificity). Virome connectivity was apparent in two well described multi-host virus species -avian coronavirus and influenza A virus-and a novel Rotavirus species that were shared among some Anseriform species, while virome heterogeneity was reflected in the absence of viruses shared between Anseriformes and Charadriiformes, as well as differences in viral abundance and alpha diversity among species. Overall, we demonstrate complex virome structures across host species that co-exist in multi-species aggregations.",

A significant limitation in studying viral communities in hosts is that most viral species remained undescribed [9] , such that viral ecology across multi-host systems has been limited to \"single-virus\" dynamics, particularly in vertebrate systems (for example, Influenza A virus [IAV] in avian populations). With the advent of unbiased, bulk 'metatranscriptomic' RNA sequencing we can now explore, in more detail, how viral community structure may be shaped by host-species interactions.",

Crucially, they are important reservoirs for viruses with negative consequences for wild birds (e.g. Wellfleet Bay virus; [10] ), poultry (e.g. Avian avulavirus 1; [11] ), and humans (e.g. IAV; [12] ). Despite their importance, we know little of avian viral communities. Birds of the orders Anseriformes and Charadriiformes, the central reservoirs for notifiable avian viruses such as IAV, avian avulavirus, and avian coronavirus [13, 14] , form multi-host flocks, in which many species may migrate, forage, or roost together [15] , making these groups excellent models for studying virome ecology. Flocks may comprise species along a taxonomically related gradient and may utilize similar or different ecological niches in the same environment. For example, in Australia, taxonomically related dabbling Grey Teals (Anas gracilis) and Pacific Black Ducks (Anas superciliosa) may share the environment with the distantly related filter feeding Pink-eared Duck (Malacorhynchus membranaceus). These multi-host flocks form multi-host maintenance communities [6] , with consequences for virus ecology, transmission, and virulence [1, 16, 17] .",

            "text": "Studies of the ecology of IAV, the best studied multihost virus in wild birds, have shown that not all hosts are equal [18, 19] . In particular, there are marked differences in susceptibility, pathology and the subsequent immune response in related species, or more diverse species within similar ecological niches. For example, dramatic differences in viral prevalence exist within the Charadriiformes, such that Ruddy Turnstones (Arenaria interpres) may have an IAV prevalence of~15%, compared to the negligible IAV prevalence in co-sampled Sanderlings (Calidris alba) at Delaware Bay, USA [20] . There are also major differences in the pathology of highly pathogenic IAV in Anseriformes in field and experimental infections. Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) infected with highly pathogenic IAV are thought to move the virus large distances and remain free of clinical signs, while Tufted Ducks (Aythya fuligula), in contrast, experience severe mortality [21] [22] [23] . Following IAV infection, dabbling ducks of the genus Anas are believed to develop poor immune memory [24] , allowing life-long IAV re-infection, in contrast to swans that have long-term immune memory [25] and where re-infection probability is likely very low in adults. These differences are driven by factors encompassing both virus (e.g. virulence, transmission) and host (e.g. receptor availability, immune responses) biology [14] .",

In particular, using samples collected from Australian birds, we aimed to (i) reveal viromes and describe novel viruses in the bird taxa sampled, (ii) determine whether viromes of different host orders have different abundance and viral diversity, (iii) determine whether closely taxonomically related and cooccuring avian hosts have viromes that are more homogenous, and (iv) identify the impact of host taxonomy, which we use as a proxy for differences in relevant host traits (such as host physiology, cell receptors), in shaping virome structure.

Specifically, we calculated observed virome richness, Shannon and Shannon effective indices (i.e. alpha diversity; the diversity within each sample) for each library at the virus family and genus levels using the Rhea alpha diversity script set [32] . Observed virome richness is the number of viruses in each library, whereas Shannon effective is a weighted metric and measures how evenly the viruses are distributed in the sample. Alpha diversity indices were compared between avian orders or virus status using a linear model following a box-cox transformation aiming at achieving homoscedasticity and normality of data. In cases with significant results we also used a more conservative non-parametric test for comparison (Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test). Beta diversity (i.e. virus diversity between different libraries) was estimated as the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix, which takes into account shared taxonomic composition and abundance of viromes, and was plotted as a function of nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination [33] . We tested whether clustering was significant using PERMANOVA (Adonis tests). We also employed Mantel tests to assess the relationship between beta diversity and factors that may be relevant to virome structure. Beta diversity and all associated plots and statistics were calculated using the vegan [34] and phyloseq packages [35] . To determine whether differences in virome composition can be explained by host phylogeny [36] , dendograms of beta diversity were constructed using the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix incorporated into the hclust() function. Dendograms representing library abundance and composition at the viral family, genera, and species level were compared to host phylogeny. For the species level comparisons, we used only those viruses presented in Table S3 . Two phylogenetic tree congruence metrics were then calculated to compare the match between the virome dendogram and host phylogeny: the matching cluster Robinson-Foulds tree metric [37] using the phangorn package [38] , and the normalized PH85 metric [39, 40] using the ape package [41] . For both metrics, a distance of 0 indicates complete congruence and 1, incomplete congruence. The phylogenetic relationships among the avian host species were inferred using a maximum likelihood tree of the cytochrome B mitochondrial sequences and accords with those determined previously [42] [43] [44] [45] . The overall co-phylogenetic analysis was visualized using the phytools package [46] . Finally, the relative abundance of virus families between each avian host order (Charadriiformes versus Anseriformes) was assessed using the wilcox test. Subsequently, log2 relative abundance was calculated using DESeq2 [47] implemented in phyloseq [35] . Given the large number of genera detected within the Picornaviridae, this analysis was repeated at the viral genus level in this case.",

Matching samples in space and time was crucial to understand the role of species within multi-host maintenance flocks with respect to virus sharing or hostspecificity. This resulted in two bird communities comprising five and four species, respectively (Table S1 ). There was a large range in total viral abundance (0.14-10.67% viral reads) and putative avian viral abundance (0.00083-0.327% viral reads) in each library (Table S1 , Fig. 1 ). There was no correlation between RNA concentration and avian viral abundance ( Fig S1) . In addition to avian viral reads, libraries had numerous reads matching arthropod viruses and retroviruses ( Fig. 1 ). Although these retroviruses are likely bird associated, the challenge of differentiating between endogenous and exogenous retroviruses meant that they were excluded from the analysis, as were those viruses most likely associated with arthropods, plants, and bacteria.",

Grey Teal picobirnavirus Y falls into a divergent clade largely comprised of human and porcine picobirnaviruses (and no turkey picobirnaviruses), potentially representing an interesting host-switching event (Fig. 5 ).

Two novel rotavirus species were also revealed from these host species. Indeed, Grey Teals and Pink-eared Ducks shared a rotavirus species, distantly related to rotavirus G. This virus is one of three shared Fig S16. Abundance and alpha diversity of viral genera and species is presented in Figs S17 and S18, respectively viruses in our entire data set.

Similarly, there was no statistically significant clustering of viral families (Adonis: R 2 = 0.13, df = 8, p = 0.267, Mantel: r = \u22120.0668, p = 0.624) or genera (Adonis: R 2 = 0.157, df = 8, p = 0.173, Mantel: r = \u22120.07701, p = 0.622) in the Charadriiformes compared to Anseriformes, suggesting that despite taxonomic differences waterbirds do not experience significant differences in virome composition. We next used a co-phylogenetic approach to better determine whether this lack of clustering was associated with host phylogeny. Accordingly, a phylogram of beta diversity was not congruent with host phylogeny at the viral family, genus, or species levels (Fig. 7b, Figs S25-S26) . Hence, evolutionary relationships among hosts may not play a major role in structuring viromes. For example, closely related sister species (the Anas ducks Grey Teal and Pacific Black Ducks, or Calidris sandpipers Sharp-tailed Sandpipers, Red-necked Stint and Curlew Sandpipers) do not possess viromes that are more similar to each other than to those of more distantly related species within the same avian order. Rather, the phylogram of beta diversity has clusters with a mix of Anseriform and Charadriiform libraries, indicating connectivity of viral families and genera across species of both avian orders (Fig. 7b, Figs S25-S26) . Two post hoc hypotheses of interest were whether there was clustering by feeding mechanism in the Anseriformes or migratory propensity in the Charadriiformes. There is, however, no apparent clustering on the NMDS plots, and due to small sample size we are unable to adequately assess this statistically ( Fig S25) .",

Species level analysis, albeit limited to viruses in which we were able to assemble >1000 bp, is a more accurate measure of connectivity and heterogeneity of avian viromes. First, while there was no marked division in virome composition at the level of viral family or genera between the Anseriformes and the Charadriiformes, there was such a distinction at the level of viral species. Specifically, no viral species were shared between the Anseriformes and Charadriiformes (Fig. 3) , although they were sampled at different time points and at different locations. Within the Anseriformes, three viruses (IAV, avian gammacoronavirus, and duck rotavirus G-like) were shared between three libraries: Grey Teal, Pink-eared Duck and Australian Shelduck (Fig. 3) . These shared viruses were especially common in the viromes of the Grey Teal (80% of avian viral reads), Australian Shelduck (82% of avian viral reads), and a small proportion of Pink-eared Duck avian viral reads (17%). The two Anas ducks (Grey Teal and Pacific Black Duck), the most closely related Anseriformes, did not share any viral species; surprisingly, the virome of the Pacific-Black Duck was different from the three connected host species. Further, Grey Teal and Pink-eared Ducks, the most taxonomically distinct waterfowl, shared two viral species, demonstrating the limited impact of host phylogeny (Fig. 3) . These viruses were also shared across different feeding strategies (dabbling and filter feeding), suggesting that co-occurrence was potentially responsible for their spread.",

Given the data on IAV, we might expect to see differences in virome structure due to a number of host factors [14] , including differences in biology/physiology. For example, different host species have different cell receptors which in turn results in different cell and tissue tropisms and patterns of viral attachment [57] . Further, following infection, different species have differences in long-term immune memory [24, 25] . However, we saw no clear distinction between the viromes of Anseriformes or Charadriiformes based on host taxonomy, suggesting these host factors are not central to virome structuring. For example, within the Charadriiformes, the closely related Calidris sandpipers (Scolopacidae) did not have similar viromes and did not cluster as a group independently from Red-capped Plover, a member of a different avian family (Charadridae). Alternatively, it is possible that aspects of host ecology, such as foraging ecology, may be more important in shaping virome composition than host taxonomy (a proxy for physiology). Specifically, differences in ecology may generate differences in virus exposure across closely related hosts [14, 58, 59] . The five Anseriform species studied here utilize three different feeding ecologies-dabbling, grazing, and filter feeding-while the four Charadriiform species have different bill lengths and forage in different layers of sediment [15] . Notably, however, there was no obvious clustering based upon feeding ecologies and this data set was too small to adequately test this hypothesis.",

            "text": "Central to our study was considering virome structure in the context of a multi-host and multi-virus model of virushost interactions. Accordingly, the data generated here revealed large-scale heterogeneity in virus abundance, alpha diversity and species level composition in the nine avian species assessed in this study, and at the levels of virus family, genus, and even species. Despite this heterogeneity, there was also some connectivity (i.e. host sharing) among viromes at the levels of virus family, genus, and even species. In particular, some viral families and genera were ubiquitous in almost all avian libraries, including members of the Picornaviridae and Reoviridae. More striking was the connectivity between three avian species (Grey Teal, Australian Shelduck, and Pink-eared Duck) at the level of viral species: these hosts shared IAV, gammacoronavirus, and Duck G-like rotavirus. As these Anseriformes were sampled in the same temporal and spatial frames, such a similarity in viromes was not unexpected despite the differences in taxonomy. However, at the level of viral species there was no host sharing of viruses between the Anseriform and Charadriiform libraries. This may be due to the physiological differences noted above or, more simply, that the ducks and wader viruses were sampled at different times and places. Despite the lack of connectivity between the Anseriformes and Charadriiformes at a viral species level, avian avulavirus 1 and deltacoronavirus detected in Rednecked Stint and Sharp-tailed Sandpiper, respectively, have been previously described in Anseriformes [13, 52] , likely facilitated by the association of these birds to water. Specifically, viruses such as IAV are thought to be primarily transmitted by the faecal-oral route, in which viruses contaminate water through the faeces and birds ingest the viruses while feeding or preening [18] . Such water-borne transmission is critical to the dynamics of infection in bird communities [60] . Furthermore, aquatic habitats seemingly support a higher risk of infection as compared to terrestrial habitats [59, 61] . In support of this was the observation of lower viral diversity and abundance in the grazing Australian Wood duck, which has a more terrestrial dietary strategy compared to the other Anseriform species.",

            "text": "In sum, viral families and genera appeared to be readily shared among hosts, suggesting that waterbirds are key hosts for these families and genera. More importantly, our results indicate that avian viromes are largely comprised of seemingly multi-host generalist viruses (here, IAV, avian coronavirus, avian avulavirus type 1, duck rotavirus D-like) along with potential host-specific specialist viruses, which likely play a role in driving both heterogeneity and connectivity. While we found no evidence for viral species shared across avian orders, known multi-host virus species were revealed in both avian orders. Cases of clear host specificity were rare, but we speculate that Wood Duck Hepatitis B virus is likely host specific given high host specificity in this viral family [62] . In addition, the clade level structuring of Megriviruses (Picornaviridae), and previous report of an identical Megrivirus species found in the same avian species in very different locations [28] , similarly suggests some level of host specificity in this viral genus. Of course, large-scale testing and experimental infection studies will be required to better understand the host range of these newly described species. Viral discovery efforts are imperative to better understanding factors that shape virome structure and the scope of host specificity in the avian reservoir. Importantly, we believe it is also imperative to consider multi-host, multivirus systems in virus ecology.",
