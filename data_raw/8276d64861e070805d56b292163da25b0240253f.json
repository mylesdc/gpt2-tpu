Previous pneumonia studies that conducted multiple tests on cases and controls have acknowledged the limitations of the available analytic choices when attempting to integrate these data [2, 3] . Because of insufficient epidemiologic and statistical tools, those investigators did not attempt to estimate the pneumonia etiologic distribution. Instead, they described etiology for a subset of the cases where they were confident about the etiology, such as blood or lung aspirate culture-positive cases, or for a subset of pathogens where measurements were considered both sufficiently sensitive and specific, such as for tuberculosis and pertussis, then designated all remaining cases to have \"unknown\" etiology [1] .

When multiple etiologies are being estimated, simulation experiments (pathogens A and B in Supplementary Figure 1) show that the coefficients are biased as a result of measurement error and inherent negative correlation among the predictors because in this simulation only 1 predictor can be positive (ie, in a case where pathogen A is the true cause, pathogen A will more likely be positive and the other pathogens will more likely be negative relative to other cases). Because pathogens with an odds ratio \u22641 result in a zero or negative attributable fraction, these pathogens do not appear in the etiologic distribution and are interpreted as not being causes of the disease. Attributable fraction analyses also typically do not account for imperfect sensitivity of the tests so implicitly assume a sensitivity of 100%; if the sum of attributable fractions across the multiple etiologies assessed is <100%, this implies that the remainder is due to other pathogens not tested for.",

            "text": "The concept of how the PERCH integrated analysis integrates multiple measurements while simultaneously accounting for the distribution for the unknown sensitivity can be illustrated by considering data from 2 tests for 1 pathogen. Each test alone provides an estimate of the etiologic fraction of the pathogen. Integration can be performed by averaging the results to obtain a single overall estimate. One could conceive that averaging the results in a way that draws on the strengths of each may be an acceptable method to get a single overall estimate that incorporates the evidence from each test. We illustrate using an example common to pneumonia etiology studies of integrating NP/OP PCR results from cases and controls with blood culture data from cases to estimate the etiologic fraction due to pneumococcus. Let us assume we observed 9 of 600 (1.5%) hospitalized cases with pneumococcus detected by blood culture, and based upon prior data from vaccine probe trials, we assume that blood culture sensitivity is between 5% and 20%, with 95% probability. After accounting for the false negatives, we would estimate the proportion of cases with pneumococcal pneumonia to be between 7.5% and 30% (ie, 7.5% of cases if the sensitivity is 20%, and 30% of cases if the sensitivity is 5%). For NP/OP PCR data, let us assume that high density NP/OP colonization with pneumococcus is a proxy for pneumococcal pneumonia but with imperfect specificity that can be estimated using the control data. Suppose that in the cases, we detected 30% with high-density NP/OP pneumococcal colonization and observed odds ratio of 2 when compared with controls. Using the attributable fraction method, we would estimate 15% of cases to have pneumococcal pneumonia if we assume NP/OP PCR test sensitivity is 100% (ie, 1\u2212[1/OR = 2] \u00d7 30%). However, the study data provide evidence regarding sensitivity of NP/OP PCR, which is the proportion of the 9 blood culture-positive pneumococcal cases that also had high-density pneumococcal colonization. As with the first test, we also use prior knowledge about the sensitivity of the NP/OP PCR. Suppose that the observed rate of concordance of the 2 tests, combined with the prior knowledge, leads us to conclude that the true NP/OP PCR sensitivity is in the range 50%-90% with high probability. If so, then between 17% and 30% (ie, 15%/90% and 15%/50%) of cases would be estimated to have pneumococcal pneumonia based on the NP/OP PCR data. Note that although the estimates from the 2 measurements are not identical, they are relatively consistent in that both support estimates in the range of 17%-30% (ie, the overlapping range from the 2 data sources).",

Stating the assumptions regarding the sensitivity of each measure as was done above is an example of setting sensitivity priors. If there were no prior information to suggest that 1 pathogen is more likely responsible for the pneumonia over another for any given case, then setting every pathogen as equally likely is an example of an etiology prior.

The \"latent class\" is the unknown etiology of the cases, and it is \"partially\" latent in a case-control analysis because the control's lung status is known (no infection). The detection of a pathogen in a control specimen indicates a false-positive result for case etiology attribution, therefore providing direct specificity estimates for that test result. A nested partial latent class model assumes that the pathogen infecting a case's lung is present and detected in each specimen with a given sensitivity of the test measurement. Nesting refers to extra latent subclasses within an etiologic class to account for situations where results of some measurements are not independent due to various biological or laboratory factors, such as poor specimen collection resulting in negative results for all pathogens measured. To estimate the etiologic fraction for each organism, the PERCH integrated analysis incorporates the etiology and sensitivity priors with the likelihood of the observed data through a numerical integration process (Markov chain Monte Carlo [MCMC] [11] ) to obtain probability distributions of the etiology that comprise the main output from the model (ie, \"posterior\" distributions).

As a Bayesian method, the key unknowns (etiologic fractions, sensitivities) are assumed to have probability distributions that represent our uncertainty about their values. The analysis starts with the user-specified prior distributions that reflect our degree of uncertainty before the study and are updated by the evidence in the data to produce posterior distributions reflecting our reduced uncertainty after the study. This approach uses the prior as a starting place. Although providing starting values for the distribution of the etiology fraction may seem counterintuitive because this is what we aim to learn from the study, in PERCH we choose \"noninformative\" priors that represent our starting assumption that each pathogen has an equal chance to be the cause for a particular child.

The mean (with 95% confidence interval) and selected quantiles from the distribution of the 500 etiologic fraction attributable fraction results for all 5 pathogen groups are shown in the white box plots of Figure 3B and in Supplementary  Table 1 . Under conditions when true sensitivity and specificity are both high (eg, 100% and 85%, respectively, for pathogen A), attributable fraction approximates the true pathogen prevalence but is biased because the sensitivity for some pathogens is misspecified (ie, assumes 100%). This inherent bias with attributable fraction is caused by the negative correlation between test results for different pathogens that are competing with one another to predict case status [7] . If odds ratios are estimated without adjusting for the results of the other pathogens, the resulting attributable fraction estimates are unbiased when sensitivity is 100% (blue box plots in Supplementary  Figure 1 ). However, estimating single causes in the absence of data on other causes does not reflect the situation in pneumonia etiology studies. Regardless of whether we are estimating etiology for a single or multiple pathogens, when sensitivity is <100% (pathogens C and D), the attributable fraction method underestimates etiology, and the magnitude of both the bias and variance increases as specificity decreases (ie, as the odds ratio approaches 1.0 as for pathogen D; white boxes in Figure 3B ). The etiologic fractions of the pathogens are not constrained to sum to 100%, so the distribution will incorrectly sum to <100% when \u22651 pathogens have <100% sensitivity. Often the resulting underestimated etiologies will be misattributed to pathogens not tested for (NoA white boxes in Figure 3B ), thus overestimating their true fraction. To account for sensitivity, the etiologic fractions could be expanded either by normalizing so that all pathogen-specific slices sum to 100%, which assumes the same sensitivity across all pathogens, or by dividing individual pathogens by their sensitivity. However, such adjustments are typically not done and there is not a natural, principled way to incorporate the uncertainty around the sensitivity estimates.",

Results for pathogens that had both bronze-and silver-standard measurements (B1, C1, and D1) were more frequently close to the true value compared with pathogens with only 1 measurement (B2-B3, C2-C3, and D2-D3), demonstrating value in combining evidence from multiple measurements, even when their individual results are similar. For example, B1 had both specimens available and the bias and standard deviation of the estimate was less than that observed when only bronze-(B2) or silver-standard (B3) data were available (Supplementary Table 2 ). When the bronze-standard data were uninformative (ie, OR, 1.0) as with pathogen B4, results were similar to cases with silver-standard data only (B3), thus showing no benefit of including these data but little harm either.

The bias caused by this sensitivity prior was to overestimate the etiologic fraction of pathogen A by 5% on average ( Figure 5A and Supplementary Table 3A ). Because the etiologic fractions estimated for all pathogens must sum to 100%, there is an indirect impact on the estimates for the other pathogens that are biased downward. The magnitude by which they will be affected will be a function of the strength of the evidence in their data. This can be observed for the NoA group, which represents pathogens not tested for and thus with no data. Its bias is greatest (estimate decreased from the true value of 6% to 2.2%), whereas the estimates for the other pathogens with data were only minimally impacted. Scenario 2: Underestimating the true bronze-standard sensitivity for pathogens with and without silver-standard data. To further examine the effects of underestimating bronze-standard sensitivity priors, we changed the true sensitivity to 90% for 3 pathogens, each with 10% true etiology, while leaving the mean sensitivity prior at 75% (range, 60%-90%). Compared with the results in Figure 4A , etiology was only slightly overestimated for the 2 pathogens (B1-B2) with moderate bronze-standard data (OR, 2), but pathogen B1, which also had silver-standard data, was less affected (average bias was 0.9% vs 1.6%; Figure 5B and Supplementary Table 3B ). The effects on pathogens without informative bronze-standard data (ie, OR, 1 for silver-standard only data; B3-B4) were minimal and only due to the indirect effect in response to the increase in B2. The cumulative mean bias again mostly affected the NoA group, but pathogen A also had a slight (0.5%) mean decrease relative to the unbiased analysis in Figure 4A .

Scenario 4: Increasing the range of the silver-standard sensitivity prior. To evaluate the effect of wide silver-standard sensitivity priors but where both still covered the true sensitivity of 15%, we widened ranges from 5%-25% in Figure 4A to 1%-50% in Figure 5D . Widening the sensitivity prior range had little effect on the etiologic faction estimates as these changed \u22641% for all pathogens and the rank order of the pathogens was preserved ( Figure 5D ).

Although the current version of the PERCH integrated analysis is flexible enough to meet most of the challenges of analyzing pneumonia etiology data, the PERCH integrated analysis cannot solve or even address the biggest problem in determining pneumonia etiology, which is that most of the evidence comes from peripheral sources and not directly from the site of infection. Even peripheral measurements with perfect specificity (ie, blood culture) have low prevalence and can provide information only for bacterial pathogens, not viruses. The strength of the evidence and the robustness of the inferences from the PERCH integrated analysis would be greater with more silver-standard blood culture-and lung aspirateconfirmed cases, which both reduces uncertainty around these measures and better informs on the sensitivity of the silver-and bronze-standard NP/OP PCR data. Obviously, this inability to quantify or correct for systematic bias in the peripheral measurements applies to any analysis of pneumonia etiology. An essential assumption of the PERCH integrated analysis is that, when a pathogen is the cause of pneumonia, it is the only pathogen whose chance of being measured in the periphery is increased by its infection of the lung. This assumes that the peripheral measurements are unbiased reflections of the state of the lung. If instead, infection by 1 pathogen in the lung increases the presence of other pathogens in the periphery, the PERCH integrated analysis and any other analysis of the peripheral data alone will be biased, absent external knowledge that could be used for correction. In addition, in situations where >1 pathogen is determined to be in the lung, case-control studies by design cannot determine whether only 1 or more than 1 are the cause.",

Despite the fact that the priors are objectively updated by data, this raises the question of the degree to which the resulting posterior distributions are influenced by the prior assumptions, rather than just the data. This is mitigated in that Bayesian methods are flexible enough to incorporate our uncertainty about unknowns and we can perform sensitivity analyses to determine which assumptions are most influential on the substantive findings; when changing the prior assumptions within a plausible class does not meaningfully change the results, we can be more assured that the data are largely determining the outputs by comparison to the priors.",

In simplest terms, we seek to know the frequency with which pathogens infect lungs, and PERCH cannot measure the lung (with a few exceptions), only the blood and NP/OP. A similar state of affairs exists in many sciences: particle physics (particle traces in steam), astronomy (waves impinging on telescopes), and chemistry (colorimetry), to name a few. Although Bayesian methods present a solution, they also present a challenge in that they are not as well understood or as widely used as frequentist statistics in the international health community and may be mistrusted as nontransparent \"black box\" methods. Nevertheless, the reality is that, far from being new, this approach has been successfully used in many scientific applications since Thomas Bayes introduced it 250 years ago. One of its most notable applications was by Alan Turing to crack the enigma code [14] . The PERCH integrated analysis may be likened in that respect to a modern internal-combustion-engine car: its core (engine, wheels, controls) is simple, not different than was used 100 years ago, but there are lots of modern \"bells and whistles, \" each of which improves its performance. The availability of open-source software to conduct the PERCH integrated analysis will enable wider use of Bayesian tools.
