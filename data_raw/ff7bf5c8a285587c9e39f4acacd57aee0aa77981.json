Cold-adapted, live attenuated influenza vaccine (CAIV) induces local innate immune responses that provide a broad range of antiviral immunity. Herein, we examined whether X-31ca, a donor virus for CAIVs, provides non-specific cross-protection against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The degree of RSV replication was significantly reduced when X-31ca was administered before RSV infection without any RSV-specific antibody responses. The vaccination induced an immediate release of cytokines and infiltration of leukocytes into the respiratory tract, moderating the immune perturbation caused by RSV infection. The potency of protection against RSV challenge was significantly reduced in TLR3 \u2212/\u2212 TLR7 \u2212/\u2212 mice, confirming that the TLR3/7 signaling pathways are necessary for the observed immediate and short-term protection. The results suggest that CAIVs provide short-term, non-specific protection against genetically unrelated respiratory pathogens. The additional benefits of CAIVs in mitigating acute respiratory infections for which vaccines are not yet available need to be assessed in future studies.",

WHO has acknowledged the magnitude of this problem and has highlighted the need for research focused on the prevention of respiratory viral infections. However, except for influenza virus, there are no authorized vaccines available for the prevention of emerging/re-emerging respiratory viral infections (Hall, 2001) . Vaccination is based on the adaptive immune responses that provide protection against a specific pathogen. Safe and controlled activation of the immune system results in a specific memory in the vaccinated hosts and protects them from secondary infection with the same pathogen (Chang et al., 2014) . Recently, several studies have reported non-specific beneficial effects of vaccines on mortality and morbidity; these effects cannot be explained solely by adaptive immunity (Aaby et al., 2014; Goodridge et al., 2016) . Growing evidence shows that the innate immune system acquires adaptive characteristics by 'trained immunity, ' via epigenetic reprogramming of innate immune cells (Blok et al., 2015) . A temporary antiviral response could also be established by the turnover of the cells that survived the initial infection (Hamilton et al., 2016) . As such, nonspecific effects (NSE) of vaccines usually develop a sufficient duration after the initial vaccination. The possibility remains, however, that NSE may also operate in an immediate manner for short-term protection, especially considering the potent antiviral responses of the innate immune system (Takeuchi and Akira, 2009) . Such an effect is expected to be quite significant, especially with live attenuated vaccines that mimic natural infections (Seo et al., 2007) . For example, live influenza vaccination was found to be associated with an immediate and indirect protection from respiratory illness among children (Piedra et al., 2007) .",

Despite being classified into distinctive viral families (Latiff et al., 2004) , RSV and influenza share common features in term of pathogenesis. Both viruses cause acute respiratory infections, and initial infection triggers innate immunity via pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs), including TLR3, TLR7, and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) (Diebold et al., 2004; Guillot et al., 2005; Marr et al., 2013) . The activated PRRs induce the production of interferons (IFNs), pro-inflammatory cytokines, and chemokines (Iwasaki and Pillai, 2014) . IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 induces robust antiviral and immunomodulatory responses to interfere with virus replication and spread (Gonzalez-Navajas et al., 2012; Durbin et al., 2013) , and IFN-\u03b3 is also critical for viral clearance of influenza virus and RSV (Weiss et al., 2010; Eichinger et al., 2015) . We found, in a mouse infection model, that early innate immune responses were elicited in the respiratory tracts, restricting RSV replication and ameliorating the rapid increase of the early inflammatory cytokines following RSV challenge. The importance of the TLR3/7-dependent pathway was confirmed by using knockout (KO) mice. Considering previous findings on the long-term effects of influenza infection on subsequent RSV exposure (Walzl et al., 2000) , we discuss the immediate NSE of CAIV as an additional benefit of vaccination among infants for the prevention of acute respiratory infections.",

Mice were then vaccinated with 10 6 PFU of X-31ca at various time intervals prior to RSV challenge. Weight changes were observed for 4 days after RSV challenge, and the mice were euthanized at day 4 post-challenge (p.c.) to collect lung tissues. Mice vaccinated with X-31ca 2 days before RSV challenge presented approximately 10% weight loss on day 2 p.c., whereas mice in other groups did not lose body weight ( Figure 1B) . Other indicative signs of illness, such as reduced activity or ruffled fur, were not noticed in the vaccination group on in the control group without vaccination. The lung viral titers dropped below the threshold level upon immunization with X-31ca, preventing RSV replication in the lung for up to 6 days during the interval between immunization and RSV challenge ( Figure 1C) . Pulmonary viral titers gradually increased when the interval was more than 14 days. In contrast, the lung viral titers in the mice vaccinated with formalin-inactivated X-31ca 2 days before RSV challenge were similar to those in unvaccinated mice ( Figure 1D ). RSV titer was measured only in HEp-2 cells, as the lung viral titer from parallel immunization of X-31ca, without RSV challenge, was below the detection level within 4 days of immunization (data not shown). Together, these results demonstrate that X-31ca vaccination could confer early, short-term protection against RSV challenge in mice.",

BAL fluids and cells were obtained daily for 6 days from mice infected with 10 6 PFU of X-31ca. The samples were used to examine the levels of IFNs (IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, and IFN-\u03b3) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6), and the numbers of immune cells (pDCs, NK cells, and eosinophils) as markers for innate immune responses (Figure 3) . The concentrations of IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 peaked on day 1 p.v. and decreased gradually, whereas the induction of IFN-\u03b3 was delayed, with its level peaking on day 6 p.v. (Figure 3A) . Immunization with X-31ca induced lower, but still distinctly elevated, levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6. Populations of various immune cell types were examined by fluorescenceactivated cell sorting (FACS) analysis (Figures 3B,C) for both the number of cells (left side) and the percentage of total immune cells (right side). Vaccinated mice elicited more pDCs (CD11c low PDCA-1 + cells) than the control group throughout the 6 days of examination, with peak values on days 3 and 4 p.v. (Figure 3B) . The recruitment of NK cells (CD11b + CD49b + cells) and eosinophils (CD11c \u2212 Siglec-F + cells) was slightly delayed, showing a peak level on day 5 p.v. The number of CD45 + immune cells in BAL was greatly increased as compared with the PBS control after day 3 p.v. (Figure 3C ). pDCs and NK cells showed similar patterns for both the number and percentage of total immune cells, whereas eosinophils presented a different pattern ( Figure 3B ). This result probably reflected the highest increase in total immune cells on day 5 and 6 p.v. (Figure 3C) .

(Figure 4C) . However, NK cells and eosinophils showed different patterns for both the number and proportion of total immune cells, probably reflecting the increase in total immune cells upon vaccination with X-31ca ( Figure 4D) . The number and proportion of AMs (CD11c + Siglec-F + cells) and neutrophils (CD11c inter Gr-1 high cells) were also examined (as described in Figure 4 and Supplementary Figure S5 ). The number and percentage of AMs were higher in vaccinated mice than in unvaccinated mice, only at day 2 p.c. In vaccinated mice, the number of neutrophils was consistently higher than that in unvaccinated mice, but the proportion did not show a significant difference between two groups. These results show that X-31ca vaccination recruits a large number of immune cells into the respiratory tract, and stabilizes the immune environment sufficiently to overcome immune perturbation by subsequent infection.

Cytokine profiles and immune cells were relatively unperturbed and were maintained even after RSV challenge. Experiments with KO mice confirmed that the innate immunity mediated by TLR3 and TLR7 was responsible for RSV protection. These results demonstrate that X-31ca administration prior to RSV challenge activated a much milder, but distinct, induction of cytokines and recruited more immune cells, and that these innate immune responses conferred early protection against RSV infection. Previously, influenza infection-mediated protection from RSV was evaluated in mice, and a long-lasting influence on subsequent responses to an additional infection was observed (Walzl et al., 2000) . In contrast, the present analyses address the immediate response rather than a prolonged and delayed response upon influenza vaccination rather than infection. The present results in both trained and na\u00efve innate immune arms suggest that an indirect, non-specific protection operates on a wide spectrum.",

As reflected in the lung viral titer, RSV replication was significantly inhibited by prior inoculation of X-31ca within 6 days ( Figure 1C) . The observed inhibition was achieved without significant changes in weight loss over 4-6 days. However, noticeable changes in weight loss (up to 10%) were apparent for shorter intervals (2 days) (Figure 1B) , despite enhanced inhibition of RSV ( Figure 1C) . Previously, it was shown that increased recruitment of NK cells is involved in not only viral clearance but also weight loss (Harker et al., 2010) . However, the apparent adverse effect of the increase in NK cell population ( Figure 4C ) could be counter-balanced by the potential beneficial effects associated with the changes in the cytokine profiles. For instance, the decrease in type I IFN by prior vaccination (Figure 4B ) may reduce its potential adverse effect of increasing the susceptibility to secondary bacterial infections (Li et al., 2012) . Prior vaccination with X-31ca (-2d) before RSV challenge transiently increased the number of eosinophils and neutrophils ( Figure 4C and Supplementary Figure S5 ), which may be responsible for a complex inflammatory response underlying the observed weight loss in the same vaccination/challenge schedule ( Figure 1B) . The generalizability of these findings are limited, however, by the lack of a relevant animal model for influenza and RSV superinfection.",

It should be noted that, FluMist R , as a prototype CAIV, has been licensed for vaccination of individuals > 2 years of age. Most of the genetic mutations in CAIVs that attenuate of virulence are in internal genes (Snyder et al., 1988; Klimov et al., 1992; Jang et al., 2016) , but CAIVs could be further attenuated by additional mutations either on surface antigens or in internal genes (Liedmann et al., 2014) , which could improve the safety profile of CAIVs for infants. A major distinction between the two attenuated strains is that FluMist R is based on the H2N2 strain (Baez et al., 1980; Maassab and DeBorde, 1985) , whereas X-31ca is based on the H1N1 backbone (Lee et al., 2006) . It would be interesting to determine, therefore, whether similar non-specific protection is provided by the licensed CAIV vaccine. Currently, the possibility of prime-boost-type early childhood vaccination is being debated with a view to implement a universal vaccine program (Krammer and Palese, 2014) . With the future prospect of using CAIVs for infants, subject to safety issues associated with live vaccines, additional benefits may be anticipated, especially for non-specific protection from RSV and other respiratory viruses such as HPIVs, for which no licensed vaccines are available (Hall, 2001) .",

Moreover, most of the NSEs of vaccines have been evaluated in the clinical setting and monitored over the long-term (Kandasamy et al., 2016) . Independent studies on the short-term NSEs of vaccinations would be impractical in the clinical setting, but could be implemented during the evaluation of the clinical effectiveness of vaccines (Piedra et al., 2007) .
