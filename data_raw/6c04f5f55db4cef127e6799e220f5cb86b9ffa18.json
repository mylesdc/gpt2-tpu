To accurately understand and explain epidemic behaviour information on contact networks is required, but only limited empirical data is available. Online respondent-driven detection can provide relevant epidemiological data on numbers of contact persons and dynamics of contacts between pairs of individuals. We aimed to analyse contact networks with respect to sociodemographic and geographical characteristics, vaccine-induced immunity and self-reported symptoms. Methods: In 2014, volunteers from two large participatory surveillance panels in the Netherlands and Belgium were invited for a survey. Participants were asked to record numbers of contacts at different locations and self-reported influenza-like-illness symptoms, and to invite 4 individuals they had met face to face in the preceding 2 weeks. We calculated correlations between linked individuals to investigate mixing patterns.",

We also found assortative recruitment by symptoms, reaffirming our objective of sampling contact persons whom a participant may infect or by whom a participant may get infected in case of an outbreak. Recruitment was random by sex and numbers of contact persons. Relationships between pairs were influenced by the spatial distribution of peer recruitment.",

Knowledge on contact patterns is therefore important for the design of optimal outbreak control strategies [1] [2] [3] [4] . To accurately understand and explain epidemic dynamics, information is required on the underlying contact network of a host population, i.e., a network that contains all contact persons potentially at risk for infection. For example, the number of contacts an infectious individual has with susceptible persons determines among others the basic reproduction number R 0 (i.e., the number of secondary cases one case generates in a susceptible population) [5] .",

For example, the POLYMOD study, a large randomized study in eight European countries, used contact diaries to analyse mixing patterns of independent respondents [9] . Despite controversies on the different modes of transmission of respiratory infectious diseases [10] , faceto-face conversations and physical contact are often used as proxies for potential infectious contacts [9, 11] .

Respondent-driven detection, a method of detection derived from snowball sampling, is a chain recruitment method that allows for systematic sampling of contact persons of participants. Previously, we demonstrated that under certain conditions such a recruitment method can be applied online to extract topological properties of contact networks in an anonymous manner [15, 16] . This approach provides novel insights in contact network structures compared to studies that sampled participants independently of one another and collected no information about the network beyond the contact persons reported by participants [7] . In these earlier studies 'seed' individuals of similar age groups and backgrounds were sampled at convenience [15, 16] . Furthermore, complex mechanisms may play a role when participants choose from amongst their contact persons and when contact persons decide whether to join the survey [11] . For example, with an offline (i.e., paper based) chain recruitment method participants have a tendency to recruit spatially proximal peers [17] . This determines the type of contact networks being sampled. Note that we distinguish respondent-driven detection from respondent-driven sampling as our main objective was to study contact networks, and not to estimate population proportions from the sample.",

In this paper we were interested in the contact networks of respondents and the association with self-reported disease. In particular, we aimed to determine correlations between participants linked by recruitment chains (i.e., who recruits whom) with respect to sociodemographic characteristics, vaccine-induced immunity and selfreported symptoms. In addition, we investigated the effect of spatial peer recruitment on these correlations.

We used the definition of the World Health Organization to define ILI that includes having fever (excluding questions on a body temperature of \u2265 38 C\u00b0) and cough with an onset within the last 10 days. Participants were also asked whether they had received an invitation to get an influenza vaccination and whether they had received influenza vaccination in the past 12 months. This information was used as a proxy for the possible immune status of participants. As earlier studies described clustered patterns of influenza vaccination uptake and sentiments concerning vaccination, we asked participants whether they believed that the influenza vaccine protects them against influenza [20, 21] . Lastly, for each participant we collected information on age, sex, educational level, household members and their age, four digit postal code, and work or study location.

Firstly, we used the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test to compare column wise for each participant's age group the (integer) age distribution of recruits sampled in our study, with those of contact persons recorded in POLYMOD.

A Poisson Inverse-Gaussian distribution with mean \u03bc = 19.6 (95 % CI 18.3-21.1) and dispersion parameter \u03bb = 2.0 (95 % CI 1.8-2.1) best fitted the empirical degree distribution. Analysis of degree with a multiple regression model showed a lower contact frequency for those aged \u2265 65 years compared to participants between 0 and 39 years old (Table 2) . A larger household size was associated with a higher number of contact persons. Participants with ILI had less contact persons than persons without these symptoms. Such reduction in numbers of contacts has also been observed among ILI cases during the 2009 influenza epidemic and may be explained by people staying at home and avoiding social activities when ill [29] . Weekdays were associated with 33 %-84 % more contact persons than Sundays (see also Additional file 1 for the distribution of contact persons by days of the week), which is in accordance with results from other studies on contact patterns [9, 30] .

There were 206 recruitment trees with at least two nodes (i.e., trees with at least two participants and one recruitment wave), and two of these trees consisted of 11 nodes each. One recruitment tree reached 6 waves of recruits.

For comparison with POLYMOD, the sample was weighted for the size of POLYMOD age groups (weights are displayed in Additional file 1), and the category \"at the home of family and friends\" was combined with \"other\". POLYMOD was regrouped as \"home\", \"work\" (at work and at school combined) and \"other\" (leisure, travel and other combined), frequency of contact with the same person was ignored and for contact at multiple locations only the first entry was counted (equivalent to our questionnaire) respondent-driven method in combination with participatory surveillance can be used to (i) study contact networks relevant for the spread of infectious diseases that transmit via close contact between individuals, (ii) detect clustering of these diseases in a contact network, and (iii) reach within short time and with large spatial coverage a diverse group of individuals in the general population. Furthermore, we found that the spatial distribution of recruitment influences the type of contact networks being sampled. We analysed a large number of recruiter-recruit pairs and of individuals with different ages and backgrounds. This enabled us to investigate the distribution of numbers of contact persons and to quantify the strength of network ties that allow the transmission of diseases that spread via close contact or airborne droplets. Such information can inform mathematical models of infectious disease epidemics [31] [32] [33] [34] . Symptomatic participants showed a tendency to recruit other symptomatic participants, at least for one or more symptoms and selfreported influenza. This observation lends some support to our hypothesis that via respondent-driven recruitment we reached contact persons whom a participant may infect or by whom a participant may get infected in case of an infectious disease outbreak. The self-reported symptom data by pairs of participants provides an indication on disease clustering in contact networks. Such information can be quickly obtained with online respondent-driven detection as the recruitment generation interval was less than one day.",

A stratification on distance of the relationships between recruiter-recruit pairs showed differences in the type of recruited contact persons. There may be several explanations why a participant invited certain contact persons [35] . For example, symptomatic participants may have been biased towards inviting symptomatic contact persons who lived further away than contact persons whom they more frequently meet. A proper assessment would require to investigate the 'pool of contact persons' from which a recruiter can choose, and which contact persons were invited but did not join the survey. Furthermore, identifying different types of relations (e.g., family members, friends or colleagues) by asking recruits about their recruiter would allow further clarification of the observed correlations. Such information can only be collected with a nonanonymous survey design, which would also make it possible to measure transitivity, i.e., the extent to which contact persons of a participant are also contact persons of each other [36] .

In addition, proportions of contact persons at different locations were similar to POLYMOD and the regression analysis showed similar covariates such as age, household size and days of week to affect degree. This suggests for online recruitment that invited contact persons are in general representative for the contact persons daily encountered by participants and that respondent-driven detection can indeed provide accurate information on the underlying contact network. However, despite the fact that recruitment criteria were set the same for all participants, regardless of whether they reported symptoms, we cannot preclude a bias in how participants chose from their contact persons. The age matrices were statistically not comparable. There may be several explanations for this statistical discrepancy, such as a difference in the age distributions of the samples and the fact Commuting network: directions that participants daily commute to work or study. Arrows indicate commuting across provinces, and circles commuting within a province. Sizes of arrows and circles are weighted for the total number of recruitments/commuters, with darker colours/larger circles indicating higher proportions. The maps were created with a shapefile (.shp file) that was extracted from GADM, an online geographic database of global administrative areas that is freely available for academic and other non-commercial use [45] that POLYMOD participants were able to report an unrestricted number of contact persons, while our survey participants could only invite a maximum of four contact persons. This study has limitations. By using participatory surveillance panels for recruitment of seeds, we reached a diverse group of individuals within a short period of time. However, the volunteers in these panels are not representative for the general population; some groups like women and highly educated persons are overrepresented [19] . Such overrepresentations are common in participatory surveillance systems [18] . We did reach all age groups, but due to strong assortative peer recruitment certain age classes were represented more in the sample and the young age classes were reached less with our survey, therefore limiting the generalisability of our results to the young age groups.",

The mean number of contact persons per participant was therefore likely higher than in previous studies [9, 39] . More importantly, we did not collect information on contact intensity and duration. The probability of transmission between individuals requires different levels of contact for different infectious diseases, e.g., influenza and measles require only spatial proximity between individuals to transmit, while Ebola is believed to require physical contact to cause infection [7, 14] . Note that the survey did not include questions on other potentially important transmission routes, such as exposure not involving physical contact or conversation (e.g., sneezing passenger in public transport) or indirect fomite transmission from shared contaminated objects [7] . Earlier studies explicitly linked contact intensity and duration with infection risk and showed their importance for understanding transmission dynamics [40, 41] . Contact duration also influences the likelihood that a certain contact is reported, e.g., contacts of long duration are substantially more likely to get reported than contacts of short duration [42, 43] . It is possible to derive these contact metrics from earlier studies, but not to exclude the effect of heterogeneities in motivation or recall capabilities on reported numbers of contacts, e.g., between male and female participants [42] .",

The observed contact patterns are relevant for the transmission of respiratory pathogens that spread via close contact between individuals. We found that the spatial distribution of recruitment influenced the type of contact networks being sampled. Even though complex mechanisms influence peer recruitment, the observed statistical relationships reflected the observed contact network patterns in the general population. This provides useful and innovative input for predictive epidemic models relying on network information. ",
