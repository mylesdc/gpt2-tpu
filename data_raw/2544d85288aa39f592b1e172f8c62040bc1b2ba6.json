            "text": "African swine fever virus (ASFV) is a complex, cytoplasmic doublestranded DNA (dsDNA) virus that is currently expanding throughout the world. Currently, circulating virulent genotype II Armenia/07-like viruses cause fatal disease in pigs and wild boar, whereas attenuated strains induce infections with various levels of chronic illness. Sensing cytosolic dsDNA, mainly by the key DNA sensor cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), leads to the synthesis of type I interferon and involves signaling through STING, TBK1, and IRF3. After phosphorylation, STING translocates from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi compartment and to the perinuclear region, acting as an indispensable adaptor connecting the cytosolic detection of DNA to the TBK1-IRF3 signaling pathway. We demonstrate here that attenuated NH/P68, but not virulent Armenia/07, activates the cGAS-STING-IRF3 cascade very early during infection, inducing STING phosphorylation and trafficking through a mechanism involving cGAMP. Both TBK1 and IRF3 are subsequently activated and, in response to this, a high level of beta interferon (IFN-\u2424) was produced during NH/P68 infection; in contrast, Armenia/07 infection generated IFN-\u2424 levels below those of uninfected cells. Our results show that virulent Armenia/07 ASFV controls the cGAS-STING pathway, but these mechanisms are not at play when porcine macrophages are infected with attenuated NH/P68 ASFV. These findings show for the first time the involvement of the cGAS-STING-IRF3 route in ASFV infection, where IFN-\u2424 production or inhibition was found after infection by attenuated or virulent ASFV strains, respectively, thus reinforcing the idea that ASFV virulence versus attenuation may be a phenomenon grounded in ASFV-mediated innate immune modulation where the cGAS-STING pathway might play an important role. IMPORTANCE African swine fever, a devastating disease for domestic pigs and wild boar, is currently spreading in Europe, Russia, and China, becoming a global threat with huge economic and ecological consequences. One interesting aspect of ASFV biology is the molecular mechanism leading to high virulence of some strains compared to more attenuated strains, which produce subclinical infections. In this work, we show that the presently circulating virulent Armenia/07 virus blocks the synthesis of IFN-\u2424, a key mediator between the innate and adaptive immune response. Armenia/07 inhibits the cGAS-STING pathway by impairing STING activation during infection. In contrast, the cGAS-STING pathway is efficiently activated during NH/P68 attenuated strain infection, leading to the production of large amounts of IFN-\u2424. Our results show for the first time the relationship between the cGAS-STING pathway and ASFV virulence, contributing to uncover the molecular mechanisms of ASFV virulence and to the rational development of ASFV vaccines. 2 ASFV Virulent Strain Controls cGAS-STING Pathway Journal of Virology FIG 2 Effect of NH/P68 and Armenia/07 infection on STING and IRF3 phosphorylation.

Figure 1A shows a higher production of IFN-\u2424 mRNA in cells infected with NH/P68 compared to those infected with Armenia/07, starting at 4 hpi with a maximum at 16 hpi, a time point where IFN-\u2424 mRNA was very low in cells infected with Armenia/07. Interestingly, we observed a significant increase of IFN-\u2424 mRNA in cells infected with NH/P68 from 4 to 16 hpi, indicating that cellular signaling leading to IFN-\u2424 transcription is activated during the course of the infection with the attenuated virus. Next, the amount of IFN-\u2424 secreted during attenuated versus virulent infections was determined. Supernatants from either NH/P68-or Armenia/07-infected macrophages were collected, and IFN-\u2424 levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Fig. 1B) . The results show a strong decrease of secreted IFN-\u2424 at 16 hpi, after an initial increase at 8 hpi, during the infection with the virulent strain, whereas in NH/P68-infected macrophages the amount of IFN-\u2424 increases over time. These data correlate well with the results obtained regarding IFN-\u2424 mRNA production (Fig. 1A ). This indicates that virulent ASFV shuts down the IFN-\u2424 synthesis pathway several hours after infection (Fig. 1A) , although IFN-\u2424 mRNA production is significantly above the control level at 4 hpi. This effect also translates to IFN-\u2424 cytokine production, which initially increases and is totally abolished at 16 hpi, when macrophages are infected with virulent ASFV (Fig. 1B) .",

These differently timed messenger RNAs are the products of viral genes whose transcription is regulated before or after viral DNA replication (8) . In order to determine at what step of the Armenia/07 replication the cGAS-STING route is blocked, we used cytosine arabinoside (AraC), an inhibitor of viral DNA replication, widely used to prevent the expression of late ASFV genes (8) . In order to determine whether the cGAS-STING inhibition produced by Armenia/07 occurs at early or late times of ASFV replication, we infected alveolar macrophages in the presence or absence of AraC and analyzed the phosphorylation of both STING and IRF3. The results showed that the cGAS-STING pathway inhibition by Armenia/07 occurs at a time point prior to the replication of viral DNA. No phosphorylation of STING and IRF3 was observed in the presence of AraC (Fig. 5 ), indicating that early viral genes and/or gene products are involved in this inhibition exerted by the virulent ASFV strain.",

As observed in Fig. 7A , cGAMP-treated cells and cells infected with NH/P68 show STING localization in punctuate perinuclear structures (or microsomes; highlighted by arrows). STING localization in microsomes indicates its activation and has been described as necessary for further activation of downstream components of the STING pathway (34) . In contrast, cells infected with Armenia/07 present a more diffuse STING distribution pattern throughout the cytoplasm, similar to that found in mock-infected cells. The latter results indicate a nonactivation status of STING and confirms the small amount of p-STING we found during Armenia/07 infection (Fig. 2C ). Both Armenia/07 and NH/P68 infections were confirmed by the presence of viral factories, which are stained by DAPI (4=,6=-diamidino-2-phenylindole) as small DNA accumulations next to the cell nucleus (arrowheads). We quantified STING distribution pattern in infected cells, which were identified by the presence of viral factories. This analysis revealed that in more than 80% of NH/P68-infected cells STING is localized in punctuated perinuclear microsome structures (Fig. 7B ).

This colocalization degree strongly increases if quantification is restricted to cells where STING is activated, forming punctuate structures (Fig. 9A , see arrows, and Fig. 9C ). These data emphasize that STING activates and traffics through the TGN during both Armenia/07 and NH/P68 infection at the very early time of 1 hpi. However, the STING-AP1 colocalization significantly decreased at 6 hpi and more specifically in Armenia/07-versus NH/P68-infected cells, as shown in Fig. 9B and C. Altogether, these results suggest that whereas both virulent and attenuated ASFV strains trigger the cGAS-STING pathway at very early times postinfection, Armenia/07 is able to inhibit STING activation during later times of infection, thus impairing its activation and traffic to perinuclear microsomes.",

One ASFV strain is NH/P68, a nonfatal, naturally occurring, nonhaemadsorbing virus, isolated from a chronically infected pig (36) , and the other ASFV strain is Armenia/07, a highly virulent virus currently circulating in Europe, Russia, and China (37) . Our results demonstrate that whereas Armenia/07 inhibits the synthesis of IFN-\u2424 (and its dependent genes IFIT-1 and CXCL10) by inhibiting IRF3 activation and STING phosphorylation, NH/P68 does not. Infection of porcine alveolar macrophages with NH/P68 results in (i) the induction of significant levels of IFN-\u2424, (ii) phosphorylation of STING, (iii) traffic of STING through the Golgi to perinuclear punctuated structures, and (iv) localization of IRF3 to the nuclear soluble fraction and binding to chromatin. Furthermore, inhibition of cGAS by the specific inhibitor Ru521 (30) impairs NH/P68-induced STING phosphorylation, suggesting that cGAS is the main DNA sensor activating the STING cascade by the attenuated ASFV NH/P68 isolate. In contrast, cGAMP-induced phosphorylation of STING was prevented by infection of cells with Armenia/07. Also, STING trafficking to perinuclear punctuated structures was severely impaired in Armenia/07-infected cells, indicating that the virulent ASFV strain prevents the activation and trafficking of STING.",

Similarly, when IFN-\u2423 and IFN-\u2424 were analyzed in sera from animals infected with virulent ASFV strains (42, 43) , induction of IFN-\u2423 and IFN-\u2424 was observed, which was attributed to cytokine production by non-ASFV-susceptible cells.

One possible explanation would be that virulent strain may encode genes functionally homologous to type I IFN receptors as has been described for vaccinia and other poxvirus (44) , in such a way that the produced IFN is \"neutralized\" at this time point of the virulent infection (8 hpi), impairing the activation of IFN-dependent genes.",

Importantly, early after infection the cGAS-STING pathway was induced by both attenuated and virulent ASFV, but later on, was effectively inhibited only by virulent Armenia/07. Our data reveal a clear correlation between ASFV virulence and virus ability to inhibit the cGAS-STING pathway. Similar results have been obtained with vaccinia virus, an ASFV-related, dsDNA cytoplasmic virus. The attenuated modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) induces IFN-\u2424 in infected cells via the activation of the cGAS-STING pathway (46) , while virulent vaccinia strains prevent cGAS-STING activation and hence IFN-\u2424 production in infected cells (47) . Our results, therefore, reinforce the idea that ASFV virulence versus attenuation, two concepts controversially discussed in the ASFV field, may be phenomena associated with the control of the cGAS-STING pathway.",

Using the viral DNA replication inhibitor AraC, we showed that STING phosphorylation is impaired by Armenia/07 in the presence of AraC, thus involving events happening before viral DNA replication. In contrast, STING phosphorylation is triggered as early as 1 h after NH/P68 infection and leads to the phosphorylation of IRF3, a transcription factor regulating IFN-\u2424 synthesis (31) . The different time points at which IRF3 is phosphorylated during attenuated versus virulent strains suggest that a faster transition between activated STING and phosphorylated IRF3 occurs during virulent strain infection. Phosphorylated IRF3 then translocates to the nucleus and binds to the chromatin fraction to induce IFN-\u2424 production. The latter happens during NH/P68 infection, whereas during Armenia/07 infection, IRF3 was not phosphorylated and consequently absent from the nuclear and chromatin fractions of the infected cells. Interestingly, it has been recently reported (48) that STING phosphorylation is required to further activate IRF3.",

It has been described that various viruses can act at different levels to counteract the IFN-\u2424 activation pathway (45) . Here, we show that virulent Armenia/07 is able to counteract cGAMP-dependent STING activation, even in the presence of exogenous cGAMP. However, alternative inhibition modes exerted by Armenia/07 or by other virulent ASFV strains cannot be excluded, and future experiments are planned to assess this interesting possibility.",

            "text": "It is remarkable that the activation of STING, after phosphorylation and dimerization, involves trafficking from the ER through the Golgi compartment to perinuclear punctuated structures, called microsomes (33, 34, 63) . Significantly, STING appears in these microsomes in most of the NH/P68-infected cells at 6 hpi, whereas at that time postinfection with Armenia/07, STING is mainly found throughout the cytoplasm. Transit of STING through the Golgi, prior to its translocation into microsomes, has been shown to be a key event for STING activation, since STING undergoes posttranslational modifications and interaction with molecules such as TBK1 (34, 64) . Therefore, to further assess the virulence mechanism of ASFV, we investigated whether the transit of STING through the Golgi is blocked during Armenia/07 infection, as reported for other viruses such as HSV-1 or human cytomegalovirus (57, 65) . At very early times after both NH/P68 and Armenia/07 infection, STING traffics through the TGN in a similar manner than in cGAMP-treated cells, while at 6 hpi this traffic is prevented in Armenia/07-infected cells but not in NH/P68-infected cells, thus impairing the ability of STING to reach microsomes. These results suggest that at very early times of infection, STING is activated in both NH/P68 and in Armenia/07 infected cells, but several hours later, the virulent ASFV strain is able to block activation of STING.",

From the results presented here, possible viral gene candidates could be very early genes, such as products of the so-called multigene families (66) . In this regard, very recently, studies in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells, have postulated that the transfected DP96R gene of the Chinese virulent strain 2018/1 could have a role in the control of the cGAS-STING pathway (24) . However, these results should be discussed cautiously, since (i) HEK cells are not susceptible to ASFV infection and (ii) these studies have not been performed in the context of an active ASFV infection. In addition, the DP96R gene is present and identical in both attenuated and virulent strains of the same genotype, such as NH/P68 and Ba71 (both genotype I) and has 98% identity between attenuated and virulent strains of different genotypes, such as NH/P68 (genotype I) and Armenia/07 (genotype II). Therefore, the experiments performed above with DP96R most likely do not explain the differences in the cGAS-STING pathway modulation exerted by virulent and attenuated ASFV strains.",
