Although medical institutions were the most identifiable sources of MERS transmission in South Korea, similar to other countries, in-depth epidemiological investigation was required for some confirmed cases with indefinite contact history or hospital visit records. The subject of epidemiological investigation in the present study was a 35 year-old male patient diagnosed with MERS (#119) who lived in Asan-city and worked in Pyeongtaek-city. Various potential sources of transmission were carefully investigated. While he could have been exposed to MERS through a friend from Saudi Arabia or confirmed MERS cases in his workplace, neighboring areas, and medical institutions, as well as contacts in his home, the chances of transmission were low; however, the potential for transmission through his local community could not be excluded. Practically, it was difficult to determine the modes of transmission for all outbreak cases in communicable disease that occurred in this short period of time. The investigation to identify the mode of transmission in this case was ultimately unsuccessful. However, the various data collected and analyzed to reveal modes of transmission provided detailed information that could not be collected using only interview surveys.",

The patient lived in the Asan area, Chungcheongnam-do, a neighboring area of Pyeongtaek-city. Case #119 met Friend A, who had returned from Saudi Arabia, on May 27 and May 28. He ate sumac chicken for lunch on May 31, and developed symptoms including fever (38.1\u00b0C), hot flashes, myalgia, and dyspepsia; he visited the emergency room of the Good Samaritan Bagae Hospital (GSBH) around 11:00 pm on the same day, and returned home. GSBH suspected these symptoms to be MERS, and notified the Asan-city Community Health Center, which collected sputum specimens the next day (June 1) for testing at the Chungnam Institute of Health Environment. On June 3, based on the positive PCR test results of samples from #119, the patient was hospitalized in the isolation unit of the Seoul Medical Center (SMC). However, PCR tests perform ed on sputum specimens collected from #119 on June 3 (the day of admission to SMC) by the KCDC were negative, and he returned home on June 4. Nevertheless, he was hospitalized at Asan Chungmu Hospital (ACH) from June 5 to June 9 for persisting fever and chest discomfort, and was transferred to the Dankook University Hospital (DKUH) on June 9 due a lack of improvement of his pneumonia symptoms, where he was treated in the isolation unit. Sputum samples collected on June 10 by the KCDC tested positive by PCR, confirming that #119 was positive for MERS. Despite an exacerbation of acute respiratory distress syndrome, #119 was completely cured and discharged on July 19 ( Figure 1 ).",

The movements of #119 were investigated in detail during this time period based on job records, credit card use records, and cellular phone location tracing data. According to the MERS epidemiological investigation report, 14 patients (#1, #6, #13, #14, #15, #16, #17, #18, #25, #32, #36, #75, #76, and #85) transmitted infections to at least one other person. These patients were considered to have high chances to cause community-acquired infections. Five of these confirmed MERS patients (#13, #14, #18, #25, and #32) were investigated because their possible periods of transmission overlapped with the suspected MERS exposure period of #119 and they were physically close to the main activity area of #119. Mapping based on the time of suspected transmission and spatial movement of #119 and the confirmed MERS patients found that no confirmed MERS patients spatially and temporally overlapped with #119 ( Figure 2 ). Interviews revealed that #14 mostly traveled by car and rarely walked on the main street; similarly, #18 and #25 were expected to have limited outdoor activities due to severe infection symptoms between May 17 and May 29. Although #32 had visited a clinic located in a building next to a restaurant where #119 visited, the timing of visits did not overlap. In addition, on-site investigation performed based on the potential for #119 and #32 to meet by accident in the building revealed that the building had a structure that made it less likely for clinic traffic to overlap with that of neighboring restaurants.",

The most likely onset date of MERS symptoms in #119 was May 31, corresponding to a suspected exposure date between May 17 and May 29. Although it was possible that #119 was infected with MERS during the meeting with Friend A on May 27 and May 28, after Friend A returned from Saudi Arabia, Friend A had no respiratory symptoms other than sore throat; two sputum PCR tests and a serological test were negative, so it was unlikely that #119 was infected by Friend A. The chances of #119 being infected in either his workplace in the Pyeongtaek Police Station or by his family in Asan-city were extremely low. Also, the chance that #119 had had contact with #22 or #55 in GSBH was extremely low. However, #119 had no record of clinic or hospital visits during the suspected exposure period, and confirmed MERS patients had moved around without knowing the facts of their own infection in Pyeongtaek-city and Asan-city, and then it was impossible to completely reconstruct the spatial and temporal movements of #119 and other confirmed MERS patients; thus, the chance of community-acquired infection could not be completely excluded. In addition, #119 had a relatively higher chance of contact with confirmed MERS patients in the local community of Pyeongtaek-city where there were more confirmed MERS patients than in Asan-city; thus, it is possible that #119 was infected in the main street near the Pyeongtaek Police Station, or the workplace. The area surrounding the police station corresponds to the downtown of Pyeongtaek-city, with many floating populations, and #119 often visited this area during off-hours, according to credit card use records and cellular phone location tracing data. However, his movements while his cellular phone and credit card were not in use were not identified, during which #119 might have had contact with confirmed MERS patients. Nevertheless, the temporal and spatial uncertainty made it im-possible to determine where and with which patients #119 had contact.",

However, it is imperative to test various hypotheses while collecting and analyzing every possible data through on-site investigations that consider various possible modes of transmission. Finally, in cases of massive outbreaks of communicable disease, data acquisition systems are necessary to systematically collect various data in addition to interview surveys and professionals who can rapidly analyze the data and make decisions in order to more effectively identify modes of transmission and prevent transmission.",

            "text": "Based on an assumption that the result of the sputum polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test on June 1 was a false-positive, we investigated the possibility that #119 was infected at SMC, where he was hospitalized between June 3 and June 4, resulting in positive sputum PCR results on June 10. Re-inspection of the SMC found that no MERS patient was previously hospitalized in the lowpressure unit where #119 stayed, and he was completely isolated from four other confirmed MERS patients in terms of movements and areas visited during the hospitalization period.In addition, if the findings of pneumonia at Asan Chungmu Hospital (ACH) on June 5 were assumed to be symptoms of MERS, the incubation period for #119 was 1 to 2 days. Moreover, since #119 was identified as having transmitted MERS to #163 at ACH between June 5 and 7, it is possible that this periods were transmittable symptomatic periods. Therefore, if it is assumed that the sputum PCR result from June 1 was a false-positive, then #119 was infected between June 3 and 4, and the date of symptom onset was between June 5 and 7; thus, the incubation period of #119 could be from 1 to 4 days. Considering that the point estimator of the median MERS incubation period is 6.83 days, with 5th and 95th percentiles of 2.27 and 13.48 days, respectively, the incubation period of #119 based on these assumptions is too short [A01]. In addition, since it is unusual for MERS to be transmitted immediately after onset of symptoms, the chance that #119 was infected at the SMC was extremely low. In addition, #119 complained of fever and chest discomfort at Asan Chungmu Hospital, where he was hospitalized from June 5, and chest radiography revealed pneumonia in the right lung. Antibiotic treatment after his admission had no effect, with his fever persisting and pneumonia progressing; therefore, the onset date of his MERS symptoms were likely before June 5. Therefore, hypotheses 1 and 2 (based on false positive sputum PCR findings on June 1) were not the most likely explanation. Therefore, a true positive sputum PCR result on June 1, as assumed in hypothesis 3, is a more reasonable explanation for transmission between June 5 and 7. In conclusion, June 1 appears to be the most likely date for confirmation of the diagnosis.Although #119 showed symptoms including fever, myalgia, and dyspepsia when he was admitted to Good Samaritan Bagae Hospital on May 31, he did not have urticaria; thus, his symptoms were more consistent with those of infection than with allergy due to consumption of sumac chicken. If June 1 is considered to be the date of confirmed diagnosis, it is reasonable to consider May 31 to be the date of symptom onset based on the clinical progress -infection, symptom onset, diagnosis.
