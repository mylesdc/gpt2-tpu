In colostrum-deprived PRRSV-infected isolator piglets, this results in hypergammaglobulinemia, which we believe to be a \"red herring\" that detracts attention from the thymic atrophy story, but leads to our second independent hypothesis. Since hypergammaglobulinemia has not been reported in PRRSV-infected conventionally-reared piglets, we hypothesize that this is due to the down-regulatory effect of passive maternal IgG and cytokines in porcine colostrum, especially TGF\u03b2 which stimulates development of regulatory T cells (Tregs).",

It is considered responsible for an annual 660 million dollar loss to the pork industry in the USA alone with proportionally similar loses in other countries (1; Lager this volume). The disease is a pandemic and \u223c25 years of research has yet to clearly define the immune pathology that allows the virus to persist in young pigs for up to 150 dpi (1) . Therefore, we believe it is time to offer a testable hypothesis to explain the immune pathogenesis and persistence of PRRS in the belief that combating the PRRS pandemic and engineering vaccines depend on identifying the cause of the immune dysregulation. We believe that attenuated viral vaccines will have limited success unless they prevent infection of thymic antigen presenting cells (TAPCs) during the period in which the T cell repertoire is being developed.",

The virus is trophic for macrophages and dendritic cells, whereon, CD163 serve as a receptor (2) and when deleted, prevents macrophages infection (3) . As indicated by the name, Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) causes both fetal abortion and respiratory disease. Neonates are especially susceptible to viral and bacterial pathogens, because they encounter them during a critical period in development. The situation with PRRS is made more difficult in Class III Artiodactyls like swine (4, 5) because the virus can cross the placenta but protective maternal antibodies or cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) cannot. The mechanism of placental transfer of the virus is unclear, but may involve infected macrophages as is the case with LDV (6) . Transfer may be facilitated by virus-induced apoptosis at the maternalfetal interface (7) . In any case, the primary target in fetuses is the thymus (8) . Not surprisingly, fetal piglets develop the same features of immune dysregulation as seen in isolator piglets (9, 10) . In contrast to piglets, infected adult swine make effective VN antibodies and can eliminate the infection (11) and VN antibodies from convalescent sows experimentally administered to piglets provide sterilizing immunity (12) . These observation indicate that PRRS is a fetal/ newborn disease that strikes during the Critical Window of Immunological Development (13) .",

More recent observations support this view (18) (19) (20) (21) . Co-infection studies using swine influenza (SIV), porcine circovirus Type 2 (PCV-2), Salmonella choleraesuis, Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, and Streptococcus suis all result in prolonged fever and respiratory distress in PRRSV-infected piglets compared to controls infected with these pathogens alone. Twenty of 22 PRRS piglets co-infected with S. suis died, but only 5 of 23 infected with S. suis (22) . Anti-PRRSV antibodies can be detected 6-14 dpi (22, 23) but VN antibodies do not appear before 28 dpi or later (24, 25) , reminiscent of lymphocyte choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infections in mice (26) . Thus, the lack of VN antibodies when they are most needed, is one feature of this persistent viral disease. These observations collectively suggest that PRRSV infection induces immune suppression, i.e., neonatal immune dysregulation. This seems consistent with the acute lymphopenia after infection (27) (28) (29) (30) although this can also occurs in many infectious diseases as monocytes and lymphocytes translocate from blood to hard tissue sites.",

Figure 1 shows that IgG levels are elevated \u223c20fold and IgA and IgM levels are elevated 10-fold in PRRSVinfected piglets vs. littermates infected with SIV and PCV-2. While data on serum Ig levels in conventionally-reared piglets is limited, there are no reports of hypergammaglobulinemia. In any case, comparison of conventionally-reared piglets with isolator piglets indicates that IgG, IgM, and IgA levels in serum during hypergammaglobulinemia are circa 2-fold higher than in conventionally-reared piglets (Figure 1 , note double arrows).

This decrease in CD21 + B cells has also been observed in PRRSV-infected conventional piglets (25, 28, 29) . In isolator piglets this results in a 5-fold increase in circulating B cells and high levels of Ig producing cells in secondary lymphoid tissues compared to infection with SIV and PCV-2. This increase is especially notable 3 weeks after infection and is inversely correlated with a shift from CD4 + CD8 \u2212 \u03b1\u03b2 T cells to double positive (DP) T cells (see later). We believe that rapid differentiation in the B cell compartment of PRRSV-infected isolator piglets explains the hypergammaglobulinemia of all isotypes (Figure 1) . Such a rapid differentiation process would seem to leave little time for effective germinal center (GC) activity in lymph nodes that require virusspecific helper T cells to select B cells with high affinity BCRs for PRRSV epitopes. The polyclonal expansion of the major V\u03b2 families suggests that the extraordinary B cell expansion must be is driven by non-specific helper T cells rather than the few that are virus-specific (34) .",

Thus, germline B cell populations that differentiate to AFC cells do so with limited selection for antigen specificity. This is supported by comparative spectratypic studies of the CDR3 region of heavy chain variable region genes (HVCDR3). These show that the HVCDR3 spectrum in PRRSV-infected piglets resembles the unselected spectrum of germfree piglets whereas that for SIV and PCV-2 infected piglets shows selection of specific clones (34) . Analyses of VDJ sequences from PRRSV-infected piglets display the strongly hydrophobic characteristic of an undiversified antibody repertoire [(36, 37) ; Figure 3B ]. An analysis of >415 HVCDR3 sequences showed that when examined in a hydropathicity profile, 92 sequences from PRRSV-infected piglet gave peaks at 0.4 and 0.7 which most resembled newborn piglets whereas in adults and SIV-infected controls, the index shifted to 0.1-0.3 2 | Analysis of lymphoid cells and B lymphocyte subsets from the bronchio-alveolar lavage following infections of isolator piglets with PRRSV VR-2332 strain and SIV.

While lymphopenia, lack of VN antibodies and hypergammaglobulinemia are symptoms of immune dysregulation, these alone are unlikely to be the cause of viral persistence. Rather there is a more compelling feature of PRRSV pathology which dates to the earliest observations on PRRSV-induced pathology that identified the thymus as one of the target organs (8, 22) and in extreme cases, reported its complete absence (41, 42) . This correlated with a delayed antibody response and a decrease in helper cell-associated IL-4 (42) . Thymus atrophy (Figures 4A,C) can explain PRRS-related lymphopenia (27, 28, 30, 42) and its severity is directly correlated with strain virulence (44, 46) . Immunohistochemical studies indicate that thymocytes are undergoing apoptosis ( Figure 4F ) and flow cytometric studies show that DP thymocytes are depleted (Figures 5A,B) . Depletion of DP thymocytes is greatest with the highly virulent HuN4 strain ( Figure 5B ) which explains why the relative proportion of immature CD4 + and CD8 + cells in the thymus is elevated (44) . Histological studies show that the PRRSV nuclear antigen is localized to CD14 + thymic cells [ Figure 4G ; (45) ]. The latter observation is not surprising since PRRSV infects monocyte lineage cells and there is no evidence that cells other than TAPCs are involved in thymocyte development (53, 54) . DP thymocytes are a focal point in the process of T cell \"selection and education\" so that damaging or deleting them through interaction with infected TAPCs would almost certainly affect the emerging T cell repertoire and its ability to recognize foreign epitopes including those of viral and other pathogens. Figure 5C shows that thymocyte depletion in PRRSV-infected piglets does indeed produces \"holes\" in the T cell repertoire. Thus, a deficiency of peripheral helper T cells due to loss of precursors CD4 + CD8 + thymocytes, even if random, could explain the delay in the appearance of high affinity antibodies that can neutralize PRRSV. Interestingly there are no reports of thymic atrophy or lymph node adenopathy in EAV and this arterivirus infection is typically resolved without persistence in contrast to PRRS (55) . There are no reports of thymic atrophy in PCV-2 and SIV and as shown in Figure 1 , these infection in isolator piglets are not associated with hypergammaglobulinemia.",

This decrease is also seen in PRRSV-infected conventionally-reared piglets (28, 29, 43) especially using highly pathogenic strains (HP-PRRSV). Infection with both mild and HP-PRRSV strains also results in a decrease in CD8\u03b1 + \u03b3/\u03b4 T cells. In both PRRS isolator piglets and conventional piglets, there is a sharp rise in CD4 + CD8 + \u03b1/\u03b2 T cells after 21-28 dpi. These peripheral DP cells, that express CD8\u03b1, have been regarded as either \"activated\" or \"memory\" helper T cells. The kinetics of the reciprocal decrease in CD4 + and increase in these DP \u03b1/\u03b2 T cells might suggest this is merely a phenotypic/differentiation event in the same CD4 + T cells which may reflects a change in function. The increase in DP helper T cells parallels the increase in CD2 + CD21 \u2212 AFC in the BAL suggesting they may drive terminal differentiation of B cells at this site, resulting primarily in IgA + cells (34) .",

During the Critical Window of Immunological Development (13) , the offspring's immune system makes numerous decisions regarding how to respond to environmental and self-antigens and these depend heavily on the action of T cells. Therefore, any impairment of T cell development can impact both antibody and CTL development and function. There are several scenarios. First, PRRSV-infected TAPCs mediate random apoptosis of developing DP thymocytes including those that recognize all foreign epitopes including those of PRRSV and other pathogens. A second possibility is that the infected TAPCs present PRRSV PRRSV infected pigs with high-pathogenic strain HuN4 and low-pathogenic strain CD-1a shows that CD4 + CD8 + thymocytes of \u03b1\u03b2 lineage are depleted after PRRSV infection depending on their pathogenicity (44) . Asterisks (* and **) denote significance at the 0.05 and 0.01 levels, respectively. (C) Analysis of peripheral \u03b1\u03b2 T cells by CDR3 length analysis (52) of T cell repertoire (TCRBV) isolated from peripheral blood (indicated by P) and Broncho alveolar lavage (indicated by L) from piglets infected with the VR-2332 strain is also shown.

The mechanisms of DP elimination is the same as used in central tolerance induction. Such thymocytes deletion would be selective and dependent on the affinity of their TCR for particular PRRSV epitopes. A third possibility is that some elements of both mechanisms operate simultaneously to impair the ability of developing piglets to recognize PRRSV and other pathogens.",

The random depletion model is consistent with the increased susceptibility of piglets to other pathogens (14) (15) (16) (17) , and can explain why there are sufficient non-specific T cells to aid polyclonal B cell activation (9, 34) . However, it cannot easily explain why panspecific and anti-nucleocapsid (NC) responses are normal (23, 56) while VN antibody responses are consistently delayed (57) . The last pattern is a better fit for the second scenario in that thymocytes with TCRs that tightly bind VN epitopes are deleted but not those to NC epitopes and others which bind poorly. It is well known that thymocytes with low affinity TCRs survive \"thymic education.\" In normal individuals, these comprise the autoreactive T cell subset. In our hypothesis and scenario, they are the DP thymocytes that bind poorly to NP T cell epitopes.

This includes T cells able to help in the selection and proliferation of B cells with high affinity BCRs for VN epitopes. If thymocyte loss occurs in adult animals, it would be too late to seriously impair the T cell repertoire.

However, thymic atrophy and apoptosis is increased in AIDS, rabies, hepatitis, pestiviruses in cattle and swine and especially parasitic diseases (58) (59) (60) (61) (62) . Infection of the mouse thymus by highly virulent influenza can also cause thymic atrophy (63) . Similar to PRRS, thymic atrophy is positively correlated with virulence but interestingly in Chagas disease, a non-virulent strain of the parasite does not induce thymic atrophy (64) . In most cases, the thymic epithelium is infected or damaged and elements of the extra-cellular matrix, e.g., laminin, collagen, etc. are deposited in higher than normal amounts. In parasitic infections and AIDS, macrophages and DCs are infected, similar to what is described for the TAPCs in PRRS.",

While this has not been measured for IgM and IgA, the lack of variable region diversity in PRRS (34, 36, 37) predicts it would affect all isotypes. The phenomenon seems to be the work of non-specific T cells including those promoting isotype switch (67) and has been observed for other viruses (68) (69) (70) . While perhaps driven by LCMV, HIV-1, trypanosomes and PRRSV, class-switch recombination in swine occurs even during mid-gestation in the absence of environmental antigen or infection (71) .

This subject was treated by Montes et al. (68) and the phenomenon summarized below. On the negative side, polyclonal B cell activation can be a distractive mechanism triggered by pathogens to lower the probability for pathogens to encounter a pathogen-specific B cell. On the positive side, it causes the production of natural antibodies that have a broad range of specificities, although their affinity for any particular pathogen might be low (37) . Either scenario requires the host to expend energy to produce antibodies that are poorly designed to neutralize or eliminate the pathogen. Since polyclonal B cell activation appears to parallel a deficiency of antigen-specific T cells, it suggests that the phenomenon reflects a kind of \"desperation\" by the host, or \"all-out-war\" in hopes that the pathogenic threat can be handled using the \"brute force\" of natural antibodies.",

One characteristic of arteriviruses is the production of autoantibodies to NP and the Golgi apparatus (9, 40) . Establishing central tolerance depends on thymic TAPCs which in PRRS, are virus-infected. Hence, their ability to present antigen to the developing DP thymocytes may be impaired, allowing self-reactive T cells to leave the thymus along with those that consider PRRSV as \"self.\" Self-reactive B cells are de-selected in bone marrow during B cell lymphogenesis but unlike T cells, can be somatically generated throughout life. Nevertheless, their expansion and differentiation still depends on antigen-specific T cells.

            "text": "While investigators studying PRRSV infections in conventional piglets regularly report polyclonal B cell activation and lymph node adenopathy (75) , none report the hypergammaglobulinemia seen in isolator piglets (Figure 1) . Rather, limited and unpublished data suggest that IgG levels in PRRS after 4 weeks are similar to the norm reported for healthy piglets of the same age (Figure 1 ; see double arrows). The paucity of data on this point may be because investigators decided that hypergammaglobulinemia would be masked in conventionally reared piglets that ingested a bolus of maternal colostrum. This would be true if measurements were made before 25 days after birth but would no longer be true 4 weeks postpartum (PP) when >95% of serum Ig in piglets is of de novo origin (Figure 6) . The alternative and more plausible explanation is that hypergammaglobulinemia is weak, absent or easily overlooked in PRRSV-infected conventionally-reared piglets. Unlike isolator piglets, they receive colostrum. Therefore, it is less interesting to speculate on what causes polyclonal B cell activation in PRRSV-infected isolator piglets and in other infections, than to address the question as to why polyclonal B cell activation does not progress to hypergammaglobulinemia in PRRSV-infected conventionally-reared piglets. This question is the basis of our second hypothesis.",

            "text": "A clue as to why hypergammaglobulinemia has not been reported in conventionally-reared piglets comes from work done 30-40 year ago (76) . In these older studies, delaying suckling at 6 h intervals during the first 24 h. Postpartum (PP) resulted in a progressive decrease in the amount of maternal Igs that enter the blood of newborn specific pathogen free (SPF) piglets ( Figure 6A ). This occurs because gut closure starts at birth and progressively increases so by 24 h. PP only fragments of maternal IgG can be found in serum (77) . Over the same period, the concentration of Igs in porcine colostrum progressively decreases from >90 mg/ml at birth to< 20 mg/ml at 24 h (78). In SPF piglets given a bovine-based milk replacer (MR) de novo Ig synthesis is spontaneous, apparently due to non-pathogenic environmental stimuli. At day 20 PP, 50% of serum IgG is of de novo origin, and this rises to 81% on day 25 PP and >95% on day 30 PP. Hence, at 4 weeks PP, virtually all serum Igs are of de novo origin. Figure 6B shows that de novo synthesis of IgG, IgM, and IgA after 4 weeks PP in suckling SPF piglets is inversely proportional to the amount of maternal IgG absorbed from colostrum (76) . Since other factors in colostrum might explain this results, SPF piglets were reared in an autosow facility and raised on maternal colostrum or a bovine-based milk replacer (MR) to which purified swine IgG was added in various amounts. Figure 7 shows that the level of serum IgG after 8 weeks in piglets that received only the MR were two-fold higher that animals receiving colostrum and that administration of just 3 g total of purified swine IgG, reduced the level of de novo synthesis to that seen in piglets receiving colostrum [(76); Figure 6A vs. B]. Three grams is only 20% of the amount of IgG that is provided in colostrum, yet it is enough to suppress de novo synthesis to the level seen in piglets receiving porcine colostrum. The spontaneous increase in de novo IgG synthesis in piglets receiving only the MR was not associated with any clinical disease. IgG dependent down-regulation of B cell activity is well-documented (79, 80) and has been explained as idiotypic network regulation (81) (82) (83) (84) . The T15 idiotypic system has been described for those wishing to test the idiotypic regulation hypothesis in swine (85) . It is noteworthy that piglets reared on the MR were ingesting and absorbing large amounts of all bovine Igs (86) , yet this bovine IgG did not suppress de novo Ig synthesis in these piglets, an observation consistent with the view that few idiotypes cross species lines.",

All are major modulators of T cell activity and are delivered in large amounts to the newborn where they mediate the transformation of helper T cells into regulatory T cells (Tregs). Once referred to as \"suppressor T cells, \" these Tregs secrete both IL-10 and TGF\u03b2 that control B cell activation and expansion.

Currently, investigators appear stuck on the very first step of the scientific method, i.e., the accumulation of phenomena such as thymic atrophy. We believed that construction of a testable hypothesis could help others to characterize the mechanism of PRRS-induced immune dysregulation and pathogenesis. We believe that the continued development of subunit vaccines or those based on attenuated virus, will remain a partial fix until the mechanism of immune dysregulation is known. Thus, we encourage PRRS investigators to design and perform experiments like those described in the next section of this article that can address critical tenets of our hypothesis. Should our hypothesis be confirmed, namely that the PRRSV interferes with development of the T cell repertoire in a manner that prevents the piglet from recognizing neonatal pathogens, it could shift emphasis to development of vaccines or other treatments that block this interference. Given that older animals develop sterilizing immunity, \"holding the block\" on the CD163 receptor on TAPCs or disrupting it until the piglet can complete development of their normal T cell repertoire, would be a step in the right direction.",

The 1st round PCR targeted the original cDNA preparation while the 2nd round PCR targeted the 1st round PCR products. After checking PCR product on 1.5% agarose gels stained by GelRed, the diversity of the V\u03b2 CDR3 regions was inspected by CDR3 length analyses. Technically, the second round of PCR products for each V\u03b2 superfamily was subjected to the 3rd round of PCR that involved incorporation of radioactive adenosine 5'-ATP \u03b3-32P triphosphate nucleotide labeled C\u03b2 primer (34) . The products were separated on sequencing gels that were subsequently dried and their radioactive images were obtained by Storage Phosphor Screens BAS-IP MS scanned in fluorescent Image Analyser FLA-7000 (Fujifilm Corporation, Yokyo, Japan). All primers and PCR conditions used for amplifications were published earlier (34) .",
