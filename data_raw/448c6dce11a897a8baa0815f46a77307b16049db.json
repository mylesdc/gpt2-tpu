Methods have been developed to identify conserved nucleic acid regions that are common to larger groupings (lineages, serogroups, genera, or families), thereby minimizing the number of probes required and increasing the chance of detecting novel viruses. The more recent strategies for achieving this include (i) using pairwise sequence comparisons to identify conserved sequences for probes [1] [2] [3] as well as (ii) identifying specific regions from a multiple sequence alignment [4] [5] [6] . Additionally, our group developed a method for designing probes within conserved protein regions [7] .

Additionally, only a small proportion of probes are likely to hybridize if virus is present in a sample, leading to distributions with high variance. Nonparametric tests transform data into rank order or categories; this has the effect of rescaling variance and simplifying the distribution to one more easily modeled. If data variance is high or the distribution is heavily skewed, nonparametric tests are more conservative than equivalent parametric tests. What is more, nonparametric tests are valid with small sample sizes (less than 20); this is an advantage in cases where the presence of a virus is being investigated by a small number of probes. Nonparametric methods such as the Mann Whitney U test have been applied in detecting differential gene expression of by microarrays [20] .",

While an analysis by Giles and Kipling of Affymetrix arrays based on 25 nt probes indicated that the fluorescence distributions of their log-transformed probe signals were indeed close to normal (Gaussian) [37] , our experience with 60 nt probe arrays showed strong deviations from a normal distribution. Increases in RNA input have complex effects on signal distribution: the degree of skew is increased and the upper tail is lengthened (see Figure 1) . We tested the normality of these distributions and found strong deviations for all three experiments (using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, where p < 0.05). Sample distributions of fluorescent Figure S2 . The observed signal distributions included Gaussian, highly kurtotic and bimodal; host RNA concentration can only partially explain these differences. Other explanations include: a large proportion homologous probes on the array increasing the upper tail, differences in amplification or labeling efficiency from sample to sample, and differences in hybridization affinity due to guanine/cytosine proportion in viral transcripts. While more complex methods of transformation have been described elsewhere, these have focused on improving the sensitivity of transcript profiling measurements and, we surmised, were unlikely to improve sensitivities in our application. Parametric analysis of microarray data is particularly sensitive to transformations; violations of normality will lead to a loss of power, and may result in invalid p values [38] .",

            "text": "Replication of hybridization experiments can improve specificity [39] ; however, the expense incurred by processing multiple arrays or low quantities of nucleic acid in one's clinical sample may preclude the use of this approach. Alternative strategies that might be adopted include the application of either replicate probes and/or reverse complementary probes to the same array. A study using Agilent 60 nt in-situ synthesized arrays found that replicate probes were highly concordant [40] , and useful both in improving normalization and in identifying outlier signals [41] . Reverse complements have been used on spotted oligonucleotide arrays for pathogens [1] , although no quantitative assessments of their advantages have been reported up to this point. In such studies as are mentioned above, in situ synthesized oligonucleotides are immobilized at the 3' end. Probe-target helix stability near the surface is likely to be reduced due to steric hindrance. Thus, probes that are mismatched to their targets will be strongly affected by the specific mismatch position (e.g., mismatches near the 5' end will reduce the hybridization signal more than those near the 3' end [42] ).",

Thus, we measured the success of each statistical method by whether it correctly predicted the presence of a hybridized viral isolate or any other virus within the same genus. The precise number of times that the most statistically significant prediction proved to be correct was also tabulated (see Table 4 for an enumeration of both measures). Statistical analysis was carried out with coding sense probes, antisense probes, or both probe types pooled together, as independent measures of the quantity of viral nucleic acid.

The ViroChip dataset was comprised of 56 hybridizations of samples derived from tissue culture, nasal lavage or serum. The samples contained papillomavirus, influenza A virus, hepatitis B virus, respiratory syncytial virus or human rhinovirus. The ViroChip platform differs from ours in the following ways: oligonucleotide probe length (70 nt vs. 60nt), number of probes (~12,000 vs. ~30,000), fabrication method (robot spotted vs. in situ synthesis), incorporation of fluorescence (amino-allyl dUTP vs. secondary hybridization) and presence of GC-matched negative control probes. However, the ViroChip platform does include the use of reverse complement probes and employs a random-PCR based nucleic acid amplification strategy that is similar to ours. Two other methods (E-Predict [15] and DetectiV [16] ) reported a high degree of predictive accuracy when they were used to examine the same dataset. Similarly, we report having achieved a high degree of accuracy when using two nonparametric testing methods (binomial test and Mann-Whitney U) together with the same parame-ters that were used for our in-situ synthesized probe platform. We report on our performance in this instance by relying on a simple metric: the rank of the first correct prediction (see Table 5 ). The first prediction of the Mann-Whitney U test was correct in 47% of the cases; a correct prediction was present among the first ten predictions in 91% of the cases. The average correct prediction rank for the Mann-Whitney U test was 3.7. The largest number of incorrect predictions were for human herpesvirus 7 (HHV7), human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6A/B) and human herpesvirus 5 (HHV5), regardless of the sample source. The first prediction of the binomial test was correct in 75% of the cases; a correct prediction was present among the first ten predictions in 98% of the cases. The average correct prediction rank for the binomial test was 1.6. As in the Mann-Whitney U results, the majority of incorrect predictions were for HHV7. Watson et al. reported a similar false-positive result using a t-test method [16] . HHV7 has a seroprevelance of 85% in humans and can be readily detected in blood, saliva and cervical tissue [45] . The degree of prevalence suggests that the predictions represent a true co-infection; however, validation of this would require further molecular tests. Both the binomial and Mann-Whitney U methods generated statistically significant predictions for an influenza virus and RSV co-infected sample.",

In a direct assessment of the binomial and Mann-Whitney U tests on a related pathogen microarray platform, the binomial test performed comparably to other reported methods (e.g., E-Predict [15] and DetectiV [16] ). In contrast to these methods, the binomial test achieved a high degree of predictive accuracy on ranked data without probe-specific weighting parameters, iterative analysis or assumptions of normality.",
