Two different PPE systems are compared while carrying out typical laboratory work in two different temperature conditions. To be able to develop adequate working conditions for future laboratory workers in high security laboratories, it is necessary to identify previously mentioned parameters as well as indicators that duly indicate overload and error ratio. Based on these measurements a maximum reasonable working time under given circumstances shall be established. The study is conducted within the framework of the EU project \"European Research Infrastructure on Highly Pathogenic Agents (ERINHA)\" where a pan-European solution for the collection of pathogenic samples should be developed.",

In the context of healthcare and medical diagnostics the mentioned unit should enable a safe and immediate execution of autopsies and sample collection to research pathogen-host-interactions. To be able to work on pathogens causing diseases with pandemic potential as well as therapy resistant pathogens whose risk group is unknown, the laboratory should additionally be equipped with a mobile isolation unit (glovebox) and should furthermore include increased personal protection. This kind of sample collection is currently not organised but is highly relevant to determine whether mortality can be traced back to the agent or to comorbidities when diseases caused by pathogens are occurring. Furthermore important information concerning the organ specifity of pathogens, pathogenic mechanisms, as well as the body's infection defense reactions can be gained.",

This concept should be set up at the interface between the health system and high security laboratory and should be an appropriate mock-up solution for all of Europe. For this reason a mobile solution especially applicable in countries with a warmer climate (e.g. South-East-Europe, Africa) is required.

Aim of the study is to identify how wearing PPE over a longer period of time in different temperature conditions affects physical performance, individual feeling, power of concentration and error ratio (elevated environmental temperature could pose a limiting factor while working with increased personal protection). Furthermore it raises the question of which possible maximum working timeis feasible. It is to assume that raising the time limit implicates higher error ratio, followed by the fact that protective provisions can't be met, which furthermore highly increases risk of injury. For this reason it is important to identify indicators that point out loss of concentration in a timely manner.",

This study serves to determine the bodily performance, the concentration levels, error rates, and subjective well being during laboratory work in protective suits. A pilot phase is planned, in order to optimise the simulated laboratory work in glove boxes, to define the most meaningful simulated conditions (e.g., how many pipetting steps are possible in a given time, testing the logistics during the procedure), as well as to determine the relevance of the planned measurements. In the pilot phase, between 5-7 voluntary test subjects will be included. Based on the evidence from published studies regarding testing of personal protective equipment, a participant number of maximally 20 is assumed, although, due to the relatively long time required for the study, a dropout rate of about 50% is to be expected.

Immediately before and after the separate modules urine and saliva specimens are taken in order to create a metabolite profile, and the weight of the body and the equipment are measured in order to be able to calculate the loss of fluids.
