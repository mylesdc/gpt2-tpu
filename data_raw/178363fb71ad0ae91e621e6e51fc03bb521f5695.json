GNE contains an N-terminal epimerase domain and a C-terminal kinase domain [7] . The epimerase domain converts UDP-GlcNAc to Nacetylmannosamine (ManNAc), which is then phosphorylated at the 6 position by the kinase domain. GNE is feedback-inhibited by the activated form of Neu5Ac, i.e., cytidine-monophosphate Nacetylneuraminic acid (CMP-Neu5Ac). The kinase domain belongs to the ROK (Repressor, ORF, Kinase) family. The ROK family consists of a set of bacterial proteins that include repressors for sugar catabolic operons, and sugar kinases [8] .

            "text": "Three protein isoforms have been described for human GNE, where isoform 1 is ubiquitously expressed and is believed to be responsible for the basic supply of sialic acids. Isoforms 2 and 3 are generated by alternative splicing and show tissue specific expression patterns. Isoforms 2 and 3 have reduced epimerase activities but almost intact kinase activities and may fine-tune the production of sialic acids [9] . Wild type GNE forms homohexamer in solution [10] , and allosteric regulation of the epimerase and kinase activities of GNE is important for the normal function of the protein [10, 11] . Mutations in the epimerase domain lead to the rare congenital metabolism disorder sialurea, which results in the production of high levels of Neu5Ac due to loss of the allosteric feedback control of the UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase activity by CMP-Neu5Ac [12] . Late onset autosomal recessive inclusion body myopathy, which is also known as hereditary inclusion body myopathy (hereinafter referred to as HIBM), and allelic Nonaka myopathy are neuromuscular disorders that are caused by a number of different mutations within the gne gene. The mutations are located at either the epimerase domain or the kinase domain [13] and lead to hypoactivity of the enzyme [11] . Mutagenesis and enzymatic activity analysis revealed that the activities of the epimerase domain and the kinase domain are interrelated such that a single mutation in one domain could affect the activities of both domains [11] . Here, we solved the structure of the dimeric GNE kinase domain in the ligand-free state. The structure reveals the dimerization interface of the kinase domain and also suggests a possible hexameric assembly of the protein. Furthermore, the structure provides insights into the relationship between GNE mutations and GNE-related metabolism disorders.",

The apparent molecular weight of the oligomer fits a hexamer of the kinase domain (see also below). However, the possibility of a tetramer [19] cannot be completely ruled out due to the low resolution of the gel-filtration column at this molecular size The GNE kinase domain was crystallized in space group P3 1 21 with three molecules in the asymmetric unit. Protein interface and assembly analysis using the PISA server [20] suggests that two of the three molecules dimerize through the C-lobe with an average buried surface area of 1587 \u00c5 2 per molecule ( Figure 4 ) whereas the third molecule dimerizes with a two-fold symmetry related molecule through the same C-lobe ( Figure 5a ). The solvation free energy gain upon formation of the interface, D i G, is 224.2 kcal?mol 21 , indicating that the dimer interface is very stable and may not simply be a crystal packing artifact.",

All these structures contain the signature zinc-binding motif of the ROK family. The structure of E. coli putative ManNAc kinase (PDB 2aa4) was the top hit with twist-adjusted r.m.s. deviation (opt-rmsd value) of 1.94 \u00c5 . The structure of a putative sugar kinase from Bacillus subtilis was the second best hit (PDB 1xc3). The other two homologous structures were transcription repressors that belong to the ROK family (PDB: 1z05 and 1z6r). Vibrio cholerae transcriptional regulator (PDB: 1z05) is a homolog of the E. coli Mlc protein (PDB: 1z6r). The latter is a transcriptional repressor that controls the expression of malT, the central transcription activator of the E. coli maltose system [22] . The structure of the GNE kinase domain aligns well with the E. coli Mlc structure: the N-lobe of GNE kinase domain aligns to the E-domain of Mlc and the C-lobe aligns to the Odomain of Mlc. It is interesting to note that the Mlc O-domain is responsible for the oligomerization of Mlc protein [22] in a way similar to the dimerization of GNE kinase through the C-lobe. However, these four structures do not contain sugar ligands that would help inform on a substrate binding mode for GNE.",

Since the interlobar cleft is the site of ATP and carbohydrate binding as well as where phosphoryl transfer occurs, mutation of these residues could change the interlobar movement during catalysis and thus affect the kinase activity of the protein. For example, the first identified HIBM-related mutation, M712T [13] , would likely abolish the hydrophobic interaction of the side chain of M712 with that of L523 from the C-lobe helix (Figure 8a ). In the previous study [11] , the M712T mutation has been shown to cause a 30% reduction in the kinase activity without affecting the epimerase activity of full length GNE. On the contrary, mutations of other residues in this second group reduce not only the kinase activity but also the epimerase activity of the full length protein ( [11] , Table 1 ).

The crystallographic hexamer, which consists of a trimer of kinase dimers, could serve as a prototype of a proposed full length GNE hexamer. Structure comparison of the GNE kinase domain with previously studied proteins revealed potential substrate binding sites at the interlobar cleft and also the structural and functional importance of the signature zinc-binding motif of the ROK family. Four groups of missense mutations associated with hereditary inclusion body myopathy are classified and their effects on the enzymatic activity can mostly be explained by the structure model.",

The DNA fragment encoding GNE residues 406-720 was PCR amplified and subcloned into the pET28-MHL vector (gi:134105571) using an In-Fusion dry-down PCR cloning kit (ClonTech). Protein was overexpressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) CodonPlus-RIL cells (Stratagene) grown in terrific broth medium. The culture was grown at 37uC in a LEX bubbling system (Harbinger Biotech. & Engineering Corp.) until OD 600 reached 3.0. The temperature of the culture was then lowered to 15uC and the cells were induced with 0.5 mM isopropyl 1-thio-b-D-galactopyranoside and allowed to grow further overnight. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 280uC until purification. Frozen cells were thawed and resuspended in 10 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.5) containing 500 mM sodium chloride, 5% glycerol, 2 mM b-mercaptoethanol, and supplemented with 5 mM imidazole, and mechanically lysed using a microfluidizer (Microfluidics, model M-110EH) at 1,000 bar pressure. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation. GNE protein was bound with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) beads (Qiagen) at a ratio of 2.5 mL 50% Ni-NTA flurry per litre of cell culture. The bound protein was washed twice with the same HEPES buffer containing 30 mM or 75 mM imidazole, and finally eluted with the HEPES buffer supplemented with 300 mM imidazole. The elutant containing the GNE protein was further purified by Supderdex-75 size exclusion chromatography (GE Healthcare). The eluted fractions were pooled, concentrated to a final concentration of 40 mg per mL, and stored in a buffer containing 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mM sodium chloride, 5% glycerol and 5 mM dithiothreitol. The purity of the protein was better than 95% judging from SDS-PAGE gel.",
