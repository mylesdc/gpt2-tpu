In multivariate Cox regression analysis, high CXCL14 expression in tumor specimens (n = 91) from stage I/II patients was associated with increased risk for disease recurrence (risk ratio, 2.92; 95% CI, 1.15-7.40; P = 0.024). Elevated CXCL14 expression in tumor specimens (n = 135) from stage III/IV patients correlated with worse overall survival (risk ratio, 3.087; 95% CI, 1.866-5.107; P < 0.001). Functional studies demonstrated that enforced expression of CXCL14 in SW620 colorectal carcinoma cells resulted in more aggressive phenotypes. In contrast, knockdown of CXCL14 expression could mitigate the proliferative, migratory and invasive potential of HCT116 colorectal carcinoma cells.",

They exert their cellular effect by specifically activating corresponding transmembrane G protein-coupled receptors [8] . Chemokines are classified into the C, CC, CXC, and CX 3 C families, based on variations in a structural motif of conserved N-terminal cysteine residues. Approximately 50 chemokines and 20 chemokine receptors have been identified. Chemokines could promote the invasiveness of cancer cells by triggering integrin clustering and enhancing their adherence to extracellular matrix via their receptors [9, 10] . Furthermore, chemokines and chemokine receptors could also serve as prognostic factors for cancer outcomes [11, 12] .",

This molecule was first identified by differential display using normal epithelial cells and head and neck squamous carcinoma cells and was shown to be expressed in many other normal tissues and in various tumors of epithelial origin with heterogeneous expression levels [13] [14] [15] [16] . As a unique member of the chemokine family, the receptor for CXCL14 has not yet been identified and the role of this molecule in tumor progression is controversial. Although the role of CXCL14 as a tumor suppressor seemed well established, recent studies suggested that CXCL14 might actually promote tumor progression [17, 18] . For example, CXCL14 was reported to be up-regulated in pancreatic cancer tissues compared to chronic pancreatitis and normal pancreas [19] . It has also been documented that CXCL14 transcript is markedly higher in papillary thyroid carcinoma than in adjacent noncancerous tissues and positively correlated with lymph node metastasis [20] . CXCL14 also acts as a multi-modal stimulator of prostate and stomach tumor growth [15, 21] . These findings necessitate a re-evaluation of the function of CXCL14 in epithelial tumors.",

Strong CXCL14 staining was mainly observed in the cytoplasm of tumor cells, while partially in the normal mucosa ( Figure 1A ). CXCL14-positive staining was observed in 54.3% (70/129) of normal colorectal mucosa samples, while in 85.3% (226/265) of primary CRC samples. CXCL14 expression was markedly up-regulated in colorectal tumor tissues compared with normal colorectal mucosa (P < 0.001, Figure 1B , C). Further, high CXCL14 immunoreactivity was also found in colorectal cancer tissues, compared to adjacent non- cancerous tissues, by using another antibody recognizing CXCL14, which may rule out the possibility of nonspecific staining (Additional file 1: Figure S1B ). Most of the stroma cells were CXCL14-negative, although sporadic positive staining on these cells was also observed.

By univariate analysis, clinical factors including age, lymph node metastasis and CXCL14 expression were significantly correlated with overall survival ( Table 4 ). Factors that were significant in univariate analysis and showed a trend toward significance were included in the multivariate model. Results showed CXCL14 expression could be used as a prognostic factor in overall survival of colorectal carcinoma patients (risk ratio, 3.087; 95% CI, 1.866-5.107; P < 0.001; Table 4 ). Patients with stage III CRC were divided into low-CXCL14-expressing tumor group (n = 66) and high-CXCL14-expressing tumor group (n = 61). By univariate analysis, CXCL14 expression (low expression v high expression) remained significantly different for all stage III CRC patients (Log-rank P < 0.001, Figure 3D ).",

            "text": "with tumor progression and metastasis [15, 16, 30] . In this study, we found that CXCL14 was frequently upregulated in colorectal tumors compared with the adjacent normal colorectal mucosa. This finding is consistent with previous studies that CXCL14 expression was elevated in tumor tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues [19, 20, 30] . To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that analyzes the expression of CXCL14 protein in colorectal carcinoma by immunohistochemistry using surgically resected neoplastic tissues. Furthermore, in early stage I colorectal cancer, CXCL14 expression was up-regulated compared with adjacent normal mucosa, suggesting that CXCL14 over-expression is an early event in the development of CRC. It is intriguing to speculate on possible reasons for these high expression levels of CXCL14 during tumorigenesis. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that CXCL14 expression was mainly located in malignant colorectal epithelial cells, and partially in stroma cells. Hence, it could be postulated that CXCL14, similar to other chemokines, is likely to signal through a G-coupled receptor and contributes to progression of CRC via both autocrine and paracrine pathways. Additionally, the levels of CXCL14 expression were significantly associated with some clinicopathologic factors including TNM stage, histodifferentiation, and tumor size. Previous studies have reported that these factors are possible predictors of early recurrence and cancer-death [31] [32] [33] . Among them, TNM stage is the strongest predictor of survival for patients with colorectal cancer [32] . The correlation between CXCL14 expression and these factors implies that elevated expression of CXCL14 may be associated with poor patient outcome. Multivariate analysis showed that elevated CXCL14 level in patients with stage I/II colorectal carcinoma was an independent risk factor for developing recurrence, and that the level of CXCL14 expression in patients with stage III/IV colorectal carcinomas was inversely correlated with duration of survival. CXCL14 is therefore a useful prognostic factor for predicting the outcome of patients with CRC who have had a surgical resection of their tumor. Therefore, patients with colorectal carcinoma showing elevated CXCL14 expression should be carefully followed-up, while those with no or low CXCL14 expression should avoid being overtreated. In addition, tumors with high CXCL14 expression had a worse prognosis, even within the same clinicopathologic stage. The staging system, which is based on the extent of the tumor spread at the time of primary surgical treatment, does not always account for the aggressiveness of the tumor itself. From a clinical perspective, the ability to predict outcome within the same clinicopathologic stage is the key to individualizing treatment options. CXCL14, to some degree, helps makes up for the fact that TNM stage per se cannot predict the outcome of patients with the same clinical stage. Although clinicopathologic data dealing with CXCL14 expression at the protein level are currently scarce, increasing attention has been paid to the prognostic significance of CXCL14 in other diseases. Using antibody arrays, CXCL14 has been identified as a potential diagnostic marker of hepatocellular carcinoma [34] . Additionally, CXCL14 have been suggested to be a poor prognostic marker in papillary thyroid carcinoma by qPCR analysis [20] .",

In the present study, immunohistochemical analyses and a number of in vitro studies were performed to validate the aggressive role of CXCL14 in colorectal cancer progression. The observation that there was good correlation between CXCL14 levels and Ki67 in human colorectal cancer suggested that CXCL14 was involved in human colorectal cancer cell proliferation. Indeed, we found that CXCL14 enhanced malignant colorectal cell proliferation in vitro. Consistent with these findings, CAF-derived CXCL14 was reported to exert paracrine stimulatory effects on the proliferation of the prostate cancer cell line LNCaP [15] . Meanwhile, rhCXCL14 was shown to enhance the proliferation of MCF-7 breast cancer cell accompanied by a robust increase in ERK phosphorylation in an autocrine manner [35] . Intriguingly, CXCL14 expression was observed to be restricted to the myoepithelial cells in ductal carcinoma in situ and the tumor epithelial cells in invasive breast carcinoma, suggesting CXCL14 might be converted into an autocrine factor from a paracrine factor [30] .",

            "text": "In almost all the specimens studied, the deeply invaded cancer cells were more intensely stained than those in mucosal regions. Additionally, the number of CXCL14positive cancer cells increased as cancer cells invaded deeply, with more than 90% of the cells in the regions of the muscularis propria and subserosa immunopositive. Furthermore, almost all the cancer cells in the lymph node metastases were also CXCL14-immunopositive. These results suggest CXCL14 may be involved in the process of invasion and metastasis, especially lymphatic permeation and nodal metastasis of colorectal cancer cells. In vitro studies further validated the role of CXCL14 in colorectal cancer cell migration and invasion. The underlying mechanisms of CXCL14-enhanced colorectal cancer cell migration and invasion are not clear. Recent reports showed that activation of chemokine signaling could promote tumor cell metastasis by regulating polymerization of intracellular actins, inducing formation of pseudopodia, and facilitating extracellular matrix degradation and remodeling [36, 37] . These findings are consistent with previous studies that implicated altered chemokine expression levels as an indicator of progression to tumorigenesis and metastasis capacity [38, 39] . However, few studies have reported the potential of CXCL14 in colorectal carcinoma initiation and progression. In contrast to previous studies in which CXCL14 was reported to be deficient in tumors and acted as a tumor suppressor [17, 18] , CXCL14 is recently identified as a novel potential cancer-stimulatory protein [20] . Results obtained from the present study together with others indicate a need for further analysis of possible tumor type-and stage-specific effects of CXCL14 in other tumors [15, 17, 30] . The mechanisms through which CXCL14 promotes or inhibits tumor progression need to be further analyzed.",

The \"seed and soil\" theory that target organs releasing specific chemokines attract tumor cells bearing corresponding receptors has provided an acceptable explanation for many important roles of chemokine receptors in cancer metastasis [37, 40] . Analyses of the effects of GPCR inhibitors with known target profiles and GPCR profiling of CXCL14-responsive and -nonresponsive cells, will possibly be useful for receptor identification. Identification of the factor(s) that cause up-regulation of CXCL14 in tumor epithelial cells is another relevant issue warranting further analyses. Understanding the mechanisms through which the chemokine CXCL14 promotes cell transformation and tumor progression is key to effective therapy. We examined the expression pattern of CXCL14 in CRC and its clinical value based on a small number of cases. Thus, there is a requirement for further investigations to clarify the correlation of CXCL14 expression with the clinical outcome of CRC with a larger patient cohort.",

Additionally, we report the potential clinical value of understanding CXCL14 expression in patients with CRC. On the one hand, CXCL14 could be used as a prognostic factor for poor disease outcome. On the other hand, our studies suggest that CXCL14 expression may be beneficial for individualizing treatment options for CRC patients. One of the challenges to effective therapy lies in understanding the mechanisms through which the chemokine CXCL14 promotes cell transformation and tumor progression. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for developing new therapeutic strategies to effectively inhibit cancer growth and metastasis.
