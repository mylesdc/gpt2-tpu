Clinical studies have shown that the AGR2 protein is overexpressed in a wide range of human cancers, including carcinomas of the esophagus, pancreas, breast, prostate, and lung, making the protein as a potential cancer biomarker. However, the general biochemical functions of AGR2 in human cells remain undefined, and the signaling mechanisms that drive AGR2 to inhibit p53 are still not clearly illustrated. Therefore, it is of great interest to develop molecular probes specifically recognizing AGR2 for its detection and for the elucidation of AGR2-associated molecular mechanism.",

Aptamer C14B was chosen to further study, due to its high binding affinity and specificity. The optimized and shortened C14B1 has special G-rich characteristics, and the G-rich region of this binding motif was further characterized to reveal an intramolecular parallel G-quadruplex by CD spectroscopy and UV spectroscopy. Our experiments confirmed that the stability of the G-quadruplex structure was strongly dependent on the nature of the monovalent ions and the formation of G-quadruplex structure was also important for the binding capacity of C14B1 to the target. Furthermore, we have designed a kind of allosteric molecule beacon (aMB) probe for selective and sensitive detection of AGR2.",

More recently, another type of molecular ligand, named aptamer, has drawn significant attention. Aptamers, singlestranded modified or unmodified oligonucleotides (RNA or DNA), are generated through in vitro selection process or SELEX (Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential enrichment) with high binding affinity and specificity towards defined targets [14, 15] . The selected aptamers can recognize a wide variety of targets, including small molecules, proteins, cells and tissues relying on their diverse tertiary structures. Compared to antibodies, aptamers have low molecular weight, fast tissue penetration rate, high stability and low immunogenesis [16] . They can be chemically synthesized with low cost and modified easily with various reporters [17] . Furthermore, they can be ligated and/or amplified by enzymes in vitro [18] . These advantages make aptamers promising ligands for medical and pharmaceutical research, such as drug development, disease diagnosis, and targeted therapy [19] .",

Particularly, several aptamers have been generated against cancer-related proteins, such as PDGF, VEGF, HER3, NFkB, tenascin-C, or PMSA [24] [25] [26] . Many aptameric sensors, probes and assays have been developed to allow sensitive and selective detection of these cancer biomarker proteins [27] . For instance, Yang et al has reported a lightswitching excimer aptamer probes for sensitive quantitative detection of PDGF in cell media [28] . Kwon et al have developed a functionalized polypyrrole nanotube with aptamer to build a VEGF biosensor [29] . Aptamers have also been applied for molecular imaging to in vivo characterize the complex pathogenic activities that accompany tumor growth for disease early diagnosis and pathogenesis measurement [30] [31] [32] [33] . Since the targets for aptamers could be intracellular, extracellular or cell-surface biomolecules, various therapeutic methods have been developed using the aptamers as targeting reagents [34] [35] [36] [37] , which greatly broaden the range of targeted therapy. In addition, some therapeutically useful aptamers have been found to inhibit protein-protein interactions, such as receptor-ligand interactions, and thereby function as antagonists [38] .",

After 14 rounds of selection, we have identified a group of DNA aptamers that specifically bound to AGR2 with high affinities. Structural studies on one of the aptamer sequences, C14B, revealed an intramolecular parallel Gquadruplex, and its structure and binding affinity to AGR2 depend on K + ion intensively. Furthermore, we designed an allosteric molecule beacon AGR2-aMB based on the identified aptamer, which enables simple, sensitive and selective detection AGR2. The aptamer sequences and AGR2-aMB reported in this study are potentially useful tools for early diagnosis and prognosis of cancer and for fundamental research to elucidate the biochemical functions of AGR2.",

The library was first allowed to interact with excess negative control beads, and only the DNA sequences that did not bound to the GST-beads were collected. The collected sequences were then incubated with AGR2-GST-beads. After rigorous washing, those sequences that either did not bind, or only weakly bound to the target were discarded. Only the sequences that bound strongly enough were retained on beads, and the bead-ssDNA complexes were collected and amplified by PCR for the next round of selection. After multiple rounds of selection, the subtraction process efficiently reduced the DNA sequences that bound to the GST beads, while those AGR2-specific aptamer candidates were gradually enriched. The progress of the selection process was monitored by flow cytometry. The stronger binding of DNA library to AGR2, the more FAM labeled sequences bound to the beads, thus the higher fluorescence intensity the beads would emit. With the increasing number of selection cycles, steady increases in fluorescence intensity on the target beads were observed (Figure 2a) . The binding affinity of the enriched library after 14 rounds of selection was determined to be in the nanomolar range (K d = 64.165.4 nM), while there was no observable binding of the library to control beads ( Figure 2b ).

The sequencing data for clones were analyzed by using sequencing analysis software Clustal W 6.0 [44] . The sequences were grouped based on the homology similarity of the DNA sequences from individual clone. Among the sequences from 62 clones, there were two subfamilies each containing multiple sequences with common features. One subfamily is guanosine-rich sequences (22 clones) , and the other is thymine-rich sequences (40 clones) ( Figure S1 ). Four sequences were chosen and synthesized for further characterization (Table S1 ): three sequences from Grich subfamily, C14A (appeared 2 times), C14B (appeared 3 times) and C14C (appeared 5 times), and one sequence C14D (appeared 2 times) from T-rich subfamily. Only one T-rich sequence was chosen because of T-rich sequences tend to from non-rigid tertiary structures and the chance of being aptamer was thought to be very low. As shown in Figure 2c , C14B can bind AGR2 with the highest affinity (K d = 13.167.2 nM). Titration of C14B to GSTbeads revealed no observable binding, establishing that the binding target of C14B was indeed AGR2. Other three sequences have similar binding constants to AGR2 but a little weaker than C14B, in which the K d of C14A is 20.965.2 nM, C14C is 44.667.0 nM and C14D is 48.4615.6 nM. ( Figure S2 ).",

The length of C14B is 87mer, which is disadvantageous for future applications because it is inconvenient and expensive to synthesize such a long sequence. To identify the binding region of the aptamer, the marginal sequences of C14Bwas gradually truncated. Two truncated sequencesC14B0 and C14B1 from C14B were shown in Table 1 . Subsequent binding affinity experiments revealed that both C14B0 (8.563.6 nM) and C14B1 (19.165.1 nM) have similar K d to AGR2 as that of original C14B (13.167.2 nM). The majority of eliminated sequences were primer sequences, implying that the binding region of the aptamer was the middle of random sequences and the primer sequences do not or contribute little to the binding affinity of aptamer. C14B1 has five portions of poly-G and we designed five truncated sequences by removing one of poly-G portion each (Table S2) . Removal of any poly-G portion would destroy its binding affinity to certain extend ( Figure S3) , suggesting the whole G-motif is required for aptamer binding. Taking together, these results indicate that C14B1, which was only 33 mer, was the essential binding region to AGR2. Thus, C14B1 was applied for further characterization and probe design.",

The sensitive and selective detection of AGR2 is thus of great importance to early cancer diagnostics. Herein, by applying the selected and optimized aptamer C14B1, we designed and developed an allosteric molecular beacon against AGR2, named AGR2-aMB, which converts the molecule recognition property of aptamer to fluorescence flow cytometry signal for AGR2 sensing [55] . Figure 5 illustrates the working principle of AGR2-aMB. An AGR2-aMB is a ssDNA consisting of an streptavidin (SA) aptamer sequence [56] , a C14B1 sequence, a short sequence complimentary to a small part of the SA aptamer sequence, and a fluorophore. A stable hairpin structure is formed by intramolecular hybridization between the SA aptamer sequence and the complementary sequence, temporarily disabling the probe's ability to bind with SA beads. Consequently, when incubated with SA beads, no probe can bind to SA beads, and the beads display very low fluorescence. In the presence of AGR2, however, the C14B1 sequence in the loop of aMB binds to the target sequence, which in turn disrupts the hairpin structure to free the SA binding sequence, thereby activating the probe's binding affinity to SA beads. Thus, the AGR2-bound probe will bind to SA beads, which will fluoresce strongly because the probe is FAM labeled. Target molecules can be detected and quantified by reading the fluorescence intensity of SA beads through flow cytometer.",

Stable hairpin structure is formed by intramolecular hybridization ( Figure S5 ). In our experiment, when only AGR2-aMB incubated with SA beads, no probe can bind to SA beads, and the beads fluoresced very weakly. In the presence of AGR2, however, the fluorescence intensity of SA beads increase significantly, suggesting the binding of AGR2-bound probe to SA beads. With the increase of AGR2 concentration, steady increases in fluorescence intensity on the target beads were observed. AGR2 at 100 nM concentration can be easily detected (Figure 6a) . A series of proteins including BSA, trypsin, thrombin, and IgG were employed as controls (500 nM), and no distinct fluorescent signals were observed (Figure 6b) , indicating an excellent specificity of the AGR2-aMB towards target molecule.

Beads-based SELEX allowed the use of simple, yet effective, flow cytometry analysis to monitor the progress of the selection, avoiding the tedious, time consuming and radioactive EMSA process. Through multiple rounds of selection with GST as a control, we have identified aptamers that selectively recognize AGR2 with nanomolar K d values. CD measurements and melting-temperature assays demonstrated that the optimal aptamer C14B1 forms an intramolecular parallel G-quadruplex structure and its structure and binding affinity are strongly dependent on the nature of the monovalent ion. Furthermore, with our design of AGR2-aMB, AGR2 could be sensitively and selectively detected The aptamer sequences and sensors reported here has great potential to serve as a useful tool for early diagnosis and prognosis of cancer and for fundamental research to elucidate the biochemical functions of AGR2.",

Melting temperatures (T m ) were taken as the temperature of half-dissociation of the quadruplex and were obtained from the maximum of the first derivative dA/dT plots at 295 nm. The heat-treated DNA solutions at several concentrations were introduced into a quartz cuvette and overlaid with a thin layer of silicone oil to prevent evaporation. The optical path length was 1 cm. Absorbance and temperature were recorded every 2uC.",

To the solution of AGR2-aMB, various concentrations of AGR2 were added and the resulting solutions were allowed to incubate at 37uC for 30 min. To the mixture, 1 mL of streptavidin beads (about 5610 4 beads) were added and the mixture was allowed to set for 45 min in dark. After washing twice with Tris-HCl buffer, SA beads were filtered to eliminate unbound AGR2-aMB and resuspended in Tris-HCl buffer solution 250 mL before flow cytometry analysis. In selectivity tests, BSA (Tagene Biotechnology Xiamen), trypsin (Dingguo Beijing), thrombin (alfa) and IgG (Dingguo Beijing) were used. Figure S1 The sequences of 62 clones. One subfamily is guanosine-rich sequences (22 clones) , and the other is thymine-rich sequences (40 clones).

(TIF) Figure S4 UV thermal-denaturation experiment of C14B1. Denaturation profiles obtained at 295 nm for the aptamer at three different concentrations (2 mM, 4 mM, 8 mM). The T m (59uC) at 295 nm is independent of oligonucleotide concentration, indicating that the aptamer forms an intramolecular G-quartet. (TIF) Figure S5 The secondary structure of AGR-aMB. Stable hairpin structure is formed by intramolecular hybridization between the SA aptamer sequence and the complementary sequence of C14B 1 .",
