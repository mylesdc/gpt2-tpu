            "text": "Genetic variation between diverse mouse species is well-characterized, yet existing knowledge of the mouse transcriptome comes largely from one mouse strain (C57BL/6J). As such, it is unlikely to reflect the transcriptional complexity of the mouse species. Gene transcription is dynamic and condition-specific; therefore, to better understand the mouse transcriptional response to respiratory virus infection, we infected the eight founder strains of the Collaborative Cross with either influenza A virus or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and sequenced lung RNA samples at 2 and 4 days after infection. We found numerous instances of transcripts that were not present in the C57BL/6J reference annotation, indicating that a nontrivial proportion of the mouse genome is transcribed but poorly annotated. Of these novel transcripts, 2150 could be aligned to human or rat genomes, but not to existing mouse genomes, suggesting functionally conserved sequences not yet recorded in mouse genomes. We also found that respiratory virus infection induced differential expression of 4287 splicing junctions, resulting in strain-specific isoform expression. Of these, 59 were influenced by strain-specific mutations within 2 base pairs of key intron-exon boundaries, suggesting cis-regulated expression. Our results reveal the complexity of the transcriptional response to viral infection, previously undocumented genomic elements, and extensive diversity in the response across mouse strains. These findings identify hitherto unexplored transcriptional patterns and undocumented transcripts in genetically diverse mice. Host genetic variation drives the complexity and diversity of the host response by eliciting starkly different transcriptional profiles in response to a viral infection.",

            "text": "While genetic variations between commonly used mouse strains have been characterized to a large extent (Collaborative Cross Consortium 2012; Keane et al. 2011) , the transcriptional landscape of genetically diverse mice has received little attention, with the Mouse ENCODE project focusing exclusively on the Mus musculus domesticus C57BL/ 6J strain (Mouse ENCODE Consortium et al. 2012) . Although some mouse strains are closely related, such as the classical laboratory inbred strains C57BL/6J and A/J, wild-derived strains such as PWK/PhJ and CAST/EiJ are more genetically variable and, in fact, represent the M. musculus castaneus and M. musculus musculus subspecies, respectively (Collaborative Cross Consortium 2012). Wild-derived inbred strains can harbor tens of millions of SNPs, hundreds of thousands of small indels, and tens of thousands of structural variations compared with the reference mouse genome (Keane et al. 2011) . This means that the genetic variation that exists among a few mouse strains can be as large as the genetic variation that exists among the 1092 humans sequenced by the 1000 Genomes Project (McVean et al. 2012) . In fact, there are more large structural differences between the CAST/EiJ strain and the mouse reference annotation than among all of the humans in the 1000 Genomes Project-25,000 vs. 14,000. Given these enormous genetic differences, and the fact that the mouse reference annotation is based on the C57BL/6J strain, it is likely that there are numerous new transcriptional elements with unknown functions that have yet to be recorded in the reference annotation.",

            "text": "Our understanding of transcription has been steadily augmented since the advent of RNA-seq (Mouse ENCODE Consortium et al. 2012; ENCODE Project Consortium et al. 2012) . More than half of the human genome is transcribed, yet no single cell line exhibits more than 60% of the total human transcriptome ). Many transcripts have been found in intergenic regions, particularly the long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) (Derrien et al. 2012 ). This suggests both transcriptional complexity and transcriptional diversity. In addition, transcription is dynamic and condition-dependent and is impacted by genetic variations (Montgomery et al. 2010; Pickrell et al. 2010) . Therefore, the large genetic diversity of laboratory mouse strains leads to more transcriptional diversity than is reflected in the reference annotation. For example, the interferon-inducible Mx1 gene is one of the first host genes that was linked to influenza A virus (IAV) pathogenesis, and it limits disease by inhibiting viral replication (Staeheli et al. 1988; Tumpey et al. 2007) . Mx1 is naturally polymorphic; the Mx1 gene has three exons that are absent in C57BL/6J mice but present in CAST/EiJ mice (Ferris et al. 2013) . As such, these exons are not recorded in the reference annotation.",

For example, transcriptional control mechanisms, such as alternative promoter and terminator usage, are prevalent in genes associated with neurological disease (Pal et al. 2011) ; and novel alternatively spliced transcripts have been linked to lung fibrosis development (Deng et al. 2013) . Alternative transcription is also important in the host response to virus infection. Transcriptional start site (TSS) selections and posttranscriptional modification to host transcripts have been linked to dengue virus virulence (Sessions et al. 2013) . Long noncoding RNAs have been linked to activation and repression of the inflammatory response to a TLR2 ligand (Carpenter et al. 2013; Chang et al. 2011) and to inflammatory signaling (Rapicavoli et al. 2013) , and unique noncoding RNA signatures have been associated with lethality of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Peng et al. 2010) . As genetically diverse mouse populations such as the CC mice become increasingly used for expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) (Bottomly et al. 2012 ) and transcriptomic studies (Pommerenke et al. 2012) , the need for a well-annotated mouse transcriptome increases commensurately.",

To this end, we sequenced day 2 and day 4 lung samples from the eight founder strains of the CC project that had been mock-infected or infected with mouse-adapted strains of two important respiratory pathogens, IAV or SARS-CoV. We built a custom bioinformatics pipeline to filter the results of de novo assembly by focusing on intergenic novel transcripts and aligning them with mouse expressed sequence tag (EST) and clone databases and with rat and human genomes. We found that many novel transcripts with potential roles in the host response to viral infection existed outside of the reference annotation. A smaller number of novel transcripts could not be aligned with the reference mouse genome or the pseudogenomes generated from the reference genome and genome sequencing of the founder mice, further demonstrating missing information in existing mouse genome sequence data. We found strain-specific differentially expressed (DE) isoforms between samples from virus-infected and mock-infected animals, some of which were likely cis-regulated by genetic variations near intron-exon boundaries. Strain-specificity was also observed in the functional enrichment of DE genes, with one subset of DE genes closely reflecting the underlying genetic variations and another subset suggesting differences in the immune response to viral infection among the different founder strains.",

Each sample was ensured to have at least 30 million reads and, on average, there were 48 million reads per sample. We then verified the sequence quality and filtered out ribosomal RNA reads and viral reads. The viral read counts varied among the founder strains, suggesting that the genotypes of the animals had an effect on viral loads in the lung (Supporting Information, Figure S1 ). Some strains, such as 129S1/SvImJ and CAST/EiJ, had high levels of MA15 RNA on day 4 after infection whereas others, such as NZO/ HILtJ and NOD/ShiLtJ, had low levels of MA15 RNA ( Figure S2 ). Strain-dependent variations in viral RNA levels were also observed in PR8-infected mice, although the pattern of high vs. low viral RNA levels was not necessarily the same. For example, although NOD/ ShiLtJ mice had lower levels of MA15 RNA than did the other mouse strains on day 4, the inverse was true for PR8 RNA levels in this strain ( Figure S2 ).

Indiscriminately using the reference annotation in CC transcriptome studies could bias results and lead to inaccurate conclusions. In addition, the advent of RNA-seq has led to large discoveries of novel transcripts (ENCODE Project Consortium et al. 2012) . Therefore, we built a custom bioinformatics pipeline ( Figure S5 ) for novel transcript discovery. We based our pipeline on the popular novel transcript discovery programs, Cufflinks (Trapnell et al. 2012) and Trinity (Grabherr et al. 2011) , with the former for genome-based transcript discovery and the latter for de novo assembly of transcripts not based on genomes. The pipeline accounted for the genetic variations of the founders' genomes compared with the reference genome, on which the reference annotation is built, by mapping transcripts in the reference annotation to pseudogenomes (Huang et al. 2013) . The mapped transcripts were used in place of the reference annotation. Because we had total RNA data, we focused on novel intergenic transcripts and filtered novel transcripts by comparing them against known transcripts. Additional filtering steps were required for de novo assembled transcripts to exclude false positives, so we mapped them against viral and ribosomal sequences and compared them with all known mouse, human, and rat ESTs and clones using BLAST. We also required all novel transcripts to be at least 200 bp long.",

C57BL/6J had the fewest (20887) new transcripts because the reference annotation is based on this strain and therefore is the most complete. We also observed that NOD/ShiLtJ mice had 30695 new transcripts and that all other strains had more new intergenic transcripts than C57BL/6J ( Figure S6A) . Surprisingly, wild-derived strains did not have more new transcripts than laboratory strains (except C57BL/6J), although overall differences in the numbers of novel transcripts among the other seven strains were not large. This could be due, in part, to the imperfect state of founder pseudogenomes, which are rooted in the reference genome and thus may not accurately describe the genomes of the other seven strains. This is particularly problematic for the wild-derived strains, whose genomes are more divergent from C57BL/6J. When we plotted the density of the novel transcripts onto mouse genomes, we found that although novel transcripts were spread throughout the eight genomes, they did cluster around certain locations (Figure 1 ). To further investigate this phenomenon, we zoomed-in on chromosome 2 ( Figure 2A ). The clustering patterns were remarkably consistent between founders, further validating the presence of these novel transcripts ( Figure 2A) . However, not all locations were identical for the eight founders; some regions showed clear differences between the wild-derived strains and the classical laboratory strains. One such region is found between 45.05 Mb and 45.2 Mb on chromosome 2, where the wild-derived strains tended to have shorter and fewer novel transcripts than the laboratory strains, as illustrated by Figure 2B . This observation led us to cluster the founder strains based on the novel transcript density of chromosome 2. The resulting similarity distance showed that the wild-derived strains were more distant from the laboratory strains, with the WSB/EiJ strain being the most closely related to the laboratory strains ( Figure S6B ). This observation is similar to that of a previous phylogenetic characterization of inbred mouse strains (Yang et al. 2007) .",

A genome browser view of one QTL region, HrI3, is shown in Figure S7 . The QTL study used PR8 virus and pre-CC mice, mice that are descendants of the founders in the current study and therefore are particularly relevant. First, we used linear regression to choose novel transcripts associated with weight loss; after multiple-testing correction, we obtained three significant novel transcripts. The three novel transcripts fall into regions previously associated with mouse body weight, pulmonary edema, or airway neutrophils of the mouse response to PR8 and their expression levels have further been associated with weight loss, an indicator of morbidity. Two of these transcripts were found in PWK/PhJ mice and the third transcript was found in C67BL/6J mice. When we used linear regression to characterize the functional roles of the three novel transcripts by associating their expression levels with those of annotated genes, one transcript in PWK/PhJ mice failed to significantly associate with any genes, but the other two transcripts were associated with many. These transcripts included XLOC_000093 in PWK/PhJ mice on chromosome 1 between 21.7 Mb and 29 Mb and XLOC_008559 in C57BL/6J mice on chromosome 15 between 77.4 Mb and 86.6 Mb. By using a cut-off value of 10 25 as the threshold, we identified more than 200 annotated genes that associated with these two novel transcripts. When we used IPA functional analysis to associate annotated genes with their predicted biological functions, we found that genes associated with XLOC_000093 were associated with TREM1 signaling, B cell receptor signaling, and NF-kB activation. Given the fact that these novel transcripts are within a QTL region associated with the host Figure 1 Circos plot of genome-wide novel transcript density.

We considered imputed introns to be part of novel transcripts to regions of high density often resulting from multiple, overlapping novel transcripts. Because all mice in this report were female, no Y chromosome information is available. response to PR8, are highly associated with weight loss after infection, and are associated with many important immune genes, it is likely that they have a functional role in the host response to viral infection.",

We took a conservative approach to mapping these transcripts to minimize false positives. First, we selected the parts of the output from Trinity that did not map to pseudogenomes or the reference genome. We then filtered the data by first removing transcripts mapped to viral and ribosomal genomes, then by retaining only those transcripts that aligned to known human, rat, and mouse sequences (ESTs or DNA clones), and finally by requiring a minimum length of 200 bp per transcript.

Because both the reference annotation and the reference genome are based on samples from the C57BL/6J strain, it is no surprise that C57BL/6J had the fewest de novo transcripts among all the founders. However, it is somewhat surprising that there were 600 de novo transcripts in this strain. On average, the laboratory strains (A/J, 129S1/SvImJ, C57BL/6J, NOD/ ShiLtJ, NZO/HILtJ) had fewer de novo transcripts than the wildderived strains (CAST/EiJ, PWK/PhJ, WSB/EiJ), reflecting the greater genomic difference between the wild-derived strains and C57BL/6J. Some of the de novo transcripts were more than 1000 bp long, with the transcripts shown in Figure 4B being prominent examples. These transcripts have very low similarity to the reference genome and pseudogenomes but could be mapped to both rat and human genomes with coverage approximately 70% or more. Interestingly, these transcripts could also be mapped to a lesser known mouse genome assembly called Mm_Celera (Mural et al. 2002) , which was generated by Celera genomics based on multiple mouse strains. One prominent example is the de novo transcripts that spanned multiple conserved exons of the gene Spata5l1 and aligned well with respective exons of human and rat genomes ( Figure 4B ).

One is through distant regulation, by changing the expression of transcription factors or their affinity for distant promoters. The other is by changing local sequences such as spliceosome binding sites or intron-exon boundaries. While genetic variation was an obvious source of splicing variations, it was not clear whether differential expression was due to distant regulation or direct sequence alteration of local sites. Distant regulators are difficult to ascertain without a full genetic study, but local sequence variations could be assessed with our dataset. We therefore compared our list of DE splice junctions with published genetic variations obtained through a next-generation sequencing project (Keane et al. 2011 ) and extracted DE isoforms with genetic variations within 2 bp of their intron-exon boundaries. Because of the proximity of these genetic variations to intron-exon boundaries, this subset of DE isoforms is likely the result of cis-regulated gene expression. One example is found in the Atp5f1 gene ( Figure 5A ). Atp5f1 is an ATP synthase and transport gene that has been linked to hepatitis B infection (Lee et al. 2008) . This gene, although not differentially expressed overall, had two splice junctions showing elevated expression in samples from PR8-infected WSB/EiJ mice on day 4 after infection. Furthermore, there was a SNP (rs33689100) at 105758959 on chromosome 3 that was within 2 bp of an intronexon boundary. Another example was the Tdrd3 gene, which showed differential isoform expression in CAST/EiJ mice on day 2 after MA15 infection. This gene has been linked to stress granules, which are coopted by several viruses during replication (Lloyd 2013) . At 87886156 on chromosome 14, there was an insertion (rs234605399) within 2 bp of an intron-exon boundary, likely causing the splice junction spanning that position to be differentially expressed ( Figure 5B ). The splice junction neighboring rs234605399 had far fewer reads in samples from virus-infected animals, although the overall gene expression was similar for all samples.",

Although it was clear that genetic differences drove the strain-specific expression patterns that were described above, it was unclear whether this was by indirect genetic regulation or by direct genome sequence changes. Examples of direct sequence alteration include premature transcriptional stops and reduced transcription factor-binding affinity. To tease apart these sources of distinct expression patterns and their likely functional roles, we first separated the DE genes into three groups: those not expressed in all the samples of one mouse strain (group A); those expressed in all strains (group B); and the remainder. In other words, group A genes were differentially expressed during virus infection for at least one strain but were not expressed for another strain for all time points and all viruses ( Figure 7A ). This group includes genes with extreme expression difference between strains. We used group A gene expression levels to cluster all founder strains and discovered that the resulting similarity graph ( Figure 7B ) resembled the phylogenetic tree based on genetic variations (Yang et al. 2007 ). Using the remaining DE genes, or all DE genes, did not yield the same similarity graph. This suggests that genome sequence variations between founders had a large and immediate impact on the expression of these genes. The genome sequence variation driving selective expression of these genes is likely nearby in upstream binding sites or promoters, which are different between strains because of SNPs, small indels, or structural variations. In extreme cases, whole genes may be deleted in certain strains. Although genetic regulation is always a factor in gene expression, for these genes, expression differences between founder strains may be more directly explained by genome sequence variations within or near those genes.",

Consistently expressed genes included genes that were similarly expressed across all eight founders, whereas genes with highly variable expression between strains are likely to be ultimately responsible for differing phenotypes.

This suggests a tightly controlled host-response program in response to infection. The expression patterns shown in Figure 8 , A and B have 445 consistently expressed genes and 835 genes with highly variable expression. When we looked for pathway enrichment using GO terms, we found the consistently expressed genes were dominated by general biological processes and cellular functions, with low enrichment of immune functions or pathways. The top 10 enriched pathways for consistently expressed genes are in Table 1 . There, only one pathway, pro-B-cell differentiation biological process, was related to immune function. The opposite was true for genes with highly variable expression, whose GO terms were predominantly immune functions such as innate immune system and interferon stimulation. The top 10 enriched pathways are listed in Table 2 . Functional enrichment of immune functions remained high regardless of whether all known genes or just the DE genes were used as the background, so the high functional enrichment of genes with highly variable expression was not confounded by the enrichment of DE genes in immune functions.

Even though C57BL/6J is the reference strain, we nevertheless found hundreds of missing sequences and tens of thousands of intergenic transcripts in this strain. The other seven strains had even more novel features. It is likely that many of the intergenic transcripts were the extended fragments of known genes, or that multiple new transcripts came from one new gene, so that the total numbers of novel transcripts are lower than estimated. However, the existence of large numbers of unannotated or extended genes is undoubtedly real in the mouse as well as other species. The implication of incomplete reference genome and annotation for QTL and eQTL studies is substantial. Although the transcriptome data presented here will help overcome these shortcomings in mouse studies, the concern remains for other systems, such as human GWAS. The potential pitfalls of incomplete genomes were illustrated by the example of Spata5l1, which had multiple exons missing in all eight strains. For studies of genetic control of transcription, our results can help by pointing out potentially incomplete gene models in the reference annotation and can also help complete the mouse annotation with new intergenic transcripts. Our results have particular relevance for viral infection studies, particularly respiratory viruses, as these new transcripts in lung may have functional roles, as evidenced by their differential expression in response to infection.",

It is possible that the genes with strainspecific expression are genes that are expressed by different infiltrating cell populations, which may vary between the founders, whereas the nonstrain-specific genes are not active in infiltrating cells. An alternative explanation is that gene expression changes that were not strain-specific are so fundamentally important to mouse survival that they are similarly regulated in all founders. Further study of a variety of CC lines and/or by cell sorting and cell-specific transcriptional analysis could help to explain this phenomenon and its implications on host survival.",

For example, the 1700026D08Rik gene n n The top 10 enriched GO terms for genes variably expressed among all founder strains. The adjusted p-values are listed to the right. Dominance of immunerelated functions can be seen in enrichment whose baseline is all DE genes, which already has high enrichment for immune functions is associated with day 4 weight loss after PR8 infection (Ferris et al. 2013) . We found that the same gene had DE isoforms in NOD/ShiLtJ mice at day 2 after PR8 infection. Although there was no genetic variation near intron-exon boundaries of this gene in NOD/ShiLtJ mice, this strain-specific isoform expression pointed to possible genetic influence and therefore higher likelihood of being the causal gene among the 69 genes and 10 noncoding RNAs that were significantly associated with day 4 weight loss along with 1700026D08Rik. This is especially important because many genes, such as 1700026D08Rik, have poorly described or no known functions. We found that genes such as IL6, Sh3gl3, and Atxn10, which had previously been associated with different phenotypic outcomes in response to IAV infection, also expressed different isoforms in response to SARS-CoV infection. In this case, they have not been identified as QTL candidate genes for SARS-CoV infection, but their likely importance in the host response is increased because their genetic variations may cause large phenotypic variations and their isoforms were differentially expressed in samples from SARS-CoV-infected animals. Because CC mice still have relatively large recombination intervals, the resolution of QTL using CC mice is not at the gene level, and QTL often will have many candidate genes within a significant region. Isoform differential expression results could prove very helpful in finding causal genes in future QTL studies using CC mice by searching for strain-specific DE isoforms among candidate genes. Candidate genes whose protective alleles differentially express isoforms and whose deleterious alleles do not differentially express isoforms are likely the causal genes. This study is a first important step in extracting full information from transcripts in CC mice. We have provided examples and catalogs of discrepancies with the reference genome and reference annotation. Our differential expression analysis and subsequent functional analysis revealed distinct and focused host responses to viral infection across the eight CC founder strains. The full extent and importance of isoform differential expression are currently unclear. However, it is clear that genetic diversity drives diverse, intricate, and multi-faceted immune responses at the isoform, gene, and pathway levels through direct alteration of gene sequences, indirect regulation of expression, or a combination of both. The transcriptome data from this study are a resource to the mouse genetics community and are of direct benefit to researchers studying transcriptional complexity in genetically diverse populations.",

A dearth of good, full genomes for the founders hampered our comparison across strains. Relative small sample sizes for unique combinations of strain, virus, and days after infection are problematic. Considerable variability in mouse body weight within one strain has been observed, but there were too few mice to properly estimate true variance. Future studies can solve these issues by leveraging our data and results.",
