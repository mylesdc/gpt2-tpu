We have examined the possibility to encode an arbitrary pair of protein domains as a dual gene, with the shorter coding sequence completely embedded in the longer one. For 500 \u00d7 500 domain pairs (X, Y), we computationally designed homologous pairs (X\u2032, Y\u2032) coded this way, using an algorithm that provably maximizes the sequence similarity between (X\u2032, Y\u2032) and (X, Y). Three schemes were considered, with X\u2032 and Y\u2032 coded on the same or complementary strands. For 16% of the pairs, an overlapping coding exists where the level of homology of X\u2032, Y\u2032 to the natural proteins represents an E-value of 10 \u221210 or better. Thus, for an arbitrary domain pair, it is surprisingly easy to design homologous sequences that can be encoded as a fullyoverlapping gene pair. The algorithm is general and was used to design 200 triple genes, with three proteins encoded by the same DNA segment. The ease of design suggests overlapping genes may have occurred frequently in evolution and could be readily used to compress or constrain artificial genomes.",

Indeed, to evaluate their role in evolution, we should have a precise idea of the difficulty to create them. The rarity of contemporary examples and the stringent overlap constraints suggest that it is very difficult. To quantify in a general way the difficulty to create overlapping genes, we have examined the possibility of encoding an arbitrary pair of protein domains in a single DNA segment, as a fully-overlapping dual gene. We considered three possible reading frames for the second protein, relative to the first: two on the antisense strand and one on the sense strand. Indeed, sense and antisense overlap schemes have different implications for the biological hypotheses above and different capabilities to code a variety of amino acid types 11, 17 . One sense:antisense overlap scheme placed the third, wobble base in each codon opposite the central nucleotide of another codon (Fig. 1) . Given the structure of the genetic code, this is expected to be the most favorable scheme, as confirmed below. Another scheme placed the central bases of the sense and antisense codons opposite each other (F = 0 scheme, Fig. 1 ). This is less favorable, since each central base constrains the other. The two sense:sense overlap schemes are similar and we chose one of them.",

For each (X, Y) pair, we searched for two homologs (X\u2032, Y\u2032) that can be encoded in a fully overlapping manner. We required that the coding sequence of the smaller domain be completely embedded within that of the larger one. For each pair, we explored three possible overlap schemes, where X\u2032 and Y\u2032 are encoded either on the same DNA strand in two different reading frames or on opposite strands. The search used a dynamic programming scheme 19 , presented here, that provably maximizes a total X/X\u2032 and Y/Y\u2032 similarity score. The method's cost is proportional to the length of the shorter protein, allowing a large-scale study. Considering all three reading frames, we found that over 16% of the (X, Y) pairs have homologous pairs (X\u2032, Y\u2032) that can be encoded in a fully overlapping manner, with a level of X/X\u2032 and Y/Y\u2032 homology corresponding to Blast E-values of 10 \u221210 or less and a match length of at least 85% of the total sequence length. The success rate was 14% for pairs of non-viral proteins and 52% for pairs of viral proteins. None of the 502 viral pairs were natural pairs occurring within the same virus. Thus, it appears that many pairs of protein domains have close homologs that can be encoded by a fully-overlapping dual gene and the tendency is especially high for viral proteins. This is in striking contrast to naive expectation. Differences between the proteins that do or do not allow overlapping schemes are analyzed and discussed. Given the level of success and the generality of our algorithm, we also designed 200 triple genes, with three proteins encoded by the same DNA segment using both strands and three different reading frames. All the designed proteins had E-values better than 10 \u221220 against their natural homologs. The designs included 62 triplets of bacterial proteins and 30 triplets of viral proteins. Such triple overlaps have been found in viruses 9,20,21 , but the corresponding protein sequences may be unstructured, in contrast to our designed sequences. It has also been proposed that triple overlaps may have existed in ancestral ribosome sequences 22 . The ease of design revealed here of both double and triple genes is consistent with the overprinting mechanism for gene creation and suggests that overlapping genes could have occurred frequently in evolution. To facilitate their use in artificial genomes, our design code is provided online (see Github).",

In prokaryotic genomes, a slight preference for F = \u22122 was noted in surviving overlapping genes. Indeed, the coding properties of this scheme are especially favorable, and we analyze them briefly here. In this frame, each X\u2032 codon has its middle nucleotide in register with a Y\u2032 wobble nucleotide, and vice versa. Since the wobble nucleotide has little effect on the coded amino acid, this allows the middle nucleotide of each X\u2032 and Y\u2032 codon to be chosen almost freely.

Despite the base-pairing constraint, 15 of them can be encoded freely in this overlap scheme. Only the combination (\u03c0, \u03c0) cannot be encoded unambiguously.

If we express the sequences of the proteins X and Y in the simplified alphabet {\u03a6, \u03d5, \u03a0, \u03c0}, the simplified sequences can be exactly expressed by a dual gene in the F = \u22122 frame, with the exception of the (\u03c0, \u03c0) pairs, which would sometimes be replaced by (\u03c0, \u03a0) pairs. Thus, in an ancestral world with a simpler {\u03a6, \u03c6, \u03a0, \u03c0} amino acid alphabet, arbitrary overlapping genes could be encoded almost perfectly thanks to the properties of the genetic code 26 , exploited by the F = \u22122 reading frame. This would presumably have been favorable for genome compaction and consequently for viruses, which evolve essentially at fixed capsid volume.",

The success rate for designing overlapping coding schemes for the 44 viral proteins considered here was remarkably high: almost 45% of the considered pairs gave designs with E-values better than 10 \u221215 vs. the natural proteins. It could be of interest to test whether the modern genetic code is especially tolerant of overlapping genes, compared to ancestral codes (including competing codes that did not survive), or artificial codes (including codes that use larger or smaller amino acid alphabets or codons of a different length). This could be tested by repeating our calculations using one or more alternative codes and comparing the level of success obtained to the values reported above. Such comparisons could help determine whether a high tolerance for overlapping coding schemes played a role in the selection of the genetic code.",

This could be of technological interest, for example to produce a very compact plasmid or to prevent the fixation of mutations and genetic drift in a plasmid or a synthetic organism. Given the surprising ease with which a dual gene can be designed, we also considered and verified the possibility of creating 200 triple genes that use not two, but three of the six possible overlapping reading frames. With additional effort, other triple genes with even better E-values could be obtained. This could be a way to reduce genetic drift even more drastically, constraining an artifical organism to stay close to its original genotype.",
