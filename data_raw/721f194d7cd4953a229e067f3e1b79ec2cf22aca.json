To minimize the impacts of future events, animal disease surveillance will need to enable prompt event detection and response. Diagnostic laboratory-based surveillance systems targeting domestic animals depend in large part on private veterinarians to submit samples from cases to a laboratory. In contexts where pre-diagnostic laboratory surveillance systems have been implemented, this group of veterinarians is often asked to input data. This scenario holds true in Alberta where private cattle veterinarians have been asked to participate in the Alberta Veterinary Surveillance Network-Veterinary Practice Surveillance, a platform to which pre-diagnostic disease and non-disease case data are submitted. Consequently, understanding the factors that influence these veterinarians to submit cases to a laboratory and the complex of factors that affect their participation in surveillance programs is foundational to interpreting disease patterns reported by laboratories and engaging veterinarians in surveillance. A focused ethnographic study was conducted with ten cattle veterinarians in Alberta. Individual in-depth interviews with participants were recorded and transcribed to enable thematic analysis. Laboratory submissions were biased toward outbreaks of unknown cause, cases with unusual mortality rates, and issues with potential herd-level implications. Decreasing cattle value and government support for laboratory testing have contributed to fewer submissions over time. Participants were willing participants in surveillance, though government support and collaboration were necessary. Changes in the beef industry and veterinary profession, as well as cattle producers themselves, present both challenges and opportunities in surveillance.

Countries and communities have failed to predict specific EID events and in many cases have been ill equipped to respond once a disease has emerged, making it difficult to contain both the disease and the social and environmental impacts of the disease [5] . In response to the challenge posed by EIDs, surveillance of animal populations is changing rapidly [5] . It is strongly believed that preventing or controlling disease in animals is optimal for limiting the impact of zoonotic EIDs [6, 7] .",

Surveillance of submissions to diagnostic laboratories will continue to be an important component of any infectious disease surveillance system because for many infectious diseases laboratory tests are the only way to make an etiologic diagnosis. In addition, etiological diagnoses can inform control procedures and response policies. However, the contribution of diagnostic laboratory-based surveillance to early detection of EIDs is compromised by the time lag between the onset of clinical signs and when an etiologic diagnosis is made and the availability of diagnostic laboratory tests to identify the infectious disease agent [9] . In addition, submission biases restrict the type and number of potentially infectious cases that are submitted to a diagnostic laboratory [10, 11] . Veterinarians play a critical role in determining which cases will be submitted for diagnostic laboratory testing. Their decisions, in combination with direction from animal owners, influence the types and amounts of samples that are assessed at the level of the diagnostic laboratory, introducing potential sampling biases that will affect disease patterns described by laboratory-based surveillance [12] . In order to understand this selection bias in diagnostic laboratory-based surveillance, submission patterns of veterinarians and the factors that influence their decision to submit samples must be better understood [11] [12] [13] .",

One component of the program is the Alberta Veterinary Surveillance Network-Veterinary Practice Surveillance (AVSN-VPS), a secure internet-based platform that allows cattle veterinarians to submit pre-diagnostic disease and non-disease case data to a centralized system. The AVSN-VPS is considered integral to the AVSN as it informs the activities of other program components, including disease investigations by ARD pathologists, epidemiologists, and veterinarians.",

            "text": "Qualitative research provides insight into human decisions and behaviour [15] . Qualitative approaches, one of which is focused ethnography, are not intended to permit researchers to make any statistical inferences from their findings that are generalized to the wider population. Instead, they allow researchers to gain a deeper understanding of the role that beliefs, circumstances, motivations, and context play in a variety of human behaviours, including decision making [15] . In other words, the strength of qualitative research is its ability to help answer why particular behaviours occur or to describe processes as opposed to outcomes [15] and thus is well suited to providing insight into the human dimensions of surveillance. Utilization of qualitative research methods is becoming increasingly common in the animal health field [16] [17] [18] . They have also been employed in the human health field to explore the use of health data in public health practice, as well as factors that act to facilitate or hinder use of these data [19] [20] [21] . However, in the animal and human health fields, qualitative studies are rare in comparison to the frequency of quantitative studies. The value of employing qualitative methods in understanding the human dimensions of diagnostic laboratory case submissions and participation of government veterinarians in prediagnostic disease surveillance initiatives has been demonstrated in Sri Lanka, a lower resource setting where the risk of disease emergence is deemed high [22] . However, Canada's experience with highly pathogenic avian influenza, pandemic influenza virus (H1N1) 2009, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) highlights that EIDs are a global phenomenon [5] and understanding the ability of surveillance systems to detect and respond to EID risks in animals is necessary across a range of resource contexts.",

In many instances participants wished to confirm the clinical diagnosis or know the cause of the disease. Participants targeted: particular syndromes of interest; cases with poor response to treatment or pharmaceutical produce failure; cases where results from diagnostic laboratory testing would inform clinical practice; cases where there was no diagnosis from clinical or gross post mortem examination; cases where there was a suspicion of a notifiable or reportable disease; atypical case presentations; cases where the economic consequences of disease were potentially high; cases in which there was a potential public health risk; cases involving high-value animals; bizarre cases; and insurance cases. Participants also submitted samples to a diagnostic laboratory at the request of owners/producers and in instances where it was convenient. A case condition emphasized by all participants was the importance of multiple animals affected. Participants emphasized that the decision to submit samples depended on the management context: Some guys backgrounding cattle aren't doing anything, so if I've got five or six calves out of 50 that are dying, that's not unexpected. If I've got a well-vaccinated herd and good management and good mineral program and good nutrition program and I've got more than two or three that are sick out of 40 or 50, then I'm concerned\u2026 Better managed herds have less disease but usually those kind of people usually we do more diagnostic stuff because they want to know whereas the poorer managed ones save money on management costs so they can afford to have more losses.

One participant articulated dissatisfaction with the CFIA and its handling of reportable disease cases, Reportable diseases that occur in the area the CFIA picks up, do you think we're notified first on the list that one of our clients might have a certain problem? No. We're usually one of the last people to find out and usually it's from the producer. I think that's pretty terrible [\u2026] Yeah there was one in our area from one of our clients and I knew nothing about it until he came in having all these questions\u2026 He was given very little information by them and I ended up having to phone the CFIA and chase someone down to talk to and get the story\u2026 Something reportable is right here in our own backyard and we weren't even notified by them [\u2026] It was on a random screening sample at one of their plants and they picked it up [\u2026] Not only is that very poor relations but it sends a bad message to us because veterinarians are proactive type ''A'' people that want to be involved and if I'm going to go out [\u2026] and invest my time, my effort and I care about this and \u2026 something comes back or you find something out about a herd in our area and then you don't even bother to contact me and let me know, I think it sends a really bad message out: ''We don't want to work together.

This finding is supported by quantitative studies looking at diagnostic laboratory test submissions [11, 12] .

            "text": "One way of examining the diagnostic laboratory submission behaviour of participants is through the lens of expectancy theory from the field of sociology. Expectancy theory is concerned with the process individuals go through in arriving at the decision to perform one behaviour over another or others [27, 28] . At its foundation is the idea that individuals decide to act in certain ways because they are motivated to select particular behaviours out of a range of possible behaviours due to the results they expect to stem from them. There are three components of expectancy theory: expectancy, instrumentality, and valence [27, 28] . These three components play an interactive role in motivation. A large part of expectancy theory is what individuals perceive: individuals' actions will not be motivated by what the results will be, but by what they believe the results will be. One of the primary goals of cattle veterinarians in private veterinary practice in Alberta is to achieve positive case outcomes for their clients. Application of expectancy theory in this context reveals that if a veterinarian perceives a strong correlation between performing diagnostic laboratory testing and case outcome then instrumentality (an individual's belief that the rewards acquired as the result of an action are closely related to level of performance) will be high and the veterinarian will be motivated to pursue laboratory diagnostics. This theory helps to explain why diagnostic laboratory testing that does not inform treatment was viewed as 'academic'. However, participants also cited suspicion of a reportable or notifiable disease or concern for a public health risk as case characteristics that encourage sample submission. In these instances the goal may be to confirm the absence of a reportable or notifiable disease or a public health risk. Though based on past experience the likelihood of a reportable or notifiable disease or public health risk is low, the valence (the degree to which an individual values a particular award) attached to identifying either event is high.",

EID events characterized by atypical case presentations or bizarre cases are likely to make it to the level of the diagnostic laboratory, though participants reported that it would be unlikely for the index case to be submitted. Submission to diagnostic laboratories would also necessitate veterinarians to recognize that a number of cases over time were sufficiently similar to have an underlying etiology. The ordered diagnostic laboratory test would have to be capable of detecting the agent or, in the event that histopathology or cytopathology were the test ordered, the pathologist would need to recognize that the case represented something out of the ordinary. Alternatively, the diagnostician reviewing the case history would need to come to the conclusion that additional diagnostic tests were warranted, and consult with the veterinarian about additional testing and cost coverage. Participants also indicated that samples were submitted when there were unusual outbreaks or in situations where there were large numbers of animals affected. Surveillance of diagnostic laboratory submissions may therefore be sufficient for detection of EID events characterized by these types of presentations, though it is difficult to determine if detection would be sufficiently prompt to mitigate their impact on animal and public health. In contrast, given the overall small number of sample submissions reported by participants, diagnostic laboratory-based surveillance is unlikely to detect slower-moving EID events that present more sporadically or changes in trends of known endemic problems as incomplete sampling is unlikely to generate a signal in the diagnostic laboratory data stream [29] .",

The success of private veterinarians is dependent upon their relationship with producers: it is imperative that surveillance initiatives reliant on the participation of private veterinarians respect this relationship and not serve to undermine it. For example, pre-diagnostic surveillance initiatives may need to include mechanisms that ensure specific farm locations are excluded from case submissions in order to protect the privacy of producers and gain support from veterinarians, as was done with the AVSN-VPS (John Berezowski, personal communication). In addition, the goals of surveillance initiatives need to be communicated to producers so that when changes are made that are deemed necessary producers understand the reasons behind them.

It is also impossible to pinpoint EID events that have been averted as a result of surveillance. The results show that the BSE surveillance program in Alberta that requires veterinarians to visit cattle operations to collect samples has had both direct and indirect consequences to the veterinary perspective on the cattle health situation. While it serves to satisfy many consumers and trading partners that the prevalence of BSE in Canada's cattle population is very low, and the risk of a BSE-positive cow entering the food chain is very small, it has also translated into more veterinary contact with the cattle population, in particular with segments of the population that previously had minimal contact with the veterinary profession. This increased contact could prove essential to recognition of future EID events. Creating circumstances for veterinarians to get onto cattle operations in the absence of a major problem, or in a 'non-confrontational way', has had the added benefit of improving the relationship between veterinarians and producers. This enhanced affiliation could prove invaluable during future EID events as producers might be more likely to bring animal health concerns to the attention of their veterinarian, creating more opportunities for event recognition, thereby enabling more timely EID event detection and response. It could also be critical to enabling veterinarians to influence the producer's final decision when it comes to submitting samples to a diagnostic laboratory, thereby enabling more cases to reach the level of the diagnostic laboratory and potentially improving this source of surveillance data. Previous work has also suggested that the trust of producers is critical to event reporting, surveillance, and adoption of biosecurity measures [38] , all of which are critical to EID event detection and response.",

The organizational level in the socio-ecological model recognizes that changing the policies and practices of a workplace can serve to support behavioural change. In Alberta, providing the ARD with additional resources to support the activities of cattle veterinarians, in particular further diagnostic laboratory capacity, is an incentive for surveillance system participation that was identified by participants as essential. As suggested by one participant, collaboration on a list or decision tree that would inform diagnostic laboratory testing supported by the government is one approach to future diagnostic laboratory-based surveillance by the ARD that had been unexplored at the time of the interviews. This type of approach could be particularly useful as it would enable targeted case presentations to reach the level of the diagnostic laboratory and it would heighten awareness to these case presentations among cattle veterinarians. Efforts to communicate with farmers about such programs would help to ensure cases are being brought to the attention of veterinarians.",

However, the results also indicate that the information produced from the AVSN-VPS has had limited utility in cattle veterinary practice. Administrators of the AVSN-VPS should consider consulting with veterinarians who input data to determine how to make the information provided more relevant to data providers, and if any further data types might be worth collecting.

The societal level in the socio-ecological model recognizes that there are societal or cultural high-level factors that create a climate that encourages or discourages behaviours. Broadly speaking, governments and the animal and public health communities create a climate that impacts willingness to report EID events. This process is operating at the level of nations, veterinarians, animal health care workers, and producers. Surveillance programs can serve to improve the relationship between veterinarians and government regulatory bodies [39] . The AVSN-VPS has generated information concerning the perspective veterinarians have on healthrelated events in the cattle population. This information has been shared between private cattle veterinarians and veterinarians at the ARD and has created a knowledge base around which to dialogue. Participants highlighted opportunities to enhance this relationship, in particular the need for diagnostic laboratory support guided by the outputs of the AVSN-VPS. The needs of consumers, producers, veterinarians, and the provincial and federal government could be well served were the ARD to utilize the willingness of veterinarians to participate in surveillance and participants' recognition of the need for change within the veterinary profession. A collaborative effort between cattle veterinarians and veterinarians at the ARD to develop a government-supported diagnostic laboratory surveillance program that satisfied veterinarians' desire for further diagnostic laboratory support, the requirement of the provincial and federal government to surveil for and report potential EIDs events as part of Canada's membership in the OIE, and the public's need to be assured of a safe food supply could enhance the relationship between cattle veterinarians and the ARD. This type of endeavour could be invaluable during future EID events, particularly as control of past events has required cooperation among producers, veterinarians, and multiple government agencies [41] . The CFIA should explore means of improving their relationship with cattle veterinarians as they are integral to detection of outbreaks of OIE-listed diseases and evidence of a healthy working relationship between the two parties from the perspective of participants was lacking.",

Previously, cattle veterinarians had an important role in performing technical procedures, such as caesareans, to treat animal disease conditions. They also had a role in implementing management programs that have decreased the burden of animal health conditions requiring veterinary intervention. Producers have learned alongside veterinarians and no longer require veterinarians to perform all the functions they did previously. Participants in this study identified this phenomenon and the need for the veterinary profession to change in response, though there were differences between participants in what those changes might need to be. From an EID standpoint, one avenue the cattle veterinary profession might consider exploring is increasing its emphasis on healthy animal populations, as opposed to animal populations that are simply free from disease: healthy animals are more resistant to infectious diseases [42, 43] and could serve to help mitigate the risk of future EID events in animal populations. If the model of private veterinary services to foodproducing animals is going to persist, changes to the services provided by the veterinary profession are going to have to be economically relevant to producers.",

As a result there is inherent potential for conflict between producers and the need for improved government-driven EID surveillance. Future surveillance initiatives will need to consider this aspect of cattle production to encourage producer involvement and to help build an industry that attracts a future generation of farmers. Participants also highlighted that challenges to the beef industry in Alberta have made raising beef cattle less economically viable and that BSE in Canada has placed producers under considerable strain: producers fear not only a reportable or notifiable disease but the stigma that would come along with being 'the guy in the community that's got a positive'. Participants believed that producers were bearing much of the cost of surveillance and had yet to realize the benefits of surveillance programs initiated in part in response to the BSE crisis. These circumstances remain an ongoing challenge to surveillance: the negative consequences of an EID or reportable or notifiable disease are more tangible than the purported benefits associated with robust surveillance initiatives [36] . As surveillance serves the interests of producers, the foodproducing industry, consumers, and the public [44] , distributing the economic burden of surveillance among these parties is warranted. Though the cost of pathogen surveillance in animals is already distributed among these parties, the opinion expressed by participants suggests that further study is needed to ensure cost sharing is equitable.",
