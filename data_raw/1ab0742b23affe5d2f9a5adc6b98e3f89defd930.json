In ROC curve analysis, BAL fluid total WBC count showed the best discrimination, with an area under the curve of 0.855 (95% CI, 0.750-0.960). BAL fluid total WBC count $510/mL had a sensitivity of 83.3%, specificity of 78.3%, positive likelihood ratio (PLR) of 3.83, and negative likelihood ratio (NLR) of 0.21. When analyzed in combination with serum procalcitonin or C-reactive protein, sensitivity was 95.8%, specificity was 95.7%, PLR was 8.63, and NLR was 0.07. BAL fluid total WBC count $510/mL was an independent predictor of bacterial pneumonia with an adjusted odds ratio of 13.5 in multiple logistic regression analysis.",

            "text": "Severe pneumonia requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Delays in the provision of adequate antimicrobial therapy have been reported to be associated with excess mortality [1] [2] [3] ; therefore, rapid and accurate etiologic diagnosis of severe pneumonia is essential for successful treatment. In recent years, bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) has been established as a useful technique for collecting lower respiratory tract specimens from the alveolar level, and can thus be used to accurately define the causative organisms of pneumonia [4] [5] [6] . However, a conventional culture usually takes at least a few days, and microbiological yield is often compromised by prior empirical usage of antimicrobial agents. In addition, identification of viruses and atypical organisms requires a separate etiologic work-up. Cellular analysis of BAL fluid, including total and differential cell counts and the CD4+:CD8+ T-lymphocyte ratio, is useful for the diagnosis of various interstitial lung diseases [7] [8] [9] . Under an appropriate clinical setting, BAL fluid analysis can provide highly suggestive or even diagnostic information for specific interstitial lung diseases in the absence of a lung biopsy [10] . However, only a few previous studies with limited patient populations [11] [12] [13] have evaluated the role of cellular analysis of BAL fluid in patients with suspected pneumonia. Most of these studies focused on the differential diagnosis of pneumonia from non-infectious pulmonary diseases, not on the prediction of pneumonia etiology. BAL fluid analysis can be performed within several hours. Therefore, such analysis would be useful for guiding early treatment if it could predict the etiology of pneumonia, similar to the role of cerebrospinal fluid cellular analysis, which can reliably differentiate among meningitis etiologies. Therefore, this study investigated whether analysis of the cellular profile of BAL fluid can predict the etiology of pneumonia in critically ill patients admitted to the medical ICU.",

Total WBC count had the best diagnostic accuracy for predicting bacterial pneumonia, and its diagnostic performances was better than those of serum procalcitonin and C-reactive protein concentrations. Combinations of BAL fluid total WBC count, serum procalcitonin concentration, and serum C-reactive protein concentration provided the best diagnostic yields.

Stolz et al [11] . evaluated potential markers of bacterial infection in a cohort of immunocompromised patients with pulmonary complications. They reported that the percentage of neutrophils in BAL fluid and the serum procalcitonin concentration are independent predictors of bacterial infection. They suggested that the optimal cutoff value of the percentage of neutrophils in BAL fluid is 15% (sensitivity 84%; specificity 77%), which is much lower than the cutoff value in the current study. Sternberg et al. [13] investigated the usefulness of BAL in assessing pneumonia in renal transplant patients, and suggested that the optimal cutoff value of the percentage of neutrophils in BAL fluid is .20% for predicting bacterial pneumonia. However, neither of these previous studies included patients with severe pneumonia caused by respiratory viruses alone, and both compared BAL findings between patients with bacterial pneumonia and those with non-infectious diseases. In the current study, patients with viral pneumonia were included by using the newly developed multiplex respiratory virus RT-PCR. This showed that cases of viral pneumonia were frequently associated with neutrophilia in BAL fluid (median 54.0%). We speculate that this underlies why the optimal cutoff value of percentage of neutrophils in BAL fluid for predicting bacterial pneumonia is much higher in the current study (64%, Table 4 ) than in previous studies. Several authors of the current study previously investigated the diagnostic utility of soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (sTREM-1) in BAL fluid of various patient populations with bilateral lung infiltrates. A cutoff value of $60% neutrophils in BAL fluid is useful for differential diagnosis of bacterial or fungal pneumonia from other causes of pneumonia or non-infectious diseases (AUC = 0.77, 95% CI; 0.54-0.84, P = 0.001) [12] . In comparison to this previous study, the current study did not include patients with non-infectious diseases or fungal pneumonia, included much more cases of severe viral pneumonia, and analyzed the counts of various cell types.",

            "text": "Among the currently available inflammatory markers, serum procalcitonin is one of the best indicators of bacterial infections, including lower respiratory tract infections [19] . The usefulness of serum procalcitonin measurements has been validated in the diagnosis, severity assessment, and follow-up of patients with lower respiratory tract infections [20] [21] [22] . In the current study, the AUC of serum procalcitonin concentration for predicting bacterial pneumonia (AUC = 0.705) was smaller than those of total WBC (AUC = 0.855) and neutrophil (AUC = 0.837) counts. The combination of BAL fluid WBC counts and serum procalcitonin concentration tended to improve the diagnostic accuracy of the ROC model. This indicates that combinations of these markers can be useful to rule-out (BAL fluid total WBC count $510/mL or serum procalcitonin concentration $0.71 ng/mL with a sensitivity of 95.8% and negative likelihood ratio of 0.068) or rule-in (BAL fluid total WBC count $510/mL and serum C-reactive protein concentration $26.1 mg/dl with a specificity of 95.7% and positive likelihood ratio of 8.63) bacterial pneumonia. Diagnostic accuracy could be further improved if BAL fluid cellular profiles are interpreted alongside clinical presentations, radiographic studies, and other relevant test results. Using this approach, it might be possible to identify patients who can be managed without antibacterial agents or those who require antiviral agents.",

However, the proposed cutoff values of sTREM-1 concentration vary widely (5-900 pg/ml) and some studies have questioned the reliability of BAL fluid sTREM-1 [28] [29] [30] . Studies on BAL fluid sTREM-1 have mainly been confined to patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia. Therefore, the usefulness of sTREM-1 for etiologic diagnosis of pneumonia, especially differential diagnosis of viral pneumonia, has not been elucidated yet. The current study directly compared patients with bacterial and viral pneumonia, and therefore differs from previous studies of sTREM-1. BAL fluid sTREM-1 concentration in combination with the BAL fluid cellular profile might exhibit better diagnostic performance, although this warrants further studies.",

By using strict enrollment criteria, however, only a small proportion of pneumonia patients who underwent bronchoscopic BAL was finally included (Figure 1 ), which might have influenced on the results. However, positive likelihood and negative likelihood ratio, which are not influenced by disease prevalence, were good, which supports the validity of the data. In clinical practice, the results might be applied to patients who have received antimicrobial therapy more than 24 hours. That is, if BAL fluid cellular analysis shows evident pleocytosis even after antimicrobial therapy for more than 24 hours, it would be a strong suggestion for bacterial etiology.",

Moreover, since our study included critically ill patients with acute respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia who were not receiving antimicrobial therapy, our results may not be applicable to the majority of severe pneumonia patients in clinical practice. Second, the impact of antimicrobial therapy on the both BAL fluid cellular profiles and other inflammation markers such as procalcitonin, remains to be further elucidated. Third, cases of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, and mycobacterial pneumonia, were not included, mainly because few patients had these types of pneumonia. Fourth, patients with non-infectious causes of pulmonary infiltrates that can often mimic infectious causes, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, eosinophilic pneumonia, and drug-induced pneumonitis, were also excluded from our analyses. The inclusion of those cases may have caused a marked decrease in the specificity of our BAL fluid criteria. Finally, all the pathogens were not directly identified from BAL fluid. Some patients were included in whom pathogens were identified by other means, such as blood culture, endotracheal aspirates culture, urinary pneumococcal antigen test, and PCR from nasopharyngeal samples, as long as clinically and radiographically compatible and no other etiology was demonstrated. Therefore, patients with coincidental upper respiratory infections or colonization may have been included.",
