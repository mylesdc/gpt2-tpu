            "text": "The enzyme kynurenine aminotransferase (KAT) catalyses the conversion of kynurenine (KYN) to kynurenic acid (KYNA). Although the isozymes KAT1-4 have been identified, KYNA is mainly produced by KAT2 in brain tissues. KNYA is an antagonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate and \u03b1-7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, and accumulation of KYNA in the brain has been associated with the pathology of schizophrenia. Therefore, KAT2 could be exploited as a therapeutic target for the management of schizophrenia. Although currently available KAT2 inhibitors irreversibly bind to pyridoxal 5\u2032-phosphate (PLP), inhibition via this mechanism may cause adverse side effects because of the presence of other PLP-dependent enzymes. Therefore, we identified novel selective KAT2 inhibitors by screening approximately 13,000 molecules. Among these, glycyrrhizic acid (GL) and its analogues, glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) and carbenoxolone (CBX), were identified as KAT2 inhibitors. These compounds were highly selective for KAT2 and competed with its substrate KYN, but had no effects on the other 3 KAT isozymes. Furthermore, we demonstrated that in complex structures that were predicted in docking calculations, GL, GA and CBX were located on the same surface as the aromatic ring of KYN. These results indicate that GL and its analogues are highly selective and competitive inhibitors of KAT2.",

Additionally, we then compared inhibitory properties of these compounds with those of the KAT2 inhibitor PF-04859989, which binds PLP irreversibly. PF-04859989 was used at its IC 50 value of 300 nM, as determined in our assays. Because PF-04859989 binds to PLP, maximum reaction rates (V max ) varied but the Michaelis-Menten constant (K m ) did not change (Fig. 4a ). In contrast, K m values for GL, GA and CBX changed with substrate concentrations, whereas respective V max values did not vary under these conditions (Fig. 4b-d) . These results showed that GL, GA and CBX do not bind PLP, but act as competitive inhibitors of KYN.",

For comparison, we also present a crystal structure from the protein data bank (PDB; PDB ID, 2R2N) in Fig. 5a . All ligands were located in the ligand-binding pocket of two KAT2 molecules. To elucidate the interactions between KAT2 and these ligands, we magnified the structures of ligand-binding pockets (Fig. 6) , and identified residues that are involved www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ in hydrogen-bond formation and stacking, as shown in Fig. 7 . In these figures, the subunits A and B are shown in green and cyan, respectively. In the crystal structure of 2R2N, KYN forms hydrogen bonds with Asn202(B) and Arg399(B) (Figs 6a and 7a) , and the binding structure is stabilised by a \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions between the aromatic ring of KYN and the Tyr74(A) side chain. Although GL formed a hydrogen bond with Ser77(A), no hydrogen bonds were observed between GL and Asn202(B) or Arg399(B) (Figs 6b and 7b ). Yet CH-\u03c0 stacking interactions with Tyr74(A) may stabilise the binding structure. The hydrophobic moiety of GL was located on hydrophobic surfaces comprising Leu40(A), Tyr74(A), Pro76(A) and Gln73(A) and the carbohydrate chain of GL was located outside of the ligand-binding pocket. Similarly, the hydrophobic moiety of GA was located on the hydrophobic surface of Leu40(A), Tyr74(A), Pro76(A) and Gln73(A) (Fig. 6c) , and the binding structure of GA favours stabilisation by CH-\u03c0 stacking interactions with Tyr74(A) (Fig. 7c) . Although GA formed no hydrogen bonds with Asn202(B), Arg399(B) or Ser77(A), hydrogen bonds with Gly39(A) and Tyr142(B) were observed. The docking pose of CBX, which had a similar IC 50 value to that of GL, was also similar to that of GL (Figs 6d and 7d) . Moreover, the residues required for stabilisation of ligand binding by hydrophobic effects and stacking interactions were conserved among GL and its analogues ( Table 2 ). In particular, Tyr74 is considered one of the most important residues for ligand binding.",

The IC 50 values of these compounds (GL, GA and CBX) were low \u03bcM range on human KAT2 (Table 1) . Although these IC 50 values were determined at the basic conditions (pH9.5) to obtain the optimal fluorescence 26 , at the physiological conditions (pH 7.4), we confirmed that the IC 50 values of GL, GA and CBX on human KAT2 were almost the same as those of pH9.5 (7.93 \u00b1 0.17 \u03bcM, 9.87 \u00b1 0.32 \u03bcM, and 3.34 \u00b1 0.25 \u03bcM, respectively). We also showed that these compounds are highly selective for KAT2 among KAT isozymes and compete with its substrate KYN. Furthermore, we predicted complex structures using docking calculations and located GL, GA and CBX on the same surface www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ as the aromatic ring of KYN. These docking structures suggest that the high inhibitory activities of GL and its analogues reflect larger hydrophobic interfaces with KAT2 than with KAT2-KYN. In agreement, the hydrophobic effects of Leu40 and Tyr74 are common among KAT2 inhibitors that are described in previous studies 15, 16, 40, 41 . Furthermore, Gly39 forms a hydrogen bond with GA and with BFF-122 16 and the hydrogen bond between the inhibitor and Tyr142 of the KAT2-GA complex was also formed in the complex of KAT2 and NS-15024. In contrast, the hydrogen bond with Ser77 is unique to docking structures of GL and CBX. Yet the carbohydrate chain of GL, which is located outside of the ligand-binding pocket, is not likely to affect the affinity for KAT2. Because these inhibitors merely alter PLP binding, the risks of side effects may be minimised in comparison with those of PF-04859989 and BFF-122, which inhibit KAT2 by forming covalent adducts with PLP. In addition, compared with S-ESBA and NS-1502, which exhibit reversible inhibitory effects, GL, GA and CBX have potent inhibitory activities. Therefore, we successfully identified three new KAT2 inhibitors that are superior to other KAT2 inhibitors.",

These differences may arise from differences in conserved residues among species. Accordingly, in the sequence alignments of mouse, rat and human KAT2 reported by Pellicciari et al., sequence variants in human and rat KAT2 were associated with relative inhibitory activities of S-ESBA 38 . Our computational docking study shows that the hydrophobic effects of Leu40 in human KAT2 are important for its interactions with GL and its analogues ( Table 2 ). Among residues that participate in binding of human KAT2 to GL and its analogues, Leu40 is substituted to Ser in mouse KAT2. We speculate that this difference undermines the inhibitory effects of GL and its analogues on mouse KAT2.",

Because KYNA is predominantly generated by KAT2 in brain tissues [12] [13] [14] , specific inhibitors of KAT2 are eagerly awaited. Rossi, F. et al. solved the crystal structures of human KAT1 and KAT2, and showed important structural differences that could be exploited in the rational design of highly selective KAT2 inhibitors [42] [43] [44] [45] . In particular, human KAT1 and KAT2 share 15% overall sequence identity, and structural analyses of their active sites revealed striking differences in substrate binding pockets 42, 45 (for review see 43, 44 ). We also demonstrated that hydrophobic interactions between Leu40(A) and Tyr74(A) with GL and its analogues are similar to those of the KAT2 inhibitors reported in previous studies. But we suggest that Pro76(A) and Gln73(A) are additional unique residues that interact with GL and its analogues ( Table 2 ). These residues may be involved in the selective inhibitory effects of GL and its analogues for human KAT2. Although the mechanisms through which GL and its analogues specifically inhibit KAT2 remain unknown, these structural differences between KAT isozymes and the unique residues that interact with GL and its analogues are likely mediators of specificity. Hence, the present observations can be used to inform the rational design of specific and competitive KAT2 inhibitors.",

Because this crystal structure includes the substrate KYN and the coenzyme analogue pyridoxamine 5\u2032-phosphate (PMP), KYN was removed, and PLP was substituted for PMP before calculations. For this substitution, the PLP structure was optimised using Gaussian16 (Gaussian Inc., Wallingford CT, 2016) with B3LYP/6-31 + G(d,p). Missing hydrogen atoms in the PDB structure were computationally added using Hermes (https://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/). The centre of KYN in 2R2N was defined as the centre of the ligand-binding site, and the binding site radius was set at 10.0 \u00c5. Ligand structures were optimised at the same calculation level as for PLP.",
