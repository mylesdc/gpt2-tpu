            "text": "Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy severity depends upon the nature and location of the DMD gene lesion and generally correlates with the dystrophin open reading frame. However, there are striking exceptions where an in-frame genomic deletion leads to severe pathology or protein-truncating mutations (nonsense or frame-shifting indels) manifest as mild disease. Exceptions to the dystrophin reading frame rule are usually resolved after molecular diagnosis on muscle RNA. We report a moderate/severe Becker muscular dystrophy patient with an in-frame genomic deletion of DMD exon 5. This mutation has been reported by others as resulting in Duchenne or Intermediate muscular dystrophy, and the loss of this in-frame exon in one patient led to multiple splicing events, including omission of exon 6, that disrupts the open reading frame and is consistent with a severe phenotype. The patient described has a deletion of dystrophin exon 5 that does not compromise recognition of exon 6, and although the deletion does not disrupt the reading frame, his clinical presentation is more severe than would be expected for classical Becker muscular dystrophy. We suggest that the dystrophin isoform lacking the actin-binding sequence encoded by exon 5 is compromised, reflected by the phenotype resulting from induction of this dystrophin isoform in mouse muscle in vivo. Hence, exon skipping to address DMD-causing mutations within DMD exon 5 may not yield an isoform that confers marked clinical benefit. Additional studies will be required to determine whether multi-exon skipping strategies could yield more functional dystrophin isoforms, since some BMD patients with larger inframe deletions in this region have been reported with mild phenotypes.",

            "text": "Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy (DMD and BMD) are X-linked recessive musclewasting diseases arising from mutations in the massive dystrophin gene (DMD) that leads to degeneration of muscle. DMD is the most prevalent and severe form of childhood muscle wasting with a cited incidence of 1 in 3,500 live-male births, whereas BMD is a clinically milder form of the disease with slower disease progression [1, 2] . BMD mutations may present with a spectrum of phenotypes, depending upon the nature and location of the DMD lesion, as BMD mutations do not usually disrupt the reading frame, thereby allowing production of an internally shortened but functional dystrophin. BMD patients remain ambulant until at least 16 years of age but, in some mild or asymptomatic cases, may only be diagnosed by accident or late in life [3, 4] . Conversely, intermediate muscular dystrophy has been used to describe \"mildly affected\" DMD patients (those whose genetic structure would predict prematurely truncated dystrophin and loss of ambulation by 12 years of age) or \"severely affected\" BMD cases (those who would be expected to produce some functional dystrophin and therefore remain ambulant after 16 years of age). In 1989, Dubowitz stated that 'Intermediate DMD patients are defined as patients with a dystrophinopathy with onset of symptoms (of motor difficulties) by about 5 years of age, similar to the classical DMD patients but with a slower rate of disease progression, with loss of ambulation between 13 and 16 years of age.\" [5] . Children of the same age vary widely in clinical presentation, and patients that appear to have a milder dystrophinopathy have also been termed \"outliers.\" [6] In over 90% of DMD cases, correlation between the disease phenotype and the genotype is obvious. However, there are exceptions to the reading frame rule, where an in-frame deletion may result in a severe phenotype, or conversely, some out-of-frame gene rearrangements or nonsense mutations present with relatively mild symptoms, consistent with a diagnosis of BMD [7, 8] .",

In order to further evaluate a dystrophin isoform lacking the actin binding domain encoded by exon 5, we induced a transient dystrophinopathy model by skipping Dmd exon 5 in wild-type mice. Analysis of dystrophin, components of the dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex, muscle architecture and isolated muscle function, reveals moderate dystrophic changes in diaphragm, intermediate between mdx and wild-type phenotypes. Excision of Dmd exon 5 greatly reduced dystrophin expression in mouse diaphragm and compromised muscle function.",

Similarly, removing an in-frame exon carrying an intra-exonic protein truncating mutation [14, 15] , or a duplicated in-frame exon [16] , would allow synthesis of functional dystrophin isoforms. The rationale is that re-framing the DMD transcript will produce a BMD-like isoform and reduce disease severity. Examination of BMD phenotype:genotype correlations can indicate DMD transcript structures most likely to generate functional dystrophin isoforms and therefore inform exon skipping strategies [17, 18] . We propose that removal of DMD exon 5 alone is unlikely to provide significant clinical benefit, and alternative exon skipping strategies or treatments should be considered for dystrophinopathy patients with mutations within exon 5, or those with duplications of exon 5.",

A modest degree of muscle regeneration in the diaphragm from 5-PPMOk-treated mice is indicated by the presence of developmental myosin heavy chain (dMHC) in muscle fibres (Fig 4a) . Neither muscle regeneration nor fibrosis is evident in diaphragm from sham-treated C57BL10 mice, whereas abundant dMHC staining, fibrosis revealed by Picro-sirius Red staining and central nucleation is apparent in the 5-PPMOk treated C57BL10 and in the sham treated mdx mice, and is consistent with a moderate dystrophic muscle phenotype.",

In-frame exonic deletions may result in a severe phenotype if the deletion involves more than 25 exons in [32] ) or results in the loss of a crucial functional motif, eg that encoding the beta-dystroglycan binding domain or the first 20 exons [32] . Protein truncating mutations in the 5' region can lead to re-initiation of translation in exons 5, 6 or 8 and synthesis of a functional dystrophin [11] [33] . Secondary RNA processing events, not apparent by analysis of the DNA, may influence exon selection and processing of the transcript.

Interestingly, there were seven Detailed DMD transcript studies by Gualandi and colleagues reported that exon 6, present in the genomes of their exon 5 deletion patients was absent from the dystrophin mRNA, indicating that these genomic deletions compromised exon 6 recognition by the splicing machinery [13] . The loss of exons 5 and 6 from the DMD transcript would disrupt the dystrophin reading frame, consistent with a severe pathology. The patient that we describe had a genomic deletion of only exon 5, and RNA analysis indicated that only that exon was missing from the DMD mRNA. We hypothesize that the size and/or location of this particular in frame deletion, 10 .8kb compared to the 7.78 and 3.84 kb deletions identified in the other exon 5 deletion patients [13] , may have contributed to the processing of dystrophin exons during splicing. Gualandi and colleagues [13] proposed that a 2.1 kb block of sequence, immediately upstream of exon 6 and common to both DMD exon 5 deletion patients, influences splice site selection and the novel fusion introns favour exon 6 skipping. This possibility no longer seems likely since the deletion breakpoint in our patient is located between those in the DMD exon 5 deleted patients reported by Gualandi and colleagues [13] .",

Clearly, genomic rearrangements and the subsequent fusion of normally non-contiguous sequences can have unexpected consequences [36] . However, we were able to demonstrate that AO induced skipping of exon 6 in myogenic cells from our exon 5 deletion patient occurred at a similar efficiency to that induced in normal myogenic cells, suggesting that this 10.8 kb deletion does not compromise dystrophin exon 6 recognition and processing. Since the deletion of exon 5 does not disrupt the reading frame, but nevertheless the relative amounts of dystrophin were low as assessed by western blotting and immunofluorescence, it must be assumed that the quality of a dystrophin isoform lacking the amino acids encoded by exon 5 is compromised.",

Dystrophin expression and localisation, and muscle architecture in the patient's muscle is reflected by the analysis of 5-PPMOk treated mouse diaphragm. Dystrophin expression is greatly reduced, beta-dystroglycan and nNOS are somewhat reduced, developmental myosin expression is readily detectable in numerous muscle fibres and the muscle shows increased collagen staining, fibre size variation and the presence of central nuclei, indicating active muscle regeneration. These features are not quite as marked as those in mdx mouse diaphragm, in which dystrophin is undetectable apart from occasional revertant fibres. Although Dmd exon 5 is small and inframe, exclusion of this exon removes the entire second actin binding sequence and appears to severely compromise function of the dystrophin isoform, leading to a more severe muscle phenotype.",

The deletion of dystrophin exons 3-9 removes ABS 2 and 3, but caused only mild symptoms in a patient diagnosed with BMD after the age of 60 years [38] . Although this suggests that only ABS1 is needed for functional actin binding, Amann and colleagues [39] [40] [41] reported a cluster of basic repeats in the rod domain, amino acids 1416-1880 encoded by exons 31 to 40 also bound F-actin, and this secondary binding site contributed to the milder phenotype. Since the secondary binding domain would also be present in the DMD exon 5 deleted individuals, it is conceivable that the spatial disruption of the remaining ABS 1 and 3 compromises actin binding.",

Two brothers with a deletion of DMD exon 3, showed early onset dystrophy and loss of ambulation, but stabilised in early adulthood and did not have respiratory or cardiac insufficiency [29] . A Japanese male, diagnosed as autistic at age 3 years was subsequently found to have a DMD deletion of exon 4. He was reported to have mild pseudo-hypertrophy, modestly elevated CK, but with otherwise normal muscle strength [43, 44] . His three affected brothers were found to have similar severe mental retardation and also did not exhibit any muscle weakness.
