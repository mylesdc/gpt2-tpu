            "text": "In mid-February 2015, a large number of deaths were observed in the sole extant population of an endangered species of freshwater snapping turtle, Myuchelys georgesi, in a coastal river in New South Wales, Australia. Mortalities continued for approximately 7 weeks and affected mostly adult animals. More than 400 dead or dying animals were observed and population surveys conducted after the outbreak had ceased indicated that only a very small proportion of the population had survived, severely threatening the viability of the wild population. At necropsy, animals were in poor body condition, had bilateral swollen eyelids and some animals had tan foci on the skin of the ventral thighs. Histological examination revealed peri-orbital, splenic and nephric inflammation and necrosis. A virus was isolated in cell culture from a range of tissues. Nucleic acid sequencing of the virus isolate has identified the entire genome and indicates that this is a novel nidovirus that has a low level of nucleotide similarity to recognised nidoviruses. Its closest relatives are nidoviruses that have recently been described in pythons and lizards, usually in association with respiratory disease. In contrast, in the affected turtles, the most significant pathological changes were in the kidneys. Real time PCR assays developed to detect this virus demonstrated very high virus loads in affected tissues. In situ hybridisation studies confirmed the presence of viral nucleic acid in tissues in association with pathological changes. Collectively these data suggest that this virus is the likely cause of the mortalities that now threaten the survival of this species. Bellinger River Virus is the name proposed for this new virus.",

            "text": "The Bellinger River snapping turtle, Myuchelys georgesi, is a species of freshwater turtle that, prior to this outbreak, was rare and has a very restricted habitat. It is confined solely to a 60 kilometre section of the Bellinger River, and a short section of the adjacent Kalang River in northern coastal New South Wales (NSW), Australia. While the turtle had been described as \"locally abundant\" it was also described as \"meets the criteria for being listed as a vulnerable species under the Threatened Species Conservation Act of NSW\" [1] . In 2014 it was estimated that there were approximately 2500 of this species in the wild [2] . Commencing in mid-February 2015, a number of people using and managing the environment surrounding the Bellinger River observed a large number of deaths in M. georgesi. A multi-agency investigation was undertaken to establish the cause and extent of the outbreak. Mortalities continued for 7 weeks and involved mostly adult animals. More than 400 dead or dying animals were observed and population surveys conducted after the outbreak had ceased indicated that only a small proportion of the total population had survived with very few adults remaining. No other species, including the sympatric Murray River turtle (Emydura macquarii), appeared to be affected. Full details of the prevailing environmental conditions and the extent of the investigation have been described by others [2] . A number of moribund and dead M. georgesi were collected for post mortem examination at the Australian Registry of Wildlife Health, Taronga Conservation Society Australia Mosman, NSW. Tissue samples were referred to a number of different laboratories to test for a wide range of potential pathogens, toxins and water quality assessment. No consistent results were obtained from bacterial cultures and tests for mycoplasma, trichomonas, chlamydia and toxins gave negative results. On the basis of the histological changes and a failure to identify any other causative agent, a viral aetiology was suspected.",

Swabs had been collected from the buccal cavity (n = 5), conjunctiva (n = 5) and cloaca (n = 5) and placed in 3mL of phosphate buffered gelatin saline (PBGS, pH 7.3) and held at 4\u02daC.

Samples of frozen kidney (n = 5) or liver (n = 3) were also submitted from an archival collection of M. georgesi tissues that had been held at The Australian Museum, Sydney since collection in 1991. Suspensions (approximately 20%, w/v) of fresh tissues from affected animals were prepared by homogenising in serum free Minimal Essential Medium (MEM), containing penicillin (230\u03bcg/mL), streptomycin (250\u03bcg/mL) and amphotericin-B (5\u03bcg/mL), using a bead beater. The supernatant was collected after centrifugation at approximately 3000g for 20 min at 4\u02daC and filtered using a 0.45\u03bcm syringe filter.

Later, a selection of samples was also tested in an assay directed at the region encoding the 'spike' protein. For testing of samples in these assays, total nucleic acid was extracted using a magnetic bead based kit and a magnetic particle handling system [16] . The details of primers and probe are as follows: The qRT-PCR assays, both of which produced a 77bp product, used AgPath Mastermix (Life Technologies) and was run on an ABI 7500 thermocycler for 45 cycles under standard conditions as specified by the mastermix manufacturer. On each occasion the assay was run, included on the plate were two positive control samples, representing approximately 10000 (PC1) and 1000 (PC2) copies of viral RNA, a negative control (NC, a tRNA solution) and a 'no template' control (NTC), the latter consisting of nuclease free water. The positive and negative controls were included throughout the procedure from extraction through to the completion of the PCR reactions while the NTC was only added during the PCR setup. An exogenous RNA control [16] was also included to monitor the efficiency of the nucleic acid extraction and PCR reaction and to detect the presence of inhibitors. Any evidence of RNA amplification was recorded and results were expressed as cycle threshold (Ct) values as described previously [16] .",

This pseudoknot secondary structure is postulated to play an important role in the discontinuous synthesis of subgenomic RNAs [28] . The structure of this pseudo-knot differs from most other similar structures in coronaviruses by the presence of an additional stem in the region between the first stem and the \"kissing stem loop\".

            "text": "The virus described in this study, for which the name \"Bellinger River virus\" (BRV) is proposed, is believed to have had a profound impact on the wild Myuchelys georgesi population. The data presented provide strong, indirect evidence that this virus is the principal aetiological agent involved in the deaths of these M. georgesi. Unfortunately, as this is a now a critically endangered species of turtle [30], it is not possible to undertake experimental transmission studies to fulfil Koch's postulates. Nevertheless, the criteria for disease causation defined by Fredericks and Relman [31] have been met. BRV, as a novel nidovirus, was isolated from tissues of diseased animals, very high levels of viral RNA were detected in tissues with marked pathological changes and in situ hybridisation assays demonstrated the presence of specific viral RNA in lesions in kidneys and eye tissue-two of the main affected organs. No or very low levels of viral RNA were detected in normal animals tested at the time of the outbreak. Collectively these data suggest that this virus is the likely cause of these mortalities. The high levels of viral RNA in several different organ systems would suggest that this virus is actively replicating in these organs and these detections are not an incidental finding or due to contamination as a result of either ingestion or inhalation of virus from the environment. Nevertheless, although we believe that BRV is the principal pathogen, it is inevitable that other factors are likely to have contributed to the onset and severity of disease. The turtles were probably already in a stressed and potentially immunosuppressed state as they had lost considerable body condition [2] . The higher water temperatures may have supported and perhaps enhanced virus replication, a phenomenon that is well known for a number of aquatic viruses [32, 33] and, although other pathogens have not been identified, it is likely that other microbes, even commensals, may have contributed to disease severity and ultimately the death of these turtles. The M. georgesi population has been reduced to such an extent that the species has now been classified as \"critically endangered\" [30], with perhaps less than 100-200 animals present in the wild. The survival of the species may be dependent on a captive breeding population [2] due to the very small number of mature adults (possibly 10-15) that have survived in the wild (Chessman and Jones, Pers Comm [S1 File]. The impact of Bellinger River virus, the constrained geographical location of M. georgesi, the potential for hybridisation with Emydura macquarii and perhaps a range of environmental factors [2] have combined to seriously threaten the survival of this species of turtle. There are few documented instances where a pathogen has been directly incriminated in the potential extinction of an animal species [2] and to have such an impact in a very short time period. For example, while the chytrid fungus of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis has resulted in significant declines in amphibian populations in a number of countries and on different continents [34, 35] , its impact on amphibian populations has taken place over almost two decades, admittedly on a broad geographical scale. Table 5 . qRT-PCR results for viral transport medium containing swabs collected from mucosal surfaces of affected M. georgesi turtles using an assay detecting a segment of the putative replicase 1a gene. Results for samples with very high RNA loads (Ct<20) shown in bold. These animals correspond to the st 5 animals from which tissues were collected (Table 4) . At the time of its identification, this nidovirus was the first of the members of the proposed barnivirus genus (family Coronaviridae, subfamily Torovirinae) to be associated with disease in an aquatic reptile. Other barniviruses have been linked to infection and often disease in terrestrial reptiles. These include infections in ball pythons (Python regius) [18, 19, 36] , Indian rock python, (Python molurus) [20, 36] , Burmese python (Python bivittatus) [36] , green tree python (Morelia viridis) [21] , carpet python (Morelia spilota) [36] , boa constrictor (Boa constrictor) [36] and shingleback lizards (Tiliqua rugose) [22] . In the terrestrial reptiles, the predominant clinical presentation has been respiratory disease [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] 37] . Experimental infections undertaken in ball pythons [37] have also demonstrated a tropism for the respiratory tract. In this respect, BRV differs in that, while there are pathological changes in several organ systems, the most severe changes are in the kidneys, corresponding to the high viral loads detected. It is interesting to note that there was only evidence of BRV replication in vitro in kidney cell cultures. While there was evidence of visible cytopathology in primate kidney cell cultures, virus replication was also detected in MDBK cells when culture supernatants were tested by qRT-PCR. The tropism of this virus for kidney cells would suggest that renal disease was a key factor contributing to the death of these turtles.",

In each instance the viral RNA levels were close to the limit of detection and are of uncertain significance. The possibility that these are the result of superficial contamination from the environment cannot be excluded, and is likely for the egg casings as they were removed from the carapace of M. georgesi turtles in the Bellinger River.",

The apparent abundance of reptilian nidoviruses would suggest that this turtle virus may have originated in a snake, lizard or other reptile and that M. georgesi could be an incidental host. However, as detections of viruses from the order Nidovirales have also been reported in fish [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] and more distantly related viruses even in insects [46] [47] [48] , there are many potential reservoirs for this virus.",

These sample types have already been used to select a group of presumptively virus-free animals to establish a captive breeding colony [2] that remains healthy and apparently free of virus after 2 years in isolation. Serum, conjunctival and cloacal swabs from the animals in this captive colony have given negative results in the BRV qRT-PCR assays on several occasions over this 2 year period. However, the development of serological assays to detect antibodies to this virus in various animal species would also be advantageous to provide additional confidence in the presumptive virus-free status of captive breeding colonies. These assays would also be invaluable to support epidemiological studies and to assist the search for the origins of this novel virus. ",
