Nucleotide homologies ranged from 63.1-99.9% and amino acid homologies ranging from 60.2-100%. At least seven IBV genotypes were co-circulating in commercial chicken farms in southern China. The IBV isolates were genetically diverse and underwent continuing evolution. The QX-type, TW I-type, and 4/91-type were the most common genotypes during the three-year observation period and accounted for 88.8% of the isolated strains. Notably, the prevalence of the TW I-type strains has been increasing in recent years and has become the most common genotype in China. The emergence of variant IBV strains can be attributed to recombination. Serologic analysis and antigenic 3D cartography of 4 reference and 14 field isolated strains indicated the surveyed IBVs had diverse serology types and that the serotype of the isolated QX-type and TW I-type strains was distinct from the vaccines strains. Therefore, long-term continuing surveillance is necessary for IBV prevention and control.",

IB causes substantial economic losses throughout the poultry industry worldwide. IBV affects chickens of all ages causing upper respiratory disease, nephritic syndromes, and decreased egg production 1 . IBV has been circulating in China since 1982. The epidemiology of IBV in China is complicated due to the large geographical area, and multiple IBV genotypes and serotypes are known to coexist 2 . Our previous epidemiology monitoring during 2004 to 2012, found at least seven genotypes of IBV circulating. In that study, the QX-like IBV genotype that causes nephritis had become predominant in China 3-6 . Although IBV vaccines are widely used and most commercial chickens have been vaccinated, there are still frequent outbreaks of IB that cause clinical disease and production problems 7-9 . For example, widespread use of vaccines derived from Massachusetts (Mass) serotypes such as H120 and H52 did not prevent frequent outbreaks of IB in chicken flocks 10, 11 . IBV belongs to the genus Gammacoronavirus, family Coronaviridae, and order Nidovirales. Its genome is linear, non-segmented, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA that is approximately 27.6 kilobases (kb) in length. As with other coronaviruses, the IBV S1 glycoprotein contains virus neutralizing epitopes and serotype-specific sequences 12, 13 . The S1 protein is involved in infectivity and plays an important role in attachment to the host cell, as well as induction of neutralizing antibodies 14 . Given the importance of the S1 protein virus/host interactions, IBV genetic analysis and research of IBV has been primarily based on the S1 gene 15 .",

S1 variability is due in part to the lack of proofreading by the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP) that introduces mutations into the viral genome during replication. Variation is also introduced by the specific template switching mechanism used by coronaviruses, which frequently leads to genetic recombination 17, 18 . At least 30 serotypes of IBV have been identified worldwide. Vaccine cross-protection between serotypes is minimal 19 . Therefore, phylogenetic and genetic analyses have become tools for monitoring the molecular evolution of IBV and provide a fast and accurate method for genotype classification. In some studies, the genotype analyses have been used to predict IBV serotype and used to inform vaccine selection 20 .",

The S1 gene from each of the field isolates was sequenced and submitted to GenBank (accession numbers KX107628-KX107847). The accession number of each strain is provided Supplementary Table S1. Within the S1 gene, there were eight different nucleotide (1611, 1614, 1617, 1620, 1623, 1626, 1632, and 1635) and deduced amino acid (537, 538, 539, 540, 541, 542, 544, and 545) numbers. The most common (77.2%; 159/206) S1 gene included 1620 nucleotides. Sequence alignment indicated that the other S1 genes contained mutations, insertions and/or deletions resulting in nucleotides differences and different numbers of nucleotides and deduced amino acids. There were eight cleavage site motifs (HRRRR, RRFRR, RRLRR, RRSRR, HRSRR, HRHRR, HRHKR, and HRRKR) among the isolates. The most common cleavage site motifs were HRRRR (51.5%, 106/206), RRFRR (33.5%, 69/206), and RRSRR (9.7%, 20/206). Different from the Orthomyxovirus and Paramyxovirus, the cleavage site motifs of IBV were not related to host cell, serotype and pathogenicity, but more likely related to geographic origin 21 . However, the cleavage site motifs of IBV has become complex and diverse in many regions with the spread of IBV in worldwide. Similarity analyses showed the similarities of nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences ranged from 63.1-99.9% and 60.2-100%, respectively. These results indicated that the S1 gene of the field isolates was highly variable. The diversity of S1 gene may attribute to the lack of proofreading by the RDRP and specific template switching mechanism, and it is the mechanism of IBV to evolve and evade the immune surveillance of host.",

Compared to the classical QXIBV strain, the Cluster I strains have 96-98.2% nucleotide sequence similarity and 94.6-96.3% amino acid sequence similarity. The Cluster II strains have slightly lower nucleotide (94.9-97.2%) and amino acid (92-94.3%) similarities to QXIBV. Therefore, all the newly isolated QX-type strains deviated evolutionarily from the classical strains. Sequence alignment of 95 QX-type strains with reference strain QXIBV was performed. The result showed that there were large variations in some nucleotides universally between the two sub-genotype strains (Supplement Table S2 ). We speculated that the accumulation of nucleotide substitution may contribute to the formation of two sub-genotypes.",

Based on the phylogenetic analyses, all 55 of the strains isolated in this study are members of the TW I-type. The TW-type reference strains utilized here included five Taiwanese strains (TW2575/98, TW3468/07, TW3071/03, TW3263/04, and T07/02) and two strains from mainland China (CK/CH/HuN/NX09 and CK/CH/SC/ZJ10-1). TW I-type strains accounted for 26.7% (55/206) of all isolates and were found in ten provinces: Guangdong, Guangxi, Hubei, Fujian, Hunan, Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong, Yunnan, and Sichuan. The TW I-type strains were more prevalent than the QX-type viruses in Guangdong (33.3% vs 12.2%) and Guangxi (54.5% vs 28.9%).

Recombination occurred between nucleotides 919-1300. This region (919-1300) was 99.3% similar to 4/91, while the rest of the S1 gene was 97.3% similar to QXIBV. The variant CK/CH/GD/LZ1401-1 was isolated from Guangdong and shared less than 89.9% and 87.5% nucleotide and amino acid similarity with strains from other genotypes. The RDP analysis showed that this variant was formed from regions of three reference strains and required two recombination events. From nucleotide 1-735 the S1 gene of CK/CH/GD/LZ1401-1 was 98.2% similar to the HN08-type strain PSH050513, from nucleotide 736-1391 it was 97.8% similar to the 4/91 strain and the remainder of S1 was 98.6% similar to the QX-type strain YX10.

QXIBV was first recognized in 1996 and caused proventriculitis. In contrast, the QX-type IBVs prevalent in China today primarily cause typical nephritis. Since the discovery of QXIBV, LX4, and A2 strains in 1990s, the QX-type has become the predominant IBV genotype in China and spread to Europe [28] [29] [30] . Previously, the QX-type IBV accounted for 50-60% of field IBV isolates from 2004-2012 3-6 . Here, we saw a slight decrease in the prevalence of QX-type IBV.

Vaccination with Mass-type (H120, H52, and Ma5) and 4/91 vaccines is common in Taiwan, but TW I-type IBV continues to break out frequently 35 . Prior to 2009, the TW-type strain was rare in mainland China 5, 23 . However, since 2009 the prevalence of TW I-type IBV has been increasing in mainland China from 7.5% (2009-2010) to 16.1% (2011-2012) , and TW II-type isolates are also being found 6 . In this study, the TW I-type strains accounted 27.4% of isolated strains. More isolates of this genotype had been reported in China mainland 36, 37 . Notably, the prevalence of TW I-type strains was greater than QX-type strains in Guangdong Guangxi, and Fujian, and was the predominant genotype in all three provinces. Geographically, these three provinces are all on the southeast coast of China and close to Taiwan. It is possible that migrating birds introduced the TW-type strains to these areas. The TW I-type strain might be increasing in prevalence due to selective pressure from vaccination on other genotypes and the lack of vaccine efficacy against the TW I-type strains. Currently, there is little known about the biological characteristics of TW I-type IBV in mainland China. The 4/91 (also called 793/B-type or CR88-type) vaccine and pathogenic strains originated from Europe. The prevalence of 4/91 strains in China is controversial. Here, the 4/91-type strains accounted for 16.4% of strains isolates from 2013-2015. We found evidence that the pathogenic 4/91 strain is actively involved in recombination with native Chinese strains, suggesting that 4/91 has become an important gene donor in the genetic evolution of IBV in China. While the 4/91 vaccine is not officially approved for use in China, it is widely used on chicken farms. There is a risk that the recombination between the 4/91 vaccine strains and other virulent native Chinese strains (such as QX-type) and formed recombinant virulent strain. Therefore, it is necessary to continue monitoring the prevalence and evolution of the 4/91-type IBV.",

In this study, serotype classification was determined based on a two-way cross-neutralization assay performed in SPF chicken embryos. Relevant for vaccination control, the viral genotypes and serotypes of the vaccine strains were distinct from those of the most prevalent Chinese strains. We also observed a marked inconsistency between the viral genotype and serotype. This may be attributable to mutation of antigenic epitopes in S1 or immunity elicited to other IBV proteins such as S2 or N. Identifying the antigenic profile of emergent IBV isolates is important for vaccine development and effective control of disease outbreaks caused by variant strains. Antigenic cartography has been widely used to understand antigenic variation of the influenza A virus 27 . In this study, 3D antigenic cartography was applied to IBV. The results of the 3D cartography analysis were consistent with serotype classification by ARV. 3D antigenic cartography has the advantage of being intuitive and can be more easily visualized. The antigenic 3D cartography for 3 vaccine strains, the attenuated YX10-D90 strain, and 14 field isolated IBV strains. Viruses of the same genotypes are labelled with same tag. One unit in the 3D map corresponds to a two-fold change in the cross-neutralization assay. Distances between two viruses greater than two units on the 3D antigenic cartography map were considered different serotype strains. Therefore, this may be a useful technique for identifying antigenic variants and vaccine candidates for rapidly evolving variants of IBV.",
