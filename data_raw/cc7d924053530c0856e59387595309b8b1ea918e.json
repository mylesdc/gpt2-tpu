We consider a number of ventilation settings (SA, SB, SC and SD), and carry out a number of numerical simulations to explore how airflow dynamics interplay with other factors related to infection spread, such as outbreak detection. The main aim is: (i) to show how our methodology can easily be extended to any hospital ward structure by appropriately modifying the ventilation matrix V; and (ii) to show how, while some of our conclusions in [1] seem to be valid also for the hospital ward structure considered in this supplementary material, others might highly depend on the particular ward structure under study.",

We analyse the situation where an infected individual in room 1 starts the nosocomial outbreak and set, for illustrative purposes, parameter values p i = 0.01 m 3 \u00b7 min \u22121 , q i = 0.5 quanta \u00b7 min \u22121 and \u03b3 \u22121 i = 7 days for all patients in all zones as in [1, Section 4] . Ventilation rate over the whole ward is, as in [1] , 27 m 3 \u00b7 min \u22121 which equates to an air change rate of 3 AC \u00b7 h \u22121 .

For \u03b2 0 = 9 m 3 \u00b7 min \u22121 , matrix V is reported in Figure S1 for each ventilation setting considered in this supplementary material.

For this, we implement here the analogous analysis to that in [1, Subsection 4.4], to the hospital ward and ventilation settings represented in Figure  S1 . In particular, under the assumption that the detection and declaration of the outbreak occurs after two patients showing symptoms (each patient showing symptoms after an average time \u03b4 \u22121 ), we plot in Figure S2 (analogous to [1, Figure 5 ]) the probability mass functions of the number R of infections until outbreak declaration, for ventilation settings SA \u2212 SD. Mean values of these distributions are reported in Table S1 (analogous to [1, Table VIII] ). Figure S2 : Probability mass function of the number R of infections until the end or detection of the outbreak, for ventilation settings SA \u2212 SD. Declaration of the outbreak occurs once two patients show symptoms, and each infective patient shows symptoms after an average time \u03b4 \u22121 \u2208 {12h, 48h}. Global mixing rate \u03b2 0 \u2208 {9, 27} m 3 \u00b7 min \u22121 . Initial infective located at room 1 In general, ventilation setting SD is identified as the best for controlling infection spread, while ventilation settings SA, SB and SC can be identified as the least effective for this purpose. This is directly related to the location of the initial infective (room 1), the airflow dynamics represented by these settings, and the (asymmetric) location of patients within the ward. It is to be expected that setting SD maintains concentration of pathogen in the air low for rooms 2, 4 and 6, which are the ones containing three patients each, leading to small outbreaks.",

There is a clear interplay, as observed as well in [1, Figure 5 ], between the ventilation setting and the outbreak detection policy, where ventilation settings SA and SC behave better or worse depending on how quickly outbreak detection occurs.
