Up-regulation of TGF-\u03b2 in serum/peritoneal fluid and increased levels of pluripotent transcription factor OCT4 in endometriotic tissues are frequently observed in patients with endometriosis. However, the mechanisms underlying how TGF-\u03b2/TGF-\u03b2 receptor and OCT4 affect endometriotic cell migration still remain largely unknown. Therefore, endometriotic tissue with high cell migratory capacity were collected from patients with adenomyotic myometrium (n = 23) and chocolate cyst (n = 24); and endometrial tissue with low cell migratory capacity in normal endometrium or hyperplastic endometrium (n = 8) were collected as the controls. We found the mRNA levels of TGF-\u03b2 receptor I (TGF-\u03b2 RI) and OCT4 were significantly higher in the high-migratory ectopic endometriotic tissues than those of the lowmigratory normal or hyperplastic endometrium. Positive correlations between TGF-\u03b2 RI and OCT4, and either TGF-\u03b2 RI or OCT4 with migration-related genes (SNAIL, SLUG and TWIST) regarding the mRNA levels were observed in human endometriotic tissues. TGF-\u03b2I dose-dependently increased the gene and protein levels of OCT4, SNAIL and N-Cadherin (N-CAD) and silencing of endogenous OCT4 significantly suppressed the TGF-\u03b2I-induced expressions of N-CAD and SNAIL in primary human endometriotic stromal cells and human endometrial carcinoma cell lines RL95-2 and HEC1A. Furthermore, TGF-\u03b2I significantly increased the migration ability of endometriotic cells and silencing of OCT4 dramatically suppressed the TGF-\u03b2I-induced cell migration activity evidenced by wound-closure assay, transwell assay, and confocal image of F-actin cellular distribution. In conclusion, the present findings demonstrate that the niche TGF-\u03b2 plays a critical role in initiating expressions of PLOS ONE |",

Several theories have been proposed regarding the pathogenesis of endometriosis [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . It has been widely accepted that endometriosis originates from retrograde menstruation, wherein sloughed endometrial cells exit the uterus via the fallopian tubes [6] . Given the fact that regenerative capacity of the human endometrium is mediated by endometrial stem cells [7] [8] [9] , recent studies have reported a correlation between aberrant stem-cell activity in the endometrium and endometriosis [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . Several studies have reported increasing ectopic expression of stemness-related genes, including OCT4, in the endometria [15] [16] [17] and the upregulated OCT4 promoted the cell migration in human endometriosis [15] . However, the critical niche factors that regulate the OCT4 expression and cell migration in human endometriosis remain unclear.",

As OCT4 is frequently up-regulated in endometriotic tissues [15] [16] [17] , therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the roles of TGF-\u03b2I/TGF-\u03b2 receptor (TGF-\u03b2 R in human endometriosis by evaluating the expression profiles of OCT4 and TGF-\u03b2 RI in ectopic endometrial tissues. Furthermore, we examined the role of TGF-\u03b2I in OCT4 expression and identified the biological influence of OCT4 by knocking down OCT4 expression during TGF-\u03b2I treatment using human primary endometrium stromal cell as the in vitro model. Our data indicated that TGF-\u03b2I initiates the expressions of pluripotent transcription factor OCT4, and OCT4 expression may be a crucial underlying molecular mechanism of TGF-\u03b2I-stimulated cell migration in human endometriosis.",

As shown in Fig 3A, when compared with other growth factors or cytokines, TGF-\u03b2I most significantly increased the OCT4 mRNA levels in the endometriotic stromal cells (P < .001). To further examine the role of TGF-\u03b2I in the expressions of OCT4 and migration-related genes, as currently there is no appropriate endometrium cell line being available, three cell lines of RL-95-2 (epithelial carcinoma), HEC1A (epithelial adenocarcinoma), and primary stromal cells (mesenchymal chocolate cyst) were used to treat with increasing dose of TGF-\u03b2I (0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1, and 5 ng/mL).

By Mann-Whitney-U test. showed that the TGF-\u03b2I treatment dose-dependently increased the mRNA levels of OCT4 and the migration-related genes SNAIL and N-CAD in human endometriotic stromal cells. The HEC1A and RL95-2 cell lines, with an epithelial cell origin, also exhibited trends of increasing gene expressions of OCT4, SNAIL, and N-CAD with increasing TGF-\u03b2I treatment dosages ( Fig  3B) . The effect of TGF-\u03b2 on the protein expressions in human endometriotic stromal cells were further supported by western blotting analysis. As shown in Fig 3C, The TGF-\u03b2I dose-dependently increased the protein levels of OCT4 and the migration-related genes of SNAIL and N-CAD in human primary endometriotic stromal cells. To examine the role of the pluripotent transcription factor OCT4 in TGF-\u03b2I-induced expression of migration-related genes and endometrial cell migration, the primary human endometriotic stromal cells were transfected with either shOCT4 to generate OCT4-knockdown cells or control plasmids to produce control cells. The mRNA levels of OCT4 and the migrationrelated genes N-CAD/SNAIL evaluated using qRT-PCR were compared between cells with or without TGF-\u03b2I treatment. The TGF-\u03b2I-treated primary endometriotic stromal cells exhibited significantly increased mRNA levels for OCT4 and the migration-related genes N-CAD and SNAIL (Fig 4A) . Knockdown of OCT4 significantly decreased the N-CAD and SNAIL mRNA levels. These results were further supported by western blot analysis (Fig 4B) . Experiments performed on epithelial endometrium cell lines, RL95-2 and HEC1A provided additional support for the role of OCT4 in TGF-\u03b2I-induced expressions of migration-related genes (S1 Fig). These results suggested that TGF-\u03b2I may regulate the N-CAD and SNAIL protein expression through OCT4 in human endometriotic stromal cells.",

In a previous study, TGF-\u03b2-null females developed fewer and smaller peritoneal endometriosis lesions than did wild-type counterparts in a mouse endometriosis model [35] . Although TGF-\u03b2I/TGF-\u03b2 RI is hypothesized to induce the development of endometriosis by activating cell migration, the understanding of TGF-\u03b2/TGF-\u03b2 RI and stemness-related gene OCT4 in endometriosis remains to be elucidated. TGF-\u03b2 is upregulated in the peritoneal fluid of endometriosis patients [22] , and our results revealed high TGF\u03b2-RI expression levels in the endometriosis tissue. Because of the higher TGF-\u03b2 concentration in endometriotic peritoneal fluid, we treated the human endometriotic cells with a higher dose of TGF-\u03b2 to demonstrate the TGF-\u03b2 effect on the increasing expression of pluripotent transcription factor OCT4, thereby resulting in stimulated cell migration in human endometriotic cells.",

The upregulation of OCT4 transcription in somatic tissues has been associated with the initiation of cancer stemness and metastasis [42, 43] . Emerging evidence suggests that tumor metastasis is strongly influenced by EMT which is a hallmark sign of cancer stemness [44] . Studies have demonstrated that the transcription factors TWIST, SNAIL, and SLUG regulate EMT and increase cell motility [44] [45] [46] [47] . In support of the stemness and EMT, our previous report demonstrated a positive correlation between the expression levels of the OCT4 and EMT-related genes in ectopic endometriotic tissues, and the forced OCT4 expression promotes the cell migration in human endometriosis [15] . In advance of the previous findings, the present study results further demonstrated that there is a significant positive correlation of OCT4 with TGF-\u03b2 RI and TGF-\u03b2 RII (Fig 1 and S3 Fig) ; and the aberrant upregulation of TGF-\u03b2I/ TGF-\u03b2 RI in human endometriotic cells increases cell migration through the induction of OCT4 expression (Figs 3 and 4) . The OCT4 expression in ectopic endometrial cells, particularly in response to TGF-\u03b2I/TGF-\u03b2 RI signaling, may facilitate self-renewal and increase cell migration, initiating the development of endometriosis. This hypothesis is strongly supported by the recent findings that the risk of ovarian cancer was associated with aberrant TGF-\u03b2 signaling [48] .",

In the present study, we further demonstrated that TGF-\u03b2I stimulates the OCT4 expression, and the OCT4 expressed in the endometriotic stromal cells, in turn, mediated the TGF-\u03b2I/TGF-\u03b2 RI -induced cell migration. In addition to TGF-\u03b2, IGF-I is another serum marker for human endometriosis [53] . Reportedly, patients with late-stage endometriosis exhibited significantly higher IGF-I levels than did those with early-stage endometriosis and healthy control participants, which suggests that IGF-I is a crucial mediator of the development and maintenance of endometriosis or its progression to an advanced-stage disease [53] . In support, our results showed that IGF-I tends to increase the OCT4 mRNA levels in human endometriotic stromal cells (Fig 3A) . In consistence with these results, our previous study conducted using germline stem cells, demonstrated that the OCT4 expression was regulated by an IGF-IR-HIF-2\u03b1 signal loop in pluripotent mouse germline stem cells [54] and a IL-6-IGF-IR signal in HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma [55] .

The viability of human endometriotic stromal cells with or without shRNA and/or TGF\u03b2 (1 ng/ml) treatment for 24h was evaluated using a WST-1 assay. The cell viability at 24h is represented with folds when compare to that at 0 h incubation time. Three independent experiments were performed for each experimental condition.(TIFF) S3 Fig. Positive correlations between the expression of TGF-\u03b2 RII and OCT4 in human endometriotic tissues. The transcriptional levels (\u0394Ct of gene levels/\u03b22-microglobulin) of OCT4 were compared with those of the TGF-\u03b2 RII using the Pearson correlation analysis to determine the statistical correlations.
