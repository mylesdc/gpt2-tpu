The present study pooled data of two similar clinical trials to provide further evidence for the antiviral effectiveness of carrageenan. Methods: Individual patient data were analyzed from two randomized double blind placebo controlled trials assessing the therapeutic effectiveness of carrageenan nasal spray in acute common cold. Patients with virus-confirmed common cold (n = 254, verum 126, placebo 128) were included and the following parameters were appraised: duration of disease, number of patients with relapses, number of respiratory viruses and viral titers at inclusion (visit 1) compared to days 3-5 (visit 2). Results: Carrageenan treated patients showed a significant reduction in duration of disease of almost 2 days (p < 0.05) as well as significantly fewer relapses during 21 days of observation period (p < 0.05). The virus clearance between visit 1 and visit 2 was significantly more pronounced in the carrageenan group (p < 0.05). In both studies, virus-confirmed common cold was caused by three main virus subtypes: human rhinovirus (46%), human coronavirus (25%) and influenza A (14%) virus. Carrageenan nasal spray showed significant antiviral efficacy in all three virus subgroups, the highest effectiveness was observed in human corona virus-infected patients. The reduced duration of disease was 3 days (p < 0.01) and the number of relapses was three times less (p < 0.01) in carrageenan treated corona-virus-infected patients compared to control patients.",

Although common cold is a self-limiting disease, the symptoms such as runny nose, nasal congestion, sneezing, cough, sore throat, malaise and fever are troublesome, leading to more than 20 million doctor visits and 40 million lost school and work days per year [5] .

Food, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical industry use carrageenans extensively as emulsifying and binding agent for products like ice cream, various gels, toothpaste and others [6] . But carrageenans also revealed antiviral activity against a range of animal viruses [7] and are even used to prevent sexual transmitted viral infections as a component of spermicides [8] .

The current study aims to provide a deeper insight into the results of the two larger RCTs. Carrageenan is a large polymer which does not permeate the nasal mucosa and the antiviral effect is based on a physical mode of action only. Therefore, this host-independent mode of action allows pooling the data from a study in children and adults which would not be acceptable for a substance exhibiting a pharmacological action. Subgroups of individual viruses in the two trials were quite small, so pooling of data allowed the analysis of subgroups of the most frequently occurring viruses. In addition, it was investigated if the broad antiviral activity observed in vitro against enveloped viruses (influenza and corona virus) and non-enveloped viruses (rhinovirus) is also reflected in the clinical data. Therefore, data of two similar trials were merged and an additional analysis regarding the antiviral effectiveness of carrageenan nasal spray in patients with virus-confirmed common cold was performed.",

For the assessment of clinical effectiveness the following parameters were determined: (1) duration of disease and (2) number and frequency of relapses. The duration of disease was defined as the time until the last day with symptoms of common cold. Relapses were defined as re-occurrence of symptoms when the patient reported having common cold symptoms again after having reported at least one day without symptoms. For assessment of antiviral effectiveness the following variables were selected: (1) number of different viruses detected at V1 and V2, (2) change of viral titers from V1 to V2 and (3) number of patients with viruses at V1 and V2. Similar to adverse events which can occur several times in one patient, several common cold viruses can infect one patient at the same time. Consequently, for the calculation of the difference of viral titers between V1 and V2 the concept of virus events was applied, this means that calculations are performed for each virus individually. Gender and age were assessed as important demographic co-variables. The analysis of these parameters was performed for the virus-positive (VP) population and for patient subgroups that were positive for a specific virus of the most frequently detected ones (i.e., hRV, hCV and InfA).",

Since in some patients more than one virus was detected, treatment groups were compared with regard to number of viruses per patient on visits 1 and 2. Whereas at baseline, groups did not differ significantly, at visit 2 numbers of viruses per patient were significantly lower in the carrageenan group. Accordingly, the change in the number of viruses per patient between visit 2 and visit 1 was more pronounced in the carrageenan group: on average, a placebo patient cleared 0.15 \u00b1 0.07 viruses, while carrageenan treated patients lost 0.37 \u00b1 0.07 viruses in ITT population (p = 0.02).

Since it is impossible for an individual to determine the cause of a cold, it is important to know if the product used provides effectiveness against many different respiratory viruses causing colds. In the present study, the analysis of virus species revealed that human rhinovirus, human coronavirus and influenza A virus were the most common species. Nasal administration of carrageenan during common cold episodes consistently showed a reduction in duration of disease in patient subgroups infected with these three viruses. The decrease in duration of disease varied between 1.9 days for rhinovirus up to 3.9 days for coronavirus with infA lying in between with a reduction of 3.3 days ( Table 6 ). The study data suggest that carrageenan nasal spray exerts an unspecific effect on viruses of different etiologic origin, both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses. Experimental data support this notion showing that carrageenan exhibited a potent inhibitory effect on papilloma virus [9] . Moreover, in vitro and in vivo studies revealed that carrageenan was effective against several human respiratory viruses such as influenza A [11] human rhinovirus [10] , respiratory syncytial virus and also of human enterovirus 71 [12] . It was shown that the carrageenan polymer directly bound to the virus and prevented attachment of virus to the cells [11] . Hence, carrageenan works via an unspecific physical mode of action at a very early stage of virus life cycle.",

Figure 4 Percentage of patients with dynamic changes in viral status between visit 1 and visit 2. \"Deterioration\" was defined as > 50-fold increase of viral titer at visit 2 or detection of a new virus which was not revealed at visit 1. \"Improvement\" was defined as a > 50-fold decrease of viral titer at visit 2 or the elimination of a virus which was present at visit 1. \"No change\" was defined as a viral titer between 1:50 to 50:1 at visit 2 compared to visit 1. A: a ITT population p = 0.005 B: PP population p = 0.009. As common cold is a benign self-limiting disease, the decrease in viral titers between visit 1 and visit 2 in carrageenan-treated and in placebo-treated patients was expected. But carrageenan-treated patients cleared more than twice as many viruses compared to placebo-treated patients leading to more virus-free patients at visit 2 in carrageenan group (Table 4 ). It can be concluded that treatment with iota-carrageenan results in a significant reduction of the viral load and the number of detectable viruses already at days 3-7 (V2). Absence of viruses leads to a faster recovery and hence earlier clearance of symptoms. These data are in line with the results of all currently available clinical trials regarding iotacarrageenan-treatment during common cold [13] [14] [15] . A further benefit of carrageenan treatment was the significant reduction in relapses defined as recurrence of symptoms after a patient was free of symptoms for at least one day (Figure 3 ). Because most relapses took place after cessation of treatment a prophylactic effect of carrageenan nasal spray could be hypothesized. Similarly to all virus positive patients, relapses were reduced by carrageenan nasal spray in all three virusinfected patient subgroups. Again, patients infected with human coronavirus benefited most from carrageenan treatment showing a 2.5-fold reduction in relapses compared to placebo ( Figure 6 ). Human rhinovirus infected patients as well as influenza A infected patients revealed a twofold reduction in relapses when treated with carrageenan nasal spray.",

            "text": "The reduction of relapses and the reduction of virus titer in carrageenan treated patients might be of interest in particular patient subgroups with underlying diseases such as asthma and COPD. Numerous recent reviews discuss the presence of respiratory viruses as cause of exacerbations of asthma and COPD [20] [21] [22] . Acute exacerbations are associated with decreased lung growth in children or accelerated loss of lung function and, as such, add substantially to both the cost and morbidity associated with asthma [23] . Therefore, a reduction of virus load and persistence should have a beneficial effect for these patients. Especially children who frequently suffer from viral infections often involving more than one virus could benefit from the carrageenan nasal spray. Due to the physical mode of action and the favorable side effect profile, it could be used as a cost-effective long time preventive measure. The cost for treatment lies below one dollar per day. Further clinical studies should be done to investigate the prophylactic effect of the carrageenan nasal spray in patients with respiratory diseases as well as other patients groups where the prevention of viral infections is of utmost importance (e.g. cancer patients, immunocompromised patients). The limitations of this study include the retrospective nature of the data analysis, while some additional clinical information of the patients would have been necessary for underlining our findings. Furthermore, the clinical benefit of using carrageenan nasally was not measured e.g. by spirometry. However, in small children included in the data set, it is not always possible to perform spirometric measurements.",
