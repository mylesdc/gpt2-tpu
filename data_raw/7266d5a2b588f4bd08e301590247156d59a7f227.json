In this paper, we developed a high-throughput method to characterize mouse IgG antibodies using surface plasmon resonance technology. This assay rapidly determines their sub-isotypes, whether they bind native antigen and their approximate affinities for the antigen using only 50 \u03bcl of hybridoma cell culture supernatant. Moreover, we found that mouse hybridomas secreting IgG antibodies also have membrane form IgG expression without Ig\u03b1. Based on this surface IgG, we used flow cytometry to isolate rare \u03b32a isotype switched variants from a \u03b32b antibody secreting hybridoma cell line. Also, we used fluorescent antigen to single cell sort antigen binding hybridoma cells from bulk mixture of fused hybridoma cells instead of the traditional multi-microwell plate screening and limiting dilution sub-cloning thus saving time and labor. The IgG monoclonal antibodies specific for the native antigen identified with these methods are suitable for in vivo therapeutic uses, but also for sandwich ELISA assays, histology, flow cytometry, immune precipitation and x-ray crystallography.

            "text": "Introduction B cell hybridomas have been an important source of mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) since the initial production in the 1970s [1] . The most common approach for producing hybridomas has been to fuse B cells from mice hyper-immunized with the antigen with a myeloma B cell line lacking hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT). The fusion mixture is then seeded into 96-well plates and the hybridomas are selected with hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymidine (HAT) containing medium, which kills the unfused myeloma cells. Unfused B cells can't proliferate in vitro and finally die. Only the fused hybridoma cells can survive HAT selection and divide. Most commonly, supernatants from wells showing hybridoma growth are screened for antigen-specific antibody using antigen coated ELISA plates. The cells from positive wells are then sub-cloned at limiting dilution and retested to be sure of monoclonality.",

            "text": "Over the years, many useful mouse monoclonal antibodies have been successfully made by this fusion and screening method. However, it has two major shortcomings. First, mice hyperimmunized with soluble proteins not only produce antibodies specific for the native protein, but also those specific for epitopes unique to the denatured protein, especially when adjuvants such as Freund's adjuvant or alum are used in the immunization [2, 3] . While these latter antibodies can be useful for detection of denatured protein in western blotting; the antibodies specific for native antigen have a much wider range of applications, including in vivo therapeutic reagents, as well as sandwich ELISA assays, histology, flow cytometry, immune precipitation and x-ray crystallography. Assays performed with antigen-coated ELISA wells generally can't distinguish antibodies that recognize the native vs. denatured form of antigen protein, since absorption to ELISA plates denatures some of the protein due to the hydrophobic interaction between the plate surface and protein [4] . The second shortcoming is the traditional mAb selection method is labor and time consuming with several rounds of plate seeding and selection before the antibody can be fully characterized.",

The captured mAb was tested for its ability to bind the native antigen, following the binding kinetics with SPR from which the mAb affinity was estimated.

H71 was an IgG\u03b31 mAb and H22 and M1 were IgG\u03b32a mAbs. We used the BIAcore system to determine whether these mAbs recognize the same or different epitopes on the antigen protein. When tested separately all three mAbs bound the native MBP (Fig 2A) . To test whether these antibodies recognize different epitopes on MBP, H71 antibody was first captured on the chip and native MBP was injected and bound by H71 antibody. H22 and M1 antibody were then injected in sequence (Fig 2B) . The MBP bound to the H71 mAb subsequently failed to bind the H22 mAb, indicating that its epitope was blocked by the H71 mAb. However the M1 mAb bound well to the H71 captured MBP, indicating its epitope was well separated from that of H71 (Fig 2C) . This type data can allow for the rapid identification of pairs of mAbs that can be useful in developing a sandwich ELISA assay. Fig 2D shows standard sandwich ELISA data using wells coated with purified H71 mAb to capture various concentrations of MBP, which were subsequently detected with M1 mAb, but not with H22 mAb. In vivo therapeutic uses of mAbs to block receptor-ligand interactions has been very successful. To be useful these mAbs must bind to a receptor or ligand epitope that lies within the interface of the interaction. Fig 2E shows how this SPR method can be used to identify useful mAbs of this type. S161 and 2A8 are two IgG\u03b32a mAb specific for the Spike protein of the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). When either of these two mAbs was captured in an anti-IgG\u03b32a Fc flowcell, both bound injected native Spike protein. However, a subsequently injected soluble version of the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), Spike receptor, bound to 2A8 captured Spike protein, but failed to bind to the S161 captured Spike protein. These results identify the S161 mAb as a potential therapeutic mAb for blocking the interaction of the SARS-CoV with its cellular receptor.",

In non-activated B cells this splicing results in virtually exclusive production of the membrane form. In fully differentiated antibody secreting cells the mRNA expressing the secreted form predominates, but some of surface form is still produced [8] . This has also been documented in mAb secreted B cell hybridomas [9] . We confirmed this observation in our hybridomas that were produced with the Sp2/0 myeloma fusion partner by successfully staining the cells with various fluorescent anti-IgG Fc reagents (Fig 3A) . We also demonstrated the presence of the membrane form of the heavy chain mRNA in the hybridomas, although at a level much reduced from that of the secreted form (Fig 3B) . Interestingly, we could not detect the expression of Ig\u03b1, one of the surface IgG associated molecules involved in B cell signaling [10] , in either Sp2/0 or any of our IgG producing hybridomas, suggesting that these surface IgGs are not signaling receptors (S1 Fig). We performed additional experiments to assure that there was a tight association between hybridoma cells with surface expression of IgG and those secreting IgG. A previously single cell cloned hybridoma cell line, S161, described above, began to lose IgG secretion in culture over time. We found that not all of the cells had expression of surface IgG (Fig 4A) . However, after sorting the hybridoma cells with or without surface IgG expression respectively, we could only detect antibody secretion from hybridoma cells with surface IgG expression (Fig 4B) . Furthermore, when the heterogeneous hybridoma cells were sub-cloned at limiting dilution, only those clones that secreted antibody had surface IgG expression (Fig 4C) . This shows that the cell surface IgG expression on our Sp2/0 derived mouse hybridoma cells correlates with their ability to secrete mAbs of the same isotype. Others have suggested antigen specific hybridomas selected by cell surface Ig expression are more stable antibody secretors compared with traditional plate selected hybridomas [11] .",

Normally, the initially fused cells are distributed into multiple microculture plates at a dilution estimated to produce less than one HAT resistant hybridoma per well. Since the fusion to the myeloma cells is not selective, many of the resulting HAT resistant hybridomas do not produce mAb specific for the immunizing antigen. Therefore all wells with growing hybridomas must be screened for the mAb specificity. Also, problems can arise when a miscalculation of the cell dilution results in wells with multiple HAT resistant hybridoma cells, only one of which is secreting the desired mAb. Furthermore, since after fusion initial daughter cells of the fused hybridoma cell tend to lose chromosomes, progeny in a well arise that is no longer secreting the mAb. Therefore the hybridomas cells in a positive culture well must be cloned and rescreened before the overgrowth of the desired mAb producing hybridoma cells by other HAT resistant cells in the culture well.",

Then we fused spleen cells from OVA immunized mice with the Sp2/0 fusion partner in the standard way, but instead of culturing and selecting the hybridomas in microculture plates, we grew them in bulk culture with HAT for 8 days to kill the unfused Sp2/0 cells. The remaining cells were then stained with anti-IgG to identify the IgG producing hybridomas and also with the fluorescent OVA reagent to identify those specific for OVA. Cells positive for both antibodies occurred with a frequency of less 0.3% of the live cell population (Fig 6B) . Single double positive cells were sorted into individual culture wells of three microculture plates and, after 10 days supernatants of the resulting colonies were tested for OVA specific IgG secretion. This selection method is efficient and accurate, as 50% of wells had hybridoma cells growing in them and nearly 90% of these secreted IgG antibodies binding the native antigen ( Table 2 ). Since almost all of the clones secreted IgG\u03b31 antibody, we randomly selected 6 clones for V H and V L sequencing. Five of the six clones had the same V H and V L sequence suggesting at least some clonal outgrowth during the bulk culture (data not shown). As a negative control we also single cell sorted one plate of surface IgG positive, but OVA negative clones. All 40 of the resulting colonies secreted IgG, but only one secreted antibody binding the native OVA. This hybridoma cell was later found to be positively stained by OVA. The sorting of this hybridoma cell might be due to a system error. Thus, this selection method greatly improved the detection and selection of hybridomas producing mAb binding to the native form of the immunizing antigen prior to initial screening for antibody specificity.",

The first uses SPR with a small amount of primary hybridoma supernatant to identify quickly the IgG isotope of the mAb, its ability to bind native antigen and its affinity for the antigen. The second uses flow cytometry to take advantage of the strong correlation between hybridoma secreted and surface IgG in order to isolate either rare cells in hybridoma cultures that have switched to useful genetically downstream isotypes or rare antigen-specific hybridomas in a heterogeneous mixture of hybridoma cells grown in bulk immediately following fusion. Taken together these methods greatly reduce the time and effort required to go from the initial fusion to the isolation of hybridoma clones producing mAbs of the appropriate specificity and functions for downstream applications.",

We have shown examples here of how they can be used to identify IgG\u03b32a switch variants, rapidly identify mAbs suitable for sandwich ELISAs and identify mAbs capable of preventing virus/receptor interactions. However, there are other potential uses as well. For example our laboratories have used these antibodies successfully to improve co-crystallization trials with the antigens that have been difficult to crystallize on their own. It is thought that these antibodies work by shielding unstructured or highly mobile regions of the proteins from disrupting internal crystal contacts [16] . For example, we have successfully co-crystallized the JMJD6 transcription factor with the Fab region of a JMJD6 specific antibody. Binding of Fab to JMJD6 is essential for crystallization as it immobilizes the C-terminal flexibility of JMJD6 [17] .",

While these systems allow for the construction of very large libraries, not all antibodies express well in these organisms [19] . This problem would be circumvented with B cell hybridoma surface expression and modern retroviral expression systems also allow for large scale mutant libraries. Moreover, the simultaneous surface expression and secretion of the mAb would make it immediately available for in vitro and in vivo functional experiments.",
