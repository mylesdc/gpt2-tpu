However, biomedical research in ferrets has been hindered by the lack of rapid and cost-effective methods for genome engineering. Here, we utilized CRISPR/Cas9-mediated, homology-independent insertion at the ROSA26 \"safe harbor\" locus in ferret zygotes and created transgenic animals expressing a dual-fluorescent Cre-reporter system flanked by PhiC31 and Bxb1 integrase attP sites. Out of 151 zygotes injected with circular transgene-containing plasmid and Cas9 protein loaded with the ROSA26 intron-1 sgRNA, there were 23 births of which 5 had targeted integration events (22% efficiency). The encoded tdTomato transgene was highly expressed in all tissues evaluated. Targeted integration was verified by PCR analyses, Southern blot, and germline transmission. Function of the ROSA26-CAG-LoxP tdTomato StopLoxP EGFP (ROSA-TG) Cre-reporter was confirmed in primary cells following Cre expression. The Phi31 and Bxb1 integrase attP sites flanking the transgene will also enable rapid directional insertion of any transgene without a size limitation at the ROSA26 locus. These methods and the model generated will greatly enhance biomedical research involving lineage tracing, the evaluation of stem cell therapy, and transgenesis in ferret models of human disease.",

While mice have been extremely helpful in modeling human diseases, in some cases they are inadequate due to species-specific differences in the cell biology of the affected organ and/or the evolutionary divergence of their genome. The domestic ferret (Mustela putorius furo) has proven an excellent species for modeling certain human diseases when mice have failed, and technologies for genetic engineering in ferrets have expanded the potential use of this species for human disease research. However, until now, techniques for generating transgenic and knockout ferrets have predominantly relied upon genetic manipulation of fibroblasts followed by somatic cell nuclear transfer 1,2 . Such an approach is labor intensive and expensive. More recently, both clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/Cas9-and transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN)-mediated approaches have been used to generate knockout ferrets 3,4 . Here, we present a rapid method for generating transgenic ferrets using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated targeted insertion at the ROSA26 locus in ferret zygotes.",

Additionally, ferrets develop multi-organ lethal disease following Ebolavirus infection 6 and can replicate and transmit severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 7 .

Ferrets have also been used to study aspects of cortical neuronal development and neural progenitor cells [12] [13] [14] , and recently, knockout ferrets enabled the discovery an evolutionary mechanism involved in determining cerebral cortical size in humans for which conservation in mice is lacking 4 . The development of techniques to clone ferrets by somatic cell nuclear transfer 15 enabled the generation of the first genetically engineered ferret model of cystic fibrosis (CF) 2 , a recessively inherited genetic disease caused by mutations in the gene encoding cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Unlike mice, CFTR-knockout ferrets develop multi-organ disease of the lung, pancreas, gallbladder, and liver 1, 3, [16] [17] [18] [19] , whereas both mouse and ferret models contract different forms of intestinal disease 20 . Pancreatic disease, which lead to diabetes in CF patients, is also well conserved in CF ferrets [21] [22] [23] . Thus, the domestic ferret appears to be well positioned to model diseases of the lung and pancreas in situations where mouse models have failed.",

Generally speaking, mice are genetically more distant from humans at the protein level than ferrets 24 . For example, with respect to several classes of proteins potentially important for lung inflammation and remodeling, humans and ferrets exhibit significantly greater protein conservation than that observed between humans and mice (GO Terms: Cytokine Activity ( Figure S1A , P = 1.47E-12), Receptor Complex (Figure S1B, P = 9.24E-9), and Extracellular Matrix ( Figure S1C , P = 1.05E-13)). In this context, mice lack a direct ortholog of the IL-8 gene, which is present in ferrets and humans, and instead have three IL-8 paralogs (CXCL1/KC, CXCL2/MIP-2, and CXCL5-6/LIX) 25 . Moreover, given the conservation in ferret and human genes related to brain development ( Figure S1D , P = 7.85E-9) and visual perception ( Figure S1E , P = 8.14E-9), it is not surprising that disruption of the ferret abnormal spindle-like microcephaly-associated (ASPM) gene accurately models the most common recessive microcephaly genetic disease 3, 4 , and that this species has binocular vision 26 that closely models multisensory visual processing in humans 27, 28 . Notably, both of these attributes are not conserved in mice. Thus, an opportunity exists to create new genetically defined ferret models that share disease-relevant characteristics with humans and better predict the clinical success of therapeutics.",

CRISPR/Cas9 enables efficient sequence-specific mutations via the homology-directed repair (HDR) and non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathways. Typically, the HDR-mediated gene repair strategy has been used to establish targeted knock-in alleles with donor DNA templates, whereas the NHEJ pathway has been used to generate loss-of-function alleles by frame shift-mediated mutations 30 . NHEJ is the dominant DNA repair pathway in dividing and non-dividing cells, whereas HDR-mediated editing has a comparatively low recombination rate (reported in the range of 0-20%) 31, 32 . More recently, NHEJ-mediated targeted insertion in zygotes and embryos has evolved as a method for knock-in transgenesis in C. elegans 33 , zebrafish 34, 35 , and Xenopus tropicalis 36 . While CRISPR/Cas9-mediated HDR methods of large transgene-directed insertions have been reported in the literature for mouse zygotes 32 , to our knowledge, NHEJ-mediated targeted insertion in zygotes has yet to be evaluated in mammals.",

Using this approach, a Cre-reporter transgenic ferret with a convertible fluorescent reporter system was generated. The Cre-recombinase dual reporter system contains a CAG promoter, membrane-bound tdTomato (mT), terminator, and membrane-bound EGFP (mG) elements. Additionally, this transgene insertion is flanked by a Dual Integrase Cassette Exchange (DICE) system 39 to allow for rapid insertion of additional transgenes flanking the Cre-reporter or the directional exchange of the Cre-reporter for another transgene. The DICE system utilizes two phage integrase enzymes that recognize specific DNA sequence motifs within the donor and genomic target locus to facilitate recombinase-mediated cassette exchange. If one recombinase is utilized it will direct insertion only at the DNA recognition motif. This system offers complete control of gene knock-in, including orientation and copy number without a size limitation 39 . This flexible transgenic ferret model will enable highly efficient gene manipulation in ferret zygotes and facilitate both lineage tracing and stem cell therapy studies in ferrets.",

To identify the ferret ROSA26 locus, we aligned the ferret shotgun contig library (NCBI, NW_004569143) with the murine Rosa26 exon 1 sequence and identified the ferret ROSA26 exon 1 sequence.

We first designed sgRNAs targeting intron 1 of the ferret ROSA26 locus, selecting guides with high in vitro cleavage efficiency and low off-target scores (data not shown). These guides cut both the endogenous ROSA26 genomic locus and both sides of the 8 kb transgene cassette of the donor plasmid (Fig. 1) . The transgene cassette contained a CAG promoter with an intron driving expression of a LoxP tdTomato StopLoxP EGFP reporter gene. PhiC31 and a Bxb1 attP integrase sites were introduced into the flanking sequences of the reporter transgene for their potential use in DICE-mediated transgenesis 39 CRISPR/Cas9 mediates highly efficient homology-independent targeted insertion at the ROSA26 locus in ferret zygotes. The Cas9 protein from Streptococcus pyogenes was pre-complexed with the ROSA26-sgRNA to generate the RNP complex. Ferret zygotes were generated from Sable coat-color ferret crosses as previously described 42 and co-injected with the RNP complex and donor plasmid. This approach of using Cas9/ROSA26-sgRNA RNP to synchronously cleave the ROSA26 genomic locus and the donor plasmid DNA led to highly efficient NHEJ-mediated targeted integration of the transgene cassette (Table 1 ). In total, 151 out of 179 injected zygotes (84%) developed to the 2-cell stage and were transplanted into five pseudopregnant jills (Table 1) . Twenty-three kits were born from the these transferred embryos (15.23%), and six of the twenty-three kits (26%) showed expression of the tdTomato transgene, as assessed by an en face body scan (Fig. 2) .

Of note, this approach utilized self-inactivating gRNA target sites that theoretically should direct insertion of the transgene cassette in the reverse, but not forward, direction at the ROSA26 gene. This PCR analysis demonstrated that five (A1, A3, B2, B5 and D1) out of the six tdTomato-expressing transgenic ferret kits had targeted insertions at the ROSA26 locus (Fig. 3) . However, no PCR product was amplified from genomic DNA of the sixth kit (E1) when using standard primers that flanked the insertion site (data not shown). We hypothesized that a large deletion may have occurred in both flanking region for the E1 insertion and thus walked primers up to 1 kb away from the targeting site and still could not amplify a PCR product. Thus, we assume that the E1 transgenic animal randomly integrated the transgene. Of the five-targeted knock-in kits, three demonstrated a forward orientation of the transgene and two demonstrated a reverse orientation of the transgene at the ROSA26 locus (Fig. 3 , Table 1 ). Of note, all examined transgenic founders were heterozygotes for the transgene insertion at the ROSA26 locus, and three of these founders (B2, B5 and E1) contained random transgene integration events of which a subset appeared to be mosaic based on the intensity of Southern blot banding patterns presented below (Table 1) .",

Of importance, a specific band with a predicted size of 9.6 kb for a forward insertion of the transgene cassette was observed in A1, B5 and D1 animals using the 5\u2032-intron and the internal EGFP probes (Fig. 5B ). Equally noteworthy, results of Southern blotting for the A1, B5, D1 transgenic animals also showed different sized unpredicted bands (4.8 kb; 2.8 kb; 2.3 kb) with the 3\u2032-intron probe, suggesting that large indels likely occurred at the 3\u2032 junctional integration site of the ROSA26 locus (Fig. 5B,C) . Additionally, the B5 transgenic ferret also exhibited an additional band that hybridized to all three tested probes (a ~8 kb band using the 5\u2032-intron probe, a ~6 kb and an over 12 kb band using the EGFP probe, and a ~8 kb band using 3\u2032-intron probe), suggesting an additional random integration event. A specific banding pattern with expected sizes for a reverse orientation insertion (9.0 kb, 3.9 kb and 9.0 kb) of the transgene was observed in the genomic DNA of the B2 ferret using the internal EGFP, 5\u2032-intron, and 3\u2032-intron probes, respectively. This animal also has an unexpected 12 kb band detected by the EGFP probe, suggesting the occurrence of another random integration event (Fig. 5B,C) .",

We next sought to confirm the functionality of the Cre reporter within transgenic primary fibroblasts. Primary fibroblasts were derived from ear biopsies of transgenic ferrets and infected with a recombinant adenoviral vector expressing LacZ (Ad.LacZ; negative control) or Cre recombinase (Ad.Cre). As expected, there was efficient conversion of mT to membrane-bound EGFP (mG) following Ad.Cre infection in all the primary fibroblasts evaluated from live founders (Fig. 8A -C and data not shown). By contrast, uninfected fibroblasts (Fig. 8A) and Ad.LacZ-infected fibroblasts (Fig. 8B ) retained the expression of mT with no conversion to mG. However, the B5 founder had a subset of mT negative cells in both the Ad.Cre and Ad.LacZ infected fibroblasts (Fig. 8G,H) , suggesting that this founder was likely a chimera with most, but not all, fibroblasts containing the integrated ROSA26 transgene. This B5 founder was the only transgenic founder that produced fibroblasts lacking mT expression. Southern blotting of genomic DNA from these fibroblasts using an EGFP probe further confirmed Cre-mediated excision of dtTomato as indicated by a reduction in the size of the transgene cassette following Ad.Cre infection as compared to non-infected fibroblasts (Fig. 8D ). FACS analysis of Ad.Cre-mediated recombination in fibroblasts from the four surviving transgenic ferret founders demonstrated highly efficient conversion of mT to mG (89.2% for A1, 96.1% for B2, 58.9% for B5, 93.5% for D1) (Fig. 8E -H, and data not shown).

By using this protocol, transgenic ferrets harboring LoxP tdTomato StopLoxP EGFP dual reporter genes were generated using an sgRNA that concurrently cleaved both the ferret genomic ROSA26 locus and the donor plasmid, allowing for targeted insertion without the need for long homology arms. In comparison to conventional homologous recombination 46 and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated HDR approaches in mice 31,32 , results from Southern blotting analysis and germ-line transmission demonstrate that the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated NHEJ approach increased the efficiency of targeted integration in ferret zygotes. Despite this increased efficiency over HDR-based approaches, NHEJ-directed targeting integration has several drawbacks. First, although the approach is designed for directional insertion of the donor DNA, we observed that the insert effectively integrated in both the forward and reverse orientations. Second, indels at both the 3\u2032-and 5\u2032-junctions occurred, limiting the application for precisely introducing reporter constructs into genes. However, this can be circumvented using an intron-based insertion strategy that is compatible with capturing expression of a gene locus through the introduction of a splice acceptor within the transgene cassette. The addition of phiC31/Bxb1 integrase sites within the transgene cassette should also allow for flexible and rapid insertion of a second transgene juxtaposed to the Cre reporter, or for the directional exchange of the Cre reporter for another transgene using the DICE system 39 . Such applications in ROSA2 6-CAG-LoxP tdTomato StopLoxP -EGFP (ROSA-TG) ferrets could utilize transgenic zygotes as the target, or alternatively, recombinant viruses to engineer somatic cells in vivo. In this regard, the DICE system was reported as a high-precision DNA integration tool at a desired genome location that can rapidly generate gain-of-function genetic models by direct embryo injection 39 . Furthermore, a DICE-mediated transgene exchange in 2~4-cell stage ROSA-TG zygotes would be predicted to generate chimeric animals that lose the fluorescent signal in those cells that gain expression of the exchanged transgene. Such an approach could be useful to study the cell autonomous function of genes.",

The strategy incorporates the Cas9 gRNA sequences targeting the ROSA26 intron 1 into the flanking sequence of the donor plasmid. After injection of the Cas9 RNP complex into zygote pronuclei, the donor plasmid and chromosome are synchronously cleaved, allowing for efficient integration of the donor DNA. Integration is expected to occur more frequently in the reverse orientation since the gRNA targeting sequence remains intact in the forward insertion if indels are not generated.

To generate the transgene donor plasmid, the transgene cassette was cloned into pBlueScript SK II (+) (pBS-SKII) backbone plasmid (Agilent Technologies, La Jolla, CA) by multiple subcloning steps. In brief the following steps were involved: (1) A synthesized gBlock containing a linker of multiple restriction sites with PhiC31 attP, KpnI-phiC31attP-BamHI-NheI-XhoI-SpeI was first cloned into the KpnI/SpeI sites of pBS-SKII to generate an intermediate plasmid, pBS-SK-Phi31attP. (2) Another synthesized gBlock containing KpnI-BamHI-NheI-XhoI-pA-SphI-Bxb1attP-NotI was cloned into the KpnI/NotI sites of pBS-SKII to construct the intermediate plasmid, pBS-SK-pA-Bxb1. (3) The insert released from XhoI/ NotI digestion of the pBS-SK-pA-Bxb1 plasmid was subcloned into the XhoI/NotI sites of the pBS-SK-Phi31attP plasmid to generate an intermediate plasmid, pBS-SK-2attPs-pA. (4) A ROSA26-sgRNA (ccggcccgacttttggagaacatgcaccggtac) was then inserted to the upstream NgoMIV/KpnI sites of the pBS-SK-2attPs-pA plasmid to generate another intermediate plasmid, pSK-sgRNA-Phi31attP-Bxb1attP. (5) The pSK-sgRNA-Phi31attP-Bxb1attP plasmid was linearized by NotI/PciI restriction enzyme digestion and then a ROSA26-sgRNA (ggccgcccgacttttggagaacatgcacca) was subcloned into the sgRNA-Phi31attP-Bxb1attP cassette, resulting in the plasmid,",

(6) The LoxP-mT-Terminator-LoxP-mG fragment, isolated from the ROSA26-mT/mG plasmid (Plasmid #17787, Addgene, Cambridge, MA) by PmeI/NheI digestion, was subcloned into the pSK-sgRNA-Phi31attP-Bxb1attP-sgRNA plasmid at the EcoRI/NheI sites to construct the final transgene donor plasmid, pSK-sgRNA-Phi31attP-mT/mG-Bxb1attP-sgRNA. All oligonucleotides were synthesized at Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (IDT, Coralville, IA). The transgene contains a CAG promoter/intron-driving expression of the LoxP-tdTomato-stop-LoxP-EGFP cassette as previously described 43 and is flanked by Bxb1attP and Phi31attP sites. crRNA design and ribonucleoprotein complex preparation. crRNAs of the sgRNA were designed using CRISPOR (http://crispor.tefor.net) to target intron 1 of the ROSA26 locus. Three sgRNAs were screened using in vitro Cas9 RNP cleavage assays against a PCR product of the target. The most efficient sgRNA was used for all studies. The sgRNA complex was first prepared by annealing the mixture containing equal molar amounts of crRNA and tracrRNA in IDT Duplex Buffer at a final concentration of 10 \u03bcM and slowly annealed at 95 \u00b0C, with stepwise cooling to room temperature at a rate of \u22125 \u00b0C/min. To prepare the active ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex, the annealed sgRNA complex was then incubated with 1 \u03bcM of diluted Alt-R S.p. Cas9 Nuclease 3NLS (IDT, Coralville, IA) at a concentration of 1 \u03bcM in IDT Duplex Buffer for 30 min at room temperature. The crRNA and tracrRNA were also generated at Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (IDT, Coralville, IA). Animals and microinjection of zygotes. All animal experimentation was performed according to protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of the University of Iowa. Fertilized single-cell embryos (zygotes) were collected as previously described 42 . The mixture containing a final concentration of 200 ng/\u03bcl of RNP and 20 ng/\u03bcl transgene donor plasmid was microinjected (Femptojet, Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) into zygotes pronuclei (3~5 pl).
