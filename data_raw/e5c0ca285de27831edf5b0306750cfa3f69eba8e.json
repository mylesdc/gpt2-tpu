This report details the current situation of influenza surveillance and action plans to move forward in MENA-ISN countries. Data were presented at the 8th MENA-ISN meeting, organized by the M\u00e9rieux Foundation that was held on 10-11 April 2018 in Cairo, Egypt. The meeting included MENA-ISN representatives from 12 countries (Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Tunisia and United Arab Emirates) and experts from the Canadian Centre for Vaccinology, and the World Health Organization. Meeting participants concluded that influenza remains a significant threat especially in high-risk groups (children under-5, elderly, pregnant women and immunosuppressed individuals) in the MENA-ISN re-",

With this in mind, implementing a realistic vaccination strategy with available product in order to improve influenza vaccine coverage should be considered as the first-line strategy with whatever influenza vaccine available in a given country.",

A unified group of committed national experts, that is MENA-ISN with joint multisectoral and multidisciplinary efforts, will help to get further than individual efforts. The network can be the active advocate for acceptance of vaccination by HCPs and the public, by bringing key local stockholders together, explaining benefits of seasonal influenza vaccination and addressing misinformation.",

MENA-ISN works as a think tank to share evidence-based information, experience and best practices in order to address challenges in control and prevention of influenza, and to increase partnership and networking between countries and international organizations. The main objectives of MENA-ISN are the following: \u2022 Improve awareness and knowledge of influenza burden through effective communication, education and training; \u2022 Strengthen evidence base through surveillance and research; \u2022 Reduce the incidence of infection through effective prevention measures; \u2022 Increase influenza vaccine uptake and introduction into the national immunization programmes; \u2022 Develop the economic case for sustainable investment of National Plans. The purpose of this paper was to report on the current situation of influenza surveillance and action plans to move forward in MENA-ISN countries. Data were originated from the 8th MENA-ISN meeting, organized by M\u00e9rieux Foundation that was held on 10-11 April 2018 in Cairo, Egypt. The meeting included MENA-ISN representatives from 12 countries (Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Tunisia and United Arab Emirates) and experts from the Canadian Centre for Vaccinology, and the World Health Organization (WHO).",

In total, 28 professionals from 15 countries were trained to define influenza baseline and threshold values and five countries are working on publishing the results. Overall, 14 (64%) countries have seasonal influenza vaccination policies, five countries included influenza vaccine in their national immunization programmes, and three countries have policies for vaccinating healthcare providers (HCPs). A significant improvement has also been noticed in the number of high-risk people receiving seasonal influenza vaccines. The first scientific conference on acute respiratory infection in EMR (EMARIS) was held in December 2017 (Amman, Jordan) and gathered over 140 participants from 20 countries. 3 One regionspecific panel session was also held during the international conference on emerging infectious diseases in 2015 4 (Atlanta, USA).",

Several programmes on education of the community and HCPs are currently ongoing, but more still needs to be done.Finally, influenza burden (ie morbidity, mortality, loss of working hours) is not well described.

Given that elderly people tend to have diminished immune responses compared with younger adults, 14 increasing vaccination rates to protect elderly people, potentially using vaccine products which lead to more vigorous immune response, is also fundamental. Recently, several influenza vaccines that could have a better action have been tested in elderly people. The use of adjuvanted sub-unit vaccine (MF59) has been proven to be effective in reducing several influenza-related outcomes among the elderly, especially hospitalizations due to influenza-related complications.15 Compared with standard-dose influenza vaccine, high-dose vaccine was also",
