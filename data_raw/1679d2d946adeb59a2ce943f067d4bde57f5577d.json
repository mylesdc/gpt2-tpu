Protection from homologous re-challenge was recently demonstrated in cats recovered from primary infection. Here, we determined if cats recovered from \"Cand. M. turicensis\" infection were protected against infections with the more pathogenic M. haemofelis. Ten specified pathogen-free cats were exposed to M. haemofelis. Five of the ten cats had recovered from \"Cand. M. turicensis\" bacteremia (group A), and five cats were na\u00efve controls (group B). No cross-protection was observed. By contrast, the \"Cand. M. turicensis\"-recovered cats displayed faster M. haemofelis infection onset (earlier PCR-positive and anemic) than the controls. No \"Cand. M. turicensis\" was detected in any cat. M. haemofelis shedding was observed in saliva, feces and urine. In both groups, evidence of a Th1 response was observed (high IFN-\u03b3, low IL-4), but IL-10 levels were also high. In group A, total, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells increased within days after M. haemofelis exposure. At times of maximal bacteremia, macrocytic hypochromic anemia, neutropenia, monocytosis and a decrease in leukocyte, eosinophil, and lymphocyte counts and subsets thereof (B-and T-cells, CD4+, CD8+ and CD4+CD25+ cells) were particularly significant in group A. Moreover, an increase in protein concentrations, hypoalbuminemia and a polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia were observed. Five of ten M. haemofelis-infected cats subsequently cleared bacteremia without antibiotic treatment. In conclusion, the study suggests that a previous hemoplasma infection, even when the cat has ostensibly recovered, may influence subsequent infections, lead to an enhancement phenomenon and other differences in infection kinetics.",

            "text": "The diagnosis of feline hemotropic mycoplasma infection relies on the detection and differentiation of the infectious agents by sensitive and specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) [2, 7] . To quantify the humoral immune response to feline hemoplasmas, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) based on a recombinant M. haemofelis DnaK protein have been developed [8, 9] . The recombinant M. haemofelis protein recognizes antibodies to M. haemofelis and, to a lesser degree, antibodies to \"Cand. M. turicensis\" and \"Cand. M. haemominutum\"; the observed cross-reactivity of the humoral immune response led to the assumption of a potential cross-protection among the three hemoplasma infections. In a recent study, high levels of antibodies were detected in cats experimentally infected with \"Cand. M. turicensis\", even months after the infection and bacteremia had cleared [10] . These \"Cand. M. turicensis\" PCR-negative seropositive cats were also protected from subsequent \"Cand. M. turicensis\" challenge [10, 11] . Similarly, cats that had overcome M. haemofelis bacteremia and were PCR-negative and serologically positive for M. haemofelis were subsequently protected from a second M. haemofelis bacteremia after reexposure [12] . Limited information is available concerning potential cross-protection against infections with different feline hemoplasma species. In some naturally infected cats and wildcats, dual or triple infections with M. haemofelis, \"Cand. M. haemominutum\" and \"Cand. M. turicensis\" have been reported [13] [14] [15] [16] . However, in natural infections, it typically cannot be determined if the infections were simultaneously or sequentially acquired. Cross-protection might be expected only when the infections are sequentially acquired after an efficient immune response had been raised. Experimental coinfection was demonstrated in an early infection study using so-called large and small Haemobartonella felis strains [17] . However, these cats had not cleared the primary infection when superinfected with a second hemoplasma strain, and thus no cross-protection was observed [17] .",

To monitor M. haemofelis shedding, saliva and rectal swabs were collected at the time points indicated in Figure 1 and on days 141, 232 and 286 using commercially available cotton swabs as previously described [22] . Urine samples were collected from all cats by cystocentesis at one day prior to and on days 57 and 104 after M. haemofelis exposure and on day 28 from the cats in group A. Urinalysis was performed, and the urine sediment was evaluated using standard procedures. Clinical condition, body temperature and body weight were recorded at each sampling time point. M. haemofelis-infected cats that developed severe anemia (hematocrit < 10%) and/or were in a poor general condition were treated with doxycycline orally (10 mg/ kg/d, Gr\u00fcnenthal GmbH, Mitl\u00f6di, Switzerland) for 14 days, prednisolone orally (2 mg/kg every 12 h, gradually withdrawn, Streuli Pharma AG, Uznach, Switzerland) for ten days and fluid therapy (Ringer's lactate solution, Fresenius Kabi (Schweiz) AG, Stans, Switzerland) (see also Figure 1I ).",

The following antibody combinations were used: 1) a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated mouse anti-feline CD5 antibody (f43, Southern Biotech, BioConcept, Allschwil, Switzerland) recognizing T lymphocytes [31] and an unconjugated mouse anti-feline MHCII antibody (H34A, VMRD, Qiagen, Leipzig, Germany); 2) an R-phycoerythrin (RPE)-conjugated mouse anti-feline CD4 antibody (Vpg34, AbD Serotec, Puchheim, Germany) and a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated mouse anti-feline CD25 antibody (kindly provided by M.B.

Forward and reverse scatter gates were set for the lymphocyte population, and up to 10 000 events were acquired for each sample. Each lymphocyte subset was calculated as the product of the absolute lymphocyte number (determined by hematology) and the subset percentage (determined by flow cytometry) as previously described [32] .",

Statistical analyses were performed using Graph-Pad Prism Version 3.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA) and nonparametric tests. Parameters were compared between two groups using the Mann-Whitney U-test (p MWU ). The Wilcoxon signed-rank test (p W ) was used to compare the serum protein electrophoresis results from the same cat at two different time points. Friedman's test (p F ) followed by Dunn's post test was used to analyze the parameters over time when more than two time points were considered. Multiplicity adjusted p-values for each comparison in a family of comparisons were computed. For the correlation analyses, the Spearman rank correlation test was used (p S ), and the correlation (r) coefficient is given with the confidence interval (CI). P-values < 0.05 were considered significant.",

The cats in group A displayed fairly consistent high copy numbers (>10 7 copies/mL) starting between days 21 and 31, which persisted until days 49 to 56 after M. haemofelis exposure.

The cats in group A exhibited a significant increase in total serum protein and globulin and a decrease in albumin particularly at 3 to 8 weeks after M. haemofelis exposure, consistent with maximal bacteremia in these cats (Additional files 3A to C). The cats in group B exhibited tendencies that were similar but less pronounced than those of group A (Additional files 3F to H). Globulin concentrations were significantly higher in group A than group B on days 23, 30 and 37, and the albumin concentration was lower on day 37 post exposure (p MWU < 0.05; Additional file 3). Serum protein electrophoresis prior to M. haemofelis exposure revealed that the cats in group A had significantly higher \u02512-, \u03b2and \u0263-globulin values than the cats in group B (p MWU < 0.05; Figure 4B ).

Nine of the ten cats had \u0263globulin concentrations above the reference range (>16 g/ L) at days 44, 56/58 or 69 ( Figure 4D and data not shown). The albumin to globulin ratio was significantly decreased at all three tested time points after M. haemofelis exposure compared with pre-exposure values (p W \u2264 0.0137; data not shown). Moreover, on day 44 after M. haemofelis exposure, the \u03b2-globulin fraction was significantly higher compared with the preexposure values (P W \u2264 0.0091; data not shown).

By contrast, cats previously infected with \"Cand. M. turicensis\" infection exhibited faster onset of the infection and became PCR-positive and anemic significantly earlier than the na\u00efve M. haemofelis-exposed control cats. Moreover, the cats previously infected with \"Cand. M. turicensis\" had persistently high M. haemofelis bacterial loads (\u226510 7 copies/mL) and higher total, CD4+, CD8+ and CD4+CD25+ T cells than na\u00efve cats within days after M. haemofelis exposure. There are several possible explanations for the finding that \"Cand. M. turicensis\"-recovered cats became M. haemofelis PCRpositive significantly earlier than na\u00efve cats. Pre-existing antibodies against hemoplasmas might have impacted the kinetics of M. haemofelis infection in cats that had recovered from \"Cand. M. turicensis\" infection, e.g., through antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). ADE can increase the replication and distribution of pathogens, particularly viruses, e.g., feline corona virus [33] . However, ADE has also been suspected in bacterial infection [34] because the specific antibody response against Streptococcus pneumoniae enhances infection. It has been speculated that bacterial enzymes can modify specific IgA1 antibodies so that the binding of bacteria to the target cells is not inhibited but augmented, thereby facilitating the prolonged persistence of the bacteria at the mucosal surfaces of the respiratory tract [34, 35] . Because crossreactivity of antibodies to feline hemoplasmas, at least to the currently available recombinant M. haemofelis antigen DnaK, has been demonstrated [8, 9] , the occurrence of a similar phenomenon in \"Cand. M. turicensis\"-recovered cats with high antibody levels prior to M. haemofelis exposure cannot be excluded. Alternatively, chronically \"Cand. M. turicensis\"-infected cats may have become M. haemofelis PCR-positive earlier than na\u00efve cats due to modulation or down-regulation of the immune system. The influence of a hemotropic mycoplasma infection on the host immune system has not yet been completely elucidated. For non-hemotropic mycoplasma infections, a multitude of mechanisms have been described that might modulate or down-regulate the cell-mediated and/or humoral immune response of the infected host [36] .",

M. turicensis\"-M. haemofelis) but not homologous challenge (\"Cand. M. turicensis\"-\"Cand. M. turicensis\" and M. haemofelis-M. haemofelis) [10, 12, 11] . Based on the immune response after hemoplasma infections, a Th1 response was suspected in primary M. haemofelis infection in na\u00efve cats [12] , while primary \"Cand. M. turicensis\" infection in na\u00efve cats might be associated with an early Th1 response, with a subsequent switch to Th2 [11] . In cats that had recovered from \"Cand. M. turicensis\" infection, protection from reinfection was associated with an early and pronounced Th2 response [11] . While these results require further confirmation, the Th1/Th2 response may have at least partially contributed to the lack of cross-protection and the differences in the infection kinetics observed in the present study. If indeed \"Cand. M. turicensis\" infection leads to the stimulation of the humoral immune response (Th2), this effect might be counterproductive during subsequent M. haemofelis exposure, in which protection was observed in the absence of a Th2 response [12] . At the start of the study, in addition to the seropositivity for DnaK, \"Cand. M. turicensis\"-recovered cats had higher total lymphocyte counts, protein, albumin and \u02512-, \u03b2and \u0263-globulin concentrations than the na\u00efve control cats, indicating immune system stimulation in \"Cand. M. turicensis\"-recovered cats. In particular, the increase in globulin levels may indicate a predominance of the humoral immune response in these cats. Thus, the \"Cand. M. turicensis\"recovered cats, despite or even due to the observed seropositivity and the status of the immune system, may have been ill-prepared for subsequent M. haemofelis exposure. Consistently, within days after M. haemofelis exposure, \"Cand. M. turicensis\"-recovered cats exhibited higher total, CD4+, CD8+ and reactivated (CD4+CD25+) T-cell counts than the control cats.",

M. turicensis\"-recovered cats but not na\u00efve cats showed a transient decrease in lymphocyte subsets, especially in B cells, during maximal bacteremia. In a previous study, a transient decrease in lymphocytes during M. haemofelis infection was attributed to cell migration from the blood to the draining lymph nodes, where lymphocytes become activated and proliferative [12] . The increase in total protein concentrations suggests B cell activation during high bacteremia. This increase was paralleled by a decrease in albumin, possibly due to the role of albumin as a negative acute phase protein [37] . The increase in total protein at the time of maximal bacteremia is primarily attributable to the increased production of immunoglobulins, as demonstrated by the detection of polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia in the serum protein electrophoresis of samples obtained from nine of ten cats. While the observed hypergammaglobulinemia coincided with the high specific antibodies to M. haemofelis determined by recombinant M. haemofelis DnaK antigen ELISA, a large proportion of the immunoglobulins were probably not hemoplasmaspecific, reflecting polyclonal B cell activation. Mitogenicity and the activation of lymphocytes in a non-specific polyclonal manner has been well described for nonhemotropic mycoplasmas [36] . For Mycoplasma suis, a porcine hemoplasma, significant alterations to the RBC surfaces lead to the upregulation of naturally occurring B cells specific for self-antigens and the induction of autoreactive IgM and IgG, which in turn leads to extra and intravascular hemolysis [38] . A previous study demonstrated that M. haemofelis-infected cats harbor antibodies directed against the erythrocyte surface (Coombs' test positive) at the nadir of hematocrit values and at times of maximal bacteremia [24] . In the current study, Coombs' test was negative, but this test was performed at a later time point during infection, when B cell counts and immunoglobulin values had returned to pre-infection values.",

An increase in IL-10 transcription levels was also observed in a previous study in na\u00efve cats infected with M. haemofelis but not in cats protected from M. haemofelis re-infection [12] . IL-10 has multiple effects [41] : it inhibits Th1 cells and may be associated with B cell proliferation and antibody production. Thus, the high IL-10 transcription levels observed at times of high bacteremia would be consistent with the high serum protein, \u03b3-globulin and anti-M. haemofelis DnaK antibody levels observed at the same time. However, IL-10 is also considered a potent antiinflammatory cytokine that may limit the damage to the host due to exacerbated inflammation while prolonging pathogen clearance [41, 42] . Therefore, it has been hypothesized that the high IL-10 levels observed during maximal bacteremia in M. haemofelis-infected cats in a previous study might limit the inflammatory response to M. haemofelis and potentially prevent the clearance of these organisms [12] . Whether such an anti-inflammatory effect is beneficial during bacterial infections and sepsis has been debated. It is unknown if high (anti-inflammatory) IL-10 levels observed in the present study are associated with the decreased leukocyte counts and neutropenia observed during high bacteremia; among other hematological alterations, leukocytosis and neutrophilia are characteristics of inflammation. A reduction in local and systemic inflammation in connection with IL-10 may reflect the inhibition of cell trafficking, particularly the recruitment of neutrophils to the injury site, via inhibition of the production of neutrophil chemoattractants [42] .",

Positive saliva and rectal swabs were obtained during high bacteremia, but only infrequently and not persistently. This finding might explain why previous studies were unable to detect M. haemofelis in saliva and salivary gland samples collected at only one time point or late during infection in only a few cats [22, 43] . Moreover, the M. haemofelis loads observed in salivary swabs (a few hundred copies/swab) in the present study corresponded to those of \"Cand. M. turicensis\"-infected cats, as reported in previous studies [21, 22] . Because \"Cand. M. turicensis\"-infected cats fairly consistently shed \"Cand. M. turicensis\" via saliva during high bacteremia [21, 22] but the maximal blood loads were lower than in M. haemofelis-infected cats, factors other than blood load must play a role in whether feline hemoplasmas are shed via saliva. No M. haemofelis transmission studies using PCR-positive saliva or feces have been conducted. Transmission studies have been performed using \"Cand. M. turicensis\" PCR-positive saliva, but na\u00efve cats did not demonstrate infection after oral uptake or subcutaneous inoculation of \"Cand. M. turicensis\" PCR-positive saliva [21] . In the present study, M. haemofelis-positive urine samples were also observed. Because the samples were collected through cystocentesis, we cannot completely exclude a contribution of erythrocyte contamination to the PCR-positive result. However, M. haemofelis PCRpositive results were also detected in urine samples in which no erythrocytes were detectable using urine test strips and sediment analyses. The low M. haemofelis copy numbers in the saliva, feces and urine samples of M. haemofelis-infected cats and the infrequent shedding, even during high bacteremia, suggest a minimal risk of transmission through mutual grooming and the sharing of feeding dishes or litter boxes; however, this should be confirmed in future studies.",

M. turicensis\" infection, indicating that \"Cand. M. turicensis\" is probably not a good candidate for an attenuated vaccine against the more pathogenic M. haemofelis. The differences in the immune reaction patterns (Th1 versus Th2) after \"Cand. M. turicensis\" and M. haemofelis infections were further corroborated. The study provides the first evidence of the presence of polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia in cats infected with feline hemoplasmas. Moreover, recovered cats had higher lymphocyte counts. Finally, the study also suggests that a previous hemoplasma infection, even when the cat has ostensibly recovered, may influence subsequent infections and potentially lead to an enhancement phenomenon or differences in infection kinetics.",

C and D: comparison of the pre-exposure values (day 0; open squares) to those obtained on day 44 post M. haemofelis exposure (black squares). In A through D, the horizontal line indicates the median. P-values (A and B: p MWU , C and D: p W ) are indicated in the figure. E and F: representative results for serum protein electrophoresis (of cat FIA1, group A) before (E) and at 44 days post M. haemofelis exposure (F). Albumin concentrations were significantly lower and \u0263-globulin concentrations were significantly higher on day 44 after M. haemofelis exposure compared with the pre-exposure values (D; p W < 0.05). The electrophoretogram conducted with a sample collected on day 44 (F) illustrates polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia with a \u0263-globulin concentration of 40.2 g/L (reference range: 5.7-16.0 g/L).feces were between 200 to 780 copies/swab. Most of the positive results were obtained during high bacteremia. All saliva and rectal swabs collected on days 141, 232 and 286 post M. haemofelis exposure tested M. haemofelis PCR-negative (data not shown).",
