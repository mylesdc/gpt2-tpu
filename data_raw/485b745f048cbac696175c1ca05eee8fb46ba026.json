Although vaccines have been developed, antiviral therapy is an important complement that cannot be substituted. Because of the lack of specific approved treatment, it is urgent to facilitate the cascade of further understanding of the infection biology, identification of druggable targets and the final development of effective antiviral therapies. PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway plays a vital role in regulating the infection course of many viruses. In this study, we have dissected the effects of PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway on rotavirus infection using both conventional cell culture models and a 3D model of human primary intestinal organoids. We found that PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling is essential in sustaining rotavirus infection. Thus, blocking the key elements of this pathway, including PI3K, mTOR and 4E-BP1, has resulted in potent anti-rotavirus activity. Importantly, a clinically used mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, potently inhibited both experimental and patient-derived rotavirus strains. This effect involves 4E-BP1 mediated induction of autophagy, which in turn exerts anti-rotavirus effects. These results revealed new insights on rotavirus-host interactions and provided new avenues for antiviral drug development.",

            "text": "Numerous signaling pathways play important roles in regulating virus infection either by supporting or defending the infection of virus. 8 Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-protein kinase B (Akt)-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) axis takes a vital part in regulating various cellular functions and biologic processes, including protein synthesis, cell cycle progression, cell survival, apoptosis, angiogenesis and drug resistance. 9 In this signaling, PI3K serves as a key node, which is capable of monitoring panels of biologic processes via phosphoryl transfer. 10 PI3K could be activated by many types of cellular stimuli, which subsequently phosphorylates the inositol PIP2 to PIP3 that recruits Akt to the plasma membrane by binding to its N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain in which Akt gets activation via phosphorylation. 11 As a serine/threonine kinase, phosphorylated Akt is able to stimulate mTOR which belongs to a member of the serine/threonine phosphatidyl inositol 3 0 kinase-related kinase family (PIKK). 10 mTOR is an evolutionarily conserved Serine/ Threonine kinase playing indispensable roles in regulating mRNA translation, autophagy machinery and cell proliferation. 12 Furthermore, mTOR can directly activate a variety of cellular effectors such as p70S6 kinase (p70S6K) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) to control cell growth through integrating nutritional information and receptor tyrosine kinase signaling. 13 For instance, mTOR controls capped-dependent translation of both cells and viruses via inducing phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 to promote the formation of a functional eukaryotic initiation factor 4F (eIF-4F) complex. 12, 14 The eIF-4F complex comprises 3 subunits including a RNA helicase eIF4A, a cap-binding protein eIF4E and a scaffolding protein eIF4G. 15 Most of the 4E-BPs share a canonical eIF4E-binding motif (4E-BM) of sequence YX4LF with eIF4G (where Y denotes Tyr, X denotes any amino acid, L denotes Leu, and F denotes a hydrophobic residue). But some 4E-BPs contain non-canonical 4E-BMs connected by a linker (15-30 residues) , and the motifs are not conserved and not required for eIF4G binding. 15 Autophagy machinery, as another important downstream element of the mTOR signaling, is a cellular non-specific, bulk degradation process involved in removing damaged macromolecules and organelles to defend nutrient and environmental stress, 16, 17 which is also involved in regulating virus infection. 18 PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway as a potential antiviral target is involved in the infection of a broad spectrum of viruses including lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), 19 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), 20 HIV 21 and human cytomegalovirus. 22 In this study, we comprehensively studied the role of PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling in rotavirus infection and explored the avenues of therapeutic targeting. Besides conventional 2 dimension (2D) culture based immortalized cells, we also used 3 dimension (3D) cultures of primary human intestinal organoids for modeling rotavirus infection. 23 These organoids can recapitulate most if not all aspects of in vivo tissue architecture of intestinal epithelium. 24 We found that PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway is crucial in sustaining rotavirus infection via its downstream effector 4E-BP1 and the induction of autophagy. Importantly, targeting this pathway by pharmacological inhibitors/FDA approved drugs potently inhibited rotavirus infection, providing novel therapeutic approaches for combating this virus.",

            "text": "Since PI3K serves as a key node in the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway, its effect on rotavirus was tested. LY294002 is a potent inhibitor of PI3K. In human Caco2 cells, treatment with 5 mM LY294002 potently inhibited phosphor-Ser-240/244 S6 and phosphor-4E-BP1 (T70) but not the corresponding total proteins (as controls) ( Fig. 1A and Figure S1A ). Importantly, treatment with 1 and 5 mM LY294002 for 48 h resulted in 93.5 \u00a7 1.7% (n D 4; P < 0.05) and 81.0 \u00a7 6.8% (n D 4; P < 0.05) reduction of viral RNA, respectively (Fig. 1B) . LY294002 could also significantly suppress rotavirus RNA secretion ( Figure S2B ). The inhibitory effect of this compound was further verified by TCID 50 method, demonstrating that it could remarkably inhibit the production of infectious viral particles (Fig. 1C) . Western blot assay further confirmed that treatment with 0.1, 1 and 5 mM LY294002 could vigorously inhibit rotavirus protein synthesis in Caco2 cells (Fig. 1D ). The effect of this drug was also validated in human primary intestinal organoids. Immunofluorescent staining showed that phosphor-Ser-240/ 244 S6 was potently inhibited by treatment of 5 mM LY294002 (Fig. 1E) , supporting that human intestinal organoid is also a PI3K signaling proficient model. Consistently, LY294002 inhibited rotavirus infection in organoid model. For instance, 5 mM LY294002 resulted in 86.0 \u00a7 6.4% (n D 4; P < 0.05) reduction of viral RNA in human intestinal organoids (Fig. 1F) . Thus, blocking PI3K by LY294002 potently inhibits rotavirus infection in both Caco2 cells and human intestinal organoids. mTOR sustains rotavirus infection and the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin inhibits its infection mTOR is a central element of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway, we thus investigated its effect on rotavirus infection. To address this, Caco2 cells were transduced with integrating lentiviral vectors expressing shRNA to silence mTOR. One (No 8198) out of 3 clones showed potent knockdown based on western blot results ( Fig. 2A) , which was also confirmed by qRT-PCR (Fig. 2B ). Caco2 cells with mTOR knockdown or scrambled shRNA (as control) were inoculated with SA11 rotavirus and viral genomic RNA was quantified by qRT-PCR 48 h post inoculation. Silencing of mTOR led to a significant reduction of rotavirus RNA (Fig. 2C) , suggesting a supportive role of mTOR for rotavirus infection. Rapamycin is a clinically used mTOR inhibitor, and it was approved by FDA to treat/prevent transplant allograft rejection. 25 Phosphorylation of Ser-2448 mTOR, Ser-240/ 244 S6 and 4E-BP1 (T70) but not for the corresponding total proteins (as controls) were inhibited by treatment with 1, 5 and 10 nM rapamycin for 48 h in Caco2 cells ( Fig. 3A and Figure S1B ), except for phosphorylation of Ser-473 Akt. mTOR/S6K inhibition by rapamycin was reported to trigger a negative feedback loop to activate Akt signaling, 26 which might be the reason that rapamycin had minor inhibitory effect on phosphorylated Akt. Furthermore, treatment of 5 and 10 nM rapamycin significantly inhibited viral genomic RNA by 80.0 \u00a7 5.5% (n D 8; P < 0.01) and 79.9 \u00a7 5.8% (n D 9; P < 0.01) in Caco2 cells, respectively (Fig. 3B ). Rotavirus RNA secretion ( Figure S2C ) and infectious virus production ( Fig. 3C ) were also significantly inhibited by treatment of rapamycin. Consistently, western blot assay indicated that rotavirus VP4 protein synthesis was potently inhibited by rapamycin treatment (Fig. 3D ). In contrast, rapamycin lost its anti-rotavirus activity in mTOR silenced Caco2 cells (Fig. 3E) , supporting its specificity in inhibiting its biologic target to exert the antiviral action.",

Consistently, the anti-rotavirus effect of rapamycin was abolished in 4E-BP1 knockdown cells confirmed by both qRT-PCR assay (Fig. 5C ) and western blot assay (Fig. 5D ). To further verify, we obtained 4E-BP1 knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), and bona fide knockout was 4E-BP1 wild-type (4E-BP1-WT) plasmids; while this antiviral effect was abolished in 4E-BP1 KO MEFs transfected with 4E-BP1 plasmids having 5 mutations of the phosphorylation sites (4E-BP1-5A) (Fig. 5H ). Of note, the inhibitor of S6K did not affect rotavirus infection ( Figure S4 ).

Thus, these results indicate that these antiviral proteins are likely not essential in the anti-rotavirus action of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling. We therefore redirected our attention to autophagy, a cellular metabolism process functioning in orderly degradation and recycling of cellular components, which has been implicated in regulating many types of virus infections. 30 mTOR is the main inhibitor of autophagy. Rapamycin, as a specific inhibitor of mTOR, is a potent inducer of autophagy formation. 31 We first confirmed that starvation (EBSS medium containing 1mM pepstatin A and E-64-d solution, as a positive control) stimulated the autophagy process in Caco2 cells (Fig. 6A) . Consistently, the ratio of LC3-II to LC3-I (hallmark of autophagy induction) was upregulated by rapamycin treatment (Fig. 6B and Figure S1E ) or treatment with starvation ( Fig. 6C and Figure S1F ). Similar to rapamycin treatment ( Fig. 3B and D) , starvation also significantly inhibited rotavirus mRNA (Fig. 6D ) and viral protein synthesis ( Fig. 6E and Figure S1G ). Interestingly, induction of autophagy by rapamycin and starvation was confirmed to be via 4E-BP1. Because the autophagy is equally increased by rapamycin treatment, in which 4E-BP1 is not phosphorylated at all in the mutant (Fig. 6F) . Consistently, the upregulation of LC3-II/LC3-I ratio by rapamycin or starvation was blocked in 4E-BP1 knockout MEFs cells (\u00a1/\u00a1) (Fig. 6G and H) .",

Significant increase of rotavirus genomic RNA was found in all of the 5 knockdown Caco2 cell lines as quantified by qRT-PCR (Fig. 7B) . It was further confirmed that viral protein synthesis was increased in these 5 knockdown Caco2 cell lines (Fig. 7C ). Beclin1 plays an important role in localization of autophagic proteins to a pre-autophagosomal structure. 32 Similarly, knockdown of Beclin1 also favored rotavirus infection (Fig. 7D, E and F) . Of note, the 3 optimal knockdown (no 7865, 7866 and 7867) clones were found to increase rotavirus genomic RNA by 27.3 \u00a7 11.9 (n D 11; P < 0.01), 12.8 \u00a7 3.0 (n D 13; P < 0.001) and 8.2 \u00a7 2.1 (n D 17; P < 0.001) fold, respectively (Fig. 7E) .

It directly binds to the PI3K regulatory subunit (p85b), allowing the catalytic domain (p110) to phosphorylate Akt. 34 Recent structural study has provided insights into the mechanism by which NS1 activates the PI3K (P85b: P110) holoenzyme. 35 White spot syndrome virus (WSSV) stimulates phosphorylation of 4E-BP1, the downstream element of PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway. 36 Semliki Forest virus (SFV) and human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) have also been reported to phosphorylate the mTOR targets S6 kinase and 4E-BP1. 37, 38 In fact, PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway serves as a pro-or antiviral double-edged sword depending on the types of viruses.",
