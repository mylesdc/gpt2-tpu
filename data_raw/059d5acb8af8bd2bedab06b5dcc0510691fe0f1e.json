            "text": "In early January 2020, it became evident that a new pathogenic human coronavirus, provisionally named novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), had emerged in China [1, 2] . The virus is causing an outbreak, which started in the metropole Wuhan, but was seeded through travellers across China with ongoing secondary chains of transmission in a wider geographical area. As at 10 February 2020, 40,553 confirmed cases including 910 deaths have been reported worldwide with an increasing number of cases being reported in Europe [3] . So far, instances of secondary spread from international travellers have been limited, but clusters of human-tohuman transmission have been reported involving persons with close contact to confirmed cases [4] . A key knowledge gap is the efficiency of community transmission of 2019-nCoV, including the contribution of mild or asymptomatic cases. On 30 January 2020, the Word Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) because of these uncertainties, the ongoing seeding of the virus internationally, and the need for preparedness across the world in order to track and control the epidemic. WHO highlighted the crucial role of early detection of cases to interrupt virus spread and emphasised that countries need to put in place strong measures to detect and laboratory-confirm cases early [5] . Here, we assessed the required expertise and diagnostic capacity in specialised laboratories in 30 European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) countries.",

However, it remains to be seen how realistic the estimates are, particularly in view of the coinciding seasonal epidemic peaks of other respiratory pathogens such as influenza viruses. This will depend on the epidemiological developments in the 2019-nCoV outbreak and on whether the current worldwide control strategy of containment with active case finding [5] will be sustained and the indicated laboratory capacity will suffice. If the outbreak turns into a pandemic, specialised laboratories' efforts would refocus to reference activities like confirmatory testing, laboratory surveillance including virus characterisation, provision of reference materials and advice, while general testing for 2019-nCoV would shift to first-line hospital laboratories that currently do not have this capacity.
