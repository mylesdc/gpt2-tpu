The positive rates of HPIV-1 and HPIV-3 declined year by year during 2011-2013 and increased in 2014, while the positive rate of HPIV-2 showed a biennial trend and there were no obvious annual trend for HPIV-4 ( Table 1 ). The data of surveillance also indicated that the HPIV-positive rates were significantly higher during June to August than those in other months (v 2 = 18\u00c179, P < 0\u00c1001). The seasonal trend showed an increase month by month from May to the peak by July and then kept going down rest of months. Interestingly, there was a small peak during October and December in almost every year. Although HPIV-1 and HPIV-3 showed the same seasonal trend mentioned above, HPIV-3 was shown a longer spread than HPIV-1. High peaks of HPIV-2 were seen in April/May/ June/July/October/November, and the HPIV-4-positive rates were higher during July to November (Figure 1 ). HPIVs attack population of all ages. The highest rates of age-specific infection, however, were observed in children under 5-yearold group (67/753, 7\u00c175%) and followed by the patients over 60-year-old group (37/678, 5\u00c149%). The teenage group (6-to 15-year-old group) had the lowest positive rate (21/519, 4\u00c105%). The differences in age-specific positive rates were significant (v 2 = 26\u00c1168, P < 0\u00c1001). HPIV-3 was the main type for the children under 5-year-old group (23/39, 58\u00c197%).",

This 4-year consecutive study reported the prevalence and basic clinical features of HPIVs infections in patients with symptoms of ARIs during 2011-2014. HPIV-3 (88/217, 40\u00c155%) and HPIV-1 (569/217, 25\u00c181%) led to the most prevalent HPIVs infection in Beijing. In accordance with our results, a study performed in Yamagata, Japan, between 2002 and 2011 also showed that HPIV-3 was the main HPIV causative agent of ARIs in children. 6 But because wider agegroup patients were considered, our results showed that infants, young children, and elderly were the risk populations of HPIVs infection, especially HPIV-3 infection. The higher infections by HPIVs in summer in Beijing and the biennial trend for HPIV-2 were consistent with other reports. 2, 6 The circulating types and related intensity varied in different year, and the type-specific seasonal patterns were not well understood. Whether the higher detection rate in 2011 and 2014 was from the naturally rising HPIVs infection in population or from the different epidemiological trend for different types of HPIVs, more surveillance data would be needed. Our study also showed that the HPIVs were the secondly main respiratory pathogens for ARIs patients, so clarifying the epidemiology of the HPIVs is important for understanding and providing information to evaluate the respiratory disease burden in clinics and disease control policies.",
