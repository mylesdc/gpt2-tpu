In the event of such, a limited number of interventions would be available to reduce and control the spread of the disease and thus the resulting morbidity and mortality [2, 3] . Antiviral drugs could be used subject to availability, although their effectiveness against the novel pandemic strain is uncertain and resistance could develop quickly with large-scale use. Furthermore a vaccine specific to the pandemic strain would take optimistically, given current technology and production capacity, at least 6 months to develop and mass produce [4] . In addition to vaccination and targeted antiviral prophylaxis, other population-level social distancing measures such as school and workplace closures and travel restrictions are likely to be somewhat effective in reducing influenza transmission in the community [5, 6] , but implementation on a prolonged basis and with repeated waves of the pandemic could be difficult. Household-based quarantine and isolation will likely be effective in mitigating the impact of a pandemic [5] [6] [7] . There is however considerable uncertainty about the efficacy of some non-pharmaceutical interventions at the personal level including face masks and hand hygiene. Our proposed study, to assess the efficacy of masks and hand-hygiene for influenza control, is a direct response to the World Health Organization's recent call for urgent research on the efficacy of nonpharmaceutical public health interventions [3] .",

Vaccination is known to be an effective preventative measure [13] provided that the at least one of the vaccine strains closely matches the circulating strain [14] . Protective interventions at the personal level to reduce influenza transmission such as wearing masks and improving hand hygiene are often recommended [15] but few studies have investigated the efficacy of these measures outside nosocomial settings in a rigorous manner. Influenza is thought to be mainly transmitted through airborne droplet nuclei [16] but to a significant extent also spread by hand and surface transfer [17] . Some studies have suggested that transmission of upper respiratory tract infections was reduced after household-based hygiene interventions [18] [19] [20] , while a recent case-control study has suggested that masks and hand-washing may have been effective in reducing the transmission of SARS in a hospital setting [21] . A recent population study has suggested that improved hygiene measures and decreased community mixing during the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong resulted in reduced incidence of respiratory viral infections [22] .",

When worn by a non-infected subject in the presence of infected airborne droplets, surgical masks may reduce the amount of infected droplets inhaled and thereby reduce the chances of infection. However the degree to which a surgical mask can reduce airborne transmission is difficult to quantify given the lack of prior research in this area, and the expected benefit is uncertain. There are few apparent risks of wearing a mask, perhaps the greatest risk being that the mask engenders a feeling of overconfidence in the ability of the mask to prevent infection, leading to riskier activity (e.g. sitting closer to family members at mealtimes) than might have taken place if the mask were not worn, and thus an increased rather than decreased risk of influenza transmission.",

To try to mitigate these effects as much as possible we will only supply an alcohol-based hand cleanser which includes emollients, and encourage study participants to be wary of skin irritation. The other very rare potential adverse consequence, as with all topical applications, is allergic reaction. We will use a hypoallergenic product and exclude participants who have a known allergy to alcohol or additive components of the alcohol handrub deployed.",

Thus we will recruit a total of 3,420 individuals including 900 index cases with positive results on the QuickVue rapid diagnostic test, and 2,520 household contacts. The specified sample size would also have high statistical power to detect larger relative risk reductions if the observed secondary attack ratio were lower (Table 1) . To achieve this sample size, we would need to recruit approximately 6,000 suspected influenza cases and follow-up those who meet the specific criteria (in the majority of recruited subjects this would be a positive result on the QuickVue Influenza A+B rapid diagnostic test), and our reasoning is as follows. During the peak season we would conservatively anticipate that 50% of subjects with ILI symptoms, as we have defined these above, are infected with influenza rather than another virus (3,000 of the 6,000 tested). Recent international oseltamivir trials found that during the influenza peak season the proportion of subjects with influenza-like-illness who had confirmed influenza was 60% [29] and 66% [30] . Allowing for a sensitivity of 79% for the QuickVue test, only 2,370 index cases would be correctly identified (the remainder would be misclassified as false negatives). Given the estimated specificity of the QuickVue test of 92%, testing the 3,000 non-influenza index cases would result in misclassification of 240 subjects without influenza (false positives), and their households would also be visited. While the specificity of the symptom-based definition in 4(d) is likely to be lower, the sensitivity may be higher and with symptom-based recruitment only occurring in a small number of sites the approximate calculation above is appropriate. Thus we anticipate that we would need to recruit approximately 6,000 index cases with ILI symptoms and apply the specific criteria (typically the rapid diagnostic test), of who 1,477 (2,370+240) would meet our criteria and be subject to randomization and follow-up. Given the intention-to-treat approach, randomization and follow-up of some non-influenza cases is an expected consequence of the speed required by this study.",

If 10 imputed datasets are not sufficient to ensure stability of estimates we will use 20 imputed datasets. Multiple imputation makes maximum use of available data and maximises statistical power while requiring less strict theoretical assumptions than to a complete case analysis, or single imputation of mean values.
