            "text": "Noroviruses are associated with intestinal disease in humans, cows, pigs, mice, and, more recently, dogs. In 2007, the first canine norovirus (CNV) was identified and characterized in Italy. Subsequent studies have identified CNV in stools of dogs from Portugal, Greece, and the United States. To investigate the prevalence of CNV in the UK dog population, 228 canine stool samples were screened for CNV by qPCR, and 396 serum samples were screened for anti-CNV antibodies. qPCR of RNA extracted from canine stool samples did not reveal any CNV-positive samples, based on samples collected from diarrhoeic and control dogs in 2012-2013. CNV virus-like particles to three different CNV strains were produced using recombinant baculoviruses and a seroprevalence screen undertaken. Anti-CNV antibodies were identified at significant levels in canine serum; 38.1% of samples collected between 1999-2001 and 60.1% of samples collected in 2012-2013 were seropositive. The increase in seroprevalence over time (p,0.001) suggests that the CNV strains screened for are becoming more widespread. Variation in seroprevalence to different CNV strains was also identified. Two-thirds of the dogs were seropositive to a single strain, whereas the remaining third were seropositive to two or three of the strains analysed. This study has provided the first evidence that CNV is present in the UK, with seroprevalence identified to multiple circulating strains. This warrants further study and increased awareness of this recently discovered canine virus.",

An estimated three million people each year in the UK suffer from 'winter vomiting disease' caused by human norovirus [1] . Infection causes the classic symptoms of vomiting, diarrhea and malaise, and outbreaks are common in closed or semi-closed communities such as in hospitals, care homes, schools and cruise ships. In addition to the major burden of noroviruses on human health, noroviruses have also been found associated with intestinal disease in cows [2] , pigs [3] , mice [4] , a lion [5] , cats [6] and dogs [7] . The first canine norovirus (CNV) was reported from a single dog with enteritis in Italy in 2007.

Human noroviruses are grouped together in genogroups I, II and IV whereas CNV strains have been assigned to genogroups IV and VI. Human and canine noroviruses in genogroup IV share ,85% amino acid identity, thus are separated into different genotypes, IV.1 and IV.2 respectively.

As with human norovirus, CNV has yet to be cultivated in cell culture thus obtaining sufficient quantities of virus for serological screening is not possible. However, the major capsid protein of noroviruses (VP1) has been shown to spontaneously assemble into virus-like particles (VLPs) when recombinant VP1 is expressed in an appropriate system [15] .

Briefly, 1610 7 Hi5 insect cells were seeded into 106T150 flasks then infected with recombinant baculovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 5 pfu/cell. Infections were allowed to proceed for 6 days prior to protein harvest and VLP purification. VLP purification was performed essential as described [18] . VLP was released from infected Hi5 cells by freeze-thaw, followed by clarification to remove cellular debris (60006g, 30 minutes) then baculovirus removal (14,0006g for 30 mins). VLPs were partially purified through a 30% w/v sucrose cushion in TNC buffer (50 mM Tris HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM CaCl 2 ) containing the protease inhibitor leupeptin for 150,0006g for 2 hrs. The pelleted VLP was resuspended in TNC and further purified by isopynic centrifugation in caesium chloride (150,0006g, 18 hrs). The resultant VLP bands were collected by puncture and the solution containing VLPs was dialysed against PBS prior to quantification by BCA protein assay (Thermo Scientific) and storage at 280uC.",

Firstly it was shown that preincubating a serum sample positive to pooled CNV VLPs with human norovirus VLPs from genogroup I and II, did not diminish signal to CNV ( figure 4A ). This demonstrates that apparent reactivity to CNV is not a consequence of cross-reactivity to human norovirus strains. To investigate the antigenic relationship between different CNV strains, blocking assays were next performed using individual CNV strains. When a CNV seropositive sample was pre-incubated with CNV strain 170 VLP, subsequent detection in ELISA of strain 170 VLP coated on a plate was reduced. Pre-incubation with VLPs of a different CNV strain did not diminish signal. A similar result was shown when serum was pre-incubated with CNV strain HK VLPs; detection of HK VLPs by ELISA was reduced ( figure 4B and 4C) . No serum that contained anti-CNV strain C33 antibodies was available in sufficient quantities for the blocking assay, though the results from pre-incubation with C33 VLPs were sufficient to indicate that cross reactivity to strain 170 or HK was not occurring. This data overall demonstrates that anti-CNV antibodies against the three strains used in this study are strain specific, suggesting that CNV exists as distinct serotypes.",

            "text": "Seroprevalence to CNV in the canine serum samples collected from 2012-2013 was 60.1%. This is comparable to the seroprevalence to another enteric virus, CECoV, which has been reported to vary between 54% and 78% in a population of UK dogs [20] [21] . CNV seroprevalence was unexpectedly high given that CNV RNA was not detectable in 228 canine stool samples analysed in this study. The high seroprevalence suggests that many dogs are exposed to the virus, with the inability to detect actively secreted viral RNA attributable to two possible factors. Firstly, it is likely that, as with the majority of human norovirus infections in man, CNV infection is very acute with virus only shed during a short period of time. Acute gastroenteritis caused by human norovirus in man results in peak viral shedding at 2-4 days after infection. By 3 weeks after infection only 25% cases are still positive for viral RNA [22] . Preliminary epidemiological data from a study involving a kennel outbreak of CNV in seven dogs found no virus detectable one week after the onset of clinical signs [9] . It is worth noting that although human norovirus is responsible for millions of infections worldwide each year, the virus is only identified in approximately 12% of diarrhoeic samples submitted for analysis [23] . A second explanation for the low prevalence of antigen detection could be due to the genetic heterogeneity of CNV. Significant sequence variation has been shown between the CNV strains characterized so far, and there is evidence of recombination between canine norovirus strains and noroviruses of different genogroups [13] . Design of the primer-probe used in this study was based on a highly conserved region of the CNV genome (NS7), but small sequence differences will affect the ability of the viral sequence to be amplified. Although strains circulating in the UK are antigenically similar to previously identified strains, minor sequence differences could reduce the chance of detection in a PCR screen. To address this, a primer set designed to be broadly reactive to a wide range of noroviruses and sapoviruses (p289/290 [24] ) was used to reanalyze the samples. In addition, it must be noted that the primer-probe used in the qPCR survey for CNV RNA was designed prior to the publication of the HK sequence. The HK sequence differences are such that the primerprobe used in the qPCR survey would not detect strain HK. In light of the results of the serosurvey, this issue was addressed retrospectively to the first viral RNA survey. A new primer set was designed to detect the most conserved region of the HK VP1 protein. A SYBR-based qPCR assay was used to screen all 228 stool samples for the presence of any norovirus strain using primer pair p289/290 and also specifically for CNV strain HK using a newly designed primer pair. No positive samples were identified using either primer pair (data not shown).",

In the 1999-2001 cohort of dogs 38.1% were seropositive, whereas in the 2012-2013 cohort this proportion has almost doubled. Not only does this data provide the first proof that CNV has been present in dogs for at least 8 years prior to its initial discovery [7] , it also implies that the number of dogs exposed to these strains of CNV has significantly increased during this period. This conclusion does come with certain caveats however, as the study populations of dogs used are not directly comparable. The 1999-2001 samples were collected from dogs that had been at a rehoming kennels for 3 weeks whereas the 2012-2013 dogs were all privately owned pets. Seroprevalence and overall viral prevalence to many viruses is known to be higher in facilities where dogs are kept in close contact [21] [25] . This does suggest that the apparent increase in seroprevalence to the CNV strains studied is real, as typically owned pets will be exposed less frequently to viruses than dogs in kennels. It would be valuable to assess the current CNV seroprevalence in kenneled dogs, which is predicted to be greater than 60%.",

CNV strains included were identified in 2007 from Italy (170), Portugal (C33) and Hong Kong (HK). Following the initial serosurvey with the pooled VLPs, positive samples were entered into ELISAs with VLPs from each of the individual strains separately. Our data would indicate reactivity to all three strains in the UK dog population. Blocking assays demonstrated no significant crossreactivity between the three CNV strains in the samples tested, proving that antibodies generated in response to infection were likely to be strain specific. The human immune response against human norovirus is of short duration (up to 14 weeks) and is homotypic, i.e. the immunity acquired for a genogroup or a particular genotype does not provide effective protection against another genogroup or genotype [26] . This study therefore reveals that at least three antigenically distinct CNV strains have been circulating in the UK dog population. This is similar to the coexistence of human norovirus strains in the human population, with both genogroup I and genogroup II strains circulating [27] [28] [29] .",

Our data also identified variation between the prevalence of the different strains, with the highest seroprevalence in both cohorts demonstrated for CNV strain HK (see table 1 ). This strain has been classified as a GVI norovirus, along with the Portuguese strain C33. However, strain HK has the highest sequence identity (51.6%) to an intergenotype GII recombinant human norovirus strain and it is suggested that strain HK may be classified into a novel genogroup [19] . Aside from this phylogenetic information, it is not possible to determine if the higher seroprevalence to strain HK in our study is due to a viral fitness advantage, and further molecular characterization is required.",
