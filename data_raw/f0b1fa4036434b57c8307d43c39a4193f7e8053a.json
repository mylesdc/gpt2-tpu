Since the emergence of the new A(H7N9) virus, more than 400 human cases were reported to the WHO with a mortality rate of more than 35%. Most patients with A(H7N9) infections had contact with poultry or visited live animal markets. However, some sporadic cases seemed to be a result of human to human transmissions [1, 2] . In contrast to pandemic viruses which fulminantly enter the human population and cause high mortality rates, seasonal influenza viruses generally cause uncomplicated and transient infections in humans, with virus replication localized to the upper respiratory tract [3, 4] . However, in its fully developed form influenza is an acute respiratory disease resulting in hospitalizations and deaths mainly among high-risk groups. Worldwide, annual epidemics result in about three to five million cases of severe illness, and about 250,000 to 500,000 deaths [5] . For this reason WHO [6] and CDC [7] recommend antiviral treatment for any patient with suspected influenza who is at risk for influenza complications without previous laboratory confirmation.",

Hence, the therapy often fails to sufficiently resolve symptoms. This is also reflected by the fact that neuraminidase inhibitors (NI) are highly efficacious in animal models investigating influenza mono-infections [16, 17] but show lower efficacy against influenza symptoms in clinical trials in adults with natural infections [18] . Therefore, there is a high medical need for a broadly acting antiviral therapy in combination with a specific anti-influenza therapy for treatment of patients suffering from upper respiratory tract symptoms. Ideally, the substances present in the combination complement each other by different modes of action, leading to a treatment that provides full protection against a broad range of different respiratory viruses as well as different influenza strains with a low probability to induce escape mutations.",

            "text": "One approach for a broad antiviral therapy is the creation of a protective physical barrier in the nasal cavity using carrageenan. Carrageenan is a high molecular weight sulfated polymer derived from red seaweed (Rhodophyceae) that has been extensively used in food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industry and is generally recognized as safe by the FDA (GRAS) (reviewed in [19] ). Three main forms of carrageenans are commercially used: kappa, iota and lambda. They differ from each other in the degree of sulfation, solubility and gelling properties [20] . The antiviral mechanism of carrageenan is based on the interference with viral attachment; as a consequence, viral entry is inhibited [21, 22] . Its antiviral activity is dependent on the type of polymer as well as the virus and the host cells [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] and has been reviewed in [33] [34] [35] . We published that iota-carrageenan is a potent inhibitor of hRV [36] and influenza A [37] replication and demonstrated the antiviral efficacy of iota-carrageenan against common cold viruses by intranasal application in several randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled clinical trials [38] [39] [40] . The pooled analysis of two studies conducted in 153 children and 203 adults revealed that patients infected with any respiratory virus, who were intranasally treated with iota-carrageenan showed a 1.9 day faster recovery from common cold symptoms than placebo treated patients in the intention-to-treat population [41, 42] . The anti-influenza activity was shown by subgroup analysis of 49 influenza infected patients who benefited from a 3.3 days faster recovery from symptoms. The use of carrageenan nasal spray was associated with a significant reduction of the influenza viral load in nasal fluids and a significant increase in the number of virus free patients within the treatment period of 7 days. In good accordance Prieschl-Grassauer are co-founders of Marinomed Biotechnologie GmbH. Marinomed Biotechnologie GmbH had a role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, preparation of the manuscript and is financing the processing charge of the manuscript. with the literature [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] we observed that the majority of influenza virus infected patients suffered from a concomitant respiratory viral infection (66%) as determined by real-time PCR. Carrageenan containing nasal sprays are already marketed for the treatment of respiratory viral infections under different brand names in 18 countries.",

The potential of an intranasal administration of Zanamivir was investigated by GlaxoSmithKline. In seven clinical challenge trials 66 volunteers were infected with influenza B/Yamagata/16/88 and 213 with influenza A/Texas/36/91 (H1N1). 156 of these participants got intranasally applied Zanamivir at different doses (daily dose levels from 6.4 mg to 96 mg) for prophylaxis or therapy [46, 47, 53, 54] . These challenge trials showed that treatment starting before and up to 36 hours post virus inoculation was associated with prevention of laboratory confirmed influenza and febrile illness as well as a reduction in viral titers, duration of shedding and symptoms. In total, safety data from 1092 patients after intranasal application of Zanamivir were published and no evidence for Zanamivir induced adverse events or increased frequencies of local nasal intolerance in comparison to placebo groups was found [46, 49, 52] .",

Serial dilutions of carrageenan and Zanamivir were prepared in assay medium (influenza medium without trypsin).

For evaluation of the combination effect of carrageenan and Zanamivir, viruses were diluted in assay medium containing constant concentrations of either carrageenan or Zanamivir. The other substance was serially diluted and used for virus incubation. Cells were infected in 6 replicates/compound dilution, respectively, and incubated at RT for 45 min before inoculum removal. Cells were further incubated with the respective concentration of the investigated substances present in the overlay [influenza medium with 2.25% Carboxymethylcellulose (CMC, Fluka, Austria)] for 30-42 hours at 37\u00b0C.

Analysis was done with a HRP labeled detection antibody (Thermo Scientific, Germany) using TMB (Biolegend, Germany) as substrate and a microplate reader at 450 nm.

Both substances were nontoxic at the highest tested concentration (400 \u03bcM Zanamivir and 533 \u03bcg/ml carrageenan), neither was their combination. Furthermore, CMC in the overlay did not show any virus inhibitory effect (data not shown). Inhibition of viral replication of all tested influenza strains was achieved with both substances. However, the IC 50 values varied widely depending on the influenza virus strain. The IC 50 values of Zanamivir ranged between 0.18 \u03bcM for H5N1 and 22.97 \u03bcM for H7N7 and that of carrageenan from 0.39 \u03bcg/ml to 118.48 \u03bcg/ml for H1N1(09)pdm and H7N7, respectively (see Table 1 ).

Next, we compared the antiviral activity of carrageenan (12 mg/kg BW/ day) and Zanamivir (1 and 3 mg/kg BW/day) mono-therapies with the respective combination versus placebo treatment. Survival rates of mice with treatment starting 24 hpi are shown in Fig 2A.

Statistical analysis showed that the Zanamivir mono-therapy 1 mg/kg BW/day did not show a significant benefit (p = 0.1810), whereas the mono-therapy with 3 mg/kg BW/day significantly increased the survival rate compared with placebo treated mice (p = 0.0016).

No statistically significant difference was observed between the combination containing 3 mg/kg BW/day Zanamivir and that containing 1 mg/kg BW/day (p = 0.0525). However, a trend for an increased survival rate with the higher Zanamivir concentration was evident.

This indicates that the physical interaction of the polymer with the virus does not disturb the inhibition of the neuraminidase by Zanamivir.

            "text": "The synergistic effect was also shown in lethal mice models (Fig 2 and Fig 3) . The pathogenicity of influenza viruses in mice varies and is dependent on the strain and its adaptation to the host. Depending on virus dose and strain, influenza viruses can induce lethal infections in certain mouse strains usually within two weeks [37, 63] . In our model, C57Bl/6 mice are challenged intranasally with a lethal dose of the respective virus and treated with different regimens in comparison to a vehicle control (placebo). In such a model, early virus replication takes place in the upper respiratory tract. From there, virus spreads to the lung and causes lethal pneumonia. The effect of the treatment on mortality is assessed in comparison to placebotreated control mice. Of all in-vitro tested influenza strains the H1N1(09)pdm and the LP H7N7 are particularly interesting for two reasons. First, they are highly relevant pathogens, as placebo or with the mono-therapies consisting of carrageenan (12 mg/kg BW/day) or Zanamivir (1 and 3 mg/ kg BW/day) or a combination thereof. Treatment started 24 hpi and continued for 5 days. (B) Mice (n = 20 per group) were lethally intranasally infected without anesthesia on day 0 and intranasally treated twice per day either with placebo or a combination of carrageenan with Zanamivir (3 mg/kg BW/day). Treatment started either 48 hpi or 72 hpi and continued for 5 days. On the y-axis the survival of mice [%] and on the x-axis the time post infection [days] is given. Placebo treated uninfected control mice showed 100% survival in both experiments (data not shown). Statistical analyses were conducted using log rank test and are shown beneath the graphs. Values of p<0.05 were considered statistically significant; non-significance (n.s.) was obtained with p-values >0.05. both are involved in recent influenza outbreaks. The H1N1(09)pdm is associated with more than 18,400 deaths in the season 2009/2010 while the LP H7N7 carries an HA closely related to that of the avian influenza H7N9 virus which has caused more than 175 deaths until October 2014 [64] . Second, they are of special interest for the carrageenan/Zanamivir combination approach. They have shown to differ in in-vitro susceptibility to carrageenan, Zanamivir (Table 1 ) and the combination thereof (Fig 1) . While H1N1(09)pdm was highly sensitive to inhibition by both substances alone, H7N7 required much higher concentrations of carrageenan and Zanamivir, respectively, to achieve similar inhibition efficiencies. Therefore, both virus strains were chosen to further explore the efficiency of the combination therapy in a mouse model.",

In particular the problem of antiviral resistance could be addressed with this strategy. In the last decade concerns have been raised about the increased emergence of Oseltamivir resistant influenza viruses. The augmented appearance of viruses carrying the mutation H275Y in the neuraminidase of H1N1(09)pdm viruses that confers resistance to Oseltamivir left Zanamivir as only treatment option for symptomatic patients infected with an Oseltamivir resistant influenza strain [70] . In contrast to Oseltamivir, resistance to Zanamivir is less frequent. To date, Zanamivir resistant influenza has been detected only once, in an immunocompromised patient [71, 72] . However, lessons should be learned from previous anti-influenza interventions which resulted in occurrence of resistance against currently approved drugs [73] . Therefore, concerns are comprehensible that an increased Zanamivir use may also lead to the rapid emergence of resistances [74] . To overcome this threat, a combination of antivirals which inhibits virus replication by distinct mechanisms is a valid strategy. We checked for the possibility of generating double compound escape mutant viruses while passaging viruses in the presence of increasing concentrations of compound combinations. After 10 passages in MDCK cells no resistance to the compound combination for any tested influenza virus could be found (data not shown). However, this finding does not guarantee that emergence of Zanamivir escape mutants can be completely halted.",

Even if, due to new reverse genetic techniques, less time for production of vaccines is needed, it still takes months before large quantities of vaccine are available [75] . During this time the human population should be protected to decelerate viral spread. At the moment the only available opportunities for personal protection are hygiene measures and the use of Tamiflu (brand name of Oseltamivir).",

Treatment started 24 hpi and continued for 5 days. On the y-axis the survival of mice [%] and on the x-axis the time post infection [days] is given. Placebo treated, uninfected control mice showed 100% survival (data not shown). Statistical analyses were conducted using log rank test and are shown beneath the graphs.
