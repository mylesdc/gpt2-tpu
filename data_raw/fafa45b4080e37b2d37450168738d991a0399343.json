Since IFN response represents an early host defense event against viral infection and the fact that treatment with meliacine, a plant antiviral, ameliorate the severity of the herpetic infection in female mice infected intravaginally with HSV-2, we wanted to investigate whether the administration of meliacine to HSV-2 infected mice could altered the homoestasis of IFNs host response. For this purpose we studied the effect of the compound 1-cinnamoyl-3,11-dihydroxymeliacarpin (CDM), which is the responsible for meliacine antiviral action, on the HSV-2 inhibition exerted by IFN \u03b1, IFN-\u03b3 or their combination.",

While treatment with IFN-\u03b1 or IFN-\u03b3 alone has weak antiviral action, HSV-2 plaque formation, viral replication and the onset of viral CPE in Vero cells are synergistically inhibited by interferon combination. In addition, CDM treatment contributes to protect cells from virus cytopathic effect and causes a strong inhibition of HSV-2 titer. Moreover, the presence of CDM for 2 h before IFN induction, during the 16 h induction period, only for 24 h after infection or during the complete IFN treatment period, reduces virus yields in an additive way without affecting IFN antiviral action.",

We have shown that meliacine strongly inhibited the replication of HSV-1 and HSV-2 in Vero cells [5] and exhibits a synergistic antiviral activity when combined with acyclovir [6] . Studies performed by Alch\u00e9 et al suggested that MA exerts the antiviral action on both synthesis of viral DNA and maturation and progress of HSV-1 on Vero cells [7] . In vivo studies have shown that meliacine prevents the development of HSV-1 stromal keratitis in mice [8, 9] . Likewise, the severity of the herpetic infection in female mice infected intravaginally with HSV-2 was also ameliorated by MA treatment [10] . On the other hand, besides its broad effect of antiviral action, meliacine acts as an immunomodulator in vitro agent inhibiting the phagocytosis of opsonized sheep erythrocytes and impairing the proliferation of spleen and lymph node T cells [11, 12] . Moreover, meliacine is a weak inducer of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) in murine macrophage cultures and causes a synergistic effect on the production of TNF-\u03b1 induced by LPS [13] . Vaginal washes of female mice infected i.v. with HSV-2 and treated with meliacine contained an increased amount of TNF-\u03b1 in comparison with infected nontreated animals [10] .",

In this context, macrophages play a central role in resistance of mice to primary infection with HSV-2, mainly, as a source of antiviral cytokines, TNF-\u03b1, IFN \u03b1/\u03b2 and IL-12, which are produced rapidly after infection [14] . IFN-\u03b3, a strong activator of macrophages [15] [16] [17] is produced both in the early stages of infection by natural killer cells and at later stages by activated T cells [18] . The innate immune response to viral infection depends on the integrity of this network of cytokines, which is tightly regulated [19] . This in vivo situation led us to query whether the administration of meliacine to HSV-2 infected mice could altered the homoestasis of IFNs host response either affecting the antiviral activity of IFN \u03b1/\u03b2 or IFN-\u03b3, or their synergizing interaction [20, 21] . To answer that question we conducted experiments following an indirect approach based on the observation that IFN-\u03b3 synergizes with IFN \u03b1/\u03b2 to inhibit HSV-1 replication in Vero cells [20] . To that end, Vero cells infected with HSV-2 were treated with IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3 or a combination of both in the presence or absence of meliacine under different experimental conditions.",

Vero cells were pretreated for 16 h with 100 IU/ml of IFNs separately or in combination. Then, cells were infected with HSV-2 (MS or G strain) at the MOI of 1 PFU per cell and culture supernatants were harvested at 24, 48 and 72 h p.i. and titered for infectious virus. For control purpose HSV-1 strains KOS and F similarly treated were included. In accordance with the results presented in Table 1 , we observed a greater inhibitory effect on HSV-2 replication when Vero cultures were treated with IFNs combination than IFN-\u03b1 or IFN-\u03b3 alone, despite that each interferon showed a greater antiviral activity than in plaque reduction assay ( Figure 1 ). In cultures treated with 100 IU/ml of IFN-\u03b1 or IFN-\u03b3, MS and G replication was 8-fold and 100-fold reduced respectively (p < 0.001) at 24 h p.i. (Figure 1a and 1b). At 48 and 72 h p.i. viral titers in IFN-\u03b1 or IFN-\u03b3-treated cultures approached levels of those detected in vehicle-treated groups. However, relative to vehicle control cultures, viral titers recovered at 48 and 72 h from cultures treated with IFN-\u03b1 or IFN-\u03b3 were reduced by 2-fold in MS-infected cultures and 2-and 3-fold in G infected cultures respectively (Figure 1e and 1f) . In HSV-2 infected cultures treated with combination of IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 the inhibitory effect was different between strains. Titers of HSV-2 MS were reduced 100-fold approximately relative to vehicle treated Vero cells at all time point tested. In the case of HSV-2 G, IFN combination virus titers were reduced 10.000-fold in comparison to control cultures at 24 h p.i. At 48 and 72 h p.i. the antiviral activity decreased, however virus replication was still 2000-fold inhibited. These results indicate that the combination of IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 synergizes the antiviral effect against HSV-2 in a similar mode to previ-ously reported for HSV-1 (Figure 1c , 1d, 1g and 1h) [23, 25] .",

The number of surviving cells was determined at 12, 24, 36 and 48 h p.i. (Figure  2c) . A comparison of Figure 2b and 2c shows that in the presence of CDM alone Vero cells were highly protected from HSV-2 cytopathicity, since 60% of infected cells remained viable. When CDM was combined with IFN-\u03b1 or IFN-\u03b3, the number of protected cells increased with respect to the effect of each interferon alone suggesting that the protection observed is due to CDM effect. Interestingly, when cells were treated with CDM plus IFN combination there seems to be an additive antiviral effect, a phenomenon that was confirmed by next experiments.",

            "text": "We also tested if the presence of CDM under different experimental conditions could affect the antiviral action of IFNs on HSV-2 MS replication. Virus yields at 24 h p.i. were determined in Vero cells treated with CDM as follows: i) for 2 h prior to interferon induction and then removed, ii) added simultaneously with IFN and remained only for 16 h before infection, iii) added after virus infection and remained to virus harvest, iiii) added with IFN 16 h before infection, re-added after infection and remained to virus harvest. The results obtained following protocol i) are depicted in Figure 3a . The antiviral effect due to interferon alone or in combination is 2-fold increased in cells pretreated with CDM, as an indication that CDM treatment did not interfere with the antiviral activity displayed by IFN alone or in combination. On the contrary, we can speculate that the antiviral effect of CDM alone contributed in an additive manner to the overall antiviral activity. When CDM was present during the 16 h IFN antiviral induction period, the interpretation of the results are rather complicated because of the antiviral effect of CDM per se which reduced HSV-2 replication by 20-fold (Figure 3b ). Likewise, in the experiments described in Figure 3a , there is an additive effect of CDM when cells were treated with both IFN-\u03b1 or IFN-\u03b3 or their combination (Figure 3b ). When CDM was added after virus infection and remained until 24 h p.i. or it was also present during the induction period, the antiviral effect of the compound was so high (100-fold and 20.000-fold reduction virus yield respectively) that masked its interaction with IFNs (Figure 3c and 3d) . For that reason, we repeated the experiment shown in Figure 3c with lower concentrations of CDM. Virus yields at 24 h p.i. in cultures treated with 6.12, 12.25, 25 and 50 \u03bcg/ml of CDM, or CDM plus 100 IU/ml of IFN-\u03b1 or CDM plus 100 IU/ml of IFN-\u03b3 were determined. As can be seen in Figure 4 , CDM alone inhibited virus replication in a dose dependent manner. The combination of each IFN with CDM increased in 1 log the antiviral effect but without altering the kinetics of the inhibition observed.",

Expression of ICP0 also plays a role in resistance of HSV-1 to IFN-\u03b3 [32] . Thus explaining why IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 or IFN-\u03b3 alone are weak inhibitors of HSV-1 wild type virus replication.

Whereas, individual cytokines were weak inducers of the antiviral response, independently of the concentration tried was 100 or 200 IU (Table 1) . Importantly, there is no evidence that the two cytokines, individually or collectively, were harmful to uninfected or HSV-2 infected cells at the concentration used (Figure 2a and 2b) . To the contrary, the cells remained viable after cytokine exposure for 48 h after the induction period as assessed by MTT exclusion colorimetric method and remained able to prolifer-ate ( Figure 2a) indicating that virus inhibition was the consequence of a blockade in virus replication and no to host cells death. The validity of these findings was provided by the inclusion of HSV-1 KOS and HSV-1 F strains in the experiments as controls. Results depicted in Table 1 , Figures 1c and 1g (KOS) , 1d and 1 h (F) showed a synergistic effect of IFN combination on HSV-1 virus replication confirming previous studies [36, 20] . The antiviral effect of CDM in infected cells is due to alterations in cellular processes. Working with VSV as a model system it was demonstrated that CDM exerted its antiviral action on the endocytic and exocytic pathway of VSV by pre-or post-treatment [37] . This effect is a consequence that CDM induced cytoplasmic alkalinization of intracellular endosomes. The refractory state to virus infection reached a maximum after 2 h of pre-treatment and is fully maintained up to 12 h later, however even at 24 h the cells still remain partially resistant to virus infection. Since acidification of vacuolar compartments plays an important role in a variety of cellular processes we wondered where the presence of CDM could inhibit the antiviral state induced by interferon treatment.",

IFN was then removed during virus adsorption and after that re-added up to virus harvest. The presence of CDM for 2 h before induction, during the 16 h induction period, only for 24 h after infection or during the complete IFN treat-ment period did not affect IFN action. On the contrary, in the presence of CDM, an enhanced effect of the antiviral action of each interferon alone or in combination (see Figure 3) was observed indicating that alteration of cellular processes occurring in cells after exposure to CDM [37] did not interfere with the establishment of a refractory stage to HSV-2 infection in cells treated with IFN. It is remarkable that the sensitivity of HSV-2 to CDM increased steadily in accordance with time of cell treatment. Thus, after 2 h pretreatment with CDM virus titer was 2 fold reduced ( Figure 3a ) but if pretreatment was extended to 16 h, virus reduction increased 10 times (Figure 3b ). In accordance with previous results obtained with meliacine [5] , addition of CDM to cells after HSV-2 infection caused a strong inhibition of virus titer in the order of 100 fold (Figure 3c ). Unexpectedly, when CDM was present for 16 h before infection and for 24 h afterwards, virus yield was reduced 20.000 times (Figure 3d ). This high antiviral activity of CDM per se complicated the interpretation of the results obtained in the presence of IFN (Figure 3d ), which in comparison reduced the amount of virus even in combination less than 2 logs. To overcome this inconvenience, we performed an experiment with lower concentrations of CDM added after virus infection and lasted to virus harvest, in combination with 100 IU/ ml of IFN-\u03b1 or IFN-\u03b3. A clear additive effect of CDM with IFN-\u03b1 or CDM plus IFN-\u03b3 at all concentrations tested was observed ( Figure 4) .",

Vero cells were inoculated with HSV-2 MS and HSV-1 KOS 16 h later, and after virus adsorption the medium was replaced with fresh culture medium containing the same IFN concentrations used in the pretreatment. At 0, 12, 24, 36 and 48 h p.i. cell morphology was observed by light microscope and cell viability was determined as described previously [38] using the cleavage of tetrazolium salt MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide] (Sigma) by the mitochondrial enzyme succinate dehydrogenase to give a blue product (formazan). The absorbance of each well was measured on an Eurogenetics MPR-A 4i microplate reader, using a test wavelength of 570 nm and a reference wavelength of 630 nm. The number of surviving cells was determined by interpolation in a standard calibration curve correlating optical density values and number of viable cells determined by counting with a haemocytometer.",
