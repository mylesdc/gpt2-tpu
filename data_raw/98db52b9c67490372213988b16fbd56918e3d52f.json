The nasopharyngeal region could be a potent carrier of long-term bioaerosol exposure agents. This study aimed to evaluate the correlation between nasopharyngeal bacterial flora of swine workers and the swine barns bioaerosol biodiversity. Methods: Air samples from eight swine barns as well as nasopharyngeal swabs from pig workers (n = 25) and from a non-exposed control group (n = 29) were sequenced using 16S rRNA gene high-throughput sequencing. Wastewater treatment plants were used as the industrial, low-dust, non-agricultural environment control to validate the microbial link between the bioaerosol content (air) and the nasopharynxes of workers. Results: A multivariate analysis showed air samples and nasopharyngeal flora of pig workers cluster together, compared to the non-exposed control group. The significance was confirmed with the PERMANOVA statistical test (p-value of 0.0001). Unlike the farm environment, nasopharynx samples from wastewater workers did not cluster with air samples from wastewater treatment plants. The difference in the microbial community of nasopharynx of swine workers and a control group suggest that swine workers are carriers of germs found in bioaerosols. Conclusion: Nasopharynx sampling and microbiota could be used as a proxy of air sampling for exposure assessment studies or for the determination of exposure markers in highly contaminated agricultural environments.",

Bioaerosols are ubiquitous in indoor and outdoor environments and are generated from various natural and/or anthropogenic sources. Composed of particles ranging in size from a few nanometers to 200 \u00b5m in diameter, bioaerosols remain suspended in the air for long periods of time and may travel many kilometers depending on the size of the particle [1, [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . Therefore, the dispersal of bioaerosols may impact the air quality of extensive areas that are far from the source and can create public health issues, due to the presence of highly diverse and dynamic microbial communities. Beyond affecting the time that particles remain suspended and the distances they travel, particle size plays a role in human diseases, as it dictates which pathway the particle follows in the respiratory tract after inhalation [9] .",

For example, biowaste facilities are characterized by notable concentrations of bioaerosols, due to the intense microbial activity involved in waste degradation and the activities performed by workers [24] [25] [26] [27] . Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) represent another environment where workers are subject to bioaerosol exposure, due to the steps required for the treatment of discharged municipal and industrial effluents [28, 29] . Intensive animal farming practices in confined buildings that hold a large number of animals (e.g., pigs, poultry, cattle) are also associated with extreme exposure to airborne microbes. The variety of possible sources (e.g., animals, feces, feed, litter) present at farms leads to the emission of complex mixtures of biological particles [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] . Moreover, the dynamic nature of the microbial composition makes health risk evaluation complicated for farm workers and nearby residents [36, 37] . Environmental hygienists continue to insist that insufficient exposure assessments are a primary reason for the absence of bioaerosol exposure limits and strategies to mitigate risk [35, 38] .",

The type of sampler, time and duration of sampling, meteorological conditions [39] , and geographical positions all affect bioaerosol sampling efficiency, making it difficult to compare studies and limiting collaboration efforts in bioaerosol exposure studies. An added challenge in terms of measuring microbial diversity is that culture-dependent analytical approaches recuperate the cultural/viable portion of bioaerosols exclusively. In contrast, high-throughput sequencing (HTS) methods are associated with a more in-depth characterization of the microbial content of a sample [26, 27, [40] [41] [42] [43] . To overcome the aforementioned challenges, the scientific community that studies aerosols has identified the need to explore new alternatives and complementary approaches for assessing bioaerosol exposure, such as identifying markers that can help classify environments based on human health risks [44] [45] [46] .",

Previous studies have already used nasopharynx or nasal cavity samples to look for specific microorganisms, using culture-based approaches [11, 47] , or revealed the presence of bacterial resistance genes, using molecular biology approaches [33] . Recently, an HTS approach was used on samples from the anterior and posterior cavity of the nose to study the bacterial diversity of individuals [48] . However, because the microflora in the nasal cavity is dynamic and fluctuant [49] , a region like the nasopharynx may represent a more long-term reservoir of inhaled bioaerosols. To the best of our knowledge, no study has ever used a 16S rRNA amplicon-based HTS approach to investigate the microbial diversity of nasopharyngeal flora, in order to assess occupational exposure. Microbiome studies that use upper respiratory tract tissue and focus on specific pathologies (such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and chronic rhinosinusitis) may underestimate the effect of occupational exposure on the microbiomes of the subjects examined in those studies. We hypothesis that the microbiome of patients with respiratory disease is most likely affected by exposure to their work environment in addition to disease, rather than to disease alone.",

The 16S rRNA amplicon-based HTS approach was used to determine bacterial diversity, while qPCR was used to evaluate the presence of human pathogenic agents and bacterial resistance genes in bioaerosols and in nasopharyngeal samples from pig workers. Additionally, WWTPs were used as the industrial, low-dust, non-agricultural environment control to validate the microbial link between the bioaerosol content (air) and the nasopharynxes of workers. Although the experiment focused on pig farmers and the buildings that they work in, the results may have implications for a wider population of agricultural workers. Consequently, nasopharynx samples could be used as proxies for air samples in exposure assessment studies and for the determination of exposure markers in agricultural settings. In addition, the study advocates for the need of systematic bioaerosol exposure study when evaluating the nasopharyngeal microbiota.",

Quality filtering was also performed with mothur, using the screen.seqs script to discard homopolymers, reads with ambiguous sequences, and reads with suspiciously short lengths. Similar sequences were gathered together in order to reduce the computational burden, and the number of copies of the same sequence was displayed to monitor the abundance of each sequence. This de-replication step was performed with VSEARCH [52] . The sequences were then aligned with the bacterial reference SILVA core alignment using the QIIME script align_seqs.py [53] . Operational taxonomic units (OTUs), with a 97% similarity cut-off, were clustered using the UPARSE method implemented in VSEARCH. UCHIME was used to identify and remove the chimeric sequences [54] . QIIME was used to assign taxonomy to OTUs based on the SILVA database reference training dataset for taxonomic assignment and to generate an OTU table. A metadata-mapping file was produced that includes information about air and nasopharyngeal samples. The microbial diversity analyses, including statistical analyses, conducted in this study, were achieved using QIIME plugins in version 1.9.0 as described in QIIME scripts (http://qiime.org/scripts/).

Non-parametric Mann-Whitney U tests (two-tailed) were performed to highlight that there are significant differences in diversity measures between the groups of samples. A p-value \u22640.05 was considered statistically significant. All of the results were analyzed using the software GraphPad Prism 5.03 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). To determine the statistical significance of the variation in the observed microbial community composition with multivariate analyses (PCoA), a PERMANOVA test was performed on the Unweighted UniFrac matrix. The compare_categories.py QIIME script was used to generate the statistical results. Because PERMANOVA is a non-parametric test, significance is determined through permutations. In this case, 999 permutations were used. A p-value \u22640.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Detailed information about the performance of the test is presented in the multivariate section of the results. The non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test was used to ascertain whether or not differences in OTU abundances were statistically significant between the controls and pig farmers. To test OTU differential abundance, the null hypothesis was that the populations that the two groups of samples were collected from have equal means. The range of p-values obtained for the 30 most differentially abundant OTUs between the control samples and the pig farmer samples are presented in the differential abundance section of the results.",

A PCR amplification targeting the 16S rRNA genes allowed us to confirm the very low biomass of the negative controls compared to the nasopharyngeal swabs from the pig workers and non-exposed controls. For this reason, negative controls did not pass the next step of Illumina HTS. Additional negative controls consisted of outdoor air samples that were taken outside the pig buildings sampled in this study. These samples showed enough concentration of bacterial biomass with the PCR amplification. Thus, outdoor negative controls were sequenced. However, the number of reads and subsequent OTU clustering was low compared to the indoor air samples. During the rarefaction step, the negative controls were not included in the analyses due to a low number of sequences. The goal is to have a number of sequences per sample deep enough to cover most of the bacterial diversity. Positive controls consisted of a mock community containing equal concentrations of 20 bacteria purchased from ATCC (20 Strain Even Mix Genomic Material ATCC \u00ae MSA-1002 TM ).

The higher the sequencing depth, the more likely that the full diversity coverage is attained. The sequencing depth was 15,000 sequences for all the groups of samples: The air samples from pig buildings, the nasopharyngeal samples of pig farmers and non-exposed controls. The points shown in Figure 1 were calculated as follows: Ten values from 10 to 15,000 analyzed sequences were randomly selected. For each of these values, the corresponding number of OTUs observed, was noted for all of the samples. Then, the average number of OTUs observed, plus or minus one standard deviation, were calculated for each of the ten values. The samples were divided into three groups: Air from pig buildings, Pig farmers and Non-exposed controls.

However, the profile from farmers was more evenly distributed. Clostridia had the highest relative abundance (24%) followed by Saprospirae (19%), Bacilli (18%) and Actinobacteria (11%).

The evaluation of species diversity was introduced by Whittaker and defined as the number of species and their proportional abundance within one sampling site [58] . There are different ways to measure alpha diversity and an extensive list of indexes has been presented by Magurran and McGill [59] . In addition to the usual Chao1 richness estimates and Shannon/Simpson diversity measures [60] [61] [62] [63] , PD Whole Tree was also used to analyze the alpha diversity in samples in this study. PD stands for phylogenetic diversity and is defined as the minimum length of all phylogenetic branches required to span a given set of taxa on the phylogenetic tree [64] . All four of the alpha diversity measures revealed greater bacterial richness and diversity in the nasopharyngeal samples from pig farmers compared to non-exposed individuals. The observed similarity between bioaerosols from pig buildings and the nasopharyngeal flora from farmers is indicative of occupational exposure and, consequently, a transient presence and/or possible colonization of the upper respiratory tract regions by environmental bacteria. These findings are even more interesting given that the majority of pig farmers recruited for this study do not work in the eight pig buildings selected for air analysis. This suggests that airborne bacteria associated with pig buildings can take over the microbiota in farmers' nasopharynxes. The establishment of this \"new\" microbial community could represent a microbial signature for the nasopharynx of pig farmers. Also, a higher prevalence of viruses in the nasopharynxes of farmers compared to the non-exposed control group could play a role in the increased alpha-diversity [65] .",

            "text": "Common approaches to evaluating changes in the community composition (beta diversity) rely on the creation of a (dis)similarity matrix to calculate the distance between samples. Dis(similarity) matrices may be calculated using different methods depending on the type of dataset, analyses, and the objectives of the study, as some metrics are more suitable than others [66] [67] [68] [69] . The UniFrac distance metric was used as efficacy was proven with 16S rRNA bacterial genes [70] . In addition, PCoA coupled with PERMANOVA offers a robust statistical significance of sample grouping using distance matrices. This non-parametric multivariate analysis of variance separates the distance matrix into sources of variation to describe the robustness and significance of a variable in explaining the variations observed between samples. It is based on the ANOVA experimental design but analyzes the variance and determines the significance by permutations, as it is a non-parametric test [71] . Whereas, ANOVA/MANOVA assumes normal distributions and a Euclidean distance, PERMANOVA can be used with any distance measure. The two analyses led to the same conclusions for this study. Therefore their usefulness when used together as a tool to visualize and evaluate sample clustering was confirmed. The distinct clusters formed between the combination of pig farmers, and the air from pig buildings, and non-exposed individuals, is clearly linked to a strong divergence in the nasopharyngeal microbiota of farmers compared to other non-exposed individuals. Mechanical deposition of <100 \u00b5m diameter inhaled particles on nasopharyngeal surfaces by inertial impaction [72] , represents a continuous source of environmental bacteria to the nasopharynx. This continuous source of bacterial exposure may therefore be responsible for the establishment of a reservoir of bacteria reflecting long-term exposure (e.g., occupational exposure). A thorough understanding of the established bacterial community may then lead to a better evaluation of the risks associated with an environment. For example, domestic animals share some of their microbiota with their human cohabitants, supposedly through frequent and direct contact [73, 74] . Song et al., (2013) mention that airborne microbiota plays an important role in microbial transfer to the human upper respiratory tract. Ten thousand litres of air are inhaled daily and the bioaerosols in the air may have an effect on the human nasal microbial community [75] . Finally, as different farm animals are associated with different microbiota, the normal nasopharyngeal flora of farmers may be differently disturbed. In other words, farmers working with different animals may have a different disturbances of their natural nasopharyngeal flora. Therefore, the microbial fingerprint of the nasopharynx may be directly linked to a specific type of farming environment and the potential long-term health effects on farmers.",

Interestingly, the results of this study are consistent with the literature, but with the added information indicating that, these same phyla colonize the nasopharynxes of farmers. More particularly, other studies have previously shown Clostridia to be the most abundant class of bacteria in bioaerosols from pig buildings [30] . This study not only confirmed the abundance of Clostridia in air samples, but also that this class was the dominant class found in nasopharynx samples, while it was practically absent in non-exposed individuals. Clostridium spp., identified as differentially abundant in the farmer nasopharyngeal samples in the present study, comprise potentially pathogenic species [79] . Specifically, Clostridium butyricum, also differentially abundant in samples from farmers, has been identified as an emerging pathogen by public health authorities. Some C. butyricum pathogenic strains were associated with the occurrence of necrotizing enterocolitis, a bowel disease [80] . In addition, Prevotella spp., which was strikingly more abundant in nasopharynx samples, is a well-known agent involved in upper respiratory tract infections [81] [82] [83] . Moraxella is another genus identified by the differential abundance analyses as being predominant in the nasopharynxes of farmers. Like for other taxa identified in this study, strains of Moraxella spp. were previously detected as airborne bacteria in pig buildings [84] . The rate of colonization of Moraxella spp. in healthy adult populations is around 3% [85] . Species of this genus are opportunistic pathogens responsible for upper and lower respiratory tract infections [86] . Taxa identified exclusively in nasopharyngeal samples and air samples from pig buildings could be candidates for new markers to assess exposure to bioaerosols in pig farming environments.",

Workers wear personal protective devices (e.g., masks) at certain working sites (e.g., biofiltration), which may affect the establishment of a 'new' environmental microflora. Supporting this idea, the most abundant bacteria, shared by non-exposed controls and wastewater workers, are naturally occurring skin bacteria like Propionibacterium, Corynebacterium, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Cutibacterium. These taxa were not present (relative abundance less than 1%) in air samples from WWTPs (data not shown). Farmers do not usually wear respiratory protection and, moreover, they often live in the farming environment (e.g., in a house located near farms) and are consequently continuously exposed to the microbes generated from farming activities (occupational and residential exposures). Therefore, the exposure that farmers are subjected to is more likely to modify their natural nasopharyngeal flora. The agricultural/non-agricultural hypothesis presented in this work regarding the nasopharyngeal flora of exposed workers should be validated in other agricultural and industrial environments.",

For bacterial diversity analyses, the qPCR approach supports the use of the nasopharynx as an alternative to air sampling. The presence of zinc and antibiotic resistance genes, in the nasopharynxes of farmers, is explained by the use of zinc and antibiotics in animal farming (for therapeutic or sub-therapeutic use, such as for growth promotion) and implies possible human health risks. Extensive use of zinc in pig feed is responsible for the proliferation of zinc-resistant bacterial communities at farms [95] . Cephalosporin is a commonly used antimicrobial drug in human infections and the spread of its resistance constitutes part of the antibiotic resistance crisis [96] . Finally, the mcr-1 gene was found in the nasopharynxes of half of the pig farmers in this study, although the use of colistin is extremely regulated in North America and limited to multi-drug resistant microbes [97] .",

The results suggest that workers are carriers of bioaerosol-associated bacteria and that nasopharynx sampling could be used as a proxy for air sampling in exposure assessment studies. Furthermore, pig farmers are also carriers of specific human pathogens and resistance genes that are worthy of health concerns. However, the present study did not confirm the use of nasopharynx sampling as an alternative for air sampling in non-agricultural environments (wastewater treatment). Thus, we conclude that the nasopharynx could be a reservoir for environmental bacteria that reflects the long-term exposure to bioaerosols in agricultural settings.",
