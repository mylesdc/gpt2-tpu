In contrast, population-based, participatory surveillance systems typically lack this kind of information. Thus, there is little up-to-date information what kind of pathogens cause respiratory infections that may or may not lead to physician consultations. However, longitudinal information on the type of pathogens would be helpful to interpret syndromic data, focus on specific risk groups, calculate (pathogenspecific) burden of disease estimates, support therapeutic decisions (eg, regarding the use or non-use of antibiotic therapy) and, finally, guide decisions on the development of vaccines that could reduce disease of responsible pathogens. To keep complexity and cost low, the very nature of these participatory surveillance instruments calls for a simple mechanism of respiratory sample collection by participants themselves. Self-collection may be more acceptable when nasal or particularly anterior nasal swabs can be used. While in clinical practice pharyngeal or nasopharyngeal swabs are taken frequently for upper respiratory illness, it has been shown that for influenza and other respiratory viruses, nasal swabs are at least equally sensitive if not superior to pharyngeal specimens. 7, 8 Furthermore, Akmatov demonstrated that self-collected and medical staff-collected nasal swabs were equivalent in acceptance and the capability to detect pathogens. 11 We therefore designed a feasibility study (\"GrippeWeb-Plus\") to test if self-collection of anterior nasal swabs is logistically possible, acceptable for participating adults and children, and if it yields valid microbiological results that are capable to complement syndromic surveillance data.",

Upon registration, participants answer questions on demographic variables, lifetime physician-diagnosed chronic conditions, smoking, household size, daily occupation and main mode of transportation used. Participants receive weekly emails summarizing the GrippeWeb results published on the system's website and reminding them to complete the weekly online questionnaire. In this questionnaire, participants are asked whether they have experienced the onset of a new respiratory illness during the previous week. If the participant has had a respiratory illness with new symptom onset, participants were additionally asked to report the date of onset, selected symptoms from a short list (cough, sore throat, fever and coryza), if they have consulted a physician because of the illness and whether they have been able to continue their usual daily occupation. Influenza vaccination is recorded weekly during the winter season. Participants can report weekly answers retrospectively up to a maximum of four weeks. Reported illnesses are recorded in the participant's personal password-protected online diary and can be accessed online at any time. In February 2016, about 4500-5000 participants from all over Germany delivered their weekly report, ensuring a broad geographical representation.",

Descriptive analysis included data on recruitment, the number of submitted swabs and time intervals between symptom onset, day of swabbing and arrival of the swab in the laboratory.To evaluate completeness of swabbing, we compared results from the group of randomly selected participants with that among participating staff members of the RKI. To do this, proportion of respiratory illnesses that were reported online where a swab was taken. Proportions were analysed using the chi-square test of homogeneity. We assessed acceptability in two ways: we analysed self-reported side effects at the time when each swab was taken (as documented in the symptom questionnaire) as well as self-reported judgement of acceptability in the final evaluation questionnaire.To test internal validity of the samples, we examined (a) the pro-portion of variables filled out in the data of the forms submitted by the participants; (b) the number of participants who dropped out; (c) completeness of swabbing (see above); (d) the proportion of evaluation forms returned; and (e) if samples contained the human cmyc-gene which can only be found in human cells. To test external validity, we compared virological results with that of the virological surveillance system of the physician sentinel AGI. 12 Because AGI physicians take swabs from patients with ILI, we compared positivity rates (PRs) of influenza and rhinoviruses also among GrippeWeb-Plus participants presenting with ILI. Of note, the ILI definition in the AGI includes fever + one systemic symptom such as headache or myalgia + one respiratory symptom and differs therefore from the ILI definition in GrippeWeb. Since the proportion of samples among children was very similar compared to that in the virological surveillance system in the AGI during the same weeks (42% among GrippeWeb-Plus samples; 40% among AGI samples) and for specific pathogens numbers became very small, no age-adjusted PR was calculated. For the period of influenza circulation (PIC), we used the definition provided by the AGI (week 2-week 15 [2016]).",

Nevertheless, if both curves are held side-by-side, PR among GrippeWeb participants with ILI appears to be systematically higher by proximately 20 percentage points (Figure 3, lower right panel).",

Lastly, in terms of (external) validity PR for influenza among GW participants with ILI was similar to that in the virological sentinel of the AGI.12 Although numbers were small, PR for rhino-/enterovirus among GrippeWeb-Plus participants with ILI appeared to be systematically higher than PR for rhinovirus among AGI ILI patients. This result suggests that analysing swabs for enterovirus in addition to rhinovirus may increase the yield of swabs with an identified pathogen in the AGI.During this study, a large variety of viruses was detected.More than 70% of swabs from symptomatic participants yielded at least one pathogen, more than in studies with a similar diagnostic spectrum (36% 11 ; 48% 16 ). The viruses most frequently identified were rhino-/enterovirus, coronaviruses, influenza viruses as well as bocavirus. Except for bocavirus which was not tested in other studies, this finding is in broad agreement with results published by Goff (USA, 2013/2014)14 and Plymouth (Sweden, 2001/2012).16",
