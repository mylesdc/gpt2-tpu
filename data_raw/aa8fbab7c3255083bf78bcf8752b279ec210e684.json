Over all age groups only 15% of the total average number of trips a year are commuting (19% of the total average distance). Even among the 18-69 yr group only 20% of journeys are commuting (23% of distance). Truscott and Ferguson 2012 [1] Informed by data from US and UK based census' on distances travelled for work.
