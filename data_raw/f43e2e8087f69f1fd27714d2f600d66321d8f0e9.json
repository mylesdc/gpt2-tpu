A three-country set was created for analysis by matching women on age, gestational age at enrollment, and number of previous pregnancies. Anovas with post-hoc pairwise comparisons were used to compare results across the cohorts. Multivariate regression analysis was used to create a model to identify those variables most strongly associated with optimism/pessimism.",

Quality of life scores also varied by country in these samples, with the most pronounced difference occurring in the vitality measure.

[9] [10] [11] On the other hand, pessimism has been shown to have prophylactic effects in certain circumstances. In particular, pessimism can insulate people from the psychological consequences of failure, including anxiety, depression, and diminished self-esteem.

In other words, those who were not tested prior to their pregnancy and had the least knowledge of HIV were the most optimistic. The authors also found that, when compared to a similarly aged sample of nonpregnant women in the United States (U.S.), the Ghanaian women were significantly more optimistic. [20] The construct of health-related quality of life is one variable that has been linked to optimism/pessimism in past research. [21] In one study, researchers found that, even when health status was controlled, pessimists had significantly worse health-related quality of life (HRQOL) scores than optimists or so-called \"realists.\" [21] In that study, pessimists were those who expected disproportionately negative outcomes associated with their Hepatitis C diagnosis, optimists were those who expected few negative outcomes associated with their Hepatitis C diagnosis, and realists were those who had a fairly accurate perception of the impact Hepatitis C was going to have on their lives. Optimists' HRQOL scores in this study mirrored the scores of the general U.S. population, even though the population being studied (chronic hepatitis C patients) has been shown to have significantly lower QOL than the general population.",

According to SF-36 developers, 12 of the original SF-36 items accounted for at least 90% of the variance in PCS-36 and MCS-36 in both general and patient populations, and those same 12 items reproduced the profile of the eight SF-36 health concepts sufficiently for studies in which the length of the instrument may be prohibitive.",

A data subset was created by matching women on three key variables: maternal age, number of weeks pregnant at the time of enrollment, and number of previous pregnancies. Women were matched within 3 years of age (average age difference across matched sets = 0.85 years); within 1 pregnancy (average difference in number of pregnancies across matched sets = 0.48); and within 5 weeks of gestational age (average difference in gestational age across matched sets = 2.66 weeks). This matching schema was undertaken to attempt to create a sample that was as similar as possible on key variables that could influence optimism/pessimism. Previous research has suggested that age can be related to optimism/pessimism [27] , as well as number of previous deliveries [20] . We also postulated that women at different stages of pregnancy might feel differently in terms of optimism/pessimism, and thus wanted to reduce the impact of stage of pregnancy on our results. Given the one child policy in China, \"number of previous pregnancies\" was used as a key variable rather than number of previous deliveries. This resulted in a matched sample of 168 women, 56 in each country, that were predominantly nulliparous. We refer to these threeway matches as \"matched sets\" throughout the manuscript.",

Note that two of the three variables upon which women were matched (age and number of previous pregnancies) were not significantly different (see Table 2 ). In fact, the average difference in age across the matched sets was 0.857 years, with a maximum difference of 3 years. The average difference in number of previous pregnancies was .482, with the highest difference being 2.0, reflected in only 4 of the 56 sets. Women from China were enrolled significantly later in their pregnancies than women in the U.S. (p = .04, mean difference of 1.52 weeks), yet the average difference in gestational age across the matched sets was 2.66 weeks.",

Third, we created our matched sets based on three variables we believed were most important to control for at the outset: maternal age, gestational age, and number of previous pregnancies. Given the one child policy in China, we did not match on number of previous deliveries -as that would have eliminated all but the nulliparous women in Ghana and the U.S. and reduced our sample size to an untenably low level. However, upon analysis it was discovered that the number of previous deliveries was significantly different across countries. In China, women were more likely to have had a previous pregnancy that did not result in a delivery. Whether these were induced or spontaneous terminations is not known, although previous research indicates that more than half of women in China have had at least one abortion. [29] It is possible that Chinese women who have had the same number of pregnancies as their African and North American counterparts but have not had as many deliveries are in some way inherently different. Our univariate analysis did indicate that number of deliveries was associated with overall LOT-R scores (p = .004), but this significance was not sustainable in the multivariate logistic regression model.",

In Ghana and China, approximately a third or respondents were high school graduates or less, compared to only seven percent in the U.S. Our data suggest that educational attainment is associated with optimism/pessimism and health-related quality of life. What is less clear is through what mechanism. Further research is needed to disentangle these associations. The second key difference in the samples is related to their reports of current and previous treatment for emotional issues. While nearly 40% of U.S. women in our sample reported ever seeking care for emotional issues, only 5% of Chinese women in our sample said the same. While this may reflect true differences in need for mental health care, more likely it reflects social norms and access issues surrounding treatment for mental health issues. Nonetheless, such differences are indicative of the likely many other variables that would differ across cultures that were not measured in this study and that might have an effect on optimism/pessimism or selfassessed health-related quality of life. Finally, the samples were likely to be very different in terms of standard of living. Women in Ghana were recruited from a public hospital, suggesting lower income participants, whereas women in China and the U.S. were either 'public' or 'private,' depending upon the type of insurance being used. We attempted to assess income to sort out these differences in a meaningful way, but there were numerous challenges. The first is the distinction between family and individual income. In China, family income may or may not include extended family. There may be four -or even six -adults in one household, awaiting the arrival of a single child. In Africa, family income was challenging for some respondents to answer, whether due to lack of knowledge or the challenge of translating non-currency income into survey response options. In addition, assuming for a moment that our survey instrument accurately collected and recorded a representative gradient of incomes in each culture, how does one compare being 'low income' in the U.S. versus being 'low income' in sub-Saharan Africa? The combination of missing data and uncertain interpretation of our income-related items made meaningful comparisons challenging at best, misleading at worst, thus income data were removed from analysis.",

Our sole measure of the ease or difficulty of women's pregnancies was their self-report. That said, the LOT-R measures what is referred to as dispositional (trait) optimism/pessimism -or something that is seen as relatively stable over time. Other measures of situational (state) optimism may have been more responsive to changes over time and may have been influenced by easy or difficult pregnancies. However, for the purposes of this research, we believe that a measure of dispositional optimism/pessimism is the most appropriate and that it should not have been differentially influenced by women's pregnancies. This is corroborated by the finding that despite reporting the easiest pregnancies of the three groups of women, Chinese women in our sample reported the lowest levels of optimism.",

In a review of Chinese folk wisdom of behavioral health, researchers cite that for Chinese subjects, being optimistic means to be able to accept one's current life conditions positively rather than to expect good things to occur in one's life. [30] This is a more present-focused interpretation of optimism, rather than the future-focused interpretation most commonly used in the West. In the West, optimism is defined as the expectation that good things will happen to you in the future.

Is optimism a result of the perception that if one is extremely poor it can't get much worse, so it must be getting better?
