            "text": "Perhaps the most intimate relationship between the environment and the development of the vertebrate species is the interaction of the immune system with infectious disease agents. This is best exemplified by antigenic variations that occur in infectious disease agents such as viral peptides and the corresponding plasticity of the host to recognize the new variant in order to survive. This constant battle between host and parasite has occupied the minds of scientists from a number of disciplines not only including immunologists but also evolutionary biologists. It is hypothesized that the fine components of our innate and acquired immune systems have evolved by such environmental pressures some of which have translated into beneficial outcomes and others to debilitating chronic diseases and others yet to death. The beneficial outcomes clearly outweigh the negatives as evidenced by the mere survival of the human species. The debilitating outcomes are manifest by the ever increasing rise in chronic urban diseases such as asthma or autoimmune diseases and those leading to death include conditions such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), or Ebola haemorragic fever. The recent appearance of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is the latest amongst these challenges for the human immune system. These illnesses may be seen as a \"race\" for evolution between mutualistic partners, one of which is represented by humans. The evolution rates of the partners are always asymmetric for reasons peculiar to each and every interaction (Dawkins and Krebs, 1979) . As a consequence of these factors, however, it is now accepted that coevolutionary processes always favor the rapid rate of evolution, as stated by the Red Queen theory (Bergstrom and Lachmann, 2003) . This explains why, in the challenge against SARS or other emerging infectious diseases, research will be the key element to the \"final victory.\"",

Ironically, the evolution of new etiological agents of disease are reminiscent of the Japanese art of Origami with new patterns and images formed at each and every turn.

In the United States, so far, over two hundred suspected cases in 34 states have been reported, with no lethal case observed (CDC reports as of April 17th, 2003). Some of the specimens found positive for the suspected viral agent were from US patients (Ksiazek et al., 2003) .

Third, the potential of a vector that can transmit this disease (whether alive or not) has yet to be entertained.

The virus belongs to the Coronavirus family although it appears to be significantly different from any known members of the same family so far described based on the entire nucleotide sequence which has recently been determined (Drosten et al., 2003; Ksiazek et al., 2003; Peiris et al., 2003) . It must be stressed, however, that this virus has been identified in most but not all patients diagnosed with SARS thus failing to exclude the co-occurrence of some other infectious agent, as suggested by some evidence (Drosten et al., 2003) , or the presence of a diverse group of Coronavirus.

China, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China, and Viet Nam, 2003) . Accordingly, initial laboratory efforts towards the identification of the responsible agent were focused on a diagnosis based on clinical symptoms and available epidemiologic information. Evidence collected so far (Preliminary clinical description of severe acute respiratory syndrome, 2003) indicates that SARS has an incubation period spanning from 1 to 11 days and the major mode of transmission is through droplet spread, although airborne transmission or a role for contaminated objects cannot be ruled out at the present time. It is accepted that patients are highly infectious during the symptomatic phase of SARS. It is not clear, at present, whether the infectious state is also present in pre-symptomatic stages and/or during recovery. However, a list of hygienic measures that should be implemented has been described by the CDC (Table I) . There is also no current information about the potential for an asymptomatic carrier state. There have been extraordinary efforts already made to identify the agent, obtain viral nucleotide sequence, establish methods to culture and grow the potential agent, develop a reliable ELISA assay, establish RT-PCR conditions, etc.; all made possible by well co-ordinated studies of scientists throughout the world. This degree of co-coperation/sharing of data is a monumental accomplishment by the scientific community and should be applauded. Within this context, unlike HIV where the formulation of an effective candidate vaccine has been a daunting task, it is reasonable to assume that a candidate vaccine for the coronavirus agent responsible for SARS will be a reality in the relatively near future. This is likely because, unlike HIV, a large number of individuals who get infected with SARS, recover from the infection, and appear to become healthy and normal. This evidence suggests that the body's immune system is capable of containing the virus. Thus, it seems reasonable that a safe and effective vaccine in the form of a live attenuated, recombinant, or killed vaccine may become a reality.",

            "text": "Based on epidemiological and clinical characteristics, SARS is the first severe new disease of the 21st century with worldwide epidemic potential. The mode of transmission and its lethal potential have generated alarm. With the notable exception of HIV/AIDS, the new diseases that appeared during the last twenty years or have established endemicity in new geographical areas have features that limit their capacity to pose a major threat to international public health. Some of these, in fact, such as avian influenza (Horimoto and Kawaoka, 2001) , Nipah virus (Hooper and Williamson, 2000) , Hendra virus (Hooper and Williamson, 2000) , Hanta virus (Hawes and Seabolt, 2003) do not demonstrate a high rate of efficient human-to-human transmission. Other infections, such as Escherichia coli O157:H7 (Park et al., 2001) , variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (Taylor, 2002) , strictly depend on food as a vehicle of transmission. West Nile Fever (Nedry and Mahon, 2003) and Rift Valley Fever (Wilson, 1994) that have spread to new geographical areas, beside requiring a vector as part of the transmission cycle, were moreover associated with low mortality, often in high-risk groups. Other entities, such as Neisseria meningitidis W135 (Wilder-Smith et al., 2003) , and the imported haemorrhagic fevers (Ebola, Marburg, and Crimean-Congo; LeDuc, 1989) did not significantly spread from the original strong geographical foci. The Ebola fever, in particular, raised major concerns as some outbreaks of haemorrhagic fever were found associated with mortality rates in the range of 53% in Uganda (Outbreak of Ebola haemorrhagic fever, Uganda, August 2000 -January 2001 , 2001 to 81% in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (Ebola hemorragic fever, Congo-Update, 2003) . It must be stressed, however, that with these agents the transmission of the responsible agents requires close physical exposure to infected blood and other bodily fluids and that, in most cases, patients in the period of high infectivity are too sick to travel. SARS indicates a great potential for rapid international spread under favorable conditions such as those created by the density of international travels. Data available so far (Preliminary clinical description of severe acute respiratory syndrome, 2003) indicate that the incubation period should vary from 1 to 11 days, allowing the infectious agent to be transported, unsuspected and undetected, in an asymptomatic air traveller throughout the world. On the other hand, interpersonal transmission through close contact with respiratory secretions associated with a lack of knowledge of the precise initial symptoms led to a concentration of cases in previously healthy hospital staff and an alarming proportion of patients requiring intensive care. The economic losses due to SARS have already been substantial in S.E. Asia and should SARS continue to spread, will have a global effect.",
