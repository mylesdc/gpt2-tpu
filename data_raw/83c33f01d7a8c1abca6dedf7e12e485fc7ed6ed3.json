Berberine from Argemone ochroleuca can relax airway smooth muscle (ASM); however, whether the nonberberine component of C. phellodendri has similar relaxant action was unclear. An n-butyl alcohol extract of C. phellodendri (NBAECP, nonberberine component) was prepared, which completely inhibits high K + -and acetylcholine-(ACH-) induced precontraction of airway smooth muscle in tracheal rings and lung slices from control and asthmatic mice, respectively. The contraction induced by high K + was also blocked by nifedipine, a selective blocker of L-type Ca 2+ channels. The ACH-induced contraction was partially inhibited by nifedipine and pyrazole 3, an inhibitor of TRPC3 and STIM/Orai channels. Taken together, our data demonstrate that NBAECP can relax ASM by inhibiting L-type Ca 2+ channels and TRPC3 and/or STIM/Orai channels, suggesting that NBAECP could be developed to a new drug for relieving bronchospasm.",

It is bitter in flavor and cold in nature, categorized in kidney, urinary bladder, and large intestine meridians. The traditional functions are to clear heat, dry dampness, purge fire, and remove toxicity. It is one of fundamental traditional Chinese medicines. Previous study reported that C. phellodendri has many physiological activities, including antioxidant [2, 3] , anti-inflammatory [4] [5] [6] , antiulcer [7] , and immune-stimulating properties [8] , as well as neuroprotection and inhibition of coronavirus replication [9, 10] . Moreover, C. phellodendri combining with other herbs can reduce complications of corticosteroidresistant asthma [11] . Berberine is one active ingredient of C. phellodendri; berberine from Argemone ochroleuca was demonstrated to have a relaxant effect in guinea-pig ASM [12] . However, whether the nonberberine component has similar relaxant action has not been investigated. In the present study, we found that an n-butyl alcohol extract of C. phellodendri (NBAECP, nonberberine component) exerted inhibitory action on ASM contraction, and the underlying mechanism was also investigated.",

            "text": "In the present study, our data demonstrate that NBAECP can inhibit L-type Ca 2+ channels, blocking high K + -induced contractions in healthy and asthmatic airway smooth muscle and additionally inhibiting TRPC3 and/or STIM/Orai channels to reduce ACH-induced contractions in both types of airway smooth muscle. These results indicate that NBAECP could be a new bronchodilator for the treatment of asthma. The purpose of this study was to find bronchodilators among Chinese medicines. We extracted a component (NBAECP, nonberberine active ingredient) from C. phellodendri. To investigate whether NBAECP has relaxant action, we used high K + and ACH to contract airway smooth muscle and then observed the effect of NBAECP. NBAECP totally relaxed high K + -induced precontractions (Figure 1 ). High K + could induce membrane depolarization, resulting in the activation of voltage-dependent L-type Ca 2+ channels (VDCCs) [16] . The channels then mediated Ca 2+ influx, resulting in intracellular Ca 2+ concentration increases, leading to muscle contraction. Nifedipine, a selective blocker of VDCCs, completely blocked high K + -induced contractions. This phenomenon was observed in our previous study [14, 17] . These results indicated that high K + -induced contractions completely depended on L-type Ca 2+ channel-mediated Ca 2+ Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine influx. Thus, NBAECP-induced complete inhibition of high K + -induced contraction due to NBAECP resulted in the inhibition of L-type Ca 2+ channels, thus terminating Ca 2+ influx. However, the inhibitory mechanism of NBAECP on L-type Ca 2+ channels must be further investigated. Airway smooth muscle expresses the muscarinic (M) receptor family, which includes 5 subtypes (M1-M5) [18] .",

            "text": "Among them, G protein-coupled M3 plays a more important role in the contraction of airway smooth muscle [19] . Stimulation of M3 by agonists results in intracellular Ca 2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) via the PLC-IP3-IP3R pathway [20] . This leads to intracellular Ca 2+ concentrations increasing and further triggering airway smooth muscle contraction. However, this pathway only mediates transient contractions [21] , while the sustained contraction depends on Ca 2+ influx from the extracellular side and/or Ca 2+ sensitization [22, 23] . Hence, the M3 agonist ACHinduced sustained contraction in airway smooth muscle ( Figure 2 ) was probably due to Ca 2+ influx. Previous reports have demonstrated that L-type Ca 2+ channels play roles in ACH-induced airway smooth muscle contraction [24] . These findings were further confirmed in this study, in which Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine nifedipine partially inhibited ACH-induced contraction in TRs ( Figure 3 ). Moreover, TRPC3 and/or STIM/Orai channels also play roles in ACH-induced contractions [14, 25] . TRPC3 and STIM/Orai channels are nonselective cation channels (NSCCs) that can mediate Ca 2+ influx, resulting in intracellular Ca 2+ increase to trigger airway smooth muscle contraction and contributing to ACH-induced contractions [26] . In our data, following the addition of Pyr 3 (blocker of TRPC3 and STIM/Orai channels), ACH-induced contractions were partly inhibited (Figure 3 ). In addition to L-type Ca 2+ channels and two types of NSCCs, there are still other mechanisms that mediate ACH-induced contraction on the basis of nifedipine-resistant and Pyr 3-resistant contractions being further blocked by NBAECP (Figure 4) . These unknown mechanisms must be further determined in the future.",
