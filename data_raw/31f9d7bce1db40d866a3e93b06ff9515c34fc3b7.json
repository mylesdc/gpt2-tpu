The method is based on either circles or ellipses centered on each PCA centroid; a Relative Risk can be estimated which compares the risk of being a case inside the circle/ellipse to the risk of being a case outside the circle/ellipse [24] . A circle/ellipse is considered a cluster if the Relative Risk is significantly higher or lower than one, when significance was tested using Monte-Carlo simulation. In this study, Poisson models applying both different cluster shapes (circular and elliptic) and sizes (maximum cluster sizes of 50, 20 and 10% of the total population at risk) were built to identify both high-risk and low-risk clusters. No overlapping of the circles/ellipses was allowed.",

In addition, the area with the lowest prevalence for BRSV has a very low beef herd density (2 per 100 km 2 ). This suggests a positive association between herd-density and risk of infection. Statistical analysis confirmed that areas with herd-density >10 per 100 km 2 had significantly higher risk of being part of high-prevalence clusters. A probable explanation is that a short distance between herds increases the risk of spread of the viruses. In such situations, there is a higher likelihood of direct and indirect contact (through e.g. animals, vehicles or visitors) between herds and animals. However, some PCAs in the low-prevalence cluster Kronoberg-Blekinge also had a beef herd-density >10 per 100 km 2 , suggesting that there are other factors with uneven geographic distribution that have an impact on the BCV and BRSV prevalences. Live animal trade, in particular, is considered very important for the spread of infectious diseases and a recent study show that the number of movements and trade patterns in different parts of Sweden vary considerably [28] .",

The size of Swedish beef herds differs between regions and there is a tendency for smaller herd sizes in the regions covering the identified low prevalence areas compared to the high prevalence areas (10 beef adults per herd in Kronoberg-Blekinge versus 16 in Sk\u00e5ne, based on information from the database of the Swedish Board of Agriculture). Also regional differences in biosecurity and management routines in relation to farming styles can be assumed. Based on a study on Swedish dairy farms, it has been suggested that organic herds may have a reduced risk of BCV and BRSV infections, when compared to conventional herds [30] . To quantify the relative impact of potential risk factors for a herd to be detected as BCV or BRSV-infected (e.g. trade intensity, density of dairy herds, herd size, biosecurity measures, type and number of visitors), studies could be conducted by comparing herd characteristics and management practices in the low and high-risk areas identified.
