            "text": "The Collaborative Cross (CC) is a multiparent panel of recombinant inbred (RI) mouse strains derived from eight founder laboratory strains. RI panels are popular because of their long-term genetic stability, which enhances reproducibility and integration of data collected across time and conditions. Characterization of their genomes can be a community effort, reducing the burden on individual users. Here we present the genomes of the CC strains using two complementary approaches as a resource to improve power and interpretation of genetic experiments. Our study also provides a cautionary tale regarding the limitations imposed by such basic biological processes as mutation and selection. A distinct advantage of inbred panels is that genotyping only needs to be performed on the panel, not on each individual mouse. The initial CC genome data were haplotype reconstructions based on dense genotyping of the most recent common ancestors (MRCAs) of each strain followed by imputation from the genome sequence of the corresponding founder inbred strain. The MRCA resource captured segregating regions in strains that were not fully inbred, but it had limited resolution in the transition regions between founder haplotypes, and there was uncertainty about founder assignment in regions of limited diversity. Here we report the whole genome sequence of 69 CC strains generated by paired-end short reads at 303 coverage of a single male per strain. Sequencing leads to a substantial improvement in the fine structure and completeness of the genomes of the CC. Both MRCAs and sequenced samples show a significant reduction in the genome-wide haplotype frequencies from two wild-derived strains, CAST/EiJ and PWK/PhJ. In addition, analysis of the evolution of the patterns of heterozygosity indicates that selection against three wild-derived founder strains played a significant role in shaping the genomes of the CC. The sequencing resource provides the first description of tens of thousands of new genetic variants introduced by mutation and drift in the CC genomes. We estimate that new SNP mutations are accumulating in each CC strain at a rate of 2.4 6 0.4 per gigabase per generation. The fixation of new mutations by genetic drift has introduced thousands of new variants into the CC strains. The majority of these mutations are novel compared to currently sequenced laboratory stocks and wild mice, and some are predicted to alter gene function. Approximately one-third of the CC inbred strains have acquired large deletions (.10 kb) many of which overlap known coding genes and functional elements. The sequence of these mice is a critical resource to CC users, increases threefold the number of mouse inbred strain genomes available publicly, and provides insight into the effect of mutation and drift on common resources.",

            "text": "G ENETIC reference populations derived from multiple parents, or multiparent populations (MPPs), have become popular in a wide variety of model organisms (Churchill et al. 2004; Kover et al. 2009; Huang et al. 2011; King et al. 2012; Bouchet et al. 2017; Cubillos et al. 2017; King and Long 2017; Mangandi et al. 2017; Najarro et al. 2017; Raghavan et al. 2017 : Stanley et al. 2017 Tisn\u00e9 et al. 2017) . The Collaborative Cross (CC) (Supplemental Material, Table S1 lists all abbreviations used throughout this manuscript) is a mouse MPP derived from eight inbred strains that was initially conceived as a mapping population for complex traits and as a platform for integration of phenotypic data across a reproducible set of variable genotypes (our approach to infuse genetics into the field of systems biology) (Threadgill et al. 2002; Churchill et al. 2004) . The CC project first had to overcome an assortment of logistic and financial hurdles (Chesler et al. 2008; Iraqi et al. 2008; Morahan et al. 2008; Collaborative Cross Consortium 2012) . More importantly, our goals had to face the unrelenting resistance of biology that led to an extraordinary rate of extinction among the hundreds of CC lines that were initially set up (Shorter et al. 2017) . Despite these challenges, the CC has been used successfully in both complex trait mapping and systems genetics Kelada et al. 2012; Ferris et al. 2013; Gralinski et al. 2015 Gralinski et al. , 2017 Green et al. 2017) . All of these studies point to the expansion of the phenotypic range previously described in laboratory mice and its continuous distribution for many traits. In addition, these studies reported the breakdown of phenotypic correlations previously thought to be hardwired. It has become evident that CC strains represent a rich source of murine models for human diseases that do not exist or are underrepresented in standard laboratory mice (Rogala et al. 2014) . A timely example of convergence of the main three uses of the CC is provided by a recent study on the effect of genetic variation on Ebola virus susceptibility (Rasmussen et al. 2014) .",

For example, the Diversity Outbred (DO) population is a popular outbred MPP derived from a subset of incompletely inbred CC lines (Svenson et al. 2012) . Tracking the inbreeding and founder contribution in the CC was the motivation behind the development of widely used genotyping platforms such as the Mouse Diversity Array (Yang et al. 2009 ) and the several iterations of the Mouse Universal Genotyping Array (MUGA) (Collaborative Cross Consortium 2012; Morgan et al. 2015) . The CC was the seed for the development of a wide variety of analytic and informatics tools and methods from haplotype mosaic reconstruction, to improvement in the interpretation of genotyping arrays, to genotype imputation of mouse populations, and to new databases (Mott et al. 2000; Fu et al. 2012; Welsh et al. 2013; Gatti et al. 2014; Oreper et al. 2017) . Finally, mouse MPPs in general and the CC and DO in particular were an impetus to sequencing, characterization, and de novo assembly of the genomes of an ever-expanding collection of mouse laboratory strains Yalcin et al. 2011; Wong et al. 2012; Ananda et al. 2014; Doran et al. 2016; Morgan et al. 2016a) . Collectively these contributions have opened new and exciting avenues to answer key long-standing biological questions (Chick et al. 2016; Morgan et al. 2017) .",

More importantly, in 2012 a large collaborative study reported the CC genome architecture based on genotypes of a single mouse from .300 CC lines using the first iteration of the MUGA family of arrays (Collaborative Cross Consortium 2012) . This study included CC lines from all three breeding sites that contributed to the CC population [Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), United States; Tel Aviv University (Tau), Israel; Geniad LLC (Geni), Australia]. Shortly after, CC distribution centers were setup with a uniform set of rules that aimed to ensure the genetic integrity of each strain, expedite inbreeding progress, and facilitate unrestricted access to the CC by researchers independent of their affiliation to the CC project . A key decision was to release each CC strain for public use once it reached a minimum level of inbreeding (typically, at least 90% of the genome fixed for a founder haplotype in that strain). This step requires genotyping of the obligate most recent common ancestors (MRCAs) within each CC strain that has reached the inbreeding threshold. The genome of this set of distributable CC strains is considerably better characterized than the initial CC lines because for each CC strain, we genotyped at least two MRCAs using the second generation, higher-density MegaMUGA genotyping platform . Whole genome sequences are available for the CC strains based on imputation from founder strains sequences in each of the haplotype segments identified through genotyping of the MRCAs (Huang et al. 2014) . Although genotypes, haplotype reconstructions, and imputed genomes based on the MRCAs have been released publicly and are used in published studies, no global analysis of the actual genomes of the distributable CC strains exists.",

First we describe the CC population based on the MegaMUGA genotyping of their MRCAs and second, on whole genome sequence of a single male descended from these MRCAs. Among our main reasons to sequence the CC strains were the desire to increase the spatial resolution of the recombination breakpoints between consecutive haplotypes, to resolve haplotype origin in regions of identity by descent (IBD) that could not be confidently assigned by MUGA genotyping, to identify new mutations introduced by drift during the generation of the CC, and to determine the role of selection in shaping the genome of the CC strains as they reach complete inbred status. The results presented here will improve the power and resolution of the CC as a mapping population, help to explain the emergence of disease phenotypes (CC strains that are phenotypic outliers) in CC strains, and guide the interpretation of findings in the CC and related mouse reference populations.",

The msBWTs were constructed using a hybrid combination of ropeBWT (Li 2014) and the msBWT merge algorithm as described at https://github.com/ holtjma/msbwt/wiki. The msBWTs are a lossless compressed form of the raw, sequenced reads that can be efficiently queried to find number of occurrences of and/or the associated read fragments containing any specified subsequence or k-mer. The msBWTs were used to efficiently genotype each of the sequenced samples, in less time than a short-read alignment followed by variant calling. The msBWTs were also used to do targeted genome assemblies in regions to resolve the exact boundaries of genomic deletions, and to resolve the boundaries of recombination events.",

A set of 42.2 million informative variants between the eight CC founders were extracted from the May 2015, version 5 release of the MGP SNPs and indels variant call format (VCF) file. From this set we selected 31.3 million variants that were biallelic among the CC founder strains and with no other variant within 12 bases. We excluded all Y chromosome variants, due to uncertainties in the sex of the samples sequenced by the Sanger Institute. We replaced these with 42 Y chromosome variants from the Affymetrix Mouse Diversity Array (Yang et al. 2009 (Yang et al. , 2011 that are known to segregate between CC founder males and generate no-calls in female samples.

From these genotypes, we inferred all possible founder origin combinations at each marker genotype (8 inbred and 28 heterozygous combinations for autosomes and 8 founder for hemizygous chromosomes and mitochondria), which, hereafter we refer to as \"36-state probabilities\" founder probabilities at each marker of each individual MRCA. The founder probabilities from the MRCA set of a CC strain were conservatively merged into a composite MRCA 36-state probability to estimate residual heterozygosity (evidence of multiple alleles at any marker between different MRCA samples was declared heterozygous). The founder probabilities of MRCA samples and their composites are summarized by selecting the maximum-likelihood genotype at each locus and allocating its alleles across two pseudophased haplotypes such that the number of founder transitions were minimized, resulting in a \"hapfile.\" All hapfiles were tested to be consistent with the original genotypes. Statistics on the number of recombinations, the fraction of founder contribution to each CC strain, and chromosome ideograms are derived from these hapfiles.",

In 2012 the CC Consortium provided the first overview of the genomes of the CC lines (Collaborative Cross Consortium 2012). However, unfettered access to the CC population has only recently become a reality. This reflects the decision not to release a CC strain until it had reached a minimum level of inbreeding (typically .90% of the genome fixed by haplotype) and the need to establish distribution centers to ensure a common level of genetic QC .",

In the best-case scenario, breakpoints are resolved to recombination intervals spanned by short sequence reads. In the example shown in Figure 2 , the recombination interval in the sequenced sample is 2.5% as long as the one detected by genotyping in the MRCAs (298 bp vs. 11.7 kb, respectively). Given that many of these recombination intervals span known genes, this should also increase power and precision of mapping studies.

Based on the single male sequenced, 19 strains have ,1% residual heterozygosity (but note that 6 of the 19 strains have one or more missing founders). Heterozygosity is found across the genome and is more prevalent in larger autosomes and less so on chromosome X ( Figure  S4 ), reflecting the expected negative correlation with recombination (Broman 2012) . Finally, strains with all eight founders tend to be more heterozygous than strains with missing founders: 8.54% in strains with eight founders, 4.74% in strains with seven founders, and 6.27% in strains with six founders in both MRCAs and sequenced samples (Table S2) .",

We then estimated whether the observed frequency of each one of the 28 heterozygous states is as expected from the overall contribution of the founders to that strain and aggregated data across all 56 CC strains. Interestingly the contribution of the founder strain is not independent of its zygosity status in both cohorts (Wilcoxon rank-sum tests P = 8.5 3 10 23 P = 9.1 3 10 28 MRCAs and sequence, respectively) (Figure 3 ). The three wild-derived strains contribute significantly higher amounts to the heterozygous regions than would be expected from their contribution to the homozygous regions. In fact, the maximum discrepancies between the expected and observed values are found for CAST/EiJ and PWK/PhJ heterozygosity. We conclude that although selection systematically has purged CAST/EiJ and PWK/PhJ from the CC genomes, regions of residual heterozygosity are retained by selection (see Discussion).",

We removed small haplotype blocks (,1 Mb), which represent a tiny fraction (0.03%) of the total genome coverage. The average frequency of private SNPs across all strains, chromosomes, and haplotypes is 0.0867/Mb and the indel frequency is 0.0690/Mb. However, variant call rates associated with PWK/PhJ and CAST/EiJ haplotype blocks are substantially higher than this average (Table S6 ). The rate of SNP calls is increased by twofold to 0.13/Mb and the rate of indels is increased by 10-fold to 0.27/Mb. We hypothesize that the excess of variant calls in two wild-derived genomes have resulted from structural differences from the reference genome and paralogous variation. The chromosome and haplotype specific rates of SNP and indels ( Figure 5A ) are lowest on C57BL/6 haplotypes and moderately increase with genetic distance from the reference strain. Private variant rates on the X chromosome (which are expected to have 1/2 depth of read coverage compared to autosomes in sequence data obtained from male mice) are generally higher than for autosomes. It is interesting to note that chromosome 14, which includes an extensive region of introgression from Mus musculus musculus into the C57BL/6 genome (Yang et al. 2011) , has the lowest rates of private variant calls among PWK/PhJ haplotypes in the CC strains.",

Chromosomal differences were primarily due to the autosome vs. X contrast and haplotype differences were due to the contrast between CAST/EiJ and PWK/PhJ (wild strains) vs. the remaining six founders. The average frequency of private SNP variants on nonwild-derived segments of autosomes is 0.0758/Mb. The frequency of SNP variants is increased 1.66-fold (P , 2e216) on chromosome X and is increased 1.70-fold (P , 2e216) in wild-derived haplotypes. The average frequency of private indels is 0.0353/Mb, approximately half the frequency of SNPs. In contrast to SNPs, indel frequency is not substantially different on the X chromosome compared to autosomes (1.18-fold, P = 1.1e25). However, the frequency of indels on wild-derived haplotypes is increased 7.77-fold (P , 2e216) compared to the nonwild haplotype blocks. As there is no a priori reason to believe that mutation rates are higher in the wild-derived haplotype blocks, we attribute the excess of variants to higher calling error rates in the wild-derived blocks and, to a lesser extent, on the X chromosome. To estimate the rate of accumulation of new variants per breeding generation, we obtained estimates of strain-specific variants from the nonwild autosomal haplotype blocks. There is significant variation in the frequency of private SNPs across the CC strains and a significant trend with the breeding generation of the sequenced animal ( Figure 5B ). The trend corresponds to a rate of SNP accumulation of 2.4 6 0.4 new SNPs per gigabase per generation (P = 8.7e28). The estimated rate of accumulation of indels is 0.48 6 0.32 new events per gigabase per generation, but is not statistically significant (P = 0.14). The impact of calling errors on the estimation of fixation rates is reflected in the intercept of the regression, because calling errors should occur at random with respect to breeding generation. For SNP variants, the estimated frequency of SNPs at generation zero (i.e., the intercept which is 17.1 SNPs per gigabase) is not statistically different from zero (P = 0.084); for indel variants, the intercept (21 indels per gigabase) reaches statistical significance (P = 0.0086), consistent with other evidence supporting a higher error rate for calling private indels. Going forward, validation of private variants will provide accurate estimate of calling error rates.",

We used these assays to validate the deletion in the corresponding sequenced sample and test its status in the MRCAs and in a representative cohort of current mice from the corresponding CC strain. The CC007/Unc deletion was fixed in both MRCAs and the current population. The deletion in CC026/GeniUnc was segregating in the MRCAs but fixed in the current population. This is noteworthy as this deletion removes the entire coding region of several genes, including the complement factor 3 gene (C3) (Figure 6) . Finally, the CC055/ TauUnc deletion was segregating both in the MRCAs and in the UNC Systems Genetics Core Facility colony. This deletion removes eight coding exons of the Npnt gene ( Figure 6 and Figure S7 ). To test the effect of the deletion on Npnt gene expression, we used brain tissue samples collected by our group as part of a survey CC population. Npnt is expressed in the brain of several of the CC founder strains (http://csbio. unc.edu/gecco/) (Crowley et al. 2015) . We used two qPCR assays to measure Npnt messenger RNA (mRNA) levels, one assay targets the Npnt transcript outside of the deletion and one targets the Npnt transcript inside of the deletion region ( Figure S7 and see Materials and Methods). For the assay within the deleted exons, CC055/TauUnc mice homozygous for the partial Npnt deletion had no gene expression, while the level of Npnt gene expression is negatively correlated with the number of deletion alleles in heterozygous and homozygous mice for the wild-type allele (P = 0.011; Figure  S7 ). Furthermore, consistent with the prediction that the deletion does not alter the open reading frame of the Npnt transcript, the assay outside the deleted region amplified transcripts from RNA isolated from all three genotypes (Figure S7) . The results suggest a linear relationship between average steady-state mRNA levels and the number of wildtype alleles. We hypothesize that the deletion either removes a regulatory element or leads to increased levels of mRNA degradation.",

MRCAs, as their name indicates, are ancestors of all CC mice distributed from that strain to the community. The haplotype reconstruction algorithm applied to the MRCAs is designed to retain any haplotype present among the MRCAs independent of its frequency or zygosity status.

For example, the chromosome Y from CAST/EiJ contains sequence present also on the X chromosome of other strains, increasing the dosage of a gene essential for early development (White et al. 2012; Chesler et al. 2016) . Recombination can resolve whether coding and regulatory variants are inherited from one or another founder or represent a new mosaic combination ( Figure 2) .

In this initial analysis, we decided to mask these regions to avoid introducing systematic errors in the haplotype reconstruction and mutation detection due to paralogous variation (Morgan et al. 2016b) . We believe that this has limited effect on the haplotype assignment because these regions are cold spots for recombination and thus flanking regions tend to be concordant. Regions of recent IBD between the five classical inbred founder strains of the CC, which cover 13% (IBD between all five) to 92% (IBD between any two) of the genome (Yang et al. 2011) , pose an additional challenge.

Incorporation of new haplotype-level variants discovered in the CC population and tuning of the HMM in these regions may help mitigate these issues, but absolute certainty is unlikely to be achieved for all of them. This difficulty is less pronounced in MPP from other species, whose founders tend to have less convoluted ancestry (Kover et al. 2009; Huang et al. 2011; King et al. 2012) . Two related mouse genetic reference populations, the CC and the DO, were designed with the expectation that selection would have a modest effect on their genomes. Based on the massive extinction rate among CC funnels (Shorter et al. 2017) , it is obvious that selection has played a major role in shaping the genomes of the CC strains. Here we show that the contribution of CAST/EiJ and PWK/PhJ is significantly below the expectations in the autosomes of the 56 CC strains with contributions from all eight founder strains. This systematic underrepresentation cannot be fully ascribed to drift. Interestingly, the founder contribution in the first generation of inbreeding (Liu et al. 2014) , in the pre-CC experiments , and in the initial description of the genomes (Collaborative Cross Consortium 2012) was balanced ( Figure S9 ). Furthermore, in 347 extinct funnels reported in a companion manuscript (Shorter et al. 2017) , the autosomal haplotype frequencies are very close to the input. We conclude that genome-wide selection against haplotypes from the two wild-derived strains from subspecies underrepresented in the genome of the founders of the CC is responsible for these observations. Inspection of the haplotype frequencies across the genome ( Figure S5 ), the reduced contribution to many autosomes ( Figure S6 ), and the unexpected bias in founder contribution to the residual heterozygosity strongly suggests that selection takes the form of epistatic interactions at multiple loci (Dobzhansky 1934 (Dobzhansky , 1936 . We hypothesize that similar epistatic combinations of alleles from different mouse subspecies are not only responsible for extinction in the CC but also for the prevalence of strains with extreme or Figure 6 Examples of large private deletions.

Top panel shows normalized coverage in whole-genome sequencing (in 1-kb bins) for CC040/Unc; lower panel shows normalized coverage in CC026/GeniUnc. The deletion spans exons (red) from four genes including complement factor gene C3. Assembled sequence spanning the deletion shows microhomology over 9 bp at the breakpoint. (B) Deletion on a 129S1/SvImJ haplotype on chromosome 3: 133 Mb in CC055/TauUnc is not shared with CC018/Unc, which shares the underlying 129S1/SvImJ haplotype. Organization follows that found in A. The deletion spans the middle exons (red) of Npnt, which encodes the integrin-binding protein nephronectin. emerging phenotypes (Rasmussen et al. 2014; Rogala et al. 2014) . In other words, the expansion of the phenotypic range in the live CC strains is the positive side to the astounding rates of extinction observed in the project as a whole. If this is the case, then extinct funnels may provide valuable clues to interpret the results in distributable CC strains. Inspection of the founder contribution to each individual strain in the strains with eight founders indicates that selection against castaneus and musculus haplotypes operated in most strains ( Figure S1 ). In fact, in strains with fewer than eight founders but with contributions of CAST/EiJ and/or PWK/PhJ, the deficit in the contribution of these strains is magnified although it does not reach statistical significance.",

In our analysis of 69 inbred CC strains, we were able to identify and place a lower bound on the rate of fixation of new SNPs and small indel variants. These rates are dependent on our current colony management practices but it is not likely that we can reduce drift to much lower levels. While small in number, the changes are cumulative. The great majority of new variants will be phenotypically neutral but some will have phenotypic consequences that may range from subtle to dramatic. Because new mutations are specific to one strain, they cannot be mapped directly using the strain panel, but they can be localized using secondary crosses. Rather than focus on the negative impacts of new mutations, we would like to emphasize their potential for providing new models for disease-related phenotypes. Identification of mutations and their likely functional consequences is key to leveraging genetic drift to our advantage. This is exemplified by studies in which crosses between very closely related strains have led directly to the identification of causal polymorphisms (Kumar et al. 2013) .",
