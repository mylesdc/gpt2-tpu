Compared to patients only infected at exacerbation, the re-infected children significantly exhibited lower levels of IFN-\u03b3 in plasma and sputum at exacerbation associated with modifications in PRR expression and function in blood mononuclear cells.

Impairment in anti-viral response has been reported in asthmatic patients infected with hRV, as shown by altered production of type I IFNs (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2) and/or type III IFNs [interleukin (IL)-28 and IL-29] [8] [9] [10] [11] . However, if the deficient IFNs response has been reported in severe asthma, associated with a defect in TLR activation, it was not observed in well controlled asthma [12] [13] [14] .",

We hypothesized that alteration of the expression and/or function of virus sensors is associated with impaired innate immune response during virus-induced asthma exacerbation. Moreover, these alterations might impact on clinical and inflammatory profiles. To test this hypothesis, the anti-viral response and the expression and function of the virus sensors in blood mononuclear cells were explored in a cohort of allergic asthmatic children admitted to hospital with a diagnosis of severe exacerbation. Evaluation also included clinical features and airway and blood inflammation and was done at exacerbation and repeated at steady state, 8 weeks later. First, we compared virus infected to not-infected patients at exacerbation. Secondly, as our results showed that an infection with a different virus is frequently detected in asthmatic patients at steady state [15, 16] , we focused on the virus-infected patients at exacerbation in order to compare patients infected at both times to those only infected at the exacerbation.",

Low production of type I and III interferons by AEC and alveolar macrophages experimentally infected by hRV has been reported in asthmatic children and adults [8] [9] [10] 14] , more profound in severe atopic asthma [12] . In the present study, patients infected with hRV appeared to display the same impairment (data not shown). In contrast, Bergauer et al. recently reported that IFN-\u03b1 levels were markedly increased in a small cohort of hRV-infected symptomatic asthmatic children (4.8 \u00b1 0.64 years) as compared with infected but asymptomatic patients whereas IL-29 synthesis remains unchanged [11] . Our results suggest that IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03bb production is altered during virus-induced exacerbations in asthmatic children. Compared to our study, the population differs from that of Bergauer et al. by the age and also the severity of the exacerbation [11] . Furthermore, their results seems to be inconsistent on a larger cohort. At last in our V+ patients, the alteration of the anti-viral response was not linked to a modification of the expression of PRR of blood DC and monocytes nor with a blockade of their function. These results might also suggest that the alteration of the anti-viral response might preferentially be observed in the airways compared with blood cells.",

IL-29 and a b c Fig. 3 Impact of viral status on blood mononuclear cell phenotype during asthma exacerbation and at steady state. a-b) CD86 expression was measured on circulating cDCs, pDCs and monocytes from asthmatic children during the exacerbation (a) and steady state (b), using flow cytometry. During the exacerbation, patients were classified as being infected (V+) or not infected (V-). c) The levels of IL-6, IL-5 and IL-22 were measured in supernatants of PBMCs incubated in medium alone (baseline) and then stimulated with the TLR7-8 ligand gardiquimod. The median of our results was reported by the horizontal line, the 25 and 75 interquartile range by the box and the minimum and the maximum by the whiskers. *: p < 0.05 versus V-patients IFN-\u03b3 production were also lower at steady state, despite the presence of a new virus. As compared with V + V-, TLR3 and RNA-helicases were overexpressed on circulating APCs in V + V+ patients. During exacerbation, their PBMC showed an altered IFN-\u03b3 and IL-29 production after TLR3 and RIGI activation, that might facilitate the viral re-infection according to the IL-29 function [30] . The IL-29 production in response to TLR7-8 ligand was also impaired, suggesting a defective function of these receptors in PBMC from V + V+ patients, as recently reported in alveolar macrophages [14] . IFN-\u03b3 and IL-29 production impairment may be due to an altered signaling. Different mechanisms might be responsible for this defective production. Transforming growth factor-\u03b2 inhibits IFN production in response to hRV [31] . The implication of suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)1 overexpression in airway epithelium of severe asthmatic children have been suggested [32] although this is controversial [33] . Our data suggest that a specific alteration of the anti-viral response related to a dysfunction of virus sensors characterize these re-infected patients. Viral infection during the exacerbation has also an impact on the airway inflammation as shown by the persistent increased sputum eosinophilia and its correlation with the IL5 concentrations, in agreement with Norzila et al. [27] . Th2 cytokines alter the innate immune response to viral infection and favor the development of a specific inflammatory reaction [34] . In V + V+, the lack of increase in IL-5 levels suggests that virusinfections don't directly influence IL-5 in this subgroup. Nevertheless, it has been reported that viral infection in an allergic environment can induce IL-5 synthesis by CD8 + T cells, probably due to PRR activation in DC [35] . Interestingly, the production of IL-5 after TLR7-8 stimulation was primed in PBMC from V+ patients, a result probably due to the V + V-subgroup. Concomitantly, DC activation during exacerbation was demonstrated by the over-expression of CD86 and contributes to the APC propensity to induce IL-5 secretion by T lymphocytes in infected patients. The link between Th2 inflammation and antiviral response is also illustrated by the restoration of IFN-\u03b1 production by plasmacytoid DC in allergic asthmatic children treated with omalizumab [36] .",

This defect is associated with an overexpression of virus sensors, a defective response to the corresponding ligands and with a specific airway inflammation. The benefit of strategies integrating an antiviral approach in this subgroup of patients should be further explored.
