While developed countries easily adapt their wellorganized routine laboratory services, resource-limited countries need considerable capacity building as many gaps still exist. In this paper, we discuss some of the eff orts made by the African Field Epidemiology Network (AFENET) in supporting laboratory capacity development in the Africa region. The eff orts range from promoting graduate level training programs to building advanced technical, managerial and leadership skills to in-service short course training for peripheral laboratory staff . A number of specifi c projects focus on external quality assurance, basic laboratory information systems, strengthening laboratory management towards accreditation, equipment calibration, harmonization of training materials, networking and provision of pre-packaged laboratory kits to support outbreak investigation. Available evidence indicates a positive eff ect of these eff orts on laboratory capacity in the region. However, many opportunities exist, especially to support the roll-out of these projects as well as attending to some additional critical areas such as biosafety and biosecuity. We conclude that AFENET's approach of strengthening national and sub-national systems provide a model that could be adopted in resource-limited settings such as sub-Saharan Africa.",

Th e need for building laboratory diagnostic capacity in Africa has been well articulated over the recent past [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . Conse quently, there have been eff orts to enhance laboratory capacity over the past fi ve years in many sub-Saharan countries. Th ese eff orts have largely been driven by the need for improved laboratory support to surveillance and treatment programs for specifi c diseases such as HIV/ AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis (TB) and avian infl uenza [7] at national and a few regional centers. Indeed, a recent review by Olmsted et al (2010) suggests a general improvement in infrastructure and service provision [8] . However, more challenges still exist, including the lack of suffi cient numbers of well-trained laboratory scientists in public health service and inadequate laboratory management and leadership skills. Th ere is no or limited distribution of available national laboratory guidelines and a lack of internal and external quality assurance systems, which is usually accompanied by low appreciation of quality control. No eff orts have been made towards assist ing laboratories to attain international standards such as ISO 15189 and hence slow progress to accreditation. Other challenges have been the poor quality, limited analysis and utilization of laboratory data; inconsistent and inadequate reagent supply chains; and lack of equipment maintenance [9] .",

Th is approach addressed a number of the technical and logistical challenges of re-testing as reported in the Atlanta and Kenya studies [13] . Th e DTS is a cost-eff ective approach and is easy to prepare, stable at high temperatures and can be transported by mail to any part of the country. Working with CDC, in-country teams and the host country health ministries, 200 laboratory and nonlaboratory testing sites in each country were selected. DTS panels are produced by the national reference laboratories and distributed to these sites on a quarterly basis (or depending on country algorithm) through the postal services. After testing at the sites, the results are sent back to the reference laboratories for analysis and scoring. Feedback reports are generated and poorly performing sites are provided with support supervision visits and/or retraining. Th e project supports the mailing costs, data entry and laboratory scientists to provide technical backup.",

At both the national and sub-national levels, only a few countries have functional public health laboratory networks in place. In order to strengthen public health capacity within Africa, AFENET created an AFENET-Lab unit to oversee the networking and implementation of laboratory strength en ing initiatives. One of the unit's mandates is to promote public health net working and cross-border collaborations between sub-national, national, regional and inter national public health laboratories and laboratorians for information sharing, technical support, training and other capacity building programs. We believe that this will enhance labora tory capacity by reducing the isolation of peri pheral laboratories and enabling them to access network resources.
