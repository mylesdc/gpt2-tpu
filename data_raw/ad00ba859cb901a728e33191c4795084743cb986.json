Children infected with enterovirus exhibit from asymptomatic, mild symptoms (enteroviruslike illness, EVI) to severe forms with neurologic sequelae, cardiopulmonary failure or death [2, 3] . With no effective antiviral therapy available and an EV71 vaccine under development [4] [5] [6] [7] , surveillance of EVI is necessary to detect early signals, reduce cluster size, and slow spreading. School children infected with influenza have higher viral loads, longer shedding of viruses, and higher attack rates, thus are more likely to amplify transmission and create clusters of influenza-like illness (ILI) cases in families and schools [8] [9] [10] . An effective early outbreak detection system for school children is, therefore, essential to public health [11, 12] .",

During the 2009 pandemic influenza H1N1 (pdm H1N1/09), the numbers of student ILI cases in Taipei surged. A community-based internet accessible, timely syndromic surveillance system thus replaced past facsimile-based paper reporting. Taipei City had a population of 425,709 schoolchildren from preschools to secondary schools (16% of total) in an area of 271.80 km 2 in 2010 [14] and higher isolation rates of the novel pdm H1N1/09 virus in Taiwan [15] . Therefore, the Department of Health in Taipei (Taipei-DOH) implemented the first daily School-based Infectious Disease Syndromic Surveillance System (SID-SSS) with a 100% coverage rate of registered educational institutions from preschools to colleges and universities beginning in January 2010. This is the first report to demonstrate the results of a newly-developed syndromic surveillance system with cases identified by non-medical professionals for early detection of common pediatric infectious diseases in the community. The specific aims of this study were: (1) to evaluate the timeliness and feasibility of the novel SID-SSS routinely operating in schools, (2) to find ways to improve its application in public health, and (3) to share our valuable experiences in Taipei with public health professionals in other countries to promote better global surveillance networks in the future.",

The system requires all school nurses or class teachers (for those preschools without nurses) of every enrolled institution to collect the following two types of data on a daily basis: (1) obligatory reporting of clinical and epidemiologic information (type of the suspected infection, date of symptom onset, and the class, grade, gender and age of the sick student), and (2) optional supplementary information recorded with a text format (total numbers of absent days with sick children, family members with similar symptoms, medical care transfers, physician diagnosis, and school case management). From this, the SID-SSS can automatically detect the presence and numbers of syndromic cases and school clusters, and capture the secondary cases in schools and from families as well. A \"cluster\" was defined as two or more epidemiologically-linked cases (at the same class in the same school) occurring within seven consecutive days for EVI, and those within three consecutive days for ILI, red eye, diarrhea and others. Once a cluster happens, a real-time textmessage alert through short message service (SMS) is immediately sent to the public health professionals for further epidemiologic investigations. Then, an epidemiology team in charge of daily monitoring for the disease trends and the Centers for Disease Control in Taipei (e.g. Taipei-CDC) decides the follow-up public health risk management. Different diseases have various criteria to trigger subsequent investigations. The team initiated outbreak investigations and control measures, once the index EVI case, or more than 2 EVI cases, would be detected within a one-time interval, or an EVI cluster event occurred during an epidemic season. The investigation of ILI cases started when the numbers of ILI cases showed abnormally high after comparing the trends of ILI cases in the same weeks in previous years as well as ILI school or family clusters.",

In Taipei, nearly 100% of primary and secondary schools had at least one registered nurse on-site in the compulsory education system, because each school is required to have at least one or two registered nurse(s) for schools with a total number of classes fewer than 40 or with over 40 classes, respectively. Several training workshops were held in December, 2009 to teach school nurses and teachers the public health significance, the differential diagnosis of common pediatric diseases, operation procedures to report to the SID-SSS, legal requirements for reporting, and possible penalties for non-reporting. In addition, post-operation feedback workshops were also held to promote the SID-SSS, and to identify users' difficulties for further improvement.",

Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 16.0 (SPSS, Inc, Chicago, IL, USA).

Cases (clinic visits) were defined by the selected ICD-9 codes, and health seeking population was estimated by a capture-recapture approach [17, 18] . Chi-square tests and the Pearson correlation coefficients were used for percentage comparisons and correlations, respectively. T-tests were used to compare the means of incidence obtained from different school groups (preschool, primary, and secondary school students and others).

All 12 districts were classified into the four geographic groups-A, B, C, and D, based on their spatial relationships and socioeconomic development status [19] . Group A, B, C and D represented the Taipei Central Businesses District (Taipei-CBD), the para-CBD, the north, and south-east suburban areas, respectively. The district-specific incidence rates of ILI or EVI syndromic cases per 1000 students were calculated by the number of the reported cases for each district divided by the total number of children from the registered preschools to secondary schools in that district. These data were ranked as 1 st to 5 th quantile for different levels of incidences, based on these four geographic groups. ArcGIS 9.3 program of Geographical Information System (GIS) was used for spatial analysis. The Kriging method [20, 21] was applied to interpolate each grid cell over a spatial domain. To assess the spatio-temporal relationship among the studied cases in a diffusion map, the distance between the centroid of each grid was calculated as the spatial relationship between the incidence rates of the ILI or EVI cases in each district. We made a surface plot of weekly time series as a gradient interpolated between adjacent weeks and district data points. Distance in the map symbolized relative geographic relationship rather than actual distance.",

Diarrhea: Diarrhea cases were reported at a relatively low frequency, with sporadic peaks presented in spring and autumn. No similarity in trends of diarrhea was identified among the four different age groups (S1B Fig). In summary, the pre-diagnostic data reported from the SID-SSS offered a two-week advance in detecting the peaks of EVI and ILI. During the three semesters, the Pearson's correlation coefficient was the highest in EVI (ranged 0.818-0.976) than those of the other three syndrome groups ( Table 2) . Even though the trends of ILI did not show compatible correlation at the beginning, the Pearson's correlation coefficient reached 0.95 in the second semester School-Based Syndromic Surveillance System in Taipei and remained high in the third semester after the training program. Therefore, the temporal trends of these two diseases with the SID-SSS reflect the actual situation in the community, as they are verified by the parallel data patterns from the ED-SSS with significant correlations during the school semesters from 2010 to 2011. This is supported by the results of high percentages of consistency between the initial pre-diagnoses judged and reported by school personnel and the physicians' clinical diagnoses, up to 97.80% in EVI and 98.88% in ILI.",

There are four major strengths in the SID-SSS. First, daily report of pre-diagnosis data from bottomup non-medical professionals in schools detected earlier peaks of EVI and ILI cases than those found from the conventional hospital-based surveillance system. School teachers and nurses participated in public health activities and shared the workload with local public health professionals, thus minimizing the size of clusters and the scale of epidemics. Second, inter-departmental coordination by the three government agencies in health, education, and social welfare through top-down systematic approaches helped to reach ultimate common goals of public health. Third, applying computer technology to infectious disease surveillance provided user-friendly interface that improved efficiency and reduced the cost. Fourth, an integrated data analysis and the follow-up spatial-temporal epidemiological information may help to identify high risk populations and areas for public health intervention [22] . Therefore, the SID-SSS can guide public health professionals in using evidence-based data to implement more effective prevention and control measures.",

The time difference between epidemic peaks with the SID-SSS and the ED-SSS can be explained by their coverage of different age groups [29] and health-seeking behaviors. The ED-SSS at the selected medical centers offers the medical information all-year-round, across all-age-groups and most of severe cases, whereas the SID-SSS targeting mostly at mild cases among school-age-children offers a daily reliable data from the community-based, prediagnosis surveillance. Therefore, the SID-SSS cannot completely replace the ED-SSS but these two systems can complement each other. Importantly, the EVI cases increased in preschool children as the first peak in the SID-SSS not only provided the earliest warning signal as the trumpet call for a potentially emerging enterovirus epidemic but also reflected the true EVItrends in local communities by complementing the schools' break periods. On the contrary, ILI cases of preschools, primary, and secondary schools all peaked in the same week, implying the fast antigenic drift of influenza viruses can undergo a rapid spread in all age groups. Therefore, a future vaccination for EV71 (the most important causing agent for severe EVI) should target preschool children [6, 30] , as was polio vaccine [31] , whereas vaccination of influenza, particularly for novel influenza viruses with pandemic potential, needs to cover both preschool and older school children to quickly reduce the numbers of susceptible children.",

Higher male to female ratios of EVI and red eye cases in the SID-SSS, similar to previous findings [32] , may be attributed to gender-related behaviors.

Moreover, the SID-SSS is not only a reporting system but also a documentation system for all follow-up actions involving a broad spectrum of services offered from case identification to recording follow-up prevention and control measures. School administrators can also access the surveillance data at the same time as the officials of these three government bureaus on a real-time basis. In addition, this internetaccessible reporting system has better acceptability than paper-reporting system due to a more user-friendly website interface. What is perhaps more impressive is that local school teachers/ nurses become important implementers, providing essential public health intervention measures such as isolation, seasonal flu vaccination, school closure, and class suspension. Furthermore, our data showed that the reporting of EVI surged and correlation of ILI improved in the second semester of 2010, after several training workshops aimed at the public health significance of surveillance and usefulness of the SID-SSS were held. Again, all these results illustrate the significance to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of this newly developed surveillance system.",

First, the data were limited by holidays and school breaks, particularly the data from Lunar New Year holidays and the flu season remained bottle-necked. Second, the specificity of SID-SSS requires improvement by taking specimens via proportional sampling for better integration with virological surveillance, similar to many sentinel-physician influenza surveillance systems [36] [37] [38] . Third, inequality of reporting was noted among different disease syndrome-groups, and with lower reporting from colleges, universities and after-school centers. The institutions with shortage of personnel responsible for reporting, and the colleges/universities protecting academic freedom may result in lower proportion of reporting. Interactive mode with two-way communications in the web 2.0 version could be helpful to remove these barriers and thus reaching the mutual goal of public health. Fourth, the follow-up case management information is recorded to the SID-SSS with an optional text format blank to be filled in (rather than a standard format), including transfers to hospital care. However, the proportion of cases visited EDs or outpatient clinics cannot be accurately measured. Future improvement needs to design user-friendly options to track the follow-up medical care and control measures in more detail.",

To enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of reporting, we suggest giving \"School of the Month\" awards for recognizing the most dedication in reporting, along with continuing training programs, and simple pre-and post-training feedback are necessary. In addition, incorporating valuable information, including the subsequent medical transfers, vaccination records, child's growth development progress, body mass index, asthma and history of chronic diseases [39] [40] [41] into the SID-SSS can maximize its usefulness. However, the surveillance of school children should adhere to safeguards to minimize stigmatizing or labeling [42] .",

Besides geographical networking and collaboration with academic institutions, more evidence-based strategies can be developed and adequately evaluated to facilitate child health and social security. A novel surveillance through social media [43] could be added to complement the weaknesses in lower reporting in colleges and universities. As more and more humans are infected with novel avian influenza viruses [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] , our goal is to provide an alternative system to detect potentially pandemic threats from emerging infectious diseases of unknown etiological agents, particularly in rural areas near poultry farms where many zoonotic infections originated.",
