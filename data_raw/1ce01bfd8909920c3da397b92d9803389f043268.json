A K359H (KH) RdRp derivative is slow and faithful relative to wild-type enzyme. In the context of the KH virus, RdRp-coding sequence evolves, selecting for the following substitutions: I331F (IF, motif-C) and P356S (PS, motif-D). We have evaluated IF-KH, PS-KH, and IF-PS-KH viruses and enzymes. The speed and fidelity of each double mutant are equivalent. Each exhibits a unique recombination phenotype, with IF-KH being competent for copy-choice recombination and PS-KH being competent for forced-copy-choice recombination. Although the IF-PS-KH RdRp exhibits biochemical properties within twofold of wild type, the virus is impaired substantially for recombination in cells. We conclude that there are biochemical properties of the RdRp in addition to speed and fidelity that determine the mechanism and efficiency of recombination. The interwoven nature of speed, fidelity, the undefined property suggested here, and recombination makes it impossible to attribute a single property of the RdRp to fitness. However, the derivatives described here may permit elucidation of the importance of recombination on the fitness of the viral population in a background of constant polymerase speed and fidelity.",

Together, the two substitutions restore all biochemical properties of the derivative to near wild-type levels. Individually, however, we observe differences in the mechanism (copy-choice vs. forced-copy-choice) and efficiency of recombination by each derivative, although each derivative exhibits equivalent speed and fidelity. We conclude that biochemical properties in addition to speed and fidelity must exist and contribute to both the mechanism and efficiency of recombination.

Rapid response to an outbreak caused by an unexpected viral pathogen requires, minimally, the existence of broad-spectrum, antiviral therapeutics. Prevention requires the availability of vaccines, development of which could take years. Indeed, approved vaccines still do not exist to prevent infections by West Nile virus or severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, and these outbreaks occurred more than one decade ago.",

Briefly, UnaG-encoding sequence [28] carrying a 3C protease cleavage site at its carboxyl terminus was inserted between the IRES and the P1 region of the PV sequence. Translation occurred from the natural poliovirus initiation codon. Proteolytic cleavage and release of the fluorescent protein occurred by normal 3C protease activity. Plasmids encoding PV genomes (full length or subgenomic) were linearized with ApaI. All linearized cDNAs were transcribed in vitro using T7 RNA Polymerase and treated with 2U DNAse Turbo (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA) to remove residual DNA template. The RNA transcripts were purified using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA) before spectrophotometric quantification. Purified RNA in RNase-free H 2 O was transfected into either HeLa or L929 fibroblasts using TransMessenger (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA). Virus yield was quantified by plaque assay. Briefly, cells and media were harvested at 2-3 days post-transfection, subjected to three freeze-thaw cycles, and clarified. Supernatant was then used on fresh HeLa cells in 6-well plates; virus infection was allowed to continue for 30 min. Media was then removed, and cells were washed twice with PBS (pH 7.4) washes before a 0.8% (w/v) agarose-media overlay was added. Cells were incubated for 2-3 days and then fixed and stained with crystal violet for virus quantification.",

Almost invariably, the derivatives changed residues remote from the catalytic site, thus using an allosteric mechanism to perturb fidelity. Among the most famous of these is the G64S substitution in PV RdRp [16, 17, 34] . Many years ago, our laboratory showed that the active site of all polymerases contain a general acid, Lys-359 in the case of PV RdRp, that protonated the pyrophosphate leaving group during nucleotidyl transfer, thereby increasing the catalytic efficiency of RdRp [25] . Substitutions of Lys-359 in PV RdRp give rise to changes in fidelity [7, 18] . The arginine substitution of Lys-359 (K359R RdRp) and the histidine substitution (K359H RdRp) catalyze nucleotidyl transfer at a rate 10-fold lower than wild type [25] .

When PV is rescued from in vitro transcribed RNA, four passages are required for the genetic diversity of the viral population to come to equilibrium [11] . During this time for K359H PV, mutations were observed in RdRp-coding sequence that changed the plaque phenotype of the virus. One change was in motif C, I331F, and the other change was in motif D, P356S ( Figure 1A ,B). We have adopted the following nomenclature to refer to the various mutant PVs and their corresponding RdRps: I331F-K359H, IF-KH; P356S-K359H, PS-KH; and I331F-P356S-K359H, IF-PS-KH. In order to compare the impact of these substitutions on PV genome replication without complication of reversion, we engineered the various substitutions into a subgenomic replicon, where the capsid coding P1 region was replaced with the gene for firefly luciferase, producing luciferase as an indirect measure of viral RNA produced [39] [40] [41] . Experiments in the presence of guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl) report on translation of transfected RNA in the absence of replication ( Figure 1C ). Relative to WT PV, K359H was the most debilitated, with replication failing to reach an end point at 10 h post-transfection ( Figure 1C ). Each double mutant was markedly better than K359H alone, but the addition of I331F conferred a greater replication advantage than P356S ( Figure 1C ). The triple mutant replicated even faster but still exhibited a significant reduction in the rate of replication relative to WT ( Figure 1C ). changes in fidelity [7, 18] . The arginine substitution of Lys-359 (K359R RdRp) and the histidine substitution (K359H RdRp) catalyze nucleotidyl transfer at a rate 10-fold lower than wild type [25] . The impact of the arginine substitution of Lys-359 on PV fidelity and its potential application to vaccine development have been described [7] . Biological studies of K359H PV were not reported, because this virus was not genetically stable. When PV is rescued from in vitro transcribed RNA, four passages are required for the genetic diversity of the viral population to come to equilibrium [11] . During this time for K359H PV, mutations were observed in RdRp-coding sequence that changed the plaque phenotype of the virus. One change was in motif C, I331F, and the other change was in motif D, P356S ( Figure 1A ,B). We have adopted the following nomenclature to refer to the various mutant PVs and their corresponding RdRps: I331F-K359H, IF-KH; P356S-K359H, PS-KH; and I331F-P356S-K359H, IF-PS-KH. In order to compare the impact of these substitutions on PV genome replication without complication of reversion, we engineered the various substitutions into a subgenomic replicon, where the capsid coding P1 region was replaced with the gene for firefly luciferase, producing luciferase as an indirect measure of viral RNA produced [39] [40] [41] . Experiments in the presence of guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl) report on translation of transfected RNA in the absence of replication ( Figure 1C ). Relative to WT PV, K359H was the most debilitated, with replication failing to reach an end point at 10 h posttransfection ( Figure 1C ). Each double mutant was markedly better than K359H alone, but the addition of I331F conferred a greater replication advantage than P356S ( Figure 1C ). The triple mutant replicated even faster but still exhibited a significant reduction in the rate of replication relative to WT ( Figure 1C ). Location of I331, P356, and K359 in structure of PV RdRp. Palm, fingers, and thumb subdomains are shown. Conserved structural motifs are colored: A, red; B, green; C, yellow; D, blue; E, purple; F, orange; G, black. (C) Replication phenotypes observed for K359H PV and KH-containing PV mutants by using a replicon assay. Replication was monitored using a subgenomic replicon firefly luciferase.

Interestingly, the growth properties of the viruses were not as expected based on the experiments with the replicon. Each mutant virus exhibited the same delay relative to WT virus prior to the first detection of infectious virus after four hours post-infection (hpi) (Figure 2A) . Thereafter, growth of each virus was far more distinct than observed for the replicon, with PS-KH PV much slower than IF-KH PV and IF-PS-KH PV was substantially faster than both double mutants ( Figure 2A ). The differences in outcome could reflect the differences in replication efficiency and/or a direct consequence of the substitutions in 3D-coding sequence on virus assembly or spread caused by changes to 3CD protein or 3D-containing precursor protein [29, 42] . After a productive infection, the exponential phase of genome replication by PV typically occurs between 2 and 6 h post-infection, with virus assembly occurring between 4 and 8 h post-infection. Release of infectious virus by lytic and/or non-lytic mechanisms can occur once virus is assembled and can persist for longer than 24 hours.",

As a result, our experiments generally use genomes instead of PFU as the unit of measure [11] . In doing so, we can use genomes/PFU as a measure of the specific infectivity. The instability of KH PV precluded rigorous, quantitative analysis of this virus, but at least 10-fold more KH PV than WT PV was required to observe a comparable number of plaques. Both substitutions were able to increase the efficiency of plaque formation relative to KH PV ( Figure 2B ). Indeed, the specific infectivity of IF-KH PV was equivalent to WT. The addition of PS to IF-KH reduced the efficiency of plaque formation; the specific infectivity of IF-PS-KH PV was reduced by twofold relative to IF-KH PV ( Figure 2B ). Therefore, the behavior of PS-KH PV in the PFU-based growth assay relative to the replicon assay likely reflects an additional defect to virus assembly and/or spread.",

To test this possibility, we evaluated the sensitivity of each virus population to growth in the presence of ribavirin. We reasoned that the mutagenic activity of ribavirin would exhibit the greatest negative impact on viruses with a mutator phenotype as described previously [11] . Relative to WT, K359H PV exhibited the highest fidelity based on the 2-log difference in sensitivity to ribavirin ( Figure 2C ). IF-KH and PS-KH PVs also exhibited a higher fidelity than WT PV ( Figure 2C ). Importantly, both mutants exhibited essentially equivalent fidelity phenotypes ( Figure 2C ), consistent with the suggestion above that the reduced efficiency of plaque formation observed for PS-KH PV is likely related to impairment of virus assembly and/or spread. Finally, evaluation of IF-PS-KH PV revealed equivalent sensitivity of this mutant to ribavirin as observed for WT PV ( Figure 2C ), suggesting that fidelity had been returned to normal.",

Based on the experiments performed above, these viruses and their polymerases replicate with comparable efficiency and fidelity ( Figures 1A and 2C,D) .

The replication efficiency and fidelity of this virus and its polymerase were always within twofold of that observed for WT ( Figures 1A  and 2C,D) .

It was possible that PS-KH PV was defective for virus assembly and/or spread, at least lytic spread ( Figure 2B ). In order to score for recombinant viruses that spread by either a lytic or non-lytic mechanism, we engineered the acceptor template to encode the UnaG [28] green fluorescent protein ( Figure 3C ). The polyprotein was designed such that UnaG protein is released from capsid precursor protein by 3C protease activity. Observation of green cells were visible from a donor-acceptor pair producing WT RdRp as early as 7 hpi, with increases continuing over a 48-h period ( Figure 3D ). With the sensitivity of this assay and the absence of a requirement for lytic spread, it is clear that PS-KH PV exhibits a recombination defect ( Figure 3D ). exhibit the same phenotypes ( Figure 3B ). While IF-KH PV produced viable recombinant virus, PS-KH PV did not ( Figure 3B ). Based on the experiments performed above, these viruses and their polymerases replicate with comparable efficiency and fidelity ( Figures 1A and 2C,D) . Even more surprising, however, was the observation that IF-PS-KH PV was impaired more than one log relative to WT PV in its ability to produce viable recombinants ( Figure 3B ). The replication efficiency and fidelity of this virus and its polymerase were always within twofold of that observed for WT ( Figures  1A and 2C,D) . Together, these results suggest that there are properties of the PV RdRp important for recombination that are not revealed by our existing biological and biochemical assays. The one caveat of the recombination assay is that the recombinant viruses produced must be able to form plaques, which may mean that the recombinant virus must spread by a lytic mechanism.

(A) Schematic of the PV recombination assay used [31] . Two RNAs are used: a replication-competent subgenomic RNA lacking capsid-coding sequence (donor RNA); and a replication-incompetent fulllength genomic RNA with a defective cis-acting replication element (CRE, indicated by hairpin with defective version indicated by X) in 2C-coding sequence (acceptor RNA). Co-transfection of these RNAs produces infectious virus if recombination occurs. (B) The indicated PV RdRp was engineered into both donor and accepter RNA and co-transfected into a L929 mouse fibroblast cell line. Infectious virus produced by recombination in L929 cells was determined by plaque assay using HeLa cells. Each point shown is an independent experiment reflecting the average of three replicates.

However, in the few instances in which RdRp derivatives exhibiting perturbed fidelity have been characterized, these derivatives also exhibit changes to the rate of nucleotide addition [7, 11, 18, 23, 43] . Relative to wild-type polymerase, a higher fidelity polymerase is a slower enzyme, and a lower fidelity polymerase is a faster enzyme [7, 11, 18, 23, 43] . Polymerase speed will clearly determine replication kinetics and therefore can contribute to viral fitness, as has been suggested recently [18] . The most extensively characterized fidelity mutants of PV harbor an RdRp with a substitution located at a remote site that likely causes substantial collateral damage, further confounding the fidelity-versus-speed debate [5, 17] . This study was motivated by the need to better understand the relationship between the biochemical properties of the viral RdRp and viral fitness, virulence, and pathogenesis. We have had in hand for a long time a PV mutant whose speed and fidelity were perturbed by changing an RdRp active-site residue, K359H [25] . We did not publish this PV mutant until now because of its genetic instability ( Figure 1A) . We realized that this genetic instability might actually represent an opportunity, as the biochemical phenotypes reverted by the second-site suppressors might highlight the biochemical properties driving viral fitness.",

The K359H substitution will change the efficiency of that protonation event for two reasons. First, the pKa value of histidine is substantially lower than lysine and will therefore not be protonated to the same extent. Second, the distance between the nucleotide phosphates and the imidazole ring of the histidine will be greater than that of the amino group of lysine. It is likely that the distance is more of an issue, because K359R PV is stable and K359R RdRp exhibits the same reduction in catalytic efficiency as K359H RdRp [7] .

One possible explanation for this outcome is that the RdRp is encoded by the 3D region of the viral genome and this region is also a component of the PV 3CD protein. The 3CD protein has well established roles in aspects of the lifecycle before, during, and after replication, including virion morphogenesis [29, 42, 50, 51] .

An unexpected outcome of this study was the observation that IF-KH and PS-KH PVs exhibit substantially different propensities for recombination in cells ( Figure 3B ), in spite of very similar speed and fidelity phenotypes in cells (Figures 1C and 2C ) and in vitro ( Figure 2D ). PS-KH PV appeared to be completely incapable of supporting recombination in cells ( Figure 3B ). Because the cell-based recombination assay requires the ability of virus to plaque, it was conceivable that the defect of PS-KH PV was more a reflection of virus spread than impaired recombination. We established a more sensitive fluorescence-based assay ( Figure 3C ), which also indicated impaired recombination ( Figure 3D ). The impact of the PS substitution on recombination was also quite evident in the context of IF-PS-KH PV. The biological and biochemical properties of this triple mutant are within twofold of wild type (Figures 1 and 2) , but the recombination efficiency of this mutant is down by 30-fold relative to WT PV ( Figure 3B ). Together, these observations support the existence of biochemical properties of the RdRp other than speed and fidelity that are essential for recombination and impaired by changing Pro-356 to Ser. Further characterization of these mutants will be required to identify this undefined biochemical property.",

We have shown that the high poly (rU) polymerase activity of PV RdRp derives from template switching during elongation, thus mimicking copy-choice recombination ( Figure 4A ) [32] . A second assay that we developed is based on template switching from the end of template, thus mimicking forced-copy-choice recombination ( Figure 5A ) [23, 45] . Based on the mutants and corresponding RdRp derivatives reported here, high fidelity impairs both types of recombination (see K359H in Figures 4B and 5D) . Interestingly, unique RdRp determinants exist for each mode of recombination. PS-KH RdRp is impaired for copy-choice recombination ( Figure 4B ); IF-KH is impaired for forced-copy-choice recombination ( Figure 5D ). Impairment of recombination by PS-KH PV in cells is consistent with template switching as the primary mechanism of copy-choice recombination in cells, as demonstrated by Kirkegaard and Baltimore [44] . The observation that IF-KH PV fails to exhibit a wild-type recombination phenotype ( Figure 3B ) may suggest that forced-copy-choice recombination contributes to recombination in cells as well.",

            "text": "The current narrative of the characterized PV mutants impaired for recombination is that recombination acts as a mechanism to purge deleterious mutations in the viral population [52] [53] [54] . Our study reveals several caveats for the interpretation of these previous studies. There are known and unknown biochemical properties of the RdRp that determine recombination efficiency, and there are at least two distinct mechanisms of recombination. Without understanding the biochemical properties of the mutants under investigation, it is difficult to compare one study to another that may explain disparate observations made between laboratories [30, 55] . Further analysis of the panel of mutants reported here may help to resolve the controversy but should illuminate how changes to the mechanism and efficiency of recombination impact viral evolution in a background of constant speed and fidelity. Viral fitness, virulence, and pathogenesis are determined collectively by the structure, dynamics, and activity of all virus-encoded functions. The conserved structure, dynamics, and mechanism of the viral RdRp makes this enzyme an attractive target for development of attenuated viruses by changing conserved residues capable of perturbing conserved, biochemical function [7, 9, 11] . As a field, we have focused on RdRp fidelity [7] but have come to the realization that RdRp speed should not be ignored [18] . This study shows that speed, fidelity, and undefined biochemical properties of the RdRp exist and contribute to both the mechanism and efficiency of recombination ( Figure 6 ). This inextricable connection of the myriad biochemical properties of the RdRp precludes attribution of a single biochemical property to viral fitness, virulence, and pathogenesis ( Figure 6 ). The field will be served best by continued emphasis on discovery of manipulatable functions of the RdRp, and other viral enzymes, instead of debating the importance of individual properties. not be ignored [18] .

The field will be served best by continued emphasis on discovery of manipulatable functions of the RdRp, and other viral enzymes, instead of debating the importance of individual properties. . The biochemical properties of the RdRp are inextricably linked and collectively determine biological outcomes. PV RdRp is among the most extensively studied enzyme both in cells and in test tubes [5] . A vast majority of these studies have emphasized elaboration of mechanisms governing efficient incorporation of nucleotides (speed) with high specificity (fidelity). Whether or not speed is a consequence of fidelity, vice versa, or completely separable is not clear [18, 43, [56] [57] [58] . However, these two parameters are linked to recombination efficiency. Moreover, the studies reported herein point to the existence of a biochemical property other than speed and fidelity, referred to here as undefined, that contributes to recombination efficiency. Together, the observations reported herein demonstrate that the current state of the art precludes association of a single biochemical property to viral fitness, virulence, and/or pathogenesis.

PV RdRp is among the most extensively studied enzyme both in cells and in test tubes [5]. A vast majority of these studies have emphasized elaboration of mechanisms governing efficient incorporation of nucleotides (speed) with high specificity (fidelity). Whether or not speed is a consequence of fidelity, vice versa, or completely separable is not clear [18,43,56-58]. However, these two parameters are linked to recombination efficiency. Moreover, the studies reported herein point to the existence of a biochemical property other than speed and fidelity, referred to here as undefined, that contributes to recombination efficiency. Together, the observations reported herein demonstrate that the current state of the art precludes association of a single biochemical property to viral fitness, virulence, and/or pathogenesis.",
