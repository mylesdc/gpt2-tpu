The paper is well written, sample size is appropriate and conclusions are supported by the results. I only have minor suggestions. I think Table 2 is a bit difficult to follow. When I read \"positive rate\" I think about N+/total number of test (while here it is over the N of positives or the N of negatives with the reference methodcolumns 6 and 7). I think rephrasing the captions for columns 6 and 7 and/or including a note with the used formulas will greatly increase the readability of the table (e.g. something like \"Luminex sensitivity",
