A detection rate of 2-3% was recorded for mycoplasma pneumonia, adenoviruses, human parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and human metapneumovirus (HMPV). ILIs cases were reported throughout the year, however, influenza, RSV, and HMPV exhibited strong seasonal peaks in the winter, while HRVs circulated more during fall and spring. Elderly (>50 years) had the lowest rates of influenza A (13.9%) and B (4.2%), while presenting the highest rates of RSV (3.4%) and HMPV (3.3%).

A standardized ILI case definition according to the WHO was strictly followed, which defines ILI as fever \ufffd38\u02daC and cough or sore throat with onset within the last 10 days [12] . For viral detection, specimens from throat swabs (oropharyngeal), nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs, and nasal aspirate were collected. In addition, sputum samples were collected for follow-up analysis from patients who were identified with confirmed Middle East Respiratory Syndrome virus (MERS CoV) infection. All specimens were collected in viral transport medium, stored at 4\u02daC, and sent to the virology laboratory of Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC) for testing.",

Several other respiratory pathogens including human rhinoviruses (HRVs), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), adenoviruses, enteroviruses, and human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are associated with the development of ARIs [2] .

On the other hand, winter is cooler with occasional rainfalls. The weather during spring and autumn is usually warm during the days and cooler at nights. Importantly, there are occasional drops in the temperature during cool months with heavy fog conditions. This could affect the respiratory mucosa and increase individuals' susceptibility to infections. Also, it is known that cold temperatures facilitate the survival and spread of viruses more easily [13] . Another feature of cold months is that schools are open at that time, which also contribute to infections spread. Accordingly, we investigated the patterns of seasonality of all the tested viruses to understand the temporal circulation of respiratory pathogens. In general, our data indicated that influenza and other respiratory pathogens exhibit strong seasonal peaks. Both, the number of reported ILI cases and the rate of positive results increased significantly during cooler months (Fig 2) . Over the six-year study period, the highest number of received samples was recorded during the winter between December and February (31.3%), followed by fall months between September and November (29%).

These findings are consistent with similar epidemiological studies conducted on adults in other countries. HRVs were also the second leading cause of ILIs in a three-year Chinese study between 2005-2007, where the virus was detected in 6.5% of patients above 14 years of age (total number = 5808 cases). All other remaining viruses were detected with a frequency less than 5% [18] . However, higher percentages of HRVs and RSV were reported from studies where younger participants were included [3, 15] . Although it is known that parechovirus may contribute to ILIs, only limited reports investigated their epidemiological characteristics among ILI patients [21] . In the current study, parechovirus infections were the lowest amongst other viruses, with only 44 positive cases reported in all the six surveillance years. In fact, low rate of parechovirus infections is typically observed in adults compared to children, where these infections are more frequent [22] . Earlier seroprevalence studies showed that over 90% of children are exposed to parechovirus before the age of two years [23] . It is therefore possible that the low rate of parechovirus-associated ILIs in adults is attributed to the presence of sterilizing immunity that confers protection and limits the infection severity, and thus, decreases the number of hospital visits among adult patients. Analysis of the viruses' subtypes revealed that parainfluenza type 3 was the most common detected type, representing 45.7% of all PIV positive cases, which in accordance with previous studies [24, 25] . Among those positive for CoVs, type OC43 was the most prevalent type (36.5%), similar to reports from Thailand [26] , Cameron [3] , Hong Kong [27] and others [28] .",

Moreover, we found that RSV and HMPV overlapped the peak of influenza, as previously described [31] . No clear temporal patterns were observed with CoVs infections, as well as adenoviruses, HPIV, enteroviruses, and parechovirus, and this is probably due to their low infection rates.

            "text": "Studying the prevalence and spread of infections within different age groups in Qatar, and the GCC countries in general, is extremely important, due to the uniqueness of this region's population. Qatar population is mainly composed of individuals between the age of 15 and 60 years, due to the importation of massive labor force from this age group. The current median age of Qatar residents is approximately 33.22 years [32] , while the average age is about 41.7 years [33] . Importantly, many of expatriates work in groups at construction sites and live in labor accommodations, facilitating the continuous transmission of infections within this age group specifically. In our study, influenza A viruses were more detected among patients aged between 31 and 40 years, while younger adults (15-30 years) had higher rates of influenza B virus. On the other hand, individuals aged above 50 years had significantly lower infection rates of both influenza types. It is well recognized that elderly are more susceptible to serious complications of influenza, which could require medical intervention or even hospitalization. However, this age group was the least affected in this study. In fact, multiple other studies from India, Canada, Japan and UK showed similar results, in which young adults presented higher rates of pandemic H1N1 infections compared to older age groups [34] [35] [36] [37] . Moreover, in a study from the US that estimated the relative risk (RR) for influenza hospitalizations (between 2009 and 2014) in different age groups indicated that individuals <50 years had the smallest RR, while adults aged between 18 and 49 had the highest RR [38] . One of the explanations is that young individuals have higher transmission rates compared to elderly [38] . In addition, age-stratified sero-epidemiological studies suggests that elderly are more likely to have a protective neutralizing response to the virus, which probably contributes the lower rates of infection observed in some regions [39] .",

Confirming others observations [18, 40] , we found significantly elevated rates of RSV (3.4%), HMPV (3.3%), and HPIV-3 (1.7%) among patients above 50 years old. On the other hand, HRVs, M. pneumonia, and adenoviruses infections inversely correlated with age. These infections were mostly affecting younger adults between 15 and 30 years old (detection rates of 10.9%, 4.7%, and 3.2% respectively). Similarly, a previous study from Beijing reported the highest rates of HRVs from individuals between 14 and 25 years old [18] .",

Expectedly, ratios of male subjects in this study were higher than females all over the study period. We explored the gender-dependent differences in infections rates. We found that males had significantly higher rates of HRVs and enteroviruses. On the hand, females showed strong correlation with high rates of influenza, RSV, HPIVs and HMPV infections. This supports previous reports highlighting the contribution of gender differences in influencing infection incidence and severity [41] . While the frequencies of non-MERS CoVs were almost similar among males and females, MERS CoV infection was significantly higher among male subjects (67%). This complies with the WHO report stating that 65% of MERS cases occurred among males [42] . This gender disparity can be attributed to the limited contact of females with camels. Although women might occasionally visit camel farms or consume camel products, but unlike men, they do not attend camels' races, nor visit slaughterhouses [43] . Therefore, they have less chances of being exposed to the virus. This study has some limitations. First, the surveillance data are limited to the symptomatic ILI cases. Patients who did not have the standard ILI symptoms according the WHO ILI case definition were not included. Therefore, the actual burden of respiratory infections could be underestimated. Importantly, around 53% of all samples were negative for the tested pathogens, indicating the circulation of other etiological agents that could lead to similar disease manifestations. Moreover, there were no information about the vaccination record of the enrolled patients, which prevented further analysis on vaccine coverage and efficacy in the studied population.",

It is the largest scale investigation of ILIs in adults in the MENA region, and thus, shall have important implications on infections' control and prevention policies. Although the weather in Qatar is generally hot throughout the year, seasonality and patterns of respiratory infections seems similar to what have been reported in different climate regions. Although influenza viruses are the leading cause of ILI in the country, other respiratory viruses still play a major role in the etiology of acute respiratory infections in Qatar. Results from this study would help in: 1. Improving vaccination timing through understanding viruses' seasonality; 2. Promoting the vaccination campaigns to prioritize high-risk groups with higher infection burden; and 3. Standardizing the diagnosis procedures by prioritizing the testing for pathogens of significant clinical and epidemiological impact.",
