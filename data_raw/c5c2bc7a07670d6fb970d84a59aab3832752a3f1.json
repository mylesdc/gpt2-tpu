Here we examined the contribution of ERK1/2 in early steps of JUNV and TCRV multiplication. JUNV adsorption, internalization, and uncoating were not affected by treatment of cultured cells with U0126, an inhibitor of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway. In contrast, U0126 caused a marked reduction in viral protein expression and RNA synthesis, while JUNV RNA synthesis was significantly augmented in the presence of an activator of the ERK1/2 pathway. Moreover, U0126 impaired the expression of a reporter gene in a TCRV-based replicon system, confirming the ability of the compound to hinder arenavirus macromolecular synthesis. By using a cell-based assay, we determined that the inhibitor did not affect the translation of a synthetic TCRV-like mRNA. No changes in the phosphorylation pattern of the translation factor eIF2\u03b1 were found in U0126-treated cells. Our results indicate that U0126 impairs viral RNA synthesis, thereby leading to a subsequent reduction in viral protein expression. Thus, we conclude that ERK1/2 signaling activation is required for an efficient arenavirus RNA synthesis.",

The L segment codes for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) and the small matrix protein (Z), while the S segment encodes the nucleocapsid protein (N) and a glycoprotein precursor (GPC). Some members of this family cause hemorrhagic fever disease in humans and represent an important public health concern in their endemic regions, such as Lassa and Lujo viruses in Africa, Sabi\u00e1 virus in Brazil, Guanarito virus in Venezuela, Chapar\u00e9 and Machupo viruses (MACV) in Bolivia, and Jun\u00edn virus (JUNV) in Argentina [1, 2] . JUNV is the etiological agent of Argentine hemorrhagic fever (AHF), with the administration of immune plasma being the only therapeutic intervention against the disease. Alternative antiviral therapies are needed due to troubles in maintaining adequate stocks of plasma and the absence of effective interventions for treated patients that progress to a neurologic-hemorrhagic phase [3, 4] . The development and implementation of a vaccination program within the endemic area, based on the live attenuated Candid #1 vaccine, has markedly reduced the incidence of AHF. Nevertheless, Candid #1 is not recommended for children and pregnant women and although this vaccine showed partial cross-protection for the arenavirus MACV, it has only been approved in Argentina [5] .",

            "text": "It is well established that viruses manipulate cell signaling machinery for their own benefit. Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), families of serine/threonine kinases that respond to extracellular stimuli, transduce signals from the cell membrane to the nucleus, playing important roles in the replication of several RNA and DNA viruses [6] [7] [8] . The best-known MAPK families are the extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), associated with growth or proliferation signals and the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 pathways, which are involved in the response to environmental and inflammatory stress. The main components of the ERK1/2 cascade are three sequentially acting kinases: Raf, MEK1/2 and ERK1/2. Activated ERK1/2 MAPKs not only translocate to the nucleus where they phosphorylate transcription factors triggering changes in gene expression but also mediate the phosphorylation of several cytoplasmic substrates. In addition, ERK1/2 pathway plays a relevant role in the replication of several viruses and the regulation of innate immune response against viral infections [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . Based on that, inhibition of the ERK1/2 pathway has been proposed as a novel antiviral strategy [9, 21, 22] .",

            "text": "Clade B New World (NW) arenaviruses, including JUNV and TCRV, can use transferrin receptor to bind to the cell surface allowing viral internalization through an endocytic pathway. Once viral particles are internalized, the acidic pH in endosomal compartments triggers the fusion between viral and endosomal membranes leading to the release of viral nucleocapsids into the cytoplasm [2, 32] . Since we have previously proved that JUNV infection induces an early activation of the ERK pathway [23] we wondered whether MAPKs may be involved in the initial events of viral multiplication cycle. Therefore, we first analyzed the effect of the MEK inhibitor U0126 on JUNV adsorption. As shown in Figure 1a , the presence of U0126 did not affect the amount of JUNV infectious particles adsorbed to Vero cells after 1 h incubation at 4 \u2022 C. To investigate the effect of the inhibitor on viral internalization, after JUNV adsorption, cultures were incubated at 37 \u2022 C for different time periods in presence or absence of U0126 or chlorpromazine (CZ), an inhibitor of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Whereas CZ blocked JUNV endocytic uptake, no significant differences in the kinetics of JUNV internalization were detected in U0126 treated cultures with respect to untreated ones (Figure 1b) . In order to assess whether inhibition of MEK affects viral uncoating, JUNV was adsorbed at 4 \u2022 C and then cells were transferred to 37 \u2022 C. At different time points, either U0126 or NH 4 Cl, compounds that raise endosomal pH, thereby inhibiting the release of viral nucleocapsids, was added and maintained during 3 h, and uncoated viral particles were then quantified by plaque assay. As expected, NH 4 Cl significantly inhibits JUNV uncoating even when added at 80 min post-adsorption. On the contrary, the uncoating process was not affected by U0126 treatment (Figure 1c) . ",

            "text": "To further uncover the viral step/s at which ERK1/2 MAPKs are engaged, we first analyzed the effect of the time of U0126 addition on the expression of N protein. Infected cells were examined at 14 h p.i. in order to detect the level of viral protein accumulated along one cycle of viral multiplication. Lack of cytotoxicity of U0126 treatment was assessed by the MTT method ( Figure S1 ). Addition of the compound at 2 h p.i was associated with highly reduced levels of N expression. Likewise, a marked reduction in the amount of N was detected after addition of the inhibitor at 6 h p.i. (Figure 2a) . Consistently, cells treated with U0126 from 2, 6 or 10 h p.i., exhibited a significant reduction in extracellular virus yields with respect to untreated cells, with maximum inhibition also observed after addition of the compound at 2 h p.i (Figure 2b ). These results, which correlated with undetectable amounts of phosphorylated ERK (Figure 2a, upper panel) , indicate that ERK1/2 MAPKs are involved in a post-entry step affecting N expression and virus production. Next, we sought to evaluate the impact of MAPK activation on the expression and function of viral glycoproteins. GPC, the glycoprotein precursor, is cleaved by host proteases to produce a stable signal peptide (SSP), the receptor binding G1 and the transmembrane G2 subunit, which mediates the low pH-dependent fusion between the viral envelope and the endosomal membrane [33] . To analyze the effect of U0126 on both cytoplasmic and plasma membrane expression of viral glycoproteins, surface and total immunofluorescence assays were performed. As can be seen in Figure 3a ,b, U0126 similarly reduced the percentage of cells exhibiting either total or membrane fluorescence, indicating that the compound mainly affects the synthesis of JUNV glycoproteins rather than glycoprotein transport to the cell surface. Accordingly, when the ability of the glycoprotein complex to mediate low pH membrane fusion was evaluated in a well-established cell-cell fusion test [34] , a significant decrease in the number and size of syncytia was observed in U0126-treated cells as compared with untreated cultures (Figure 3c-e) . Overall, these results indicate that ERK1/2 MAPKs are required for the expression of both the nucleoprotein and the viral envelope glycoproteins.",

In this system, co-expression of the nucleoprotein N and the viral RNA polymerase L is sufficient to promote full-cycle RNA replication of TCRV S segment analogs. Thus, we investigated the action of the MEK inhibitor on the expression of a TCRV S genome analog (MG-FLUC), containing the FLUC reporter gene and the complete TCRV S RNA noncoding sequences (Figure 4c ). After treatment with U0126, FLUC expression was significantly reduced with respect to untreated cultures (Figure 4d) . Importantly, the blockade of the ERK1/2 pathway did not alter N protein expression levels in transfected cells (Figure 4e) indicating that protein expression from plasmids that constitute the replicon system was not affected by the presence of the MEK inhibitor. In addition, the lack of cytotoxicity of U0126 treatment in transfected BSR cells was also corroborated by the MTT method ( Figure S2 ). Altogether our results indicate that U0126 impairs the reporter gene expression from a TCRV S genome analog, further supporting that MAPKs display an important role in viral RNA synthesis. ; the complete S IGR, then the FLUC ORF in an antisense orientation, and the complete S genome 3 UTR; (d) BSR cells were plasmid-transfected to co-express TCRV N and L proteins along with the MG-FLUC RNA.

We used a virus-like mRNA that mimics the TCRV N mRNA and comprises the FLUC ORF flanked by the viral 5 and 3 UTRs (Figure 5a ) [29] .

Translation from the virus-or cell-like transcript was examined after transfection into BSR cells followed by treatment with U0126. Whereas expression of the cell-like mRNA was slightly decreased, virus-like mRNA translation levels in U0126 treated cultures did not significantly differ from those in untreated cells (Figure 5b) , suggesting that U0126-mediated inhibition of viral RNA synthesis from JUNV genome (Figure 4b) , or of FLUC expression from the S genome analog (Figure 4d ) did not rely on an adverse effect of the compound on viral mRNA translation.",

Thus, to analyze whether ERK1/2 inhibition could be linked to increased phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1, we sought to quantify the levels of phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1 upon treatment of JUNV infected Vero cells with U0126 for 12 h. In accordance with data previously reported [36] , in the absence of U0126, the levels of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation in JUNV-infected cells were comparable to those in uninfected cultures, as determined by Western blotting analysis. In addition, the inhibition of the ERK1/2 pathway did not induce changes in the amount of phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1 (p-eIF2\u03b1) either in uninfected or in JUNV infected cells ( Figure 6 ). These results support that the inhibition of viral protein expression and RNA synthesis observed in U0126 treated cultures would not be related to increased phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 in host cells.

            "text": "Although it has been well established that ERK1/2 signaling is involved in the multiplication of several animal viruses much remains to be understood about the specific role that this transduction cascade plays in the viral replicative cycle. In the present study, we analyzed the inhibitory effect of U0126, an inhibitor of MEK, a component of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway, on early events of JUNV multiplication. We proved that early activation of ERK signaling is not required for JUNV adsorption, internalization or uncoating (Figure 1 ). In contrast, treatment of infected cells with U0126 caused a marked suppression of viral protein and RNA production (Figures 2a, 3 and 4b) . On the other hand, JUNV RNA synthesis was significantly augmented in the presence of an activator of the ERK1/2 pathway (Figure 4b ). These findings were strongly supported by the analysis of the effect of U0126 on a TCRV-based reverse genetic system (Figure 4d) . A cell-based translation assay revealed that translation of a TCRV-like mRNA remains unaffected in the presence of U0126 (Figure 5b) , providing further evidence that the inhibitor would impair viral RNA synthesis thereby leading to a subsequent reduction in viral protein expression. Despite the lack of significant inhibitory effect of U0126 on virus-like mRNA translation, translation of the cell-like mRNA appeared to be moderately reduced in cells treated with the MEK inhibitor ( Figure 5b ). However, this minor adverse effect would not seem to be relevant for cell translation efficiency. Indeed, the levels of viral proteins expressed in the context of the replicon system, or ERK levels in infected cells, were unaffected by the MEK inhibitor (Figures 4e and 6a) . ERK1/2 pathway not only regulates cellular gene transcription but also exerts a post-transcriptional control of certain mRNAs, such as AU-rich element (ARE) containing mRNAs, which encode for a variety of proteins involved in cell proliferation and inflammatory/immune responses [37, 38] . Therefore, the possibility that U0126 may downregulate the translation of a subset of cellular mRNAs without affecting the expression of other transcripts, including the N protein transcript, cannot be ruled out. Moreover, we demonstrated that U0126 treatment did not promote an increment in the amount of phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1, regardless of virus infection ( Figure 6 ). In summary, our data reveal that the U0126-induced inhibition is independent of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation and that it is not linked to altered host translation levels, further supporting that ERK1/2 MAPKs play an important role in viral RNA synthesis.",

            "text": "A great deal of our knowledge about ERK1/2 pathway participation in the replication of RNA viruses comes from studies on influenza A (IVA) and B (IVB) viruses [15, 17, 40, 41] . The lack of effect of U0126 on early steps of JUNV multiplication is in agreement with data obtained by Marjuki et al. [41] in IVA infected cells. However, in contrast with our results, MEK inhibition did not affect the synthesis of IVA and IVB RNA but impaired the exportation of newly synthesized viral ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) from the cell nucleus to the cytoplasm hindering viral assembly [15, 17] . Even though ERK-mediated phosphorylation of NS1 IVA protein has been reported [42] the requirement of NS1 phosphorylation for RNP transport from the nucleus to the cytoplasm has not been demonstrated. In addition, it has been proposed that a host cell factor, regulated by ERK phosphorylation, might be involved in the exportation of IV RNPs [17] . Analysis of JUNV N amino acid sequence, using PhosphoMotif Finder program, revealed that JUNV nucleoprotein contains three potential ERK1/2-mediated phosphorylation motifs. It was previously demonstrated that self-association between N protein molecules, as well as the interaction between N and L proteins, are required to sustain transcription and replication of TCRV MG RNA [26, 43] . Therefore, either direct phosphorylation by ERK or ERK-regulated phosphorylation of N might be relevant for the formation and/or activity of viral protein complexes that carry out viral RNA synthesis. Hence, blocking ERK signaling might hinder N phosphorylation thereby inhibiting JUNV genome replication. Indeed, two residues in the nucleoprotein of the arenavirus lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), which are conserved in every mammalian arenavirus, were demonstrated to be required for recombinant LCMV recovery, suggesting their involvement in regulation of viral RNA replication [44] . Besides the requirement of a coordinated interaction between N, L and viral RNA, arenavirus RNA synthesis likely involves interactions with host cell factors [45] . Prohibitin (PHB), one of the upstream components of the ERK1/2 pathway, has been proved to interact with JUNV and LCMV N protein [46] and it has been recently proved that a PHB inhibitor, rocaglamide, impaired LCMV RNA synthesis [45] . Moreover, JUNV multiplication was also inhibited by rocaglamide providing further evidence of the relevance of the ERK1/2 pathway activation on arenavirus RNA synthesis [45] . Thus, yet unknown cellular proteins, possibly as part of viral transcriptase/replicase complexes may be targets of or regulated by ERK1/2-mediated phosphorylation.",

Mean normalized FLUC values (FLUC/RLUC \u00b1 SD) from two independent experiments (each performed in triplicate) are shown. ANOVA (Tukey post-hoc test): *** p < 0.001.",
