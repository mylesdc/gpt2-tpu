In the course of bacterial infections, these cytokines could be beneficial or detrimental. IFN-b is the primary member of type I IFN that initiates a cascade of IFN-a production. Here we addressed the question which cells are responsible for IFN-b expression after infection with the intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes by using a genetic approach. By means of newly established reporter mice, maximum of IFN-b expression was observed at 24 hours post infection in spleen and, surprisingly, 48 hours post infection in colonized cervical and inguinal lymph nodes. Colonization of lymph nodes was independent of the type I IFN signaling, as well as bacterial dose and strain. Using cell specific reporter function and conditional deletions we could define cells expressing LysM as the major IFN-b producers, with cells formerly defined as Tip-DCs being the highest. Neutrophilic granulocytes, dendritic cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells did not significantly contribute to type I IFN production.",

            "text": "Interferons (IFN) were first discovered over 50 years ago by Isaacs and Lindenmann [1] . Due to its complexity, the IFN system is still little understood and remains a subject of intensive research. Currently, three types of IFNs are distinguished -type I, type II consisting of only IFN-c, and the recently discovered type III also called IFN-l. Here, we will focus on type I IFN. This family of cytokines comprises a single IFN-b, more than 13 IFN-a, and several other less well characterized members [2, 3] . All these subtypes signal through a common cell surface receptor (IFNAR) to activate IFN-inducible genes that exert a wide range of effects central to innate and adaptive immunity [2] . As a rule, IFN-b is produced as the earliest of type I IFN initiating a cascade of IFN-a via autocrine and paracrine loops [4, 5] . In addition, during viral infections type I IFN may be induced in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) also named ''natural interferon producing cells''. Due to constitutive expression of the transcription factor IRF-7, pDCs are able to immediately produce large amounts of IFN-a [6] . Nonviral pathogens (i.e., bacteria, protozoa, fungi and helminthes) may also induce type I IFN. Interestingly, in contrast to viral infections where IFNs are normally protective, in non-viral infections IFN production might be defensive or deleterious [7, 8] .",

Cyclic diadenosine monophosphate (c-di-AMP), secreted by L. monocytogenes, might be one of the cytosolic activators of type I IFN [12] . In addition, lymphotoxin-a might be involved in the triggering of type I IFN responses [13, 14] and lymphotoxin b receptor was shown to be crucially involved in the controlling of Listeria monocytogenes infection [15] .",

To demonstrate the physiological relevance of IFN-b produced by the cell types mentioned above, we included mice homozygous for the conditional deletion and compared them with mice in which IFN-b was deleted in germ line.

Here we compared LO28 and EGDe, two commonly used strains of Listeria monocytogenes. First, we asked when and where type I IFN is induced. To address this question, we used a previously described IFN-b reporter mouse, which allows whole body in vivo imaging of IFN-b induction using firefly luciferase as a reporter [30] . Figure 1A shows induction of IFN-b in albino IFN-b +/Db-luc reporter mice after intravenous (i.v.) injection of Listeria monocytogenes LO28 and EGDe strains. At 24 hours post infection (p.i.), IFN-b induction occurred almost exclusively in the spleen. Interestingly, 48 hours p.i. a bright luminescent signal appeared in the cervical and in the inguinal lymph nodes, especially when using the LO28 strain. At this time, no production of IFN-b was detectable in the spleen any longer. Loss of the signal from the spleen 48 hours p.i. could be due to complete destruction of spleen together with the massive apoptosis of lymphocytes [32] . Quantitation of luciferase activity in the selected regions of interest (Fig. 1A , circles 1 and 2 for spleen and cervical lymph nodes, respectively) showed that LO28, induced a stronger signal compared to EGDe (Fig. 1B) , although colonization by bacteria was comparable (Fig. 1C) . This confirmed the findings by Reutterer et al. that LO28 is the most potent type I IFN stimulator amongst the commonly used Listeria strains [31] . Of note, there was no significant signal from the liver at any time point, although this organ is highly colonized by Listeria.",

L. monocytogenes was shown after intragastric administration to activate pDCs in spleen and in mesenteric lymph nodes as detected by an increased expression of MHC II and CD86 [36] . By extrapolation, a contribution of pDC to the type I IFN response after systemic Listeria infection could be expected, although in vitro stimulation of splenic pDC with Listeria did not induce type I IFN [28] . To evaluate the contribution of pDC to the overall IFN production in vivo after Listeria monocytogenes infection, we performed depletion experiments. To this end, 24 hours prior to infection mice were intravenously injected with the depleting antibody anti-mPDCA-1. 24 hours p.i. spleens were analyzed for the presence of pDCs.

Therefore, we sorted CD11b + CD11c 2 macrophages, CD11c + CD11b 2 dendritic cells (DCs), CD11b + CD11c int Ly6C + Tip-DCs and B220 + CD11c 2 B cells as a negative control from IFN-b +/floxb-luc x LysMcre mice 24 hours after Listeria infection and tested for LysM, LysMcre as well as IFN-b expression by RT-PCR. A strong signal was observed for LysM in Tip-DCs and macrophages and, to a lesser extent, in dendritic cells (Fig. 8) . Cre recombinase was expressed in macrophages and in Tip-DCs, but not in DCs. IFN-b mRNA was highly pronounced in Tip-DCs and weakly in DCs. Faint bands were also detectible for IFN-a in these cells. In contrast, CD11b + CD11c 2 macrophages failed to produce any detectable amount of IFN-b or IFN-a.

Besides, macrophages play a major role in the early innate defense against Listeria monocytogenes via secretion of different cytokines [20, 56] . However, DCs were also observed to be directly infected by L. monocytogenes [57] . Since IFN induction requires intracellular Listeria, we would have expected that DCs, in addition to monocytes/macrophages, would be involved in IFN-b production. This is apparently not the case, because i) only negligible amounts of IFN-b are produced in infected mice, in which IFN-b is conditionally deleted by LysMcre. This also excludes a major contribution of a non-lymphoid tissue associated cell. ii) Similar amounts of reporter luciferase are produced in the global reporter mice and in the mice reporting production of IFN-b by monocytes/macrophages and neutrophilic granulocytes. Although LysMcre is supposed to be expressed by a small population of DCs [44] , CD11ccre mice experiments confirm that conventional DCs do not significantly contribute to IFN-b production. We also could exclude the contribution of pDC. The depletion of this cell population had no effect on the overall production of type I IFN. This extends the in vitro data of Stockinger et al. [28] to the in vivo situation. Finally, the involvement of neutrophils that are expressing LysMcre was also excluded by a depletion experiment.",

Our data showed that a LysM-expressing cell population is responsible for IFN-b production in murine listeriosis. Testing sorted macrophages, DCs and Tip-DCs for type I IFN and LysM expression revealed that the LysM promoter was active in all three cell populations. However, only Tip-DCs were able to express vast amounts of IFN-b in agreement with Dresing et al. [29] . Interestingly, such Tip-DCs showed strong expression of LysM. This sheds some doubts on the DC nature of Tip-DCs, which was originally defined by their T cell priming capacity in mixed lymphocyte reaction [29] .

Here we have shown that Listeria monocytogenes successfully colonizes cervical and inguinal lymph nodes also after i.v. infection. We noticed lymph node colonization due to the activation of the IFN-b reporter in such tissues. This impressively demonstrates the importance of using reporter systems that allow holistic unbiased observations. Colonization of lymph nodes could have taken place via dissemination of bacteria from the ''classical'' target organs spleen and liver. The delayed production of IFN-b in such organs would be in agreement with this notion. However, production of IFN-b correlated with the number of bacteria found in the colonized lymph nodes, which also showed a delayed increase.

As an isotype control, rat IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) was used. Successful depletion of pDCs and granulocytes was determined by FACS analysis 24 hours after infection. Figure S1 Overview of transgenic mice used in this work. The generation of the global IFN-b reporter mouse has been previously described [30] and is since then maintained independent of cre expression. In brief, the targeted locus contains a luciferase gene (dark blue arrow) with a preceding polyA signal (black box) to avoid unspecific reporter activity. Two loxP sites (black arrowheads) allow cre-dependent replacement of the ifnb coding sequence by the luciferase reporter (light blue arrow) which is then driven by the endogenous ifnb promoter. In all reporter mice we keep one wt ifnb allel to allow IFN-b expression. Tissue specific reporter mice were obtained from breeding IFN-b floxb-luc/floxb-luc mice with mice expressing cre (red arrow) in a cell type specific manner. Cre activity (light red) in the given cell population (within the red circle) then allows ifnb promoter dependent reporter activity while the reporter cannot be activated in cells without cre expression (dark red). Tissue specific knockout mice carry two cre dependent alleles. Therefore in cells expressing cre both ifnb coding sequences are deleted. However, in cells without cre expression the IFN-b production is normal despite the genomic alterations introduced into the locus. ",
