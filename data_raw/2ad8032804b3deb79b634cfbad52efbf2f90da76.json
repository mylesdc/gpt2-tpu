So far, there are no effective antivirals licensed to treat this virus. Here we describe the synthesis and antiviral activity evaluation of two compounds based on the quinoline scaffold, which has shown potential for the development of molecules with various biological activities. Two of the tested compounds showed dose-dependent inhibition of dengue virus serotype 2 in the low and sub micromolar range. The compounds 1 and 2 were also able to impair the accumulation of the viral envelope glycoprotein in infected cells, while showing no sign of direct virucidal activity and acting possibly through a mechanism involving the early stages of the infection. The results are congruent with previously reported data showing the potential of quinoline derivatives as a promising scaffold for the development of new antivirals against this important virus. Molecules 2018, 23, 672 2 of 11 antivirals might be very useful in the case of severe dengue, as high viremia has been shown to correlate with severity [7]. Quinolines are heterocyclic molecules composed of fused benzene and pyridine rings. The quinolines and their derivatives have shown a wide range of biological activities, including antiproliferative [8], antiviral [9], antibacterial [10], antifungal [11], anti-inflammatory [12], and antiparasitic [13]. Members of the quinoline family, such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, have shown antiviral activity against several viruses, such as coronaviruses [9], human immunodeficiency virus [14], and respiratory syncytial virus [15]. Concerning Flavivirus, quinoline derivatives have proved active against the Hepatitis C virus [16], West Nile virus [17,18], Japanese Encephalitis virus [19], Zika virus [20], and dengue virus [21].",

Using the TMEDA-catalyzed reaction, 2-alkylated quinolines 4 and 5 were isolated in 54 and 79% yields, respectively. Subsequent chlorination with N-chlorosuccinimide (NCS) under acidic conditions afforded the desired quinolines 1 and 2 in 78 and 80% yields, respectively Scheme 1 and Supplementary Materials). The final purity of both compounds 1 and 2 was verified to be higher than 97%.",

Several methods have recently been developed to prepare substituted quinolines from the unsubstituted precursors [23, 24] . We found that a modification of our recently developed N,N,N\u2032,N\u2032tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA)-catalyzed synthesis of 2-substituted quinolines [25] provided optimal yields and purity of quinolines 4 and 5 from 8-hydroxyquinoline N-oxide (3), although the copper-catalyzed reaction of Grignard reagents [26] gave similar results (Scheme 1). Using the TMEDA-catalyzed reaction, 2-alkylated quinolines 4 and 5 were isolated in 54 and 79% yields, respectively. Subsequent chlorination with N-chlorosuccinimide (NCS) under acidic conditions afforded the desired quinolines 1 and 2 in 78 and 80% yields, respectively Scheme 1 and Supplementary Materials). The final purity of both compounds 1 and 2 was verified to be higher than 97%. A total of 29 compounds, derivatives of the quinoline scaffold and related compounds (Table  S1 , Supplementary Materials), were tested at the prescreening stage, where both antiviral activity and cytotoxicity were assayed at a single concentration point of 30 \u00b5M (data not shown). Most of the tested compounds at the prescreening step either did not show inhibition against DENV2 or displayed evident cytotoxicity (data not shown).

Means of each group were compared to virus controls (100%) using one-sample t-tests as implemented in Graphpad Prism v5.0. Statistically significant difference was considered if p < 0.05. Half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC 50 ) and half maximal cytotoxic concentrations (CC 50 ) were calculated by fitting a nonlineal regression model to the data (four parameters logistic, variable slope model) as implemented in Graphpad Prism. Selectivity index (SI) was calculated as the ratio CC 50 /IC 50 .",

A solution of 2-isobutylquinolin-8-ol (5) (80 mg, 0.4 mmol) N-chlorosuccinimide (107 mg, 0.8 mmol) in 96% sulfuric acid (1.5 mL) was stirred at room temperature for 16 h. The reaction mixture was neutralized with saturated sodium carbonate and extracted with EtOAc (3 \u00d7 10 mL). The organic phase was combined, dried over anhydrous Na 2 SO 4 , and concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude product was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel (EtOAc/hexane, 1:100 v/v) to give 5,7-dichloro-2-isobutylquinolin-8-ol(2)(86 mg, 80%) as a light-yellow solid.-mp 52-55 \u2022 C.-1 H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl 3 ): 8.71-8.11 (1 H, m), 7.40-7.35 (1 H, m), 7.40-7.35 (1 H, m), 2.93-2.79 (1 H, m), 2.29-2.12 (1 H, m), 0.96 (1 H, dd, J = 6.6, 1.1 Hz) ppm.-13 C NMR (125 MHz, CDCl 3 ): 162.1, 147.3, 138.2, 133.5, 127.3, 123.7, 123.4, 120.7, 115.0, 47.6, 29.3, 22.6 ppm.-IR: 3360, 2955, 2868, 1595, 1496, 1449, 1391, 1349, 1323, 1253, 1194, 1145.-HRMS calcd for C 13 H 13 Cl 2 NO: 270.0447, found 270.0446 [M + H + ].",
