            "text": "Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are associated with a variety of clinical presentations in children, but their role in disease remains uncertain. The objective of our prospective study was to investigate HCoVs associations with various clinical presentations in hospitalized children up to 6 years of age. Children hospitalized with acute bronchiolitis (AB), acute gastroenteritis (AGE), or febrile seizures (FS), and children admitted for elective surgical procedures (healthy controls) were included in the study. In patients with AB, AGE, and FS, a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab and blood sample were obtained upon admission and the follow-up visit 14 days later, whereas in children with AGE a stool sample was also acquired upon admission; in healthy controls a NP swab and stool sample were taken upon admission. Amplification of polymerase 1b gene was used to detect HCoVs in the specimens. HCoVs-positive specimens were also examined for the presence of several other viruses. HCoVs were most often detected in children with FS (19/192, 9 .9%, 95% CI: 6-15%), followed by children with AGE (19/218, 8.7%, 95% CI: 5.3-13.3%) and AB (20/308, 6.5%, 95% CI: 4.0-9.8%). The presence of other viruses was a common finding, most frequent in the group of children with AB (19/20, 95%, 95% CI: 75.1-99.8%), followed by FS (10/19, 52.6%, 95% CI: 28.9-75.6%) and AGE (7/19, 36.8%, 95% CI: 16.3-61.6%). In healthy control children HCoVs were detected in 3/156 (1.9%, 95% CI: 0.4-5.5%) NP swabs and 1/150 (0.7%, 95% CI: 0.02-3.3%) stool samples. It seems that an etiological role of HCoVs is most likely in children with FS, considering that they had a higher proportion of positive HCoVs results than patients with AB and those with AGE, and had the highest viral load; however, the co-detection of other viruses was 52.6%.",

            "text": "Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) consist of four species (HKU1, NL63, 229E, and OC43) and are associated with a wide variety of clinical presentations. In otherwise healthy children, HCoVs typically cause mild upper respiratory tract infections, whereas in premature infants and children with chronic underlying diseases they may cause severe lower respiratory tract infections such as pneumonia and bronchiolitis [1] [2] [3] [4] . However, the role of HCoVs in severe disease is unclear because they are frequently co-detected with other respiratory viruses, most often with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [4, 5] . Among four species of HCoVs, NL63 was found to be more frequently associated with croup than the other three species [6] [7] [8] , whereas NL63 and HKU1 were associated with bronchiolitis and wheezing [6, [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . Previous studies also suggested an association between HCoVs and involvement of the gastrointestinal and central nervous system. Almost half of patients with HCoVs respiratory infections report abdominal pain, emesis, and diarrhea [15] [16] [17] , and HCoVs were detected in some patients with symptoms/signs limited to the gastrointestinal tract. Infections with 229E and OC43 have been implicated in the development of various chronic neurologic disorders, including multiple sclerosis [18] ; OC43 was demonstrated in the cerebrospinal fluid of a child presumed to have acute disseminated encephalomyelitis [19] ; and HKU1 has been associated with febrile seizures [12] .",

Nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs and blood samples were obtained upon admission and at a follow-up visit 14 days after initial sampling. In children with AGE a stool sample was also acquired upon admission to hospital. In an individual patient only one sample from the particular source was taken at each of the two time points.

The proportion of positive results was the highest in children with FS (9.9%), followed by AGE (8.7%) and AB (6.5%), but the differences between the three groups were not statistically significant. HCoVs were more often detected in NP swabs of patients than in healthy controls (8.1% versus 1.9%, OR = 4.5, 95% CI: 1.4 to 14.5, P = 0.01). The same was valid also for all three clinical groups (FS, AGE, AB). Although these findings support the causal role of HCoVs in our patients, this role remained inconclusive due to frequent co-detection of other viruses. Namely, in 36 (62.1%) of the 58 HCoVs-positive NP samples other respiratory viruses were detected, most commonly RSV (22/36, 61 .1%). Within HCoVs NP swab-positive patients those with AB had the largest probability of being \"coinfected\" with other viruses (19/20, 95%), followed by FS (10/19, 52.6%) and AGE (7/19, 36 .8%). The fraction of \"co-infections\" established in our patients with FS and AGE is similar to that reported previously [12, 15-17, 33, 34] , whereas the proportion in children with AB is higher than in most other studies [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] . NP swab HCoVs estimated viral load was the highest in patients with FS (median Ct value 27.8), followed by AGE (median Ct value 29.5) and AB (median Ct value 33.5). Viral load in single HCoV \"infections\" was higher than in \"coinfections\" (median Ct values 27.5 versus 32, respectively; P = 0.09). This finding is in contrast to previous studies, in which no difference in viral load in single HCoV \"infections\" and \"coinfections\" was found [34] . Our findings suggest that in children with AB the presence of HCoVs in NP swabs is of minor importance and is most probably not causally related to AB because, among the three clinical groups, patients with AB had the lowest proportion of HCoV-positive NP swab results, very frequent \"co-infection\" with other respiratory viruses (95%), and very low viral load.",

These findings suggest that HCoVs play only a minor role in gastrointestinal illness in children under 6 years old and go in parallel with the results of a Finnish study, in which HCoVs were more commonly detected in NP swabs than in stool samples in children with AGE, children with respiratory infection, and the group with combined gastrointestinal and respiratory symptoms [40] .",

The presence of HCoVs and more frequent demonstration of these viruses in patients than in the control group of healthy children point toward an etiologic role of HCoVs. However, interpretation is complex. The causative role of HCoVs is most probably minor in children with AB and in patients with AGE but is more likely in children with FS, considering that they had a higher proportion of positive HCoVs results than patients with AB and those with AGE, and had the highest viral load; however, in half of the patients the co-detection of other viruses was established.",
