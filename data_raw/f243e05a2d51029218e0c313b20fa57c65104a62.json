            "text": "The 2014 outbreak of Ebola virus (EBOV) in Western Africa highlighted the need for anti-EBOV therapeutics. Clomiphene is a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug that blocks EBOV entry and infection in cells and significantly protects EBOV-challenged mice. As provided, clomiphene is, approximately, a 60:40 mixture of two stereoisomers, enclomiphene and zuclomiphene. The pharmacokinetic properties of the two isomers vary, but both accumulate in the eye and male reproductive tract, tissues in which EBOV can persist. Here we compared the ability of clomiphene and its isomers to inhibit EBOV using viral-like particle (VLP) entry and transcription/replication-competent VLP (trVLP) assays. Clomiphene and its isomers inhibited the entry and infection of VLPs and trVLPs with similar potencies. This was demonstrated with VLPs bearing the glycoproteins from three filoviruses (EBOV Mayinga, EBOV Makona, and Marburg virus) and in two cell lines (293T/17 and Vero E6). Visual problems have been noted in EBOV survivors, and viral RNA has been isolated from semen up to nine months post-infection. Since the clomiphene isomers accumulate in these affected tissues, clomiphene or one of its isomers warrants consideration as an anti-EBOV agent, for example, to potentially help ameliorate symptoms in EBOV survivors. 2 of 15 basis; these included the ZMapp cocktail of monoclonal antibodies [7, 8] , hyperimmune serum [9,10], and several low molecular weight anti-viral drugs [11] [12] [13] . Additional therapeutic antibodies [14] [15] [16] [17] have recently been described, and two novel low molecular weight viral RNA polymerase inhibitors are in development [18, 19] . A different approach has been to screen U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs for anti-EBOV activity, with the goal of repurposing an approved drug, or combination of approved drugs, for use as a prophylactic and/or therapeutic in the advent of a future outbreak [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . Clomiphene surfaced in two independent screens of FDA-approved drugs for anti-EBOV activity [20] [21] [22] ; it blocks EBOV entry and infection in tissue culture cells and provides up to 90% protection in the mouse model of EBOV disease [20, 21] . Clomiphene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator that is used to treat female infertility due to anovulation [25] [26] [27] . It was also proposed in 1991 as a drug to reverse impotence in men due to low testosterone levels [28] , and is currently used off-label for men with hypogonadism. We found, however, that clomiphene exerts its anti-EBOV activity in cell cultures irrespective of expression of the estrogen receptor alpha and/or beta subunits [20] . Instead, clomiphene likely exerts its anti-EBOV activity because it is a cationic amphiphilic drug [29] that accumulates in endolysosomes, the site of EBOV fusion and cytoplasmic entry [30] [31] [32] . Similar to other cationic amphiphilic drugs [29, 33] , clomiphene blocks a late step in the complex process by which the EBOV genome gains access to the host cell cytoplasm to initiate replication, most likely by blocking fusion between the EBOV and endolysosomal membranes [29] .",

Whereas enclomiphene exhibits high anti-estrogenic properties, zuclomiphene does not [34] [35] [36] . The two isomers also differ in other pharmacokinetic properties. For examples, zuclomiphene has a longer half-life in serum [37, 38] and persists in most tissues for longer periods of time than enclomiphene [39] . It could, therefore, be proposed that zuclomiphene is the major contributor to adverse side effects seen in individuals given clomiphene citrate and, conversely, that enclomiphene would impart fewer side effects [39, 40] . Due to these features, as well as its ability to raise testosterone levels, enclomiphene is currently in clinical development as a treatment for secondary hypogonadism (low testosterone levels) [41] .",

The cell medium was collected 24 and 48 h post-transfection and was cleared of cellular debris. VLPs in the cleared medium were pelleted through a 20% sucrose cushion by centrifugation, resuspended in HM buffer (20 mM HEPES, 20 mM MES, 130 mM NaCl, pH 7.4), and repelleted. The final VLP pellet was resuspended (1:100 starting volume of medium) in 10% sucrose-HM. The total protein concentration of the VLPs was determined by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay.

Their primary metabolites are 4-hydroxy-enclomiphene and, to a lesser extent, 4-hydroxy-zuclomiphene. We first compared the ability of clomiphene, enclomiphene, zuclomiphene, 4-hydroxy-enclomiphene, and 4-hydroxy-zuclomiphene to block EBOV using the trVLP life cycle modeling system described by Watt and Hoenen [42, 43] . As seen in Figure 1A , both isomers of clomiphene (enclomiphene and zuclomiphene) as well as the 4-hydroxy metabolites of each (4-hydroxy-enclomiphene, and 4-hydroxy-zuclomiphene) displayed dose-dependent inhibition of trVLP infection similar to that seen with the parent mixture (clomiphene) when cells were pretreated for 1 h with increasing concentrations of compound. At a dose of 5 \u00b5M, all five forms of clomiphene showed approximately equal potency, reducing the trVLP (Renilla luciferase) signal by approximately 1000-fold. Parallel sets of cells showed no evidence of cytotoxicity by any form of clomiphene ( Figure 1B ). Our previous findings indicated that clomiphene blocks EBOV infection by blocking entry of viral particles into the cell cytoplasm [20, 29] ; this effect appears to be at the level of fusion between the membrane of the viral particle and the limiting membrane of an Niemann-Pick disease, type C1 positive (NPC1 + ) endolysosome, the site of EBOV fusion [30] [31] [32] . We, therefore, compared the effects of clomiphene, enclomiphene, zuclomiphene, 4-hydroxy-enclomiphene, and 4-hydroxyzuclomiphene on EBOV entry using entry reporter VLPs, as described previously [20, 29, 30] . At a concentration of 5 \u03bcM, clomiphene, both of its isomers (enclomiphene and zuclomiphene), as well as the 4-hydroxy metabolite of each isomer blocked VLP entry (Figure 2A) , with no evidence of cytotoxicity ( Figure. 2B ).

In this system, 4-hydroxy-zuclomiphene appeared more potent than the other forms of clomiphene ( Figure 2A ), but this is likely an assay-dependent result, as 4-hydroxy-zuclomiphene was not more potent in the trVLP assay ( Figure 1A ). other forms of clomiphene ( Figure 2A ), but this is likely an assay-dependent result, as 4-hydroxyzuclomiphene was not more potent in the trVLP assay ( Figure 1A ).

Tragically, many of these survivors are displaying post Ebola virus disease syndromes, including visual problems, hearing loss, and excessive fatigue [3, 4] . In addition, infectious EBOV has been found in semen for up to six months [5] , raising concerns of sexual transmission [6] . Hence, drugs that accumulate in tissues of the eye and male reproductive tract could be particularly helpful for certain Ebola virus survivors. In this respect it is interesting that, in mice, both enclomiphene and zuclomiphene persist in the eye and male reproductive tract longer than in other tissues, with zuclomiphene maintained at higher levels than enclomiphene. Zuclomiphene was also found to persist in the brain, whereas enclomiphene was not [39] .",

The maximum serum concentration (C max ) for a 60 mg/kg dose (intra-peritoneal administration, IP) of clomiphene to female mice was 5.1 \u00b5M (Lisa Johansen, personal communication) and, hence, above the IC 50 for blockade of EBOV infection in tissue culture cells [20, 21] and above the IC 50 values reported here for clomiphene and its isomers in blocking EBOV VLP entry and trVLP infection ( Table 1 ). The standard dose of clomiphene to treat female infertility is 50 mg/day (per os). With this (oral) dose, reported C max values (summed for enclomiphene and zuclomiphene) range from 0.04 to 0.05 \u00b5M (Table 2) ,~50-60-fold below the IC 50 (2.4 \u00b5M in Vero E6 cells) for anti-EBOV activity [20, 21] . Therefore, for potential treatment of acute EBOV infections, higher doses of clomiphene would certainly be needed, likely in combination with other anti-EBOV drugs. The human equivalent dose (to the mouse dosing employed in [20] ) for an adult weighing 60 kg would be 292 mg clomiphene every other day [46] . In this respect it is noteworthy that higher doses of clomiphene (up to 250 mg/day) have been administered to non-responding (anovulating) females [47, 48] , and that considerably higher C max values were obtained when patients were administered the standard dose of clomiphene (50 mg), but by intravenous administration (IV) instead of the oral route (Table 2 ) [49] . Hence, it is conceivable that higher doses of clomiphene could be administered (perhaps as part of a cocktail) to treat acute EBOV infections.",

For example, enclomiphene and zuclomiphene accumulate~50-to~150-fold, respectively, in the Harderian gland (located in the orbit) and the uveal tract of the mouse eye. Similar accumulation of zuclomiphene was seen in tissues of the male mouse reproductive tract [39] . If such accrual occurs in humans, the standard dose (50 mgs per day, per os) of clomiphene, which contains both isomers, could be sufficient to reach anti-viral levels in the eye and male reproductive tract; the levels would more likely be sufficient if clomiphene were given at a higher dose and/or in combination with another anti-EBOV agent. Interestingly, no sperm were seen in the testes and epididymes of male mice treated for 90 days with 40 mg/kg/day of zuclomiphene [40] .",

It will, therefore, be interesting to compare the efficacies of the individual clomiphene isomers in the mouse model of EBOV infection. Studies on their relative efficacies in the eyes and reproductive tract will be especially revealing.

Hence we propose that clomiphene, an FDA-approved drug that provided up to 90% protection in the mouse model of Ebola virus disease, remain in consideration as an anti-EBOV agent, especially for the management of post Ebola virus disease syndromes, including visual problems and the risk of sexual transmission, and especially for consideration as part of a potential drug cocktail.",

After 18-24 h, the cells were treated with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (Mock, M) or with increasing concentrations (1, 2.5, 5, or 10 \u03bcM) of clomiphene (Clo), enclomiphene (En), zuclomiphene (Zu), 4-hydroxyenclomiphene (4-OH En) or 4-hydroxy-zuclomiphene (4-OH Zu) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. The cells were then infected in the presence of the indicated drug with 25 \u03bcL trVLPs and assayed 72 h later for Renilla luciferase activity. Data are averages of triplicate samples (cells only background subtracted).
