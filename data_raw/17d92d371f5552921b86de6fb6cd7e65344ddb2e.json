Since the infection spread to other regions through patients who moved to hospitals in other locations, people were also concerned about the spread of the infection to their communities. As the fear of visiting hospitals and concerns about the possibility of transmission to communities emerged, the outbreak resulted in a larger social impact than the H1N1 influenza outbreak that resulted in the infection of 15,160 people and 260 deaths in 2009.",

Similar studies, although limited, have been performed on people that were quarantined or medical staffs, following the MERS outbreak [12, 13] . Thus, in this study, we investigated perceived infection sensitivity among community residents and the level of preventive behaviors practiced during the 2015 outbreak of MERS in Korea. We also identified the characteristics of groups with high or low level of perceived sensitivity, by which we aimed to reveal the effect of perceived infection sensitivity on preventive behaviors.",

While perceived infection sensitivity also functions as a factor to increase the practice of preventive behaviors, there was no or little correlation between policy credibility and infection sensitivity in this study. In other words, policy credibility was determined by factors other than perceived infection sensitivity, and it was speculated that policy credibility affected the attitude towards preventive behaviors, independent of sensitivity.
