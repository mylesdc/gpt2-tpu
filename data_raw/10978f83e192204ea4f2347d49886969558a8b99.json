            "text": "Viral replicase recruitment and long-range RNA interactions are essential for RNA virus replication, yet the mechanism of their interplay remains elusive. Flaviviruses include numerous important human pathogens, e.g., dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV). Here, we revealed a highly conserved, conformation-tunable cis-acting element named 5 0 -UAR-flanking stem (UFS) in the flavivirus genomic 5 0 terminus. We demonstrated that the UFS was critical for efficient NS5 recruitment and viral RNA synthesis in different flaviviruses. Interestingly, stabilization of the DENV UFS impaired both genome cyclization and vRNA replication. Moreover, the UFS unwound in response to genome cyclization, leading to the decreased affinity of NS5 for the viral 5 0 end. Thus, we propose that the UFS is switched by genome cyclization to regulate dynamic RdRp binding for vRNA replication. This study demonstrates that the UFS enables communication between flavivirus genome cyclization and RdRp recruitment, highlighting the presence of switch-like mechanisms among RNA viruses.",

These elements have been found to regulate viral replicase binding and viral RNA (vRNA) synthesis (Filomatori et al., 2006; Vogt and Andino, 2010; Wu et al., 2009) , nucleocapsid assembly (Goto et al., 2013; Keane et al., 2015; Morales et al., 2013) , and viral translation (Brierley and Dos Ramos, 2006; Kieft, 2008; Liu et al., 2009; Simon and Miller, 2013) . In particular, local RNA elements in viral genomes are often involved in long-range RNA-RNA interactions (Alvarez et al., 2005; Nicholson and White, 2014; Shetty et al., 2013) , which are often referred to as genome cyclization and can bring regions separated by several thousand nucleotides into proximity. Such strategies have been observed in different classes of RNA viruses and play different roles in virus propagation (Nicholson and White, 2014) . In fact, the entire genomes of some RNA viruses are highly structured and have complex global architecture (Athavale et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2013) .",

Major phylogenetic groups (Blitvich and Firth, 2015; Moureau et al., 2015) of flaviviruses include mosquito-borne flaviviruses (MBFVs), tick-borne flaviviruses (TBFVs), insect-specific flaviviruses (ISFVs) and flaviviruses with no known vectors (NKVs). Leading to diseases with symptoms ranging from mild fever and rash to severe hemorrhagic fever and encephalitis, the emergence and re-emergence of flaviviruses always arouses global concern. The flaviviruses are single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses, and their genome is approximately 11 kb and contains a single ORF, which encodes a polyprotein precursor with more than 3000 residues. The precursor is further processed into 3 structural proteins (capsid, pre-membrane/membrane and envelope) and at least 7 nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B and NS5). The largest nonstructural protein, NS5, performs methyltransferase (Egloff et al., 2002; Zhou et al., 2007) , guanylyltransferase (Issur et al., 2009 ) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity (Nomaguchi et al., 2003; Uchil and Satchidanandam, 2003; Yap et al., 2007) . NS5 interacts with vRNA, other viral nonstructural proteins and host factors to assemble to the viral replication complex essential for vRNA synthesis (Klema et al., 2015) . On the other hand, the highly structured 5 0 and 3 0 untranslated regions (UTRs) occupy the termini of the viral genome (Friebe and Harris, 2010; Gebhard et al., 2011; Villordo et al., 2016) and contain cis-acting elements crucial for vRNA replication (Clyde et al., 2008; Filomatori et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2013; Lodeiro et al., 2009; Rouha et al., 2011; Villordo et al., 2010) , translation (Chiu et al., 2005; Clyde and Harris, 2006) , viral pathogenesis (Chapman et al., 2014; Funk et al., 2010; Roby et al., 2014) and host adaptation .",

Genome cyclization, which is also modulated by the downstream of 5 0 CS pseudoknot (DCS-PK) in the capsid-coding region (de Borba et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2013) , is crucial for the translocation of NS5 from the 5 0 stem-loop A (SLA) promoter to the RNA synthesis initiation site at the 3 0 end (Filomatori et al., 2006) . However, the mechanistic details of this critical process are poorly understood. The 5 0 SLA structure and genome cyclization strategy were also identified in other phylogenetic groups of the flavivirus genus, although the specific details differ. The 5 0 UAR element in MBFV usually participates in the formation of a local hairpin, stem-loop B (SLB), in the linear conformation of the vRNA. The SLA and SLB elements are separated by a short uracil-rich sequence, which has been shown to mediate vRNA replication of DENV (Lodeiro et al., 2009 ). In the present study, we demonstrated that the U-rich region of MBFV is involved in the formation of a conserved RNA duplex that is designated as a 5 0 -UARflanking stem (UFS) because it locks the 5 0 UAR/SLB element between its two strands. A combination of our results suggested that the UFS and its cousin elements regulate the binding of viral RdRp to eLife digest Flaviviruses include a large family of viruses that are harmful to human health, such as dengue virus, West Nile virus and Zika virus. Understanding the details of the life cycle of these viruses is important for better controlling and treating the diseases that they cause.",

To clarify the structural characteristics of the region downstream of SLA, representative sequences derived from various flavivirus species were subjected to the mfold RNA folding server (Zuker, 2003; Zuker and Jacobson, 1998) . Because the region of interest is involved in genome cyclization, both the 5 0 end sequences and the query sequences composed of the 5 0 and 3 0 ends were analyzed. Figure 1A shows the representative results of the RNA structure prediction. The local RNA structures in the 5 0 and 3 0 ends of DENV4 vRNA are demonstrated, and elements involved in long-range interactions are highlighted. Structure prediction of the 5 0 end local structures showed that the U-rich region of most MBFVs (except the YFV clade) forms a duplex with complementary sequences in or near the viral translational starting region ( Figure 1B ). Because this duplex confines the 5 0 UAR/ SLB element between its two strands, we designated it as the UFS. Furthermore, the UFS duplex was predicted to unwind due to the formation of the panhandle structure between the 5 0 and 3 0 ends when long-range interactions between the genome termini were considered (Figure 1-figure supplement 1 and Supplementary file 1).",

Local structures similar to UFS were also identified in ISFVs ( Figure 1B) and Modoc virus (MODV) among the NKVs ( Figure 1B) , whereas the non-vectored Rio Bravo virus (RBV, Figure 1B ) was shown to contain a yUFS structure. The UFS and yUFS in NKVs were also involved in genome cyclization, similar to the corresponding structures in MBFVs. In contrast, the UFS-like structures were not predicted to be involved in genome cyclization in ISFVs, suggesting that the UFS in MBFVs and UFS-like structures in ISFVs function differently. Finally, the UFS/yUFS structure was not identified in TBFVs or in the Yokose virus clade of NKVs; instead, a short hairpin with a large loop occupied the analogous location of the UFS in these viruses (Supplementary file 2). Taken together, the above results demonstrated the conservation of UFS elements among the flavivirus genus and suggested that the secondary structures of UFS elements are affected by genome conformation.",

The SHAPE reactivity data were annotated on RNA structure models generated by mfold prediction and sequence comparison ( Figure 2 ). The SHAPE results were shown to agree well with the predicted RNA structures. It was shown that the UFS element of JEV forms a conical duplex structure under in vitro conditions ( Figure 2A ) because all nucleotides of the UFS exhibited low SHAPE reactivity. Similar results were obtained for DENV serotypes 1, 3, 4 and ZIKV ( Figure 2B ,D,E and F), except that several nucleotides in the ZIKV and DENV1/3 UFS regions had elevated SHAPE reactivity, which was likely due to the presence of internal loops. In contrast, the SHAPE results indicated that the UFS duplex of DENV2 is highly unstable because the DENV2 UFS region showed considerable SHAPE reactivity ( Figure 2C ). This result was consistent with thermodynamic calculations and suggested that the UFS duplex is a highly dynamic structure, at least in some flaviviruses. The presence of the DENV UFS duplex conformation was further confirmed by SHAPE analysis of DENV3 5 0 end RNA molecules containing mutations in the UFS (Figure 2-figure supplement 1) . It was shown that the SHAPE The UFS duplex is critical for efficient vRNA replication The UFS is located just downstream of the SLA promoter element, and it interlocks with cyclization sequences in the vRNA 5 0 end. This peculiar localization of the UFS suggests a unique role in vRNA replication. Functional mutagenesis of the UFS was performed using a DENV4 replicon with internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-controlled viral translation (Liu et al., 2013) . To eliminate the possibility that productive 5 0 -cap-directed translation is caused by mutations altering the start codon (Clyde and Harris, 2006) , which is embedded in the DENV4 UFS duplex, a nonsense mutation was introduced into the variable loop 3 of DCS-PK in the background of p4-cHPstop-SP-IRES-Rluc-Rep to generate the p4-Dualstop-SP-IRES-Rluc-Rep replicon ( Figure 3A) . The replication characteristics of the two replicons were basically the same ( Figure 3B ). First, a panel of mutants was generated, and their replication efficiency was assessed in BHK-21 cells. Disrupting the base-pairing of the UFS Figure 3C ,D. M1A, M1B, M3A and M3B) greatly reduced vRNA replication, whereas reconstituting base-pairing by combining the corresponding mutations was able to restore vRNA replication ( Figure 3C ,D. M1C and M3C), although the M3C mutant replicated moderately less efficiently than the wild-type (WT) replicon, possibly due to the apparent primary sequence changes in the U-rich region. Next, the impact of the M1 and M3 mutations on the circularized vRNA structure was assessed using the mfold online server. It was shown that the overall genome cyclization pattern was only slightly affected by the M1 and M3 mutations (Supplementary file 3), and the changes in the stability of the predicted circularized structures was considerable smaller than the changes in the local UFS structure. To further confirm the function of local UFS structure in vRNA replication, we designed a panel of mutations (Figure 3-figure supplement 1), which nether affected vRNA cyclization pattern nor the internal loop structure in the circular form, and the corresponding mutants were assessed for replication efficiency. It was shown that disruption of UFS base pairing (mutant AGU and GAU) reduced vRNA replication greatly, whereas substituting of a few base pairs in the UFS (mutant AUA and ACG) only have moderate effects on vRNA replication.",

In WT RNA, nucleotides composing the UFS only showed low or background SHAPE reactivity, whereas the SHAPE reactivity of the UFS region increased significantly in the M1A and M3A mutants, suggesting that the UFS duplex was indeed disrupted by the corresponding mutations. In contrast, the M1C and M3C mutations greatly reduced the SHAPE reactivity of the UFS region. RNA structure predictions using the RNAstructure (Reuter and Mathews, 2010) software with SHAPE constraints confirmed that the UFS structure was disrupted/destabilized or reconstituted as aimed, and these mutations did not affect the overall secondary structure of the 5 0 end RNA (Supplementary file 4).

Only negligible differences in RNA stability were found between WT RNA and the mutants of the M1 or M3 groups ( Figure 5G ,H), and the stability of the M5C mutant was moderately reduced compared with that of the M5A mutant ( Figure 5I) . Thus, the differences in the RNA stability of the UFS mutants did not account for their different replication characteristics.

The 5 0 -300 nt M3A and M3B RNA also interacted with NS5Pol weakly, whereas the combination of the two mutations apparently restored the interaction between NS5Pol and 5 0 -300 nt M3C RNA ( Figure 6C , bottom panel). The above results indicated that the UFS duplex is required for efficient NS5Pol binding in DENV4.

Shortening the length of the internal loop to 1 nt or 2 nt did not affect vRNA replication greatly. In contrast, total deletion of the internal loop, which caused the SLB to stack onto the UFS, significantly reduced the vRNA replication efficiency (Figure 7 and Figure 7-figure supplement 1, L1D, L2D and L3D) . Moreover, replication assays performed for various purine-to-purine and purine-to-pyrimidine substituting mutations targeting the internal loop (Figure 7-figure supplement 1) suggested that the purine-rich properties of the internal loop are optimal for efficient DENV4 vRNA replication. Taken together, the above results demonstrated that the stability of the UFS duplex is a critical determinant for its function in vRNA replication.

We speculated that an overstabilized UFS duplex would be too difficult to unwind and would hinder 5 0 -3 0 UAR hybridization. To confirm this probability, a DENV4 5 0 -3 0 RNA binding assay was employed ( Figure 8A ). The M1A, , had little effect on the formation of 5 0 -3 0 complex. However, when the M2 series mutants were assayed, although the M2A and M2B mutations also did not influence the formation of 5 0 -3 0 RNA complex apparently, the complex formed by the 3 0 UTR and 5 0 -300 nt M2C RNA was greatly reduced compared to the amounts of complexes formed by the 3 0 UTR and other 5 0 -300 nt RNA species ( Figure 8B ). Estimation of dissociation constant (Figure 8-figure supplement 2) revealed that the Kd of 5 0 -300 nt M2C binding with 3 0 UTR is approximately ten fold higher than the Kds of the other 5 0 RNAs. These results together indicated that increasing the stability of the UFS hinders vRNA terminus interactions. Furthermore, the 5 0 -300 nt L3D mutant, in which the internal loop was deleted, also interacted with the 3 0 UTR poorly (Figure 8-figure supplement 1) .",

When the 5 0 :3 0 ratio was 1:1, the SHAPE reactivity of the UFS element in 5 0 -300 nt WT RNA exhibited a significant increase compared with the reactivity when the 3 0 UTR was absent, and the SHAPE reactivity of the SLB loop and 5 0 CS region was obviously reduced. When the 3 0 UTR was in 5-fold excess of 5 0 -300 nt RNA, the SLB loop region of WT 5 0 RNA showed essentially no SHAPE reactivity, indicating a complete transition from the SLB structure to a UAR duplex. In contrast, when the 5 0 -300 nt M2C RNA was incubated with an equal concentration of 3 0 UTR RNA, there were only minor changes in the SHAPE reactivity of the UFS and SLB loop regions compared with those of 5 0 -300 nt M2C RNA alone. When the 5 0 :3 0 ratio was 1:5, the SLB loop region of 5 0 -300 nt M2C RNA still showed moderate SHAPE reactivity. The above results demonstrated that the UFS duplex is melted when the 3 0 UTR binds to 5 0 end RNA, and stabilization of the UFS renders it difficult to unwind in response to the 3 0 UTR and thus hinders genome cyclization. Thus, although the UFS does not participate in 5 0 -3 0 hybridization directly, the stability of its secondary structure must be maintained below a threshold to enable the necessary conformational changes required for genome cyclization. It can be speculated that the unwinding of the UFS during genome cyclization may be important for its function in viral RNA synthesis.",

The DENV4 WT mini-genome and those containing the desired mutations were constructed ( Figure 10A) . First, using native PAGE, we found that the WT minigenome, as well as the M1A, M1B, M1C, M3A, M3B, M3C and M2A mini-genomes, existed mostly in a circularized conformation ( Figure 10B) , whereas the CS-M mutant, in which the 5 0 CS sequence was mutated, was confined to a linear conformation, as expected. The M2C mutant also mainly stayed in a linear conformation, agreeing with the results of the 5 0 -3 0 RNA binding assay. The above results demonstrated that these corresponding mini-genomes are highly circularized; thus, it is unlikely that the UFS duplex structure exists in them. Next, the affinity of different mini-genomes for The conformational equilibrium of mini-genome RNA containing different mutations was analyzed using native PAGE. The bands of the linear and circular conformations were identified using the CS-M mutant as a control. The faint and much larger bands were likely to be formed by misfolded RNA molecules.

Mini-genomes containing the M1 series mutations in the UFS were assayed, and the WT and CS-M mini-genomes served as control reactions. No NS5Pol was present in the left first lane of each group.

The de novo products in reactions using M1 and M3 series mini-genomes as templates were also all reduced compared to those produced using the WT mini-genome as a template suggesting that the UFS is disabled in mini-genomes because of the unwinding of its duplex ( Figure 10D ). The differences in RdRp activity between WT mini-genome and the UFS mutants were likely caused by changes of primary sequence in these constructs, In supporting of this, the M1C and M3C mutants were not able to reach the same level of replication as WT in replicon assay ( Figure 3D) , and it has been reported that the base composition of U-rich sequence in the UFS was actually able to affect vRNA replication of DENV2 (Friebe and Harris, 2010) .Taken together, the above results demonstrated that genome cyclization disables the function of the UFS in NS5Pol recruitment, suggesting that the UFS has to function dynamically during vRNA replication. Moreover, the attenuation of the affinity of NS5Pol for vRNA by genome cyclization is potentially important for the translocation of NS5Pol from the 5 0 end to the 3 0 end of vRNA.",

Although the highly circularized mini-genome is much shorter than the actual viral genome, it has been theoretically proposed that the generic properties of a large RNA molecule lead its two ends to stay close to each other (Yoffe et al., 2011) , which was supported by results from single-molecule FRET assays (Leija-Martinez et al., 2014) . Thus, the 5 0 and 3 0 ends of the flavivirus genome have great opportunities to contact each other, and due to the high affinity between them, most vRNA molecules would stay circularized in the equilibrium state. Moreover, protein factors have been shown to facilitate the cyclization of mRNA and vRNA in vivo. In fact, the PABP protein, which bridges mRNA ends through poly(A)-PABP-eIF4E-5 0 cap interactions, has been shown to bind to the DENV 3 0 UTR (Polacek et al., 2009) . However, if the linear conformation of vRNA, the only conformation under which the UFS can exist, is present in low abundance, the question remains of how the latter can function.",

A mechanistic model to explain the function of the UFS is described below. (i) vRNA released in the cytoplasm is translated to generate a sufficient level of viral proteins, which leads to the eventual binding of NS5 to the SLA and the initiation of (\u00c0) strand synthesis, even without the presence of the UFS duplex. (ii) Completion of (\u00c0) strand synthesis generates the dsRNA RF, which serves as the template for the synthesis of progeny vRNA in the presence of viral NS5/NS3 and other viral/host factors (not shown in Figure 11 ). (iii) During the elongation of the nascent (+) strand, the 5 0 terminus of the parental (+) strand RNA is displaced first, and the UFS duplex is folded on the protruding 5 0 end; this 'ON' state of the UFS facilitates the recruitment of NS5 to the free 5 0 end. (iv) After the completion of the nascent chain synthesis, the NS5-bound vRNA undergoes genome cyclization, and the UFS element is set to 'OFF' by the hybridization between genome termini, which decreases the binding strength of NS5 to the 5 0 terminus and promotes its translocation to the 3 0 terminus to initiate next-round synthesis of negative-strand vRNA. Such dynamic modulation of NS5 binding should be of great significance to maintain an appropriate level of (\u00c0) vRNA synthesis to ensure the global balance of vRNA replication because the dsRNA RF is a highly active template for (+) vRNA synthesis.",

Our results demonstrated that the UFS links two events of vRNA replication, NS5 recruitment and genome cyclization, together, and the structural stability of the UFS is elaborately balanced to meet the requirements of both. Especially, the conformational change of the UFS caused by genome cyclization is coupled with its function in modulating dynamic RdRp recruitment. As the function of UFS in viral replication and RdRp recruitment was investigated using different flaviviruses (DENV4, JEV and ZIKV), it is plausible to consider that the UFS is a general regulatory strategy of viral replication among the flavivirus genus. Although a previous report has suggested that the UFS may not be functional in DENV2, this was more likely to be an exception, as our SHAPE data also indicated that the UFS in DENV2 is highly unstable in vitro, in contrast to the UFS elements from other viruses (Figure 2) . Figure 11 . Model explaining the functional mechanism of the UFS switch. A proposed mechanistic model of flavivirus vRNA replication. (i) After the viral genome is released into the cytoplasm, first, translation occurs on the circularized genome to generate a sufficient level of viral proteins for downstream vRNA synthesis. (ii) Accumulation of viral replication proteins (only NS5 and NS3 are shown) to high concentrations results in the formation of an RNA-viral replicase complex and initiates (\u00c0) RNA synthesis to generate the double-stranded replication form (RF). (iii) Then, the synthesis of nascent (+) RNA using RF as the template is initiated by NS5/viral replicase. During the process, 5 0 local structures including UFS are formed in the displaced, parental (+) strand RNA. A free NS5/viral replicase is recruited to bind the 5 0 end of the displaced (+) RNA. (iv) As soon as the nascent (+) strand RNA synthesis completes, the released (+) ssRNA genome is circularized by terminal interactions, and the next round of (\u00c0) strand synthesis is ready to start.

The UA-base-pair-rich UFS and the UFS-like element have been identified in MBFVs, two clades of NKVs, and ISFVs, demonstrating that the UFS element is evolutionarily conserved. Interestingly, while the UFS duplex unwinds during genome cyclization in MBFVs and NKVs, neither the conserved mode of genome cyclization nor the unwinding of UFS-like elements during this process was found in ISFVs. The ISFVs have been indicated to be the most divergent outgroup among the genus flavivirus (Blitvich and Firth, 2015; Cook and Holmes, 2006; Moureau et al., 2015) , which led us to assume that modern flaviviruses are evolved from an insect virus ancestor. We speculated that primordial UFS-like structures are potential viral replication enhancers with RdRp-recruiting functions in ancient ISFVs. When the viruses were introduced into vertebrates, the intense selection pressure caused by shifting between two hosts promoted the emergence of a highly efficient genome cyclization strategy, and the UFS-like elements evolved into the RNA switches in modern flaviviruses. Moreover, although the UFS structure itself was lost when the ancestral ISFV adapted into ticks and some special vertebrates, its functional mechanism was inherited by the appearance of elements such as 5 0 -SL2/CS-A in TBFVs. Thus, by looking into the evolutionary history of flaviviruses and exploring the modes of genome cyclization among them, we propose that the UFS may play a critical role during the evolution of the genus flavivirus.",

In the improved version, p4-Dualstop-SP-IRES-Rluc-Rep, one additional stop codon was introduced into loop 3 of the DCS-PK element to abolish the potential translational start from a cryptic AUG in the 5 0 CS element.(B) Replication characteristics of the above two replicons in BHK-21 cells. Relative luciferase units are defined as the ratio of luciferase units measured at different time points after transfection to the value measured at 6 hr post-transfection. (C) Demonstration of DENV4 UFS mutants. Mutations are shown in purple. The 'A' mutants contain mutations in the downstream strand of the UFS, and the 'B' mutants contain mutations in the upstream strand of the UFS. The 'C' mutant in each group combines the 'A' and 'B' mutations to restore the secondary structure of the UFS. Note that the secondary structures shown here are for illustration only and do not represent the actual folding of these mutants. (D) Replication efficiency of the UFS mutants. The results of one of two independent biological replicates were shown. One hundred nanograms per well of replicon RNA species were transfected into BHK-21 cells in triplicate. The results are expressed as the percentage of the relative luciferase units of a UFS mutant at 72 hr post-transfection to the value of the WT replicon (relative replication efficiency).

(C) The binding of DENV4 NS5Pol to 5 0 -300 nt RNA molecules containing UFS mutations was analyzed by EMSA. No NS5Pol was present in the left first lane of each group. The NS5Pol concentrations in the reactions were approximately 2.0, 3.5, 5.0 and 7.5 mM (from left to right). (D) In vitro RdRp activity assay using 5 0 -160 nt RNA as a template. The reactions were incubated at 30\u02daC for 20 min. Detection was based on the incorporation of biotin-11-CTP into the products. Left, the results of the M1 series; right, the results of the M3 series. Two bands were detectable in the blot: the upper template-sized band was generated by the terminal addition of biotin-11-CTP to the input template due to the terminal nucleotide transferase activity of NS5Pol in the presence of Mn 2+ , and the lower band represented the dsRNA product of de novo RNA synthesis, which was confirmed by comparison of the electrophoretic patterns of the RdRp products and annealed dsRNA molecules (Figure 6-figure supplement 2). (E) EMSA was performed for the 5 0 -160 nt RNA molecules containing M1 series mutations. The NS5Pol concentrations in the reactions were approximately 3.6, 7.2, 10.7 and 14.3 mM (left to right).
