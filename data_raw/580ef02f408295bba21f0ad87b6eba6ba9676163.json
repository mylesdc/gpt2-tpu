This study applies traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) Zheng diagnosis in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock to evaluate its adaptability and use as an early predictor of sepsis mortality. Three-year prospective observational study enrolled 126 septic patients. TCM Zheng diagnosis, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score, and blood samples for host response cytokines measurement (tumor necrosis factor-, Interleukin-6, Interleukin-8, Interleukin-10, Interleukin-18) were collected within 24 hours after admission to Intensive Care Unit. Main outcome was 28-day mortality; multivariate logistic regression analysis served to determine predictive variables of the sepsis mortality. APACHE II score, frequency of Nutrient-phase heat, and Qi-Xu and Yang-Xu Zhengs were significantly higher in nonsurvivors. The multivariate logistic regression analysis identified Yang-Xu Zheng as the outcome predictor. APACHE II score and levels of five host response cytokines between patients with and without Yang-Xu Zheng revealed significant differences. Furthermore, cool extremities and weak pulse, both diagnostic signs of Yang-Xu Zheng, were also proven independent predictors of sepsis mortality. TCM diagnosis \"Yang-Xu Zheng\" may provide a new mortality predictor for septic patients.",

Diagnostic methods reliably identifying patients with a higher risk of death are urgently needed in order to provide timely treatment and improve cost-efficacy of intensive care [2] . Since reliable concepts and accurate measurements to rate mortality risk and stratify severity of septic patients are insufficient [3, 4] , a classification system named PIRO was developed to stratify patients on the basis of their predisposition, the nature and extent of insult/infection, nature and magnitude of response, and degree of concomitant organ dysfunction [5, 6] . Multiple host and pathogen-associated characteristics are utilized in this system to predict outcome. Similar diagnostic concepts also exist in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) Zheng diagnosis. The integrity of the human body and its close interaction with the environment (e.g., infectious pathogens) are emphasized in TCM. Disease is considered as a common product of both pathogenic factors and maladjustment in the body [7] . While diagnosing patients, Zheng is an outcome after all signs and symptoms are analyzed. As disease progresses, Zheng may evolve, since signs and symptoms may change [8] . The TCM Zheng diagnosis implies both the subtype categorization and severity staging of disease progress, making TCM Zheng diagnosis feasible for adoption as a disease stratification tool in clinical practice [9] .",

This was affirmed by finding Yang-Xu Zheng as an independent predictor of mortality. Although the Body Constitution Questionnaire (BCQ+) developed by our team aims at assessing Yang-Xu status of the body [30, 31] , it is not fitting to measure the Yang-Xu status of septic patients in this study. BCQ+ measures the relatively stable physiological condition of the body, but signs and symptoms of sepsis vary quite rapidly under pathological interaction of pathogen virulence and host response [32] .",

In this study, these diagnostic signs were observed in the postresuscitation phase of septic patients. Even under effects of fluid supplement and inotropic medication, all four distal extremities were still obviously cool to the examiner's hand. This finding concurs with reports from Kaplan et al. [33] and Lima et al. [34] . During examination of the radial artery (side without arterial line insertion), pulse was weak and blood flow easily blocked by fingertip compression. Pulse diagnosis enables TCM physicians to evaluate cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance approximately. In severe sepsis and septic shock, myocardial dysfunction and cardiovascular derangements often manifest [35] . Cool extremities and weak pulse, two signs of peripheral hypoperfusion, are easily assessed and can also be applied by Western physicians to identify septic patients at a higher risk of death within seconds.",
