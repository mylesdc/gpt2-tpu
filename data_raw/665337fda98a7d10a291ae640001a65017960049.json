            "text": "Size-controlled gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were synthesised with solutions of three types of Polish honeys (lime, multiflower, honeydew) and used in microwave-induced hyperthermia cancer treatment. Optical and structural properties of nanostructures were optimized in reference to measurements made by using UV/Vis absorption spectrophotometry (UV/Vis), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) supported by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and attenuated total reflectance Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy (ATR FT-IR). In addition, concentrations of reducing sugars and polyphenols of honeys applied were determined to reveal the role of these chemical compounds in green synthesis of AuNPs. It was found that the smallest AuNPs (20.6 \u00b1 23.3 nm) were produced using a 20% (w/v) multiflower aqueous honey solution and 25 mg\u00b7L \u22121 of Au(III) ions. These AuNPs were then employed in microwave-induced hyperthermia in a system simulating metastatic tissues. This research illustrated that AuNPs, as produced with the aid of a multiflower honey solution, could be suitably used for microwave-induced heating of cancer. A fluid containing resultant Au nanostructures, as compared to water, revealed facilitated heating and the ability to maintain a temperature of 45 \u2022 C required for hyperthermia treatment.

Since hyperthermia-based medical procedures rely on the susceptibility of metastatic tissues to be destroyed at elevated temperatures (41-47 \u2022 C) [22] , the increase in the thermal response of the area surrounding a tumour may lead to more effective treatment. In microwave-induced hyperthermia procedures, this is achieved by applying nanofluids (NFs) that usually contain metallic nanostructures with ability to be electromagnetically excited. The most common NFs are Fe 3 O 4 -based and are effective in the hyperthermia treatment of bone metastases [16] . AuNPs are usually applied in sophisticated procedures of photo-induced hyperthermia due to the plasmonic effect that they cause [13] . However, based on our previous studies [23, 24] , AuNPs and PtNPs have the extraordinary ability to transfer and accumulate heat, even at ultra-trace concentrations. Therefore, it can be hypothesized that the application of functionalized AuNPs in microwave-induced hyperthermia treatment of cancer may also be very effective.",

Although many methods were described for the production of AuNPs, green methods are a promising alternative to well-known chemical methods [25] . In green synthesis, naturally occurring substances are used as reducing and stabilizing agents during AuNPs production instead of strong, and usually toxic, chemicals. For that reason, synthesized AuNPs are biogenic and biocompatible [26] [27] [28] . There are a variety of natural products reported to be suitable for green synthesis of AuNPs. Accordingly, aqueous leaf extracts prepared from Mentha piperita [28], Melissa officinalis [28], Salvia officinalis [28], Terminalia catappa [29], Rosa rugosa [30], Hibiscus rosa sinensis [31], Cinnamomum camphora [32], Eucalyptus globulus [33], Rosmarinus officinalis [33], Ziziphus zizyphus [34], and Plumbago zeylanica [35], aqueous extracts originated from blackberries, blueberries, and pomegranates [36], in addition to essential oils collected from Eucalyptus globulus [33], Rosmarinus officinalis [33], Anacardium occidentale [37], Curcuma pseudomontana [38], and some food products, including Punica granatum juices [39], coffee Arabica infusions [40], and cacao powder beverages [41] were involved in the production of AuNPs.

By tuning the type of applied aqueous honey solutions, the honey concentration in these solutions, as well as the concentration of Au(III) ions added to these aqueous solutions, optimal conditions, at which the smallest in size AuNPs were produced, were found by applying UV/Vis absorption spectrophotometry (UV/Vis). Then, nanofluids (NFs) containing AuNPs synthesized under these optimal conditions were characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) supported by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Next, attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (ATR FT-IR) was applied to identify chemical compounds of honey solutions responsible for the production of AuNPs. Particularly, to reveal the role of reducing sugars and phenolic compounds in examined green synthesis of Au nanostructures, total concentrations of reducing sugars and phenolic compounds in applied honey solutions were determined using the Bertrand's method and the Folin-Ciocalteu assay, respectively.

Afterwards, this solution was introduced into a glass tubular reactor and placed in an ERTEC, model 02-02 microwave reactor (Ertec, Wroclaw, Poland). The procedure of heating was experimentally developed so as to heat the AuNPs-containing NF to 45 \u2022 C within 6 min. Then, temperature was maintained for another 4 min, applying a power of 15 W. The experiment was also carried out under the same conditions, but using water as a control. Temperature of each liquid was monitored every second and the heating rate was calculated using the simplified Newton's law of heating, i.e., dT(t)/dt = k(h)\u00b7\u2206T(t), where T(t) is temperature at a given time; k(h) is the heating rate (s \u22121 ), and \u2206T(t) is a difference in temperature over time t [56] .",

For that reason, the first indication that AuNPs were fruitfully synthesized with the aid of honey solutions was the change of colour of the mixed solutions from yellowish (before addition of a solution of Au(III) ions to a given honey solution) to ruby-red (after addition of the solution of Au(III) ions). Appearance of such a ruby-red colour in the mixed solution containing Au(III) ions at 100 mg\u00b7L \u22121 and 20% (w/v) of honeydew honey was observed after 5 min. On the other hand, for a lime tree honey and multi-flower honey, the mentioned ruby-red colour appeared after 30 and 35 min, respectively, for the mixed solution consisting 100 mg\u00b7L \u22121 of Au(III) ions and 20% (w/v) of honeys. In addition, it was noted that the formation of AuNPs, emanated by the appearance of the ruby-red colour of mixed solutions, strongly depended on the type of honey used for synthesis, as well as the concentration of honey, and the concentration of Au(III) ions in resultant mixed solutions. Accordingly, differences observed in time after which the ruby-red colour appeared in mixed solutions were directly related to differences in the concentration of chemical compounds, namely reducing sugars and polyphenols, that were responsible for the reduction of Au(III) ions and the stabilization of AuNPs formed in these conditions [43] .",

Accordingly, the lowest value of the LSPR absorption band \u03bb max was 538.5 nm and was observed for conditions when the lime tree honey solution was used and its final concentration in the mixed solution was 20% (w/v) while the concentration of Au(III) ions was 25 mg\u00b7L \u22121 . When using multi-flower solutions, similar conditions in reference to concentrations of honey and Au(III) ions were also found to produce the smallest in size AgNPs with the LSPR absorption band \u03bb max located at 538.2 nm. By contrast, optimal conditions for the synthesis of AuNPs with honeydew honey solutions related to the concentration of honey and Au(III) in the mixed solution was 5% (w/v) and 50 mg\u00b7L \u22121 , respectively. For all honey solutions used, it was established that when the concentration of Au(III) ions in the mixed solution increased, the position of the LSPR absorption band \u03bb max also increased, indicating that the AuNPs higher in size were formed in these conditions (see results in Table 1 ).

For AuNPs produced with the multiflower honey solution or with the honeydew honey solution, this equation was applied to the width of the most intense diffraction peak in the XRD pattern, i.e., the one with (111) Miller's indices. Accordingly, it was established that the average size of Au nanostructures produced using the multiflower honey solution was 18.0 nm. In the case of the honeydew honey solution it was 12.2 nm.

Mentioned stretching vibrations \u03bd might have originated from carboxylic acids or from free amino acids, respectively, present in all analyzed honey solutions [61] . Furthermore, bending vibrations \u03b4 of the O-CH group (range 1342-1418 cm \u22121 ) were related to carbohydrate compounds like glucose and D-fructose, also occurring in analyzed honey solutions [61] . In addition, the presence of proteins was confirmed by intense peaks (range 1450-1240 cm \u22121 ), related to stretching vibrations \u03bd of the C-N group (the amide III band), and in-plane bending vibrations \u03b4 of the N-H group (the amide II band).

Their contribution to the formation of AuNPs is likely associated with their reducing and stabilizing properties [55] . For that reason, the concentration of reducing sugars and phenolic compounds in honey solutions used for green synthesis of AuNPs, before and after the addition of a solution of Au(III) ions into them, have been examined. It was found that the concentration of reducing sugars and phenolic compounds in honey solutions changed after the addition of Au(III) ions (Table 2 ). This suggested that these compounds were involved in the production of Au nanostructures. In addition, a relationship between the concentration of reducing sugars in honey solutions and the average size of produced AuNPs was found (Table 2, Figure 6 ). Honey solutions with high total concentrations of reducing sugars seemingly led to formation of smaller in size AuNPs. As was suggested by Snitka et al. [43] , honey-mediated formation of AuNPs was related to the total concentration of reducing sugars, as well as to the type of reducing sugars. Apparently from the cited work, glucose (aldose) was found to be the main reducing agent in green synthesis of AuNPs, and this was associated with the presence of the aldehyde group [43] . On the other hand, D-fructose (ketose) exhibited only stabilizing properties during synthesis of AuNPs [43] . Stabilizing properties of D-fructose were related to repulsive forces (electrostatic or steric) due to its hydrophobic carbon chain. Overall, Snitka et al. suggested that glucose was a primary compound involved in honey-mediated reduction of Au(III) to Au 0 of nanometric size, whereas D-fructose behaved as a capping agent for AuNPs nucleation and their growth, and prevented their aggregation [43] . However, no correlation between the total content of phenolics and size of resultant AuNPs was found (Table 2) . Thus, it was concluded that reducing sugars were crucial for determining the size of resultant AuNPs. ATR FT-IR spectra of mixed solutions containing AuNPs, produced using given honey solutions, were very similar to those recorded for aqueous honey solutions ( Figure 5 ). However, the identified bands were slightly shifted towards longer wavelengths in case of mixed solutions containing synthesised AuNPs. Those shifts in wavelengths of vibration bands might suggest that carboxylic acids, free amino-acids, monosaccharaides (glucose, D-fructose), and proteins present in honey solutions could be responsible for the stabilization of resultant AuNPs [42] .",

Meanwhile, the AuNPs fabricated in the solution of honeydew honey reached maximum of 44 \u00b0C in about 6 min. The differences are attributed to the slightly greater average size of the latter ones, leading to the conclusion, that greater area-to-surface ratio ensures more effective heating. In the same time, exposure to microwaves (at 15 W) led water to be heated up to 30 \u00b0C, however, the system needed almost 7 min to achieve this. As a result, the greatest heating rate to maximum temperature was recorded for the medium with AuNPs obtained with the aid of multiflower honey (11.7 \u00d7 10 \u22123 s \u22121 ) as compared to this for water (6.8 \u00d7 10 \u22123 s \u22121 ). Since the tested NFs with AuNPs was heated to temperatures 14-15 \u00b0C greater than the temperature of water, it could be stated that AuNPs indeed might be applicable in hyperthermia treatment procedures. To maintain constant temperature of the NF containing AuNPs required the microwave field to be periodically turned off and turned on. No such operation was required for water, which was constantly exposed to microwave radiation. It must be remembered that in real life conditions, both AuNPs and water in tissues would be heated at the same time by exactly the same exposure to microwaves, whether it ",

            "text": "In Figure 7 , heating curves of water and these recorded for the NF containing AuNPs obtained with the aid of both honeys are shown. As can be seen, AuNPs synthesized using multiflower honey were heated to 45 \u2022 C in about 5 min. Meanwhile, the AuNPs fabricated in the solution of honeydew honey reached maximum of 44 \u2022 C in about 6 min. The differences are attributed to the slightly greater average size of the latter ones, leading to the conclusion, that greater area-to-surface ratio ensures more effective heating. In the same time, exposure to microwaves (at 15 W) led water to be heated up to 30 \u2022 C, however, the system needed almost 7 min to achieve this. As a result, the greatest heating rate to maximum temperature was recorded for the medium with AuNPs obtained with the aid of multiflower honey (11.7 \u00d7 10 \u22123 s \u22121 ) as compared to this for water (6.8 \u00d7 10 \u22123 s \u22121 ). Since the tested NFs with AuNPs was heated to temperatures 14-15 \u2022 C greater than the temperature of water, it could be stated that AuNPs indeed might be applicable in hyperthermia treatment procedures. To maintain constant temperature of the NF containing AuNPs required the microwave field to be periodically turned off and turned on. No such operation was required for water, which was constantly exposed to microwave radiation. It must be remembered that in real life conditions, both AuNPs and water in tissues would be heated at the same time by exactly the same exposure to microwaves, whether it would be turned off or turned on. Hence, maintaining constant hyperthermia of AuNPs would inevitably lead to cyclic turning off microwave radiation. This in turn would result in a decrease of temperature of surrounding tissues. Therefore, based on the observed phenomena, and due to the fact that Au nanostructures produced with the aid of honey solutions were likely functionalized by monosaccharaides such as glucose and D-fructose, it could be stated that such green synthesized AuNPs would be suitable for microwave hyperthermia treatment of cancer. would be turned off or turned on.
