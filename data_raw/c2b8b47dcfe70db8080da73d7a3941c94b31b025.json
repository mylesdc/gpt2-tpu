Using a seed stock of Ebola virus variant Kikwit, the linear range of the instrument was determined to be 2.8E+06 to 1.0E+09 virus particles per mL with coefficient of variation ranging from 9.4% to 31.5% for samples tested in triplicate.

They are enveloped, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA viruses belonging to two genera, Ebolavirus and Marburgvirus. There are at least five Ebolavirus species and a single Marburgvirus species [2] . Filovirus outbreaks are sporadic, rendering development and evaluation of therapeutic and vaccine efficacy in human trials problematic. For these virulent pathogens, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has established guidelines for the use of animal models as surrogates for human efficacy for the purpose of licensure. Well-characterized low passage virus preparations are critical in the development and evaluation of all medical countermeasures for these and other potential human pathogens. For this reason, standardized lots of filoviruses are required that are reproducible, highly characterized, and monitored over time for changes in the properties that could adversely affect its use as challenge stock in therapeutic or vaccine studies. The material produced must be of the highest quality, preferably with the highest infectious concentration (titer) and the lowest genomic equivalents (viral genetic material) to infectious virus and the lowest particle to infectious virus ratios achievable. Low ratios are thought to represent an intact virus and fewer numbers of non-infectious or defective interfering particles [3, 4] . One of the keys to success is accurate virus quantification.",

            "text": "The most commonly used methods for filovirus quantification include the plaque assay and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The gold standard for quantifying infectious viruses is the plaque assay, which provides a titer based on virus-infected cells producing a plaque. In theory, each plaque arises from a single infectious virion. Results provide a concentration of infectious virus particles, termed plaque-forming units (PFU/mL) [5] . Plaque assays are dependent on living cells and are labor intensive, with filoviruses requiring more than 7 days in culture and the requirement for high-level biocontainment (biosafety level-4). Generating consistent, reproducible viral titers using the plaque assay is dependent on a number of key parameters: cell type, cell confluency, inoculum volumes, agarose concentrations of primary and secondary overlays, cell staining reagent and concentration, as well as the day cells are stained and plaques are counted. While the tissue culture infectious dose 50% assay can also be used to quantitate infectious virus, it is not commonly used by the filovirus community. TEM has been used for many years to determine the number of virus particles and establish the shape and size of imaged particles on a grid. This technique does not measure infectivity or viability of the virus particles. Results are expressed as virus particles per mL (VP/mL). TEM is expensive, and sample preparation in high-level containment is challenging, tedious, and requires a skilled technician. Preparation and staining of grids takes a minimum of 2 h. Filovirus particle size is fairly well understood with length varying up to 14,000 nm and diameters of about 98 nm. Various configurations have been noted to include filaments, circular, and '6'-shaped forms. Counting requires a microscopist and it can take upwards of 2 h to count a single grid.",

            "text": "The ViroCyt \u00ae Virus Counter (VC) 2100 (ViroCyt, Boulder, CO, USA) instrument is a reengineered non-sorting analytical flow cytometer developed specifically to directly quantify virus particles in solution independent of the virus species. A single universal staining step uses a proprietary stain that is a combination of two fluorescent dyes, one specific for envelope proteins and the other specific for nucleic acids (both DNA and RNA, double stranded and single stranded) [9, 10] . Virus particles containing both envelope proteins and nucleic acids are stained by both dyes. Stained proteins larger than 25 nm and a genome > 8kb are enumerated separately. As the stained virus passes through the laser the VC simultaneously detects both fluorescent signatures and is counted as an intact virus (particle). Unlike traditional flow cytometry, which uses a forward scatter trigger based on size as a criterion, the VC uses a fluorescent trigger to register an event. A minimum of 200 fluors per virus are required to accurately trigger counting events on the VC. Threshold values automatically determined during sample acquisition and data analysis are used to discriminate virus events from background signal. In addition, in order to eliminate the possibility of calculating a particle concentration based on a less than significant number of events (5E+05 VP/mL), the minimum number of simultaneous events must be at least 600. Samples containing large amounts of protein can elevate the background intensity. The purer or cleaner the sample matrix is, the easier it is to differentiate virus from background. Accurate results require that background values be as low as possible in order to capture as many events as possible while at the same time excluding background noise. When testing a new or unknown sample matrix, a series of dilutions should be tested to determine the best dilution to use in subsequent analyses. Previous testing of various dilutions of filovirus seed stocks revealed that this sample matrix must be diluted at least 1:10 in order to differentiate virus particles from background. Optimal dilution in this matrix was determined to be 1:25. The staining process for the VC takes 30 min and does not require a wash step. Total analysis time is less than 10 min per sample (in triplicate). Training required to operate the VC is minimal and data analysis takes place in real time. Preparation and staining of samples and use of the VC for filoviruses must occur in high containment. Use of the instrument also poses safety concerns, which must be addressed appropriately. Due to its design there is an unlikely but potential risk for aerosol generation at the waste end. To mitigate this risk, a HEPA (High Efficiency Particulate Air) filter can be added to the outlet valve on the waste bottle. The VC can be placed and operated inside a standard biosafety cabinet. A large number of viruses have been counted on the instrument, including several influenza strains, baculovirus, dengue type 1 virus, human coronavirus NL63, herpes simplex virus type 1, Rubella virus, Parainfluenza virus 2, and respiratory syncytial virus [10, 11] . Like filoviruses, influenza viruses can present as filamentous particles and these can be easily counted by the instrument. The ease of sample preparation, speed of the assay, and less subjective interrogation of particles make this technique a potential addition to TEM for counting virus particles from filovirus stock preparations.",

Virus quantitation-specific assays used by different laboratories vary depending on the size of the biocontainment space, user preferences, and specific needs. Filovirus plaque assays are the gold standard assay for quantitation. Plaque assay quantifies infectious virus and has been used for many years by filovirus researchers. The assay is biological in nature, depending on living cells and their ability to be infected and produce plaques. The assay measures infectious virus but the ratio of infectious virus particle to plaque is unknown. There are many steps that contribute to the accuracy and reproducibility of the results. Standardization and training with periodic assessment can ensure the results are always optimal. Repeatability, a component of precision, was defined in this study as the CV between replicates. The plaque assay CV ranged from 7.4% to 37.7%, with the most dilute samples exhibiting the highest values. Titers established for each of these samples were within 0.28 logs. Reproducibility, expressed in this study as the difference in titer between the stock concentration determined at the time of preparation and that achieved in this study, was very good with only a 0.21 log difference in titer (97.1% of the original titer).",

Amplification occurs from both genomic as well as free nucleic acids as long as the target sequence is present in the sample [11, 17] . The assay is relatively quick (1-2 h) but due to multiple steps and its sensitivity, the technique can be prone to error and contamination. It is relatively expensive, requiring a virus-specific set of primers and probes, a reproducible source of control material, and a skilled technician to minimize contamination. During the validation the lower limit of quantitation of the EBOV-specific qRT-PCR was shown to be 1E+02 GE per reaction. For this EBOV stock this was equivalent to 1.23E+03 PFU/mL.

However, it is relatively expensive and few laboratories have the required expertise and instruments. TEM particle counts, although the current method of choice for enumeration of virus particles, have a relatively high limit of detection of 1E+07 VP/mL, which contributed to our inability to quantitate virus beyond the first dilution [20] . Different methods of sample preparation can lower the limit of detection to 1E+05 VP/mL, but use of these methodologies requires purification through sucrose density gradients or concentration by high-speed pelleting followed by fixation and embedding in resin [20] . Use of these methodologies would alter the sample composition and not provide a particle count, as found in the stock virus. TEM particle counts are also highly variable, with reports in the literature of relative error as high as 40% and standard deviations of up to 0.5 logs [21, 22] . Variability may arise during grid preparation with loss of specimen and/or reference beads during sample fixation and grid washing. Significant challenges to the precision (repeatability) and reproducibility of TEM are the pre-fixation drying, fixation artifacts, uneven sample distribution, clumping of the sample and/or reference beads, and the background that is caused by media salts and proteins present in the sample matrix. Preparation of quality grids is especially challenging in a biosafety level-4 environment where dexterity is extremely limited. Counting is subjective, but the effects can be reduced by standardization, cross-training, and periodic assessment. In our study, repeatability or CV of this assay was 121.6% for the most concentrated sample tested. Reproducibility was within 0.82 logs or 90.2% of the original concentration. TEM particle counts did not correlate with any of the other three quantitative assays, mainly due to the lack of samples that could be compared. Dilutions of EBOV chosen for this study were designed to provide more samples that would fall within the VC quantitative limits since it was assumed TEM had the lower sensitivity. The low number of particles counted per grid and high CV noted in the most concentrated sample indicates that it is at or near the limit of detection for this assay (1.02E+06 PFU/mL). In this study TEM results proved to be problematic, arising from the quality of the prepared grids and the higher sensitivity.",

Training to use and care for the instrument is minimal, but use of the instrument for filoviruses requires high containment and poses aerosol hazards that must be carefully mitigated. The one-step assay, instrument, and software are easy to use and do not require a highly trained individual. Due to its universal stain, the assay can be used with a wide variety of viruses. The VC is not amenable to quantifying filovirus particles directly from samples with high levels of proteins that are found in clinical samples (whole blood, serum, plasma) or stock preparations with fetal bovine serum concentrations greater than 10%. In these sample types, an initial dilution is required to lower background levels. Analysis of these matrices is possible, but would require purification or some other method to remove exogenous protein. While we can easily conceptualize automated counting of homogeneous spherical viruses such as herpes simplex, baculovirus, and dengue [10] , the VC has been shown to reproducibly enumerate influenza A and B, which can contain filamentous particles [10, 11] . For these viruses, VC results were shown to have a linear relationship and correlate with plaque assay, qRT-PCR, TEM, and/or tissue culture infectious dose 50% assays. The ability to count heterogeneous particles is due to the VC triggering on two simultaneous fluorescent events, or signals, as a virus particle passes through the laser and not the size or shape of the target as in conventional flow cytometry. Analysis of media only (negative) controls was required to establish the sample quantitation limit of the assay for this matrix (2.8E+06 VP/mL). For this EBOV stock this was equivalent to 1.03E+05 PFU/mL. Repeatability of this assay was similar to the plaque assay with CV ranging from 9.4% to 31.5%. VP/mL values were within 0.51 logs for samples that fell within the linear range of the assay. Reproducibility was within 0.44 logs (95.3%).",

Results from four different EBOV Kikwit preps as well as a single variant of SUDV and MARV are presented. While no direct correlation between concentrations of the various virus stocks were noted, the particle counts were greater than the plaque titers but lower than the genomic equivalents. Variability seen is possibly due to the time or amount of cell lysis when each preparation was harvested or the multiplicity of infection (MOI) used to produce the stocks, all of which are known to affect the infectious virus titer. Kikwit preps 1 and 2 represent similar Vero E-6 passage three stocks prepared at an MOI of 0.01, while prep 3 and 4 represent passage two stocks of the same EBOV variant. Prep 3 was produced at an MOI of 0.01 and prep 4, like the SUDV Gulu and MARV Angola variants, were produced at an MOI of 0.001. Results reveal that there is about a log surplus of viral genetic material produced when compared to the number of virus particles as measured by the VC and an additional two logs more particles than infectious virus. These results may be due to the amount of cell lysis at the time of harvest or perhaps inefficient filovirus virion packaging or both. Similar patterns were noted for filoviruses by Weidman and colleagues when comparing plaque assay, qRT-PCR, and a focus-forming assay using virus-specific antibodies for a variety of hemorrhagic fever viruses [17] . Their study demonstrated that some viruses, for example Lassa and yellow fever, were more efficient at replication and packaging of infectious viruses than others such as filoviruses and Rift Valley fever virus. As shown in Table 1 , the VC and TEM particle counts were within one log of each other, which is also within the normal variability seen for the TEM (data not shown). As TEM improvements are instituted and variability of this technique is improved this difference should decrease.",
