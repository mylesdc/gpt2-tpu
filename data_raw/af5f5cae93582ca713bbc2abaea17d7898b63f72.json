            "text": "Sapelovirus A (SV-A), formerly known as porcine sapelovirus as a member of a new genus Sapelovirus, is known to cause enteritis, pneumonia, polioencephalomyelitis and reproductive disorders in pigs. We have recently identified a2,3-linked sialic acid on GD1a ganglioside as a functional SV-A receptor rich in the cells of pigs and chickens. However, the role of GD1a in viral pathogenesis remains elusive. Here, we demonstrated that a Korean SV-A strain could induce diarrhoea and intestinal pathology in piglets but not in chicks. Moreover, this Korean SV-A strain had mild extra-intestinal tropisms appearing as mild, non-suppurative myelitis, encephalitis and pneumonia in piglets, but not in chicks. By real-time reverse transcription (RT) PCR, higher viral RNA levels were detected in faecal samples than in sera or extra-intestinal organs from virusinoculated piglets. Immunohistochemistry confirmed that high viral antigens were detected in the epithelial cells of intestines from virus-inoculated piglets but not from chicks. This Korean SV-A strain could bind the cultured cell lines originated from various species, but replication occurred only in cells of porcine origin. These data indicated that this Korean SV-A strain could replicate and induce pathology in piglets but not in chicks, suggesting that additional porcine-specific factors are required for virus entry and replication. In addition, this Korean SV-A strain is enteropathogenic, but could spread to the bloodstream from the gut and disseminate to extra-intestinal organs and tissues. These results will contribute to our understanding of SV-A pathogenesis so that efficient anti-sapelovirus drugs and vaccines could be developed in the future.",

Viruses in this family can cause a wide range of diseases, including intestinal, respiratory, neurological, cardiac, hepatic, mucocutaneous and systemic diseases of various severities in both humans and animals (Racaniello, 2013) . Since porcine enterovirus 8 (PEV-8), simian type 2 picornavirus and duck picornavirus TW90A have a unique genomic organization different from other picornavirus genera (Son et al., 2014a) , the genus Sapelovirus is a newly assigned member of the Picornaviridae family (Adams et al., 2015) . The Sapelovirus genus consists of three species: Sapelovirus A (SV-A) formerly known as porcine sapelovirus, Sapelovirus B formerly named as simian sapelovirus and Avian sapelovirus formerly known as duck picornavirus TW90A (Adams et al., 2015) . diarrhoea, pneumonia, polioencephalomyelitis and reproductive disorders (Alexandersen et al., 2012; Huang et al., 1980; Lamont & Betts, 1960; Lan et al., 2011; Schock et al., 2014; Sibalin, 1963) . Experimental studies have demonstrated a diverse range of clinical symptoms (Lamont & Betts, 1960; Lan et al., 2011; Sibalin, 1963; Yamanouchi et al., 1965) . These differences largely depend on age, route of infection and strains inoculated (Alexander & Betts, 1967; Lamont & Betts, 1960; Lan et al., 2011; Sibalin, 1963; Yamanouchi et al., 1965) .",

The genomes of SV-As and other members in the genus Sapelovirus have the typical picornavirus genome organization: 5'-UTR-L-VP4-VP2-VP3-VP1-2A-2B-2C-3A-3B-3C-3D-3'-UTR (Krumbholz et al., 2002; Oberste et al., 2002 Oberste et al., , 2003 Son et al., 2014a; Tseng & Tsai, 2007) . However, there are significant structural differences in the SV-A genome, e.g. the cis-acting RNA element (CRE) in the 2c coding region and kissing domain in the 3'-UTR vary between recent Korean and Chinese strains and older English and Chinese strains (Son et al., 2014a) . These differences in antigenic diversity and structural features can influence the pathogenicity and/or host range restriction of SV-A strains, yet we have a limited understanding of the pathogenesis of SV-A (Son et al., 2014a) .",

Large intestinal lesions, including crypt fusion with epithelial cell hyperplasia, were observed at 2 dpi, increased until 5 dpi followed by a decrease at 7 dpi (Fig. 2) . Lungs from infected piglets showed lymphoid cell infiltration in the peribronchiolar submucosa and perivascular space from 5 dpi to the end of the experiment (Fig. 3 ). As shown in Table 2 , adaptive immune reactions to SV-A infection evident as perivascular cuffing of lymphocytes and gliosis were observed in both grey and white matters of spinal cord (myelitis) and brain (encephalitis) (Fig. 3) . These typical host defence reactions were observed from 7 dpi until the termination of the experiment. Neuronophagia and chromatolysis were not frequently found in the spinal cord or the brain. However, spinal cords showed stronger inflammatory reactions than the brain (Table 2) . No specific lesion was observed in other organs or tissues collected from piglets regardless of SV-A infection. However, SV-A did not induce any histopathological change in any organ or tissue sequentially sampled from SV-A-inoculated chicks during the entire experimental period (Fig. 4) .

Indeed, glycolipid-associated a2,3-terminal SA is abundant on the cell surface of both avian and porcine species (de Graaf & Fouchier, 2014; Raman et al., 2014) . However, our results in this study revealed that SV-A infection was limited to cells of porcine origin. It could not infect cells of other origins including chickens and humans. Moreover, SV-A was replicated in piglets but not in chicks, confirming that SV-A could not cause interspecies transmission at least between pigs and chickens. Our results also suggested that other factors in addition to glycolipid-associated a2,3-terminal SA might be required for efficient SV-A replication in cells of non-porcine origin. We have previously observed that chymotrypsin or trypsin treatment of cells has no effect on virus infection (Kim et al., 2016) , suggesting that cell surface-associated proteins do not play accessory roles in SV-A infection. The nature of post-binding block to infection in cells from non-porcine origin is as yet unknown, but it is possible the SV-A infection of avian cells induces the innate response leading to the restriction of viral replication.",

In the current study, the most significant lesions were found in the intestines during the early infection period, where severe villous atrophy was found to be associated with high viral RNA loads in the faecal samples and strong SV-A antigen reactivity in the intestinal epithelial cells. In contrast, the spinal cord and brain mainly showed signs of adaptive immune response (non-suppurative inflammation) and comparatively low viral RNA copy numbers without clear evidence of SV-A antigen-positive cells. These data indicated that the Korean SV-A strain (KS04105) used in this study was enteropathogenic. Contrary to our data, a recent study has reported that neuroinvasive English SV-A strain replication in the spinal cord could lead to severe adaptive immune responses (non-suppurative polioencephalomyelitis) without causing lesions in other tissues (Schock et al., 2014) . This English SV-A strain (G5) is phylogenetically closer to the English V13 strain than to other SV-A strains circulating recently in Korea and China (Schock et al., 2014; Son et al., 2014a) . The molecular basis involved in the differences in virulence and tropism among SV-A strains remains unknown. However, there is clear evidence showing that variation in RNA structures can contribute to viral virulence (Son et al., 2014a ). An additional explanation for discordance in tropism may be variation in the age of animals used in studies. The English SV-A study used adult pigs (Schock et al., 2014) , whereas this study used neonatal piglets. Further studies are required to examine the predilections of age and inoculation routes, as well as antigenic and genomic differences, so that our understanding of variations in SV-A pathogenesis and/or host range restriction can be improved.",

Our data also indicated that this Korean SV-A strain could reach the bloodstream from the gut, and be disseminated to extra-intestinal organs and tissues. These results will improve our understanding of the life cycle and pathogenesis of sapelovirus so that affordable, useful and efficient drugs can be developed for anti-sapelovirus therapy.",

SV-A genome RNA levels in the faeces, sera and each organ or tissue were quantified by qRT-PCR as described previously with slight modifications (Chen et al., 2014; Park et al., 2013) . Briefly, all tissues and fluid samples collected from experimental animals were individually weighed, homogenized or vortexed at a 1 : 10 dilution in 0.01 M PBS and centrifuged (tissues 13 000 g for 3 min; faecal samples 5000 g for 10 min). The supernatants, along with the remaining bulk samples, were collected and stored at \u00c080 C for analysis.

Each infected cell culture was freeze-thawed three times, and cell debris was spun down at 2469 g for 10 min at 4 C. After extracting total RNA from supernatants, each realtime RT-PCR was performed using a Rotor-Gene real-time amplification system (Corbett Research) and SensiFAST SYBR Lo-ROX One-Step mix (Enzynomics) in a final volume of 20 \u00b5l containing 10 \u00b5l of Sensi-FAST SYBR Lo-ROX One-Step mix (Enzynomics), 0.2 \u00b5l of reverse transcriptase, 0.4 \u00b5l of RiboSafe RNase Inhibitor, 0.8 \u00b5l of PSV1 primer (GGCAGTAGCGTGGCGAGC at positions between 153 and 170 of the 5\u00a2-UTR), 0.8 \u00b5l of PSV2 primer (CTACTCTCCTGTAACCAGT at positions between 242 and 260 of the 5\u00a2-UTR), 4 \u00b5l of template and 3.8 \u00b5l RNase-free dH 2 O.

Quantitation of virus RNA copies was carried out using a standard curve derived from 10-fold serial dilutions of in vitro transcripted cRNA amplified in separate PCR tubes. Rotorgene 6000 \u00ae (Corbett Research) software was used to calculate the amount of SV-A-specific RNA in the samples. The threshold was defined automatically in the initial exponential phase, reflecting the highest amplification rate. With regard to the crossing points resulting from the amplification curves and threshold, a direct relation between cycle number and log concentration of RNA molecules initially present in the RT-PCR was evident. By linear regression analysis of these data, Rotorgene 6000 \u00ae software was used to set up a standard curve to determine the concentration of RNA present in the samples.",
