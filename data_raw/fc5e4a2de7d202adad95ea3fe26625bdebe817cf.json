The UPS is reportedly downregulated in various neurodegenerative disorders, with increased proteasome activity shown to be beneficial in many related disease models. Proteasomes function under tonic inhibitory conditions, possibly via the ubiquitin chain-trimming function of USP14, a proteasome-associated deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB). We identified three specific RNA aptamers of USP14 (USP14-1, USP14-2, and USP14-3) that inhibited its deubiquitinating activity. The nucleotide sequences of these non-cytotoxic USP14 aptamers contained conserved GGAGG motifs, with G-rich regions upstream, and similar secondary structures. They efficiently elevated proteasomal activity, as determined by the increased degradation of small fluorogenic peptide substrates and physiological polyubiquitinated Sic1 proteins. Additionally, proteasomal degradation of tau proteins was facilitated in the presence of the UPS14 aptamers in vitro. Our results indicate that these novel inhibitory UPS14 aptamers can be used to enhance proteasome activity, and to facilitate the degradation of proteotoxic proteins, thereby protecting cells from various neurodegenerative stressors.",

This catabolic process is mainly mediated by ubiquitin (Ub)-dependent proteolysis, but when the proteins are intrinsically disordered proteins, they can be degraded by proteasomes in a Ub-independent manner 1 . The 26S proteasome is a multimeric complex, composed of a 28-subunit core particle (CP or 20S complex) and a 19-subunit regulatory particle (RP, PA700, or 19S complex) 2 . The RP recognizes the polyubiquitin (polyUb) chains of its substrates, deubiquitinates them before proteasomal proteolysis is initiated, and translocates the substrates to the catalytic cavity of the CP.",

UPS14 interacts with RPN1, while UCH37 binds to ADRM1/RPN13 4,5 . Both are located on the RP, relatively far from the substrate entry pore and the Ub receptors RPN1 and RPN10. UPS14 and UCH37 are thought to mediate stepwise disassembly of the Ub chain from the distal end 6 . This \"chain-trimming\" effect can delay proteasomal degradation by weakening the interaction between the Ub receptors of the proteasomes, and the polyUb chains of the substrates. Deletion of the USP14 gene, or chemical treatment with USP14 inhibitors, results in accelerated proteasomal degradation of various target substrates 7 . These findings suggest that USP14 is a potential therapeutic target for treating diseases where toxic proteins accumulate. However, it has also been reported that the trimming of Ub chains might promote proteasomal degradation 8 . The mechanism regulating this remains to be elucidated, but probably involves the rate of Ub chain-trimming on the proteasome in coordination with substrate translocation.",

This technique is known as systemic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) 9,10 . Since the introduction of SELEX technology, a wide range of biological targets, including small molecules, peptides, proteins, nucleic acids, cells, tissues and organisms, have been reported to bind to aptamers with high specificity. Aptamers are often referred to as \"chemical antibodies, \" and are one of only a few classes of biomolecules that can be manufactured to bind to multiple different targets. RNA aptamers have been isolated and shown to have stable conformations in vivo, following some modification. They can specifically bind to proteins such as human immunodeficiency virus Tat 11 , reverse transcriptase 12 , hepatitis C virus NS3 protease/helicase 13,14 , NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 15 , and severe acute respiratory syndrome NTPase/helicase 16 .

A random RNA library was generated as previously described 21 using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), T7 in vitro transcription, and a DNA template (109 bp) containing 40 random nucleotides. Briefly, the aptamer library template DNA (5\u2032 -GGG TTC ACT GCA GAC TTG ACG AAG CTT -40 N-A ATG GAT CCA CAT CAT CTA CGA ATT C-3\u2032 ) was generated by PCR using a forward primer (5\u2032 -GAT AAT ACG ACT CAC TAT AGG GTT CAC TGC AGA CTT GAC GAA-3\u2032 ) containing the T7 promoter sequence (underlined) and a reverse primer (5\u2032 -TTA CCT AGG TGT AGA TGC TTA AG-3\u2032 ) (Fig. 1B) . The RNA aptamer library was prepared using T7 RNA polymerase in in vitro transcription buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 15 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM spermidine, 5 mM DTT, and 2 mM NTPs) at 37 \u00b0C for 4 h. Products were treated with DNase I (Thermo Scientific) at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min, subjected to 12% denaturing urea PAGE using, and purified from gels. A 6-\u03bc g aliquot of each generated RNA pool was incubated with 100 \u03bc L of GST sepharose 4B resin in binding buffer [30 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM DTT, and 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA)] for 30 min at RT with occasional shaking. The RNA-bead complexes were transferred to porous centrifuge columns (Pierce), and RNA pools that were unbound to sepharose resin were collected by centrifugation. The same procedure was performed using 2 \u03bc g of GST proteins to remove RNAs that were nonspecifically bound to GST or glutathione resin. During each round of selection, GST-tagged proteins were incubated with 6 \u03bc g of pre-cleared RNA pools in 100 \u03bc L of binding buffer for 30 min at RT, and then with 100 \u03bc L of GST sepharose 4B resin for an additional 30 min at RT. The quantity of GST-tagged proteins was gradually decreased (2 \u03bc g, rounds 2-8; 1 \u03bc g, round 9; 0.5 \u03bc g, rounds 10-11; 0.25 \u03bc g, rounds 12-13; and 0.125 \u03bc g, rounds 14-15) to achieve more stringent conditions. The RNA-GST-USP14 complexes were then washed three times with PBS, and eluted with 20 mM glutathione in binding buffer. Eluted RNAs were purified by phenol:chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, reverse-transcribed with AccuPower RT PreMix (Bioneer), and amplified by PCR. The amplified cDNA was purified using the AccuPrep Gel purification kit (Bioneer) and transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase for the next round of selection (Fig. 1C) . (4) USP14-RNA complexes were dissociated with elution buffer containing excess imidazole. (5) RNAs bound to USP14 were prepared by phenol:chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Recovered RNAs were reverse transcribed, amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and in vitro transcribed. (6) Following 15 rounds of selection, the resultant cDNA was amplified and cloned into pcDNA 3.1. (D) Human proteasomes (PTSM) were purified from \u03b2 4-tagged HEK293 cell lines. Some of the proteasomes were treated with 1 \u03bc M ubiquitin-vinylmethylester (Ub-vme) to yield vme-PTSMs. PTSMs (1 \u03bc g) and vme-PTSMs (1 \u03bc g) were separated on 12% gradient gels and stained with CBB.

In the absence of vme-proteasomes, USP14 exhibited little deubiquitinating activity.

The enzymatic redundancy between these two enzymes on the proteasome is unclear, but is considered insignificant because UCH37 exhibits much weaker Ub hydrolysis activity than USP14 7 . Addition of the USP14 aptamers strongly inhibited proteasome-mediated Ub-rho110 hydrolysis ( Fig. 2G and Supplementary Fig. 4 ). USP14-3 showed the strongest inhibitory activity for all tested proteasome concentrations. The strong inhibition exhibited by USP14-3 could be a result of its ability to simultaneously bind to UCH37 (data not shown). This would indicate that UCH37 plays a more significant role in deubiquitinating polyubiquitinated substrates than previously thought 3 . Further study is required to determine whether chain-trimming by UCH37 can suppress proteasome activity as effectively as USP14.

To explore the possibility that inhibitory USP14 aptamers might enhance proteasome activity, we used suc-LLVY-AMC, a fluorogenic reporter substrate of 26S proteasomes. The fluorescent intensity as a result of suc-LLVY-AMC hydrolysis gradually increased over time (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. 5 ). Proteasomal activity was higher when the USP14 RNA aptamers were present than when control aptamers were used, indicating that inhibiting USP14 with an RNA aptamer results in facilitated proteasomal degradation. Potentially USP14 aptamers inhibit USP14 by preventing its docking on the proteasome. However, direct pulldown assays indicated that the scenario is negative (Fig. 3B) , indicating that the inhibitory effect by the RNA aptamer is mainly on USP14's DUB activity.",

Sic1, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, was polyubiquitinated using UBA1, UBC4, and RSP5 as cognate E1, E2, and E3 enzymes, respectively, along with other reconstitution components such as Ub and ATP 23 . The resulting Ub-Sic1 was gradually degraded when purified proteasomes were added. Addition of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 mutant protein in the reaction delayed Ub-Sic1 degradation (Fig. 3C) . Mixing purified proteasomes with catalytically inactive recombinant USP14(C114A) facilitated the degradation of Ub-Sic1. In the control reaction, approximately 70% of Ub-Sic1 proteins were degraded by proteasomes after 10 min.

However, it could also be the consequence of an accumulation of tau protein. To verify that proteasome activation by USP14 aptamers facilitates tau degradation, we prepared Ub-tau. The ability of proteasomes to degrade Ub-tau was enhanced in the presence of the USP14 aptamers (Fig. 3D,E) .

The effect of the USP14 aptamers on the proteasomal degradation of tau was examined using a HEK293-derived cell line expressing the longest isoform of human tau (htau40) upon induction with doxycycline 25 . These cells expressed htau40 in a dose-dependent manner and produced SDS-resistant tau aggregates after about 2 days in culture 31 . When USP14-3 aptamers were transfected into cells, the levels of induced tau proteins were significantly decreased in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4B) . The turnover of tau protein was facilitated by USP14-3 aptamers, as shown in our CHX chase analysis (Fig. 4C,D) . Under those conditions, tau mRNA levels were comparable (Fig. 4E) , indicating that accelerated tau degradation occurs post-translationally. The USP14 aptamers reduced cytotoxicity, which was induced by oxidative stress, in the presence of induced tau (Fig. 4F) . Treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 reversed the protective effects of USP14 aptamers. These results indicate that USP14 aptamer-induced proteasome activation might protect cells under various stressful conditions, including neurodegeneration.

These USP14-specific aptamers effectively inhibited deubiquitinating activity and enhanced proteasome activity in vitro. Cells treated with the aptamers showed facilitated degradation of soluble tau, delayed accumulation of tau aggregates, and enhanced cellular resistance to proteotoxic stress (Fig. 4) . Treatment of cells with IU1 and USP14 aptamers yielded similar results, suggesting that activation of cellular proteasomes is possible through USP14 inhibition. RNA aptamers have some advantages over small molecules as therapeutic agents, and our findings suggest that USP14 aptamers could be used in the treatment of diseases associated with abnormal proteasome function.",

USP14 and UCH37 are cysteine proteases that are reversibly associated with RPN1 and RPN13 respectively, their cognates on the RP. It is thought that the 26S proteasome regulatory subunit RPN11 promotes substrate degradation, while other DUBs delay degradation. RPN11 cleaves the base of a polyUb chain and enables the substrate to enter the CP for proteolysis. USP14 and UCH37 trim Ub chains from the distal end of polyUb, thus decreasing the affinity of the chain for Ub receptors. USP14 has been reported to be capable of non-catalytically inhibiting proteasomes 32 , although the molecular mechanisms responsible for this are unclear.",

The small molecule inhibitor of USP14, IU1, was identified by high-throughput screening, and found to enhance proteasomal degradation of target substrates in vitro and in vivo 7 . In vitro assays using Ub-Sic1 and Ub-tau with USP14 aptamers (Fig. 3C,D) indicated that elevated proteasomal activity might be due to catalytically inhibiting Ub chain-trimming of the proteasome substrate. The effects of USP14 aptamers on in vitro Ub degradation were more prominent when proteasomes were saturated with recombinant USP14 than when they were not. The different responses of Ub-Sic1 and Ub-tau to USP14 aptamers suggests that chain-trimming may not be a universal mechanism for regulating the rate of protein turnover. The weak response of tau proteins to USP14 inhibition suggests that their Ub chains have a higher binding affinity to the 26S proteasome compared with those of Sic1 23 . The USP14 aptamers enhance proteasomal degradation; however, it remains to be determined what features of Ub substrates, or whether the geometric morphology of polyUb chains affects degradation.",

Aptamers were first reported in the early 1990s 9 and have received widespread attention as potential therapeutic agents. The aptamer GB1-10 has been shown to recognize a glioblastoma-associated tenascin-C isoform, which is a useful marker for disease activity 33 . The expression of RNA aptamers against Ku protein in MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells potentially sensitized them to the anticancer drug etoposide 34 . The aptamer pegaptanib slows vision loss in people with neovascular age-related macular degeneration 35 . It has been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration, and has been incorporated into European guidelines. Several other RNA and DNA aptamers have been developed for use in preclinical and clinical trials 19 . The USP14 aptamer could be used for modulating proteotoxic proteins in cells. The essential sequence and structure of USP14 aptamers that mediates the strong interactions with USP14 requires elucidation. This would assist in determining how these aptamers can be further truncated and modified without adversely affecting their binding activity in vivo.",

Li et al. showed that cellular proteasome levels were increased when the 11S proteasome was upregulated in cardiomyocytes. This enhanced proteasome-mediated removal of oxidized proteins, and protected cells against cardiac proteinopathy and myocardial ischemia 36, 37 . In the current study, we observed that inhibiting USP14 with specific aptamers did not appear to alter proteasome levels, but alleviated tau-and paraquat-induced cytotoxicity. Our results indicate that enhanced proteasome activity can have a beneficial effect on cell viability under conditions of general proteotoxic stress. It remains to be determined whether USP14-specific RNA aptamers, or their modified forms, can accelerate the degradation of other proteopathic proteins. It was previously shown that IU1 was able to accelerate the degradation of tau, TDP43, ataxin 3, and glial fibrillary acidic protein 7 . The application of USP14 aptamers is not necessarily limited to cytoprotective roles against toxic protein accumulation. USP14 also plays an essential role in recycling Ub monomers, and in the dynamic regulation of Ub pools in cells 6, 38 . Therefore, USP14 aptamers could be used to understand molecular mechanisms of USP14 activity and Ub homeostasis in cells.",
