Dysbiosis, caused by disruption of the gastrointestinal microbiota, is known to predispose rabbits to rabbit enteritis complex (REC), a major cause of morbidity and mortality. The objectives of this study were to describe the fecal microbiota of domestic rabbits from a variety of settings (commercial meat, companion, laboratory, and shelter) and to identify how factors such as age, season, and routine antimicrobial use affect the fecal microbiota composition.",

In all sample types, the predominant bacterial phylum was Firmicutes. Other commonly identified phyla (composing \u2265 1% of the total microbiota composition) were Verrucomicrobia, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes. Significant differences in composition were noted between commercial, companion, laboratory, and shelter rabbit samples for proportions of Verrucomicrobia (P < 0.01), Proteobacteria (P < 0.01), and Lentisphaerae (P = 0.01) within the total microbiota. Within the commercial meat rabbit samples, significant differences between the microbiota composition of growers (n = 42) and does (n = 44) were limited to one unclassified Firmicutes (P = 0.03) and no differences were identified at the phylum level. Significant differences were present between fecal samples taken from rabbits during the summer (n = 44) compared to the winter (n = 42), with Firmicutes (P = 0.04), Verrucomicrobia (P = 0.03), Proteobacteria (P = 0.02), Deinococcus-Thermus (P = 0.04), Armatimonadates (P = 0.003), and Actinobacteria (P = 0.03) forming significantly different proportions of the microbiota. The only significant difference in composition between those farms that routinely reported antimicrobial use and those that did not was in one unclassified Bacteroidetes (P < 0.05) and no differences were identified at the phylum level. Conclusions: Rabbit husbandry and diet, in addition to season, significantly influence the fecal microbiota composition of domestic rabbits, while age of the rabbit post-weaning has minimal impact.",

One of the most difficult aspects of managing rabbit digestion is maintaining the normal commensal gastrointestinal microbiota.

However, much is still unknown about initiating factors as infection with these organisms is not synonymous with disease and subclinical infection may occur with no overt clinical signs [7] . Most cases of enteritis in rabbits are caused by a combination of factors, including feeding of a low fiber diet, debility and overall health status, management-related stress, and age, along with the presence of one or more potentially pathogenic organisms [7] [8] [9] .",

With culture-independent sequencing Bacteroidetes are still reported as predominant in the intestinal tract of very young rabbits, but the predominant phylum in post-weaned and adult rabbits is Firmicutes, with Bacteroidetes accounting for only a small fraction [13] [14] [15] [16] .

Factors such as diet, husbandry, and seasonal effects have been demonstrated to have effects on the fecal microbiota in both humans and other animal species [17] [18] [19] , but have not been explored in rabbits. The objectives of this study were to characterize the microbiota of domestic rabbits kept in a variety of environments and to identify factors contributing to enteric microbiota variations using a culture-independent, high-throughput sequencing method. We hypothesized that significant fecal microbiota differences would be seen between commercial meat rabbits and domestic rabbits kept in other settings, largely because of differences in husbandry, including dietary composition, routine use of antimicrobials, and environmental management. Additionally, we hypothesized that these differences would be least significant between commercial meat rabbits and rabbits housed in a shelter environment (i.e., a facility where previously-owned animals have been surrendered for re-homing) due to the likely inconsistencies in the environment of both of these types of rabbits and diet (in the case of shelter rabbits), while differences would be most significant between commercial meat rabbits and both companion and laboratory rabbits due to more consistent environmental conditions, diet, care, and reduced infectious disease within these latter two groups of rabbits.",

Twelve of the 17 (70.6%) farms reporting routine antimicrobial use reported using \u2265 2 antimicrobials in combination, making statistical analysis of the data beyond the general category of \"routine antimicrobial use\" not feasible. Antimicrobials were not reported to be routinely used in any of the laboratory rabbits sampled, and antimicrobial use could not be confirmed for the companion or shelter rabbit samples; thus, results from these groups were also excluded from this analysis. Seventy-five pooled commercial meat rabbit fecal samples were compared on the basis of routine antimicrobial use following sequence filtering and the removal of nonresponders, 58/75 (77.3%) with routine antimicrobial use, with a subsample of 4577 sequences per sample. The only significant difference observed at all levels of taxonomic classification, aside from the phylum level where no significant differences were observed, was in one Bacteroidetes unclassified at the class level (P < 0.01 at all taxonomic levels), which was significantly higher in samples from farms where no routine antimicrobial use occurred (0.85, 0.75, 0.75, 0.57% at class, order, family, and genus levels, respectively) compared to when routine use did occur (0.29, 0.31, 0.30, 0.32%, respectively). No significant differences in community membership or structure were identified using Jaccard or Yue and Clayton trees with both the parsimony and unweighted UniFrac tests (p \u2265 0.29 for all tests); samples from farms that did not report routine use of antimicrobials can be seen as well-distributed amongst samples from farms that did in the PCoA in Fig. 2d .

The large number of animals sampled, combined with the variety of factors incorporated into the study, suggests that the results are applicable to rabbits in a variety of domestic settings. Consistent with previous cultureindependent sequencing studies, such as those conducted by Eshar and Weese [14] and Zhu et al. [16] , the predominant phylum identified in the rabbit fecal microbiota, regardless of source, age, season or reported antimicrobial use was Firmicutes. Within this phylum, the Clostridia were the most abundant class identified, of which the Ruminococcaceae and the Lachnospiraceae were the most abundant families present. While the prevalence of Firmicutes in our study is lower than that reported by Eshar and Weese (66% vs. 82%, respectively) , other studies report levels of Firmicutes varying between 61 and 82% with significant individual variation, suggesting that the relative abundance of Firmicutes in the rabbit enteric microbiota falls somewhere within this range [16, 20] . In addition to being identified as the predominant phylum present in the rabbit gut, Firmicutes has been described as the most abundant phylum in the gastrointestinal microbiota of most healthy adult mammals, including humans [21] [22] [23] [24] , emphasizing its likely importance as a commensal in GI health.",

The relative levels identified for these phyla are consistent with previous reports, although proportions of Verrucomicrobia appear to vary considerably with the method of analysis [14, 16, 20, 25] . While Verrucomicrobia is still a relatively newly-defined group of organisms, Akkermansia (within this phylum) has been suggested to have a key role in hydrolysis of diverse ingested polysaccharides, contributing to more complete digestion of dietary cellulose as well as methane metabolism [26] [27] [28] . Thus, its presence as an important constituent of the rabbit fecal microbiota is unsurprising. The most well-known species in this genus is Akkermansia muciniphila, a mucindegrading bacterium that has been demonstrated to be beneficial in both human and animal health [29, 30] . For example, increases in the proportion of fecal Akkermansia mucinophila have been associated with a healthier metabolic status in both humans and mice [29, 30] . While the impact of Akkermansia muciniphila on rabbit health is still unknown, it is known that the ability to breakdown mucin is especially important during cecotrophy for optimal nutrient extraction [8] . In vitro studies have also identified a positive correlation between the proportion of Verrucomicrobiaceae and concentrations of proprionate and acetate, volatile fatty acids that are found in high concentrations within rabbit ceca following the breakdown of fiber-rich carbohydrates, and significant energy sources [20, 31] . Akkermansia mucinophila levels have also been inversely correlated with several inflammatory markers in mice [32] , indicating that a decrease in Akkermansia mucinophila levels may result in a more pro-inflammatory gut environment. A decreased proportion of Verrucomicrobia within the fecal microbiota of commercial meat rabbits overall, and particularly during the summer months, as found in this study, suggests less optimal gut health and nutrient extraction in this group of rabbits, as well as a pro-inflammatory state. This most likely reflects the lack of hay in the diet of commercial meat rabbits, compared to rabbits from other sources, as well as metabolic distress potentially due to heat stress, discussed in further detail below.",

Relative increases in Proteobacteria with or without a concurrent reduction in Firmicutes have been observed in several species in cases of metabolic gastrointestinal disorders, such as geneticallyrelated and diet-induced obesity [34, 35] , as well as in chronic intestinal inflammation, such as inflammatory bowel disease and ulcerative colitis [36, 37] . It is hypothesized that the resultant bacterial population shift caused by increasing relative proportions of Proteobacteria stimulates the host gastrointestinal immune system, resulting in a pro-inflammatory response [38] . Therefore, the increased relative proportion of Proteobacteria observed within commercial meat rabbits overall, and specifically during the summer, suggests a shift away from the normal gut microbiota in these animals, increasing their risk for disease development. This idea is supported by the higher proportion of potentially pathogenic bacteria associated with REC identified in commercial meat rabbit fecal samples overall as well as in the summer at the OTU level. In both cases, elevations in Escherichia/Shigella accounted for significant differences in fecal microbiota composition when compared to feces from rabbits from other sources.",

This is consistent with previous reports suggesting that the rabbit fecal microbial community rapidly reaches a steady state at, or just after, weaning [20] . This stabilization has been observed in several other species, including mice [39] and pigs [40] . Additionally, no significant differences were observed between samples from farms in which antimicrobials were routinely used compared to farms where they were not. In 2007, Abecia et al. examined the effects of bacitracin and tiamulin on the cecal microbiota of lactating rabbit does. The study demonstrated that significant microbiota compositional changes were highly dependent on the specific antimicrobial used, with bacitracin having minimal effects on the cecal microbiota composition and tiamulin causing significant changes [41] . In the current study, a variety of antimicrobials with different pharmacologic mechanisms were reported in use alone or in combination, including those with anticoccidial activity and those used to treat respiratory disease. Effects of specific agents on the gut microbiota may have been masked by the concurrent use of other antimicrobial agents; additional studies into the effects of specific antimicrobial agents on the microbiota composition will help to differentiate those antimicrobials likely to have a significant effect versus those that have minimal effect.",

            "text": "Several factors that may contribute to gut microbiota composition are thought to differ significantly between domestic rabbit sourcesin particular, the diet. Once animals are weaned, commercial meat rabbits are almost exclusively fed extruded pellet diets relatively low in fiber (15-20%) and high in carbohydrates to encourage rapid growth prior to slaughter [42] . This contrasts with recommended feeding practices for companion rabbits, which suggest a high fiber hay-based diet (e.g., timothy hay) that is supplemented (< 5%) by lower fiber pellets to ensure that all nutritional requirements are met while optimizing gastrointestinal function [9, 43] . Companion rabbit owners also frequently supplement this recommended dietary regimen with other fiber-rich fruits and vegetables. While the diet of laboratory rabbits is also primarily that of high carbohydrate pellets, the fiber content of many of the commercially available laboratory diets tends to be closer to 25%. Laboratory rabbits are also frequently given hay and vegetables as enrichment, although generally at more restricted levels than companion rabbits, while the dietary history of domestic rabbits in shelters is largely unknown. There is also significant variation in how long these animals may have been in a shelter receiving a balanced diet. Dietary fiber source, content, and digestibility are critical components of the rabbit diet, in which changes are directly and significantly correlated with enteritis and mortality in growing meat rabbits [44, 45] . It was beyond the scope of this study to evaluate specific changes in dietary fiber source, content, and type in relation to the rabbit fecal microbiota; however, this likely contributes to the majority of differences noted in microbiota between commercial meat and other sources of rabbits and is an area of further investigation.",

The seasonal changes in the microbiota of Arctic ground squirrels observed in the Stevenson et al. 2014 study were attributed to diet availability and variation between seasons. In the current study, seasonality was only examined in commercial meat rabbits, in which the diet remains relatively consistent with fixed content proportions year-round (although changes in plant source and feed quality may vary from batch to batch). Thus, it is unlikely that the seasonal changes in relative abundance of different phyla were related to diet. Rabbits are much more tolerant of colder temperatures and low humidity and they are especially prone to heat stress [9, 46] . In general, Canadian rabbit barns do not have environmental controls for temperature or relative humidity and rabbits are exposed to hot and humid ambient conditions in July and August. The relative reduction in levels of the two beneficial phyla (Firmicutes and Verrucomicrobia), and the relative increase in less beneficial phyla (Proteobacteria) could relate to seasonal-related climate changes and directly impact rabbit health, susceptibility to enteritis, and possibly feed conversion efficiency. Additional studies are needed to explore these possibilities. Studies of potential seasonal differences in gut microbiota of rabbits from other sources are also needed.",

An additional PCR was conducted with the following conditions: 1) 3 min at 94\u00b0C, 2) 45 s at 94\u00b0C, 3) 60 s at 50\u00b0C, 4) 1.5 min at 72\u00b0C, and 5) 10 min at 72\u00b0C. Steps 2-4 were repeated for a total of 8 cycles completed. Again, the second PCR product was purified using AMPure XP using a similar procedure to that described above, with 40uL of AMPure XP and 37uL 10 mM Tris pH 8.5 Buffer. An evaluation of final products was completed using electrophoresis in 2% agarose gel, again observing for bands of the appropriate length.",

Any sequences containing long runs (> 8 bp) of holopolymers, as well as ambiguous base calls, sequences that did not align with the 16S rRNA gene V4 region, or that were identified as chimeras were also removed. Sequences from mitochondria, chloroplasts, Archaea, and eukaryotes were also removed. Sequences were binned into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at the 3% dissimilarity level using nearest neighbour clustering using open OTU picking. Comparison of relative abundances of different taxa was conducted using one-way ANOVAs within the JMP 12 Response Screening Platform (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Adjustment of p values to account for false discovery rate (FDR) was performed using the Benjamini-Hochberg technique. Analysis was performed both with facility (i.e., where the animal came from) named as a random effect and without. Follow-up post-hoc testing of taxa identified as significantly different between groups was conducted using the Steel-Dwass nonparametric test. Results were considered significant when adjusted P values were \u2264 0.05. Differences in microbiota composition based on age (fryers versus does) and season (summer versus winter), were calculated exclusively for commercial meat rabbits.For subsequent analysis, subsampling was performed to normalize sequence numbers. Good's Coverage was used to assess coverage to ensure that the microbial population was adequately represented within the samples. Population richness was assessed using Chao1 to identify the number of different organisms present within each sample and the inverse Simpson's index was used to describe population diversity to determine the abundance of the different organisms present within each sample. The Jaccard index (which measures community membership by comparing the number of shared OTUs, but not their abundance) and Yue and Clayton measure of dissimilarity (which measures community structure by examining shared OTUs and their relative abundances) were used to assess population dissimilarity and to create dendrograms to compare how closely related the microbial communities of each sample were to one another. These were compared between groups for source, age and season using unweighted UniFrac (which measures the phylogenetic distance between communities based on membership), as well as parsimony tests (which examines community membership similarily). Figures were created using FigTree (v1.4.2) (http://tree. bio.ed.ac.uk) and JMP 12. Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) was also performed to visualize data similarities and dissimilarities between microbial communities and figures were created in JMP 12. LEfse was also performed to identify OTUs that were differentially abundant between groups.",
