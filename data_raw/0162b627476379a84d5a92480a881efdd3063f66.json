All influenza type A viruses originate from aquatic birds and successful introduction of these avian viruses into the human population, by either direct adaptation or reassortment with already circulating human viruses, has led to influenza pandemics of historical significance (reviewed in [2] [3] [4] 5] ). Still, documented evidence of transmission of avian influenza viruses directly from birds to humans is rare, partly because species barriers restrict avian influenza virus infection of the epithelial cells of the human respiratory tract, the primary site of influenza virus infection and spread.",

            "text": "Influenza A viruses possess a hemagglutinin (HA) attachment protein that binds sialic acid residues to facilitate infection of target epithelial cells. The HA of human influenza viruses preferentially binds to terminal sialic acid (SA) residues with a2,6 linkages, whereas avian influenza viruses preferentially bind to SA with a2,3 linkages [6] [7] [8] [9] . The prevalence of a2,6 SA but paucity of a2,3 SA in the human respiratory tract has been considered to restrict infection by avian influenza viruses [10] . Recent reports, however, have detected significant levels of a2,3 SA on human airway epithelium both in vitro and ex vivo, including in nasopharyngeal and tracheobronchial tissue [11] [12] [13] [14] . This SA distribution also correlated with avian influenza virus infection in vitro and ex vivo and raised the possibility that avian viruses could infect the upper airways in vivo. Therefore, although it is universally accepted that human-to-human transmission of avian influenza viruses requires adaptation of HA to switch from a2,3 to a2,6 SA usage, the cumulative data published to date indicate that SA linkages and their respective distribution in the human airways are not the sole barrier to avian influenza virus infection [15] [16] [17] . Other host factors and viral genes are likely also important determinants of infectivity.",

Avian influenza viruses are adapted for replication in the avian enteric tract at 40-41uC . While the surface temperatures of the human respiratory tract are variable, a temperature gradient clearly exists in which the surface temperature of the proximal large airways (i.e., nasal and tracheal) average 32+/20.05uC while temperatures of the smaller, distal airways (i.e., bronchioles) are closer to that of the core body temperature, 37uC [18, 19] . While multiple transmission routes have been described for influenza viruses, the proximal airways likely represent a predominant site for human influenza virus inoculation as they provide a large exposed surface area of virus-susceptible epithelial cells [20] . These cells are directly accessible by large droplet aerosols and by way of digital inoculation of the nasopharynx and conjunctival mucosa [12, 21] . Inefficient infection by avian influenza viruses, even in the presence of a2,3-linked SA, may be due to the cooler temperature of the proximal airways compared to that of the distal airways/lung regions where H5N1 avian influenza viruses appear to replicate efficiently [22] .",

Lysine substitution at residue 627 of H5N1 viruses improved virus replication in mice [24] .

This model closely mimics the morphological and physiological features of the human airway epithelium in vivo and has been previously used to investigate infection by diverse respiratory viruses [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . In humans, ciliated airway epithelium is present throughout the airways, extending from the nasal cavity and large proximal airways into the distal bronchiolar airway regions. Previously, we have shown that both human and avian influenza viruses replicate well in HAE and that human and avian influenza virus cell tropism correlates with the respective distribution of the specific sialic acid linkages [13] . However, these previous studies were conducted at 37uC, reflecting conditions encountered in the distal airways [13] . Others have also utilized these airway cell systems to characterize influenza virus replication of wild-type and recombinant viruses at 35uC [14, 31, 32] . In the present study, we utilize the HAE model, in combination with influenza virus reverse genetics, to investigate the influence of temperature on human and avian influenza virus infection, replication and spread. We demonstrate that, compared to human influenza viruses, avian influenza viruses are severely restricted for infection of human airway epithelium at the temperature of the human proximal airways. Then, using different strategies to 'avianize' human influenza viruses, we show that the temperature restriction of avian viruses is closely associated with the avian HA and NA glycoproteins.",

While transmission from birds to humans is rare, the introduction of novel avian influenza viruses into immunologically na\u00efve human populations has significant pandemic potential. Avian influenza viruses are adapted for growth at 40uC, the temperature of the avian enteric tract. However, the human proximal airways, the likely site of initial inoculation by influenza viruses, are maintained at a cooler temperature (32uC), suggesting that zoonotic transmission may be limited by temperature differences between the two hosts. Using an in vitro model of human ciliated airway epithelium, we show that avian influenza viruses grow well at 37uC, a temperature reflective of distal airways, but are restricted for infection at 32uC. A panel of genetically manipulated human influenza viruses possessing avian or avian-like surface glycoproteins were also restricted at 32uC, but not 37uC, suggesting that avian virus glycoproteins are not adapted for efficient infection at the temperature of the proximal airways. Thus, avian influenza virus infection is restricted in the human proximal airways due to the cooler temperature of this region, thus limiting the likelihood of zoonotic and subsequent human-to-human transmission of these viruses. culture surface. Figure 1B indicates that substantial increases in AK levels, indicative of the onset of CPE, are first detected at 48 hrs pi for A/Victoria/3/75 at 32uC and 37uC and A/Dk/ Eng/62 at 37uC. This induction of AK coincided with peak viral titer for these viruses under these conditions (compare Figure 1A and 1B) and suggested that the loss of titer correlated with the onset of CPE. Increasing levels of AK between 48 and 96 hrs pi were directly associated with continually decreasing viral titers, further supporting this claim.",

Since viral titer and AK levels could be related to the numbers of cells infected and/or the degree of virus replication within individual cells we compared titers of human and avian influenza viruses ( Figure 1A ) to the numbers of cells infected by each virus at the two temperatures over time. Immunodetection of viral antigen in inoculated HAE showed that human and avian influenza virus antigen was not detected 3 hrs pi, indicating that levels of antigen in residual viral inocula were below the limit of antibody detection (data not shown). For A/Victoria/3/75, a few isolated cells were positive for viral antigen by 6 hrs pi at 37uC, but by 24 hrs pi considerable numbers of antigen-positive cells were detected ( Figure 2A ). In agreement with our growth curves in Figure 1A , A/Victoria/3/75 infected slightly fewer cells at 32uC compared to 37uC at 24 hrs pi, but importantly, A/Victoria/3/75 spread efficiently within the epithelium at both temperatures and differences in infection at early time points became less significant over time ( Figure 2A) .",

Thus, an apparently small difference in titer as is seen at 24 hrs pi between A/Victoria/ 3/75 and A/Dk/Eng/62 at 37uC may correspond to a larger difference in the number of cells positive for viral antigen. While our staining also confirmed previous data that avian influenza viruses infect fewer human airway epithelial cells in comparison to human influenza virus at 37uC (Figure 2A ; [13] ), the limited extent of A/Dk/Eng/62 antigen positive cells at 37uC by 24 hr pi was still unexpected given that titers at this time were slightly greater than those for A/Victoria/3/75 at 32uC. Whether this represents a difference in yield of infectious virus per infected cell between human and avian viruses is presently not clear. Overall, A/Dk/ Eng/62 grew and spread well at 37uC, but was severely restricted for growth at 32uC and antigen positive cells were barely detectable before 48 hr pi for this virus at lower temperature.",

Further evaluation of histological cross-sections indicated that A/Victoria/3/75 infection at 37uC, which had the highest and earliest induction of AK, resulted in the earliest evidence of morphological injury at 72 hrs pi. HAE infected with A/Victoria/3/75 at 32uC or 37uC or A/Dk/Eng/62 at 37uC all showed desquamation of the superficial layer of columnar epithelial cells with basal epithelial cells remaining attached to the matrix support by 120 hrs pi ( Figure 2B ). Similar cytopathology has been reported for A/Udorn/307/72 influenza virus infection of HAE in vitro and for clinical human influenza virus infection in vivo [29, 33] . The detection of AK in apical washes of A/Dk/Eng/62-infected HAE at 32uC suggested that this virus did eventually compromise cellular integrity at the lower temperature, but dramatic morphological effects were not seen at least for up to 120 hrs ( Figure 1B and 2B). It should be noted, however, that at 120 hrs pi, A/Dk/Eng/62-infected HAE at 32uC did display some morphological characteristics different from uninfected and infected HAE at earlier time-points. Preliminary assessment indicates that expansion of lateral spaces between the columnar epithelial cells had occurred. Although we do not know the significance of these morphological changes, we speculate these observations are the initiation of CPE that will ultimately result in similar cellular injury as seen for this virus at 37uC and human viruses at both temperatures.",

By 72 and 120 hrs pi considerable loss of cells from the culture was evident and this correlated with the drop off in viral titers at these time points ( Figure 1A ). Thus, we conclude that in the context of maximal infection in which there were no additional target cells available for infection within the finite surface area of the HAE culture, ongoing replication in antigen-positive cells shown at 48 and 72 hrs pi resulted in increased cell death. This CPE led to a reduction in the number of viable, virus-producing cells and in turn, to a reduction in progeny virus. Although A/Dk/Eng/62 induced CPE when sufficient titers were generated at 37uC, one consequence of restricted replication of this avian influenza virus at 32uC was a reduction in overt CPE in HAE, even at later time points associated with considerable viral titers.",

Growth of both humanderived influenza viruses tested, A/Eng/26/99 (H3N2) and A/ Udorn/307/72 (H3N2), was not significantly different between 32/33uC and 37uC ( Figure 3A and 3B). Indeed, these two additional human influenza virus strains showed even less difference in titer between temperatures than was determined for A/Victoria/3/75. Assessment of growth of avian influenza virus, A/Dk/Sing/97 (H5N3), over a 48 hr time course at 37uC showed similar growth kinetics to that of A/Eng/26/99 (H3N2), reaching titers of 7610 5 pfu/ml and 1.6610 6 pfu/ml, respectively ( Figure 3A and 3C). In contrast, at 32uC, A/Dk/Sing/97 (H5N3) failed to grow at all ( Figure 3C ). Clearly, the restriction of A/Dk/Sing/97 at 32uC compared to 37uC was an even more striking phenotype than A/ Duck/Eng/62. As the avian influenza virus strains used in this study were selected at random, with no selection for a temperature-dependent phenotype, we propose that low temperature restriction of avian influenza viruses, but not human influenza viruses, may be broadly characteristic of avian influenza viruses. The extent of restriction, however, may be variable between different virus strains.",

We compared infection kinetics of H5N1 (A/VN/1203/04) at 33uC and 37uC on HAE using A/Udorn/ 307/72 in parallel cultures as a human influenza virus control. As described above, A/Udorn/307/72 grew with similar kinetics at 33uC and 37uC ( Figure 3B ). A/VN/1203/04, however, exhibited slower replication kinetics at 33uC when compared to that for 37uC ( Figure 3D ). Indeed, titers were significantly decreased at 33uC vs. 37uC at 24, 48 and 72 hrs pi. In addition, only at 37uC did A/VN/1203/04 approach similar peak titers as the human A/ Udorn/307/72 virus by the end of the 72 hr time course ( Figure 3D ). Histological analyses of A/VN/1203/04-infected HAE at either temperature showed absence of obvious CPE in sharp contrast to A/Udorn/307/72 that obliterated the epithelium by 72 hrs pi ( Figure 3E ). The lack of obvious CPE after H5N1 infection contrasts reports that H5N1 induced extensive apoptosis in mammalian airway cells [35, 36] . The fact that we did not observe obvious CPE with this highly pathogenic virus warrants further investigation but is in line with the limited cell damage shown following infection with A/Dk/Eng/62 for 72 hrs ( Figure 2B ). In sum, using diverse examples of human and avian influenza viruses we have shown that avian influenza viruses, but not human influenza viruses, are restricted for infection and growth in HAE at the lower temperature of 32uC.",

            "text": "Previously, the polymerase subunit PB2 has been shown to play an important role in host range restriction of avian influenza viruses in mammalian cells [37] [38] [39] . In influenza virus strains that circulate in humans, amino acid residue 627 in PB2 is a lysine, whereas in the majority of avian strains it is a conserved glutamic acid residue. The presence of glutamic acid at PB2 627 (avian-like) has been reported to account for the lower replication of avian influenza strains in mammalian cells and has been linked with reduced polymerase activity at lower temperature (33uC) in some cell systems [23, 24] . To assess the potential impact of this PB2 amino acid residue in restriction of avian influenza viruses at 32uC, we generated a recombinant A/Victoria/3/75 virus containing the PB2 K627E mutation and compared its growth with that of the isogenic wild-type virus in HAE at 32uC and 37uC. The K627E mutation resulted in restriction of the virus at both temperatures (Figure 4Ai ), and although titer at 32uC was 1.3 logs lower than at 37uC at 24 hrs pi, this difference was no greater than the differences in growth for wild-type virus at these temperatures (1.5 logs; Figure 4Ai ). Moreover, at the later time points analyzed, 48 and 72 hrs pi, the PB2 mutant did not show a significant difference in titer between the two temperatures. These data indicate that the K627E mutant virus was restricted for growth in HAE but that restriction was not temperature-dependent. Indeed, quantification of the numbers of infected cells identified by en face staining revealed that the K627E mutant virus infected a similar percentage of cells compared to wild-type virus at 24 hrs pi ( Figure 4Aii ) and that the mutant was capable of spread since new cells were infected by 48 hrs with similar kinetics to that of wildtype A/Victoria/3/75 at both 32uC and 37uC (Figure 4Aii ). Statistically, there was no difference between the wild-type and PB2 mutant viruses at either 32uC or 37uC at 48 hrs pi with respect to percent influenza virus-antigen positive epithelium. Together, these data suggest that the amino acid residue at PB2 627 influences viral fitness in HAE, but does not confer to a human virus the temperature-dependent phenotype of avian influenza virus infection in human ciliated airway epithelium.",

Several events in the viral life cycle that are critical for spread, including release of progeny virions from previously infected cells and attachment and entry into new target cells, are mediated by influenza virus glycoproteins. Thus, we hypothesized that glycoprotein function could be responsible for the restricted infection of HAE by avian influenza viruses at the lower temperature of 32uC. To test whether HA and/or NA contributed to the restricted phenotype of avian influenza viruses at 32uC, we used reverse genetics to generate mutant viruses genetically altered to confer avian virus-like glycoprotein specificities on the A/Victoria/3/75 background.

Specifically, a 2.5 log decrease in virus growth was determined for Vic-226-228HA at 32uC compared to 37uC at the 24 hr time point (Figure 4Bi ).

Together these data suggest that avianizing either the HA or NA glycoprotein of an otherwise human influenza virus limits spread and subsequent infection at 32uC compared to 37uC.",

To eliminate the possibility that the restriction we observed with these recombinant viruses was due to an imbalance between the activities of the surface glycoproteins that were not evolutionarily optimized, we next generated reassorted influenza viruses on a common genetic background, possessing human or avian glycoproteins with co-evolved pairings. This was achieved using human recombinant A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) in which the wild-type H1 and N1 glycoproteins were replaced by the H3 and N2 glycoprotein pair from A/Victoria/3/75 (generating PR8+Vic HA/NA) or the H7 and N1 glycoprotein pair from A/Chick/ Italy/1347/99 (generating PR8+Chick HA/NA, previously termed RD3) [41] . Since we and others have shown differential cell-type tropism between human and avian influenza virus in HAE [13, 14] , we next determined if avianizing the human virus HA by mutation or substitution (in the presence or absence of an avian NA) recapitulated the cell-type tropism exhibited by wholly avian influenza viruses in HAE. As shown by immunofluorescent detection in histological sections of infected HAE, PR8 containing A/Victoria/3/75 glycoproteins infected both ciliated and nonciliated cells in HAE with a tropism similar to wild-type A/ Victoria/3/75 ( Figure 5 ). In contrast, A/Victoria/3/75 with two avian-like amino acid substitutions in HA and PR8+Chick HA/ NA only infected ciliated cells, a tropism that was mirrored by wholly avian virus [13, 14] . These data clearly show that the ciliated cell tropism of avian influenza viruses is dictated by properties of the viral glycoproteins. These results correlate with the known increased sialic acid binding preference of avian HA for a2,3-linked SA, and to the presence of a2,3-linked SA on ciliated cells in HAE [8, 13, 14] .",

In the present study, mutating position 627 in a human virus PB2 to an avian virus conserved residue resulted in growth restriction at both 32uC and 37uC, suggesting that this residue is important for general viral fitness in HAE, but is not responsible for the differences in infection seen at 32uC vs. 37uC. Two recent reports also found that viruses with 627E in PB2 were attenuated regardless of temperature in human bronchial epithelial cells and MDCK cells, respectively, although in other cell systems including human small airway epithelial cells, a temperature specific effect was found [24, 42] . It should be emphasized that those studies were performed in non-differentiated epithelial cells unlike our studies that use human differentiated airway epithelial cells. We and others have previously shown that differentiated airway epithelial cell models enable discrimination of attenuated phenotypes of respiratory virus infection whereas non-differentiated cells do not [26, 27, 43] . In addition, we also show using HAE, that the H5N1 strain A/VN/1203/04, which possesses a lysine at position 627 (human adaptation), is still restricted for growth at 32uC, albeit less so than avian influenza viruses that have never infected humans. The attenuation in HAE of this H5N1 isolate which possesses a ''human'' amino acid at residue 627 in PB2 suggests other residues in the polymerase subunit or other viral proteins altogether are involved in temperature sensitivity of avian influenza viruses.",

In our study, we generated recombinant influenza viruses based on the A/Victoria/ 3/75 or A/PR/8/34 genetic backbone that were engineered to contain avian-like and/or avian glycoproteins and characterized infection in HAE. Kinetic studies showed that although human influenza viruses that possessed avian or avian-like surface glycoproteins were modestly restricted compared to wild-type viruses at 37uC, these mutant viruses were able spread like wildtype viruses throughout HAE at this temperature. Wide-spread infection throughout HAE was even observed for viruses in which their endogenous HA was replaced or mutated to preferentially bind a2,3 SA, restricting tropism to ciliated cells. Efficient replication of Vic-226-228HA at 37uC in our studies corroborates previous work by Matrosovich and colleagues in which little effect of HA-specificity 'switching' on replication was noted unless a very low MOI (0.00004) was used for inoculation [44] . In contrast, Wan and Perez described more profound differences in replication in HAE at 37uC with recombinant viruses that differed only in their receptor specificity [31] . However, it should be noted that their recombinant viruses were based on an H9N2 avian strain that yielded relatively low titers, and their initial infections were performed at 35uC before incubating at 37uC [31] .",

The contribution of a2,3 SA usage to replication of influenza viruses investigated by Hatta et al. in the upper respiratory tract of mice may have been masked in the mouse model (the 627 mutation in PB2 being more apparent) as mice express solely avian virus-like receptors (a2,3 SA) in their airways [46] . Restriction of a2,3 SA-binding viruses in HAE at 32uC was not due to a discrepancy in SA expression since HAE maintained at either 32uC or 37uC expressed similar levels of a2,6 and a2,3 SA (as detected by Sambucus nigra (SNA) and Maackia amurensis (MAA) lectin staining, respectively; data not shown).",

Using standard laboratory assays that employ small monovalent soluble substrates for cleavage by NA (MUNANA), we were not able to demonstrate any temperature-dependent loss of NA activity associated with either human or avian virus (data not shown). However, the ability of the avian virus NA to cleave biologically relevant substrates present in HAE may be compromised at 32uC vs. 37uC restricting both initial infection and subsequent spread of the virus throughout the epithelium.

The ability of A/Victoria/ 3/75 viruses with mutations or substitutions in either the HA or NA alone to infect similar numbers of cells and replicate to comparable peak titers as for wild-type virus at 37uC implies that these viruses were not crippled by the mismatch between the specificities of their HA and NA. Replication and spread of influenza viruses that possess an avian HA paired with its ''matched'' NA was even more compromised than that of recombinant viruses with individual changes to levels seen with wholly avian viruses.

Given these results, we draw attention to other recently published data using the HAE model in which mutations in viruses that are growth attenuated in vivo display similar growth attenuation in HAE but not in nondifferentiated cell lines, suggesting that HAE possess discriminating properties of attenuating phenotypes of mutants of respiratory viruses [26, 27] . Admittedly, in the present study, despite restriction in both growth and spread, wild-type avian viruses and human viruses with avian or avian-like glycoproteins did eventually reach high titer at 32uC at later time points. The efficiency of infection and replication of a virus that inoculates the airway epithelium, however, is likely a critical factor in determining whether the virus is capable of establishing infection in a host that normally possesses innate and adaptive immune systems that attempt to limit virus infection and spread. At temperatures of the distal airways, avian influenza viruses displayed similar infection kinetics as human influenza viruses and would therefore, in the case of sufficient inoculum reaching these distal regions, be as likely to establish infection. Indeed, the clinical pathology findings for humans infected with H5N1 do report distal airway infection in ciliated bronchioles and lung regions [22] . Under these conditions of inoculation and infection, avian influenza viruses present in the distal airways may still be unable to spread to proximal airway regions without additional adaptation to cooler temperatures. One caveat of this prediction is that virus may be transported to proximal airway regions by innate mucus clearance mechanisms indicating that caution is required when attempting to identify proximal infection by viruses in airway secretions obtained from tracheal swabs.",

Since the ciliated airway epithelium of the proximal airways is a major portal for influenza virus infection and spread, accessible by multiple inoculation routes (e.g., ocular, nasopharyngeal or aerosol), the inability of avian influenza viruses to establish infection and spread in these regions would be predicted to reduce the frequency of successful zoonotic transmission. Furthermore, the ability of human influenza viruses to generate high viral titers in the human proximal airways is likely a factor in effective human-to-human transmission and the induction of airway epithelial cell cytotoxicity as shown in this study may increase particulate matter perhaps associated with virus that facilitates inoculation of new hosts. Rapid induction of cytotopathic effects by human, but not avian, influenza virus infection at the temperature of the human proximal airways may also contribute to the onset of other host defenses such as sneezing and coughing that facilitate clearance of particulate matter/virus from the airways and potentially promote transmission between human hosts.",

Luminescence detected in samples from infected HAE were normalized to uninfected HAE and expressed as fold change over AK measured in uninfected (mock) HAE. Morphological assessment of cytotoxicity in HAE was performed with paraformaldehyde (PFA, 4%)-fixed histological sections (5 mm) stained with hematoxylin and eosin.",

HAE were then fixed in 4% PFA and incubated with streptavidin-alexafluor 488 (Molecular Probes, Inc.; 1:500) applied to the apical surface to detect lectin binding. Immunohistochemistry HAE fixed in methanol:acetone, were probed en face with antibody against viral NP (Chemicon, Inc.; 1:100) and FITCconjugated goat anti-mouse IgG1 and IgG2a (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA; 1:500), then embedded in paraffin. Histological sections (5 mm) were prepared and reprobed for viral antigen using standard immunofluorescence protocols. Briefly, sections were bathed in 2.5% triton-X 100/ PBS++ for 30 min, blocked in 3% BSA/PBS++ and incubated with antibodies in 1% BSA/PBS++. Primary antibodies were antiviral NP (Chemicon, Inc., as above) and anti-alpha acetylated tubulin (Zymed Laboratories, Inc.; 1:2000), a marker for ciliated cells. Secondary antibodies were FITC-goat anti-mouse IgG2a and Rhodamine red-conjugated goat-anti-mouse IgG2b (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.; 1:500). Sections were prepared with FluorSave mounting media (EMD Chemicals, Inc.) and images captured using a Leica DMIRB inverted fluorescence microscope equipped with a cooled color chargecoupled-device digital camera (MicroPublisher; Q-Imaging, Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada).",

We note that in a small number of cases, there were only two treatment groups (defined by temperature) and fewer than eight time points. A heterogeneous autoregressive correlation structure of order one was assumed for the repeated measurements. A joint test of the interaction terms (21 degrees of freedom) provides an assessment of the hypothesis of no differences among the four treatment groups with respect to viral titer growth (log scale). Provided this test was significant, indicating some differences among the four growth curves, pair-wise differences between the three treatment groups versus the a priori specified reference group (generally the avian strain at the lowest temperature) were carried out for each time point, and significant differences at the 0.05 level were noted. No adjustments for inflated Type I error due to multiple comparisons were made. Missing observations were assumed to be missing completely at random, based on the fact that the investigators determined a priori to remove samples at specific time points during the experiment.",
