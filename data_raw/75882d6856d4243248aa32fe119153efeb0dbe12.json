One excellent example of this is hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection of the liver (1) . Interferon signaling drives the expression of multiple interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), which mediate viral clearance. ISGs, however, can also be induced by other factors, including inflammatory stimuli such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u2423) (2) . HCV infection, which induces chronic inflammation of the liver, is associated with high serum TNF-\u2423 (3, 4) . Interestingly, anti-TNF-\u2423 treatment has been shown to lead to an improved virologic response to IFN-\u2423/ribavirin antiviral therapy for HCV (5) , while other data show safety of combined treatment but no effect on HCV viral loads of HCV treatment-naive individuals (6) . The purpose of the present study is to define an important causal link between inflammation and the host hepatic innate immune response, with broad viral relevance.",

There is a dichotomous response to chronic HCV infection in the liver, and this response predicts who will and who will not respond to exogenous IFN-\u2423 treatment. In patients that do not respond to therapy with IFN/ribavirin, hepatocytes have strong preactivation of the IFN-response, with high expression of a subset of ISGs (7) (8) (9) . In patients exhibiting a sustained virologic response on therapy with IFN/ribavirin, tissue macrophages show a high expression of ISGs (7, 9) .

            "text": "In HCV infection, we have found that the ISG15/USP18 pathway is an important regulatory pathway. Both ISG15 and USP18 are ISGs that are strongly upregulated in the livers of IFN treatment-resistant patients (7) (8) (9) . ISG15 is a ubiquitin-like protein that is strongly upregulated by IFN and conjugates to multiple cellular proteins (12, 13) . USP18 is an ISG15-specific protease that is also upregulated by IFN-\u2423 (12, 13) . Both ISG15 and USP18 have been suggested to blunt type 1 IFN signaling (12, (14) (15) (16) . In addition to its ability to remove ISG15 from its conjugated proteins, USP18 has been shown to bind to the type 1 IFN receptor and blunt IFN signaling (15) . Upregulation of USP18 may represent a negative-feedback loop counteracting the effects of type 1 IFN. Furthermore, knockdown of USP18 increases both ISG induction and anti-HCV activity of IFN-\u2423 (14) , and data have shown that IFN-\u2423 treatment given to mice in vivo increases hepatic USP18 and blunts the effect of a subsequent dose of IFN-\u2423 (12) . The mechanisms controlling USP18 expression in the liver are poorly understood but will have relevance to understanding innate immune mechanisms in chronic viral infection.",

            "text": "Although the majority of work on USP18 has centered on its upregulation by type 1 IFN, interferon stimulated genes have multiple upregulatory stimuli other than IFN-\u2423 (2, 17) . For example, inflammatory stimuli, e.g., endotoxin and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), have been shown to upregulate USP18 in peritoneal exudate macrophages (18) . If similar stimuli lead to increased USP18 expression in hepatocytes, then this pathway could represent a novel link between inflammatory and innate immune responses in the liver. The present study is based on the hypothesis that liver inflammation will directly impact hepatocyte expression of USP18 and therefore will impact IFN signaling. This link will have relevance to multiple diseases, since inflammatory stimuli such as TNF-\u2423 and LPS have been shown to play roles in many liver diseases, including viral hepatitis (19) (20) (21) . The link may also help to explain our observations in chronic HCV infection, since chronic HCV infection is characterized by increased serum TNF-\u2423 (3, 4), increased hepatocyte USP18, and impaired IFN responsiveness (8) . Quite apart from HCV, the importance of the link between hepatic inflammation and innate immune response lies in the downstream effects of the impairment of innate immunity. We speculate that by blocking IFN-\u2423 signaling, USP18 expression may lead to an enhanced susceptibility to infection with interferon-sensitive viruses and enhanced viral proliferation. Support for this notion is found in a mouse study in which expression of USP18 in macrophages led to lower IFN responsiveness, leading to locally restricted replication of VSV (22) .",

In this study, we show that multiple inflammatory stimuli can modulate interferon stimulated gene expression and thus inhibit hepatocyte interferon signaling via USP18 induction. These findings represent a new paradigm for how inflammation alters hepatic innate immune responses, with the induction of USP18 representing a potential target for intervention in various inflammatory states."

Partial (70%) hepatic ischemia was induced for 60 min in mice, after which the surgical clamps were removed. Control (Sham) animals underwent anesthesia and laparotomy alone. Animals were euthanized 6 or 24 h after ischemia/reperfusion, the affected liver segments were removed, and target gene expression was determined by qPCR in whole liver tissue. LCMV strain WE was propagated in L929 cells (ATCC CCL-1) as previously described (36) . In additional experiments, after 60 min HIRI or sham laparotomy, mice were infected with 2 \u03eb 10 6 PFU of LCMV WE by intravenous tail vein injection. The ischemic liver lobes were harvested at day 7 postinfection. Snap-frozen liver tissue samples were homogenized in \u2423-MEM (Multicell, USA) supplemented with 5% FBS, L-glutamine, and 100 U of penicillin/ml plus 100 g of streptomycin/ml using the TissueLyser LT system (Qiagen, Netherlands). Viral titers were examined on MC57 cells (ATCC CRL-2295) using a focus-forming assay as previously described (37) . Statistical analysis. All data were analyzed using Prism version 5.0 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Statistically significant differences in Fig. 1E were calculated by using a two-tailed Student t test (Prism software). The impact of HIRI on LCMV replication (see Fig. 6A and B) was evaluated by one-way analysis of variance with the Tukey's post hoc test.",

We sought to determine whether inflammatory stimuli could increase USP18 expression in hepatocytes. Liver tissue inflammation is mediated by both proand anti-inflammatory stimuli, acting through diverse pathways. We therefore compared the effects of three proinflammatory stimuli (TNF-\u2423, LPS, and IL-6) and one anti-inflammatory stimulus (IL-10), all four signaling through independent receptors and signaling cascades (38, 39) . In a 24-h time course experiment, USP18 mRNA expression was measured after stimulation with LPS (100 ng/ml), TNF-\u2423 (20 ng/ml), IL-6 (100 ng/ml), or IL-10 (10 ng/ml). USP18 mRNA expression was induced by TNF-\u2423 and LPS but not by IL-6 or IL-10 ( Fig. 1A) . Meanwhile, neither TNF-\u2423 nor LPS treatments had a marked effect on Mx1 mRNA expression (Fig. 1B) , indicating that the effects we observe are not due to a generalized upregulation of ISGs or to type 1 IFN signaling. TNF-\u2423 and LPS treatment also led to augmented USP18 protein expression by Western blotting (Fig. 1C ) and by intracellular staining (Fig. 1D to F). Treatment of Huh7.5 cells with TNF-\u2423 or LPS induced expression of USP18 in 74.1% \u03ee 8.9% and 70.5% \u03ee 5.2%, respectively, compared to untreated controls in which USP18 expression was 31.0% \u03ee 4.7% (Fig. 1Fi) . USP18 induction was also demonstrated with a significant shift in the mean fluorescence intensity of USP18 staining after TNF-\u2423 or LPS simulations (Fig. 1Fii ). In these assays, the degree of protein expression did not correlate completely with mRNA expression, a finding that is consistent with many genes in the liver (40) in that the degree of mRNA induction was higher than the observed USP18 protein expression. However, the functional effects we observed in terms of IFN-\u2423 responses were robust.",

Huh7.5 cells were treated with TNF-\u2423 (20 ng/ml) or LPS (100 ng/ml) for 24 h. The cells were subsequently treated with IFN-\u2423 for 6 h.

Control cells were left untreated, followed by a 6-h IFN-\u2423 treatment at 24 h. After the 6-h IFN-\u2423 treatment, the cells were harvested, and Mx1 expression was measured by qPCR as a measure of IFN-inducible gene expression. As expected, a 6-h exposure to IFN-\u2423 strongly induced Mx1 expression, whereas a 24-h exposure to TNF-\u2423 and LPS did not (Fig.  2, columns 2, 3, and 5 ). Both TNF-\u2423 and LPS pretreatment inhibited the effect of 6 h of exposure to IFN-\u2423 (Fig. 2, columns  2, 4, and 6 ), indicating that IFN-\u2423 signaling was impaired in the presence of these inflammatory stimuli.",

We addressed this question by selective knockdown of USP18 mRNA. Thus, Huh7.5 cells transfected with USP18 siRNA or control siRNA were treated with LPS (100 ng/ml), TNF-\u2423 (20 ng/ml), and/or IFN-\u2423 (100 IU/ml) for 2 h or pretreated with LPS (100 ng/ml) or TNF-\u2423 (20 ng/ml) for 24 h and then either left untreated or treated with IFN-\u2423 (100 IU/ml) for 2 h (a 2-h time point was selected for optimal expression of pSTAT1 in Huh7.5 cells). The expression of pSTAT1, STAT1, and ISG15 conjugates (as a marker of USP18 knockdown), USP18, and actin was detected by Western blotting. As seen in Fig. 3A , USP18 expression was largely knocked down in cells transfected with USP18 siRNA. IFN-\u2423-induced phosphorylation of STAT-1 was inhibited by pretreatment (for 24 h) with TNF-\u2423 or LPS (Fig. 3A , siRNA control lanes f and h versus lane d), but this effect is reversed by knockdown of USP18 (Fig. 3A , siRNA USP18, lanes f and h versus lane d). Of note, USP18 knockdown did not increase pSTAT1 in response to IFN-\u2423 before 24 h; these findings are consistent with previous observations (12) . We next wanted to confirm whether our findings from hepatoma cells would hold true in primary mouse hepatocytes. With this in mind, primary murine hepatocytes from USP18 \u03e9/\u03e9 mice were isolated, transfected with USP18 siRNA or control siRNA, and then exposed to IFN-\u2423 (100 IU/ml), LPS (100 ng/ml), or TNF-\u2423 (20 ng/ml) for 24 h. After a washing step, the cells were treated with IFN-\u2423 for an additional 6 h. Mx1 ISG mRNA expression was measured by qPCR (normalized to expression of the HPRT housekeeping gene) as an index of downstream IFN-\u2423 effect. IFN-\u2423, LPS, and TNF-\u2423 treatment blocked the effect of the final dose of IFN-\u2423 (Fig. 3B, columns 2, 3, 5, and 7) . However, knockdown of USP18 reversed this effect and augmented the effect of IFN-\u2423 (Fig.  3B, columns 9, 10, 12, and 14) . The data from this experiment are consistent with those obtained with human Huh7.5 cells (data not shown). Thus, the ability of TNF-\u2423 and LPS to block IFN signaling is seen in both primary and immortalized hepatocytes.",

To determine whether the USP18-dependent blunting of hepatocyte IFN signaling was due to its ability to strip ISG15 from its conjugates, we blocked the process of ISGylation by knockdown of the ISG15 E1 enzyme, UBE1L. Murine hepatocyte UBE1L was knocked down via transfection with siRNA specific for UBE1L. USP18 \u03e9/\u03e9 murine hepatocytes transfected with UBE1L siRNA or control siRNA were stimulated with IFN-\u2423 (100 IU/ml), LPS (100 ng/ml), or TNF-\u2423 (20 ng/ml) for 24 h and then treated with an additional dose of IFN-\u2423 for 6 h. Knockdown was measured in the hepatocytes transfected with UBE1L siRNA by Western blotting probing for UBE1L expression and ISG15 conjugate formation (Fig. 4A) . Next, to examine the effect of this knockdown on ISG induction, wild-type murine hepatocytes transfected with UBE1L siRNA or control siRNA were stimulated with TNF-\u2423 (20 ng/ml) and LPS (100 ng/ml) for 24 h and then restimulated with IFN-\u2423 (100 IU/ ml) for 6 h, at which time Mx1 ISG mRNA expression was measured by qPCR. As seen in Fig. 4A , UBE1L knockdown was achieved, resulting in a decrease in ISG15 conjugates. However, as seen in Fig. 4B , we observed that neither the presence nor the relative absence of ISG15 conjugation impacted the ability of TNF-\u2423 and LPS to block IFN-\u2423 signaling since there was no change in ISG expression after 6 h of IFN-\u2423 treatment when USP18 \u03e9/\u03e9 hepatocytes transfected with anti-UBE1L siRNA were compared to hepatocytes transfected with irrelevant siRNA (Fig.  4B , siRNA control, columns 2, 5, and 7, and UBE1L siRNA, columns 9, 12, and 14). These results are consistent with there being no role for ISGylation (and, thus, for the ability of USP18 to strip ISG15 from its protein conjugates) in the ability of TNF-\u2423 and LPS to block type 1 IFN signaling in hepatocytes, and this finding is in agreement with previous data showing that USP18 blocks IFN signaling independent of its enzymatic activity (15) .",

As observed in Fig. 3A , STAT1 phosphorylation shows distinct activation profiles with IFN-\u2423 stimulation compared to TNF-\u2423 or LPS stimulation (Fig. 3A , siRNA control and siRNA USP18, lanes b and c compared to lane d). Although these data strongly suggest that the effect of LPS and TNF-\u2423 stimulation are a result of direct induction of ISGs and not secondary to the induction of IFN-\u2423, we wanted to confirm whether LPS and TNF-\u2423 could induce type 1 or type 2 IFN (IFN-\u2423 or IFN-\u2425) in primary murine hepatocyte. Thus, primary murine hepatocytes were treated with IFN-\u2423 (100U/ml), LPS (100 ng/ml), or TNF-\u2423 (20 ng/ml) for 6, 12,18, or 24 h; they were then lysed and assessed for IFN-\u2423, IFN-\u2425, and USP18 expression by qPCR. We observed that neither IFN-\u2423, LPS, nor TNF-\u2423 induce much, if any, hepatocyte expression of IFN-\u2423 or IFN-\u2425, although the same doses induce strong expression of USP18 (Fig. 5) . Thus, the induction of ISGs by LPS and TNF-\u2423 is very unlikely to reflect the induction of hepatocyte type 1 or type 2 IFN, which suggests that the observed USP18 induction is not due to type 1 or type 2 IFN secretion and autocrine stimulation of the IFN-\u2423 receptor.",

We focused on small-molecule agents that have been linked to the NF-B signaling pathway, because of the central role of this pathway in inflammatory activation in response to a large number of inflammatory mediators, including LPS and TNF-\u2423 (42) . We were particularly interested in inhibitors, such as silibinin, that in addition have been linked to clinical suppression of hepatic viral production (in the case of silibinin and HCV) (43, 44) . Thus, we preincubated primary mouse hepatocytes for 30 min with various inhibitors of LPS and TNF-\u2423 signaling and measured their impact on USP18 induction, while simultaneously measuring expression of proinflammatory cytokine IL-1\u2424 mRNA, since NF-B is also known to promote IL-1\u2424 transcription (45, 46) . As seen in Fig. 7A and as Table 1 , TNF-\u2423 induced expression of USP18 was potently downregulated by all inhibitors tested, and this inhibition coincided with impaired IL-1\u2424 mRNA expression (Fig. 7B) . Meanwhile, only two inhibitors potently (\u03fe80%) inhibited USP18 expression as well as IL-1\u2424 mRNA expression in response to LPS stimulation; NSC33994 (an inhibitor of Jak2) and silibinin (an inhibitor of IKK\u2423) (Fig. 7A and B and Table 1 ). These data suggest that the induction of USP18 by TNF-\u2423 and LPS, and pos-sibly other inflammatory stimuli, is promoted by NF-\u232a signaling and that hepatocyte USP18 expression in particular-compared to IL-1\u2424-may be an attractive target for pharmacologic manipulation in the setting of liver inflammation.",

The cytokine specificity of our results is also consistent with finding that IL-6 alone is not able to induce USP18 in murine T cells (47) . Only when T cells were treated with IL-6 and another proinflammatory cytokine, such as transforming growth factor \u2424, IL-1\u2424, and IL-23, was USP18 expression induced (47) .

The binding of USP18 with the IFN-\u2423 receptor has been shown to inhibit the interaction of STAT-1 with the IFN-\u2423 receptor and thus block downstream IFN signaling (12, 15) . Our data are consistent with this mechanism, since the blunting of hepatocyte IFN signaling after exposure to inflammatory stimuli is independent of USP18-mediated removal of ISG15 from its target proteins. The degree of TNF-\u2423 and LPS-induced IFN-\u2423 refractoriness was not changed by UBE1L knockdown, although ISGylation was considerably reduced. However, other mechanisms may also be at play. Recent work has demonstrated that USP18 has the ability to deubiquitinate the transforming growth factor-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) complexes required for NF-B activation in T cells and that overexpression of USP18 leads to decreased nuclear activation and impaired formation of TAK1 complexes (47) . USP18-mediated NF-B inhibition may be of importance not only for T cell adaptive immunity but also for liver inflammation. The role of TAK1 in innate and adaptive immunity has been previously demonstrated (48) , and studies have also shown that TAK1 deletion interferes with hepatocyte homeostasis and leads to hepatic injury (49) . Thus, increased hepatocyte USP18 in response to inflammatory stimuli may constitute a negative-feedback cycle with relevance to multiple aspects of the liver's response to infection.",

The general finding that liver inflammation promotes LCMV production is in agreement with work showing that polymicrobial sepsis, characterized by high TNF-\u2423 and inflammation, leads to increased susceptibility to LCMV infection (50) . In our present study, hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury did not enhance LCMV production in USP18 knockout mice. These data are intended as proof-of-concept but do suggest that the role of USP18 in hepatic viral infection and inflammation deserves further investigation.",

            "text": "Our in vitro and in vivo findings suggest a new model for how inflammation alters hepatic innate immune responses. In this model, liver inflammation leads to increased hepatocyte USP18, which in turn makes the liver more susceptible to infections targeting the hepatocyte, such as HCV. This mechanism may help to explain the clinical observation that HCV infection of a transplanted, HCV-naive liver graft (that has gone through an ischemia/reperfusion cycle) is more aggressive than the original infection and that the severity of the reinfection correlates with the severity of the ischemia/reperfusion injury suffered during the transplant (51, 52) . However, we have also found that USP18 is necessary but not sufficient on its own to induce an IFN-\u2423 refractory state (53) . With this in mind, we hypothesize that the innate immune response and its ability to control IFN-sensitive viruses will depend on cumulative effect of multiple intrahepatic signals, including the induction of USP18. If these results are to be translated into a clinical setting, then one approach is to target USP18 induction pharmacologically. Using multiple inhibitors of TNF-\u2423/LPS signaling, we found that two inhibitors, silibinin (an inhibitor of IKK\u2423) and NSC33994 (a Jak2 inhibitor) possess the ability to inhibit TNF-\u2423 and LPS-induced USP18 expression and proinflammatory effects. These findings raise the possibility of pharmacologically targeting USP18 expression during inflammatory events to prevent the establishment of an IFN-\u2423 refractory state. Previously, inhibition of Jak2 signaling led to a protection of mouse livers from ischemic insult (54) . As well, silibinin has been shown to reduce of HCV liver graft reinfection (43) and enhance HCV clearance in IFN-\u2423 nonresponders (55) via multiple mechanisms, including by direct inhibition of HCV NS5B RNA polymerase (44) . USP18 modulation may be one mechanism by which silibinin exerts its anti-HCV effects.",

For example, we previously demonstrated that increased USP18 expression in the liver is and enhances LCMV replication. To examine the in vivo effect of an inflammatory stimulus on USP18 expression and viral replication, a hepatic ischemia/reperfusion model was used. (A) Partial (70%) hepatic ischemia was induced for 60 min, after which the portal vascular clamp was removed. Control animals (Sham) underwent anesthesia and a laparotomy alone. Animals were euthanized 6 and 24 h after ischemia/reperfusion (I/R), and the affected liver segments were removed. USP18 mRNA expression was determined by qPCR in whole liver tissue and normalized to hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) expression. Data are expressed as means \u03ee the SEM with n \u03ed 3 to 4 mice/group. A P value of \u03fd0.05 was considered significant. (B) After 60 min of HIRI or sham laparotomy, mice were infected with 2 \u03eb 10 6 PFU of LCMV WE. Liver lobes were harvested at day 7 postinfection. Viral titers were examined on MC57 cells using a focus-forming assay. Data are expressed as means \u03ee the SEM with n \u03ed 3 to 10 mice/group.

We propose that the ultimate USP18 expression is due to the liver's coordinate response to multiple stimuli.
