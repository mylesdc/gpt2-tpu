            "text": "The repair of white matter damage is of paramount importance for functional recovery after brain injuries. Here, we report that interleukin-4 (IL-4) promotes oligodendrocyte regeneration and remyelination. IL-4 receptor expression was detected in a variety of glial cells after ischemic brain injury, including oligodendrocyte lineage cells. IL-4 deficiency in knockout mice resulted in greater deterioration of white matter over 14 d after stroke. Consistent with these findings, intranasal delivery of IL-4 nanoparticles after stroke improved white matter integrity and attenuated long-term sensorimotor and cognitive deficits in wild-type mice, as revealed by histological immunostaining, electron microscopy, diffusion tensor imaging, and electrophysiology. The selective effect of IL-4 on remyelination was verified in an ex vivo organotypic model of demyelination. By leveraging primary oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), microglia-depleted mice, and conditional OPC-specific peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor gamma (PPAR\u03b3) knockout mice, we discovered a direct salutary effect of IL-4 on oligodendrocyte differentiation that was mediated by the PPAR\u03b3 axis. Our findings reveal a new regenerative role of IL-4 in the central nervous system (CNS), which lies beyond its known immunoregulatory functions on microglia/macrophages or peripheral lymphocytes. Therefore, intranasal IL-4 delivery may represent a novel therapeutic strategy to improve white matter integrity in stroke and other brain injuries.",

            "text": "The primary focus of stroke research has traditionally been on neuronal damage within gray matter, but emerging evidence reveals a robust correlation between white matter injury and long-term sensorimotor and cognitive deficits after stroke [1] . White matter accounts for approximately 60% of total brain volume in humans. It is composed mostly of bundled axons and glial cells, including myelin-producing oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and microglia. Large axons in the brain are enwrapped by the insulating myelin sheath, which greatly accelerates neural transmission along nerve fibers. White matter damage after stroke involves multiple mechanisms, including demyelination, degeneration of axons, and neuroinflammation [2] [3] [4] . The vulnerability of oligodendrocytes to ischemic injury and the resultant demyelination have been reported in numerous publications using different stroke models [5] [6] [7] [8] . Remyelination is a process whereby new myelin sheaths are generated around demyelinated axons in the adult central nervous system (CNS) after injuries. It is one of the critical regenerative mechanisms for white matter repair after brain injuries. The differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) into mature oligodendrocytes plays a central role in remyelination. OPCs are present in the normal adult brain [9] . Both the proliferation and migration of OPCs appear to increase in the adult ischemic brain [10], suggestive of endogenous efforts at remyelination and white matter repair. Cellular fate mapping studies have demonstrated the differentiation of OPCs toward the oligodendrocyte lineage in the ischemic brain, but the majority of these cells fail to develop into mature, functional oligodendrocytes [11] [12] [13] . As a result of this failure, white matter integrity after stroke shows little improvement over time [10] . Aside from these roadblocks, the efficacy of oligodendrocyte regeneration and axon remyelination also declines with age [14] . Without proper remyelination, naked axons are degraded, thereby interrupting neuronal communication and leading to functional disabilities. Therefore, therapeutic interventions to promote the differentiation of OPCs into mature oligodendrocytes and enhance the remyelination of axons are promising strategies to achieve successful white matter repair and functional recovery after stroke [11] .",

            "text": "Interleukin-4 (IL-4) is an anti-inflammatory cytokine produced by a variety of immune cells, but accumulating evidence indicates that IL-4 harbors functions beyond immune modulation in the CNS. For example, one early report suggested that IL-4 promoted learning and memory capacities in the normal brain [15] . This conclusion, however, was challenged by more recent studies demonstrating equivalent baseline cognitive functions between wild-type (WT) and IL-4 knockout (KO) genotypes [16, 17] . Instead, the IL-4 KO mice were shown to display anxiety-like behavior [17] . Despite these discrepancies in studies of IL-4 KO mice, the importance of IL-4 in maintaining or restoring neurological functions under pathological conditions is widely accepted. For example, the reduction of IL-4 levels with advanced age is thought to contribute to the cognitive decline in aged populations and in Alzheimer disease [18] . We previously documented increased expression of IL-4 and the IL-4 receptor in the ischemic brain [16] . IL-4 may be released from injured neurons and peripheral immune cells that have infiltrated the brain after stroke [19] . IL-4 deficiency exacerbates brain injury and neurological deficits in acute timeframes after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) [20] , implicating IL-4 as an endogenous protective mechanism in the early stages after stroke. We also reported that IL-4 deficiency significantly impairs long-term sensorimotor and cognitive performance after ischemic injury, whereas IL-4 supplementation improves functional outcomes in two models of stroke [16] . Although IL-4 deficiency increased the loss of NeuN + brain tissue at acute phases of stroke, it did not influence neuronal tissue loss at late stages [16] . These results suggest that the long-term beneficial role of IL-4 on neurological functions after stroke might be attributed to its protection of nonneuronal cells, such as white IL-4/PPAR\u03b3 signaling improves white matter repair after stroke PLOS Biology | https://doi.org/10.",

Intranasal delivery of IL-4 nanoparticles after stroke robustly promoted oligodendrogenesis, enhanced white matter integrity, and improved long-term functional recovery. Complementary studies in cell cultures and animals revealed that IL-4-mediated oligodendrogenesis was achievable even in the absence of microglia/macrophages in vitro or after microglia/macrophage significant depletion in vivo. Furthermore, IL-4 directly promoted OPC differentiation into mature oligodendrocytes in a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR\u03b3)-dependent manner. These collective findings suggest that activation of the IL-4/ PPAR\u03b3 signaling cascade may represent a novel recovery-enhancing strategy to promote longterm outcomes after ischemic stroke.",

Consistent with previous reports [15, 21] , IL-4R\u03b1 was expressed on CD45 \u2212 CD11b \u2212 GFAP + astrocytes, CD45 \u2212 CD11b \u2212 NeuN + neurons, CD45 intermediate CD11b + microglia, CD45 high CD11b + macrophages, and other infiltrated immune cells (CD45 + CD11b \u2212 ) 3 d after 60-min MCAO (Fig 1A and 1B) . Notably, IL-4R\u03b1 was also expressed in oligodendrocyte lineage cells (Fig 1A-1D ). Different markers, including A 2 B 5 , O4, and O1/galactocerebroside (GalC), were used to identify oligodendrocytes at different differentiation stages. IL-4R\u03b1 was detected in CD45 \u2212 CD11b \u2212 O4 + cells (Fig 1A-1D ), which were identified as preoligodendrocytes and premyelinating oligodendrocytes, and CD45 \u2212 CD11b \u2212 O1 + cells (Fig 1A and 1B) , which were identified as premyelinating oligodendrocytes or mature oligodendrocytes [22] . The percentages of IL-4R\u03b1 + O4 + cells were higher in the ipsilateral ischemic hemisphere (Fig 1C and 1D) , suggesting a potential direct effect of IL-4 on white matter cells. ImageStream analyses confirmed that IL-4R\u03b1 was expressed on both A 2 B 5 + OPCs and O4 + preoligodendrocytes/premyelinating oligodendrocytes, as well as CD11b + microglia/macrophages in the ischemic hemisphere ( Fig 1E and S1A-S1C Fig) .",

Additionally, the overall immunofluorescence of SMI32 increased in these three regions, resulting in a significant increase in the SMI32/MBP ratio in WT mice after stroke (Fig 1G) . IL-4-deficient mice displayed exacerbation of the loss in MBP ( Fig 1F) and a further increase in the SMI32/MBP ratio compared to WT mice (Fig 1G) , suggesting that IL-4 is important in maintaining axonal myelination or promoting axonal remyelination after stroke.",

In order to confirm the effect of IL-4 in white matter, we explored the remyelination capacity of IL-4 in a model of lysophosphatidylcholine/lysolecithin (LPC)-mediated demyelination using ex vivo organotypic cerebellar slice cultures. This toxicant-based experimental model of demyelination, although not attempting to fully mimic a disease with complex etiology and pathogenesis, has proven extremely useful for understanding the biology of remyelination [23] . Slices collected from WT and IL-4 KO mice exhibited comparable extents of demyelination, as revealed by the loss of MBP staining along neurofilamentheavy (NFH + ) axonal fibers, at 3 d after LPC (Fig 2A) . Partial remyelination was achieved by 7 d following LPC in WT brain slices, but IL-4 deficiency significantly delayed remyelination (Fig 2A and 2B) , as shown by lower MBP staining intensity ( Fig 2C) and less MBP + axonal coverage ( Fig 2D) .

The IL-4 nanoparticles were applied through the nasal route (50 \u03bcg/kg body weight), which has been increasingly utilized for CNS drug delivery because of its capacity to bypass the blood-brain barrier and avoid first-pass metabolism [24] . Intranasal administration of IL-4 nanoparticles effectively increased IL-4 protein levels in the corpus callosum (CC) and EC, cerebral cortex, and striatum 12 h after IL-4 application (Fig 3A-3C ). IL-4 remained elevated in cortex and striatum until 24 h after delivery (Fig 3B and 3C ).",

This trend was observed until day 35 in the ex vivo FA values (Fig 4C) . Further analysis of the 35 d DTI images revealed that IL-4 treatment enhanced white matter integrity, as revealed by elevated FA values in the white matter-enriched EC and internal capsule (IC) (Fig 4D, 4E and 4G ).

However, at later time points starting from 7-10 d after stroke, IL-4 treatment reduced the time spent touching and removing tapes in stroke mice, culminating in improved performance in the adhesive removal test (Fig 6A and 6B ). Long-term sensorimotor performance in the rotarod test after MCAO was also improved in IL-4-treated mice ( Fig 6C) . Furthermore, IL-4-treated mice exhibited long-term improvements in cognitive function in the Morris water maze test, as manifested by a reduction in the latency to find the hidden platform (improved spatial learning, Fig 6D and  6E ) and increased time spent in the target quadrant when the platform was removed (improved memory, Fig 6D and 6F ). There was no difference in swimming speed among different treatment groups, indicating similar gross motor skills across groups ( Fig 6G) .",

We observed in our model that IL-4 treatment robustly promoted microglia/macrophage polarization toward an anti-inflammatory phenotype (CD206 + Iba1 + ) at 7 and 14 d after stroke (S4 Fig). Microglia depletion through genetic targeting or pharmacological treatment is a widely used approach to evaluate the contribution of this population to various biological processes [29] . Therefore, we chose PLX5622, an inhibitor of colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor, to deplete microglia/macrophages and identify their role in IL-4-afforded oligodendrogenesis ( Fig 7E) [30] . Consistent with previous reports [30] , PLX5622 achieved approximately 90% depletion efficacy within a short period. Dietary intake of PLX5622 for 7 d dramatically reduced the number of microglia in the normal brain Significant depletion of microglia/macrophages did not change the number of BrdU + APC + cells or total BrdU + cells compared to microglia/macrophage-competent stroke mice (Fig 7F-7H ).

IL-4 treatment exhibited a trend (p = 0.086) toward lower capacities to increase the number of BrdU + APC + newly generated oligodendrocytes in microgliadepleted mice versus microglia-competent mice, supporting a potential role of microglia in IL-4-afforded oligodendrogenesis. Importantly, IL-4 treatment still resulted in a significant enhancement of BrdU + APC + oligodendrocyte regeneration in microglia/macrophagedepleted stroke mice (Fig 7F and 7G ). Considering the expression of IL-4R on oligodendrocyte linage cells, these results indicate that IL-4 may exert microglia/macrophage-independent effects on oligodendrocyte regeneration after demyelination.",

OPCs were treated with PBS or IL-4 (20 ng/mL) for 3 d. Total RNA extraction from cell pellets was used for the Affymetrix Clariom S rat array. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed clustering of samples in a treatment-dependent manner ( Fig 8D) . In total, 996 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified (false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.05; and fold change > 2), out of which 495 were up-regulated and 501 were down-regulated in IL-4-treated OPCs relative to PBS-treated OPCs (Fig 8E, S1 and S2 Tables). The gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was then performed using the Metascape analysis [32] (http://metascape.org). The top 20 enriched GO terms in three categories (biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions) were identified in the upregulated DEGs by IL-4 treatment (S8A Fig). A network plot further captured the relationships between the main regulated biological processes, which were related to cell adhesion and motility, cytokine production, cell responses to external stimuli, cellular component organization, and cell death (Fig 8F) . The enriched GO terms among the down-regulated DEGs in IL-4-treated OPCs represent biological processes such as developmental growth, small molecule biosynthetic process, vessel development, and responses to nutrients and peptides (S8B Fig). These results indicated changes in cell mobilization, growth, differentiation, and defense in IL-4-treated OPCs. A Kyoto encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis 8G) . The PPAR transcription factor assay confirmed that PPAR\u03b3 activity, but not PPAR\u03b1 or PPAR\u03b4 activities, was up-regulated in OPCs upon IL-4 treatment ( Fig 8H) ; these effects were abolished when IL-4R\u03b1 was blocked with a neutralizing antibody ( Fig 8I) . Furthermore, immunostaining (Fig 8J and 8K ) and western blotting (Fig 8L-8N, and S9 Fig) demonstrated that the PPAR\u03b3 inhibitor GW9662 blocked IL-4-induced expression of mature oligodendrocyte markers (MBP or myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein [MOG]), suggesting that PPAR\u03b3 activation is essential for the OPC differentiation induced by IL-4.",

            "text": "Finally, OPC-specific PPAR\u03b3 KO (PPAR\u03b3-OPC KO) mice were used to confirm the importance of PPAR\u03b3 signaling in IL-4-enhanced oligodendrogenesis in an in vivo stroke model ( Fig 9A) . To confirm the KO of PPAR\u03b3 specifically in OPCs, PDGFR\u03b1 + CD45 \u2212 OPCs, GLAST + CD45 \u2212 astrocytes, CD45 + immune cells, and other CD45 \u2212 GLAST \u2212 PDGFR\u03b1 \u2212 CNS cells were sorted from the brains collected from PPAR\u03b3-OPC KO mice at 9 d after 4-hydroxytamoxifen injections. The DNA extracts were subjected to PCR using primers flanking the loxp site and primers detecting the Cre cDNA. The loxp band was abolished in OPCs because of the targeted deletion after Cre-induced recombination, while remaining intact in astrocytes, immune cells, and other CNS cells sorted from the same brain ( Fig 9B) . The expression of Cre was detected in the OPCs of the PPAR\u03b3-OPC KO mice ( Fig 9B) . Deletion of PPAR\u03b3 specifically in OPCs exerted no impact on IL-4R expression on O4 + oligodendrocytes (S10 Fig). Vehicle or IL-4 treatment in PPAR\u03b3-OPC KO mice resulted in similar neuronal tissue loss (Fig 9C and 9D ) and white matter lesion (Fig 9C, 9E and 9F) 35 d after stroke. The lack of PPAR\u03b3 expression in OPCs did not significantly impair oligodendrocyte replacement after stroke, as shown by comparable numbers of BrdU + APC + cells in the ischemic brain from PPAR\u03b3-OPC KO mice and control mice at 35 d after MCAO (Fig 9G and 9H) . However, the absence of PPAR\u03b3 in OPCs reduced the capacity of IL-4 to increase the number of newly generated BrdU + APC + oligodendrocytes (Fig 9G and 9H ). Consistent with a reduced capacity to promote oligodendrogenesis, IL-4 failed to improve long-term sensorimotor (Fig 9I and 9J ) or cognitive (Fig 9K-9M ) deficits after stroke in the absence of PPAR\u03b3. IL-4/PPAR\u03b3 signaling improves white matter repair after stroke the ischemic brain, which is attributed, at least partly, to its release from injured neurons or from infiltrated immune cells [19] . Cerebral IL-4 levels then return to baseline within 1 wk after stroke [16, 19] . In patients, serum levels of IL-4 are known to change following an acute stroke [33] . Furthermore, IL-4 gene polymorphisms are related to susceptibility to ischemic stroke and subsequent functional outcomes [34, 35] . Finally, a recent study reported the expression of IL-4R surrounding axonal filaments in postmortem brain tissue from patients with multiple sclerosis [31] . Although these clinical and experimental data are correlative, the present series of in vivo and in vitro studies firmly establish a causal link between IL-4 repletion and white matter integrity in preclinical stroke models. Deficiency of endogenous IL-4 An improvement in white matter integrity might be achieved in two ways: preservation of preexisting white matter structures or enhancement of white matter repair. Our data favor the latter as the predominant mechanism of action for IL-4. First, longitudinal DTI revealed similar reductions in FA values shortly after stroke in vehicle or IL-4-treated mice, indicating comparable degrees of initial white matter injury during the early/acute phase. A significant improvement in white matter microstructure was only observed in IL-4-treated animals in later stages of recovery (28 and 35 d after stroke). These results strongly suggest a delayed effect of IL-4 on white matter repair, rather than preservation shortly after injury. Second, electron microscopy (EM) and histological studies revealed structural signs of remyelination in the ischemic brain, including thinner myelin segments than before stroke, and reduced paranode length with Caspr/Nav1.6 staining [36] . Each of these structural alterations were significantly improved by IL-4 treatment, indicating superior remyelination. Third, IL-4 treatment increased the number of new, mature oligodendrocytes (APC + BrdU + ) in the ischemic brain 35 d after stroke. Such improvements in oligodendrogenesis are critical for successful remyelination. Finally, the LPC model of demyelination-remyelination unequivocally confirmed the white matter-specific effects of IL-4 in remyelination. As expected, the IL-4-mediated reconstitution of myelin structure culminated in functional improvements in neural conduction and behavioral performance, despite no changes in the degree of gray matter loss. Although IL-4 is important for white matter repair after brain injury, the IL-4 KO mice do not display deficits in myelin coverage in organotypic brain slice cultures under physiological conditions. This observation is consistent with the view that different mechanisms control myelin sheath formation during normal development and remyelination [36] .",

An additional conclusion emerging from our studies is that IL-4 enhances white matter repair at least partially independent of its well-established anti-inflammatory effects on microglia/macrophages. In IL-4-treated stroke mice, we observed an anti-inflammatory phenotypic change in microglia/ macrophages, which is known to promote remyelination after CNS injury [28] . However, dramatic depletion of microglia/macrophages in the ischemic brain did not abolish the capacity of IL-4 to enhance oligodendrocyte replacement, supporting the involvement of microglia/ macrophage-independent mechanisms. In vitro studies then confirmed that IL-4 can also directly target white matter components and promotes OPC differentiation into mature oligodendrocytes in the absence of microglia/macrophages. Previous fate mapping studies revealed that OPCs are responsible for generating new oligodendrocytes during remyelination [38, 39] . However, the differentiation of OPCs is frequently impaired in lesioned brains, mainly because of nonpermissive environmental cues [40] [41] [42] . We found that IL-4 treatment may overcome these obstacles for OPC differentiation in the ischemic brain, both directly by promoting OPC differentiation and indirectly through immunomodulation. Notably, endogenous oligodendrocyte differentiation has been observed until as late as 3 mo after CNS injuries [39] , and this prolonged effort may provide a sufficiently wide therapeutic window that allows delayed IL-4 treatment to restore white matter and encourage long-term stroke recovery.",

PPAR\u03b3 is a master transcription factor known to promote OPC differentiation and maturation though manifold mechanisms involving enhanced myelin lipid synthesis, reduced oxidative stress, and promotion of mitochondrial function [43, 44] . Our previous work has shown that rosiglitazone, a PPAR\u03b3 agonist, enhanced OPC proliferation and increased the number of newly generated mature oligodendrocytes after MCAO [45] . In addition, PPAR\u03b3 may interact with histone deacetylases to modulate cell differentiation [46] . We demonstrated here that PPAR\u03b3 inhibition abolished the effect of IL-4 on OPC differentiation in vitro and that OPC-specific KO of PPAR\u03b3 in vivo reduced IL-4-enhanced oligodendrocyte replacement in the ischemic brain. These collective results indicate that IL-4-induced oligodendrocyte differentiation/maturation relies at least partially on the activation of PPAR\u03b3 activity in OPCs. Precisely how IL-4/IL-4R engages PPAR\u03b3 activity is not yet known, but several studies suggest that IL-4 may activate PPAR\u03b3 in macrophages and other cell types through signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) signaling [37, 47] . Whether this pathway is also operational in OPCs lies beyond the scope of the present study but warrants further investigation.",

Several lines of evidence from our study support the capacity of IL-4 to target multiple types of cells in addition to oligodendrocytes. First, we did not observe significant differences in the density of BrdU + APC + cells between WT and PPAR\u03b3-OPC KO mice following MCAO, suggesting that endogenous IL-4 is able to promote white matter integrity by targeting other types of cells. Second, although PPAR\u03b3 inhibition eliminated the effect of IL-4 on OPC differentiation in cultures, the absence of PPAR\u03b3 in OPCs reduced, but did not abolish, the capacity of IL-4 to increase the number of newly generated oligodendrocytes in vivo. These results suggest that PPAR\u03b3 expression in OPCs is an important but not exclusive mechanism for IL-4-induced oligodendrogenesis in preclinical stroke. Indeed, we observed that IL-4 treatment robustly promoted microglia/macrophage polarization toward an anti-inflammatory M2phenotype, as mentioned above. IL-4-stimulated microglia have been shown to release IL-4 induced 1 (IL4I1), which in turn augments remyelination [48] . Thus, direct and indirect effects on microglia/macrophages may contribute to the white matter repair afforded by IL-4. It has also been reported that the effects of IL-4 on adaptive immune responses contribute partially to recovery from neurotrauma [49] . In our hands, however, repeated intranasal IL-4 administration did not change T-lymphocyte subpopulations or B lymphocytes in blood and did not alter the composition of infiltrated lymphocytes. These data dispute the involvement of adaptive immune responses in IL-4-afforded neuroprotection in our stroke model.",

            "text": "Aside from its roles in immunoregulation, IL-4 can also directly target other types of CNS cells. For example, a recent study reported that the activation of IL-4R signaling in neurons may increase axonal outgrowth and ameliorate axonal pathology in a model of multiple sclerosis [31] . In this context, it is important to note that we did not observe improvements in the DTI measurement for axonal integrity (AD, \u03bb || ). In other disease models, multiple factors including inflammation, cellular infiltration, and gliosis may contribute to AD at chronic stages of disease. Therefore, the measurement of \u03bb || appears to lack sufficient resolution to distinguish axonal damage/repair versus confounding cellular responses over the course of progressive demyelination [50] . On the other hand, our EM data demonstrated an increase in axon diameter in IL-4-treated mice compared to vehicle-treated controls, supporting a beneficial role of IL-4 in maintaining axonal structure. These structural data were supported by our electrophysiological studies of axon conductance. Preservation of axonal structure and electrical function might provide an important feedback signal for OPC differentiation and guide remyelination [51, 52] , preventing Wallerian degeneration of neurons after ischemia and enhancing white matter repair. In addition to these mechanisms, astrocytes are known to produce trophic factors in response to IL-4 stimulation, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF), both of which are also critical for brain function and brain repair [53] .",

In the present study, IL-4 stimulated OPC differentiation in cultures at a concentration range of 5-100 ng/mL, and the optimal concentration was 10-20 ng/mL. Although there is neither a mathematical nor empirical method to accurately convert in vitro concentrations to in vivo intranasal dosage, these in vitro data support the capacity of IL-4 to directly target OPCs at low concentrations. Previous preclinical studies have similarly documented therapeutic effects of low doses of IL-4 in ischemic stroke and other neurological diseases. For example, subcutaneous IL-4 application at 2 \u03bcg/kg/d [19] or intracerebroventricular application of IL-4 at 60 ng/d [16] significantly improved long-term outcomes after stroke. Vogelaar and colleagues reported that intrathecal or intranasal (1 \u03bcg/d) IL-4 treatment ameliorated clinical signs and reversed disease progression in a model of multiple sclerosis [31] . Those studies, however, did not measure IL-4 concentrations in the brain after treatment. Here, we delivered IL-4 intranasally at a dose of 50 \u03bcg/kg/d (about 1.25 \u03bcg/d based on 0.025 kg average body weight), which significantly elevated IL-4 levels in key parts of the brain. This dose is similar to the effective intranasal dose for Vogelaar's study and improved long-term functional recovery in our stroke model. Repeated dosing regimens or controlled continuous release was employed for all in vivo IL-4 treatment because of its rapid clearance and inactivation. The use of liposome-entrapped peptides has been reported to protect the cytokine and enhance its tissue delivery [55, 56] . Consistent with those findings, we demonstrated that IL-4 liposome nanoparticle delivery elevated IL-4 levels in the brain for at least 24 h. Further characterization of the optimal regimen of IL-4 treatment for stroke would accelerate its clinical translation.",

Furthermore, we have shown that IL-4 promotes oligodendrogenesis and white matter repair in a PPAR\u03b3dependent manner. Therefore, it seems reasonable to continue to test IL-4 as a therapeutic strategy for functional recovery after ischemic stroke.

(G-H) Flow cytometry of the immune cells in the blood 28 d after initiation of the PLX5622 diet (21 d after stroke). Data are expressed as % of single cells. n = 6/group. \ufffd\ufffd p < 0.01; \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd p < 0.001. One-way ANOVA and Bonferroni post hoc test (C and D) or Student's t test (E, F, and H). Data associated with this figure can be found in the supplemental data file (S1 Data). Iba1, ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1; MCAO, middle cerebral artery occlusion. (TIF) S6 Fig. Intranasal IL-4 treatment exerts minimal effects on adaptive immune cell populations. Transient focal ischemia was induced by 60-min MCAO. Stroke mice were post-treated with IL-4 or vehicle starting 6 h after MCAO at daily intervals for days 1-7. Animals were sacrificed on day 8 after stroke. (A) Gating strategy for blood lymphocyte populations. (B) Histograms showing the IL-4 + Th2 cell, IL-17 + Th17 cell, regulatory T cell (Foxp3 + ), and IFN\u03b3 + Th cell subpopulations in CD4 + T cells in the blood of vehicle or IL-4-treated mice. (C) Quantification of lymphocyte populations in the blood. (D) Quantification of lymphocyte populations in ischemic brains. n = 6/group. Student's t test. Data associated with this figure can be found in the supplemental data file (S1 Data). Foxp3, forkhead box P3; IFN\u03b3, interferon gamma; IL-4, interleukin-4; MCAO, middle cerebral artery occlusion; Th, T helper. (TIF) S7 Fig. IL-4 exerts no effect on OPC survival and proliferation. OPCs were treated with vehicle and various concentrations of IL-4 for 3 d. (A) LDH assay for cell death. (B) MTT assay. (C) Quantification of OPC proliferation using BrdU proliferation kit (Sigma-Aldrich). Three independent experiments, each performed in quadruplicate. Data associated with this figure can be found in the supplemental data file (S1 Data). BrdU, 5-bromo-2 0 -deoxyuridine; IL-4, interleukin-4; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; OPC, oligodendrocyte progenitor cell. (TIF) S8 Fig. GO terms that were significantly enriched in up-regulated (A) or down-regulated (B) DEGs in IL-4-treated OPCs. Microarray analyses were performed on OPCs treated with PBS or IL-4 (20 ng/mL) for 3 d. n = 4/group. DEGs that were up-regulated or down-regulated (FDR < 0.05; and fold change > 2) by IL-4 treatment were subjected to GO enrichment analysis using the Metascape analysis. The top 20 enriched GO terms in three categories (biological process, cellular component, and molecular function) are listed. Bars represent gene counts. Circles represent values of \u2212logP. DEG, differentially expressed gene; FDR, false discovery rate; GO, gene ontology; OPC, oligodendrocyte progenitor cell. (TIF) S9 Fig. Full size western blot images of MOG, MBP, and Actin in Fig 8. MBP, myelin basic protein; MOG, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein. (TIF) S10 Fig. OPC-specific PPAR\u03b3 KO shows no impact on IL-4R expression on immature oligodendrocytes. Brain slices were collected from WT or OPC-specific PPAR\u03b3 KO mice 35 d after 60-min MCAO. Brain slices were stained for O4 (green)-a marker of preoligodendrocytes and premyelinating oligodendrocytes-and IL-4R (red). Yellow arrows indicate doublestained cells. Scale bar: 40 \u03bcm. IL-4R, interleukin-4 receptor; KO, knockout; MCAO, middle cerebral artery occlusion; OPC, oligodendrocyte progenitor cell; PPAR\u03b3, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma; WT, wild-type.
