            "text": "Oncolytic adenoviruses (Ad) are promising tools for cancer therapeutics. Most Ad-based therapies utilize species C serotypes, with Adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) most commonly employed. Prior clinical trials demonstrated low efficiency of oncolytic Ad5 vectors, mainly due to the absence of Ad5 primary receptor (Coxsackie and Adenovirus Receptor, CAR) on cancer cells. Engineering serotype chimeric vectors (Ad5/3) to utilize Adenovirus type 3 (Ad3) receptors has greatly improved their oncolytic potential. Clinical translation of these infectivity-enhanced vectors has been challenging due to a lack of replication permissive animal models. In this study, we explored pigs as a model to study the performance of fiber-modified Ad5/3 chimeric vectors. As a control, the Ad5 fiber-unmodified virus was used. We analyzed binding, gene transfer, replication, and cytolytic ability of Ad5 and Ad5/3 in various non-human cell lines (murine, hamster, canine, porcine). Among all tested cell lines only porcine cells supported active binding and replication of Ad5/3. Syrian hamster cells supported Ad5 replication but showed no evidence of productive viral replication after infection with Ad5/3 vectors. Transduction and replication ability of Ad5/3 in porcine cells outperformed Ad5, a phenomenon often observed in human cancer cell lines. Replication of Ad5 and Ad5/3 was subsequently evaluated in vivo in immunocompetent pigs. Quantitative PCR analyses 7 days post infection revealed Ad5 and Ad5/3 DNA and replication-dependent luciferase activity in the swine lungs and spleen indicating active replication in these tissues. These studies demonstrated the flaws in using Syrian hamsters for testing serotype chimeric Ad5/3 vectors. This is the first report to validate the pig as a valuable model for preclinical testing of oncolytic adenoviruses utilizing Adenovirus type 3 receptors. We hope that these data will help to foster the clinical translation of oncolytic adenoviruses including those with Ad3 retargeted tropism.",

            "text": "Oncolytic adenoviruses (Ad) have emerged as a promising new therapy in the fight against cancer. Adenoviruses are a family of non-enveloped DNA viruses comprised of 51 different serotypes organized into 6 species (A-F) [1] . The viral capsid is an icosahedron which is composed of hexon and penton base proteins. Attached to each penton base is a fiber protein which consists of three shown in multiple studies to be semi-permissive to human adenoviral infection and oncolytic effect was demonstrated in this animal model [25, 29, 30] . Their widespread use has been hampered because they are a difficult species to work with and have limited commercial availability [26] . Syrian hamsters have emerged as an essential animal model for evaluation of species C serotypes [26, [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] . These animals have been studied extensively and are known to support Ad5 replication. This immune-competent model has enabled the evaluation of Ad behavior in situ with natural host immune responses.",

Over the last two decades, only a few groups have studied porcine cell lines for Ad5 replication [23, [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] . Jogler et al. took the experiments further, evaluating Ad5 in vivo, and showed evidence of effective replication in pigs [23] . While this study did provide some promising data, it was limited by the early time points used to demonstrate productive viral replication and by the use of only a single animal in each group for the in vivo studies. Difficulty and expense of working with such a large animal with few commercially available cell lines have limited the wide acceptance of this model. As the field has matured and many new chimeric vectors have been created, it may now be beneficial to further pursue this model to help make the jump to clinical translation.",

Liver biopsies were obtained on days 1, 2, and 4. Necropsy was performed on day 7 and major organs were evaluated for viral infection. Seven days post infection with either vector, adenoviral DNA was detected in the pigs' lung and spleen (>1000 AdE4 copy/\u00b5g DNA) (Figure 6a) . The viral DNA quantity in lungs and spleens correlated well with replication-dependent Luc expression (~2500 RLU/\u00b5g and~2000 RLU/\u00b5g, respectively), measuring similar levels of Luc activity with both Ad5-and Ad5/3-\u2206E3-Luc (Figure 6b ). Interestingly, unlike in mice, no liver tropism was observed in pigs. Viral replication in liver tissues was almost negligible, demonstrating much lower levels of viral DNA in liver biopsies at earlier time points (<30.0 AdE4 copy/\u00b5g) and background values 7 days post infection. Again, DNA copy numbers correlated well with the Luc expression in liver biopsies. These results confirm the ability of adenoviral vectors to actively replicate in live swine after systemic administration, further supporting the usefulness of pigs as a potential model testing adenoviral vectors, including species B-retargeted viral constructs.",

Because of the difficulty in establishing an animal model for Ad5 vectors, coupled with the known difference of Ad3 receptors, we felt that it was essential to directly address the Syrian hamster's ability to undergo productive infection with chimeric serotype Ad5/3 vectors. Our studies suggest that Syrian hamsters are far less permissive for Ad5/3 than for Ad5. While we confirmed clear evidence of Ad5 replication and replication-dependent cell death in hamster cells, similar results were absent in cells infected with Ad5/3 vectors. Poor infectivity after Ad5/3 infection of Syrian hamster cells has been reported in literature by others [47] .",

Indeed, a few groups have reported CD46 expression in mice and rats is limited to the testes [48, 49] . Our binding and gene transfer assays, which directly assess viral entry, demonstrated very low viral entry and negligible transduction efficiency in hamster cells infected with Ad5/3 viruses. When directly compared to human A549 control cell line, hamster cells infected with Ad5/3 showed 40 to 80-fold lower virus biding and at least 5000-fold lower transduction efficiency. A complete and more detailed analysis of Ad5 (CAR) and Ad3 (CD46 and DSG2) receptor expression in non-human cell lines is needed to further elucidate the reasons that lead to differences in infectivity. However, due to major differences in the nucleotide sequences between species, a single primer or antibody will be insufficient to objectively compare the receptor expression pattern. Therefore, we believe that the functional binding assay provides the most accurate evaluation of the binding ability of Ad5/3 vectors in non-human species. Cell viability and replication assays showed no Syrian hamster cell death with Ad5/3 viruses. When compared to constructs expressing Ad5 binding domains, replication dependent gene expression was nearly two orders of magnitude lower when hamster cells were infected with viruses expressing Ad3 binding domains. This series of experiments convincingly demonstrates that Syrian hamsters are not a permissive host for productive infection with Ad5/3 adenoviral vectors and as such, these animals cannot provide meaningful preclinical data.",

PCR analyses of viral DNA revealed significant presence of both Ad5 and Ad5/3 in the lungs and spleens of these animals. DNA copy numbers were similar between animals infected with Ad5 vectors and those infected with Ad5/3. Because this viral DNA could potentially be secondary to sequestration of the inoculated viral particles and not actually from viral replication, we have examined the tissues for replication-dependent luciferase expression. The pig tissues exhibited the same pattern of Luc expression, with the highest levels of transgene being seen in the lungs and spleen. Again, the levels of gene expression between the two different viral constructs were not significantly different. These data provide strong evidence of active viral replication with production of functional progeny versus simple sequestration of viral inoculum.

Percutaneous liver biopsies were performed on sedated pigs with a true-cut biopsy needle to analyze Ad distribution at days 1, 2, and 4 post-infection. On day 7, all pigs were euthanized with beuthansia D, and liver, lungs and spleen tissues were immediately harvested and cut in half at the center. Half of tissue samples were fixed with buffered formaldehyde for immunostaining and pathological analysis, the second half was snap-frozen and stored at \u221280 \u2022 C until the total DNA was extracted from~25 mg of tissues. PCR was used to determine the E4 viral DNA copy number as an indication of virus distribution in 1ug of DNA using a standard curve with known E4 gene copies. Luciferase activity was determined in spleen, lung and liver as an indication of viral replication. A complete blood count test (CBC) and blood chemistry analysis was performed on blood serum at Marshfield laboratory (Madison, WI, USA) [57, 58] .

Mouse, hamster, canine and porcine cell lines were infected with Ad5 and Ad5/3 for 1h at 4 \u2022 C to prevent virus internalization. Isolated total DNA was analyzed by PCR to determine bound Ad (AdE4 gene copy/ng DNA). Amongst the non-human cells, the porcine cells supported the highest levels of Ad5/3 binding. Mouse, hamster, and canine cells demonstrated superior binding with Ad5 vectors versus Ad5/3, while porcine cells and human cell controls showed the opposite trend of Ad5/3 superiority.
