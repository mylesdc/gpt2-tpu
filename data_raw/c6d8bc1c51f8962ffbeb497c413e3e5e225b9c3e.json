Evidence indicates that some picornaviruses hijack autophagy in order to induce autophagosome-like membrane structures for genomic RNA replication. Expression of picornavirus proteins can specifically induce the machinery of autophagy, although the mechanisms by which the viruses employ autophagy appear to differ. Many picornaviruses up-regulate autophagy in order to promote viral replication while some members of the family also inhibit degradation by autolysosomes. Here we explore the unusual relationship of this medically important family of viruses with a degradative mechanism of innate immunity.",

Autophagy initiates when proteins, membranes, and organelles are engulfed into a unique double-membraned structure known as an autophagosome. This vesicle matures by acidification and fuses with lysosomes to form the degradative autolysosome [2] . Autophagy plays important roles in breaking down protein aggregates and cellular structures as well as recycling of intracellular components [3] . In addition to maintaining cellular homeostasis, autophagy can be induced by cellular stressors such as starvation, drug treatments, or infection. Autophagy is also as a mechanism by which OPEN ACCESS the cell controls infection through degradation of cytosolic viruses and bacteria [4, 5] . However, as is true for most immune responses, several pathogens subvert the autophagic machinery in order to promote their survival and replication.",

For years, scientists have been learning how this medically important class of viruses rearranges cellular ultrastructure. In 1958, the first electron microscopy (EM) analysis was carried out by Marguerite Vogt's group, using monkey kidney cells infected with poliovirus (PV) [6] . This study, one of the first EM studies conducted on a uniformly infected, synchronous population of infected cells, identified cytoplasmic vesicles termed by the authors \"U bodies\". The presence of U bodies correlated with the maximal release of virus from the cells. As lysis approached, clear vacuoles were seen in place of the U bodies. The techniques used were insufficient to identify virions during infection. However, this work clearly established the unusual pattern of membrane rearrangements in the cytoplasm of picornavirus-infected cells.",

The authors analyzed HeLa cells treated with PV at a high multiplicity of infection (MOI = 22) and used EM protocols that provided high-contrast images of intracellular membranes. In their images, Dales and Palade identified \"membrane-enclosed cell bodies\" occupying nearly the entire cytoplasm of the cell. They identified these bodies, which they measured to be 70-200 nm each in diameter, to be the same as the U bodies observed by Vogt. In the Dales study, progeny virus particles were observed both inside and outside the small bodies. These vesicles clearly have two lipid bilayers with an electron-light luminal region in between, a hallmark of classical autophagosomes. The authors suggested that newly formed viral particles were being taken up into these vesicles as a response to infection.",

This indicates that from virus to virus there is variation in the membranegenerating pathways induced, and that there is no universal picornavirus replication membrane. It is possible that autophagosomes contain Sec13, Sec31, and Arf1, unifying the two classes of vesicle seen during PV infection. It is also possible that there are two distinct classes of vesicle during infection, a COPII-derived vesicle and a vesicle derived from the autophagy machinery, each with distinct roles and identities. The remainder of this review focuses on the known connections between autophagy and picornavirus replication.",

LC3-II appears to be required to complete formation of the autophagosome [29] . The isoforms of LC3 can be distinguished by Western blotting and a relative increase in LC3-II levels is indicative of increased autophagy. In addition, LC3 conjugated to GFP can be expressed in cells and monitored by immunofluorescence; LC3-GFP will form puncta in response to induction of autophagy. The ubiquitin-binding protein p62 also interacts with LC3-II in order to target cargo to autophagosomes for degradation [30] . Since p62 is degraded along with the rest of the autophagosome contents, steady-state levels of p62 can be monitored as an indicator of autophagic degradation levels. Advances in technology also allowed for the manipulation of the autophagic pathway via gene knockdown of various ATG proteins, the effects of which could be assessed by these newly available assays.",

The mTOR complex mTORC1 acts upstream of the autophagic pathway to suppress autophagic membrane formation, and mTOR activity can be monitored by detecting the activation of its downstream target S6 kinase. mTORC1 is inhibited when autophagy is induced via a cellular stress such as starvation or a drug treatment like rapamycin. 2. After initiation of autophagy, a complex containing the Atg protein Beclin-1 is necessary for autophagosome formation. Tamoxifen induces autophagy by indirectly acting upon Beclin-1, while 3-MA suppresses autophagy due to its inhibition of PI3 kinases that interact with Beclin-1. The picornaviruses PV, CVB3, HRV-2, HRV-14, EV71, FMDV and EMCV have been shown to induce autophagic membrane formation. 3. During autophagic membrane formation, the cytosolic Atg protein LC3-I becomes conjugated to PE, mediated in part by the ubiquitin E1-like enzyme Atg7, to form LC3-II. LC3-II proteins then specifically associate with a newly-formed crescent-shaped membrane termed a phagophore. The conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II has been observed with all of the picornaviruses discussed at length in this review. 4. The phagophore elongates around cytosolic contents until the contents are completely sequestered within a fully formed double-membraned autophagosome. The formation of the autophagosome requires the ubiquitin-like protein Atg12. 5. The autophagosome matures, becoming acidic, and fuses with lysosomes to form the degradative autolysosome. The cytosolic contents are degraded, and LC3-II is also degraded or recycled back to LC3-I. CVB3 appears to block this degradative step, while EMCV does not.",

The effect of inhibiting autophagy was more pronounced on levels of virus found in the medium prior to cell lysis than on cell-associated virus.

Ultrastructural analysis revealed that double-membraned vesicles were induced in HeLa or HEK 293T cells during infection with CVB3. Correspondingly, levels of LC3-II were significantly increased during infection. The GFP-LC3 signal re-localized to puncta in the presence of CVB3 as well, indicating that CVB3 infection induces autophagosome formation. Both viral titer and expression of the capsid protein VP1 decreased in the presence of 3-MA. Conversely, rapamycin treatment enhanced viral titer, and VP1 levels increased under starvation conditions. In addition, both VP1 expression and viral titer were reduced when the autophagy proteins Beclin-1, ATG7, and Vps34 were knocked down. The phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 has been shown to be required for induction of autophagy; accordingly, the levels of phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1 increased during viral infection [37, 38] . However, p62 levels were not affected by CVB3 infection, indicating that degradation of autophagic targets was blocked. Furthermore, inhibition of the lysosome by LAMP-2 knockdown resulted in an increase in both VP1 levels and viral production.

The levels of p62 also built up over time, indicating that degradation was inhibited. In addition, GFP-LC3 re-localized to puncta that did not co-localize with LAMP1, suggesting that autophagic flux was blocked. Further observation revealed that, compared to uninfected controls, infected cells contained large GFP-LC3 positive structures. In addition, smaller vesicles were observed, leading the authors to distinguish between autophagosomes and the large structures, which were termed megaphagosomes. Ultrastructural analysis on CVB3-infected cells showed an abundance of small (~250 nm) autophagosome-like vesicles similar to those observed during PV infection as well as more typically sized autophagosomes. Some megaphagosomes (2-3 \u03bcm) were also detected and appeared to have double membranes. Immuno-EM confirmed that LC3 was localized to the megaphagosome membrane. This work is consistent with the in vitro research in that CVB3 infection appears to induce autophagy and block autolysosome formation. However, more studies will need to be performed to investigate the link between viral induction of autophagy and viral replication in vivo.",

The species is divided into major and minor serotype groups, depending on the receptor utilized for cellular entry. HRV-14, a major group virus, and HRV-2, a minor group virus, have been shown to induce autophagy [31] . As with PV, infection with either HRV-2 or HRV-14 caused a co-localization of LAMP1 with punctate GFP-LC3 in MCF-7 cells. Further, monodansylcadaverine, a fluorophore retained in autophagosomes under gentle cell fixation conditions, showed a punctate pattern after infection with HRV14 that appeared similar to that observed during tamoxifen treatment. Finally, HRV-14 induced the formation of autophagosome-like vesicles. These data suggest that the HRVs examined induce autophagy. The effect of autophagy on HRV-2 replication is somewhat controversial, as a subsequent paper proposed that induction of autophagy did not affect HRV-2 viral production [41] . However, recent work showed that HRV-2 induces and subverts the autophagic pathway in order to promote viral replication [42] . Formation of GFP-LC3 puncta was observed following infection of HEK 293T cells with HRV-2. Further, modification of LC3 was detected during infection using Western blotting. Finally, induction of autophagy with rapamycin resulted in an increase in HRV-2 titers similar to that seen with PV, and a corresponding decrease was detected when autophagy was inhibited using 3-MA.

One report provides evidence that EV71 induces autophagy that is associated with viral replication [43] . Upon infection with EV71, muscle or neuronal cell lines transfected with GFP-LC3 showed puncta formation indicative of autophagy, and EM analysis detected autophagosome-like vesicles of 100-500 nm in diameter in the presence of EV71. LC3-II levels also increased via Western blotting. Viral titers decreased in the presence of 3-MA and increased in the presence of inducers of autophagy, indicating that autophagy enhanced viral production. Furthermore, phosphorylation of both mTOR, a major effector of autophagic signaling, and its downstream target S6 kinase decreased during viral infection. Finally, experiments showed that mice infected with EV71 developed double-membraned structures in their cervical spinal cord neurons. By immuno-EM analysis, LC3 and the viral protein VP1 co-localized with these structures. Taken together, these data suggest that EV71 induces autophagy both in vitro and in vivo to facilitate viral replication, likely in a manner similar to that seen with PV infection.",

The viral capsid protein VP1 co-localized with both GFP-LC3 puncta as well as the autophagy protein ATG5, which also appears to be in a punctate distribution during infection. Further, only during rapamycin treatment or FMDV infection did punctate GFP-LC3 co-localize with LAMP1. As seen with other picornaviruses, induction of autophagy using rapamycin enhanced viral production, whereas 3-MA treatment caused a reduction in viral production. Silencing either LC3 or ATG5 via siRNA also caused both intracellular and extracellular viral yield to be suppressed. Lastly, EM showed that formation of both single-membraned and double-membraned structures approximately 150 nm in diameter increased during FMDV infection; these structures co-localized with LC3 as well as the viral protein 2B.

Coxsackievirus has been shown to inhibit autophagic degradation in a manner reminiscent of L. pneumophila [33, 37, 39] . This makes sense, as one can imagine the advantage to blocking degradation of nascent virions.
