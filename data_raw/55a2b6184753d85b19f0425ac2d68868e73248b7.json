            "text": "Drug products containing antibodies (Abs) or their derivatives as active ingredients have been successfully used for the prevention and treatment of severe and socially significant diseases, such as cancer, multiple sclerosis, influenza, acute respiratory tract viral infections, diabetes, etc. [1, 2] . The principle interaction underlying therapeutic effects of such medicines is the antigen-antibody (Ag-Abs) interaction, the identification and quantification of which is therefore an important target for immunoassays [3, 4] . To date, a variety of corresponding assays have been available, differing in the method of detecting this interaction: (1) direct detection where the Ag-Abs complex is identified either visually or by simple optical devices [5, 6] ; (2) detection based on the passive agglutination reaction, i.e., adhesion of particles with Ag or Abs bound to their surfaces [7, 8] ; (3) detection relying on the use of various labels [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] ; (4) detection techniques employing rapid, portable, high-sensitivity sensors. The latter include immunochromatographic systems [15, 16] , immunochips [17] , or immunosensors [14, 18] , which represent a fast-developing approach in laboratory analysis using various types of biologically sensitive elements to furnish information about the Ag-Abs interaction in the form of electrical signals [19] . The important distinction of immunosensor assays is the method of signal transduction which may employ either an electrochemical or an optical transducer [20] . In electrochemical transducers, an electrochemical signal is measured, the magnitude of which changes following the formation of the Ag-Abs complex [21, 22] . In the case of optical transducers, Ag-Abs quantification is based on the generation of light signals (color change or fluorescence) or changes in the optical properties of the environment [23] . Among major advantages of immunosensors are the rapidity of analysis, convenience of use, possibility of quantification with subsequent mathematical processing, portability of the test devices and high sensitivity [19] .",

PI enables direct detection of biochemical interactions between receptor molecules without the need for additional labeling (fluorescent, enzymatic, etc.) which favorably distinguishes them from similar devices. This type of immunosensor is characterized by fast response and ease of operation, integrability into multisensory systems or automatic data acquisition systems [25] . The unparalleled feature of PI is that they compromise high sensitivity ensured by the use of QCR as a transducer element and selectivity, which is determined by the specificity of receptor molecules employed [19] . The principle behind PI operation is the detection of frequency variations of the electrical signal following Ag-Abs complex formation, resulting in an increase of mass sensed by the quartz plate of the resonator or cantilever. The specific biolayer in a QCR provides highly selective identification of homologous antigens in a complex mixture with no need for additional procedures involving other reagents.",

Dilutions prepared using this technique were found to share a common feature-the ability to directly modify the initial substance, alter its spatial structure and, consequently, its physicochemical and biological properties. RAF-based drug products are referred to as \"released-active\", with their efficacy and safety proven by both non-clinical and clinical studies [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] . We also previously demonstrated the possibility of using ELISA tests for examining the effects of both antibody and non-antibody RAFs on the Ag-Abs interaction [40, 41] . Development studies of RAF Abs to IFNg using ELISA showed that the binding constant of commercial Abs to IFNg was changed in the presence of RAF Abs to IFNg, indicating that RAF Abs to IFNg can influence steric interaction [40] . Because the characteristics of PI are largely dependent on the concentration and steric availability of biomolecules immobilized onto the electrode surface, we suggested that this approach could be used for identification tests and assays of RAF Abs. For this purpose, we selected a PI technique employing high-sensitivity sensors in order to evaluate the effects of RAF Abs to IFNg on the Ag-Abs interaction. This provided us with the data elucidating the influence of RAF Abs on Abs' affinity to IFNg; the findings are presented in this paper.",

Following 20-min incubation at 22-23\u02ddC and further 12-h incubation at +4\u02ddC, the treated electrode was rinsed with PBS. Another Abs adsorption technique (3) involved coating the sensor surface with 5 \u00b5L of 11-mercapto-1-undecanol and incubation at room temperature for 30 min. Following this, 5 \u00b5L of GA (2.5% solution in bidistilled water) was deposited with subsequent incubation at 4\u02ddC for 12 h and PBS rinse. For the next method (4), 5 \u00b5L of 11-mercapto-1-undecanol (MU) and 5 \u00b5l of (2-oxy-3-mercaptoethyl)-3-benzoylpyrimidine (OMBP) (or 2-N-4-mercapto-6-phenyl-1,3,5-triazine (MPT) or 2-amino-5-mercapto-1,3,4-triazole (AMT)) were successively coated onto a freshly cleaned electrode surface and incubated in a drying oven at +80\u02ddC for 1 h. Thereafter, 5 \u00b5L of freshly prepared 5% glutaraldehyde was added and after 15-20 min the sensor was carefully rinsed with buffer. Finally, for method (5), the sensor surface was coated with 8 \u00b5L of 2-mercaptoethylamine and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Further, the surface was activated by depositing 5 \u00b5L of GA (2.5% solution in bidistilled water) with subsequent incubation at 4\u02ddC for 12 h and buffer rinse or by 7 \u00b5L of 2% calix [4] arene followed by 12-h incubation at 4\u02ddC and buffer rinse. Analytical signal measurements were performed in the flow-injection mode at flow rate of 60 \u00b5L/min for PBS.",

Since the analytical signal was shown to diminish in the presence of RAF Abs to IFNg, more reliable results of Abs to human IFNg detection were expected with regard to indirect measurements by comparing the analytical signal of the sensor obtained with IFNg solutions containing or not containing the RAF of specific Abs. Considering the available ELISA [40] , we suggested that the effects of RAF Abs to IFNg could be evaluated using pre-incubation with one of the components of the Ag-Abs system for compounds containing RAF Abs to IFNg. However, variations of the analytical signal measured with PI may occur not only as a result of specific IFNg-Abs interactions, but also due to dilution or ionic strength changes of the analyzed solution, or non-specific interactions of secondary components with IFNg and the receptor layer. Hence, the presence of RAF Abs to IFNg in a sample can be demonstrated with higher reliability when differential evaluation of the signal is undertaken, with account for the noise signal, by examining the difference between the signal obtained in the presence of RAF Abs to IFNg and that of the placebo. The evaluation described was carried out, showing that the analytical signal was decreased following pre-incubation of Abs to IFNg with RAF Abs to IFNg which indicated attenuated affinity between IFNg and specific Abs in the presence of RAF Abs to IFNg. For instance, the decrease of the analytical signal was greater for RAF Abs to IFNg as compared with the placebo: the differences in signal magnitude were 19.4% (p \u010f 0.0001) for tablets, 51% (p \u010f 0.0001) for liquid samples and 34.3% for lactose powders (Figure 1 ).

In addition, the analytical signals obtained during the experiments had low relative deviations, both for short-term measurements and for tests repeated on different days by different operators, suggesting high repeatability and intermediate precision of the analytical procedure. The piezoelectric sensor technique was shown to have high specificity, allowing the specific identification of RAF Abs to IFNg in samples in comparison with controls.

The established technique is reliable, reproducible and easy to perform. Obtained data support findings received during ELISA method development [40] showing the ability of RAF Abs to IFNg to modify IFNg affinity to specific Abs to IFNg and encourage our assumption about the RAF Abs' effect on the spatial Ag-Abs interactions. Nevertheless, further studies into this field are contemplated.",
