            "text": "Simple Summary: Recent research has debated the effects of milk and forage feeding regimes in the first weeks of life on the future performance of dairy calves. However, little is known about how feeding regime can affect behavioural and physiological responses, which have the potential to impact on calf health and well-being. Traditional methods of assessing calf health and welfare such as behavioural observations and blood sampling can be time consuming and impractical for producers and invasive for animals involved. Developments in technology have increased the availability of on-farm non-invasive devices which allow automatic and remote collection of behavioural and physiological data linked to animal health and welfare. This study aimed to use devices to measure lying behaviour, heart rate, heart rate variability and infrared temperature of calves offered high or low levels of milk replacer and different types of forage throughout the first ten weeks of life. Calves displayed changes in lying behaviour and heart rate variability as a result of changes in milk replacer feeding frequency. Additionally, infrared temperature changes were detected during periods of vaccination which corresponded with a rise in core body temperature. Results have highlighted that these sensors can provide important and useable data regarding overall calf well-being on commercial farms.",

Seventy-four Holstein Friesian calves were individually penned and allocated to receive either high (HML) or conventional (CML) milk replacer (MR) levels between 5-70 days of age. Additionally calves were allocated to one of four forage treatments: (i) chopped straw offered between 14-70 days of age (CS14), (ii) chopped straw offered between 56-70 days of age (CS56), (iii) grass silage offered between 56-70 days of age (GS56), and (iv) no forage in the pre-wean period (NF). A representative sample of calves from each treatment were fitted with activity sensors and heart rate monitors throughout the experimental period to examine lying behaviour and heart rate variability, respectively. Thermal images of the eye and rectal area of each calf were taken 5 days/week between 5-77 days of age. Faecal and respiratory scoring of each individual calf was carried out on a daily basis throughout the experimental period. Milk replacer feeding level had limited effects on measures of calf health, although HML calves tended to have an increased likelihood for receiving treatment for scour than CML calves. Daily lying time (min/d) was lower in HML calves following reduction in MR feeding frequency at 43 days of age and weaning at 71 days of age when compared with CML calves.",

            "text": "Traditional calf feeding programs have involved providing calves with restricted levels of milk or milk replacer (MR) as a means of encouraging starter intake and thus facilitating earlier weaning and rumen development [1] . However, restricted milk feeding programs have also been linked with low live weight gains [2] and increased abnormal non-nutritive feeding behaviours suggestive of a decrease in calf welfare [3] . In recent years there has been growing interest in providing calves with higher levels of MR, which has been positively associated with improved growth rates in early life [4] , reduced age at first calving [5] and increased first lactation milk yield [1] . However, providing greater volumes of milk or MR can result in reduced starter feed intake prior to weaning, [6] which may impede rumen development [7] . Gradual weaning programs have previously been suggested as a means of encouraging starter intake in calves offered high levels of milk [8] . However, as reported by de Passille, et al. [9] , calves fed higher milk levels may still display lower total DMI than those fed conventional levels of milk following complete milk withdrawal despite the adoption of a gradual weaning program, which could impact on overall calf performance and welfare in the post-weaning period. Recently, Imani, et al. [10] reviewed the varying effects of forage provision on calf intake and performance during the transition from a liquid to a solid feed diet. Although results of previous research have been inconclusive, both Castells, et al. [11] and Khan, et al. [12] reported that forage provision improved feed intake and was beneficial for rumen development in calves offered conventional and increased levels of milk, respectively. Provision of forage has been shown to affect lying and feeding behaviour in calves offered high levels of MR [13] . However, little is known about the interactive effects of milk replacer level and forage inclusion on calf activity, which could have a potential effect on calf welfare.",

However, results of previous research have been varied. Several authors have reported either improvements or no differences in health scores of calves offered increased levels of MR [4, 15, 16] , whereas Quigley, et al. [17] reported increased incidence of diarrhoea and number of veterinary treatments in calves fed greater volumes of MR. Previous research has suggested that ill-health in early calf-hood can impact negatively on future performance [18] and that morbidity and mortality from disease is increased in the presence of physical and psychological stressors [19] . As indicated by Khan, et al. [20] , neonatal calf feeding regime can have an extensive impact on performance, behaviour, health and welfare. Previous research has also provided evidence of long-term consistencies in individual differences of behavioural and physiological response to acute stressors [21] , this suggesting that experiences in early calfhood could impact development of future coping strategies. As such, there is a need to examine if nutritional regime can impact on behavioural and physiological responses to management strategies commonly encountered in the first months of life.",

The study described an increase in oxytocin production in veal calves offered either a MR only or MR plus concentrate diet (Control diet) when compared to calves offered a diet of MR, concentrate and hay. These results suggest that stress related to different diets can impact on measureable immunoreactive parameters and highlights the need for further examination of how nutritional regimes can impact on calf health and welfare. However, traditional methods of monitoring calf behaviour and reaction to stressors can be labour intensive (e.g., visual observations) and invasive (e.g., blood sampling, immunohistochemical methods). Recently there has been increasing interest in employing the use of remote-sensing technologies such as activity and heart rate monitors which could allow the non-invasive measurement of behavioural and physiological responses to stressors on an individual basis and provide a more comprehensive indicator of calf wellbeing [23, 24] . Within this study the primary objective was to examine behavioural and physiological responses of calves to milk feeding level using remote monitoring technologies applicable to on-farm use. It was hypothesized that reduction in MR feeding frequency and weaning would likely be considered a stressor, particularly in those calves offered higher levels of milk replacer, and would provoke a measureable behavioural and physiological response. A further objective was to examine the impact of forage inclusion at different ages on calf activity and if there was an interactive effect with MR feeding level.",

Ambient temperature and relative humidity (RH) within the rearing accommodation were recorded using a calibrated EBI 20-TH data logger (ebro Electronic, Ingolstadt) throughout the experimental period. Average temperature and RH values obtained during the time period when images were taken were entered into the software program during image processing to allow for atmospheric changes during the sampling period.

Positive correlations were also found between core body and IR rectal temperature between days 7-21, 22-42 and 57-77 and between IR eye and IR rectal temperature during days 22-42, 43-56 and 57-77 ( Table 6 ). Correlations of 0.4, 0.6 and 0.39 were found between core body and IR eye, core body and IR rectal and IR eye and IR rectal temperatures respectively when analysed over the 7 days prior to and following removal of calf jackets ( Table 6 ). Strong positive correlations were also found between methods of temperature assessment during the 7 days prior to and following 2nd vaccination (Table 6 ). Table 6 .

            "text": "Responses to common management practices such as restricted feeding and weaning have previously been assessed using measures of calf activity, with technological developments meaning that standing and lying behaviour can now be recorded automatically [36] . De Paula Vieira, et al. [37] reported a decrease in lying time observed in limit-fed calves, and suggested that this was due to hunger. In the present study, daily lying time was reduced by 31 min/d in CML calves, and was characterized by a reduced number of shorter lying bouts between d36-42, the period prior to reduction in MR feeding frequency and volume for HML calves. As reported by Terr\u00e9, et al. [7] , calves offered lower levels of MR consume more concentrate. In the present study, and as will be reported elsewhere, average daily concentrate consumption between d5-42 was 190 g DM and 330 g DM for HML and CML calves, respectively (p < 0.001). As such it is likely that CML calves in the present study were spending more time standing to consume concentrate that HML calves. Calves offered chopped straw at 14 days of age (CS14) also displayed an increased number of shorter lying bouts during this period. Castells, et al. [11] reported differences in calf activity between calves offered alfalfa hay and those not provided with forage, it could be therefore that changes in behaviour observed in the present study were due to CS14 calves consuming the chopped straw. At 43 days of age, MR volume and feeding frequency was reduced in HML calves. During this period, lying time was reduced in these calves both in comparison to the pre-step down period and to that recorded in CML calves. A reduction in lying time was also observed in HML calves in the period following complete milk withdrawal. The decrease in lying time in HML calves is similar to that reported by Budzynska and Weary [28] and likely a sign of increased hunger following reduction in or withdrawal of MR. As indicated by de Passille, et al. [9] , a decrease in overall DMI due to reduced solid feed intake has been observed in calves offered high levels of MR in the pre-wean period even when managed in a gradual weaning program. The decrease in lying time in HML calves during this period of milk step down and complete weaning could therefore be due to HML calves spending longer standing to consume solid feed as a means of addressing the reduction in available feed energy. During d68-70, CS14 calves displayed increased lying time when compared to GS56 and NF calves. Calves spend more time ruminating whilst lying down [11] , as such it could be considered that rumen development was potentially more advanced at in calves offered forage at an earlier age and the increase in lying time was due to increased rumination. The lack of direct observations to distinguish specific behaviours such as feeding and rumination could be considered a limitation to the present study, future research could implement the use of calf appropriate rumination halters to allow feeding behaviours to be distinguished. However, the results do highlight how activity monitors could be used on-farm by producers to distinguish changes in behaviour as a result of changes in nutritional regime. Application of activity meters in group housed situations could also provide further information regarding the impact of feeding regime on diurnal behaviour of dairy calves.",

An increase in heart rate (HR) and decrease the root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD), a time domain measure of heart rate variability (HRV), have been linked to increased stress load [39] . In the present study measures of HR and HRV were comparable across the pre-wean period, however there was a reduction in RMSSD in HML calves following weaning. As HR and HRV measurements were collected when the calves were at rest [39] , this could indicate a potential increase in stress response and corresponds with the changes in lying behaviour observed in HML during this period. This again highlights that calves high levels of MR in the first weeks of life could display an increased stress response to withdrawal of MR when compared with calves previously fed a conventional level of MR. Adopting a more prolonged weaning approach whereby MR volume is reduced on a daily basis, such as that described by Sweeney, et al. [8] , may improve concentrate intake in calves fed high levels of MR and thus reduce stress associated with MR withdrawal.",

Providing calves with milk or milk replacer at a level equivalent to 10% of calf birth weight per day in two portions is an accepted industry standard and is designed to encourage earlier intake of solid feed [17] . However, it has been suggested that restricted feeding can impact negatively on growth rates and immune function in calves and thus may potentially increase susceptibility to disease [43] .",

            "text": "In the present study, it could have been considered that calves offered high (HML) levels of MR would have been less likely to suffer from ill-health when compared to those offered conventional (CML) levels of MR. However, comparable to that reported by Quigley, et al. [17] , HML calves in the present study had increased faecal scores between d14-20 and were more likely to receive treatment for diarrhoea than CML calves. In the study by Quigley, et al. [17] , calves fed either conventional or increased levels of MR were subject to transport stress and then housed in hutches where the bedding material had been contaminated with coronavirus. As increased incidence of morbidity and mortality was observed in calves provided with increased levels of MR in the study, this was directly apportioned to the feeding level, leading the authors to advise a cautionary approach if providing increased MR levels to calves under stress. Diaz, et al. [44] also reported increased faecal scores in calves offered increased levels of MR, however, this was considered to be as a result of the differences in total volume of feed and water consumed as opposed to disease. In the present study although faecal score was elevated in HML calves, it was below that considered indicative of neo-natal calf diarrhoea (NCD), suggesting that the increased scores were, as with Diaz, et al. [44] , likely as a result of the fact that HML calves were receiving 5l/day more MR than the CML calves. Additionally, anecdotal evidence within the present study indicated that scour was milky in colour, reinforcing the consideration that the higher faecal scores in HML calves was due to the higher initial MR volume as opposed to infection. Further research could aim to examine if scour scoring systems could be modified or improved to take into account the presence of milky scour. The average respiratory score observed in CML calves between days 56-62, although increased in comparison to HML calves, was again below the threshold score considered to be indicative of BRD. These results indicate that under the management conditions described, calves can be fed either increased or conventional levels of milk replacer without severe impact on health throughout the pre-wean period. This may have been influenced by the fact that calves were individually housed which has been shown to reduce health problems [45] . However, the increased faecal scores in the first 3 weeks of life in HML calves could suggest that it may be advisable to delay increasing MR levels until after this period when calves are less susceptible to enteric disease [46] .",

            "text": "One of the primary detectable physiological responses to infection and inflammation is a change in core body temperature, and as such it is often used as an indicator of ill-health [47] . In addition to illness, stress, a result of common management practices in early calfhood, can also result in changes in blood flow and thus heat production as a result of increased hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis activity [48] . Infrared thermography (IRT) has been indicated as a non-invasive and viable method of detecting these small changes in radiated temperature [49] and has been highlighted as a potential method for the early detection of ill-health [50] . In the present study, there was no difference in radiated temperature of the eye or rectal area, this suggesting that calves were able to maintain thermoregulation throughout the experimental period despite differences in MR feeding levels. This was particularly evident in the period following calf jacket removal, as it could have been anticipated that CML calves may have struggled to maintain thermoregulation when faced with the combined factors of reduced energy intake and lower ambient temperatures, however, no difference in temperature measurements were found. This could have been due to the fact that calves were 4 weeks of age at the time of calf jacket removal and, as such, were better able to withstand lower ambient temperatures [51] . At this age CML calves were also likely to be consuming greater amounts of solid feed [52] and thus nutritional energy was potentially sufficient to cope with increased heat production demands [53] as a result of exposure to lower ambient temperatures following calf jacket removal.",

            "text": "There is limited published research addressing the correlation between infrared (IR) temperature and core body temperature in very young calves. Although variable in the present study, correlation between IR eye temperature and core body temperature was within the range to that found in Jersey heifers by Salles, et al. [54] and comparable to the correlation between core body temperature and indwelling rumen bolus temperature reported by Knauer, et al. [55] . The reason for the variability in correlation is unknown and requires further investigation. However, it could be that IR temperature should be used as a standalone measure, wherein individual calves are used as their own control, particularly in situations when incidence of ill-health/pyrexia is low. The results of the present study suggest that IR temperatures were not affected by the MR feeding level. However, it may also be that the number of calves used in the experimental design was not sufficient to detect any differences as a result of feeding level. Additionally, there is limited information regarding the effects of feeding level on body temperature, an area requiring further investigation. Comparable to previous research [56] , in the present study, IRT was able to detect the febrile response linked to vaccination. Again, this response did not differ between MR treatments, however, it does highlight the potential for IRT to be used in the detection of pyrexia associated with symptoms of disease and, if automated as per Schaefer, et al. [57] , it could offer a less invasive option of continuous temperature assessment in young calves.",

However, changes in activity which could be linked with hunger as a result of conventional feeding levels and following reduction in MR volume in calves offered high levels of MR in early life were detectable using automatic activity sensors. Additionally, the higher lying time observed in CS14 calves between 68-70 days of age could point to increased rumination as a result of earlier forage introduction. This suggests that providing calves with a forage source in addition to concentrate feed could be beneficial to rumen development. In the present study, calves were individually housed which perhaps contributed to the low level of ill-health amongst calves. Calves were also monitored on a daily basis with a combination of traditional and novel indicators, this potentially resulting in earlier detection and treatment of ill-health, as such, future research should incorporate techniques described here into group housing systems. Results of the present study also provide evidence for the role of remote-sensing technologies within calf rearing systems. Using a range of traditional and novel methods increases the possibilities for collection of behavioural and physiological data. This will allow producers to obtain an overall indicator of calf well-being and responses to common management practices encountered in early life. Further research which aims to compare and correlate these technologies with hormonal, biochemical and immunological parameters could help in the development of early warning systems for calf health and welfare issues.",
