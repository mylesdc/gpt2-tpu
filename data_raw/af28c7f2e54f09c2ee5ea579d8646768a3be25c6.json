Dicistroviruses have been isolated from six invertebrate orders from the Insecta and decapod crustaceans [4] . In this study, multiple contig sequences from bat specimen b2 (Pipistrellus pipistrellus) displayed various HSPs related to the family Dicistroviridae, matching structural and nonstructural viral proteins in BLASTx analysis (Table S1 ). The low degree of nucleotide sequence identity observed, with overlapping regions for some of these HSP sequences, suggested that different dicistroviruses were present (data not shown). Based on the longest HSP sequence (1,819 nt) matching the ORF1 gene, a specific set of primers was designed and used to confirm the presence of dicistrovirus sequences in the lungs of specimen b2 (Table S1 and Fig. S1A ).",

We identified multiple read and contig sequences from pooled tissues of bat specimen b7 (Eptesicus serotinus) that matched nodavirus sequences in BLASTn and BLASTx analysis (Table S1 ). The presence of nodavirus sequences was further confirmed by PCR on the brain sample of this specimen (Table S1 and Fig. S2A ). Phylogenetic analysis performed after translation to obtain the amino-acid sequence encoded by this contig demonstrated that this virus, the Sers nodavirus, belonged to the genus Alphanodavirus, and was closely related to Boolarra virus (Fig. S2B) .

Most of these sequences displayed low levels of sequence identity to known viral proteins, suggesting the presence of new viral species. For example, in specimen b3 (Pipistrellus pipistrellus), we identified a putative new viral genus from Luteoviridae and a different viral species from the genus Sobemovirus. Luteoviruses are simple non enveloped, icosahedral viruses with one single-stranded, positive-sense RNA of about 6 kb in size encompassing several ORFs. ORF1-2 encodes the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (produced as a P1-P2 fusion protein). Luteoviruses are aphid-borne viruses that infect a diverse range of plants, including crop plants of interest to humans and animals. Specimen b3 yielded one contig sequence matching sequence in the luteovirus genome",
