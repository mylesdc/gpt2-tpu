            "text": "Transmission between hosts is a critical part of the viral lifecycle. Recent studies of viral transmission have used genome sequence data to evaluate the number of particles transmitted between hosts, and the role of selection as it operates during the transmission process. However, the interpretation of sequence data describing transmission events is a challenging task. We here present a novel and comprehensive framework for using shortread sequence data to understand viral transmission events, designed for influenza virus, but adaptable to other viral species. Our approach solves multiple shortcomings of previous methods for this purpose; for example, we consider transmission as an event involving whole viruses, rather than sets of independent alleles. We demonstrate how selection during transmission and noisy sequence data may each affect naive inferences of the population bottleneck, accounting for these in our framework so as to achieve a correct inference. We identify circumstances in which selection for increased viral transmission may or may not be identified from data. Applying our method to experimental data in which transmission occurs in the presence of strong selection, we show that our framework grants a more quantitative insight into transmission events than previous approaches, inferring the bottleneck in a manner that accounts for selection, both for within-host virulence, and for inherent viral transmissibility. Our work provides new opportunities for studying transmission processes in influenza, and by extension, in other infectious diseases.",

Population genetics can exploit genome sequence data to provide a great deal of insight into transmission processes. For example, the number of particles which found a new infection determine the extent to which genetic diversity is passed from host to host. The identification of genetic variants which increase the propensity of a pathogen to transmit from host to host is a valuable step in understanding how an infection might spread. Here we set out a new population genetic framework for understanding transmission events from genome sequence data collected before and after transmission.

The extent to which a virus is able to transmit between hosts determines whether it is likely to cause sporadic, local outbreaks, or spread to cause a global pandemic [1, 2] . In a transmission event, the transmission bottleneck, which specifies the number of viral particles founding a new infection, influences the amount of genetic diversity that is retained upon transmission, with important consequences for the evolutionary dynamics of the virus [3, 4] . Recent studies have used genome sequencing approaches to study transmission bottlenecks in influenza populations. In small animal studies, the use of neutral genetic markers has shown that the transmission bottleneck is dependent upon the route of transmission, whether by contact or aerosol transmission [5, 6] . In natural human influenza populations, where modification of the virus is not possible, population genetic methods have been used to analyse bottleneck sizes. Analyses of transmission have employed different approaches, exploiting the observation or non-observation of variant alleles [7] or using changes in allele frequencies to characterise the bottleneck under a model of genetic drift [8] [9] [10] [11] . A recent publication improved this latter model, incorporating the uncertainty imposed upon allele frequencies by the process of within-host growth [12] . Two studies of within-household influenza transmission have provided strikingly different outcomes in the number of viruses involved in transmission, with estimates of 1-2 [13] and 100-200 [14] respectively, albeit that the veracity of the data used to generate the latter result has recently been challenged [15] .",

Studies examining transmissibility have assessed the potential for different strains of influenza to achieve droplet transmission between ferrets under laboratory conditions [18] [19] [20] [21] ; ferrets provide a useful, if imperfect, model for transmission between humans [22, 23] . The application of bioinformatic techniques to data from these experiments has identified 'selective bottlenecks' in the experimental evolution of these viruses [24, 25] , whereby some genetic variants appear to be more transmissible than others. In these studies, selection has been considered in terms of the population diversity statistic \u03c0; changes in \u03c0 N /\u03c0 S , the ratio between non-synonymous and synonymous diversity, have been used to evaluate patterns of selection across different viral segments.",

Our approach correctly evaluates changes in a population even where the data describing that change are affected by noise. It explicitly accounts for the haplotype structure of a population, utilising the data present within short sequence reads. Further, where these factors can be discriminated, our method distinguishes between the influences on the population of selection and the transmission bottleneck. Studies of viral evolution have highlighted the potential for payoffs between within-host viral growth and transmissibility [55] ; given sufficient data we can evaluate how selection operates upon each of these phenotypes. Our model extends previous population genetic work on bottleneck inference to provide a more generalised model for the analysis of data spanning viral transmission events. Whilst the work presented here is modelled upon influenza viruses, the methods may be readily adapted to other viral species given minor modifications.",

We consider a scenario in Challenges arising in the inference of transmission bottlenecks from viral sequence data. Circles represent idealised viral particles characterised by four distinct alleles. A. Reductions in population diversity cannot necessarily be attributed unambiguously to either a population bottleneck, or the action of selection. In the illustrated case, either a tight bottleneck without selection or a large bottleneck with strong selection could explain the change in the population during transmission. B. Straightforward statistics describing a population may generate misleading inferences of population bottleneck size. In the illustrated case, the genetic structure of a population is changed by a population bottleneck during transmission, but the frequency of each allele within the which a viral population is transmitted from one host to another, with samples being collected before and after the transmission event (Fig 2A) . In our model viruses are categorised as haplotypes, according to the alleles they harbour at polymorphic sites in the genome. Such haplotypes are not directly observable from short-read sequencing data. However, after identifying polymorphisms in the data it is possible to use short-read data to identify a set of haplotypes which collectively explain the observed sequence data across the course of a transmission event [52, 57] . The viral population is then represented as a vector of frequencies of haplotypes in this set; the population before transmission is represented by the vector q B (B denoting 'Before transmission'). During transmission, a random sample of N T viruses are passed on to the second host to give the founder population q F . Selection for transmissibility, whereby genetic variants cause some viruses to be more transmissible than others, is described by the function S T . The potentially small size of the founder population means that the population evolves within the host under the influence of genetic drift to create the large post-transmission population q A (A denoting 'After transmission'); this process is approximated in our model by a Wright-Fisher sampling process (representing genetic drift) with effective population size N G . Selection acting for within-host growth may further alter the genetic composition of the population; this effect is described by the function S G . Our method thus allows for a discrimination to be made between selection for increased within-host replication and selection for increased viral transmissibility. Observations of the population are collected before and after transmission via a noisy sequencing process to give the datasets x B and x A . The extent of noise in the sampling and sequencing is characterised by the parameter C [52, 57] . Noise in our study was considered in terms of the precision with which the frequency of a variant can be specified by viral sequence data. Variant frequencies are measured in terms of the number of reads which report a given allele; in the absence of noise the uncertainty in the frequency would be that arising from a binomial distribution. Our noise parameter C describes the extent to which this uncertainty is increased. Smaller values of C increase the variance, reaching that of a non-informative uniform distribution at C = 0 whilst larger values represent lesser additional uncertainty, tending towards the binomial limit as C ! 1 (S1 Fig). Elsewhere we have noted that the parameter C and the absolute read depth of a sample can be converted into an 'effective depth' of sequencing [54] . In the limit of very deep sequencing the variance of an allele frequency tends towards that of a binomial distribution with sampling depth C + 1.",

Where selection existed the potential for it to be identified was greater at larger bottleneck sizes. These results can again be understood with respect to the dynamics of the system. The bottleneck has a stochastic effect on the population of a magnitude inversely related to the number of viruses transmitted. Inferring the presence of selection requires the identification of changes in the population going beyond what would be expected under neutrality, biasing the population in the direction of the selected allele or alleles. However, stochastic effects can by chance distort the population in one direction or another by more than the expectation; this leads to false inferences of selection. Genuine changes resulting from selection become easier to identify when the changes are themselves larger (stronger selection) or where the magnitude of the stochastic effect is reduced (higher N T ). While data from multiple replicate simulations made little difference to the inferred bottleneck size (see above), such data led to a more dramatic change in these results, with the false positive rate falling to zero for bottlenecks with N T \ufffd 20. The power of replicate experiments arises from the lower probability that stochastic effects will impose a consistent pattern of change upon multiple populations. While a larger-than-expected stochastic change in the frequency of a variant may occur in one system, leading to a false positive inference of selection, it is unlikely that the same pattern would recur across multiple replicates. While the inference of selection for transmissibility is not easy, the use of replicate experiments is of considerable value in this task; while, under our conservative approach, not all variants truly under selection were identified, those which were identified from replicate data were almost universally true positive calls.",

In the event that the stochastic change is aligned with the direction of selection, the presence of selection is more likely to be inferred, while the additional change in that direction will give an overestimate of selection.

By contrast, if not enough of this difference is accounted for as drift, the inferred bottleneck will be too low. In the approach of Leonard et al., the accounting made for genetic drift accounts for a variance equivalent to that incurred in a Wright-Fisher step of size N T , that is, with g = 1 (personal correspondance, Daniel Weissman).

This dataset provides high-resolution, whole-genome sequence data describing both the within-host evolution, and airborne transmission, of a 1918-like influenza virus, that became transmissible upon introduction of three key mutations, PB2 E627K, HA E190D and G225D. This three-mutant strain was denoted 'HA190D225D' and successfully transmitted in one of three ferret transmission pairs. Isolation and subsequent growth in MDCK cells of viruses from the contact ferret of the successful transmission led to the generation of the 'Mut' strain, which transmitted in two of three instances. A previous analysis of these data using linked variants on the HA segment identified an increase in the diversity of the viral population during within-host growth, and respectively 'loose' and 'stringent' bottlenecks in the transmission of the two strains. In the transmission of the Mut strain, the fixation of sequence variants, potentially due to selection, was observed, while the observation of two out of three, rather than one out of three, successful transmissions suggested that the Mut virus may have evolved increased fitness for infection. Within and between hosts, segment-wide and localised measures of synonymous and non-synonymous sequence diversity \u03c0 were used to assess the presence or absence of selection, leading to the conclusion that selection affected the system during transmission of the 'Mut' strain.",

In multiple studies, the transmission bottleneck has been found to be narrow during natural viral spread between hosts [62] . While acknowledging previous evidence for the existence of small transition bottlenecks in viral systems, we here note that a failure to account for selection and noise in the transmission process can decrease the bottleneck that is inferred from sequence data. Our approach is suitable for the analysis of acute infectious diseases such as influenza on the basis of a small number of observed transmission events; we note that where more substantial diversity is present in a within-host viral population, or where data are available from a large number of hosts in an outbreak, phylogenetic methods of evolutionary inference become of increasing value [63] [64] [65] .",

Where data have previously been interpreted as implying differential transmission bottlenecks between strains, our approach infers bottlenecks of similar sizes ranging from 2-6 viruses. Furthermore, where evidence has been interpreted to suggest a differing extent of transmissibility between strains, our approach attributes changes in the composition of the population to a mixture of stochastic effects and selection for increased within-host adaptation. Our result does not prove the absence of differential transmissibility among the viruses involved in this study; at the bottleneck size we inferred, selection is very hard to identify even where it does influence transmission. Rather, our claim is that under a parsimonious analysis of the data, apparent evidence for increased viral transmissibility can be explained by other evolutionary factors. Inferring parameters of transmission from viral sequence data Our study shows that the identification of variants conferring increased viral transmissibility is difficult when the number of transmitted viral particles is small. While improvements to our method may be achievable, this difficulty is fundamentally rooted in the nature of a transmission event; where a low number of virions are transmitted, the influence of stochastic processes becomes large, with variants fixing during transmission in a manner that cannot be distinguished from a selective sweep. The potential to infer the presence of selection increases at larger population size and given a greater number of replicate transmission events. However the amount of data required to make a statistically robust identification of a variant increasing viral transmissibility may be large. We note that, unlike more general inferences of selection from changes in viral diversity, our approach evaluates selection in terms of specific variants conveying an advantage or disadvantage for transmission. Where broad measures of diversity are calculated across segments of a genome, the background of genetic diversity across a large number of positions may be hard to separate from changes at individual positions under the action of selection.",

While selection may act differently for these latter two phenotypes [55] , their respective influences are intrinsically hard to separate when an infection is sparsely sampled. In our analysis the completeness of the collected data, covering both within-host adaptation and between-host transmission, was necessary to evaluate the cause of evolutionary change.",

One approach to exploring transmissibility (in influenza virus) has been the comparison, for different viruses, of the proportion of distinct animal pairs between which transmission occurs [66] . The statistical significance achievable in these studies is limited by the number of animal pairs that can be examined [67] [68] [69] . Furthermore, the comparison between one genotype and another may be confounded by viral heterogeneity, whereby each population contains a cloud of genetic diversity [24, 70] . As we have shown, data from replicate transmission events leads to an improved ability to infer selection, in particular by reducing the false positive rate of inference and by increasing the accuracy in inferred selection coefficients. We note, however, that the number of viral particles transmitted in each event is key in determining whether increased transmissibility can be identified; where a transmission bottleneck is narrow it is inherently difficult to identify selection against a background of the large changes in the population induced by stochastic effects. Where transmission bottlenecks are small, a large number of replicates might be needed to make statistically well-supported inferences of increased transmissibility. Applications of our method to simulated data could be used to gain an insight into what might be obtained from a particular experimental setup.",

By default we here approximate the within-host growth of the virus as a single multinomial draw, compressing growth to a single round of sampling, with the variance effective population size N G = gN T . By default we set the growth factor g to be equal to 22. This approach is distinct from the branching process used in another estimate of bottleneck size [72] ; our assumption that viruses infect different cells in the host, with competition between viruses occurring after the release of viruses from cells, leads to a Wright-Fisher-type population model, in which the rapid growth of the viral population leads to a smaller amount of genetic drift than inferred in that model. We note that our method can be extended to incorporate multiple rounds of within-host viral growth; a first approximation would be to reduce g to match the effective variance in frequencies induced by repeated rounds of growth.

However, in realistic cases, where there might be multiple haplotypes present, the number of possible outcomes grows combinatorially with N T , making this calculation intractable. Instead we consider a continuous approximation in which the random variables of the model (Fig 2A) are represented by multivariate normal distributions, each defined by a mean and covariance matrix. By ignoring higher order moments, we may then calculate the individual components of the system (Eq 2) by appealing to a moments based approach for the evaluation of integrals arising from marginalisation over unknown variables.

In this inference a revised approach to estimating the effective depth of sequencing was taken, noting our result that estimates which overestimate noise may lead to errors in the inferred bottleneck size. Here, in common with previous calculations, we initially identified a conservative value of C from within-host data using the default settings in SAMFIRE. Next, variant frequencies were evaluated, identifying potentially non-neutral changes in frequency using a single-locus analysis [52] . Finally, a more conservative estimate of C was calculated, using the set of trajectories which were identified as being consistent with a neutral model of frequency change.",

Adaptive BIC. Noting previous discussion of the complexity of using BIC in biological modelling [86] , we here adopted a machine-learning approach to the interpretation of BIC statistics. Classically, a difference of 10 units of BIC has been held to represent strong evidence in favour of the additional parameter [58] . Consistent with previous approaches this heuristic was used in the inference of within-host selection; in this case the final model parameters make only small refinements to the inferred fitness landscape [52] . In the inference of transmission, errors in model selection have more severe consequences for the inferred bottleneck size and selection model. Using a fixed difference of 10 BIC units for model selection resulted in an overestimation of the extent of selection with a high false positive rate (S14 Fig). As such, we generated and analysed simulated data to identify the optimal interpretation of BIC differences. Given a real dataset for analysis, simulated data was generated describing systems with equivalent numbers of gene segments and polymorphic loci to the real dataset, being observed with an equal number of reads spanning each set of loci, and with reads containing an amount of information specified by the parameter C inferred for the real dataset.",

BIC penalty values in the range [10, 200] were examined, with smaller BIC penalty values leading to inferences with a larger number of selection coefficients and vice versa. For each BIC penalty value, the difference between the bottleneck inference of the optimal model (under BIC) and the baseline expectation was summed for the three datasets to give a statistic describing the accuracy of the inferred bottlenecks, this statistic being expressed as a function of the real transmission bottleneck N T and the BIC penalty (S15B Fig). Finally, linear and decay exponential models were fitted to this data via regression, selecting the BIC penalty model which minimised the error in the inferred bottlenecks from the simulation data.

A list of potential haplotypes (see [52] for details) are constructed. A noise parameter C and potential within-host selection is inferred using SAMFIRE. The transmission code is used for generating simulated data based on the experimental data. Transmission bottleneck and selection is inferred for the simulated data and BIC penalty curves are determined. A final inference of bottleneck and transmissibility is carried out on the real data taking into account the BIC penalty curves. This process will be greatly simplified in the case where only a neutral estimate of the transmission bottleneck is required. Quick-start and step-by-step guides can be found in the online transmission repository. A) The ratio of the median inferred bottleneck to the true bottleneck is plotted against the true bottleneck size. As shown in Fig 3, as the bottleneck increases, our ability to infer it correctly decreases due to noise. In order to account for this phenomenon, a straight line is fitted to the data aiming to capture the general trend. B) Heat map of the bottleneck-specific statistic plotted against BIC penalty and bottleneck size. The plot was generated for three datasets with selection coefficients s = {0, 1, 2} and a simple statistic based on bottleneck differences was employed. More specifically, the median bottleneck was computed across 200 seeds and the bottleneck-statistic was defined as the absolute value of the difference between the median inferred bottleneck and the true bottleneck multiplied by the baseline determined in A). By considering bottlenecks in the range [5, 100] and BIC penalty values in the range [10, 200] , a heat map was produced and linear and decay exponential regression were conducted seeking to minimise the sum of the statistic across the values of N T that were considered.
