Studies on the modes of transmission of SARS are limited though a number of outbreak studies have revealed the possible airborne route. To develop more specific and effective control strategies, we conducted a detailed mechanism-based investigation that explored the role of fomite transmission in the well-known Ward 8A outbreak. We considered three hypothetical transmission routes, i.e., the long-range airborne, fomite and combined routes, in 1,744 scenarios with combinations of some important parameters. A multi-agent model was used to predict the infection risk distributions of the three hypothetical routes. Model selection was carried out for different scenarios to compare the distributions of infection risk with that of the reported attack rates and select the hypotheses with the best fitness. Our results reveal that under the assumed conditions, the SARS coronavirus was most possible to have spread via the combined long-range airborne and fomite routes, and that the fomite route played a non-negligible role in the transmission.",

Since the index inpatient was weak and bedridden [30] , we excluded the possibility of the close contact route from the index patient to other inpatients and identified three hypotheses, namely the single-route long-range airborne transmission (Hypothesis 1 [Long Air]), the single-route fomite transmission (Hypothesis 2 [Fomite] ) and the two-route combination (Hypothesis 3 [Long Air + Fomite]). Based on a typical 3-shift rotation over 24 hours, six routine round patterns of healthcare workers (HCWs) were considered. A multi-agent model ( Fig  2) was developed to simulate the possible spread of the viruses from the index patient to the susceptible by air flow and surface touching, and to calculate the possible exposure doses and infection risks for each hypothesis. Model selection was carried out in 1,744 scenarios with various combinations of 4 important parameters. The results reported as follows provide probable evidence for the additional fomite transmission of the SARS-CoV under assumed conditions.",

The index patient was a 26-year-old man who developed fever and cough on February 24, 2003 and was admitted to Bed 11 in Ward 8A on March 4 [32] . As his condition deteriorated with difficulty in expectorating sputum, he was treated with salbutamol via a jet nebulizer four times a day from March 6 to March 12 to facilitate mucociliary clearance [20] . On March 13, 2003 , after he was identified as the index patient for the outbreak, he was transferred to an isolation room [20] . Thus, the period of March 4-12, 2003 was taken as the suspected exposure period.",

In addition, in the scenario in which doctors or nurses allocated the patients in the order in which they checked in, the inpatients for whom a doctor or a nurse took responsibility might have been random. In that scenario, each doctor and each nurse examined a random nine or ten inpatients (e.g., circles of four colours in Fig 3G and Figure D (vii) in S1 File) in the ward in clockwise and anticlockwise directions in Patterns 5 and 6, respectively.",

In this study, the viral loads during the exposure period (March 4-12, 2003) were assumed to vary according to the measured data of Peiris et al. [33] , increasing at first, reaching a peak on the 10th day after the onset of symptoms and then decreasing. Therefore, the viral load coefficient was defined as the ratio of the viral load in the computation to the average values in [33] . The coefficient was assumed to be constant for the total exposure period. To reduce the number of variables, \u03b7 r , \u03b7 m and c L were combined as the products \u03b7 r c L and \u03b7 m c L , defined as the dose effects of introducing c L mRNA copies of SARS-CoV to the respiratory tract and mucous membranes, respectively.",

Virus-containing airborne droplets were generated by the index patient in the source cubicle, leading to the highest virus concentration in the air in the source cubicle (Figure C in S1 File) and thus the highest infection risk (Fig 3B) . Due to the small temperature differences between zones, two-way airflow occurred at each inner opening in the ward [35] , so some virus-containing airborne droplets spread to other cubicles by airflow. As the remote cubicles were farther away from the source than the adjacent cubicle was, the airborne droplet concentrations in the former were further diluted than that in the latter (Figure C in S1 File), leading to lower infection risk (Fig 3B) . With the high mechanical ventilation rates in Ward 8A, the results from both CFD simulations [20] and multi-zone modelling methods ( [35] and Figure C in S1 File) show that the aerosol concentration in the source cubicle was much higher than that in the adjacent cubicle. Therefore, the difference between infection risks (Fig 3B) in the source and adjacent cubicles was very large (1:0.43 in this scenario), which was inconsistent with the small difference (1:0.80) in the reported attack rate distribution (Fig 3A) . Although several studies showed the very probable evidences for the airborne transmission of SARS such as in the Amoy Gardens outbreak [19] , the inconsistence suggests that the outbreak might not merely be induced by the long-range airborne route.",

Nevertheless, as for Pattern 1, the difference between infection risks (Fig 3D) in the source and adjacent cubicles was too large (1:0.35 in this scenario) and not consistent with the small difference (1:0.80) in the reported attack rate distribution (Fig 3A) . In contrast, for Pattern 5, the difference between infection risks (Fig 3H) in the source and remote cubicles was too small (1:0.52 in this scenario), not consistent with the large difference (1:0.28) in the reported attack rate distribution (Fig 3A) . respectively. Since the distribution of reported attack rates in this SARS outbreak exhibited a statistically significant pattern (P = 0.0015, Pearson chi-square test), in many scenarios the minimum RSS were larger than 2.5525 (small black dots in Fig 4) , indicating large deviations from the outbreak data. Therefore, these scenarios were regarded as less probable ones.",

In Table 2 , in scenarios with the minimum RSS for Hypothesis 3 [Long air + Fomite], the fomite route plays a non-negligible role in transmission, contributing at least 37% to the infection risk.

First, most of the human behaviour was assumed in the multi-agent model (Tables G and H in S1 File) because relevant descriptions were not available in the literature. The information of human behaviours were very important for our model. As shown in this study, the routine round patterns of doctors and nurses influenced the infection risk patterns (Fig 3 and Figure D in S1 File) and hypothesis probabilities (Fig 4, Tables 1 and 2 ). In addition, the diversity of modes of HCWs visiting patients was not considered in this study. Different patients might have required different frequencies, intensities, or HCWS visiting patterns, which might bring in more deviations in infection risk distributions. In future, more detailed information about human behaviours of representative people such as patients, HCWs and visitors in healthcare settings should be reported for outbreaks of infectious diseases. Second, some parameters for the biological properties of SARS-CoV in the multi-agent model were not available, such as the transfer rates between surfaces (Table C in S1 File) and the first-order inactivation rates in the air and on surfaces (Table D in S1 File), and were estimated or replaced by those of other viruses or even bacteria. Moreover, several parameters such as dose response parameters might be variable from patient to patient, but the individual differences were not considered in this study, which decreases the diversity of predicted infection risk distributions. Experimental investigations of SARS-CoV are lacking mainly because of safety considerations [18] ; and several authors have suggested 229E, a low-virulence human coronavirus [45] , as a surrogate [18, 40] . In future, more experimental measurements of parameters for the biological properties of SARS-CoV or the surrogate, 229E, are needed.",

Ignoring the individual differences in the exposure periods reduces the diversity of infection risk distributions, and leads to omission of several possible scenarios. Moreover, the transmission from early-onset cases to the later cases might have occurred, according to the illness onset dates reported by Li et al. [20] . Neglecting the exposure doses caused by these early-onset cases results in underestimation of infection risk for other cases, which affects the distribution patterns of infection risk in the ward.
