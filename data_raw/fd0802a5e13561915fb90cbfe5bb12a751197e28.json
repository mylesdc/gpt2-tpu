In the present study, we aimed to identify novel protein receptor targets for TCDD using computational and in vitro validation experiments. Interestingly, results from computational methods predicted that Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor 1 (VEGFR1) could be one of the potential targets for TCDD in both mouse and humans. Results from molecular docking studies showed that human VEGFR1 (hVEGFR1) has less affinity towards TCDD compared to the mouse VEGFR1 (mVEGFR1). In vitro validation results showed that TCDD can bind and phosphorylate hVEGFR1. Further, results from molecular dynamic simulation studies showed that hVEGFR1 interaction with TCDD is stable throughout the simulation time. Overall, the present study has identified VEGFR1 as a novel target for TCDD, which provides the basis for further elucidating the role of TCDD in angiogenesis.",

There are certain unavoidable shortcomings in predicting the novel targets for new chemicals or ligands due to time-consuming and expensive nature of the experimental methods to predict. Several novel computational methods and algorithms have emerged in recent years to predict possible biological targets for ligands [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] .

Results from PharmMapper along with their respective normalized fit score, are provided in the Supplementary Table S1a,b.

Moreover, we submitted TCDD to SwissTargetPrediction server which combines both 2D and 3D similarity measures with known ligands for knowledge-based prediction of potential targets 30 . Results from molecular target prediction by SwissTargetPrediction tool provided several possible interacting targets for TCDD in Mus musculus and Homosapiens. These include VEGFR1 and AhR, as well as several other targets as detailed in Supplementary Table 2a,b. Among these predicted targets, VEGFR1 and AhR showed a high probability of interaction in Mus musculus whereas in Homosapiens Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3, Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 along with VEGFR1 and AhR showed a high probability of interaction. The other receptors showed low (range: 0-0.08) probabilities of interaction with targets based on ChEMBL database. Results from SwissTargetPrediction by homology showed that TCDD was predicted to interact with enzymes (67%), Protease (13%), kinase (7%), transcription factor (7%) and cytosolic (7%) in Mus musculus ( Supplementary Fig. S1A ).

To elucidate the structural insight of mVEGFR1, we predicted the three-dimensional structure using homology modeling ( Fig. 2A) based on the template structure of hVEGFR1 in complex with a ligand (PDB ID: 3HNG). For hVEGFR1, the X-ray crystal structure of placental growth factor in complex with domain 2 of VEGFR1 31 downloaded from protein databank (PDB ID: 1RV6) was considered for our study (Fig. 2B) . The generated three-dimensional model for mVEGFR1 was validated using the Ramachandran plot. Results from Ramachandran plot analysis showed 97.8% of the residues (352 amino acids) in favoured region, 1.9% of the residues (7 amino acids) in allowed region and 0.3% of the residues (1 amino acid) in outlier region (Fig. S2A) . One of the parameter to represent and measure the overall quality and deviation of the total energy of the protein structure is Z-score which is dependent upon the length of protein 28 . Results from PROSA web analysis showed the Z-score of the mVEGFR1 is displayed in the plot with a dark black point (Fig. S2B) . The Z-score value of the generated mVEGFR1 model is \u22126.37, which is within the acceptable range \u221210 to 10 and is located within the space of proteins related to the NMR and X-ray (Fig. S2B ).

Another stereochemical test to assess the quality of a modelled structure is ERRAT, which analyses the dimension of structural error for each residue and statistics of non-bonded interactions between different atoms in a 3D Structure model. Results from ERRAT plot analysis showed an overall quality factor of 80.240 indicating that the generated model is stable and reliable (Fig. S2C) .

It is known that toxicities induced by TCDD are mediated through AhR, a ligand-activated transcription factor belonging to the basic helix-loop-helix-PAS family 30 . Among the different domains of AhR, ligand binding domain plays a key role in binding to the TCDD 33, 34 . Therefore, initially we aligned the sequences of mVEGFR1 and hVEGFR1 with that of the AhR ligand binding domain to predict the conserved amino acids and calculated the total number of atoms belonging to these amino acids, TC a (Supplementary Table S3 ). To identify the pocket sites and to elucidate the atoms and amino acids lining each pocket, we used three binding pocket prediction servers: CastP, a web server 35 ; Active site, an online server which calculates different cavity sites of a protein and analyses the xyz coordinates on the cavity; and FTsite, a web based server that calculates the binding site residues using solvent mapping algorithm 36, 37 . Scoring results (Supplementary Data 1), of CastP and Active site servers were provided in the Supplementary Tables S4 and S5. Results from FTsite were shown in the Supplementary  Fig. S3A ,B.

Results showed that [3 H]-TCDD levels significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner in VEGFR1-coated wells www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ ( Fig. 4A ). The detection of [3 H]-TCDD was significantly increased at all three doses (250, 500, 1000 ng/ml) compared to respective non-coated well counterparts, indicating the specific binding of TCDD with hVEGFR1 ( Fig. 4B ). To check whether this specific binding of TCDD to hVEGFR1 could be blocked using antibody or another ligand, such as VEGF-165, specific for this receptor, we performed blocking studies with VEGF-165. Results showed that the wells, pre-incubated with either VEGF-165 or anti-VEGFR1 (1000 ng/ml) showed decreased levels of [3 H]-TCDD compared to those coated with only TCDD (Fig. 4C ). These results indicated that TCDD specifically binds to hVEGFR1 and that this binding can be blocked with either competing ligands (VEGF-165) or antibodies for the receptor. Further, results from the phosphorylation of VEGFR1 in vitro in HUVEC cells, showed that TCDD can induce VEGFR1 phosphorylation (Fig. 4D) , suggesting that the receptor may indeed be activated by TCDD. Overall, these results demonstrated that TCDD can specifically bind, block and phosphorylate hVEGFR1.",

MDS has been used successfully in elucidating ligand-induced perturbations in several studies reported previously [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] . In the present study, to analyse the conformational changes between hVEGFR1 and hVEGFR1-TCDD complexes, we performed MDS. To determine the stability of interactions and mechanistic aspects of hVEGFR1-TCDD interaction, we performed RMSD and Rg calculations. Figure 5A ,B demonstrated the RMSD of the backbone and C-alpha residues in hVEGFR1 and hVEGFR1-TCDD complex. The magnitude of fluctuations indicated that both hVEGFR1 and hVEGFR1-TCDD complex backbone and C-alpha systems attained stable equilibration conformations during the first 20-60 ns and showed an increase during the last 20 ns of the simulation (Fig. 5A ). Results showed that there is not much change in back bone (0.11 \u00b1 0.0 nm) and C-alpha (0.12 \u00b1 0.0 nm) average RMSD for hVEGFR1-TCDD complex compared to hVEGFR1 (0.11 \u00b1 0.0 nm, 0.12 \u00b1 0.0 nm). These results demonstrated that TCDD doesn't influence the stability of hVEGFR1 system upon binding. To analyse the compactness or spatial spread of protein mass 36 for each protein system upon binding to TCDD during the simulations, we calculated the Rg of backbone and C-alpha alpha atom for hVEGFR1 and hVEGFR1-TCDD complex systems. Figure 5C ,D shows the Rg of the backbone and C-alpha residues in hVEGFR1 and hVEGFR1-TCDD complex. Results showed that there is no significant difference in the back bone (1.21 nm) and C-alpha (1.21 nm) average Rg for hVEGFR1-TCDD complex compared to hVEGFR1 (1.21 nm, 1.22 nm). These results demonstrated that TCDD binding doesn't influence on the stability and compactness of hVEGFR1 system. Overall, these results showed that the binding of TCDD did not affect the overall conformational diversity of the hVEGFR1 protein system significantly.",

These results again confirmed that the binding of TCDD did not significantly affect the hVEGFR1 protein system overall conformational diversity. Our molecular docking results showed a hydrogen bond between TCDD and Thr 210 residue of the hVEGFR1. Using the g_hbond tool of GROMACS, we determined the number of hydrogen bonds and their occupancy in the hVEGFR1-TCDD complex during the MDS. Figure 6B shows the hydrogen bonds in the hVEGFR1-TCDD complex during the MDS. Results showed that the hydrogen bond formed between Thr www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ 210 and hVEGFR1 was stable during the first 20 ns but fluctuated substantially during the later last 20 ns of MD simulations (Fig. 6B) . Overall, these data showed that the hydrogen bonds at the docking level (Fig. 3B) were maintained during the MD simulations. To characterize the global effect of TCDD on the hVEGFR1 dynamics, we calculated the fluctuations of pairwise amino acid distances on all possible residue pairs in both hVEGFR1 and hVEGFR1-TCDD complex. Figure 6C shows mean contact distances between residues observed during MD simulation in hVEGFR1 and hVEGFR1-TCDD complex. Results showed that the patterns of flexibility/rigidity in the hVEGFR1-TCDD complex are highly similar to the ones in the hVEGFR1 only (Fig. 6C) . Results showed that there is small difference in the average mean distance between the residues in the hVEGFR1-TCDD (1046.38) complex compared to the hVEGFR1 (1047.92), thereby demonstrating that TCDD binding may be mechanistically relevant and may regulate the functionally oriented aspects of hVEGFR1 conformational dynamics.",

In the present study, we used both in silico and in vitro approaches to predict and confirm new protein targets for TCDD. www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Initially we used PharmMapper, a web based server that uses Pharmacophore approach for predicting novel protein targets for the chemicals or small molecules by integrating information in TargetBank, BindingDB, DrugBank and potential drug target database, including over 7000 receptor-based pharmacophore models 29 . PharmMapper has been successful in previous studies such as for predicting the anti-inflammatory effects of Shufengjiedu Capsule 10 , antitumor evaluation of some new 1,2,4-triazines 27 , inhibition of lipopolysaccharides-induced nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeats family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation by hydroxysafflor yellow A 12 , identification of a potential target for Capsaicin 13 , identification of anti-cancer targets for Punica granatum 14 , and several similar targets 15, 16, 40 . Results from our analysis using PharmMapper showed no identical protein targets for TCDD in both human and mouse (Supplementary Table S1a,b).

Results from SwissTargetPrediction showed VEGFR1 as identical protein target for TCDD other than AhR predicted in both human and mouse (Supplementary Table S2a,b) .",

Molecular docking has been successful previously in several studies including elucidating the binding mechanism of looped host defence peptide CLP-19 to microtubules 42 , novel inhibitors of anthrax edema factor 43 , exploring the molecular mechanism of pathogenesis caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa 44 and several other studies 7, 45, 46 . Results from our molecular docking experiments showed that mVEGFR1 has high affinity towards TCDD compared to hVEGFR1 (Fig. 3) . Further, results from the molecular docking studies were validated in vitro using the binding assays and phosphorylation of TCDD with hVEGFR1. Results showed that TCDD can specifically bind to hVEGFR1 (Fig. 4A-C) and phosphorylate hVEGFR1 (Fig. 4D) . www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ To analyse and explore the underlying structural features and mode of action of TCDD -hVEGFR1 interactions, we performed molecular dynamics simulations (MDS). In principle, MDS provides the time evolution of atomistic models of proteins 8, 47, 48 . MDS has been successful in several studies including analysis of interactions of a novel benzenediamine derivate FC-99 interaction with its target in experimental sepsis 9 and in studying the interferon and innate immunity resistance in Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Non-Structural Protein 3 49 . To study the stability of interaction, we calculated the RMSD, Rg, RMSF, hydrogen bonding and mean residue distance parameters for hVEGFR1 and hVEGFR1-TCDD complex. Our results showed that the hVEG-FR1-TCDD complex interaction was stable throughout the simulation (Figs 5 and 6) . Overall, results from MDS showed that TCDD interaction with hVEGFR1 was stable and may functionally regulate the conformational dynamics of hVEGFR1.",

The VEGF family includes VEGF-A, VEGF-B, VEGF-C, VEGF-D, and placenta growth factor (PlGF) 50 . VEGFs bind primarily to three endothelial transmembrane receptors, VEGFR1, VEGFR2, and VEFGR3. VEGFR1/FLT-1 (fms-like tyrosine kinase) belongs to the receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) subfamily 50 . VEGFR1 plays a crucial role in normal development and angiogenesis. Thus, targeted deletion of VEGFR-1, results in early embryonic lethality due to abnormal blood vessel growth 42 . However, it is noteworthy that VEGFR1 may play both negative and positive roles in angiogenesis 43 . Because VEGFR1 is expressed on both endothelial and nonendothelial cells such as immune cells and tumor cells, it may be associated with additional functions such as inflammation and tumorigenesis 44, 45 . Recent studies also found that pharmacological inhibition www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ and genetic deletion of endothelial VEGFR1 enhanced adipose angiogenesis and in a diet-induced obesity model, endothelial-VEGFR1 deficiency exhibited a potent anti-obesity effect 46 .",

It is well established that TCDD is toxic to vascular development especially during embryonic stage, which has been seen in several species tested 40 . However, there are very few published reports that link TCDD or its receptor, AhR, to VEGF family. For example, AhR agonists or TCDD were shown to increase VEGF secretion in bronchial epithelial cells 41 and in the ocular tissues 51 , consistent with our previous studies demonstrating that treatment of mice with TCDD enhanced the expression of several genes involved in angiogenesis, specifically VEGF 52 . In contrast, TCDD-mediated coronary vascularization was found to be associated with reduced VEGF-A secretion. A previous report showed that TCDD differentially suppresses the angiogenic responses in human placental vein and artery endothelial cells 50 . Furthermore, compounds such as [3-(3,5-dimethyl-1H-pyrrol-2-ylmethylene)-1,3-dihydro-indole-2-one] (SU5416) were shown to have activity as a VEGFR-2 inhibitor and an AhR agonist 34 .

Target receptors for TCDD was predicted using PharmMapper 29 , a web based server for identifying the potential targets of a given molecule, and SwissTargetPrediction 30 , a knowledge-based approach to predict new targets of an uncharacterized molecule or secondary targets for a known molecule, computationally. PharmMapper identifies the potential targets for a given molecule using reverse pharmacophore mapping approach where target proteins with highest fit scores between corresponding pharmacophore models and query compounds are predicted as potential targets 33 . SwissTargetPrediction predicts the targets for bioactive molecules based on combination of 2D and 3D similarity measures with known ligands. The predictions can be carried out in five different organisms including Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, Bos Taurus and Equus caballus 30 . Homology modeling, structure refinement and validation. Three-dimensional structure for mVEGFR1 is not available. Therefore, the amino acid sequence of mouse VEGFR1 (mVEGFR1), was downloaded from the Uniprot database 55 (UniProtKB entry: P35969) and subjected to homology modeling. Amino acid residues from 797-1158 were used for model generation. To model the mVEGFR1 structure, the crystal structure of the human VEGFR1 in complex with N-(4-Chlorophenyl)-2-((pyridin-4-ylmethyl)amino)benzamide (PDB ID: 3 HNG) was chosen as a template structure which shared a sequence identity of 92% (the sequence identity was calculated by the NCBI blastp-suite (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) 56 with the target sequence. To generate homology models for mVEGFR1, MODELLER 9.14 57 program was used. The quality of the generated mVEGFR1 homology models were assessed using RAM-PAGE sever 58 for stereo chemical geometry and ProSA web server 59 for energy assessment. RMSD between the model and the template was calculated using the CLICK web server (http://mspc.bii.a-star.edu.sg/minhn/click.html) 60 . The amino acid environment of modelled structure was evaluated using ERRAT program plots 26 , which assess the distribution of different types of atoms with respect to one another in the protein model and determines the false statistics of bad non-bonded interactions. The validated model was subjected to energy minimization using NOMADRef server 61 with conjugate gradient method and chosen for further study. For human VEGFR1 (hVEGFR1), crystal structure of placental growth factor in complex with domain 2 of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1(PDB ID: 1RV6) 31 downloaded from Protein Data Bank (PDB) 22 was used for further study.",

The system was subjected to equilibration at a temperature 300 K and a pressure 1 bar. Finally, the full system was subjected to 100 ns MDS and the atom coordinates were recorded every 2 ps during the simulation for later analyses.
