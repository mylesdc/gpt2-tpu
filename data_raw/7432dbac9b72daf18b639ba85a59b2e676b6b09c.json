            "text": "Periparturient cows have been found to reveal immunosuppression, frequently associated with increased susceptibility to uterine and mammary infections. To improve understanding of the causes and molecular regulatory mechanisms accounting for this phenomenon around calving, we examined the effect of an antigen challenge on gene expression modulation on cows prior to (BC) or after calving (AC) using whole transcriptome sequencing (RNAseq). The transcriptome analysis of the cows' blood identified a substantially higher number of loci affected in BC cows (2,235) in response to vaccination compared to AC cows (208) and revealed a divergent transcriptional profile specific for each group. In BC cows, a variety of loci involved in immune defense and cellular signaling processes were transcriptionally activated, whereas protein biosynthesis and posttranslational processes were tremendously impaired in response to vaccination. Furthermore, energy metabolism in the blood cells of BC cows was shifted from oxidative phosphorylation to the glycolytic system. In AC cows, the number and variety of regulated pathways involved in immunomodulation and maintenance of immnunocompetence are considerably lower after vaccination, and upregulation of arginine degradation was suggested as an immunosuppressive mechanism. Elevated transcript levels of erythrocyte-specific genes involved in gas exchange processes were a specific transcriptional signature in AC cows pointing to hematopoiesis activation. The divergent and substantially lower magnitude of transcriptional modulation in response to vaccination in AC cows provides evidence for a suppressed immune capacity of early lactating cows on the molecular level and demonstrates that an efficient immune response of cows is related to their physiological and metabolic status.",

Potential causal relationships between periparturient metabolism and immune function have been examined in numerous studies (e.g., [3, [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] ). Various hypotheses have been put forward that attribute the impairment of immune functions around the time of calving to endocrine or metabolic changes that appear to be linked to the initiation of milk production and related to the mobilization of endogenous body reserves to enable milk production. For instance, high non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) concentrations observed in early lactation (e.g., [12] ) are discussed to be associated with impaired lymphocyte proliferation and polymorphonuclear leukocyte functions [8, 9, 13] . Proliferation and IL4 secretion of peripheral blood mononuclear cells were found to be negatively correlated with the concentration of serum NEFA [8] .",

The parameter for the cluster analysis was the normalized difference (in counts per million reads, cpm) between pre and post-vaccination sampling for each individual and each locus. Only loci with a minimum expression > 1 cpm in each of the 24 samples were included. Cluster analysis was performed using PermutMatrix [24] for calculation of Euklidian Distance applying McQuitty's criteria for linkage rule and Multiple-fragment heuristic (MF) for Tree Seriation rule. Differential expression analysis was performed using the EdgeR algorithm [25] . After calculation of the normalization factor, the effect on gene expression was calculated applying the model: counts = individual + treatment. Multiple testing by calculating the false discovery rate (FDR) according to [26] was accounted for when testing for statistical significance.

Furthermore, cow 5, a purebred German Holstein cow, segregated separately (Fig 1) , which is obviously owing to its different breed origin (GH), whereas the genetic background of all other individuals in the experiment is a Charolais x German Holstein (CH x GH) F 2 cross (Table 1 ).

The early lactating AC cows are in a physiological stage that is associated with metabolic changes due to the onset of lactation. In dairy cows, this stage is frequently associated with a shifting of the metabolism into a severe negative energy balance, as the energy demands for lactogenesis exceed energy intake (e.g., [28] [29] [30] ). Coping with these considerable metabolic challenges associated with lactation is of first priority for cows in the early lactation period. It has been documented in several studies that this intense metabolic burden may have a negative impact on immune functions of cows in the periparturient period [4, 7, [9] [10] [11] 31, 32] . Wathes et al. [15] showed that global gene expression and immune response were altered in cows with severe negative energy balance and concluded that uterine involution and elimination of contaminant bacteria will be delayed in cows with negative energy balance post calving.",

Additional burden due to the intervention in the immune system by exposure to vaccination cannot be defended adequately in the AC cows compared to the BC cows.

Ingenuity canonical pathway analysis in the BC group highlighted the EIF2 signaling and EIF4 and p70S6K signaling as most significantly enriched pathways ( Table 3 , S10 Table) in response to vaccination indicating a strongly modulated protein biosynthesis on the step of translational regulation, which is also supported by the functional enrichment analyses of GO terms and KEGG pathways (S4 and S8 Tables). IPA analysis showed that these two pathways are represented by numerous affected genes, of which 14% were upregulated and 40% were downregulated. Out of the 30 most significantly vaccination-affected loci in the BC group (S2 Table) , eight loci encode ribosomal proteins (RPL34, RPL37A, RPL27, RPL31, RPL38, RPS21, RP36AL, RPL21) and additional five loci are related to them (LOC100848726, LOC784243, LOC782021, LOC100296205, LOC790088). Concordantly, all of them were highly significantly downregulated after vaccination in BC cows (S2 Table) . The substantial downregulation of protein biosynthesis in the BC group is in agreement with the upregulation of DR1 (S2 Table) , the down-regulator of transcription and negative cofactor of TATA box protein binding, which is known to inhibit the assembly of the RNA polymerase II preinitiation complex [42] . A vaccination-induced downregulation of the protein biosynthesis process was not observed in AC cows. Details regarding downregulation of protein translation as primary mechanism to protect the individual against virus replication by preventing viral structural protein synthesis have been discussed in our previous report [19] . The mechanism including the protection against viral dsRNA via inhibition of protein synthesis is obviously a main immune response in cows vaccinated prior to parturition. This mechanism seems to be impaired in cows vaccinated in the period after calving, consequently, the AC cows are compromised regarding the ability to incapacitate virus replication and spread by activating the respective antiviral processes regulating the shut-off of protein synthesis.",

In the BC group, the large number of most significantly enriched canonical pathways indicates that a wide spectrum of signal cascades involved in immune defense is substantially modulated in response to antigen challenge (Table 3, S10 Table) . The focus is on signaling mechanisms associated with immune response and anti-inflammatory actions, like cytokine signaling, JAK/stat signaling, glucocorticoid receptor signaling, NF-kB activation by viruses, B cell and T cell receptor signaling and PI3K/AKT signaling. Furthermore, several hormone signaling pathways were found to be enriched, like prolactin, estrogen receptor, glucocorticoid receptor and growth hormone signaling, which are involved in categories like reproduction, growth, differentiation and development and also have a close association to processes related to immune response. Furthermore, canonical pathways targeting cellular differentiation, development, growth, survival (mTOR signaling, FLT3 signaling in hematopoietic progenitor cells, erythropoietin and thrombopoietin signaling, IGF-1, GM-CSF, FAK, HGF, CNTF, VEGF, ERK5, rac and myc-mediated apoptosis signaling) as well as cellular pathways Functional enrichment pathway analysis for the set of genes differentially regulated by vaccination was determined using the IPA software. The ratio provides the proportion of genes in the respective canonical pathway, which are significantly differentially expressed after vaccination, relative to all genes present in the pathway. The proportion of upregulated and downregulated genes in the respective pathway is indicated. The table provides the pathways most significantly modulated (statistical significance: p<5.0E-05). A full list of differentially expressed genes assigned to the pathway is provided in S10 of adhesion, communication and migration (integrin signaling) were modulated at a highly significant magnitude. All of these pathways are represented by a variety of genes that followed a predominant trend of upregulation (Table 3, S10 Table) and suggest a comprehensive and coordinated immune reaction in the blood transcriptome of the BC cows for protection against antigen exposure, a transcriptional signature divergent to the AC cows. Specific regulation of transcriptional immune defense response in cows vaccinated after calving. Compared to the BC cow group, the number and the variety of different canonical pathways involved in immunomodulation and maintenance of immnunocompetence are considerably lower in the blood transcriptome of AC cows (Table 4 ) highlighting again the reduced immune response in cows vaccinated after calving. However, a slight but coordinated upregulation of the initiation of the antibody-driven classical pathway of complement system cascade [43] was observed in the AC cows. The expression levels of the three complement 1q genes, C1QA, C1QB and C1QC, were moderately upregulated in response to antigen challenge (S1 Table) . The activation of this canonical pathway, which is crucial for antibody mediated antigen clearance via the innate immune system, is also supported by the functional analyses of KEGG pathways (S9 Table) . The C1Q loci play an important role for pattern recognition receptors in recognition of bacteria and viruses representing, a pathway upregulated in this group as well. In contrast, cows of the BC group did not show indication of the complement pathway modulation in response to vaccination.",

The XLOC_32517 locus that displays similarity regarding sequence and structural features to CSF2 (colony, or granulocyte macrophage, -stimulating factor 2) was also significantly upregulated in the BC group (S3 Table) . Due to its cytokine similarity features it can be assumed that the XLOC_32517 locus might be involved in growth and differentiation of hematopoietic precursor cells from various lineages, including granulocytes, macrophages, eosinophils and erythrocytes, stimulation of which is of higher relevance for the response to antigen challenge in early lactating cows. An example for a contrary transcriptional modulation in response to vaccination challenge in AC and BC cows is the locus LOC444875 that is similar to immunoglobulin M (IgM). LOC444875 is moderately downregulated in the AC cows (S1 Table) but upregulated in the BC cow group (S2 Table) . IgM antibodies have been found to play an important role not only in primary defense mechanisms (transient immunity) but also in long-term protection against a variety of pathogens [44] . The contrary transcriptional modulation of the LOC444875 locus in both cow groups, particularly the downregulation in the AC cows, supports the observation of an impaired immune system of cows in the early postpartal period.",

            "text": "A prominent difference in response to antigen challenge between both cow groups is the unique activation of the arginine degradation canonical pathway in the AC group (Table 4) , which is supported by a highly significantly upregulated ARG1 (arginase 1) expression (S1 Table) . In contrast, the expression of ARG1 was not affected in the BC cows. Stimulation of ARG1 activity reduces the availability of arginine as precursor for NO synthesis via inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2). A differential regulation pattern of NOS2 and ARG1 is thought to correspond to either classical (M1) or alternative (M2) macrophage activation, although this mechanism is still under debate and a more complex regulatory network might be responsible for macrophage polarization [45, 46] . As displayed in Fig 4, ARG1 activity is switched on in M2 macrophages via IL10/IL4/IL13 induction. Activated ARG1 function has been reported to compensate unrestrained inflammation by producing cytokines suppressing the NO-mediated inflammation and cytotoxicity immune response. Thus, L-arginine metabolism in macrophages is a key determinant of defense against pathogen infection and has emerged as a defining feature of alternative versus classical macrophage activation [45] [46] [47] . It has been reported that M2 activated macrophages possess various functions including regulation of tissue remodeling processes, angiogenesis and antibody-mediated inflammatory responses [48] [49] [50] . In humans, myeloid cell ARG1-mediated L-arginine depletion was found to profoundly suppress T cell immune responses, and this has emerged as a fundamental mechanism of inflammationassociated immunosuppression [51, 52] . Based on the results from the literature and from our vaccination experiment, the upregulation of ARG1 expression in the blood of AC cows may point to an immunosuppressive mechanism underlying the impaired immune capacity of cows after calving. The ornithine generated by ARG1 action can be further metabolized to proline and polyamines, which are involved in cell growth and differentiation and collagen synthesis [53] . In addition, M2 macrophage activation is known to promote blood vessel formation, tissue repair and remodeling [46, 54] , which is generally necessary in the interval after calving.",

            "text": "Genes with a functional role in blood cell differentiation and development are upregulated in cows vaccinated after calving. A signature specific for the transcriptional response in the blood of AC cows due to vaccination is the upregulation of tetrapyrrole biosynthesis pathway (Table 4) represented by increased expression of erythrocyte-specific ALAS2 (5-aminolevulinate synthase 2, S1 Table) catalysing the rate-limiting step in heme biosynthesis from glycine in erythroid cells [55] . Out of the most significantly affected loci in the AC group after vaccination, the analysis revealed seven loci (S1 Table) , which represent genes that operate synergistically in the major function of erythrocyte cells associated with respiratory gas exchange regulating the uptake of carbon dioxide and release of oxygen by erythrocytes: aquaphorin 1 (AQP1), solute carrier family 4, anion exchanger, member 1 (SLC4A1), carbonic anhydrase II (CA2), glycophorin B (GYPB), hemoglobin chains A and B (HBA, HBB) and \u03bc-globin (HBM). The coordinated upregulation of the respective gene network (Fig 5A) was exclusively observed in the AC cows. The upregulation of the gas exchange is pathway in the AC cows is also supported by the functional enrichment analyses of the respective GO terms and KEGG pathways (S5 and S9 Tables). The synergistic modulation of the transcripts integrated in the gas exchange metabolon in the blood transcriptome of AC cows in response to vaccination is reflected in Fig  5B. The respective loci included in the gas exchange pathway are important for erythrocyte membrane biogenesis and responsible to maintain the erythrocyte shape and integrity [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] and their concerted upregulation also point to activated hematopoiesis and erythropoiesis processes. The primary function of erythrocytes is to transport oxygen in blood, and the primary stimulus for erythrocyte production is low oxygen levels. Enhanced oxygen delivery to oxygenconsuming tissues is required after calving and during early lactation. Thus, the upregulation of genes involved in gas transport enables the AC cows to adjust for the increased demands for oxygen and energy required for regenerative processes to recover from blood loss due to calving, in the energy-consuming tissues at the onset of lactation (e.g., for lactogenesis in the mammary gland) and for the vaccination challenge on the immune system. Possibly, the transcriptional profile modulated in the blood of AC cows in response to vaccination might be compromised by the consequences arising out of blood loss and forcing the activation of red blood cell formation postpartum. However, the coordinated upregulation of the respective genes underlines that this process is of primary relevance and a specific transcriptional signature for the blood of this cow group.",

Strikingly, the canonical pathway of mitochondrial dysfunction was substantially affected after vaccination in the blood of BC cows. Out of the 53 modulated loci, which are involved in this pathway, 34% were downregulated and 4% were upregulated (Table 3, S10  Table) . Downstream analysis showed that the majority of the affected loci are members of complex I of the electron transport chain (ETC), which catalyzes the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone in the inner mitochondrial membrane, but other ETC complexes were also modulated (Fig 6A-6C) . The remarkable transcriptional downregulation of the genes involved in the mitochondrial ETC in response to vaccination was reflected by results of the functional enrichment analyses of KEGG pathways, which indicated that the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) pathway is significantly affected (S8 Table) . Downregulation of a substantial number of genes critical for the mitochondrial function and OXPHOS system points to a repression of ATP production via this pathway in the blood of BC cows. Particularly, the structural integrity of the complex I assembly is known to be essential to maintain its functionality, and an impairment may lead to catalytic problems or instability of the complex assembly [61, 62] .",

Excessive mitochondrial ROS is known to induce damages of cell components and leads to cell clearance through apoptosis, but ROS abundance is also an important intermediate signal for normal cell immune function, like control of T cell activation [64, 65] . In addition to the impaired blood transcript levels of the loci involved in the ETC, an increased expression level was observed for NNT (nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase) in response to vaccination in the BC cows. NNT functions as a redoxdriven proton pump catalyzing the hydride transfer between NADH and NADP(+) for proton translocation across the inner mitochondrial membrane. NNT was reported to play a specific role in the control of ROS production and cellular redox state via NADPH [66] , in regulating the cofactor balance by coordinating reductive carboxylation and glucose catabolism in the mitochondrial TCA cycle [67] and in modulating macrophage inflammatory responses. NNT overexpression was found to result in reduced intracellular ROS and NO levels and impaired intracellular bacteria clearance [68] . Control of intracellular ROS level is critical for cell survival. Modulation of transcripts associated with ROS production was not observed in BC cows, possibly due to complex I deficiency.",

Mitochondria have the capacity to sense energy status of the cell as well as a variety of cellular stresses and respond with initiation of cell death. Reviewing recent studies about mitochondrial function in pathogen recognition, Tal and Iwasaki [69] concluded that the mitochondria are shaping the innate response to pathogens, and they suggest the existence of a \"mitoxosome\", a mitochondrial signalosome or integral platform, where multiple pathways of viral recognition and cellular stress signals converge and are coordinated to generate an antiviral response.",

The impairment of the ETC pathway observed as a specific transcriptional signature in the blood of BC in response to vaccination (see previous section) implies that the subsequently reduced ATP generation via TCA cycle might be simultaneously linked with a reprogramming of energy metabolism to rebalance ATP production. The PDK4 (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, isozyme 4) transcript abundance increased in parallel in the blood of BC cows in response to vaccination (S2 Table) , which fits in the hypothesis of reprogrammed ATP production. PDK4 is known to play a crucial role in glucose utilization and lipid metabolism by regulating the mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex that converts pyruvate to acetyl CoA for oxidation and ATP generation in the TCA cycle. Elevated PDK4 expression leads to a suppression of the influx of glycolytic metabolites into mitochondria [70] , which in turn, would support the reduction of ATP production via TCA cycle. In cancer cells, a low level of glucose oxidation via TCA cycle has been shown to be due to the constant inhibition of PDH by phosphorylation of one of its four kinases [71] [72] [73] . Recently, PDK4 was identified as a novel regulator of one of the signaling pathways of mTORC1 via HIFA1 effects and of aerobic glycolysis [74] as well as a novel potential hub that may play a central role in the complex interplay of transcription-factors, transcripts and lipids during the course of monocyte-macrophage differentiation [75] .",

This metabolic switch, a phenomenon known as the Warburg effect [80] , is accepted as a metabolic signature of highly proliferating cells, not only cancer cells but also activated lymphocytes [79, 81, 82] , TLR-activated and NO-producing inflammatory dendritic cells [83] [84] [85] as a survival response that serves to rebalance ATP levels and to rapidly provide glycolytic intermediates for biosynthetic growth and proliferation processes.

            "text": "In our study, rebalancing of ATP generation via glycolysis is supported by expression upregulation of HK1 (hexokinase 1) and transcription factor HIF1A (hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha) in BC cows. HK1 phosphorylates glucose to produce glucose-6-phosphate, the first step in glycolysis, and HIF1A is a transcriptional factor known to control metabolism, survival and innate immunity in response to inflammation and oxygen deficiency [87] as well as to regulate glycolysis stimulation [88] and cellular reprogramming [89] . The vaccination-induced mitochondrial deficiency and the upregulation of PDK4 and HIF1A may synergize to activate glycolysis to generate maximal quantities of ATP and metabolites required for blood/immune cell proliferation in response to antigen challenge (Fig 7) . These regulatory metabolic mechanisms were not modulated in AC cows in response to vaccination. In early lactating AC cows, glucose is primarily needed for lactogenesis, thus availability of glucose for activation of lymphocytes is limited. This may lead to an inhibition of cell proliferation and cytokine production contributing to immunosuppression of these cows.",

            "text": "In summary, the results of our study indicate a differential modulation of transcripts, biological processes and pathways in the two cow groups vaccinated prior to or after calving and show that the different physiological and metabolic status of the cows (non-lactating vs. early lactating) is clearly reflected at the whole transcriptome level in the blood of the divergent cow groups. The response to vaccination elicits a quantitatively and qualitatively divergent regulatory immune defense reaction in the blood transcriptome of each cow group. Remarkably, the non-lactating cows vaccinated prior to calving displayed a substantially higher number of differentially expressed loci compared to the early lactating cows vaccinated after calving. The lower magnitude of the overall transcriptional modulation in the early lactating cows suggests a generally attenuated reactivity in response to antigen challenge. The immune response of non-lactating cows involved an activation of a complex and divergent spectrum of signaling and metabolic pathways for protection against antigen challenge compared to the early lactating cows. Their immune response seemed to be compromised by temporary pivotal physiological challenges associated with the consequences due to calving and the onset of lactation. Thus, the unique vaccination-induced transcriptome signature in the blood of the early lactating cows is characterized by an impaired transcriptional regulation of specific loci associated with the immune defense response in non-lactating cows, which provides evidence for the suppressed capacity for immunomodulation on the molecular level in early lactating cows. The results of our study can contribute to build a model of key signaling pathways that are modulated divergently in response to vaccination and to identify potential specific biomarkers characteristic for divergent immune responses.",
