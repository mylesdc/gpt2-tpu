            "text": "Porphyromonas gulae is a major periodontal pathogen in dogs, which can be transmitted to their owners. A major virulence factor of P. gulae consists of a 41-kDa filamentous appendage (FimA) on the cell surface, which is classified into three genotypes: A, B, and C. Thus far, inhibition of periodontal disease in dogs remains difficult. The present study assessed the inhibitory effects of a combination of clindamycin and interferon alpha (IFN-\u03b1) formulation against P. gulae and periodontal disease. Growth of P. gulae was significantly inhibited by clindamycin; this inhibition had a greater effect on type C P. gulae than on type A and B isolates. In contrast, the IFN-\u03b1 formulation inhibited the expression of IL-1\u03b2 and COX-2 elicited by type A and B isolates, but not that elicited by type C isolates. Furthermore, periodontal recovery was promoted by the administration of both clindamycin and ifn-\u03b1 formulation to dogs undergoing periodontal treatment; moreover, this combined treatment reduced the number of fimA genotypes in oral specimens from treated dogs. these results suggest that a combination of clindamycin and ifn-\u03b1 formulation inhibit P. gulae virulence and thus may be effective for the prevention of periodontal disease induced by P. gulae.",

P. gingivalis, a species closely related to P. gulae, induces inflammatory disorders which cause aggravation of periodontal disease 20 . Gingival epithelial cells play an important role in preventing bacterial invasion deeper into tissue 21 ; however, changes in the host inflammatory response produced by gingival epithelial cells exposed to P. gulae remain unknown. The relative ratios of mRNA expression levels of IL-1\u03b2, COX-2, IL-8, and TGF-\u03b21 in Ca9-22 human gingival epithelial cells infected with P. gulae strains were analysed with their respective levels at 0 h after P. gulae infection defined as 1.0. IL-1\u03b2, COX-2, and IL-8 levels in the presence of each P. gulae strain were highest at 2 h after infection; these levels were significantly higher than those in uninfected cells (P < 0.001) ( Supplementary  Fig. 1a ). In addition, at 2 h after infection, IL-1\u03b2 expression induced by P. gulae D049 (type C) infection was significantly higher than that induced by P. gulae ATCC 51700 (type A) or P. gulae D040 (type B) (P < 0.05); a similar trend was observed with respect to COX-2. IL-8 expression tended to be higher in the presence of strain D049 (type C) than in the presence of strains ATCC 51700 (type A) or D040 (type B); however, there were no significant differences among the strains. There was no change in the expression level of TGF-\u03b21 at any time after P. gulae infection. Subsequently, we measured the protein levels of IL-1\u03b2, COX-2, IL-8, and TGF-\u03b21 in P. gulae-infected Ca9-22 cells (Fig. 2a) .

Therefore, each P. gulae strain and an IFN-\u03b1 formulation were simultaneously added to respective cultures of Ca9-22 cells, and the expression levels of IL-1\u03b2, COX-2, and IL-8 were analysed 2 h after incubation. Before the experiment, the IFN-\u03b1 formulation, clindamycin, and combined treatment with the IFN-\u03b1 formulation and clindamycin were confirmed to have no effect on the growth of uninfected Ca9-22 cells ( Supplementary Fig. 2a,b) . Treatment with the IFN-\u03b1 formulation significantly reduced the mRNA expression levels and protein production levels of IL-1\u03b2 and COX-2 in Ca9-22 cells that were infected with P. gulae ATCC 51700 (type A) and P. gulae D040 (type B), respectively (P < 0.05); no changes in IL-8 expression were observed (Supplementary Fig. 1b and Fig. 2b ). In addition, such changes in expression levels were not observed in Ca9-22 cells that were infected with P. gulae D049 (type C). changes in periodontal conditions before and after clinical treatment. The schedule of treatment is summarized in Fig. 3 . Fifty-two dogs were divided into four groups with or without pharmaceutical treatments, as follows: no pharmaceutical treatment (control group; n = 12), clindamycin treatment (clindamycin group; n = 10), IFN-\u03b1 formulation treatment (IFN-\u03b1 group; n = 14), and clindamycin and IFN-\u03b1 formulation combined treatment (combination group; n = 16) ( Table 1 ). In the clindamycin group, clindamycin was ingested for a total of 7 days (4 days before and 3 days after scaling). In the IFN-\u03b1 group, an IFN-\u03b1 formulation (InterBerry\u03b1 \u00ae ; Hokusan Co. Ltd.) was applied to the gingival margin of all teeth, 10 times total over 35 days. Gingival and periodontal scores of dogs were assessed at the beginning and end of clinical treatment, in accordance with previously described methods 23 . Periodontal scores in all groups after the treatment were significantly lower than those before treatment (P < 0.05) (Fig. 4a ). In addition, the relative ratios were calculated for periodontal scores after periodontal treatment compared with those before periodontal treatment; the combination group had the lowest relative ratio, although there were no significant differences among groups (Fig. 4b ). As shown in Fig. 4c , accumulations of dental plaque and dental calculus around teeth were reduced and gingival conditions were improved after periodontal treatment in the combined group. P. gulae detection before and after clinical treatment. Oral swab specimens were collected from the gingival margin of the maxillary right or left canine and fourth maxillary premolar at the beginning and end of clinical treatment, as described previously 24 . Distributions of P. gulae and fimA genotype classification in the oral specimens were determined using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods, as previously described 8, 25 . With the exception of two dogs in the control group, all dogs were positive for P. gulae before periodontal treatment; all P. gulae-positive dogs in the control group were positive for P. gulae after treatment (Table 1 , Fig. 5a ). Two of 10 dogs (20%) in the clindamycin group and four of 14 dogs (28.6%) in the IFN-\u03b1 group were negative for P. gulae after treatment. The combination group had the lowest rate of P. gulae detection after treatment: P. gulae was absent from the oral cavity in six of 16 dogs (37.5%). Next, we determined the relative ratio of the detection of each fimA type after treatment, compared with that before treatment. In the control group, only the relative ratio of fimA type B was reduced after treatment (Fig. 5b ). In contrast, the relative ratios of fimA types A and C were reduced after treatment in the clindamycin group; the relative ratios of all fimA genotypes were reduced after treatment in the IFN-\u03b1 and combination groups. Notably, the relative ratios of fimA type C were dramatically reduced after treatment, which were present in 37.5% and 20% of dogs in the clindamycin and combination groups, respectively. When the detection rates of fimA genotypes in each group were compared with those in the control group, detection rates of all fimA genotypes in each group (with the exception of fimA type B in the clindamycin group) were lower than those in the control group.",

Bacterial plaque remains at the gingival sulcus between the teeth and gingiva, resulting in gingivitis where the margin of the gingiva becomes red and swollen 5 . The presence of chronic gingivitis results in the formation of irreversible deep periodontal pockets at the gingival sulcus 5 . Consequently, alveolar bone resorption and tooth mobility occur, followed by loss of teeth in some instances 26 . Periodontal disease is present in more than 80% of mature dogs and is one of the most prevalent diseases in dogs 26 . P. gulae is a major periodontopathic bacteria that has been strongly associated with the deterioration of periodontal disease in dogs 7 . However, there have been no studies of the potential for preventing periodontal disease in dogs by reducing the pathogenicity of P. gulae. In the present study, we examined the inhibition of P. gulae and periodontal disease by using treatment with clindamycin and IFN-\u03b1 formulation. www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Antibacterial agents are often prescribed for a period of 1 week in combination with periodontal treatment; this approach is useful for reduction of periodontal bacteria 17 . Among antibiotics prescribed during scaling and root planing treatment of dogs, the lincomycin-derived antibacterial agent clindamycin is widely used for www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ prevention of infection 27 . In the present study, 0.005-0.4 \u03bcg/ml clindamycin was used to assess the inhibitory effect of antibiotic treatment on growth of P. gulae. These low concentrations of clindamycin could inhibit the growth of all fimA types of P. gulae, among which the inhibitory effect most prominently affected the type C P. gulae strain. In the clinical portion of this study, type C P. gulae was also reduced in dogs that received clindamycin treatment. In our previous study, type C P. gulae was frequently detected in dogs with periodontitis, at rates significantly higher than those in healthy dogs 8 ; therefore, clindamycin may be especially effective for dogs with severe periodontitis.",

Stimulation of immortalised human gingival epithelial cells with vesicles from P. gingivalis bacteria led to upregulation of COX-2 and IL-8 mRNA 36 . Additionally, stimulation with P. gulae has been shown to induce increased secretion of IL-1\u03b2 39 . In the present study, we found that secretion and expression levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-8, and tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 were increased upon infection with P. gulae. These findings suggest that P. gulae infection induces mRNA expression of a wide variety of inflammatory-related proteins in Ca9-22 cells. TGF-\u03b21 mRNA and protein expression were reportedly upregulated by infection with bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Helicobacter pylori, and group A Streptococcus 38, 40, 41 . In contrast, infection of human gingival fibroblast cells with P. gingivalis resulted in an increase in mRNA expression levels of TGF-\u03b21, but did not influence the corresponding protein expression levels 42 . Following P. gulae infection in the present study, TGF-\u03b21 mRNA expression levels were increased, while corresponding protein expression levels were not affected; this suggested that the effects of P. gulae on TGF-\u03b21 expression were similar to those of P. gingivalis. Moreover, these findings indicate that the protein expression levels of TGF-\u03b21 may not always reflect its mRNA expression levels.",

Therefore, we examined whether a canine IFN-\u03b1 formulation could suppress inflammatory responses in gingival epithelial cells that had been infected with P. gulae. We found that the IFN-\u03b1 formulation could reduce the expression of IL-1\u03b2 and COX-2, which were upregulated by infection with fimA types A and B P. gulae strains. Furthermore, we found that clindamycin was more effective than the IFN-\u03b1 formulation against the fimA type C P. gulae strain; thus, combined use of an IFN-\u03b1 formulation and clindamycin may be effective for P. gulae strains, regardless of fimA genotype. In future studies, we plan to analyse effects of the combined use of an IFN-\u03b1 formulation and clindamycin on the expression of other cytokines and enzymes, as well as on the survival of various periodontopathogenic bacteria.",

Clindamycin and IFN-\u03b1 formulation, separately or in combination, were added to the trypticase soy broth supplemented with yeast extract, haemin, and menadione used for bacterial suspension growth. In addition, overnight cultured P. gulae bacteria were added to the media at a density of 4 \u00d7 10 8 CFU/ml and then cultured at 37 \u00b0C for 24 h. Bacterial growth after incubation was measured by determining the optical density at 600 nm using a microplate reader (SH-1000 Lab, Corona Electric, Katsuta, Japan), because the number of P. gulae bacteria in a given suspension has been previously estimated by measurement of the optical density at 600 nm and subsequent extrapolation from a standard curve 53 . The relative ratio of growth of each P. gulae strain was calculated by comparison with the optical density at 600 nm value of each bacterial broth without clindamycin. All assays were performed in triplicate on three separate occasions (n = 9).",

Additionally, the number of viable cells in each monolayer was determined using trypan blue dye exclusion and cell counting method. IFN-\u03b1 (100 \u03bcg/ml) was preincubated with Ca9-22 cells prior to addition of bacteria. Overnight cultured P. gulae were harvested and washed with sterile phosphate-buffered saline. The bacteria were then diluted to 1 \u00d7 10 8 CFU/ml in DMEM and used to infect Ca9-22 cells. For experiments involving bacterial infection of Ca-22 cells, we used the concept of multiplicity of infection (MOI), which is commonly defined as the ratio of infectious microorganisms to cells in a culture 54 . Ca9-22 cells were diluted to a density of 1 \u00d7 10 6 and infected with 1 \u00d7 10 8 CFU of respective P. gulae strains at MOI of 100 for 0-12 h. Then, total RNA was extracted from these P. gulae-infected Ca9-22 cells and cDNA was synthesized as described previously 55 . Briefly, total RNA from Ca9-22 cells was isolated using TRIsure (BIOLINE, Luckenwalde, Germany) and converted into cDNA using an iScript \u2122 cDNA Synthesis kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. cDNAs were amplified using a QuantiFast SYBR Green PCR master mix (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA), in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. The primers specific for genes encoding IL-1\u03b2, COX-2, IL-8, and TGF-\u03b21, which were used in this study, are listed in Table 2 . GAPDH was used as a housekeeping control and negative reverse transcription reactions were included in each assay. Expression values for mRNA were quantified by the \u0394\u0394Ct method, using GAPDH as the control. All assays were performed in triplicate on three separate occasions (n = 9).",

Ca9-22 cells were stimulated with P. gulae strains in the presence or absence of IFN-\u03b1 for 24 h. For the quantification of IL-1\u03b2, COX-2, IL-8, and TGF-\u03b21 in cell lysate at each time point, sandwich ELISAs were performed using the Human IL-1\u03b2 ELISA kit (Proteintech Group Inc., Rosemont, IL, USA), Human/mouse total COX-2 DuoSet IC ELISA (R&D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA), IL-8 ELISA kit (Proteintech Group Inc.) and TGF-\u03b21 ELISA kit (Proteintech Group Inc.), respectively, in accordance with the manufacturers' instructions. Absorbance was Schedule in clinical experiment. The clinical experiment was conducted in full adherence to the Declaration of Helsinki. All study protocols were approved by the Animal Research Committee of Azabu University. Prior to the clinical experiment, all owners were informed of the content of the study and gave written informed consent for approval of their pets' participation. The schedule for clinical treatment is summarized in Fig. 3 . In total, 52 dogs (28 males, 24 females; median age: 10 years [range: 1-15 years]) were enrolled (Table 1) ; all dogs received periodontal treatment under general anaesthesia. The subjects were divided into four groups with or without pharmaceutical treatments, as follows: no pharmaceutical treatment (control group; n = 12), clindamycin treatment (clindamycin group; n = 10), IFN-\u03b1 formulation treatment (IFN-\u03b1 group; n = 14), and combined clindamycin and IFN-\u03b1 formulation treatment (combination group; n = 16). In the clindamycin group, clindamycin 5 mg/kg was administered via the oral cavity twice per day, beginning 4 days before treatment and ending 3 days after periodontal treatment (a total of 7 days), in accordance with the guidelines of the American Animal Hospital Association 57 . In the IFN-\u03b1 group, 2.75 g of IFN-\u03b1 formulation (InterBerry\u03b1 \u00ae ) was applied to the gingival margin of all teeth, 10 times total over 35 days after periodontal treatment. The combination group received both clindamycin and IFN-\u03b1 formulation treatments, in accordance with the methods described above. Oral swab specimens were collected from the gingival margin of the maxillary right or left canine and fourth premolar using a micro brush (Microapplicator fine, FEED Corporation, Yokohama, Japan), as described previously 24 , several days before and 5 weeks after periodontal treatment. evaluation of periodontal conditions before and after clinical treatment. Periodontal scores were determined by assessment of the gingival margin of the maxillary right or left canine and fourth maxillary premolar, several days before and 5 weeks after periodontal treatment, using a modified version of a previously described method 13 . For each dog, gingival scores of the maxillary right or left canine and fourth premolar were evaluated visually as follows: (1) no significant findings; (2) mild periodontal disease-gingival swelling, gingival regression, and halitosis; (3) moderate periodontal disease-exposure of root, spontaneous bleeding, and tooth loss; and (4) severe periodontal disease-furcation involvement and fistula formation.
