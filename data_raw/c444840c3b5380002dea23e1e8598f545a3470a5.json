In this study we sequenced the genome of a newly identified coronavirus dominant in ducks (DdCoV), and performed a large-scale surveillance of coronaviruses in chickens and ducks using a conserved RT-PCR assay. The viral genome harbors a tandem repeat which is rare in vertebrate RNA viruses. The repeat is homologous to some proteins of various cellular organisms, but its origin remains unknown. Many substitutions, insertions, deletions, and some frameshifts and recombination events have occurred in the genome of the DdCoV, as compared with the coronavirus dominant in chickens (CdCoV). The distances between DdCoV and CdCoV are large enough to separate them into different species within the genus Gammacoronavirus. Our surveillance demonstrated that DdCoVs and CdCoVs belong to different lineages and occupy different ecological niches, further supporting that they should be classified into different species. Our surveillance also demonstrated that DdCoVs and CdCoVs are prevalent in live poultry markets in some regions of China. In conclusion, this study shed novel insight into the genetic diversity, evolution, distribution, and taxonomy of the coronaviruses circulating in chickens and ducks.",

Therefore, it is surprising to identify a tandem repeat in the genomes of DdCoVs in this study. To our knowledge, of all known vertebrate RNA viruses, tandem repeats have been identified only in the genomes of some human HKU1 CoVs which contain 2 to 17 copies of a 10-aa peptide (NDDEDVVTGD) with unknown origin and functions [7] . The tandem repeats in both DdCoVs and HKU1 CoVs are located at highly variable regions in the PL1 pro domain of nsp3. Because nsp3 is not essential for the virus replicating in cultured cells [8] , and tandem repeats do not exist in many other CoVs, these tandem repeats may be of little importance for the virus replicating in cultured cells. On the other hand, as tandem repeats have not been identified in any known vertebrate RNA viruses except in two species of CoVs, CoVs might have an intrinsic inclination to generate tandem repeats. CoVs mutate fast due to their frequent genomic recombination and the limited proofreading capacity of their RNA replicases [8, 29] . We demonstrated here that, as compared with CdCoV, DdCoV has accumulated many substitutions and indels in its genome, and recombination events have occurred between CdCoV and DdCoV. Moreover, quite a few indels resulted in frameshifts in the viral genomes, which are rare in other viruses as frameshifts usually change greatly the aa sequence of a gene.",

Consequently, the prevalence of DdCoVs in duck swab samples detected with inoculation in chicken embyonated eggs could be greatly underestimated in this study.",
