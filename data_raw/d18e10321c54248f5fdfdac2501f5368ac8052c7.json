In 2007, SAFV was isolated from a stool sample obtained from an infant who suffered a fever of unknown origin in 1981 [1] . Prior to this, cardioviruses were thought to cause serious diseases, such as myocarditis, encephalomyelitis, and diabetes, mainly in small rodents [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . The zoonotic Encephalomyocarditis virus (which belongs to the genus Cardiovirus) is infectious in primates, including humans, but causes only occasional and mild outbreaks [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . After its initial identification, SAFV was primarily detected in fecal and throat swab specimens from infants and children with acute gastroenteritis or acute upper respiratory symptoms [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . Epidemiological and genetic analyses suggest that SAFV, especially genotypes 2 and 3, is circulating freely in the human population and is transmitted from human to human during early childhood because the sera of children and the elderly have high rates of neutralizing antibodies against SAFV genotypes 2 and 3 [18, 19, 22, 24, 26, 27] . The prevalence of SAFV in other mammals, including rodents, is still uncertain.",

On the other hand, SAFV mono-infection was found in children with diarrhea, hand-foot-mouth disease, and upper respiratory inflammation [25, [30] [31] [32] . In addition, a surveillance program for acute flaccid paralysis (for global polio eradication) conducted by the World Health Organization occasionally detected SAFV in fecal specimens from patients with non-polio acute flaccid paralysis [15, 27, 33, 34] . Although SAFV is also found in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of infants with cerebellitis [35] and aseptic meningitis [36] , it is rarely observed in CSF samples from those with neurological diseases [13, 30, 35] ; thus the role of SAFV in neurological diseases remains uncertain.",

Thus, neonatal mice have been used for viral isolation and to investigate the pathogenesis of enteroviruses. However, picornaviruses generally show high host specificity; the natural host for all human enteroviruses is the human [37] . Enterovirus 71, a member of the family Picornaviridae, can cause meningitis and encephalitis because it infects human neurons. Some human isolates induce paralysis in neonatal mice after experimental infection of the brain. However, the mice often show severe myositis due to viral infection of not only neurons but also skeletal muscle; this does not happen in humans [38] . By contrast, coxsackievirus B and mouse-adapted enterovirus 71 infect large neurons in the brains of neonatal or adult mice and these animal models mimic the neuropathology observed in the human brain [39] [40] [41] [42] .",

Indeed, a recent report [43] shows that mice subjected to intracerebral inoculation with HeLa cell-adapted SAFV type 2, which had been passaged eight times in rhesus monkey kidney epithelial (LLC-MK 2 ) cells and then 13 times in the alpha/beta interferon-deficient human glial cell line, U118MG, developed neurological disorders. In the present study, the primary aim was to examine the susceptibility of mouse brain to SAFV-3 in the absence of viral host adaptation. We used two clinical isolates of SAFV-3: the JPN 08-404 strain (isolated from the CSF of a patient with aseptic meningitis) [36] , and the Gunma/176/ 2008 strain (isolated from a throat swab from a patient with acute upper respiratory inflammation) [21] . Neonatal and young ddY mice, and young BALB/c mice were infected and analyzed using virological, pathological, and immunological methods. The results showed that both clinical isolates of SAFV-3 infected neural progenitor cells and glial cells, but not large neurons, and that both were mildly neurovirulent in mice; however, the clinical isolates showed different cell tropism and neurovirulence. Taken together, these results suggest that SAFV-3 is a candidate neuropathogenic virus that causes aseptic meningitis and other neurological disorders.",

The clinical samples were obtained by the local health authorities of Kochi Prefecture (AM strain) or Gunma Prefecture (UR strain) in 2008 for the surveillance of viral diseases in Japan, but we used clinical isolates that were supplied from these local health authorities. Thus, this study did not involve research on human subjects and thus does not need the approval of the Ethical Review Board. After isolation in non-human primate LLC-MK 2 cells (AM strain) or in human HEp-2 cells (UR strain), the stock viruses were passaged (three times for the AM strain and once for the UR strain) in LLC-MK 2 cells cultured in minimal essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 \u03bcg/ml of streptomycin, and 1.5 \u03bcg/ml of Fungizone Antimycotic (Gibco, Life Technologies Corporation, Carlsbad, CA) (referred to herein as 2MEM). The virus-infected LLC-MK 2 cells were disrupted using three freeze-thaw cycles and centrifuged at 2,000 \u00d7 g for 15 min. The supernatant was stored at 80\u00b0C until required. Titers of the stock viruses were expressed as 50% of the cell culture infectious dose (CCID 50 )/ml in LLC-MK 2 cells, which was calculated using the Behrens-K\u00e4rber method. All work with infectious SAFV-3 was performed under biosafety level two conditions. SAFV-3 UR strain genome sequencing SAFV-3 UR strain RNA was extracted from virus-infected cell cultures using an RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR was performed with the OneStep RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen) using specific primers [27, 44] . The amplified DNA PCR products were purified using MonoFas DNA Purification Kit I (GL Sciences Inc., Tokyo, Japan) and then sequenced using an ABI 3130 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies Corporation). The nucleotide sequences of the SAFV-3 UR strain were analyzed using Sequencher software (ver. 4.10.1, Gene Codes Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI). All nucleotide sequences analyzed in this study were submitted to the DNA Data Bank of Japan.",

Before oral inoculation, animals were deprived of water for 6 or more hours. Feces were obtained from orally-inoculated animals on Days 3 and 8 p.i. and used for viral isolation. All inoculated mice were observed for clinical signs of infection and body weight was measured daily for 21 days (n = 3, 4, or 5 mice per group). The mice were sacrificed under excess isoflurane anesthesia on Days 3, 8, and 21 p.i. and examined using virological and pathological methods.",

On Day 3 p.i., the AM-inoculated mice showed mild or no histopathological changes in the brain or other major organs, although viral antigens were detected in the brain, spinal cord, and skeletal muscle ( Table 2 and Fig 2A) . UR-inoculated mice showed significant histopathological changes in the brain and tooth germ, including cellular degeneration with condensed nuclei and necrosis with slight cellular infiltration ( Table 2 and Fig 2A) . SAFV antigens were detected in degenerated neural cells (which showed eccentric nuclei) around the lateral ventricle, which was the virus inoculation site, and in the undeveloped medulla of the cerebellum (Fig 2A, insets) . In addition, a few neural cells within the spinal cord, and skeletal muscle cells throughout the body, were positive for viral antigens (Table 2 ). However, none of the large pyramidal neurons in the brain and spinal cord were positive for viral antigens. Moreover, viral antigens were detected in the oral cavity of UR-inoculated mice, but the histopathological changes were very weak. The number of viral antigen-positive cells in the cerebellum lobule of AM-inoculated mice was approximately five times greater than that in UR-inoculated mice on Day 3 p.i., and 16 times greater on Day 7 p.i. (Fig 2B) . RNA in situ hybridization using paraffin-embedded brain tissues harvested from neonatal mice at 3 days p.i. revealed that viral RNA was present in the ventricle, cerebrum, and brain stem of mice inoculated with either virus strain ( Fig 2C) . Notably, the cerebellum in AM-inoculated mice, but not in UR-inoculated mice, was positive for viral RNA. The distribution of viral antigens correlated with that of viral RNA in the brain. On Day 3 p.i., mild perivascular cuffing was more common in the cerebrum/brain stem of UR-inoculated mice than in that of AM-inoculated mice; however, no perivascular cuffing was observed in the cerebellum of either group (S1 Fig, upper panels) . Appreciable perivascular cuffing and vacuolation in the neuropil were detected in the brains stem of UR-inoculated mice on Day 21 p.i.

In addition, mild meningitis and perivascular cuffing was observed in the spinal cords of UR-inoculated mice but not in AM-inoculated mice (Fig 3A) . Foci of demyelination with Iba1 + microglia infiltrations were observed in the white matter of the spinal cords of UR-inoculated mice but not of AM-inoculated mice (Fig 3B) .

Because the oral cavity of neonatal mice was positive for viral antigens after intracerebral inoculation with the UR strain (Fig 2A) , we speculated that SAFV-3 might infect young mice through the mucosa. To explore this hypothesis, we infected young BALB/c mice with the AM and UR strains of SAFV-3 (10 4 CCID 50 per mouse) via various routes (intraperitoneal, intravenous, oral, and intranasal). None of the animals showed clinical neurological signs. In addition, no histopathological changes were observed in the CNS (including the olfactory bulb) or other organs on Days 3, 8, and 21 p.i. However, on Day 3 post-intraperitoneal inoculation, immunohistochemical analysis revealed viral antigen-positive cells in the pancreas of all three AM-inoculated mice and one of the three UR-inoculated mice (S8 Fig). Similarly, on Day 3 post-intravenous inoculation of UR, viral antigens were detected in the pancreas in one of three mice. However, no histopathological changes or viral antigens were observed in the major organs after oral or intranasal inoculation with either virus strain. Interestingly, very mild and focal inflammatory infiltrations (in the absence of viral antigen) were seen in the nasal mucosa of mice inoculated with UR via the oral and intranasal routes. No virus was detected in the feces on Days 3 and 8 after oral infection. We then measured the levels of anti-SAFV-neutralizing antibodies in the sera of mice on Day 21 p.i., to examine seroconversion against each inoculated strain. All of the young BALB/c mice seroconverted after intracerebral, intraperitoneal, or intravenous inoculation with SAFV-3 (Fig 10) . Notably, oral and intranasal inoculation with the UR strain induced seroconversion in young BALB/c mice. By contrast, mice orally administered the AM strain did not seroconvert. After intranasal administration, two out of four animals showed low levels of neutralizing antibodies against the inoculated virus. These results suggested that the UR strain, but not the AM strain, infected young BALB/ c mice through \"natural\" routes, including the oral and nasal mucosa.",

Neonatal ddY mice intracerebrally inoculated with the UR strain showed poor (but not fatal) weight gain, and neonatal ddY mice intracerebrally inoculated with the AM strain showed mild clinical signs, such as tremors; however, these signs were minor and transient. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that both SAFV-3 isolates infected glial cells, but not large pyramidal neurons, in neonatal mice. However, histopathological investigation revealed that both strains induced an aseptic meningitis (lasting at least 3 weeks) in the brains of neonatal Number of viral IFN-\u03b14 and IFN-\u03b2 RNA copies relative to that of mouse beta-actin copies (***P < 0.001; one-way ANOVA).

There were some differences between the two SAFV-3 strains in terms of infectivity and cell tropism in the murine neonatal model. For instance, the ependymal cells and mucosal epithelia of the oral cavity and the tooth germ in neonatal mice were infected following intracerebral infection with the UR, but not the AM, strain. In addition, the UR strain infected the mucosa in young mice following intranasal or oral inoculation; thus this animal model recapitulates the potential infectivity of the UR strain observed in human upper respiratory tract infections. Therefore, both the neonatal and young mouse models will be useful for future studies aimed at elucidating the pathogenesis of different SAFV-3 strains. The present study highlights the similarities and differences between SAFV-3 and other cardioviruses. Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) is a common enteric pathogen in mice and causes poliomyelitis-like flaccid paralysis and a chronic progressive white matterdemyelinating disease, which is considered a relevant viral infection model of human multiple sclerosis [51] [52] [53] . Neurovirulent strains of TMEV mainly infect the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and spinal cord after experimental inoculation [54] [55] [56] . Virus-mediated neurological disorders are caused by direct lytic infection of neurons and oligodendroglia and by secondary immune-mediated destruction of infected cells [57] . We found that the UR-inoculated neonatal mice intracerebrally showed foci of demyelination with microglia infiltrations in the spinal cord on day 21 p.i. This seems to be an early phase of demyelination after viral infection, which is likely to be due to TMEV infection. However, SAFV-3 infected adult mice did not show any lesion associated with demyelinating disease. Interestingly, the SAFV-3 strains examined herein were neurotropic for glial cells in the cerebellum but not for oligodendroglia; however, no study has reported a similar tropism for TMEV [54] . Additionally, there is no evidence for an association between SAFV and human multiple sclerosis [13, 58] . The pathological process of demyelination may be different between SAFV and TMEV. In the present study, SAFV-3 infected the pancreas of young mice after intraperitoneal inoculation. Another cardiovirus, Encephalomyocarditis virus, also infects the pancreas of mice and causes type 1 diabetes [3, 5] ; thus, SAFV-3 may have the potential to induce diabetes in mice. Similar to other murine enteric cardioviruses, the UR strain infected young mice via the mucosal route. Therefore, this mucosal infection model may mimic SAFV infection in humans and prove useful for furthering our understanding of the pathogenesis of SAFV. However, the routes of viral infection following oral and intranasal inoculation remain unclear.",

Although the AM and UR strains differed by only a single amino acid in the VP2 protein; there were seven amino acid differences in the non-structural proteins (L, 2A, 2C, 3B, 3C, and 3D). The capsid protein of cardioviruses contains four loop structures, loops I and II in VP1, and puffs A and B in VP2, all of which are involved in receptor binding [13, 59, 60] . The leader protein of TMEV plays an important role in viral replication by inhibiting alpha/beta interferon production [61, 62] and inducing apoptosis [63, 64] . It also plays a role in neurovirulence [65] . In the present study, the AM and UR strains differed in terms of virus replication and induction of type 1 IFN expression in infected mice. The dissimilarity in the amino acid sequences of the two SAFV-3 isolates may have contributed to the observed differences in tissue tropism, viral replication, and type 1 IFN expression in the two mouse models. Notably, the expression of type 1 IFN in the cerebellum of AM-inoculated young mice was significantly greater than that in UR-inoculated mice. This discrepancy could be related to differences in cell tropism in these mice.",

The present in vivo comparative study using virological, pathological, and immunological methods to examine the effects of clinical viral isolates has further elucidated the pathogenesis of SAFV. However, future studies on the neuropathogenesis of SAFV will be required for complete understanding of this virus.",

Within 24 h of birth, neonatal ddY mice were inoculated intracerebrally with 10 4 CCID 50 (cell culture infectious dose) of the aseptic meningitis (AM) or upper respiratory (UR) strains of SAFV-3. Representative histopathological images of inflammatory infiltration in the brains of neonatal mice on Days 3 and 21 post-inoculation (p.i.) are shown (n = 3, 4, or 7 mice per group). Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. Bars, 50 \u03bcm. On Day 3 p.i., swollen vascular endothelial cells (red arrow, inset) and a mild inflammatory infiltrate with microglia (blue arrow, inset) were seen in the cerebrum/brain stem of UR-inoculated mice (black arrows, panels in second row), but not in that of AM-inoculated mice (panels in first row). On Day 21 p.i., perivascular cuffing with mononuclear cell infiltration was observed in the brain stem/cerebellum of UR-inoculated mice (arrows and insets of fourth row) but not in those of AM-inoculated mice (panels in third row).
