            "text": "Live animal markets (LAMs) represent a traditional place for congregation and commerce, particularly in developing countries. Owing to their role as a source of affordable, live or freshly slaughtered animals, LAMs act as a source for transmission of pathogens, especially viruses. [1] [2] [3] Spread of a virus within the market is often enhanced due to high density, close contact animal housing, increasing the risk of zoonotic and anthroponotic transmission. 4 Animals remain in the LAM for extended periods of time until sold and can consequently transform these markets into viral reservoirs. As new animals are introduced to the LAM, Infected animals easily transmit viruses to these na\u00efve hosts, thus perpetuating and amplifying viral circulation. 5 In addition, LAMs are often part of a larger marketplace ecosystem, potentially exposing people to zoonotic pathogens with little to no direct contact with infected animals. 1 This is especially true with avian influenza viruses (AIV).",

            "text": "LAMs in many parts of the world harbor highly pathogenic as well as low pathogenic AIV, which can spread asymptomatically through poultry and are difficult to detect without routine surveillance. [6] [7] [8] [9] Although AIV has been detected in North American and Caribbean LAMs, there is no information about South America LAMs, 10, 11 likely due to minimal surveillance. 12 During active surveillance at the largest LAM in Medellin, Colombia, we isolated two H11N2 viruses from asymptomatic birds. At the peak of the occurrence, 17.0% of the birds in the market tested positive. Genetically, the circulating virus was most similar to viruses isolated from North American migratory birds and to viruses isolated in 2013 from Chilean shorebirds. H11 viruses are distributed worldwide 10, [13] [14] [15] primarily in wild ducks and shorebirds 16, 17 but rarely are found in domestic poultry. 9, 10, [18] [19] [20] Given this unique occurrence and the fact that H11 have been reported to cause human infections 21, 22 we characterized the viruses in vitro and in vivo. The Colombian H11 viruses displayed no molecular markers associated with increased virulence in birds or mammals and had an \u03b12,3-sialic acid binding preference. They replicated and transmitted effectively in chickens, explaining the spread throughout the market, but caused little morbidity in Balb/c mice. The genetic similarity to H11 viruses isolated from South American shorebirds suggests that the LAM occurrence may have resulted from a wild bird to domestic poultry spillover. These findings highlight the need for enhanced AIV surveillance in South America, especially in areas of high-risk, such as LAMs.",

Amplicons were obtained using Phusion High-Fidelity DNA polymerase (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) with gene specific universal oligonucleotide primers as described. 28 DNA was subsequently purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, using Zymoclean Gel DNA Recovery (Zymo Research Corporation Irvine, CA, USA). Fulllength gene segments were ligated into the pCR-Blunt II-TOPO (Life Technologies Corporation) and amplified in HB101 E. coli strain (Zymo Research Corporation). Smaller gene fragments produced using HA1134F/HA-NS 890R primers were sequenced directly after gel purification. 29 Sequencing was performed by Sanger sequencing at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Biotechnology Center and at the St Jude Hartwell Center using segment specific primers. 28, 29 Host species were identified by PCR barcoding using primers designed to amplify a~700 bp segment of the mitochondrial cytochrome-oxidase I, obtained from AIV-positive samples then sequenced as described. 30 AIV gene segments and cytochrome-oxidase I similarities were analyzed by BLAST. 31 The nucleotide sequences obtained in this study are available from GenBank under accession numbers KX097952 to KX097966.",

AIV was first detected in March when 3/226 birds tested positive (1.3%) by RT-qPCR, peaked in April with 19/112 positive birds (17.0%), subsiding in subsequent months, indicating a self-contained occurrence. No positive samples were obtained in subsequent sampling efforts after September 2015. Unfortunately, due to accessibility issues, no serum samples were able to be collected to corroborate swabs. Based on sampling data, guinea fowl and turkeys were more likely to be AIV-positive as compared with chickens (guinea fowl: OR = 10.65, 95% CI: 2.82-40.31, Po0.001; turkey: OR = 4.47, 95% CI: 1.10-18.15, P = 0.036).

Phylogenic and sequence analysis of all gene segments showed their similarity to wild bird viruses of North American origin, similar to other H11 viruses obtained in Central and South America to date. 15, 45, 46 However, unlike other poultry adapted AIVs, the N2 protein displayed a full-length stalk region. 47, 48 The conservation of the stalk sequence implies that at the time of sampling there was still no significant adaptation of the H11N2 in Galliformes in spite of its transmission amongst domestic poultry at the LAM. However, future sampling efforts may pick up adaptations if these viruses continue to circulate in the LAM. Lack of significant adaptation suggests that this outbreak occurred from a recent introduction by wild birds into poultry. 49 Interestingly, despite having the majority of characteristics of a wild bird virus, HGF/Colombia, efficiently replicated in poultry and was able to transmit to na\u00efve contact animals, indicating a potential risk for poultry in the region. Epidemiologically, it is extremely difficult to determine the origin of the LAM H11 viruses for several reasons. First, birds at LAM are received from commercial and backyard poultry farms located throughout Medellin and the surrounding cities, but can occasionally be imported from other provinces throughout the country. Furthermore, birds are housed in close contact and sick animals are not separated from healthy ones. The combination of multiple sources of birds, constant influx of animals and close contact make it very hard to trace the origin of the infection. One possible explanation is that the virus was introduced at the LAM in situ. Doves and passerines feeding on leftover grains are commonplace throughout the market and could act as potential carriers of AIV. 50 Alternatively, many of the birds for sale at the LAM are raised in backyard flocks that are often exposed to wild birds, 51 and could have therefore carried the virus to the LAM. As this is the first study to observe AIV in a South American LAM, future studies aimed at clarifying transmission dynamics within the markets are needed. Importantly, they should involve sampling feral birds at the LAM as well as the screening of poultry on their arrival to the market. Environmental screening of cages, floors and equipment as well as abiotic factors, like temperature and humidity, could also provide important information as to whether these contribute to the spread and maintenance of AIV in South American LAM. Our results also indicate that guineafowls and turkeys had higher odds to be infected by AIV at the LAM compared with chickens and could therefore act as sentinel species in further studies.",
