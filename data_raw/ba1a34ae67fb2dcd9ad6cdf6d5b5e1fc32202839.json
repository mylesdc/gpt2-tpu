Unlike most CoVs that antagonize type I interferon (IFN) production, previous studies showed that TGEV infection induces IFN-I production both in vivo and in vitro. However, the underlying mechanism(s) remain largely unknown. In this study, we found that TGEV infection significantly facilitated IFN-\u03b2 production as well as activation of the transcription factors IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-\u03baB) in porcine kidney (PK-15) cells. Screening of TGEV-encoded proteins demonstrated that non-structural protein 14 (nsp14) was the most potent IFN-\u03b2 inducer and induced IFN-\u03b2 production mainly by activating NF-\u03baB but not IRF3. Further analysis showed that nsp14 interacted with DDX1, a member of the DExD/H helicase family. Knockdown of DDX1 by specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) significantly decreased nsp14-induced IFN-\u03b2 production and NF-\u03baB activation. Furthermore, TGEV-induced IFN-\u03b2 production and IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression were decreased in cells transfected with DDX1-specific siRNA, indicating the vital role of DDX1 to TGEV-induced IFN-\u03b2 responses. In summary, our data revealed a potential coactivator role of host RNA helicase DDX1 to the induction of IFN-\u03b2 response initiated by TGEV and demonstrated that nsp14 is an important IFN inducer among the TGEVencoded proteins.",

Our previous quantitative proteomics analysis revealed that TGEV infection induced canonical IFN-I signaling through Janus kinase signal transducer and activator of the transcription 1 (JAK-STAT1) pathway, and eight tested ISGs, including IFNinduced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1 (IFIT1), IFIT2, IFIT3, OAS1, OAS2, Mx1, Mx2, and ISG15 were upregulated after TGEV infection (9) . These early results indicated that TGEV infection activated the IFN-I pathway in vitro and in vivo. However, the underlying mechanism(s) utilized by TGEV to induce IFN-I, and especially which viral protein(s) contribute to it, remain largely unclear.",

            "text": "The IFN-I response is a well-known innate immune reaction that occurs in response to virus infection and considered as an important bridge between innate and adaptive immunity. Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-\u03baB) and IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) are two critical transcription factors for the regulation of IFN-I production. Secreted IFN-I then stimulates the JAK-STAT1 signaling pathway to induce the expression of numerous ISGs, which collaborate to regulate the replication of virus (10) . Many viruses antagonize IFN responses to benefit their propagation, and some viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (11), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) (12), influenza A virus (IAV) (13) , encephalomyocarditis virus (14), Reovirus (15), herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV2) (16), respiratory syncytial virus (17), Newcastle disease virus (18) , and Sendai virus (SEV) (19) initiate innate immune responses. Different viruses employ different mechanisms to regulate innate immune responses. For example, HSV2 induces IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 production through toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9), DNA-dependent activator of IFN regulatory factors (DAI), and IFN-inducible 16 (16) . For IAV infection, at least TLR3, TLR7, Retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), and pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) are responsible for the detection of IAV and subsequent innate immune responses (13) . Elucidating the mechanisms through which viruses regulate innate immune responses will help us understand the interactions between virus and host.",

            "text": "The significant roles of many CoV proteins in the regulation of innate immune response have been identified. For example, nsp1, nsp7, nsp15, Papain-like protease (PLpro), ORF3b, ORF6, (25) . This indicated the potential effect of TGEV nsp14 on IFN-\u03b2 induction, which is in line with our data and further confirms our conclusion using a reverse genetic system. Although nsp14 was identified as a key IFN-\u03b2 activator among TGEV-encoded proteins, it remains unclear which PRR(s) is involved in its detection and induction of IFN-\u03b2 production. Indeed, viral proteins, similar to viral nucleic acids or replication intermediates, can in some cases also function as PAMPs, specifically recognized by certain host PRRs, such as TLR2 and TLR4, to modulate the IFN responses during viral infection (46, 47) . For example, the M glycoprotein of SARS-CoV has been reported to function as a novel cytosolic PAMP to promote IFN-\u03b2 production by activating a non-canonical TLR signaling cascade (26) . In addition to the four major PRR groups reported previously, including TLRs, RIG-I-like receptors, NOD-like receptors and cytoplasmic DNA receptors (48) , multiple DExD/H-box helicases, such as DDX1, DDX3, DDX9, and DDX41, were reported recently to act as PRRs and sense viral PAMPs to activate the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway and induce IFN-\u03b2 production (49) (50) (51) (52) (53) . Previous study revealed that DDX1, DDX21, and DHX36 form a complex with the adaptor molecule TRIF to sense dsRNA in dendritic cells (53) . In this paper, DDX1 interacted with TGEV nsp14 in a RNA-independent manner and enhanced both TGEVand nsp14-induced activation of IFN-\u03b2 responses. However, the direct interactions between nsp14 and DDX21 or DHX36 were not observed. We speculated that nsp14 may be sensed by DDX1/ DDX21/DHX36 complex by interacting with DDX1. These results suggest that nsp14 may be recognized as PAMP by DDX1, (e) PK-15 cells were transfected with psiDDX1 or siNC, and 12 h later, cells were mock infected or infected with TGEV (MOI = 0.5) for 24 h. Then, the cells were collected for western blot assay with specific antibodies against p65, p-p65, DDX1, or TGEV N protein, using \u03b2-actin expression as a loading control. The ratio of phosphorylated/total p65 was analyzed using ImageJ Software. (F-J) PK-15 cells were treated as described for (e) and collected at 24 hpi. Cell RNAs were extracted for RT-qPCR to examine the mRNA expression levels of IFIT1 (F), IFIT2 (g), IFIT3 (h), IL-6 (i), and IL-8 (J). The mRNA expression levels were normalized to porcine GAPDH transcripts. Values are the mean \u00b1 SD of three independent tests. *P < 0.05 or **P < 0.01 compared with the siNC group. which triggers an antiviral response. Further studies are required to investigate this in more detail. DDX1 is a DExD/H helicase family member composed of the DEAD-box and related DEAH, DexH, and DexD protein family and is involved in multiple cellular processes of RNA metabolism (54, 55) . Besides these traditional roles, it appears that multiple proteins of the DexD/H-box helicase family are associated with viral components and/or have alternative effects on viral propagation (56) (57) (58) . For instance, DDX3 shows antiviral functions against vaccinia virus, DENV, and HBV (59-61), but is of benefit for HCV and HIV infection (62, 63) . In addition, DDX1 interacts with the nsp3 of Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus and enhances viral multiplication (64) . The interaction of DDX1 with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Rev protein is involved in the regulation of virus replication (65) . In the present study, the knockdown and ectopic expression of DDX1 demonstrated that DDX1 had antiviral activity against TGEV replication (data not shown). Interestingly, earlier studies also showed an interaction between DDX1 with coronavirus (IBV and SARS-CoV) nsp14, and in contrast to TGEV, this interaction might enhance the replication of IBV (31) . This difference suggests that DDX1 is not likely to be a general target against CoV infection.",

Difference from other CoVs, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV which antagonize IFN-I, TGEV infection induces IFN-I production, and a most recent paper showed that poly(I:C)induced IFN-I responses could only inhibit TGEV replication in the early infection stage, but failed in the late infection stage (23) . They also demonstrated that the activation of IFN-I responses by TGEV infection cannot inhibit viral replication. Our results are consistent with the conclusion proposed by Zhu and colleagues. In addition, it is surprising that the expression levels of IFN-\u03b2 are paralleled with the increase of viral RNA during TGEV infection. These may explain why the effect of DDX1 on TGEV replication was moderate accompany with its significant role in IFN-\u03b2 induction by TGEV.

The cells lysates were collected for dual luciferase assays at 24 hpi. (B) PK-15 cells were infected with TGEV as described in panel A and harvested at 24 hpi. Cell RNAs were extracted for RT-qPCR to examine the mRNA expression levels of IFN-\u03b2. The mRNA expression levels were normalized to porcine GAPDH transcripts. Values are the mean \u00b1 SD of three independent tests. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, or ***P < 0.001 compared with the mock infection group. (e) PK-15 cells were infected or mock infected with TGEV (MOI = 0.02, 0.1, 0.5). The supernatants were collected for UV-irradiation and then transferred onto fresh PK-15 cells, followed by infection with vesicular stomatitis virus expressing green fluorescent protein (VSV-GFP) at 24 h later. Cells were observed with fluorescence microscope at 16 hpi. The supernatants from SEV-treated cells served as a positive control.",
