            "text": "Background: 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthetases (OAS) are interferon inducible enzymes that polymerizes ATP to 2'-5'-linked oligomers of adenylate (2-5As). As part of the innate immune response, these enzymes are activated by viral double stranded RNA or mRNAs with significant double stranded structure. The 2-5As in turn activate RNaseL that degrade single stranded RNAs. Three distinct forms of OAS exist in human cells (OAS1, 2 and 3) with each form having multiple spliced variants. The OAS enzymes and their spliced variants have different enzyme activities. OAS enzymes also play a significant role in regulating multiple cellular processes such as proliferation and apoptosis. Moreover, Single nucleotide polymorphisms that alter OAS activity are also associated with viral infection, diabetes and cancer. Thus detection of OAS enzyme activity with a simple spectrophotometric method in cells will be important in clinical research. Results: Here we propose a modified coupled spectrophotometric assay to detect 2-5 oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) enzyme activity in prostate cell lines as a model system. The OAS enzyme from prostate cancer cell lysates was purified using Polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) bound activated sepharose beads. The activated OAS enzyme eluted from Sepharose beads showed expression of p46 isoform of OAS1, generally considered the most abundant OAS isoform in elutes from DU14 cell line but not in other prostate cell line. In this assay the phosphates generated by the OAS enzymatic reaction is coupled with conversion of the substrate 2-amino-6mercapto-7-methylpurine ribonucleoside (methylthioguanosine, a guanosine analogue; MESG) to a purine base product, 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine and ribose1-phosphate via a catalyst purine nucleoside phosphorylase (phosphorylase) using a commercially available pyrophosphate kit. The absorbance of the purine base product is measured at 360 nm. The higher levels of phosphates detected in DU145 cell line indicates more activity of OAS in this prostate cancer cell line. Conclusion: The modified simple method detected OAS enzyme activity with sensitivity and specificity, which could help in detection of OAS enzymes avoiding the laborious and radioactive methods.",

            "text": "The interferon inducible anti-viral 2-5 oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) enzyme is part of the cellular innate immune response [1] [2] [3] . There are eight to ten OAS isoforms due to alternative splicing and gene duplications [4, 5] . In humans, the OAS gene family is composed of four genes on locus 12q24.1-q24.2: hOAS1, hOAS2, hOAS3 and hOASL [6, 7] . A pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMPs) such as dsRNA or mRNA with significant double stranded structures stimulates OAS to catalyze the polymerization of ATP to form 2'-5'-linked oligomers of adenylate (2-5As) [4, 8] . The subsequent elongation reaction is (n + 1) ATP \u2192 Ppp5' A(2'p5' A)n + nPPi [9] . 2-5A functions through its receptor, the 2-5Adependent ribonuclease (RNaseL), a ubiquitous 83-kDa protein that dimerizes into its catalytically active form upon binding 2-5A [4, 10, 11] . The activated RNaseL cleaves the single stranded RNA with UU or UA dinucleotide at the 3' end [4, 8, 12, 13] . Thus activated OAS-RNaseL system degrades viral and cellular RNA and subsequently inhibits protein synthesis [14] . Earlier studies also showed that OAS-RNase L system triggers apoptosis via mitochondrial pathway [15, 16] . It is also known that OAS silencing attenuates interferon induced anti-proliferative and antiviral signaling and stimulates anchorage independent cell growth [8] . The exogenous recombinant porcine OAS1 exhibits broad-spectrum antiviral activity through the activation of the IFN system that is independent of RNaseL [17] . Thus OAS1 dependent polymerization of ATP regulates multiple cellular functions that are dependent or independent of RNaseL.",

The phosphate generated during the enzymatic reaction converts the substrate 2-amino-6mercapto-7-methylpurine ribonucleoside (methylthioguanosine, a guanosine analogue; MESG) to a purine base product, 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine and ribose1-phosphate via a catalyst purine nucleoside phosphorylase. This conversion causes a shift in absorbance from 330 nm of substrate (MESG) to 360 nm of purine base product (2-amino-6mercapto-7-methylpurine) [31] . Further this method was modified to detect pyrophosphates generated in several biochemical reactions by converting the pyrophosphates to inorganic phosphates by a phosphatase. Thus the reaction producing pyrophosphate can be coupled to inorganic phosphate detection [31] . This modified method of detecting pyrophosphate has been known to measure activity of acetyl CoA synthetase and amino-acyl-tRNA synthetase activity which are also involved in pyrophosphate generation [32, 33] . The modified pyrophosphate detection method is also employed in hydroxamate-MESG assay which measures the activity of adenylating enzyme via measurement of pyrophosphate generated from ATP during the activation of carboxylic acid to form acyl-adenylate intermediate. The coupled hydroxamate assay characterizes the adenylate enzyme that do not undergo rapid ATP -PPi exchange during the acylation of the protein substrate like hydroxamate [34] .",

The Poly I:C conjugated and activated sepharose beads to purify OAS enzymes from cell lysates is well established and described earlier [38] . The bound enzyme was eluted and was analyzed for the expression of p46 isoform of OAS1 before testing the purified lysates to detect OAS enzyme activity. The OAS1 (p46) isoform protein expression was detected in crude cell lysates from DU145 cell lines but was absent or non-detectable in 293T, LNCaP and RWPE1 cell lines. The 293T cell line was used as a negative control as it lacks the active form of OAS1 (Fig. 2a) . Figure 2b shows the OAS1 (p46) isoform expression in the cell lysates purified by Poly I:C conjugated Sepharose beads. OAS1 (p46) was detected in the poly I:C sepharose affinity purified lysates from DU145 cells but not in the purified lysates from other prostate cell lines and 293T cells. Thus the presence of OAS1 in purified lysates of DU145 suggested that the poly I:C conjugated sepharose affinity purification system is functional and results in the enrichment of OAS enzyme. The absence of detectable OAS enzyme from the DU145 cell lysate purified with inactivated Sepharose beads with no bound poly I:C used as a negative control further supports the specificity of the affinity purification system. Furthermore, no GAPDH expression was observed in the purified fraction suggesting the poly I:C conjugated sepharose beads specifically captured only OAS (Fig. 2b) . The first wash flow through, collected after binding of OAS enzyme to poly I:C-sepharose beads resulted in undetectable p46 OAS1 enzyme suggesting that the affinity column captured essentially all the enzyme present in the cell lysate (Fig. 2b) . These purified fractions were used for detecting OAS enzyme assay by simple and rapid pyrophosphate assay.",

The resulting product has an absorbance at 360 nm. A standard curve was constructed to detect the change in absorbance with increasing concentration of pyrophosphate. A gradual decrease in MESG absorbance with increasing concentration of pyrophosphate at 330 nm was observed after addition of enzyme PNP and inorganic phosphatase (Fig. 3a) . Correspondingly, with the increasing concentration of the pyrophosphate, an increase in the absorbance of the product 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine was observed at (Fig. 3b) . The activity of OAS in the Poly I:C conjugated affinity beads purified cell lysate in terms of the pyrophosphate generated during enzymatic reaction can be detected by measuring increase in absorbance of the product or decrease in absorbance of the substrate. The amount of pyrophosphate generated can then be determined from the standard curve ( Fig. 3a and b) .",

The enzyme activity measured in purified prostate cell lysates and the negative control 293T cells which lack endogenous OAS1 by pyrophosphate assay kit. The enzymatic conversion of 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine ribonucleoside (MESG) substrate to 2amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine is directly proportional to the amount of inorganic phosphate produced by the OAS enzyme. There is a significant increase in absorbance of product 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine at 360 nm in DU145 cell lines showing high OAS enzyme activity in this cell lines as compared to the other two prostate cell lines which did not show any enzyme activity (Fig. 4) . OAS enzyme activity was not observed in negative control 293T purified cell lysate and the DU145 cell lysate passed through sepharose beads not activated or conjugated to Poly I:C. These results demonstrated a consistency between the expression and activity of OAS1 enzyme (p46) in purified lysates from DU145 cell lines as compared to other prostate cell lines (Figs. 2 and 4) .

The data shown in Fig. 5 shows the expected wavelength shift from 330 nm to 360 nm for the enzymatic reaction on purified cell lysates from DU145 cells. These results indicated that the Poly I:C bound sepharose beads affinity purifies and activates OAS enzyme in DU145 cell lysates. The eluted purified lysate rich in OAS enzyme reacts with ATP in the elution buffer and polymerizes it to generate 2-5A and pyrophosphates. The pyrophosphate is further converted in to single phosphate molecules with the help of the enzyme pyrophosphatase. The phosphates react with the substrate MESG with peak absorbance at 330 nm and convert it to the product with peak absorbance at 360 nm, thus creating the shift in the absorbance peak and suggesting higher activity in purified DU145 cell lysates.",

The spectrophotometric method is a simple two step reaction based on measurement of pyrophosphates generated during ATP polymerization reaction in the presence of active OAS enzyme. The pyrophosphate is converted in to phosphate by inorganic phosphatase enzyme and the reaction of phosphates with its substrate MESG results in formation of purine based product causing shift in the absorbance from 330 nm to 360 nm. This technique has advantage over hazardous radio-labelling and time consuming methods with more than 4-5 step reactions to measure active OAS enzyme in prostate cells. The method can be applied to detect OAS activity from any cell/tissue with appropriate modification.",
