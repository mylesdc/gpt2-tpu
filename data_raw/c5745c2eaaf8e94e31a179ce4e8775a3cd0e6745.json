The aim of this study was to evaluate the regulation of vascular function and assess the vascular redox balance in ACE2-deficient (ACE2 -/y ) animals. Experiments were performed in 20-22 week-old C57BL/6 and ACE2 -/y male mice. Evaluation of endothelium-dependent and -independent relaxation revealed an impairment of in vitro and in vivo vascular function in ACE2 -/y mice. Drastic reduction in eNOS expression at both protein and mRNA levels, and a decrease in \u2022 NO concentrations were observed in aortas of ACE2 -/y mice in comparison to controls. Consistently, these mice presented a lower plasma and urine nitrite concentration, confirming reduced \u2022 NO availability in ACE2-deficient animals. Lipid peroxidation was significantly increased and superoxide dismutase activity was decreased in aorta homogenates of ACE2 -/y mice, indicating impaired antioxidant capacity. Taken together, our data indicate, that ACE2 regulates vascular function by modulating nitric oxide release and oxidative stress. In conclusion, we elucidate mechanisms by which ACE2 is involved in the maintenance of vascular homeostasis. Furthermore, these findings provide insights into the role of the renin-angiotensin system in both vascular and systemic redox balance.",

            "text": "Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), a zinc metalloprotease, is an important component of the RAS [4] . It catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin II (Ang II) to angiotensin-(1-7) (Ang-(1-7)). Therefore, it determines the balance between the vasoconstrictor/pro-oxidative peptide Ang II, which is originally produced by ACE and acts via its receptor AT1, and the vasodilatory/antioxidative peptide Ang-(1-7), which interacts with its receptor Mas [5, 6] . Consequently, the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis represents a protective arm of the RAS, which counteracts deleterious actions of the ACE/Ang II/AT1 axis. Accordingly, altered expression and/or activity of ACE2 have been associated with major cardiac and vascular pathophysiologies. ACE2-deficient mice exhibit a higher susceptibility to atherosclerosis [7] [8] [9] , diabetic nephropathy [10, 11] , myocardial infarction [12] , and cardiac hypertrophy [13] [14] [15] [16] .",

Oxidation of \u2022 NO by superoxide anion ( \u2022 O 2 -) and consequent formation of peroxynitrite ( -ONOO) is discussed to be an important factor contributing to the development of endothelial dysfunction [2] .

Euthanasia was performed using an overdose of inhalable anesthetics. Mice were maintained in individually ventilated cages (IVC), 34\u00d719\u00d713 cm (Tecniplast 1 S.p.A., Hohenpeissenberg, Germany) under a 12 hr light/ dark cycle, with lights on at 6 am, with free access to standard chow (0.25% sodium, SSNIFF 1 Spezialit\u00e4ten, Soest, Germany) and drinking water ad libitum. The colony of ACE2-deficient mice on C57BL/6 genetic background [4] was maintained by breeding homozygous ACE2-deficient females (ACE2 -/-) with hemizygous males (ACE2 -/y ). Independent cohorts of [20] [21] [22] week-old ACE2 -/y and age matched C57BL/6 control (WT) male mice were used for the following experiments: evaluation of in vivo endothelial function; metabolic cages, including urine collection, blood sampling, and organ collections for the biochemical analysis. Basic blood pressure and heart rate were measured by radiotelemetry as described before [19] .",

Next, 50\u03bcL from the prepared curve points or from the aorta homogenate samples (or plasma) were plated in duplicate, with the addition of 50\u03bcL of working solution/HRP for beginning the reaction. The microplates were incubated at room temperature for 120 minutes, protected from light, and read at wave lengths of 530 nm and 590 nm for excitability and emission, respectively, in a microplate reader (Tecan 200 Infinite 1 200 PRO plate reader, M\u00e4nnedorf, Switzerland).",

The vasodilatory response to ACh did not differ between ACE2 -/y and WT mice over the dose range of 50 to 200 ng.kg -1 (Fig 1C) .

Determination of nitrite and nitrate (NOx), stable \u2022 NO metabolites, in body fluids is widely used as a marker of \u2022 NO production [29] . Both plasma nitrite concentration (Fig 2A) and the urinary NOx excretion rates Fig 2B) were markedly decreased in ACE2 -/y mice in comparison to WT animals. These results indicate that \u2022 NO production is impaired in ACE2-deficient mice. eNOS is the main source of plasma \u2022 NO. To evaluate eNOS activity, we next investigated \u2022 NO release in vitro in aortic segments of ACE2 -/y mice. ACh-induced \u2022 NO release was decreased in ACE2 -/y mice compared to WT animals (Fig 2C) . This effect was blunted by the eNOS inhibitor L-NAME (Fig 2C) . To exclude the possibility that the decrease in \u2022 NO production was due to an altered activity of arginase, an enzyme which competes with NOS isoforms for the same substrate, L-arginine, we also measured activity of this enzyme. No significant difference was found in total arginase activity (Fig 2D) between ACE2 -/y and WT mice, arguing that decrease in the \u2022 NO production was due to a reduction in eNOS activity. eNOS activity is regulated by phosphorylation at multiple sites. Therefore we evaluated the phosphorylation status of eNOS in ACE2 -/y mice. Both the amount of total eNOS protein and eNOS phosphorylated at the activation site Ser1177 (Fig 2E and 2F) were significantly decreased in aortic tissue of ACE2 -/y compared to WT mice, whereas the relation between P-eNOS Ser1177 and total eNOS was unaffected by ACE2-deficiency (Fig 2H) . Moreover, eNOS mRNA expression was reduced in aorta of ACE2 -/y mice, further confirming a downregulation of eNOS expression evoked by the lack of ACE2. The HSP90 (Fig 3A) , AKT (Fig 3B) , P-AKT (Fig 3C) , and P-AKT/ AKT ratio (Fig 3D) remained unchanged between strains, suggesting that the impairment in \u2022 NO generation observed in ACE2 -/y mice is driven by AKT-independent pathways.",

We hypothesized that reduced \u2022 NO availability may contribute to the increased oxidative stress in ACE2 -/y mice. Indeed, evaluation of lipid peroxidation, which is an indicator of oxidative stress, revealed a significant increase in the levels of the TBARS, malondialdehyde (MDA), in plasma, urine, and aorta of ACE2 -/y mice (Fig 4A-4C) . Also direct measurement of the \u2022 O 2 release in the aorta showed an elevation in oxidative stress in ACE2 -/y mice in comparison to WT animals ( Fig 4D) . However, ACE2 deletion did not affect aortic concentrations of H 2 O 2 (Fig 4E) , a \u2022 O 2 dismutation product generated by superoxide dismutase (SOD). Analysis of enzymes involved in ROS metabolism showed a significant decrease in both total SOD and catalase activity in aorta of ACE2 -/y mice (Fig 4F and 4I , respectively). Concurrently, the mRNA levels of SOD1 (Fig 4G) , but not SOD2 ( Fig 4H) and catalase ( Fig 4J) were lower in ACE2 -/y than in WT mice. Interestingly, under similar experimental conditions, the aortic glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity in ACE2 -/y mice was~2-fold higher than that of WT animals (Fig 4K) . Since enhanced oxidative stress was observed in aorta of ACE2 -/y mice, we analyzed the expression of uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2), an inner-mitochondrial key regulator of intracellular ROS, by real-time PCR analysis using total RNA from aorta tissue. ACE2 deletion induced a significant decrease in UCP2 mRNA levels (Fig 4M) , compared with the control animals. In contrast, the expression of other isoforms of UCP, UCP1 and UCP3, were not changed (Fig 4L-4N) .",

We took advantage of a mouse model with genetic deletion of ACE2 to address the role of this enzyme in the regulation of the balance between \u2022 O 2 and released \u2022 NO within the endothelial environment which is pivotal in the maintenance of vascular homeostasis [18, 30] . The major finding of the present study demonstrated the establishment of a novel equilibrium in the vascular wall of in ACE2-deficient mice through processes associated with increased aortic oxidative stress and decreased \u2022 NO release. In our study, we have shown that genetic ablation of ACE2 in mice on a C57BL/6 genetic background leads to a small but significant elevation in blood pressure, which is probably the result of vascular dysfunction. These data are consistent with a previous study showing increase in blood pressure in ACE2 -/y mice on C57BL/6 background [31] , but does not concur with other studies in different mouse strains [4, 31, 32] . Other groups may have missed the small change in blood pressure due to the mixed genetic background, high variability of the blood ACE2 Deletion Leads to Vascular Dysfunction pressure data and a lack of statistical power. The potential reasons for these discrepant results have been comprehensively discussed [33] . Interestingly, the backcross of the ACE2-null allele to the FVB/N background led to a more dramatic blood pressure upregulation in the resulting animals (our unpublished data), similar to the phenotype observed in Mas-deficient mice on the C57BL/6 [5] and on the FVB/N [19] backgrounds, suggesting a protective role of the C57BL/6 background in blood pressure regulation.",

However, the response to the endothelium independent vasodilator, SNP, was enhanced in ACE2 -/y mice, pointing to an adaptation process happening under chronic removal of ACE2. These in-vivo observations were reproduced in vitro in isolated aortic rings and are, therefore, not caused by any systemic alterations in these mice. Probably, the altered SNP-response of the smooth muscle layer is induced by the chronic reduction in eNOS activity in ACE2-deficient animals, since a similar phenomenon was observed in eNOS-deficient mice: SNP induced a markedly greater accumulation of cGMP in aortic rings of these animals compared to controls [34] . The underlying molecular mechanisms, however, remained elusive but involved an increased activity of soluble guanylate cyclase.",

            "text": "In this study we observed a drastic reduction in \u2022 NO availability in ACE2 -/y mice, which was obvious from a reduced \u2022 NO release from intact aortic rings and a strong decrease in urinary concentration of NOx and plasmatic nitrite in ACE2-deficient mice. Nitrite serves as an indirect indicator of endothelial \u2022 NO release, and is reduced also in humans with endothelial dysfunction [29] . According to our data, these reduced levels of \u2022 NO in ACE2 -/y mice are due to two different effects of ACE2 depletion: a reduction in active eNOS and an inactivation of \u2022 NO by ROS. On one hand, the amount of phosphorylated eNOS at Ser1177, which modulates both the calcium sensitivity and activity of the enzyme, was significantly reduced in ACE2 -/y mice compared to control animals. Since ACE2 deletion did not alter the AKT pathway, the decrease in eNOS activity must be regulated by AKT-independent mechanisms [35] and could at least partially be explained by its lowered expression level, whereby the mechanisms leading to this downregulation of eNOS expression need further elucidation. On the other hand, increased oxidative stress observed in ACE2-deficient mice may lead to the depletion of BH 4 [36] , a cofactor essential for the coupling of eNOS, and thereby shift the balance between \u2022 NO and \u2022 O 2 generation by eNOS to the favor of the second [37, 38] , further decreasing \u2022 NO levels and increasing ROS production in these mice. eNOS uncoupling is an important mechanism leading to pathologic \u2022 O 2 release in the vascular endothelium, which induces decline in \u2022 NO availability. Quick oxidative inactivation of \u2022 NO by \u2022 O 2 -, and consequent formation of -ONOO, a potent oxidant [39] , plays a pivotal role in the development of endothelial dysfunction [40] . These events are associated with an increase in lipid peroxidation, as we observed in the present study by monitoring increased systemic and aortic TBARS levels. Increased superoxide and peroxynitrite levels have also recently been found by other groups in ACE2 -/y mice at baseline or after Ang II infusion and have been linked to increased NADPH oxidase activity [41, 42] . The increased ROS levels observed in ACE2 -/y mice can be also caused by a reduction in antioxidant capacity in these animals. This hypothesis is supported by a significant reduction in aortic SOD and catalase activity in ACE2 -/y mice, enzymes, which inactivate \u2022 O 2 - [39] . and convert H 2 O 2 to molecular oxygen and water [43] ., respectively. These results are in accordance with those previously demonstrating that exogenous SOD improves the endotheliumdependent vascular relaxation response to ACh at basal conditions [44] . Moreover, increasing vascular SOD activity induces a significant improvement in arterial relaxation in cholesterolfed rabbits [45] . Unexpectedly, the levels of H 2 O 2 in aorta were similar in both strains. This may perhaps be due to the increase of GPx and the decrease of catalase activities in the aortas of ACE -/y mice, which counterbalance each other and normalize the H 2 O 2 levels, since both enzymes are responsible for H 2 O 2 degradation [43, 46] . It has been shown that UCP2, an inner-mitochondrial key regulator of intracellular ROS, preserves endothelial function in obese diabetic mice [47] and prevents salt-sensitive hypertension [48] by promoting the increase in \u2022 NO bioavailability and suppressing ROS production. In agreement with these previous findings, our data demonstrate that ACE2 null mice show a significant decrease in UCP2 mRNA levels in aorta which may directly contribute to the increase in \u2022 O 2 and decreased \u2022 NO bioavailability and, consequently, to endothelial dysfunction.",

Concurrently, Bodiga and colleagues [14] showed an exaggerated increase in \u2022 O 2 production, probably by NAD(P)H oxidase following pressure-overload induced by aortic constriction in ACE2 -/y mice. The authors showed that Ang-(1-7) delivery by mini-osmotic pumps decreases the NAD(P)H oxidase activity and improves the early dilated cardiomyopathy in pressure-overloaded animals. Jin et al. [39] , showed that endothelial dysfunction induced by Ang II infusion is exaggerated in ACE2-deficient mice mainly by hyperactive ROS generation. In hypertensive rats, overexpressing human ACE2 in VSMC endothelium-dependent relaxation increased in response to ACh in both, in vitro and in vivo conditions [20] . Furthermore, we and others [49, 50] recently showed that pharmacological activation of ACE2 ameliorates endothelial dysfunction in hypertensive and diabetic animals. In two different mouse models lacking Mas, a central component of ACE2/ Ang/(1-7)/Mas axis, we have shown that the increase in local and systemic oxidative stress, observed in these mice, was strongly correlated with in vivo endothelial dysfunction [19] . Hence, our and other reports show that the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas arm of the RAS regulates endothelial function by modulating the oxidative stress and \u2022 NO release balance. Several studies have previously shown that \u2022 NO is a potent and central mediator of several physiopathological processes involved in cardiovascular regulation [18, 39, 51, 52] . Moreover, a number of studies in patients with cardiovascular diseases have described a close relationship between imbalance of vascular \u2022 NO and ROS concentrations and endothelial dysfunction [52, 53] . Hypertensive patients have been reported to have significantly higher levels of plasma lipid peroxidation when compared with normotensive subjects [54] . Accordingly, plasma MDA, an index of lipid peroxidation, was significantly and positively correlated with endothelial dysfunction in both humans [51, 55] and animal models [19, 56] . Thus, it is conceivable that in hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases an imbalance between the protective ACE2/ Ang-(1-7)/Mas arm, and the deleterious ACE/AngII/AT1 axis of the RAS induces a significant reduction in \u2022 NO bioavailability associated with oxidative stress and causes endothelial dysfunction.",
