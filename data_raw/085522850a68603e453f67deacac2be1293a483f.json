Monitoring virus genotype diversity is crucial to understand the emergence and spread of outbreaks, both aspects that are vital to develop effective prevention and treatment strategies. Hence, we developed an efficient method to classify virus sequences with respect to their species and sub-species (i.e. serotype and/or genotype). This tool provides an easy-to-use software implementation of this new method and was validated on a large dataset assessing the classification performance with respect to whole-genome sequences and partial-genome sequences.

In addition to the epidemic caused by DENV, which has been described in many tropical countries, the introduction of CHIKV and ZIKV in these countries is a major public health concern. These arboviruses are primarily transmitted by mosquitoes of the species Ae. Aegypti and its related diseases result in increased financial costs associated with PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | https://doi.diagnosis and treatment. To support the design of efficient diagnosis, prevention and treatment strategies, a bioinformatics tool has been developed for the genotyping of these viruses based on appropriate evolutionary models in an automatic, accurate and rapid manner. A set of virus reference sequences was obtained from GenBank and used for the development of the tools. This process involved the alignment of the reference sequences followed by phylogenetic tree reconstructions. To assign the genotypes uploaded by the user, the tool analyses the sequences one by one, genotypes through identification, alignment and phylogenetic reconstruction. This computational method allows the high-throughput classification of these virus species and genotypes in seconds. As shown experimentally, genotypes are classified most confidently using the envelope gene or complete genome sequences.",

To identify the viral genotypes, a multiple sequence alignment was constructed with the MAFFT alignment software [15] per virus species, using the Global-WG dataset. Each alignment was edited manually until a codon-correct alignment was achieved in all genes. The next step in this exploration involved a phylogenetic analysis using PhyML (i.e. Maximum likelihood, 1000 bootstrap replicates) and MrBayes (i.e. Bayesian) [16, 17] . With this approach, four main DENV clades (i.e. serotype 1 to 4) and 19 genotypes (i.e. 1I, 1II, 1III, 1IV, 1V, 2I, 2II, 2III, 2IV, 2V, 2VI, 3I, 3II, 3III, 3V, 4I, 4II, 4III and 4IV) were identified. These findings are in agreement with the current consensus in DENV classification [18] [19] [20] [21] . For CHIKV, three phylogenetic clades can be distinguished: The East-Central-South African (ECSA) genotype, the Asian-Caribbean genotype and the West African genotype. The West African genotype being more divergent and less widespread than the ECSA genotype and the Asian-Caribbean genotype [22, 23] . ZIKV, as well, can be classified into two genotypes. The African genotype, originally identified in Uganda in 1947 [24] , is found in many African countries [25] . The Asian genotype was identified in Malaysia in 1966 [26] , this genotype has recently caused the worldwide epidemic in Asia and the Pacific [27, 28] , and is responsible for the epidemic in the Americas [5] .",

For example, we normally start by selecting 5-10 sequences that represent the diversity of each virus genotypes. Sequences that met these selection criteria were quality controlled for the presence of insertions, deletions, frame shifts and non-IUPAC characters using VIRULIGN [32] . For DENV, we used the reference sequences that are included with the VIRULIGN software, for ZIKV, we used the reference sequence presented in [33] , and for CHIKV we constructed a new reference sequence from NC_004162 that we added to the VIRULIGN repository. Sequences that pass the quality control were aligned using MAFFT [15] , and were subjected to phylogenetic analysis using PAUP \ufffd (i.e. Neighbor Joining), MrBayes (i.e. Bayesian) and PhyML (i.e. Maximum likelihood) [16, 17, 34, 35] using GTR+G+I. Sequences that gave consistent topologies using all three tree inference methods were retained as potential reference sequences (see Supporting Information, S1 Table) and used in the next step of the evaluation process.",

Nearly all ZIKV NS5 sequences were correctly assigned to the African genotype (i.e. sensitivity of 97.72% and specificity of 100%).

These seven sequences are visualized in a phylogenetic tree of the WGS datasets, colored according to genotype.

However, note that these seven genomes could be properly assigned to serotype 1. for the ten whole genomes of DENV that could not be classified at genotype level are shown. Boot-scanning analysis was performed using a window length of 1500 base pairs and a step size of 100 base pairs. The different colours represent the genotypes for each serotype.

This plot was constructed using bootstrap results from Neighbor Joining trees (1000 bootstrap replicates), performed on the dataset of the indicated reference strains. The boot-scanning method uses a sliding window of a 1500 base pair segment that moves with steps of 100 base pairs along the genome. The X-axis represents the nucleotide position in the genome, and the Y-axis represents bootstrap support in percentages. The light-grey rectangular area marks the location of the envelope gene in each graph. The inset color code shows the genotypes defined in each virus species. For ZIKV (A), this is African and Asian. For CHIKV (B), this is Asian Caribbean (A-C), West African (WA) and East-Central-South African (ECSA). For DENV (C-F), the genotype is visualized by a Roman numeral. Only genotypes which showed less than 100% bootstrap support across the genome are shown.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0007231.g003",
