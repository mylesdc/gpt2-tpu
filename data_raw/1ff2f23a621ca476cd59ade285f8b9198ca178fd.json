This discovery resulted in a search for NADPH oxidase-activating substances as a potential new approach to treat autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We have recently shown that compounds inducing NCF1-dependent oxidative burst, e.g. phytol, have a strong ameliorating effect on arthritis in rats. However, the underlying molecular mechanism is still not clearly understood. The aim of this study was to use gene-expression profiling to understand the protective effect against arthritis of activation of NADPH oxidase in the immune system.",

Hence, global gene-expression profiling on inguinal lymph nodes was performed 10 days after the induction of pristaneinduced arthritis (PIA) and phytol administration. The differentially expressed genes could be divided into two pathways, consisting of genes regulated by different interferons. IFN-\u03b3 regulated the pathway associated with arthritis development, whereas IFN-\u03b2 regulated the pathway associated with disease protection through phytol. Importantly, these two molecular pathways were also confirmed to differentiate between the arthritis-susceptible dark agouti (DA) rat, (with an Ncf-1 DA allele that allows only low oxidative burst), and the arthritis-protected DA.Ncf-1 E3 rat (with an Ncf1 E3 allele that allows a stronger oxidative burst).",

We now show that the Ncf-1 allele that enhances oxidative burst and protects against arthritis is operating through an IFN-\u03b2associated pathway, whereas the arthritis-driving allele operates through an IFN-\u03b3-associated pathway. Treatment of arthritis-susceptible rats with an NADPH oxidase-activating substance, phytol, protects against arthritis. Interestingly, the treatment led to a restoration of the oxidative-burst effect and induction of a strikingly similar IFN-\u03b2-dependent pathway, as seen with the disease-protective Ncf1 polymorphism.",

RA is a chronic and severely disabling disease of unknown etiology, although both environmental [3] and genetic factors [4] are believed to play roles in its cause. There is presently no cure for RA, although a variety of different drugs is used to treat the symptoms. The most common treatments include disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs such as,methotrexate [5, 6] . Other efficient antirheumatic drugs are the recently developed biologicalresponse modifiers, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\u03b1 blockers, which reduce both the established inflammation and joint destruction [7] . The drawback of these treatments is an increased risk of infections because the body's defense system is impaired. Other biological-response modifiers targeting other cytokines or costimulatory molecules are currently being clinically tested and evaluated [8] . Despite this range of antirheumatic drugs, there is still a large number of RA patients for whom none of these treatments is effective [9,10], thus making the development of new therapies essential.",

This finding was a result of linkage analysis and positional cloning in an arthritis model in rats using a cross between the arthritis-susceptible dark agouti (DA) rat and the arthritis-resistant E3 strains DA.Ncf1 E3 ([14,16] . NCF-1 is the activating component of the NADPH oxidase complex, which, upon activation, produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) [17] . We found that the dramatic increase in arthritis severity was caused by a decreased capacity of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase complex to produce ROS. Interestingly, the lower oxidative burst led to a reduction in cell membrane proteins and activation of autoreactive and arthritogenic T cells [18] . Thus, the identified Ncf1 polymorphism and its effect on the immune system by decreased ROS production was concluded to be associated with the regulation of arthritogenic CD4 T cells in the immune priming phase [14, 19] .",

To analyze the in vivo effects of the NADPH oxidase activator phytol versus the effects of the arthritis-inducing compound pristane, global gene-expression profiling was performed. A biodistribution analysis of phytol was performed to determine which tissue and time point would be most relevant to investigate. Phytol was observed to accumulate slowly in inguinal lymph nodes, with peak levels being reached approximately 11 days after subcutaneous administration, which coincides with the onset period of arthritis. In the global gene-expression profiling, inguinal lymph nodes obtained 10 days after administration were analyzed. This analysis revealed several genes that were differentially expressed in rats with PIA compared with rats injected with phytol. A group of interesting genes was selected and verified by quantitative real-time PCR analysis in three further separate biological experiments, including a comparative study between the DA and DA.Ncf1 E3 congenic rats. The comparison between the two strains was aimed at determining whether the selected genes were differentially expressed in the arthritis-susceptible DA rat versus the arthritis-resistant congenic DA.Ncf1 E3 rat. Such data would indicate whether the NADPH oxidase-activating compound phytol is activating a pathway that is normally inactive in the absence of a fully functional Ncf1.",

Most of the administered phytol remained as a depot at the injection site (> 90%, data not shown), whereas phytol distributed to tissues was recovered mainly from the inguinal lymph nodes. Furthermore, the accumulation of phytol in the lymph nodes reached its maximum level 11 days after administration ( Figure 1 ). No phytol was detected in peripheral blood at the time points studied or in blood collected at earlier time points (2, 6, 13 or 25 hours after administration, data not shown). Further analysis of the biodistribution of phytol at the microscopic level in the inguinal lymph nodes was performed by microautoradiography. It was shown that phytol was distributed primarily to the cortical regions and also in the sinusoidal space of the inguinal lymph nodes (data not shown). Moreover, the staining seemed to appear between cells or in the cell membrane, but not intracellularly.",

To obtain a molecular understanding of the protective effects of phytol on PIA, four groups of animals were subjected to different conditions; (i) induced arthritis by injection with pristane, (ii) injection with phytol, (iii) injection with both pristane and phytol, and (iv) no treatment. All animals were killed close to disease onset, i.e.10 days after administration. Global gene-expression profiling using chip arrays (Genechip \u00ae ;Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) was performed on the collected inguinal lymph nodes from the described animals. The gene-expression pattern was quite different between treated rats and na\u00efve controls. Comparing any of the group of treated animals and untreated animals, > 350 differentially expressed genes were detected (at significance level p < 0.05 and absolute fold change > 1.4; data not shown). However, as the most interesting differences were to be found between the different treatments, the analysis focused on these groups. When comparing phytol-treated versus pristane-treated animals, the expression of 29 genes was significantly changed (p < 0.05, with absolute fold change > 1.4). Of these 29 genes, 13 showed expression in phytol-treated rats, whereas 16 genes showed higher expression in pristane-treated rats ( Figure   2 ). Because more complex gene induction was observed in animals given phytol plus pristane, further studies concentrated on analyses of single-compound administrations.",

Furthermore, NADPH-activating substances have both preventive and therapeutic effects on arthritis, which opens up new approaches for disease treatment [20].

We observed that the expression of our set of differentially expressed genes in our material varies dramatically during the disease progress (Figures 4, 5, 6) . Therefore, it is necessary to have information about which time point and tissue to analyze before initiating gene-expression profiling. Furthermore, we also analyzed, in other tissues (i.e. thymus, blood and spleen) the expression of the genes identified as differentially expressed in inguinal lymph nodes, and observed that the expression levels could be quite different or even undetectable in these tissues (data not shown). As a result, it is not possible to extrapolate the information between tissues and time points. In addition, the number of biological replicates used in the compared groups should be high enough to enable statistical analysis. Altogether, these issues make these studies extremely cumbersome to perform, especially when analyzing human samples.

Although pristane stimulates the expression of these cytokine-regulated genes, no direct conclusions about whether these genes are involved in the cause of arthritis can be drawn, as no difference in gene expression could be seen between the arthritis-susceptible strain (DA) and the arthritis-protected strain (DA.Ncf1 E3 ) (Figures 7 and 9C) . As the DA.Ncf1 E3 congenic rats carry the arthritis-protecting variant of Ncf1, one might speculate that the effect caused by the functional Ncf1 is to generate a resistance to the effect from induction of Ass, Cxcl9 and Mmp12 genes, which might otherwise contribute to the development of arthritis. Further investigation of the effect on disease regulation is needed to be able to propose a more exact role for these genes as potential markers of arthritis [64] .",

            "text": "Six genes (Best5, Irf7, Ifit3, Mx2, Oas1 and S100a9) were identified as genes induced by phytol ( Table 1) Interestingly, a clear tendency in the expression of Ifn\u03b2 between DA and DA.Ncf1 E3 strains was observed after injection with pristane, with the DA.Ncf1 E3 rats having higher expression of Ifn\u03b2 than the DA rats ( Figure 9B ). This difference in expression level clearly resembles the differences observed for the phytol-induced genes Best5, Irf7, Ifit3, Mx2 and Oas1 (Figure 8 ). It is therefore likely that the downstream effect of the polymorphism in Ncf1, as well as the therapeutic effect of phytol, involves regulation of an IFN-\u03b2 pathway. This IFN-\u03b2-regulated gene profile is interesting with respect to similarities to the patterns that have been identified in patients with SLE and in patients with juvenile arthritis treated with anti-TNF-\u03b1 [68] [69] [70] [71] , and in mouse models of SLE [72] . Subpopulations with active RA have also been shown to express increased levels of Ifn type I signature genes in peripheral blood [59] . These reports show an Ifn\u03b1/\u03b2 expression signature, which is very similar to that identified in the rats treated with phytol. However, in our study, the Ifn type I expression profile was linked to disease protection while the SLE Ifn type I profile was linked to disease progression. This may indicate that the interferon balance could be an important threshold denominator of autoimmune dis-eases, functioning as an essential balance for immune regulation, with an imbalance resulting in either SLE or arthritis. This is also exemplified by a recent study in which pristane was used to induce SLE in mice. In that study, chronic peritoneal administration of pristane elicited increased expression of the type I interferon-inducible genes Mx1, Irf7, IP-10 and Isg-15 as a consequence of SLE [72] . However, despite the similarities in expression pattern, it must be noted that the SLE studies were performed on tissues other than inguinal lymph nodes and on established disease, so that differences in gene profiles could be caused by tissue differences or time-dependent regulation. Also interesting is the fact that the present study points towards a disease-ameliorating pathway that is regulated by IFN-\u03b2. Therefore, as the present observation of increased Ifn type I signature genes was observed to be a signal for prevention of disease onset, in contrast to the studies in ongoing SLE [68] and arthritis [59] , one might speculate that increased IFN type I regulation is a way to downregulate an ongoing immune response. Such an attempt to limit the inflammatory response has been suggested previously [73] , and has also been indicated by experiments in our laboratory using Ifn\u03b2-deficient mice, Schematic representation of the differentially expressed genes and how they are induced upon injection by (A) pristane or (B) phytol Figure 11 Schematic representation of the differentially expressed genes and how they are induced upon injection by (A) pristane or (B) phytol. The molecular pathway that is shared between the arthritis resistant DA.Ncf1 E3 rat strain and the arthritis treatment achieved with phytol is the Ifn-\u03b2-dependent pathway, which results in the upregulation of Best5, Irf7, Ifit3, Oas1 and Mx2. The inflammatory arthritis that is induced by an injection with pristane is characterized by increased expression of the Ifn\u03b3-connected signature genes Ass, Cxcl9 and Mmp12, which potentially could be used as molecular markers for an initiating inflammatory response. As this pathway is also induced by pristane in the DA.Ncf1 E3 strain this upregulation per se does not cause arthritis. Most important in this mechanism is how administration of phytol induces arthritis protection via the Ifn-\u03b2regulated pathway in the arthritis-susceptible DA rats. where a prolonged arthritis severity was observed due to Ifn\u03b2 deficiency [74] . In fact, treatment with recombinant IFN-\u03b2 significantly reduces cartilage destruction and bone destruction in collagen-induced arthritis in mice, which suggested a beneficial effect in patients also [70] . However, to date no positive outcome of clinical trials using recombinant IFN-\u03b2 in RA has been presented [75, 76] . As we have shown that the effect of phytol on Ifn\u03b2-related genes is time-dependent and also correlates with the biodistribution of phytol to the inguinal lymph nodes, it is possible that tissue distribution as well as the dose and frequency of administration are crucial for the efficacy of arthritis treatment via this pathway.",

As a result, we consider S100a9 not to be regulated by IFN-\u03b2. It is more likely that the increased levels of S100a9 expression is a direct effect of increased concentrations of intracellular Ca 2+ induced by the NADPH oxidase-produced ROS [78, 79] . Increased expression of S100a9 is mostly reported to be proinflammatory. However, this knowledge is based on analyses from tissues and blood during ongoing inflammation, while these studies analyzed inguinal lymph nodes prior to disease onset. Hence, the expression levels for different timepoints of the disease process could differ. Even so, S100a9 may be a good biomarker for the in vivo efficacy of administered phytol as an activator of NADPH oxidase specifically in lymph node tissues.",

By extracting and verifying a relevant biological molecular mechanism from gene-expression profiling data, we also indicate a plausible relation between increased levels of ROS and an anti-inflammatory response regulated by an IFN-\u03b2 pathway. The use of gene-expression profiling to compare treatments in animal models of complex diseases also points to a useful pharmacogenomic approach to extract relevant information about the mechanism of action and to identify potential molecular biomarkers to be used in future animal experiments and clinical trials.",

Tissue distribution of phytol was determined as counts per minute (cpm) of tritium using a beta counter (LKB Wallac, Turku, Finland) and cpm/g tissue was determined as the relative distribution of phytol. Microautoradiography was performed on three individual rats 10 days after subcutaneous administration with tritiated phytol (167 \u03bcCi/rat). The inguinal lymph nodes were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and shipped on dry ice to Quest Pharmaceutical Services (Newark, DE, USA).

Double-stranded cDNA was in vitro transcribed to biotinylated cRNA (IVT labelling kit; Affymetrix) and then fragmented. The fragmented cRNA was mixed with hybridization spike controls (oligonucleotide B2 and a cRNA cocktail: BioB, BioC, BioD, and Cre; Affymetrix,). Aliquots of each sample were hybridized (16 hours at 45\u00b0C) to an array (GeneChip \u00ae Rat Expression Set 230A arrays; Affymetrix). The arrays were subsequently washed, stained and scanned according the manufacturer's instructions (GeneChip \u00ae Expression Analysis Technical Manual; Affymetrix). The data were analyzed using specific sofware (Robust Multi-Chip Analysis in GeneTraffic \u00ae UNO version 3.2-11; Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA, and Spotfire DecisionSite for Functional Genomics, version 8.1;Spotfire Inc., G\u00f6teborg, Sweden). The intensities were log 2 transformed and the mean log 2 intensity for each group calculated. The mean log 2 fold change was calculated for the phytol-treated animals versus the pristanetreated animals by subtracting the mean log 2 intensity for the pristane-treated rats from that for the phytol-treated rats. The total number of probe sets in the used rat Affymetrix chips was 15 923, and the average present call was 45%. Statistical significance of the difference in gene expression was determined using the two-sided Student's t-test. A transcript was considered differentially expressed if the mean absolute fold change was > 1.4 and the p value < 0.05. In addition, the mean intensity in the group showing the highest expression should be > 75. The average log 2 fold change between the animals treated with phytol plus pristane versus the animals treated with pristane alone and the corresponding statistical analysis were also calculated, although these data were not used to identify differentially expressed genes.",

The expression of Ass is induced by common pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1) [23,24]. CXCL9 (Chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 9, also known as Mig, (monokine induced by IFN-\u03b3)) is a chemokine belonging to the CXC subfamily of chemokines acting through G-protein-coupled receptors [25]. These proteins have chemoattraction and growth-promoting properties and are induced by IFN-\u03b3 and, to some extent, TNF-\u03b1 to attract T cells to sites of inflammation[26]. Higher levels of CXCL9 expression have been observed in the synovial tissues and fluids of patients with RA compared with tissues and fluids from control patients [27]. MMP12 (matrix metalloproteinase 12) belongs to the family of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) [28], which are involved in cell migration and degradation of cartilage and bone by remodeling the extracellular matrix. Inducers of expression of MMPs include IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1 [29] and IFN-\u03b3 [30]. Abnormal levels of MMPs have been found in patients with autoimmune disorders such as RA and multiple sclerosis [31].",

From the gene-expression data it is not possible to determine whether IRF-7 is upregulated by an increased level of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 as a downstream feedback regulator of the IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor or if increased IFN-\u03b2 level is the result of an upregulation of IRF-7 [35,41,36]. Oas1 and Mx2 are both induced upon viral invasion and IFN type I activation, and are thus regulated by the same pathway[67]. The expression ofBest5 can be induced by both IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3, but studies have shown IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 to have the strongest enhancing effect on the expression [32].
