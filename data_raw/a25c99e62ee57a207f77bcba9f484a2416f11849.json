The aim of this study was to establish the basic, in vitro characteristics of the life cycle such as replication kinetics, cellular ultrastructure, virion morphology, and induction of autophagy of PDCoV. Time-course analysis of viral subgenomic and genomic RNA loads and infectious titers indicated that one replication cycle of PDCoV takes 5 to 6 h. Electron microscopy showed that PDCoV infection induced the membrane rearrangements with double-membrane vesicles and large virion-containing vacuoles. The convoluted membranes structures described in alpha-and beta-coronavirus were not observed. PDCoV infection also increased the number of autophagosome-like vesicles in the cytoplasm of cells, and the autophagy response was detected by LC3 I/II and p62 Western blot analysis. For the first time, this study presents the picture of the PDCoV infection cycle, which is crucial to help elucidate the molecular mechanism of deltacoronavirus replication.",

            "text": "Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), which belongs to the genus Deltacoronavirus in the subfamily Coronavirinae of the family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales, was first reported in Hong Kong in 2012 [1] and thereafter isolated from pigs in the United States [2] and many Asian countries including China [3] [4] [5] . It causes acute diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration and mortality in nursing pigs [6, 7] . The PDCoV genome is a positive sense single-stranded RNA of approximately 25.4 kb in size. The genome organization of PDCoV is similar to those of other reported coronaviruses, with the typical gene order 5 -ORF1a/1b-Spike (S)-Envelope (E)-Membrane (M)-NS6-Nucleocapsid (N)/NS7-3 . Ultrastructural characterization of other CoVs in alpha-, beta-, or gamma-CoV genus such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] , human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) [15] , infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) [16] , transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) [17] and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) [18] has been performed. The studies on three CoV genera demonstrated that the architectures of the organelle during CoV infection are distinct between among alpha-/beta-coronaviruses and gammacoronavirus. Alpha-and beta-coronaviruses formed clusters of the double-membrane vesicle (DMV), which is highly conserved among coronaviruses, sometimes linked by a convoluted membrane [11, 15, [19] [20] [21] , whereas the gammacoronavirus IBV induced extensive paired membranes and smaller 60-80 nm spherules in addition to the DMVs [16] .",

Viral subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) load was monitored by one-step quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) targeting the membrane (M) gene as described previously (forward primer, 5 -ATCGACCACATGGCTCCAA-3 ; reverse primer, 5 -CAGCTCTTGCCCATGTAGCTT-3 ; and probe, 5 -FAM-CACACCAGTCGTTAAGCATGGCAAGCT-BHQ-3 [23] , as the M gene is expressed by the sgRNA, and viral genomic RNA (gRNA) load was detected by qRT-PCR targeting the non-structural protein (nsp) 2 encoding region (forward primer, 5 -GAAGGTGAAGATGATAGTG-3 ; reverse primer, 5 -GCTCTGGTTTAGGATAGA-3 ; and probes, 5 -FAM-TACTTCGTCGCTGCTGGTCTT-TAMRA-3 , as the nsp2 of ORF1a is expressed by the gRNA. Standard curves were performed to allow absolute quantitation of PDCoV RNA copy numbers based upon the levels of in vitro transcribed RNAs containing the targeting sequences [24] .",

            "text": "CoV infection is initiated by the interaction of the viral S protein with specific host cellular receptors followed by membrane fusion, and the cellular receptor for PDCoV entry has just been identified as porcine aminopeptidase N [24] . At 4 hpi, PDCoV virions were seen attached to the cell surface ( Figure 2E ). The process of likely endocytosis of PDCoV was also observed ( Figure 2F ), which needs further confirmation. Following internalization, CoV particles are transported and scattered into the cytoplasm. It is well known that viral gRNA is recognized directly by the host cell machinery and translated into non-structural proteins, which assemble into viral replication-transcription complexes (RTCs) on DMVs or other membrane structures [16, 21, 26] , coordinating the enzymes required for viral RNA transcription, proof-reading and capping of new viral transcripts. Similar events should apply to PDCoV infection as a large number of DMVs were seen at 6 hpi and thereafter. After completion of genome replication and RNA transcription, the virions of PDCoV start to assemble in the expanded rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) with irregular shape, as the surface was decorated with ribosomes ( Figure 2G ,H). Immature PDCoV precursors with an electron-dense periphery and clear core were present in the RER ( Figure 2H ) or in the lumen of a stack of adjacent cisternae, very likely the Golgi apparatus ( Figure 2I ). The precursors likely trafficked through the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), completing structural transformation into small, infectious virions in the Golgi complex. The virions were also observed in large circular organelles ( Figure 2J ). These structures, named as Large virion-containing vacuoles (LVCVs), have earlier been described for other CoVs-infected cells, which are thought to originate from Golgi compartments that expand to accommodate numerous virions [27] . Mature virions accumulate inside secretory vesicles, which tend to merge into bigger vesicles ( Figure 2J ). After that, vesicles containing mature virions moved to the cell periphery and eventually fuse with the cell membrane. In the final phase of infection, mature virions must escape the cell. PDCoV release was observed to occur via two pathways: exocytosis and cytolysis. Early virions, those generated within the first few replicative cycles, may be released by exocytotic fusion of virus-containing vesicles with plasma membranes without damage to the cell ( Figure 2K ). However, as viral infection progressed and the quantity of virus in the cells increased, large amounts of virus particles were released by cytolysis resulting in necrosis of the host cell ( Figure 2L ). CoV replication is closely tied to the formation of membrane-bound RTCs that alter cell membrane structures, as previously reviewed [19, 28] . Many such alterations were observed directly in an electron microscope (EM) of PDCoV-infected LLC-PK1 cells, including DMVs ( Figure. 2G, 2H, 3A and 3B), LVCVs ( Figure. 2I and 2J) , zippered ER ( Figure 3C ) and damaged mitochondria ( Figure.  3D ). The DMV architecture is a typical and highly conserved feature of CoV infections, with a diameter ranging from 150-300 nm with electron-dense cores [8, 9, 11, [13] [14] [15] [16] 26, 29] . DMVs play a role CoV replication is closely tied to the formation of membrane-bound RTCs that alter cell membrane structures, as previously reviewed [19, 28] . Many such alterations were observed directly in an electron microscope (EM) of PDCoV-infected LLC-PK1 cells, including DMVs ( Figure 2G ,H and Figure 3A ,B), LVCVs ( Figure 2I ,J), zippered ER ( Figure 3C ) and damaged mitochondria ( Figure 3D ). The DMV architecture is a typical and highly conserved feature of CoV infections, with a diameter ranging from 150-300 nm with electron-dense cores [8, 9, 11, [13] [14] [15] [16] 26, 29] . DMVs play a role not only in the synthesis of viral RNA [21] but also in helping to concentrate on viral proteins and offer protection from cellular antiviral detection and elimination machinery [28] . DMVs could be detected at 2 hpi in SARS-CoV or mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) infected cells and then the number of DMVs increased dramatically [11, 27] . The appearance of DMVs in PDCoV-infected cells was seen at 6 hpi ( Figure 2G ). The sizes of DMVs ranged from 200 to 400 nm. PDCoV induced a low number of DMVs and most of the DMVs were separate entities or in small clusters in the cytoplasm. Initially, the DMV inner and outer membranes were generally tightly apposed ( Figure 2G ,H) but, occasionally, some luminal space between the two lipid bilayers could be discerned ( Figure 3A ). Similar observations were previously made for SARS-CoV and IBV [11] . Most of the DMVs contained few or no fibrous material in the inner vesicles ( Figure 2G ,H and Figure 3A ). Interestingly, DMVs containing an electron-dense core could also be observed ( Figure 3B ). Previous researches confirmed that the detection of this core depended on the protocol used for the preparing of resin-embedded specimens. In chemically fixed samples, the interior of DMV appeared mainly electron translucent. However, the core can be preserved by using high-pressure freezing followed by freeze substitution. A similar phenomenon can be observed in the IBV infected cells and chemically fixed tracheal organ cultures. Two types of DMVs could well represent early and later stages in the existence of a DMV [30] . Previous research suggested that CoV DMV structures derive from ER membranes [11] [12] [13] , though the precise mechanism of membrane rearrangement remains controversial. In the context of nidovirus-induced DMV formation, two alternatives have been proposed: enwrapping and double budding [30] . The multiple EM images of zippered ER and small vesicles close to the zippered ER in PDCoV infected cells ( Figure 3C ) suggest that these structures were likely DMV precursors.",

The large evolutionary distance between the coronavirus genera might be attributed to such differences. Previous studies proposed that these structures were the site of viral genome translation and polyprotein processing. Further work will be needed to determine the details on membrane structures that participate in PDCoV RNA synthesis. PDCoV infection was shown to induce mitochondrion damage. Irregular mitochondria and mitochondria lacking cristae were observed after PDCoV infection, indicative of injured mitochondria ( Figure 3D ). We hypothesize that these structures may donate their membrane material to form autophagosomes [31] , as described below. ",

Regions of the cytoplasm become engulfed into large double membrane-bound vesicles termed autophagosomes, which are another type of distinct structures seen during CoV infection [29, 31] . Autophagosomes are distinguished from DMVs by the size and specific markers of autophagic activity. Double-membraned autophagosomes-like vesicles were detected in PDCoV-infected cells at 12 hpi and increased thereafter. The initial autophagic vacuoles contain cytosol and/or organelles that in appearance are morphologically intact, and similar to the cytosol and organelles elsewhere in the cell. The membrane of the vacuoles is partially visible as two bilayers separated by a narrow electron-lucent cleft [32] (Figure 3E ,F). It should be noted that these are characteristic features of coronavirus infection, and expression of SARS-CoV nsp3 alone induced similar structures.",

In order to further confirm that PDCoV induced autophagy, LC3 conversion in PDCoV-infected LLC-PK1 cells was determined by Western blot using an antibody recognizing both forms of LC3. The LC3-II/LC3-I ratio increased significantly from 12-24 hpi in PDCoV-infected cells relative to mock-infected cells ( Figure 4A,B) . This was consistent with the increase in autophagosomes observed in infected cells from 12-18 hpi under EM ( Figure 3E ,F). We also monitored autophagic flux, using western blot assay to measure changes in p62 protein levels upon infection. Because p62-bound polyubiquitinated proteins become incorporated into the completed autophagosome and are degraded in autolysosomes, they serve as an index of autophagic degradation [34] . PDCoV infection increased degradation of p62 in LLC-PK1 cells starting at 18 hpi ( Figure 4C,D) , indicating that accumulation of autophagosome-like vesicles is linked to autophagic activation. These results provided evidence that PDCoV infection may induce autophagy just like other CoVs [29, [35] [36] [37] .",

            "text": "A general response to viral infections is the activation of autophagy, which either has a positive or negative outcome depending on the nature of the virus. Initial work with MHV showed that although capable of inducing autophagy, it was replication-deficiet in ATG5 \u2212/\u2212 embryonic stem cell lines (lacking ATG5, the E3 ubiquitin ligase essential for autophagosome elongation). This replication deficiency reversed in the presence of an ATG5-expressing plasmid [29] . However, other studies showed that MHV and SARS-CoV replication does not require an intact autophagy pathway [38, 39] . Similar results were also observed in IBV infection, where induction or inhibition of autophagy did not affect replication, suggesting that classical autophagy may not be important for its life cycle [40] . However, a recent study shows that TGEV infection activates autophagy, which subsequently inhibits further TGEV infection [36] . As it is possible that replication mechanisms differ among viruses of the same family, further in-depth study is needed to confirm PDCoV infection-associated autophagy and identify the impact of autophagy on viral replication. The protein blots were quantified by the Image J software. The ratio of LC3-II to \u03b2-actin and the ratio of p62 to \u03b2-actin from three independent experiments were expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD); **p < 0.01, calculated using Student's t-test.",
