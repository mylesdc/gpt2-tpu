In an attempt to understand the evolution of PEDV in the United States and possibly develop a control strategy, we compared the genome sequences of a PEDV strain isolated from an infected piglet against its in vitro adapted version. The original PEDV strain was grown in Vero cells and passed 10 times serially in a MARC145 cell line. The sequence analysis of the native PEDV strain and in vitro passaged virus shows that the cell culture adaptation specifically modifies PEDV spike protein whereas the open reading frame 1a/b (ORF1a/b)-encoded polyprotein, the nucleoprotein, NS3B (ORF3), and membrane and envelope proteins remain unchanged.",

The total viral RNA was extracted by TRIzol LS reagent and sequenced by Sanger dideoxy sequencing using a primer walking technique. The raw sequences were imported into the Geneious assembler (Biomatters, CA), assembled, annotated, and compared against each other using USA/Colorado/2013 (GenBank accession no.

In contrast, the spike gene contains six nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms, resulting in amino acid (aa) substitutions in the following positions: 375 (F\u00a1L), 486 (T\u00a1P), 856 (D\u00a1E), 1081 (A\u00a1V), 1099 (A\u00a1S), and 1253 (Y\u00a1D). The S1 domain of spike protein contains 2 aa substitutions, whereas the S2 domain contains 4 aa substitutions. PEDV has been shown to use porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN) as the major receptor for cell entry (4, 5) . However, Vero and MARC145 cells lack pAPN, clearly indicating that other receptors or receptor-independent pathways may be used for entry (6) . The spike protein in its trimeric conformation interacts with the cell receptor and contains numerous neutralizing antibody binding epitopes (7) . Analysis of the spike by PeptideCutter (http://web.expasy.org/ peptide_cutter/) shows that the native spike protein of NPL-PEDV/2013 has 63 trypsin and 2 chymotrypsin cleavage sites at 100% efficiency whereas NPL-PEDV/2013/P10 has lost one trypsin cleavage site but the number of chymotrypsin sites remain unchanged. This indicates that cell culture adaptation specifically modifies the PEDV spike protein; however, the immunological implications are unknown.",
