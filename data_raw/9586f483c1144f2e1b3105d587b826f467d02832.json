With nuclear actin polymerization implicated in ever-expanding biological processes and the discovery of the nuclear import mechanisms of actin and NPFs, determining Arp2/3 nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling mechanism is important for understanding the function of nuclear actin. A unique feature of alphabaculovirus infection of insect cells is the robust nuclear accumulation of Arp2/3, which induces actin polymerization in the nucleus to assist in virus replication. We found that Ac34, a viral late gene product encoded by the alphabaculovirus Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV), is involved in Arp2/3 nuclear accumulation during virus infection. Further assays revealed that the subcellular distribution of Arp2/3 under steady-state conditions is controlled by chromosomal maintenance 1 (CRM1)-dependent nuclear export. Upon AcMNPV infection, Ac34 inhibits CRM1 pathway and leads to Arp2/3 retention in the nucleus.",

To investigate how AcMNPV accumulates Arp2/3, the central regulator of actin polymerization, in the nucleus, we cloned the cDNA sequences of Arp2/3 subunits from Sf9 cells, a commercially available Spodoptera frugiperda cell line commonly used for baculovirus infection (GenBank Accession: KJ187399.1, JQ364941.1, KJ187400.1, GU356595.1, KJ187401.1, KJ187402.1) [34] . Here, P40 was selected to represent Arp2/3 because P40 appeared to be the most abundant protein detected by either Western blot or fluorescence microscopy (Arp2 and P20 were less abundant than P40; Arp2 could only be detected by Western blot; other subunits were barely detected by Western blot or fluorescence microscopy when transiently expressed in Sf9 cells). We prepared plasmid-based expression constructs encoding P40 tagged with a V 5 epitope (P40-V 5 ) at its C-terminus or P40 fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein at its N-terminus (EGFP-P40) to monitor the Arp2/3 dynamics during AcMNPV infection.",

During the late phase of infection (After 12 hpi), AcMNPV infection resulted in detectable P40 accumulation in the nucleus in the absence of APH, suggesting that viral late gene products may play an important role in P40 nuclear accumulation. When the expression of viral late genes was shut off by APH, P40 failed to accumulate in the nucleus, as demonstrated by both immunofluorescence microscopy and cell fractionation assays ( Fig 1D) .

Based on this scenario and the fact that Ac34 is present in the nucleus (Fig 2A and  2B ), we were prompted to explore whether P40 nuclear accumulation is also correlated to the presence of Ac34 in the nucleus. distribution. EGFP-P40 was expressed in mock-infected Sf9 cells or cells infected with vAc polh (MOI = 2), a bacmid derived from the AcMNPV genome with an inserted polyhedrin open reading frame (ORF). At 48 hpt, the cells were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. (C). EGFP-P40 associates with Arp2 and P20. EGFP (approx. 27 kDa) or EGFP-P40 (approx. 69 kDa) was co-expressed with Arp2-Ha (approx. 46 kDa) or P20-Ha (approx. 21 kDa) in Sf9 cells, respectively. At 48 hpt, the cells were harvested and subjected to a co-IP assay using anti-Ha. The immunoprecipitated proteins and the WCL were separated by SDS-PAGE and probed with anti-Ha and anti-EGFP. (D). AcMNPV late gene products induce P40 nuclear accumulation in the late infection phase. Sf9 cells transfected with the P40-V 5 encoding plasmid were either mock infected or infected with vAc egfp (MOI = 2) in the presence or absence of APH. The cells were fixed at 6, 12 and 24 hpi or harvested for fractionation and further treated as described in (A). Scale bar: 20 \u03bcm; Scale bar in the zoomed panel: 10 \u03bcm. A series of mCherry-fusedC-terminal and N-terminal Ac34 truncations (S1C Fig) was prepared to identify the sequence responsible for Ac34 nuclear localization. Fluorescence microscopy demonstrated that the removal of amino acids (aa) 195-215 of Ac34 (mC-Ac34 ) resulted in the cytoplasmic localization of Ac34 (Fig 3) , which is in sharp contrast to the full-length Ac34 (mC-Ac34) and all the tested N-terminal Ac34 truncations, which exhibited a predominantly nuclear localization pattern (S3 Fig) . This phenotype indicated that the aa 195-215 region plays a major role in determining the presence of Ac34 in the nucleus, although sequence analysis did not show any classic NLS pattern (tandem repeats of lysine and arginine) within this region. Notably, when the C-terminal truncation of Ac34 was extended to aa 75 or further (mC-Ac34 1-75 and mC-Ac34 1-55 ), a diffuse cellular distribution of Ac34 was observed (Fig 3) , which could be attributed to free nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of the resulting low-molecular-mass polypeptides.",

Viral manipulation of cellular the nucleo-cytoplasmic transport of proteins has been extensively documented in recent years (reviewed in [42] ), in particular in cardioviruses and enteroviruses. Cardioviruses use their leader proteins to induce the hyper-phosphorylation of nucleoporins and disrupt the RanGTP gradient [43, 44] , thus inducing an efflux of the nuclear proteins required for viral replication and leading to interferon suppression. Enterovirus infection results in cellular protein retention in the cytoplasm via the degradation of nucleoporins mediated by the virus-encoded proteases 2A and 3C [45] [46] [47] . Other viruses, such as herpes simplex virus [48] , human papillomavirus [49, 50] , severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [51] , Ebola virus [52] , and measles virus [53] , employ a variety of methods to interfere with the nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of cellular proteins, therefore facilitating viral replication and escape from the host anti-viral immune response.",

AcMNPV contains 156 predicted ORFs at least 50 aa in length. Aside from a limited number of exceptions, the nuclear import mechanisms of most viral and cellular proteins during AcMNPV infection remain unknown. Currently, at least 7 exportins have been identified in eukaryotic cells [8, 32, [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] . Unlike other exportins that only transport highly specialized cargoes (Reviewer in [59] ), CRM1 mediates the nuclear export of many NES-bearing proteins, and its dysfunction leads to the nuclear accumulation of these proteins. Based on bioinformatics prediction (NetNES, http://www.cbs. dtu.dk/services/NetNES/) [60] , 98 AcMNPV proteins contain putative residues that could serve as a NES (S2 Table) . Such a high percentage of viral proteins bearing putative NESs implies that CRM1-dependent nuclear export may determine the subcellular distribution of many viral proteins, and the inhibition of CRM1-dependent nuclear export by Ac34 could possibly play a key role in the AcMNPV-induced nuclear accumulation of proteins. Whether Ac34 also influences other exportins or these exportins also contribute to the virus-induced protein nuclear accumulation remain to be explored.",

            "text": "Ac34 homologues are presented in all sequenced alphabaculoviruses but absent in betabaculoviruses [61] . Alphabaculoviruses and betabaculovirusesbehave in significantly different ways. In respect to cytopathology, alphabaculoviruses assemble their nucleocapsid in the nucleus, whereas betabaculovirusesinduce nuclear membrane rupture, and nucleocapsid assembly occurs in a combination of the cytoplasm and the nucleoplasm [62] . This cytopathologic difference suggests that unlike alphabaculoviruses, betabaculoviruses do not need to accumulate the cytoplasmic actin polymerization machinery to the nucleus. As a consequence, betabaculoviruses do not need a viral protein or mechanism to induce nuclear accumulation of Arp2/3 (although only P40 and P20 were proved to be retained in the nucleus of AcMNPV-infected cells in this study, both Arp2/ 3 components behave in a similar way upon virus infection), which is supported by the evidence that Ac34 homologues are absent in the genomes of betabaculoviruses [61] . Nuclear G-actin is required for the transcriptional activity of RNA polymerases [63] [64] [65] and the epigenetic activation of chromatin (Reviewed in [5, 66] ). Among the three key actin polymerization elements that are accumulated in the nucleus during AcMNPV infection, only Gactin is recruited to the nucleus by early viral gene products [29, 30] . This early nuclear accumulation of G-actin could increase the nuclear G-actin pool and promote the transcription of viral early genes that are transcribed by host RNA polymerase II [61] . Late in infection, P78/83 and Arp2/3 accumulate in the nucleus and induce nuclear actin polymerization that converts G-actin to F-actin. The resulting nuclear G-actin pool depletion could lead to the loss of the transcriptional activity of host RNA polymerases and the epigenetic reprogramming of host chromatin towards transcriptional inhibition, which could contribute to the host gene transcription shutoff that occurs in the late phase of baculovirus infection [67, 68] . Consistent with this, cytochalasin D, a chemical that specifically prevents actin polymerization, behaves as an antagonist of the virus-induced shutdown of host gene expression [69] . In this respect, nuclear actin polymerization induced by baculovirus infection may also participate in the regulation of host/virus gene expression by the modulation of the nuclear G-actin pool, in addition to its role in assisting viral nucleocapsid assembly and transport, which has long been recognized.",
