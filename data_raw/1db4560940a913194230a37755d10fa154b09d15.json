            "text": "Background: Chickens are susceptible to infection with a limited number of Influenza A viruses and are a potential source of a human influenza pandemic. In particular, H5 and H7 haemagglutinin subtypes can evolve from low to highly pathogenic strains in gallinaceous poultry. Ducks on the other hand are a natural reservoir for these viruses and are able to withstand most avian influenza strains. Results: Transcriptomic sequencing of lung and ileum tissue samples from birds infected with high (H5N1) and low (H5N2) pathogenic influenza viruses has allowed us to compare the early host response to these infections in both these species. Chickens (but not ducks) lack the intracellular receptor for viral ssRNA, RIG-I and the gene for an important RIG-I binding protein, RNF135. These differences in gene content partly explain the differences in host responses to low pathogenic and highly pathogenic avian influenza virus in chicken and ducks. We reveal very different patterns of expression of members of the interferon-induced transmembrane protein (IFITM) gene family in ducks and chickens. In ducks, IFITM1, 2 and 3 are strongly up regulated in response to highly pathogenic avian influenza, where little response is seen in chickens. Clustering of gene expression profiles suggests IFITM1 and 2 have an anti-viral response and IFITM3 may restrict avian influenza virus through cell membrane fusion. We also show, through molecular phylogenetic analyses, that avian IFITM1 and IFITM3 genes have been subject to both episodic and pervasive positive selection at specific codons. In particular, avian IFITM1 showed evidence of positive selection in the duck lineage at sites known to restrict influenza virus infection. Conclusions: Taken together these results support a model where the IFITM123 protein family and RIG-I all play a crucial role in the tolerance of ducks to highly pathogenic and low pathogenic strains of avian influenza viruses when compared to the chicken.",

            "text": "The question of how ducks can survive challenge by all low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) and most highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) infections, yet chickens can only survive LPAI, remains an important question due to the economic losses experienced by the poultry industry, the human health implications and the continuing threat of pandemic disease posed by avian viruses. Most avian influenza strains are able to infect and replicate in ducks, and are usually asymptomatic and seldom cause disease. Of the 16 haemagglutinin subtypes of influenza viruses infecting migratory waterfowl, the H5 and H7 subtypes are unique. After transmission to gallinaceous poultry the H5 and H7 viruses can evolve into highly pathogenic strains. In ducks and other aquatic birds the low pathogenic H5 and H7 influenza viruses replicate predominantly in the intestinal tract without any outward clinical signs of infection. After transmission to gallinaceous poultry and acquisition of multiple basic amino acids in the connecting peptide of the haemagglutinin, the viruses become highly pathogenic and replicate systemically in the chicken [1] . HPAI has proven to be deadly to chickens within a very short time frame post-infection, although LPAI only produces mild or no signs of clinical disease [2] . Ducks on the other hand are able to mount a robust inflammatory response against most HPAI [3] , although they have shown increased susceptibility to some emerging strains of H5N1, with death resulting in some cases [4] [5] [6] . The difference in pathogenesis seen between ducks and chickens could also be due to the fact that a rapid induction of apoptosis in HPAI-infected ducks may be beneficial to the host, whereas delayed apoptosis in chickens may be an advantage for the virus [7] .",

It is known that birds have a much more compact set of immune-related genes than mammals [13, 14] . With the increasing availability of avian genome sequences, it is also becoming apparent that key genes are reportedly missing in some birds, which will affect their host responses to viral infections. These include Toll-like receptors 8 and 9 (TLR8 and TLR9) that, in humans, recognize ssRNA and CpG, respectively [15, 16] . Interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15), interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and TNF\u03b1 are all genes which have not yet been identified in birds [17] . When we compare the genomes of chickens and ducks we can also see differences in their immune gene complement. Crucially, chickens (but not ducks) appear to be lacking the intracellular receptor for viral ssRNA, RIG-I (also called DDX58) [18] and the gene for an important RIG-I binding protein, RNF135 [17] . These differences may also partly explain the differences seen between chickens and ducks in their responses towards avian influenza infections [17] .",

Although exactly how they function has not been fully elucidated, IFITM proteins have been found to be enriched in late endosomes and lysosomes and are thought to act before viral membrane fusion occurs [24] . Human IFITM3 has been shown to block viral entry into the host cell [25] , with a requirement of the CD225 domain for inhibition of the influenza virus [26] . Until now, most of these genes remained unannotated in the chicken and duck genomes and their role in avian influenza infections was unknown.",

In this study we examine and compare the expression of innate immune related genes in chickens and ducks after infection with both LPAI (H5N2) and HPAI (H5N1); these being avian species showing high (usually leading to death) and low susceptibility (mostly asymptomatic), respectively. We looked at the host immune response and viral replication in the ileum and lung 1 and 3 days post infection (dpi). HPAI viruses replicate primarily in the respiratory tract prior to systemic spread with generalized replication and death, while low pathogenic viruses replicate primarily in the intestinal tract and to a limited extent in the respiratory tract with no apparent disease signs [27] . Dramatic differences in host responses to avian influenza infection were found in chickens and ducks. In ducks IFITM1, 2 and 3 are strongly up regulated in response to HPAI virus, where little response is seen in chickens. Clustering of gene expression profiles suggests IFITM1 and 2 have an anti-viral response and IFITM3 may act before viral membrane fusion occurs and thus blocks viral entry. We also show through molecular phylogenetic analyses that avian IFITM1 and 3 genes have been subject to both episodic and pervasive positive selection at specific codons. Specifically, avian IFITM1 shows evidence of positive selection in the duck lineage at a site known to restrict avian influenza virus (AIV) infection. Overexpression of this gene in vitro has been shown to increase the resistance of avian cells to AIV infection [28] , probably by a block in membrane fusion, crucial to the entry and further replication of this virus. Taken together these results support a model where the IFITM123 family and RIG-I play a crucial role in the tolerance of ducks to high and low pathogenic strains of avian influenza viruses when compared to the chicken and other Galliformes.",

            "text": "Using conservation of gene order we were able to define 1:1 orthologs between the avian and mammalian IR-IFITM gene cluster, and the IFITM5 and 10 genes. These three groups of IFITM sequences were used to create a multiple sequence alignment (Additional file 4: Figure S2 ) and in the construction of a phylogenetic gene tree (Additional file 5: Figure S3 ). As expected, the IFITM5 and 10 genes cluster into distinct clades in birds, other non-avian reptiles, mammals and amphibians but the picture for the IR-IFITM gene family was more complex. In birds, the three IR-IFITM genes cluster into three distinct groups of IFITM1, 2 and 3 sequences. In mammals, however the genes tend to cluster together within their own species or clades, indicating more recent clade-specific gene expansions, as shown before by Zhang et al. [22] making it impossible to define 1:1 orthologs between avian and mammalian IFITM1, 2 and 3-like genes. In an attempt to resolve this issue and define the gene duplication events that gave rise to this family, we prepared a multiple sequence alignment of the IR-IFITM protein family. To increase the power of our analysis we collected IFITM1, 2 and 3-like peptide sequences from a wide range of vertebrates including birds, non-avian reptiles, mammals and amphibians. After multiple sequence alignment (MSA) using MUSCLE, we removed partial, duplicated or highly divergent (likely to be sequencing errors or incorrect spliced products) peptide sequences, after which 148 peptide sequences remained in the final multiple sequence alignment (Additional file 6: Figure S4 ). MrBayes, a Bayesian package for inference [29, 30] , was used to infer phylogenetic trees from the MSA of IFITM1/2/3-like peptide sequences (Fig. 1 ). There appeared to be a single clade of IFITM1like genes in the amphibians (Xenopus species), which suggested an independent origin from birds and mammals. The Xenopus sequences were therefore used to root the gene tree. The tree showed strong support for independent IFITM gene duplications in mammals and reptiles. In mammals, as Zhang et al. [22] have shown previously, there were a number of clade-specific expansions of this gene family. However in birds, there were only two gene duplications that gave rise to the avian IFITM1, 2 and 3 genes. The IFITM2 and 3 genes appear to have arisen from an avian-specific gene duplication, with only a single IFITM2/3-like gene in nonavian reptiles. The IFITM1 gene appears to have arisen from an earlier gene duplication in all reptiles. This Bayesian analysis was supported by similar analyses based on Maximum Likelihood, Neighbour-Joining and Parsimony methods, as implemented in the MEGA6 package (Additional file 7: Figure S5 ) using the JTT + G_I model predicted as the most likely substitution model (Additional file 8: Table S3 ). These results also show that the structure and function of the avian IFITM123 protein family is most likely to share ",

            "text": "In mammals, it is known that the IFITM5 and 10 genes are highly conserved and the genes of the IR-IFITM gene cluster are more divergent and predicted to be under positive selection [22] . We used methods implemented in DATAMONKEY [31] and CODEML to investigate whether positive selection has also driven the evolution of the avian IFITM gene family. Gene conversion was found in some mammals under species-specific duplication, including dog, cow, horse, etc. [22] . These sequences were removed from all subsequent analyses. No gene conversion was found in the avian IFITM gene family members [22] . MEME was used to seek evidence of positive selection at sites in the coding sequences of the IFITM gene family (Table 1) . MEME is a method implemented within the DATAMONKEY package [32] that can identify both episodic and persistent positive selection because it allows the distribution of the dN/dS ratio to vary from site to site and from branch to branch at a site. In birds, only two genes -IFITM1 and 3 show sites with strong evidence of positive selection. For IFITM1, most sites (6 codons) were found in the second transmembrane domain (TM2). In addition, one site was found in each of the N-(codon 30) and C-(codon 135) termini of the IFITM1 peptide. Only two sites (codons 106 and 112) were predicted to show persistent positive selection in all avian branches. Most sites showed evidence of episodic positive selection in one (codon 30 ANAPL at a site known to restrict influenza viruses [26] , codon 100 PHALE and codon 117 CALAN) or a few species (codons 102, 118 and 135). These results were supported by FUBAR [33] , which detected persistent sites of positive selection at codons 106, 112, 118 and 135, also detected by MEME (Additional file 9: Table  S4 ). No significant sites were found using CODEML for IFITM1 (Additional file 10: Table S5 ), suggesting most were episodic sites. The other gene, IFITM3, was predicted to have fewer positively selected sites (only 3 codons), in one (codon 98 APTFO and codon 136 CUCCA) or more species (codon 119). Again, the transmembrane TM2 domain contained most sites (2/3 of cases). CODEML predicted two additional sites of persistent positive selection in both IFITM3 and 10 (2 in the N-terminus) (Additional file 10: Table S5 ). These results suggest that the TM2 domain is likely to be important in recognition of pathogen-associated lipids. Of great interest was positive selection at codon 30 (Thr -> Pro) in ducks, at a site known to restrict influenza viruses [26] .",

This not only allowed us to determine the profile of IFITM gene expression, but also defined the host innate immune response after influenza infection in each species and allowed a comparison between species to be made. Since LPAI viruses from ducks are the ultimate source of HPAI viruses in chickens we used a LPAI H5N2 and a HPAI H5N1 strain to examine the host response to each class of influenza virus. This study involved the use of two different tissues known to be targets of viral infection (lung and ileum) in three different conditions (uninfected control or infected with either LPAI H5N2 or HPAI H5N1) at two different time points (1 dpi and 3 dpi), which would allow us to study the host response in each species. Differential expression of Table 1 Positively selected sites in IR-IFITM genes detected using MEME method implemented in DATAMONKEY This summary table reports the distribution of synonymous (\u03b1) and non-synonymous (\u03b2) substitution rates over sites inferred by the MEME model, where the proportion of branches with \u03b2 > \u03b1 is significantly greater than 0; p-value is derived using a mixture of \u03c72 distributions, **p-value < 0.01; *p-value < 0.05 genes was thus determined for 12 different experimental scenarios in each of duck and chicken, as outlined in Table 2 , with the main interest being on the differences that would be seen between duck and chicken.

This response against H5N1 is not reflected in the lung. The highly pathogenic H5N1 appears to prove too much for the chicken -the response seen early in the ileum is not sustained, and the birds succumb to the disease. A strong response is seen in the lung by 3 dpi, after H5N2 infection. The ileum is not particularly affected by H5N2 infection and the robust response seen in the lung is obviously able to counter the effects of the virus, stop further spread, and the chicken is able to survive the LPAI infection.",

This reflects how ducks are unperturbed by LPAI infection and suggests they may be able to somehow block the virus before it enters the cell. Upon infection with H5N1, the duck mounts a robust innate response, with large numbers of genes significantly differentially expressed in both lung and ileum. The response in the ileum increases from 1 to 3 dpi whereas in the lung, a large response is already underway 1 dpi and is maintained through 3 dpi.

We have previously shown TLR1LA to be activated during the host response to Marek's Disease Virus [39] . Levels of TLR4 are increased by heat shock proteins and various cellular factors produced during infection, while the ligand for TLR7 is ssRNA, of which the H5N1 genome is comprised. IRF, IL8, IL10 and IL17A signalling are all also up-regulated, indicating a robust cytokine response ( Fig. 3a and b) . Some of the most highly up-regulated genes seen during the duck host response to H5N1 include RSAD2 (viperin) which encodes an interferon-inducible antiviral protein involved in TLR7-dependent production of IFNB, MX1 which is known to have antiviral activity against avian influenza and DDX58 (RIG-I) which encodes a pattern recognition Fig. 3 Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of the duck response to HPAI infection in the ileum at 1 dpi and in the lung at 3 dpi. a Biological pathways which are significantly altered during the host response to HPAI in the ileum at 1dpi. b Biological pathways which are significantly altered during the host response to HPAI in the lung at 3dpi.

In chicken there is a very limited IFITM response.

In response to low path infection, the duck increases expression of both IFITM1 and 2 (~3-fold) in both lung and ileum. An early response at 1 dpi is obviously sufficient, with expression seen to diminish by 3 dpi. The duck is also clearly able to raise a strong interferon response against the highly pathogenic virus, with large increases in expression seen from IFITM1 and 2 in both lung and ileum.

Large differences in IFITM expression were confirmed, with virtually no response in the chicken and significant up-regulation in the duck (Table 4 and Fig. 5 ).

Avian IFITM1 and 2 were seen to cluster with genes highly enriched with roles in antiviral responses (Additional file 20: Table S9 ) while IFITM3 was very different and clustered with genes involved with organelle membranes and apoptotic processes (Additional file 21: Table S10 ).

Multiple amino acid sequence alignments of the proteins encoded by these avian IFITM1 and 3 genes reveals a number of conserved motifs, shown to be functional in the homologous regions of the human IR-IFITM proteins (Fig. 7) . All these proteins share the highly conserved TM1-CIL-TM2 structure, core to the IFITM protein family. The TM1-CIL or CD225 domain is the most conserved region.

The chicken immune system is able to counter LPAI H5N2, but unable to respond effectively to the HPAI H5N1. B-and T-cells are induced in response to H5N2, but an initial early immune response in the ileum against H5N1 is ultimately insufficient to clear the virus and the animal succumbs to infection. The response seen in the ileum primarily involves lipid metabolism genes. The duck, on the other hand, is barely required to produce a response against H5N2 since LPAI is not seen as pathogenic and is able to initiate a robust host response to H5N1 infection. A strong cytokine response along with induction of the TLR and RIG-I pathways ensure that the duck is able to survive or delay infection with the more pathogenic H5N1 virus. RIG-I is involved in the initial cytosolic detection of virus in the host cell and TLRs are responsible for the induction of signalling cascades leading to the production of type-I interferons. When the chicken response to H5N2 was compared to the H5N1 response in the duck, two unique host-specific responses were seen. Enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes showed that genes involved in protein binding and various immune-associated processes were highly represented in the duck. The duck host response to H5N1 also showed the down-regulation of many genes involved with metabolic systems and metal-ion binding. In the chicken ileum response to H5N1 at 1 dpi, many genes involved in lipid metabolism and binding are also up-regulated, while neuronal-associated genes were notably down-regulated. The effect on neural processes during influenza infection has been reported in recent studies [36] [37] [38] . Analysis of the presence of transcription factor binding sites amongst down-regulated genes highlighted an enrichment of genes with binding sites for ELF1 (implicated in T-cell responses and lipid metabolism) and ETV4 (involved in B-cell responses) in chicken.",

IFITM1, 2 and 3-like proteins are already known to have anti- Fig. 6 Co-expression clusters associated with the duck IFITM1, 2 and 3 genes. a IFITM1 and 2 gene expression cluster, b IFITM1 and 2 network, c IFITM3 gene expression cluster, d IFITM3 network. The gene expression clusters were calculated using CLUSTERGRAM and normalised data from all the RNAseq datasets. The gene networks were calculated using IPA analysis of the genes that were clustered with expression of IFITM genes in a and c viral function in mammals [23] , with IFITM3 specifically shown to restrict the effects of influenza in a mouse knockout model [20] . The sequence data presented in this study was therefore used to determine their activity in birds. A recent report by Smith et al. [28] demonstrates that over-expression of chicken IFITM1 (annotated as chI-FITM3 in that study) restricts influenza in vitro. We show that in vivo chickens mount a nearly non-existent IFITM response, with an ineffectual early induction of IFITM3 in the ileum against H5N1 infection, which is not maintained. Conversely, the duck is able to mount and sustain an effective induction of IFITM1, 2 and 3 in both the lung and ileum during H5N1 progression. Chickens are seen to show an early up-regulation of lipid metabolism genes in the ileum against HPAI. This is most likely a reflection of the viral/host membrane fusion and subsequent viral replication which is occurring. This lipid response is not seen in the duck. IFITM1, 2 and 3 have been shown to block viral membrane hemifusion (when the outer membranes of the two lipid bilayers have fused but the inner membranes are still intact). The IFITM proteins alter the lipid composition of the membrane and decrease membrane fluidity, thus restricting viral fusion [44] . So, the differential response of lipid-associated genes seen between chicken and duck is most probably due, in part, to the hugely different IFITM response seen between these two species.",

In some cases 5'-RACE was used to determine the full coding sequence from total RNA isolated from spleen tissues. 5'-RACE was performed on 10 \u03bcg of duck spleen total RNA using the First Choice RLM-RACE kit (Invitrogen).

Multiple sequence alignments were performed using MUSCLE [56] . Bayesian inference trees were reconstructed using MrBayes v3.2.2 [57] . Peptide sequences of IFITM1, 2 and 3 proteins were analysed, set with priors (prset aamodelpr = mixed) and substitution model (lset rates = invgamma Ngammacat = 8). Four independent Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) chains were used with the temperature of 0.2. Two repetitions were run for 1,000,000 generations with tree and parameter sampling occurring every 1,000 generations. The first 25 % of trees were discarded as burn-in, leaving 750 trees per run. Posterior probabilities for internal node were calculated from the posterior density of trees. To confirm the general conclusions from MrBayes analysis we also used Maximum parsimony (MP), Neighbour-Joining (NJ) and Maximum likelihood (ML) to reconstruct trees with bootstrap values of 500 repetitions within the MEGA6 package [58] . Phylogenetic trees were displayed using FigTree [59] .",

            "text": "First we used two methods implemented in DATA-MONKEY [60] for detecting positive selection: the \"Mixed Effects Model of Evolution\" (MEME) and the \"Fast Unbiased Bayesian Approximation\" (FUBAR). MEME can find evidence of both episodic and pervasive positive selection at individual codons, even when the majority of branches are subject to purifying selection. FUBAR on the other hand was designed to detect pervasive positive selection at individual codons. Therefore the additional sites detected by MEME and not by FUBAR are likely to have been subject to episodes of positive selection. For these analyses the best fitting nucleotide substitution model was determined through the automatic model selection tool available on the server. To investigate whether gene conversion occurred in avian IFITM genes all sequences were screened for recombination using GARD implemented within the DATAMONKEY server. No evidence of recombination was found in these avian sequences. We also compared the results from DATAMONKEY with two alternative models implemented in CODEML (PAML 4.4) [61] : M8, which allows for codons to evolve under positive selection (dN/dS > 1) and M8A, which does not (dN/dS \u2264 1). These two nested models were compared using a likelihood ratio test (LRT) with two degrees of freedom. The analysis was run several times with the F3x4 model of codon frequencies. Codons under positive selection for model M8 were identified using a Bayes Empirical Bayes (BEB) approach and considering a posterior probability of > 95 %. For each analysis the species tree used was based on a new phylogenetic tree of birds based on evidence from the multiple sequence alignment of 48 avian genomes [62] as part of the \"Bird Phylogenomic Project\", hosted by the Beijing Genomics Institute [55] .

The Illumina Genome Analyzer-IIx platform generated millions of RNAseq tags per sample (255 million in total for chicken, 286 million for duck), each 36 nucleotides in length.

Based on this pipeline, 231 million tags were mapped to the chicken genome, 151 million of which were annotated to known genes in the chicken (65 %). 239 million duck sequence tags could be mapped to the duck genome, 133 million of which were annotated to known genes in the duck (56 %).

Normalised expression data from control samples were compared with infected samples to examine the host response to AIV infection. Enrichment of particular GO terms or TFBS within clusters was done by using the TANGO and PRIMA algorithms, respectively, within the Expander package.

Branches corresponding to partitions reproduced in less than 50 % bootstrap replicates are collapsed. The percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test (1000 replicates) are shown next to the branches. Initial tree(s) for the heuristic search were obtained automatically by applying Neighbor-Join and BioNJ algorithms to a matrix of pairwise distances estimated using a JTT model, and then selecting the topology with superior log likelihood value. A discrete Gamma distribution was used to model evolutionary rate differences among sites (5 categories (+G, parameter = 3.0096)). The analysis involved 205 amino acid sequences. All positions with less than 95 % site coverage were eliminated. That is, fewer than 5 % alignment gaps, missing data, and ambiguous bases were allowed at any position.
