Acidic genital secretions of HIV-1-infected women contain HIV-1 likely coated by antibody. We found that the combination of acidic pH and Env-specific IgG, including that from cervicovaginal and seminal fluids of HIV-1-infected individuals, augmented transcytosis across epithelial cells as much as 20-fold compared with Env-specific IgG at neutral pH or non-specific IgG at either pH. Enhanced transcytosis was observed with clinical HIV-1 isolates, including transmitted/ founder strains, and was eliminated in Fc neonatal receptor (FcRn)-knockdown epithelial cells. Non-neutralizing antibodies allowed similar or less transcytosis than neutralizing antibodies. However, the ratio of total:infectious virus was higher for neutralizing antibodies, indicating that they allowed transcytosis while blocking infectivity of transcytosed virus. Immunocytochemistry revealed abundant FcRn expression in columnar epithelia lining the human endocervix and penile urethra. Acidity and Env-specific IgG enhance transcytosis of virus across epithelial cells via FcRn and could facilitate translocation of virus to susceptible target cells following sexual exposure.",

Sexually transmitted infections, other causes of inflammation, and localized trauma may allow susceptible CD4+ target cells at skin or mucosal surfaces to become directly exposed to secretions from infected sexual partners [1, 2] . However, when skin and mucosa are intact, it remains unclear precisely how HIV-1 gains access to target cells. One possibility is that virus translocates between epithelial cells until susceptible cells are found either in or below the epithelium [3] . Alternatively, Langerhans cells may sample the surface, acquire virus, and move it to areas of abundant target cells [4, 5] . Finally, transcytosis of HIV-1 (i.e., movement through cells) has been studied as a potential mechanism to translocate virus from mucosal surfaces to deeperlying CD4+ cells [6, 7, 8] .",

Such a role is made particularly plausible by the reported expression of the Fc neonatal receptor (FcRn) in human genital mucosal tissue [19] . FcRn is a heterodimeric receptor belonging to the MHC class I family of proteins [20, 21] . The expression of FcRn in endothelial cells is thought to be critical for IgG homeostasis in blood [22] , and its expression in placental syncytiotrophoblasts is a key factor in transporting maternal IgG to the fetal circulation [23] . A characteristic of FcRn is its ability to bind the Fc region of IgG at acidic pH and to release it at neutral pH [24] . This pH-dependent binding allows the transport of intact IgG or of IgG immune complexes from luminal surfaces bathed in acidic fluids, for example, cervicovaginal secretions, to basolateral surfaces exposed to a neutral intracellular milieu [19] .",

Virus was quantified in the medium bathing the basolateral cell surface (''subnatant fluid'') by RT-PCR and, although detectable as early as six hours after exposure of virus to the apical cell surface, the quantity was greater at 12 hours ( Figure S1 ) [8] . Thus, in subsequent experiments, transcytosis was measured at 12 hours. Using HIV-1 US712 , a clade B R5 clinical isolate, HIVIG enhanced transcytosis in a dose-dependent manner when virus and antibody were exposed to the apical surface at pH 6.0 ( Figure 1A) . There was no increase in transcytosis with HIVIG at pH 7.4 or with HIV-negative IgG (IVIG) at pH 6.0 or 7.4. We found similarly enhanced transcytosis using additional R5 as well as X4 and X4/ R5 strains ( Figure 1B) . Importantly, transcytosis of four of five clade C transmitted/founder Env-pseudotyped viruses was enhanced in a pH and antibody-dependent manner ( Figure 1C ). Enhanced transcytosis with HIV-1-specific antibody at low pH also occurred with T84 colon carcinoma cells ( Figure S2 ).",

Since cervicovaginal fluid is acidic and HIV-1 in cervicovaginal fluid is likely coated with antibodies, we explored the effect of low pH and HIV-1-specific antibodies on transcytosis, the movement of HIV-1 across tight-junctioned epithelial cells. We found that the combination of HIV-1-specific antibodies and low pH enhanced transcytosis as much as 20-fold. Virus that underwent transcytosis under these conditions was infectious, and infectivity was highly influenced by whether or not the antibody neutralized the virus. We observed enhanced transcytosis using antibody from cervicovaginal and seminal fluids and using transmitted/ founder strains of HIV-1. We also found that the enhanced transcytosis was due to the Fc neonatal receptor (FcRn), which binds immune complexes at acidic pH and releases them at neutral pH. Finally, staining of human tissue revealed abundant FcRn expression on columnar epithelial cells of penile urethra and endocervix. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism wherein HIV-1 may facilitate its own transmission by usurping the antibody response directed against itself. These results have important implications for HIV vaccine development and for understanding the earliest events in HIV transmission.",

Consistent with other investigations of Fc-FcRn interactions, maximally enhanced transcytosis occurred at pH 5.5-6.0, with some enhanced transcytosis apparent at pH 4.5 and 6.5 ( Figure S3H ) [38, 39] . Since FcRn binds to IgG and not to IgA, we compared two different IgG1 mAbs, b12 and HGN194, with their IgA class-switched versions. Both IgG1 mAbs enhanced transcytosis of HIV-1 JRFL pseudoviruses and SHIV 1157ipEL-p at pH 6.0, whereas the IgA class-switched versions did not ( Figure 2C and 2D).

This difference may be due to the contribution of fluid phase uptake of IgG by the epithelial cells at both pH 6.0 and pH 7.4; IgG thus internalized can engage FcRn in acidic endosomes and be shuttled to the basolateral side of the cells [41] .

Both poorly neutralizing antibodies (HIVIG and mAbs b6 and F240; Figure 3A ) and neutralizing mAbs (4E10, 2F5, 2G12, VRC01, and b12; Figure 3B ) enhanced transcytosis at pH 6.0.

At pH 6.0, all Env-specific mAbs and HIVIG mediated transcytosis of virus that infected TZM-bl cells ( Figure 3C and D). However, there was a strong correlation between the amount of transcytosed infectious virus and the neutralizing activity (IC 50 ) of the antibody that mediated the transcytosis (Spearman's rho = 0.86; p = 0.001). Virus whose transcytosis was mediated by poorly neutralizing antibodies HIVIG, F240 and b6, at least at concentrations of 100 and 50 mg/ml, was more infectious than virus which crossed the epithelial cells in a non-FcRn-dependent manner (i.e., in the presence of Den3 control mAb) (Fig. 3C) . Conversely, transcytosis mediated by antibodies with the lowest IC 50 s, such as VRC01 and b12, resulted in less infectious virus than was observed with the Den3 control antibody ( Figure 3D ). Thus, strong binding activity results in more FcRn-dependent transcytosis, whereas strong neutralizing activity renders the transcytosed virus less infectious.",

The ability of genital tract IgG to mediate transcytosis correlated strongly with infectious virus capture activity by the IgG (Spearman's rho = 0.94, p = 0.005; Figure 4C ) and less so with binding to monomeric Env glycoprotein from the same virus strain (HIV-1 US657 ) (rho = 0.65, p = 0.16; Figure S6 ).

These facts led us to explore the role of antibody and low pH on transcytosis of HIV-1 across epithelial cells. Our primary finding is that at acidic pH, IgG enhances transcytosis of HIV-1 clinical isolates, including transmitted/founder Env-pseudotyped strains. Moreover, antibody from both cervicovaginal and seminal fluid mediates enhanced transcytosis at low pH. The enhanced transcytosis is abrogated by blocking or knocking down FcRn, which is known to bind IgG and immune complexes at low pH and release them at neutral pH [24, 42] . We also establish that virus translocated across epithelial cells after incubation with antibody at low pH remains infectious. Although neutralizing antibodies generally promote more transcytosis, the transcytosed virus is relatively less infectious than virus whose transcytosis is mediated by non-neutralizing antibodies. Finally, we demonstrate abundant FcRn protein expression in columnar epithelial cells of the human endocervix and penile urethra, suggesting that these sites could play a major role in FcRn-mediated immune complex transcytosis.",

This is consistent with other studies that have highlighted a role for FcRn in immune complex shuttling across tissues [34, 35, 43] . Mice expressing human FcRn in intestinal epithelial cells were able to deliver IgG to the luminal intestinal surface, which could then bind to its cognate antigen and return the immune complex back to the lamina propria for presentation by dendritic cells to CD4+ T cells [34] . In addition, cytomegalovirus (CMV) applied to human placental explants from women with high anti-CMV neutralizing antibody activity was rapidly transcytosed across syncytiotrophoblasts and captured by villus macrophages [35] . Under these conditions, the virus did not replicate. However, in explants from CMV-seropositive women with low or undetectable neutralizing antibodies, virus replication readily occurred in cytotrophoblasts underlying an intact, uninfected syncytiotrophoblast layer. Thus, it appeared that neutralizing antibody inhibited infection after allowing virus to cross the syncytiotrophoblast layer. On the other hand, non-neutralizing antibody allowed or even promoted infection. Syncytiotrophoblasts express high levels of FcRn, and when FcRn on explants was blocked, IgG-virion complexes were not transported across the surface [35] . Just as we found with HIV-1, FcRn-mediated transcytosis of CMV occurred with both neutralizing and poorly neutralizing antibody, but transcytosed virus remained infectious only when complexed with poorly neutralizing antibody. Finally, immunohistochemical staining of placentas from in utero infections were consistent with this model of FcRn-mediated transcytosis [35] .",

Our in vitro observations are applicable to male-to-female transmission via vaginal intercourse, where enhanced transcytosis could facilitate infection. In this regard, Li et al. reported FcRn expression and bidirectional IgG transport in a human vaginal tissue model [19] . Although we did not detect FcRn in the apical layers of vaginal epithelium, we did detect abundant FcRn expression in columnar endocervical epithelial cells. These cells may be exposed to acidic vaginal secretions where they occur at the cervical os. Furthermore, cervical ectopy, a common condition characterized by the extension of endocervical columnar epithelium into the ectocervix and upper vagina, has been implicated as a risk factor for HIV-1 infection [44, 45] . Prevalent in reproductive-age women, these cervical lesions are exposed to vaginal pH conditions and could provide portals for FcRn-mediated male-to-female HIV-1 transmission [46] . FcRn was also found, though not consistently, in basal epithelial cells of the vagina. These cells lie deep in the epithelium and are unlikely to come in contact with acidic secretions and HIV-1 immune complexes unless there were trauma or substantial thinning of the overlying squamous epithelium. It is important to note that seminal fluid can rapidly raise the pH of cervicovaginal secretions to levels which would not support immune complex-FcRn binding. However, the pH of cervicovaginal fluid following ejaculation is dependent on the quantity of the ejaculate and may stay within an acidic range [29] . Furthermore, HIV is present in preejaculate secretions and could be introduced into the female genital tract prior to ejaculation [47] .",

Our demonstration of abundant FcRn on human penile urethral epithelium supports a model where exposure to antibodybound HIV-1 might lead to enhanced female-to-male transmission. It should be noted that the pH of vaginal secretions is typically about 4, which is below the pH required for Fc-FcRn binding [48] . However, there is substantial variability in normal vaginal pH [26, 48] , and we did begin to observe enhanced transcytosis at pH 4.5 ( Figure S3H ). Furthermore, it is possible that there is some buffering effect of foreskin and urethral secretions. The foreskin, whose presence increases HIV infection rate, could trap secretions containing HIV-1 immune complexes and thereby allow greater urethral exposure to infected material within the pH range of Fc-FcRn binding [49] . Additionally, bacterial vaginosis, a condition associated with an increased risk of female-to-male (as well as male-female) HIV transmission, results in vaginal secretions ideal for Fc-FcRn binding [26, 27, 50] . Exposure of penile tissues to the pH range of Fc-FcRn binding may also occur after ejaculation, since complete neutralization of vaginal acidity may not occur immediately or at all [29] . It is also possible, though less likely, that FcRn mediates HIV transmission via the penis during insertive anal intercourse, where the penis may come into contact with slightly acidic rectal secretions [30] .",

Cervicovaginal and seminal fluids are reported to contain an average of ,3 mg/ml and up to ,15 mg/ ml of Env-specific IgG [18] . Four of the six samples we evaluated bound to infectious HIV-1 at 5 mg/ml. Moreover, all of our samples mediated transcytosis at #12.5 mg/ml of total IgG, well below total IgG concentrations found in genital secretions of HIVinfected men and women [18] . Even during acute HIV infection, when the risk of transmission to an uninfected partner is highest, 23 of 23 subjects (100%) were reported to have anti-gp41 IgG antibodies and 40% had anti-gp120 IgG antibodies in cervicovaginal and seminal fluids [17] . Anti-gp41 IgG levels were on average 11-fold higher than gp41-specific IgA levels; anti-gp41 IgM was found less frequently and in lower quantity. Thus, HIV-1 immune complexes are likely to occur in mucosal secretions, are likely to contain predominantly IgG, and under acidic conditions, would be subject to FcRn-mediated transcytosis in an exposed host.",

            "text": "Our findings represent a new model of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of HIV-1 infection. Previous studies have demonstrated ADE in vitro due to FccR-or complement-mediated mechanisms or to modulation of the interaction of gp120 with CCR5 [52, 53, 54] . Here we demonstrate that enhancement in vitro occurs at the level of transcytosis across epithelial cells and involves FcRn. In vivo, Ig isotype, as well as neutralizing activity, are likely to play a determining role in whether an antibody might protect from or enhance infection. As demonstrated recently, intrarectally applied dIgA1 HGN194 mAb, but less so the IgG1 version, prevented SHIV infection following intrarectal challenge [40] . In vitro, the dIgA1 inhibited transcytosis, whereas we now show that the IgG1 version enhances transcytosis at pH 6.0. Another study showed that, compared to irrelevant-and no-antibody controls, there was an increase in the number of transmitted/founder SHIV variants when vaginal challenge followed systemic or local infusion of a non-neutralizing IgG1 mAb [55] . Clearly, other studies have found that IgG with neutralizing activity can prevent lentivirus infection after vaginal challenge [56, 57] . Thus, whereas a strong vaccine-induced neutralizing IgG response may protect, nonneutralizing IgG or waning titers of neutralizing IgG present in an acidic lumen might enhance transcytosis across mucosal barriers while allowing infection of susceptible target cells. However, whether an antibody protects, enhances or has no effect is likely to depend on the potency and breadth of antiviral activity, the viral strain, the inflammatory state of the exposed individual, and genetic factors-such as FccR polymorphisms-that might influence antibody function [58] . Finally, if FcRn-mediated transcytosis applies in vivo, our results would strengthen the argument for a mucosal IgA response to vaccination-though not at the exclusion of a strong IgG neutralizing or other anti-viral response-since IgA can inhibit transcytosis, would not engage FcRn, and mediates only uni-directional translocation of immune complexes from the subepithelial space into external secretions [40, 59] .",

Antibodies HIVIG (IgG derived from pooled plasma of HIV-infected individuals) and IgG1 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) 2F5, 4E10, 2G12, F240, b6, and VRC01 were obtained from the NIH AIDS Reagents Program. IVIG (Gamunex, Taleris Biotherapeutics) was commercially acquired. mAb b12 and control mAb Den3 were provided by Dennis Burton and Brian Moldt, and control mAb Fm-6 was a gift of Wayne Marasco (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute); b12 and the control mAbs are IgG1. Generation and purification of dimeric and monomeric IgA2 versions of b12 (dIgA2 b12 and mIgA2 b12) are described elsewhere [66] . Briefly, the IgG constant region in pDR.12 (IgG b12) was replaced with the constant region of IgA2. IgA2 b12 was expressed in CHO-K1 cells with human J chain and purified by Protein L affinity matrix (Pierce). mIgA b12 and dIgA b12 were isolated by size exclusion chromatography. IgG1 HGN194 (a human mAb against HIV-1 Env V3), dIgA1 HGN194, and dIgA2HGN194 were provided by Davide Corti and Antonio Lanzavecchia [67] . HGN194 variants were constructed as follows: human J chain precursor (accession number NP_653247), IgA1 (allele IGHA1*01, accession number J00220) and IgA2 (allele IGHA2*01, accession number J00221) constant region nucleotide sequences were codon optimized and synthesized by Genscript. Constant regions were cloned into a mammalian expression vector used for subcloning of the HGN194 VH region. The HGN194 VH and VL chain were codon optimized and synthesized by Genscript and cloned into an IgG1 and Ig-lambda expression vector. MAbs HGN194 dIgA1, dIgA2, and IgG1 were produced by transient transfection of 293 freestyle cells with polyethylenimine and expression plasmids encoding corresponding heavy and light chains (in the case of dIgA1 and dIgA2, the J chain expression plasmid was included). Supernatant fluid from transfected cells was collected after 7-10 days of culture. HGN194 dIgA1, dIgA2, and IgG1 were affinity purified by Peptide M (dIgA1 and dIgA2) or Protein A (IgG1) chromatography. Purified Abs were quantified by ELISA using dIgA1 and dIgA2 or IgG1-specific Abs (Southern Biotech). Purity and polymeric state of dIgA1 and dIgA2 were confirmed by native-PAGE analysis and gel filtration chromatography. The presence of dIgA1 and dIgA2 associated J-chain was confirmed by Western blot from native and SDS-PAGE gels. Sera from 20 Zambian clade C-infected subjects (obtained from Zdenek Hel, University of Alabama, Birmingham) were pooled for IgG isolation using the Pierce Melon Gel IgG Spin Purification Kit (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Env-specific IgG, determined as for CVL and seminal fluid (see below), was 0.98% of total IgG. Sera from five uninfected individuals were pooled and processed for IgG isolation in the same manner.",

Viral loads were not measured in the CVL fluid specimens. Two of the women (with the lower plasma viral loads) were receiving anti-retroviral therapy. Briefly, CVL fluid was obtained by flushing the cervix and vagina with 5 ml sterile saline, and the wash was collected into tubes with protease inhibitors ( [73] ). Seminal fluid was obtained from two uninfected men (ages 25 and 40 years), and from three infected men (age 43 to 53 years) by masturbation (58) . CD4 counts in the infected men were 404/ mm 3 , 336/mm 3 and 407/mm 3 and plasma viral loads were ,100 copies/ml, 8092 copies/ml and 6750 copies/ml, respectively; only one of these subjects (with viral load of 11 copies/ml) was receiving anti-retroviral therapy. Seminal fluid was assayed for HIV-1 RNA by PCR, but none was detected. The cervicovaginal and seminal fluids were centrifuged and supernatant fluids aliquoted and frozen at 280uC until assayed. Total IgG was determined by ELISA [74] . IgG isolation was accomplished by incubating samples with Protein G-Sepharose (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corp.) followed by elution of bound IgG according to manufacturer's instructions. The IgG preparations were concentrated and dialyzed against DPBS using Amicon Centrifugal Filter Units (Millipore Corp.). The IgG preparations from the two uninfected men were pooled to obtain sufficient quantity for experiments; all other IgG preparations were tested individually.",

Electrical resistance across the membrane, which ranged from 400-450 mOhms/cm 2 at the start of the transcytosis assay, confirmed monolayer integrity.

After 12 hours, fluid in the lower chamber (''subnatant fluid''), maintained at pH 7.4, was collected and used to measure viral RNA copy number and infectivity. In the absence of cell monolayers, about 69% of the virus inoculum was present in the lower chamber of the wells after 12 hours.

HIV-1 US657 and the indicated concentrations of HIV-specific IgG (HIVIG) or control IgG (IVIG) were applied to the apical surface of T84 colonic carcinoma cells at pH 6.0 or 7.4. After 12 hours, virus in the subnatant fluid was quantified by RT-PCR and expressed as a percentage of the inoculum added to the apical surface. Data represent the mean+SE of two independent experiments. Similar results were obtained in an additional experiment using another R5 strain of HIV-1 (HIV-1 US712 ). (PPTX) Figure S3 Enhanced transcytosis is due to FcRn. (A) Knockdown of HEC-1A cells was accomplished using lentivirus particles expressing small hairpin RNA and verified by flow cytometry (left panel) and Western blot (right panel) using rabbit polyclonal anti-FcRn antibodies; WT = wild-type HEC-1A cells and KD = FcRnknockdown HEC-1A cells. GAPDH was used as a protein-loading control. (B) Binding of wild-type mAb b12 and Fc mutants of b12 (M428L and I253A) to HIV-1 JRFL gp120 by ELISA is equivalent. (c) Neutralization of HIV-1 JRFL by wild-type b12 and its Fc mutants are similar. IC 50 values for wild-type b12, M428L, and I253A are 0.03, 0.04, and 0.02 mg/ml, respectively. (D-F) Enhanced transcytosis of HIV-1 is blocked by bafilomycin A1 and by an anti-FcRn antibody. HIVIG and HIV US657 (D) or HIVIG or mAb b12 and HIV US712 (E, F) were added to the apical surface of HEC-1A cells at pH 6.0 in the presence or absence of 0.1 mM bafilomycin A1 (D-F) or in the presence of rabbit polyclonal anti-FcRn IgG (50 mg/ml) or normal rabbit polyclonal IgG (''Neg antibody'') (E, F). Data represent mean + SE of two independent experiments (D) or single experiments (E, F). (G) Non-HIV-specific mAb (Den3) inhibits VRC01-mediated enhancement of transcytosis of HIV-1 at pH 6.0. Immune complexes, made with 25 mg/ml of VRC01 and HIV-1 JRFL , were added to the apical surface of HEC-1A cells in the presence of indicated concentrations of Den3 at pH 6.0. Subnatant fluid (pH 7.4) was collected 12 hours later, and virus was quantified by RT-PCR. Numbers above the bars indicate the % inhibition of transcytosis. Data represent mean + SE of two independent experiments. (H) Maximum transcytosis in the presence of HIV-1specific antibody occurs at pH 5.5-6.0. HIV-1 JRFL was incubated with HIVIG (50 mg/ml) at indicated pH values and added to the apical surface of HEC-1A cells. Transcytosis was quantified by RT-PCR in subnatant fluid collected 6-and 12-hours later. Note that IVIG and no antibody controls, used at pH 6.0 only, gave similarly low levels of transcytosis compared to HIVIG at pH 7.4 (not shown). (PPTX) Figure S4 Transcytosis of IgG alone is influenced by pH at the apical cell surface. 50 mg/ml of mAbs Den3 or VRC01 were added to the apical side of HEC-1A cells. Twelve hours later, IgG was quantified in the subnatant fluid by ELISA. (PPTX) Figure S5 Transcytosis of HIV-1 JRFL correlates directly with mAb binding and inversely with neutralizing activity. (A) mAb binding by ELISA to HIV-1 JRFL directly coated on plates. (B) Correlation between mAb binding and transcytosis at 50 mg/ml of mAb (Spearman rho = 0.75; p = 0.052). (C) Correlation between IC 50 (see Figure 3E) and transcytosis at 50 mg/ml of mAb (Spearman rho = 20.71; p = 0.050). (PPTX) Figure S6 Anti-monomeric Env binding activity of CVL and seminal fluid IgG as a percentage of total IgG. The dotted line represents a negative cutoff based on the mean+2 SD of IgG from cervicovaginal and seminal fluid of the HIV-uninfected subjects. Shown is the mean+SE of two independent assays, each done in duplicate. (PPTX) Figure S7 Additional examples of FcRn expression in the columnar epithelia of human penile urethra and endocervix. (A) Penile, (B) endocervical or (C) vaginal tissue was stained with affinity-purified anti-human-FcRn rabbit IgG or with normal rabbit IgG (D, E). Staining was performed on frozen tissue sections.
