JEV NS1-specific antibody responses could be a target in the differential diagnosis of different flavivirus infections. However, the epitopes on JEV NS1 are poorly characterized. The present study describes the full mapping of linear B-cell epitopes in JEV NS1. We generated eleven NS1-specific monoclonal antibodies from mice immunized with recombinant NS1. For epitope mapping of monoclonal antibodies, a set of 51 partially-overlapping peptides covering the entire NS1 protein were expressed with a GST-tag and then screened using monoclonal antibodies. Through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), five linear epitope-containing peptides were identified. By sequentially removing amino acid residues from the carboxy and amino terminal of peptides, the minimal units of the five linear epitopes were identified and confirmed using monoclonal antibodies. Five linear epitopes are located in amino acids residues 5 AIDITRK 11 , 72 RDELNVL 78 , 251 KSKHNRREGY 260 , 269 DENGIVLD 276 , and 341 DETTLVRS 348 . Furthermore, it was found that the epitopes are highly conserved among JEV strains through sequence alignment. Notably, none of the homologous regions on NS1 proteins from other flaviviruses reacted with the MAbs when they were tested for cross-reactivity, and all five epitope peptides were not recognized by sera against West Nile virus or Dengue virus. These novel virus-specific linear B-cell epitopes of JEV NS1 would benefit the development of new vaccines and diagnostic assays.",

            "text": "Japanese encephalitis (JE) is caused by the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), and is one of the most important mosquito-borne diseases with a mortality rate as high as 20% to 50%, and is widely distributed in most of East and South-east Asia and parts of Oceania. Up to 50,000 human cases of JE are reported annually in Asian countries, of which 10,000-15,000 result in fatality [1] . A high proportion (nearly 50%) of survivors, especially young children and those greater than 65 years of age, exhibit permanent neurologic and psychiatric sequelae. A wide range of animals including swine, equines and birds can also be infected. Pigs, as well as birds, serve as amplifying and reservoir hosts [2, 3] . Further, JEV infection has accounted for significant economic losses in the pig industry due to fetal encephalitis and reproductive failure in pregnant sows and hypospermia in boars [4] . There is no specific treatment available for JE, and vaccination is the only effective way to prevent JEV infection in humans and domestic animals. JEV non-structural protein 1 (NS1) has been shown to induce both humoral and cell-mediated immunity against JE [5, 6] . Further, like other flaviviruses, NS1 is able to elicit protective immunity without the risk of antibody-dependent enhancement. These characteristics make NS1 an attractive alternative immunogen. As such, much research is currently being devoted to NS1-based vaccine development [7, 8, 9] . Although NS1 is not present in the virion, NS1-induced antibodies can protect against infection in vivo by an undetermined mechanism, which presumably depends on the Fc portion of the antibody since they kill their target cells through a complement-dependent pathway [10, 11] .",

            "text": "JEV is a member of the family Flaviviridae, and the genus Flavivirus, and is primarily transmitted by Culex mosquitoes. Besides JEV, the Japanese encephalitis virus serocomplex of Flaviviridae includes the West Nile virus (WNV), Saint Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) and Murray Valley encephalitis virus (MVEM). JEV serogroup viruses and Dengue virus (DENV) have a similar ecology; it is very common that two or more of these flaviviruses co-circulate in some regions of the world [12] [13] [14] [15] , and crossreactivity can be demonstrated among these flaviviruses in serological tests. These cross-reactive responses could confound the interpretation of results during serological testing, including neutralization tests and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) [16] . This serves to emphasize the utility of virus-specific epitopes for the differential diagnosis of disease and epidemiological surveys. The serological cross-reactivity is primarily caused by cross-reactive epitopes on the structural protein E [17, 18] . In contrast, NS1 is more specific in serological testing of flavivirus infections, and it has been reported that NS1 can induce antibodies without cross-reactivity among flaviviruses [14] , and even among different serotypes of DENV [19, 20] , therefore the development of an NS1-based specific serological diagnosis is of great interest [14, 21, 22] . First, it is necessary to precisely identify the B-cell epitopes on NS1. In this study we have identified and characterized five JEV NS1-specific epitopes with monoclonal antibodies. This work demonstrates progress toward the development of a specific serological diagnostic test for JEV infection, extends our understanding of the antigenic structure of JEV NS1, and could help inform vaccine design.",

After testing NS1-derived short fusion peptides against MAbs, five peptides were identified by eleven MAbs. These peptides correspond to JEV NS1 residues 1-16, 65-80, 249-264, 265-280 and 337-352, respectively, and are referred to as peptides NS1-1, -9, -32, -34 and -43. The peptides NS1-1, NS1-9 and NS1-32 were recognized by only one MAb; however, peptide NS1-34 was recognized by three MAbs, and peptide NS1-43 was recognized by five MAbs. Peptide NS1-34 and peptide NS1-43 may therefore contain more than one epitope respectively. In order finely map the epitopes, we designed and expressed sets of shortened fusion peptides for each of the above-mentioned peptides. After probing the shortened fusion peptides with MAbs, we confirmed five linear epitopes and deduced that the minimal units of epitopes of NS1-1, -9, -32, -34, -43 were 5 Sequence alignment showed that the epitopes are highly conserved among JEV strains. Notably, epitopes NS1-9 and NS1-34 have 99% identity among 100 JEV strains, and there was only one amino acid substitution in all of the heterologous peptides corresponding to the respective epitope. The highly conserved nature of the epitopes we identified is beneficial for the application of epitopes in vaccine design and epitope-based diagnosis. We then compared the JEV NS1 protein sequence with the NS1 sequences of WNV, MVEV and DENV. Among the JEV-serocomplex, JEV has the highest NS1 sequence similarity with MVEV. JEV and DENV co-circulate in Southeast Asia [12] , and JEV and WNV cocirculate in India [15] , so there is an urgent need for differential diagnoses between JEV, WNV and DENV. None of the MAbs in this study reacted to WNV or DENV whole virus antigens or the corresponding NS1 sequences. Furthermore, none of the five JEV NS1 epitopes were recognized by anti-sera against WNV and DENV. Although the corresponding epitopes NS1-9 and NS1-43 of MVEV have weak reactivity with JEV NS1-specific MAbs and mouse antisera, there is no report of JEV and MVEV cocirculating in any region, and epitopes NS1-1, -32 and -34 did not cross-react with MVEV. This finding may indicate that these NS1 epitopes have the potential to be of use in serological monitoring and differential diagnosis. In summary, we precisely identified five JEV-specific and highly conserved B-cell epitopes on JEV NS1. The data described in this work could provide a foundation for further understanding of the ",
