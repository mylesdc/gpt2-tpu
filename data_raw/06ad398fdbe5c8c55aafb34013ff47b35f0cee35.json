The majority of shipments contained mammals (27%), while the majority of specimens imported were shells (57%) and tropical fish (25%). Most imports were facilitated by the aquatic and pet industry, resulting in one-third of all shipments containing live animals. The importer reported origin of wildlife was 77.7% wild-caught and 17.7% captive-reared. Indonesia was the leading exporter of legal shipments, while Mexico was the leading source reported for illegal shipments. At the specimen level, China was the leading exporter of legal and illegal wildlife imports. The number of annual declared shipments doubled during the period examined, illustrating continually increasing demand, which reinforces the need to scale up capacity for border inspections, risk management protocols and disease surveillance. Most regulatory oversight of wildlife trade is aimed at conservation, rather than prevention of disease introduction.",

Approximately one-quarter of human deaths are caused by infectious disease and nearly 60% of infectious diseases are considered zoonotic (pathogens transmissible between animals and humans); most of these (>70%) are caused by pathogens of wildlife origin (Taylor et al. 2001; Jones et al. 2008; Drexler 2010) . Whereas historically disease spillover events were likely to remain local, even undetected due to natural, cultural and geographic barriers, modern transportation allows emerging diseases to spread along various globally connected networks in a matter of days. In the past decade alone, we have witnessed several novel disease threats to global health, food security and economic stability as a result of one of these networks-the trade of live wild animals and/or their products (Karesh et al. 2007 (Karesh et al. , 2012 .",

Lack of wildlife trade surveillance and proper systematic management of the data available represents a major gap to understand and determine high-risk pathways of potentially adverse organisms' introduction. In order to properly assess this threat to the USA, we must (1) better understand the scope of the trade in terms of species, volume, condition and origin; (2) determine high-risk pathways of introduction for further assessment; and (3) understand the regulatory framework that exists to manage these threats.",

The illegal aspect of wildlife trade is estimated to be a $5-20 billion-dollar industry, comparable to the international trade of narcotics and weapons (Wyler and Sheikh 2008; Haken 2011; WWF/ Dalberg 2012) .

In some cases, legal trade is well recorded by border officials while in other cases it is largely ignored. Confiscated illegal trade is often reported but undetected illegal shipments regularly go unrecorded. Legality of wildlife trade in most instances does not correlate with disease risk posed, as the majority of wildlife trade regulations (e.g., the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora; CITES) are in place to conserve certain species or regulate economies rather than protect health.",

Within each category exist a range of specialty market value chains that vary in motivating economics, cultural and societal origins, geographic source and destination, transportation type and route, trader and consumer identities, behavioral practices, species volume and condition, local and international legality. This results in vastly variable threats including loss of biodiversity, invasive alien species, food security and emergence of both high-and low-consequence pathogens. Thus, threats can only be quantified in response to specific questions (i.e., examining unique traits of specific market chains/pathways).",

Although some wildlife species are regulated by other US agencies such as the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and Food and Drug Administration (FDA), imports of wildlife as defined by USFWS are also tracked in LEMIS despite this overlap in jurisdiction. Therefore, the LEMIS system represents a comprehensive data source for incoming wildlife to the USA (with few exceptions such as bushmeat items that are not determined to be of CITES origin).

The most remarkable finding of this review is that the number of declared wildlife shipments into the USA has doubled since 2000. The economic value of wildlife imports paralleled this increase in shipments, rising 108% from 1998 to 2007 (Ferrier 2009 ).",

With this volume of live wildlife entering the USA for commercial purposes, concerns have been raised regarding the unwanted side effect of invasive alien species and their pathogens. The 50,000 recorded invasive alien species imported to the USA have cost the government an estimated US $120 billion per year (Pimentel et al. 2005) in damage or control efforts. Over 200 species of imported fish have resulted in introductions to the wild in the USA with nearly half establishing breeding populations at least for some time (Smith et al. 2008) . Beyond the environmental impacts, translocation of such live wildlife has resulted in pathogen pollution (the introduction of viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites into new environments) with consequences to native wildlife health and US fisheries, for example (Springborn et al. 2015) .",

However, this percentage is based on assessment of refused shipments in the LEMIS database and therefore does not take into account smuggled shipments not detected; detected by Department of Homeland Security Customs and Border Protection (DHS CBP) but not reported to USFWS; detected by USFWS but not entered into LEMIS after the fact; or detected by CBP but reported only to another regulating agency of the same item such as the CDC, USDA or FDA. As previously noted, the USFWS LEMIS database is mainly a reflection of approved or rejected wildlife imports that are declared to USFWS by the importer and that non-declared (and thus illegal) imports that are successfully detected are done so through the DHS CBP. These confiscations should be reported to USFWS and entered into LEMIS; however, confiscation data housed in CBP databases are not readily available to the public in a significant level of detail for comparison.

However, codes exist for several taxonomic levels (species, genus and more general ''non-CITES'' or ''NA'' descriptors), and a large portion of the data did not include species level identification. Further, codes often overlapped and/or several different codes were used to describe a single species. Currently, WILDb contains 14,074 unique species codes. EHA was able to ascertain some level of taxonomic information for over 98% of the data entries despite the fact that the majority of these did not provide specific species identification.

This market involves billions of individual live animals, ranging from invertebrates and corals to non-human primates, originating from all over the globe. The demand for trophies, fashion, traditional medicines and exotic foods are some of the main drivers of the importation of wildlife products.
