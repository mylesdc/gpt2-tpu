            "text": "Swine influenza is an acute respiratory disease in pigs caused by swine influenza virus (SIV). Highly virulent SIV strains cause mortality of up to 10%. Importantly, pigs have long been considered ''mixing vessels'' that generate novel influenza viruses with pandemic potential, a constant threat to public health. Since its emergence in 2009 and subsequent pandemic spread, the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 (H1N1pdm) has been detected in pig farms, creating the risk of generating new reassortants and their possible infection of humans. Pathogenesis in SIV or H1N1pdm-infected pigs remains poorly characterized. Proinflammatory and antiviral cytokine responses are considered correlated with the intensity of clinical signs, and swine macrophages are found to be indispensible in effective clearance of SIV from pig lungs. In this study, we report a unique pattern of cytokine responses in swine macrophages infected with H1N1pdm. The roles of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases in the regulation of the host responses were examined. We found that proinflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and TNF-a were significantly induced and their induction was ERK1/2-dependent. IFN-b and IFN-inducible antiviral Mx and 2959-OAS were sharply induced, but the inductions were effectively abolished when ERK1/2 was inhibited. Induction of CCL5 (RANTES) was completely inhibited by inhibitors of ERK1/2 and JNK1/2, which appeared also to regulate FasL and TNF-a, critical for apoptosis in pig macrophages. We found that NFkB was activated in H1N1pdm-infected cells, but the activation was suppressed when ERK1/2 was inhibited, indicating there is cross-talk between MAP kinase and NFkB responses in pig macrophages. Our data suggest that MAP kinase may activate NFkB through the induction of RIG-1, which leads to the induction of IFN-b in swine macrophages. Understanding host responses and their underlying mechanisms may help identify venues for effective control of SIV and assist in prevention of future influenza pandemics.",

Pigs recover within a few days, but severe signs can develop and mortality can reach up to 10% when highly virulent strains are involved [1] or pigs are infected at young ages [2, 3] . Pigs have long been considered to be the intermediate host of various subtype viruses and ''mixing vessels'' for the evolution and genesis of influenza viruses with pandemic potential because of their susceptibility to swine, avian, and human influenza viruses [4, 5, 6] . This broad susceptibility is due to the presence of both sialic acid (SA)2,3 Gal-and SA2,6-Gal receptors present in the respiratory epithelium.",

Pigs are also susceptible to and show clinical signs when infected with pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus (referred to hereafter as H1N1pdm) [12] , which emerged in April 2009 in North America [13] , arising at least in part from contemporaneous SIV. To date H1N1pdm has been found in a few swine farms [12, 14, 15] , which further demonstrates a two-way process of both gene and virus trafficking between humans and pigs. Though H1N1pdm has remained antigenically and genetically stable in humans since its emergence, a novel reassortant SIV containing a H1N1pdm-like NA and seven other genes from triple-reassortant H1N2 and European ''avian-like'' H1N1 viruses was identified in early 2010 [16] , and that same year H1N1pdm was shown to be evolving genetically at a faster pace in pigs than it was in humans [12, 15, 17] . Effective control of circulating influenza viruses in swine populations is key to reducing consequent genesis of novel pandemic strains that threaten the health of both humans and animals.",

In an alveoli macrophage-depleted pig model, macrophages appeared to be indispensible to effective clearance of SIV from lungs. A higher frequency of cytotoxic T, cd T, and Treg cells were also detected in infected pig lungs [18] , which together with the induction of cytokines, contribute to pathogenesis of influenza infection in pigs. Exploring the mechanism of regulation of host responses is crucial for understanding the pathogenesis of SIV and for controlling swine influenza in pigs. Macrophages residing beneath the respiratory epithelium and surrounding alveoli are part of the first line defenses against influenza viruses. During influenza viral replication in bronchial epithelial cells, macrophages are one of the earliest targets to be infected. Together with dendritic cells, macrophages coordinate innate immune responses, which subsequently lead to adaptive immunity by initiating antigen presentation and lymphocyte activation. Macrophages are indispensable in alveolar host defense and controlling influenza virus in pulmonary organs in pigs [22] . While protective in launching host antiviral responses and restricting virus spread, induced proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines are also the cause of pathogenicity for the host and may lead to acute respiratory failure (ARF), a major cause of death in highly pathogenic H5N1 or H1N1pdm-infected humans [23] . Needless to say, the roles of macrophages are critical to pathogenicity as well as host protection in SIV-infected pigs. However, little is known about the mechanisms of how host responses are regulated in pigs or their macrophages.",

We further examined the induction of RIG-1 and MDA-5 and their relevance to MAP kinases. To do this, we pre-treated the cells with inhibitors of MAP kinases. As shown in Figure 8C , the induction of RIG-1 was completely abolished by the inhibition of ERK1/2 or JNK1/2 inhibitors, and to a much lesser extent, by the p38 inhibitor, suggesting that the induction of RIG-1 was dependent on ERK1/ 2 and JNK1/2, but not as much on p38. This differentially regulated pattern of RIG-1 induction by ERK1/2, p38, and JNK1/2 was similar to the suppression of NFkB phosphorylation/activation by MAP kinases (Fig. 8A) , suggesting that the induction of RIG-1 was associated with ERK1/2 or JNK1/2 activation, but to a much lesser extent with p38.

This pattern differs from that in bronchoalveolar secretions of SIV-infected pigs in which IL-1b was induced but IL-8 was not [19, 20, 21, 22, 25] . The different cell types involved (macrophages and epithelial cells) may account for the difference. It has previously been reported that in human immune cells and patients a weak innate immune response, evidenced by a poor induction of proinflammatory and antiviral cytokines including IFN-b and TNF-a, has been observed in human monocyte-derived DCs and macrophages infected with H1N1pdm, compared to seasonal H1N1 infection [31] . Highly pathogenic H5N1 viral infection in human macrophages induced higher expression of IL-6 and CCL5 (RANTES) than pH1N1 [32] , which may explain generally mild clinical disease among H1N1pdm-infected patients.

However, our data clearly demonstrate that ERK1/2 plays a major role in the regulation of IFN-b in pig macrophages, which may indicate that the regulation of IFN differs in different cell types. We noted that basal level activities of both ERK1/2 and JNK1/2 were constitutively present in non-infected 3D/4 cells, which may be important in the induction of proinflammatory and antiviral cytokines at the early stages of infection.

            "text": "Macrophages appear to die inevitably of apoptosis when infected with influenza virus [26] . The Fas-mediated extrinsic apoptotic pathway is apparently triggered by TNF family ligands. While both FasL and TNF-a were induced vigorously upon the viral infection, induction of TRAIL was rather mild in H1N1pdminfected swine macrophages. We knew previously that FasL and TNF-a were barely detectable, while the level of TRAIL remained high prior to the infection based on our realtime RT-PCR data (Ct) (Xing et al., unpublished data). We can therefore presume that H1N1pdm-induced apoptosis may be mainly attributed to FasL and TNF-a, while pig macrophages could be resistant to TRAIL, since the cells remained intact despite the presence of a high level of TRAIL before infection. Furthermore, we were also able to determine that both ERK1/2 and JNK1/2 were involved in the induction of FasL, TNF-a, and TRAIL. FasL is also regulated by ERK1 in chicken macrophages infected with an H9N2 avian influenza virus [34] .",

            "text": "Both toll-like receptors (TLR) and RNA helicases, such as RIG-1 and MDA-5, are critical to antiviral innate immunity [35, 36] . As a cytosolic sensor, RIG-1 binds to dsRNA and viral ssRNA that contain a 59-triphosphate not present in host RNA, and then is recruited to mitochondrial protein IPS via the CARD domain, leading to activation of NFkB, IRF-3/-7, and induction of IFN [37, 38, 39] . RIG-1 can be induced by viral infection [40] . In this study, we observed a robust induction of RIG-1 and MDA-5 in H1N1pdm-infected swine macrophages, which appeared to be suppressed completely by inhibitors of ERK1/2 or JNK1/2, but to be a much lesser extent, by the inhibitor of p38. This indicates that the induction of RIG-1 or MDA-5 depends on the activation of ERK1/2 and JNK1/2 in pig macrophages. We postulate a mechanism, therefore, that the cross-talk between MAP kinase and NFkB pathways is through the regulation of RIG-1 and maybe MDA-5, and that ERK1/2 controls the activation of NFkB, leading to the induction of IFN in swine macrophages.",
