            "text": "Pigeon circovirus (PiCV) is the most frequently diagnosed virus in pigeons and is thought to be one of the causative factors of a complex disease called the young pigeon disease syndrome (YPDS). The development of a vaccine against this virus could be a strategy for YPDS control. Since laboratory culture of PiCV is impossible, its recombinant capsid protein (rCP) can be considered as a potential antigen candidate in sub-unit vaccines. The aim of this basic research was to evaluate the immune response of pigeons to PiCV rCP. Sixty six-week-old carrier pigeons were divided into two groups (experimental immunized with PiCV rCP mixed with an adjuvant, and control immunized with an adjuvant only), and immunized twice in a 21-day interval. On the day of immunization and on two, 23, 39, and 46 days post first immunization (dpv), samples of blood, spleen, and bursa of Fabricius were collected from six birds from each group to examine anti-PiCV rCP IgY, anti-PiCV rCP IgY-secreting B cells (SBC), IFN-\u03b3 gene expression, and percentage of T CD3 + , CD4 + , CD8 + , and B IgM + lymphocytes. The results indicated a correct immune response to PiCV rCP both in humoral and cell-mediated immunity, which was manifested by seroconversion since 23 dpv, by a significantly higher anti-PiCV rCP IgY-SBC number on two and 23 dpv, and significantly higher IFN-\u03b3 gene expression since two dpv. There were no significant differences or trends noted between particular T and B lymphocyte subpopulations. To conclude, PiCV rCP may be deemed immunogenic and could be considered as an antigen candidate in sub-unit vaccines against PiCV infections in pigeons.",

PiCV infections are spread worldwide due to the specificity of pigeon breeding [3] like, e.g., inability to follow biosecurity procedures, especially in the case of racing birds. These birds usually take part in pigeon races or shows where hundreds or thousands of birds originating from different geographic areas have direct or indirect (watering during transport) contact with each other. For this reason, the spreading of infectious diseases in pigeons is rapid and they are affected by numerous pathogens [2, 4] . The prevalence of PiCV is determined by age and health status, and affects about 70% of the global pigeon population on average [5] [6] [7] . Asymptomatic infections with this virus are quite common and account for 36-53% of the population [8] [9] [10] .",

In infected pigeons, PiCV targets the bursa of Fabricius and other organs of the immune system, including the thymus and spleen [14] . The immune organs are not the only ones that are infected with PiCV. The virus or its genetic material has been detected in the liver, kidneys, intestines, brain, and skin, and recently even in the gizzard, third eyelid, and thyroid gland [4, 15, 16] . The main consequence of PiCV infection is the atrophy of immune system organs. Pigeon circovirus infection is also claimed to lead to the apoptosis of lymphocytes [17] . For the above reasons, PiCV is regarded as a putative immunosuppressive agent in pigeons [14, 17, 18] . PiCV infections could predispose birds to accompanying infections with other viruses or bacteria [2, 7, 19] . The clinical presentation of YPDS varies, because a combination of conditionally pathogenic microorganisms is required for disease manifestation. The type and intensity of clinical symptoms are correlated with the type of confounding factor. In pigs, infections caused by another immunosuppresive virus from the Circoviridae family-porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), leading to lymphoid atrophy, both lymphopenia and suboptimal antibody responses-were noted. The main pathogenicity of this virus has been demonstrated to result from its influence on both positive and negative selection of maturing T cells in the thymus. The PCV2 infection in pigs leads to thymocyte selection dysregulation in infected animals [20] . The above facts make YPDS similar to a swine disease caused by PCV2 called PCV2-systemic disease (PCV2-SD) [20, 21] .",

Like other circoviruses, PiCV is characterized by high genetic diversity, and based on the analysis of the full genome sequences, its five subgenotypes have been identified [9] . The genome of PiCV has an ambisense organization, with two major open reading frames (ORFs): ORF V1, which is located on the virion sense strand and encodes replicase (Rep protein), and ORF C1, which is located on the complementary sense strand and encodes the viral capsid protein (Cap protein, CP) [1, 22] . Apart from the fact that CP is the main constituent of circoviral capsids, it plays an intermediate role in viral DNA penetration into the cell nucleus of the host. Investigations on psittacine circoviruses have demonstrated that the arginine-rich N-terminus of this protein has the capability to bind with host DNA using a nuclear localization sequence (NLS), which enables viral DNA penetration into a cell nucleus of the host through a complex of nuclear pores [25] . Capsids of circoviruses form repeating sub-units of CP, owing to which CP is believed to be the main antigenic protein of these viruses [26] . Immune responses induced by contact with a circovirus capsid were demonstrated in PCV2 and psittacine circovirus (psittacine beak and feather disease virus, PBFDV) [26, 27] . Studies conducted on PCV2 have demonstrated the virus capsid protein to be responsible for the immune response, including the production of specific antibodies and interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3). For instance, the immune response in the form of appearing antibodies occurred between week two to week four after piglets' exposure to PCV2 or to porcine circovirus capsid protein [27] .",

PiCV rCP could also be a potential candidate as a vaccine antigen, but its immunogenicity has not been confirmed in scientific research. The sub-unit vaccines based on PCV2 recombinant capsid proteins are successfully used in the prevention of PCV2-SD [31] [32] [33] [34] . By analogy with the above, the development of a sub-unit vaccine against PiCV could protect pigeons against infections with this virus and, possibly, lower the prevalence of YPDS.",

The plates were then rinsed 3 times with PBS-Tween 20 solution (0.05%; Sigma Aldrich, Schnelldorf, Germany) and once with PBS (Sigma Aldrich, Schnelldorf, Germany), then blocked with the RPMI medium containing 20% FBS (Sigma Aldrich, Schnelldorf, Germany) at 37 \u2022 C for 1 h. The samples were standardized to 1.5 \u00d7 10 5 cells and deposited directly in the wells of the previously prepared plates. Mononuclear cells from each sample were deposited in triplicate. Next, 100 \u00b5L of Iscove's modified Dulbecos medium (IMDM; Sigma Aldrich, Schnelldorf, Germany) was added to each well. After incubation (39.5 \u2022 C, 5% CO 2 , 24 h), the plates were rinsed 3 times with PBS-Tween 20 (Sigma Aldrich, Schnelldorf, Germany), 3 times with PBS (Sigma Aldrich, Schnelldorf, Germany), and incubated overnight (4 \u2022 C) with biotinylated rabbit anti-pigeon IgY (Antibodies-online, Atlanta, GA, USA). The plates were then rinsed 4 times with PBS (Sigma Aldrich, Schnelldorf, Germany), and after loosening the bottom of the plate, the membranes were rinsed with PBS (Sigma Aldrich, Schnelldorf, Germany) on the reverse. Next, 100 \u00b5L of streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase (S-AP) (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) dissolved (1:500) in PBS (Sigma Aldrich, Schnelldorf, Germany) were added to each well. After incubation at 25 \u2022 C for 1 h, the plates were rinsed again as described above. Enzymatic reaction was performed with an alkaline phosphatase substrate (BCIP/NBT; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) for 15-25 min and stopped with distilled water. Anti-PiCV rCP B IgY + spot-forming units (SFU) were counted with an Eli.Scan plate scanner and Eli.Analyse software (A-EL-VIS, Hannover, Germany). Data was expressed as the mean absolute number of SFU \u00b1 SD per 1 \u00d7 10 6 of mononuclear cells in each group for each day of sampling.",

            "text": "The B-cell ELISPOT technique used in this study calculated the mean absolute number of the anti-PiCV rCP IgY-SBC. To obtain reliable results, the number of cells deposited into ELISPOT plate wells was equal; each sample was deposited in triplicate and average number of SFU was calculated for each sample. As it appears from our study, subsequent immunizations of pigeons with PiCV rCP contributed to the successive reduction in the number of anti-PiCV rCP IgY-SBC since 2 dpv. Nevertheless, on each sampling date, the SFU number was higher in the experimental group than in the control birds, in which the constant SFU number was treated as a background. Due to the high variability between the samples, the differences observed between the investigated groups of pigeons were statistically significant only on two and 23 dpv ( Figure 2B ). The decreasing number of anti-PiCV rCP IgY-SBC may be explained as resulting from the successive extinguishment of reaction force of this component of humoral immunity resulting from repeated exposure to the antigen with relatively low immunogenicity. Comparison of the results of in-house ELISA and ELISPOT reveals an opposite dependency between levels of anti-PiCV rCP IgY in pigeon sera and anti-PiCV rCP IgY-SBC in the spleen. The lifespan of plasma cells (IgY-SBC) is lower than the half-life period of specific antibodies, and only a small population of antibody-secreting cells appears later as memory cells [44] . Because IgY are secreted by each generation of plasma cells and are detectable after plasmocyte death, their number increases even if the number of IgY-SBC decreases. This dependency was observed not only in our study, but also in the research conducted with the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). Pei et al. (2005) showed that the number of anti-IBV IgY-SBC increased in chicken spleens on days three and seven post inoculation (dpi), and then the number of those cells sharply decreased by more than 20-fold by 14 dpi. The anti-IBV IgY-SBC number was then low and stable until week 10 post inoculation (pi). Whereas specific IgY antibodies against IBV were detected at low levels seven days later than anti-IBV IgY-SBC, their level increased successively up to two weeks pi and they were still present at a high level up to 10 weeks pi [44] . The kinetics of anti-PiCV rCP-SBC and antibody response to PiCV rCP in the present study is very similar to this described above.",

Determination of the percentage of selected T cell subpopulations could provide interesting information about the immune response of the organism to infection or vaccination; such analyses are successfully performed in various poultry species with commercial antibodies [45] [46] [47] . Unfortunately, no commercially available monoclonal antibodies are dedicated for pigeons. Our previous investigation using anti-chicken monoclonal antibodies for staining pigeon T cells was saddled with high methodological error due to very limited cross reactivity between the used antibodies and pigeon T cells [48] . For this reason, a protocol was developed for producing monoclonal antibodies against pigeon T cells' surface receptors. The purified antibodies were checked for cross-reactivity with mononuclear cells isolated from chicken and turkey, and no-cross reactions were detected. For the first time, we show flow cytometry analyses performed using anti-pigeon T cell receptor monoclonal antibodies. In the presented study, no significant differences were noted in the percentage of T CD3 + , CD4 + and CD8 + cells in the post-immunization period between the investigated groups, except CD3 + T cells in the bursa of Fabricius on 23 dpv and CD4 + T cells in the spleen on 39 dpv. Nevertheless, the average percentage of T CD3 + lymphocytes in all examined organs was a bit lower in the immunized birds than in the control group, whereas that of CD4 + T lymphocytes was usually higher in the immunized birds and that of CD8 + T cells was at a similar level. Randomness of the above differences and high variability in values of the same parameter between sampling dates in particular groups suggest that they resulted from factors other than immunization, probably from inter-individual differences and increasing age of the birds. The diversity of certain T cell populations in relation to the age of birds is often noted in avian species [49, 50] . The obtained results suggest that immunization with PiCV rCP has no influence on the percentage of the examined subpopulation of T cells; this conclusion is convergent with the results obtained by other authors who were also unable to detect clear differences in T cell subpopulations between unvaccinated piglets and those immunized with porcine circovirus sub-unit vaccine [51] . In the case of swine, changes were observed over time in the post-immunization period in various T cell subpopulations in both immunized groups were attributed to the physiological development of immune competence in growing pigs [51] . In view of the presented results and literature data, it seems immunization with PiCV rCP is not sufficient to stimulate changes in certain T lymphocyte subpopulations.",

IFN-\u03b3 is secreted mainly by T CD4 + and CD8 + lymphocytes and to a lesser extent by B cells, NK cells, and NKT cells [52] . Increasing research evidence has suggested that the specific cellular response-including IFN-\u03b3 secretion-is involved in the protection against PCV2-SD [32, 34, 51, 53] . In this study, we learned that immunization with PiCV rCP stimulated IFN-\u03b3 gene expression. It is noteworthy that the expression of this gene was higher in the immunized group during the whole post-immunization period, but for the reason of high standard deviation the differences were statistically significant only on two and 39 dpv in blood and on two and 46 dpv in the spleen. Our results are in concordance with the investigation conducted on pigs, where a stimulatory effect of PCV2 rCP on IFN-\u03b3 production was observed within 42 days after vaccination [34, 51] . The increased interferon production for a relatively long (six-week) period after the first immunization could result from the fact that the antigen was mixed with the adjuvant in both our study and the cited study.",

The high levels of specific antibodies and IFN-\u03b3 play an important role in the prevention and reduction of infection or clinical signs in the case of swine circovirus [31, 32, 43, 51] and, by analogy, similar or the same mechanism could be involved in the immunity against pigeon circovirus. In the light of the obtained results, it may be concluded that pigeon circovirus recombinant capsid protein could be an antigen candidate in sub-unit vaccines against PiCV infections in pigeons. This vaccine could protect pigeons against such infections, and possibly, lower the prevalence of YPDS. However, considering the high prevalence of PiCV, the subclinically infected pigeons will be vaccinated, if the vaccine is developed. For the above reasons, more basic research should be performed to evaluate the immune response to PiCV rCP in both uninfected and asymptomatically infected pigeons. In turn, application research with experimental challenge with PiCV is also needed to evaluate the protectivity of the vaccine based on PiCV rCP.",
