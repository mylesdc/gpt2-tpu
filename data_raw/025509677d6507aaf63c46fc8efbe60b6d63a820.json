However, the majority of infections are subclinical and not associated with evident birth defects. Potentially detrimental life-long health outcomes in asymptomatic offspring evoke high concerns. Thus, animal models addressing sequelae in offspring may provide valuable information. To induce subclinical infection, we inoculated selected porcine fetuses at the mid-stage of development. Inoculation resulted in trans-fetal virus spread and persistent infection in the placenta and fetal membranes for two months. Offspring did not show congenital Zika syndrome (e.g., microcephaly, brain calcifications, congenital clubfoot, arthrogryposis, seizures) or other visible birth defects. However, a month after birth, a portion of offspring exhibited excessive interferon alpha (IFN-\u03b1) levels in blood plasma in a regular environment. Most affected offspring also showed dramatic IFN-\u03b1 shutdown during social stress providing the first evidence for the cumulative impact of prenatal ZIKV exposure and postnatal environmental insult. Other eleven cytokines tested before and after stress were not altered suggesting the specific IFN-\u03b1 pathology. While brains from offspring did not have histopathology, lesions, and ZIKV, the whole genome expression analysis of the prefrontal cortex revealed profound sex-specific transcriptional changes that most probably was the result of subclinical in utero infection. RNA-seq analysis in the placenta persistently infected with ZIKV provided independent support for the sexspecific pattern of in utero-acquired transcriptional responses. Collectively, our results provide strong evidence that two hallmarks of fetal ZIKV infection, altered type I IFN response PLOS Pathogens | https://doi.",

            "text": "Introduction Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during human pregnancy may lead to fetal death, brain lesions, in utero growth restriction, and microcephaly in newborns resulting in severe life-long impairments [1] [2] [3] [4] . Critically, the majority of congenital infections in humans is subclinical [2, 5] and is not associated with easily identifiable brain lesions or birth defects. Deleterious and less severe delayed neurodevelopmental, motor, and neurosensory abnormalities in apparently normal at birth human offspring have been described later within one-two years of life [6, 7] . Potentially detrimental life-long health outcomes in asymptomatic offspring evoke high concerns [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Thus, animal models addressing sequelae in offspring may provide valuable information. In a pigtail macaque model, maternal ZIKV inoculation during gestation resulted in substantial brain lesions and silent brain pathology (i.e., periventricular T2-hyperintense foci and loss of fetal noncortical brain volume, injury to the ependymal epithelium with underlying gliosis, and loss of late fetal neuronal progenitor cells) in fetuses, even in the absence of microcephaly [10, 11] . Two very recent studies in immunocompetent mouse models reported neurocognitive disorders and neurobehavioral deficits in offspring affected with mild congenital ZIKV infection [12, 13] . These pioneering studies provided critical information regarding outcomes of mild congenital ZIKV infection in mouse offspring. Although, in these models, ZIKV induced clinical disease with reduced fetal birth weight, postnatal growth impediments, and neurobehavioral deficits. Thus, models reproducing subclinical in utero infection and long-term silent health sequelae (e.g., molecular pathology which is difficult to identify with diagnostic tests in clinical settings) in offspring in the absence of congenital Zika syndrome are not reported. While postnatal ZIKV infection in macaque infants resulted in altered emotional reactivity to acute stress [14] , the evidence is still lacking for the cumulative impact of subclinical in utero ZIKV infection and postnatal environmental insults on health sequelae in offspring. This knowledge is important because secondary insults during postnatal life can unmask consequences of in utero acquired silent pathology [15, 16] .",

We and others have recently developed a fetal pig model which reproduces key aspects of in utero ZIKV infection in humans with persistent infection in the fetal brain, fetal membranes, and placenta [17] [18] [19] . Similarly to human and mouse infections [32, 33] , outcomes of infection in the porcine model depend on the gestational stage. Zika virus inoculation at the early stage of fetal development (25 gestation days, gd; the total duration of porcine gestation is 114 days) resulted in fetal death [19] . In contrast, fetuses infected at the mid-stage of development (50 gd) did not show brain lesions 28 and 60 days later [18, 19] .",

In utero ZIKV exposure caused maternal infection as indicated by virus-specific IgG Ab in maternal plasma (Fig 2J; S1D Table) . Most probably, maternal infection was transient because maternal blood plasma samples were free for ZIKV RNA at all five sampling time-points as determined by RT-qPCR (S1B Table) . Moreover, in our previous studies, where we induced more severe in utero infection with higher viral doses, maternal endometrium and lymph nodes were free from ZIKV [18, 19, 37 ]. Next, we determined whether ZIKV replicated in fetuses and persisted in offspring. ZIKV-specific IgG Abs were detected in A porcine uterus has multiple fetuses (on average pigs have 14-16 fetuses) with each fetus possessing individual amniotic membrane and placenta. Two fetuses in each pregnant pig were directly inoculated (I) with ZIKV. See S1 Video for ultrasound-guided inoculation. Afterward, ZIKV spreads (II) between siblings and causes productive infection in (1) amniotic membranes, (2) placenta, and (3) fetal brains of directly inoculated and trans-infected not-manipulated fetuses [17] [18] [19] 37 ]. (C) Body weight, (D) body weight gain, (E) brain weight, and (F) brain/body weight ratio in control and ZIKV-exposed offspring. Solid lines represent mean values.

ZIKV-specific in situ hybridization in the placenta (sampled at birth) from control (E) and ZIKV (F) litters. Positive cells were found in a sample from pig #335.

See S1B Table for individual values. ZIKV-specific Ab in offspring blood plasma detected by IPMA (J). All samples from the control litters were negative. Black dots-Ab titers in maternal blood. Offspring blood at birth was collected before first colostrum feeding. Offspring were subdivided into two subgroups based on ZIKV-specific serological status at birth: negative for Ab at birth-\"N\" and positive for Ab at birth-\"P.\" Solid lines represent mean values. The dotted line represents LOD. See S1C Table for blood plasma from a subset of newborns in all three exposed litters (Fig 2J; S1C Table) . In pigs, maternal Abs do not pass to porcine fetuses through the placenta [40] ; however, it is being transferred passively to offspring via colostrum. Blood plasma samples from all newborns were collected before first colostrum ingestion, and high Ab titers demonstrated productive fetal infection and subsequent in utero Ab responses (Fig 2J; S1C Table) . Two ZIKVspecific RT-qPCR assays did not show viral RNA in the blood plasma, cerebrum, and cerebellum from all exposed and control piglets (including stillborn and weak piglets) (S1B Table) .",

Here, we defined whether subclinical in utero infection imposes IFN-\u03b1 sequelae in affected offspring. Within 21 days after birth, IFN-\u03b1 (Fig 3A) as well as IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-17A, TGF-\u03b2, TNF, IFN-\u03b2, and IFN-\u03b3 levels (at birth) remained below or at the detection limit in control and ZIKV-exposed piglets. The same levels in both offspring groups suggest that maternal IFN-\u03b1 (which could be transferred with milk within the first 21 days of life) equally affected offspring in both groups during the nursing period. Two ZIKV piglets, however, showed an increase in IFN-\u03b1 levels already at 21 days (at weaning-separation of mother from offspring) (Fig 3A) . While piglets from both control and ZIKV litters had detectable IFN-\u03b1 levels at 32 days, 19% of ZIKV piglets showed considerably increased levels of IFN-\u03b1 in their blood plasma (Fig 3A; S1C Table) . Next, we analyzed IFN-\u03b1 responses in offspring subdivided into two subgroups based on ZIKV-specific serological status at birth: negative for Ab at birth-\"N\" and positive for Ab at birth-\"P,\" (Fig 2J; S1C Table) . Remarkably, the increased IFN-\u03b1 levels were mostly attributed to the P subgroup with high ZIKV-specific Ab titers at birth (Fig 3B) . IFN-\u03b1 levels in the P subgroup were significantly higher than in the control group and N subgroup, indicating that IFN-\u03b1 increase may correlate with the serological status in offspring at birth. Maternal IFN-\u03b1 likely did not affect increased IFN-\u03b1 responses in ZIKV offspring at 32 days because maternal blood IFN-\u03b1 levels in ZIKV litters were lower or equal to that in control litters (P \ufffd 0.23) (the same was observed in colostrum, P = 0.4; S1D Table) and did not change significantly throughout the study (S2 Fig) . Moreover, the IFN-\u03b1 increase in offspring was detected at 32 days, eleven days after separation of piglets from mothers. In addition, maternal IFN-\u03b1 is unlikely to affect fetuses and offspring as it does not cross through the human [41] or porcine placenta [18, 42] . All of other eleven tested cytokines did not show the increase (Fig  3C; S1E Table) , suggesting specific IFN-\u03b1 pathology.",

Maternal blood levels of these cytokines were lower in the ZIKV group (although the difference was not statistically significant) (S2 Fig) that could potentially contribute to the lower cytokine levels in offspring. Previously described markers of maternal immune activation which may affect fetal health, IL-6 [43] and IL-17A [44] in the ZIKV group were lower or equal to that in control litters (P \ufffd 0.47); these data are in agreement with findings in pregnant women with acute ZIKV infection [45] and mice [12] . Also, IL-6 and IL-17A levels in ZIKV group did not change significantly throughout the experiment (S2 Overall, these data suggest that subclinical in utero ZIKV infection, without active maternal infection and changes in maternal cytokines, may specifically affect IFN-\u03b1 response in offspring.",

In contrast, piglets affected with subclinical in utero infection showed dramatic, up to a 31-fold decrease (6.8\u00b18.5) in blood plasma IFN-\u03b1 levels (Fig 4A) . This abrupt decrease in peripheral IFN-\u03b1 was demonstrated by a considerable proportion of ZIKV-affected offspring and did not depend on the initial IFN-\u03b1 level before stress induction. For example, ZIKV-affected offspring with exceptionally high IFN-\u03b1 levels before mixing test showed similar or even lower IFN-\u03b1 levels as in other groupmates after the mixing test (S1C Table, sow #409, piglet #7; sow #109, piglets #8 and #10; sow #335, piglets #2 and #12). Also, the decrease was observed not only in offspring with increased IFN-\u03b1 levels. ZIKV-affected piglets which initially had IFN-\u03b1 levels comparable to control piglets also showed a dramatic decrease after the mixing test (S1C Table: sow #409, piglet #13; sow #109, piglet #5; sow #335, piglets #5, #8 and #10). Next, we analyzed IFN-\u03b1 responses in offspring subdivided into two subgroups based on ZIKV-specific serological status at birth (Fig 4B; S1C Table) . ZIKV offspring in both P and N subgroups showed a statistically significant decrease in blood plasma IFN-\u03b1 levels (Fig 4B) . In sharp contrast, stress did not induce a significant decrease in other tested cytokines (0.96-1.38 mean fold change, Fig 4C; S1E Table) . No difference in IFN-\u03b1 shutdown was observed between serological (N and P; P = 0.12) and sex (P = 0.29) subgroups.",

On a global transcriptional level, gene expression differed considerably between PFC samples from ZIKV-affected and control offspring (S3A and S3B Fig; S2A Table) . Functional set enrichment of Gene Ontology (GO) biological processes also showed significant effects in brains of ZIKV offspring (Fig 5; S2B Table) . Specifically, genes with altered expression in the PFC of virus-affected offspring were positively enriched for processes related to cell death (29 GO pathways related to apoptosis and necrosis; false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted P < 0.1, S2B Table) , cytokine responses and immunity (61 GO pathways; FDR-adjusted P < 0.1, S2B Table) and organ/tissue morphogenesis, development, and regeneration (130 GO pathways; FDR-adjusted P < 0.1, S2B Table) . Whereas a large set of biological processes involved in neuronal function, i.e., synaptic transmission, GABAergic signaling, calcium ion regulation, cerebral cortex neuron differentiation, and others, were negatively enriched (64 GO pathways; FDR-adjusted P < 0.1, S2B Table) (Fig 5) . More stringent analyses of GO biological pathways related to neuronal and cell death pathways with FDR-adjusted P < 0.05 is represented in Fig 6.

In support of the observed altered transcriptional profile of corticosteroid-responsive genes, fetuses showed significantly elevated in utero cortisol levels during persistent ZIKV infection [19] . To find out whether transcriptional and hormonal in utero cortisol disbalance associated with subclinical infection imposes sequelae in offspring, we measured cortisol concentrations in hair, a well-established test to assess chronic stress throughout the lifespan [46] . The cortisol levels were higher in ZIKV piglets (S3E Fig; S1F Table) providing considerable support of transcriptional findings in affected offspring. A previous study in rhesus macaques demonstrated that even moderate increase in mean hair cortisol levels (1.59 times) is indicative of chronic stress [47] . The difference in porcine offspring, however, was not statistically significant (mean-1.27 times; P = 0.17). Thus, the relation between subclinical in utero ZIKV infection and chronic stress in offspring remains to be further confirmed.",

A considerable number of upregulated and downregulated GO processes (Fig 7B; S2H-S2J Table) , including neuronal and behavioral processes (Fig 7C; S2J Table) , were also shared between N and P subgroups, which is likely reflective of the similar gene expression profiles.

            "text": "Next, we analyzed molecular pathology in female and male offspring affected with subclinical in utero ZIKV infection. Female and male offspring showed a distinct transcriptional signature in the PFC (Fig 8A; S2K and S2L Table) . The considerably larger number of upregulated pathways in female offspring represented by developmental, differentiation, morphogenesis, cell migration, transcription, catabolic, cell adhesion/junction, signaling, and tissue remodeling processes (Fig 8B) , may signify more intensive compensatory responses to sequelae of in utero infection. While females and males shared 118 enriched biological processes (S2M Table) , considerably larger loss of affected neuronal and behavior pathways (FDR-adjusted P < 0.05) was observed in males (Fig 8C) . Enrichment analysis of significantly altered processes also attributed neuronal and behavioral pathways to male offspring (Fig 8B and  Fig 8D) . This suggests a greater loss of neuronal function in males, which is in a strong agreement with more prominent ZIKV-induced neurocognitive pathology in male mouse offspring [12]. Although humans and pigs have different placentation types (hemochorial and epitheliochorial, respectively) that prevents studies on mechanisms of virus and Ab transmission from mother to fetus, a fetal placental mesenchyme in pigs has all major cell types found in the human fetal side of the placenta (chorionic plate) and performs the same fundamental functions [48] [49] [50] . Similar to replication in the human placenta [51], ZIKV replicates in the porcine fetal placental mesenchyme [18, 37] . Also, we have recently demonstrated that similar to human placental infection [51] , ZIKV infection in the porcine placental mesenchyme is associated with the increased number of CD163-positive cells [37] . Thus, to provide independent support for the sex-specific pattern of transcriptional responses to ZIKV infection, we profiled the whole genome expression in placental samples persistently infected with ZIKV (S1B Table) . We observed that on a global transcriptional level, gene expression signature in the infected fetal placental samples also exhibited the considerable sex-specific pattern (Fig 9A;  S2N -S2P Table) . After correcting gene expression data for sex the principal component analysis showed that while female and male control samples were grouped close to each other, ZIKV-infected samples had a strong sex-specific separation indicating a strong dependency of ZIKV-induced transcriptional changes on animal sex. Zika virus infection may cause discordant clinical outcomes in human dizygotic twins, ranging from severe disease to asymptomatic infection, and different whole-genome transcriptional responses in neuronal progenitor cells of twins [52, 53] . In accordance, among females, we found three low-responders which grouped very closely with control samples (Fig 9A; S2N Table) . Other three samples were high-responders (Fig 9A; S2O Table) . Non-responder female samples were from the same litter (#109). Interestingly, both low-and high-responder subsets had the high placental viral loads (low-responders: 4.74-5.40 log 10 ZIKV RNA copies/g, high-responders: 4.74-6.02 log 10 ZIKV RNA copies/g; S1B Table) . The number of differentially expressed genes in ZIKV-positive placental samples was considerably higher than in ZIKV-positive brain samples, which is in agreement with ongoing productive placental infection (Fig 2I; S1B Table) . The high number of altered genes in both female and male samples is also in agreement with in vitro RNAseq studies in placental cells [54] and in vivo studies in human cells [55] . The higher number of affected genes in samples from males (Fig 9B and 9C ; S2O and S2P Table) might suggest a stronger potential for pathological outcomes in males than in females [12] . A large set of affected biological processes (FDR-adjusted P < 0.05) represented blood vessel and endothelial development, proliferation, migration, and morphogenesis (Fig 9D, S2Q Table) . This is in agreement with studies in mice [56] and rhesus macaques [57] where ZIKV-induced vascular pathology was described. Additionally, biological pathways related to actin, extracellular matrix, and syncytium formation were enriched (S2Q Table) .",

            "text": "Based on our previous fetal studies and present findings in offspring, we suggest a link between the fetal IFN-\u03b1 pathways reprogrammed during in utero ZIKV infection [18, 37] and altered IFN-\u03b1 responses in offspring (Figs 3 and 4) . The hypothesis of fetal origins of adult disease was first described by David Barker, who proposed that disruptions to the in utero environment during fetal development program increase risks for disease during adulthood [62] . Subsequently, many studies confirmed that adverse effects during fetal development may program postnatal immune and neurological pathology which can be transferred across generations [63-66]. Our data also suggest age-specific IFN-\u03b1 responses in the porcine model of subclinical in utero ZIKV infection. During fetal development, IFN-\u03b1 levels in fetal blood and amniotic fluids are increased for several weeks after in utero inoculation [18] , with a subsequent drop to undetectable levels at around 60 days after inoculation (S4 Fig). Afterward, offspring show elevated levels of IFN-\u03b1 at around 21-32 days after birth (S4 Fig). In support of our findings, the age-specific nature of in utero acquired neurodevelopmental, behavioral, cognitive, and neuroimmune defects has been experimentally demonstrated [16, 36, [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] . For example, immune activation during mouse pregnancy causes transiently elevated brain cytokine levels in offspring at birth, decreased levels postnatally, and then elevated levels during adulthood [67] . Presumably, maturation of the immune and endocrine systems is required to trigger prenatally acquired neurodevelopmental pathology in offspring [72] [73] [74] . Factors determining the age-specific nature of the in utero acquired ZIKV-induced systemic immunopathology remain to be defined. While cerebrum and cerebellum were negative for ZIKV, we cannot fully exclude persistent infection in offspring because lymphoid tissues were not tested; however, in our previous study newborn piglets inoculated with 10 5.8 TCID 50 ZIKV intracerebrally, intradermally, or intraperitoneally cleared the virus from lymphoid tissues within seven days [75] . Additional studies, are required for comprehensive testing of multiple organs for persistent ZIKV infection in offspring affected with subclinical in utero infection and its connection with altered IFN-\u03b1 responses.",

Here, we used the mixing test, a validated approach to model social confrontation in pigs [76] [77] [78] [79] . Mixing a pair of unfamiliar individuals in a new environment induces stress, to which animals respond with physiological changes. The test induces cumulative stress from the separation of littermates, confrontation with a novel environment (a mixing chamber), confrontation with the unfamiliar conspecific and aggression (fight)-induced stress (S2 Video). Possible effects of sex, body weight, and familiarity with the environment, which may influence aggressive/social behavior and outcomes of the test [76] , were excluded by mixing piglets of the same sex and similar weights in unfamiliar mixing chambers. We demonstrated that combined exposure to subclinical prenatal ZIKV infection and postnatal social stress induces synergistic pathological effect promoting abrupt IFN-\u03b1 shutdown in affected offspring. Further attempts to better understand silent pathology and develop alleviative interventions in ZIKV-affected offspring should take into account synergistic interactions of multiple environmental insults.",

Abrupt nature of both phenomena, however, is most probably attributed to changes in peripheral blood cells. Because blood monocytes and dendritic cells are the primary sources of IFN-\u03b1 in humans [80, 81] and pigs [82] , these cells should be studied in terms of in utero acquired ZIKV-induced IFN-\u03b1 pathology. We also suggest studying hematopoietic stem cells in affected fetuses and offspring since excessive IFN-\u03b1 may impact proliferation and reconstituting ability in hematopoietic stem cells and stem cell niche [83] [84] [85] . Interestingly, in contrast to the altered molecular signature in the brain and placenta, the increase of IFN-\u03b1 in porcine offspring blood did not have the sex-specific nature, suggesting that brain/placenta-specific phenomenon and described IFN-\u03b1 immunopathology in blood most probably have different mechanistic background.",

            "text": "To our knowledge, type I IFN profiles in human fetuses and offspring affected with ZIKV infection were not addressed, yet. However, it has been shown that acute ZIKV infection is associated with increased IFN-\u03b1 levels in the blood sera of pregnant women [45] . Human infections with other related flaviviruses (dengue virus and West Nile virus) were also associated with increased IFN-\u03b1 levels in the blood plasma/sera [86, 87] . The relevance of IFN-\u03b1 sequelae identified in porcine offspring affected with subclinical in utero ZIKV infection to sequelae in humans remains to be established. If ZIKV-induced IFN-\u03b1 sequelae persist in human offspring, it might have dramatic health consequences. Excessive IFN-\u03b1 levels were previously associated with severe viral infection [88] , immune dysfunction [89] , major depressive disorder [90, 91] , and dementia [92] . Importantly, cognitive impairment, severe neurological sequelae, seizures, prefrontal hypometabolism, and psychiatric syndromes were described in adult and pediatric patients treated with therapeutic doses of IFN-\u03b1 [93] [94] [95] [96] [97] [98] . Affected IFN\u03b1 responses during stress, specifically, the stress-induced IFN-\u03b1 shutdown, might also influence the susceptibility of offspring to other infections. Interestingly, we recently demonstrated that similar to ZIKV infection [18, 37] , porcine circovirus 2 (a DNA virus of Circoviridae family which causes pathology and death in fetuses) in utero infection is associated with consistently increased fetal IFN-\u03b1 levels (PCV2-positive fetuses-61.36\u00b112.36 pg/ml of blood plasma; PCV2-negative-below the detection limit). This proof of concept study is in agreement with a hypothesis that type I IFNs is a common culprit of severe congenital viral infections and associated grave complications in fetuses [34] . In addition, we suggest that in utero inflammation induced by subclinical TORCH infections [99] [100] [101] [102] [103] [104] [105] [106] [107] [108] , including ZIKV, may evoke type I IFN pathology in offspring which can be targeted to reduce long-term sequelae.",

            "text": "Offspring brains were negative for ZIKV, suggesting that transcriptional changes in the PFC may be a persistent representation of earlier ZIKV replication in their brains during subclinical in utero infection. We believe that ZIKV caused brain infection in at least some offspring during their in utero fetal life and was subsequently cleared. In support, first, ZIKVspecific Abs in newborns detected at birth (P subgroup) (Fig 2J) postulated productive infection in developing fetuses during in utero life and most probably in fetal brains because fetal brain is the target for ZIKV in the porcine model [18, 37] . Second, when porcine litters inoculated at the mid of gestation, ZIKV replicates in the fetal brain for at least 28 days [18, 37] and cleared at 60 days [19] . The virus clearance from fetal brains of rhesus monkeys has been also suggested [109] . Third, affected type I IFN processes (Fig 5) and \"defense response to virus\" (FDR-adjusted P = 0.001) and \"response to virus\" (FDR-adjusted P = 0.009) (S2B Table) in brains of offspring, strongly suggest previous infection in the fetal brain. Finally, in offspring of the N subgroup, the lack of virus-specific Abs at birth (Fig 2J) does not rule out earlier subclinical fetal and fetal brain infection because ZIKV can persist in brains of porcine fetuses negative for Abs [18, 37] . Even if ZIKV offspring in the N subgroup did not have virus replication in their internal organs during in utero life, most of them had infection in their individual amniotic membranes and placenta collected at birth (Fig 2I; S1B and S1C Table) . Fetuses and fetal membranes form a conceptus, a fetal-fetal membrane unit, because fetal, amniotic membrane, and placental blood circulations are intimately interconnected. Replicating in individual amniotic membranes and placenta during persistent in utero infection, ZIKV may distantly affect the developing fetal brain. This was previously described in herpesvirus and malaria infections in mice and humans [110, 111] , where pathogens did not reach the fetus, but the inflammatory process in the placenta affected the normal fetal development. The role of immune responses to ZIKV at the maternal-fetal interface in birth defects has been also suggested [112] . In strong agreement, numerous biological processes, including vascular processes, were affected in the porcine placenta persistently infected with ZIKV (Fig 9D) . Also, offspring of both N and P subgroups had the altered whole-genome expression signature in brains (Fig 7) . In the fetal pig model of ZIKV infection, the cumulative negative effects originated in the developing fetal brain, fetal membranes, and placenta are also possible. Alternative animal model approaches are required to discriminate the effects of local ZIKV replication in the fetal brain and placenta on health in offspring.",

            "text": "Using RNA-seq, we defined sex-specific transcriptional changes in brains of affected porcine offspring, and subsequently confirmed sex-specific responses in infected placental samples. It is well-recognized that male fetuses are more vulnerable in affected pregnancies, with more adverse long-term outcomes occurring after birth [66, 113] . Accordingly, ZIKV-affected male piglets demonstrated more dramatic molecular pathology both in the brain and placenta. In the brains, most affected biological processes related to neuropathology were represented by male offspring. In the placenta, a higher number of differentially expressed genes was showed by male offspring (Fig 9B and 9C) . Our findings are in agreement with a study in mice, where male offspring affected with mild ZIKV infection showed higher risks of developing neurocognitive disorders [12] . Moreover, in a recent study on the prospective human cohort of ZIKV-exposed children, male gender was identified as a potential predictor of delayed developmental alterations [7] . Observed behavioral differences between groups during social stress also had a sex-specific trend (Fig 10) . Zika virus-affected male offspring showed more aggressive social behavior than affected female offspring as represented by a higher percentage of initiated and won fights (Fig 10) . Altered behavior conveyed by ZIKV-affected porcine offspring during stress is in high agreement with findings in macaques [14] , where postnatal ZIKV infection of infants resulted in altered functional connectivity between brain areas involved in emotional behavior and arousal functions, as well as in distinct alterations in the species-typical emotional reactivity to acute stress. It is difficult to compare our sex-specific data in pigs with the macaque model study due to different experimental approaches [14] . While ZIKV-affected offspring showed the trend to behavioral differences (Fig 10) , the statistical significance was not attained in both female and male animals, which is not surprising in the context of subclinical in utero infection and silent pathology. Delayed neurodevelopmental abnormalities identified at the only second year of life have been described in the most recent study on the prospective human cohort of ZIKV-exposed children [7] . Thus, to further confirm and better understand behavioral sequelae in the porcine model, its functional connection to molecular pathology in the brain and placenta, and the relevance of the model to study delayed childhood neurodevelopment described in affected human offspring [7] , future experiments should utilize the larger sample size, the longer observational periods, and a broader panel of standardized methods for behavioral and cognitive research in pigs [114] [115] [116] [117] [118] [119] .",

All samples were negative for anti-PCV2 Ab. Pregnant pigs were housed at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization-International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) level 3 facilities. Pregnant pigs were randomly assigned into control (three animals) and ZIKV (three animals) groups and housed in identical, but isolated rooms. Housing conditions and diet were the same for all sows and offspring.",

Briefly, to establish subclinical infection, we manipulated only two conceptuses per pregnant pig. Two conceptuses from three experimental pigs (pig #109, #335, #409) were inoculated intraperitoneally + intra-amniotic (IP+IA; 100 \u03bcl+100 \u03bcl) with 10 5 TCID 50 (tissue culture infectious dose with 50% endpoint) of ZIKV. Two conceptuses from three control pigs (pigs #122, #179, #720) were inoculated with virus-free media. For precise inoculation, we used an ultrasound-guided technique which verifies fetal viability before and after injection by visualizing heart beating (S1 Video). Two fetuses close to the uterine bifurcation (S1 Fig) were directly inoculated. This fetal location was selected in order to maximize the virus spread within the uterus. Fetuses in the only one uterine horn were inoculated to reduce manipulation.",

Then immediately after the mixing test, we collected blood samples as described above. We used video recordings to score fighting activities (S2 Video). A fight, i.e., a 'bout' of fighting, was defined as a period of time lasting at least 10 s during which (i) two pigs showed close physical contact and (ii) five or more head knocks or bites were shown by one or both pigs. A fight was deemed to have ended when aggressive acts ceased after the retreat of one or both pigs and pigs were staying separated for 60 s or more. For every fight, we scored the initiator, i.e., the pig that first bites or head knocks. In addition, we recorded the winner and loser of every fight. The pig that first stopped fighting, retreated, turned away from its opponent or tried to flee was considered to be the loser of the fight. From these observations, we calculated the ratio of initiated fights and the ratio of winners within the group. Three blinded investigators performed analyses of behavioral data (S1G Table) . Observations were compared (initiators: Fleiss' kappa = 0.81, winners: Fleiss' kappa = 0.98) and averaged both in males and females [124] .",

Maternal cytokines levels between control and ZIKV groups and within groups were compared with Bonferroni-corrected repeated measures analysis of variance (rANOVA). IFN-\u03b1 levels in offspring blood plasma sampled at birth, 14, 21, and 32 days after birth were compared between control and ZIKV groups with Mann-Whitney U-test.",

IFN-\u03b1 levels in blood plasma sampled before and after the mixing test were compared between control and ZIKV groups by ANOVA with Tukey's post-test. We also assessed fold change between IFN-\u03b1 levels before and after the mixing test within N and P subgroups and in sex subgroups-Mann-Whitney U-test. In the mixing test, within each pair, we quantified a percentage of fights initiated and a percentage of fights won by control piglet or ZIKV piglet. The percentage of initiated and won fights-individually for males and females-were compared against the expected value (50% versus 50%) in control versus ZIKV groups with two-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Circles represent data from individual sows. Boxes represent the highest and lowest observations. A horizontal line inside the box is the mean. An asterisk ( \ufffd ) represents a statistically significant difference (P < 0.05) between control and ZIKV groups.

IFN\u03b1 levels (M\u00b1SE) were measured in the blood plasma of ZIKV-affected and control porcine fetuses and offspring. Data for the fetal period (at 78 gestation days, gd) were compiled from our published study [18] , where 53 virus-infected and 22 control fetuses were tested. Data for 110 gd are from study where 14 virus-infected and 16 control fetuses were tested (S1C Table) . Elevated IFN-\u03b1 levels at 78 gd were significantly higher in ZIKV infected fetuses (P = 0.0068, Mann-Whitney test) [18] . (TIF) S1 ",

Two fetuses (highlighted in red) in each pregnant pig were directly inoculated with ZIKV or control media. (C) Afterward, ZIKV spreads between siblings within the horn containing inoculated fetuses and between fetuses in the opposite horn.
