            "text": "Background: Existing standard non-molecular diagnostic methods such as viral culture and immunofluorescent (DFA) are time-consuming, labor intensive or limited sensitivity. Several multiplex molecular assays are costly. Therefore, there is a need for the development of a rapid and sensitive diagnosis of respiratory viral pathogens. Methods: A GeXP-based multiplex RT-PCR assay (GeXP assay) was developed to detect simultaneously sixteen different respiratory virus types/subtypes. Seventeen sets of chimeric primers were used to initiate the RT-PCR, and one pair of universal primers was used for the subsequent cycles of the RT-PCR. The specificity of the GeXP assay was examined with positive controls for each virus type/subtype. The sensitivity was evaluated by performing the assay on serial ten-fold dilutions of in vitro-transcribed RNA of all RNA viruses and the plasmids containing the Adv and HBoV target sequence. GeXP assay was further evaluated using 126 clinical specimens and compared with Luminex xTAG RVP Fast assay. Results: The GeXP assay achieved a sensitivity of 20-200 copies for a single virus and 1000 copies when all of the 16 pre-mixed viral targets were present. Analyses of 126 clinical specimens using the GeXP assay demonstrated that GeXP assay and the RVP Fast assay were in complete agreement for 109/126 (88.51%) of the specimens. GeXP assay was more sensitive than the RVP Fast assay for the detection of HRV and PIV3, and slightly less sensitive for the detection of HMPV, Adv, RSVB and HBoV. The whole process of the GeXP assay for the detection of 12 samples was completed within 2.5 hours. Conclusions: In conclusion, the GeXP assay is a rapid, cost-effective, sensitive, specific and high throughput method for the detection of respiratory virus infections.",

Viral culture remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of respiratory viruses because of its broad spectrum and high specificity. However, viral culture is time-consuming and has a low sensitivity for the detection of some respiratory viruses that have fastidious growth requirements [5, 6] . Immunofluorescent staining is fast, but the assay sensitivity and the availability of antisera can be limiting factors [5, 6] . With the development of rapid molecular techniques, molecular assays, especially in a multiplex format, have been accepted as tests of choice for broad spectrum detection of respiratory viruses. Several multiplex assays are available commercially such as xTAG RVP from Luminex [7, 8] , Multicode-PLx RVP from EraGen Biosciences [9] , and ResPlex II from Qiagen [10] . However, all of them are based on a liquid-phase bead-based array technology to implement the detection, which has increased the cost and the implementation time of the whole assays.",

The GeXP genetic analysis system is a new multitarget, high throughput detection platform, and its application in the differential detection of pandemic Influenza A H1N1 virus and seasonal Influenza A virus was reported recently by our laboratory [12] . To further reduce the assay time and avoid contamination, a one-step multitarget RT-PCR was performed in one tube rather than multiplex two-step RT-PCRs in separate tubes [12] would be preferred. To develop a one-step GeXP assay, several commercial one-step RT-PCR kits from different companies (Omega, Bio-Rad, Qiagen and Invitrogen) were tested in our preliminary experiments.

The biphasic PCR parameters of the TSP allow a multiplex PCR to be performed under standardized PCR conditions, and therefore do not require optimization of each individual PCR assay. The optimal settings for three different denaturation temperatures and the amplification cycle conditions were determined in the current protocol. The chimeric primers consisted of a specific primer sequence fused to the universal primer sequence. The primers were designed to generate gene fragments with lengths between 140-340 bp. The amount of universal primers included in the RT-PCR was ten times that of the chimeric primers, so in the last 20 cycles of PCR, amplification was carried out predominantly by a single pair of universal primers, of which only the forward universal primer was labeled fluorescently. This should reduce the occurrence of preferential amplification in the reaction. Internal control primers were added to the reaction to ascertain whether the extraction and reverse-transcription steps of the assay were functioning correctly. Only 2 \u03bcl of the cy5-labeled PCR amplified fragments were separated by capillary electrophoresis based on size and detected by the GeXP system.",

The detection sensitivity for each virus in this study was similar to that of real-time PCR assays reported in recent years [18] [19] [20] . Analyses of 126 specimens using the GeXP assay and RVP Fast assay demonstrated that the GeXP assay had comparable sensitivity and specificity to the commercially available RVP Fast assay ( Table 2) . Discrepancies in detection results were found for HRV, PIV3, HMPV, Adv, RSV B and HBoV. All of the 9 specimens positive for PIV3 or HRV detected only by the GeXP assay were confirmed by independent PCR and sequencing to be true positives (data not shown), suggesting that the GeXP assay is more sensitive than the RVP Fast assay for the detection of HRV and PIV3. Because the HRV primers used in the RVP Fast assay were able to amplify both HRV and enterovirus, the three specimens positive for HRV detected only by the RVP Fast assay could actually be enteroviruses. All of the specimens positive for HRV detected by the GeXP assay were confirmed by sequencing as true HRV positives. Two of HMPV negative samples, 1 of Adv negative sample, 3 of RSVB negative samples and 4 of HBoV negative samples detected by the GeXP assay were positive by the RVP Fast assay. All of these negative samples had lower median florescence intensity (MFI) values (294-825) in the RVP Fast assay, suggesting that the GeXP assay has a slightly decrease sensitivity for the detection of HMPV, Adv, RSVB and HBoV. However, the difference was not significant (for HMPV, Adv, RSVB and HBoV, p = 0.5, 1, 0.25, 0.125, respectively, using McNemar's test; Kappa = 0.880, 0.943, 0.949, 0.864, respectively). The detection of coronaviruses (CoV HKU1, CoV NL63, CoV 229E and CoV OC43) by both assays was completely consistent between assays. The overall detection rate of the GeXP assay for each virus was comparable to that of the RVP Fast assay, demonstrating the high sensitivity and specificity of the GeXP assay in the analysis of clinical samples. It should be noted that there are not sufficient positive samples for FluA, sH1N1, FluB, PIV1,PIV2, CoV NL63, CoV 229E, CoV HKU1 and RSVA to determine meaningful statistics in our study. Due to the limited specimens available at this time, only preliminary findings were reported in this study. The detection rate for infections involving two or more viruses was similar for the GeXP assay (68/126) and the RVP Fast assay (66/ 126). Most occurrences of multiplex infections involved two of three viruses, HRV, RSVB and PIV3 (data not shown).",
