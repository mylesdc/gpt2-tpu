In Senegal, the network has recently been enhanced (i) to include epidemiological data from Dakar and other regions and (ii) to extend virological surveillance to other respiratory viruses. Epidemiological data from the sentinel sites is transmitted daily by mobile phone. The data include those for other febrile syndromes similar to influenza-like illnesses (ILI), corresponding to integrated approach. Also, clinical samples are randomly selected and analyzed for influenza and other respiratory viruses. There were 101,640 declared visits to the 11 sentinel sites between week 11-2012 and week 35-2013; 22% of the visits were for fever syndromes and 23% of the cases of fever syndrome were ILI. Influenza viruses were the second most frequent cause of ILI (20%), after adenoviruses (21%) and before rhinoviruses (18%) and enteroviruses (15%). Co-circulation and coinfection were frequent and were responsible for ILI peaks. The first months of implementation of the enhanced surveillance system confirmed that viruses other the influenza make large contributions to influenza-like illnesses. It is therefore important to consider these etiologies in the development of strategies to reduce respiratory infections. More informative tools and research studies are required to assess the burden of respiratory infections in developing countries.",

In Senegal, the National Influenza Center located in the Pasteur Institute of Dakar (IPD) was established in 1974 and has been part of the Global Influenza Surveillance Network (GISN) coordinated by the World Health Organization (WHO) since 1996 [2] . The WHO GISN provides virological information used in the process of selecting strains for the production of influenza vaccines [3] .

Consequently, the system is no longer limited to identifying the predominant circulating strains. It can also estimate the significance of ILI to health care activity, through syndromic surveillance.

However, none of the indicators are accurate measures of incidence. Indeed, although the new tools used by the 4S network since 2011 are convenient, the 4S network is still not yet able to evaluate the relative contribution of influenza and other respiratory viruses to disease burden, or child or adult mortality. Consequently, the influenza surveillance in Senegal could be improved by collecting complementary data. In particular, mortality data and more accurate incidence data would help assessments of the impact of influenza and the design of appropriate preventive strategies. Until such data are available, it difficult to justify the widespread use of influenza vaccine or other influenza control measures. Nevertheless, the health burden associated with influenza may be far greater in Africa than in developed countries, due to co-circulating tropical disease, immunosuppression and malnutrition [15] . Thus, the next step of the 4S network will be to collect data corresponding to hospital admissions for acute respiratory infection (ARI) and to ARI mortality. Hospital-based sentinel surveillance can provide substantial insights into the contribution of influenza infection to the global burden of disease [3] . A clear understanding of the epidemiology of severe influenza-associated disease is essential for decisions about vaccine recommendations. The 4S network will implement population-based sentinel surveillance, with reporting by mobile phone, to evaluate the incidence of the respiratory infections in the community [1]. Mobile phones have been available in Africa since the beginning of the XXI century are now widely used by the population; they may be useful to collect information through text messaging.",

As in Madagascar [16, 17] , pathogenic respiratory viruses were present in more than 70% of the samples collected from cases of ILI, and the involvement of non-influenza viruses was substantial: adenoviruses (22%), rhinoviruses (19%) and enteroviruses (15%) were the non-influenza viruses most frequently found. In Madagascar [16] , HMPV (25%) and RSV (21%) were the most common viruses after influenza viruses. In Tunisia [18] , the most common non-flu pathogen circulating in three seasons causing the lower respiratory tract infections especially in children was RSV (45%) but others viruses were also identifed: adenoviruses (20%) during season 2008-2009 or rhinoviruses (44%) during season 2009-2010. In 2009 in Cameron [19] , influenza virus and rhinovirus were the most commonly detected viruses. All these results emphasises the importance of countries being able to test for a suite of respiratory pathogens, not just influenza. However, further investigations are necessary for a better understanding of the annual circulation profile of these different respiratory viruses. Besides, the difference between sampling percentages according with age group shows the difficulty to analyze alone virological data, and highlights the need to link virological and epidemiological data to improve the sentinel surveillance systems. The results reported here are those for the entire network, but are difficult to interpret because most are from sentinel sites in Dakar, and very few are from sites that opened only recently. As more data is collected and becomes available, it will be possible to document the patterns and characteristics of fever syndromes and ILI, both nationally, and in the various regions.",
