Bat flies, in particular, are highly specialized obligate hematophagous ectoparasites that incidentally bite humans. Using nextgeneration sequencing, we discovered a novel ledantevirus (mononegaviral family Rhabdoviridae, genus Ledantevirus) in nycteribiid bat flies infesting pteropodid bats in western Uganda. Mitochondrial DNA analyses revealed that both the bat flies and their bat hosts belong to putative new species. The coding-complete genome of the new virus, named Kanyawara virus (KYAV), is only distantly related to that of its closest known relative, Mount Elgon bat virus, and was found at high titers in bat flies but not in blood or on mucosal surfaces of host bats. Viral genome analysis indicates unusually low CpG dinucleotide depletion in KYAV compared to other ledanteviruses and rhabdovirus groups, with KYAV displaying values similar to rhabdoviruses of arthropods. Our findings highlight the possibility of a yetto-be-discovered diversity of potentially pathogenic viruses in bat ectoparasites.",

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of bat flies yielded 0.11 \u00d7 10 6 to 1.59 \u00d7 10 6 reads per sample. After quality trimming, rhabdovirus-like sequences were detected in five bat flies, each from a different bat. These sequences mapped with low similarity to conserved regions of rhabdovirus genomes (order Mononegavirales, family Rhabdoviridae). De novo assembly yielded a contiguous sequence of 10,843 nt in one bat fly sample (MPK004), with five open reading frames matching the canonical rhabdovirus genome organization ( Fig. 1) 10 . Subsequent analysis of bat fly reads mapped 448 to 206,726 individual reads to this sequence, yielding coding-complete genomes in three other bat fly samples. Rhabdovirus coding genome sequences from bat flies of individual bats were 99.9% and 99.8% similar at the nucleotide and deduced amino acid levels, respectively. Viral read frequencies in the five positive bat fly samples ranged from 8,611 to 262,258 per million, with coverage ranging from 5-fold to 3,632-fold.",

Application of this method at this sequencing depth is approximately as sensitive as real-time quantitative PCR 11 ; therefore, bat sera could confidently be classified as negative for the virus. For further confirmation, however, we also tested all bat sera by PCR, and results were congruent with NGS results (i.e., all bat sera tested negative for the new rhabdovirus). Oral and urogenital swab samples from all bats also tested negative for the new rhabdovirus by PCR.",

We named this virus Kanyawara virus (KYAV) after the village closest to the roost from which the bats were sampled. Sequence similarity between KYAV and other ledanteviruses based on concatenated, codon-based alignments of the canonical N, P, G, M, and L genes ranged from 62.4% (Mount Elgon bat virus) to 47.6% (Y ngji\u0101 tick virus 2) at the nucleotide level and from 59.3% (Mount Elgon bat virus) to 38.7% (Kern Canyon virus) at the deduced amino acid level, respectively. KYAV fulfills four of the five criteria of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) Rhabdoviridae Study Group for classification in the genus Ledantevirus: A) the deduced amino acid sequence of the KYAV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) diverges >7% from that of other ledanteviruses (KYAV:Mount Elgon bat virus = 35.2%); B) the deduced amino acid sequence of the KYAV glycoprotein (G) diverges 15% from that of other ledanteviruses (KYAV:Mount Elgon bat virus = 49.0%); C) KYAV has the same genome organization as other ledanteviruses (Fig. 1) ; and E) KYAV occupies a different ecological niche than other ledanteviruses. Criterium D (\"can be distinguished in serological tests\") could not be evaluated due to the absence of a replicating KYAV isolate, but the high divergence of the sequence of KYAV G, the only ledantevirion surface protein, strongly suggests that KYAV is also serologically distinct 14 . Table S2 ). Figure 3 shows average CpG depletion by virus group and gene. CpG depletion was least pronounced for the insect-only sigmaviruses 15, 16 , but more pronounced in the mammal-specific lyssaviruses 17, 18 . These CpG variation patterns were generally consistent across the five canonical rhabdovirus genes N, P, G, M, and L within each virus group (Fig. 3 Table S2 ). Variation in CpG frequency also differed significantly among rhabdovirus groups (Levine's W statistic = 3.29; 6 degrees of freedom; P = 0.008). The coefficient of variation in CpG depletion was lowest for sigmaviruses and lyssaviruses and notably higher for the other virus groups (Fig. 3) .",

Viruses of the genus Sigmavirus, for example, are transmitted only vertically among insects 20, 26 , whereas viruses of the genera Ephemerovirus, Tibrovirus, and Vesiculovirus may infect mammals but typically are vectored by biting midges, mosquitoes, sandflies, or ticks 10, 19 . Similarly, plant rhabdoviruses (genera Cytorhabdovirus and Nucleorhabdovirus) are vectored by aphids, leafhoppers, or plant hoppers, and even fish rhabdoviruses transmitted directly through water may have associations with arthropods 10, 19, 27 . Rhabdovirus genome fragment integration into genomes of arthropods belonging to widely divergent lineages also supports a long history of rhabdovirus-arthropod coevolution 19, 24, 28 .",

KYAV is a new putative member of the rhabdoviral genus Ledantevirus, sorting within subgroup B, which contains bat-associated viruses ( Fig. 2A) 12 . The discovery of KYAV in nycteribiid bat flies suggests that KYAV could be a vector-borne virus, with bat flies as vectors. However, we did not find KYAV in the blood or on mucosal surfaces of the bats from which the bat flies were collected. This negative finding may indicate limited or transient viremia in bats, as is characteristic of, for instance, rabies virus [30] [31] [32] ; however, other rhabdoviruses have been recovered from mucosal surfaces of bats 9, 33 . Alternatively, KYAV may be an insect-specific virus that does not infect bats. The detection of KYAV in 5 out of 6 (83%) bat flies sampled is consistent with this notion because infection rates of arthropod vectors with vector-borne viruses tend to be much lower than this rate, typically below 10% 34 .",

However, our analysis of mitochondrial DNA sequences placed these bats as outgroup to Angolan soft-furred bats. They appear to be novel members of the Epomophorinae in the genus Myonycteris divergent enough to merit consideration as members of a separate species. This assessment is preliminary as it presently relies only on a mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I and cytochrome C phylogeny (Fig. 2C) . Morphological characterization and additional genetic analyses will be required to confirm this taxonomy. Nevertheless, the discovery of a putative new pteropodid bat is surprising given that Kibale National Park is one of the most extensively researched forested areas in Africa 42, 43 .",

Therefore, identifying unknown taxa of megabats would be important for understanding the true diversity of their ectoparasites and associated viruses. Unfortunately, limited biological material and a remote field location in the present case precluded other desirable analyses, such as serologic assessment of bats or other mammals. Future studies using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or western blots targeting the major antigenic proteins of KYAV (likely N and/or G) might help elucidate the ecology of this virus in bats and animals of other species. Such studies may also resolve whether the absence of circulating KYAV in the tested bat sera reflects transient viremia, as we speculate, or lack of infection.",

Novel, divergent rhabdoviruses have also been found in apparently healthy people in Africa, suggesting unknown pathways of zoonotic transmission 46 .
