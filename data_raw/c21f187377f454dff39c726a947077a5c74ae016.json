            "text": "The Florida manatee (Trichechus manatus latirotris) is a threatened aquatic mammal in United States coastal waters. Over the past decade, the appearance of papillomavirusinduced lesions and viral papillomatosis in manatees has been a concern for those involved in the management and rehabilitation of this species. To date, three manatee papillomaviruses (TmPVs) have been identified in Florida manatees, one forming cutaneous lesions (TmPV1) and two forming genital lesions (TmPV3 and TmPV4). We identified DNA sequences with the potential to form G-quadruplex structures (G4) across the three genomes. G4 were located on both DNA strands and across coding and non-coding regions on all TmPVs, offering multiple targets for viral control. Although G4 have been identified in several viral genomes, including human PVs, most research has focused on canonical structures comprised of three Gtetrads. In contrast, the vast majority of sequences we identified would allow the formation of non-canonical structures with only two G-tetrads. Our biophysical analysis confirmed the formation of G4 with parallel topology in three such sequences from the E2 region. Two of the structures appear comprised of multiple stacked two G-tetrad structures, perhaps serving to increase structural stability. Computational analysis demonstrated enrichment of G4 sequences on all TmPVs on the reverse strand in the E2/E4 region and on both strands in the L2 region. Several G4 sequences occurred at similar regional locations on all PVs, most notably on the reverse strand in the E2 region. In other cases, G4 were identified at similar regional locations only on PVs forming genital lesions. On all TmPVs, G4 sequences were located in the non-coding region near putative E2 binding sites. Together, these findings suggest that G4 are possible regulatory elements in TmPVs. /). Support for G-quadruplex structures (G4) are four-stranded, inter-and intramolecular structures formed from guanine-rich DNA and RNA sequences. The sequences can be identified by four tracts of two or more guanine bases that are separated by one or more nucleotides of varying composition. The sequences fold to form stacks of G-tetrads, planar structures composed of four guanine bases held together by Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds (Fig 1) [1] . The stacked G-tetrads are connected by loops which vary in size and sequence composition. The number of G-tetrads, the loop lengths, and the loop sequence composition are all known to affect the stability of the folded structure, with higher numbers of G-tetrads and shorter loop lengths tending toward greater stability [2, 3] .",

G4 located in the promoter region of genes act as transcriptional regulators [6] while those found in intronic and exonic regions play a role in alternative splicing [7, 8] .

This analysis was motivated by work in our laboratory suggesting the formation of a G4 during initial sequencing of one of three manatee papillomavirus genomes. Interestingly, the sequences creating difficulty were capable of forming only non-canonical structures with two G-tetrads. In our computational analysis, we found more potential structures comprised of two G-tetrads than was found in the previous study of G4 in HPV where researchers searched only for structures with three G-tetrads. In our biophysical analysis, we found that sequences in the E2 coding region where we encountered sequencing difficulty were capable of forming G4 with a parallel topology, and in fact, they appeared to be forming multiple two G-tetrad structures stacked upon one another. In the following paragraphs, we briefly describe the ecological relevance of G4 in papillomaviruses infecting manatees and provide evidence for the biological relevance of G4 with two Gtetrads to further justify extending our search to include these structures.",

Its population declined for a variety of reasons, not the least of which was that its gentle, slow-moving nature made it vulnerable to injury from boat propellers. Efforts at restoring the population have been successful to the extent that the species was downlisted to threatened status in 2016. However, in the midst of these efforts, animals undergoing rehabilitation frequently showed signs of high sensitivity to environmental stress, one sign being the development of cutaneous or mucosotropic genital papillomatous lesions. Some animals, both in captivity and in the wild, showed antibody titers indicating the presence or exposure to Trichechus manatus PV 1 (TmPV1), a virus first characterized in our laboratory [29] [30] [31] . More recently, genital lesions appeared in a single Florida manatee used as a surrogate animal for manatee rehabilitation at the Puerto Rico Manatee Conservation Center (PRMCC), and DNA sequencing, also performed in our laboratory, indicated the presence of two new PVs, Trichechus manatus PV 3 (TmPV3) and 4 (TmPV4) [31, 32] . These are the first known genital mucosotropic PVs in a manatee, presenting a novel sexually transmitted viral medical condition in this species should the virus spread in wild populations, where its presence is not currently known but suspected to occur naturally in the wild populations of the species throughout its range.",

A non-coding region holds the origin of replication and at least a couple of promotor sites. Much of what is known about the function of these sites comes from molecular biological research on human PVs [33] . E1 and E2 proteins form a complex that initiates viral replication at the origin, resulting in amplification of the virus. E2 also functions as a negative regulator of E6 and E7, two coding regions that stimulate cell growth and function as oncogenes in human PVs.

We reasoned this was possibly a G4, given that a GGA repeat would be a sequence pattern capable of G4 formation. It is important to note, however, that a GGA repeat would support the formation of a G4 with only two G-tetrads. Until recently, the vast majority of research on G4 has focused on sequence patterns capable of forming structures with three or more G-tetrads and loop lengths of one to seven bases. When Huppert and Balusubramanian (2005) first made a genome-wide search for G4 using computational means, they restricted their search to this pattern as a necessary constraint on a complex search task [34] . This was based on laboratory research indicating that this sequence pattern would produce structures of greater stability, but it was acknowledged that G4 could form from other sequence patterns. Nevertheless, over the years, research has largely focused on structures with three or more G-tetrads.",

Furthermore, GGA repeat sequences are known to form intramolecular parallel G4 in the laboratory [35] , and in a study of secondary structures formed from triplet repeat RNAs, AGG and UGG repeats also formed stable G4 [36] . In the human c-myb gene, a G4 formed from a GGA repeat sequence blocked transcription [37] , and may serve as a negative regulator of gene expression [38] . It is also the case that formation of these structures can have useful clinical applications as seen with two thrombin binding aptamers shown to form two G-tetrad structures.

Although this might be expected given the greater likelihood of shorter G-tracts occurring at random [41], their examination of several sequence patterns indicates that secondary structures do form with two G-tetrads. Structural conformation and thermal stability is dependent on loop length and composition as is seen with three G-tetrad structures. G4 with two G-tetrads, as well as other types of non-canonical structures, have also been identified using new high throughput sequencing methods, G4-seq and rG4-seq, which are the first genome-and transcriptome-wide methods for detecting formed, rather than predicted, secondary structures [42, 43] In this paper, we identify sequences with the potential to form G4 on both DNA strands in each coding and non-coding region on all three manatee PV genomes. We find that the majority of sequences identified were capable of forming G4 structures with two rather than three G-tetrads, and we confirm the formation of G4 secondary structures from three of these sequences. We find several G4 in similar locations on all three PVs as well as several G4 in similar locations unique to the two PVs forming genital lesions. G4 were also located near putative E2 binding sites in non-coding regions on all PVs indicating a possible role in replication. Although G4 were found in all coding and non-coding regions, G4 were significantly enriched in the E2, E4, and L2 regions on all three genomes, suggesting that G4 are evolutionarily preserved in this region.",

Multiple well-established methods were used as criteria for G4 formation, using accepted standards in the field. These methods include analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC), circular dichroism (CD), thermal denaturation, and thioflavin T (ThT) binding. AUC is a venerable biophysical method that measures the absolute molecular weight (MW) and hydrodynamic shape (f/f 0 ) of biomolecules. The frictional ratio f/f 0 is the dimensionless ratio of the observed translational frictional coefficient to that of an equivalent spherical molecule of the same MW and density. It provides a measure of the asymmetry of the structure and shows definitively if a singlestranded oligonucleotide folds into a compact structure. The shape and amplitude of CD spectra provide characteristic signatures for the formation of G4 structures and for the number of G-tetrad stacks within a given structure. Thermal denaturation studies evaluate the stability of folded structures, and observed changes in CD spectra upon denaturation provide characteristic signatures for the transition from a folded G4 to an unstructured single strand. Finally, thioflavin T is a \"light up\" fluorescent probe for G4 formation. In the presence of known G4-forming sequences, a large increase in ThT fluorescence emission is observed, whereas in the presence of control duplexes and single strands, much lower emission intensity is seen. In addition to these accepted experimental criteria for G4 formation, molecular dynamics simulations were used to show that a plausible, stable, stereochemically feasible G4 can be constructed from the longest sequence studied, a structure that features two-tetrad G4 stacks. Fig 4A-4C and Table 2 show the results of AUC experiments. Fig 4A-4C shows that each of the three oligonucleotides sequences displayed in Fig 4D folds into a single predominant species (indicated by asterisks) with a compact shape. TmPV4-1 ( Fig 4A) shows a major peak at 2.15S, a frictional ratio of 1.36 and a measured MW of 12.1 kDA, a mass that is consistent with folding of the sequence into a unimolecular structure. TmPV4-1 shows slight (< 9%) heterogeneity with some faster sedimenting material. TmPV4-2 ( Fig 4B) shows a major peak at 2.94S (MW = 22.5 kDa), again consistent with a unimolecular folded structure. TmPV4-2 is more heterogeneous with both faster and slower sedimenting species, most likely arising from the formation of small amounts of aggregated and partially unfolded structures, respectively. The fastest sedimenting peak in Fig 4B near 3.8S has a molecular weight of 42.7 kDa, indicating the formation of a minor amount of a bimolecular structure. TmPV4-3 ( Fig 4C) shows a homogeneous peak at 1.78S (MW = 7.18 kDa). The measured mass is twice the MW of the 11 nt oligonucleotide showing unambiguously that a bimolecular structure has formed.",

Clearly, TmPV4-1 and TmPV4-2 are more complicated structures. Each forms a predominant monomeric structure as judged by their molecular weights (Table 2) , and their CD signatures are consistent with the formation of a parallel G4 structure ( Fig 4E) . However, the CD spectra also indicate a greater number of G-tetrads than would be found in a single two G-tetrad structure. While it is possible to fold the TmPV4-1 and TmPV4-2 strands into a variety of G4 conformations, we believe the simplest and most probable structures are ones that feature stacked G4 units, in which each unit is folded in a parallel conformation with two G-tetrads, as shown in Fig 5. The observed frictional ratios of 1.36 for TmPV4-1 and 1.58 for TmPV4-2 (Table 2) indicate nonspherical, slightly elongated, hydrodynamic structures, consistent with the shapes of these multiquadruplex structural models. The stacking interactions between G4 units in the proposed models yield contiguous G-tetrad stacks that are consistent with the amplitudes of the CD spectra in Fig 4E. Definitive proof of our proposed models requires independent verification by high-resolution structural methods, but these models are consistent with the available biophysical evidence.",

Sequences capable of forming two G-tetrad structures are found throughout the human genome [41] and are known to form secondary structures [42, 43] . In at least one case, two-Gtetrad structures have been found to be more stable than three G-tetrad structures [58] . G4 with two G-tetrads are also known to form structures with different loop interactions and capping structures [59], supporting the notion that sequences capable of forming G4 are more variable than once thought.

In Neisseria gonorrhoeae, a G4 structure is essential to variation in the surface protein pilin, allowing the bacteria to evade detection by the host immune system [14] . The proposed mechanism involves transcription of an sRNA from the G4 site that base-pairs with the complementary location on the opposite DNA strand, separating the two strands and allowing the formation of the G4.

However, the formation of G4 on the template DNA strand would appear to serve simply as a block to the polymerase, inhibiting expression of the early genes, and it is not clear how this would provide an evolutionary advantage to the virus.

G4 sequences located on the forward DNA strand that are transcribed to mRNA could regulate splicing and translation of early and late genes by binding splicing factors or other related proteins or by serving to block the machinery necessary for each of these processes. In one other virus, Epstein-Barr virus, G4 have been found to inhibit translation of mRNA [22] making this an important avenue to explore in future studies. Similarly, on the reverse DNA strand, the formation of G4 could serve to inhibit transcription through blocking polymerase or binding proteins that enhance or inhibit transcription.",

In areas such as cancer research, much effort has been devoted to exerting regulatory control by identifying natural ligands [11, 69] and developing artificial ligands [70, 71] to promote G4 stabilization. Conversely, G4 destabilization can be achieved in the presence of a variety of helicases [72] . In terms of viral control, the focus has been on the therapeutic potential of G4-forming oligonucleotides, aptamers, and some success has been found in HIV [73] , Hepatitis A [74] , influenza virus [75] , and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [76] . More recently, viral control has been achieved by identifying ligands for regulating naturally occurring G4 in HIV-1 [15, [17] [18] [19] 21] , EBV [22, 77] , and HSV-1 [23] . Given the greater likelihood of sequences representing two G-tetrad structures, even if structures do not naturally form in vivo from these sequences, the potential for control through ligand stabilization exists. Indeed, in high-throughput sequencing identification of G4 secondary structures, the number of two G-tetrad structures increases relative to the number produced with a potassium environment when adding the G4 stabilizing ligand pyridostatin [42, 43] .",

In longer sequences, these non-canonical, two G-tetrad structures appear capable of stacking as multiple G4 units. Distribution patterns that are indicative of G4 sequence conservation in specific coding regions support the notion that these structures regulate activities similar to those of G4 in other species. As regulatory structures, G4 offer potential drug targets for researchers interested in controlling disease processes. From an ecological perspective, given the threatened status of the Florida manatee and the concerns of scientists working to protect the health of this species, this research also provides an important first step in exploring the biological significance of these structures in this gentle aquatic mammal.",

The four quadruplex sequences were defined as GGAGCAGGAGAAGGAGG, GGAGGAGGAC GAGG, GGACGAGGAGGAGG, and GGAGGACGAGGAGG with potassium ions placed centrally between tetrads and stacks. Loop regions were added manually in a parallel (double chain reversal) orientation. Molecular dynamics was performed using the AMBER suite of software [86] . The ff14SB force field was used and the system was solvated in a rectilinear box of TIP3P water molecules with 15 \u00c5 buffers and neutralizing K + ions were added to the system using standard Leap rules. The system was heated and equilibrated using the following protocol: (i) minimize water and ions holding the DNA and tetrad coordinated potassium ions restrained (10 kcal/mol/\u00c5), (ii) 25 ps MD (heating to 100 K) holding the DNA and tetrad coordinated potassium ions restrained (10 kcal/mol/\u00c5), (iii) repeat step (i), (iv) minimize all atoms, (v) 25 ps MD (heating to 300 K) holding the DNA and tetrad coordinated potassium ions restrained (10 kcal/mol/\u00c5), (vi) 5 ns MD (T = 300 K) equilibration holding the DNA and tetrad coordinated potassium ions restrained (10 kcal/mol/\u00c5) to finish the equilibrium. A production run of 100 ns after the final equilibration step was carried out. Simulations were performed in the isothermal isobaric ensemble (P = 1 atm, T = 300 K) using sander and the GPU version of pmemd. Periodic boundary conditions and Particle-Mesh-Ewald algorithms were used. A 2.0 fs time step was used with bonds involving hydrogen atoms frozen using SHAKE.",

E2 binding sites were identified using the consensus sequence ACCgNNNNcGGT, allowing some variation in the fourth and ninth nucleotide positions (lowercase g and c) with most variation occurring from nucleotide positions 5 through 8 [46]. S5 through S7 Tables list all sequences identified with the pattern ACCNNNNNNGGT. Nine of the 21 sequences identified have the more conservative consensus sequence of ACCGNNNNCGGT. The locations of consensus sequences identified in the NCR are displayed in Fig 3 along with the location of G4 in that region.

Such a spectral signature is accepted as characteristic of a parallel G4 topology [48, 49]. The amplitudes of the CD spectra in Fig 4E are proportional to the number of G-tetrads in each structure (R. D. Gray & J. B. Chaires, unpublished data) [50-53]. Oligonucleotides TmPV4-1 and TmPV4-2 have large amplitudes consistent with the formation of 4-5 and 7-8 G-tetrads, respectively. TmPV4-3 shows the lowest CD amplitude, consistent with the presence of 3-4 G-tetrads. The results of thermal denaturation studies are shown in S1 Fig in the supplement. These results show that upon heating, the CD spectra of all three of the TmPV sequences studied is disrupted and changes from spectra characteristic of parallel G4 structures to spectra characteristic of unstructured single-strand oligonucleotides. The temperatures at the transition midpoint (T m ) for TmPV4-1 and TmPV4-2 are 49.8 \u00b1 0.2 and 52.1 \u00b1 0.2 o C, respectively. These T m values demonstrate that stable unimolecular structures are formed by the oligonucleotides. The bimolecular TMPV4-3 has a T m value of 82.7 \u00b1 0.4 o C, indicative of a very stable structure. The measured T m values are well within the range of reported values for a wide variety of G4 structures determined under similar solution conditions [54]. Thioflavin T fluorescence was used to develop a \"first-in-line assay to identify G4 formation\" [55]. In the supplement, S2 Fig shows that ThT fluorescence is greatly enhanced in the presence of TmPV4-1 and TmPV4-2, indicating that they both fold into G4 structures. Enhancement of ThT fluorescence is less for TmPV4-3 (S2 Fig), but it has been noted that there are some outliers in the ThT assay. In particular, some G4 structures involving only two tetrads lead to a lower increase in ThT fluorescence.",

Again, NMR and x-ray crystallography studies will be necessary to determine the definitive G4 structure, but this model is fully consistent with the circular dichroism data. It is interesting to note a consequence of the models shown in Fig 5. While an individual two G-tetrad structure might be only weakly stable, its stability could perhaps be enhanced by stacking interactions contributed by an adjacent G4 unit. Such a thermodynamic strategy might explain the proposed structures. With the short sequence in TmPV4-3, only a single two G-tetrad unit can form, which might then be stabilized by dimerization since no adjacent G4 unit, like those seen in TmPV4-1 and TmPV4-2, would be available for stacking. Together, our computational and biophysical analyses suggest that the search for G4 in PVs, and perhaps all viruses, should be extended to include two G-tetrad structures. Our biophysical analysis indicates that this should include longer sequences capable of producing multiple stacked G4 units. In TmPVs these longer sequences are consistently found in the E2/E4 region on the reverse DNA strand, although they can be found elsewhere as well (See S8 Table).",
