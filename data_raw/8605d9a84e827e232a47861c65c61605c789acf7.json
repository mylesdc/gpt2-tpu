We describe the epidemiology and public health response to the first known outbreak of 2009 H1N1 in a train, which occurred in June 2009 in China. Methods: After 2 provinces provided initial reports of 2009 H1N1 infection in 2 persons who had travelled on the same train, we conducted a retrospective epidemiologic investigation to collect information from the passengers, crew members, contacts, and health care providers. We explored the source of infection and possible routes of transmission in the train. All cases were confirmed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing. Results: Train #1223 traveled 40 hours, made 28 stops in 4 Chinese provinces, and boarded 2555 passengers, who logged a total of 59 144 person-hours of travel time. Nineteen confirmed 2009 H1N1 cases were identified. Of these, 13 were infected and developed symptoms on the train and 6 occurred among contacts who developed illness during medical monitoring. In addition, 3 asymptomatic cases were identified based on RT-PCR testing of respiratory swabs from contacts. The attack rate among contacts of confirmed cases in the same car was higher than that among contacts in other cars (3.15% vs. 0%, P < 0.001). Attack rates increased with exposure time. Conclusions: Close contact and long exposure may have contributed to the transmission of 2009 H1N1 virus in the train. Trains may have played an important role in the 2009 influenza pandemic.",

            "text": "Every year, people take more than 2.3 billion train trips in China, creating a temporary community and the opportunity for the spread of communicable diseases in trains. The large temporary community created during the annual Hajj, when millions of Muslim pilgrims from all over the world travel by airplane, ship, train, bus, and cars to Mecca has also experienced outbreaks, 1 including cholera, plague, smallpox, meningococcal meningitis, and infectious diarrheas. 2, 3 Transmission of respiratory infectious diseases on airplanes and ships has been reported 4, 5 ; however, reports of such transmission on trains are less common. 6 Pandemic 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus (hereafter referred to as 2009 H1N1 virus) spread rapidly and resulted in millions of laboratory-confirmed cases. More than 18 000 deaths were reported from more than 200 countries. The global distribution of the pandemic prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare the first influenza pandemic of the 21st century in June 2009. Influenza transmission is thought to occur primarily via droplet spread and contact transmission, although droplet nuclei transmission is also likely. [7] [8] [9] Transmission of 2009 H1N1 and other respiratory viruses is facilitated by crowded and confined environments. [10] [11] [12] The first confirmed case of 2009 H1N1 infection was identified on 11 May 2009 in mainland China. 13, 14 Since then, transmission patterns evolved rapidly from a few imported cases to sustained community level transmission and outbreaks. 15 Through 21 July 2009, a total of 1762 confirmed 2009 H1N1 cases were reported in the country, 75% of which were imported cases.",

A suspected case of 2009 H1N1 was defined as a person with ARI and 1 of the following: illness onset within 7 days of travel to an area with confirmed cases or within 7 days of close contact with a confirmed case. A confirmed case was defined as a patient with ARI and laboratory evidence of 2009 H1N1 infection diagnosed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) testing of respiratory specimens. 15 Routine surveillance and reporting of suspected cases are done through the National Notifiable Disease Reporting System, as stipulated by law, beginning on 30 April 2009. 14 In addition, to increase case finding related to the train outbreak, we delivered public announcements in the 4 provinces that were on the route of the train. The announcements requested passengers and staff to present themselves to local public health authorities for evaluation. Professional staff at local CDCs administered a screening questionnaire to respondents. Respondents who had a history of ARI or who had been in the train car with a confirmed case-patient were investigated. Trained interviewers collected information from passengers, crew, and health care workers by using a structured questionnaire that included items on demographic characteristics, symptoms, date of illness onset, and travel history. Quarantine either at designated hospitals or at home was imposed when professionals confirmed the presence of symptoms. We also collected information from the Chinese Ministry of Railways to investigate the internal environment of the train, including air conditioning, the cafeteria, seating locations, capacity, timetable, crew, passengers, and structure.",

Other explanations cannot be ruled out. Indeed, other passengers or crew might have acquired infection before boarding the train and experienced longer incubation periods. All case-patients who were suspected of acquiring infection while on board shared a car. The long distance and duration of the trip (41 hours) as well as close contact in the train may have increased the probability of communicable disease transmission. 18 We do not know when the index case-patient was infected, but we inferred that she acquired infection before boarding the train, after which she spread it to other passengers and crew.",

Those who shared a car with a case-patient and those who spent more time on the train had higher risks of disease, especially those who sat close to another case-patient. Transmission among passengers was more likely to have occurred among close contacts, such as those who stayed together in the same car. Likewise, long exposure increased the probability of infection. 19 Passengers who shared a room were in a higher-risk environment for infection. 20 Crew members, who served many passengers in the train, were at higher risk of infection and, once infected, may have been more effective sources for spreading illness to other crew and passengers in other cars. In our investigation, the longer the time spent on the train, the higher the risk of infection. We attempted to interview all contacts with possible exposure to the confirmed cases, and those contacts were quarantined. In addition to the 13 case-patients who were on the train, the 3 third-generation cases had clear close contact with confirmed second-generation cases, including sharing the same room, providing care for a patient as a nurse, or being a duty waitress in the quarantine hotel. Likewise, 3 fourth-generation casepatients all reported exposures to third-generation casepatients. The attack rate among passengers in our study was similar to that reported for other vehicles. 21 Among 343 contacts who had been quarantined for 7 days, 3 (0.87%) developed 2009 H1N1, suggesting that management is less effective for diseases with vigorous infection capability and that strict quarantine is necessary, 22 as was the case for control of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003. 23 Although active surveillance in health care facilities played an important role in identifying patients with ARI, the media also assisted in providing important information to the public. 24 During our investigation, 3 patients contacted the local CDC after developing symptoms. For urgent public health action, use of press releases can educate people, raise awareness, promote health assessment, and accelerate infection containment. 25 Passengers who travel by air provide detailed contact information. Hence, they can be reached after arrival. In contrast, train passengers could not be reached because tickets are often sold without any identifying information. This could be an issue in cases of serious disease. Potential spread though trains is more difficult to control, as passengers are lost to follow up. This highlights the need to be prepared to respond to any new emerging disease threats.",

This might constitute overreaction to the event in relatively mild pandemics. However, establishing and maintaining a surveillance system for ARI among train passengers, with the goal of systematic data collection, might help in determining baseline levels of illness. This would enable early identification of outbreaks and timely implementation of control measures, which might prove critical with a disease that has higher illness rates and a greater risk of severe illness. 26, 27 Based on our observations, the incubation period was 0 to 3 days for influenza A/H1N1. Therefore, we suggest that the appropriate duration of quarantine is 4 days. Longer quarantine would burden the health system and would not be cost-effective. Transportation by train is common in China and other nations. Frequent transport alters the model of disease transmission for new and re-emerging diseases, including 2009 H1N1 and tuberculosis, which can both spread in trains. Because it is more difficult to identify sources of infection, control of communicable diseases may be more challenging in this setting. In our investigation, among 685 persons examined, only 13 cases were confirmed. This low attack rate suggests that active surveillance and management was not a highly effective strategy.",
