GmPHD5 interacts with other DNA binding proteins, including GmGNAT1 (an acetyl transferase), GmElongin A (a transcription elongation factor) and GmISWI (a chromatin remodeling protein). Our results suggest that GmPHD5 can recognize specific histone methylated H3K4, with preference to di-methylated H3K4. Here, we illustrate that the interaction between GmPHD5 and GmGNAT1 is regulated by the self-acetylation of GmGNAT1, which can also acetylate histone H3. GmGNAT1 exhibits a preference toward acetylated histone H3K14. These results suggest a histone crosstalk between methylated H3K4 and acetylated H3K14. Consistent to its putative roles in gene regulation under salinity stress, we showed that GmPHD5 can bind to the promoters of some confirmed salinity inducible genes in soybean.",

It contains the conserved aromatic amino acids that are important for the PHD finger domain to recognize the histone methylated H3K4 by forming a groove [14] and the negatively charged amino acids that are important to hold the H3R2 methylation in another groove.

Our results showed that acetylation in the extracted soybean histone H3 increased when treated with GmGNAT1 in vitro ( Figure 5A ). Since there are several adjacent lysine sites (for example, H3K9, H3K14, H3K18) in the histone H3 that are subjected to acetylation, we employed antibodies that can distinguish each site. While the extent of acetylation at histone H3 lysine 9 and lysine 18 did not change much (data not shown), the acetylated H3K14 increased significantly after treatment with GmGNAT1 ( Figure 5B ). However, no obvious acetylation signals were observed for GmPHD5 in a similar assay ( Figure 5C ), suggesting that GmPHD5 might not be the substrate of GmGNAT1 although they could interact with each other directly. More interestingly, we found that GmGNAT1 can be self-acetylated, since the acetylation signal could be detected only when the GmGNAT1 was present ( Figure  5D ). Although the exact site of acetylation on GmGNAT1 is not yet known, we showed that acetylation of GmGNAT1 would impair its interaction with GmPHD5 ( Figure 5E ).",

Incidentally, there are six homologues of PHD5 in soybean and their responses to abiotic stresses, such as salinity, cold and drought stress, are different, suggesting that although these six GmPHDs are highly conserved, their functions might be different [13] .

For instance, the yeast GNAT selectively transfers an acetyl group to K14 of histone H3 and to K8 and K16 of histone H4 [20] . Our findings revealed that GmGNAT1 has the ability to acetylate H3K14 and possibly itself.

In Figure 8 , we propose a model depicting the epigenetic effects (methylated histone H3K4) on the response of soybean towards salinity stress. It seems that the histone di-methylated H3K4 of the soybean plant could be significantly increased under high salinity conditions. Subsequently, the 'histone code' H3K4me2 is recognized by GmPHD5, which is found on both the promoter and coding regions of salinity inducible genes (e.g. GmRD22 and GmGST, see Additional File 6 and 7, Figure S5 and S6) and may act as a regulator during activation of these genes. This regulatory complex could recruit gene expression cofactors, including the chromatin remodeling factor GmISWI, and gene transcriptional elongation factor GmElongin A.

Bands of these two proteins were manually excised out from the SDS-PAGE gel, followed by destaining and digestion procedures and then identified by MALDI-TOF/TOF. A: The mass spectrum of protein 1. B: The mass spectrum of protein 2.Additional file 4: Table S1 -Mass spectrometry of GNAT and Elongin A (Identified by MALDI-TOF/TOF).Additional file 5: Figure S4 -Alignment of the two GmGNATs of soybean. These two isoforms of GmGNAT displayed 89% identities in their nucleotide sequences and 87% identities in their amino acid sequences. The GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase domain (GNAT superfamily) was indicated in this figure.Additional file 6: Figure S5 -Northern blot analysis GmRD22. Soybean seeds were germinated in sand irrigated with tap water. They were then irrigated with Hoagland's solution when the first true leaves were opened. When the second trifoliates were opened, they were irrigated with Hoagland's solution supplemented with NaCl gradually increased from 0.3% to 0.6%, and finally 0.9% NaCl in 1 week interval. Control seedlings were irrigated with Hoagland's solution only. The trifoliates of each plant were collected for extraction of total RNA. Ten micrograms of total RNA was loaded onto each lane. Upper panel: Northern blot signals. Lower panel: Ethidium bromide staining of rRNA. Additional file 7: Figure S6 -Comparative proteomics studies demonstrating enzymes changes upon salinity stress. The total protein of soybean whole plant were extracted by TCA/Acetone methods followed by separation using 2-DE gels procedures (A). Three proteins (glutathione S-transferase, ascorbate peroxidase and dehydroascorbate reductase), which have a well documented involvement in the glutathione-ascorbate cycle and are closely associated with ROS elimination were chosen for further validation by image analysis (B). Besides, the GmGST was also verified by Western blot analysis (C). Consistent with the observations from 2-DE analysis, expression of GmGST, MDAR and APX were up-regulated in soybean plants.Additional file 8: Table S2 .1-List of primers for amplifying genes GmRD22 and GmGST in Chromatin immuno-precipitation (ChIP) assays.
