However, the amount and complexity of data that even a single experiment can produce seriously challenges researchers with limited bioinformatics expertise, who need to handle, analyze and interpret the data before it can be understood in a biological context. Thus, there is an unmet need for tools allowing non-bioinformatics users to interpret large data sets. We have recently developed a method, NNAlign, which is generally applicable to any biological problem where quantitative peptide data is available. This method efficiently identifies underlying sequence patterns by simultaneously aligning peptide sequences and identifying motifs associated with quantitative readouts. Here, we provide a web-based implementation of NNAlign allowing non-expert end-users to submit their data (optionally adjusting method parameters), and in return receive a trained method (including a visual representation of the identified motif) that subsequently can be used as prediction method and applied to unknown proteins/peptides. We have successfully applied this method to several different data sets including peptide microarray-derived sets containing more than 100,000 data points. NNAlign is available online at http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NNAlign.",

Many diseases are caused by protein aberrations, and proteins are frequent targets of intervention. A plethora of highthroughput methods are currently being used to study genetic associations and protein interactions, and intense on-going international efforts aim at understanding the structures, functions and molecular interactions of all proteins of organisms of interest (e.g. the Human Proteome Project, HPP). In some cases, linear peptides can emulate functional and/or structural aspects of a target structure. Such peptides are currently identified using simple peptide libraries of a few hundreds to thousands peptides whose sequences have been systematically derived from the target structure at hand -that is, if this is known. Even when the native target structure is unknown, or too complex (e.g. discontinuous) to be represented by homologous peptides, the enormous diversity and plasticity of peptides may allow one or more peptides to mimic relevant aspects of a given target structure [1, 2] .",

            "text": "A wealth of methods has been developed to interpret quantitative peptide sequence data representing specific biological problems. By way of examples, SignalP, which identifies the presence of signal peptidase I cleavage sites, is a popular method for the prediction of signal peptides [10] ; LipoP, which identifies peptidase II cleavage sites, predicts lipoprotein signal peptides in Gram-negative bacteria [11] ; various prediction methods predict phosphorylation sites by identifying short amino acid sequence motifs surrounding a suitable acceptor residue [12, 13, 14, 15] etc. In general terms, these methods can be divided in two major groups depending on the structural properties of the biological receptor investigated, and of the nature of the peptides recognized. The simplest situation deals with interactions where a receptor binds peptides that are in register and of a known length. In this case, the peptide data is pre-aligned, and conventional fixed length, alignment-free pattern recognition methods like position specific weight matrices (PSSM), artificial neural networks (ANN), and support vector machines (SVM) can be used. Peptide-MHC class I binding is a prominent example of the successful use of such methods to characterize receptor-ligand interaction represented by pre-aligned data (reviewed in [16] ). Another more complex type of problems deals with interactions where either the motif lengths, and/or the binding registers, are unknown. In these cases, the peptide data must a priori be assumed to be unaligned and any bioinformatics method dealing with such data is faced with the challenge of simultaneously recognizing the binding register (i.e. performing an alignment) and identifying the binding motif (i.e. performing a specificity analysis). Peptide-MHC class II binding is a preeminent example of a receptor-ligand interaction represented by unaligned data. Several bioinformatics methods have been developed to identify binding motifs in such peptide data including Gibbs sampling [17] , hidden Markov models (HMM) [18] , stabilization matrix method (SMM) alignment [19] , and alignment using artificial neural networks [20] (for more references see [21] ). Another example of unaligned peptide data is that of antibodies interacting with linear peptide epitopes. Although B-cell epitopes frequently are conformational and three-dimensional in structure, some do contain linear components that can be represented by peptide interaction with the corresponding antibodies [22, 23, 24] .",

We have recently described a neural network-based data driven method, NN-align, which has been specifically designed to automatically capture motifs hidden in unaligned peptide data [20] . NN-align is implemented as a conventional feed-forward neural network and consists of a two-step procedure that simultaneously identifies the optimal peptide-binding core, and the optimal configuration of the network weights (i.e. the motif). This method is therefore inherently designed to deal with unaligned peptide data, and it identifies a core of consecutive amino acids within the peptide sequences that constitute an informative motif. Note that the method does not allow for gaps in the alignment. Although NNalign was originally developed with the unaligned nature of peptide-MHC class II interaction in mind -and independent validations have shown that NN-align indeed performs significantly better than any previously published methods for MHC class II motif recognition [25] -the unique ability of this method to capture subtle linear sequence motifs in quantitative peptide-based data and its adaptability makes it extremely attractive for other applications as well. Here, we have adapted and extended the NNalign method so that it can handle quantitative peptide-based data in general. Making this method generally available for the scientific community, we have embedded it into a public online web-interface that facilitates both handling of input data, optimization of essential training parameters, visual interpretation of the results, and the option of using the resulting method to predict on user-specified proteins/peptides. Through the server the user can easily set up a cross-validation experiment to estimate the predictive performance of the trained method, and automatically reduce redundancy in the data. The logo visualization is also improved with an algorithm that aligns individual neural networks to maximize the information content of the combined alignment. This web-based extension of the NN-align method empowers experimentalists of limited bioinformatics background with the ability to perform advanced bioinformatics-driven analysis of his/ her own sets of large-scale data.",

First, the method is applied to examples of pre-aligned peptide data using examples of MHC class I binding. Next, the alignment problem is included using MHC class II binding data, showing the ability of the method to identify at the same time the correct length of the motif, the binding register, and the sequence motif itself. An important output from the NNAlign method is a sequence logo representing the identified binding motif. Such sequence logos provide a highly intuitive representation of single-receptor specificities (as is the case Figure 1 . Example of output from the NNAlign server trained on MHC class II binding data for allele HLA-DRB1*0101. Links on the results page (in pink) redirect to additional files and figures relevant for the analysis. Run ID is a sequential identifier for the current job, and Run Name a user-defined prefix that is added to all files of the run. The ''view data distribution'' link shows the transformation applied to the data in preprocessing, which can be either a linear or logarithmic transformation. In this case the method was trained with a motif length of 9, including a PFR of size 3 to both ends of the peptide, and encoding in the network input layer peptide length and PFR length. The hidden layer was made of a fixed number of 20 neurons. Peptides were presented to the networks using a Blosum encoding to account for amino acid similarity, for 500 hundred iterations per peptide without stopping on the best test set performance. At each cross-validation step, 10 networks were trained starting from 10 different initial configurations. The subsets for cross-validation were constructed using a Hobohm1 method that groups in the same subset sequences that align with more than 80% identity (thr = 0.8). The model can be downloaded to disk using the dedicated link, and can be resubmitted to NNAlign to find occurrences of the learned pattern in new data. The estimated performance of the trained method is expressed in terms of Root Mean Square Error, Pearson and Spearman correlation. A visual representation of the correlation can be obtained from the scatterplot of predicted versus observed values. The ''complete alignment core'' link allows downloading the prediction values in cross-validation for each peptide, and where the core was placed within the peptides. Next follows a section on the sequence logo, showing a logo representation of the binding motif learned by the network ensemble. If the relative option is selected, links to logos for the individual networks in the final ensemble are also listed here. Finally, if an evaluation set is uploaded, an additional section shows performance measures and core alignment for these data. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0026781.g001",

            "text": "As opposed to MHC class I binding, which is mostly limited to peptides of similar length, the MHC class II molecule interacts with peptides of a wide length distribution and high compositional diversity [28] . Binding of a peptide to an MHC class II molecule is primarily determined by a core of normally 9 amino acids, but the composition of the regions flanking the binding core (peptide flanking region, PFR) has been shown to also affect the binding strength of a peptide [29, 30] . Identifying the binding motif and binding register for MHC class II binding peptides is thus a problem that inherently requires simultaneous alignment and binding affinity identification. Here, an MHC class II benchmarking was obtained from the recent publication by Wang et al. [25] . The performance was estimated for each allele using a 5 fold cross validation, where at each step 4/5 of the data were used to train the neural networks, and 1/5 were left out for evaluation. For cross-validation, we preserved the same data partitioning as used in the original publication. In Table 1 , the performance of NNAlign on the Wang set is compared to other publicly available methods for MHC class II prediction. These include SMM-align [19] , ProPred/Tepitope [31, 32] , as well as the original version of the NN-align algorithm [20] . The NN-align-based methods outperform their competitors on all alleles, confirming the ability of the neural networks in dealing with alignment problems. The difference with the original NN-align method, which is due to differences in network architecture, is small and not significant (p.0.2, binomial test). For this example involving unaligned data, the NNAlign server competes with comparable state-of-the-art methods.",

By this token, a terminal position is included in the motif if it contributes with information at a level above what could be considered to be noise. In contrast, if the inclusion of a putative terminal position does not lead to a reduction in the RSME then it can be concluded that it does not add useful parameters to the model; rather, it lowers the predictive performance and should be omitted. This approach was used to suggest the motif length of the 14 MHC class II HLA-DR alleles, which were searched for optimal predictive performance by scanning through possible lengths from 6 to 11 amino acids. NNalign will report the length associated with the lowest RMSE value as the optimal motif length (see Figure 2 , left hand panel). Nonetheless, the user is advised to inspect the sequence logo as well as the performance plot of the RMSE as a function of the motif length to evaluate whether the dependence upon length appears significant. As defined here and illustrated in Figure 2 right panel, the 9-mer preference of HLA-DRB1*01:01 is significant, whereas the apparent 8-mer preference of HLA-DRB1*15:01 is not significant. In fact, for the 14 HLA-DR molecules included in the benchmark, only one was found to have a single consistent optimal motif length (DRB1*0101 with a motif length of 9 amino acids). For all other molecules the method did identify more than one possible optimal motif length. However, all motif lengths fell in the range of 7 to 10 amino acids, and in all cases a 9-mer motif was compatible with being the optimal motif length.",

As a consequence of different architectures and starting conditions, individual networks might disagree on the exact boundaries of the motif. This disagreement would complicate the visualization of the motif if this was represented as a simple overlay of the individual motifs as exemplified in Figure 3 , where sequence logos for four different networks from the ensemble trained on HLA*DRB1-04:01 binding data are shown in panels A through D. The individual networks agree on identifying the same strong primary anchor residues and positions, however, each single network identifies different ends (i.e. suggests different registers of the same motif; in casu starting at positions 1, 2, 2 and 3 of the predicted nonamer peptide). The weak C-terminal primary anchor residue of HLA*DRB1-04:01 probably explains why the boundaries are difficult to determine. A simple overlay of the predictions from individual networks would result in a muddled motif as depicted in Figure 3 , panel E. Implementing a Gibbs sampler approach, where matrix representations of the core motifs of different networks are aligned, we introduced an off-set correction for each network aiming at maximizing the information content of a combined logo representation of the motif. This approach led to a considerable improvement in the visual logo representation of the binding motif (Figure 3, panel F) .

Even though most of these motifs exhibit a strong preference for hydrophobic and neutral amino acids at most anchor positions, some dramatic deviations from this general pattern exist.

            "text": "Handling large data sets exemplified by protease recognition of high-density peptide microarrays A peptide microarray containing a total of .100,000 peptides (49,838 of which were unique) was digested with the protease trypsin. The peptide sequences had been synthesized using the theme Ac-GAGAXXXXXGAGA, where Ac-is acetyl blocking the peptide alpha-amino group prior to digestion, and X represents amino acids chosen randomly from the 20 natural amino acids (except lysine, as this residue contains an epsilon-amino group, which even without digestion would be detectable (see Materials and Methods for details)). As a result, free amino groups can only be expressed by trypsin cleaved peptides, which then can then be labeled with Dylight549 and quantitated by fluorescence microscopy. A fluorescence microscopy picture of such a digested and stained peptide microarray (Figure 5a ) demonstrates both the resolution of the photolithographic peptide synthesis strategy and the dynamic range of the free amino group detection strategy. The resulting data was log-transformed and rescaled to obtain a data distribution covering the spectrum between 0 and 1, which -along with the corresponding peptide sequences encoded as Blosum scores without flanking regionswere used to train an NNAlign method. Training was done with a motif length of 5, a fixed number of 3 hidden neurons, 5-fold exhaustive validation, and stopping at the best test set performance. The prediction method yielded a Pearson correlation between measured values and predictions of r = 0.971, a Spearman correlation of r = 0.910, and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) of 0.997 (using The fundamental pattern appears in all these networks, but they place the anchors at different position of the core. e) shows the core of the 20 networks ensemble without offset correction; in f) offset correction was used to realign the logos to a common register. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0026781.g003 a target threshold of t = 0.5). The very high performance measures of the resulting NNAlign method demonstrate both that the recorded peptide digestion data contains a consistent and intelligible signal, and that the NNAlign method is capable of deciphering and predicting this extraordinary large number of sequence-dependent peptide signals. The correlation scatterplot feature of the NNAlign web-server output, which compares predicted vs. observed values, further supports the validity of both the peptide microarray and of the NNAlign method. The correlation scatterplot for the trypsin digestion data reveals two major populations of peptides, one composed of non-degradable, non-predicted peptides and one containing weakly to strongly degradable, predicted peptides ( Figure 5b) . Few (0.7%) of the former peptides contained Arginine, whereas most (97.1%) of latter peptides contained Arginine. This is exactly what one would have expected from a peptide digestion with trypsin, which is known to cleave at the C-terminal side of amino acids Arginine (and Lysine, which has been excluded here, see above) [34] . For illustration purposes, Figure 5b includes a color-enhanced visualization of certain dipeptide sequences (note, this is not a standard feature of the NNAlign server) showing that RP sequences are resistant, RA sequences are quite susceptible, and RR sequences appear extremely susceptible to trypsin digestion. Thus, the known trypsin resistance of RP sequences is both demonstrated by the peptide microarray and subsequently captured by the NNAlign method. Note, that both the peptide microarray and the NNAlign generate a continuous set of measurements and predictions showing that trypsin cleavage involves a more complex interaction than a simple recognition solely of an Arginine residue (and by inference a Lysine residue), which would have resulted in a cleaved/non-cleaved classification [35] . It is also important to note that the detection strategy employed here does not reveal where the protease cleavage has occurred, but merely that the protease has recognized the peptide as a substrate and cleaved it somewhere.",

Ideally, however, he or she should not only be armed with highthroughput data-generation technologies, but also with reasonably easy and robust bioinformatics methods allowing the experimentalist to analyze his or her own data. This would permit an immediate analysis of experimental results and assist in rational designs of next generation experiments aimed at extending the original analysis e.g. providing in silico tools for searches that potentially could encompass entire proteomes. Enabling the same person to do large-scale experiments and analysis should result in a better integration between design, experiment, and interpretation -and eventually support the development of new hypotheses. Unfortunately, suitable bioinformatics resources aimed at the nonexpert user are currently scarce, and rarely web-based. In our experience, open source software packages such as Weka [38] are not capable of performing concurrent alignment and motif identification, and are not suited for treating large-scale data sets. A widely used method for motif discovery, MEME [39] , can perform searches for un-gapped sequence patterns in DNA or protein sequences, and offers a user-friendly online server to the untrained user.

As shown here, NNAlign easily competes with state-of-the-art methods for identifying peptidebinding motifs of aligned (exemplified by MHC class I) as well as unaligned (exemplified by MHC class II) quantitative peptide sequence data. Further, demonstrating the general utility of NNAlign, we have used it to characterize the cleavage specificities of proteases from high-throughput peptide array data. If a sufficient number of training examples can be generated, including negative instances, we could envision applying the method also on data generated by phage display peptide libraries. Other instances of recognition of short specific peptide motifs occurs frequently in biology where they are involved in molecular interaction, recognition, signaling, internalization, modification etc (e.g. phosphorylation, dephosphorylation, trafficking motifs, SH2 and SH3 domains, glycosylation, lipidation, etc. In contrast to domain recognition, short linear peptide sequences are thought to be particularly difficult to identify due to their unordered structure [40] . NNAlign appears to be ideally suited to identify such short linear peptide targets.

For both methods ii) and iii) similar sequences are grouped together in the same subset, but it is possible to choose to only include one representative for each group and disregard the other sequences from training. In this phase, if the input data contains repeated flanks (as might be the case in peptide array experiments, where linker sequences can be attached at the extremities of all peptides), these flanks are discarded, as they would affect the overlap estimation. If the user reckons that the repeated flanks might contain meaningful biological signal, an option allows retaining them in the training data. Note that in common motif clustering, the motif length is taken as the smallest in the interval of length given by the user. Thus, depending on the selected interval the subsets might be constructed in a different way and that could influence the cross-validated performance.",

The number of hidden neurons may be specified as a list of multiple values, so that an ensemble of networks is constructed with hidden layers of different sizes. Each architecture is trained multiple times, starting from different initial random configurations, to avoid as much as possible choosing suboptimal solutions producing local minima. Sequences can be presented to the network either with Sparse or Blosum encoding. In Sparse encoding, a vector of length N represents each amino acid, where all values are identical apart from the one representing the observed amino acid. Blosum encoding, on the other hand, takes into account amino acids similarity and partially allows substitutions of similar amino acids while penalizing very dissimilar ones [45] .",

In this CV training, the selected network configuration is the one that gives the minimum RMSE on the stopping set. Next the predictions for the evaluation data are estimated as a simple average of the prediction values for each network in the training ensemble. The exhaustive CV procedure adds one level to the cross-validation and increases greatly the running time.
