However, metabolic analysis in bio-samples needs tedious sample preparation, due to the sample complexity and low molecular abundance. A further challenge is to construct diagnostic tools. Herein, we developed a platform using silver nanoshells. We synthesized SiO 2 @Ag with tunable shell structures by multi-cycled silver mirror reactions. Optimized nanoshells achieved direct laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry in 0.5 \u03bcL of bio-fluids. We applied these nanoshells for disease diagnosis and therapeutic evaluation. We identified patients with postoperative brain infection through daily monitoring and glucose quantitation in cerebrospinal fluid. We measured drug distribution in blood and cerebrospinal fluid systems and validated the function of blood-brain/cerebrospinal fluid-barriers for pharmacokinetics. Our work sheds light on the design of materials for advanced metabolic analysis and precision diagnostics.",

Currently, both inorganic and organic materials have been used for metabolic analysis by selected spectroscopy methods, including nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, biochemical analyzers, and mass spectrometry (MS) et al. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . In contrast with other methods, MS enjoys unique advantages of high accuracy, sensitivity, resolution, and throughput. However, the efficacy of MS and other spectroscopy methods is determined by rigorous sample pretreatment procedures for enrichment or purification 2, 6-9 , due to the high sample complexity and low molecular abundance in biological samples. To date, MS-based analysis of metabolites in bio-fluids is still unsatisfactory in terms of selectivity, speed, costs, and reproducibility for clinical use. Therefore, to address the challenges in the sample pre-treatment, a designer material platform is in urgent demand for advanced in-vitro metabolic diagnosis.",

Inorganic particles (e.g., silicon 10, 11 , carbon 12, 13 , metal [14] [15] [16] , and metal oxide 17, 18 ) have been preferred matrices in LDI MS for small metabolites as reported by research groups globally including ours. These particles can control the analytical variations and background signals in the mass region below m/z of 500, achieving the qualitative analysis of small metabolites, such as carbohydrates and amino acids 6, 7, 19 . Further coupling LDI MS with isotopic quantification, designed particles enabled metabolic analysis of rare cells, e.g., circulating tumor cells 17 . Notably, the LDI performance of particles is far from ideal for selective detection of small metabolites, dealing with complex bio-fluids in real case. As a result, the application of particle-assisted LDI MS for clinical diagnostics is very challenging and needs rational design of materials for use.",

The optimized plasmonic silver nanoshells as new matrices allowed fast, multiplex, sensitive, and selective LDI MS detection of small metabolites in 0.5 \u03bcL of biofluids without enrichment or purification. Furthermore, coupling with isotopic quantification of selected metabolites, we demonstrated the use of these silver nanoshells for disease detection and therapeutic evaluation in clinics. For disease detection, we identified patients with postoperative brain infection through glucose quantitation and daily monitoring by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. For therapeutic evaluation, we investigated drug distribution in blood and CSF systems and validated the function and permeability of blood-brain/CSF-barriers, during therapeutic treatment of patients with cerebral edema for pharmacokinetics study. Our work sheds light on the design of materials for highperformance metabolic analysis and precision diagnostics in real cases.",

We synthesized silver nanoshells (also denoted SiO 2 @Ag) through a hard templating method (Fig. 1a) , and the shell structures can be controlled using multi-cycled silver mirror reactions for LDI MS (Fig. 1b) . The reaction temperature and time were critical and optimized in the synthesis process ( Supplementary Fig. 1 , see also \"Methods\" for details). We prepared mono-dispersed silica particles by the St\u00f6ber method with an average size of 181.8 \u00b1 12.53 nm and polydispersity index (PDI) of 0.203 \u00b1 0.112 as the core materials (Supplementary Table 1 ; Supplementary Fig. 2 ). After the first cycle of silver mirror reaction, we anchored the silver nanoparticles with a size of~2-4 nm onto the surface of silica particles (SiO 2 @Ag-1, Fig. 1c ) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) demonstrated the typical inter planar spacing of 2.04 \u00c5 for silver composites along [2, 0, 0] direction (inset of Fig. 1c) 24, 25 . After multiple cycles (two cycles for SiO 2 @Ag-2, three cycles for SiO 2 @Ag-3, and four cycles for SiO 2 @Ag-4) of silver mirror reactions, we observed the gradual increase of shell thickness and silver nanoparticle size for SiO 2 @Ag-2 ( Fig. 1d) , SiO 2 @Ag-3 (Fig. 1e) , and SiO 2 @Ag-4 ( Fig. 1f) , due to the seed-mediated growth process 26, 27 . We characterized the morphologies of SiO 2 @Ag, showing controlled nanoscaled surface roughness and nano-crevices under scanning electron microscopy (SEM) by the multi-cycled silver mirror reactions ( Fig. 1c-f ). As the electricity/heat insulating materials, the silica cores of SiO 2 @Ag contributed to produce more hot carriers [20] [21] [22] 28 and retained the heat during LDI process, whereas the silver shell can be excited under 355 nm of laser 22, 23, 28 . Moreover, as shown in the elemental mapping analysis ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ) 29, 30 , the distribution of carbon (from the small metabolites), silver (from the shell, affording similar silver nanoparticles densities on surface to Fig. 1e with silver loading ratio of 22.80% by weight), and silicon (from the core) in the nanoshells-metabolites hybrids demonstrated the small molecules were trapped by nano-crevices on the surface of silver nanoshells, which would be crucial for efficient LDI of small metabolites.",

We obtained similar results for three batches of materials in parallel and demonstrated the reproducibility of the synthetic method with no significant difference (p < 0.05, Supplementary Fig. 4a ).

The pure silica particles did not have any UV-Vis absorption peaks similar to reference reports 23, 38 , whereas the SiO 2 @Ag-1/2/3 particles displayed the absorption peak at~436 \u00b1 2.45 nm due to the Mie plasmon resonance excitation from the silver nanoparticles 38, 39 . After the fourth reduction cycle, the absorption peak red shifted to~443 \u00b1 1.63 nm for SiO 2 @Ag-4 (p < 0.05), due to the enhanced plasmon coupling and aggregation of excess silver on the surface of silica core particles (agreed to TEM and SEM, Fig. 1f ). The specific increase in the maximum absorption peak can be observed in Supplementary Fig. 4b for three batches of silver nanoshells in parallel. Notably, the absorption band of silver is close to 355 nm (the wavelength for Nd:YAG laser used for LDI MS), beneficial for matrix use compared with gold nanoparticles 16, 23, 40 . The light absorbance increased and the plasmon resonance peak became broader with higher loading ratio of silver, agreed to TEM, SEM, DLS, and EDX characterizations demonstrating the adjustable properties of silver nanoshells through multi-cycled silver mirror reactions. Compared to previous literatures mostly focused on core-shell particles either with dispersed Ag nanoparticles (~4 nm) on surface 41 or thick (~10-80 nm) densely packed shell structures 39, 42 through surface coating techniques 39, 41-44 , our work was featured with SiO 2 @Ag affording thin (~2-10 nm), discontinuous, and tunable silver nanoshells ( Fig. 1c-e) .",

SiO 2 @Ag-3 with a thin packed silver layer ( Fig. 1 ) afforded structural stability, specific nano-gaps, and surface plasmon resonance, leading to significantly higher performance over the SiO 2 and SiO 2 @Ag-1/2/4. Overloading of silver on the silica (SiO 2 @Ag-4) reduced the analytical efficiency of SiO 2 @Ag-3, owing to the surface aggregation of excess silver on the silica core (Fig. 1f , i; Supplementary Fig. 4b) , rather than clumping of SiO 2 @Ag particles ( Fig. 1g; Supplementary Fig. 11 ). Insufficient loading of silver (SiO 2 and SiO 2 @Ag-1/2) also affected the analytical efficiency of SiO 2 @Ag-3 (Fig. 1e ), due to more surface area from silica cores exposed to metabolites and less specific silver nanocrevices.

The incidence of postoperative central nervous system infection after neurosurgical procedures is~5-7 % globally and even higher if antibiotic prophylaxis is not applied in time, which significantly CSF detection is decisive to identify patients with postoperative brain infection and glucose level in CSF has been affirmed as diagnosis criteria 52, 53 . However, present measurement glucose level in CSF for diagnostics uses the traditional biochemical method, encountering many problems including tedious sample pre-treatment, long time of biochemical reaction, large sample consumption (~200 \u03bcL), and so forth. Using the designer silver nanoshells (within minutes for the overall experiments), we directly detected the Na + -adducted glucose at m/z of 203.26 (Fig. 3a) and Ag + -adducted glucose at m/z of 287.23 and 289.23 (Fig. 3b) , together with mannitol (m/z of 205.28, 289.23, and 291.23) and other small metabolites (Supplementary Table 4 ), consuming 0.5 \u03bcL of native CSF only. Besides the accurate mass measurement, we also performed MS/MS analysis of these signals and compared these results with tandem mass spectra from standards for identification ( Supplementary Figs. 14-17 ). It should be mentioned that LDI MS is usually used for qualitative or at most semi-quantitative analysis, and the MS peak intensity cannot be used for quantification owing to the nonpredictable analyte-dependent ion production behavior. Thus, we coupled isotopic quantification to measure the concentration of glucose for diagnostic purpose in CSF, affording consistent calibration curves with coefficient of determination (R 2 ) of 0.99 using isotopes with six 13 C (Fig. 3c ) and using one 13 C ( Supplementary Fig. 18) . Figure 3d showed one typical mass spectrum of analyte from five experiments ( Supplementary Fig. 19 showing the other four) and its isotope with analyte/isotope (A/I) ratio of 1/1. Notably, compared to the biochemical method based quantification, the sample volume was reduced from 200 to 0.5 \u03bcL and the experiment time was reduced from hours to several minutes by the LDI MS. The isotopic quantification afforded the average recovery of~131% with coefficient of variation (CV) within 6% (Fig. 3c) , which was comparable to the biochemical method that afforded the average recovery of~107% with CV within 14% (Supplementary Fig. 20) . We concluded that the silver nanoshells (SiO 2 @Ag-3)-assisted LDI MS achieved fast, sensitive, accurate, multiplex, quantitative, and reproducible detection of small metabolites in native CSF without any enrichment or purification.",

Different from blood systems, glucose level in CSF is more stable as an energy source for brain and has a vital role in neurotransmitter synthesis and synaptic neurotransmission 54, 55 . Postoperative brain infection causes low glucose levels in CSF due to the metabolism of operation introduced bacteria 53, 56 , and the threshold of glucose level is~2.8-3.9 mM in continued drained CSF as demonstrated in the earlier reports 56, 57 . As displayed in Fig. 3e for a patient with brain infection, the glucose levels were 2.83, 2.88, 3.16, and 2.71 mM for consecutive 4 days after an operation, suggesting postoperative brain infection. For comparison, the as measured glucose levels of a patient without infection were 4.66, 6.12, 5.45, and 5.09 mM using silver nanoshells-assisted LDI MS also for consecutive 4 days (Fig. 3f) . Further, we detected 17 CSF samples from infected patients and 21 CSF samples from uninfected controls by our approach (Fig. 3g) , which showed consistence with the current biochemical method used in hospitals affording coefficient of determination (R 2 ) of 0.92 ( Supplementary Fig. 21 , see also Supplementary Table 5 for details). We obtained the optimized diagnostic sensitivity of 81.6% with specificity of 88.2% based on the cut-off value of 2.85 mM according to the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (area under curve of ROC (AUC) of 0.961, Fig. 3h ). Previous LDI MS approaches were mostly limited to standard analysis, spiked experiments, or imaging tests, considering the difficulties in sample pre-treatment of complex bio-fluids for enrichment and purification. In the above demonstration, we demonstrated clinical diagnosis of patients with postoperative brain infection as well as daily monitoring by advanced LDI MS analysis of CSF, using the silver nanoshells with designer structural parameters.",

            "text": "Pharmacokinetic study in serum and CSF during drug treatment. Pharmacokinetic study guides the overall therapeutics and has been applied universally in clinics during diverse medical treatment. It is instrumental to understand the distribution and metabolism of selected drugs for pharmacokinetic study. For instance, mannitol, a small metabolite, has been long employed for reducing intracranial pressure, and increasing cerebral perfusion and blood flow during clinical treatments 58, 59 . Nevertheless, monitoring concentrations of small metabolites/drugs (e.g., mannitol) in serum and CSF is difficult by traditional electrospray ionization (ESI) MS techniques due to the high samples complexity and low molecular abundance, which requires enrichment or separation (such as, chemo-selective extraction and liquid/gas chromatography) and is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and very expensive for large-scale use [60] [61] [62] . With 0.5 \u03bcL of native serum, we directly obtained the Na + -adducted mannitol at m/z of 205.28 (Fig. 4a) and Ag + -adducted mannitol at m/z of 289.23 and 291.23 (Fig. 4b) , together with glucose (m/z of 203. 26, 287.23, and 289.23 ) and other small metabolite (Supplementary Table 6 ), based on the optimized silver nanoshells. We compared tandem mass spectra of these signals from bio-samples and standards, in addition to the accurate mass measurement for identification (Supplementary Figs. 14-17). As control experiments, we observed no signals by LDI MS without any matrix due to low LDI efficiency (Supplementary Fig. 22a ). We obtained overwhelming background noises with few peaks from small metabolites using organic matrix (e.g., \u03b1-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, CHCA) in Supplementary  Fig. 22b and can only recognize glucose signal using inorganic matrix (gold nanoparticles) in Supplementary Fig. 22c , both of which demonstrated the advantages of silver nanoshells over current matrices in bio-analysis. For diagnostic purpose, we also applied isotopic quantification to measure the concentration of mannitol in serum. The calibration curve afforded a coefficient of determination (R 2 ) of 0.95 in a dynamic range of 100-600 ng \u03bcL \u22121 (Fig. 4c) and high reproducibility in serum detection with a standard deviation of 1.311% for five independent tests ( Supplementary Fig. 23 ). We also examined the stability of silver nanoshells for serum detection and found that SiO 2 @Ag can be capable of LDI MS analysis for at least 5 months (Supplementary Fig. 24) . Notably, despite the high sample complexity of serum, we achieved efficient LDI MS analysis of small metabolites without any sample pre-treatment similar to that in CSF detection and validated the performance of the silver nanoshells (SiO 2 @Ag-3) in complex bio-fluids.",

Notably, the blood and brain/CSF systems are divided by the blood-brain/CSF-barriers, which can only allow specific molecules to pass [63] [64] [65] . In CSF samples analysis of three patients based on the silver nanoshells-assisted LDI MS, mannitol concentrations showed minor increase by~29.41-128.96% before and 30 min after intravenous injection during the therapeutic treatment ( Fig. 4d; Supplementary Table 7 , p < 0.05). In contrast, the mannitol concentrations after drug delivery were significantly higher than untreated ones, showing~45.23-53.35-folds increase in serum samples of the patients (Fig. 4e; Supplementary Fig. 25 ; Supplementary Table 7 , p < 0.05). The blood-brain/CSF-barriers are fundamentally important to maintain the normal physiological activity of living systems, whereas the molecular permeability of the barrier guides the use of drugs in clinical practice [63] [64] [65] . Our results demonstrated the application of silver nanoshells as matrix for LDI MS to investigate the function of blood-brain/CSF-barriers in dividing blood and brain/CSF systems, as well as the permeability enabling the pass of mannitol 66, 67 . Considering the advantages of silver nanoshellsassisted LDI MS over ESI MS that required sample pretreatment 61, 62 and LDI MS using other matrices ( Supplementary  Fig. 22) , we anticipate our approach to engage the advanced pharmacokinetic study of various small metabolites and drugs for large-scale clinical use.",

We synthesized series of silver nanoshells with controlled structures by multi-cycled silver mirror reactions and selected the designer silver nanoshells with optimized analytical performance. We revealed the mechanism for efficient LDI process associated with structural parameters of materials, and demonstrated the application in complex bio-fluids in real cases. Furthermore, coupling with isotopic quantification of selected metabolites (e.g., glucose and mannitol), we not only identified patients with postoperative brain infection by CSF analysis, but also monitored the drug concentrations in both CSF and serum to investigate the blood-brain/CSF-barriers and for pharmacokinetics study. Our work contributes to the design of materials for high-performance metabolic analysis towards precision medicine and initiates the development of diverse advanced diagnostic tools involving various metabolic biomarkers.",
