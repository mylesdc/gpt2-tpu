Accordingly, it seems important to identify and document the coronaviruses in animal reservoirs, many of which are uncharacterized and potentially missed by more standard diagnostic assays. A combination of sensitive deep sequencing technology and computational algorithms is essential for virus surveillance, especially for characterizing novel-or distantly related virus strains. Here, we explore the use of profile Hidden Markov Model-defined Pfam protein domains (Pfam domains) encoded by new sequences as a Coronaviridae sequence classification tool. The encoded domains are used first in a triage to identify potential Coronaviridae sequences and then processed using a Random Forest method to classify the sequences to the Coronaviridae genus level. The application of this algorithm on Coronaviridae genomes assembled from agnostic deep sequencing data from surveillance of bats and rats in Dong Thap province (Vietnam) identified thirty-four Alphacoronavirus and eleven Betacoronavirus genomes. This collection of bat and rat coronaviruses genomes provided essential information on the local diversity of coronaviruses and substantially expanded the number of coronavirus full genomes available from bat and rats and may facilitate further molecular studies on this group of viruses.",

The Pfam protein families database (Finn et al. 2016 ) of >16,000 protein domains is available (Pfam 31.0 at http://Pfam. xfam.org/). Within the Pfam collection, each domain family is defined by a manually selected and aligned set of protein sequences, which is used to construct a profile HMM of the domain. The HMM domain concept and search algorithms for generating and detecting profile HMMs have gone through a number of refinements and a current rapid implementation for finding profile HMMs in novel sequences is HMMER3 (http:// hmmer.org/, Eddy 2011).",

The use of profile Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) for virus classification and discovery was recently reviewed (Reyes et al. 2017) . The use of an HMM structure as the basis for sequence classification has the potential to identify more distant members of protein domain family. Both Metavir (Roux et al. 2011) and VirSorter (Roux et al. 2015 ) make extensive use of protein domains as part of effective virus classification algorithms. The implementation VirSorter is primarily focused on identifying novel bacteriophage sequences. MetLab (Norling et al. 2016 ) and vFAM (Skewes-Cox et al. 2014) methods have demonstrated the utility of such a protein domain classification approach. ClassyFlu (Van der Auwera et al. 2014) builds influenza subtype specific profile HMM-defined protein domains for the HA coding region and then uses this database of HMMs to classify test influenza HA segments.",

The classification is not dependent on a single domain, but rather the composite score of all domains present in the query sequence. This is a strength of the method that can limit false positive identifications which might be due for example, to shorter regions of homology to a bacterial or host or repetitive sequence. The requirement for longer sequence contigs is also a weakness of the method as sufficient query sequence must be available to encode multiple protein domains. This also limits the tool to assembled contigs rather than short read data. In other words, the sensitivity of the classification is directly dependent upon the length of the genomic sequences, that is, higher sensitivity of genus assignment with longer or complete genome sequence. The classification tool provides a robust, rapid, and alignment-free method to classify large sets of more distantly related sequences. Once a database is generated, the algorithm can be used in the field or resource-limited settings and the classification can be performed with typical contig sets within minutes on a standard laptop. With the availability of the platform independent Docker version of the algorithm (see Section 2), scientists can easily run the analyses on any computing platform.",

An additional consideration is that the genus classification of individual Coronaviridae genomes in GenBank may not be correct (mis-annotation), that the genome sequences may include errors (machine errors, PCR errors, chimeric sequences) or have been assembled incorrectly or with sequence duplications or deletions (mis-assemblies).
