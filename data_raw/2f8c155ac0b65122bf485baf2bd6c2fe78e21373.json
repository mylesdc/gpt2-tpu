Viral respiratory tract pathogens, like RSV, influenza and rhinoviruses cause major morbidity and mortality from respiratory tract disease. Furthermore, as viruses have limited means of transmission, viruses that cause pathogenicity in other tissues may be transmitted through the respiratory tract. It is therefore important to chart the human virome in this compartment. We have studied nasopharyngeal aspirate samples diagnosis of respiratory tract infections. We have used a metagenomic sequencing strategy to characterize viruses, as this provides the most unbiased view of the samples. Virus enrichment followed by 454 sequencing resulted in totally 703,790 reads and 110,931 of these were found to be of viral origin by using an automated classification pipeline. The snapshot of the respiratory tract virome of these 210 patients revealed 39 species and many more strains of viruses. Most of the viral sequences were classified into one of three major families; Paramyxoviridae, Picornaviridae or Orthomyxoviridae. The study also identified one novel type of Rhinovirus C, and identified a number of previously undescribed viral genetic fragments of unknown origin.",

A large proportion of these infections have viral etiology, in particular in children. While previous studies have identified a number of viral etiologic agents, such as rhinovirus, coronavirus, influenzavirus, parainfluenzavirus, respiratory syncytial virus and adenovirus, approximately 30% of all presumed viral cases fail diagnostic tests for these agents [2] . Thus, the tests are either inefficient or the causative agent is unrelated to any of the known viruses associated with respiratory infections. In fact, since 2001, several previously undescribed viruses have been identified by analysis of the human respiratory tract, including metapneumovirus [3] , severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [4] and human bocavirus [5] .",

Even so, we have provided a crude characterization of the bacterial content found in these samples along with contigs of other origin.

The pre-assembly screening removed almost a 60% of the 454 reads (see Table S1 ) and the RNA-derived library contained fewer human and repetitive reads as compared to the DNA-derived library. This likely reflected the nature of the input genetic material, where more human and bacterial genomic DNA was carried through to the DNA pool, whereas cellular RNA contributed to a lesser extent to the RNA pools, possibly due to lower stability of cellular RNA compared to viral RNA.

To provide a more reliable list of families and species the list was manually curated to address yet unclassified strains which dilute the species designation. Furthermore, alignments assigned an e-value$1e-5, 184 sequences, could not be reliably classified. The initial overview showed, as expected, that the main virus species that have previously been associated with LRTI (lower respiratory tract infections) in children were present in these samples. For example, families such as Paramyxoviridae, Orthomyxoviridae and Picornaviridae constituted a large proportion of the viral sequences. Within these families several species/types were found and especially within the Picornaviridae family many divergent sequences were found, suggesting the presence of potential new types (see below). Furthermore, we also identified human bocavirus and a multitude of less common viruses, such as measles virus, circovirus and human picobirnavirus.

However, measles cases were reported during the sampling time period, and the measles sequences were most likely derived from one or more actual measles cases. In order to verify this, the sequences were compared to the MMR vaccine strain (AF266290.1). 34 out of 42 contigs (only accounting for contigs which had an alignment towards a database sequence that covered at least 100 bp) showed lower nucleotide identity compared to the vaccine strain than to other measles database entries. Six out of these 34 showed an alignment identity difference of more than 3%. All these six were alignments of more than 200 bp, among them the longest contig of 402 bp, which showed 90.7% identity to the vaccine strain while having 95% identity towards the T11wild strain (AB481087.1).

Human Rhinovirus C (HRV-C) of the Enterovirus genus is a recently discovered species that is associated with severe respiratory infections [19] . The first of the two sequences consisted of 6,858 bp in 7,671 reads thus spanning almost the entire genome. Following the guidelines recently proposed as demarcation criteria for novel types of the HRV-C species [20, 21] this genome was deposited into Genbank under the accession number JF436925 and reported to the Picornaviridae Study Group (2010- [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . The study group has tentatively designated the provided sequence as the prototype sequence of a novel type, HRV-C35. The phylogenetic relationship between HRV-C35, other reported members of the HRV-C and representative types of the HRV-A and -B species is shown in Figure 5 . The second HRV-C sequence which also covered almost the entire genome (6,482 bp in 898 reads) was identical to HRV-C34 (unpublished results), which we previously extracted from these patient samples.

All of the influenza A homologs, except two, were most closely related to the H3N2 subtype, while the two exceptions were most closely related to H9N2. For these two exceptions; the difference in identity between the H9N2 and H3N2 database sequences was small. In context of the vast amounts of H3N2 in the samples and since H9N2 is a bird strain of influenza [22] , although human infections have been described [23] , it is more likely that these two sequences were in fact of H3N2 origin. H3N2 was the predominant influenza A subtype circulating in Stockholm in 2004 and 2005.",

Both aliquots were ultracentrifuged at 41,000 rpm in an SW41 rotor (Beckman) for 90 min. The resulting pellet was recovered, resuspended, and treated with DNase before DNA and RNA were extracted [36] . Extracted DNA and RNA were amplified separately by ''random PCR'' [5, 37] . The primer sequences were then removed from the amplification products by restriction enzyme digest before the amplification products were separated on an agarose gel, and fragments between approximately 400 and 1,500 bp in length were cut out and purified for use as sequencing template. This resulted in a total of 13 DNA libraries and 13 cDNA libraries, which were in turn pooled to two libraries representing the DNA content and the RNA content of the sample, respectively. The DNA and RNA-derived libraries were sequenced separately, using the 454 sequencing platform [35] . The first sequencing run was performed on a GS20 instrument and the second sequencing run was performed on the enhanced GS FLX instrument. Both runs were of two plates each, one DNA and one RNA plate. The sequencing produced in total 703,790 reads, the runs are summarized in Table S1 .

Reads were discarded if more than 70% of the nucleotides were masked, or if highest scoring stretch (given a 1/-5 model for non-N and N respectively) was shorter than 50 bp. The 50 bp threshold was chosen as a cut-off as shorter sequences were both rare and provided little information. The thresholds for the repetitive classification model were determined empirically with the goal of purging only heavily repetitive sequences. The next two steps of the screening process were performed using NCBI BLAST; searching against first the NCBI databases Human Genome Transcripts and then the Human Genome database [13] . At each consecutive step further reads were discarded if a homolog was found at or above 90% identity covering at least 80% of the query sequence.
