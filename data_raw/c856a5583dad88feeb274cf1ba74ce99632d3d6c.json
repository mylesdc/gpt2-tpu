Although PEDV induced cell apoptosis has been established in vitro and in vivo, the functional protein that contributes to this event remains unclear. Methods: The activation or cleavage of main apoptosis-associated molecular such as AIFM1, caspase-3, caspase-8, caspase-9 and PARP in PEDV infected host cells were analyzed by western blotting. The nuclear change of infected cell was monitored by confocal immunofluorescence assay. The overexpressing plasmids of 16 non-structural proteins (Nsp1-16) and 6 structural proteins (M, N, E, ORF3, S1 and S2) were constructed by cloning. Cell apoptosis induced by PEDV or overexpression non-structural or structural proteins was measured by the flow cytometry assay. Results: PEDV could infect various host cells including Vero, Vero-E6 and Marc-145 and cause obvious cytopathic effects, including roundup, cell fusion, cell membrane vacuolation, syncytium formation and cause apparent apoptosis. In infected cells, PEDV-induced apoptosis is accompanied by nuclear concentration and fragmentation as a result of caspase-3 and caspase-8 activation and AIFM1 and PARP cleavage. Overexpression of S1 Spike protein of PEDV SM98 strain effectively induced host cell apoptosis, while the expression of the other non-structure proteins (Nsp1-16) and structural proteins (M, N, E, S2 and ORF3) has no or less effect on cell apoptosis. Similarly, expression of S1 protein from wild-type strain BJ2011 or cell-adapted strain CV777, also induce apoptosis in transfected cells. Finally, we demonstrated that the S1 proteins from various coronavirus family members such as TGEV, IBV, CCoV, SARS and MERS could also induce Vero-E6 cells apoptosis. Conclusion: S1 Spike protein is one of the most critical functional proteins that contribute to cell apoptosis. Expression of S1 proteins of the coronavirus tested in this study could all induce cell apoptosis suggesting S1 maybe is an effective inducer in Coronavirus-induced cell apoptosis and targeting S1 protein expression probably is a promising strategy to inhibit coronavirus infection and thus mediated apoptosis on host cells.",

Deceased piglets presented with thin and almost transparent small intestines containing undigested milk curdles. The etiological agent PED virus (PEDV) was first isolated and recognized from Europe in the 1970s [1, 2] , then it was spread and prevalent in Asian for decades [3, 4] . PEDV originally caused a relatively mild and sporadic disease. However, since more virulent variant strains appeared in 2010 [5] [6] [7] [8] , PEDV has been subsequently associated with severe outbreaks of diarrheal disease [9] in Asia and in North American [10] [11] [12] [13] . Acute PEDV outbreaks normally resulted in enormous economic losses to swine industries around the world, for instance, in 2013 to 2014 PEDV killed more than 7 million pigs in the North American [14] . Currently, PEDV poses a serious threat to the swine industry worldwide.",

The genome of PEDV is about 28 kb and comprises of a 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR), at least 7 open reading frames (ORF1a, ORF1b, and ORF2-6), and a 3' UTR. The ORF 1a and 1b cover the 5\u2032-proximal two-thirds of the genome coding for replicase polyprotein (pp) la and pp1ab, respectively [15, 16] . These pp1a and pp1ab can be cleaved by internal proteases generating 16 nonstructural proteins, namely nsp1-16. ORF2-6 encode four structural proteins including the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, while ORF3 encodes an accessory protein [15] . The large spikes on the coronavirus envelope are composed of trimers of the spike proteins. The spike protein mediates viral entry into host cells by functioning as a class I viral fusion protein [17] . During maturation, the spike protein is often cleaved into a receptor-binding subunit S1 and a membrane-fusion subunit S2 [18] .",

Among all the structural proteins of PEDV SM98 strain, S1 protein has the predominant capability to induce apoptosis while nuclear protein N, spike protein S2 and ORF3 have no effect on apoptosis induction. Membrane protein (M) and Nonstructural protein Nsp1, Nsp3, Nsp5, Nsp6 and Nsp7 also induce cell apoptosis but to variable less extents, as shown in Fig. 6a .

The S1 proteins in new-emerging and cell adapted PEDV strains also induce cell apoptosis Next, we asked whether the S1 protein of other different PEDV strains could also induce apoptosis in different host cells. The S1 genes of CV777, a cell-adapted PEDV strain, and BJ2011, a new emerging wild-type PEDV isolated from Beijing in 2011 (The relationship of these PEDV S proteins has been analyzed and reported previously in our laboratory) [20] , were constructed in fusion with EGFP in pEGFP-N1 vector. Surprisingly, transfection S1 gene of CV777 and BJ2011 effectively induce monolayer Vero-E6 cells apoptosis. The similar result was also observed in transfected BHK-21 cells (Fig. 7a) . Collectively, this result suggested that S1 protein is the determinant protein in PEDV infection-induced cell apoptosis, and this function is less dependent on virus biological or genetic differences. Percentages of apoptotic cells are shown with graphs in Fig. 7b and c respectively. This suggested that S1 protein probably is the most critical protein-mediated PEDV-induced apoptosis.",

Mechanically, PEDV SM98 and CV777 virus infection induced a significant cleavage on AIFM1 suggested an involvement of mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis pathway, which is consistent with previous observation [19] . Besides this pathway, we found the extrinsic apoptotic pathway was also activated by SM98 and CV777 infection as caspase-8, caspase3 and PARP were all cleaved in response to PEDV virus infection. This study enriched the knowledge of the PEDV infection induced apoptosis through a complicated pattern, apart from the mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis pathway, the extrinsic apoptotic pathway was also activated, no matter whether or not it is original. Consistently, many viruses from coronavirus family induced apoptosis with caspase activation: such as TGEV could cause infected ST cells apoptosis in a caspase-dependent way, accompanied by DNA cleavage and mitochondrial transmembrane potential change [21] ; IBV could cause a caspase-dependent apoptosis, as characterized by chromosomal condensation, DNA fragmentation, caspase-3 activation, and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase degradation [22] ; CCoV, is responsible for enteric disease (diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, loss of appetite and occasional death) in young puppies [23, 24] , could cause infected cells apoptosis with activation caspase-3 [23] ; SARS-CoV infection could results in the downregulation of Bcl-2, the activation of caspase-3, as well as the upregulation of Bax, suggesting the involvement of the caspase family and the activation of the mitochondrial signaling pathway [25] . MERS-CoV could efficiently infect human primary T lymphocytes and activates the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathway [26] .

Antigenic variations of PEDV spike protein (S) between these two groups were thought to contribute to the severity of recent outbreaks [27, 28] , as the S protein plays a pivotal role in cell adsorption, membrane fusion, and induction of neutralizing antibodies [29, 30] . Here we demonstrate that S1 protein indeed is a predominant apoptosis inducer (while S2 is not) among all the structural and nonstructural proteins of PEDV, although M and Nsp1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9 and 13 also induce cell apoptosis but to a less extent. Furthermore, the S1 protein of circulating variant strain PEDV BJ2011 also induce significant apoptosis in host cells, and the ability to induce apoptosis in Vero-E6 is greater than that of the cell adapted strain, such as CV777. This suggested S1 protein is a critical protein mediated PEDV-induced cell apoptosis and contributes partly to its virulence, which is consistent with our laboratory's recent report [31] . Among all the identified proteins capable inducing apoptosis in host cells, the M protein is the most abundant component of the viral envelope and plays a central role in virus morphogenesis and assembly via its interactions with other viral proteins [32] . The pro-apoptotic role of the SARS-CoV M protein has been revealed by disrupting the interaction of PDK1 with PKB/ Akt [33, 34] . This suggests that PEDV M protein may also activate apoptosis through this pathway. 3C-like protease (3CLpro) has been demonstrated could cause cell growth arrest and apoptosis in SARS-CoV 3CLpro-expressing human promonocyte cells [35] . Similarly, the pro-apoptotic function of PEDV Nsp5 i.e. 3C-like protease also has observed in this study. Coronavirus Nsp1 is the first N-terminal cleavage product of the pp1a and pp1a/b polyproteins [36] . Coronavirus Nsp1 regulates host cell and virus gene expression [37] that functions as a potent IFN antagonist. PEDV Nsp1 has been demonstrated could block the nuclear translocation of IRF1 and reduce the number of peroxisomes to suppress IRF1-mediated type III IFNs activities [38] . Here we identified a novel function of PEDV Nsp1 as an inducer of apoptosis. Coronaviruses can infect a wide range of mammals and birds, but exhibit a marked tropism for epithelial cells of the respiratory and enteric tracts, as well as for macrophages [16, 39] , and most of them can induce apoptosis in infected host cells. Although a number of cellular mechanisms and gene products (such as the SARS-CoV M, N protein [34, 40] and 3C-like protease (3CLpro) [35] ) capable of inducing apoptosis have been revealed, the S1 protein of these coronaviruses have not yet well-evaluated. Although the amino acid sequence of these S proteins are divergent greatly (Additional file 1: Table S1 ), here we demonstrated that S1 proteins of all these coronaviruses tested in this study were able to induce apoptosis in transfected Vero-E6 cells. Given the fact that a number of coronaviruses gene products could induce apoptosis in host cells, it is proposed that the spike protein S1 may function as a cofactor that could enhance or stimulate extrinsic apoptotic pathway in these coronavirus induced apoptosis.",
