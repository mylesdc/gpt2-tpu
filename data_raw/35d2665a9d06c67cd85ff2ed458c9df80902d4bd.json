Genetic association studies can potentially identify such interactions. However, extensive and correlated genetic population structure in hosts and pathogens presents a substantial risk of confounding analyses. Moreover, the multiple testing burden of interaction scanning can potentially limit power. We present a Bayesian approach for detecting host influences on pathogen evolution that exploits vast existing data sets of pathogen diversity to improve power and control for stratification. The approach models key processes, including recombination and selection, and identifies regions of the pathogen genome affected by host factors. Our simulations and empirical analysis of drug-induced selection on the HIV-1 genome show that the method recovers known associations and has superior precision-recall characteristics compared to other approaches. We build a high-resolution map of HLA-induced selection in the HIV-1 genome, identifying novel epitope-allele combinations.",

            "text": "V ariation in multiple host factors, both genetic and nongenetic, can influence the genetic composition of infecting pathogens and their subsequent evolutionary trajectory within a host. Examples, include human leukocyte antigen (HLA) restriction of epitopes and subsequent escape in HIV-1 and other viruses [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] , drug-induced selection pressure and appearance of drug-resistance mutations in viruses, bacteria and eukaryotic pathogens [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] and interactions between polymorphic red-blood cell types and malarial disease 14, 15 . Consequently, the molecular mechanisms underlying diverse pathogen-related processes including infection, invasion, immune-response and drug resistance, can potentially be uncovered by studying the association between host factors and the genetic composition of pathogens 16-22 . However, while it is now feasible to collect large-scale data on pathogen genomic variation and host parameters, reliable hypothesis-free detection of biologically meaningful associations between host factors and pathogen diversity is challenging for several reasons; the greatest of which is population structure. Host genetic variation often has a strong spatial structure arising from historical patterns of isolation and gene flow. Because of their commensal nature and mode of transmission, most pathogens are likely to share some of this structure, leading to noncausal association between host and pathogen genetic variation. For the same reason, geographical heterogeneity among host factors that influence pathogens causally (e.g., local variation in treatment protocols) may also lead to indirect correlation between host and pathogen genetics.",

Standard association tests, which suffered the problems of stratification described above, were superseded by methods that utilise an inferred phylogeny of pathogen samples to correct for relatedness 17, 22, [25] [26] [27] [28] . Moreover, additional power can be obtained by explicit modelling of the processes of escape and reversion in the context of HLA restriction of HIV-1 17, 22, 23 . However, such approaches have a number of limitations. For example, they do not consider recombination in pathogen genomes, they do not make use of all the data available, they typically do not infer the strength of host-induced selection or combine information across nearby sites in the context of epitope mapping and the more sophisticated approaches are often computationally prohibitive for very large samples.",

The approach is motivated by the presence of extremely large databases of pathogen genomic data. Given the size of the databases (e.g., the Los Alamos database on HIV-1 has over 150,000 sequences encoding a portion of reverse transcriptase), it is likely that there are sequences closely related to those that infected the individuals within a particular study in question. Our approach aims to infer the most likely ancestral infecting sequence (which may be a mosaic of those in the database) for each individual and therefore to identify the pathogen evolution that has resulted directly from exposure to the current host. Moreover, we model correlations in evolution among adjacent sites within the pathogen that arise through being a shared target of selection (e.g., within a restricted HLA epitope or within a region of a protein where drug resistance and consequent compensatory mutations can evolve). A diagram of the underlying process and our modelling framework is shown in Fig. 1 . Our methods and inference regime are detailed in the Methods and Supplementary Methods. We show that the approach has substantially improved power to detect sites under selection and, through applications to the evolution of drug resistance and escape from HLA-drive immune-restriction in HIV-1, how the method can deliver new insight into important biological processes.",

To validate the method and compare its performance to alternative approaches for detecting host-induced selection we carried out three simulation studies. First, we simulated data under the fitted model to evaluate power and accuracy. We used HIV-1 protease sequence data from three major public databases as a reference (Table 1; n \u00bc 162; 901), and simulated 100 replicates of a data set of 460 study sequences with six different HLA-induced selection profiles, four of which were common (n \u00bc 100 each) and two of which were rare (n \u00bc 30 each); Supplementary Fig. 1 . We Fig. 1 The underlying process and our approximation. a The underlying process: infected hosts are circles, coloured by host factor information. Coloured strips represent the consensus pathogen sequence within infected hosts, and arrows indicate the direction of infection. Sampled hosts with pathogen sequence information are outlined. A red outline indicates that host factor information is also available. b Our approximation: pathogen sequences in D are generated from D B , modulated by host factors of D. As jD B j ) 0, we assume D B is the set of all possible sequences an individual can be infected with. Members of D arise from D B through recombination and mutation. We assume all selection along a lineage connecting each member of D to its closest neighbour in D B (subject to recombination) occurred within the host that the member of D was isolated from. Thus only host factor information for D is required. In b, there is one green host factor, h. Recombination, shown by the arrow, results in the colouring of the sequence. Three mutations have occurred: one due to h-associated selection (red star), one reversion (green circle), and one synonymous transition (black cross) performed simulations with recombination ranging between 0 and 0.01 (a rate of 0.01 meaning that on average the ancestor of each study sample copies 100 contiguous codons from a reference sample before recombination). We performed joint inference on the HLA-associated selection parameters across the viral sequence and examined how the size of the sample-specific reference panel (range: 10-100) affects estimates. Motivation behind the use of sample-specific reference panel and our approach is given in the Methods subsection: Restricting D B : sample-specific reference data sets. In the absence of recombination, parameter estimates are largely unbiased and accurate, although the rate of reversion has high variance ( Fig. 2 ; Supplementary Fig. 2 ). Estimates for rare alleles perform similarly to those for common alleles (Fig. 2b) . We find little impact of the size of the sample-specific reference data set and the posterior distributions are well calibrated ( Supplementary Fig. 3) . Recombination leads to a downward bias in estimates of recombination and selection intensity and upward bias in the rate of reversion ( Fig. 2c ; Supplementary  Fig. 4 ) and consequently poorer posterior calibration at sites under selection ( Supplementary Fig. 4) . Nevertheless, the inferred profiles of host-dependent and host-independent selection pressures remain strongly correlated to the truth. We also considered the impact of error in choosing the sample-specific reference panel by forcing inclusion of the sequences actually copied. We find that forcing the true ancestors to be included improves accuracy by only a small margin ( Supplementary Fig. 5 ) indicating that 100 potential ancestors chosen through Hamming distance is typically sufficient.",

In each case, we assume that the wild-type consensus strain is correctly defined and set any nonsynonymous difference from consensus as a candidate for escape. For each method, we obtained p values or parameter estimates that provide a metric for the strength of selection conditional on each HLA type and generated receiver operating characteristic curves for each simulation (Fig. 2e) . We find that our approach dramatically increases sensitivity for a given false-positive rate (FPR). For example, at FPR = 0.01, our sensitivity is 0.61, compared to the second best-performing method, PhyloD, at 0.13. To assess whether the difference between methods decreases with sample size, we repeated the analysis with 3000 query sequences. Our method achieves a sensitivity of 0.81 (at an FPR of 0.01), compared to the next best-performing method, PhyloD, at 0.22 ( Supplementary Fig. 7) .

The LOO strategy only boosts power if the reference panel is of the order of the sample size.

We used viral sequence data from Botswana (n \u00bc 343, protease only) to simulate ancestors and the empirical distribution of HLA genotype frequencies from this sample. We measured the accuracy of estimates (both in terms of bias and calibration of posteriors) for different protease reference panels, ranging from the ideal panel (i.e., the ancestors used in the simulation), to that used in this study, to one that considered only the 57,969 sequences known not to come from Botswana. The latter panel maximises differentiation and also introduces the potential problem of sequences within D typically being more closely related to each other than to members of D B . Results are summarised in Supplementary Figs. 9-11. In terms of bias (summarised by the frequency-weighted root mean square error (RMSE) between true and inferred HLA-associated selection profiles) we find relatively little differences between panels, with the most diverged reference panel being only 3% worse than the best. The estimator was well calibrated for each reference panel used: 95% and 50% credible intervals contained the true value at between 91-98% and 45-57% of sites across bootstrap replicates, respectively. Typically, the LOO strategy had little effect on estimator performance. We conclude that the approach gives substantial robustness to population structure and within-sample relatedness, enabling the integration of highly diverse data sets, though note that very highly diverged reference data sets (for example, consisting of a separate subtype) will perform poorly.",

In a-d, (except \u03c9 in a), averages are taken over 100 independent MCMC runs on independent simulated data with the same underlying parameters. The true value is shown in blue, mean and median estimates are in black and red, respectively. White bands enclose 50% credible intervals, in turn enclosed by grey 95% credible intervals. In c, the truth is rescaled by the average number of individuals between a randomly chosen pair of leaves in the sampled birth-death tree. For \u03c9 in a, averages are taken over a single-MCMC run, chosen at random as \u03c9 differs across simulation runs (sampled from the prior). See Supplementary Figs. 2-5 for full results summaries. e ROC curves for existing method. Six methods used to identify HLA-associated selection on viral sequence are applied to data simulated under the birth-death process used in simulation study 2. The Inset zooms in to the region enclosed by the black box. ROC curves for 100 independent birth-death simulations are lightly coloured, and averaged to generate the heavier lines. ROC curves for Fryer Approx, PhyloD and PhyloD OR do not extend to (1, 1) . For Fryer Approx this is because we stop our threshold for estimated rates at 0. For PhyloD and PhyloD OR, it is because many sites will not be included in leaf distribution or logistic regression respectively. Source data are provided as a Source Data file antibody response, or the APOBEC3G response) will be captured by \u03c9. We analysed protease and reverse transcriptase independently and excluded integrase due to lack of data 9 . Priors on parameters are given in Supplementary Table 1 . We defined the collection of sequences in hosts not receiving any therapy at the time of sequencing as D B , and viral sequences in hosts receiving any treatment (coupled with their drug regime data) as D. To guarantee the presence of variation in drug selection we introduce a null class by randomly assigning 2,000 sequences from D B to D. Details of data preparation are given in the Supplementary Methods subsection: Query and reference data set preparation. We estimated \u03b3 h;i for protease and reverse transcriptase inhibitors prescribed to at least 10 individuals in D ( Fig. 3a ; Supplementary Fig. 12 ), and identified sites with very strong evidence for drug-induced escape (median estimate of selection factor >2 and at least 97.5% of the posterior >1; top-tier) and moderate evidence (median estimate of selection factor >1.5 and at least 90% of the posterior >1; second-tier). We compared the enrichment of sites identified to known (experimentally validated) major drug resistance mutations (DRMs) 9 (Fig. 3b) . For some drugs, DRM data was lacking because the drug is no longer commonly used (DDC and DLV), was an experimental drug that failed (\u03b1APA, and ADV) or is now used in small amounts with other drugs (RTV). We observed strong, statistically significant and consistent enrichment of DRMs at sites identified as selected; with elevated enrichment (as measured by odds ratio) in the strongest DRMs and sites with strongest evidence for selection. For example, of the 31 strongest DRMs in reverse transcriptase, 11 are found in the top-tier selected sites and a further 6 in the second-tier. Of the 41 apparent false positive sites, 17 are described as being selected for in the literature (but not classified as a major DRM in the Stanford database); for example mutation at codon 11 of reverse transcriptase is known to be associated with minor reductions in APV susceptibility 29 , but is not classified as a major DRM 9 . A further three apparent false positive are DRMs for treatment cocktails including the drug, nine are sites of DRMs for drugs in the same class but where more specific information is not provided, seven are DRMs for different drugs in the same class and only five appear to have no support in the literature (Supplementary Table 2 ). False negatives are caused by sites where the selected codon is more than one nucleotide change away from the consensus (five mutations), one is an insertion, eight have in vitro support for drug resistance but are not documented as being selected for in vivo, seven have no compelling evidence in the literature and three are genuinely missed (Supplementary Table 3) 9 . Further evidence for the biological validity of the inferred profiles is given by the coclustering of related drugs in trees constructed from the selection intensity profiles ( Supplementary Fig. 13 ). In summary, we find that the method can identify sites selected by specific drug treatments in vivo, either directly through resistance or indirectly through compensation for resistance mutations that reduce fitness.",

While the extent to which host HLA alleles can influence patterns of escape and reversion in HIV-1 has been studied extensively, the methods developed here provide additional power and accuracy as well as provide control against factors such as population stratification and recombination. Moreover, the methody also provides a framework in which to combine data from multiple previous studies. We have assembled nearly 3000 HIV-1 sequences from patients with known HLA class I genotypes from six studies, of European and African ancestry representing a mixture of subtype B and C sequences ( Table 2) . We augmented the data with HIV-1 genome data taken from three sources, representing 250,000-280,000 sequences depending on the gene (Table 1) . We analysed the data in two ways, first by considering escape as deviation from subtype B and also by considering escape from subtype C. We expect these analyses to yield similar results, except at sites where subtypes differ systematically. We analysed data from protease and reverse transcriptase and inferred the impact of alleles at HLA class I loci (at 2-digit resolution) jointly. We restricted analysis to HLA alleles with at least 10 representatives in the data. We truncated to 2-digit HLA resolution to boost power as the majority of alleles are rare (61% of 4-digit HLA alleles have <10 copies, compared to 30% at 2-digit resolution). Further, 27.3% of the individuals for whom we have HLA information were typed to the 2-digit level. Full details of data preparation are given in the Supplementary Methods subsection: Query and reference data set preparation. We define 'top-tier' HLA-associated candidate sites as those where the median \u03b3 h;i > 2 and the lower 2.5% quantile > 1, and 'second-tier' candidate sites as those where the 10% quantile of \u03b3 h;i > 1.",

This may reflect a historical bias towards studies being carried out in European-ancestry populations with subtype B viruses where some HLA alleles and viral epitopes are rare. However, we also note that results between the subtype B and subtype C consensus analyses are highly concordant, with a few interesting exceptions. For example, B*58 shows evidence for inducing strong selection away from the subtype B consensus around codon 122-123 of reverse transcriptase but not away from the subtype C consensus. Interestingly, this is a position of divergence between subtype B and subtype C viruses and B*58 is typically more common in populations with HIV-1 subtype C viruses, suggesting that B*58-induced selection pressure may have driven the fixation of the difference between subtypes. More generally, we found that average selection intensity away from the subtype C consensus in individuals carrying subtype B virus is significantly stronger than the average selection intensity away from the subtype B consensus (Supplementary Fig. 20 : protease p \u00bc 2:8 10 \u00c05 , reverse transcriptase p \u00bc 2:0 10 \u00c06 ; see Methods subsection: The impact of HLA on HIV-1 sequence evolution for details), though only reverse transcriptase was significant in the inverse setting (p \u00bc 0:0058, protease p \u00bc 0:70). Moreover, we estimate that the combined contribution of HLA-associated diversifying selection to non-synonymous viral sequence change represents 59 and 77% of selection from subtype B and C consensus in protease, and 61 and 78% in reverse transcriptase (Methods subsection: Testing the impact of HLA on HIV-1 subtype differentiation, and Supplementary Table 8 ). In summary, we estimate that HLAdriven selection accounts for more than half of all HIV-1 coding changes and has contributed to diversification between subtypes.",

While only strictly possible in experimental systems, observational approaches aim to learn about the same processes, but, to do so, have to make assumptions about the (unobserved) pool of pathogens to which infected individuals were exposed and the distribution of potential confounding factors. If assumptions are not met, power to detect true associations will be reduced and there is a risk of false positive results. The introduction of phylogenetic methods for association testing in pathogen genomics 17, [20] [21] [22] 25, 26, 39 provided a partial solution to many issues, by using genome-wide relatedness between pathogens as a proxy for correlation in unobserved confounding (such as population structure), similar to the use of principal components in the analysis of human genetic association 40 . Moreover, by developing explicit models of molecular evolution in response to host factors, it is possible to learn relative or even actual rates of escape and reversion 17 .

The evolutionary response reflects the combination of fitness gains of escape and the fitness loss through modification. Hence, sites with strong resistance may have too strong a fitness cost to be typically selected for and weak resistance changes that have little fitness impact may be strongly selected for. Moreover, compensatory changes in the pathogen genome can potentially counteract fitness loss and hence appear as part of the resistance response. Our analysis of drug-associated evolution using data from the Los Alamos database identifies the majority of major DRMs; sites not identified typically result from failings of the model (variants that are more than one change away from the consensus codon, insertions and deletions).

However, we also found that simple in silico epitope prediction fails to provide a good predictor of the HIV-1 evolutionary response and multiple cases where curated epitopes do not appear to lead to a substantial selective pressure. We also showed a preponderance of signals of escape associated with HLA-B alleles, as opposed to HLA-A and HLA-C and identified a number of sites where differences between subtype consensus sequences collocate with sites selected by particular HLA alleles. Furthermore, by contrasting the aggregate HLA-associated selection in hosts of subtype B viruses with hosts of subtype C viruses, we observed differential signals of selection at sites distinguishing subtype B and C, supporting the hypothesis that differences in HLA allele frequency between populations could have contributed to the differentiation of HIV-1 subtypes 43 . As field-based sequencing of pathogens becomes feasible, so does the potential to accumulate vast data sets that can track spatial and temporal shifts in selection pressures affecting pathogens and their responses. Such studies will require new approaches to studying genetic association.

Our goal is to estimate the location and nature of host-associated selection upon the pathogen genome sequence through statistical analysis of association between host factor and pathogen genomic variation. We desire our method to have four properties: the ability to use all available pathogen sequence data, irrespective of whether host factors have been measured; the ability to measure the evidence for selection across the genome analysed in a hypothesis-free manner; the ability to combine information across neighbouring positions where appropriate; and the ability to account for confounding factors such as recombination and population structure. To meet these requirements we have developed a Bayesian model-based approach in which we use an approximation to the coalescent with recombination and codon-level selection 42 . In extension to the earlier work, we enable host-specific factors to influence patterns of variation and consider the case of two data sets. The first, D, represents the collection of pathogen sequences for which host factor data (e.g., HLA genotype or drug treatment) is also available. The second, D B , represents a much larger data sets of pathogen sequences for which host factor data is not available. We use D B to model the set of potential pathogen sequences that a host can be infected with (allowing for recombination) and assume that genetic differences between this reference panel and D largely reflects evolution within the host. Thus host-induced selection will result in an association between host factors and the evolutionary changes observed in D. A cartoon of the underlying process and our model is shown in Fig. 1 .",

This is analogous to the 'block-like' model used by Wilson and McVean 42 . Imposing this window structure allows information about HLA-dependent selection (and reversion) to be combined across sites. This makes sense in a biological setting where sites close together in the coding sequence may result in amino acids lying in the same epitope or close together in the protein structure. The window model will act to smooth across sites, but will be overwhelmed if a given site is subject to strong HLA-dependent selection 42 . How strict the window model is depends on the expected number of windows, which is controlled by the parameter p w (see the merge and split moves in Supplementary Methods MCMC moves subsection, and Wilson and McVean 42 ). If p w \u00bc 1, the number of selection windows is equal to the number of sites, if p w \u00bc 0 then there is just one selection window. The piecewise constant prior is extremely flexible. Using a piecewise constant prior in combination with MCMC moves to shrink/expand and merge/ split these blocks allows us to explore the space of HLA-associated selection rapidly while maintaining a far smaller number of parameters than considering HLA-associated selection site by site.

Differentiation between the query and reference data sets can potential lead to reduced performance of estimators due to two factors: confounding between covariates that are non causal (for example differences in both HLA allele frequency and viral genetic diversity due to genetic drift) and relatedness within the query population leading to poorly calibrated estimates. To assess the impact of population differentiation on performance of our estimator we carried out a parametric bootstrap simulation, using viral sequence data from the Botswana study (n = 343, protease only) to simulate ancestors infecting a set of hosts with HLA allele frequencies drawn from the Botswana population. We used the evolutionary parameters estimated within this study (including the HLA-associated selection profiles, dN dS , and recombination probabilities) and performed 100 independent simulations of 1,500 query sequences with associated HLA information. For each simulation we then performed inference using a range of reference data sets and also considered a leaveone-out (LOO) strategy in which the reference data are augmented by all sequences from the query data set except for the sequence under consideration. These will typically be the most closely related to the query data. The reference data sets we consider are:",

At each site we then calculate (using the inferred evolutionary parameters) the average selection away from each subtype consensus in those hosts harbouring the subtype B and C viruses separately. In this way, we obtain an approximation of the average HLA-associated selective pressure away from the subtype B/C consensus in the geographic regions in which subtype B and subtype C viral sequences predominantly reside. For example, letting S C be the set of subtype C viral samples, H j be the HLA profile of the host in which viral sequence j resides, and \u03b3 B h;i denote HLA h associated selection away from subtype B at site i",
