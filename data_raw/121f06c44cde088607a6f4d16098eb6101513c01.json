The incidence of osteonecrosis, serum lipid levels and the mRNA and protein expression of transforming growth factor \u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) in the proximal femur were measured 1, 2, 4 and 8 weeks after the last MPSL (or saline) injection. Results: The incidence of osteonecrosis in the PEMF group (29%) was significantly lower than that observed in the MPSL group (75%), while no osteonecrosis was observed in the PS group. The serum lipid levels were significantly lower in the PEMF and PS groups than in the MPSL group. Compared with the MPSL and PS groups, the mRNA expression of TGF-\u03b21 increased, reaching a peak 1 week after PEMF treatment, and remained high for 4 weeks, then declined at 8 weeks, whereas the protein expression of TGF-\u03b21 increased, reaching a peak at 2 weeks after PEMF treatment, and remained high for 8 weeks. Conclusions: PEMF stimulation can prevent steroid-induced osteonecrosis in rats, and the underlying mechanisms involve decreased serum lipid levels and increased expression of TGF-\u03b21.",

In addition, it was used successfully for the treatment of osteonecrosis of the femoral head, especially at the early stage [11, 12] , but relatively little is known about its effects on preventing steroid-induced osteonecrosis. Furthermore, the mechanisms of PEMF stimulation for the prevention of steroid-induced osteonecrosis remained unclear, and the optimal protocol for PEMF should be explored [13] . Transforming growth factor \u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21), involved in bone remodeling, is a multifunctional cytokine. It plays an important role in controlling osteoblast proliferation and differentiation in vivo [14] . Some studies demonstrate that mechanical interruption by lipid emboli in the nutrient vessels can lead to vascular occlusion, and hyperlipidemia has been linked to the development of osteonecrosis [15, 16] . We proposed that PEMF may be beneficial in preventing steroid-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head, and the underlying mechanisms involve decreased serum lipid levels and increased the expression of TGF-\u03b21. As a preventive therapy, PEMF could be used in combination with corticosteroid for treatment of many clinical conditions, such as AIDS and SLE, which require high-dose corticosteroid treatment.",

The concentration of RNA was quantified by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm (A 260 ). The purity of RNA was assessed by determining the A 260 /A 280 ratio. The integrity and size distribution of RNA were confirmed by formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. The RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Fermentas Life Sciences, EU) was used to synthesize complementary DNA (cDNA). TGF-\u03b21 cDNA was amplified by PCR using the primers 5'-GGCGGTGCTCGCTTT GTA-3' (forward) and 5'-GCGGGTGACTTCTTTGGC-3' (reverse) (amplification product size 106 bp) [Gen-Bank: NM021578]. \u03b2-actin cDNA was amplified as an internal control using the primers 5'-TGGTGGGTA TGGGTCAGAAGG-3' (forward) and 5'-ATGGCTGGG GTGTTGAAGGTC-3' (reverse) (amplification product size 265 bp) [GenBank: NM031144]. The cycle parameters of the reaction system included an initial denaturation step of 94\u00b0C for 5 min; amplification consisted of 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 60\u00b0C for 30 s and 72\u00b0C for 45 s, followed by a final extension step of 72\u00b0C for 10 min. Thirty cycles (\u03b2-actin) and thirty-five cycles (TGF-\u03b21) of amplification were performed. PCR amplification products were analyzed by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis, stained with ethidium bromide and photographed by the Geliance 200 Imaging System (PerkinElmer, USA). The optical density of the bands was analyzed with Quantity One software (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Gene expression was reported as the optical density ratios of TGF-\u03b21 to \u03b2-actin.",

The histopathology of osteonecrosis generated in this model was characterized by empty lacunae or pyknotic nuclei of osteocytes accompanied by surrounding bone marrow cell necrosis, which was similar to osteonecrosis in steroid-treated patients. However, there are some differences in the osteonecrosis observed in rats as compared to humans. For example, osteonecrosis often leads to femoral head collapse in humans but not in rats, as the epiphyseal line of the femur is permanent in adult rats but not in adult humans. In addition, the metabolic rates are higher in rats than in humans, so osteonecrosis can be observed in rats within one week after steroid treatment [19] . In the present study, the incidence of osteonecrosis (in the MPSL group) was 75%, and no rats died during the experimental period, indicating that this rat model is safe and effective. Thus, this model is useful for steroidinduced osteonecrosis studies. Since Bassett et al. [20] first reported the therapeutic effects of PEMF in bone healing in 1974, the treatment was widely used in nonunion fractures and related bone healing problems. Different parameters of PEMF, such as frequency, intensity and stimulation time, were manipulated in clinical and experimental studies. However, the optimal parameters of PEMF are not known. In this study, the choice of PEMF parameters was based on a report by Ishida et al. [13] , in which they found that PEMF could reduce the risk of steroid-induced osteonecrosis. We used the same electromagnetic frequency, changed the stimulation time from 10 h to 4 h per day, and obtained a similar incidence of osteonecrosis.",

Several researchers have shown that steroid-induced osteonecrosis can be prevented by anticoagulants or lipid-lowering agents, with reductions in osteonecrosis that range from 30% to 40% [21, 22] . Our study showed similar prevention effects, and no rat suffered tissue damage due to the PEMF treatment. Therefore, PEMF stimulation is a safe and effective treatment for preventing osteonecrosis. We also found that the incidence of osteonecrosis in the MPSL group displayed a progression, while that in the PEMF group did not. In the MPSL group, the incidence of osteonecrosis increased to a peak at 4 weeks after the last MPSL injection and then declined at 8 weeks. It is interesting that the serum lipid levels in the MPSL group showed a similar trend, increasing to a peak at 2 weeks after the last MPSL injection and declining at 4 weeks. This finding might indicate that hyperlipidemia contributes to the pathogenesis of osteonecrosis.",

In addition, lipid-lowering agents were used to prevent osteonecrosis and revealed satisfactory results [21, 22] . The data indicated that hyperlipidemia may be one of the pathological mechanisms of steroid-induced osteonecrosis. Therefore, the prevention of hyperlipidemia might also prevent steroid-induced osteonecrosis. We consider that PEMF could prevent osteonecrosis because several studies have shown that it can decrease serum lipid levels [12, 23] . Ishida et al. [13] also found that PEMF did not affect bone marrow fat cell size and hypothesized that its preventative effect on steroidinduced osteonecrosis occurs via a mechanism independent of lipid metabolism. Therefore, in the present study, we measured only serum markers of adipogenesis, including TG, TC, LDL and HDL, in order to explain the underlying mechanism of PEMF stimulation in preventing steroid-induced osteonecrosis. Assays of TG, TC and LDL/HDL in the MPSL group showed a significant increase compared with the PEMF and PS groups at all time points. In contrast, the serum lipid levels were similar between the PEMF group and the PS group. Thus, we speculated that PEMF stimulation may prevent osteonecrosis by decreasing serum lipid levels. The underlying mechanism of PEMF in the living organism remains unclear. Some theories have been proposed: that the electromagnetic fields have the potential to regulate flow through cation channels, changing the steadystate concentrations of cellular cations and thus the metabolic processes dependent on cation concentrations. We therefore hypothesize that the biological effects of PEMF on serum lipids were associated with ion-channel gating on the cell membrane [24, 25] .",
