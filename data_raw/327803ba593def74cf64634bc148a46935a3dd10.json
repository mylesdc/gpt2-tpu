Two influenza outbreaks were reported in two NHs, caused by influenza A(H3N2) strains belonging to cluster 3C.3 and 3C.2a. Although antivirals were available, prophylaxis was not used.",

Routine influenza vaccination of residents and health professionals contributes to preventing these homes from being affected by waves of seasonal influenza. However, in some seasons, such in 2014-2015 when influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) was low, especially because of a mismatch with the majority of A(H3N2) circulating viruses (Souty et al. 2015) , this measure is insufficient, and more or less extensive outbreaks can occur (Nicholls et al. 2004; Monto et al. 2004 ).",

The transmission of influenza from HCWs to patients is very common and has been described for other nosocomial influenza outbreaks (Oguma et al. 2011; Eibach et al. 2014) . Other factors in NHs could have supported the spread of influenza outbreaks including the older age of residents, the high prevalence of multiple chronic disease, family visits, communal living arrangements, shared caregiving, the continual close proximity of residents and ineffectual infection-control programs (Montoya et al. 2016) . Overall these factors could have facilitate both the introduction and subsequent transmission of influenza viruses among residents of the NH15 and NH40. When an influenza outbreak is suspected in an institutionalized setting, it is recommended to intensify measures to avoid transmission such as frequent hand washing, use of face masks, separation of sick persons from the rest of the residents, reducing visits and reducing staff movement between different areas of the NH (HCSP 2012). Antiviral drug treatment in cases and in persons exposed may also be useful (HCSP 2012) . Notably no influenza antiviral treatment had been administrated in NHs included in our study for treatment and/or prophylaxis of residents/staff. These results are an agreement with a previous study describing the absence of antiviral treatment for prophylaxis during NHs influenza outbreaks in Spain (Castilla et al. 2012 ) and with the low rate of neuraminidase inhibitors prescription to ILI patients with a severe influenza risk factor reported in French primary health care .",

If the impact of influenza vaccination campaign is demonstrated by the high VC of NH residents included in this study (92 vs. 48 .5 % in the general population for the community-dwelling elderly) (INPES 2015) influenza vaccine uptake among HCWs was insufficient (15 %; min = 0 and max = 47) (WHO 2003) . The low level of VC among HCWs was in agreement with previous studies, ranging from <10 to 50 % (Vaux et al. 2010 ). All NHS included in this study conducted surveillance of ILI routinely. In this study, only one ILI outbreak (detected in NH15) was declared to the health authorities. This suggests that NHs still encounter difficulties in reporting surveillance data and that the actual system based on report outbreaks to the local health authorities, need to be implemented.",

First, the actual number of ILI and the actual extent of the outbreaks may have been under-estimated because residents or HCWs who were mildly infected or asymptomatic were not included. Furthermore the ILI outbreak definition was not sensitive enough and other outbreaks could have been missed. Second, some requested that data should not be available for all NH participants, such as HCW influenza VC. Third, even if the detection of respiratory viruses using RT-PCR is a highly sensitive method, there is a potential bias for detection as the viral load in samples from elderly adults is generally lower than that in samples from younger adults (Lee et al. 2009 ). On the other hand the duration of shedding is higher in the elderly, so that may facilitate the identification of causative organisms (Talbot and Falsey 2010) . Fourth, visitors occasionally passing through the NHs were not monitored for ILI because of logistical barriers.",
