Rotavirus vaccines presently used are modified live vaccines that lack complete biological safety. Previous work from our laboratory suggested that vaccines based on in situ produced, non-infectious rotavirus-like particles (RVLPs) are efficient while being entirely safe. However, using either vaccine, active mucosal immunization cannot induce protective immunity in newborns due to their immature immune system. We therefore hypothesized that offspring from vaccinated dams are passively immunized either by transfer of maternal antibodies during pregnancy or by taking up antibodies from milk. Using a codon optimized polycistronic gene expression cassette packaged into herpesvirus particles, the simultaneous expression of the RV capsid genes led to the intracellular formation of RVLPs in various cell lines. Vaccinated dams developed a strong RV specific IgG antibody response determined in sera and milk of both mother and pups. Moreover, sera of na\u00efve pups nursed by vaccinated dams also had RV specific antibodies suggesting a lactogenic transfer of antibodies. Although full protection of pups was not achieved in this mouse model, our observations are important for the development of improved vaccines against RV in humans as well as in various animal species.",

By contrast, in other regions, such as in sub-Saharan Africa, protection was only 46.1% [4] . Globally approved vaccines include either live attenuated (Rotarix, RV1; GlaxoSmithKline Inc., Rixensart, Belgium) or reassortant RV strains (RotaTeq, RV5; Merck and Co., Inc., Whitehouse Station, NJ, USA). Hence, both vaccines are based on replicating viral strains and are thus not safe by nature. A case report from 2010 described the RV transmission from a RotaTeq vaccinated child to its unvaccinated sibling. This vaccine associated infection resulted in gastroenteritis that required emergency care. The transmitted RV strain was a reassorted vaccine-derived strain. Reassortment may have resulted in the recovery of virulence [5] . In addition, both RV vaccines were found to be associated with a slightly increased risk of intussusception after the primary vaccination [6] . Therefore, it is necessary to develop more efficient and in particular safer vaccines. Here, we present our findings on an alternative vaccine approach that ultimately aims to protect children from RV infection-associated symptoms in their early time of life.",

For the attachment to the host cell, the capsids also contain VP4 spikes that protrude through VP7 pores and attach to the VP6 layer. To produce VLPs of RV, many expression vectors exist and several vaccine candidates have been proven to be effective against RV induced diarrhea or virus shedding in small animal models. Triple-layered VLPs containing VP2, VP6 and VP7 [9, 10] or double-layered VLPs consisting of VP2 and VP6 are examples of this approach [11] . Moreover, subunit vaccines produced of VP6 in eukaryotic cells [12, 13] or VP2 and VP6 expressed as soluble proteins in Escherichia coli and assembled into VLPs [14] showed protection against RV induced disease. However, the assembly of RV structural proteins into rotavirus like particles (RVLPs) requires the simultaneous expression of several recombinant RV genes in a single cell followed by multiple purification steps of these RVLPs. These are challenging steps in the production of a stable, mass-produced vaccine.",

The HSV-1 amplicon vector system with its high transgenic capacity of up to 150 kb is safe as the transgenes are unable to replicate [15] , but allow delivery of synthetic DNA encoding any antigen of interest [16] . With this system, the time consuming and complex purification of VLPs is not required.

Based on these principles, we aimed to increase the amounts of VLP-generating and immunizing proteins synthesized in situ, we chose to alter the sequence of viral genes in the amplicon vector and optimized the amino acid sequence to the codon usage of human cells.",

Notably, the number of placental layers between mothers and their fetuses is different for various mammals, which affects or inhibits the ability to transfer antibodies during pregnancy. The mammals cluster into three groups, with humans belonging to group 1, where, due to their single layer placenta type, the major amount of immunoglobulin is transferred to the fetus prior to parturition [21] . In group 2, with mice and dogs as examples, the immunoglobulins are transferred both through the placental and the lactogenic pathway. The efficiency by which different isotypes of antibodies are transferred to the milk differs between the individual species. Although being aware of these differences, it was of interest to observe the general potency of our vaccine type in a mouse model. We thus studied the kinetics of anti-RV antibody production in the sera of mice as well as in their milk. Moreover, we tested for prepartum antibody transfer compared to the postpartum transfer by milk. Finally, we also tested the protective effect of passive antibody transfer in the context of a challenge infection.",

A similar RV specific IgG titer was found in terminal sera of pups from sWa[VP2/6/7] immunized dams as in sera from pups nursed from HBSS control injected dams ( Figure 3E , group A, B). The RV specific IgG of the sWa[VP2/6/7] immunized dams was thus passed to their offspring or the nursed control pups by the lactogenic route. We also exchanged the offspring from sWa[VP2/6/7] immunized dams with the offspring of HBSS injected control dams immediately after birth. Because of the terminal exsanguination, only the remaining maternal antibody titer of the pups after six days following the transfer to the control dam could be analyzed ( Figure 3E , group \"C\"). This antibody titer was still elevated compared to the controls ( Figure 3E , group \"D\"). All data to generate the plot in Figure 3E and the number of included animals for this experiment are shown in Table A8 in the Appendix A. Table A9 in the Appendix A shows p-values between all groups in Figure 3E . Before the immunization of female BALB/c mice a blood sample was collected from each animal. Five days after intra muscular (i.m.) injection of the prime dose, a male was added for mating. Before booster immunization, blood samples were taken. For the first set of experiments, mice received a booster immunization at 19 days after prime dose injection, and, for the second set of experiments, at 20 days after prime dose injection. Blood and milk samples were taken on a regular basis starting on the day of parturition. (B-D) Rotavirus specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) serum (B,D) or milk (C) levels of immunized mouse dams determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Rotavirus-specific IgG in sera (1:5000 dilution) or milk (1:500 dilution) of either sWa[VP2/6/7] or GFP amplicon vector immunized animals was measured and plotted relative to the positive control applied on each ELISA plate that was taken as 100%. As positive control always the same sera of a RV hyperimmunized mouse from a previous study [17] (E) Rotavirus-specific IgG levels in pup sera determined by ELISA. Rotavirus-specific IgG in terminal sera from the offspring of either sWa[VP2/6/7] or GFP amplicon vector immunized dams or Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) injected control dams was plotted in relation to the positive control (set as 100%). In group A, offspring was born and raised by sWa[VP2/6/7] immunized dams. In group B, offspring was born from HBSS injected dams but raised by sWa[VP2/6/7] immunized dams. Group C includes offspring born from sWa[VP2/6/7] immunized dams and raised by HBSS injected control dams. Group D includes offspring born and raised by HBSS-injected control animals. Group E includes offspring born and raised by GFP vector immunized dams. Here, dams obtained the booster dose 20 days after prime immunization. The standard deviation of each group is indicated. p-values of A versus C, D or E or B versus C, D or E are indicated: ***, p < 0.001.",

The first set of experiments showed promising results indicating that pups from vaccinated dams had lowest DD50 (DD50/mL) titers whereas pups swapped had 20-50 times higher DD50/mL values that reflected the antibody titer (Table A10) . Subsequent experiments indicated variables due to the age of the pups at the time of challenge and thus possible developmental stage of immune maturation, weight of the pups and limitation of sera collection due to the need to kill the experimental animals (Table A11 ).

Further immunogold labeling of these RVLPs using the rabbit polyclonal anti-RV serum and a secondary antibody conjugated to gold particles confirmed the VLP's identity as RV-like. sWa[VP2/6/7] transduced cells showed that the synthesized RV structural proteins assembled into RVLPs similar in size and structure to wild-type RV particles [28] . Further immunogold labeling of these RVLPs using the rabbit polyclonal anti-RV serum and a secondary antibody conjugated to gold particles confirmed the VLP's identity as RV-like. To analyze the composition of the isolated RVLPs, Western blot analysis of the purified RVLPs was performed ( Figure 5C ). This indicated that the observed RVLPs consisted predominantly of the two inner layers VP2 and VP6 ( Figure 5C, left panel) , whereas the outer layer protein VP7 remained in the cell debris pellet obtained during the purification of the RVLPs ( Figure 5C, right panel) . Moreover, VP7 is a transmembrane glycoprotein localized at the ER [29] and seemed to localize with the ER membranes ( Figure 1D ) even though VP2 and VP6 were co-expressed. In summary, even though VP7 was abundantly present in transduced cells ( Figure 1B,C) , it was hardly incorporated into the isolated RVLPs leading to the conclusion that in our system double-layered RVLPs were preferentially formed.",

Consequently, the results of adaptation usually include alterations in the amino acid sequences of the proteins of immunogenic interest. We solved this problem by using a synthetic and codon-optimized DNA cassette, which maintained the original (RV strain Wa, Dhaka isolate) amino acid sequences of the three major capsid proteins VP2, VP6, and VP7. The particular strengths of this approach are three-fold: (1) the vaccine can easily be adjusted to the circulating RV strain, since only the packaged DNA sequence needs to be modified; (2) HSV-1 amplicon vectors have a high transgene capacity (up to 150 kb) that ensures that multiple copies of the RV protein encoding genes are delivered and thereby trigger a high amount of protein synthesis; and (3) VLP purification, which is very expensive and time consuming, can be omitted because VLPs are being formed in situ.",

We and others [14, 17, 27, 31] reported that assembly of structural proteins into VLPs might be crucial for protection against RV infections. The viral structure is assembled by several proteins on the VLP surface mimicking the native virions and allowing crucial overlapping epitopes to be recognized by antibodies that would not be possible by the use of single individual subunits as antigens. Adopting these principles, we propose that the structural aspect of RVLPs is important for RV specific generation of protective antibodies. Based on electron microscopic analysis, the RVLPs produced in vitro were highly analogous to native RV particles. However, further analysis revealed that cell culture purified RVLPs were predominantly composed of VP2 and VP6 but excluded VP7 ( Figure 5C ). As known from literature [1, 32] , and shown by our data of the intracellular localization of the synthetized proteins ( Figure 1D ), VP7 associates with the membranes of the ER, whereas VP2 and VP6 form punctate structures within the cytoplasm but do not co-localize with the ER membranes. It is not fully understood how triple-layered particles (TLP) can form under these conditions. However, Coste et al. were able to purify TLPs following co-infection of insect cells with three different baculoviruses [27] (i.e., one for the expression of each of the three capsid proteins, VP2, VP6, and VP7).",

Instead, upon VLP purification, VP7 remained in the pellet, together with the cellular debris. Even more surprisingly, antibodies against VP7 were not induced under these circumstances. Consequently, it might be that the requirements for TLP formation are different for insect cells and mammalian cells. Indeed, according to others, co-expression of NSP4 and/or VP4 together with the three capsid proteins may play a pivotal role in the assembly of the third layer [1] . A better understanding of the RV assembly process is needed to solve the problem of VP7 incorporation into VLPs in the future.",

However, the immune system of newborns is not fully mature at this stage. Thus, immunization of mothers, resulting in the protective transfer of their antibody repertoire to the offspring, represents an important alternative that can also be mimicked in the mouse model. Indeed, protection against RV diarrhea by passive maternal transfer of antibodies has been reported (mouse maternal antibody model) using live-rotavirus vaccines [34] , recombinant adenovirus expressing VP7 [35] , recombinant VP6 and VP8 proteins expressed in E. coli [36] , VLPs assembled in insect cells [27] or capsid proteins VP2 and VP6 expressed in E. coli and assembled into VLPs post-purification [14] .",

            "text": "Having the same antigens (VP2, VP6, and VP7) included in our approach and having shown that all three proteins were being synthesized in transduced cells, we were confident to achieve similar results in a protection study as Coste et al. [27] , though with IgG and upon in situ synthesis of the viral proteins instead of immunizing with purified VLPs. Indeed, our vaccinated mice produced high anti RV IgG antibody titers, both in serum and in milk, and they transferred these antibodies to their offspring. However, we were unable to detect any RV specific IgA antibodies in the vaccinated mice. Consequently, a clear protection against diarrhea was not achieved. This was in agreement with previous studies [34, 36] , which reported that protection from rotavirus diarrhea relied on the lactogenic transfer of IgA against VP7 or VP4. Of course, several factors contribute to clinical protection against RV, including a close match of antibodies against the targeted antigens, the amount and isotype of antibodies as well as the location, where they should act. In the present case, the transfer of antibodies from the immunized mothers to their suckling mice seemed efficient. However, at least three factors might have influenced the protective outcome in a negative way: (1) The stringent stop criteria for the animal experiments did not allow the examination of the duration and severity of RV symptoms in offspring in the different experimental groups; (2) The antibody isotype generated upon vaccination was predominantly IgG, whereas IgA is supposed to provide a better level of protection, particularly in the gut. On the other hand, one may consider that the maternal antibodies had been recovered from the gut as a consequence of suckling milk containing these antibodies. Thus, the challenging virus and the potentially protective antibodies had opportunities to meet and to react in the gut, at least for a certain amount of time. It was, therefore, surprising to note that no obvious protective effect could be achieved. Of note, we used heterologous RVLPs based on the human RV strain Wa and mice were challenged with a heterotypic RV, the murine strain EDIM. Thus, it might be that even if VP7-specific antibodies were raised, no protection was observed because of the poor cross-reactivity between the raised antibodies; (3) According to Butler et al. [21] , the mammals cluster into three groups, with respect to lactogenic immunity. Rodents, classified in group 2, show particularly good absorption of IgG from the gut, which drains the gut from functional antibodies. Humans, classified in group 1, absorb only little immunoglobulins from the gut, leaving the antibodies to work where they are supposed to throughout a RV infection. Pigs, classified in group 3, show extensive absorption of all classes of immunoglobulins but only for the first 12 h. Afterwards, the milk antibodies are known to work for several weeks particularly well in the porcine gut. This property is even enhanced by the ability of the pigs to produce high amounts of IgA in response to vaccination.",

The codon adaption index [45] was calculated using The European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite (EMBOSS) [46] . Herpes simplex virus type-1 amplicon plasmids were cloned using Gateway technology (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The attB flanked synthetic gene expression cassettes (sWaRV) encoding the RV proteins VP2, VP6 and VP7, separated by internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) either with or without stop codon at the 5 end were generated by Biomatik. The Gateway B/P recombination between the attB flanked sWaRV cassette and the attP containing donor vector pDONR221 led to two entry plasmids containing the sWaRV gene expression cassette flanked by attL sites either with (pE_sWaRV_STOP) or without stop codon (pE_sWaRV). The amplicon plasmid used to produce sWa[VP2/6/7] vector stocks was generated by the Gateway L/R recombination between the attL sites containing entry vector pE_sWaRV_STOP and the attR sites containing destination vector pHSV-EYFP-RfC_C.1. For production of sWa[VP2/6/7_V5] amplicon vector stocks, pE_sWaRV was recombined with the destination vector pHSV-V5/His. The amplicon expression plasmids pHSV-EYFP-RfC_C.1 and pHSV-V5/His contain a transcription unit consisting of the HSV-1 immediate early (IE) 4/5 promoter and the SV40 polyadenylation signal as well the HSV-1 origin of replication (oriS) and the HSV-1 packaging/cleavage signal (pac) necessary for packaging into helper virus-free HSV-1 amplicon particles. The HSV-1 amplicon vectors encoding single structural RV proteins have been generated as follows: The single RV genes were amplified using the synthetic gene expression cassettes (sWaRV) as the template.

The ultrathin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Finally, the grids are loaded into the scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) holder of the SEM (Helios NanoLab 650, FEI Company, Eindhoven, The Netherlands). The images taken with the fluorescence microscope were opened on the SEM computer using the Maps software (FEI Company, Eindhoven, The Netherlands), a specially designed software to correlate light and electron microscopy which can read any type of images obtained by any type of light microscope. An electron micrograph was recorded using the Everhart-Thorney secondary electron detector and the alignment between the light and the electron micrograph was done using the Maps software using two auspicious points. A grid of image tiles, tileset, was drawn over the area of interest, indicated by the fluorescence image. The tile size was determined by the imaging conditions and had an overlap of 10%. Imaging conditions were: 30 keV, 1.6 nA, 5 mm working distance, 6144 \u00d7 4096 pixels per frame, 5 \u00b5m horizontal field of view (about 8 \u00c5 pixel size), 1 \u00b5s dwell time using the STEM III detector (FEI Company) in the high-angle annular-dark field mode. We used the three-point focus regime: at three points close to the area of interest the section was focused at higher magnification, then brightness and contrast were adjusted at the magnification and imaging conditions used for recording the images. Finally, the tiles were stitched by the software and exported as tiff files. To circumvent any disturbing effects (e.g., bleaching), occurring in the overlapping zones after stitching, the whole area of interest was pre-irradiated with a high current (26 nA), large frame size (6144 \u00d7 4096 pixels) and short dwell time (50 ns) for about 30 min.",

The serum samples were 1:5 diluted in 1\u00d7 PBS and heated for 3 min at 97 \u2022 C, cooled immediately on wet ice for 5 min and used directly for the RT-qPCR reaction. The Path-ID Multiplex One-Step RT-PCR Kit (Applied Biosystems, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used for the amplification. As primer probe, we used the VetMax Swine Enteric Panel Reagent (Applied Biosystems, Thermo Fisher Scientific), a primer probe mix for detection of porcine rotavirus A-besides a primer probe for porcine rotavirus A, this kit contains also primer probes for transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV)-. This primer probe mix was selected because it was the most sensitive kit. The reaction was run in a thermal cycler (CFX96 C1000 Touch, BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA) using the following settings: reverse transcription for 10 min at 48 \u2022 C followed by an inactivation/initial denaturation step of 10 min at 95 \u2022 C. Amplification was performed as 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 \u2022 C and 45 s at 60 \u2022 C. Reactions were done in duplicates. For calculation of virus dose, a standard curve was drawn using serial dilution of EDIM virus diluted in negative mouse serum and treated as described above in triplicates. Based on the resulting formula of the determined standard curve (ln(DD50) = \u22120.6419 \u00d7 Cq + 16.565), DD 50 was calculated for each sample.

For this, the RV proteins were used in a structural vaccinology approach. The transduction with the RV protein encoding HSV-1 amplicon vector sWa[VP2/6/7] triggered the synthesis of all three encoded RV proteins, VP2, VP6 and VP7, as well as the intracellular assembly of RVLPs in cell culture. The distribution of the viral proteins within the cell resembled the localization of proteins in wild type RV infections. When administered intramuscularly, the RV proteins encoding HSV-1 amplicon vectors induced a strong RV specific antibody response in sera as well as in milk of vaccinated dams. In addition, the antibody response was passed through both the placental and/or lactogenic route to unvaccinated offspring swapped to vaccinated dams. As expected, lactogenic transfer of RV specific IgG did not protect the suckling mice from developing RV symptoms upon challenge. Indications of control of systemic spread were noted but will require more targeted experiments. Although full protection against an oral RV challenge was not achieved and would require both oral and systemic vaccination, the helpervirus-free herpesvirus amplicon vectors used in this study may be rapidly adapted to confer immunity against a whole array of different RVs.",
