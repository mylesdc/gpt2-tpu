Demographic characteristics of cases and controls were compared using the \u03c7 2 test. All controls, both RTI and non-RTI, were included in the main analysis. All analyses of viral load were restricted to children positive for each virus. Among children positive for each virus, t tests adjusted for site and age were performed to compare mean cycle threshold (Ct) values between cases and controls. For each virus, a trend analysis, using simple linear regression, was performed to test if viral density increased with age for cases and for controls. Among cases only, mean Ct values were also compared by days since onset, severity, vital status, and HIV status. Multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for age and site, was performed to compare odds of being a case for each 3.4-unit drop in Ct value, which was approximately equivalent to a 1 log 10 increase in viral copies/mL; Ct values instead of viral density were used for regression because viral density was only accurate within the linear range of the assay (10 4 -10 8 copies/mL). Kernel density distribution plots were created to show distributions of viral density by case/control status. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the corresponding area under the curve (AUC) were generated to investigate the performance of viral load in determining case status among children positive by NP/OP PCR for each virus, and the Youden index was calculated to determine the optimized diagnostic cutoffs to differentiate cases and controls [18] . To guard against bias in the estimates of sensitivity due to having a small number of some viruses detected among cases, the Youden index was calculated using leave-one-out cross-validation where sample size was sufficient [19] . Redefining positivity using the optimal cutpoints, we calculated odds ratios associated with case status for children above vs below the optimal cutpoint including negatives. The proportion of radiographically confirmed cases attributable to each virus [population attributable fraction: population prevalence \u00d7 (1 -1 / OR)] was calculated using 2 methods: (1) any positive vs negative and (2) positive above vs below the optimal cutpoint, the former method being optimal for laboratory sensitivity and the latter for a balance of epidemiological sensitivity and specificity. All analyses were performed using SAS software version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary North Carolina) and R Statistical Software 3.2.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).

Taking sequential samples in which we could compare the peak viral load between cases of different clinical severity would have been optimal. Second, our design precluded us from assessing the role of viral load in the lung. Upper respiratory tract viral load might reflect the amount of replication in the local epithelial cells rather than the viral burden in the lung parenchyma. Evaluation of viral load of specimens from the lung, either through lung aspirates or bronchoalveolar lavage, would provide more direct evidence of the role of viral load in pneumonia severity.",

In the PERCH study, the viral loads in the NP/OP of pneumonia patients are unlikely to further clarify the role of that virus in causing pneumonia.

CXR+ defined as having radiographic evidence of pneumonia.
