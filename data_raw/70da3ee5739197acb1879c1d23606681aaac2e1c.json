            "text": "Avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J) infection can cause tumors and immunosuppression in infected chickens. Macrophages play a central role in host defense against invading pathogens. In this study, we discovered an interesting phenomenon: ALV-J replication is weakened from 3 hours post-infection (hpi) to 36 hpi, which was verified using Western blotting and RT-PCR. To further investigate the interaction between ALV-J and macrophages, transcriptome analysis was performed to analyze the host genes' function in chicken primary monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM). Compared to the uninfected control, 624 up-regulated differentially expressed genes (DEG) and 341 downregulated DEG at 3 hpi, and 174 up-regulated DEG and 87 down-regulated DEG at 36 hpi were identified in chicken MDM, respectively. ALV-J infection induced strong innate immune responses in chicken MDM at 3 hpi, instead of 36 hpi, according to the analysis results of Gene Ontology and KEGG pathway. Importantly, the host factors, such as up-regulated MIP-3\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, iNOS, K60, IRG1, CH25H, NFKBIZ, lysozyme and OASL were involved in the host defense response during the course of ALV-J infection. On the contrary, up-regulated EX-FABP, IL4I1, COX-2, NFKBIA, TNFAIP3 and the Jak STAT pathway inhibitors including CISH, SOCS1 and SOCS3 are beneficial to ALV-J survival in chicken macrophages. We speculated that ALV-J tropism for macrophages helps to establish a latent infection in chicken MDM from 6 to 36 hpi. The present study provides a comprehensive view of the interactions between macrophages and ALV-J. It suggests the mechanisms of defense of chicken macrophages against ALV-J invasion and how ALV-J escape the host innate immune responses.",

It is well known that ALV-J causes enormous economic loss in the global poultry industries. To date, there are no vaccines or treatments to protect against ALV-J infection. Since little is known about the interaction between ALV-J and the host, current strategies are focused on ALV-J eradication. RNA viruses are prone to mutations. In contrast to the virus, the host does not change quickly. It is therefore an enticing strategy to try to overpower ALV-J by finding ways to make chickens less permissive to viral replication.",

In our previous studies, we found that chicken MDM are susceptible to ALV-J infection [10] . In the present study, we observed that ALV-J replication in MDM was active at 3 hpi, but inhibited from 6 to 36 hpi. It is reported that recombinant chicken IFN-\u03b1 as well as the ISG, CCCH type zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP), could inhibit ALV-J replication in DF1 cells [24, 25] . So, we speculated that ISG may also resist ALV-J replication in chicken MDM.",

For example, CH25H broadly inhibited growth of enveloped viruses including VSV, HSV, HIV and the acutely pathogenic viruses EBOV, RVFV and RSSEV by converting cholesterol to 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC) [27] .

MIP-3\u03b1, macrophage inflammatory protein-3 alpha, is responsible for the chemo-attraction of dendritic cells, and effector and memory B and T cells [28] . Moreover, MIP-3\u03b1 exhibited anti-microbial and anti-HIV activities [28] [29] [30] . IL-1\u03b2 is produced primarily by activated macrophages and possess multiple and diverse properties in their response to infection [31, 32] . Thus, host damage following infection induces macrophage secretion of a variety of inflammatory mediators including IL-1 and NO that activate anti-pathogenic microorganism defense mechanisms [2] . NO production is primarily catalyzed by iNOS and is a part of innate host defenses [33] . ALV-J infection in MDM at 3 hpi increased expression of the two orthologues of chicken IL-8, K60 (IL8L1) and IL8 (IL8L2) [34, 35] . IL-8 is a potent chemo-attractant and activator of macrophages [36] . Furthermore, IL-8 has been shown to attract and activate T lymphocytes [37, 38] , which would aid in raising an immunologically specific response against ALV-J. Immune response gene 1 (IRG1) was originally identified as a highly inducible gene in murine macrophages following LPS stimulation [39] . The role of IRG1 in the course of virus infection has not been extensively reported. IRG1 was identified as an ISG with antiviral effects against different neurotropic viruses [40] . OASL has been found to broadly inhibit the replication of viruses such as swine fever virus, RSV and HCV through a variety of mechanisms [41] [42] [43] . Lysozyme is a differentiation marker for macrophage, and is activated during macrophage differentiation [44] . We found that lysozyme expression increased incrementally from 3 hpi to 36 hpi in ALV-J-infected MDM. This result reminded us that ALV-J infection could stimulate chicken macrophage maturation. Lysozyme is a cornerstone of innate immunity due to its direct antimicrobial activity through peptidoglycan hydrolysis and immune regulatory functions [45] . Interestingly, lysozyme also possesses antiviral properties [46, 47] . NFKBIZ encodes the protein I\u03baBz and is known as a partner of NF\u03baB that regulates innate host defense factors [48] .",

Up to now, the specific innate sensors responding to ALV were unknown [1] . We speculated that ALV-J should theoretically be recognized by PRR such as TLR, RLR, IFI16, and cGAS, similar to HIV [1] . However, no functional PRR such as TLR3, TLR4, TLR7 or MDA5 were induced in ALV-J-infected MDM at 3 hpi. Only TLR15 was up-regulated by ALV-J at 3 hpi (Table 1) . Therefore, we speculate that chicken macrophages lack functional PRR for ALV-J to escape host immune attack at the early stage of infection. Indeed, it has been reported that other retroviruses use this strategy to achieve immune escape in macrophages [49] . Interestingly, the expression of TLR1, TLR7 and TLR15 was significantly increased in ALV-J-infected MDM at 36 hpi (Table 1) . As a result, ALV-J replication was inhibited and weak innate immune responses were induced at 36 hpi. At this infection stage, ALV-J may be recognized by TLR1, TLR7 and TLR15.",

            "text": "The Jak-STAT pathway is a major signaling pathway in the function of immune cells and is activated by cytokines and growth factors [50] . In this study, many negative feedback regulators of cytokine signaling mediated by this pathway were identified. CISH, SOCS1 and SOCS3 were significantly induced in ALV-J-infected MDM at 3 hpi and enriched on the Jak-STAT signaling (Table 1) . CISH and suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) family proteins are Jak-STAT inhibitors, including 8 members, CISH, SOCS1, SOCS2, SOCS3, SOCS4, SOCS5, SOCS6 and SOCS7 [51] . CISH, SOCS1, SOCS2 and SOCS3 are the best characterized SOCS family members [52] . CISH is induced by cytokines that activate STAT5 and block the STAT binding to cytokine receptors. SOCS1 binds to the Jaks and inhibits catalytic activity, while SOCS3 binds to Jak-proximal sites on cytokine receptors and inhibits Jak activity [52] . It has been reported that SOCS3 enhances HIV-1 replication in macrophages by inhibiting antiviral IFN-\u03b2 signaling [53] . The SOCS3 expression was also significantly increased in ALV-J-infected MDM (Table 1 ). Further verification found that overexpression of CISH and SOCS3 promoted ALV-J replication in MDM at 3 hpi (Figure 8 ). We speculated that ALV-J infection inhibited the Jak-STAT pathway via inducing expression of CISH, SOCS1 and SOCS3. Indeed, the key factors such as Jak and STAT in Jak-STAT pathway were not remarkably induced by ALV-J infection in MDM. The role of SOCS5 has not been well identified during viral infection. However, a novel role for SOCS5 has been found to restrain the early phase of influenza A infection by inhibiting EGFR activity [54] . Coincidently, SOCS5 expression was inhibited by ALV-J in MDM at 3 hpi (Table 1 ).",

The protein TNFAIP3 is known as a powerful suppressor of cytokine signaling and innate antiviral pathways, and it can inhibit the activity of NF-\u03baB and NF-\u03baB-mediated inflammatory responses [56, 57] . TNFAIP3 deficiency in myeloid cells and lung epithelial cells could protect against influenza A virus infection [58, 59] . We speculated that NFKBIA and TNFAIP3 were significantly induced by ALV-J infection in MDM to down-regulate cytokines in macrophages, resulting in viral persistence in the host. Altogether, NFKBIA, TNFAIP3, CISH, SOCS1 and SOCS3 were considered as a counterbalance to the antiviral immune responses induced by ALV-J infection in chicken MDM at 3 hpi.",

We also found that overexpression of IL4I1 and EX-FABP could enhance ALV-J replication in chicken MDM at 3 hpi (Figure 8 ). IL4I1 is an immunosuppressive enzyme and primarily expressed in professional antigen-presenting cells and it inhibits T-cell proliferation and activation [60, 61] . COX-2 is one of the important mediators of inflammation in response to viral infection, which contributes to viral replication and this has been shown for HCV [62] , HBV [63] , dengue virus [64] and cytomegalovirus [65] . The EX-FABP gene encodes an extracellular fatty acid binding protein and it is significantly induced by Salmonella enteritidis infections in chickens [66] . This protein may provide fatty acids for mitochondrial respiration during infection. EX-FABP expression is enhanced after treatments with inflammatory stimuli and is repressed by anti-inflammatory agents, behaving as an acute phase and constitutively expressed survival protein [67] . EX-FABP was robustly induced in ALV-J-infected MDM at 36 hpi and therefore may provide protection for MDM after the chemokine and cytokine production induced by ALV-J at 3 hpi. There is a rule that the virus is lost when the cells die. Consequently, induction of EX-FABP at 36 hpi may be a strategy of ALV-J to live in harmony with chicken macrophages at the late stages of infection. Consequently, EX-FABP, IL4I1 and COX-2 together with NFKBIA, TNFAIP3, CISH, SOCS1 and SOCS3 enable ALV-J survival in chicken macrophages. ",

Superficially, we could conclude that ALV-J replication was inhibited at 6-36 hpi due to robust host immune responses induced at 3 hpi. However, in HIV-related studies, the conventional host immune response does not contain HIV-1 replication and even contributes by increasing virus replication through immune activation [68] . Moreover, viruses can proactively hide in the host to evade the host immune elimination and HIV typically establishes latency within the macrophage [69] . Based on our findings, it is also possible that ALV-J is capable of escaping from host immune responses and establishing latency in chicken MDM after 3 h of viral infection. According to the above analyses, we should take a balanced view to consider the interactions between ALV-J and host immune response. Additional studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms of ALV-J immune evasion and host defense responses in chicken macrophages.In summary, gene expression profiling analysis in chicken MDM infected with ALV-J provides insights into the mechanisms underlying the host immune responses and ALV-J immune escape. Strong immune responses were induced by ALV-J infection in MDM at 3 hpi. We found that numerous differentially expressed genes such as MIP-3\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, iNOS, K60, IRG1, CH25H, NFKBIZ, lysozyme and OASL were involved in host defense of ALV-J infection. ALV-J countered host immune attacks by inhibiting the expression of functional PRR and facilitating expression of Jak-STAT pathway inhibitors. These results provide valuable insights into the antagonism between host antiviral immune responses and ALV-J infection.",
