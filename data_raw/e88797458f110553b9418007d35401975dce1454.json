            "text": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most frequent cause of lower respiratory disease in infants, but no vaccine or effective therapy is available. The initiation of RSV infection of immortalized cells is largely dependent on cell surface heparan sulfate (HS), a receptor for the RSV attachment (G) glycoprotein in immortalized cells. However, RSV infects the ciliated cells in primary well differentiated human airway epithelial (HAE) cultures via the apical surface, but HS is not detectable on this surface. Here we show that soluble HS inhibits infection of immortalized cells, but not HAE cultures, confirming that HS is not the receptor on HAE cultures. Conversely, a \"non-neutralizing\" monoclonal antibody against the G protein that does not block RSV infection of immortalized cells, does inhibit infection of HAE cultures. This antibody was previously shown to block the interaction between the G protein and the chemokine receptor CX3CR1 and we have mapped the binding site for this antibody to the CX3C motif and its surrounding region in the G protein. We show that CX3CR1 is present on the apical surface of ciliated cells in HAE cultures and especially on the cilia. RSV infection of HAE cultures is reduced by an antibody against CX3CR1 and by mutations in the G protein CX3C motif. Additionally, mice lacking CX3CR1 are less susceptible to RSV infection. These findings demonstrate that RSV uses CX3CR1 as a cellular receptor on HAE cultures and highlight the importance of using a physiologically relevant model to study virus entry and antibody neutralization.",

Despite this great clinical impact, no effective antivirals or vaccines against RSV are available. Here we find that the RSV attachment (G) glycoprotein uses CX3CR1 as a receptor on primary human airway epithelial (HAE) cultures, an excellent model of RSV infection of the human lung. The G protein contains a CX3C motif and we find that this region is critical for its role in infection of HAE cultures, but not of immortalized cells. Furthermore, we find that antibodies against the G protein neutralize RSV infection of HAE cultures differently from immortalized cells. These insights suggest that HAE cultures should be used to quantify neutralizing antibodies, including during vaccine development, that the CX3CR1 interaction with the RSV G protein could be a target for antiviral drug development, and that the G protein should be considered for inclusion in vaccines.",

All viruses were propagated and titered in HeLa cells (American Type Culture Collection). HeLa cells and 293A cells (American Type Culture Collection) were grown in DMEM containing 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS). Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) mutant A745 cells (gift from Dr. J.D. Esko, University of California, San Diego, San Diego, CA) which are severely deficient in the production of all glycosaminoglycans [33] were grown in RPMI 10% FBS.",

To test this possibility, recombinant green fluorescent protein expressing RSV (rgRSV) was incubated with soluble HS prior to inoculation of HeLa and HAE cultures. Soluble HS (20 \u03bcg/ ml) neutralized infection of HeLa cells without reducing infection of HAE cultures ( Fig 1A) . This result is consistent with HS acting as a virus receptor on HeLa cells, but not on HAE cultures. At a 5-fold higher concentration of soluble HS (100 \u03bcg/ml) RSV infection of HeLa cultures was reduced by over 100-fold, but infection of HAE cultures was reduced by only 2-fold. The partial sensitivity of RSV to this higher concentration may be the result of HS binding to lower affinity sites on the virions.",

MAb 131-2g binds the G protein and has been characterized as \"non-neutralizing\" because it does not reduce RSV infection of HEp-2 cells [36] and we confirmed this result for HeLa cells ( Fig  1B) . However, mAb 131-2g did neutralize rgRSV infection of HAE cultures. The ability of mAb 131-2g to reduce infection of HAE, but not HeLa cultures suggests that mAb 131-2g binds near and interferes with the function of a domain in the G protein that is important for attachment to HAE cultures but not for attachment to HeLa cells. This result demonstrates that these two domains on the G protein are distinct and confirms our hypothesis that RSV uses a different receptor to infect HAE cells compared to HeLa cells. Furthermore, these results indicate the importance of using physiologically relevant HAE cultures for determining the neutralizing abilities of antibodies against the G protein.",

However, we found that mAb L9 also inhibited rgRSV infection of HAE cells, but the inhibition of HAE infection was approximately 10-fold greater than the inhibition of HeLa infection (Fig 1C) . The ability of mAb L9 to neutralize rgRSV on HeLa and HAE cultures may be because the mAb blocks G protein binding to both HS and the unidentified HAE receptor, respectively. We have previously found that recombinant RSV lacking the G gene is much less infectious for HAE cultures than for HeLa cells [24] , indicating that the G protein is more important for infection of HAE cultures. The greater neutralizing ability of mAb L9 on HAE cultures is likely due to the fact that the G protein is more critical for efficient infection of these cells. Therefore, the ability of mAb L9 to neutralize rgRSV infection of both HeLa and HAE cells suggests that the attachment sites on the G protein for each cell type are close to each other.",

To confirm that mAb 131-2g neutralization of rgRSV (subgroup A) in HAE cultures is not an artifact of using a laboratory adapted virus, we examined the neutralizing ability of this mAb for a low-passage subgroup A clinical isolate, RSV A2001/2-20 (2-20) [41] . MAb 131-2g efficiently neutralized 2-20 infection of HAE cultures, but not of HeLa cells (Fig 1D) , similar to rgRSV. We also examined the neutralizing ability of mAb 131-2g for B1, an member of the RSV subgroup B. B1 infection of HAE cultures was also reduced, while infection of HeLa cells was not, similar to rgRSV (Fig 1E) . These results demonstrate that regardless of the source or subgroup of RSV, mAb 131-2g neutralizes infection of HAE cultures, but not HeLa cells. The G protein epitope recognized by mAb 131-2g includes C186, part of the CX3C motif The RSV G protein is an N-terminally anchored type II transmembrane protein [42] (Fig 2A) . It has a highly conserved central domain that is flanked by two highly O-glycosylated, mucinlike regions that also contain several N-linked glycans [42, 43] . Partially overlapping this central conserved region are 4 conserved cysteines linked by two disulfide bonds to form the neck of a 'noose' [44] . The last 2 cysteines are part of a CX3C motif [23] . Immediately C-terminal to this motif is the highly basic heparin-binding domain that binds to HS [45] .",

These antibodies stained the apical surface of HAE cultures, primarily and robustly staining the cilia on ciliated cells (Fig 3A) .

Expression of CX3CR1 resulted in a 4-fold increase in infection as compared to the same cells transfected with empty vector (Fig 4C) . A mAb against CX3CR1 significantly reduced RSV infection compared to an isotype control (Fig 4D) , indicating that the increase in infection was due to RSV interaction with the receptor. Further, mAbs 131-2g and L9 significantly reduced RSV infection of CX3CR1 expressing cells, supporting the hypothesis that these mAbs neutralize RSV infection by blocking the interaction of the G protein with CX3CR1.

MAb 131-2g also reduces leukocyte migration in vitro [23] and inflammation in the lungs of RSV infected mice [58] , suggesting that the G protein modulates the host inflammatory response via its interaction with CX3CR1. In RSV infected mice, treatment with mAb 131-2g mediates viral clearance and reduces RSV pathogenesis [59] . Because mAb 131-2g is non-neutralizing in immortalized cells, it was thought that this reduction in virus load could not be due to virus neutralization, but might instead be due to antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity. Furthermore, it was suggested that the reduction in pathogenesis was due to prevention of G protein-mediated leukocyte chemotaxis. Here we demonstrate that mAb 131-2g is strongly neutralizing on HAE cultures and that CX3CR1 is likely an important receptor on these cells. As our CX3CR1-/mouse infection data suggest that RSV uses CX3CR1 as a receptor on the murine airway epithelium, RSV neutralization by mAb 131-2g could have directly caused the decrease in viral load, resulting in decreased pathogenesis. A previous report did not find a difference in RSV yield from CX3CR1-/-and WT mice [60] . However, infectious virus in the lung was not quantified in that study which relied instead on real-time PCR. Indeed, several studies have utilized the mouse model and mAb 131-2g to examine the effects of the RSV G protein-CX3CR1 interaction on the immune response to RSV, but its use of CX3CR1 as a receptor on epithelial cells in the murine lung has not yet been directly examined.",

Others have presented evidence that ICAM-1, TLR4, and nucleolin can function as F protein receptors [25] [26] [27] .

We found that both F170 and C186 of the G protein are required for binding by mAbs L9 and 131-2g on an immunoblot, indicating that the epitopes of these mAbs overlap. Furthermore, since both mAbs bound the G protein that had been treated with a reducing agent, mAb binding was not dependent on the structure provided by the disulfide bonds, but rather on the primary sequence. Sullender previously found that mAb 131-2g does not bind to cells expressing a fragment of the G protein that includes amino acids 1 to 173 in an immunoblot [46] , but does bind this fragment in a cell immunofluorescence assay. It is possible that the site on the G protein that is recognized by mAb 131-2g has two components, one that includes amino acids F170 and C186 and another that is conformational. Further characterization is required and may provide further insights into this HAE-only neutralizing epitope on the G protein.",

The findings presented here demonstrate that some antibodies to the G protein, one of only two neutralizing antigens in RSV, can neutralize RSV infection only when assessed on physiologically relevant HAE cultures. For this reason, some of the in vivo neutralizing antibodies to the G protein may be missed when assessing neutralizing activity on immortalized cells. Conversely, it is possible that other antibodies that neutralize RSV on immortalized cells may not have neutralizing activity in vivo. Moreover, it is possible that the use of HAE cultures may be important for more accurately quantifying neutralizing antibodies against other respiratory viruses, particularly those that use HS as a surrogate receptor for infection in immortalized cells.",

Also, mice immunized with a shorter peptide (amino acids 148 to 198) generate antibodies that neutralize both A and B strains of RSV [65] .
