In response, a decision was made by the neonatal neurodevelopmental follow up (NNFU) clinic staff to select patients with scheduled appointments to have a mail/telephone assessment using Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ) or to postpone/skip their visit. The objective of this study was to compare the developmental assessment and its outcome in two groups of NNFU clinic patients, SARS versus non-SARS, over three standard clinic appointments.",

Criteria used to identify infants at risk selected for either mailed ASQ or phone interviews were not clearly defined in the patients' charts. There was a significant under identification of developmental delay during SARS (18% versus 45%). Of those who responded to the mailed questionnaire, referrals for therapy rates were similar to non-SARS group. The lost to follow up rate was 24% for the SARS group compared with 7% for non-SARS.

Neonatal neuro-developmental follow up (NNFU) clinics were designed for effective monitoring and assessment of these infants at regular time intervals.

Other reports have focused on inpatient care, where non urgent hospital utilization and hospital transfers were restricted, but this is the first such report of the impact on a hospital based clinic from the SARS time period [17, 18] . There were 95 patients with cancelled appointments during the SARS period and the NNFU team made contact with only 27 of these families despite clinic staff being required to attend work. There were no established criteria defining who should be contacted or how they should be evaluated during the crisis but rather clinicians made an intuitive decision as to who may require assistance. The response to the mailed questionnaire was poor (17/27). The eight families who received a follow up telephone call all returned the call but again there was no indication that any specific criteria were used in planning who should receive a telephone follow up in addition to the mailed questionnaire. This illustrates a haphazard approach during the time of clinic closure.",

Some literature has suggested that parents may be unable to complete questionnaires satisfactorily due to reading, organizational, mental health and cognitive disabilities [19] . A limitation of this study is that we did not obtain socio-economic data of the parents as a determinant of the rate of ASQ reply and the accuracy of reporting developmental delay in their infants. It has been previously shown [24] however that the accuracy of parent reporting is not influenced by socio-demographic factors or maternal educational level. A further limitation is the potential difference in populations between the SARS and non-SARS groups as they were recruited in different time periods which may have affected the accuracy of our result. Future studies may compare alternative assessment types at the same time period.",

If there is no a priori planning there is a risk of inconsistent patient management as was illustrated here. This applies not only to NNFU clinics but to all clinics providing care for patients with chronic health conditions. Well planned mail and telephone contact may be of assistance in providing patient care during the time of infectious disease containment measures particularly if staff is deployed to work in other areas. Such contact may also help with maintaining the engagement of families and return to clinic. Consideration should be given for remuneration of physician and other health care providers for this telephone assessment. If staffing was adequate a telehealth or internet based [25] assessment may be more appropriate to diagnose certain types of conditions. After the crisis has passed, workload adjustments may be required to enable rapid rescheduling of face to face assessments. These reflections are timely in view of the current focus of hospitals and public health authorities' planning for anticipated influenza pandemics. In conclusion, nonurgent care clinics should have a priori planning for identification, contacting and assessment of their high risk patients during the periods of clinic closure due to infectious diseases outbreaks.",
