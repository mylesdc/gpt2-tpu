Since August 2009, the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI), in partnership with the U.S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), has carried out surveillance for ALRI (defined as cough or difficulty breathing with an onset within the last 14 days from hospital admission date) among patients aged \u2265 18 years, at Siaya County Referral Hospital, in Western Kenya. The study population is culturally homogeneous and the area is known for high malaria, tuberculosis and HIV prevalence [7] [8] [9] . A structured questionnaire was programmed using Microsoft Visual Studio.net (Microsoft, Redmond, USA) and installed into netbooks (Mercer classmate) for collection of demographic and clinical examination data from patients by surveillance officers i.e. trained clinical officers and nurses. The data were stored in password protected Microsoft SQL databases (Microsoft, Redmond, USA).

NP and OP specimens were collected from consenting patients meeting the ALRI case definition using flexible mini-tip flocked swabs, combined into a single vial containing viral transport media, and transported to the laboratory for testing as previously described 7 . Sputum specimens were collected through expectoration (quality sputum defined as <10 squamous epithelial cells per low-power field) in clean 3 ml tubes and transported at 2-8 \u00b0C to KEMRI/CDC laboratories in Kisumu where they were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until testing. Nucleic acids were extracted from the sputum specimens, using a modified MagMax TM (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) viral RNA extraction procedure to include dithriothreital (DTT) treatment stage to break down sputum. Briefly, 100 \u03bcl of 500 mM DTT solution was added to 100 \u03bcl of sputum, vortexed and incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. The MagMax TM viral RNA extraction procedure was performed on 200 \u03bcl material following the manufacturer's instructions. The extracted total nucleic acids from NP/OP and sputum were tested using TAC as described by Kodani et al. and Weinberg et al. 4, 10 . Each target of the 30 pathogens was considered positive if it passed the internal positive control and had exponential fluorescence curves crossing the assigned threshold at a threshold cycle (C T ) value of <35. For targets with two wells, the target was considered positive when either of the two wells was positive. Results with C T > 30 for Legionella spp. were disregarded due to probe degradation of the specific chemistry used in preparation of this TAC. Data analysis. We described demographic characteristics and laboratory outcomes of patients using proportions, means, and medians. The paired specimen results were compared between NP/OP and sputum specimens using the McNemar's test and further stratified by HIV status, malaria infection, clinical severity (\u2264 vs. >7 days hospitalized) and duration of illness (< vs. \u22655 days from onset to admission) which are provided as supplementary tables. Percent agreement between NP/OP and sputum specimens were calculated as the total number of times the NP/OP and sputum specimens agreed for each TAC target divided by the total number of patients tested. Tests with p-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. The C T values for each target were summarized using box-and-whiskers plots. Analysis was performed using SAS (version 9.2, Cary, NC). ",

The authors looked at adults who www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ were hospitalized with severe acute respiratory illness, although the difference in yield from the two types of specimens was not impressive (15% increase in viral detection using sputum). Moreover, they only collected NP swabs which could have led to less representation of respiratory viruses with tropism to the oropharynx 14 . Wolff et al. also observed the detection of more viruses in sputum, where C T values were earlier for almost all pathogens compared to that found in NP/OP swabs 6 , leading the authors to argue for the benefit of sputum use in diagnosis of lower respiratory tract infections. However this position was not supported in the recent work done by Thea et al. 2 , where they looked at children <5 years hospitalized with ALRI and pneumonia, or by our study done among adults. Perhaps in tropical countries, the likelihood of multi-pathogen detection may be higher than that seen in temperate countries, for children and adults alike, which may merit further investigation.",

Furthermore, Thea et al. noted that the yield of pathogens from high quality induced sputum was similar to that of low quality induced sputum suggesting that specimen collected from the upper respiratory tract (i.e., NP/OP) could be used when investigating ALRI. The biggest challenge in these studies, including ours, is the interpretation of multi-pathogen detection, particularly when trying to attribute a specific pathogen as the cause of an episode of ALRI. Many bacterial pathogens detected from respiratory specimens could reflect carriage, being part of the normal microbiome, and not necessarily associated with the disease process. Similarly, viral pathogens detected in respiratory samples could indicate recent past infections. The early C T values from the upper tract could indicate higher pathogen load and be associated with pneumonia 15 , which would suggest that NP/OP swabs could be used when investigating lower ALRI etiology if interpretation is combined with C T values. However, establishing causality can be challenging even when considering organism density (here we used C T values as proxy). The use of radiographic images, epidemiologic data, clinical course of illness, and the possibility to investigate lower respiratory tract specimens collected aseptically could be important tools to add to the investigation of ALRI/pneumonia.",
