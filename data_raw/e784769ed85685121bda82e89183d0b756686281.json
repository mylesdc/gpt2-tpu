This paper shows a loss in efficiency of the movement restriction policy (MRP) when behavioral responses of farmers are taken into account. Incorporating the strategic behavior of farmers in an epidemiologic model reveals that the MRP can trigger premature animal sales by farms at high risk of becoming infected that significantly reduce the efficacy of the policy. The results are validated in a parameterized network via Monte Carlo simulations and measures to mitigate the loss of efficiency of the MRP are discussed. Financial aid to farmers can be justified by public health concerns, not only for equity. This paper contributes to developing an interdisciplinary analytical framework regarding the expansion of infectious diseases combining economic and epidemiologic dimensions.",

Among English and Welsh cattle farmers, it has been shown that behavioral changes have an impact on the implementation of disease-control programs [18] .

This is due to a mismatch between the time that the MRP is announced in a country (when an infectious disease is detected) and the time that immobilization is implemented in a specific region of that country. This result holds even under the assumption of perfect compliance by farmers (no misbehavior). It can be explained by reasoning similar to that of the so-called \"green paradox\", which states that some environmental policies oriented to slow global warming act as an announced expropriation of fossil fuels, inducing the owners of these resources to accelerate extraction, which accelerates global warming [20] . Hence possible induced changes in farmers' behavior should be considered when designing control strategies for infectious diseases.",

In our framework, each node represents an agent involved in the cattle trade (farm, dealer, or market) and each agent can be in one of two states: susceptible (S) or infected (I). If detection is imperfect, there are two types of infected nodes: detected (I d ) and non-detected (I nd ), so the total number of infected nodes is I = I d + I nd . To adapt the model to vector-borne diseases an additional transmission channel must be considered. With vector-borne diseases, the infection can propagate through (a) commercial flows and (b) geographical proximity to infected nodes. The incorporation of both channels has been highlighted as a desirable feature for realistic epidemiologic models [24] . An additional geographic network capturing the risk of vector-transmitted infection of nodes located close to infected ones has to be taken into account.",

            "text": "An overview of the baseline model for a susceptible node exposed to infection is illustrated in Fig 1. At each time period there are 4 stages. In the first stage the trade of cattle takes place. At this stage all the market decisions are taken, animals are traded, and susceptible nodes can be exposed to infection through the arrival of infected animals. Second, there is the infection stage in which susceptible nodes exposed to infection (i.e. directly connected to an infectious node) can change from the S-state to the I-state with probability \u03bb. The probability of a node becoming infected depends on the number of infectious neighbors and can be computed as 1-(1-\u03bb) N , where N is the number of infectious neighbors. After the infection stage the disease is detected with probability \u03b3, which is equal to 1 if detection is perfect. Finally the control stage takes place, in which movement-restriction policies are implemented in two steps: first, the I dnodes are isolated with probability \u03b1; second, direct neighbors at the geographic network of infected and controlled nodes are isolated. Table 3 summarizes the main parameters involved in the transition between states. The transmission rate \u03bb depends on the disease and may also depend on other factors such as cattle density [25] and environmental factors [13] , which affect vector capacity (ability of vectors to acquire and transmit pathogens). The detection rate \u03b3 depends on two factors: the characteristics of the disease and the efficiency of the detection tools. The former is associated with the length of the incubation period or the rate of subclinical cases while the latter may depend on the sensitivity of available tests. The parameter \u03b1 reflects the efficiency of the authorities in implementing the MRP. Notice that the MRP isolates the nodes detected as infected as well as their geographic neighbors, which are considered to be those nodes directly linked through the geographic network. This simulates establishing a protection zone around the infected perimeter in which no infected animals have been detected but movements are restricted. The geographic network is simplified to a square lattice in which each node is connected to its immediate neighbors, so there are no hubs in the network. Both networks have the same number of nodes and are associated through a one-to-one mapping that randomly assigns the At the infection stage, the node changes to infected status with probability \u03bb; otherwise it retains the S-status during the whole period. At the detection stage, an infected node is detected with probability \u03b3 and adopts the I d -status; otherwise it takes the I nd -status. When disease is detected the node is removed from the network with probability \u03b1. Nodes with I nd -status and those with I d -status that are not removed (I dnc ) remain in the network until the next time period when they are again at risk of being detected or removed. Nodes can be removed from the network if they are infected, detected, and effectively controlled (I dc at control stage I), or if they enter a protection zone triggered when any direct neighbor in the geographic network is infected and controlled (C at control stage II). node's location, which remains fixed throughout the simulation. The infection is introduced by infecting one random node in the first period and the spread of the infection is summarized by the number of infected nodes up to 300 time periods. Since the probability of selling was derived for weekly cattle trade networks, a time period can be interpreted as a week in this analysis. For each scenario explored, 300 simulations were performed using Matlab (MathWorks).",

Factors that can limit the rate of detection include a high rate of subclinical cases, long incubation periods, and poor detection tools. The detection period can also be lengthened by the absence of active surveillance activities or lack of declaration in cases of clinical suspicion. For cow-calf systems or for dry dairy cows, farmers may easily miss some moderate clinical signs on some animals and not identify cases until clinical signs have become severe. Note that in the present study, changes in the efficiency of implementation of the control policy (\u03b1) have analogous results to changes in the detection rate (\u03b3), since the effective removal of the infected nodes depends on the product \u03b1\u00c3 \u03b3.",

This increase in the connectivity of the network accelerates the dissemination of disease.

If the rate of subclinical cases is high or the incubation period is long, infection at farms outside the RZ may be unnoticed and may be transmitted through premature selling of undetected but infected animals.

In particular, at early stages of an epidemic, the number of nodes engaging in anticipatory selling (i.e. those at the frontier of the RZ) is increasing in the size of the RZ and decreases as the entire territory becomes RZ.

On the one hand, the role of hubs as amplifiers of disease spreading is reduced through the MRP, but on the other hand, complementary strategies to control the spread of infection focused on the immunization of hubs will be less efficient compared to the situation without MRP.

The efficiency index is defined as the area above the curve with control policy (areas A+B) minus the area above the curve with no control policy (area A), over the area above the curve with no control policy (area A), i.e. \u00f0A\u00feB\u00de\u00c0AA \u00bc A\u00feB A \u00c0 1. (TIF)S2 Fig. Effect of the detection rate. Comparison of the accumulated number of infected nodes for a disease transmitted through both the geographic and trade networks. The efficiency of the MRP decreases along with the detection rate (\u03b3). These are average results over 300 simulations with infection rate \u03bb = 5% and control rate \u03b1 = 100%. (TIF) S3 Fig. Overlapping of extreme simulation results. Comparison of the accumulated number of infected nodes for a disease transmitted through both the geographic and trade networks and omitting the most extreme results of the simulations. These are average results over 300 simulations with infection rate \u03bb = 5%, detection rate \u03b3 = 20%, and control rate \u03b1 = 100%.
