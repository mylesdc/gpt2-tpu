            "text": "Results: In this study, we collected 177 intestinal samples from thress species of rodents in Jianchuan County, Yunnan Province, China. Alphacoronavirus and betacoronavirus were detected in 23 rodent samples from three species, namely Apodemus chevrieri (21/98), Eothenomys fidelis (1/62), and Apodemus ilex (1/17). We further characterized the full-length genome of an alphacoronavirus from the A. chevrieri rat and named it as AcCoV-JC34. The AcCoV-JC34 genome was 27,649 nucleotides long and showed a structure similar to the HKU2 bat coronavirus. Comparing the normal transcription regulatory sequence (TRS), 3 variant TRS sequences upstream the spike (S), ORF3, and ORF8 genes were found in the genome of AcCoV-JC34. In the conserved replicase domains, AcCoV-JC34 was most closely related to Rattus norvegicus coronavirus LNRV but diverged from other alphacoronaviruses, indicating that AcCoV-JC34 and LNRV may represent a novel alphacoronavirus species. However, the S and nucleocapsid proteins showed low similarity to those of LRNV, with 66.5 and 77.4% identities, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the S genes of AcCoV-JC34, LRNV, and HKU2 formed a distinct lineage with all known coronaviruses. Conclusions: Both alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses were detected in Apodemus chevrieri in the Yunnan Province of China, indicating that Apodemus chevrieri is an important host for coronavirus. Several new features were identified in the genome of an Apodemus chevrieri coronavirus. The phylogenetic distance to other coronaviruses suggests a variable origin and evolutionary route of the S genes of AcCoV-JC34, LRNV, and HKU2. These results indicate that the diversity of rodent coronaviruses is much higher than previously expected. Further surveillance and functional studies of these coronaviruses will help to better understand the importance of rodent as host for coronaviruses.",

Although murine hepatitis virus (MHV) has been used as a model to study CoV for a long time, limited information is available regarding the prevalence and diversity of rodent CoVs [15] [16] [17] [18] . Recently, several novel \u03b1-CoVs and \u03b2-CoVs (LRNV, LAMV, LRLV, and HKU24) were identified in rodents in China and Europe [19] [20] [21] . These discoveries suggested that rodents may carry diverse, unrecognized CoVs [22] . In the present study, we describe the first discovery of CoVs in 3 different rodent species in the Yunnan Province of China and report a much higher (21.4%) detection rate of CoV nucleic acid in A. chevrieri than in other rodent species studied previously (<5%) [19, 20] .

The most conserved proteins 3CL pro (nsp5), RdRp (nsp12), and Hel (nsp13) of AcCoV-JC34 possessed high aa identities, ranging from 91.9 to 96% compared to those of LRNV, but possessed low aa identities ranging from 57 to 77.9% compared to those of other known \u03b1-CoVs (Table 2 ). In addition, similar to the normal cleavage sites found in polyprotein of \u03b1-CoVs, 10 different cleavage sites were predicted between the nsps of AcCoV-JC34 (Table 4) . The S protein of AcCoV-JC34, consisting of 1126 amino acid residues, is predicted to be a type-I membrane glycoprotein with a signal peptide (residues 1 to 19), an extracellular region (residues 20 to 1070), a transmembrane domain (residues 1071 to 1093), and an intracellular region (residues 1094 to 1126) (Additional file 1: Figure S2 ).

The S protein of AcCoV-JC34 showed the highest aa similarity of 66.5% compared with rat CoV LRNV, followed by 39.2% compared with BtCoV HKU2. Proteolysis of the S protein plays a pivotal role in the activation of viral and cell membrane fusion. Two cleavage sites, one located at residue 508 at the S1/S2 interface (RRAR/AR), and the other located at residue 674 (R/S) at the S2\u2032 position, were predicted by comparing aa sequences based on analysis with a web-based ProP program (Additional file 1: Figure S2 ). The S1 region of AcCoV-JC34 has an Nterminal domain (NTD) and C-terminal domain (CTD). Both the NTD and CTD showed low aa sequence identities of <25% with those of other very well characterized CoVs. One of them was responsible for receptor recognition and binding, but due to the high dissimilarity with known receptor-binding domains (RBDs), it was difficult to determine the precise location of the RBD of AcCoV-JC34.",

In addition, both \u03b1-CoV and \u03b2-CoV were found in A. chevrieri, suggesting that A. chevrieri may play an important role as a natural CoV host. A. chevrieri is known as Chevrier's field mouse and is a dominant and endemic species in southwest China [32, 33] . In the Yunnan Province, A. chevrieri is an important pest in agriculture and human diseases that has been identified as a natural reservoir for plague bacilli and hantavirus [33] . The detection of both \u03b1-CoV and \u03b2-CoV in A. chevrieri with high infection rates highlighted the importance of viral surveillance in A. chevrieri in the Yunnan Province, which may be helpful for disease prevention and control. We further characterized a full-length genome of a novel \u03b1-CoV, AcCoV-JC34, from A. chevrieri. In all five conserved replicase domains, AcCoV-JC34 was the most closely related to a R. norvegicus CoV LNRV, but diverged from other \u03b1-CoVs, indicating that AcCoV-JC34 and LNRV belong to a novel \u03b1-CoV species.

These sequences containing the genes or elements were verified by PCR and NGS. Analysis of the aa sequence showed that the proteins encoded by AcCoV-JC34 had very low similarities to other \u03b1-CoVs. In particular, the S protein sequence had <20% sequence identity to other \u03b1-CoVs (except for LNRV and HKU2), but had a little higher identity (20.6 to 22.1%) compared to \u03b2-CoVs. In addition, the N proteins normally were conserved among each of CoV genera, but the N protein of AcCoV-JC34 only shared approximately 25% aa sequence identity with other \u03b1-CoVs (except for LNRV) ( Table 2 ). The phylogenetic trees for ORF1a, 1b, and N showed that AcCoV-JC34 and LNRV formed a distinct branch within but at the root position of \u03b1-CoVs, suggesting that AcCoV-JC34 and LNRV may represent a special evolutionary position among \u03b1-CoVs. More interestingly, in the phylogenetic trees of S, AcCoV-JC34, LNRV, and HKU2 formed a root branch including all CoVs. These results suggested that other unknown CoVs exist in rodents in nature. Further studies should be continued to reveal the prevalence, diversity, and evolution of rodent CoVs.",

During previous decades of research, different tissue tropisms of rodent CoVs have been observed. As the prototype of rodent CoVs, different MHV strains can infect variant tissues, and the A59 strain is primarily hepatotropic, but the JHM strain is neurotropic [15] [16] [17] [18] . RCoV and a strain of sialodacryoadenitis virus (SDAV) both primarily infect the respiratory tract [34] . However, the tropisms of recently identified rodent CoVs from China and Europe have not been confirmed. A CoV in lineage A of \u03b2-CoV detected in the alimentary tract samples of Norway rats, HKU24, probably has enteric tropism [20] . Another cluster of \u03b1-CoVs (PLMg1, UKMa2, UKMa1, and UKRn1) were only detected in liver samples of Norway rats, the bank vole, the wood mouse, and the noncyclic field vole, suggesting that they are hepatotropic [21] . Additional research identified rodent \u03b1-CoV LRNV and \u03b2-CoVs LAMV and LRLV, which came from diverse tissue types that made it difficult to predict the tissue tropism of these viruses [19] . Nonetheless, the extensively studied rodent CoVs (MHV and RCoV) could lead to severe or mild diseases in their hosts. Further studies are needed to determine the potential pathogenicity of AcCoV-JC34 along with other recently detected rodent CoVs.",

In different CoVs, the RBD can be located at the NTD or CTD in S1. For example, among the \u03b1-CoVs, CTD was characterized as RBD in HCoV NL63 (aa 476-616), 229E (aa 417-547), and PEDV [41] [42] [43] [44] , but the NTD was characterized as an RBD in the TGEV [45] . Here, the S1 of AcCoV-JC34 shared <20% aa sequence identity with those of very well characterized \u03b1-CoVs, which made it difficult to predict whether the RBD was located in NTD or CTD and which host molecule could be the possible receptor for AcCoV-JC34. The S2 of AcCoV-JC34 showed 40 to 50% identity to that of \u03b2-CoVs. By sequence alignment and SWISS-MODEL analysis (data not shown), we deduced the precise positions of FH, HR1, and HR2. The higher similarities between S2 of AcCoV-JC34 (HKU2) and \u03b2-CoVs than that to \u03b1-CoVs suggested that the structure and functional mechanism of S2 of AcCoV-JC34 may more homologous to \u03b2-CoVs.",

Previous data indicated that bats are natural reservoirs for \u03b1and \u03b2-CoVs [46] . A number of human CoVs, including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV229E, and NL63 might have originated from bats [47, 48] . Among the rodent CoVs, the receptor usage, tissue tropism, and pathogenesis of MHV have been studied in detail [49] . However, novel CoVs, like AcCoV-JC34, HKU24, LRNV, LAMV, and LRLV are not fully understood. Identification of the receptor for these viruses could help in evaluating the potential host range and ability for interspecies transmission from rodents to other mammals. Although most of these novel rodent CoVs have been characterized with full-length or near full-length genome sequences, the lack of successfully isolating those viruses thoroughly restricts future studies. More positive samples and cell lines will facilitate viral culture in the future. In addition, more attention should be paid to the diversity of CoVs in rodent, which could help to better understand the role of rodents in the evolution and ecology of CoVs.",
