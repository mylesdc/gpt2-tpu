Neurotropic demyelinating strain of MHV (MHV-A59 or its isogenic recombinant strain RSA59) induces MS-like disease in mice mediated by microglia, along with a small population of T cells. The mechanism of demyelination is at least in part due to microgliamediated myelin stripping, with some direct axonal injury. Immunization with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) induces experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mainly CD4 + T-cell-mediated disease, although CD8 + T cells may play a significant role in demyelination. It is possible that both autoimmune and nonimmune mechanisms such as direct viral toxicity may induce MS. Our study directly compares CNS pathology in autoimmune and viral-induced MS models. Mice with viral-induced and EAE demyelinating diseases demonstrated similar patterns and distributions of demyelination that accumulated over the course of the disease. However, significant differences in acute inflammation were noted. Inflammation was restricted mainly to white matter at all times in EAE, whereas inflammation initially largely involved gray matter in acute MHV-induced disease and then is subsequently localized only in white matter in the chronic disease phase. The presence of dual mechanisms of demyelination may be responsible for the failure of immunosuppression to promote long-term remission in many MS patients.",

Most studies have focused on the pathogenic role of myelin-specific CD4 + T cells because of the relatively strong association of susceptibility to MS with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II alleles [4] [5] [6] [7] , but there is also increasing recognition of the importance of CD8 + T cells in the pathogenesis of demyelination [8] [9] [10] .",

Major differences between the models reside in regional/tract specificity, kinetics of demyelination, and motor neuron involvement. All three models of induced EAE in mice provide a reasonable strategy for reproducing distinct adaptive immune-mediated pathologic features of demyelination. Previous studies [15] showed that the MP4 model is characterized by coinfiltration of B cells, CD8 + , CD4 + T cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages, whereas in MOG-and PLP-induced models, CD4 + T cells and macrophages were the predominant cell types. It is generally accepted that in different EAE models, CD4 + T cells and macrophages are the predominant lesional cell types, while CD4 + T cells are the main effector cells.",

Chronic viral-induced demyelination is associated with viral persistence [22, 23] and concomitant upregulation of major histocompatibility complex class I antigens [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] . While studies suggest that an intact adaptive immune system is required to promote demyelination in many viral induced models, one neurotropic strain of MHV, MHV-A59, promotes demyelination even in the absence of B and T cells [29] . Furthermore, depletion of CD4 + or CD8 + T cells after the acute phase of infection does not prevent demyelination [30] . Thus, different related strains of MHV may induce demyelination via unique mechanisms, and it is likely that in the absence of an intact immune response, CNS infection with some strains of MHV is responsible for onset of axonal loss and demyelination, possibly through direct destruction of CNS cells [31] .",

Such studies have utilized that differing genetic backgrounds, or similar genetic backgrounds may have been used but in different laboratories or at different times, thus limiting direct comparison of the models. While some similarities and differences in mechanisms of demyelination have been noted, it is not clear whether differences are due to the disease itself or due to genetic or environmental differences. In the current study, we compared EAE-and RSA59-(isogenic recombinant strain of MHV-A59)-induced neuroinflammation in the identical genetic background (C57BL/6) at the same time and in the same laboratory and directly compared the type and pattern of CNS inflammation.",

CNS inflammation was present throughout the disease course, and levels of demyelination progressed over time ( Figure 2 ; Table 1 ). At all time points, infiltrating inflammatory cells (LCA + and CD3 + ) in EAE spinal cords were restricted to white matter, without significant gray matter inflammation ( Figure 2 ; Table 2 ).

Demyelinating plaques were detected by LFB staining at day 7, and spinal cords showed a similar pattern of demyelination at day 30, but the number and area of plaques was larger (Figures 4(c) and 4(d) ). Average demyelination is shown in Table 1 . In contrast to EAE, LCA + cells are present in both gray and white matters of brain and spinal cord during acute MHV infection, but by day 30, they localize to white matter tracts, especially in spinal cord and deep cerebellar white matter (Figures 3 and 4 ; Table 2 ). In spinal cord, at days 3 and 5, most LCA + are Iba-1 + (microglia/macrophage marker), and these cells are present in gray matter (data not shown), and by day 7, LCA + /Iba-1 + cells localize in both gray and white matters (Figure 4 ; Table 2 ). By day 30, LCA + and Iba1 + cells are present mainly in demyelinating plaques. In addition to the change in distribution of LCA + cells, there is also a change in staining intensity and morphology. At early phases (Figure 4(a) ), cells are compact and darkly staining, whereas at late phases (Figure 4(b) ), cells are more ramified and less intensely stained, reflecting a change from newly arrived monocytes to mature activated macrophages. Data demonstrates that in viral-infected spinal cord there is an increase of Iba1 + cells; however, the distribution of these inflammatory cells varies significantly at different days after infection. Interestingly, in contrast to EAE, CD3 + cells are virtually absent.",

Though the gross level of inflammation was similar between the two models, significant differences were observed in the pattern of CNS inflammation. In EAE, inflammation was observed only in white matter at all phases of disease (Table 2 ). This is not unexpected since the myelin antigenic target is concentrated in white matter. In contrast, almost all MHV-infected mice exhibited inflammation within gray matter during the acute phase of disease, with inflammation becoming restricted to white matter in the chronic phase (Table 2 ). This pattern is consistent with the neuronal tropism of demyelinating strain of MHV and its subsequent axonal transport into white matter reported previously [31, 40] . Findings are consistent with prior studies suggesting that CNS tissue injury in MHV infection is mediated both by viral-induced cytotoxicity and by immune mechanisms. The relative contributions of these two components differ depending on viral tropism, rate of viral spread, and specificity of the immune response [40] . Recent neural cell tropism studies indicate that axonal transport of MHV from gray to white matter is necessary to induce demyelination [31, 34] . Results show how direct autoimmune inflammation along CNS white matter tracts and inflammation secondary to viral infection tracking from ",

Luxol fast blue stain identifies early demyelinating plaques in the white matter. During the progressive phase, there is persistent LCA immunoreactivity, whereas CD3 is decreased. The size of demyelinating plaques increases. At later times (chronic phase), LCA immunoreactivity decreases, while CD3 increases. Demyelinating plaques increase in number and size. Arrows mark locations of demyelinating plaques.gray matter to white matter can both produce similar chronic white matter demyelinating plaques.
