Human calcitonin (hCT) is a typical amyloidogenic peptide, its aggregation is associated with medullary carcinoma of the thyroid (MTC), and also limits its clinical application. Magnolia officinalis is a traditional Chinese herbal medicine; its two major polyphenol components, magnolol (Mag) and honokiol (Hon), have displayed multiple functions. Polyphenols like flavonoids and their derivatives have been extensively studied as amyloid inhibitors. However, the anti-amyloidogenic property of a biphenyl backbone containing polyphenols such as Mag and Hon has not been reported. In this study, these two compounds were tested for their effects on hCT aggregation. We found that Mag and Hon both inhibited the amyloid formation of hCT, whereas Mag showed a stronger inhibitory effect; moreover, they both dose-dependently disassembled preformed hCT aggregates. Further immuno-dot blot and dynamic light scattering studies suggested Mag and Hon suppressed the aggregation of hCT both at the oligomerization and the fibrillation stages, while MTT-based and dye-leakage assays demonstrated that Mag and Hon effectively reduced cytotoxicity caused by hCT aggregates. Furthermore, isothermal titration calorimetry indicated Mag and Hon both interact with hCT. Together, our study suggested a potential anti-amyloidogenic property of these two compounds and their structure related derivatives.",

In pathological situations, amyloidogenic proteins aggregate into oligomers, followed by forming extensive linear fibrils, which is accompanied with a structural transition into \u03b2 -sheet-rich structures 4-9 . Studies have shown that the oligomeric intermediates are the most toxic species during amyloid aggregation 10-13 , which induce cell apoptosis mostly by penetrating the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane 14-16 . Preventing amyloid proteins from aggregating into toxic conformers has thus become a strategy to prevent or treat amyloid diseases 17 .",

Originally, hCT was used to treat osteoporosis and Paget's disease 19,20 , however, due to its high intrinsic tendency to aggregate and the low bioactivity as the result of aggregation, the clinical application of hCT has been discontinued by FDA 21,22 . Moreover, amyloid deposits of hCT have been discovered in patients with medullary carcinoma of the thyroid (MTC), indicating an association between MTC and hCT aggregation 23,24 . Therefore, salmon calcitonin (sCT), which has much lower aggregation propensity but only shares 50% homology to hCT, is clinically used instead 25 . However, hCT has a much higher potency than sCT 26 , and sCT administration can cause side effects like anorexia and vomiting 27,28 . Inhibiting hCT aggregation is thus of great importance both for pharmaceutical preparation of hCT in vitro and for the treatment of MTC.",

In the presence of Mag and Hon, hCT showed no obvious fibrils after 72 h of incubation ( Fig. 2E-J) . Amorphous aggregates were observed for hCT samples co-incubated with Mag and Hon at molar ratios of 1:1 or 3:1 (Fig. 2E ,F,H,I), whereas fewer aggregates were observed in the presence of 5-fold molar amount of Mag or Hon (Fig. 2G ,J).",

The addition of 1 \u03bc M hCT resulted in 26% membrane disruption compared with the vesicles treated with Triton X-100, which was set as 100% (P < 0.05; Fig. 5B ). Addition an equimolar amount of EGCG significantly decreased dye leakage to 2% (P < 0.05). The presence of Mag and Hon both dose-dependently protected the membrane. Equimolar amount of two compounds slightly attenuated the membrane penetration to 14% and 18%, respectively (P < 0.05; Fig. 5B ), while higher concentrations of compounds (3-fold and 5-fold) almost completely abolished membrane disruption (P < 0.05; Fig. 5B ). Magnolol and honokiol can disaggregate preformed hCT aggregates. The efficacy of Mag and Hon to disaggregate preformed hCT aggregates was determined by ThT fluorescence assay. hCT was pre-incubated for 48 h to form aggregates, different amounts of compounds were then added. Adding equimolar amounts of Mag and Hon showed no obvious disaggregation effect, while the presence of 3-fold amount of either compound prevented further aggregation of hCT (Fig. 6A,B) . When the molar ratio of Mag and Hon was further increased to 5:1, the hCT aggregates were disassembled with ThT fluorescence intensity remarkably reduced to 53% and 55% of untreated control after 48 h of incubation, respectively (Fig. 7) . The morphology of hCT aggregates after disaggregation was then observed under TEM. Addition of Mag and Hon disaggregated preformed hCT fibrils into small amorphous aggregates (Fig. 6E,F) , which agrees with ThT fluorescence assay results. We then quantitated the soluble hCT concentrations in the supernatant after disaggregation by using bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay. After 48 h of pre-incubation, the concentration of soluble hCT in the supernatant was lower than 20 \u03bc g/ mL (Fig. 6G) , whereas the equimolar amount of EGCG increased hCT concentration to ca. 50 \u03bc g/mL (P < 0.05; Fig. 6H,I) . Equimolar amounts of Mag and Hon showed no obvious disaggregation effect, whereas at higher concentrations (3:1 and 5:1) significantly increased concentration of soluble hCT in the supernatant (more than 100 \u03bc g/mL) were observed after 48 h of incubation with two compounds (Fig. 6H,I) .",

Mag and Hon both directly bound to hCT ( Figure S3 ), dose-dependently suppressed hCT aggregation (Fig. 2) , and could disassemble preformed hCT aggregates (Fig. 6) .",

            "text": "Compared with Hon, Mag displayed a similar inhibitory effect at a low equimolar concentration (1:1), but stronger inhibitory effects at high concentrations (3:1 and 5:1). ITC results also indicated Mag bound to hCT with a higher binding constant compared to Hon ( Figure S3 ). This may due to the slight structural difference between two compounds. With two adjacent hydroxyls, Mag is more likely to form intramolecular hydrogen bonds, which causes a smaller angle between two benzene rings compared to Hon 68, 69 . When binding to hCT molecules, a larger angle between two benzene rings may produce greater steric hindrance, which may explain the relatively lower potency of Hon compared to Mag on inhibiting hCT aggregation. It is also noted that Mag and Hon may inhibit hCT aggregation through different mechanisms. ThT fluorescence assay suggested that Mag increased lag time, and inhibited aggregation from oligomerization stage, whereas Hon showed little effects on increasing lag time although it decreased the fibril elongation rate ( Fig. 2A,B) . ITC assay also suggested Mag and Hon bound to hCT at a 1:1 and 3:1 stoichiometry, respectively ( Figure S3 ), possibly indicating different binding sites on hCT between two compounds. Notably, in the dot blot assay, honokiol showed a stronger inhibitory effect compared with magnolol, especially at an equimolar ratio; this may also due to different interactions between two compounds, which leads to the different conformations formed during aggregation, and interferes the dot blot results. However, the molecular mechanism of inhibitory effects of Mag and Hon on hCT amyloid formation remained to be clarified, and it will be of great interest to detect monomer and polymers formed during aggregation with specific monoclonal antibody by using western blot approach as Tufail, S. et al. described 70 . It will also be useful to probe the exact membrane protection mechanisms of Hon and Mag by using biophysical techniques, particularly, with the use of high-resolution solids-state NMR approaches 50,55,71-73 . In summary, our studies indicated Mag and Hon inhibited the oligomerization and fibrillation of hCT, disassembled hCT aggregates at higher molar ratios, and more importantly, reduced membrane disruption and cytotoxicity induced by hCT aggregates. Our results suggested a potential anti-amyloidogenic property of Mag and Hon, and polyphenols with a biphenyl backbone may further be explored to design effective anti-amyloidosis compounds.",

The absorbance was measured at 562 nm, and the concentration of hCT was calculated by referring to standard curve. All experiments were repeated for at least 3 times. ITC measurements. ITC measurements were performed on a Microcal VP-ITC titration calorimeter (GE Healthcare, USA) at 25 \u00b0C. hCT and compounds were dissolved in 50 mM PBS (pH 7.4, containing 100 mM NaCl), and solutions were degassed for 5 min by using ThermoVac (GE Healthcare, USA). hCT was used as a titrant in the sample cell at a concentration of 10 \u03bc M, while Mag (0.2 mM) and Hon (0.4 mM) were loaded into the syringe. Compounds were injected into hCT solution with 25 consecutive injections with stirring at 307 rpm. The first injection volume was 3 \u03bc L with 6-s duration, while the rest injection volume was 10 \u03bc L with injection duration of 20 s. Control experiments were carried out by injecting compounds into PBS, and results were analyzed with MicroCal ORIGIN software with curves fitted with a one set of sites model.",
