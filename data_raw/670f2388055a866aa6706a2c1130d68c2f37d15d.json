            "text": "Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a naturally occurring bioactive phospholipid, activates G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), leading to regulation of diverse cellular events including cell survival and apoptosis. Despite extensive studies of the signaling pathways that mediate LPA-regulated cell growth and survival, the mechanisms underlying the apoptotic effect of LPA remain largely unclear. In this study, we investigated this issue in HeLa cells. Our data demonstrate that LPA induces apoptosis in HeLa cells at pathologic concentrations with a concomitant upregulation of the expression of TNFRSF21 (tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 21), also known as death receptor number 6 (DR6) involved in inflammation. Moreover, treatment of cells with LPA receptor (LPAR) antagonist abolished the DR6 upregulation by LPA. LPA-induced DR6 expression was also abrogated by pertussis toxin (PTX), an inhibitor of GPCRs, and by inhibitors of PI3K, PKC, MEK, and ERK. Intriguingly, LPA-induced DR6 expression was specifically blocked by dominant-negative form of PKC (PKC -DN). LPA-induced DR6 expression was also dramatically inhibited by knockdown of ERK or CREB. These results suggest that activation of the MEK/ERK pathway and the transcription factor CREB mediate LPA-induced DR6 expression. More interestingly, knockdown of DR6 using siRNA approach remarkably attenuated LPA-induced apoptosis. In conclusion, our results suggest that LPA-induced apoptosis in HeLa cells is mediated by the upregulation of DR6 expression.",

            "text": "Lysophosphatidic acid (1-or 2-acyl-lysophosphatidic acid, LPA) is a naturally occurring bioactive phospholipid. Under normal physiological conditions, LPA is present at a low level in plasma (\u223c100 nM) [1] and its concentration elevates at sites of tissue injury and inflammation [1, 2] . LPA is produced during phospholipid biosynthesis of cell membranes. LPA is also produced extracellularly by several cell types including activated platelets, leukocytes, epithelial cells, neuronal cells, and tumor cells [3] . Increasing evidence suggests that LPA plays a role in various inflammatory disease [4] [5] [6] . LPA regulates various developmental, physiological, and pathophysiological processes including cell motility, invasion, proliferation, survival, and production of growth factors [7, 8] through G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). Platelet-derived LPA plays an important role in tissue regeneration and wound healing [9, 10] . LPA also functions as a chemoattractant promoting motility of various types of human cancer cells [11] . Recent studies suggest that tumor cells stimulate the production of LPA from activated platelets, which enhances both tumor growth and cytokine-mediated bone destruction [12, 13] , and that specific inhibition of LPA receptors abolishes the migration of cancer cell response 2 Mediators of Inflammation to malignant ascites containing LPA [14] . The increased expression of LPA receptors is associated with an increased level of invasiveness in ovarian cancer cells [15, 16] . Thus, LPA has diverse biological activities implicated in tumor initiation and progression, including increasing cell survival, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis. Paradoxically, LPA also induces apoptosis in certain cells, such as neuronal cells [17] and epithelial cells from different tissues [18] [19] [20] , myeloid progenitor cells, hippocampal neurons, and PC12 cells [3] . However, the mechanism by which LPA induces apoptosis remains unclear.",

HeLa cells were treated with various stimuli including 0.1 M angiotensin II (AgII), 20 ng/mL insulin, 25 M LPA, 1 g/mL LPS, 50 ng/mL NGF-, 0.1 unit/mL thrombin, 50 ng/mL TNF-, and 100 ng/mL phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). The expression of DR6 mRNA was measured by Northern blot at different time points as indicated. As shown in Figure 2 (a), it was noted that only TNF-, PMA, and LPA significantly upregulated DR6 expression at 7 hrs. TNF-has been known to induce DR6 in several cancer cell lines [26] . PMA has also been reported to upregulate DR6 expression during T-cell activation [27] . As shown in Figure 2 (b), DR6 mRNA expression in HeLa cells treated with 25 M LPA increased transiently, with a peak level at 5-7 hr. As shown in Figure 2 (c), LPA upregulated DR6 mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner and reached a plateau at 25-50 M. This result is further confirmed by RT-PCR (Supplemental Figure 1 ). Next, we sought to determine whether LPA regulates DR6 protein expression following a similar time course. As shown in Figure 2 (d), 25 M LPA treatment transiently increased DR6 protein expression in HeLa cells as early as 9 hr, with a peak level at 15-17 hr. Figure 4 (a), treatment with LPA significantly induced MEK, ERK, and p90RSK phosphorylation. To determine the mechanism underlying LPA-induced DR6 expression, we first examined the effect of pertussis toxin (PTX), which inactivates the LPA receptorcoupled Gi/o type G protein [28] , as shown in Figure 4 (a); treatment with PTX inhibited LPA-induced phosphorylation of MEK, ERK, and p90RSK. LPA-induced phosphorylation of MEK, ERK, and p90RSK was also inhibited by wortmannin, a PI3K inhibitor, Ro 31-8220, a PKC inhibitor, and U-0126, a MEK inhibitor (Figure 4(a) ). Next, we examined the roles of these kinases in LPA-induced DR6 expression. As shown in Figure 4 (b), LPA-induced increase in the level of DR6 mRNA was strongly inhibited by Ro 31-8220, a cell-permeable inhibitor of PKC isoforms PKC , PKC , PKC , and PKC . Another PKC inhibitor GF 109203X also significantly inhibited LPA-induced DR6 mRNA expression, but not as strongly as Ro 31-8220. In addition to PKC inhibitors, the MEK inhibitor U-0126 and PI3K inhibitor wortmannin also significantly inhibited LPA-induced DR6 mRNA expression. The G protein inhibitor, PTX, inhibited LPA-induced DR6 mRNA expression too, but to a lesser extent. On the other hand, inhibition of p38 and JNK activity with SB203580 and JNK inhibitor had no effect on LPA-induced increase in DR6 mRNA expression. Together, our results suggested that PI3K/PKC/MEK pathway mediates LPA-induced DR6 expression.",

To determine the specific isoform of PKC that contributes to LPA-induced DR6 expression, we first determined the LPA-induced activation of major PKC isoforms, PKC / , PKC , PKC / , and PKC . HeLa cells were treated with 25 M LPA for different time as indicated and the activation of the PKC isoforms was detected by The cells were then lysed, and 50 g of the cell lysates was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with anti-DR6 antibody and then were visualized by the enzyme-linked chemiluminescence system. The bar graphs below are densitometry analyses of DR6 protein expression. Data presented are mean \u00b1 SD from 3 independent experiments, with untreated controls set as 1. * < 0.05, * * < 0.001 versus control; \u2020 < 0.05 versus 15-17 time points. Western blot analysis. As shown in Figure 5 (a), upon treatment with LPA, all PKCs examined were activated to various extents. Among them, the high level of basal phosphorylation of PKC / was not significantly affected by LPA treatment. Similarly, the phosphorylation levels of PKC and PKC / were also slightly increased by LPA treatment during the time course. On the other hand, PKC was remarkably activated upon treatment with LPA as determined by the rapid and robust increase in the phosphorylation level of it. Next, we determined the effect of expression of dominantnegative forms of these PKC isoforms on the LPA-induced DR6 expression. As shown in Figure 5 expression of dominant-negative form of PKC almost completely blocked LPA-induced DR6 mRNA expression. Together, our data strongly suggest that PKC is the major PKC isoform that is functionally involved in signaling pathway that mediates LPA-induced DR6 expression. These data demonstrated for the first time PKC isoform-specific transcriptional regulation of LPA-induced DR6 expression. Figure 4 showed that LPA induced the activation of both ERK and p90RSK. Previous study has reported that LPA can induce p90RSK activation through ERK [29] . The serine/threonine kinase p90Rsk is known to directly phosphorylate the transcriptional factor CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein) [30, 31] . Thus, we thought to determine whether LPA-induced activation of MEK-ERK-90RSK pathway leads to the activation of CREB and whether CREB is involved in LPA-induced expression of DR6. As shown in Figure 6 (a), LPA induced activation of MEK and ERK1/2 at a very early time point. Moreover, LPA also strongly induced the activation of the transcription factor CREB in a time-dependent manner. To determine the role of these molecules in LPAregulated DR6 expression, we employed a siRNA approach. As shown in Figure 6 (b), knockdown of ERK and CREB strongly blocked LPA-induced DR6 mRNA expression. As shown in Figure 6 (c), Western blot analysis confirmed the efficient knockdown of the expression of ERK and CREB. As expected, the protein level of DR6 was dramatically reduced in ERK-and CREB-knockdown cells. These observations suggest that LPA induces DR6 expression through activation of the PKC -ERK signaling pathway and the subsequent activation of CREB. ",

As a control, no apoptotic sign was detected in cells infected with virus expressing LacZ protein. Taken together, these results clearly indicate that overexpression of DR6 induces apoptosis in HeLa cells. Next, to determine whether LPA-upregulated DR6 expression accounts for the apoptosis induced by LPA, we determined the effect of knockdown of DR6 on LPA-induced apoptosis. As shown in Figure 7 (b), as expected, treatment with DR6-specific siRNA strongly inhibited DR6 expression as determined by the reduction in the DR6 protein level. Interestingly, DR6-siRNA treatment also strongly inhibited LPA-induced apoptosis as determined by the reduction of caspase activation and PARP cleavage. These results strongly suggest that LPA-induced apoptosis is mediated by induction of DR6 expression. ",

This concentration range has been used to determine the apoptotic activity of LPA in other cell types, such as epithelial cells [18] and neuronal cells [17] .",

The function of LPA as a cell survival factor has been well studied; however, the mechanism by which LPA induces apoptosis remains elusive. In the current study, using pharmaceutical inhibitors, dominant-negative mutations, and siRNA approach, we explored the mechanism(s) underlying LPA-induced apoptosis. To this end, our results revealed several interesting findings. First, LPA induced apoptosis at pathologic concentrations in HeLa cells. Second, treatment with LPA resulted in remarkable upregulated expression of DR6. Third, knockdown of DR6 strongly blocked LPA-induced apoptosis. Fourth, LPA receptors 1 and 3 antagonist inhibited LPA-induced DR6 expression. Finally, inhibition of various kinases, PI3K/PKC/MEK/ERK, and their regulated transcription factor CREB strongly inhibited LPA-induced DR6 expression. Together, these results strongly suggest that LPA-induced apoptosis is mediated by upregulation of DR6 expression via activation of PI3K/PKC/MEK/ERK pathways leading to the activation of the transcription factor CREB, which controls the expression of DR6.",

DR6 is a relatively less characterized member of the TNF death receptor family of protein. To date, DR6 still remains as an orphan receptor and no specific cognate ligand for it has yet been identified. Most of our current knowledge about the cellular and physiological role and biological function of DR6 comes from studying the effect of DR6 gene ablation in mice or ectopic expression of DR6 in cultured cells [36] . Recent studies reported that DR6 expression is upregulated in neurodegenerative disease such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and the upregulated expression of DR6 may contribute to the pathogenesis of these neurodegenerative disorders [37, 38] . Interestingly, LPA has also been implicated in apoptotic neurodegeneration [17, [39] [40] [41] ; however, the mechanism by which LPA induces apoptotic cell death remains elusive. In this study, our data demonstrated for the first time that LPA upregulated DR6 expression and that knockdown of DR6 strongly blocked LPA-induced apoptosis, strongly suggesting that LPA induces apoptosis via upregulating DR6 expression. Thus, our finding that LPA-induced apoptosis was mediated by upregulation of DR6 expression suggests a possibility that LPA may contribute to neurodegeneration through elevating DR6 protein level.",

Studies have reported that exogenous expression of DR6 could mimic ligand activation and triggered ligand-independent downstream apoptotic signaling cascades [21, 22] . However, although overexpression of DR6 causes apoptotic cell death, it has been found that the expression level of DR6 is elevated in several tumors in humans and the elevated expression of DR6 is regulated through activation of NF-kB [26] . Furthermore, these authors have also demonstrated that expression of DR6 expression could be induced by tumor necrosis factor-(TNF-) treatment and TNF--induced DR6 expression is also mediated by activation of NF-kB [26] . In contrast to this finding, it was recently reported that activation of NF-kB inhibited (E)-2,4-Bis(p-hydroxyphenyl)-2-butenal-induced DR6 expression in colon cancer cells [42] . These controversial observations might have resulted from the use of different experimental systems, such as different cell lines and different stimuli, in these studies. Interestingly, in the current study, our data demonstrated that LPA-induced DR6 expression is mediated by the activation of CREB. Our finding further supports the assumption that different stimuli activate different pathways and lead to activation of different transcriptional factors that govern the expression of DR6.",

Regarding the seemingly contradictory effects of LPA on promoting cell survival and apoptosis, one possibility is that the concentration of LPA used in inducing apoptosis is higher than that used in cell survival. For example, the concentration of LPA in promoting cell survival is in the 10 M range [43, 44] . On the other hand, the concentrations of LPA used to induce apoptosis are mostly higher than 20 M [17, 18, 39, 40] . Other possibilities are that different cell types express different isoforms of LPA receptors and have unique gene expression and regulation patterns that are variably altered by LPA signals, as reviewed previously [3] .",
