They act as recognition and adhesion molecules and as signal transducers involved in a plethora of physiological functions [1, 2] . They possess at least one carbohydrate binding domain which, when these domains are combined, enables their multivalency and cross-linking of glycoconjugates [1, 3] . The first discovered and the most extensively investigated are lectins from plants, however, in recent years fungal lectins have been gaining more attention [4, 5] . Fungal lectins differ from their counterparts from other species in their unique structures and binding specificities [6] . They have shown to be very stable proteins, resistant to changes in pH and temperature as well as to proteolytic digestion, which strengthens their potential for application in biotechnology and medicine. We have previously isolated and characterized biochemically a novel lectin from Macrolepiota procera designated as MpL [7] . MpL is structurally similar to the B subunit of ricin, a lectin from the castor bean Ricinus communis, a canonical member of the \u03b2-trefoil-type lectins [8, 9] . Fungal \u03b2-trefoil type lectins exhibit remarkable diversity in their binding partners, which include carbohydrates and proteins [6, 10, 11] . MpL is active as a dimer and possesses a strong carbohydrate binding domain specific for terminal N-acetyllactosamine and other \u03b2-galactosides on \u03b1-repeat and a putative carbohydrate binding domain with unknown specificity on \u03b3-repeat [7] .",

            "text": "Lysosomal targets, including peptidases, constitute a challenge in cancer treatment. The invasiveness of cancer cells is known to depend on the degradation of extracellular matrix (ECM), a barrier that prevents cancer cells from migrating and invading distant sites. ECM is degraded extracellularly predominantly by matrix metallopeptidases, however, the process is greatly accelerated if fragments of ECM proteins are internalized by cancer cells and ultimately degraded within the lysosomes. We and others have shown that inhibition of lysosomal peptidases impairs cancer cell invasion [16] [17] [18] . Cathepsins, lysosomal cysteine peptidases, are particularly important in this process and can be targeted in the lysosomes by small inhibitors which can enter the cells by diffusion, or by specific protein inhibitors, such as clitocypin and cystatin C. Clitocypin is a fungal inhibitor of cysteine peptidases that shares the same \u03b2-trefoil fold as MpL and is an inhibitor of papain-like cysteine peptidases such as papain, cathepsins L, V, S and K, but a weak inhibitor of cathepsin B [19] [20] [21] . Human cystatin C is a potent inhibitor of papain-like cysteine peptidases, including cathepsin B [22] [23] [24] . However, the ability of protein inhibitors to enter the cells and localize within the lysosomes is very low [25] . Delivery systems able to guide peptidase inhibitors to lysosomes could significantly enhance cell uptake and increase inhibition of lysosomal proteolytic activity.",

Similarly, when lactose (0.1 M), a competitive inhibitor of glycan binding to the MpL's \u03b1-repeat, was added to the medium, internalization of MpL and D109R was blocked.

Inhibition of clathrin-independent endocytosis by Filipin III (the inhibitor of caveolae formation) had no effect on MpL uptake (Figure 2A , Supplementary Figure 3A ). However, the inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis by chlopromazine completely abolished the uptake of MpL into cells, being co-localized with the cell membrane labelled with embedded palmitoylated GFP ( Figure 2B, Supplementary Figure 3B ). Similar accumulation of membrane bound MpL was observed in the presence of lactose ( Figure 2B , Supplementary Figure 3B ).

Through ligand-receptor binding, MpL triggers cell uptake, by clathrin-dependent endocytosis, resulting in its accumulation in GA and endo/lysosomal (Figure 7) . Similar binding and internalization behaviour was also demonstrated for MpL when it was fused with other proteins. The fusion of MpL with cysteine peptidase inhibitors significantly improved their delivery to endo/lysosomal vesicles, resulting in greatly reduced degradation of ECM by their lysosomal targets, cysteine cathepsins, and consequently decreased the migration and invasiveness of cancer cells.",

Internalization of MpL by human cells depends on the functional binding site on the \u03b1-repeat, while the nematotoxicity of MpL has been linked to the \u03b3-binding site with unknown carbohydrate binding specificity.

The co-localisation of aminopeptidase N and MpL in MCF10A neoT cells was weak at shorter time points (\u2264 60 min), however, with prolonged incubation (4 h) the co-localization signal increased within endo/lysosomal 'dot-like' structures, suggesting an increase in the internalization of the aminopeptidase N. Aminopeptidase N is normally endocytosed by constitutive/physiological sorting mechanisms [49] . In polarized epithelial cells (HepG2, human liver cancer cells) it was found targeted into distinct sorting endosomes and, eventually, into endo/ lysosomes in a clathrin-and dynamin-dependent manner [50] . The dynamics of this process are in accordance with slow endo/lysosomal targeting of MpL. Furthermore, it was shown that the internalization of aminopeptidase N can be triggered by binding of Abs [51] , coronavirus, drugs [48] , or CD13-targeted vesicles [49] . In contrast, human galectin 3, which specifically binds poly-Nacetyllactosamine (repeating -3Gal\u03b21-4GlcNAc\u03b21-units) and is another strong aminopeptidase N ligand, failed to induce its internalization [42, 47] .",

Integrins are a family of heterodimeric cell surface receptors mediating adhesion of cells to the proteins of ECM. Binding of MpL to the integrin receptor caused its partial internalization and rapid translocation towards GA-like structures. Integrins have very dynamic structures and are constantly endocytosed from the plasma membrane by formation of clathrin-coated pits, caveolin vesicles or lipid rafts [52] . From early endosomes integrins recycle back to the plasma membrane through endosomes and the perinuclear recycling endosomes or they recycle directly from early endosomes [52] . However, it was recently shown that in HeLa cells endocytosed integrins traffic from recycling endosomes to the TGN and that a component of TGN plays a rate-limiting role in integrin trafficking [52] . Internalization of \u03b13\u03b21 integrin can also be induced with specific Abs [53] as well as by binding to Oncotarget 26905 www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget galectin 3 [54] . Therefore, we hypothesize that binding to integrins and recycling through TGN could explain fast internalization and targeting of MpL to components of GA. Fast internalization has been observed also for the lectin MOA that induces internalization and degradation of integrin \u03b21, however it is not clear whether MOA binds integrin \u03b21 directly [43] .",

Furthermore, U937 cell line showed reduced adhesion to fibronectin when treated by MpL at 1.5 \u03bcM as determined by a real-time cell analysis (not shown).

This hypothesis has been tested on cysteine cathepsins, lysosomal peptidases, involved in tumor migration, invasion and metastasis. Cysteine cathepsins, the most prominent one in cancer being cathepsin B, are involved in the degradation of the ECM proteins (type IV collagen, laminin and fibronectin), thus facilitating growth and invasion of tumor cells into surrounding tissue and vasculature. After partial extracellular degradation ECM fragments are internalized to tumor cells and completely degraded in lysosomes by cathepsin B and other peptidases [16, 55] . We have demonstrated that low molecular weight inhibitors of cathepsin B, able to inactivate both intra-and extracellular fractions of cathepsin B, effectively impair tumor progression [18] . The same holds for endogenous protein inhibitors cystatins [56] , however, their uptake by cells and transport to lysosomes limits their effective inhibition. To enhance the delivery of cystatins to lysosomes therefore, we created fusion proteins of MpL and cystatin C (CysC) and clitocypin (Clt). The fusions followed the same internalization route as unlinked MpL (Supplementary Figure 6 ) and, moreover, retained strong inhibitory potential towards their proteolytic targets.",

Inhibition of migration of MCF10A neoT cells in the absence of Matrigel by CysC-MpL fusion indicated that both cell migration and extracellular matrix degradation is reduced by addition of the fusion protein (Supplementary Figure 9) . The stronger effect of CysC-MpL fusion on cell invasion was confirmed by flow cytometry, which showed a significant decrease of DQcollagen IV degradation only in cells treated with CysC-MpL. As a final point, the partial inhibition of MCF10A neoT invasion upon treatment with the combination of non-fused inhibitor cystatin C and MpL indicated that incubation with lectin can facilitate endocytosis of other molecules present in the medium. Similarly, it has been shown that the fungal lectin XCL stimulates the uptake of poorly internalized molecules via a clathrin-dependent mechanism [40].",

In the assay, their invasion relies on effective degradation of Matrigel coating, a gelatinous protein mixture resembling the ECM. Both fusions reduced the invasion of MCF10A neoT cells through Matrigel (Figure 6, invasion graphs). In particular, the CysC-MpL fusion lowered the invasion speed significantly (slopes of linear regression curves) and the cumulative number of invaded cells (area under curve) as compared to control (Figure 6A, right column graphs, Supplementary Figure 8). Its effect were even more pronounced than the effect of intracellular protease inhibitor E64d (Supplementary Figure 8). The use of unlinked CysC and MpL alone resulted in speeds of invasion and cumulative numbers of invaded cells comparable to those of controls, whereas the combination of unlinked CysC and MpL led to a reduced cumulative number of invaded cells, due to lower invasion speed at the beginning of the experiment (Figure 6A, right column graphs, Supplementary Figure 8). Clt-MpL fusion also lowered the invasion speed and the cumulative number of invaded cells (Figure 6B, right column graphs) although the effect was not as pronounced as in the case of CysC-MpL.
