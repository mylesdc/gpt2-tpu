            "text": "To ensure efficient virus replication, herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) encodes several viral proteins to counter host defense response upon infection. Among these proteins, the multifunctional viral protein \u03b334.5 crucially interferes with or disrupts several antiviral pathways at multiple levels. The current study shows that \u03b334.5 utilizes nucleolar protein NOP53 to facilitate the dephosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor eIF2\u03b1 for efficient viral translation. Our study shows that: (1) ectopic expression of NOP53 greatly increases the intracellular and extracellular viral yields of HSV-1 (wild strain F) in type I interferon-deficient Vero cells, and more subtly promotes viral replication of \u03b334.5 deletion mutant virus HSV-1/\u0394\u03b334.5. (2) NOP53 is migrated from nuclei in HSV-1/F infected cells, but is redistributed incompletely after infection by either HSV-1/\u0394\u03b334.5 or ICP4 deletion mutant virus HSV-1/d120 (replication inadequate). Ectopic expression of \u03b334.5, consequently, induces cytoplasmic translocation of NOP53 in response to HSV-1/\u0394\u03b334.5 infection.",

(4) Knockdown of NOP53, which impairs the specific interaction between \u03b334.5 and protein phosphatase PP1\u03b1, disrupts the ability of \u03b334.5 to maintain HSV-1 virulence. (5) NOP53 knockdown also significantly reduces tissue damage and decreases viral yield in livers of HSV-1 infected mice. Our findings expand the understanding of the underlying mechanism by which viral protein \u03b334.5 induces NOP53 redistribution; cytoplasmic NOP53 facilitates \u03b334.5 recruitment of PP1\u03b1 to dephosphorylate eIF2\u03b1, for optimal viral replication.

HSV-1 infection triggers a rapid induction of cellular defense responses. One of the earliest responses to infection is activation of double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase R (PKR). An important function of activated PKR during viral infection is phosphorylation of the eukayotic translation initiation factor eIF2\u03b1, resulting in translational arrest and reduction in the global synthesis of viral and cellular proteins 2 . In some cases, viral invasion also induces other host defense responses, including type I interferon (IFN) 3, 4 and autophagy 5 , which in turn affect viral infection of HSV-1.",

            "text": "The important neurovirulence factor \u03b334.5 of HSV-1 provides an excellent example of how viruses have evolved to modulate a multitude of host defenses with a very limited genome size 6 . Viral protein \u03b334.5 of HSV-1 wild type F consists of 263 amino acids, and can be divided into three domains: a 160-aa amino-terminal domain, 10 repeats of 3-aa (Ala-Thr-Pro), and a 73-aa carboxyl-terminal domain 7 . Multiple roles of \u03b334.5 have emerged from the association of \u03b334.5 with various cellular proteins in targeting different host pathways. For instance, \u03b334.5 interacts with TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), suppressing production of type I IFN 8, 9 . \u03b334.5 directly interacts with the mammalian autophagy protein Beclin-1 and antagonizes autophagy 10 . Moreover, HSV-1 has evolved an effective strategy through \u03b334.5 recruiting protein phosphatase PP1\u03b1 to reverse the eIF2\u03b1-mediated translational arrest, to allow for successful viral replication [11] [12] [13] . \u03b334.5 was initially described over two decades ago, but the specific virus-host interactions mediated by this multifunctional protein are still being elucidated.",

We ectopically expressed the wildtype (wt) Flag-tagged NOP53 (residues 1 to 478), truncated NOP53-N4 (residues 250 to 478), or negative control and then infected them with HSV-1/F at the MOI of 0.1. As shown in Figs. 1a and 1b, increase of NOP53 and NOP53-N4 resulted in increases of intracellular viral yields by 14.3 and 8.8 fold, respectively, at 36 h postinfection (h.p.i.), and by 13.6 and 8.9 fold, respectively, at 48 h.p.i., in comparison with the negative control infected with HSV-1/F (Fig. 1a) . Increase of NOP53 and NOP53-N4 resulted in increase of extracellular viral yields by 14.7 and 10.6 fold, respectively, at 36 h.p.i., and by 12.6 and 12.6 fold, respectively, at 48 h.p.i. (Fig. 1b) . We also detected that ectopic expression of the full length NOP53 enhances viral replication, indexed by viral protein HSV-ICP8, while NOP53-N4 appears to enhance viral replication to a level comparable to that achieved with wt NOP53 (Fig. 1c) . These preliminary results indicated that the integrity of the C-terminal region N4 is important for NOP53 in support of viral replication. We then found that small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of NOP53 results in reduction of viral yields by 31.1 and 52.3 fold at 36 and 48 h.p.i., respectively (Fig. 1d) . Western blot results also showed that the level of viral protein HSV-ICP8 is down-regulated (Fig. 1e ). In addition, overexpression or knockdown of NOP53 did not cause measurable decrease in cell viability (Supplementary figure 1) . These results suggest that NOP53 promotes the production of viral particles and increases the level of viral proteins of HSV-1/F in IFN-independent fashion.",

            "text": "Puromycin is an aminoacyl tRNA analog that is incorporated into the nascent chain C-terminus and terminates elongation. It has been used to directly monitor the translation rate of newly synthesized protein when used in minimal amounts 26 . To measure the effect of NOP53 on the translation rate upon HSV-1 infection, HeLa cells were transfected with Flag-tagged NOP53-N4 or negative control and then infected with HSV-1 at MOI of 1, and then subjected to pulse-chase puromycin labeling. In agreement with earlier findings 27 , gradual infection of HSV-1 moderately modulated global protein synthesis (Fig. 2a, lanes 2, 4, 6, 8) . Furthermore, ectopic expression of NOP53 increased the accumulation of HSV-ICP8 (lanes 3, 5, 7, 9) , but synthesis of cellular protein remained unaffected. This result suggests that NOP53 improves the translation of viral mRNA of HSV-1/F. We then examined HSV-1 replication following overexpression or knockdown of NOP53. As shown in Fig. 2b , the ectopic expression of Flag-tagged NOP53 or NOP53-N4 resulted in an increase of viral yields by 86 and 31 fold, respectively, at 36 h.p.i., in comparison with the negative control, and an increase of viral yields by 60 and 42 fold at 48 h.p.i. RT-PCR was used to elucidate the levels of viral mRNA; we detected that ectopic expression of both NOP53 and NOP53-N4 significantly up-regulate the level of viral mRNA (Fig. 2c) . NOP53-N4 also enhanced viral replication to a level comparable to that achieved under enhancement by wt NOP53 in HeLa cells. On the other hand, siRNA-mediated knockdown of NOP53 resulted in reduction of viral yields by 24 and 33 fold at 36 and 48 h.p. i., respectively (Fig. 2d) , and also a reduction in the level of viral mRNA (Fig. 2e) . These results indicate that NOP53 improves the production of viral particles and level of viral proteins of HSV-1/F, without affecting global protein synthesis.",

There are two main regulatory steps that control polypeptide chain initiation: the activity of the Met-tRNA-binding factor eIF2 complex and the formation of the eIF4F mRNA cap-binding complex 28, 29 . The phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 on serine 51 (Ser51) prevents recycling of the trimeric eIF2 complex, resulting in translation initiation attenuation 30, 31 , while the eIF4E controls eIF4F complex formation and cellular translation via phosphorylation on serine 209 (Ser209) 32, 33 . In this study, HeLa cells were transiently transfected with Flag-tagged NOP53-N4 or negative control and then infected with HSV-1 at MOI of 10 for 8, 12, 24, and 36 h. As shown in Fig. 2f , we found that HSV-1 infection significantly enhances the level of phospho-eIF2\u03b1 (p-eIF2\u03b1) and phospho-eIF4E (p-eIF4E) at 8 and 12 h.p.i. (lanes 2, 4), but the phosphorylation levels gradually decreased as the infection progressed. Furthermore, the increase of NOP53-N4 greatly decreased p-eIF2\u03b1 level, especially at 8 and 12 h.p.i. (lanes 3, 5), but did not alter the p-eIF4E level and the accumulation of total eIF2\u03b1 or eIF4E at the indicated times. These results suggest that NOP53 a b 36 regulates the activity of initiator trimeric eIF2 complex, rather than the formation of cap-eIF4F complex, to functionally promote the viral protein synthesis of HSV-1.",

The best-studied antiviral defense targeting viral translation is the dsRNA-dependent PKR 37 . To test whether NOP53 targets PKR for p-eIF2\u03b1 depression, HeLa cells were transiently transfected with Flag-tagged NOP53-N4 or negative control, and then infected with HSV-1/F for 12 and 18 h. As shown in Fig. 3a , ectopic expression of NOP53-N4 resulted in a significant decrease in endogenous p-eIF2\u03b1 of 10 and 5 fold at 12 and 18 h p.i. (lanes 3, 5), respectively, as compared with control cells (lanes 2, 4). The accumulation of PKR and its phosphorylation level, however, was relatively constant. It is inferred that NOP53 attenuation of p-eIF2\u03b1 level is functionally correlated with viral protein \u03b334.5. We also found that the ectopic expression of NOP53-N4 fails to affect the phosphorylation levels of either PKR and eIF2\u03b1 induced by infection with \u03b334.5 deletion mutant virus HSV-1/ \u0394\u03b334.5.

Cell lysates were then analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies directed against phospho-eIF2\u03b1 (p-eIF2\u03b1), eIF2\u03b1, phospho-eIF4E (p-eIF4E), eIF4E, HSV-ICP8, Flag, and actin To further clarify whether NOP53 is responsible for eIF2\u03b1 dephosphorylation, two constructs encoding the wt YFP-tagged eIF2\u03b1 and the phosphorylationincompetent variant eIF2\u03b1-S51A were transiently transfected or co-transfected with Flag-tagged NOP53-N4, followed by mock-infection or HSV-1/F infection. Consistent with previous reports 38 , ectopic expression of eIF2\u03b1 improved p-eIF2\u03b1 level (Fig. 3b , lane 2), while the increase in phosphorylation level remained unaffected when cells were co-transfected with NOP53-N4 (lane 3). There is no evidence supporting the idea that NOP53 directly targets eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation. We discovered that after HSV-1/F infection, the ectopic expression of NOP53-N4 leads to decreased accumulation of p-eIF2\u03b1, coincident with increased viral propagation (lane 5).",

To address whether NOP53 relates functionally with PP1\u03b1, okadaic acid (OA) was used to induce eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation in this study. OA is an inhibitor of the serine/theorine protein phosphatases PP1 and PP2A 40 .

After HSV-1/F infection, NOP53-N4 increase did not relieve p-eIF2\u03b1 level, and no promotion of viral replication was observed (Fig. 3e) . No evidence supports that NOP53 functionally mimics or regulates PP1\u03b1 activity.

In consideration of the relationship between NOP53 redistribution and viral replication priority, N4-T protein was employed in this study. First, HeLa cells were exposed to HSV-1/F in the presence or absence of N4-T, to explore whether N4-T promotes viral proliferation. As shown in Fig. 5a , the viral yields of HSV-1/F at 24, 36, 48, and 72 h.p.i. were 6, 62, 44, and 13 fold higher, respectively, in cells treated with N4-T at a concentration of 20 \u03bcg/ml, than in cultures treated with PBS. We also explored the effect of N4-T on the level of viral protein throughout the infection course, and found significantly up-regulated expression of HSV-ICP8 (Fig. 5b) . We further examined whether N4-T promotes HSV-1 replication via regulation of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation. The results revealed that p-eIF2\u03b1 level is gradually decreased and HSV-ICP8 expression is upregulated, with increasing concentrations of N4-T (Fig. 5c) . N4-T treatment failed, however, to affect the levels of p-eIF2\u03b1 and HSV-ICP8 upon HSV-1/\u0394\u03b334.5 infection (Fig. 5d) . N4-T also had no effect on the p-eIF2\u03b1 level induced by unrelated Newcastle disease virus (NDV) infection, although it up-regulated the expression of viral protein NP (Fig. 5e) . It is possible that N4-T promotes NDV replication by suppressing the activity of IFN-\u03b2. These findings indicate that cytoplasmic NOP53 directly depresses p-eIF2\u03b1 level in the presence of \u03b334.5. Fig. 4 \u03b334.5 induces the cytoplasmic translocation of NOP53. a, b HeLa, Vero, or U2OS cells grown in 4 well slides were mock-infected a or exposed to 10 MOI of HSV-1/F b.

The crucial functional regions of \u03b334.5 that are associated with NOP53 were determined by construction of Flag-tagged \u03b334.5 and a series of variant plasmids, including Nterminus region (residues 1 to 190), C-terminus region (residues 190 to 263), Beclin-1 binding motif deleted mutant (\u039468-87), and site mutation of V 193 E and F 195 L (Fig. 7a) . Specifically, both the V 193 and F 195 sites are required for \u03b334.5 to bind to PP1\u03b1 13 . In the present study, we used GFP-specific antibody to immune-precipitate ectopically-expressed GFP-tagged NOP53-N4, and used Flag-specific antibody in Western blotting to detect whether Flag-tagged \u03b334.5 was present in the immune complex. The result revealed that NOP53-N4 can interact with \u03b334.5 (Fig. 7b) . Furthermore, we found that NOP53-N4 is in the immune complex with \u03b334.5 and its variants; no interaction was observed, however, between NOP53-N4 and the C-terminus region of \u03b334.5 (Fig. 7c) . To summarize, NOP53 interacts directly with \u03b334.5 but does not rely on \u03b334.5 binding to cellular proteins PP1\u03b1, Beclin-1, or eIF2\u03b1.",

Cell lysates prepared 36 h.p.i. were then analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies directed against HSV-ICP8, Flag, NOP53, and actin. f Schematic illustration of the mechanism dephosphorylate eIF2\u03b1. This is the first report of cellular regulatory protein NOP53 being required for efficient viral replication of HSV-1. Understanding this mechanism not only provides important information on the process of viral replication, but will also be useful for developing potential target inhibitors against infection. HSV-1 infection triggers a rapid induction of host innate immune responses. Herpesvirus DNA can be recognized intracellularly by a variety of DNA sensors, with the best documented being the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway, which initiates subsequent type I IFN production 50, 51 . It has recently been reported that RIG-I-mediated STING up-regulation restricts HSV-1 infection 52 . Our previous study revealed that NOP53 targets RNA sensor RIG-I to suppress the activity of IFN\u03b2 for efficient viral replication of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and NDV 21 . It has been reported that HSV-1/ \u0394\u03b334.5 infection produces greater amounts of IFN-\u03b2 than in HSV-1/F-infected cells 53 . We found, however, that the increase of NOP53, in two forms of transient transfection and in vitro expression, was unable to dephosphorylate eIF2\u03b1 and promote viral replication upon HSV-1/\u0394\u03b334.5 infection. In addition, NOP53 promoted HSV-1/F replication in type I IFN-deficient Vero cells. Two major lines of evidence thus support that \u03b334.5 manipulates NOP53 to promote HSV-1 replication mainly by regulating IFNindependent eIF2\u03b1 activity. This improves our understanding of how the viruses manipulate NOP53 for efficient replication via negatively regulating distinct antiviral responses produced by the infected cells.",
