For a virus the key factor is transmission because without it the virus goes to extinction very quickly.

With an animal model, the first question isor should behow good is the model, especially given the old adage that the best model for man is man? The other handicap is time. Pathology and transmission studies take time, include large numbers of variables, while correlations are easier to establish than proof. Molecular analyses of virus replication or virus-host interactions in a tumour cell line are simpler and faster. While fair game 20 years ago, there is more to a viral disease than just the virus.

The specter of a pandemic caused by the socalled swine flu shocked scientists and health officials worldwide and a massive investment was made in purchasing antivirals and developing a vaccine in record time. Fortunately it turned out to be a mild pandemic. Up to then, the general feeling was that the next pandemic virus would emerge from Southeast Asia, so a Central American epicentre foxed everyone. As to timing, if you repeat often enough that a pandemic is around the corner, something I have heard regularly since getting into human virology back in 1980, then one day you'll be right. Human flu pandemics occurred in 1918, 1957, 1968 and 2009 , so number theory alone suggests that the next one is due anytime between 2020 and 2050. This is not to make fun of the virologists who have treated us to a fabulous decade of influenza science; what it does is neatly capture the difficulties in predicting viral emergence of human-adapted strains capable of causing a pandemic (Holmes, 2013) .",

Because these proteins are so important and readily distinguished serologically, viruses are referred to as H1N1, H7N9 and so on.

They can come from poultry, such as H5N1 or H7N7; or where the original source may be birds or waterfowl, e.g. H7N9, the virus can cycle through live poultry markets, as we saw earlier this year in China . All these viruses can be highly pathogenic in humans. The case fatality rate for individuals with symptomatic infection can be as high as 60%. Fortunately these infections rarely result in transmission from humans to other humans, although short transmission chains involving a handful of individuals have been reported (Zaman et al, 2011; Qi et al, 2013) . This apparent lack of humanto-human transmission among avian influenza viruses is strongly influenced by the haemagglutinin, which cannot bind the a-2,6 linked sialylated glycan receptors in the mammalian upper respiratory tract, while pathology results from the infection of cells bearing a-2,3 linked sialylated glycans in the lower tract. This follows from the fact that avian haemagglutinins naturally use the a-2,3 linked sialylated glycan as receptors. Accordingly, adaptation to mammals requires mutations allowing the virus to bind the mammalian sugar. Other mutations may be necessary to permit avian influenza viruses to grow efficiently, but for simplicity we will focus on the haemagglutinin.",

Their intrinsic mutation rates are approximately one mutation per round of replication, which is close to the maximum possible. Hence the possibility is real that over time, one day, a novel avian influenza A virus could mutate into a robust humantransmissible virus sparking a pandemic. As the antigenic surface of a novel virus such as H7N9 would be totally new, there would be no pre-existing immunity in the human population to blunt virus replication.

Metagenomic studies are identifying bewildering numbers of previously unidentified viruses on human skin and elsewhere. If non-human mammalian, avian and insect-borne viruses alone are factored in as springboards to humans, the number that could possibly cross over is essentially limitless.

The recent H7N9 influenza virus is believed to be a reassortant of four bird, waterfowl or chicken viruses, while a recent H5N2 influenza virus from Vietnam was derived from three parents (Li et al, 2013; Nishi et al, 2013) . Paying particular attention to RNA viruses with the potential to cause human respiratory disease makes good sense because more than half of humanity is now urban, although the history of the spread of HIV/AIDS mustn't be forgotten. Testing fixed mutations spotted in field isolates of influenza virusesthose found at reasonably high frequencies that distinguish them from the general mutational backgroundisn't a problem. These mutations can be rapidly introduced into a reference strain or the local strain if the genetic background is thought to be an issue and aerosol transmission tested. Such studies are real world and have the merit of producing tangible information that public health officials can assimilate. Taken together, all the evidence indicates that proponents of GOF research have greatly overstated the benefits while the risks remain. Scientists are generally upbeat about their work yet notoriously underestimate risk (Van Noorden, 2013). Safety experts know full well that no system is perfect, a truism that takes us back to high school physics classes. So what are the risks? Escape from a highcontainment facility or infection of a lab worker leading to community spread are among the more prosaic (Lipsitch & Bloom, 2012) . And then there's insider riskas witnessed in the anthrax attacks which no one wants to talk about (Culp, 2013) . While the probability of an accidental or deliberate release of a human-transmissible virus from a single lab is arguably small, but not zero (Henkel et al, 2012) , the more groups performing GOF virology, the greater the overall risk. In the nuclear area all efforts are concentrated on reducing the proliferation of labs processing and handling fissile material.",

This study is particularly pertinent as it shows that a virus of lower pathogenicity but higher transmissibility has greater impact on humanity than a highly pathogenic, but poorly transmissible virus. So any experiment that makes H5N1 or H7N9 more transmissible between ferrets, and presumably humans, even at the loss of some pathogenicity, is making the world a more dangerous place than it presently is with sporadic outbreaks of H5N1 and H7N9 influenza. In this respect it is staggering that, two years into the biggest controversy in virology in decades, no thorough risk analysis has been conducted. Simply staggering.",
