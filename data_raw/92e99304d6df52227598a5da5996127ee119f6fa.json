In quantitative analysis, the eight components showed good regression (R > 0.9997) within test ranges, and the recovery method ranged from 99.5% to 103.0%. The UPLC fingerprints of the Radix Isatidis samples were compared by performing chemometric procedures, including similarity analysis, hierarchical clustering analysis, and principal component analysis. The chemometric procedures classified Radix Isatidis and its finished products such that all samples could be successfully grouped according to crude herbs, prepared slices, and adulterant Baphicacanthis cusiae Rhizoma et Radix. The combination of quantitative and chromatographic fingerprint analysis can be used for the quality assessment of Radix Isatidis and its finished products.",

The same samples showed similarities (crude herbs: 0.752 to 0.820; prepared slices: 0.933 to 0.991). The same samples had similar constituents with the slight difference resulting from the environmental conditions and the planting techniques. However, the crude herbs and the prepared slices were significantly different because of the production process and the contents of main bioactive constituents. The biotransformation, the glucosinolate contents, and the degradation products have the most important influence on the similarities. The HCA results clearly showed that the samples were appropriately divided into two main clusters related to the Radix Isatidis type (Figure 4 ). Cluster-I was S01 to S08, which were the prepared slices of Radix Isatidis, whereas Cluster-II was S09 to S15, which were the crude herb samples.

The samples from different locations of the same type (crude herbs or prepared slices) were still clustered into one group, and the eight bioactive components were mostly close, which indicates the similarity of internal quality of the samples in the same type. Furthermore, eight marker constituents were found to be specific variables, which could provide the most discrimination and quality control of Radix Isatidis and its finished products by quantitative analysis. The PCA loading plot identified the greatest impact factor of characteristic constituents to the classification. In addition, this chromatographic method was efficient and rapid in distinguishing Radix Isatidis from other species such as NBLG.",
