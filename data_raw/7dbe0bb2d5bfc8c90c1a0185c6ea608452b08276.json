Beak trimming is a common practice to control these problems, but in Finland beak trimming is prohibited. Finnish egg producers have decades-long experience of egg production with intact-beaked hens. This experience, and their management of pecking-related problems, could benefit producers in other countries. The online questionnaire aimed to gather information about Finnish farmers' attitudes towards beak trimming, their estimation of the seriousness of pecking problems in their laying hen flocks, common risk factors and the best practices to prevent attendant problems. The questionnaire received 35 responses. Finnish egg producers appeared strongly to support a policy of not trimming beaks. Motivation against beak trimming was explained by considering it to be unnecessary and unethical. Most respondents did not regard pecking-related problems as being very severe in their flocks. Lighting, feeding and flock management problems represented the most important risk factors regarding pecking problems. Generally, the same topics were highlighted as being the most important intervention measures for managing an on-going pecking problem. The study indicates that it is possible to incorporate a non-beak-trimming policy as a component of sustainable egg production.",

These problems are often controlled by beak trimming, which in Finland is prohibited. An online questionnaire aimed to collect information from farmers about pecking-related problems in Finnish laying hen flocks, important risk factors and the best experiences to prevent the problems. Additionally, the farmers' attitudes towards beak trimming were examined. We received 35 responses, which represents about 13% of all Finnish laying hen farms with \u2265300 laying hens. The majority of respondents stated that a maximum of 5-7% incidence of feather pecking or 1-2% incidence of cannibalism would be tolerable. The majority of respondents (74%) expressed that they would definitely not use beak-trimmed hens. Only two respondents indicated that they would probably use beak-trimmed hens were the practice permitted. Among risk factors, light intensity earned the highest mean (6.3), on a scale from 1 (not important) to 7 (extremely important). Other important problems included those that occurred during rearing, feeding, flock management and problems with drinking water equipment (mean 5.9, each). The most important intervention measures included optimal lighting and feeding, flock management, and removing the pecker and victim. Concluding, Finnish farmers had strong negative attitudes towards beak trimming. The study underlines the importance of flock management, especially lighting and feeding, in preventing pecking problems and indicates that it is possible to incorporate a non-beak-trimming policy into sustainable egg production.",

The procedure appears to be efficient, because pecking-related problems are more common, and feather condition is worse among birds with intact beaks compared with beak-trimmed birds [7, 19, 29, 30] . Nonetheless, these misbehaviours also exist in beak-trimmed flocks [7, 8, 15, 24] and, thus, beak trimming fails to completely prevent pecking-related problems. Furthermore, beak trimming has negative consequences on the natural behaviour of the bird: beak-trimmed hens exhibit less ground pecking [29] and preening [31] , and the procedure is painful [32] . Neuroma formation on the tip of the trimmed beak can also lead to long-term pain [32] . The cause of pecking problems is not the beak, as such: feather pecking and cannibalism arise due to various stressors [1, 9] . Beak trimming, therefore, does not solve the underlying problem but only addresses the consequence. Therefore, raising intact-beaked hens is an integral part of sustainable egg production.",

First, we gathered general information about the farms, the production system and the birds. The next topic included questions on farmer attitudes towards beak trimming, and farmers' estimation about the seriousness of existing pecking problems, as well as the effect of pecking-related problems on production performance. The seriousness of pecking-related problems was assessed on a scale from 1 (not serious) to 7 (extremely serious). The attitude towards beak trimming was assessed using a scale from 1 ([I would] most definitely not) to 7 ([I would] most probably) use beak-trimmed hens if beak trimming were legal. Many of the questions focused on the farmers' opinions of the importance of a range of risk factors. These were selected based on the literature and practical experience, as being known to influence pecking problems, and included breed, production system, the origin of the birds and rearing period, housing conditions and bird management, perches, nests, litter, feeding, unexpected problems, and health-related issues. In addition, we clarified opinions on optimal age of pullets for transportation, detailed information about suitable lamps and litter, problems with perches and nests, and preferable time spent on observing birds with open-answer questions. The last topic investigated the farmers' estimates, based on practical experience, of the most effective preventive measures (additional enrichment, such as straw bales, hanging objects and pecking stones) and means available to manage on-going pecking problems (i.e., intervention, such as removal of the pecker or victim from the flock). All the estimations used a scale from 1 (not important) to 7 (extremely important). Additionally, at the end of the questionnaire, the respondents were asked to, in their own words, and in order of importance, list the five most important measures, to prevent pecking problems and manage on-going problems (intervention measures). To rate all mentioned factors, the most important factor received five points, and the least important factor one point. For analyses, all points were summed to obtain total points given to each factor. Finally, the respondents were able to present free opinions concerning all topics.",

The number of farms represents about 13% of 270 Finnish laying hen farms with \u2265300 laying hens, and 15% of the farms that were estimated to have been reached by the questionnaire. In organic farms, the average flock size was 2700 \u00b1 150 hens (median 3000 hens, 1100-3000 hens), and in conventional production 17400 \u00b1 1600 hens (median 16,100 hens, 1400-49,000 hens). The most common flock size was 3000 hens (nine houses, 16%). The majority of respondents (31, 88%) represented solely egg producing farms, and the remaining four farms had pullet rearing in addition to egg production. According to current statistics [34] , in Finland, nearly half of laying hen flocks (47%) consist of 10,000-< 30,000 birds, and 38% of the flocks are larger. The maximum legal size of an organic laying hen flock is 3000 birds [35] . We thus assume that the respondent farms represent Finnish egg producing farms reasonably well. Due to the low response rate, the results should be considered with some reservation. The low response rate may reflect attitudes of Finnish farmers towards pecking problems: Pecking-related problems are not considered very important.

Altogether 14 respondents estimated the differences between production systems with respect to pecking problems. In these responses, enriched cages were most often (12 responses) considered to be the easiest.

However, the statistics show a trend of decreasing production in enriched cages and increasing production in aviary systems [36] . Currently, organic production covers only about 5% of all egg production [34] and represent 15% of egg producing farms because these farms are generally smaller compared with the other production systems [36] . To date, free-range production is practiced in only 8% of egg-producing farms [36] . In the questionnaire responses, the proportion of organic production appears to be slightly overrepresented. Nonetheless, we can assume that the respondent farms represent the Finnish situation reasonably well.",

Possibly, due to minimal experience, the respondents did not indicate that free-range or organic systems represented particularly difficult systems.

However, systems with outdoor range are also considered as to reduce the risk for pecking, and pecking-related problems decrease along with increased outside range usage [7, 15, 24, 37] . On the other hand, in many countries, the situation in relation to pecking problems may differ considerably between organic and conventional production because beak trimming is not as common a practice in organic egg production as it is in conventional production [8] . Severe feather pecking appears more regularly among non-beak-trimmed birds [1, 7] resulting in worse plumage condition [7, 29, 30] . In Finland, all egg production is with hens with intact beaks, consequently equalizing the production systems from that perspective.",

Although the respondents had long experience of egg production, not many had been producing eggs before the ban. Yet, on many farms, egg production may have been practised before the current farmer, and the experience of the former farmer could have been transferred to the current farmer. This assumption is supported by a comment of a farmer, with 18 years of experience of conventional egg production: \"There have been no disadvantages of the non-beak-trimming policy.

It might be that at around peak production the problems typically start, and the starting point requires more effort to get the situation under control. Even if the problem continues thereafter, the farmers may not consider it to be such a severe problem any longer. The stress caused by transport from the rearing farm to the laying farm can initiate cannibalistic pecks, which might be one reason for the perceived risky stage being early in production [39] .

Despite the given definitions for feather pecking and cannibalism, the estimation of individual respondents probably varied considerably. Indeed, in free comments, one respondent admitted having difficulties identifying the connection between feather cover condition and pecking problems. Farmers may consider poor feather cover in older hens as a normal course of a hen's life without realizing that it might be due to feather pecking. Surely, feather pecking is not the only factor affecting feather condition towards the end of production period, but it most probably is partly responsible for the situation. Also, small skin lesions caused by cannibalistic pecking could have remained undetected by farmers because this would have required picking up hens for thorough investigation. We did not ask or advise farmers to perform such a detailed examination and, most probably, the estimation was thus based on an approximate scanning during routine flock checking.",

An earlier study reporting farmers' estimation in the UK informed that 57% of the flocks showed feather pecking behaviour and 47% of the farmers described feather pecking to be a normal phenomenon in their laying hen flocks [15] . In studies performed in commercial conditions, severe feather pecking is typically seen by researchers in 55-86% of the hens [7, 8] and cannibalism in 21-37% [8] . A Dutch study reported that in nearly half of the examined flocks over 10% of the hens showed severe feather damage [14] .",

Changing diets more often over the rearing period [16] , or during laying [15] , increases the likelihood of feather pecking during the production period. Among Finnish farmers, however, changing diets got a moderately low mean score (4.9) compared with other feeding-related issues. We cannot make further conclusions about that matter because we did not ask how many times the diet was changed on the responding farms. Feed form and composition also impact feather-pecking behaviour in laying hens. Mash feeding reduces feather pecking, probably because it increases time spent eating and encourages foraging behaviour better than when feed is in a pelleted form [17, 18] . Diets with higher fibre content are associated with lower mortality resulting from cannibalism [19] .",

An aviary system seems to be less risky compared with a floor system, probably because the multiple tiers in aviary systems offer more possibilities for pecked birds to escape the peckers [14] . In a free-range system, feather pecking is less frequent, and plumage condition appears better, whereas cannibalism, in form of vent pecking, occurs more commonly [42] .

In Finland, modern hen houses are typically equipped with heating and ventilation systems [44] that better ensure uniform temperature.

The same survey also established a connection between parasites and pecking problems [15] that was also considered an important risk factor in the current study (mean for ectoparasites 5.4 and for endoparasites 5.2). Immune responses induced by vaccinations or infections are related to increased feather pecking [46] . In most countries, laying hens are heavily vaccinated. However, the poultry disease situation in Finland remains relatively good [47] and, therefore, also the vaccination programme is modest compared with those in most European countries. For example, in Finland, laying hens are not vaccinated against IB or Newcastle disease. We could argue that the good health situation, and consequent minimal vaccination programme, lowers the risk for pecking problems in Finnish circumstances.",

Signs of feather or skin damage in transported pullets were, however, only seldom (20, 57% of the responses) or never (15, 43% responses) observed.

Chicks at a young age can express all manner of pecking behaviour, including severe feather pecking [5, 14, 16] and cannibalism [4] . If the birds have adopted a feather-pecking habit during rearing, the flock is at a higher risk of feather pecking during the laying period [4, 5, 14, 16, 41] , making it important to prevent pecking problems already at a young age. Enriching the rearing environment with litter material, to allow foraging, reduces pecking problems during the laying period [4, 14, 16, 23, 28] . Furthermore, offering a perching opportunity at a young age, before four weeks, reduces the risk of vent pecking [14, 28] .",

Foraging and scratching bedding depend on age and available material; young chicks prefer wood shavings while, over time, birds start to express more interest towards sand [51] . Litter is of little value in enriched cages, compared with floor systems, and that most likely explains the low mean in this study. However, also in enriched cages, foraging possibility improves plumage condition [52] . Green et al. (2000) [15] observed a higher risk for feather pecking when friable litter was absent at the end of the production period. The study of de Jong et al.

The nest design may affect feather pecking. A questionnaire among egg producers in the UK suggested that offering communal nests for hens increases the likelihood of feather pecking [15] .

In free comments, continuously choosing the same breed was often rationalized with the permanent relationship with the rearing farm and with good experience of the breed over the years.

Managing housing conditions was also emphasized in the UK survey. However, although beak trimming was mentioned as one option [15] , beak trimming does not completely prevent pecking-related problems [7, 8, 15, 24] . Furthermore, feather pecking and cannibalism can arise in the presence of various stressors, including suboptimal housing conditions [1, 9] , and, thus, may be, in a sense, a hen's way of indicating inadequacies. Therefore, beak trimming does not solve the underlying problem but only addresses the consequence. Overall, among the respondents, additional enrichment was of low value in preventing pecking problems (Table 5) . Only for straw bales was a mean of > 4 reached. One reason could be that over half of the farmers had no experience of such enrichment, probably because most hens were kept in enriched cages. Straw bales were not used in 63% farms, 74% had no experience of pecking stones, and 63% had not used hanging strings, and 54% other types of hanging object, as enrichment. Straw bales were more important among floor houses as compared with houses equipped with enriched cages accommodating >20 hens (median for floor houses 3.5, range 0-7, and for enriched cages 0, range 0-3; p = 0.002, Kruskal-Wallis test). This finding is understandable because it would be impossible, or at least very impractical, to use straw bales in cages. Additionally, the importance of hanging objects differed between housing types (p = 0.032), but statistically significant differences were absent in a pairwise comparison.",

A survey observing commercial farms over two consecutive flocks reported less severe feather pecking in the latter flock due to increased enrichment [24] . However, in addition to enrichment, the close follow-up of the farms by the researchers, in the earlier study, could have improved the management of housing conditions and, thus, led to decreased pecking problems. The low valuation of enrichment among Finnish egg producers in the current survey does not necessarily mean that they do not appreciate offering a furnished environment to birds but that, according to their experience, the foundation must be properly arranged in the first case, and enrichment should represent a secondary measure only.

The study also reveals that the main focus should be on managing housing conditions, especially lighting, and ensuring optimal feeding when preventing or handling an existing pecking-related problem. In conclusion, the study indicates that it is possible to incorporate a non-beak-trimming policy as part of sustainable egg production.",
