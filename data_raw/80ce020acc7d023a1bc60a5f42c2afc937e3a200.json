Results: Of 177 patients included in this retrospective study, 73% were positive for at least one virus. Respiratory syncytial virus (36.6%) and human rhinovirus (24%) were most frequently detected. Patients in whom a respiratory virus or Mycoplasma pneumoniae was detected, were younger (6 versus 24 months; p < 0.001) and more often hospitalized (116 versus 34; p = 0.001) than patients in whom no respiratory pathogen was detected. Also they were more likely to present with feeding problems, dyspnea, rhinorrhea and wheezing (all p < 0.05) than patients without a respiratory pathogen. In the majority of cases, clinicians did not change their antibiotic management after detecting a viral respiratory pathogen. No difference in mean Ct value was found between patients with one respiratory pathogen and those with >1 respiratory pathogen (30.5 versus 31.2; p = 0.573). Conclusion: Routine testing of common respiratory pathogens could lead to a better understanding of their role in disease in children with respiratory symptoms.",

The presence of a virus, particularly HRV, has to be interpreted carefully as viral RNA could be detected in nasal mucus for up to 5-6 weeks after infection and respiratory viruses are also detected in asymptomatic children [23, 24] .

In this study, 66.6% of the HRV positive patients HRV was co-detected with another virus compared to 42% of the RSV cases. In addition, most samples with more than 1 virus, HRV and RSV were detected together, in 12 (25.5%) of the 47 samples, respectively. Similar to our data, Aberle et al. [17] found HRV and RSV together in 35.9% of the dual infections and Advani et al. [24] found that in 73% of the coinfections HRV was involved. On the other hand, Greer et al. [25] found HRV in a much lower co-detection rate of 23.6%. Some studies have demonstrated that multiple viral pathogens cause more severe disease [1, 17] , whereas others did not find any difference in disease severity between the detection of a single and multiple respiratory viruses in respiratory samples, not even with the combination of RSV and HRV [16, 19, 26] . The present findings support the latter conclusion. We found that patients with multiple respiratory viruses even had a shorter duration of hospitalization and were more likely to have non-respiratory symptoms as diarrhea, vomiting and feeding problems. This is similar to the observation of a shorter duration of hospitalization in patients with RSV/HRV dual infections compared to those with a single infection with RSV by others [19, 27] . This suggests that HRV may have a potential protective effect on disease severity. This may be explained by the possible protection of the induced immune response trigged by viral infection from infection with a second virus as postulated by Greer et al. [25] where HRV could protect its host from infection by other viruses.",

Unfortunately, as shown by the present study this is not the real life clinical practice as only in 40% the antibiotic treatment was ceased. The present findings confirm previous reports that have shown that detection of a viral respiratory pathogen in a large part of the pediatric patients did not influence a change in antibiotic management of individual patients [15, 28] . This may be attributed to the young age of the children, severity of clinical symptoms and the general attitude of clinicians to complete antibiotic treatment in children due to concern about bacterial co-infections and development of antibiotic resistance. Identification of viral pathogens can be of importance for both individual patient management and hospital infection control policy. Rapid diagnosis could contribute to a significant reduction in unnecessary laboratory tests and costly imaging, especially in young children, thereby decreasing diagnostic costs. Bonner et al. [29] demonstrated this together with a decreased length of time to discharge in a study were the impact of a rapid influenza test result was determined on patient management. Rapid and sensitive diagnosis of viral infections is also thought to be important to reduce nosocomial transmission as all patients infected with a respiratory virus need to be isolated (contact or droplet precautions). All these data suggest that routine molecular testing for respiratory viral pathogens could be useful to decrease the duration of hospitalization and reduce nosocomial infections.",
