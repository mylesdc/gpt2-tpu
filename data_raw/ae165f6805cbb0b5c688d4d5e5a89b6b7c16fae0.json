            "text": "Lawsonia intracellularis, an obligate intracellular bacterium, is an important enteric pathogen in pig herds and horse farms worldwide. The hallmark feature of L. intracellularis infection is the proliferation of epithelial cells in intestinal crypts. A major limitation to the study of L. intracellularis infection is the lack of an in vitro model that reproduces the changes observed in proliferative enteropathy. Here we investigated the suitability of mouse enteroids as a model to study L. intracellularis infection. Mouse enteroids were microinjected with L. intracellularis, filter-sterilized L. intracellularis culture supernatant, or sterile cell culture media (DMEM). L. intracellularis antigen was detected in mouse enteroids by immunohistochemistry and was located mostly in the basal region of the epithelium. There was no differential growth of enteroids among treatment groups, and cellular proliferation was not increased in L. intracellularis-infected enteroids in relation to non-infected enteroids based on immunofluorescence staining. L. intracellularis infection did not induce changes in gene expression of Ki-67 (proliferation marker), Sox9 (marker for transit amplifying cells) and Muc2 (marker for goblet cells). These results indicate that although L. intracellularis antigen is detectable in mouse enteroids, indicating susceptibility to infection, mouse enteroids fail to replicate the cellular proliferation and gene expression changes observed in proliferative enteropathy. Nevertheless, we have successfully demonstrated that mouse enteroids can be used to model days-long intracellular pathogen infection, serving as potential models for the study of other pathogens of interest in veterinary medicine.",

The lack of an in vitro model that represents the in vivo progression of PE has limited advancement in knowledge of the pathogenesis mechanisms utilized by L. intracellularis. Hence, identification of new alternatives for control and prevention of PE has been difficult, and pig producers and horse owners have been relying on available commercial vaccines (whole cell vaccines) and antimicrobials to prevent and control PE [7] [8] [9] [10] . The costs associated with producing whole cell vaccines is reflected on the commercial price of the vaccines, hampering the access to some producers to the commercial vaccines, and, therefore preventing PE. In addition, the use of antimicrobials as growth promoters in swine production has raised concerns about the selection of antibiotic-resistant organisms in treated herds [11] .

Enteroids, small intestinal organoids, for instance, possess not only enterocytes, but also enteroendocrine cells, transit amplifying cells, goblet cells and stem cells. All these cells form structures with cell distributions that are similar to crypts and villi found in the small intestine, and possess a lumen where cell debris and secretion are shed continuously [17] .

Cells were cultured in Dulbeco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Gibco ThermoFisher, Waltahm, MA, USA) with 7% fetal bovine serum (FBS; heat inactivated, Corning \u2122 35011CV, Corning, NY, USA). McCoy cells at 30% confluency were infected with about 10 7 L. intracellularis and incubated at 37 \u00b0C under a controlled microaerophilic atmosphere created with a mixture of gas containing 10% hydrogen, 10% carbon dioxide, and 80% nitrogen [30] . Seven days after infection, cell monolayers were mechanically lysed by passage through a 23-gauge needle coupled to a syringe after immersion in sterile 0.1% potassium chloride and then centrifuged at 200 \u00d7 g to separate cell debris from L. intracellularis organisms. The pellets were discarded and the remaining supernatant was then filtered through 0.80 \u00b5m sterile filters (Millipore Sigma, Burlington, MA, USA) to remove any remaining McCoy cells and nuclei. After a final centrifugation at 8000 \u00d7 g at 4 \u00b0C the bacterial pellet was either used to re-infect McCoy cells, or to prepare the inoculum suspended in approximately 500 \u00b5L of its own supernatant and used as inoculum.",

Enteroids were then washed in PBS, centrifuged at 200 \u00d7 g for 2 min, suspended in Histogel (ThermoFischer, USA) and placed into a biopsy mold. Histogel blocks were inserted into a cassette and maintained in 70% alcohol until they were processed for histological evaluation. Four-micrometer sections were placed onto glass slides and used for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and immunohistochemistry [32] . Although L. intracellularis antigen was detected by IHC in the infected enteroids by this method (Figure 1 ), we opted to employ the microinjection approach described below to facilitate contact of L. intracellularis with the cellular apical membrane in an effort to improve the level of infection.",

Although they provide valuable information, these models are limited by their inability to represent the tissue organization observed in vivo since most of the single cell systems are either cancer-derived or transformed immortalized cell lines [19, 34] . These limitations make it difficult to assess the proliferative effects of L. intracellularis infection [6] . The mechanism by which L. intracellularis causes proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells remains unclear. Recently, the effects of L. intracellularis infection on the proliferation of monocultures of non-intestinal, non-epithelial cells, as well as intestinal epithelial cells were investigated under various culture conditions [6] and the findings supported previous observations that cell monocultures infected with L. intracellularis do not accurately represent proliferation observed in lesions in the intestine of affected animals. In vivo, L. intracellularis accesses the cell cytoplasm via the apical membrane and the organisms are observed in the cytoplasm throughout the course of PE. L. intracellularis is more frequently observed in crypt cells than cells of the villus [16, 35, 36] . Therefore, we hypothesized that enteroids would be a suitable model to further investigate L. intracellularis pathogenesis in vitro by providing polarized epithelial cell culture with all the crypt and villus epithelial cell types found in the mammalian intestine and similar cell exchange ratio to the in vivo intestine [37] .",

Human enteroids can be obtained by culture of intestinal crypts isolated from biopsies. Mouse enteroids are more widely used in research as the ethical and biosafety regulations for human enteroids are more restrictive. Additionally, mouse intestinal physiology is well-characterized and molecular tools to study intestinal cell proliferation and differentiation are available. The presence of L. intracellularis DNA has been detected in feces of mice trapped in pig farms and in the surroundings of horse farms [41, 42] , suggesting that mice are susceptible to infection. Furthermore, mice experimentally infected with L. intracellularis develop intestinal lesions that resemble lesions in affected pigs and horses, although the lesions in mice are less extensive, less severe and mostly localized in the large intestine when compared to the lesions in pigs and horses [42] [43] [44] . In addition, L. intracellularis has been successfully propagated in vitro using McCoy mouse fibroblast cells [6, 30, 45] . Based on this knowledge, we hypothesized that mouse enteroids may serve as a feasible model to investigate the progression of L. intracellularis infection and the mechanisms involved during cell proliferation.",

            "text": "Mouse enteroids in the tridimensional culture conditions, as spheres composed of polarized epithelium, have their cellular apical side oriented to the center of the enteroid. Hence, L. intracellularis infection in this study was performed by microinjecting the bacterial suspension directly into the lumen of the enteroid. Microinjection is a technique that has inherent limitations in controlling the bacterial inoculum, i.e., the exact number of bacteria each enteroid was exposed to. Although we plated enteroids to obtain an average of 10 enteroids per well, the actual number of enteroids per well and their size at the time of injection was found to be variable. These technical limitations may have contributed to the high variability observed in our results and constitute one of the limitations of using tridimensional enteroids as models for the study of luminal pathogens. Others have used mouse enteroids [20, 21] and human enteroids [22, 23] to study bacterial pathogenesis using microinjection. However, none of these studies evaluated infection times longer than 20 h [22, 23] . Because of the nature of L. intracellularis infection, longer durations, i.e., several days, are needed to observe the expected changes. To our knowledge, this is the first enteroid infection experiment reporting successful bacterial infection of enteroids for up to 7 dpi. Whether the length of the infection times had a significant effect on the number of bacteria present and variability on the evaluated parameters remains to be defined. One of the most intriguing findings in the present experiment was the unexpected location of L. intracellularis in the infected enteroids. While L. intracellularis antigen was observed at all time points tested (1, 3 and 7 dpi), the antigen was mostly observed localized in the extracellular space proximal to the basal region of the epithelium of the mouse enteroids. In vivo, L. intracellularis organisms are consistently observed on the apical side of the cytoplasm at similar infection time points to those used in this study [16, 36] . A possible explanation for this difference in localization is that, in contrast to conditions in vivo, nutrients necessary for enteroid growth and maintenance are placed over the Matrigel, in a region that corresponds to the basal lamina in vivo and not directly in the enteroid lumen. We speculate that the gradient of nutrients on the exterior of the enteroid could be causing the L. intracellularis to move towards the nutrients to support their growth. It is also possible that conditions of the enteroid culture environment could result in less permissible conditions for L. intracellularis closer to the lumen. Another possibility is that the fibroblasts and immune cells in the basal region of the intestinal epithelium in vivo may have a regulatory effect on L. intracellularis traffic in the intestine, and the lack of those cells in the mouse enteroid culture would modify L. intracellularis traffic in vitro.",

            "text": "Immunohistochemistry for L. intracellularis is considered the gold standard method for diagnosis of proliferative enteropathy [32, 46] . In the present study, we used immunohistochemistry to verify whether the mouse enteroids, microinjected with L. intracellularis suspension (~10 6 L. intracellularis organisms/mL), were infected and to visually demonstrate the level of infection in these microinjected enteroids. Our results were not only surprising in regards to the localization of L. intracellularis antigen, as discussed before, but also in regards to the amount and morphology of the stained antigen. Generally, L. intracellularis antigen stained by immunohistochemistry is observed as small bacilli in the cytoplasm of cell cultures [5, 47, 48] and in the apical cytoplasm of intestinal epithelial cells of naturally and experimentally-infected pigs. In the present study, instead of observing similar morphology of L. intracellularis antigen, we observed mostly the antigen as a \"bundle\" accumulated on the basal region of the enteroid cells. Nevertheless, occasional well-shaped L. intracellularis antigens were observed in the cytoplasm of some enteroid cells ( Figure 2D ), which is an indication that after the microinjection in the lumen of the enteroid, L. intracellularis organisms gained entrance into the cell cytoplasm. The events involving the changes in the morphology of the antigen and its final location in the basal side of enteroid cells remains unclear and may deserve more investigation. The homeostasis of the intestinal epithelium involves various signaling pathways of which canonical Wnt signaling is responsible for maintaining a balance between the pool of undifferentiated cells with proliferation capacity, named transit amplifying cells, and differentiated cells [33, 49] . In vitro, when enteroids are cultured in the presence of Wnt3a in the media, the transit amplifying cells stay undifferentiated for a longer period of time in relation to in vivo conditions [17] , resulting in enteroids in a pro-proliferative state. In the present study, one of the main objectives was to verify the effects of L. intracellularis on cell proliferation, therefore we removed Wnt3a from the culture media 3 days before microinjection and during the experiment to allow the epithelial cells to differentiate, and better reproduce the proportion of proliferative cells of the normal intestinal epithelium. However, we failed to detect increased proliferation in L. intracellularisinfected enteroids by RT-qPCR or immunofluorescence. It is possible that the removal of Wnt3a 3 days before microinjection was not sufficient to reduce proliferation to a level where we could detect changes induced by L. intracellularis. Another possible explanation for this lack of difference in proliferation between treatment groups was the small amount of L. intracellularis delivered to the enteroid lumen, thus requiring a longer time for the bacteria to replicate in numbers to produce a detectable change in proliferation markers. The low amount of antigen detected in the microinjected enteroids indicate that L. intracellularis did not encounter an ideal environment for propagation as it does in McCoy cells and in the intestines of mice and other rodents [6, 30, 41, 43, 50] . The infection efficacy of enteroids derived from the intestines of more L. intracellularis susceptible species, such as pigs and horses, would help to confirm this hypothesis.",

Secretory activity of enteroids has been demonstrated by swollen enteroids as a result of accumulation of luminal secretions after stimulation with forskolin [51] . In the present study, we expected to observe increased enteroid areas of infected enteroids that could be due to increased numbers of cells (proliferation) or secretory activity. In contrary to our expectations, we observed an increased volume from 1 dpi to 3 dpi on the SN group without changes in proliferation, suggesting the possibility of a secreted product with capacity to induce intestinal secretion. Further confirmation of this phenomenon is required.",

Likewise, little is known about mouse enteroids maintained with a pathogenic enteric bacterium for a period longer than 24 h [20, 21] . More information is needed to determine if long-term infection of enteroids mirrors the dynamics of epithelium in vivo in terms of secretion, differentiation and apoptosis observed in chronic enteric diseases. Finally, yet importantly, although we were able to demonstrate infection of mouse enteroids, we did not observe the changes associated with L. intracellularis infection that have been noted in vivo in more susceptible species. Testing L. intracellularis infection in enteroids from other more susceptible species will provide further insight to species susceptibility to pathogenesis.
