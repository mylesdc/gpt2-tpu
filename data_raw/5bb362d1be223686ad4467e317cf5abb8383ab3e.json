For comparison, we also performed NPH and GE qPCR analyses in 167 healthy community controls. Final fever diagnoses were retrospectively established based on all clinical and laboratory data.

Overall, 57% (387/677) had IMCI-pneumonia, but only 12% (42/342) had CXR-confirmed pneumonia. Two patients were positive for Plasmodium falciparum. Respiratory syncytial virus (24.5%), influenza A/B (22.3%), rhinovirus (10.5%) and group-A streptococci (6.4%), CXR-confirmed pneumonia (6.2%), Shigella (4.3%) were the most common viral and bacterial fever diagnoses, respectively. Blood-PCR conducted in a sub-group of patients (n = 83) without defined fever diagnosis was negative for rickettsiae, chikungunya, dengue, Rift Valley fever and West Nile viruses. Antibiotics were prescribed to 500 (74%) patients, but only 152 (22%) had an infection retrospectively considered to require antibiotics. Clinical outcome was generally good. However, two children died. Only 68 (11%) patients remained febrile on day 3 and three of them had verified fever on day 14. An additional 29 (4.5%) children had fever relapse on day 14.

However, some agents did not qualify as causal aetiologies (e.g. pneumococci by NPH-qPCR), and 15% of the patients could not be assigned a final diagnosis. The results, with multiple pathogens being detected in a large proportion of specimens from both patients and controls, underline the complexity of childhood infections.

            "text": "A strength of our study is that, based on all clinical and microbiology data, we retrospectively assigned individual final patient diagnoses, which allowed assessment of whether antibiotics were prescribed to those presumed to benefit from treatment. IMCI management has previously been shown to reduce inappropriate antibiotic prescription in comparison with standard fever case management [19] and a majority of the antibiotic-requiring infections in our study were indeed treated with antibiotics. Still, IMCI management resulted in substantial over-prescription of antibiotics in comparison with the final fever diagnoses retrieved based on all available clinical and laboratory data and their corresponding antibiotic requirement. Thus, among the 57% patients fulfilling the IMCI-pneumonia classification, only 12% had CXR-confirmed pneumonia. Similar results have been reported by others in both hospitalized children [20, 21] , and in non-severe IMCI-pneumonias [22] , indicating that IMCI-pneumonia classification, based on presence of cough and rapid breathing has a low precision to identify lower antibiotic requiring respiratory tract infections. IMCI-pneumonia classification was the largest contributor to presumed unnecessary antibiotic prescription in our study. In a multiple logistic regression analysis, CRP was the only positive predictor of CXR-confirmed pneumonia. However, approximately 50% with CXR-confirmed pneumonia in our study had CRP <80 mg/L and a viral pathogen detected by NPH-qPCR, suggesting that some of the CXR-confirmed pneumonias might only have been of viral origin [23] . The IMCI guidelines have remained quite similar since its introduction, with the exception of the recent integration of malaria RDT, which has been proven useful in Zanzibar [10] . If IMCI in combination with CRP and/or other biomarkers could play a similar role by reliably confirming or excluding bacterial infections like pneumonia needs to be further studied [5] . When planning such studies on infections requiring antibiotics, the following issues should be addressed: Should severely and/or nonseverely ill patients be included? How and when should the illnesses be identified (e.g pointof-care versus molecular based diagnostic techniques)? The likelihood of finding a single laboratory test/biomarker in the near future that could distinguish all infections presumed to require antibiotics from other infections is low. For instance, Fig 7B shows that GAS-infections and Shigellosis were the main infections requiring antibiotics that the IMCI algorithm did not identify. Hence, the way forward would probably be a more complex step-wise approach combining clinical signs, multiple biomarkers and point of care detection of pathogens.",

Due to differences in methodology and inclusion criteria it is difficult to compare our findings to previous studies of fever aetiologies in African children [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] . A recent study from Tanzania also applied a broad microbiology test panel, and reported viral infections as the most common fever causes [32] . However, there are some important methodological differences between D'Acremont et al and our study; they included older children and, importantly, did not include a control group of asymptomatic children.",

Firstly, it was conducted during the time period, directly following the main rainy season in Zanzibar, when respiratory tract infections are known to be more frequent and some diarrheal infections like rotavirus are less frequent and might therefore not be representative for infections occurring during a whole year. Secondly, controls were only sampled for nasopharyngeal and rectal swabs, and the lack of controls for other tests might for example have resulted in over-estimation of GAS infections. Thirdly, we chose not to include blood cultures due to an assumed low yield of bacteraemias [33] . This focus on acute uncomplicated fever precludes any conclusions regarding the frequency or outcome of severe infections.",

The majority of fevers were caused by viral upper respiratory tract infections, similarly to children in high-income countries. A majority of asymptomatic children had potential pathogens detected by NPH-qPCR, often in a similar proportion as patients, underlining the need to include controls. The precision of IMCI to identify infections presumed to require antibiotics was low.",
