The dsRNAs were extracted from symptomless pigeonpea [Cajanus cajan (L.) Millspaugh] plants cv. Erra Kandulu. This new virus with 4.64 kb genome was tentatively named Arhar cryptic virus-1 (ArCV-1). The genomic RNAs were amplified and characterized by sequence independent single primer amplification. The dsRNAs shared a highly conserved 16 nt 5' non-coding region (5'-GATAATGATCCAAGGA-3'). The largest dsRNA (dsRNA-1) was identified as the viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase (replicase), predicted to encode a putative 55.34 kDa protein (P1). The two other smaller dsRNAs (dsRNA-2 and dsRNA-3) predicted to encode for putative capsid proteins of 38.50kDa (P2) and 38.51kDa (P3), respectively. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that ArCV-1 formed a clade together with Fragaria chiloensis cryptic virus, Rosa multiflora cryptic virus and Rose cryptic virus-1, indicating that ArCV-1 could be a new member of the genus Deltapartitivirus. ArCV-1 3D pol structure revealed several interesting features. The 3D pol in its full-length shares structural similarities with members of the family Caliciviridaeand family Picornaviridae. In addition, fourth dsRNA molecule (dsRNA-2A), not related to ArCV-1 genome, was found in the same plant tissue. The dsRNA-2A (1.6 kb) encodes a protein (P4), with a predicted size of 44.5 kDa. P4 shares similarity with coat protein genes of several cryptic viruses, in particular the bipartite cryptic viruses including Raphanus sativus cryptic virus-3. This is the first report of occurrence of a cryptic virus in pigeonpea plants.",

            "text": "Pigeonpea [Cajanus cajan (L.) Millspaugh], having originated in India, is one of the major grain legume (pulse) crops in the Indian subcontinent. The crop is known to be susceptible to a few virus and virus-like pathogens, belonging to different genera [1] [2] [3] [4] . While characterizing the dsRNA from the sterility mosaic disease (SMD) [3] affected pigeonpea plants, we noticed that two sets of symptomless controls plants containing four dsRNA molecules while none were noticed in the remaining sets of healthy samples. Healthy control plant samples (Mg1-H1 and Mg1-H2) that contained the dsRNA were collected from one of the farmers' fields in Chevella area (near Hyderabad, Telangana state). The pattern and the number of dsRNA segments did not match with dsRNAs associated with pigeonpea plants infected by PPSMV-P sub isolate-Chevella (separate manuscript under preparation). Sequence of the four dsRNAs showed neither homology nor alignment to any region of PPSMVs. However, these dsRNAs share close similarities with individual genomic segments of several plant cryptoviruses. Evidence is provided to show that three of the four dsRNAs constitute the genome of a new cryptovirus tentatively named \"Arhar cryptic virus-1\" (ArCV-1) with a genome size of 4.64 kb. Pigeonpea is referred to as \"Arhar\"in Hindi. The genomic sequences showed its phylogenetic relationship to members of the genus Delatapartitivirus. The fourth dsRNA (dsRNA-2A) contained cryptic virus coat protein-like sequences with no similarity to that of ArCV-1 genome. We discussed different possibilities of its occurrence with ArCV-1 genome and its relevance.",

Their RdRp molecules, whose structural details have been described, are larger than RdRp of ArCV-1. RdRps of several important human and animal picornaviruses have been extensively studied that correlated functions with structural details, which contributed to the understanding of the mechanics of this enzyme activity leading to viral replication [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . Similar efforts were made in the past decade to study the 3D structural characterization of RdRps of a very few plant viruses and detailed studies remained to be carried out for RdRps of double-stranded plant viruses including partitiviruses. ArCV-1 RdRp sequence analysis revealed the presence of several conserved amino acid sequence motifs common in other tripartite cryptoviruses. These motifs have been described to be important for biological functions in several RdRps [17] . We report here the results of elaborated computer-assisted analysis of ArCV-1 replicase which revealed the presence of conserved sequence motifs (A to G) present in the fingers and palm subdomains of the polymerase that are shared in most of the RdRps. Interestingly, ArCV-1 replicase has more structural resemblances with several members of ssRNA (+) mono-partite Picornaviruses (viral replication by primer-dependent initiation), than the de novo dsRNA bacteriophage \u0553-6 and reovirus polymerases. Variations found in ArCV-1 motifs' sequence that may be involved in polymerization mechanism and the conserved motifs unique to cryptoviruses have been described. This report illustrates several interesting features of the ArCV-1 3D pol and its complete structure was determined.",

Whereas the dsRNA-2A, 5'-terminus sequence (AGAATTTGCCCTGTAT) did not share the conserved sequences and thus treated as a separate entity. The genome organization of ArCV-1 was thus established during the present study (Fig 2) , together with dsRNA-2A depicting the single open reading frames (ORFs) of dsRNA-1 (RdRp), dsRNA-2 (CP-1) and dsRNA-3 (CP-2) with the predicted molecular weights of proteins encoded by the RNAs (Table 1) . Unlike the 5' end, the 3'-region is least conserved in several cryptic viruses. The majority of the members of the family Partitiviridae typically contain few pyrimidine bases conserved at the 3'-terminal and in tripartite viruses, conservation is seen mainly in two of the RNA segments. ArCV-1 RNAs encoding capsid proteins are conserved in the last three nt (TTC), like in Raphanus sativus cryptic virus-2 (RsCV-2), the three ArCV-1 RNAs end with TC. The majority of the Deltapartitiviruses contain RNA segments consistently ending with nucleotides TC except in Rosa multiflora cryptic virus (RmCV) and Cannabis cryptic virus (CanCV) (Betapartitivirus) interestingly, the 3' termini, each with a poly (A) tract.",

            "text": "The dsRNA-1 (HG797710) is 1,714 nt long, containing a single open reading frame (ORF) between nt 1,606 and nt 179 with 178-and 108-nt-long 5' and 3' NTRs, respectively (Fig 2, Table 1 ). This ORF encodes for a 55.34 kDa protein (P1) containing 475 amino acids. P1 protein was identified as viral RdRp and contains conserved short amino acid sequence motifs (A to G) which are essential for viral replication [18] [19] [20] [21] , and known in several picornavirus RdRPs. The A-G motifs are conserved in the RdRps of several genera of plant and animal viruses containing monopartite, linear, ssRNA (+) genome [17, 18, 22] , segmented, tripartite ssRNA (+) viruses [23] , as well as multi-segmented linear ssRNA (-) viruses [24] [25] [26] [27] . ArCV-1 RdRp similar to the other cryptoviruses contained these signature motifs in the central region of the polypeptide. Specific amino acid sequences mostly conserved formed these seven motifs: SSAAGYGYVGLK (motif G; 117-128) KVRNVW//DPL//SFYFIGQD(motif F; 181-219), FDWSGFD (motif A; 241-247), GIPSGSCFTNIIGSITN (motif B; 302-318), THGDD (motif C; 338-342), DKSD (motif D; 372-375), and TFL (motif E; 384-386) known to be functionally active in viral replication [17] . Computer analysis predicted the active residues in each of the conserved motives (S1 and S2A Figs), indicated in bold letters. Motif G is less conserved amongst the human and animal viruses belonging to the picornavirus ssRNA (+) super family as well as viruses containing dsRNA genome. Active residues in motif G are comparatively well conserved in the dsRNA cryptovirus RdRps (S1 Fig). Aided by RdRp sequence of \u0553-6 and reovirus active residues in motif G were identified [12, 13] . Conserved proline (in this motif) of most of the picornaviruses is substituted in ArCV-1 RdRp by glycine in the C-terminus. SSAAGYGY-G-K sequence is highly conserved in cryptic viruses. In addition to the above mentioned seven conserved motifs, several conserved sequences in ArCV-1 RdRp were present flanking the central region Motif C represented by GDD sequence (Fig 4D, S2A Fig) is almost universal and has been described as the center of catalytic activity of the RdRp in all RdRp classes [18, 28] .

Several investigators conducted mutational studies of the catalytically important residues of the polymerase of different viruses [29] [30] [31] [32] , and determined that the first aspartate is an essential residue of this highly conserved motif for the enzyme activity and its coordination in the binding of a magnesium ion that would be part of the rNTP binding site [12, 33] . It was found that the first Asp (D341 in ArCV-1) is a strict requirement and any change leads to loss of the enzyme activity. Some flexibility was suggested with regard to glycine and the second aspartate and subtle changes in the position of these two residues are tolerated with exceptions [34, 35] . Similar observations were made when the conserved aspartate of brome mosaic virus (+ssRNA) was replaced in the 2a gene with glutamate (D470E), as the DR4 mutant did not replicate in the barley protoplasts [36] . The polymerase structural Cryptic virus from pigeonpea domains and the regulatory mechanism of the enzyme with respective different viruses are well documented in a recent review [17] .

Interestingly, the P4 protein has high degree of sequence identity with cryptic virus coat proteins of bipartite viruses (Table 3 ). Efforts were made to confirm the presence of a second RdRp assuming there may be in existence and dsRNA-2A belongs to another cryptic virus, but were not successful. In each attempt similar four dsRNAs were isolated. It is hard to explain, in absence of a related RdRp gene, and to speculate that the dsRNA-2A coat protein like sequence belong to a yet unknown second cryptovirus infecting pigeonpea. Apart from this, the four RNA showed significant sequence homology with plant genes. Interestingly in BlastX, RNA-1 showed 64% sequence identity with unknown protein of Picea sitchensis or Sitka spruce (ADE76327), an evergreen conifer tree. RNA-2 showed 34% sequence identity with unknown protein (XP008459635) of Cucumis melo. Further, RNA-3 showed highest sequence identity with plant genes as 61% with uncharacterized proteins KOM46435 and XP017431256 of Vigna angularis. Similarly, dsRNA-2A shared 34% sequence identity with ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter F family member-1 (KHF98106) of Gossypium arboretum (tree cotton) found conserved in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. These eukaryotic lineages are not the known host plants for cryptic viruses.",

Structural templates were identified from the PDB and the 3D model created using Zhang lab server [37, 38] . PyMol was used to develop the three dimensional figures. Crystal structure of RdRp has been described depicting the \"closed right hand\" configuration [17, 39] . RdRps belonging to various genera of viruses containing amino acid sequence motifs are most conserved and occur in a typical order [20, 28, 40] , reflecting structural conservation in most cases. Besides size, origin, and some structural variations, all classes of RdRp including several known picornaviruses share two main features by (1) having the 3D structure divided into three major subdomains described as palm, thumb and fingers [17, 39, 41, 42] , and (2) the interconnected subdomains that encloses the conserved catalytic region (Fig 4, S2 Fig) within a largely hollow center referred to as the catalytic center [43] . The 55 kDa ArCV-1 3D pol is a spherical molecule resolved at 7.9\u00c5 resolution showed the basic features described above comprising of characteristic 16 \u03b1-helices, 7 \u03b2-sheets interconnecting with coiled structures ( Fig  4A) forming a structure of a cupped right hand. Unlike in picornaviruses the partitivirus genome is devoid of 5' terminus genome-linked protein (Vpg) or particularly the polymerase with polyadenylated C'-terminal with the exception of CanCV (JN196536) and RsCV-1RNA-3 (DQ181927). The N-terminal residues (1-55) in fingers subdomain (Fig 4A, Blue) of the RdRp molecule extend over to the thumb subdomain binding them together (Fig 4A and 4D ) encircling the molecule, ensuing central cavity. This architecture makes the molecule spherical or globular ( Fig 4A and 4C ), and not U shape normally seen in DNA polymerases and DNA-dependent RNA polymerases [44] . ArCV-1 3D pol has a big cleft opening in to central cavity groove in the front and one at the top left channel referred to as template channel leads to the centre of the cavity supposed to be allowing the access of the RNA template and NTP substrates to the central cavity [17, 33, 45, 46] and that central cavity opens out to the side on the right (rear channel) (Fig 4E) .",

Palm sub-domain contained the structural architecture to suit to the functions, has remarkable alignment with the known RdRps. ArCV-1 RdRp sequence identity with cryptoviruses is high, like the structural alignment. Interestingly, with less sequence homology (Table 4 ) a close structural alignment was noticed between ArCV-1 and Sapovirus (SV) and Norwalk virus (NV) (+ssRNA) RdRps as evident from the panels shown in Fig 5E-5H . Residues playing key roles in active site interactions, distributed across the motifs A to E, in different classes of RdRps have been identified in ArCV-1 dsRNA RdRp as well as the RdRps of other cryptoviruses have been discussed as below.",

In the N-terminal of the motif, the coil forms a loop commonly referred to as B-loop (Ser, Gly, Ser and Cys), connecting to the long \u03b1-helix11. Motif B provides important orienting interactions with the incoming deoxyribonucleoside rNTP [52] , and the B-loop has been described structurally flexible and moves its conformations [53] , the key residue glycine (G306 in ArCV-1) was described to act like a \"hinge\" for the movement. Substitutions of this glycine residue in 3Dpol basically abolished RNA synthesis in vitro [35] . The high sequence and structural conservation of the B-loop among viral RdRps have been reported [17] . Rearrangement residues (SGSCFTNIIGSI) of ArCV-1 motif B which are conserved in cryptoviruses (S1 Fig and Fig 6) did not affect the structural sequence identity of the motif with picornaviruses. While describing the function of B-loop in FMDV the authors speculated that the rearrangements in the template channel and the B-loop occur in a concerted manner and that these changes collectively serve to regulate RNA replication, processivity and fidelity, and the active residues in motif B, each has a definite role to play [17] . Motif B takes part in template binding, incoming nucleotide recognition [39] and determining whether RNA or DNA will be synthesized by selecting rNTPs and dNTPs and correct positioning of the sugar in the ribose-binding pocket [54] , asparagine residue thought to be playing a vital role in its functioning. Briefly, Asn residue in this motif (Asn307 in FMDV) has been confirmed to interact with incoming rNTP (play a role in differentiating between dNTPs and rNTPs and thus determines whether RNA or DNA is synthesized) during RNA elongation in a number of picornavirus elongation complexes [39, 49, [54] [55] [56] . Similar positioning of Asn residue (N297) is present in the long helix \u03b1-H [39], 6.6\u00c5 away from the active aspartate of the catalytic center. However, the highly conserved Asn residue which is critical for enzymatic activity was not evident in motif B of the ArCV-1 RdRp (Fig 6) . This is a conspicuous difference between the RdRps of picornaviruses and cryptoviruses. The Asn residue appears to be substituted by glycine (G314), present at the same position in the \u03b1-11 at a distance of 6.9\u00c5 away from the active aspartate of the catalytic center and is conserved in most of the dsRNA cryptovirus RdRps and also exist in phage \u0553-6 motif B (Gly403). Crotty et al. [49] demonstrated that an absolutely conserved residue (Asn) of motif B within the nucleotide binding pocket of the poliovirus polymerase can be substituted for a different amino acid, yielding replication-competent virus. Glycine that replaced the Asn in cryptoviruses does not have amide group [49] . Employing one of the PV mutants (PV-297G) developed; authors explained that the molecular modeling suggests that a glycine at position 297 leaves sufficiently a large pocket for an additional water molecule [49] . Therefore, glycine may substitute for asparagine 297 by allowing a water molecule to become the hydrogen bonding partner for the NTP 2 0 OH. These results attest to the extreme evolutionary flexibility of the viral RdRp, in terms of both structure and cation usage [49] , and could explain, devoid of Asn (Fig 6) , in motif B of ArCV-1 and other cryptoviruses the polymerase is able to function.",

Like the B-loop the beta bend GDD motif is structurally similar in all classes of RdRps, described as the center of catalytic activity of the enzyme in coordinating the metal ion. The first aspartate (Asp341in ArCV-1) is known to facilitate the rNTP transfer and by binding to the metal ion at the catalytic site. It has been shown that first N-terminus aspartate is absolutely required for enzyme function [29, 32, 35, 57, 58] . The presence of the second aspartate almost is universal in GDD motif with a couple of exceptions [replaced by asparagine (ADN) in IBDV and glutamate Cryptic virus from pigeonpea (GDE) in case of KF of E. coli DNA polymerase I] signifying flexibility at this position. But any substitutions made in the second aspartate were not tolerated as reported in poliovirus RdRp [35, 58] . Phage \u0553-6 and IBDV (dsRNA) RdRps contain the catalytic motif as SDD and ADN respectively that makes the requirement for the glycine residue of GDD motif also somewhat flexible in vitro. However, substitutions at glycine position in Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) 3Dpol make the RdRp completely inactive in vitro [35] , as in the case of potatovirus X (PVX) RdRp in vivo were not tolerated [57] , suggesting that the requirements for this position may be more strict [59] , with some RdRps to function. Aspartate in Motif A interacts in catalytic reaction as they, together with the first aspartate of GDD, coordinate the rNTP transfer [60] . ArCV-1 3Dpol contains a couple of highly conserved aspartate \"active residues\" in motif A; D242 A and D247 A present at a distance of 12.4\u00c5 to each other (S3 Fig) and the D242 A, 7.0\u00c5 from D341 are similar to those referred above [60] , could be interacting with Asp341 by coordinating catalytically essential metals as noticed in many RdRps [23, 39, 61] . Many of the active residues of the conserved motifs (S1 and S2 Figs) present in the central conserved region of the RdRp were located in the central cavity or close by. This region forms a domain that is partially resistant to protease digestions [59] .",

Lysine seems to be sustained in the sequences of motif D of all RdRps [20] . Motif D is inconsistent and not so well conserved in members of the family Picornaviridae and the cryptoviruses analyzed in the present study. Structural variability was noticed in the reported RdRps as well, but the majority showed motif D in a coil. The N-terminal Asp372 in the motif of the 3Dpol was conserved in many primerdependent RdRps of calciviruses and picornaviruses, but not in the rest of cryptoviruses and in de novo RdRps (dsRNA-phage \u0553-6, IBDV and reovirus). Active residues in motif D have been postulated to play critical roles in catalysis [62] . Motif D for long considered \"scaffolding\" for the palm, keeping the structural integrity [39, 59] . Movement of motif D facilitates active site closure and is sensitive to incorrect NTP binding and mismatches at the RNA terminus. These studies link the conformation of motif D to the efficiency and fidelity of nucleotide addition in elongation [63] . Closing and reopening of the active site happens as a result of association of motif D with motif A, which undergo coordinated conformational changes [64] .",

There was variation in the amino acid T384 position in the cryptovirus primary sequence (S1 Fig) as well as in picornaviruses. The hydrophobic L386 residue of this motif was found in the analysis to be active residue; described essentially for catalytic activity. This motif described interacts with the elements of \u03b2-sheets of the palm core structure and the elements in the thumb subdomain in both poliovirus RdRp and RT [39, 65] . Substitution in the vicinity of active leucine residue is not tolerated in polio virus and an insertion of a leucine after R376 of PV (R388 in ArCv-1) was shown to abolish replication in vivo and in vitro [30] , and a double mutant K375A/R376A of the same virus was found to abolish viral replication in vivo [66] , suggesting that the critical role these amino acids play in RdRp functioning.",

The phage Phi6 pol C-terminal extends back ploughing parts of it through the molecule and ends in the middle finger region of the other side [12] . Interestingly, substitutions or deletion of specific residues in the thumb subdomain of Brome mosaic virus (BMV 2a) and poliovirus 3Dpol abolish RNA replication [30, 67] .",

The range of identity varied with the ranking viruses which had high identity with the RdRp of ArCV-1. Different genera of picornaviruses showed high template modeling (TM) score with ArCV-1 3D pol; NV (0.898) [68] , SV (0.898) [69] ,Rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) (0.895) [70] , all members of the family Caliciviridae (Fig 5G and 5H ) and with moderate TM score with alignments of viruses members of the family Picornaviridae; FMDV (0.834) [33] , EMCV (0.830) [71] and Poliovirus (PV) (0.823) [39] . These economically important viruses are human and animal pathogens and the structural details are available in PDB archives which doesn't have the information on the RdRps of cryptic viruses to compare. For the first time using computer analysis we are reporting structural details of RdRps of few plant cryptic viruses with high structural similarity to ArCV-1 3Dpol (Fig 5E and 5F ). Plant cryptovirus and human picornovirus RdRps that showed structural identity were superimposed on ArCV-1 3D RdRp in a cartoon and backbone representations. ArCV-1, 3Dpol (blue) was superimposed by FcCV (green) RdRp (Fig 5E) in a cartoon representation showed exact structural alignment. Similar high-level alignment was noticed when ArCV-1 3Dpol (blue), superimposed by FcCV (grey) RdRp (Fig 5F) , by SV (green) RdRp (PDB ID, 2wk4A) ( Fig 5G) and by NV (brown) RdRp (PDB ID, 2b43D) ( Fig  5H) in a backbone representation. Every 40 th residue from N-terminal to C-terminal was numbered in a stereo back the bone representation of the RdRps. A high degree of alignment was noticed ArCV-1, 3Dpol with FcCV and SV followed by NV especially in the palm region containing the A to E motifs with conserved residues. Structural comparison analysis provided for SV and NV an RMSD value of 2.10\u00c5 and 2.15\u00c5, respectively. Our findings validate the analysis predictions and reveal a possible evolutionary linkage between cryptoviruses (dsRNA viruses) and the picornaviruses (+ssRNA viruses).",

The genomic segments of several Partitiviridae members usually have sequence homology in the terminus ends [72, 73] . ArCV-1 RdRp (dsRNA-1) and dsRNA-2A sequences were used in the phylogenetic analysis with corresponding sequences of members of the genera Alphapartitivirus, Betapartitivirus, Gammapartitivirus, Deltapatitivirus and Cryspovirus (Fig 7) mentioned in the S1 Table. The analysis revealed that the viruses used in the study assembled in five groups, as recognized previously [8] . ArCV-1, dsRNA-1 clustered with tripartite RoCV-1, FCV and FcCV and with members of the genus Deltapartitivirus (Fig 7A) . Phylogeny of dsRNA-2A revealed close relationship with members of bipartite Deltapartitivirus; PepCV-1, PepCV-2, RsCV-3 and CiLCV (Fig 7B) . The findings further support the hypothesis that dsRNA-2A does not belong to the tripartite ArCV-1.",

Association of an additional dsRNA segment (s), discrepancies with cryptic virus infections was not uncommon. In an earlier finding, the association of an extra component in many Vicia faba cultivars infected with Vicia crypticvirus (VCV) was reported [72, 76] . While characterizing the cryptovirus infection of radish (Raphanus sativus-root cv.Yidianghong) the authors suggested that more than one partitivirus was co-infecting radish leaves [73, 75] . The second virus in the complex has two smaller segments (RasR4 and RasR5) contained conserved 5' termini sequence with RasR3 (RdRp) deem to be with unknown functions not having sequence identity with the known capsid proteins. In the present study, the four dsRNA shared sequence identity with members of Deltapartitivirus. The dsRNA-2A, (P4) contains sequence that resembles viral coat protein showed an unusually long 3'-terminal 353nt NTR region. The 5'-terminus of this dsRNA is different, does not share sequence identity with the 5'-terminus conserved genome segments of ArCV-1. However, P4 showed sequence identity with bipartite and tripartite cryptovirus coat proteins with pronounced resemblance to the bipartite cryptoviruses (Table 3) . Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the P4 was closely related to RsCV-3 segment-2; coat protein (FJ461350). This indicates that the origin of P4 is related to Partitiviridae, but we have no evidence that P4 may interact with ArCV-1 in its replicative cycle or it is a derivative of rearranged sequences of the ArCV-1 coat proteins-highly unlikely or it could be part of the genome of evolving yet another cryptic virus. Members of group 1 and 2 clustered separately but originate from common point however origin of members of group 3 were different. Group 4 and 5 originate from common sub-clade, which is different from other groups. ArCV-1 RNA-1 clusters with tripartite members of the genus Deltapartitivirus and is closely related to FcCV and RsCV-2. *Beet cryptic virus-2 was an assigned member of Deltapartitivirus but it was noticed to fit in with Alphapartitivirus. (B) Phylogenetic analysis of dsRNA-2A (P4 protein), displays its proximity with bipartite PepCV-2 and RsCV-3. The bar represents base substitution per site.

Computational analysis was used to develop and characterize ArCV-1 3D pol structure at 7.9 \u00c5 resolution. We studied several RdRp analogs in the PDB which showed homologous structural identity with ArCV-1 RdRp mostly of animal and human picornaviruses. Unlike the genomic RNA of picornaviruses, the ArCV-1 dsRNA-1 that encodes RdRp (55kDa) protein does not show 5' cap or VPg or 3' polyadenylation, but a stretch of NTRs present on both the termini with no internal structures. The 3Dpol structures of Norwalk virus, Poliovirus and Sapporo virus which were previously determined and the respective sequences used, produced identical 3D structures in our computer analysis, confirming authenticity of ArCV-1 structural analysis.",

Motif F of cryptoviruses unlike the other classes of RdRps is well conserved and extends from few residues before \u03b2-sheet 2 to \u03b1helix 6 and the connecting coils. Computer analysis predicted that Motif F contains several active residues supposed to be interacting with the RNA in the ArCV-1 3D complex were detected (Fig 5B, green colour, S1 Fig) . Basic residues Lys181 and Arg183 of this motif were also conserved in other RdRps; for example, in FMDV motif F, Lysine residue along with two arginine residues (K172, R168 and R179) predicted to interact with the incoming NTP substrate [33] . Motif G forms part of a long coiled loop connecting \u03b1-helices 4 and 5 in the fingers subdomain (Fig 4B, red) . Motif G is highly conserved in the cryptoviral RdRps.

            "text": "Mutational analyses in PV and FMDV also have demonstrated that some substitutions in residues located far from the active site, in particular at the RdRp N-terminus, have significant effects on catalysis and fidelity [17] . Several highly conserved stretches of sequence motifs of ArCV-1 in the N-terminus to the central region, have been identified uniquely to cryptic virus RdRps. Motifs 1 and 2 are observed in the RdRp sequence away from the palm subdomain could play a role in catalysis (S1 Fig). The palm sub domain contains A to E motifs in a series. \u03b2-sheet 3 to \u03b1-8 consists of residues 241-251 were identified as Motif A (Fig 4B, blue color) contains conserved Asp242 and Asp247. Like SV and NV, RHDV 3D pol also has a high degree of structural homology with ArCV-1 (Fig 5 and S3 Fig) and the aspartate residues share identical positions in motif A and C (Asp A 250 and Asp C 354 in RHDV). It has been described that metal ions that are likely to be involved in the nucleotide transfer reaction, interact with aspartate residues at positions 250, 354, and 355 in RHDV [70] . Similarly, in ArCV-1 3D pol the corresponding two aspartate residues Asp A 242 and Asp A 247 which are separated by a distance of 12.4\u212b and Asp A 242 being closer (7.0 \u212b) to the catalytic aspartate Asp C 341, could be performing the same functions. Ser, Gly, Thr and NS/T are identified as highly conserved active residues in motif B (Fig 4B, purple), each with specific function in many picornaviruses. Asn residue (Asn307 in FMDV) of motif B plays a role in differentiating between dNTPs and rNTPs and thus determines whether RNA or DNA is synthesized [39, 55] . Later it was determined that the active Asp residue of motif A, and Asn of motif B (Asp240, Asn307 in FMDV) play a critical role in rNTP selection as evident from the FMDV replication process [33] . Asparagine residue is highly conserved in the long helix, about 6.6\u00c5 away from the active aspartate of the catalytic center in picornaviruses. On the contrary, the Asn residue was substituted by Glycine (314) present almost at the same position (Fig 6) , in the \u03b1-helix (\u03b1-11 in ArCV-1), conserved in most of the dsRNA cryptovirus RdRps. In poliovirus mutational studies, Asn (297) was substituted by glycine (PV-297G) resulted in replication-competent virus, which probably explains how cryptoviruses are able to multiply with altered functional residue (Gly314) involved in rNTP selection (S3A Fig) [49] . Rearrangement (SGSCFTNIIGSI) of few residues of the ArCV-1 motif B which are conserved in cryptoviruses did not affect the structural similarity of the motif with picornaviruses. The architecture of the palm subdomain of ArCV-1 3D pol with three \u03b2-Sheets (\u03b2-3, \u03b2-6 and \u03b2-7) sandwiched between two \u03b1-helices (\u03b1-7 and \u03b1-12) is highly conserved feature in most of the RdRps as motif C (Fig 4B, pale pink) . The anti-parallel \u03b2-Sheets 6 and 7 connected by a short loop containing GDD (Asp 341 and Asp 342) sequence described as catalytic center. Structural properties and catalytical aspects of palm and thumb (residue 399 to residue 475) sub-domains are discussed in greater detail in the results section.",

It has been described that viral replication can be initiated by two principally differing mechanisms; the primer-dependent [42] , and primer independent or de novo initiations [81] [82] [83] . However, Influenza virus employs a combination of the two mechanisms with the choice being determined by the type of RNA to be synthesized [84] . The de novo synthesis involving the interactions of required components, the initiation essentially a one-nucleotide primer provides the 3'-hydroxyl for the addition of the next nucleotide [42] . The de novo RdRps have specific structural elaborations that function to stabilize the initiation complex. Such initiation platforms have been found in the crystal structures of viral RdRps of Cystoviridae, Reoviridae and Birnaviridae [12, 13, 77] . In the second mechanism, the primer-dependent initiation requires the use of either an oligonucleotide or a protein primer to provide the hydroxyl nucleophile. Members of the Picornaviridae family use exclusively the protein-primed mechanism of initiation [17, 81] .",

FMDV RdRp was shown to have the wide enough central cleft to accommodate the bulky priming peptide during the initiation of RNA (complexed with RNA, divalent cation and protein primer VPg), synthesis [46] . Similar structural details of the polymerase mentioned above share a number of unique features by ArCV-1 and other cryptoviruses (Fig 4A, 4C and 4E ). If the structural architecture reflects the functions of a polymerase as often supposed [17] , the simple thumb organization, arrangement of the motifs (A to G) in a structural order (Fig 4B) , large central cavity and the entry and exit channels like in picornaviruses and having remarkable structural conservation with SV, NV and RHDV 3Dpol, lead to a strong possibility that ArCV-1 RdRp could adopt primer dependent initiation mechanism. This important aspect of research of cryptovirus RdRps is yet to be explained.

The clarified contents were extracted with equal volume of Tris (pH 8; phenol pH 4.5 \u00b1 0.2) saturated phenol: chloroform: Isoamyl-alcohol (25:24:1) mixture followed by vigorously shaking at room temperature for 20 min. The contents were centrifuged at 11,000 rpm (Heraeus Multifuge 35R+, Thermo Scientific, USA) for 10 min. One fifth volume of ethanol was added to the supernatant and mixed well, followed by the addition of 1g of cellulose CF-11 (Whatman, USA) and the slurry was incubated at room temperature for 30 min with continuous shaking. The mixture was centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 5 min. and the cellulose pellet with dsRNA was resuspended in 40 ml wash buffer (1\u00d7 STE with 16% ethanol) and washed twice for 5 min with mild agitation. The cellulose slurry was applied to a 20 ml syringe blocked with glass wool and washed with 20 ml of washing buffer. The bound dsRNA was eluted stepwise (two times) with 15 ml elution buffer (1\u00d7 STE without ethanol). The eluted dsRNA was further purified by adding 1/5 th volume of ethanol and 0.8 g CF-11 cellulose and the suspension was vigorously shaken for 30 min at room temperature. The suspension was transferred to a new 20 ml syringe and the dsRNA was eluted again twice with 2.5 ml elution buffer. The extracted dsRNA was precipitated by adding 1/10 th volume of 3 M sodium acetate pH 5.2, and 2.5 volumes of absolute ethanol and incubated overnight at -20\u02daC.

The amino acid sequence of ArCV-1 (Table 1) , RdRp (P1), was used to develop 3D structure with characteristic folding. I-TASSER (http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/I-TASSER), an online server was used to study the RdRp [37, 38] . This integrated platform generated threedimensional atomic models from multiple threading alignments and iterative structural assembly simulations. Data provided on topology similarity (TM) with the proteins structurally close to the target protein (s) in the PDB is helpful contrivance to assess the relationships of the polymerase. The outputs of the I-TASSER data of possible predicted models and the molecular graphics are of high quality that contained full-length secondary and tertiary structure predictions. Developed structures were subjected to simulations by an open-source viewer, the PyMol (https://www.pymol.org) and Jmol (http://jmol.sourceforge.net/) an interactive graphics program [91, 92] , for illustrating the three-dimensional (3D) chemical structures of the crystal. These programs were used to alter the scheme of the images to characterize the proteins. Using this program, individual and conserved residues in the motifs were identified which facilitated understanding over all nature of the RdRp. Structural adjustment was made for this model of ArCV-1 3D pol of about 90\u02dato study from top surface and side ways to visualize the orientation of channels. Amino acid sequences of 3Dpol structures of Norwalk virus (1SH0), poliovirus (4R0E) and Sapporo virus (2wk4A) from PDB and RTSV sequence (NCBI NP734463) was used in the analysis and to develop 3Dpol structures.",
