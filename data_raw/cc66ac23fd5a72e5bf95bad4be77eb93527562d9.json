As such, it suffers from a number of limitations caused directly by the restrictive assumptions we have made. For example, we have assumed that all cases in this small population were observed. However, despite the possibility of intense surveillance in a small population, it is unlikely that even all symptomatic cases will be detected. Also, most pathogens generate some mild or entirely asymptomatic cases that would evade even the most intense surveillance efforts.

However, the ability of these methods to independently estimate both means and variances of the offspring distribution and serial interval distribution remains to be described. We would anticipate that the estimation of variance for the serial interval distribution would be challenging [18] for cases other than where there are very high volumes of data for the first few generations (which could arise from a large seeding event) or when the true distribution has a low variance. There are likely substantial opportunities to gain valuable insights into outbreak dynamics if we relax our assumption that transmissibility is constant over time and thus consider an inferential framework that accounts for both changes in transmissibility and depletion of susceptible individuals. The reproduction number would vary over time because of both effects. This approach might be especially useful for severe infections that affect small populations, such as Ebola.",

Part a shows real-time univariate estimates of R 0 in which the true value of T g was assumed known. Part b shows real-time univariate estimates of T g with R 0 assumed known. The results of jointly estimating R 0 and T g are shown in parts c (R 0 ) and d (T g ). Scenario 1 is as per Fig 1A with R 0 = 1.8, T g = 2.5. The epidemic was simulated in a population of 1,000 people all of whom were initially susceptible, other than 50 who were infectious on day 1. Grey lines trace the corresponding estimates of 8 arbitrary epidemics. Black lines represent the average of 100 estimates at that time point, red lines represent the median, and the green dotted lines are the 5% and 95% prediction intervals for 100 epidemics.
