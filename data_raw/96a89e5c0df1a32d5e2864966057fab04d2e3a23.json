We have previously shown that local type I interferon response within the central nervous system (CNS) is involved in the protection of mice against tick-borne flavivirus infection. However, the cells responsible for mounting this protective response are not defined. Methods: Primary astrocytes were isolated from wild-type (WT) and interferon alpha receptor knock out (IFNAR \u2212/\u2212 ) mice and infected with neurotropic flaviviruses. Viral replication and spread, IFN induction and response, and cellular viability were analyzed. Transcriptional levels in primary astrocytes treated with interferon or supernatant from virus-infected cells were analyzed by RNA sequencing and evaluated by different bioinformatics tools.",

In contrast to fibroblast, astrocytes mount a rapid interferon response and restrict viral spread. Furthermore, basal expression levels of key interferon-stimulated genes are high in astrocytes compared to mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Bioinformatic analysis of RNA-sequencing data reveals that astrocytes have established a basal antiviral state which contributes to the rapid viral recognition and upregulation of interferons. The most highly upregulated pathways in neighboring cells were linked to type I interferon response and innate immunity. The restriction in viral growth was dependent on interferon signaling, since loss of the interferon receptor, or its blockade in wild-type cells, resulted in high viral replication and virus-induced cytopathic effects. Astrocyte supernatant from TBEV-infected cells can restrict TBEV growth in astrocytes already 6 h post infection, the effect on neurons is highly reinforced, and astrocyte supernatant from 3 h post infection is already protective.",

            "text": "The genus Flavivirus belonging to the family Flaviviridae include important pathogens causing severe human disease including meningitis, encephalitis, hemorrhagic fevers, and microcephaly. The most significant neurotropic flaviviruses are arthropod-borne tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), West Nile virus (WNV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), and Zika virus (ZIKV). TBEV is transmitted by Ixodes ticks, whereas WNV, JEV, and ZIKV are transmitted via mosquitos. No treatments are available for any of these viral infections, and patients are dependent on innate and adaptive parts of the host immune response to fight infections [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . The innate immune system presents a first line of defense against viral infections, for which type I interferons (IFNs) are particularly important. After flavivirus infection, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is produced as an intermediate during viral replication. This is sensed as a danger signal in the infected cell by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and a signaling cascade is initiated, which leads to the upregulation of IFNs [7, 8] . IFNs are powerful cytokines that mediate antiviral effects via both autocrine and paracrine signaling mechanisms via the IFN alpha receptor (IFNAR). Binding to IFNAR activates the downstream kinases Janus kinase 1 and tyrosine kinase 2, which phosphorylate signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 and transcription-2 (STAT1, STAT2). Together with interferon regulatory factor-9 (IRF9), these form a signaling complex referred to as IFN-stimulated gene factor-3 (ISGF3). ISGF3 translocates to the nucleus and activates the transcription of a large number of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) by binding to the interferon response elements. ISGs can inhibit almost every step of a viral life cycle [9, 10] .",

Previous studies have shown that the IFN response and ISG expression in neurons restrict neurotropic flavivirus infection in neurons [19, 21] ; however, not much is known about the role of the IFN response in astrocytes during neurotropic flavivirus infection. Recent studies have shown that astrocytes are important IFN-producing cells in various neurotropic viral infections [18, 22, 23] . Astrocytes are one of the most abundant cell types in the brain and mediate diverse supportive functions including ion homeostasis [24, 25] , uptake of glutamate [26] , free radical scavenging [27] , and immune regulation [28] . In TBEV infection, autopsy studies have revealed astrogliosis in post mortem human brains [20, 29] , which has been observed for WNV and JEV as well [30, 31] . Indeed, astrocytes have been found to be a site of these infections [32] . However, only a few astrocytes were found to be infected in LGTV-infected mice [33] . They resist infection in an interferon-beta promoter stimulator 1 (IPS-1)-dependent manner and show an activated phenotype, indicating their involvement in LGTV clearance. Both rat and human astrocytes have been shown to be infected in vitro with TBEV; however, the number of infected cells never exceeded 20 %, and the infection did not affect astrocyte viability [34, 35] . Similar findings have also been observed for other neurotropic flaviviruses [36] [37] [38] [39] . Therefore, we set out to investigate how the type I IFN system in primary mouse astrocytes contributes to cell survival and restriction of neurotropic flavivirus growth.",

The Siberian and Far Eastern subtypes have been associated with more severe disease compared to the European subtype [57, 58] . Increased pathogenicity could be due to several factors, e.g., ability to interfere with the type I IFN response. Therefore, viral growth of two reference strains; the Siberian Aina and Far Eastern Sofjin, was analyzed in WT and IFNAR \u2212/\u2212 astrocytes (Fig. 2c, d) . Similar to the European subtype of TBEV, an interferon response also restricted the spread of Siberian and Far Eastern TBEV subtypes (Fig. 2c, d) . Although the type I IFN response plays an important role in mosquito-borne neurotropic flavivirus (WNV, JEV, and ZIKV) infections in vivo [12-14, 59, 60] , the specific role of IFNAR signaling in restricting viral growth in astrocytes is unknown. WT and IFNAR \u2212/\u2212 astrocytes were infected with JEV, WNV, and ZIKV, and the numbers of infected cells were determined ( Fig. 2e-g) . For all three mosquito-borne viruses, the IFN response was required for the restriction of viral spread in astrocytes. Our data shows that the type I IFN response in astrocytes efficiently restricts the spread of both tick-and mosquito-borne neurotropic flaviviruses.",

The observed differences in the impact of IFNAR on astrocytes and MEFs could either be explained by the ability to respond to, or the capacity to induce, IFN following infection. To determine the impact of the type I IFN response in the overall antiviral response, astrocytes and MEFs were pretreated with IFN\u03b1B/D [49] Sixteen hours before TBEV infection (Fig. 3a, b) . TBEV growth was inhibited to a similar extent showing that both cell-types were able to mount a strong antiviral response upon IFN treatment. Thus, the ability to respond to IFN (Fig. 3a, b) could not explain the lack of control of viral replication in IFNAR \u2212/\u2212 MEFs (Fig. 1d, e) . To test whether astrocytes and MEFs differ in their capability to induce type I IFNs after infection, IFN\u03b2 and IFN\u03b12 mRNAs were quantified by realtime qPCR (Fig. 3c, d) . Interestingly, the IFN responses in the two cell types were quite different. Whereas astrocytes induced IFN mRNA after 6 h, the response in MEFs was delayed and IFN\u03b2 and IFN\u03b12 mRNAs were detected only after 24 or 48 hpi, respectively. Next, a VSV-GFP-based . Asterisks indicate data were statistically significant: ***p < 0.0001 bioassay on MEFs was applied to quantify secreted IFN, and astrocytes were found to secrete higher levels of IFNs 24 hpi compared to MEFs (Fig. 3e) . These data indicate that astrocytes react to viral infection by the induction of IFNs much more rapidly than MEFs.",

Together with TRIM79\u03b1, viperin has recently been identified as an inhibitor of TBEV in vitro [50, 61] . Viperin has also been shown to have antiviral activity against WNV [62] . Viperin and TRIM79\u03b1 mRNAs were quantified over time by qPCR in WT and IFNAR \u2212/\u2212 astrocytes and WT MEFs (Fig. 5a, b) . ISGs were rapidly induced in WT astrocytes at early time points whereas induction was delayed in IFNAR \u2212/\u2212 astrocytes and WT MEFs. The basal levels of viperin and TRIM79\u03b1 were higher in WT astrocytes compared to WT MEFs and IFNAR \u2212/\u2212 astrocytes (Fig. 5b) and might contribute to limit initial viral infection. Viperin protein was also strongly induced in WT astrocytes as early as 6 hpi whereas corresponding protein levels were only reached after 24 hpi in IFNAR \u2212/\u2212 astrocytes (Fig. 5c) . Together, these data show that WT astrocytes express higher basal levels of a subset of antiviral genes and rapidly respond upon viral infection to express antiviral protein that can limit viral infection. MEFs and IFNAR \u2212/\u2212 astrocytes show lower basal expression of some antiviral ISGs and a delayed IFN response and ISG were pretreated with 5000 U IFN\u03b1B/D for 16 h before infection with TBEV MOI 0.1. Viral titers were determined by focus forming assay at indicated time points (n = 6). Primary astrocytes and MEFs were infected with TBEV using MOI 0.1. Expression levels of IFN-\u03b2 (c) and IFN\u03b1 2 (d) were determined by qPCR (n = 9). Supernatants were collected at the indicated time points, and antiviral activity was determined by VSV-GFP bioassay on MEFs (e, n = 6) or TBEV-based bioassay on WT and IFNAR \u2212/\u2212 astrocytes (f, n = 12). g WT and IFNAR \u2212/\u2212 astrocytes were treated with either 5000 U IFN\u03b1B/D or virus-inactivated supernatant from WT astrocytes 24 hpi (n= 6). TBEV replication was quantified using qPCR and normalized to input viral RNA.

IFNAR \u2212/\u2212 cells showed a negative enrichment compared to WT in immune pathways and interferon signaling, while the positively enriched gene sets were below our cut-off adjusted p value < 0.05 (Fig. 6 ). Both IFN\u03b1B/D and supernatant treatment lead to enrichment in \"interferon signaling\" and \"interferon alpha beta signaling\" (Fig. 6) . Differentially expressed genes between WT and the three samples were analyzed using IPA to uncover predicted activation of canonical pathways and disease functions. Pathways involved in viral recognition and antiviral signaling as well as functions involved in viability of leukocytes and antiviral and inflammatory responses were found to be downregulated in IFNAR \u2212/\u2212 compared to WT astrocytes (Additional file 1: Tables S3 and S4), which can explain why the IFNAR \u2212/\u2212 cells responded poorly after viral infection. IPA analysis revealed activation of pathways involved in innate immune signaling and viral recognition, antiviral and immune response after treatment with IFN\u03b1B/D and supernatant (Additional file 1: Table S3 and S4). To extend our analyses and investigate what might be responsible for these transcriptomic changes, with focus on the difference between the IFN\u03b1B/ D and the supernatant treatment, we performed an IPA upstream analysis, and a Connectivity Map (CMAP) analysis. Both of these analyses evaluate the relationship(s) that might have led to the pattern of transcript regulation that we found after treatment. In Fig. 7a , we have plotted all upstream regulators that are predicted by the IPA analysis to be either activated or inhibited after IFN\u03b1B/D or supernatant treatment. Upstream regulators that are predicted to be activated after both treatments include several interferon regulated factors (IRF3, IRF7, STAT1) as well as IFNAR and IFN\u03b3 as the most activated. Each dot in Fig. 7a represents a regulator e.g., (IFN alpha/beta) with a circle of markers of upregulated transcripts found in the dataset (Fig. 7b) . Interestingly, five upstream regulators were predicted to be activated specifically after supernatant treatment (IL5, CD38, KMT2D, HIF1A, UCP1, and JAK2; Fig. 7a, y-axis >2) . The CMAP database is an orthogonal bioinformatics tool that correlates specific geneoverexpression with their associated transcriptomic changes. Our transcriptional changes after IFN\u03b1B/D or supernatant treatments were compared to the CMAP database and the connectivity scores are compared to each other in Fig. 7c , and top scoring genes included IFNB1, IFN\u03b3, and CD40. IFN\u03b3 came up in both gene set enrichment analyses, IPA and CMAP (Figs. 6, 7a, b) , suggesting that TBEV induces IFN\u03b3 after infection in astrocytes. However, no differences in IFN\u03b3 mRNA expression levels were detected after infection in astrocytes (data not shown).",

Interestingly, the numbers of TBEV-infected cells and TBEV replication were increased to levels similar to those measured in IFNAR \u2212/\u2212 cells. This indicated that response to type I IFN is more important for restricting viral growth than the basal expression level of antiviral ISGs.

Recent studies have shown that TBEV and WNV can infect astrocytes in vitro but fail to spread from cell to cell. However, what prevents viral spread in astrocytes is not known [34, 36] . Our recent results show that neurons are the main target of LGTV infection; however, a small number of astrocytes also become infected. During infection, astrocytes show an activated phenotype in vivo and more cells become infected after LGTV infection in IPS-1-deficient mice [33] , indicating that type I IFN response might contribute to the restricted growth of virus in astrocytes.",

            "text": "In this study, we show that, although primary astrocytes are infected in a comparable manner to MEF initially, viral replication and spread is dramatically inhibited, indicating that astrocytes are abortively infected with neurotropic flavivirus similar to La Crosse virus infections [73] . This phenotype is dependent on IFNAR expression, since viral replication is uncontrolled in IFNAR-deficient astrocytes. Consistent with previous results for WNV, we now show for all three subtypes of TBEV, JEV, and ZIKV that the rapidly produced type I IFN in astrocytes after neurotropic flavivirus infection limits the viral spread and prevent virus-induced killing of the cells. showing upstream regulators that are predicted to be activated (>2 activation score) or inhibited (<\u22122 activation score) according to experimental and literature findings. Y-axis show upstream regulators predicted from supernatant-treated astrocytes, and x-axis show upstream regulators predicted from IFN\u03b1B/D-treated astrocytes. Five upstream regulators show an idiosyncratic activation specific for the supernatant-treated cells, aligning the y-axis and with an activations score of >2. b An example of predicted activators by IPA. The circle of markers is upregulated transcripts (red), and the center is a regulator (IFN alpha/beta), predicted to be active based on information (orange arrows) in the IPA knowledge-database. Each black dot in a is representing a similar circle of regulated markers. c Genes that, when overexpressed, lead to a similar expression pattern as either supernatant treatment (y-axis) or IFN\u03b1B/D treatment (x-axis) according to the connectivity map database (CMAP). Genes predicted by both treatments are in the top right corner (e.g., IFNG and IFNB1) while effects exclusive to supernatant treatment are high (>90) on the y-axis and low (<90) on the x-axis Weak IFN signals, transmitted independently of viral infection, could be crucial for predisposing cells to amplify their IFN production in response to viral infection and enhance their response to other cytokines [74, 75] . Intriguingly, WT astrocytes were in an antiviral state with higher levels of ISGs compared to MEFs, and these were rapidly induced to even higher levels after TBEV infection. Because no difference in basal levels of IFN\u03b2 or IFN\u03b12 was observed between MEFs and WT astrocytes (data not shown), a different mechanism compared to IFN priming may exist [76] . However, it seems that the responsiveness to viral infection is determined by basal levels of innate immune components. We have reported previously that TBEV is able to delay IFN\u03b2 induction by hiding its dsRNA within replication vesicles in A549 cells [42, 77] and a similar observation was made in the MEFs in this study. No delay in type I IFN induction was observed in astrocytes, clearly indicating that if certain antiviral factors are present in the cell at a basal level the virus is unable to delay the IFN response. High basal expression of ISGs have also been linked to viral resistance to influenza A infection in bronchial epithelial cells [78] and contribute to neuronal tropism of WNV [19] . Furthermore, we previously showed that viperin is a strong inhibitor of TBEV infection [50] . Therefore, the increased basal expression of some key ISGs could contribute to lower flavivirus replication in astrocytes. However, the basal expression was not enough by itself to restrict TBEV replication or spread as neutralization of IFNAR with antibodies in WT astrocytes rendered the WT cells susceptible to TBEV infection. Virus infection has been shown to directly induce antiviral ISGs independently of IFN signaling [79] ; however, in the case of TBEV infection of astrocytes, this response does not seem to inhibit TBEV growth.",

Primary astrocytes isolated from WT and IFNAR \u2212/\u2212 mice were infected with TBEV MOI of 0.1 and viral growth was determined at indicated time points. Two hours before infection, cells were treated with anti-IFNAR antibody or control IgG (IgC). Number of infected cells were measured by immunofluorescent staining of TBEV E antigen and DAPI (a, n = 8). Quantification of virus RNA determined by qPCR analysis (b, n = 6). Viral titers in cell culture supernatants determined by focus forming assay (c, n = 6). Cell viability after infection was measured using a resazurine viability assay (d, n = 8). Supernatants from TBEV-infected astrocytes were collected at the indicated time points and inactivated. Primary neurons were pretreated with the supernatants followed by TBEV infection, and viral infection was determined 48 h post infection by immunofluorescent staining of TBEV E antigen and DAPI (e, n = 6). Mean values and standard deviations from three independent experiments are shown. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001; ****p < 0.0001 of them were downregulated in IFNAR \u2212/\u2212 astrocytes, which were highly susceptible to TBEV infection, whereas they were upregulated in supernatant-and IFN\u03b1B/D-treated cells, which were resistant to the infection. Several antiviral ISGs were identified among the overlap such as viperin and TRIM79\u03b1, which have been identified as inhibitors of TBEV [50, 61] . ISG15, viperin, and Oas1b, which were found to be downregulated in IFNAR \u2212/\u2212 astrocytes and upregulated after treatment with IFN\u03b1B/D and supernatant, have previously been identified as inhibitors of WNV and could thus contribute to antiviral response against WNV in astrocytes [19, 62, 80, 81] .",

Similar findings were found in a previous study where IFN signaling and antiviral mediators were among the most upregulated pathways and genes in WNV-infected mice brains [51] . IFN\u03b3-STAT1-IRF-1 signaling cascade was predicted as an upstream regulator both in supernatant and IFN\u03b1B/D-treated astrocytes. Although IFN\u03b3 transcripts were not detected in TBEV infected, astrocytes IRF-1 could be directly induced by virus infection and could be responsible for the induction of the overlap between inducible genes among the type I and II IFNs [79, [82] [83] [84] . Taken together, the RNAseq confirms the potent IFN response of the astrocytes and identifies a subset of genes as key players in determining the outcome of TBEV infection in astrocytes.",

However, the mechanism underlying the resistance to virus-induced cell death in astrocytes is not well understood. Here, we show that the type I IFN response prevents TBEV-mediated cytopathic effect. Blocking of IFNAR using antibodies as well as IFNAR knockout induced TBEV-mediated cell death of astrocytes whereas the WT control remained unaffected.",
