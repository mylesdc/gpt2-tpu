            "text": "Background: Griffithsin is a broad spectrum antiviral lectin that inhibits viral entry and maturation processes through binding clusters of oligomannose glycans on viral envelope glycoproteins. An efficient, scaleable manufacturing process for griffithsin active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) is essential for particularly cost-sensitive products such as griffithsin -based topical microbicides for HIV-1 prevention in resource poor settings. Our previously published purification method used ceramic filtration followed by two chromatography steps, resulting in a protein recovery of 30%. Our objective was to develop a scalable purification method for griffithsin expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana plants that would increase yield, reduce production costs, and simplify manufacturing techniques. Considering the future need to transfer griffithsin manufacturing technology to resource poor areas, we chose to focus modifying the purification process, paying particular attention to introducing simple, low-cost, and scalable procedures such as use of temperature, pH, ion concentration, and filtration to enhance product recovery. Results: We achieved >99% pure griffithsin API by generating the initial green juice extract in pH 4 buffer, heating the extract to 55\u00b0C, incubating overnight with a bentonite MgCl 2 mixture, and final purification with Capto\u2122 multimodal chromatography. Griffithsin extracted with this protocol maintains activity comparable to griffithsin purified by the previously published method and we are able to recover a substantially higher yield: 88 \u00b1 5% of griffithsin from the initial extract. The method was scaled to produce gram quantities of griffithsin with high yields, low endotoxin levels, and low purification costs maintained. Conclusions: The methodology developed to purify griffithsin introduces and develops multiple tools for purification of recombinant proteins from plants at an industrial scale. These tools allow for robust cost-effective production and purification of griffithsin. The methodology can be readily scaled to the bench top or industry and process components can be used for purification of additional proteins based on biophysical characteristics.",

            "text": "Griffithsin (GRFT) is a high mannose targeting lectin that has shown promise as a microbicide candidate against viruses with oligomannose-rich envelope glycoproteins, such as HIV-1 or HSV-2 [1] [2] [3] [4] . GRFT was originally isolated from a red alga (Griffithsia sp.) with native and recombinant forms showing similar antiviral activity against laboratory strains and primary isolates of HIV-1 [1, 4] . Recombinant forms of GRFT have been successfully produced in both E. coli and N. benthamiana, with the latter used to produce multi-gram quantities of functional GRFT [4, 5] . GRFT has shown to be a safe and effective microbicide against HIV, but needs to be evaluated in clinical trials [2, 6] . The HIV epidemic is prevalent in many resource-limited or developing countries and the availability of indigenous manufacturing systems for GRFT in those areas could facilitate large-scale rollout of microbicide product. Cost and production complexity are factors that must be considered when manufacturing biologics for extremely cost-sensitive markets, such as for microbicides in developing economies.",

            "text": "This communication details our development of a process to reduce the production cost of GRFT from N. benthamiana. Currently published industrial scale GRFT manufacturing uses ceramic filtration followed by two-stage chromatography [4] . These relatively complex methods require specialized equipment and increase production costs. The molecule's biophysical properties, and specifically the melting temperature, were taken into account when developing a new purification methodology. GRFT has a melting temperature of 78.8\u00b0C and remains functionally stable at temperatures not tolerated by many of the contaminating proteins [7, 8] . There are three primary contaminants to contend with when trying to purify GRFT from N. benthamiana: two production host-associated, the small and large subunits of Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Ru-BisCO), and one contaminant from the TMV production system, TMV coat protein (CP). RuBisCO lacks the thermostability of GRFT at acidic pHs. Therefore, in these studies we tested heat treatment, under acidic conditions, of our crude plant extracts containing GRFT to determine if any of the major contaminants could be removed through precipitation/denaturation. The TMV CP has shown a propensity to self-aggregate under certain ionic, pH, and temperature conditions. Absorption by the clay material, bentonite, has been previously used to purify TMV particles and could potentially be a useful tool in removal of the coat protein contaminant [9] . Therefore purification methods utilizing altered heat, pH, ion concentrations, and bentonite filtration were all tested in an effort to develop a scalable purification method requiring less specialized equipment. We have developed a single-step-chromatography purification method that will decrease the cost and complexity of producing large quantities of GRFT, while increasing the protein recovery. The application of this knowledge on industrial size purification should further reduce GRFT cost of production and may be beneficial for production of other plant-made pharmaceuticals.",

            "text": "Leaf punches were used to determine the pH and NaCl concentration parameters that were optimal for extraction of GRFT and minimal extraction of contaminating proteins. One dimensional SDS PAGE profiles showed the optimal extraction pH for GRFT to be pH 4.0. The addition of 100 mM NaCl showed minimal impact on the purity of GRFT in the small-scale samples, but from prior work it is understood that the addition of NaCl will improve purity as long as it is not deleterious to the protein of interest especially as scale is increased. Therefore all subsequent purifications used 100 mM sodium acetate and 300 mM NaCl pH4 as the extraction buffer. Analysis of the small scale protein extraction profiles by SDS-PAGE demonstrates little impact of temperature on the extract purity, but does show that GRFT maintains stability in temperatures ranging from 60 -80\u00b0C. GRFT's thermostability in heated extracts was further assessed in larger scale extractions and Figure 1 shows clearly the impact that heat has on contaminating proteins. Nearly all contaminating proteins aggregated at temperatures above 50\u00b0C (Figure 1 ), increasing the extract purity 30 -40% (Figure 1 ), while GRFT remains stable until the extract reaches 90\u00b0C. Figure 1 Removal of plant protein contaminants from GRFT Extract with Heat. Plants expressing GRFT through a TMV-based expression system were harvested at pH4 in sodium acetate buffer and the extract was divided into 7 aliquots. Each aliquot was incubated for 15 minutes at temperatures ranging from room temperature (24\u00b0C) to 90\u00b0C and centrifuged to remove any precipitant. Samples of the initial extract and all assessed temperatures were analyzed by SDS-PAGE with coomassie staining. The initial extract contains multiple contaminating proteins, which remain after incubation at room temperature. Once the extracts are heated to at least 50\u00b0C the majority of contaminating proteins precipitate except for the target protein GRFT and the TMV coat protein. The composition of the extract remains similar with temperature treatments ranging from 50 -80\u00b0C, but at 90\u00b0C incubation nearly all proteins are precipitated.

GRFT extract aliquots were untreated (control) or treated with 0.1 M MgCl 2 and/or 10 mg/mL bentonite and all were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. Extracts were compared via SDS-PAGE with densitometry and again showed that the greatest reduction of TMV occurred in the 0.1 M MgCl 2 treatment group ( Figure 4A ). The pellets correlating to the specific treatments contained large amounts of TMV CP likely through forced aggregation and removal during centrifugation. Minimal loss of functional GRFT is observed in any of the treatment groups when compared via HIV-1 gp120 binding ELISAs ( Figure 4B ). When western blots targeting TMV CP were quantified by densitometry a reduction of 65% was observed in extracts treated with MgCl 2 , which is significantly decreased compared to the bentonite-only treated extract ( Figure 4C ). The table in Figure 4 shows GRFT purity in the four extracts ranges from 64 -82% with the TMV content of extracts treated with MgCl 2 reduced by as much as 66%.",

            "text": "In an effort to achieve greater than 95% purity of GRFT a chromatography step was explored. Extracts were heated to 55\u00b0C and treated with MgCl 2 or MgCl 2 and bentonite overnight after which they were filtered through a 0.2 \u03bcm filter and loaded onto a Capto\u00ae MMC column. The Capto\u00ae MMC resin is a multimodal cation exchanger that does not require buffer exchange and was chosen to help minimize purification steps. After chromatography trace amounts of TMV can be seen in SDS gels and western blots in both the untreatedcontrol and the MgCl 2 treated samples with no TMV contamination observed in the MgCl 2 and bentonite treated extract ( Figure 5 ). Purity of all extracts after Capto MMC chromatography was greater than 97%, with the bentonite and MgCl 2 treatment group showing a purity of >99% by SDS-PAGE densitometry. The recovery levels and activity of the purified GRFT were assessed by gp120 binding ELISAs with very good recovery levels achieved in all treatments undergoing MMC chromatography. A minimum of 84.5% was recovered in the MgCl 2 treated extract after it was purified by chromatography and a maximum recovery of 92.1% was observed in the control extract that was purified by chromatography ( Table 1) . All extracts maintained an activity level at least 80% of GRFT purified by the previously published method [4] , with GRFT purified by MgCl 2 & bentonite having 100.8 \u00b1 4.33% of the activity (Table 1 ). In summary, purification of GRFT from N. Utilizing the information yielded from small scale experiments GRFT was purified at an industrial pilot scale (>5 kg of plant material) in a GMP ready facility. At this scale it was necessary to replace all centrifugation steps with a filter press because of the impracticality of centrifugation at scale. Ten liters of extraction buffer was added to 5 kg of N. benthamiana and the tissue was ground to yield 11.4 L of initial extract containing 2599.73 mg of GRFT for a total of 519.9 mg of GRFT per kg of plant material ( Table 2 ). The extract was pH adjusted, heated, and filter pressed, which removed TMV CP and purified GRFT to >90% ( Figure 6 ). The remaining small protein contaminants were removed by overnight incubation with 10 mg/mL of bentonite and 0.1 M MgCl 2 and subsequent filter pressing. The extract underwent filter press and sterile filtration simultaneously and at this stage was >99% pure, and sterile with only minimal color. It should be noted that the purification process could be halted at this point depending on the application of the process and necessity for >99% pure colorless product. Capto\u00ae MMC chromatography was used to remove the color and simultaneously affect a buffer exchange into phosphate buffered saline pH7.4. Purity was maintained with greater than 99% purity of the final product and recovery of 66-72.25%, determined by densitometry of SDS-PAGE ( Figure 6 ) and gp120 ELISA respectively ( Table 2 ). Because of the GMP-ready nature of the purification scheme, endotoxin levels were assessed and found to be 0.20 EU/mL of final product with a GRFT concentration of 1.20 mg/mL, which should be sufficiently low depending on the dosage and administration route (Table 3 ). In summary, the purification method developed for GRFT herein provided a >99% pure product with >66% recovery while maintaining low endotoxin levels at industrial pilot scale and could be further scaled without modification to the process.",

            "text": "GRFT has been described as a promising topical microbicide component with potential to neutralize a broad range of viruses including HIV-1, Herpes simplex virus type 2, Japanese encephalitis virus, Hepatitis C virus, and SARS-CoV [1, 2, [10] [11] [12] . The safety and efficacy profile of GRFT as an HIV entry inhibitor was demonstrated in rabbits, on human cells, and in a sensitive murine HSV-2 susceptibilty assay [2, 4, 6] . A comprehensive set of highly promising data confirming the potential for use of GRFT in HIV prevention and even treatment, has led to considerable enthusiasm from policy makers and funders in bringing GRFT-based topical microbicides to clinical trial [2, 4, 6, [13] [14] [15] [16] . We have been motivated to improve and simplify the GRFT extraction protocol we initially developed [4] in anticipation of future need to manufacture extremely large amounts of this protein, preferably in geographic areas where the HIV-1 epidemic has the We previously produced GRFT in multi-gram quantities in N. benthamiana, but the purification methodology used required specialized ceramic filtration devices, two chromatography techniques, ultrafiltrationdiafiltration and had relatively low recovery from infected extracts, 30% possibly increasing to 50% [4] . Of the purification techniques we describe here, using a combination of heat (55\u00b0C), MgCl 2 & bentonite, and a single chromatographic step were most effective. This three step approach produced GRFT with no loss in activity or purity, while recovering nearly 90% of the extracted GRFT. Each step targets various contaminating proteins within the plant extract. Heating the extract at 55\u00b0C removes the majority of the native plant proteins, which lack the thermostability of GRFT. Exposing the extract to a combination of MgCl 2 and bentonite removes the TMV CP contaminant, originating from the TMV expression vector. Bentonite and MgCl 2 work in tandem, with bentonite known to strip coat protein from the TMV RNA and potentially the MgCl 2 causing either structural shifts in the RNA causing aggregation or cleaving the RNA causing aggregation [9, 17, 18] . Either mechanism is plausible for the aggregation of TMV in the plant extract. Our data shows the necessity of both MgCl 2 and bentonite to be present for optimal TMV removal when coupling to a single chromatography step. Utilizing Capto\u00ae MMC resin allows for removal of trace protein impurities by binding GRFT to the resin and eluting based upon the isoelectric point of the protein with unobservable amounts of TMV left in extracts treated with bentonite and MgCl 2 . Stripping of the CP from TMV likely reduces its ability to bind Capto\u00ae MMC resin and allows for less TMV contaminant binding and co-elution. All of the techniques, heating, cooling, pH adjustment, and chemical additives, used to purify GRFT are all facile, scaleable and amenable to technology transfer to facilities in resource poor countries. In an effort to demonstrate the scaleability and and amenability of technology transfer the process was performed at pilot scale in a GMP ready industrial facility with only slight reductions in the recovery, while providing pure active GRFT with low endotoxin levels. The methodology maintains increased recovery at scale, reducing per unit costs of GRFT, which should increase the availability of GRFT for HIV entry-inhibition in resource limited settings.",
