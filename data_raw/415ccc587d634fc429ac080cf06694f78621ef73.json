Donnelly et al. estimated the serial interval for all ILI (without laboratory confirmation) from case reports during the 2009 pandemic [25] . Only two studies of which we are aware explicitly consider the impact of virus type on infectiousness. Principi et al. found less onwards transmission to household members from influenza-negative than influenza-positive children presenting to a hospital emergency department [33] . Similarly, in a cohort study of ARI in young children, Lambert et. al. observed significant heterogeneity in the proportion of participants' households in which one or more illness events were observed (ranging from 13% for isolation of hMPV from the child to 61% for isolation of influenza) [34] .",

Study participants were randomized to receive either placebo or vaccine in a 1:2 ratio prior to the southern hemisphere 2008 influenza season. From an available pool of 5624 participants from the primary study at 12 study sites, we consider the 581 persons (adults) who experienced at least one ILI episodemeeting the case definition of at least one respiratory symptom (cough, sore throat, runny nose or nasal congestion) and at least one systemic symptom (fever (oral temperature \u2265 37.8\u00b0C), feverishness, chills or myalgia) [35] , and who provided written informed consent for participation in the nested cohort-study which required contribution of a valid biological sample (COPAN TM dry flocked swab). Samples were tested for a range of respiratory viruses using a combination of multiplexed and uniplexed conventional and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays [35] . Of those, 258 were members of multi-occupancy households, allowing investigation of transmission within the household. Using a non-specific and sensitive ILI definition, they reported an episode of ILI on 279 occasions. For each episode they returned a study questionnaire (Additional file 1) detailing respiratory symptoms (see [35] for details), health seeking behaviour (health care provider consultations, hospital admission, time off work), household characteristics (number of adults (\u226518 years) and children (<18 years)) and temporally associated symptoms of ILI (if any) in other household members.

We first consider infections to be related if symptoms are reported within 14 days following onset in the primary case. Across all virus-type isolations, we calculate a mean serial interval of 6.0 days (SD = 3.6) for all household ILI events (where the study participant was the primary case or otherwise), and 5.1 days (SD = 3.2) for the events in which the participant was the primary case. For the five events in which the primary participant had virologically confirmed influenza and transmission occurred, the mean serial interval was 4.5 days (SD = 1.6). If we limited the maximum serial interval to seven days, the mean was reduced to 4.0 days (SD = 1.7) for all household ILI events and 3.9 days (SD = 1.9) for events in which the ",

Of the 183 events in which our participant was the primary case, 6 were classified as co-introductions as (at least) one other household member recorded symptoms beginning on the same day. As the latent period for respiratory infections may vary from individual to individual, here we exclude a further 4 episodes in which there was a 1 day interval from onset of symptoms in the study participant to onset of symptoms in another household member. The resulting multivariate models (equivalent to Tables 1  and 2 ) are materially unchanged, with the expected slight reduction in statistical power (data not shown). A second assumption made was that, for participants who reported multiple ILI episodes during the study period, we only excluded the latter ILI episode where the same respiratory pathogen was isolated on both occasions. However, if we conservatively exclude all ILI episodes except for the first (10 episodes excluded (by virus type: 6 \"none\", 1 \"picornavirus\", 2 \"influenza\", 1 \"coronavirus\")), again we find no material change in either the logistic or Poisson analyses (data not shown).",

Behavioural differences whilst ill may drive such an observation. Alternatively, mechanisms by which influenza pathogenesis is sex dependent have been investigated [37] ; whether or not differences extend to infectiousness and susceptibility is not clear.

We explored this finding more deeply using a statistical interaction model. While somewhat limited by sample size, we found that in placebo recipients identification of influenza was not significantly associated with an increase in the number of secondary cases (IRR = 1.69 (0.421, 6.80), p = 0.459), while in vaccine recipients the IRR (relative to identification of any other virus, including 'none') was 5.24 (2.17, 12.6) , p < 0.001. Note that our previous analysis confirms that vaccination is associated with a reduced probability of influenza virus identification [35] . Additionally, 'breakthrough' influenza cases have similar symptoms compared to unvaccinated individuals [35] . We therefore suggest that our finding of increased transmission may be explained by infection with an influenza virus mismatched to the vaccine-strain (known to be in circulation during the year of study [40] ), which furthermore may be relatively antigenically novel and to which household members may be expected to have heightened susceptibility. With no virological samples available from other household members and the small number of vaccinated participants who were infected with influenza we are unable to explore this hypothesis further.",

While others have partially accounted for these effects [25, 29, 41] , a mechanistically-motivated statistical model is required to fully account for such possibilities, for example as introduced by Cauchemez et al.

Ideally, a protocol such as that suggested by Klick et al. would have been employed [42] . The lack of virological assessment of household secondary cases and the broad nature of the question used to establish the secondary case count in each house also contributes to uncertainty with regards to our assignment of temporally associated ILI to within-household transmission. Both of these limitations were an unavoidable consequence of the nesting of the data-collection protocol within a randomized placebo-controlled trial. Furthermore, due to the requested timing for completion of the questionnaire, we cannot exclude the possibility that late onset of secondary (or tertiary etc.) cases may have been missed, particularly if a participant's experience of symptoms was of short duration. Similarly, because the study protocol and analyses effectively assume that individuals are infectious until the end of their symptoms, any systematic differences (by virus type) in this relationship may influence the results. However the prompt to return the diary upon symptom cessation was in an effort to ensure timely reporting of questionnaire information to minimise recall bias. Conversely, our Poisson model implicitly assumes independence among household members, attributing all household infections to the primary case. More advanced model based methods that account for tertiary (and subsequent) cases and community introduction would be warranted with more complete data sources.",

Female sex of the participant was associated with increased transmission: 30 of 108 (27.8%) episodes in women compared to 9 of 69 (13.0%) episodes in men, a risk ratio of 2.13 (1.08, 4.21), p = 0.021.
