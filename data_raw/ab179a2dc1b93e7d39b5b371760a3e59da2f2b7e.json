            "text": "Background: Rotavirus (RV) infection in neonates can be mild or even asymptomatic. In RV infection, jaundice is often reported, but the relationship between jaundice and RV infection has not been studied. This study aimed to determine the importance of asymptomatic RV screening in neonates with jaundice. Methods: Neonates from the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of Chonbuk National University Hospital, those transferred from local obstetrics and gynecology hospitals and outpatient clinics were selected from 2014 to 2017. The study included only infants aged between 3 and 28 days. Jaundice was defined according to gestational age and birth age, in accordance with the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines criteria. RV infection was confirmed by a stool test, and RV screening and laboratory tests were performed at admission. Results: Among 596 patients, 166 patients had jaundice. RV infection was observed in 70 (42%) jaundice patients. There were 36 (22%) jaundice patients with asymptomatic RV infection. Patients with onset of jaundice 3-7 days after birth had a high incidence of RV infection. When the RV test was positive, the risk of jaundice was significantly high [odds ratio (OR) 1.89; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.20-2.98; p = 0.006]. Conclusions: Infants with the onset of jaundice > 3 days after birth were likely to have RV infection. Therefore, we suggest that screening tests for RV infection be included as part of the evaluation of jaundiced infants presenting to NICU.",

Only patients aged 3-28 days at the time of admission were included in the study, to exclude patients within the incubation period of rotavirus and early jaundice due to blood type incompatibility. Patients were excluded from the study if they died within 3 days of admission or if there were no test results or records after admission. Finally, 596 patients were included in the analysis. During the study period, all admitted patients underwent RV screening tests and were screened daily for gastrointestinal symptoms. The demographic features that were evaluated included gestational age (GA), birth weight, small for gestational age, sex, age at admission, hospital day, mode of delivery, Apgar score (1 min/5 min), perinatal problems, and breastfeeding. Jaundice was diagnosed according to total bilirubin level and GA, in accordance with the American Academy of Pediatrics criteria [10] . Diarrhea was defined as the passage of unusually loose or watery stools, at least three times in a 24-h period (\u22653 times/day or \u2265 2-fold increase in the number of stools per 8 h) [11] . Diarrhea was ascertained by the nurse at the time of admission, and by the nurse and doctor if the symptoms occurred after admission. Frequent passing of formed stools was not considered diarrhea. Babies fed only breast milk often pass loose, \"pasty\" stools; this was also not considered diarrhea. Vomiting was defined as the forceful expulsion of gastric contents occurring at least once in a 24-h period and without a respiratory or structural gastrointestinal tract cause [12] . Fever was defined as an axillary temperature of \u226538\u00b0C. Perinatal problems included premature rupture of membranes, maternal diabetes mellitus, maternal thyroid disease, and maternal infection. Antibiotics were used during the period of hospitalization. Late-onset sepsis was considered when infection was detected in blood and cerebrospinal fluid cultures 7 days after delivery, caused by postnatal acquisition (with nosocomial or community sources) of the pathogen. In addition, respiratory viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was screened at the time of admission. Patients who tested positive for rotavirus were maintained on conservative therapy, such as fluid therapy and phototherapy until the stool test yielded negative findings in the isolation room.",

The mean age of the study population was 11.4 \u00b1 0.3 days. The mean birth weight was 3230.6 \u00b1 508.3 g, and 338 (56%) infants were male and 258 (44%) were female. Among all patients, 166 (27.9%) were diagnosed with jaundice. The number of patients diagnosed with RV infection was 177 (29.7%). There was no significant seasonal variation in this study period. Table 1 presents the demographic characteristics of patients with and without jaundice. There was no significant difference between the two groups for GA, birth weight, small for gestational age (SGA), sex, Apgar score, and perinatal problems. Perinatal problems included two cases of maternal diabetes mellitus, two cases of maternal thyroid disease, and 32 cases of premature rupture of membranes (PROM).

The rate of exclusive breastfeeding was significantly higher in the jaundice group than in the non-jaundice group [29.5% (49/166) vs. 16 .5% (71/430), respectively, p = 0.001]. Table 2 presents a comparison of the factors that may affect jaundice. Reticulocyte counts demonstrated a significant difference of 2.3% \u00b1 0.2% in the jaundice group and 1.9% \u00b1 0.1% in the non-jaundice group (p = 0.029). Total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, and Hb levels were significantly higher in the jaundice group than in the non-jaundice group (p = 0.001). CRP level was significantly different in the jaundice group at 2.1 \u00b1 0.4 mg/L and non-jaundice group at 7.2 \u00b1 0.9 mg/L (p = 0.001). In the jaundice group, the RV infection rate was 70 (42%) and that of asymptomatic RV infection was 36 (21%), which was significantly different from the non-jaundice group (p = 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in late-onset sepsis between the two groups. Respiratory PCR demonstrated a significant difference of 6 (3.6%) in the jaundice group and 61 (14.2%) in the non-jaundice group (p = 0.001). Among the 166 patients with jaundice, 63 (37.9%) used antibiotics. Table 3 present the jaundice and bilirubin levels in neonates with positive and negative RV infection. There was no difference in direct bilirubinemia with the presence of RV infection in the jaundice group. The total bilirubin level at \u226415 mg/dL was higher in the rotavirus positive group than in the rotavirus negative group (27.1% vs. 13.5%, respectively; p = 0.028).

The prevalence of jaundice was 27.8% among all patients admitted to NICU, and among jaundiced patients, 42.2% had positive tests for RV infection. In addition, 22% of jaundiced patients demonstrated asymptomatic RV infection. The incidence of jaundice was higher in the RV-positive group. RV is now known to be an important causative agent of hospital infections. An electrophoretic analysis revealed that 41% of RV infections occur during winter and 30% of asymptomatic infections occur in other seasons [16] . In addition, other reports on RV infection in neonates suggested a high infection rate with few signs or symptoms [17] . Only 14 (23%) infants infected with RV experienced fever, vomiting, and diarrhea [12] . Several factors have been proposed to be responsible for asymptomatic RV infection observed in neonates, including host features such as physiological immaturity of the neonatal gut, the role of maternal antibodies, and virulence characteristics of the unique neonatal strains. It is known that asymptomatic infants usually develop asymptomatic infections due to the newborn strain, which is completely different from the RV strain found in pediatric patients, but it is known to cause diarrhea, dehydration, jaundice, metabolic acidosis, necrotizing enteritis, and even death [18] . Identifying neonates who are infected with RV is important for infection control in the NICU. The prevalence of RV in hospitals is high, but once mass incidence occurs, it is difficult to block transmission, despite proper patient isolation [19] . Moreover, most infected neonates have no specific enteritis symptoms and go through an incubation period. Therefore, infants with asymptomatic jaundice caused by RV infection should be screened for rapid isolation.",

It is the main reason for hospital readmission during the neonatal period and has long been recognized as a clinical manifestation of infection in the neonate and early infancy [7] . It is known that various infections such as neonatal sepsis, congenital infection, and hepatitis are risk factors for neonatal jaundice. Previous studies have demonstrated that urinary tract infections were associated with jaundice, but there is no such study on RV [8, 9, 20, 21] . In our study of the jaundice group, total bilirubin levels were less than 15 mg/dL in the rotavirus infection group.",

            "text": "Rotavirus-induced jaundice did not increase the total bilirubin level more than in other causes. In addition, rotavirus infection is diagnosed early in the disease because it can be screened before other causes. Besides RV infection, neonates born at term, born via vaginal delivery, those who are exclusively breastfed, and who have high Hb were at high risk in this study. Breastfeeding was associated with neonatal jaundice that lasted longer and reached higher peak levels than milk feeding [21] . Jaundice in breastfed babies usually appears between 24 and 72 h after birth, peaks by 5-15 days of life, and disappears by the third week of life; high bilirubin levels have been reported in such infants [22] . While exclusive breastfeeding has historically been an important predictor for jaundice, the mechanism underlying the association is not well understood. Our results demonstrate that vaginal delivery was associated with jaundice. The present findings indicate that naturally delivered neonates were more likely to have jaundice than those born via cesarean section. Previous studies have shown that the risk of jaundice increases in children delivered via cesarean section [5] . Similar to our study, Bulbul et al. [23] reported a statistically significant correlation between the severity of jaundice and mode of delivery. However, other studies have yielded controversial results regarding the relationship between labor and jaundice. Some studies demonstrated a lack of significant relationship between mode of delivery and jaundice [24] .",

Although the RIDASCREEN\u00ae RV test has high sensitivity to RV infection, there is a possibility of false positives in the RV test results. Therefore, asymptomatic RV-positive patients can have false-positive results. In addition to the exclusion of 1159 (66%) patients, we excluded patients in the incubation period of rotavirus; this difference may lead to selection bias of the included patients or incorrect risk estimates. However, our study was also meaningful in that all patients admitted to the NICU were screened for RV infection.",
