The role of SLC10A1 polymorphisms, particularly the Ser267Phe variant (rs2296651) in exon 4, has been frequently investigated in regard to risk of persistent HBV infection. However, these investigations have generated conflicting results. To examine whether common genetic variation at the SLC10A1 locus is associated with risk of persistent HBV infection, haplotype-tagging and imputed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were assessed in two case-control sample sets, totally including 2,550 cases (persistently HBV infected subjects, PIs) and 2,124 controls (spontaneously recovered subjects, SRs) of Southern Chinese ancestry. To test whether rare or subpolymorphic SLC10A1 variants are associated with disease risk, the gene's exons in 244 cases were sequenced. Overall, we found neither SNPs nor haplotypes of SLC10A1 showed significant association in the two sample sets. Furthermore, no significant associations of rare variants or copy number variation covering SLC10A1 were observed. Finally, expression quantitative trait locus analyses revealed that SNPs potentially affecting SLC10A1 expression also showed no significant associations. We conclude that genetic variation at the SLC10A1 locus is not likely a major risk factor of persistent HBV infection among Southern Chinese.",

NTCP is a multiple transmembrane glycoprotein presumed to span the cellular membrane up to 10 times with small extracellular loops 12 . NTCP is mainly expressed in hepatocyte, where it acts as a hepatic Na + /bile acid symporter and is responsible for cotransportation of sodium and bile acids across cellular membranes to maintain the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids 13 . Recently, Yan et al. have reported that NTCP is a functional receptor for HBV and its satellite hepatitis D virus (HDV) 14 . They used a combination of advanced purification and mass spectrometry analysis to show that the NTCP on the surface of the primary liver cells from treeshrews interacts with the pre-S1 domain in HBV. When the SLC10A1 gene was silenced in liver cells of both human and treeshrew origin, HBV infection was greatly reduced. Moreover, transfecting HepG2 cells with SLC10A1 from humans and treeshrews would make these cells gain susceptibility to HBV and HDV infection. Similarly, although monkey and mouse are not susceptible to HBV, replacing amino acids 157-165 of the monkey NTCP or 84-87 of the mouse NTCP with their human counterparts was enough to make the NTCP a functional receptor for the viruses [14] [15] [16] .",

Considerable attention has been focused on a common polymorphism rs2296651 (p.Ser267Phe, c.800G > A) in exon 4 of the SLC10A1 gene. The Ser267Phe variant has normal cell surface expression but results in loss of bile salt uptake and HBV receptor function [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . However, previous association studies on Ser267Phe and HBV infection have generated conflicting results [21] [22] [23] [24] . Furthermore, candidate regulatory variants, haplotype-tagging SNPs (htSNPs) or variants across the entire region of SLC10A1 have been assessed to determine the effects of them on risk of HBV infection [24] [25] [26] . Overall, evidence for the association of these variants with HBV infection is mixed, and need to be investigated further in independent and large cohorts as replication is an important approach to verify any significant genetic association findings 27, 28 . For example, as the minor allele frequency of Ser267Phe is ~7.5% in people of Chinese origin [21] [22] [23] [24] , the association between the variant and risk of persistent HBV infection, if confirmed or negated, bears important public health implications for molecular targeted treatment and prevention of the disease.",

Reanalyzing the genotype data of the 1000 Genomes Project showed that the frequency of rs148467625 is low in the Southern Han Chinese population (MAF = 0.015), and this SNP may not exist in the Northern Han Chinese population and other ethnic populations. We then genotyped rs148467625 in the Sample Set 1 (Methods). The results showed that the MAF of rs148467625 in the Guangxi population is 0.015, similar to it's MAF in the Southern Han Chinese population of the 1000 Genomes Project and the previous reports 21, 24 .

There was, moreover, no evidence of a disease-associated haplotype in this region. CNV encompassing SLC10A1 also does not play a major role in susceptibility to persistent HBV infection. Furthermore, the results of neutral theory test suggest that the SLC10A1 locus is under neutral selection, consistent with the results that none of the variants at the SLC10A1 locus were associated with the risk of persistent HBV infection. Finally, eQTL analyses indicated that genetic variation is not likely to be a major risk factor of this disease through long-range regulating SLC10A1 expression. Overall, there is no evidence that genetic variation at SLC10A1 is likely to be a major risk factor of persistent HBV infection among Southern Chinese. To our best knowledge, this is the first thorough research of the genetic association between SLC10A1 and susceptibility to persistent HBV infection.",

First of all, in the present study, we selected the spontaneously recovered subjects (i.e., previously exposed patients) but not the unexposed subjects as controls, so our results may be more reliable than other reports in which general blood donors were recruited as controls. Because unexposed subjects remain at risk of acquiring persistent HBV infection, the inclusion of such controls limits the ability to compare frequency of variants in them to that in patients with established persistent HBV infection. Second, most of our HBV persistent carriers and subjects with nature HBV clearance came from systematic screening of HBV markers in large, population-based studies or routine physical examination in local hospitals and was matched on age and sex, which may have reduced potential selection bias. Finally, a relatively large sample size (totally 2,550 cases and 2,124 controls) in this study provided enough statistical power, > 90% at significance level of 0.01, to detect an allele with a MAF of 0.20 that confers an additive 1.2-fold effect on disease risk (Supplementary Figure 5) .",

Among them, a nonsynonymous SNP Ser267Phe, with MAF ~7.5% in people of Chinese origin and nearly absent in non-Asian ethnic populations, leads to a near complete loss of bile acid transport activity via loss of substrate specificity for bile acids 18 , and to reduced HBV infection 17 . Recently, two large cohort studies have reported that the Ser267Phe variant was associated with resistance to HBV infection among Chinese of Guangdong (under multiple models of inheritance) and Taiwan (only under the recessive model), respectively. However, in the present study with large number of participants recruited also in southern China, Ser267Phe was not significantly associated with risk of persistent HBV infection (the lowest P value = 0.031, before adjustment for multiple testing under the recessive model in the pooled population, Supplementary Table 2 ). Even if Ser267Phe is regarded as a protective factor against persistent HBV infection when considering the marginal association (P = 0.031), the population attributable fraction (PAF) indicated that only 5.5% (95% CI, 0.15-39.2%) of the decrease in the risk of persistent HBV infection can be attributed to the protective effect of the Ser/Ser genotype in this study (methods). Therefore, the inconsistent results across studies suggest that Ser267Phe may be not involved, or at best play a minor role, in decreased susceptibility to persistent HBV infection.",

There may be a small, population-specific effect of SLC10A1 polymorphisms on the risk of persistent HBV infection. This might occur if there were population differences in linkage disequilibrium (LD) pattern or allele frequencies of SLC10A1. Indeed, the allele and genotype frequencies of the SLC10A1 polymorphisms vary with ethnicity. For instance, in the 1068 control subjects of the Sample Set 1 (Southern Chinese), we found that the frequencies of the 267Ser allele and Ser/Ser genotype were 0.10 and 0.0077, while in non-Asian population of the 1000 Genomes Project, the frequency of the 267Ser allele was extremely low, being 0 and 0.0016 in European and African populations, respectively. Furthermore, no 267 Ser alleles were found in more than 6000 non-Asian samples of the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project (Data release: ESP6500SI-V2, http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/).

To test whether the frequency spectrum of mutations conformed to the expectations of the standard neutral model, we calculated the values of two test statistics: (1) Tajima's D statistic, which considers the difference between \u03b8 w and \u03c0 , and (2) Fay and Wu's H statistic, which considers the difference between \u03b8 H and \u03c0 . Under neutrality, the two test statistics should be close to 0. Furthermore, Fu and Li's D statistic was used to compare the observed number of singleton polymorphisms with those expected under a neutral model.",

PLINK software was used to obtain association P-values and to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Meta-analyses of data generated from the Sample Set 1 and Sample Set 2 were conducted to assess pooled genetic effects. Meta-analyses were performed using the fixed-effects model (Mantel-Haenszel model) as heterogeneity was low (the value of the I-squared statistic was below 50%). The regional plot was plotted using an in-house program. To analyze the association of haplotypes, we used the haplo.stats package (version 1.7.7) 56 of R. P values for each haplotype were given by the results of a score test, and ORs and 95% CIs were calculated from coefficients of GLM model. ORs of each haplotype were calculated relative to the major haplotype. All of these statistical values were calculated by the function haplo.cc of the haplo.stats package.",

Genomic locations of genes on the NCBI Build 37 human assembly were adapted from the University of California at Santa Cruz Genome Browser (http://genome.ucsc.edu/). The LD structure surrounding the SLC10A1 gene in Chinese CHB and CHS samples of the 1000 Genomes Project was shown.
