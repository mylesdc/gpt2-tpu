Some of these viruses were closely related to known viruses while others were more distantly related with 70% or less identity to currently known/ sequenced viruses. Besides detecting viruses, the technique also allowed the characterisation of host mitochondrial DNA present and thus identifying host species, while ribosomal RNA sequences provided insight into the \"ribosomal activity microbiome\"; of gut parasites; and of food eaten such as plants or insects, which we correlated to non-avian host associated viruses.",

Virus communities (viromes) are structurally and functionally diverse and distinct to habitats in hosts and environments, and prior to VM there was limited understanding of the virome present in human and non-human hosts. Now with the growing use of VM, information on eukaryotic viruses, prokaryotic viruses and even viruses that infect other viruses are increasing 1-5 . The objectives of the physical preparation of samples for metagenomic sequencing of viruses are (i) to eliminate as many nucleic acids from the host and other elements like bacteria, fungi, parasites and, (ii) to ensure that as much of the virus nucleic acids are retained during the entire process and (iii) to generate good quality NGS reads.",

Among such proposed protocols, one designated NetoVIR by N et al. 6 was optimised on mock communities and later tested on actual and complex biological samples by the same research group 11-13 . The latter testing was performed without spiking the biological samples with known viruses, which would have served as a useful positive control to validate the protocol. As the overall aim of our project was to detect and characterise viruses in faecal samples from wild birds in Australia, we initially evaluated and compared the existing protocol (NetoVIR), including some additional modifications, and determined the optimum procedure for robust virus detection and characterisation in spiked and non-spiked bird faecal samples. Furthermore, we adopted the protocol downstream of the nucleic acid purification for library preparation and sequencing on the Ion Torrent platform. Using the optimised method, we identified viruses present in selected faecal samples from a Muscovy duck (designated as MUD) and a group of Pacific black ducks (designated as MAD) and from selected human faecal samples to show the broad applicability of the method. Finally, we demonstrate that additional information can be extracted from the sequencing reads, e.g. derived from mitochondrial DNA and ribosomal RNA present in the samples, allowing identification of host species, parasites present, food eaten and faecal bacterial populations present.

            "text": "In the MAD sample. Avian paramyxovirus 6 (APMV6). The MAD sample had many high-quality reads (Q32 or higher) that could be mapped to avian paramyxovirus type 6 (APMV-6 AB759118), a ssRNA virus belonging to the family Paramyxoviridae, with individual reads being 95-98% identical to AB759118 (APMV-6 red-necked stint-Japan-2008) 15 . We assembled several areas of good coverage including 459 nucleotides of the polymerase gene (coverage , 1839 nucleotides covering the complete hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) gene (coverage 5-103) and 651 nucleotides of the fusion (F) gene (coverage [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . For the polymerase gene, the similarity was 447/459 (97.3%) and 444/459 (96.7%) to AB759118 (APMV-6 red-necked stint-Japan-2008) 15 and GQ406232 (APMV-6 duck-Italy-07) 16 , but only around 75% similar to the other known lineage of APMV-6, the so-called Hong Kong 1977 lineage 17 [ Fig. 2 and Table 4 ]. For the HN gene, the similarity was 1787/1839 (97.1%) and 1785/1839 (97.0%) to AB759118 (APMV-6 red-necked stint-Japan-2008) and GQ406232 (APMV-6 duck-Italy-07), but only around 71% similar to the other known lineage of APMV-6 [ Fig. 3 and Table 5 ]. For the fusion gene, the similarity was 631/651 (96.9%) and 630/651 (96.7%) to AB759118 (APMV-6 red-necked stint-Japan-2008) and GQ406232 (APMV-6 duck-Italy-07), but only around 73% similar to the other known lineage of APMV-6 [ Fig. 4 and Table 6 ]. Thus, the APMV-6 present in our sample from the Australian juvenile Pacific black ducks (MAD) was closely related to the red-necked stint-Japan-2008 and duck-Italy-07 lineage of APMV-6 and only distantly related to the other major lineage of APMV-6. Furthermore, our Australian APMV-6 also has an additional basic amino acid around the fusion protein cleavage site, REPR-L rather than PEPR-L, characteristic for the Japan/Italy 2007/2008 lineage of APMV-6 17 . APMV6 sequences covering other regions of the APMV6 genome similarly found that the virus belonged to the Japan-Italy lineage [Figures S1.1-S1. 23 and Table S1 .1-S1. 23 The virus family and its characteristics are shown. We identified these viruses using the reference sequences mentioned in column 4 to which the NGS reads were mapped. We found how much the reads of our viruses are identical to the closest virus from the NCBI dataset using MEGA 6 or 7 software. However, for individual reads generated by NGS, we used BLASTN to identify the closest virus from the NCBI dataset. Their likely source of origin in our sample was determined using the NGS reads generated and correlating them from literature. -paramyxovirus-6large-polymerase-protein-459nt-Q32-C-9-192-2016   MAD-APMV6-Pol-459nt  9-192  459  32  MH000419   3 and 5   MAD-Avian-paramyxovirus-6hemagglutinin-neuraminidase-1839nt-Q32-C-5-103_2016   MAD-APMV6-HN-1839nt  5-103  1839  32  MH000415   4 and 6  MAD-Avian-paramyxovirus-6-fusionprotein-651nt-Q32-C-2-8-2016  MAD-APMV6-FP-651nt  2-8  651  32 Two large contigs of 14822 and 8322 nucleotides and two smaller contigs spanning parts of the deltacoronavirus Orf1ab replicase gene and the S1-S2 (Spike) and E, M and NS6 genes were obtained from the assem-blerSPAdes analysis, and the NGS reads mapped to these contigs using the TMAP assembler to determine the coverage depth. From further analysis, we initially selected an area of 1131 nucleotides (coverage 290-1700) from the Spike gene and 2121 nucleotides (coverage 39-1266) from the Orf1ab gene which overlaps with NSP7, NSP8, NSP9 and NSP10. These sequences were then analysed using MEGA and aligned with ClustalW by codons. For the selected Spike gene segment alignment, the deltacoronavirus sequence had a 738/1131 nucleotides ( We then expanded the analysis to larger areas of these mapped contigs (Q value at 20 or above and coverage of at least 5 and for some areas up to 6400), dividing areas into open reading frames (to avoid stop codons and thus making Clustal W codon based alignment possible). For all selected areas, the Wigeon coronavirus JQ065058 was the closest related sequence, and the percentage identities to the Wigeon and other related deltacoronavirus sequences at the nucleotide and amino acid levels are shown in Table 7 . Selected phylogenetic trees are shown in Virus related to goose adenovirus 4 (GoA4) and duck adenovirus 2 (DuA2). A dsDNA virus belonging to the family Adenoviridae and approximately 75-86% identical to goose adenovirus 4 (JF510462) from Hungary 20 and duck adenovirus 2 (KR135164) from China 21 was found in the MAD faecal sample. The assembled sequences were analysed further including a 279 nucleotides area of the IVa2 protein coding region (Q20 or higher, coverage 4-69), a 177 nucleotides area of the IU34_gp11 gene (Q20 or higher, coverage 21-261) and a 114 nucleotides area of the IU34_gp21 gene (Q32 or higher, coverage . We found the similarity of assembled sequences to be 229/279 nucleotides (82%) match to the GoA4 and 210/279 nucleotides (75.26%) match to the DuA2 [ Fig. 8 Table 3 . Description of the sequences on the representative phylogenetic trees generated for four selected viruses analysed using MEGA 6 or 7 software. The table gives details of the sequences used for phylogenetic analysis by the Maximum Likelihood method of APMV6, DCoV, AV and HCLV1. The first half of the table for each virus provides details to identify the sample from which the virus was isolated, protein encoded by the consensus sequences that are being analysed, the length of the consensus sequences and gene being analysed, minimum mapping quality threshold used in IGV for the generation of the consensus sequences, the coverage of the consensus sequences from IGV, the year of collection of the sample and the NCBI accession number assigned to the particular consensus sequence. Corresponding short names have been used in the phylogenetic trees which contain the sample, virus, protein and the number of nucleotides. The second half of the table for each virus provides the details of the sequences that were used for the comparative molecular phylogenetic analysis. They were found to be the most closely related sequences to the consensus sequences generated using BLASTN. Corresponding short names have been used in the phylogenetic trees which contain the NCBI accession number, virus and the country of collection. The collection date is given as retrieved from the corresponding NCBI nucleotide reference dataset which together with the country of collection can provide an insight into the possible evolution of the virus through the years. Rotavirus G. The faecal sample from the Pacific black ducks had good quality individual reads (Q32 or higher) with 80-89% identity to Rotavirus G chicken segment 2 (NC021580) and 4 (JQ920005) (Note: Designated as segment 4 as per the submitted NCBI reference sequence, but appear to be VP3 and possibly segment 3) isolated from Germany 22 and Rotavirus G pigeon segment 1 and 8 (KC876010 and KC876006 respectively) isolated from China 23 . Rotavirus G is a segmented, dsRNA virus belonging to the Reoviridae family. For this virus, good coverage of 3 or higher with a mapping quality threshold of 20 or higher was not obtained. To the best of our knowledge, these sequences are the first assembled reads of a Rotavirus G from Australia. Hence, to undergo a phylogenetic analysis of the virus, the mapping quality threshold was dropped to 10 or higher to get coverage of 3 and above. Three regions each from segment 1, 3/4 and 8 with individual areas being a 230-nucleotides The evolutionary history was inferred by using the Maximum Likelihood method based on the Tamura 3-parameter model 70 . The tree with the highest log likelihood (\u22125515.26) is shown. The percentage of trees in which the associated taxa clustered together is shown next to the branches. Initial tree(s) for the heuristic search were obtained automatically by applying Neighbor-Join and BioNJ algorithms to a matrix of pairwise distances estimated using the Maximum Composite Likelihood (MCL) approach, and then selecting the topology with superior log likelihood value. The rate variation model allowed for some sites to be evolutionarily invariable ([+I], 54.95% sites). The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths measured in the number of substitutions per site. The analysis involved 8 nucleotide sequences. Codon positions included were 1st+2nd+3rd+Noncoding. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated. There were a total of 1842 positions in the final dataset. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA7 63 .",

The virus seems to be non-pathogenic to chickens but can cause mild respiratory disease and a drop in egg production in turkeys 41 . While only distantly related to the Hong Kong lineage of APMV6 mentioned above, the APMV6 detected in the MAD faecal sample is around 95-98% identical to another lineage of APMV6 isolated from Japan 15 and Italy 16 in the year 2008 and 2007, respectively. Interestingly, the detection of the genetically similar APMV6 in Japan was from a red-necked stint (Calidris ruficolis), a migratory bird species which breeds in the Arctic, but migrates in the non-breeding season as far south as New Zealand and Southern Australia including the location from which the APMV6 from this study was collected. The fusion protein of the paramyxoviruses directs the membrane fusion 42 and paramyxoviruses where the fusion protein cleavage site does not possess the furin recognition site (RXK/RR-F) are usually limited to the respiratory tract, and hence the sequence at this site contributes to the virulence of these viruses 42, 43 . The sequences of the fusion protein in our APMV6 from the MAD faecal sample has an additional basic amino acid around the fusion protein cleavage site (REPR-L) characteristic for the Japan/Italy 2007/2008 lineage as compared to the Hong Kong lineage of APMV-6 17 and hence any further changes at this site could potentially make the virus highly virulent.",

The gammacoronavirus detected in the MAD faecal sample was more closely related to the duck gammacoronavirus from China in 2014 18 than to the other gammacoronavirus sequences available. While we observed more than 96% identity in the Orf1ab polyprotein gene, the Spike gene identity was only 89-92% to the duck gammacoronavirus. For the deltacoronavirus detected in the MAD sample, the closest relative was the wigeon deltacoronavirus from Hong Kong collected in 2008 19 . The Spike protein of the coronaviruses mediates the entry of the virus particles into cells, and mutations in or recombination of this region are important for host species specificity and potential cross-species transmissibility of the virus 42, 43 . These are the first wild bird coronaviruses from Australia to have their spike genes sequenced and further analysis to understand the relationship between wild bird coronaviruses is needed. A detailed study of the prevalence of coronaviruses among Australian wild birds (including the MAD sample) using PCR amplification of a small fragment of the Orf1ab gene with a detailed description and phylogenetic analysis of a small fragment of around 300 nucleotides is described elsewhere 46 . However, while that study did detect both gamma and deltacoronaviruses, the PCRs included were not able to detect coinfections (i.e. birds having both a gamma and a deltacoronavirus) while it is worth mentioning that such coinfection can be readily detected using our metagenomics method as evident from the NGS data generated in the present study.",

It is currently unclear whether the adeno-associated (parvo) virus detected in the MAD sample can replicate without helper virus or not, however, we consider it likely that the adenovirus (related to the DuA2 and GoA4 mentioned above) Scientific RepoRtS | (2018) 8:8686 | DOI:10.1038/s41598-018-26851-1 detected in the same sample, may act as a helper virus for enhanced replication as adeno-associated parvoviruses often need a helper virus for its replication 47 . As both viruses are present simultaneously and possibly enhance replication of the parvovirus present, this co-infection may be associated with disease in the host although this is currently speculative and will require further studies before any conclusion can be reached as to its significance in regards to the health of infected birds.",

Although infection with this particular serotype has not been considered fatal, infection from another rotavirus serotype such as Rotavirus A can be lethal to the birds in extreme cases 49, 50 . Even though rotavirus infections in avian species are associated with diarrhoea, cross-species transmission of the avian rotaviruses is usually very rare 49 . To the best of our knowledge, our sequences are the first assembled reads of a Rotavirus G from Australia and from a duck sample, which could explain why we had to drop the mapping quality threshold to 10 to get a coverage of 3 and above for the generation of consensus sequences. Nevertheless, even then, we were only able to generate consensus sequences for only segments 1, 3/4 and 8. We believe the sequences for one segment that matched to segment 4 of the NCBI reference (JQ920005) isolated from Germany 22 is in reality segment 3 as it encodes for the VP3 protein of the rotavirus, which universally is accepted to be part of segment 3. Nevertheless, it appears that the rotavirus detected in the MAD sample is a new rotavirus and may have included reassortment in its evolutionary history as we were only able to map 3 of the gene segments and they, in turn, mapped most closely to different reference sequences.",

Ngewotan virus (Nam Dinh like virus), Hubei chryso-like virus 1, Culex Negev-like virus 3 (Biggie/Goutanap virus-like) and a virus related to Hubei reo-like virus 7 detected and characterised in the MUD sample are recently identified in mosquitoes 1, 24 .

These viruses being RNA viruses, which can have high mutation rates due to the low polymerase fidelity 54 , a nearly 100% identity is rather interesting. The mode of travel of these viruses could be from birds that have eaten the infected mosquitoes and travel long distances and then could be depositing these viruses in their faeces. We also cannot rule out that the infected mosquitoes may be taken from one region to another by human means such as aircrafts, trains, vehicles or by the wind. Independent of mode, the close identity of these mosquito viruses from distant locations indicate that such viruses may be easily dispersed over great distances.",

For example, the APMV6 phylogenies suggest that despite Australian ducks not migrating, they still are part of the global circulation of duck viruses, and that migrating shorebirds may likely be the vector for such viruses entering and exiting from Australia. It is also noteworthy to mention that during the BLASTN search, except for the Hubei chryso-like virus 1, Ngewotan virus (Nam Dinh like virus) and Culex Negev-like virus 3 very recently described in Western Australia, none of the top matched sequences were to similar strains or related viruses from Australia.

Furthermore, the technique could be applied to different biological samples including saliva and tissue samples (data not shown) and be of use to medical and veterinary diagnostics. The \"ribosomal activity microbiome\" that was revealed using the optimised method may provide valuable information about the composition of live and active bacteria in faecal samples. Ribosomal RNA is partially protected from nuclease activity 59 , and as the optimised method allows ribosomes to be enriched together with the virus particles, the ribosomal profile of the faecal microbiome can also be investigated. These results provide a indication of the \"ribosomal activity microbiome\", i.e. the microbiome of active bacteria in the final deposited feces as active bacteria have a much higher number of ribosomes per bacteria (up to 70000 ribosomes or more per bacteria) than resting or dead bacteria (7000 or fewer ribosomes per bacteria) 60, 61 . Although the results based on this method cannot necessarily be directly compared to microbial assessment by 16 S DNA diversity profiling, understanding of the active bacteria may be important 62 .

For this purpose, we tested different enrichment techniques using various biophysical methods 6, 37, 38 . Six method variations from A to F with a different combination of virus enrichment techniques using various biophysical methods were carried out (Fig. 1 ) on the spiked MUD faecal sample. We took the already tested protocol called the NetoVIR 6 as our starting method for virus enrichment and designated it as 'variation C' . We used the MUD faecal sample and incorporated two additional potential enrichment steps to this method, being detergent treatment (variation A & B) and ultracentrifugation (variation A, D & F) and also tested filtration using 0.45 \u00b5m filters (variation E & F) as described, but not recommended as optimum on their mock community, by the authors of NetoVIR 6 .

The combination of biophysical enrichment techniques that maintained the maximum number and levels of marker viruses was selected to proceed for cDNA synthesis, amplification, library preparation and NGS.

Following elution, barcoded libraries were prepared using Ion Plus Fragment Library Kit and Ion Xpress Barcode Adapters 1-96 Kit as per the kit instructions. A 1.5X sample to bead ratio of the Agencourt AMPure Kit was used to purify the library. Then it was eluted in 20 \u00b5L of Low TE buffer. Quantification of unamplified libraries was performed as per the protocol from Ion Library TaqMan \u2122 Quantitation Kit using QuantStudio \u2122 6 Flex Real-Time PCR System. Based on the concentration estimated, the dilution that resulted in a concentration of ~100 pM was then calculated and made. Libraries were then pooled prior to loading onto Ion 530 Chips using the Ion Chef Instrument. Following template preparation, the chips were run on the Ion Torrent S5XL System (Thermo Fisher Scientific) as per company protocols. NGS and associated reactions were performed at the Geelong Centre for Emerging Infectious Diseases (GCEID), Geelong, Victoria, Australia. We ran NGS for the spiked MUD faecal sample for the variations C to F only once and generated around 3.4 million reads. Approximately 4 million reads were generated for the non-spiked MUD faecal samples on the first run during which it partly acted as a control, and 7 million reads generated for the MAD faecal sample. For further analysis, the MUD and MAD faecal samples were rerun, and about 9.5 and 7.1 million reads were generated respectively. However, NGS for the human samples were run only once as it was a demonstration of the optimised protocol only and about 7.1 million reads were generated. Next generation sequence analyses. Although the NGS data provided an insight into the virome of the bird faecal samples, we narrowed our focus to virus sequences that were somewhat similar to already known viruses, in most cases had good quality and quantity NGS reads, could serve as examples of the utility of the method, and/or were of interest from a virological point of view. All available virus sequences were downloaded from the NCBI GenBank genetic sequence database (May 2017), and a local BLAST database created. Bacterial plasmid sequences were downloaded from the NCBI Reference Sequence Database (RefSeq) repository and 16 S, 18 S, 23 S 25 S, 5 S and 5.8 S ribosomal sequences were downloaded from GenBank. These were used to create plasmid and ribosomal BLAST databases respectively. Virus sequences from the NCBI RefSeq database were downloaded and queried against the plasmid and ribosomal RNA databases using a megablast query and an e-value cut-off of 1 \u00d7 10 \u221210 . Any virus sequences which matched either plasmid or ribosomal sequences were removed, and the remaining virus sequences used to create a reference sequence virus BLAST database. The BLAST package version 2.6.0 from NCBI was used to create the local databases and perform the database queries.",

The contigs of deltacoronavirus from the MAD faecal sample and selected viruses from the human samples were then selected for more in-depth analysis using MEGA software 63 Phylogenetic analysis of selected virus sequences. Among the identified viruses, 10 viruses which provided good quality and coverage of the NGS reads mapped to NCBI virus genomes as references and also covered the different virus genome types (dsRNA, ssRNA, dsDNA and ssDNA viruses) were selected for more detailed analysis. For these viruses, NGS reads were further analysed using MEGA software 63 as previously described in our laboratory 64, 65 . To understand phylogenetic relationships among the virus sequences, they were compared to the NCBI database using nucleotide BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) 66, 67 and aligned using Clustal-W 68 and some cases using Clustal-W (Codons) or Muscle using the MEGA 6 or 7 software 63, 69 . Then the sequences were manually trimmed to put them in frame. Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic analyses were conducted using the MEGA 6 or 7 software 63, 69 , and the best model for generating a phylogenetic tree was determined (data not shown). The robustness of different nodes was assessed by bootstrap analysis using 1000 replicates for nucleotide alignments and 500 replicates for amino acid alignments.
