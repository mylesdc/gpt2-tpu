            "text": "Oral fluid (OF) samples are an aggregate sample composed of saliva and mucosal transudate, which may contain pathogens, antibodies to pathogens, or both, circulating in the herd. Collecting OF samples offers a convenient and unobtrusive mechanism for evaluating the health status of swine, especially those nearing slaughter and movement to slaughter-namely growing (grower) and market hog (finisher) herds. OF collection takes advantage of natural swine behavior. Samples are collected by hanging cotton ropes in one or more pens in a barn for pigs to chew for 20-30 minutes, causing minimal disruption of animal activities or farm operations [1] [2] [3] [4] . The ease of OF sample collection and the ability to obtain disease status information from an entire group with a single sample, combined with its widespread industry usage for endemic diseases, positions OF sampling as a strong methodology for on-farm surveillance of swine pathogens. Producers currently collect and submit OF samples to monitor disease status of barns or premises with minimal training and without added cost, constraints, and biosecurity concerns associated with veterinary or animal health technician farm visits. Diagnostic testing is currently performed on~30,000 OF samples per year at three high-volume laboratories representing more than 250 premises for domestic pathogens, including swine enteric coronavirus diseases (SECD), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), influenza A virus in swine (IAV-S) and others [5, 6] . Testing methodologies have been applied to OF samples collected from swine, including real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), solid-phase competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), virus isolation, sequencing, and double-antibody sandwich ELISA [7] . Much research has focused on the use of rRT-PCR, both single-plex and multi-plex; single-plex is the method considered for calculations in this evaluation. Diagnostic tests for other sample types have been developed for other diseases, including the foreign animal diseases considered in this evaluation: African swine fever (ASF), classical swine fever (CSF), and foot-and-mouth disease (FMD).",

            "text": "The sensitivity of an rRT-PCR testing protocol applied to OF samples is dependent on the matrix in which the target virus is found, host factors affecting the concentration or composition of the target virus, and non-host factors such as sample quality, which includes sample deterioration due to poor handling or excessive environmental contamination [8] . The matrix with the target virus may contain inhibitors that could prevent the assay from working. The abundance or concentration of the target virus in an OF sample is a host factor that depends on the organism concentration in an individual animal's oral fluid transudate, the number of animals chewing on the rope at collection time and shedding the virus in saliva, and the timeliness of the rope sampling relative to the virus shedding window. In a field setting, diseased animals may represent only a portion of the population in a particular pen of animals [9, 10] . Available information from a study on pigs experimentally infected with ASF, CSF, or FMD show that infected animals were observed chewing on ropes until severe clinical signs developed, concurrent with or after virus was detectable in OF samples [11] . Regarding the timeliness of rope sampling relative to shedding of virus, it is important to note that for all three diseases considered in this evaluation, the incubation and infectious periods vary depending on the strain of virus and its virulence [12] . From laboratory studies, ASF and FMD are detectable in OF samples before presentation of clinical signs and often concurrent to pyrexia [7, 11, 13, 14] . Detectable levels of CSF virus appear in OF samples at the same time or after presentation of clinical signs [11, 15, 16] . Mostly described for CSF, persistently infected animals may result from vertical transmission in-utero or infection shortly after birth. In such cases, distinct clinical signs may not be present, but animals will continue to shed virus without a detectable antibody response [17, 18] . Some strains of ASF and CSF may present with mild clinical signs indistinguishable from endemic diseases, complicating detection by clinical signs alone [18, 19] .",

These hypothetical applications are used to inform how this sampling modality might be applied for surveillance in an outbreak and for early detection in a disease-free setting as a screening test.

            "text": "We examined the hypothetical application, cost, and cost-effectiveness of information provided by OF sampling tested by rRT-PCR for ASF, CSF, or FMD surveillance in swine for four scenarios. Scenarios 1 and 2 encompass surveillance in disease outbreak situations while scenarios 3 and 4 encompass surveillance activities in the absence of an outbreak. Further, the first three scenarios (1, 2, and 3) were designed using example surveillance characteristics, and scenario 4 was evaluated based on current surveillance efforts for endemic disease (i.e., PRRS). These scenarios were evaluated to help understand how the sample and test type could integrate into surveillance planning. Characteristics used to inform the scenarios are outlined in the assumptions and characteristics section; some were based on current USDA FAD Preparedness and Response Plan documents for FMD and CSF [20, 21] . Scenarios 1 and 2. Outbreak surveillance assuming prevalence detection thresholds of 20% infected pens/barn, 33% infected barns/premises, and 2% premises per zone prevalence. We evaluated two potential surveillance schemes in response to an ASF, CSF, or FMD outbreak. In both cases, the sampling method could be applied to the zone(s) designated around each infected premises, but would vary based on the location of infected premises and overlap between multiple zones. Surveillance in these two zones was evaluated separately as scenario 1-outbreak surveillance to support classification of premises status in a control area (minimum 10km area located directly around an infected premises) and scenario 2 -outbreak surveillance within the surveillance zone (minimum 10km area that forms a ring around the control area) to show no evidence of infection because of differences in specific surveillance objectives required in these zones (objective evidence that a premises is not infected vs monitoring for disease spread outside the control area). Animal movement testing was not evaluated due to information limitations, the complexity of different movement scenarios, and the high number of movement scenarios. Scenarios 3 and 4. Early disease detection prior to clinical signs in a disease-free setting. Two additional scenarios assessed were early disease detection to estimate the sample size needed to meet 0.95 probability of detection, assuming prevalence detection thresholds of 20% pen, 33% barn, and 2% premises levels. We calculated the probability of detecting disease prior to clinical signs using two different testing frequencies of a representative number of OF samples from the U.S. swine population. Scenario 3 was evaluated with a sampling frequency of every 3 days for detection of at least one infected barn per premises. Scenario 4 was evaluated with sampling on a weekly basis, aligning with current industry practices used to monitor endemic diseases [2, 5] .",

The requirements for an effective testing regime are also impacted by temporal accuracy. Temporal accuracy depends on (1) the length of time the pathogen is shed in OFs at detectable levels in the sample and (2) whether sampling placement, frequency, and timeliness successfully target high-risk populations and periods.

There is currently no evidence on how persistently infected animals would relate to ASF or CSF detection in OF samples. Presumably, ASF or CSF persistently infected animals would be detected by OF sampling due to viral shedding without clinical signs; this assumption was used in the evaluation. For the scenarios evaluated, 3 days was assumed to be the number of days the testing could detect disease prior to clinical signs; this value falls within the range of both ASF and FMD.

The number of hogs in the example counties was divided by a typical barn size of 1,250 to 1,750 animals (50-70 pens in a barn and 25 swine per pen) to arrive at these estimates [2, 5] . Average number of barns per premises, pigs per pen, and number of premises in a control area or surveillance zone were calculated based on these characteristics for evaluation. Using the informed assumptions for the population information, we estimated that 25 to 50 premises would fall within a hypothetical control area and 75-150 premises would fall within the boundaries of a hypothetical surveillance zone. Based on a 2% prevalence detection threshold and 1,250 animals per barn, individual animal sampling would require at least 157 animals to be sampled per premises [20, 21] .

These models indicated that testing OF samples every 3 days plus monitoring for clinical signs detected disease prior to detection by clinical signs alone more than 95% of the time, while weekly testing of OF samples plus monitoring for clinical signs found disease prior to detection by clinical signs alone 41% of the time. Modeling with characteristics for a moderately virulent Paderborn strain of CSF [31] indicated that weekly testing of OF samples for CSF plus monitoring for clinical signs would provide a detection advantage compared to relying on clinical signs alone for disease detection. It is likely moderate virulence ASF or FMD would follow a similar pattern. Since sampling every 3 days is an ideal but highly intensive sampling frequency, scenario 4 was included to evaluate what level of detection could be achieved if sampling frequency reflected monitoring practices industry currently uses for endemic disease.

In our cost analysis, we did not estimate expenses resulting from any interruption to trade or business continuity but instead focused on the cost of OF sample and testing surveillance activities. Additionally, we calculated costeffectiveness for scenarios 1 and 2, for comparison to the current outbreak surveillance sample and testing plan. Surveillance sample initial and follow-up testing costs. The cost of testing the target number of samples is the per-sample cost multiplied by the sample size calculated for the determined objective. The cost per OF sample was estimated as $5.56 per collection kit [34] , $15 shipping and handling (assumption), and laboratory PCR testing fees of $32 to $35 per sample including possible accession fees [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] . The total estimated cost per OF sample tested ranges from $55.56 to $62.56. For simplicity, this evaluation used an estimated $50 per OF sample tested to cover the initial test expenses related to collection, shipping, and laboratory fees based on the assumption that a higher volume of testing could result in a lower persample cost. This is summarized in Table 3 . Samples with non-negative test results are shipped to NVSL for a follow-up test, which is assumed to have the same $50 cost. ASF, CSF, or FMD investigation and confirmatory testing costs. The per-sample cost is $71 for CSF confirmatory testing following the current testing protocol (Ab ELISA, immunoperoxidase, and immunoperoxidase virus neutralization) [21, 40] . The total estimated cost per sample collected and tested for ASF or FMD is approximately $140 following the current confirmatory testing protocol using RT-PCR and virus isolation testing costs [20, 40, 41] . For the scenarios in this paper, if an oral fluids sample has a non-negative result after follow-up testing at NVSL, an FAD investigation will be initiated and confirmatory testing will be performed at the NVSL Foreign Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory. The estimated value of 8 hours of VS employee time is $400 to complete an FAD investigation and ship samples to laboratories for each premises. As a result, the total cost of a false positive would be a minimum of $471 (CSF) to $540 (ASF or FMD), assuming that samples are collected from one animal during an epidemiologic investigation. These costs exclude any domestic business or trade impacts. These characteristics are summarized in Table 3 .",

Because OF samples provide aggregate information for the premises as a whole within either a control area or surveillance zone, the number of samples required every 5 days for the duration of the outbreak would be much lower for OF sampling (36-63 samples per premises) than for individual animal sampling (157 samples per premises) to achieve 0.95 detection probability at the 20% prevalence detection threshold. This difference translates to requiring OF sample levels of 23% to 40% of the individual animal sampling levels to acquire the same disease status information. Oral fluid sampling costs per premises (with three barns) per control area (scenario 1) range from $36,000 to $63,000 with a cost savings of $194,940 to $384,600, which is approximately 84% to 86% lower in cost. These estimates only include the cost of initial OF testing compared to using the current testing protocol, plus the cost of an epidemiologic investigation as a proxy for the cost to collect individual samples. These do not include any follow-up testing or FAD investigations started because of a nonnegative test result. Oral fluid sampling costs per premises (with 3 barns) per surveillance zone (scenario 2) range from $3,600 to $15,750 with a cost savings from $19,494 to $96,150, which is also approximately 84% to 86% lower in cost. When applied to testing multiple premises within a control area or surveillance zone, additional costs may be incurred to evaluate nonnegative test results depending on the strategy for handling false positives during an outbreak. (Table 4) Scenario 3. To achieve a goal of early detection through OF sampling and testing at a 0.95 probability of detection, premises level sampling would have to be performed approximately every 3 days for diseases such as ASF or FMD, given the short window of detection in OF samples prior to presentation of clinical signs. Depending on the test sensitivity, the number of samples required could range from 685,152 to 1,844,640 at a cost of between $34,257,600 and $92,232,000. With a test specificity ranging from 99 to 99.99%, the number of false positives to undergo follow-up testing would be expected to range from 69 to 18,447 with 0 to 185 additional tests for FAD investigations resulting in a combined cost of $3,450 to $1,022,250 for follow-up and confirmatory testing. Scenario 4. Currently, collection of OF samples for domestic disease testing is generally performed weekly, with an average of 10-16 samples per premises [5] . The average number of samples currently submitted to two large swine veterinary diagnostic laboratories per year is approximately 181,000, which we estimate costs $9,050,000. With a test specificity ranging from 99 to 99.99%, the number of false positives needing follow-up tests would be expected to range from 19 to 1,810 with 0 to 19 additional tests for FAD investigations resulting in a combined cost of $950 to $100,760. Scenario 4 requires 11% to 12% of the OF samples required for scenario 3, but can only detect 4% to 8% prevalence instead of the target of 2% premiseslevel prevalence every 3 days. The cost savings following scenario 4 range from $193,600 to $342,700, which is approximately 88% to 89% lower than scenario 3. 3 With the lower number of samples per barn, the ability to detect an infected premises is decreased compared to scenario 3. If the diagnostic test sensitivity is at the low end of the assumed range (0.62), a sample size of 10 ropes only provides a probability of 0.51 of detecting at least one infected premises when 2% of the premises are infected, with 20% of the pens infected per premises. If the test sensitivity is at the high end of the assumed range (0.95), a sample size of 16 ropes provides a probability of 0.76 of detecting at least one infected premises when 2% of the premises are infected, with 20% of the pens infected per premises.",

Many characteristics were derived from available literature and data sources, but we used assumptions to overcome some information gaps. For all scenarios except scenario 4, the prevalence detection threshold and detection probabilities were set at an ideal level. A lower level of prevalence detection threshold or detection probability using OF may still provide beneficial information at a lower total cost than current testing protocols. Of note, the diagnostic test sensitivity values on OF samples could be outside the range of values used in this evaluation. Lower published rRT-PCR sensitivity values can be found for influenza A virus in swine [42] and other tests used with endemic disease monitoring [43] . Additionally, this evaluation did not include an adjustment factor for field impacts from animal behavior, sample dilution, degradation, handling, and submission logistics. These factors could also lead to lower test parameter values. Since hypothetical test characteristics were used, the actual test utility will largely depend on the results of test validation studies, which could further guide scenario development, comparison, and drawing further conclusions.",

During an outbreak response, OF sample testing offers many advantages compared to individual animal sampling, including minimal disruption of animal and farm activities and a reduction in the number of samples required, thus reducing testing costs. In both scenarios 1 and 2, the cost-effectiveness ratio of aggregate OF samples is lower than individual animal sampling. Additionally, OF sample testing could decrease resource utilization. Given basic training, producers can collect and submit OF samples to emergency response officials at the premises line of separation; emergency response officials would not need to enter the farm. This approach could decrease resource costs associated with personal protective equipment, waste disposal, and personnel downtime between farms, minimizing potential contamination between premises by eliminating animal contact. Depending on the disease, OF sample testing may detect viral presence prior to, or concurrent with, clinical signs. This information could assist policymakers and incident commanders with more timely, cost-effective information upon which to base decisions. Because poor sample handling technique can decrease test sensitivity, a certification/training program on proper sample collection and packaging should be implemented for farm personnel, accredited veterinarians, veterinary paraprofessionals, and response officials. Such a program, outlined in the Secure Pork Supply Plan for Active Observational Surveillance [44] , would assist with outbreak preparedness and should lead to higher quality samples.",

Oral fluid sampling may be highly efficacious in this scenario if the benefit of preventing disease spread is greater than the cost of a short but intensive sampling scheme. Presuming use during an outbreak to assist in prioritization of incident response activities (e.g., to prioritize order of formal surveillance or inspection visits), the consequences of a false negative or positive are similarly constrained. Laboratory capacity could limit the application of any novel testing strategy if the number of samples generated by an outbreak exceeds laboratory capabilities. Regardless of the scale of an actual outbreak, OF collection is expected to generate fewer samples compared with individual animal sampling, thus decreasing testing costs and making more effective use of laboratory capacity. Once test validation information is known, further exploration of potential animal movement and continuity of business scenarios would also be informative.",

The early detection scenario was designed with a 0.95 probability of detecting at least one infected premises prior to clinical signs when infection is at 20% of a pen, 33% of a barn, and 2% among all premises. The scenario assumed sample collection occurred approximately every 3 days to detect disease prior to clinical signs, based on the window of detection in OF samples for ASF and FMD. This scenario could be modified to lower levels of sampling for different goals, which would still be useful in potentially detecting disease earlier than with passive surveillance alone while lowering overall cost, which was partially explored in scenario 4. The windows of detection for ASF, CSF, and FMD were extrapolated from laboratory experiments using high virulence strains, leading to rapid clinical progression of disease. The detection window with OF samples and progression of clinical signs are not as thoroughly documented when less virulent strains of ASF, CSF, or FMD are studied. Given the currently available data on highly virulent CSF detection in OF samples, it is unlikely this sampling and testing scenario fits a CSF rapid detection purpose because clinical signs, if seen at all, present at the same time as detectable virus in OF samples. If viral shedding in OFs occurs before detectable clinical signs for ASF, CSF, or FMD are observed, the frequency of sampling could be decreased.",

The SEIR modelling performed for this assessment, with characteristics for a moderately virulent strain of CSF (Paderborn strain), indicated there may be an advantage to weekly OF sampling and testing for CSF. It is likely ASF and FMD would follow a similar pattern if a low virulence strain or chronic form of the disease were introduced. However, given the results of this evaluation, the potential application of OF sampling for active surveillance as a large-scale early detection system would be costly. Scenario 4. This early detection scenario does not achieve a 0.95 probability of detecting at least one infected premises prior to clinical signs for the range of test sensitivities evaluated using common industry sample submission practices. A higher number of samples submitted per barn or sampling a greater number of premises could achieve 0.95 probability of detection. The scenario presented assumed that each premises collected samples weekly and that the submissions were distributed throughout a given week to temporally space submissions. This scenario represents a lower level of sampling than scenario 3, and may still detect disease earlier than passive surveillance alone with a lower overall cost. The greatest advantage would likely be realized for diseases with moderate or mild clinical signs, which can be difficult to detect or differentiate from other diseases with clinical signs alone (i.e., CSF or FMD). The cost-effectiveness for scenarios 3 and 4 could be compared to each other; however, the decreased costs associated with scenario 4 relative to 3 must be carefully balanced with the decreased level of detection capability demonstrated in these two scenarios.",

A benefit common to the scenarios is that OF sample testing for surveillance could contribute to emergency preparedness and response efforts directed toward ASF, CSF, or FMD in swine. Of the scenarios evaluated, OF sample testing may be most valuable in an outbreak setting, where the use of aggregate screening samples would minimize the disruption of animal and farm activities, reduce sample sizes, and decrease resource requirements compared to individual animal sampling regimens. Immediate broad implementation is not possible due to several limitations and information gaps. These include: (1) USDA validation of OF sample diagnostics for ASF, CSF, and FMD in swine is still underway, (2) information on test performance in a field setting is lacking, and (3) confirmatory testing of suspected false-positive OF sample findings may demand timeintensive or costly follow-up testing protocols (e.g., repeat on-farm sampling and/or next generation sequencing).",
