However, the practical uses are limited due to high costs and the risk of anti-drug antibody responses. Attempts to develop anti-TNF-\u03b1 vaccines have generated encouraging data in animal models, however, data from clinical trials have not met expectations. In present study, we designed a TNF-\u03b1 epitope-scaffold immunogen DTNF7 using the transmembrane domain of diphtheria toxin, named DTT as a scaffold. Molecular dynamics simulation shows that the grafted TNF-\u03b1 epitope is entirely surface-exposed and presented in a native-like conformation while the rigid helical structure of DTT is minimally perturbed, thereby rendering the immunogen highly stable. Immunization of mice with alum formulated DTNF7 induced humoral responses against native TNF-\u03b1, and the antibody titer was sustained for more than 6 months, which supports a role of the universal CD4 T cell epitopes of DTT in breaking selfimmune tolerance. In a mouse model of rheumatoid arthritis, DTNF7-alum vaccination markedly delayed the onset of collagen-induced arthritis, and reduced incidence as well as clinical score. DTT is presumed safe as an epitope carrier because a catalytic inactive mutant of diphtheria toxin, CRM197 has good clinical safety records as an active vaccine component. Taken all together, we show that DTT-based epitope vaccine is a promising strategy for prevention and treatment of autoimmune diseases. and planned to develop an optimized version of TNF-\u03b1 therapeutic vaccine. This does not alter the author's adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials. Fig 3. The stability of DTT and DTNF proteins.

So far, TNF-\u03b1 vaccines based on the whole molecule such as TNF-K and TNF AutoVaccIne have shown remarkable results in animal studies [9, 10] . However, these vaccine strategies are not successful in the human trials. TNF-K is a conjugate mixture of TNF-\u03b1 and KLH. The bioactivity of the cytokine is inactivated by formaldehyde treatment. TNF AutoVaccIne comprises two recombinant TNF-\u03b1 proteins with specific peptides replaced by a CD4 T cell epitope from tetanus toxin. In both cases, the elicited antibody responses against the endogenous molecule were weak while humoral responses against the immunogens or partially denatured TNF-\u03b1 were strong, suggesting that the epitopes are compromised during production processes [11, 12] . Thus a rational design is necessary to generate a stable structure feasible to manufacture.",

However, both approaches unavoidably compromise the immunogenicity of the immunogen. Therefore, a peptide epitope based vaccine design is a preferred choice. Work from Capini et al have shown that a cyclic TNF-\u03b1 epitope peptide (aa 80-96) conjugated to KLH elicits a stronger neutralizing antibody response than the linear counterpart, which suggests that stabilizing the conformation of the peptide epitope is a key criterion in the vaccine design [14] . Here, we developed an epitope-scaffold immunogen against TNF-\u03b1, in which the conformation of the epitope peptide TNF-\u03b1 aa 80-97 is stabilized by transplantation onto a scaffold molecule, a transmembrane domain of diphtheria toxin (DTT). We assessed the immunogenicity of the vaccine against native TNF-\u03b1 in mice as well as the therapeutic efficacy in collagen-induced arthritis mouse model. Our results showed that DTT-based epitope-scaffold vaccine is a promising strategy for prevention and treatment of autoimmune diseases.",

Firstly, the function of T-domain is engaged in translocation of the catalytic domain of DT across the endosomal membrane in low pH-dependent manner [22] . Thus there is no safety issue associated with this domain [23] . Secondly, DTT has a rigid tertiary structure composed entirely of \u03b1-helices and loops ( Fig 1B) . Therefore, it potentially tolerates transplantation of a foreign peptide and renders the peptide a more stable conformation [24, 25] . Moreover, DTT can be expressed in E.coli as a highly soluble protein and the CD spectrum of the purified DTT shows a typical helical conformation with two minima at 208 and 222nm (Fig 1C) . This would substantially reduce manufacture costs. Thirdly, DTT possesses four T help cell epitopes (aa 69-88, 119-138, 129-148, 149-168, corresponding to DT aa 271-290, 321-340, 331-350, and 351-370), each of which is recognized by human major histocompatibility complexes (HAL) with population coverage of 88%, 71%, 82%, 70%, respectively [26] . As human MHC II genes are highly polymorphic, a combination of universal Th epitopes promises more population coverage. Among people previously immunized with DT vaccine, the Th epitopes in a DTTbased vaccine induced a rapid recall response of CD4 memory T cell [27] .",

We speculated that this is a potential site for the epitope transplantation. Since the interatomic distance between the end residues of the epitope peptide is 2.88\u00c5 shorter than that of DTT aa 89 and 96, direct transplantation would potentially introduce conformational constraint to both DTT and the epitope. In order to identify appropriate transplantation that keeps the epitope conformation close to that of native molecule while DTT conformation is minimally perturbed, we generated seven epitope-scaffold molecules ( Fig 1D) with difference of the interatomic distance between the epitope and the replaced segment (\u0394D) varies in a range of -3.34 \u00c5 to +3.68 \u00c5. As \u0394D of DTNF3 and DTNF4 is close to each other because some of the replaced residues are at the turn of the helix, we choose DTNF4 for further experiments. DTNF7 is generated by replacing DTT 89-96 with the epitope peptide encompassing TNF-\u03b1 residues 80-97. The inclusion of one more residue in the epitope peptide increases TD to 12.11 \u00c5 and reduces the \u0394D to -0.47 \u00c5.",

To test this possibility, we performed DSC to look into the thermal stabilities of DTNF proteins and DTT. Shown in Fig 3A, The Tm values of all DTNF proteins are lower than that of DTT. DTNF2 is the most unstable protein with Tm value~9\u00b0C below DTT. The Tm values of DTNF1 and 6 are decreased by~4\u00b0C, and those of DTNF4 and 7 decreased by~3\u00b0C. Since DTNF4 and DTNF5 have Tm values slightly higher than that of DTNF7, their poor immunogenicity cannot be explained by their thermal stabilities.",

Fig 4A shows that the conformations of the TNF-\u03b1 epitopes in all DTNF proteins are stable and close to that of TNF-\u03b1 except DTNF1 whose Ser 81 adopts coil conformation instead of extended conformation. Shown in Fig 4E, the epitope of DTNF7 is entirely surface exposed. In contrast, conformational stability of the scaffold is perturbed to various degrees in all DTNF proteins with that of DTNF7 the least affected. The helix of DTT at position 97-101 is not stable in DTNF2, DTNF5 and DTNF6 (Fig 4B) . Particularly, the helix of DTNF2 is highly flexible and its RMSF is abruptly increased compared with that of DTT (Fig 4C) . The residues at position 66-69 of DTNF1 also display higher degree of flexibility. The secondary structure of DTNF4 is stable and the epitope conformation is closed to that of TNF-\u03b1. However, its RMSFs at position 123-125 are decreased compared with that of DTT, indicating a more constrained conformation of the scaffold is unfavorable for the epitope presentation (Fig 4D) . Consistent with these observations, the solubility of the recombinant proteins varies after storage at 4\u00b0C for 10 days in PBS solution, and DTNF2 is especially unstable and becomes completely insoluble after the storage (Fig 3B) .",

            "text": "Almost all known cytokines are present in the RA synovial fluid, among which TNF-\u03b1 is the first cytokine proved to be effective therapeutic target [2] . In recent years, the immune-regulatory function of GM-CSF has been shown to play crucial roles in driving the development of many autoimmune diseases [44] [45] [46] . GM-CSF or its receptor-targeted therapies have been shown highly effective and remarkably safe in treatments of many autoimmune diseases, in particular, RA [47] . Of note, antigen-specific regulatory T cells activated by therapeutics antagonizing TNF-\u03b1 or GM-CSF have been shown play major immune suppressive roles in RA and other autoimmune diseases [48, 49] . This mechanism also underlies immune tolerance of ACAID (anterior chamber associated immune deviation) [50] . Studies from Shukkur M. Farooq show that collagen type II-specific ACAID Treg suppresses inflammation in CIA [51] . Therefore, it awaits further investigation to determine whether DTNF7 immunization modulate the function of collagen-specific Treg in CIA and whether the Treg cells are functionally equivalent to ACAID Treg.",
