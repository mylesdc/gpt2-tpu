Since many outbreaks of infectious diseases last only six to eight weeks, there is a need for trial designs that can be implemented rapidly in the face of uncertainty. Outbreaks are sudden and unpredictable and so it is essential that as much planning as possible takes place in advance. Statistical aspects of such trial designs should be evaluated and discussed in readiness for implementation.",

The design is intended as an off-the-shelf, ready-to-use robust and flexible option. The primary endpoint is a categorisation of patient outcome according to an ordinal scale. A sequential approach is adopted, stopping as soon as it is clear that the experimental treatment has an advantage or that sufficient advantage is unlikely to be detected. The properties of the design are evaluated using large-sample theory and verified for moderate sized samples using simulation. The trial is powered to detect a generic clinically relevant difference: namely an odds ratio of 2 for better rather than worse outcomes. Total sample sizes (across both treatments) of between 150 and 300 patients prove to be adequate in many cases, but the precise value depends on both the magnitude of the treatment advantage and the nature of the ordinal scale. An advantage of the approach is that any erroneous assumptions made at the design stage about the proportion of patients falling into each outcome category have little effect on the error probabilities of the study, although they can lead to inaccurate forecasts of sample size.",

            "text": "The 2013-15 Ebola virus disease epidemic in West Africa highlighted the need to be able to develop treatment trial protocols in a matter of weeks, rather than the months or even years that are more usually taken. Clinical research on epidemic infectious diseases has to take place when new cases are occurring. Urgency arises because the outbreak might subside before any lessons about treatment can be learnt, or worse, the outbreak might spiral out of control before effective therapies can be developed. This paper presents statistical aspects of trial designs that can be developed in advance and then quickly be adapted for a particular outbreak. The Generic Ordinal Sequential Trial (GOST) is a flexible, off-the-shelf statistical design for a randomised clinical trial comparing an experimental treatment with standard care for an emerging infectious disease. Key aspects of GOST are fixed in advance, so that clinicians and statisticians can immediately adopt these generic features, and focus on the optional elements that have to be determined as well as the countless other tasks involved in initiating a clinical trial of this nature. The context envisaged is one where there are only weeks available for preparation, perhaps with limited knowledge of the natural history of the disease. This paper may also be a helpful illustration for research teams with longer to prepare for a trial. In that case, trial statisticians might wish to vary the fixed elements of the design and to explore the consequences using methods described in [1] , perhaps applying the statistical code provided in [2] .",

An ordinal scale is a categorisation of outcomes for which there is an intrinsic ranking (or order) of the categories in terms of desirability, but there is no specific numerical value attached to each one. A clinical trial is sequential if it is conducted using a sequence of successive analyses, each of which may resolve the primary clinical question and lead to the termination of the trial. The primary trial endpoint in GOST is an ordinal categorisation of patient outcome as recorded a specified number of days following randomisation, and the sequential monitoring will lead to stopping as soon as it is clear that the experimental treatment has an advantage or that sufficient advantage is unlikely to be detected. The trial is powered to detect a generic clinically relevant difference: namely an odds ratio of 2 for better rather than worse outcomes.

They must also reflect progressively less desirable states as one moves from C 1 (the best outcome) to C k (the worst outcome). Outcome C 1 might reflect complete recovery and C k death before Day D. Intermediate outcomes might include C 2 : alive and requiring only basic support and C 3 : alive but requiring intensive support, where these terms would need careful definition for specific diseases. It is not necessary for the number of patients in every outcome category to be large, and the method remains valid and accurate if one or more categories turn out to be completely empty, provided that at least two categories are well represented.

GOST is presented for the case of an ordinal response because expected sample sizes will be reduced if more than two outcome categories can be reliably identified [3] . Furthermore, at the outset of a trial concerning a new infection, it may not be clear whether the key issue will be the prevention of death or the reduction of morbidity. Using a categorisation that distinguishes between a number of outcome states will allow the trial to be informative if life or death proves to be the major issue or if fatalities prove to be rare and the need for intensive therapy becomes the key concern. In normal circumstances, a pilot study of conventionally treated patients might be used to determine a binary endpoint for the trial: here we are concerned to start the definitive randomised study as early in the outbreak as possible.",

Achieving an outcome in any one of categories C 1 ,. . ., C j is preferable to being in one of the categories C j+1 ,. . ., C k , an event that occurs with probability 1 -P Ej . The odds of the former event is O Ej = P Ej /(1 -P Ej ), and P Sj and O Sj are defined similarly for patients receiving S. The odds ratio R j is defined by R j = O Ej /O Sj . Notice that these definitions make sense for values of j from 1 to k-1, but they are not used for j = k as P Ek and P Sk refer to the probability of a patient being in any of the outcome categories, which must be 1, and the corresponding odds values are undefined. The null hypothesis is that E has no effect, in which case P Ej = P Sj and so R j = 1 for each value of j from 1 to k-1. If this null hypothesis is true then the probability of concluding that E is better than S (an event that will be designated \"E wins\" hereafter) is set to equal 0.025.

Thus, treatment with E might lead to a greater chance of complete recovery, a greater chance of complete or partial recovery, and a smaller chance of death. Specifically, situations are considered in which all of the odds ratios from R 1 to R k\u22121 are of equal magnitude (denoted by a common value R) and greater than 1. The design is constructed to ensure that, if R = 2, then the probability that E wins is 0.90. This is the power of the trial. The alternative hypothesis is a compromise between the desires to detect small but worthwhile treatment effects and to complete the trial quickly. For a binary outcome, an odds ratio of 2 corresponds to an increase in success rate from \u2153 on S to \u00bd on E, or from \u00bd to \u2154, or from \u2154 to \u2158. Typical sample sizes when GOST is employed are in the range 150-300 (totalled over both treatment groups). The value of 0.90 is chosen for the power of GOST as it is a conventional choice: choosing 0.80 would allow too large a risk of missing a treatment effect as large as R = 2. For an increase in success rate from \u00bd on S to \u2157 on E (R = 1.5), GOST will conclude that E is better than S with probability 0.47. The sample size would triple to 450-900 if a power of 0.90 were specified for the alternative R = 1.5.",

It will be seen in the results section that such a choice will lead to around 20 to 30 new responses (totalled over S and E) being needed between consecutive interim analyses. It will also be seen that typically only 8 to 12 of these analyses will be required before the trial stops. The data requirements for each patient at each interim analysis are modest: patient identification number, date of randomisation, treatment, treatment centre and any other baseline stratification factors, and status on Day D. Setting 20 interim analyses for GOST is a subjective choice of the authors achieving a much quicker reaction to the message of the data than setting just 3 or 4 interim analyses while being more practical than updating the sequential plot every time a Day D report is received.",

            "text": "At each interim analysis two test statistics are calculated. The first is a cumulative measure of the observed advantage of E over S and is denoted by Z. The second quantifies the amount of information about the treatment difference contained in Z, and is denoted by V. Expressions for computing Z and V, allowing for stratification factors, are taken from [4] and presented in equations (E1) and (E2) of the Supporting Information (S1 Text. Supporting technical details). The monitoring of GOST can be depicted by a plot of the values of Z computed at each interim analysis against the corresponding values of V, using the diagram shown in Fig 1. A completed plot is presented in the results section. The stopping rule is represented by two straight lines. If Z lies above the upper line, the trial is stopped and E wins. If the plotted value of Z lies below the lower line, the trial is stopped and it is concluded that no evidence that E is better than S has been found. This design is a special case of the triangular test [1, 2] , and it was proposed as the phase III part of a trial strategy for Ebola virus disease [5, 6] . Fig 2 shows the probability that E wins, plotted against the natural logarithm, \u03b8, of the true odds ratio R. When R = 1 (\u03b8 = 0) the plotted probability is 0.025 and when R = 2 (\u03b8 = 0.693) it is 0.90. Fig 3 shows the probability of stopping at or before selected interim analyses, plotted against the true value of the log-odds ratio \u03b8. In both of these figures values of \u03b8 corresponding to selected values of the odds-ratio R are also indicated on the horizontal axis. Although a maximum of 20 analyses is allowed, it is very unlikely that more than 16 will be required. If the treatment is either harmful (R < 1, \u03b8 < 0) or very efficacious (R > 2.7, \u03b8 > 1), then it is unlikely that more than 4 interim analyses (one fifth of the maximum sample size) will be needed. Fig 4 shows the expected value of V at the end of the trial (that is the average value of the final value of V over many iterations of the same trial) plotted against \u03b8. As discussed later, the values of V in Fig 4 can be converted into expected final sample sizes. During the trial, V will be calculated according to equation E2 in S1 Text, but prior to the trial starting, the relationship between sample size and V can be approximated using equation E3 in S1 Text to yield a plot of expected terminal sample size against \u03b8, as will be illustrated in the results section below.",

Provided that departures from the plan are purely chance deviations rather than being prompted by emerging data, actual values of these quantities will be used in the analysis. Thus it is acceptable if an unexpected surge of recruitment leads to there being more information available for an interim analysis than anticipated, but it is not acceptable for investigators to see a value of Z close to the stopping boundary and to bring forward the next interim analysis in the hope of a quick conclusion. The valid analysis is described in [1] and statistical code for its implementation is provided in [2] . Conduct of the final analysis will need expert statistical input. Unlike the finalisation of the design, there should be sufficient time for the trial statistician to study and practice these methods ahead of the trial reaching a conclusion.

However, binary data are less informative than the ordinal version of the data, and it will now take 520 patient responses to ensure that V eventually reaches the value where the stopping boundaries in The inflation in sample size due to dichotomising the ordinal scale is a factor of 1.18: an 18% increase in sample size. Additional simulations conducted using 26 new binary responses per interim analysis confirmed that the intended type I error rate 0.025 and the power of 0.90 were achieved, but the increase in average final sample sizes relative to those for the ordinal approach reported for Scenarios 1 and 2 in Table 2 ranged from 17% to 26%.

The design does not seek to distinguish between lack of effect and harm: either way there is no further interest in E and resources are better devoted to other experimental treatments.
