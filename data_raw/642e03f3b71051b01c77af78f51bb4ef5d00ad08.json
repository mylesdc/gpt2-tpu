            "text": "Human adenoviruses (HAdVs) are highly contagious pathogens causing acute respiratory disease (ARD), such as community-acquired pneumonia. HAdV-7d, a re-emergent genomic variant, has been recently reported in Asia and the United States after a several-decade absence. However, whether HAdV-7d is associated with higher severity than other types is currently unclear. In this study, the clinical and epidemiological investigation showed that fever, cough, and sore throat were the three most common respiratory symptoms of HAdV infections. HAdV-7 caused longer duration of fever, higher morbidity of tachypnea/dyspnea, pleural effusion, diarrhea, hepatosplenomegaly, consciousness alteration, as well as higher rates of pneumonia, mechanical ventilation and higher fatality rate (28.6%) than other types, particularly HAdV-3 and HAdV-2. The genomes of seven HAdV-7d isolates from mild, severe, and fatal cases were sequenced and highly similar with each other. Surprisingly, two isolates (2011, 2012) had 100% identical genomes with an earlier strain from a fatal ARD outbreak in China (2009), which elucidates the virus origin and confirms the unexpected HAdV genomic conservation and stability. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that L1 52/55-kDa DNA packaging protein may be associated with the higher severity of illness and fatality rate of HAdV-7. Clinicians need to be aware of HAdVs in children with ARD.",

Thirty-four cases (34.3%) had co-infection with at least one respiratory virus. RSV and HBoV (8, 23 .5% each) were the most common respiratory pathogens in children co-infected with HAdVs. HAdV-14, HAdV-21, HAdV-55 (2; 2% each), and HAdV-19 (1; 1%) were identified without co-infections with any viruses ( Table 1) . The seasonal distributions of the HAdVs were further analyzed (Table 2) . Overall, the prevalence peaked in the summer (33; 7.67%). There was no significant statistical difference in the prevalence peaks between the summers in 2010-2012 (6.49-9.59%, p = 0.763). However, when looking at the seasonal peaks in each year, HAdV-positive rate in the winter of 2010 (10; 14.71%) was significantly higher than the other winters of 2011 and 2012 (p < 0.001); the prevalence of pediatric ARD associated with HAdVs was significantly higher in 2010 (27; 6.51%) and 2011 (41; 6.81%) than in 2012 (31; 3.34%). Demographic characteristics of HAdV-positive children with ARD in 2010-2012. Overall, the median age with HAdV infection was 33.5 months (0.7 months -13 years); 89% were under 5 years; the male-to-female ratio was 2.19:1. Of the 99 HAdV-positive cases, 69 (69.7%) were hospitalized; 24 (24.2%) children without underlying health conditions were admitted to the intensive care unit (Table 3) . Fourteen of 15 children infected with HAdV-7 were hospitalized and 8 (53.3%) needed intensive care (Table 3) . Compared with ARD inpatients caused by the other types, the inpatients infected by HAdV-7 had more severe clinical symptoms (Table 4 ). They had longer duration of fever (8.6 vs. 4.4 days; p = 0.039), the higher morbidity of tachypnea/dyspnea (71.4% vs. 29.6%; p = 0.004), more pleural effusion (57.1% vs. 3.7%; p < 0.001), diarrhea (42.8% vs. 11.1%; p = 0.012), hepatosplenomegaly (57.1% vs. 24.1%; p = 0.025), and consciousness alteration (28.6% vs. 1.8%; p = 0.005). The clinical outcomes of these inpatients were also more severe than non-HAdV-7 infected inpatients, including the occurrence of pneumonia (57.1% vs. 16.7%; p = 0.004), mechanical ventilation required (35.7% vs. 3.7%; p = 0.003), and significantly higher fatality rate (28.6% vs. none; p = 0.001).",

The assembly in each samples yielded 3 or 4 contigs after PASA analysis. All of these samples have one long contig covering above half of the reference genome (N50 > 17 kb). The local coverage rates varied between 91-92%. The numbers of gaps identified in each samples were 3-5.

The genome sequence identities between both isolates and the other five isolates were extremely high (more than 99.98%). When compared with strain 0901HZ/ShX/2009, the genomes of both isolates OP01_2011 and IP05_2012 contained only one single T insertion in E3 non-coding region and Virus-Associated (VA) RNA II, respectively (Table 6 ).

Unexpectedly, we observed that the complete genome sequences of HAdV-7d isolates from mild, severe and fatal respiratory diseases were almost indistinguishable. Also surprisingly, strains IP04_2011 (severe case) and IP06_2012 (mild case) were 100% identical with each other as well as with the fatal strain (0901/HZ/ShX/2009) from the 2009 ARD outbreak 7, 15 ; the other five strains had only a few nucleotide mutations. To our knowledge, this is the first report that the complete genomes were chosen to be analyzed. All the seven HAdV-7 isolates in this study have identical REA profiles with each other, different from the Gomen prototype, identified as genome type HAdV-7d. M, molecular weight markers corresponding to a 500 bp DNA Ladder (A) and DL10,000 DNA Marker (B) respectively. Nota bene: the agarose gel electrophoresis of RE digested genomic DNA was not run at the same time but under the same conditions. of three isolates from different periods were identical with each other, which confirms the expected degree of genomic sequence conservation and stability of HAdVs. Based on the genome sequence identity, we conclude that strains IP04_2011 and IP06_2012 in Guangzhou originated from strain 0901/HZ/ShX/2009 in Xixiang County, Shaanxi Province, although both cities are more than 1,000 kilometers apart. The unexpectedly high genome identities between isolates from mild, severe and fatal cases indicate that the difference in HAdV-7d pathogenicity may be due to host immunity. The detailed risk factors associated with adverse consequences caused by HAdV-7d merit further investigation.",

Our phylogenetic analysis confirmed this recombination even in HAdV-7b, 7d, 7d2, and 7 h (Fig. 4D) , while not in the prototype Gomen strain. The importance of this recombination remains unknown. However, a previous study found that this protein was expressed in both the early and late stages of infection 50 . L1 52/55 kDa proteins and IVa2 interacted in infected cells and bound in vivo to the packaging sequence 50, 51 . It was an essential protein absolutely required for DNA packaging and encapsidation 52 , which contributed to the adenoviral reproduction. All the emergent pathogens (7b, 7d, 7d2, and 7h) contained this particular moderate sized recombination from HAdV-B16 into the HAdV-7 genome chassis. These data provide a clue that the L1 52/55 kDa DNA packaging protein may be associated with the HAdV-7 hypervirulent phenotype, but it requires confirmation. .

In Southern China, the predominant types in children were HAdV-3 and HAdV-7. The peak season of HAdV infection in 2011-2012 was summer. The re-emergent HAdV-7d isolates originated from the earlier strain associated with a fatal ARD outbreak (2009). HAdV-7d caused more severe illness and higher fatality rate in pediatric inpatients than other types. The L1 52/55 kDa DNA packaging protein may be associated with the HAdV-7 hypervirulent phenotype. Fever, cough, and sore throat were the three most common respiratory symptoms of severe HAdV infections. The vaccine against HAdV-7 is in urgent need in both China and other population-dense countries. HAdV-7d associated with higher severity of illness has re-emerged in China and may have the potential to cause more outbreaks. Clinicians should pay particular attention to HAdVs in children with ARD. We call attention to urge extensive and continuous epidemiological surveillance and genetic characterization of the currently circulating HAdV strains in China, as well as in other countries with close-quartered and/or vulnerable populations.",

The nasopharyngeal swab specimens from HAdV-positive patients were inoculated into HEp-2 cells and cytopathic effect (CPE) was monitored for ten days.

Molecular types were determined by BLASTN of the assembling contigs against existing GenBank sequences. HAdV-7 whole-genome sequencing, annotation and phylogenetic analysis. Purified HAdV genomic DNA was submitted to Sagene Bio Co. (Guangzhou, China) for next generation whole-genome sequencing on Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine (PGM TM ). In brief, genomic libraries were prepared using the Ion Xpress plus fragment library kit (Life Technologies) and barcoded adapters were linked to DNA fragments, then amplified by emulsion PCR with Ion PGM 200 Xpress Template kit (Life Technologies). After breaking the emulsion, and adding the sequencing primer and polymerase, the completely prepared Ion Sphere Particle (ISP) beads of seven samples were loaded into Ion 318 v2 chips and individually sequenced on Ion Torrent PGM, with 500 flows generating 6,063,042 reads with an average length of 182 bp, and a mean coverage of 2,409x. All the sequencing ladders were assembled with the Program to Assemble Spliced Alignments (PASA) tool 58 and SEQMAN software from the Lasergene package (DNAStar; Madison, WI). HAdV-7 strain 0901HZ/ShX/ CHN/2009 (35239 bps) was chosen as the reference genome.

The configuration file was input after \"-c\"; \"genome_sample.fasta\" represented the reference genome file name. Because we used PASA to assemble virus genomes with a reference genome, \"-t\" and \"-u\" parameters followed the same fasta file of virus sequencing data, despite different file names. \"-ALIGNER\" parameter followed two alignment methods, blat and gmap. The other parameters were set as default. Two CPUs were used to run the program simultaneously. Gaps and ambiguous sequences were PCR-amplified using different primers and re-sequenced by Sanger method for more than three-fold coverage. Both 5\u2032 -and 3\u2032 -ends including inverted terminal repeats were sequenced directly using genomic DNA as template, as described earlier 1 . The genome sequences were annotated based on the previous annotation of HAdV-7 prototype strain (Gomen; 1952) 59 and deposited into GenBank database. The Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) version 6.06 software (http://www.megasoftware.net/megamac.php) was used for phylogenetic analyses of HAdV-7 hexon, fiber, penton genes, L1 52/55 kDa DNA packaging protein gene and the whole genomes, with additional sequences retrieved from GenBank database.
