A few broad neutralization epitopes identified so far are present on the surface of native HIV-1 envelope spikes whose recognition by antibodies does not depend on conformational changes of the envelope spikes. However, HIV-1 envelope spikes also contain transiently-exposed neutralization epitopes, which are more difficult to identify. Results: In this study, we constructed single chain Fvs (scFvs) derived from seven human monoclonal antibodies and genetically linked them with or without a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) attachment signal. We show that with a GPI attachment signal the scFvs are targeted to lipid rafts of plasma membranes. In addition, we demonstrate that four of the GPI-anchored scFvs, but not their secreted counterparts, neutralize HIV-1 with various degrees of breadth and potency. Among them, GPI-anchored scFv (X5) exhibits extremely potent and broad neutralization activity against multiple clades of HIV-1 strains tested. Moreover, we show that GPI-anchored scFv (4E10) also exhibited more potent neutralization activity than its secretory counterpart. Finally, we demonstrate that expression of GPI-anchored scFv (X5) in the lipid raft of plasma membrane of human CD4 + T cells confers longterm resistance to HIV-1 infection, HIV-1 envelope-mediated cell-cell fusion, and the infection of HIV-1 captured and transferred by human DCs.",

Neutralizing antibodies block viral entry by recognizing epitopes on the envelope spike critical for its attachment, receptor and co-receptor interaction, or fusion and appear to be an important component of a protective immune response [1] .

Despite more than two decades of effort, only a few broadly neutralizing antibodies (2G12, b12, VRC001, VRC002, VRC003, PG9, PG16, 2F5 and 4E10/Z13) have been identified through screening antibody libraries or memory B cells from HIV-1 infected individuals [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] .

            "text": "Upon interaction with CD4 receptor, a lipid raftassociated protein [15] [16] [17] [18] , on the target cell surface, the native HIV-1 envelope spike goes through extensive conformational changes that allow additional binding to a co-receptor, CXCR4 for T-cell tropic strains or CCR5 for macrophage-tropic isolates. Co-receptor binding results in further conformational changes and leads to the insertion of the fusion peptide in gp41 into target cell membrane to drive the subsequent fusion event. During these conformational changes epitopes that are hidden from or not totally exposed on the surface of native spike are transiently exposed and become accessible to antibodies specific for these transiently-exposed epitopes. Likely, some of these epitopes are also neutralization epitopes. Based on this assumption, several groups reported using gp120-CD4 or gp120-CD4-CCR5 complex as immunogens to elicit antibodies that react with transiently-exposed neutralization epitopes or as selecting antigens for screening human phage display antibody libraries [19] [20] [21] . It was hypothesized that in these complexes HIV-1 envelope may stabilize some of the transiently-exposed epitopes so that antibodies present in the libraries that recognized these stabilized epitopes can be selected [22] . One notable example was the identification of a CD4inducible antibody X5 in a phage display Fab antibody library with a gp120-CD4-CCR5 complex [21] .",

The antibody recognizes the cluster II determinant (amino acid residues 644-663) which resides within the second heptad repeat (HR2) of HIV-1 gp41 [25] . HIV-1 gp41 mediated fusion is triggered by interaction between the second and the first heptad repeats, which converts a prehairpin gp41 trimer into a fusogenic three-hairpin bundle [26] . Similarly, it was reported that expressing a peptide derived from the HR2 domain on the surface of HIV-1-susceptible cells exhibits greater inhibitory effect on HIV-1 [27] and such an inhibition is achieved by capturing a gp41 fusion intermediate by the cell-surface expressed peptide prior to viral and cell membrane fusion [28] . Thus, it is clear that the cellsurface expressed scFv or peptide that recognizes or is derived from the HR2 domain can capture transientlyexposed epitopes in entry fusion intermediates. However, it is not clear whether transiently-exposed epitopes on HIV-1 envelope spikes other than that resides in the HR2 domain can also be captured by cell-surface expressed scFvs.",

AB65 recognizes the influenza hemagglutinin used here as negative control (Zhou, et al. data not shown). AB31 and AB32 are high affinity antibodies. AB31 recognizes cluster III determinant of gp41 and AB32 interacts with gp120, but its epitope is not well characterized [34] . Antibody (TG15) recognizes the cluster II determinant (amino acid residues 644-663) which resides within the second heptad repeat (HR2) of HIV-1 gp41 [23] . Antibodies 48d and X5 recognize distinct, but partially overlapped CD4 induced epitopes that are located close to both co-receptor-binding and CD4-binding sites of gp120 [21, 35, 36] . Antibody 4E10 that recognizes a linear epitope residing in the membrane proximate region of gp41 is a neutralizing antibody [7] . Here, we show that by genetically linking the scFvs with a GPI attachment signal derived from decay accelerating factor (DAF) [37] the scFvs are targeted to lipid rafts of plasma membranes. In addition, we demonstrate that the four of these GPIanchored scFvs (X5, 48d, AB32 and TG15), but not their secretory counterparts, neutralize HIV-1 with various degrees of breadth and potency. Among them, GPIanchored scFv (X5) exhibits extremely potent and broad neutralization activity against multiple clades of HIV-1 strains tested. Moreover, we show that GPI-anchored scFv (4E10) also exhibited more potent neutralization activity than its secretory counterpart. Finally, we demonstrate that expression of GPI-anchored scFv (X5) in the lipid raft of plasma membrane of human CD4 + T cells confers long-term resistance to HIV-1 infection, HIV-1 envelope-mediated cell-cell fusion and the infection of HIV-1 captured and transferred by human DCs. Thus, we conclude that GPI-anchored scFv is an effective way to capture transiently-exposed neutralization epitopes in the HIV-1 envelope spike.",

The fusion genes scFv/IgG3 hinge/his-tag/ DAF and scFv/IgG3 hinge/his-tag were inserted into a third generation lentiviral vector pRRL ( Figure 1A ). The recombinant viruses were then generated as described before [38] and used to transduce TZM.bl cells and human CD4 + T cells CEMss and CEMss-CCR5 (see below). The expression of transgenes and localization of transgene products in the transduced cells were carefully studied. Figure 1B shows the expression of scFvs/hinge/his-tag/ DAF and scFvs/hinge/his-tag in cell lysates and culture supernatants of transduced TZM.bl cells by western blot using anti-his-tag and anti-tubulin antibodies. As expected, without a GPI attachment signal, all scFvs were detected in both culture supernatants and cell lysates with a majority in supernatants (the right panel). By contrast, all scFvs with a GPI attachment signal were only detected in cell lysates, but not in culture supernatants (the left panel). These data indicate that inclusion of a GPI attachment signal prevents secretion of the scFvs.",

As a control, cells transduced with previously reported m-scFv (TG15), a cell-surface expressed scFv (TG15) with a conventional transmembrane domain [23] went through the same PI-PLC treatment and staining processes. Figure 1C shows that all scFv/hinge/his-tag/DAFs express highly on cell surface (about 10-fold higher than that of m-scFv) and the expression were substantially reduced with PI-PLC treatment. In contrast, no reduction in cell surface expression of scFv was observed in m-scFv-transduced cells, indicating that the expression of scFv/hinge/histag/DAF on the cell surface is indeed through a GPI anchor. In addition, cell surface expression of GPIanchored scFv (4E10) along with GPI-anchored scFvs (AB65 and X5) was also analyzed by immune staining and FACS analysis. Additional File 1 shows that cell surface expression of GPI-anchored scFv (4E10) is similar to those GPI-anchored scFvs (AB65 and X5).

In contrast, cells transduced with the GPI-scFvs show various degree of breadth and potency ( Figure 3C ). Like cells transduced with GPI-scFv (AB65) control, cells transduced with GPI-scFv (AB31) did not neutralize any of these HIV-1 strains tested. Cells transduced with GPI-scFv (AB32 and TG15) It was previously showed that the scFv (X5) neutralizes HIV-1 better than the Fab and the whole IgG [40] and the binding and neutralizing capability of scFv (X5) can be greatly enhanced by adding soluble extracellular domains of human CD4 (sCD4) [21, 41, 42] . We therefore produced and purified soluble CD4 using the drosophila S2 expression system (see Additional File 3). We then tested the effect of sCD4 doses on HIV-1 infection (Bru-3, Bru-Yu2 and Mj4) and found that at 1 \u03bcg/ml or higher a concentration-dependent inhibition of HIV-1 infection by sCD4 was observed; while below 1 \u03bcg/ml no significant inhibition by sCD4 was observed (Zhou et al. data not shown). Thus, we chose sCD4 at the concentration of 0.3 \u03bcg/ml in the subsequent post-CD4 experiments as described before [43] . Figure 4 shows mean and standard deviation of RLA in mock-, secretory and GPI-scFv-transduced TZM.bl cells infected with or without HIV-1 Bru-3 or Bru-Yu2 that were pre-incubated with or without sCD4. Preincubation of 400 and 4,000 TCID 50 of these two HIV-1 strains with sCD4 greatly enhances inhibition in cells transduced with secretory scFv (X5); while complete inhibition was observed in GPI-scFv (X5)-transduced cells infected with 400 and 4,000 TCID 50 of these two HIV-1 strains, regardless whether the viruses were preincubated with sCD4 or not ( Figure 4A -D). Thus, these results clearly show that while sCD4 enhances inhibition by secretory scFv (X5); GPI-scFv (X5) exhibits the greatest potency of inhibition, which is totally independent of addition of sCD4.",

Human CD4 + cell line CEMss was first transfected with a retroviral vector expressing human CCR5. After stable CEMss-CCR5 cells were established, they were further transduced with secretory and GPI-scFv (X5 and AB65). The expression of secretory and GPI-scFvs as well as CD4, CCR5 and CXCR4 in transduced CEMss-CCR5 cells were tested by western blot and immune staining followed by FACS analysis as described above (see Additional File 4). Transduced CEMss-CCR5 cells were then infected with HIV-1 strains Bru-3 and Bru-Yu2 at multiple of infection of 0.01 as described before [23] and cultured in the complete DMEM medium for 75 to 105 days, except for cells transduced with secretory scFvs (AB65 and X5) and infected with Bru-3 (the culture of these cells was terminated on day 27 post infection). As shown in Figure 5A and 5B, replication of both HIV-1 Bru-3 and Bru-Yu2 was completely inhibited in cells transduced with GPI-scFv (X5) throughout the experiments. In contrast, robust replication of HIV-1 Bru-3 and Bru-Yu2 was observed in cells transduced with secretory scFv (AB65) and GPI-scFv (AB65) controls. For cells transduced with secretory scFv (X5) and infected with HIV-1 Bru-3, HIV-1 replication was as robust as secretory scFv (AB65) and GPI-scFv (AB65) controls. By contrast, for cells transduced with secretory scFv (X5) and infected with HIV-1 Bru-Yu2, robust HIV-1 replication was observed in the first 6 days and then slowly dropped to the undetectable level on day 51 and thereafter. These data demonstrated that GPI-scFv (X5) completely inhibits the infection of HIV-1 Bru-3 and Bru-Yu2. By so doing it maintains long-term resistance to HIV-1. On the contrary, secretory scFv (X5) cannot inhibit the infection and replication of fast replicating HIV-1 like Bru-3, but can partially inhibits the replication of relatively slow replicating HIV-1 like Bru-Yu2.",

The latter contains a HIV-1 envelope gene (pLAI3) under a Tet-off promoter. In the presence of tetracycline, binding of tetracycline to Tet transactivator (tTA) causes conformational change of tTA, which blocks tTA binding to the Tet-off promoter and prevents HIV-1 envelope protein expression; in the absence of tetracycline, tTA binds to and transactivates the Tet-off promoter resulting in HIV-1 envelope protein expression ( Figure 5C ). Co-culturing GPI-scFv (AB65 and X5)-transduced CEMss-CCR5 cells with tetracycline-treated 69TiRevEnv cells results in no cell-cell fusion ( Figure 5D and 5E). In contrast, coculturing GPI-scFv (AB65)-transduced CEMss-CCR5 cells with tetracycline-untreated 69TiRevEnv cells results in massive cell-cell fusion ( Figure 5F ). The fusion begins after 6 hours and peaks at 20 hours. Importantly, no cellcell fusion was observed after 20 hour's co-culturing GPI-scFv (X5)-transduced CEMss-CCR5 cells with tetracycline-untreated 69TiRevEnv cells ( Figure 5G ).

GPI-scFvs, but not secretory scFvs, of the antibodies (AB32, TG15, 48d and X5) that recognize transiently-exposed epitopes on HIV-1 envelope spike neutralize HIV-1 with various degrees of breadth and potency. Among them, GPI-scFv (X5) exhibits extremely potent and broad neutralization activity against multiple clades of HIV-1 (Figures 3) . Moreover, we show that GPI-anchored scFv (4E10) also exhibited more potent neutralization activity than its secretory counterpart (Figures 3) . Importantly, the expression of GPI-scFv (X5) on the surface of human CD4 + T cells confers long-term resistance to HIV-1 infection, HIV-1 envelope-mediated cell-cell fusion and the infection of HIV-1 captured and transferred by human DCs (Figure 5 ). Thus, targeting scFv of antibody molecules in the lipid rafts of plasma membranes of HIV-1 susceptible cells through a GPI anchor is an effective way to capture transiently exposed neutralization epitopes of HIV-1 envelope spike. GPI-scFv (X5) with such remarkable breadth and potency should have a potential to be developed into an anti-viral agent for HIV-1 prevention and therapy. For example, similar to those recently reported by DiGiusto et al. [46] , GPI-scFv (X5) could be delivered into hematopoietic progenitor cells of HIV-1 patients ex vivo through lentiviral vector and transduced cells could then be transfused to the patients. However, in order to achieve clinical efficacy with this gene therapy approach, many hurdles, such as low degree of transduction efficiency and engraftment, difficulty in maintenance of self renewal as well as hematopoietic linage cell differentiation of transduced hematopoietic progenitor cells, unsustainable transgene expression, potential insertion mutagenesis, have to be overcome.",

At one end of the spectrum, GPI-scFv (AB31) does not show significant neutralization activity against any of these HIV-1 viruses; while on the other end of the spectrum, GPI-scFv (X5) neutralizes all HIV-1 viruses with remarkable degree of potency. Between these two extremes, GPI-scFvs (AB32, TG15, 4E10 and 48d) show a progressive increase of breadth and potency. Furthermore, although they both recognize CD4-induced epitopes, GPI-scFv (48d) and GPI-scFv (X5) show different potency against HIV-1 strains from clade C, but similar potency against HIV-1 strains from clades A, B, B' and E.

According to the crystal structure of gp120 core with or without sCD4 [41, 42] as well as crystal structure of a complex containing V3-containing gp120 core, the CD4 receptor and the Fab (X5) [47] , the amino acid residues 417 to 434 reside in \u03b219, \u03b220 and \u03b221 of the gp120 core. The \u03b220 and the \u03b221 form an anti-parallel \u03b2 sheet. Without adding sCD4, \u03b219 and \u03b220/\u03b221 are away from each other, the \u03b219 is covered by V3 loop and the \u03b220/\u03b221 is partially covered by V1/ V2 loop. Because of this, secretory scFv (X5) does not have neutralization activity. In contrast, adding sCD4 induces a CD4-induced conformation of gp120. In this conformation, the \u03b219 and the \u03b220/\u03b221 are not only totally exposed, but also become close to each other [42] . As a result, adding sCD4 greatly enhances neutralization activity of secretory scFv (X5) (Figure 4 ). However, it is very plausible that even in the presence of sCD4 CD4-induced conformation of the HIV-1 spike is transient, so that secretory scFv (X5) may not be able to catch all X5 epitopes on the spikes of the virion. As a result, neutralization activity is not optimal. GPI-scFv (X5), on the other hand, due to its lipid raft location and local concentration, may have much better access to its transiently-exposed neutralization epitope upon interaction of CD4 with the native envelope spike. Here CD4, a raft-associated protein, resides in the lipid raft of the plasma membrane of target cells, which is the same location as GPI-scFv (X5). As a result, GPI-scFv (X5) may quickly and efficiently capture the CD4-induced neutralization epitope and completely block the envelope spike in a pre-fusion intermediate step. However, the underlying mechanism of great potency of GPI-scFv (X5) remains to be elucidated.",

            "text": "There are at least two implications of the findings in this study. First, given the promising results obtained in this study, it is plausible to develop GPI-scFvs into a standard approach for identifying antibodies that recognize transiently-exposed epitopes on HIV-1 envelope spike. It is conceivable that for many anti-HIV-1 gp120 and gp41 antibodies that have no or poor neutralization activity against native envelope spikes, GPI-scFvs of these antibodies can be made and tested against a panel of different HIV-1 variants and subtypes. If some of these GPI-scFvs exhibit good neutralization activity, one can then use these GPI-scFvs in combination with epitope mapping methods (such as alanine-scanning mutants) to identify transiently-exposed neutralization epitopes in the HIV-1 envelope spike. Second, it is also plausible that GPI-scFvs be used to identify antibodies that recognize transiently-exposed epitopes and then to identify transiently-exposed neutralization epitopes of other viruses, particularly of those enveloped viruses whose entry into target cells depend on lipid raft and the interaction of those envelope glycoprotein with receptor results in conformational changes. It has been shown that glycoproteins of influenza virus, murine leukemia virus, measles virus and Ebola virus are associated with the lipid raft of plasma membrane [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] . The entry of many enveloped viruses, such as vaccinia virus [53] , severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus [54] , duck hepatitis B virus [55] , murine leukemia virus [56] and herpes simplex virus [57] , requires cholesterol in the target cell membrane. Therefore, development of GPI-scFvs that are derived from antibodies that recognize transiently-exposed epitopes in glycoproteins of these viruses may also be an effective way to inhibit cell entry of these viruses.",

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated using Ficoll density gradient centrifugation as described before [71] . To isolate CD14 + monocytes, the anti-CD14 microbeads and miniMACS system were used according to manufacturer's instructions (Miltenyi Biotech, Auburn, CA). Briefly, 10 8 PBMCs were resuspended in 800 \u03bcl of binding buffer (PBS containing 0.5% BSA and 2 mM EDTA). 200 \u03bcl of MACS CD14 microbeads were added, mixed and incubated at 4\u00b0C for 15 minutes. The cell-bead mixture was then washed once with binding buffer and resuspended in 1 ml of fresh binding buffer. CD14 + cells were positively selected using an MS+/RS + column tip. The isolated cells were washed once with complete RPMI and cultured in the complete RPMI supplemented with GM-CSF (1000 U/ ml) and IL-4 (1000 U/ml) (R & D System, Minneapolis, MN) for 7 days to generate immature DCs as described before [72] . The expression of DC-SIGN on the cell surface of immature DCs was measured by anti-DC-SIGN antibody staining followed by FACS analysis as described before [23] .",
