It has been difficult to eradicate the H9N2 virus because of its low pathogenicity, frequently causing in apparent infection. It is important for the control of AI to assess whether the H9N2 virus acquires pathogenicity as H5 and H7 viruses. In the present study, we investigated whether a non-pathogenic H9N2 virus, A/chicken/Yokohama/aq-55/2001 (Y55) (H9N2), acquires pathogenicity in chickens when a pair of di-basic amino acid residues is introduced at the cleavage site of its HA molecule.",

More than 75% of chickens inoculated intravenously with the passaged virus, rgY55sub-P10 (H9N2), died, indicating that it is pathogenic comparable to that of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs) defined by World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). The chickens inoculated with the virus via the intranasal route, however, survived without showing any clinical signs. On the other hand, an avirulent H5N1 strain, A/duck/Hokkaido/Vac-1/2004 (Vac1) (H5N1), acquired intranasal pathogenicity after a pair of di-basic amino acid residues was introduced into the cleavage site of the HA, followed by two passages by air sac inoculation in chicks. Conclusion: The present results demonstrate that an H9N2 virus has the potential to acquire intravenous pathogenicity in chickens although the morbidity via the nasal route of infection is lower than that of H5N1 HPAIV.",

            "text": "Each of the known subtypes of the influenza A virus (H1 to H16 and N1 to N9) is circulating in water birds, especially in migratory ducks [1] . A highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) is generated when a nonpathogenic virus brought in by migratory birds from nesting lakes in the north is transmitted to chickens via domestic ducks, geese, quails, turkeys, etc. and acquires pathogenicity for chickens with repeated multiple infections in the chicken population [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . The hemagglutinins (HAs) of HPAIVs differ from those of low pathogenic avian influenza viruses (LPAIVs) with a pair of di-basic amino acid residues at their cleavage site [7] . This structure permits ubiquitous proteases such as furin and PC6, which recognize multiple basic amino acids, to cleave the HA, leading to systemic infection in chickens. By contrast, HAs of LPAIVs are cleaved only by trypsin-like proteases which are expressed in the cells lining the respiratory or intestinal tracts, so that the viruses cause only localized infections, resulting in mild or asymptomatic diseases. It is presently believed that the strains only with H5 or H7 HAs become HPAIVs during extensive infections in chicken populations [8] . The reason why the subtypes of HPAIVs are restricted to H5 and H7 is not known although a model demonstrating that H5 HA is cleaved by furin through molecular docking analyses have been proposed [9, 10] .",

Amino acid sequences at the HA cleavage site of the mutant strain are shown in Figure 1A . The RKKR motif was introduced into the H9 HA cleavage site to give a pair of di-basic amino acid residues that is known to be a sine qua non for H5 and H7 viruses to become highly pathogenic to chickens. The virus with the insertion of basic amino acid residues at the H9 HA cleavage site was not rescued from plasmidtransfected cells (data not shown). As a positive control, rgVac1ins (H5N1) was generated by inserting the RRKKR motif, rather than RKKR, into the HA of the non-pathogenic virus A/duck/Hokkaido/Vac-1/2004 (Vac1) (H5N1) since recent H5 HPAIV isolates have the motif as insertion mutation. rgVac1sub (H5N1) was also generated to examine whether subtitution mutation with basic amino acid residues at the HA cleavage site contributed to acquisition of pathogenicity for chickens. rgY55sub (H9N2) and rgVac1ins (H5N1) required trypsin to replicate in MDCK cells, and showed similar levels of growth to their parental viruses (Table 1) . Chickens intravenously inoculated with rgY55sub (H9N2) or rgVac1ins (H5N1) did not show any signs of disease. rgVac1sub (H5N1) replicated in MDCK cells without exogenous trypsin, and one of the eight chickens inoculated with the virus showed slight depression at one day post-infection.",

            "text": "Here, we demonstrated that the H9N2 influenza virus acquired intravenous pathogenicity after a pair of dibasic amino acid residues was introduced into the cleavage site of the HA and serially passaged in chicks. Since rgY55sub-P10 (H9N2) killed 75% of chickens inoculated via intravenous route, the pathogenicity was comparable to that of HPAIVs (Table 1) . On the other hand, chickens intranasally inoculated with rgY55sub-P10 (H9N2) did not show any clinical signs of disease (Table 4 ). These results are consistent with those of previous study showing that some H10 influenza viruses did not show intranasal pathogenicity for chicken while their intravenous pathogenicity index was over 1.2 and classified as HPAIV according to the definition by European Union [29] . Amino acid changes during consecutive passages in the air sacs of chicks (Table 2 ) are considered to be responsible for the acquisition of intravenous pathogenicity, and their effects on the functions of viral proteins should be clarified further. Here we focused on two substitutions at positions 29 and 234 of the H9 HA molecule. It has been reported that residue 226, based on the H3 HA numbering (234 in the present study), relates to receptor specificity and cell tropism [30] . Strain Y55 (H9N2) originally had a leucine at this position, and the change to glutamine after serial passages in the air sacs of chicks indicates that the passaged rgY55sub (H9N2) was further adapted to chicken. One of the asparagine-linked glycosylation sites on the HA of rgY55 (H9N2) lost a carbohydrate attachment with the substitution of Asn29His. The site locates sterically in the vicinity of the HA cleavage site, suggesting that the deletion of the carbohydrate chain affected the susceptibility of the HA to the host protease [31] . This notion is also supported by the present finding that the rgY55sub viruses (H9N2) after six passages in the air sacs of chicks replicated in MDCK cells in the absence of trypsin (Table 1) . Ohuchi et al. (1991) reported that the insertion of additional basic amino acids into the H3 HA cleavage site resulted in intracellular proteolytic cleavage. Other groups reported that H3 and H6 HAs tolerated amino acid mutations into their cleavage sites and the viruses with the mutated HAs replicated in MDCK and/or QT6 cells in the absence of trypsin [32, 33] . The results in the present study are in agreement with these, namely, cleavage-based activation by an ubiquitous protease is not restricted to the H5 and H7 HAs. rgVac1sub (H5N1) and rgVac1ins (H5N1) acquired marked intravenous and intranasal pathogenicity after a few passages in chicks (Table 1 ). It was reported that an avirulent H5 virus isolated from a swan became highly pathogenic in chickens after 24 consecutive passages in the air sacs, followed by five passages in the brains of chickens [3] . The differences in time required for the viruses to become highly pathogenic between these studies depended on the amino acid motif at the HA cleavage site prior to passaging. rgVac1sub (H5N1) acquired an arginine at the HA cleavage site after only one passage in chickens ( Figure  1B and Table 3 ), suggesting that an additional insertion of basic amino acid residues efficiently occurred in the serial basic amino acid residues at the cleavage site. One third of the chickens inoculated intranasally with rgVac1sub-P2 (H5N1) or rgVac1ins-P2 (H5N1) survived 14 days (Table 4 ). In addition, one of the birds was not susceptible to infection with rgVac1sub-P2 (H5N1), indicating that viral replication may depend on the presense of P3-like viruses in the inoculum. The intranasal pathogenicity of the mutants of H9N2 virus was different from those of H5N1 mutants while these viruses replicated in MDCK cells in the absence of trypsin and killed chickens when inoculated via intravenous route (Tables 1 and 4) . The viruses were recovered from the brain and the blood of some chickens infected with rgVac1 mutants (H5N1), and morbidity was closely associated with viral titers in the brain (Table 5) . No viruses were recovered from the brain and the blood of chickens infected with rgY55 mutants (H9N2), indicating the reason why rgY55sub-P10 (H9N2) did not show intranasal pathogenicity. All the viruses passaged in the air sacs of chicks killed chicken embryos by 48 hours post allantoic inoculation (data not shown). rgVac1sub-P3 (H5N1) and rgVac1ins-P3 (H5N1) were more pathogenic to chicken embryos than rgY55sub-P10 (H9N2); the allantoic fluids obtained from the embryonated eggs inoculated with the H5N1 viruses passaged in the air sacs were turbid. It was reported that infection of a highly pathogenic virus was strictly confined to endothelial cells in chicken embryos or chickens [34, 35] . Therefore, it is suggested that the difference of endotheliotropism between the H9N2 and H5N1 viruses passaged in the air sacs affected their intranasal pathogenicity. rgY55sub-P10 (H9N2) was not recovered from the brain and the blood of chickens although it caused systemic infection ( Table 5 ), indicating that high levels of viremia followed by replication in the vascular endothelial cells was prerequisite for the virus to cross the blood-brain barrier and consequently replicated in the brain. This hypothesis is supported by the result that rgY55sub-P10 (H9N2) showed intravenous pathogenicity in chickens; direct injection of the virus to the blood vessels readily caused viremia, leading to invasion of the virus to the brain.

If serine at the c-terminus of the HA1 of the H9 virus was substituted with lysine, the amino acid motif would be consistent with that of rgY55sub (H9N2) which acquired intravenous pathogenicity on consecutive passages in the air sacs of chicks. LPAI caused by H9N2 strains in poultry is now causing serious economic losses [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] , and its eradication is still difficult because of its low pathogenicity, frequently causing inapparent infections. The present study demonstrated that H9N2 viruses circulating in chicken flocks can acquire intravenous pathogenicity. It is predicted that co-infections of rgY55sub-P10 (H9N2) with bacteria exacerbate not only intravenous pathogenicity but intranasal pathogenicity in chickens as shown in a previous study [21] . Therefore, continuous monitoring in poultry is important to prevent the emergence of pathogenic H9 viruses.",

MDCK cells and 293T cells were maintained in Minimum Essential Medium (MEM, Nissui Pharmaceutical, Tokyo, Japan) containing 10% calf serum and D-MEM (Invitrogen) containing 10% FBS, respectively. Before transfection, confluent 293T and MDCK cells in 75 cm 2 flasks were trypsinized, and 10% of each cell line was mixed in 12 ml of Opti-MEM I (Invitrogen); 2 ml of the suspension was seeded into each well of six-well tissue culture plates (Nunc Inc., Naperville, IL). The cocultured 293T and MDCK cells were used for the transfection. TransIT-293 (Panvera, Madison, WI) was used to transfect cells according to the manufacturer's directions. Briefly, two microliters of TransIT-293 per microgram of DNA was mixed, incubated at room temperature for 45 minutes, and added to the cells. The transfection mixture was replaced with Opti-MEM I after six hours of incubation at 37\u00b0C. Thirty hours later, Opti-MEM I containing one microgram per microliter of trypsin was added.
