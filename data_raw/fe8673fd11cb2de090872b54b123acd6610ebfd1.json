Comparable analytical challenges are encountered in other data-intensive fields involving sequential data, such as signal processing, in which dimensionality reduction (i.e., compression) methods are routinely used to lessen the computational burden of analyses. In this work, we explored the application of dimensionality reduction methods to numerically represent high-throughput sequence data for three important biological applications of virus sequence data: reference-based mapping, short sequence classification and de novo assembly. Leveraging highly compressed sequence transformations to accelerate sequence comparison, our approach yielded comparable accuracy to existing approaches, further demonstrating its suitability for sequences originating from diverse virus populations. We assessed the application of our methodology using both synthetic and real viral pathogen sequences. Our results show that the use of highly compressed sequence approximations can provide accurate results, with analytical performance retained and even enhanced through appropriate dimensionality reduction of sequence data.",

Euclidean distance is arguably the most widely used Lp-norm method for sequential data comparison but can only be used on sequences of the same length. Furthermore, Lp-norm methods do not accommodate shifts in the x-axis (time or position) and are thus limited in their ability to identify similar features within offset data. Elastic similarity/dissimilarity methods, such as LCS, unbounded DTW and various alignment algorithms, permit comparison of data with different dimensions and tolerate shifts in the x-axis. These properties of elastic similarity methods can be very useful in the analysis of speech signals, for example, but can be computationally expensive [30] . Several approaches have been proposed to permit fast searching with DTW, including the introduction of global constraints (wrapping path) or the use of lower bounding techniques, such as LB_keogh [28] .",

Indexing structures, such as the R*-tree, KD-tree, VP-tree and MVP-tree have significantly lower time complexity (O(n log(n))) for similarity search [31] and are more appropriate for efficient analysis of large datasets. The R*-tree [32, 33] and KD-tree [34] indexing structures are very accurate for low dimensional datasets. However, their performance deteriorates significantly in high dimensional space [31], a phenomenon known as the 'curse of dimensionality' [35, 36] . Metric trees, such as the VP-tree [37] and MVP-tree [38], are less prone to this limitation. Metric space indexing structures make use of geometric properties for partitioning data and work efficiently on both low and high dimensional data [39] . The curse of dimensionality can be further mitigated using data approximations, such as the DFT, the DWT and the PAA, to partition a dataset in an approximated space without loss of generality [21] .",

Genomic analyses often begin with the process of sequence assembly, where sequence fragments (reads) are reconstructed into the larger sequences from which they originated.

The use of a reference sequence, even the use of a data specific generated sequence, can lead to valuable read information being discarded during the alignment process [15] . On the other hand, while de novo approaches require little a priori knowledge of target sequence composition, the methods are computationally intensive, and their performance scales poorly with datasets of increasing size [9] . Aggressive heuristics must be employed, to traverse graphs and deal with mismatches, reduce the running time of de novo assemblers, which, in turn, can compromise assembly quality. Indexing structures such as the BWT and its relatives are widely used to reduce the burden of pairwise sequence comparison, for both reference-based mapping and de novo assembly.

Also, the number of sequences generated challenge many computational systems for a feasible working solution in terms of time and the computational resources typically available in biological laboratories. For biologists working on outbreak responses or pathogen discovery, both the accuracy of the assembly results and the speed of sequence analyses (e.g., assembly, alignment and pathogen classification) are crucial for crisis response and management. The ability to run analyses in the field on portable computer systems without internet connectivity is also important. Here, we explore the utility of data transform methods to extract major features from viral NGS sequence data and use the features to analyse data in a lower dimensional space.",

Data transform/approximation techniques include the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) [17] , the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) [18, 19] and piece-wise aggregate approximation (PAA) [20, 21] . The DFT or DWT are used to transform data to their frequency domains, allowing feature extraction [22] , and PAA is used as a data approximation approach. In data-intensive fields, data transformations/approximations are commonly used as dimensionality reduction approaches for obtaining fast approximate solutions for a given problem. Due to the ordered nature of genetic data, many of these transformation approaches can be applied to sequences of nucleotides [23] or amino acids [24] . An example of a successful implementation of a Fourier transform in computational biology is the multiple sequence alignment based on fast Fourier transform alignment algorithm MAFFT [25] where the physiochemical properties of amino acids are used to represent sequences for fast matching of homologous sequence regions for alignment. Since most transformation approaches are suitable only for numerical sequences, the strings of letters representing genetic sequences must be mapped into numerical space using a numerical sequence representation method [26] .",

The lower bounding property guarantees that if two data points are nearby in their original space, they will remain so in their transformed/approximate space. We employ the DFT and the DWT transformation methods and the PAA approximation method as they satisfy the above requirements, and these are widely used for analysing discrete signals [44] and can be used to transform/approximate nucleotide sequence numerical representations to different levels of resolution, permitting reduced dimensionality sequence analysis. Figure 1A illustrates an example of the DFT and DWT transformations and PAA approximation of a short nucleotide sequence. The DFT and the fast Fourier transform (FFT) convert data from their original domain into the frequency domain. In principle, the DFT decomposes a numerically represented nucleotide sequence with n positions (dimensions) into a series of n frequency components ordered by their frequency. A subset of the resulting Fourier frequencies are used to approximate the original sequence in a lower dimensional space [17] , and the tradeoff between analytical speed and accuracy can be varied according to the number of frequencies considered [45] .",

In the case of simulated data, information concerning the position of the read on the reference and alignment direction can be used to establish the correctness of alignment, and thereby provide a more informative F-measure score. Unclassified reads are considered a false negative result. Any reported match to the correct region of the genome in the correct direction is considered a true positive result. However, if the alignment position or direction information is unavailable, the F-measure can be calculated from the number of hits reported for a read, or the absence of a hit. Again, unclassified reads are considered false negative results, and classified reads are considered true positive results. In the case of mixed genome data, the F-measure score can be calculated by taking into consideration the number of hits that are reported for a read, as well as if a read is assigned to a reference genome from the same family.

The implementation was developed to evaluate our methodology but was not optimised for speed. Users might specify parameters, such as the representation method, transformation method, search stringency and the k-mer length. A VP-tree indexing structure classified reads using a given set of genomic references. VP-tree construction began with the extraction of all unique k-mers, of a user-specified length k, from the set of supplied reference genomes. Each unique k-mer was represented in numerical sequence and then transformed into a lower dimensional space. The transformed data were then used to generate the VP-tree indexing structure. Subsequently, each short read from a query set was converted into numerical space, transformed to a lower dimensional space and evaluated against the VP-tree. The approximate solution arising from this was then evaluated using the original data to identify false positive matches. The CBN algorithm generated two output files. The first output was a text file providing detailed information on all of the classification matches generated for each read, including the reference name, the direction in which the query read was aligned to the reference, the start and end position of the query on the reference, the alignment score, the CIGAR string describing how the read aligns with the reference and the actual alignment of the query read on the reference genome. The second tabular output file provided a brief overview of the alignment. Each line contained the name of the read, the number of classifications generated for that particular read, the highest classification score obtained, the name of the reference, which provided the highest classification score, the alignment direction and starting position on the reference.",

The derived contigs from each assembler were evaluated against the reference genomes used to generate the data simulations with BLASTn [54] . From the BLASTn output, information about the contigs' alignment position on the genome and the length of the alignment were obtained. Subsequently, a measure of assembly contiguity and the sum of gaps/mismatches were calculated and plotted on an X-Y matrix (similar to Figures 11 and 12 ) with x being the total coverage of the genomes generated and y being the total number of gaps in the coverage. A perfect assembly would have x = full genome length and y = 0, indicating that the contig is identical to the genome in terms of length and nucleotide composition. For the HIV-1 HXB2 datasets, the contigs were evaluated against the K03455 genome, and the contigs obtained from the mixed virus datasets were evaluated against the 15 Figure 11 .

Viruses 2019, 11, x FOR PEER REVIEW 18 of 23 Figure 12 . Accuracy of our prototype de novo assembly implementation and two established tools on mixed viruses simulated datasets. The contigs obtained for each assembler were evaluated against the reference genome that was used to generate the simulated data. BLASTn was used to align all contigs to an HIV-1 HXB2 reference genome and determine how much of the particular genome they cover. The y-axis indicates the number of gaps and mismatches that exist in the contigs obtained for each tool, and the x-axis depicts the length of the genome the reported contigs cover. The contigs obtained from the mixed virus simulated dataset were evaluated against the KM198529, KM198528, KM198511, KM198500, KM198486, KU296608, KU296553, KU296549, KU296528, KU296416, KP317952, KP317946, KP317934, KP317923 and KP317922 references genomes. Plots 11-i to 11-iv illustrate results obtained from all assemblers on data with 0%, 3%, 10% and 20% variation levels accordingly. Figure 11 illustrates the assembly results of SPAdes, Megahit and all three variants of ASBN on the 16 simulated HIV-1 HXB2 datasets. Figure 12 illustrates the assembly results on the mixed virus simulated databases. Although ASBN processes data and assembles short reads in a lower dimensional space, it nevertheless generated contigs that collectively cover the expected genome length and provided comparable results to both existing state of the art de novo assemblers tested in this experiment (Figures 11, 12) . In all cases, ASBN generated contigs spanning the whole genomes of their respective viral species.",

Whilst the error rate of Oxford Nanopore sequencing platform, for example, has decreased considerably since the technology's introduction [70, 71] , the relatively high error rate still limits the scope of downstream analyses [72] . Efficient algorithmic approaches are needed to (1) identify sequence identity/infer homology in spite of abundant insertion/deletion errors associated with the platform, which are problematic for approaches dependent on exact subsequence matching and (2) to overcome issues relating to high data dimensionality and the curse of dimensionality [73] . Both in terms of the raw electric current traces generated by DNA translocation through a nanopore and the corresponding base-called sequences, the resemblance between long reads and time series data from other fields is striking, such that the various transformations/approximations we have implemented will be directly applicable.",

By applying established signal decomposition methods, compressed representations of nucleotide sequences can be created, permitting reductions in the spatiotemporal complexity of their analysis, without necessarily compromising analytical accuracy.
