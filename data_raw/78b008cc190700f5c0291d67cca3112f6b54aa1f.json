We fitted a statistical model to these data; the shape of the curve strongly suggests that the process of virus discovery is far from complete. We generated a 95% credible interval for the pool of as yet undiscovered virus species of 38-562. We extrapolated the curve and generated an estimate of 10-40 new species to be discovered by 2020. Although we cannot predict the level of health threat that these new viruses will present, we conclude that novel virus species must be anticipated in public health planning. More systematic virus discovery programmes, covering both humans and potential animal reservoirs of human viruses, should be considered.",

Fewer than 200 of these are viruses, but novel virus species are being reported in humans at a rate of over two per year, much faster than for other kinds of pathogen ( Woolhouse & Gaunt 2007) . Novel viruses are a major public health concern, whether causing disease on the massive scale of HIV/AIDS, more transient events such as the SARS epidemic or potential future threats such as pandemic influenza. An analysis of temporal patterns of virus discovery is therefore of considerable interest.",

We gathered data for this curve by systematically searching the primary literature for first reports of human infection with each of the currently recognized virus species, using species as defined by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV; http://www.ictvonline.org/). We note that the set of viruses we are interested in-those that can infect humans-is a small subset of the total (over 1500 species according to ICTV ) and, as is discussed below, not a closed set because many of these viruses can also infect other hosts . We regard this as analogous to constructing species discovery curves for any subdivision of geographical range or habitat. As we demonstrate below, this approach yields an excellent description of the discovery curve.",

            "text": "We conclude that it is extremely probable that new human viruses will continue to be discovered in the immediate future; we are not yet close to the end of the virus discovery curve. As a direct result of this, it is not possible to estimate the size of the species pool for human viruses with precision. However, in contrast to the negative assessment by Bebber et al. (2007) of the use of incomplete species accumulation curves, we consider that the upper and lower limits to our estimate of the size of the species pool are of interest and also have practical implications. Current trends are consistent with a pool of at least 38 undiscovered species that will be reported at an average rate of at least approximately one per year to 2020. In this context, it is worth noting that three new species were reported in 2007: two polyoma viruses, Ki and Wu, and a reovirus, Melaka (Allander et al. 2007; Chua et al. 2007; Gaynor et al. 2007) . Other viruses may have been reported but not yet classified. In practice, future rates of discovery will, of course, be affected by any major advances in virus detection technology or by any major shifts (upwards or downwards) in the effort expended on virus discovery programmes. Tissue culture was regarded as the 'gold standard' for virus detection up until a few years ago when molecular methods came to the fore (Storch 2007) , although there has not been a detectable increase in discovery rates as a result. Indeed, it is striking that there have been no dramatic changes in the pattern of virus discovery for over 50 years; extrapolations from our data should therefore provide a useful benchmark for probable future discovery rates.",

            "text": "The upper limit for N is finite but large; we cannot rule out hundreds of novel human viruses to be reported in the future. There are two (not mutually exclusive) possible explanations for such a high level of diversity. First, it could reflect the largely unknown extant diversity of viruses in the non-human animal reservoirs that constitute the major source of emerging human pathogens Woolhouse & Gaunt 2007) . The majority of human viruses are known to be capable of infecting nonhuman hosts (almost exclusively mammals and birds), and the animal origin of many apparently novel human viruses (e.g. HIV1 and HIV2, SARS CoV, Nipah virus) has been frequently remarked upon (Morse 1995; Woolhouse & Gowtage-Sequeria 2005; Wolfe et al. 2007 ); indeed, recently discovered viruses are even more likely to be associated with a non-human reservoir ( Woolhouse & Gaunt 2007) . All these observations are consistent with the idea that a significant fraction of viruses discovered in the last few decades is ecological 'spillover' from animal populations rather than newly evolved specialist human viruses. We have very limited knowledge of the diversity of viruses present in most mammal and bird species (with most attention having been paid to viruses of domestic animals; Cleaveland et al. 2001) , so it is unclear for how long this process might continue. An alternative explanation for a large pool of human viruses is that this reflects a high rate of evolution (within a reservoir population) of truly novel species capable of infecting humans. This hypothesis is difficult to test directly without much more comprehensive sequence data from both human and non-human virus populations. We note that the finite upper limit for the current estimate of N does not necessarily imply that the process of virus discovery is not open-ended (as a result of the evolution of new species) since there could be a low background rate of virus evolution, which will remain once extant diversity has been fully revealed. The balance between revealing extant diversity and the continual evolution of new species could be explored using a more complex model than equation (2.1); however, the available data are insufficient to yield useful estimates of the additional parameters required.",

However, current approaches to virus discovery are largely passive, usually relying on investigation of reports of human disease with unfamiliar clinical symptoms and uncertain aetiology. Recently, there have been calls for more active discovery programmes for viruses and other pathogens involving 'systematic sampling and phylogeographic analysis of related pathogens in diverse animal species' ( Wolfe et al. 2007) .
