            "text": "In Escherichia coli, the MnmEG complex modifies transfer RNAs (tRNAs) decoding NNA/ NNG codons. MnmEG catalyzes two different modification reactions, which add an aminomethyl (nm) or carboxymethylaminomethyl (cmnm) group to position 5 of the anticodon wobble uridine using ammonium or glycine, respectively. In tRNA Gln cmnm5s2UUG and tRNA Leu cmnm5UmAA , however, cmnm 5 appears as the final modification, whereas in the remaining tRNAs, the MnmEG products are converted into 5-methylaminomethyl (mnm 5 ) through the two-domain, bi-functional enzyme MnmC. MnmC(o) transforms cmnm 5 into nm 5 , whereas MnmC(m) converts nm 5 into mnm 5 , thus producing an atypical network of modification pathways. We investigate the activities and tRNA specificity of MnmEG and the MnmC domains, the ability of tRNAs to follow the ammonium or glycine pathway and the effect of mnmC mutations on growth. We demonstrate that the two MnmC domains function independently of each other and that tRNA Gln cmnm5s2UUG and tRNA Leu cmnm5UmAA are substrates for MnmC(m), but not MnmC(o). Synthesis of mnm 5 s 2 U by MnmEG-MnmC in vivo avoids build-up of intermediates in tRNA Lys mnm5s2UUU . We also show that MnmEG can modify all the tRNAs via the ammonium pathway. Strikingly, the net output of the MnmEG pathways in vivo depends on growth conditions and tRNA species. Loss of any MnmC activity has a biological cost under specific conditions.",

            "text": "Proteins MnmE and MnmG (formerly TrmE and GidA, respectively) are evolutionary conserved from bacteria to eukaryotic organelles. In Escherichia coli, they are involved in the modification of the wobble uridine of tRNA Lys mnm5s2UUU , tRNA Glu mnm5s2UUC , tRNA Gln cmnm5s2UUG , tRNA Leu cmnm5UmAA , tRNA Arg mnm5UCU and tRNA Gly mnm5UCC , all of which read NNA/G codons of the split codon boxes, with the exception of tRNA Gly mnm5UCC , which reads codons of the glycine family box (11) . MnmE and MnmG are dimeric and form a functional a2b2 heterotetrameric complex (MnmEG) in which both proteins are interdependent (12, 13) . MnmE is a GTP-and tetrahydrofolate (THF)-binding protein, whereas MnmG is a FAD-and NADH-binding protein (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) . The MnmEG complex catalyzes the addition of the aminomethyl (nm) and carboxymethylaminomethyl (cmnm) groups to position 5 of the wobble uridine using ammonium and glycine, respectively [ Figure 1 ; (13) ]. Both reactions require GTP and FAD as well as NADH if FAD is limiting in the in vitro reaction. Moreover, a THF derivative, likely methylene-THF, serves as the donor of the methylene carbon that is directly bonded to the C5 atom of U34. However, the detailed mechanism of the basic reaction has not yet been demonstrated (11, 13) . According to current models, GTP hydrolysis by the MnmE G-domain, which is located distant from the MnmEG active center, leads to structural rearrangements in the MnmEG complex, which are essential for tRNA modification (11, 19) .",

Formation of the mnm 5 -final group is mediated by the action of the twodomain, bi-functional enzyme MnmC (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) . The oxidoreductase activity of the C-terminal domain, here designated as MnmC(o), is responsible for the FADdependent deacetylation that transforms cmnm 5 U into nm 5 U, whereas the methyltransferase activity of the N-terminal domain, designated as MnmC(m), catalyzes the SAM-dependent methylation that transforms nm 5 U to mnm 5 U (Figure 1 ).",

The structure also reveals that the two catalytic centers of MnmC(o) and MnmC(m) face opposite sides of the protein, thus favoring a model in which the two domains could function in a relatively independent manner. In fact, when two MnmC mutant proteins possessing a catalytically dead MnmC(o) or MnmC(m) domain were mixed, partial recovery of mnm 5 -group synthesis was observed (25) . However, considering the relatively hydrophilic nature of the domain interface, the possibility that conformational changes within the entire MnmC protein may occur in vivo and affect its functioning, cannot be excluded. A previous attempt to separately express both MnmC domains revealed that MnmC(m) was soluble, whereas MnmC(o) produced inclusion bodies, suggesting that MnmC(m) is required for the correct folding or structural stability of MnmC(o) (25) .",

            "text": "How the activities of the MnmEG and MnmC enzymes are organized and modulated remains unclear. Whether tRNAs preferentially utilize one of the two MnmEG pathways, the glycine or the ammonium pathway (Figure 1 ), in vivo depending on metabolic circumstances has not been investigated. The fact that only cmnm 5 , but not nm 5 or mnm 5 has been detected to date at position 5 of U34 in tRNA Gln cmnm5s2UUG and tRNA Leu cmnm5UmAA suggests that both tRNAs do not use the ammonium pathway and are not substrates for MnmC(o). Accumulation of the nm 5 s 2 U nucleoside which may have a dual origin [ Figure 1 ; (13) ], has not been observed in total tRNA purified from wild-type E. coli cells (23) . Therefore, the mnm 5 s 2 U synthesis in tRNA Lys mnm5s2UUU and tRNA Glu mnm5s2UUC appears to be organized to prevent nm 5 s 2 U accumulation. However, the presence or absence of cmnm 5 s 2 U as an intermediate in mnm 5 s 2 U biosynthesis is difficult to determine from nucleoside analysis of bulk tRNA due to the natural occurrence of cmnm 5 s 2 U in tRNA Gln cmnm5s2UUG . Biosynthetic tuning of mnm 5 s 2 U to avoid the accumulation of intermediates could be achieved by either kinetic tuning of the activities of MnmEG and MnmC, which requires that the sequential modifications are performed at similar or increasing rates or selective degradation of partially modified tRNAs. A previous steady-state kinetic analysis of the activities of the full MnmC protein indicated that the MnmC(m)dependent reaction (nm 5 !mnm 5 ) occurs faster than the MnmC(o)-dependent reaction (cmnm 5 !nm 5 ) or at a similar rate at very high substrate (tRNA) concentrations (26) . However, this study did not take into account the efficiency of the reactions performed by MnmEG (Figure 1 ), which is crucial to understand the organization of the mnm 5 s 2 U biosynthetic process.",

The overproduction of tRNAs in strains transformed with pBSKrna derivative plasmids was performed as described previously (37) . Specific chimeric tRNAs were purified from bulk tRNA by the Chaplet Column Chromatography method (38) using a biotinylated DNA probe that is complementary to the scaffold human cytosolic tRNA Lys 3 moiety (common to all chimeric tRNAs).

A previous attempt to purify this domain was unsuccessful because overexpression of a somewhat different, recombinant MnmC(o) produced inclusion bodies, which led to the hypothesis that MnmC(o) is incapable of folding on its own and requires the presence of MnmC(m) (25) . Our data, however, demonstrate that MnmC(o) can fold independently of MnmC(m).

The strain with the null mutation mnmC-W131stop (IC6019) was transformed with pBAD-TOPO and its derivative pIC1339 expressing MnmC(o), whereas strain mnmC(m)-G68D (IC6018) was transformed with pBAD-TOPO and its derivative pIC1340 expressing MnmC(m). In the resulting strains, which were grown to exponential phase in the presence of the arabinose inducer, the recombinant MnmC(o) protein catalyzed the conversion of cmnm 5 s 2 U into nm 5 s 2 U, although a peak of remnant cmnm 5 s 2 U was observed ( Figure 3C ) and nm 5 s 2 U was fully transformed to mnm 5 s 2 U by MnmC(m) ( Figure 3D ). Similar results were obtained in the absence of arabinose (data not shown). This finding indicates that recombinant MnmC(o) and MnmC(m) are expressed and accumulate to some extent in the absence of the inducer, although it was not possible to detect them by western blotting with an anti-Flag antibody (data not shown). The fact that both proteins were capable of modifying tRNA despite their very low concentrations suggests that these proteins have high activity in vivo. those exhibited by the entire MnmC protein, we conducted steady-state kinetic experiments. The conditions used for each reaction were similar to enable a comparison of the kinetic constants and were based on conditions known to optimize activity (23, 26) . The substrate for the assays was a chimeric version of E. coli tRNA Lys mnm5s2UUU expressed from pBSKrna (37, 42) , which facilitates overproduction and purification of recombinant RNA and has been successfully used by our group in previous studies (21, 33) . Here, the tRNA Lys mnm5s2UUU gene was inserted into the EcoRV site of the region encoding the scaffold tRNA (a human cytosolic tRNA Lys 3 lacking the anticodon region). The resulting chimeric tRNA essentially contained the complete E. coli tRNA Lys mnm5s2UUU sequence fused at its 5 0 -and 3 0 -ends to the truncated anticodon stem of human cytosolic tRNA Lys 3 , producing an RNA of $170 nt (Supplementary Figure S2) .",

The presence of modification intermediates in the tRNA purified from a wildtype strain would be indicative of the MnmEG and MnmC activities not being kinetically tuned. HPLC analysis of native tRNA Lys mnm5s2UUU purified during the exponential phase revealed no accumulation of the cmnm 5 s 2 U intermediate in the wild-type strain ( Figure 4A ), whereas this nucleoside was predominant in the tRNA extracted from the \u00c1mnmC strain ( Figure 4B ). Moreover, we observed no nm 5 s 2 U in the native tRNA Lys mnm5s2UUU purified from the wild-type strain ( Figure 4A Figure 4C ). These results suggest that tRNA Lys mnm5s2UUU containing cmnm 5 s 2 U or nm 5 s 2 U at the wobble position is stable, and consequently that the disappearance of these intermediates in the wild-type strain is probably due to their conversion into mnm 5 s 2 U by MnmC activities.",

These data suggest that tRNA Gln cmnm5s2UUG and tRNA Leu cmnm5UmAA are not substrates for MnmC(o). Moreover, they raise the question of what happens with the ammonium pathway of the MnmEG complex, which theoretically produces nm 5 U in all its tRNA substrates ( Figure 1) . Interestingly, the analysis of gln1 tRNA from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium indicated that 80% of the molecules contained cmnm 5 s 2 U, whereas the remaining 20% contained mnm 5 s 2 U (44). In this case, we speculate that mnm 5 s 2 U might be synthesized by MnmC [using the MnmC(m) activity] from the nm 5 s 2 U generated via the ammonium-dependent MnmEG pathway. Therefore, we decided to investigate whether a fraction of tRNA Gln cmnm5s2UUG and tRNA Leu cmnm5UmAA in E. coli contains mnm at position 5 in the wobble uridine, and whether both tRNAs function as substrates for MnmC(m) but not MnmC(o) (Figure 1 ).",

Selected strains were transformed with the resulting plasmids. We then examined the HPLC profile of the overexpressed, 'native' tRNAs purified from cultures grown overnight to the stationary phase. It should be noted that the expression of the tRNA genes in these constructs was under the control of the strong constitutive lpp promoter (37) . As mutations leading to reduced expression might be selected over time because overexpression ultimately slows growth, the fresh transformation of cells with the pBSKrna derivatives every time and overnight incubation of the transformed cells prior to the purification of the cloned target (in this case, tRNAs) are highly recommended (37) .",

This result was expected, considering that cmnm 5 s 2 U was transformed into nm 5 s 2 U by the MnmC(o) activity present in the mnmC(m)-G68D strain. Interestingly, the HPLC profiles of tRNA Gln cmnm5s2UUG purified from the mnmC(m)-G68D and mnmC-W131stop strains were similar ( Figure 5B ). In both cases, cmnm 5 s 2 U was much more abundant than nm 5 s 2 U, suggesting that the MnmC(o) activity present in the mnmC(m)-G68D strain did not function in tRNA Gln cmnm5s2UUG . Overexpression of tRNAs often causes hypomodification. In fact, the hypomodified nucleoside s 2 U, resulting from the action of MnmA, was relatively abundant in the overexpressed tRNA Lys mnm5s2UUU and tRNA Gln cmnm5s2UUG (data not shown). Nevertheless, s 2 U accumulated at a similar proportion in all tested strains so that the ratios of the nucleosides of interest (mnm 5 s 2 U, cmnm 5 s 2 U and nm 5 s 2 U) were not greatly affected. When the tRNA Lys mnm5s2UUU and tRNA Gln cmnm5s2UUG hydrolysates were monitored at 254 nm, the non-thiolated nucleosides nm 5 U, mnm 5 U, cmnm 5 U were hardly detected (data not shown). Therefore, we think that the different HPLC pattern of tRNA Lys mnm5s2UUU and tRNA Gln cmnm5s2UUG in the mnmC(m)-G68D strain cannot be attributed to the presence of hypomodified nucleosides. Rather, it reveals that tRNA Gln cmnm5s2UUG is not a substrate for MnmC(o). We also analyzed the HPLC profile of tRNA Leu cmnm5UmAA purified from a trmL strain in which the methylation of the ribose in the wobble uridine is impaired due to the \u00c1trmL mutation (21) . We adopted this approach to examine the modification of tRNA Leu cmnm5UmAA because we were unable to distinguish nucleosides cmnm 5 U m , nm 5 U m and mnm 5 U m in our HPLC chromatograms. However, we were able to identify the peaks corresponding to cmnm 5 U, nm 5 U and mnm 5 U using proper markers ( Figure 5C ). As shown in Figure 5D , overexpressed tRNA Leu cmnm5UmAA purified from a \u00c1trmL strain contained cmnm 5 U. However, no traces of mnm 5 U or nm 5 U were detected in this tRNA. Similar results were obtained when analyzing native, non-overexpressed tRNA Leu cmnm5UmAA purified in the exponential phase ( Figure 5E ). Altogether, these data suggest that tRNA Leu cmnm5UmAA is not modified by the ammonium-dependent MnmEG pathway and that it is not a substrate for MnmC(o).",

However, the strain carrying an mnmC-W131stop or mnmC(o) null mutation (Figure 7 , panels C and D) revealed that the level of cmnm 5 s 2 U and nm 5 s 2 U or mnm 5 s 2 U in bulk tRNA depends on the growth phase; nm 5 s 2 U (or mnm 5 s 2 U) accumulates as optical density increases, whereas cmnm 5 s 2 U exhibits the opposite trend and becomes the minor component at an OD 600 of $2.0. As the data in Figure 7 represent the relative distribution of each nucleoside with respect to the sum of the peak areas of the two nucleosides, it is important to point out that the net decrease in the cmnm 5 s 2 U peak area along the growth curve was concomitant with the net increase in the nm 5 s 2 U or mnm 5 s 2 U area.",

No differences between mnmC and wild-type strains were initially reported (22, 45) . However, more recently, Pearson and Carell (26) knockout strain from the Keio collection and observed a larger growth constant for the wild-type strain, in agreement with the hypothesis that accumulation of intermediates in the synthesis of mnm 5 (s 2 )U affects the translation process negatively. We investigated the effect of mnmC mutations on growth rate in different genetic backgrounds and did not observe significant differences between the wild-type strain and any derivative carrying an mnmC allele [DmnmC, mnmC-W131stop, DmnmC(o) and mnmC(m)-G68D; Table 6 ]. We cannot explain why our results differ from those reported by Pearson and Carell (26) , even when the same background (BW25113) was used. Perhaps, the dilution method used to maintain the pre-cultures in exponential growth could explain the different results. We took great care to not dilute the precultures below an OD 600 of 0.25 and to not exceed an OD 600 of 0.5 in order to avoid major changes under the exponential growth conditions. The lack of effect in our hands of mnmC mutations during the exponential growth of cells contrasts with the behavior of mnmE-and mnmG-knockout strains, which, as we have previously demonstrated, grow slower than the wild-type strain (12, 32) . These data suggest that the lack of any modification at the wobble uridine is more deleterious to the cell than the presence of any intermediate of mnm 5 (s 2 ) synthesis. Supporting this conclusion, we also observed that the mnmC mutations, unlike the mnmE mutations, did not affect resistance to acid stress of E. coli (Figure 8 ). This resistance depends on several systems, one of which involves proteins whose translation likely depends on tRNAs modified by MnmEG (39, 46) .",

We demonstrate for the first time that the MnmC(o) domain can fold independently of MnmC(m) and that both domains are catalytically active when expressed separately. Importantly, the domains exhibit similar kinetic properties to those observed in the entire MnmC protein, which suggests that the two domains operate independently of each other. Moreover, MnmC(o) and MnmC(m) differ in terms of their specificity for tRNA substrates. Thus, MnmC(o) modifies tRNA Lys mnm5s2UUU , but not tRNA Gln cmnm5s2UUG and tRNA Leu cmnm5UmAA . In contrast, all three tRNAs (tRNA Lys mnm5s2UUU , tRNA Gln cmm5s2UUG and tRNA Leu cmnm5UmAA ) serve as substrates for MnmC(m) not only in vitro, but also in vivo at least in the cases of tRNA Lys mnm5s2UUU and tRNA Gln cmm5s2UUG . These data strongly support the notion that the MnmC(o) and MnmC(m) domains function independently. The presence of mnm 5 s 2 U in in vivo synthesized tRNA Gln cmnm5s2UUG suggests that the nomenclature of this tRNA should be changed to tRNA Gln \u00f0c\u00demnm5s2UUG . Sequence searches of complete genomes have revealed that the distribution of the putative orthologs of the E. coli bi-functional MnmC protein are conserved only in g-proteobacteria, with some additional members in other bacterial classes (24) . Interestingly, in several genomes, potential orthologs of a single domain have been identified (24) , but the biological function has been experimentally demonstrated only in the case of the Aquifex aeolicus DUF752 protein, an MnmC(m) homolog (41) . It is unclear from the phylogenetic analysis whether the independent putative orthologs represent the ancestral or derived versions of the bi-functional MnmC enzyme (24) . The ability of the E. coli MnmC(o) and MnmC(m) domains to function independent of each other, as shown in this work, suggests that the origin of the full MnmC protein present in g-Proteobacteria (24) likely occurred by domain fusion. The MnmC(o)-MnmC(m) fusion in E. coli suggests a functional advantage of the spatial proximity of both domains. The fusion could increase the stability of the resulting protein. In fact, our results indicate that the entire MnmC protein is substantially more stable than the separate domains ( Figure 2C ) or other RNA modification proteins, such as RsmG or MnmG, which have half-lives of $17 and 31 min, respectively (48) . The possibility that the fusion also facilitates the functional cooperation between the domains during modification of tRNAs following the 'canonical' MnmEG-MnmC(o)-MnmC(m) pathway (cmnm 5 U!nm 5 U!mnm 5 U) cannot be ruled out. A better understanding of how the MnmC protein functions will entail determining whether the binding of a tRNA molecule to one domain exerts a negative allosteric effect on the other domain. In this respect, the structural characterization of MnmC-tRNA complexes could prove helpful.",

In Aquifex aeolicus, an interaction between the E. coli MnmC(m) homolog, protein DUF752 and the A. aeolicus MnmE and MnmG proteins has been observed (41) . In E. coli, we did not detect interaction of MnmC with MnmE or MnmG by either fast-performance liquid chromatography (FPLC) analysis ( Figure 2F ) or SPR (data not shown). However, we cannot rule out the possibility of the MnmEG complex being able to interact with MnmC in vivo. It appears reasonable to hypothesize that the spatial clustering of tRNA-modifying enzymes within the cell can optimize the coordination of their work. Therefore, one challenging aim for future studies is to determine whether tRNA modifying enzymes are spatially organized, as observed for other enzymes involved in RNA biology, such as the components of the RNA degradosome (50) .",

The analysis of bulk tRNA indicates that when DmnmC(o) or DmnmC strains are grown in LBT, the glycine pathway prevails over the ammonium pathway in the exponential phase as cmnm 5 s 2 U is the most abundant nucleoside ( Figure 9A ). However, a gradual change in the output of both pathways is observed along the growth curve so that the nucleosides produced by the ammonium pathway become prevalent during entry into the stationary phase ( Figure 9B ). In contrast, when cells are grown in minimal medium, the glycine pathway is prevalent in both the exponential and stationary phases ( Figure 9A) .

In contrast, MnmC(o) plays a minor role when the ammonium pathway prevails; i.e. during the transition to stationary phase of cultures growing in LBT. In this case, the methylase activity of MnmC(m) functions fairly well alone [i.e. without the participation of MnmC(o)] to drive the production of the final modification mnm 5 (s 2 )U by transforming the intermediate nm 5 (s 2 ) generated by the more active ammonium pathway (Table 4 and Figure 9B ). Thus, the incorporation of MnmC(o) and MnmC(m) into the enzyme content of E. coli extends the adaptability of this bacterium to changing growth conditions.

Here our functional studies suggest that MnmC impairment is less detrimental than the inactivation of the MnmEG complex given that mnmC mutations neither reduce the growth rate in rich medium (Table 6 ) nor affect resistance to acidic pH ( Figure 8) . Nevertheless, impairment of any MnmC activity has a biological cost. Thus, mnmC mutations diminish the ability of cells to compete ( Table 7) , suggesting that fully modified tRNAs and, therefore the activities of MnmC, are required for efficient translation of mRNAs involved in the stationary phase stress response. In addition, our data indicate that mnmC mutations slow the growth rate of a mnmA strain, revealing a synergistic effect of mutations mnmC and mnmA. As mnmC mutations alone do not affect the growth rate, we hypothesize that the presence of the MnmA-dependent thiolation at position 2 of U34 in a subset of tRNAs can compensate for the lack of MnmC modifications at position 5 during exponential growth.",

During the transition to the stationary phase, nm 5 (s 2 )U is more abundant in mnmC(m)-G68D than in mnmC-W131stop (Figure 7 , panels B and C). Therefore, the slightly better ability of the mnmC(m)-G68D mutant to compete might indicate that nm 5 (s 2 )U is more effective than cmnm 5 (s 2 )U in translating mRNAs required to sustain stationary phase stress conditions. Thus, it appears that the advantages offered by each intermediate, nm 5 (s 2 )U and cmnm 5 (s 2 )U, depend on the nature of the mRNAs to be translated which, in turn, depend on the growth conditions. Obviously, the synthesis of the final modification mnm 5 s 2 U is more advantageous to the cell as the strains expressing a fully active MnmC protein grow better under stressing conditions (i.e. those related to lack of MnmA and competition with other bacteria) than those strains lacking any MnmC activity. In conclusion, adaptation of MnmEG to use ammonium or glycine, together with the acquisition of MnmC(o) and MnmC(m) activities, provide E. coli with significant advantages to synthesize mnm 5 s 2 U and to survive under different conditions.",
