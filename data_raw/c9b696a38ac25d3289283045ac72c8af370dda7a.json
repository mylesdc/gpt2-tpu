This study examined the transcriptome of tracheal epithelial cells from two inbred chicken lines that differ in NDV susceptibility after challenge with a high-titer inoculum of lentogenic NDV. The Fayoumi line had a significantly lower NDV load postchallenge than the Leghorn line, demonstrating the Fayoumi line's classification as a relatively NDV-resistant breed. Examination of the trachea transcriptome showed a large increase in immune cell infiltration in the trachea in both lines at all times postinfection. The pathways conserved across lines and at all three time points postinfection included iCOS-iCOSL signaling in T helper cells, NF-B signaling, the role of nuclear factor of activated T cells in the regulation of the immune response, calcium-induced T lymphocyte apoptosis, phospholipase C signaling, and CD28 signaling in T helper cells. Although shared pathways were seen in the Fayoumi and Leghorn lines, each line showed unique responses as well. The downregulation of collagen and the activation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 signaling in the Fayoumis relative to the Leghorns at 2 days postinfection may contribute to the resistance phenotype seen in the Fayoumis. This study provides a further understanding of host-pathogen interactions which could improve vaccine efficacy and, in combination with genome-wide association studies, has the potential to advance strategies for breeding chickens with enhanced resistance to NDV.",

The strains of NDV are divided into three major categories ranging from low to high virulence: lentogenic, mesogenic, and velogenic (8) . The intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) is used to differentiate and classify NDV according to its virulence (8) , which is largely determined by the F protein cleavage site (9) . Although the strains differ in their virulence, all belong to the same serotype, thus enabling the use of lentogenic viruses as vaccines for protection against the more virulent strains. Although infections by lentogenic strains are rare, clinical signs associated with infections by lentogenic strains are nonspecific and include ruffled feathers, anorexia, decreased egg production, and respiratory infection in birds with a compromised immune system (5, 6, 10) .",

Bone marrow-derived dendritic cells from these two lines showed increased phagocytic ability, nitric oxide production, and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II surface expression (30) . Here the Fayoumi and Leghorn lines were used as a discovery platform to identify mechanisms of resistance to NDV. We hypothesized that the Fayoumis are more resistant to NDV, as shown by a lower viral load and a higher antibody titer. The term \"resistance,\" as used in the current study, is defined as the ability of the host to interfere with the pathogen life cycle (31) . The term resistance in this context is not absolute; therefore, the host may still become infected and succumb to infections caused by virulent NDV strains. Comparison of the two lines' responses to NDV may designate genes/pathways associated with the resistance of the Fayoumi line. The information generated by this study will be beneficial for vaccine development and other control strategies.",

The clustering grouped the major contrasts by dpi, with the Fayoumis at 6 dpi being the outlier ( Fig. 6 ).

The eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2) signaling pathway had the highest positive Z-score (Fig. 8) , suggesting strong activation of this pathway in the Fayoumi chickens relative to the Leghorn chickens.",

This study predicted the enrichment of immune cells in the trachea in challenged birds of both lines at all times. One pathway that was instrumental in leukocyte migration was leukocyte extravasation signaling. On the basis of the expression of genes within this pathway, IPA predicted the activation of actin cytoskeleton contraction and cell mobility. A previous study examining gene expression levels in the lung after challenge with AIV in the same experimental lines showed an upregulation of FIG 6 Pathways predicted to be activated or inhibited in response to NDV in the six major contrasts. For all genes, the absolute LFC was \u03fe1 and the FDR was \u03fd0.05. (A) The heat map, generated by Qiagen IPA software, shows pathways that were either activated (orange), inhibited (blue), or unchanged (white) when the findings for the challenged and nonchallenged birds within each line were contrasted at the three separate time points.

Actin cytoskeleton activation is crucial for cell migration, as leukocytes use actin polymerization and actomyosin contraction for movement. Notably, paramyxoviruses like NDV also require actin to replicate efficiently (32, 33) . If the migrating cells become infected with the virus, a conundrum may be created for the host. In one study, there was a downregulation of actin-related genes after challenge with NDV in vitro (34) . Due to challenge with infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), the proteins involved in cytoskeleton organization differed in expression in the trachea depending on IBV virulence (35) . The host must find a way to balance the costs and benefits of cytoskeleton upregulation with defense against viral infection. The regulation of cytoskeleton-and actin-related genes may be time dependent and may be a critical target for future study.",

The use of two unique inbred lines that differ in their relative resistance offered a valuable tool for comparison. Fayoumis had significantly less detectable virus at 2 dpi (measured by RNA-seq) and 6 dpi (measured by qPCR), which may result in faster viral clearing and which, overall, supports their relatively resistant phenotype compared to the phenotype of the Leghorns. A decreased viral load corresponds to less viral shedding and, therefore, fewer viral particles in the environment and a lower transmission potential (36) . In a separate study with the same two genetic lines, although all birds succumbed to infection with velogenic NDV, the mean survival time was longer for the Fayoumis than the Leghorns at all four doses tested and was significantly longer at the two higher doses (P. Miller and C. Afonso, SEPRL, Athens, GA, personal communication, 2016). As the time postinfection increased, the numbers of DEG between challenged and nonchallenged birds decreased, suggesting that the chickens were recovering. The Fayoumis had many fewer DEG at 6 dpi than the Leghorns, which may be further evidence that the Fayoumis recovered more quickly. Although most pathways had similar predicted levels of activation or inhibition in the two lines, the lines often differed in gene expression levels within the pathway (Fig. 5) . The current study identified several genes whose expression levels were impacted significantly by both line and challenge (Table 2) , and some of these overlapped those from a previous (29) . These genes may be of particular importance in the host response to both AIV and NDV. The wide range of pathogens (parasites, bacteria, viruses) to which the Fayoumis have shown relative resistance suggests that the mechanism(s) for their resistance may function early in the immune response (26, 27, 29) . Downregulation of collagen at 2 dpi in the challenged Fayoumis could be partially responsible for their resistant phenotype. One study found lower levels of expression of collagen mRNA in the trachea of resistant chickens (noninbred Cornell chickens) than susceptible chickens (inbred White Leghorn chickens) after challenge with IBV (37) . The downregulation of collagen may impact apoptosis (38) , immune cell migration (39) (40) (41) , and T-cell activation (42) (43) (44) (45) (46) ; impacting these processes would likely impact the virus and its pathogenesis.",

Laminin, another key extracellular matrix protein (39) , was also upregulated in the Leghorns relative to the Fayoumis. The impact of collagen was shown in two separate contrasts. The downregulation of collagen between challenged and nonchallenged Fayoumis and the activation of collagen-related pathways in the Leghorns relative to the Fayoumis give more confidence in the importance of collagen at 2 dpi. The activation of the protein kinase R (PKR)/eIF2 signaling cascade is known to inhibit NDV replication (47) , likely due to the actions of the antiviral protein PKR. This pathway, involved in mRNA translation, was more upregulated in the Fayoumis than the Leghorns (Fig. 8) . This finding was in agreement with the Fayoumis' resistant phenotype and may be related to the lower viral load seen at 6 dpi. The phosphorylation of eIF2\u2423 results in apoptosis due to a global termination of transcription (48) . Apoptosis-related pathways were activated, including T lymphocyte apoptosis, p53 signaling, retinoic acid-mediated apoptosis signaling, and apoptosis signaling (Fig. 6) . The eIF2 signaling pathway was also identified to be differentially methylated between chickens that were either vaccinated or not for infectious laryngotracheitis (48) .

The identifiers of the transcripts unrecognized by IPA were converted to a recognized identifier using BioMart software (http://uswest.ensembl.org/biomart/martview/) to ensure that the maximum number of transcripts was included for pathway analysis. The genes used for pathway analysis had an FDR of \u03fd0.05 and an absolute log 2 fold change (LFC) of \u03fe1, as estimated by the edgeR package. Fluidigm Biomark HD system. To validate the RNA-seq results, the Fluidigm Biomark HD system (Fluidigm, South San Francisco, CA) was used as a method of high-throughput qPCR. The input RNA (25 ng/l) came from the same isolate used for cDNA library construction. The 48 RNA samples were converted into cDNA, preamplified for 12 cycles with all 48 primer pairs (Table 3) , treated with exonuclease, diluted 10-fold, and analyzed on the 48.48 integrated fluidic circuit (IFC) for a total of 2,304 sample \u00b7 gene tests. The genes were chosen to represent the range of log fold changes; not all genes were DE. Ribosomal protein L4 (RPL4) and hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (H6PD) were two housekeeping genes with a high raw cycle threshold (C T ) value correlation (r \u03ed 0.9). Since its C T values were closer to the average C T values for all primers and samples, H6PD was used as the housekeeping gene for the analysis. Data were filtered by Fluidigm quality assessment and melting curve consistency. If, after these filtering steps, primer pairs did not have more than 28 samples remaining, all measurements for that gene were excluded. A total of 9.5% of the data, including those for four genes (MZB1, 5_8S_rRNA, UbI, and GAL2), were excluded from the analysis. Table 3 shows the genes and primers analyzed in this study.",
