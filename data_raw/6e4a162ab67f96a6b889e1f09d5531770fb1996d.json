In the present study, we isolated an RNA aptamer specific to the glycosylated receptor-binding domain of the HA protein (gHA1) after 12 cycles of the systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment procedure (SELEX), and we then investigated if the selected aptamer suppresses viral infection in host cells. Nitrocellulose filter binding and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) experiments revealed that 1 RNA aptamer, HA12-16, bound specifically to the gHA1 protein. Cell viability assay showed that the HA12-16 RNA aptamer suppressed viral infection in host cells by enhancing cell viability. Immunofluorescence microscopic analysis further demonstrated that the HA12-16 RNA aptamer suppresses viral attachment to host cells by neutralizing the receptor-binding site of influenza virus HA. These results indicate that the isolated RNA aptamer can be developed as an antiviral reagent against influenza through appropriate therapeutic formulation.",

HA is a homotrimeric transmembrane protein with a globular head and a stem region that are both exposed to the outside of the membrane [5] . These regions contain N-linked oligosaccharides [6] , which have been known to affect the functional properties of HA [7, 8] . Glycosylation sites in the peptide sequences are highly conserved, indicating functional significance for HA glycosylation [9] . HA is synthesized as a precursor protein (HA0) that undergoes proteolytic cleavage into HA1 and HA2 subunits; HA1 mediates initial contact with the cell membrane, and HA2 is responsible for membrane fusion [10, 11] . HA is the primary target for antiviral agents such as infectivity-neutralizing antibodies [4] and nucleic acid aptamers [12] . The recombinant HA1 subunit, expressed and purified from bacteria, induces an immune response against the influenza virus in humans [13] and is sufficient for screening antiviral RNA aptamers [14] . The recombinant HA protein, which retains glycosylation, has been expressed and produced in a baculovirus/insect cell system, which exhibited enhanced HA inhibition and virus neutralization [15] .",

They are usually obtained from an oligonucleotide library harboring random sequences by using the SELEX (Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential enrichment) method [16, 17] . Compared with protein antibodies, aptamers have many advantages over protein antibodies, such as high affinity, rapid synthesis, low cost, low-temperature sensitivity, large-scale production, and ease of chemical modification [12] . To date, aptamers have been used in a wide range of applications as research reagents, for medical diagnosis, and as biosensor or therapeutic tools against viruses and cancer. [18, 19] . Previously, our group selected an RNA aptamer against HA1 of subtype H5 AIV, which specifically binds to HA1 and inhibits hemagglutination of erythrocytes in vitro [14] . The HA1-specific RNA aptamer HAS15-5 was screened using the recombinant HA1-GST fusion protein that lacks glycosylation because of its expression in bacteria [14] . However, RNA aptamers specific to glycosylated HA rather than unglycosylated HA would be preferable for blocking and inhibiting influenza virus entry into host cells.",

The population frequency of the selected RNA aptamers was 42.3.26.9.19.2.11.5% in decreasing percentage ranks (Fig. 2B) .

The gHA1 protein charged in Ni-NTA spin trap columns was eluted with buffer solution containing the initial RNA pool, the 5th, 9th, and 12th round RNA pools, or no RNA (negative control, NC). Elution with imidazole buffer was collected and subjected to RT-RCR. Amplified cDNAs indicating the gHA1-bound RNAs were stained with ethidium bromide on 1.5% agarose gel after electrophoresis and were quantified. Relative amounts of the gHA1-bound RNAs are shown in the graph. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0097574.g004 Figure 5 . Affinity measurements of selected RNA aptamers to gHA1. (A) Each 32 P end-labeled RNA aptamer was incubated with gHA1, and the reaction sample was then filtered through a pre-wetted nitrocellulose membrane and applied to the double-filter dot-blot apparatus. The amounts of 32 P end-labeled RNA aptamers retained on the membrane in the presence of gHA1 were radioactively measured and quantified. Percentage binding to the gHA1 protein relative to the highest value is shown in the graph. (B) The immobilized gHA1 protein (0.5 mg) was incubated with each 39-biotinylated RNA sample (30 ng) as indicated. After addition of streptavidin-conjugated HRP, the amount of the gHA1-aptamer complex was measured by absorbance reading at 450 nm. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0097574.g005 specific to the gHA1 protein. The 4 RNA aptamer sequences identified in the 12th selection pool were predicted for the secondary structures of RNA using the M-Fold program, which is based on Zuker's algorithm [21] . RNA aptamers appear to contain a number of stem and loop structures, in which conserved sequences mostly reside at the stemand-loop region in the RNA secondary structure (Fig. 3) . These conserved sequences in each RNA aptamer are believed to be exposed to facilitate interactions with the HA1 protein [14, 20, 25] . The conserved sequences could constitute a binding motif specific to gHA1, whereas the stem structures of other sequences could merely stabilize the secondary structure of RNA.",

The presence of the influenza virus was fluorescently analyzed by FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies bound to anti-HA primary antibodies. MDCK cells infected with the viruses were noticeably fluorescent because of the viruses attached to the cell membrane, whereas addition of the HA12-16 aptamer significantly reduced the FITC-fluorescence owing to the suppression of viral attachment to the cell membrane through aptamer-gHA1 binding (Fig. 6B) . When the cells were only treated with the HA12-16 aptamer, FITC fluorescence on the cells appeared to be similar to the one treated with the viruses plus the aptamer.

The HA1 gene was cloned from subtype H5 of AIV and expressed in insect cells, and the glycosylated recombinant HA1 protein was purified for screening of RNA aptamers. Glycosylation of the purified HA1 protein was confirmed by cleaving glycans with PNGase F. After the 12 rounds of iterative SELEX, the RNA pool that binds to the gHA1 protein was cloned and sequenced, and RNA secondary structures were predicted. Among the 4 representative RNA aptamer candidates, HA12-16 was chosen because of its high binding affinity to gHA1 and suppression of viral infection in host cells. These results suggest that the RNA aptamer can recognize the viral HA, likely at or around the receptor binding region required for the penetration of influenza virus into host cells [27] . Interestingly, the previously selected RNA aptamer against the unglycosylated HA (HAS15-5) failed to inhibit viral infection in host cells. Thus, the HA12-16 aptamer isolated in this study is expected to interrupt influenza invasion through specific binding to the glycosylated ectodomain of HA, which is crucial for viral attachment to the host cell membrane. In future research, the selected RNA aptamers should be modified to improve stability by base modification of nucleotides, capping of RNA fragments, and end-labeling with appropriate chemicals resistant to RNase. If a stable RNA aptamer is combined with an appropriate RNA delivery method, which is necessary for therapeutic use [28] , it can be used as an antiviral reagent that is comparable to antibodies and could be used as a therapeutic agent.",
