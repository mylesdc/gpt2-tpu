Worldwide, the rate of new HIV infections continues to increase. Although new acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) diagnoses and deaths have fallen significantly in developed countries since the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), in the developing world the HIV/AIDS epidemic continues to accelerate. The global impact of the epidemic is staggering. According to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS and the World Health Organization, as of the end of 2002, 40-42 million people were estimated to be living with HIV/AIDS, with 95% of the global total residing in the developing world [2, 3] . Worldwide there will be an estimated 2.5-3.5 million deaths due to HIV/AIDS in 2003 [2] and there have been as many as 30 million deaths as a result of HIV infection since the beginning of the epidemic [3] . Beyond the human tragedy of HIV/AIDS, the costs of the epidemic pose a significant impediment to the economic growth and political stability of many countries. In developing countries and in segments of the U.S. population, anti-HIV therapies are frequently beyond financial reach. Accordingly, effective, low-cost tools for HIV prevention, such as a vaccine, are urgently needed to bring the HIV epidemic under control. For this reason, the Vaccine Research Center (VRC) and Division of AIDS (DAIDS) at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) are committed to the development of safe, effective vaccines to prevent HIV infection and AIDS worldwide.",

The World Health Organization UNAIDS HIV Vaccine Advisory Committee has recommended that candidate HIV vaccines be designed based upon the strains prevalent in the country in which trials are to be conducted [4] . The Vaccine Research Center, NIAID, NIH and the World Health Organization-Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS organized a meeting focused on the genetic diversity of HIV and strategies to develop vaccine candidates. A consensus was reached that generation of multiclade candidate vaccines is a high international scientific priority [5] . This approach is the foundation for the multiclade design of the prime-boost vaccination regimen development strategy. The DNA vaccine,VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP, as well as the adenoviral vector vaccine, VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP encode gag and pol gene sequences from clade B as well as more diverse env genes from clades A, B and C. The DNA vaccine also encodes a clade B nef gene sequence. Clades A, B and C together represent the viral subtypes responsible for about 90% of new HIV infections in the world [6] .",

            "text": "The rationale in development of VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP was to separate the gag, pol and nef genes into separate plasmids, rather than having one plasmid that produces a fusion protein immunogen, as was the case with the 4-plasmid vaccine, VRC-HIVDNA009-00-VP. Small changes to the plasmids are expected to enhance the immunogenicity of the protein products produced in vivo. In addition to splitting the genes into separate plasmids there are two other changes in the plasmid construction. These are: 1) a change in the promoter incorporated into these plasmids and 2) a 68 amino acid addition to the gag gene in the VRC 4401 (Gag protein only) plasmid as compared to the VRC 4306 (Gag-Pol-Nef fusion protein) plasmid that was in VRC-HIVDNA009-00-VP. Preclinical data with VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP indicate that the separate gag, pol and nef plasmids generate more consistent and stronger immune responses to the Gag, Pol and Nef immunogens that are produced. The clades A, B and C Env plasmids in VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP are identical to the three Env plasmids in VRC-HIVDNA009-00-VP except that the promoter known as CMV/R has been used rather than the CMV promoter. The The VRC, NIAID, NIH in collaboration with DAIDS, NIAID, NIH has previously sponsored clinical trials with two different multiclade HIV-1 DNA vaccines. These are a multiclade 4plasmid DNA vaccine (VRC-HIVDNA009-00-VP) and the multiclade 6-plasmid DNA vaccine (VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP) that will be used in this study.

Definitive responses are first detectable with the 4 mg and 8 mg dose at the 6week time point (2 weeks after the second injection). When compared with the 8 mg dose, the 4 mg dose offers the combination of a good safety profile, greater ease of administration, and approximately equivalent cellular immunogenicity.

This open-label study enrolled 15 subjects between August 17, 2004 and October 28, 2004 . Fourteen of the 15 subjects received 3 intramuscular injections of a 4 mg dose of vaccine administered by Biojector; one subject was lost to follow-up after two vaccinations. The last study vaccination was administered on December 22, 2004 . This summary represents interim results through May 4, 2005 . No subjects reported fever following vaccination. Reactogenicity was none to mild except that two subjects reported moderate injection site pain and one subject reported moderate nausea and malaise. The only adverse event requiring expedited reporting to the IND sponsor was a grade 3 generalized urticaria. The subject had reported starting an antihistamine about 2 weeks after first vaccination but reported at that time that the reason was latex allergy. While being screened for the rollover booster study, VRC 010, it was learned that the subject had experienced generalized urticaria around the time of the second vaccination when the supply of antihistamine ran out. As of May 2005 the subject has chronic urticaria that are well controlled by antihistamine. Evaluation is ongoing. The etiology is unknown but at this time the chronic urticaria are assessed as possibly related to study vaccine. To date, there have been two moderate (grade 2) adverse events possibly attributed to vaccine. These were intermittent dizziness of 2 days duration beginning 13 days after the second vaccination in one subject (this subject received the third vaccination without recurrence of symptoms) and asymptomatic hypoglycemia in another subject, first noted at the follow-up visit that was 14 days after the third vaccination.

The HIV vaccine, VRC-HIVDNA009-00-VP, is now being evaluated in extramural trials. To date the DNA vaccines have been administered by a needleless delivery device (Biojector 2000), which is manufactured by Bioject Corporation (Portland, OR). The needleless design of the Biojector offers a safety advantage in eliminating the potential for accidental needle sticks and illicit reuse of disposable needles and syringes. The Biojector has the disadvantage of being more expensive to use than standard needle and syringe and requiring special training to use properly. A preclinical study in non-human primates (described in Section 2.4) indicates that the immunogenicity and systemic safety of VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP are similar whether administered by either needle and syringe or by Biojector. The published literature, reviewed below, suggests that the Biojector is associated with more injection site reactogenicity than a standard needle and syringe for intramuscular injections. In the VRC's experience with the Biojector, occasional small 1-2 mm cutaneous lacerations, sometimes associated with subsequent ecchymoses, have been noted that are not seen with needle and syringe injections. In the context of future international Phase II and Phase III studies it is important to evaluate whether the DNA injections should be administered by needle and syringe. If equivalent from an immunological standpoint, this method of administration may reduce cost and ensure consistent intramuscular administration at numerous clinical sites. Recently there was the unexpected observation of mild skin lesions following 9% of the DNA vaccine injections in VRC 007 (04-I-0254). For planning future studies, it may also be helpful to obtain preliminary information through VRC 008 about whether any skin lesions are observed following IM injection of VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP by needle and syringe.",

However, in developing countries there are community risk concerns associated with conventional needle and syringe use. Improper injection practices, an acknowledged problem in developing countries, can result in the use of nonsterile needles or syringes with transmission of blood-borne pathogens across a patient population. In a 1999 literature review, it was reported that more than 50% of all injections administered in 14 of 19 developing countries were unsafe [12] . In all clinical settings, there is a risk of needle stick injuries for health care workers and the burden of proper needle disposal. However, the risk of a needle and syringe as an injection device for an individual Needle-free injection systems have been used as an alternative to needle and syringe injections of vaccines. Needle-free devices eject pressurized fluid through a small orifice in the nozzle, resulting in percutaneous delivery of the liquid vaccine with intramuscular, subcutaneous, or intradermal deposition [13] . Foremost among the advantages of pressurized injection systems as a method of vaccine administration is the inherent increase in safety afforded by a needle-free device, both to vaccinees (by ensuring that a nonsterile device is not used) and to healthcare workers (by eliminating needle-stick injuries). Some needle-free injection systems have been a valuable public health instrument in developing countries for mass vaccination campaigns, and may be important globally in the event of a bioterrorist attack [13] .",

Six weeks after IM injection by either method, the vast majority of the DNA plasmid was in the muscle (hamstrings) and skin near the injection site, with skin showing higher copy counts than muscle. Low levels of DNA plasmids were also detectable in draining lymph nodes. In the early timepoints (1-7 days) low systemic exposure could also be detected. Biojector delivery, as compared to needle injection, increased the uptake of DNA plasmids in both muscle and the skin near the injection site, as well being associated with slightly more dispersion to distal sites. Neither method was associated with integration of DNA plasmid into host cellular DNA [18] .",

The vaccine was safe and well tolerated when delivered by needle and syringe. A majority of subjects developed antigen-specific CTL responses with more responses in the higher dose groups, but none of the subjects had detectable antibodies to the PfCSP. On the basis of preclinical evaluation of safety and immunogenicity when different injection devices were used for administration, different injection devices were evaluated in a subsequent human clinical trial (N=21). The three injection methods were: needle IM, Biojector IM, and Biojector with 70% of the dose administered IM and 30% administered intradermally (ID). Each of the three groups included 5 vaccinees (2.5 mg dose) and 2 control subjects. The schedule included injections of 1 mL total volume at weeks 0, 4 and 8. The IM/ID administration plan required 4 injections at each time point. Adverse events were generally mild and limited to the injection site with Biojector injections associated with about twice as many adverse events per injection. However, study subjects preferred the Biojector injections [16] . Regardless of the method of administration, anti-PfCSPspecific antibodies could not be detected in the human clinical trial samples, although antigenspecific immune responses as assessed by IFN-\u03b3 enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) were detected in all vaccinees [16, 21] . Experience with this DNA vaccine indicates that intramuscular injection by needle and syringe does not result in different systemic safety concerns when a needleless injection device is used to deliver it intramuscularly.",

The adenoviral vector in this study is a replication defective adenovirus of serotype 5. Over fifty distinct human adenovirus serotypes have been defined worldwide based on type specific neutralizing antibody assays. These cause a variety of common infections including respiratory infections [23] . Seroepidemiological surveys to assess adenovirus in various U.S. and European populations suggest that adenovirus serotype (Ad)1, Ad2, and Ad5 are most common and present in over half of children tested [22, 24, 25] . Adenovirus serotype 5 antibody was detected by ELISA in one study of young adults (median age of 27), 55% of which had neutralizing titers in excess of 1:20 [26] . Data on other non-U.S. populations have suggested that similar or higher rates of seroprevalence will be found in populations targeted for vaccination especially in the developing world [27] .",

Preexisting anti-Ad5 neutralizing antibody was also noted to \"dampen\" the immunogenicity of the Ad5 vector vaccine but this could be overcome at higher dose levels.

The ICS assay is based upon previously published methods [33] and quantitates the frequency of CD4 + and CD8 + cells that produce interleukin-2 or interferon-gamma, in response to pools of overlapping peptides representing HIV antigens (Gag, Pol, Nef or Env) from specific HIV clades. These cladespecific peptides will also be used to detect T-cell responsiveness by an ELISPOT assay modified from a previously published method [34] . Antibody responses to HIV-specific antibodies will be evaluated using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [35] . The ability of the vaccine to elicit neutralizing antibody against HIV-1 strains from clades A, B, and C will be evaluated by a flow cytometric assay that measures the capacity of sera to block single round infection of individual PBMC [36] . The pre-existing and post-vaccination presence of adenovirus serotype 5 neutralizing antibody in study volunteers will be evaluated from frozen serum samples using a previously published luciferase transgene detection method [32] . Other assays may also be completed from stored samples at a later date if further elucidation of immunogenicity is of interest. The drug substances for VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP are six closed circular plasmid DNA macromolecules, VRC 4401, VRC 4409, VRC 4404, VRC 5736, VRC 5737 and VRC 5738 combined in equal concentrations (mg/mL). VRC 4401 encodes for the clade B HIV-1 Gag structural core protein that encapsidates the viral RNA and exhibits highly conserved domains. VRC 4409 encodes for clade B polymerase (Pol), which is also highly conserved, and VRC 4404 encodes for clade B Nef, an accessory protein against which a vigorous T-cell response is mounted in natural infection. The DNA plasmid expressing HIV-1 Pol has been modified to reduce potential toxicity through the incorporation of changes in the regions affecting the protease, reverse transcriptase, and integrase activities. Two amino acids in the myristoylation site in the HIV-1 nef gene were deleted to abrogate MHC class I and CD4+ down-regulation by the Nef protein [37, 38] . No modifications were made to the amino acid sequence of Gag. The other three plasmids express synthetic versions of modified, truncated envelope glycoproteins (gp145) from three strains of HIV-1: VRC 5736 (clade A), VRC 5737 (clade B) and VRC 5738 (clade C). The sequences used to create the DNA plasmids encoding Env are derived from three HIV-1 CCR5-tropic strains of virus. These genes have been modified to improve immunogenicity, which has been demonstrated in mice [39] and monkeys. The vaccine will potentially elicit immune responses to a broad range of HIV-1 strains.",

The results of this study showed that vaccine delivered by needle and syringe elicited similar immunological responses to those delivered by the Biojector 2000. Needle and syringe and Biojector injections appeared to be similarly well tolerated by the study animals as indicated by veterinary observation and complete blood count data. Cynomolgus macaques receiving DNA prime/rAd boost immunizations elicited potent and broad cellular immune responses simultaneously to all viral antigens. In addition, they elicited potent antibody responses to these envelope antigens and Gag antigen as measured by ELISA. Monkeys that received the DNA plasmid vaccine prime and rAd boost generated responses to clades A, B and C Env peptide pools in all six animals following the DNA prime immunizations, as well as following the rAd boost.",

The adenovirus serology used for randomization, as well as the fasting glucose, cholesterol and LDL, used in the eligibility screening must be from within the 12 weeks (84 days) prior to enrollment. Any test that has a specific eligibility requirement must be done within the window needed to meet study eligibility. Risk status for HIV infection will be determined by a series of questions designed to identify risk factors. Storage samples of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and serum will also be collected. General eligibility for clinical trials will be dependent on results of laboratory tests and answers to the interview questions. Informed consent documents for vaccine trials will be reviewed, and counseling relating to the potential risks of becoming pregnant during this trial and avoiding HIV infection will be provided.

This returned to normal without any symptoms of illness. A different subject was noted to have persistent grade 1 ALT starting 25 days after study injection that lasted for about 5 months. An evaluation diagnosed fatty liver (steatohepatitis). There are no clinical symptoms. The condition may have existed prior to study enrollment and the subject's alcohol use and recent weight gain may be contributing factors. One subject with a history of a single seizure three years prior to study enrollment, experienced a seizure 64 days after study injection. This subject now has a diagnosis of epilepsy and is on anticonvulsant therapy. Following review of the subject's medical records and given the timing of the seizure, the seizure was assessed as unrelated to study vaccine. Other subjects have had mild temporary changes in blood or urine tests. It is unknown whether the lab test changes, diarrhea, fatty liver, or seizure were due to vaccine or to other factors or to a combination of the In preclinical testing in rabbits, this investigational vaccine was associated with fever the day after injection and decreased food consumption 1-2 days after injection. After a second injection, inflammation in the muscle around the injection site was noted, including tissue around capillaries and lymphatics near the sciatic nerve; however no nerve damage was noted. Transient and asymptomatic changes in cholesterol and triglycerides were not associated with clinical pathology and transient increase in creatine phosphokinase (CPK) was possibly related to the muscle inflammation.",

However, it will be possible, by using tests for the presence of HIV virus (called PCR or viral load testing), to show when a positive result on the HIV antibody test is NOT because of an HIV infection. A positive antibody test in a person who is not HIV infected is called a \"false positive\" test.

Antibodies resulting from a vaccine do not always continue to be present long term.

You will also be asked about any social effects you may have experienced from your participation in this study.The vaccines used in this study cannot cause HIV infection. If you become infected with HIV during this study for other reasons, you will not receive any additional study injections. You will be referred for medical care. Medical treatment for HIV infection is not part of this study. You will be asked to continue with study follow-up visits through the full 42 weeks of study.If you have either serious side effects from the vaccine or learn of any new health problems while on the study, the study doctor may decide that you should not receive any more vaccinations. However, you will be asked to continue your study follow-up visits.The clinic visit schedule for 42 weeks is shown below. You must also call the clinic one or two days after rAd vaccination or any time you have a health problem. ",

            "text": "As part of your participation in this study, it will be necessary to test your blood for the presence of antibodies to the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), the virus that causes Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). If antibodies are present, other tests will be done to determine if you have HIV infection. In order to perform the test, a small amount of blood (approximately 2 teaspoons) will be withdrawn from one of your arms with a needle. You may experience some slight discomfort at the needle entry site and there may be some bruising. In addition, there is a very small risk of you fainting or of infection at the needle entry site. If you are diagnosed as having HIV infection, you should be aware of the following Clinical Center HIV Testing Policy:1. Your physician will notify you promptly of the HIV test results.2. Your physician and/or the Clinical Center HIV counselor will offer you, and any current and/or ongoing sexual partner(s) (spouses are generally considered to be current or ongoing sexual partners) or needle-sharing partner(s) you identify, information on the meaning of the test results and how to prevent the spread of the infection.3. Because the virus may be transmitted in several ways, it is important that you inform sexual and/or needle-sharing partner(s) that any, or all, of them may have been exposed to the HIV virus and encourage them to be tested. If you request it, staff at the Clinical Center will assist you in notifying your partner(s) and arrange counseling for them through an HIV counselor.4. The results of your HIV test and/or documentation of the diagnosis of AIDS will become a part of your Clinical Center medical record and, as such, will be protected from unauthorized disclosure by the Federal Privacy Act of 1974. In general, access to your medical record will be restricted to those health care professionals directly involved in your care or in the conduct of ongoing biomedical research, and information is not usually released to other third parties without your permission or that of your designated representative. However, there are some particular routine uses of such information of which you should be aware.(a) If you are unwilling or unable to notify your partner(s), the Clinical Center is responsible for attempting to contact and inform them of their possible exposure to the virus. Reasonable attempts will be made to protect your identity including withholding your name when notifying any partner(s) of their possible exposure. Some notification or counseling of current and/or ongoing partners may be carried out through arrangements with, or referral to, local public health agencies. If you have any questions regarding the HIV testing or the information provided above, you are encouraged to discuss them with your physician or you may call a Clinical Center HIV counselor at 301-496-2381.",

Some genetic tests can help researchers study how health or illness is passed on to you by your parents or from you to your children. In vaccine research some genetic tests are done to see if different types of immune response to a vaccine seem to be related to genetic differences in people. Some of the genetic tests will be done in a research lab from your stored samples. Genetic tests done in a research lab will not be in your medical record. Tests that are done in a research lab will not have your name on the sample given to the research lab. In the future, genetic research tests to help understand how vaccines work may be done on your DNA using stored samples.Some genetic tests are done in a regular medical laboratory.

HLA type is usually used to match bone marrow or organ transplants. For research, HLA testing is sometimes used to try to identify factors associated with response to a vaccine, progression of a disease or related conditions. Determining HLA type is necessary to be able to perform certain research studies. Some HLA types have been associated with an increased risk of certain diseases like arthritis and other rheumatologic problems. Simply having those HLA types, however, doesn't mean you will develop these diseases. Genetic testing can also be used to determine if people are directly related.
