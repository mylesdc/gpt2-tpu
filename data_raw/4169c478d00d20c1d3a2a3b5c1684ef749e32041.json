The results of this validation are summarised in Table 2 . Briefly, all 10 WHO Neisseria gonorrhoeae reference strains; 153 isolates of 14 non-N. gonorrhoeae Neisseria species and three Moraxella species; 10 Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) samples, including the two TV ATCC strains 30001 and 50140; five reference strains of four non-TV Trichomonas species; nine C. trachomatis strains of different genotypes and the Swedish new variant of C. trachomatis (SE-nvCT); four non-C. trachomatis Chlamydia species; 428 clinical C. trachomatis wild type positive AC2 specimens; 23 clinical specimens positive for N. gonorrhoeae, T. vaginalis, bacterial vaginosis and Candida species; and 443 clinical AC2-negative specimens, were negative in the FI-nvCT assay. However, all 69 FI-nvCT positive clinical AC2 specimens (verified by 23S rRNA gene sequencing) were positive in the new Aptima-format FI-nvCT surveillance assay ( Table 2 ).",
