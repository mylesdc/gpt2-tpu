As a viral pathogen in cattle, BHV-1 causes severe respiratory infection, conjunctivitis, abortion, vulvovaginitis, balanopostitis, and systemic infection in neonate calves [1] . Most of these problems are caused by increased susceptibility to secondary infection which correlates with BHV-1-induced immunosuppression [2, 3] . This immunosuppression may be partly due to apoptosis of infected lymphocytes because reduction of CD4 + T lymphocytes was detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and lymph nodes during acute infection of BHV-1 and those CD4 + T lymphocytes undergo apoptosis [4] .",

This process is characterized by detachment, plasma membrane blebbing, nuclear collapse and chromatin condensation. An important regulatory event in the apoptotic process is the activation of caspases, a family of cysteine proteases. Caspase cascades are involved in both intrinsic and extrinsic signal pathways which regulate the apoptotic process [5] . The relationship between virus infection and apoptosis is bidirectional. On one hand, virus infected cells can be eliminated by apoptosis mediated by components in the innate and adaptive immune systems. On the other hand, viruses have evolved strategies to regulate apoptosis, either by blocking a specific step of apoptotic cascade within the host cells, and thus maximizing virus production, or by actively inducing apoptosis, which consequently facilitates the spreading of virus progeny [6] .",

Moreover, although penetration of BHV-1 is not required, attachment of BHV-1 viral particles is essential for the induction of apoptosis [8] . Also, it has been proved that the apoptosis induced by BHV-1 infection in MDBK cells involves p53-dependent mechanism [9] . To better understand the apoptotic process initiated by BHV-1 infection, in this work we further characterize caspases activation cascades during BHV-1 induced apoptosis in MDBK cells, focusing on the cell surface death receptor pathway and the mitochondria-initiated pathway. Our results demonstrate that BHV-1 infection appears to activate caspase-8 by Fas-dependent mechanism and to turn on caspase-9 by the mitochondriadependent pathway. In addition, the two pathways could be associated through Bid.",

Infection of MDBK cells with BHV-1 resulted in cell death in a time-dependent manner, as detected by MTT assay. The loss of viability was also dependent on the MOI at which the cultures were infected ( Figure 1A ). Infection with amounts as low as 0.0032 MOI of BHV-1 had almost no impact on cell viability, however, with 50 MOI of BHV-1 only about 20% of the cells were alive at 48 h p.i.. The reduction in cell viability at 2 MOI appeared about 24 h p.i., which became more evident at 36 and 48 h p.i. compared with mock-infected cells.

Increased rates of apoptotic cells were detected in BHV-1-infected MDBK cells. The percentage of apoptotic cells increased from 4.1% at 24 h p.i. to 70.5% at 60 h p.i. ( Figure 1E ).

Bid activation results in the destruction of mitochondria integrity and cytochrome c release to cytosol, which further facilitates caspase-9 activation. To test this possibility in BHV-1-induced apoptosis, we determined whether Bid was cleaved upon BHV-1 infection and whether blocking caspase-8 activity could affect Bid cleavage and caspase-9 activation. Western blot analysis revealed that tBid was detected in BHV-1-infected cells but not in mock-infected cells. tBid clearly appeared at 24 h p.i. and maintained a high level in subsequent hours ( Figure 3B ). Following incubation with z-IETD-FMK, a specific inhibitor of caspase-8, tBid was not detected in BHV-1-infected cells ( Figure 3C ). However, the activation of caspase-9 was partly blocked in BHV-1infected cells ( Figure 3D ). These results suggest that apoptosis signals from the FasL were transmitted to caspase-8 which in turn cleaves Bid and is followed by caspase-9 activation, and that other apoptosis signals also contribute to the activation of caspase-9.",

Cytochrome c released from mitochondria to cytoplasm induces subsequent activation of caspase-9. This process is tightly controlled by members of Bcl-2 family. Pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins such as Bax or Bak activated upon apoptosis signals results in outer mitochondrial membrane permeabilization. In contrast, antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins such as Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL can prevent this occurrence [13] . The activation of caspase-9 suggests that BHV-1 infection might disturb the homeostasis of the mitochondria. In our experiment, the levels of Bax and Bcl-2 were detected by western blot analysis and qRT-PCR in BHV-1 infected MDBK cells. Protein levels of Bax exhibited an apparent increase in dose-and time-dependent manner ( Figure 4A ). Compared with mock infected cells, the mRNA levels of Bax in BHV-1infected cells were up-regulated as early as 24 h p.i. and reached a peak level at 60 h p.i. ( Figure 4B ). Conversely, the protein levels of Bcl-2 were down-regulated in a time-and dose-dependent manner in BHV-1 infected cells ( Figure 4A ). Also, the mRNA levels of Bcl-2 significantly decreased in BHV-1-infected cells at 60 h p.i., ( Figure 4C ). Next, we observe that cytochrome c released from the mitochondria to cytosol in BHV-1 infected cells was not readily detected in the cytosol fraction of mock-infected cells ( Figure 4D ). We assume that apoptotic protease-activating factor-1 (Apaf-1), as a central component of apoptosome complex, might be involved in the activation of caspase-9. The results show that Apaf-1 was up-regulated in dose-and timedependent manner ( Figure 4E ). Taken together, these results suggest that Bax and Bcl-2 might play roles in regulating the integrity of mitochondria and promoting the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria in BHV-1-infected cells.",

To test which caspase takes the main role in increasing virus replication, virus progenies released in the presence or absence of the caspase inhibitors were determined by measuring the virus TCID 50 . Figure 5A shows that caspase-3 inhibitor could increase the virus replication dramatically but the caspase-8 caspase-9 inhibitor did not show dramatic effects. Down-stream caspases activation has negative impact on virus life cycle. To determine whether the entry of virion into the cells was necessary for the induction of apoptosis, we used NH 4 Cl to inhibit endosomal acidification, thus impeding the release of virion to the cytoplasm. MDBK cells were pretreated with NH 4 Cl at indicated concentrations for 2 h before infection and then infected with 2 MOI BHV-1 for 48 h. Cells infected in the same conditions without NH 4 Cl were used as positive controls. We observed that NH 4 Cl treatment decreased viral titer and attenuated BHV-1-induced apoptosis ( Figure 5B, C) . This result suggests that BHV-1-induced apoptosis requires the viral particles to entry MDBK cells.",

Our research provided evidence that BHV-1 induces apoptosis in MDBK cells, involving caspase-8-dependent pathways. This suggests that an extrinsic pathway was involved in the BHV-1-induced apoptosis. The increasing expression of Fas and FasL indicates that caspase-8 activation in BHV-1-infected MDBK cells can be mediated by Fas/FasL signal payhway. However, just how Fas expression is regulated by BHV-1 remains unclear, and further studies are under way to elucidate the mechanism of Fas regulation in BHV-1-infected MDBK cells. Caspase-8 has been shown to activate a mitochondria pathway following the cleavage of Bid, a pro-apoptotic member of Bcl-2 family [22, 23] . Cleavage of Bid in BHV-1-infected cells was consistent with such a mechanism. We also propose that the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and increasing expression of Apaf-1 are critical steps in the BHV-1-initiated apoptosis. These results are consistent with current theory that tBid transfers to the surface of the mitochondria causing cytochrome c release [19] . Thereafter, cytochrome c helps Apaf-1 to recruit and activate caspase-9 preprotein, which in turn activates caspase-3 [24] . Our research provides evidence that BHV-1 infection induced apoptosis occurs through a mitochondria pathway. There are also some other types of virus which induce apoptosis through mitochondria pathway, such as the equine arteritis virus [19] and the dengue virus [25] . Suppressing the activation of caspase-8 and caspase-9 separately degrades the activation of caspase-3 but did not stop it totally, indicating that both the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways contribute to activation of caspase-3 and cleavage of PARP progressively.",

In some cases, some viruses either encode proteins homologous to Bcl-2 to inhibit apoptosis or influence Bcl-2 expression to establish a persistent infection. Many viruses inducing apoptosis by modulating expression of Bcl-2 family proteins have been reported [27] . Our results show that the BHV-1 infection up-regulated Bax, down-regulated Bcl-2 expression, and induced the release of cytochrome c, resulting in MDBK cells apoptosis. These results are consistent with the observation in other herpes viruses [28, 29] , which suggest that modulation of Bcl-2 members is a key step for herpes viruses induction of CPE and eventually apoptosis.",

In this pathway, activated caspase-8 cleaves Bid to tBid which, in turn, translocates to mitochondria and initiates the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol activating caspase-9. Our results also provide evidences for the potential cross-talk between extrinsic and intrinsic pathways in BHV-1-induced apoptosis. Blocking caspase-8 activity using z-IETD-FMK, a specific inhibitor of caspase-8, does not completely abrogate caspase-9 activation. This suggests that caspase-9 is activated not only by caspase-8 activation but also by other upstream apoptotic signals. In previous study, P53 appeared to be involved in the BHV-1-induced apoptosis in MDBK cells because the p53 level and promoter activity increased after infection [9] .",

            "text": "For some types of viruses, viral replication is required for the induction of apoptosis during infection with these viruses. BHV-1 needs to penetrate MDBK cells in order to trigger cell death, but not to induce host cell intrinsic-recognition mechanism [8] . Pan caspase inhibiter can prevent BHV-1-induced apoptosis and enhance the virus yield [9] , in which down-stream caspase (caspase-3) leads a main role. In the meantime, caspase inhibitors increase cells' viability, and the effect of caspase-3 inhibitor is more significant. We hypothesize that it was because caspase inhibitors prolonged the survival of MDBK cells that more virus was assembled in cells. In other words, apoptosis has a negative impact on the virus life cycle. However, the inhibition of caspases does not affect Canine Coronavirus Type II (CCoV-II) replication in canine fibro sarcoma cells (A-72 cells) [31] . Treatment of MDBK cells with NH 4 Cl or infection with UV-inactivated BHV-1 was seen to abrogate virus apoptosis induction, suggesting that BHV-1-induced apoptosis in MDBK cells depends on viral replication. Although apoptosis occurred in MDBK cells after BHV-1 infection, UV-inactivated virus did not efficiently induce apoptosis. This finding is in contrast to those from previous studied using PBMC or activated CD4 + T cells. In general, lymphoid cells are prone to apoptosis, suggesting that inactivated virus can induce apoptosis in cells which easily undergo apoptosis. It is clear that BHV-1 induces cell death in a cell-type-dependent fashion, and this is probably because novel virus-host interactions are important for BHV-1-initiated apoptosis in different cell types. For example, a novel member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) NGF receptor family (HVEM) [32] mediates HSV-1 entry into activated T cells. Conversely, entry of HSV-1 into epithelial or other non-lymphoid cells is mediated by an unrelated membrane glycoprotein which resembles the poliovirus receptor [33] .",
