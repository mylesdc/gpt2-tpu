The virus itself is an avian pathogen from the family Coronaviridae. IBV has been detected worldwide wherever poultry is reared, and in fact, the virus is highly potential to spread rapidly among non-protected poultries [2] . In infected chickens, IBV primarily affects the upper respiratory tract. As a matter of facts, high mortality in chickens is usually associated with nephritis. In the laying phase, reproductive tract of layer and breeder poultry is potential to get negatively affected, causing decreases in egg quality and production volumes [3] .",

            "text": "As aforementioned, IBV belongs to family Coronaviridae, by which IBV is known as a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus and has similar genome organizations as other Coronavirus. The length of IBV genome is about 27.6 kb, by which it represents codes for four major structural proteins: The spike (S) glycoprotein, small enveloped (E) protein, membrane (M) glycoprotein, and nucleocapsid (N) [4, 5] . Genetically, the gene order of IBV is 5'-replicase-S-E-M-N-UTR-3', wherein the UTR covers untranslated regions. Furthermore, replicase is a viral enzyme that is used during genome replication, while the following regions (S-E-M-N) are membrane-bound structural proteins (S, E, and M proteins) and an accessory protein (nucleoprotein) [6] . In general, the S glycoprotein of any Coronavirus, including Available at www.veterinaryworld.org/Vol.12/February-2019/15.pdf IBV, is recognized as having a virion surface, a rodshaped protein that is post-translationally cleaved into two subunits, S1 and S2 [7] . Besides, it contains four domains that are involved in anchoring the protein into the lipid bilayer of a host cell. In detail, the S glycoprotein consists of 1162 amino acid which was sliced into two subunits, including N-terminal S1 subunit (535 amino acids) and C-terminal S2 subunit (627 amino acids) [8] . According to Cavanagh [9] , S glycoprotein has the most varied structure among other proteins in IBV gene. In particular, three hypervariable regions (HVRs), in which base pairs of nucleotides repeat, exist in the first 395-amino acid region of the S1 subunit. Hence, the S1 domain has the most variable regions and carries most of the virus neutralizing epitopes. Besides, it is primarily responsible for an attachment process to the receptor on host cells [10] . Changes in a few amino acids within the S1 protein would result in a change of serotype. Variation in the S1 protein is, hence, used as the basis for genotype and serotype classification [11] [12] [13] . On the other hand, the S2 domain is relatively conserved, mediating the fusion of virus and cell membrane during an entry stage [6, 14, 15] . In terms of its functions, therefore, the existence of S glycoprotein is imperative during virus attachment, fusion activation, and the release of viral genome into a cell. In short, S protein of Coronavirus is a critical determinant of its pathogenicity and host range.",

Besides, factors that influence clinical manifestations are age, pathogenicity of the virus strain, and immunity [16] . Based on tissue tropism, there are two major IBV pathotypes: Respiratory and nephropathogenic. Most of classic IBV cases, including the Massachusetts (Mass) serotype, infects respiratory tract. On the other hand, nephropathogenic strains, which occur mostly in Asian and Middle Eastern countries, infect and damage kidneys that may later result in a significant mortality rate [1, 17] . Furthermore, the pathogenicity of IBV strains varies greatly on oviduct, in which various strains are able to replicate in oviduct epithelial cells. In particular, the QX strain is one of the nephropathogenic strains with clinical symptoms of diarrhea, proventriculitis, and losses of body weight in chickens aged 25-70 days [18] . First isolated in China, QX variant is now predominant in Asia and Europe and has since been showing altered tissue tropism. It is currently associated with respiratory problems, nephritis, cystic oviduct, drops in egg production, and \"false layers\" syndrome [1, 17, [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] .",

In fact, some serotypes, including QX-like IBV, Mass strain from the United States, 4/91 (CR88) from the United Kingdom, and H120 strains from the Netherlands, are recognized as variants causing local and regional impacts with high potentials to spread far and wide to other countries [3] . In Indonesia, IBV was first reported in 1977 [26] , by which multiple IBV isolates have been studied since then. IBV isolates gathered in Indonesia included I-37 and I-269, both of which were isolated by Darminto [27] , while isolate I-14 was isolated by Indriani and Darminto [28] . According to Dharmayanti et al. [29] , isolate I-37 was classified into Connecticut (Conn) serotype. In general, IBV isolates from Indonesia are characterized as variants similar to globally distributed vaccine strains, including Australia-origin N2/62 and US-origin Conn 46 as well as Mass 41 [30, 31] .",

            "text": "Practically, vaccination is the most common method to prevent IBV infections. To do so, controlling IBV in commercial poultry farms is typically conducted by the application of live attenuated vaccines (LAV) and killed/inactivated vaccines. In Indonesia, IB vaccination commonly applies vaccines fitted to serotypes M41, H120, or Conn. Besides, several vaccine manufacturers use local IB virus gathered in the country [30] . However, IB disease continues to act as an active threat to poultry despite progressive vaccination programs. It is particularly caused by the continuous emergence of new IBV variants from time to time. In the period 2012-2018, a pilot study of this work has gathered samples from layer chicken farms/ flocks in Central Java and Yogyakarta (Indonesia) experiencing signs of IBV infection such as respiratory problems, drops in production, \"penguin-like\" stance, cystic oviduct, and nephritis at necropsy. In recent years, there is a growing tendency in some of the country's layer farms to report signs of QX-like infections; however, there is no scientific report that clearly proves and confirms the genotype of the agent based on molecular analysis. Those many reports by poultry farmers on clinical manifestations in various IB cases that theoretically refer to QX-like infection, therefore, require a proper scientific proof at molecular level on the genotype of virus isolates found on the fields. To address the problem, this study aims to perform a phylogenetic analysis of S1 gene to reveal the genotype classification of the field isolates. Besides, Dharmayanti et al. [29] have stated the importance of identifying prevalent serotype(s) isolated in a region to investigate the cross-protective potentials using currently available vaccines. In particular, this study attempts to focus on pathogenic 4/91-like and QX-like IBV infections, pioneering a field-based scientific analysis on these two strains that are actively circulating in Indonesian poultry industry.",

Meeusen et al.

The virus strain is a nephropathogenic IB virus that has higher pathogenicity on the kidney compared to other organs. Besides, Amjad et al.

Samples, at which strains grouped in the cluster are found, were collected from three different flocks in Central Java and Yogyakarta. Their collection periods apparently differ (2012 and 2017), and hence, it suggests that these QX-like strains have been circulating since 2012 within these regions. Basically, QX reference strain has been described as nephropathogenic although it is initially linked with proventriculitis [18, 19] . Apparently, QX-like isolates in Indonesia have amino acid variations compared to the reference QX vaccine strains. It indicates that isolates in the country observed by this study are considered as pathogenic strains that have been circulating on the fields. However, sequence alignment shows that isolates from 2012 (MHW-QX-MGX-1-2012 and MHW-QX-KDL-3-2012) have four amino acid differences compared to those of QX-like isolate from 2017 (MHW-Rhb-5-2017).

Primarily, Crinion and Hofstad [52] have suggested \"false layer\" syndrome to possibly occur in chickens infected by certain IBV strains in their early ages. Meanwhile, its infections in layer chickens have been causing various indications, including pigmented eggshell and drops in egg production [53] . In particular, only a few IBV strains have been reported to cause \"false layer\" syndrome [24, 54] . The syndrome is induced through infections in young chickens by various strains of IB virus, including Mass, Australian T, and several QX strains [24, 53] . Meanwhile, the current literature has never formally reported 4/91 strains as a causing agent of \"false layer\" syndrome.

Molecular analyses in this study have discovered IBV-infected samples of layer chickens in Indonesia to be included in 4/91 or QX clusters. In other words, currently applied vaccines based on Mass strain are indeed protective as no sample is discovered to be IBV infected by Mass strain. However, this type of vaccine is clearly inadequate to give protection against 4/91 and QX strains. Mass serotype is the most widely used strain for vaccination protocols all over the world. Gaba et al. [55] , in fact, have stated the excessive use of Mass strain in various IBV cases as a critical cause of very poor cross-protection against 4/91 IBV strains. Hence, it significantly increases potential failures of IBV vaccination programs. In the work of Parson et al. [56] , IBV vaccines based on Mass strain have also been proven as being inefficient in delivering protections against 4/91 IBV strain. Virus IB itself has been acknowledged for its high mutation, by which a minor change in S1 sequence would swiftly cause poor cross-protection and vaccine failure. Cavanagh [57] has reported that as low as 5% differences in S1 sequence would produce a poor cross-protection, which would surely increase the potential of IBV infections despite active vaccination protocols applied in commercial poultry farms. Basically, vaccine(s) based on a certain serotype or genotype would be able to protect well-vaccinated chickens against a homologous challenge [58] . Homologous vaccine strain is, hence, stated as having the best delivery of protection against a certain infection; however, partial protection is possible to achieve through an appropriate and careful combination of heterologous vaccines [59] . It has been widely recognized that a vaccination protocol that applies two antigenically distinct LAV, for example, Mass and 4/91, can result in a broad cross-protection against many different IBV types [19, 60, 61] . Therefore, a new vaccination program that delivers cross-protection against multiple IBV strains is clinically required. Results of this study also indicate all IBV isolates under investigation as new pathogenic 4/91 and QX strains circulating on the fields. There are, however, limitations of the current work, including a limited length of S1 gene being observed (383 bp) which cannot reflect the whole molecular characteristics of the virus. Completing the genotyping and serotype analysis of IBV infecting those isolates will, hence, be delivering more comprehensive data of this new pathogenic IBV circulating in Indonesia.",

            "text": "This study has successfully conducted a molecular analysis on disease-causing virus in isolates from commercial poultry farms in Indonesia showing clinical signs of IB disease. After the molecular analysis has been conducted by amplifying the S1 fragment gene of IBV isolates, this study discovers new pathogenic 4/91-like and QX-like IBV strains circulating in the country. In fact, this is the first molecularly proof report on these two strains in Indonesia. In general, this study reveals the infection of 4/91-like strain to exhibit signs that resemble a QX-like infection such as nephritis and cystic oviduct. Besides, \"false layer\" syndrome is discovered on all samples infected by 4/91-like IBV strain. As previous studies have investigated the low cross-protection capability of existing IBV vaccines to strains circulating in Indonesia, this study confirms the above-mentioned strains to have different variances than existing vaccines. In other Available at www.veterinaryworld.org/Vol.12/February-2019/15.pdf words, this study suggests molecular characteristics of the two strains as a basis for the selection of virus strains in the making of proper IBV vaccines applied to commercial poultry farms in Indonesia. Furthermore, results of this study may also be used in establishing a more effective vaccination strategy for the country's poultry industry as a means to control the circulation and spreading of IB disease. For example, the enhanced strategy may include a combination of heterologous vaccines. Besides, it may include the application of a newly developed vaccine that is clinically fitted with IBV virus strain(s) circulating on the fields. According to previous reports, IBV has been recognized to have a high mutation rate; therefore, future researches may focus on active and periodic monitoring on IBV strains circulating and mutating in Indonesia to support the country's control and preventive programs of IB disease. Then, the discovery of 4/91-like and QX-like clusters has brought up a further need to check their real pathogenicity. As the current study is intended to focus on molecular analysis of IBV strains that manifest certain clinical signs in infected chickens, a challenge experiment on SPF chickens is, thus, required to prove the pathogenicity of the discovered IBV strain clusters.",
