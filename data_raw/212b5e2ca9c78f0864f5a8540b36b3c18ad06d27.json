            "text": "A growing body of literature suggests that most chronic autoimmune diseases are associated with inappropriate inflammation mediated by Toll-like receptor (TLR) 3, TLR7/8, or TLR9. Therefore, research into blocking TLR activation to treat these disorders has become a hot topic. Here, we report the immunomodulatory properties of a nonstimulatory CpG-containing oligodeoxynucleotide (CpG-ODN), CpG-c41, which had previously only been known as a TLR9 antagonist. In this study, we found that both in vitro and in vivo CpG-c41 decreased levels of various proinflammatory factors that were induced by single activation or coactivation of intracellular TLRs, but not membrane-bound TLRs, no matter what downstream signal pathways the TLRs depend on. Moreover, CpG-c41 attenuated excessive inflammation in the imiquimod-induced psoriasis-like mouse model of skin inflammation by suppressing immune cell infiltration and release of inflammatory factors. We also found evidence that the immunosuppressive effects of CpG-c41 on other intracellular TLRs are mediated by a TLR9-independent mechanism. These results suggest that CpG-c41 acts as an upstream of signaling cascades, perhaps on the processes of ligand internalization and transfer. Taken together, these results suggest that CpG-c41 disrupts various aspects of intracellular TLR activation and provides a deeper insight into the regulation of innate immunity.",

The drugs currently in clinical use cannot effectively eliminate autoimmune diseases and may cause side effects. In recent years, an increasing number of studies have shown that innate immune disorders are closely related to autoimmune diseases [1] . The pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) of the innate immune system are able to recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), which trigger relevant signal transmission leading to inflammatory responses. Unfortunately, excessive inflammation can induce autoimmune diseases, such as psoriasis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and rheumatoid arthritis [2] [3] [4] [5] . Therefore, identification of new therapeutic targets to ameliorate autoimmune pathogenesis has become a research priority.",

The receptors utilize various downstream signaling cascades; for example, TLR3 depends on the TRIF pathway and TLR7 on the MyD88 pathway. Nevertheless, activation through different TLRs induces similar proinflammatory responses, characterized by release of factors such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 [13] . TLR activation can result in the formation of the Nod-like receptor 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome [14] and promote the release of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18, which are involved in many diseases [15, 16] .",

Current drugs nonselectively target the terminal process and inhibit the resulting proinflammatory factors. Antibodies against TNF-\u03b1, IL-17, and IL-23 have all been used to treat psoriasis.

The members of the TLR family have unique structural features that recognize specific PAMPs, and each family member may be characterized by the signaling pathways it uses to promote inflammatory responses. From another point of view, the TLRs could be classified according to their distribution in cells. Unlike cell membrane TLRs, which undergo direct activation, intracellular TLRs require additional steps to initiate recognition, including ligand uptake and receptor circulation [35] . This study demonstrates that CpG-c41 selectively suppresses the activation of intracellular TLRs. It emphasizes the functional significance of TLR distribution, which provides a new strategy for controlling excessive inflammation by targeting TLRs based on their locations. Intracellular TLRs generally use distinct downstream signaling cascades; TLR3 signals through the TRIF pathway, while TLR7 and TLR9 signal through the MyD88 pathway. CpG-c41 mediates the same immunosuppressive effects on these TLRs, suggesting that the mechanism of suppression is not related to downstream signaling cascades. Although crosstalk is a common phenomenon due to intersection of the different signaling pathways, this study indicates that the immunosuppressive effects of CpG-c41 on other intracellular TLRs are not dependent on crosstalk with TLR9. Taken together, these findings suggest that CpG-c41 could mediate its suppressive effects by acting on the processes of ligand internalization or transfer, upstream of the signaling cascades.",

More recent studies have found that many CpG-ODNs do not have immunostimulatory properties; in fact, only some CpG-ODNs block the activation of TLR9 [18, 36] . As we previously reported, CpG-c41, which we screened from a large collection of nonimmunostimulatory CpG-ODNs, has a special sequence structure and an outstanding capacity to suppress TLR9 activation [22] . In this study, we discovered additional evidence that CpG-c41 has multiple immunosuppressive effects. Interestingly, we found that the TLR9 agonist CpG-1826 had similar immunosuppressive effects on TLR3 and TLR7, even when its immunostimulatory function was lost in TLR9 \u2212/\u2212 Figure 6 : Analysis of inflammatory infiltrates in the affected skin of mice with a psoriasis-like disease by laser confocal microscopy.

Unlike CpG-c41, some other immunosuppressive CpG-ODNs only inhibit a subset of the intracellular TLRs [36, 37] . By contrast, CpG-c41 has dramatic effects on innate immunity. In comparison with currently available drugs, CpG-c41 would have several advantages. First, it selectively inhibits the activation of all intracellular, but not cell membranebound, TLRs. Second, by blocking upstream events, it could simultaneously suppress multiple proinflammatory factors. Finally, its nonstimulatory nature would not negatively affect the normal immune response, but it could suppress excessive, abnormal inflammation to help patients through the acute phase of disease.",

Wide-type (WT) female BALB/c mice (8-10 weeks) were purchased from HFK Bioscience (Beijing, China), and TLR9 \u2212/\u2212 C57BL/6 mice (6-8 weeks) were obtained from the Chinese Academy of Inspection and Quarantine (Beijing, China). Mice were housed in the Experimental Animal Platform of the Medical Research Center at the Third Military Medical University and kept under specificpathogen-free conditions with free access to food and water. All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the National and Institutional Guidelines for Animal Care and Use and approved by the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee of the Third Military Medical University. 2.2. Cell Culture. The mouse RAW264.7 macrophage cell line was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Gibco, USA), and human monocytic THP-1 cells were grown in RPMI-1640 (Gibco, USA).",

Moreover, although both TLR7 and TLR9 depend on the MyD88 pathway, CpG-1826 had immunosuppressive effects in TLR7-replete TLR9 \u2212/\u2212 conditions. These findings support the interpretation that CpG-ODN-mediated immunosuppression is unrelated to the downstream signaling cascade.On the other hand, the sequence structures of CpG-ODNs are thought to contribute to their immune",
