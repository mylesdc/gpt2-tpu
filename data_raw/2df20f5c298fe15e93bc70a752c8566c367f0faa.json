            "text": "Influenza A, B and C viruses are members of the Orthomyxoviridae family that can cause influenza in humans [1] . Influenza A viruses exist in humans, various other mammal species, and birds; migratory or domestic waterfowl are their largest reservoir. Humans are thought to be the primary hosts and reservoir of influenza B and C viruses, although both have been identified in other hosts after reverse zoonotic transmission from humans. While influenza B virus is a common seasonal human pathogen similar to influenza A virus in its clinical presentation, influenza C virus causes primarily upper respiratory tract infections in children [2] . Clinical manifestations (cough, fever, and malaise) are typically mild, but infants are susceptible to serious lower respiratory tract infections [3] . Influenza C viruses co-circulate with influenza A and B viruses and causes local epidemics [4, 5] . Six genetic and antigenic lineages of influenza C viruses have been described, and as in influenza B viruses, are considered monsubtypic [6, 7] . Co-circulation of multiple subtypes of influenza allows for rapid viral evolution through the process of antigenic shift, a property previously only shown for influenza A viruses. Thus, both influenza B and C viruses do not have pandemic potential. In contrast, the Influenza A genus includes 17 hemagglutinin and 9 neuraminidase subtypes, and reassortment among different subtypes has repeatedly generated pandemic viruses to which the human population is na\u00efve [8] [9] [10] . It is the animal reservoirs of diverse influenza A viruses that give them the unique property within orthomyxoviruses of causing human pandemics.",

Genetic analysis showed a close relation between Japanese human and Chinese swine influenza C isolates [12, 13] . Serological surveys in Japan and the United Kingdom found 9.9% and 19% of swine, respectively, to have positive HI antibody titers to human influenza C viruses, suggesting that the virus is not uncommon in swine [14, 15] . Swine inoculated with influenza C virus had mild respiratory disease and transmitted the virus to naive swine by direct contact [11] . Here we characterize an orthomyxovirus isolated from a clinically ill pig and show that the virus is distantly related to human influenza C virus and readily infects and is transmissible in both ferrets and pigs. Genetic and antigenic analysis suggest that this virus represents a new subtype of influenza C virus, raising the possibility of reassortment and antigenic shift as mechanisms for influenza C virus evolution which could pose a potential threat to human health.",

Real-time reverse transcription PCR (rt-RT-PCR) was negative for influenza A virus [16] . In swine testicle (ST) cells, the viruses caused influenza-like cytopathic effects (CPE) by day 3. The cell culture harvests were again negative for influenza A virus by rt-RT-PCR. Electron microscopic (EM) studies of the cell cultures demonstrated features characteristic of an Orthomyxovirus (Fig. 1) . Negative-staining EM showed enveloped spherical to pleomorphic viral particles approximately 100-120 nm in diameter (Fig. 1A) . The virion surface contained dense projections 10-13 nm in length and 4-6 nm in diameter. Thin-section EM studies of infected cells revealed filamentous budding of virions from the plasma membrane (Fig. 1B) . These data strongly suggested the virus to be a member of the family Orthomyxoviridae. Enzymatic assays revealed that the virus had negligible neuraminidase but detectable O-acetylesterase activity using 4-nitrophenyl acetate, suggesting it to be a member of the influenza C genus. However, further RT-PCR analysis was negative for influenza B and C viruses [17] . RT-PCR or PCR assays to detect porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, porcine coronavirus, and porcine circovirus were also negative (data not shown).",

BlastP searches of the putative proteins identified modest homology to human influenza C virus, suggesting that this virus was distantly related to human influenza C virus (Table 1) . Consequently, the virus was provisionally designated C/swine/Oklahoma/1334/ 2011 (C/OK).

C/OK shared approximately 69%-72% mean pairwise identity to influenza C viruses and 39%-41% identity to influenza A and B viruses. Homology between the influenza A and B PB1 proteins was approximately 61% and intrasubtype PB1 proteins of influenza A viruses are extremely conserved reaching up to 90% homology. PB1 protein alignments indicated that C/OK was more closely related to influenza C viruses than to influenza A and B viruses but more distant from individual members of human influenza C type. Pairwise identity between C/OK and influenza C viruses was considerably lower for polymerase basic 2 (PB2) and polymerase 3 (P3) (53% and 50%, respectively). In influenza A and B viruses segment 3 is referred to as polymerase acidic (PA) protein because of its pKa of approximately 5.2. Conversely, segment 3 of influenza C viruses encodes a polymerase with a neutral pH (pKa ,7.2) and is referred to as P3 [18] .

Unlike influenza A viruses, influenza C viruses exhibit little genetic variability and evolve at a comparably slower rate. Influenza A viruses exist as multiple subtypes and cause disease in numerous mammals. In contrast, influenza C viruses are comprised of a single subtype in its primary human host. Here we characterize a novel swine influenza virus, C/swine/Oklahoma/1334/2011 (C/OK), having only modest genetic similarity to human influenza C viruses. No cross-reaction was observed between C/OK and human influenza C viruses. Antibodies that cross react with C/OK were identified in a significant number of swine but not human sera samples, suggesting that C/OK circulates in pigs. Additionally, we show that C/OK is capable of infecting and transmitting by direct contact in both pigs and ferrets. These results suggest that C/OK represents a new subtype of influenza C viruses. This is significant, as co-circulation of multiple subtypes of influenza allows for rapid viral evolution through antigenic shift, a property previously only shown for influenza A viruses. The ability of C/OK to infect ferrets along with the absence of antibodies to C/OK in humans, suggests that such viruses may become a potential threat to human health.",

We first addressed the zoonotic potential of C/OK virus by conducting a pathogenesis and transmission study in the ferret model. After intranasal inoculation of ferrets, C/OK virus was first detected in nasal washes on day 3 (mean titer, 3.3 log 10 TCID 50 / mL) (Fig. 3) . C/OK virus was first detected in ferrets exposed by direct contact to inoculated ferrets on day 7, reaching a mean titer of 4.3 log 10 TCID 50 /mL by day 10. Virus was not detected in ferrets exposed to respiratory droplets. No clinical signs of disease were observed. In the tissues of ferrets on day 5 post-inoculation (p.i.), a mean titer of 3.9 log 10 TCID 50 /mL was observed in the nasal turbinates, but no virus was detected in the upper and lower trachea, lung, small intestine, liver, or spleen. Histopathological examination of lung tissues showed no typical influenza lesions. These results are consistent with a previous study that investigated human influenza C replication in ferret alveolar macrophage cells where viral replication with titers .10 4 egg infectious dose 50 from days 4 to 9 were measured with no cytopathic effects [33] . All ferrets that were inoculated or exposed by direct contact and 1/3 of the ferrets exposed to respiratory droplets seroconverted 3 weeks after exposure as measured by HI assay (GMT = 780). To assess the pathogenicity and transmissibility of the virus in swine, we similarly challenged swine intranasally with C/OK (Fig. S1 ). Virus was first detected in nasal swabs on day 3 p.i. by using an rt-RT-PCR method specifically developed for C/OK virus. Virus shedding peaked at day 8 p.i. and remained detectable on day 10. Virus was detected in swine exposed by direct contact on days 7 and 9 after exposure. No clinical signs of illness were observed. Lung samples collected from inoculated swine on day 7 p.i. showed no evidence of the virus by rt-RT-PCR. Histopathological examination of lung tissues showed no typical influenza lesions. Sera collected on day 14 p.i. from donor pigs were positive for antibodies to C/OK virus in an HI assay (GMT = 30.3). All 5 pigs were positive for antibodies to C/OK. Additionally, 2 of the 5 direct contact pigs seroconverted by day 13 post exposure. These data suggest that in animals the replication kinetics is slower for C/ OK virus than for influenza A viruses and infection in both swine and ferrets was limited to the upper respiratory tract. The ability of C/OK to readily transmit to contact ferrets suggests that a level of transmission potential to humans is possible. Zoonotic H5N1 and H9N2 influenza A viruses are typically unable to transmit in ferrets.",

C/OK replicated, in order of highest replication, in ST, MDCK, Marc-145, HRT-18G and A549 cells (Fig. S2A) . Minimal replication was observed in BHK-21 and PK-15 cells. In marked contrast, the human influenza C virus C/Taylor showed poor growth and replicated only in ST and HRT-18G and not in other cells tested (Fig. S2B) . It should be noted however that cultivation of influenza C/Taylor virus was performed at 33uC, the optimal temperature that is typically used to propagate human influenza C virus [34] . This virus failed to replicate at 37uC in our hands which differs from the C/OK virus that can replicate efficiently at this temperature (data not shown). These results suggest that C/OK has a broader cellular tropism than C/Taylor and is also not restricted at elevated temperatures for replication.

The receptor binding specificity and affinity are mainly determined by the 9-O-acetyl group of the Neu5,9Ac2 [36] . As a result, the virus encodes a sialate-O-acetylesterase, not neuraminidase, in order to release virions from infected cells by cleavage of the 9-O-acetyl group [37] . To provide structural insights to the observed different tropism, we conducted structural modeling of the C/OK HE protein in complex with the receptor based on the solved X-ray crystallographic structure of a human influenza C virus (C/ Johannesburg/1/66) HE protein [36] . The overall 53% sequence identity between the two HE proteins allows us to predict important structural features such as the receptor-binding pocket and the enzymatic active site of the C/OK HE protein. Based on the assumption that the HE protein uses similar sites for function, our structural modeling analysis identified a conserved enzymatic active site but revealed a variable receptor-binding pocket between two HE proteins (Figs. 4 and S3) . These results are consistent with the observed difference in cellular tropism. For example, both HE proteins possess an identical catalytic triad: S71/H369/D365 for C/Johannesburg and S73/H375/D372 for C/OK (Fig. 4A) . The other two substrate-interacting residues for optimal enzymatic function are also completely conserved in the two HE proteins (G99/N131 for C/Johannesburg and G101/N133 for C/OK). In addition, both HE proteins utilize two conserved arginine residues for substrate binding (R72/R332 for C/Johannesburg and R74/ R342 for C/OK). The conserved enzymatic site between C/ Johannesburg and C/OK suggests that C/OK utilizes 9-O-acetyl sialic acid as the cellular receptor for infection.",

The influenza C HE protein uses two binding pockets for recognizing the receptor: one binds to the 9-O-acetyl group while the other engages the 5-N-acetyl group [36] . As shown in Fig. 4 , the 5-N-acetyl binding pocket of C/OK HE becomes smaller as compared to that of C/Johannesburg due to LRW substitution, i.e. L198 in C/Johannesburg is replaced by W201 at C/OK HE position 201; the large rigid aromatic side-chain of W201 extends Figure 3 . Replication of C/OK virus in ferrets challenged intranasally (donors) or exposed by direct or aerosol contact. Three ferrets (donor ferrets) were inoculated intranasally with 10 6 TCID 50 of C/OK virus in 1 ml of sterile PBS. Two inoculated ferrets were also housed separately for virus titration and histopathology in organs. At 23 h p.i., each of the three remaining donor ferrets was housed in a cage with one na\u00efve directcontact ferret (n = 3). An additional ferret (n = 3) was placed in an adjacent cage separated from the donor's cage by a two layers of wire mesh (,5 cm apart) that prevented physical contact but allowed the passage of respiratory droplets. To monitor virus shedding, nasal washes were collected from ferrets 3, 5, 7, and 10 days p.i. Virus was titrated in ST cells as log 10 TCID 50 /ml and values shown are the mean 6 standard error. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1003176.g003 into the binding pocket (Fig. 4B, 4C, and 4D) . The binding pocket for the 9-O-acetyl group is nearly identical in C/ Johannesburg and C/OK, implying the utility of the 9-Oacetyl-neuraminic acid for C/OK virus infection. For interacting with the 9-O-acetyl group, human influenza C viruses utilize a cluster of amino acid residues Y141, F239, Y241, R250, and R302, which is also used by the C/OK virus except for two phenylalanine residues replacing tyrosine (Y141) and arginine (R250), respectively. We hypothesize that these amino acid differences may alter the binding specificity and affinity of the HE protein to the receptor that in turn result in the observed difference in cellular tropism between two viruses.",

The phylogenetic analyses, together with the observations of genomic structure, indicated that this novel virus is more closely related to influenza C than to other members of the Orthomyxoviridae family including influenza A and B viruses, and suggested that the virus could be considered a new subtype of influenza C virus, despite its divergence from human influenza C viruses, which is similar to the divergence between influenza A and B viruses. Identification of this virus was not an isolated case, as we have identified four additional swab samples from swine showing influenza-like symptoms that were positive for this virus in a RT-PCR assay (data not shown). These samples were collected from different pig farms across the U.S. between 2010 and 2012.",

As such, reassortment may occur between C/OK and human influenza C viruses in pigs because both viruses can infect and transmit among pigs and because swine has been documented in serving as a mixing vessel for reassortment of influenza A viruses [38, 39] .",

The ability of C/OK virus to readily transmit to contact ferrets suggests that a level of transmission potential to humans is possible. Second, C/OK virus displays a broader cellular tropism compared to human influenza C virus, and this virus seems quite plastic in terms of propagation because high temperatures such as 37uC do not restrict its replication at least in cell culture. Human influenza C virus causes a mild respiratory disease in humans and the infection is normally confined to the upper respiratory tract, although occasionally it can also cause lower respiratory infection [5] . Considering that C/ OK virus varies significantly from currently circulating human influenza C viruses in the amino acid sequences of predicted proteins, assessment of clinical disease in humans, particularly in children, caused potentially by C/OK is justified. Knowledge of its presence in human clinical settings is important to any future attempt to manage and control the disease outbreak. By using the nucleotide sequence of C/OK virus reported in this work, sensitive and specific diagnostic methods can be developed to investigate the pathogenesis and epidemiology of this novel virus in humans.",

The obstacle is largely due to a lack of suitable cell lines for influenza C virus isolation as suggested previously [5, 34] . In contrast, identification and cultivation of the C/OK in the ST cell line is relatively straightforward. The emerging but puzzling question then is why this virus has not been identified until now. We suspect that several factors including use of less susceptible cell lines and complicated co-infection often involving influenza A viruses and other viruses having the capacity to agglutinate red blood cells may account for the previous failures in identifying this virus. Alternatively, the C/ OK virus may have spread to swine in recent years from an unknown animal reservoir. On-going retrospective seroepidemiological analyses will help to address this question.",

To explore the possible structural origins of this difference, we created a homology model for C/OK using the crystal structure of the influenza C HE protein (Fig. S3) . The high sequence identity (53%, Fig. S3 ) between C/OK HE and influenza C suggest that the quality of this model will be high, given previous work in homology modeling and structure validation for influenza A and B HA proteins in which similar sequence similarities gave RMSD errors of ,1 \u00c5 [40, 41] . The predicted receptor binding for C/OK HE appears on the top face of the receptor binding domain similar to human influenza C HE protein and remote homolog HE proteins of other viruses such as coronavirus and torovirus (,30% sequence similarity to influenza C HE) [42] . Here, four out of nine residues of the receptor binding site and residues around the binding pocket of HE of human influenza C are retained in that of C/OK (Fig. S4) . Previous work has shown that receptor binding specificity and affinity are sensitive to substitutions in the receptor binding site of HE and HA [43, 44] . Examining the predicted receptor-binding site of C/OK HE revealed changes in the receptor binding site relative to human influenza C HE. The most notable difference is a reduction in the size of the 5-N-acetyl binding pocket of C/OK HE relative to C HE due to the L198 in C HE being replaced by W in C/OK HE (Fig. 4) . Alternatively, the binding pocket for the 9-O-acetyl group is similar between the two HE proteins (Fig. 4) . We speculate that these differences may indicate that C/OK HE utilizes a different substrate than influenza C HE. Further experimental verifications of are required to test this prediction.",

Numerous studies have shown that influenza C viruses have the slowest evolutionary rate among influenza viruses [13, 19, [45] [46] [47] . One theory is that influenza C viruses, like influenza B viruses, are close or at an evolutionary equilibrium in humans, whereas influenza A viruses have not yet reached an equilibrium [48] . Consistent with this hypothesis is that only a single subtype is thought to exist for influenza B and C viruses and humans, not other mammals, are the primary hosts of influenza B and C viruses. The discovery of C/OK in pigs, being distantly related to human C viruses, seems to challenge these accepted views and warrant future studies of influenza C virus evolution.",

Most compelling evidence in support of the tentative designation of the C/OK virus are (i) seven genomic segments, (ii) 39 and 5's NC regions similar to those of human influenza C viruses, and (iii) HE protein sharing approximately 53% homology with that of influenza C viruses. The last parameter is the primary determinant to classify subtypes of influenza A virus. However, the overall divergence between C/ OK and human influenza C viruses is similar to that observed between influenza A and B viruses and argues for classification of C/OK into a potential new virus genus. Influenza A, B, and C viruses are classified on the basis of antigenic differences between their nucleoprotein (NP) and matrix (M) proteins [1] . Intriguingly, only modest homologies of these structural proteins between C/ OK and human influenza C further confound the provisional classification for this newly discovered virus. Recently the family Orthomyxoviridae was expanded by including two novel genera, Thogotovirus, consisting of three viruses that infect birds and ticks, as well as the genus Isavirus, consisting of infectious salmon anemia virus [49, 50] . For the novel swine influenza virus reported here, perhaps not until attaining more detailed serological, virological, and molecular data, a final classification of this virus can be made. Of particular importance are reassortment experiments between C/OK and human influenza C viruses.",

Detailed pathogenicity and transmission methodology is available in SI Appendix, Supplementary Materials and Methods. Three donors were inoculated intranasally under light isoflurane anesthesia with 10 6 TCID 50 of swine/ Oklahoma/1334/2011 virus in 1 ml of sterile PBS. Two additional ferrets were similarly inoculated and were housed separately for virus titration and histopathology in organs. At 23 h p.i., each of the three remaining donor ferrets was housed in a cage with one na\u00efve direct-contact ferret (n = 3). An additional ferret (n = 3) was placed in an adjacent cage separated from the donor's cage by a two layers of wire mesh (,5 cm apart) that prevented physical contact but allowed the passage of respiratory droplets. Clinical signs of infection, relative inactivity index [53] , weight, and temperature were recorded on days 0, 3, 5, 7, and 10 p.i.. Nasal washes were collected from ferrets 3, 5, 7, and 10 days p.i. Two donor animals were euthanized 5 dpi, and tissue samples were collected. Samples were homogenized and virus was titrated (log 10 TCID 50 per gram of tissue) in ST cells. Tissues were also subjected to histopathologic analysis.",

The structure of C/Johannesburg/1/66 HE was used as template (PDB id: 1FLC) [36] because the two HE proteins show both high sequence and secondary structure similarity. The quality of the modeled structure was estimated by Verify_3D and 95.47% of the modeled residues are compatible with the structure (averaged 3D-1D score .0.2) [55] , suggesting that the quality of the modeling is good. The distance between the modeled structure and template is 0.49 angstrom. Electrostatic surface maps were generated using APBS [56] . Figure S1 rt-RT-PCR Ct values of nasal swabs from swine inoculated intranasally with C/OK (donors) and from swine exposed to inoculated swine by direct contact. Cartoon and surface representations of HE structure are shown below. HE was colored blue. Residues that are not identical in C/ Johannesburg/1/66 HE were marked red.
