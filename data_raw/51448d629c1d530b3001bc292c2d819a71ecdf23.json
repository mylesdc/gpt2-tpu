            "text": "The GeXP-based assay has recently been developed for simultaneous detection of multiple pathogens. So far, the application of the GeXP assay to test larger clinical samples has hardly been reported. Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the leading cause of death in children worldwide and a substantial proportion of childhood CAP is caused by viruses. Rapid and accurate diagnosis of virus infection is important for the clinical management of CAP. In this study, we explored the GeXP assay for simultaneous detection of 20 types/subtypes of viruses in hospitalized children with CAP. A total of 1699 nasopharyngeal swabs were prospectively collected and viral nucleic acid was extracted and assayed. Using viral genomic DNA or RNA as template, we showed that at the concentration of 10 4 copies of DNA or RNA of each virus/\u03bcl, all 20 target viruses were simultaneously identified by the GeXP assay. Fifteen control microorganisms, in contrast, failed to be amplified by the assay. About 65% of cases tested in this study had viral infection, with patients aged <3 years having a 70% positive rate, significantly higher than that in patients aged > 3 years (40%). The most frequently detected virus was RSV followed by PIV3, HRV, ADV and HBoV. Seasonal distribution analysis revealed that RSV was the most predominant in autumn and winter, while in spring and summer PIV3 and RSV were the most frequently identified with similar positive percentages. One hundred twenty randomly-chosen samples tested by the GeXP assay were re-evaluated by mono-RT-PCR , the results showed 97.5% diagnosis agreement between these 2 methods. Our findings suggest that the GeXP assay could be a valuable diagnostic tool for virus infection in pediatric patients with CAP.",

            "text": "Multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (multiplex RT-PCR) combined with automated capillary electrophoresis has provided a platform for multi-target genome analysis. An example of this technology is the GenomeLab GeXP Genetic Analysis System (https://www.beckmancoulter.com/wsrportal/bibliography?docname=BR-11776A.pdf) developed by Beckman Coulter (Crea, CA, USA). The principle of the GeXP multiplex amplification assay (the GeXP-based assay) is that diverse genomic sequences are specifically amplified in one reaction, and the amplicons with different sizes labelled with fluorescence dye are then separated and distinguished by automated capillary electrophoresis. For multiplex PCR, two sets of primers are used: one set of forward and reverse primers that are chimeric (target primers) containing a target sequence and a universal tag at the 5'-end. The other set of forward and reverse primers (universal primers) targeting the tag is fluorescence labeled. With the use of a significantly higher concentration of the universal primers than target primers in the reaction system, the target sequence is amplified with the chimeric primers in first few cycles, and then the amplification is overtaken by the universal primers, eventually generating amplicons containing target sequence and fluorescence-labeled tag [13] . Using the GeXP-based assay, Hu et al. was able to simultaneously genotype nine serotypes of enteroviruses [13] ; Zhang et al. detected and differentiated 11 duck viruses in one reaction [14] ; and Li et al simultaneously detected multiple human respiratory viruses in nasopharyngeal aspirates from patients with pneumonitis or bronchopneumonia [15] . So far, the application of the GeXP assay to test larger clinical samples has rarely been reported. In this study, we used the GeXP-based assay for simultaneous detection of 20 types/subtypes of viruses in 1699 nasopharyngeal specimens collected from hospitalized children with CAP.",

So far, only a few reports have described the use of these techniques for pathogen detection in children with CAP [7, 11, 12] . Determination of viral etiology for pediatric CAP in larger clinical series has not been reported. In the present study, we applied multiplex RT-PCR together with automated capillary electrophoresis, namely the GeXP-based assay, to detect virus in 1699 nasopharyngeal specimens from hospitalized children with CAP. We showed that the GeXP-based assay had high sensitivity and specificity for simultaneous detection of multiple viruses, and about 65% of cases tested were positive for virus. We randomly chose 120 samples that had been tested by the GeXP-based assay, redo the mono-RT-PCR and found 97.5% diagnosis agreement between these 2 methods (data not shown, and mono-RT-PCR was run as the multiplex reactions but used only the chimeric and universal primers for the single target virus that was tested positive in the sample). Further analysis revealed that patients younger than 3 years had a significantly higher virus infection rate (positive rate) than those older than 3 years. Seasonal distribution analysis saw RSV as the most predominant in autumn and winter, while in spring and summer PIV3 and RSV were the most frequently identified with similar positive percentages. Only a few reports have thus far described different assays for virus detection in pediatric CAP patients [7, 11, 12, 19] . Chen et al measured antibodies in 1204 serum samples collected from CAP children and found only about 15% were positive for virus [19] , in sharp contrast to our findings and others' [7, 11, 12] . This discrepancy is likely attributed to 1) that the antibody assay targeted only a few types of viruses, i.e., influenza A and B, parainfluenza 1, 2 and 3 and RSV [19] ; and 2) that the antibody assay is less sensitive than PCR [7, 16] . Juven et al explored several methods, i.e., cell culture, viral antigen detection, antibody assay and RT-PCR to determine the etiology of CAP in 254 hospitalized children, and they discovered that 62% of the patients had viral infection with RSV (29%) and HRV (24%) being the most commonly detected [7] . Cantais tested 9 types of viruses, i.e., RSV, ADV, HMPV, HBoV, coronavirus, FluA, FluB, HRV and PIVs using the biplex commercially-available RT-PCR Kit in 85 children with CAP, and revealed that the viral infection was 62.4% [11] . Rhedin et al employed real time PCR to detect virus in nasopharyngeal aspirates from children aged 5 years with CAP, and reported that viruses were detected in 81% of the cases [12] . These data together with ours suggest that majority of pediatric CAP cases have virus infection, especially in younger patients.",

            "text": "To our knowledge, this study is the first to use the GeXP-based assay for virus detection in pediatric CAP patients. The assay covered a broad range of virus targets and a large size of samples were tested. Due to its automation and multiplex procedure, the GeXP-based assay is less laborious than mono-PCR. It also saves samples and avoids well-to-well and pipetting errors. In the present study, plasmid DNA was used as the internal control, which monitors only PCR but not the reverse transcription step. Interestingly, in a few published papers describing the GeXP-based multiplex assays internal controls were not employed [13] [14] [15] . We showed that genomic RNA from all RNA viruses in the target panel was successfully amplified by the GeXP-based assay (Fig 1A) , indicating that reverse transcription is not a problem. However, we felt an RNA template should be used as the internal control in future work. Another limitation of this assay is that highly specialized laboratory equipment is needed, namely an automated capillary electrophoresis system. Many clinical laboratories do not have this equipment, and outsourcing the fragment analysis would greatly increase the turnaround time. Control template pool containing 1 ng nucleic acid of each control pathogen and 10 3 copies of internal control was used and the reaction was repeated. As shown in this scaled-down plot, all those tiny peaks were identified as background products. Similar results were observed in 3 independent reactions. (TIF)",
