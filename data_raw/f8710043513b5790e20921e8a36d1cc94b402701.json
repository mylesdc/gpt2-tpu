Highly purified preparations of VSV virions from three different cell lines of human, mouse and hamster origin were analyzed for the presence of cellular proteins using mass spectrometry. We have successfully confirmed the presence of several previously-identified cellular proteins within VSV virions and identified a number of additional proteins likely to also be present within the virions. In total, sixty-four cellular proteins were identified, of which nine were found in multiple preparations. A combination of immunoblotting and proteinase K protection assay was used to verify the presence of several of these proteins (integrin \uf0621, heat shock protein 90 kDa, heat shock cognate 71 kDa protein, annexin 2, elongation factor 1a) within the virions.",

Based on this analysis (data not shown), we selected three cell lines, capable of producing the high VSV titers: BHK21 (baby hamster kidney cells), 4T1 (mouse mammary tumor cells) and A549 (human lung carcinoma cells) (Fig. 1 ). BHK21 has been extensively used as a standard cell line for growing VSV. A549 and 4T1 cells also supported suitable viral replication although to lower titers than BHK21 cells (Fig. 2B) . The use of different cell lines allowed us to compare viral host protein content across species and cell types. In addition, the A549 and 4T1 cell lines were included to allow identification of cellular proteins potentially lacking sufficient homology to human or mouse proteins to be recognized from a hamster source (BHK21).",

In contrast to the BHK21 preparation, the virion preparations from A549 and 4T-1 showed fewer intact virus particles, and a large number of unwound nucleocapids could be seen ( Fig. 2A) . Some of the membranous structures present may represent the viral membranes dissociated from the nucleocapsids, although the possibility of them being cellular vesicles cannot be ruled out [35] . Consistent with the differences observed by EM ( Fig. 2A) was the variation in the number of infectious particles per \uf06dg of total protein (Fig. 2B) . However, when equal quantities of total protein were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and visualized by Coomassie staining (Fig. 2D ) or analyzed by immunoblotting against VSV proteins (data not shown), the quantity and distribution of the viral proteins was similar in all samples as were the intensity and number of minor bands representing cellular or degraded viral proteins. Additionally, when total RNA extracted from samples containing equal quantities of protein was analyzed by Northern blotting using a probe complimentary to the 3' end of VSV genome, greater numbers of viral genomes were recovered from purified virus samples from 4T1 and A549 than from BHK21 cells (Fig. 2C ). Smaller products representing defecting interfering genomic RNAs were not detected in any sample, even upon overexposure of the membrane (data not shown). This supports our hypothesis that the filament structures seen in Figure 2A for A549 and 4T1 virion preparations are unwound VSV nucleocapids containing viral genomic RNA. That these filaments are not cellular nucleic acids is also supported by the lack of detection of any histone or ribosomal proteins in the A549 and 4T1 samples by MS (Table 1) . Together, the Northern blot ( Fig. 2C ) and Coomassie staining ( Fig. 2D ) data suggest the observed visual differences between samples ( Fig. 2A ) are at least in part due to differences in particle stability/infectivity rather than simply sample purity.",

This process removed the proteinase and cleaved peptides and aided removal of any residual contaminating vesicles as proteinase treatment would decrease the density of vesicles to a greater extent than the virions [39] .

In contrast, substantial amounts of the viral matrix (M), nucleocapsid (N), phosphoprotein (P) and large polymerase (L) proteins were protected from ProK activity by the viral membrane, although we estimate that about 50% of these proteins were lost from the BHK21 derived virions during this process, about 70% from the 4T1 derived virions and about 90% from the ProK treated and additionally purified 4T1 derived virions. This loss of presumably membrane-protected proteins was likely due to physical disruption of the virion membrane, and the differences in protein loss were consistent with the varying degrees of virion disruption observed by EM ( Fig. 2A) . Due to the high loss of protein from the 4T1 derived sample, we were unable to obtain sufficiently concentrated ",

This sample consistently showed a high level of protection of these proteins except for annexin 2 which can be located either intracellularly or on the extracellular membrane, and therefore a portion of it is likely vulnerable to ProK degradation [40] . In contrast, for integrin \uf0621, where the extracellular domain is expected to be outside of the viral membrane, the protein levels were greatly reduced in all proteinase K treated samples, as seen for the viral G protein. Figure 2A ) were left untreated (-ProK) or were treated with Proteinase K (+ProK) for 1.5 h at 37\u00b0C to remove all surface exposed proteins. Following ProK treatment, one 4T1derived virion sample was also centrifuged through a 20% sucrose gradient to remove ProK and free floating peptides (+ProK +Purify). ( We also analyzed untreated virion samples for two proteins not detected by our MS analysis. The stress-inducible 70 kDa heat shock protein 70 (Hsp72, also known as Hsp70 and HSPA1A), previously shown to enhance measles virus transcription [41, 42] and determine measles neurovirulence in mice [43] , was readily detectable by immunoblotting in lysates prepared from cells heat shocked at 43\u00b0C for 4 h (Fig. 3C) . Without heat shock, Hsp72 was also easily detected in A549 lysates, weakly detected in 4T-1 lysates and not detected at all in BHK21 lysates. In keeping with this, Hsp72 could be detected in virions from A549 cells but was not seen in virions from 4T1 or BHK21 cells. That Hsp72 was detected equally well in all the heat shocked lysates suggests these differences are not solely due to variable antibody recognition of Hsp72 from different sources. VSV infection did not appear to induce Hsp72 expression at the time point analyzed. Immunoblotting also confirmed the presence of cyclophilin A (Fig. 3D ) in virions derived from BHK21 and 4T1 cells (the A549 preparation was not tested for this protein).",

To compare host protein content of VSV virions across species and cell types, we analyzed virions isolated from three different cell types of human, mouse and hamster origin. In total, our analysis successfully identified all five VSV proteins as well as 64 cellular proteins (Table 1) , plus keratins. For the majority of the identified proteins, the predicted molecular weight was consistent with the size range encompassed by the 1-D SDS-PAGE gel slice the protein was found in, which served as an additional confirmation of the cellular protein identity. However, the two groups of proteins, keratins (identified but not shown in Table 1 ) and ubiquitin (Table 1) , were broadly distributed among the gel slices. Keratins are common environmental contaminants and their broad distribution among the gel slices without correlation to the predicted molecular weight suggests contamination as the primary source of the keratin peptides identified in our MS analysis. Ubiquitin was also detected across a wide range of molecular weights, suggesting that at least some viral and/or cellular proteins within VSV virions are ubiquitinated, although phospholipid anchored ubiquitin (not linked to any protein) has been found in the envelopes of several different viruses [44, 45] . Further studies are needed to determine the functional role of ubiquitin association with VSV virions.",

Importantly, of the 64 proteins, 35 were identified on the basis of only two unique peptides while for other 14 proteins only three unique peptides were identified.

Therefore, it is possible that some of the cellular proteins normally present within viral particles were \"leaked out\" during virus purification from A549 and 4T1 cells (accounting for their absence in those preparations). Furthermore, it is possible that some cellular proteins found in the A549 and 4T1 preparations are associated with free nucleocapsids rather than the virions. These differences in virion properties may have also impacted some of the other assays used in this study. For example, genome isolation may have been more efficient from the A549 and 4T1 samples, perhaps partially accounting for the higher number of genomes detected in these preparations. It may have also had an effect on the proteinase K assay as suggested by the fact that approximately 70% of the supposedly internal viral proteins were degraded when virions isolated from 4T1 cells were treated with proteinase K as opposed to approximately 50% for virions isolated from BHK21 cells.",

We have initiated this process for several proteins of potential interest whose presence in the virion has not previously been shown (Hsp90, actin, annexin 2, and integrin \uf0621), by confirming their presence in our virion preparations by immunoblotting, and, for the non-membrane proteins, confirming their presence within the virion by proteinase K protection assay ( Fig. 3B and data not shown).",

Actin has previously been shown to be incorporated into Sendai [48] , measles [49] and rabies [50] virions but was not detected in VSV virions [50] . Here, using MS, we have shown actin to be present within VSV as well (Table  1 ). Annexins bind phospholipids in a calcium dependent manner and are believed to help direct membrane-membrane and membrane cytoskeleton interactions. In particular, annexin 2 has been proposed to facilitate HIV-1 assembly at cellular membranes [23] . Integrin \uf0621 forms heterodimers with various alpha integrins that function in both cell adhesion and cell signaling. While proteins found in multiple preparations may not be more important than those found only a single sample, the presence of annexin 2 and integrin \uf0621 in all three samples as well as in a number of other viruses (for example, integrin \uf0621 has also been detected in influenza, HIV-1 and Moloney murine leukemia virus), suggests that these two proteins may be involved in widely used viral processes (see far right column of Table 1 for complete listing and references). In fact, many of the cellular proteins identified in our study have been found in association with the virions of different RNA and DNA viruses (Table 1) suggesting that enveloped viruses may use similar cellular pathways for their assembly and exit from the cell. Currently, a similar study using a proteomics approach is being conducted in our laboratory to identify cellular proteins in virions of other members of the family Mononegavirales. Such comparative analysis will reveal how similar or different the cellular content of virions are among different members of this order.",

We have successfully used a proteomic approach to confirm the presence of several cellular proteins within VSV virions and to identify a number of additional proteins likely to also be present within the virions, some of which may play an important role in VSV replication and possibly be involved in previously unconsidered pathways in the virus life cycle. However, we recognize the potential of proteins not associated with virions to persist in our preparations despite purification and that these would also be identified by a global proteomics approach. Additionally, the inclusion of a protein within the virion does not necessarily imply a functional significance. Therefore, future experiments are needed to determine which of the identi-fied proteins interact with VSV and whether these interactions are beneficial, neutral or antiviral with respect to VSV replication. Identification of host proteins-virus interactions beneficial for virus would be particularly exciting as they can provide new ways to combat viral infections via control of host components.",
