In the present study, the mechanism by which the liposome-coupled antigens were cross-presented to CD8 + T cells by APCs was investigated. Confocal laser scanning microscopic analysis demonstrated that antigens coupled to the surface of unsaturated-fatty-acid-based liposomes received processing at both MHC class I and class II compartments, while most of the antigens coupled to the surface of saturated-fatty-acid-based liposomes received processing at the class II compartment. In addition, flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that antigens coupled to the surface of unsaturated-fatty-acid-liposomes were taken up by APCs even in a 4uC environment; this was not true of saturated-fatty-acid-liposomes. When two kinds of inhibitors, dimethylamiloride (DMA) and cytochalasin B, which inhibit pinocytosis and phagocytosis by APCs, respectively, were added to the culture of APCs prior to the antigen pulse, DMA but not cytochalasin B significantly reduced uptake of liposome-coupled antigens. Further analysis of intracellular trafficking of liposomal antigens using confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that a portion of liposome-coupled antigens taken up by APCs were delivered to the lysosome compartment. In agreement with the reduction of antigen uptake by APCs, antigen presentation by APCs was significantly inhibited by DMA, and resulted in the reduction of IFN-c production by antigen-specific CD8 + T cells. These results suggest that antigens coupled to the surface of liposomes consisting of unsaturated fatty acids might be pinocytosed by APCs, loaded onto the class I MHC processing pathway, and presented to CD8 + T cells. Thus, these liposome-coupled antigens are expected to be applicable for the development of vaccines that induce cellular immunity.",

Upon natural infection, it is known that the host responds by inducing both humoral and cellular immunity against the pathogen. However, most of the currently approved vaccines work by inducing humoral immunity [1] [2] [3] . For protection against viruses that are highly mutable and frequently escape from antibodymediated immunity, such as influenza A viruses, HIV, and HCV, humoral immunity is insufficient [4] [5] [6] [7] . Consequently, the development of vaccines that induce cellular immunity is critical to novel vaccine strategies.",

In general, extracellular antigens are presented via MHC class II molecules to CD4 + T cells while intracellular antigens are presented via MHC class I molecules to CD8 + T cells [8, 9] . However, a number of reports have demonstrated that a significant level of crossover, so-called 'cross-presentation', occurs in APCs [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . Using this phenomenon, novel vaccine preparation inducing antigen-specific CTLs that effectively eliminate virus-infected cells is expected. The mechanisms of cross-presentation have been studied intensively [15] [16] [17] while the details have been left unclear. Part of the antigens taken via phagocytosis by APCs are known to be translocated into the cytosol and degraded by local proteases [18, 19] . In another pathway, some antigens internalized into endocytic compartments are loaded onto MHC class I molecules [20] .",

Consequently, most APCs do not present exogenous antigens via MHC class I since exogenous antigens do not gain access to the cytosolic compartment. Therefore, exogenous antigens usually do not prime CTL responses in vivo. This segregation of exogenous antigens from the class I pathway is important to prevent CTL from killing healthy cells that have been exposed to foreign antigens but are not infected [26] . However, there are several exceptions to this rule, reflecting the ability of the exogenous antigens to be delivered into the cytosolic compartments [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] .",

            "text": "We have previously reported that antigens coupled to the surface of liposomes comprised of unsaturated fatty acid are presented to both CD4 + -and CD8 + T cells [23] . Confocal laser scanning microscopic analysis demonstrated that a portion of the liposome-coupled antigens were taken up and processed beyond the MHC class II compartment. In the present study, we confirmed that OVA coupled to oleoyl liposomes was processed at both the MHC class I and class II compartments ( Fig. 1 ). Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that OVA coupled to oleoyl liposomes was incorporated more efficiently by macrophages than OVA coupled to stearoyl liposomes (Fig. 2) . Furthermore, OVA coupled to oleoyl liposomes was taken up by macrophages even in a 4uC environment, in which antigen entry could only occur via plasma membrane translocation. In general, antigen processing pathways largely depend on the route of antigen uptake, and liposomes with a certain lipid component are known to fuse with the plasma membrane [27] . The uptake of OVA coupled to oleoyl liposomes in a 4uC environment observed in the present study suggested that oleoyl liposome might fuse with the plasma membrane and thereby allow the liposome-coupled antigen direct access to the cytosol. The role of endocytosis in the uptake of the liposomal antigen was further examined by using specific inhibitors for antigen uptake (Fig. 3) . Cytochalasin B treatment of APCs prior to the addition of liposomal antigen in the culture had little effect. However, treatment of APCs with DMA significantly reduced the uptake of liposome-coupled OVA. Consequently, it was suggested that antigens coupled to oleoyl liposomes might be taken up by APCs via at least two pathways, penetration and pinocytosis. The analysis of intracellular pathways of antigens coupled to oleoyl liposomes using confocal laser scanning microscopy demonstrated that a portion of liposomal antigens taken up by APC were translocated to the lysosomal compartments expressing LAMP-1 (Fig. 4) , suggesting that the liposomal antigens processed at lysosomal compartment and beyond lysosomal compartment might be presented to CD4/ CD8 + T cells via MHC class II and class I, respectively. In agreement with the results of antigen uptake shown in Fig. 3 , the treatment of splenic CD11c + cells with DMA significantly reduced antigen presentation of liposomal antigens to both CD4 + -and CD8 + T cells as evaluated by T-cell activation (Fig. 5) .",

The PCR product was cloned into the CMV promoter-driven expression plasmid pDsRedN1 (BD Clontech). This construct omitted the stop codon of H2-DMb2 and encoded the H2-DMb2 fused with DsRed. The cloned plasmid DNA was transfected to macrophage hybridoma clone 39 with Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. During the transfection to clone 39, the medium containing cDNA and the transfection reagent was replaced with fresh medium after an 8-h transfection, and then clone 39 was cultured for 40 h. To obtain stable cell lines, clone 39 was passaged at 1:5 into RPMI 1640 containing 10% FCS with 50 mg/ml geneticin (G-418; Sigma-Aldrich). Cells showing the best fluorescence were selected using a FACS Vantage cell sorter (BD Bioscience). After cell sorting, clone 39 expressing DM-DsRed was cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FCS with 200 mg/ml geneticin.",
