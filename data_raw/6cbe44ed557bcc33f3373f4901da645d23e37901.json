Studies were evaluated using the Ekman quality assessment tool, and data were extracted with an original extraction form. Sixty-one studies were included. There are many types and methods of health emergency management assessment in China, and the dimensions and the indicators involved are complex. Legal, regulatory, and policy bases for such assessment need to be further strengthened. The relevance of the entire assessment process and its practical application should be enhanced. In the occupational practice, appropriate evaluation methods should be selected according to respective evaluation purposes, evaluation objects, and contents. Laws, regulations, and policies in the evaluation of health emergency management should be improved. Finally, further correlational research on health emergency management evaluation system processes should be explored and improved.",

In general, the dimensions of health emergency assessment are mostly second-level dimensions. The assessment indicators mainly include management capabilities, improvement capabilities, drill capabilities, and reporting capabilities. For purposes of this research, a \"dimension\" refers to the content of public health emergency management features of the institution, such as health emergency response dimension, and \"indicator\" is used to refer to evaluation features, including emergency command coordination mechanism. After the establishment of the National Emergency Management Department, it was necessary to pay attention to the differences and the connections between the health emergency and the national emergency laws and policies. It is necessary to improve the relevance of the entire process of the health emergency management assessment system. The practical application of the health emergency management assessment system also should focus on the application of health supervision agencies, schools, and other institutions. China includes a vast territory, a substantial population, and diverse regional cultures. In May 2005, the 58 th World Health Assembly (WHA) adopted International Health Regulations [2005] (hereinafter \"IHR\" or \"the Regulations\"), which were subsequently implemented on 15 June 2007. All state parties are required by the IHR to develop certain minimum core public health capacities. The development of China's health emergency research has played an important role in promoting the development of global health emergency systems. Systematic evaluation as a method produces high-quality evidence, and its application in the collection and the production of scientific evidence in health emergency management assessment research serves to effectively guarantee the quality of research results, providing a scientific reference for researchers and policymakers. This study analyzes the characteristics of health emergency management assessment indicators using a qualitative system evaluation to appraise the current status of assessment in China as well as to provide evidence-based research for global health emergency policy development.",

More public health emergencies such as the H1N1 flu epidemic in 2009 and the H7N9 avian flu epidemic in 2013 had serious impacts on China's politics, economy, trade, and people's health, among others. Theory and implementation of health emergency systems have evolved worldwide. China has gradually implemented the construction of a comprehensive emergency management system including the use of theoretical models, assessment systems, and response studies. China's health emergency management system is an important component of the comprehensive emergency management system, and health emergency management assessment is an important part of the health emergency management system. China's health emergency management assessment system has experienced many rigorous tests in response to a series of public health emergencies and has accumulated experience in detecting health emergencies and managing the weaknesses of the evaluation system. There are many types of health emergency management assessments and many methods for health emergency management assessment in China, and the dimensions and the indicators of health emergency management assessment are complex. For example, the evaluation system named the \"Disease control agency health emergency capacity evaluation index\" has three dimensions, the system known as the \"Evaluation",

Research clearly indicates that there are a multitude of assessments in China. First, assessments are divided according to purpose, i.e., formative and summative assessments. For example, the evaluation of Yunnan Province's emergency health response capability and core competence assessment index system at district-level control institutions was performed to guide and advance the progress of assessment targets as well as to provide a formative evaluation of management decisions. On the other hand, in Fujian Province, the study is concerned with the state of performance appraisals regarding public health emergencies and other issues, including formulating (such as plan completion rate, emergency material reserve rate, simulation exercises) overall judgments on the purposes of evaluation institutions, including accountability and summative assessment. Second, health emergency management assessment is divided into several stages, including the preparation stage (i.e., pre-emergency evaluation), the disposal stage, the in-process evaluation, and the recovery stage (i.e., post-emergency evaluation). Thus, a preliminary discussion on the early warning index system for influenza outbreaks, the construction of an evaluation index system for hospital nurses' public health emergency response capacity, a weighted analysis of emergency public health emergency response evaluation factors, and the evaluation of emergency drill activities in county-level disease control institutions in Nanchang City are all examples of pre-assessment. In contrast, social vulnerability assessments and analyses of significant factors associated with major infectious diseases are concerned with the assessment of the nature, the type, the extent, and the determining factors of public health emergencies, while epidemiological characteristics studies and normative disposal third-party assessments are all considered post-event assessments that focus on recovery, summarizing, and long-term impact. Third, emergency management work assessment can be divided according to health status, i.e., normal and abnormal assessment. For example, the analysis and the evaluation of the present state of affairs of health emergency work in Qinghai Province was a normal assessment of the state of daily management construction, whereas the comprehensive evaluation of public health emergency implementation in the Fujian Province in 2014 was an assessment of the process and the impact of the emergency response. Fourth, assessment is divided according to the evaluation implementation body, i.e., internal and external evaluation. For example, the evaluation of the public health emergency response capacity of F hospital in Qiqihar City was an internal investigation conducted by an investigation team composed of health emergency management agencies and workers. On the other hand, investigating the epidemiological characteristics of public health emergencies and standard treatment third-party assessments are surveys that involve external evaluation from experts outside the health emergency management and work organization.",

Qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods are most commonly used. This review found that the construction of a health emergency management evaluation system is more of a qualitative approach and is appropriately categorized as exploratory research (e.g., literature review, personal interview, Delphi, brainstorming, expert group discussion, expert meeting business law, field inspection). Some studies focus on data collection, detailing the main laws and characteristics by using descriptive methods. The health emergency management evaluation system weight analysis and application falls more in the domain of the Delphi method, while analytic hierarchy process, entropy weight, rank sum ratio, fuzzy comprehensive evaluation, and matter-element extension methods are relatively new methods for health emergency assessment. The application of the health emergency management evaluation involves possibly utilizing questionnaire surveys, factor analysis, principal component analysis, comprehensive scoring, comprehensive indexes, and analytic hierarchy process methods. Recently, scholars have started to pay attention to health emergency resource allocation research using data envelopment analysis methods. Health emergency management systems are extremely complex and large, as they are concerned with numerous variables and complicated mechanisms and structures.",

This review found that the assessment dimensions predominantly included national and local state health administrative departments' normal emergency management and abnormal emergency command organization management. Assessment dimensions were also concerned with health emergency professional technical institutions, including health emergency level disease prevention and control institutions, professional disposal management, personnel management, materials management, information management, fund management, etc., at various levels of health institutions. Moreover, health emergency assessment indicators are embodied in the duties and the authority of the state in the management of normal/abnormal emergencies, duties of professional technical institutions, classifications and responsibilities of technical and health emergency personnel, emergency materials categories and management methods, information monitoring, source, report, confidentiality, and supervision, and aspects of health emergency fund sources to support policy and supervision.",

Merely building a health emergency assessment system cannot meet the needs to form a comprehensive emergency system, nor can it identify the weaknesses in management efficiently.

Foreign health emergency management assessment related research is carried out earlier and applied in practice. The research on China's health emergency management assessment has been carried out late, the evaluation system is flawed, the evaluation criteria are not standardized, the evaluation model is unstable, and the assessment of health emergency management processes lacks attention. A first step in improving the situation is to enhance the relevance of the process of health emergency management assessment. For more than ten years, the health emergency management assessment has prioritized the evaluation of staged and key management work. At present, there is still a lack of research across all processes related to the health emergency management evaluation system. Second, the process of the health emergency management evaluation system is weak. Previous research on a health emergency management assessment system typically targeted certain types of public health emergencies and lacked the exploration of health emergency management assessment systems based on the commonality of multiple types of public health emergencies. Third, the application of a health emergency management assessment system is not strong. The content and the objectives of the previous health emergency management assessment systems are relatively scattered, lack organic integration of the assessment process, and create a state of under-applied appraisal.",

China should emphasize research and application of health emergency assessment in central and western regions, including ethnic minority areas, and the health emergency assessment system should be improved from the perspective of classification and integration of health emergency assessment subjects, as health emergency management assessment is an important part of the health emergency management activities. Through evaluation, problems in health emergency management can eventually be found, and the effective prevention and control of public health emergencies can be achieved to the greatest extent possible.
