            "text": ". Statistical results show comparisons between sex within animal source (i.e. laboratory or wild mice), and between animal source. Where there exists a significant difference between sex, mice were grouped by sex and animal source as: laboratory female, laboratory male, wild female and wild male (LF, LM, WF, WM, respectively), with Kruskal-Wallis H-tests (and post-hoc, Dunn-Bonferonni, pairwise comparisons) conducted with significant differences reported. All non-normal data were analysed by Mann-Whitney U-tests, unless stated otherwise. Asterisks denote significant differences as * P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01, *** P < 0.001. Superscripts define cell populations as a percentage of: 1 spleen cells; 2 CD3 + cells; 3 CD4 + cells; 4 CD8 + Median intensity for nematode and mite infection only. ",
