            "text": "Background: Stably expressed reference gene(s) normalization is important for the understanding of gene expression patterns by quantitative Real-time PCR (RT-qPCR), particularly for Rice stripe virus (RSV) and Rice black streaked dwarf virus (RBSDV) that caused seriously damage on rice plants in China and Southeast Asia. Methods: The expression of fourteen common used reference genes of Oryza sativa L. were evaluated by RT-qPCR in RSV and RBSDV infected rice plants. Suitable normalization reference gene(s) were identified by geNorm and NormFinder algorithms. Results: UBQ 10 + GAPDH and UBC + Actin1 were identified as suitable reference genes for RT-qPCR normalization under RSV and RBSDV infection, respectively. When using multiple reference genes, the expression patterns of OsPRIb and OsWRKY, two virus resistance genes, were approximately similar with that reported previously. Comparatively, by using single reference gene (TIP41-Like), a weaker inducible response was observed. Conclusions: We proposed that the combination of two reference genes could obtain more accurate and reliable normalization of RT-qPCR results in RSV-and RBSDV-infected plants. This work therefore sheds light on establishing a standardized RT-qPCR procedure in RSV-and RBSDV-infected rice plants, and might serve as an important point for discovering complex regulatory networks and identifying genes relevant to biological processes or implicated in virus.",

            "text": "Rice viral diseases are major threats to rice production and have been distributed worldwide across regions depending on rice cultivation [1] . Two of the most prevalent rice viruses are RSV and RBSDV, which were transmitted by a small brown planthopper (SBPH, Laodelphax striatellus Fallen) [2] [3] [4] . When infected with RSV at the seedling stage, normally, rice plants grow poorly and often develop folded and twisted leaves, with the central leaves yellowing and withering; and plant growth may terminate and ultimately the plant will die [5] [6] [7] . In China, rice stripe is very serious, especially in Jiangsu province, where about 0.6 M ha per year of rice were infected by RSV during the period of 2000 to 2003, increasing to 1 M ha in 2004. In heavily infected fields, rice yield is reduced by 30-50 %, and in some of the most severely infected fields, no harvest is possible [8] . In RBSDV infected rice always develops stunted stems, dark green, twisted leaves, and white waxy swellings along veins on the abaxial surface of the leaves [3, 9, 10] . The disease caused severely damage on rice in most parts of eastern China with due to widespread release of susceptible cultivars. Since the infection damage was very severe in China and Southeast Asia, the understanding of the responses of rice to viral infection, especially gene expression analysis, is very important for developing strategies for disease control [8, 11] .",

Besides being a powerful tool, RT-qPCR suffers from certain pitfalls, most important being the normalization with a reference gene [15] [16] [17] . In recent years, the reference genes, such as those encoding actin (Actin), tubulin (TUB), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and 18S rRNA, are often separately chosen for the normalization in RT-qPCR because of their constant expression levels in living organisms [16] . Nevertheless, different studies sometimes proved different or even opposing results of these reference genes, and it was demonstrated that the transcript levels of these genes actually vary under different experimental conditions [18] [19] [20] [21] . For example, different expression levels normalized by a different reference gene could be approximately 100 folds [22] . Furthermore, Myzus persicae's actin and GAPDH protein were found to interaction with Beet western yellows virus in vitro [23] and some A.pisumwere's genes (Actin and GAPDH) considered to be potentially related to the transmission of Peaenation mosaic virus and Soybean dwarf virus [24] . Thus, it is important and necessary to select suitable reference gene(s) for different experimental paradigms, particularly in RSV and RBSDV infection conditions which those appropriate internal reference(s) were not identified [25] [26] [27] .",

Although V 4/5 values were much lower than that of V 3/4 and even lower values were obtained by adding more reference genes, considering practical applications, two reference genes was optimal in our experimental conditions. Different algorithm methods sometimes may produce different results from the same data set. Hence, all of the data were reassessed by NormFinder to avoid introducing unnecessary bias. NormFinder is a mathematical model which performs separate analysis of sample subgroups. It estimates intra-and inter-group variations and combines both results into a consistent value for each investigated gene [29] . Interestingly, we found that the ranking generated by this approach (Fig. 5) was approximately similar with those determined by geNorm ( Fig. 4a and b) . UBC and 18S rRNA were sill ranked higher than other reference genes in RSV-infected samples. In the RBSDV-infected samples, \u03b2-TUB and TIP41-Like were also ranking the highest. Although in RSV-infected samples, the rank order of EXP and GAPDH were slightly altered in NormFinder analysis in comparison with those in geNorm analyses, the stability of UBQ 10 + GAPDH was high enough for reliable normalization compared to those of UBC and 18S rRNA. Also, the similar result was obtained in the RBSDVtreated samples, showing that Actin1 + UBC were suitable for normalization in RT-qPCR analysis.",

As BestKeeper cannot test more than 10 candidates, it was not used in this study. By using geNorm and NormFinder, algorithms, 14 reference genes (Table 1) were evaluated. Our findings revealed that UBQ 10 and GAPDH were overall the most stable genes in RSV-infected rice (Figs. 4a and 5a) , and Actin1 and UBC ranked the best candidate genes under RBSDV infection (Figs. 4b and 5b) . Interestingly, the suitable reference genes for RSV-and RBSDV-infected rice plants were different, it is indicated that the expression of the reference genes can vary under given situations [21] . Therefore, it is vital to choose suitable reference gene(s) for normalization of gene expression. Moreno et al. [41] showed that in different Cassava brown streak virus (CBSV)-infected tissues, PP2A, UBQ10 and GTPb appeared to be the most stable genes. In infected tomato plants, GAPDH and UBQ indicated as the most appropriate internal standards both in leaves and root tissues, and Actin was also stably expressed in the infected plants [42] . When infected with four commonly known tomato viral pathogens, ACT, CAC and EF1-\u03b1 were considered as the most suitable reference genes in the studies of host-virus interactions [43] . Therefore, the selected multiple reference genes (UBQ 10 + GAPDH for RSV, and UBC + Actin1 for RBSDV) could be used for the normalization of gene expression pattern in RSV-and RBSDV-infected rice plants.",

In our study, the performance of above two genes was dissatisfactory. These were similar to the earlier studies in Cicer arietinum and [42, 46] . Thus, the two traditional reference genes might not be the optimal choices for quantitating transcript level in rice during RSV-and RBSDV-infection. Meanwhile, TUB was widely used as reference gene for gene expression analysis. However, due to the potential regulation in various physiological states, the suitability as internal control has been questioned [45, 47] . In our experimental conditions, \u03b1-TUB and \u03b2-TUB (in particularly) were not stable either, especially in RBSDV-infected plants.

Viruliferous or virus-free SBPHs were reared on rice seedlings (Oryza sativa L. cv. Wuyujing No. 3) in glass vessels at 22\u00b0C under alternating photoperiods of 14 h of light and 10 h of dark. 14-day-old seedlings were inoculated with 10 viruliferous nymphs per plant and were kept in a growth chamber. After the incubation for 3 days, planthoppers were removed and plants were transferred to field. Virus-free SBPHs were also used for control inoculation.
