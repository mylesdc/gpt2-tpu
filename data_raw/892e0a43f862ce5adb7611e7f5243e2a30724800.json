Each year, Saudi Arabia attracts over 2 million pilgrims from over 180 countries, including about 2,000 from Marseille, France 1 . The Hajj presents major challenges in public health and infection control as the crowding conditions favor the acquisition, dissemination and transmission of pathogenic microorganisms 2 . Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are particularly frequent during the pilgrimage and are responsible for most causes of hospitalization, with community-acquired pneumonia being a major cause of serious illness among pilgrims 3 . Many studies have been conducted among Hajj pilgrims over the last decade, demonstrating the high prevalence of respiratory symptoms and the frequent acquisition of respiratory pathogens 3-7 . The viruses most commonly acquired after the Hajj are human rhinovirus (HRV), human coronaviruses (HCoV) and influenza A virus (IAV). The most frequently acquired respiratory bacteria are Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae), Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Haemophilus influenzae (H. influenzae) 3 . However, the etiology of RTIs at the Hajj is likely multifactorial and complex. The potential effects of vaccination against influenza and pneumococcus 8,9 , of non-pharmaceutical preventive measures including face-mask use and hand hygiene practice 10-12 have been investigated, mostly based on clinical criteria, but results of studies are contradictory.",

We have no explanation for this unexpected observation. Older age (\u226560 www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ years) was associated with the acquisition of influenza viruses, HCoV and S. pneumoniae. Although older age was not correlated with the increase in the proportion of respiratory symptoms in our study, our results support the current French recommendations that indicate influenza vaccination for all pilgrims and IPD vaccination for pilgrims aged \u226560 years old (or with chronic conditions) 24, 25 . Furthermore, we showed that influenza vaccination was significantly associated with a lower prevalence of ILI in our survey. Similarly, in a meta-analysis, Alfelali et al. have shown that, influenza vaccine decreases the prevalence of ILI 26 . We also demonstrate here that vaccination against IPD with a decrease in the acquisition of S. pneumoniae, but had no effect on respiratory symptoms. A protective effect of pneumococcal vaccination against S. pneumoniae post-Hajj carriage was observed in only one out of 5 studies so far 9 . However, all studies showing no effect of pneumococcal vaccination were conducted on small groups of pilgrims (ranging 55 to 107 individuals), while in the two studies showing a protective effect, the number of pilgrims was much higher (1178 and 468) which may indicate that small surveys lacked statistical power. Finally, as expected, patients suffering from chronic respiratory diseases were more likely to suffer from cough and ILI but also to acquire H. influenzae. Our results confirm the need for influenza and IPD vaccination among the identified pilgrim populations at risk of RTIs and acquisition of respiratory pathogens. Vaccination rates in our cohort were clearly sub-optimal: 26.7% of pilgrims were vaccinated against influenza and 30.5% against IPD among those with an indication.",

We found that there was a higher prevalence of ILI and rhinovirus acquisition among pilgrims who reported wearing face masks. Similarly, a higher prevalence of cough was observed among pilgrims who reported using disposable handkerchiefs. It is likely that such results indicate the higher willingness of symptomatic pilgrims to wear a face mask and use disposable handkerchiefs, with the aim of avoiding spreading diseases. In addition, the use of disposable handkerchiefs appears to be correlated with a decrease in the www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ acquisition of S. aureus carriage, which may reflect a better elimination of organisms by cleaning the nasopharynx. We found that increased hand hygiene was not associated with reduced respiratory pathogens acquisition or a lower prevalence of respiratory symptoms.

Potential adult participants were recruited at a private specialized travel agency from Marseille, France, organizing journeys to Mecca, Saudi Arabia and invited to participate in the study. They were included and followed-up by a medical bilingual (Arabic and French) doctor who traveled with the group. Upon inclusion before departing from France, the pilgrims were interviewed using a standardized pre-Hajj questionnaire that collected items about demographic characteristics (age, sex, place of birth), immunization status (vaccination against influenza and IPD) and medical history (chronic medical conditions, immunodeficiency, body mass index (BMI)). Pilgrims were considered to have been vaccinated immunized against influenza when they had been vaccinated within the last year, but before 10 days of the date of travel. Pilgrims were considered immune to IPD when they had been vaccinated with the 13-valent conjugate pneumococcal vaccine (PCV-13) in the past 5 years [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . Clinical events occurring during the travel (type of respiratory symptoms, date of onset, duration of symptoms, antibiotic treatment provided) and persistence of respiratory symptoms at return were collected by a medical doctor using a post-Hajj questionnaire at 2 days before the pilgrims' return to France. The information on compliance with face masks use as well as hand washing, use of hand gel disinfectant and disposable handkerchiefs was documented. Ill pilgrims, who spontaneously consulted the accompanying medical doctor at the time of onset during the Hajj, underwent a complementary nasopharyngeal swab (per-Hajj specimens). ILI was defined as the presence of cough, sore throat and subjective fever 40 . Based on the WHO classification, underweight was define as a BMI below 18.5, normal with a BMI from 18.5 to less than 25, overweight with a BMI greater \u226525 and obesity with a BMI greater \u226530 41 .",

STATA software version 11.1 (Copyright 2009 StataCorp LP, http://www.stata.com) was used for statistical analysis. Differences in the proportions were tested by Pearson's chi-square or Fisher's exact tests when appropriate. In order to evaluate the potential acquisition of respiratory pathogens in Saudi Arabia, we used the McNemar's Test to compare their prevalence before leaving France and in Saudi Arabia (during and after the Hajj). Unadjusted associations between multiple factors and prevalence of respiratory pathogen acquisition and prevalence of respiratory symptom during the Hajj were examined by univariable analysis. The results were presented by percentages and risk ratio with 95% confidence interval (95%CI). Results with a p value \u22640.05 was considered statistically significant. Only the variables with a prevalence \u22655.0% were considered for statistical analysis. Variables with p values <0.2 in the univariable analysis were included in the multivariable analysis. Log-binomial regression was used to estimate factor's adjusted risk ratios regarding respiratory symptoms and respiratory pathogens acquisition 43 .",
