            "text": "To better understand the systemic response to naturally acquired acute respiratory viral infections, we prospectively enrolled 1610 healthy adults in 2009 and 2010. Of these, 142 subjects were followed for detailed evaluation of acute viral respiratory illness. We examined peripheral blood gene expression at 7 timepoints: enrollment, 5 illness visits and the end of each year of the study. 133 completed all study visits and yielded technically adequate peripheral blood microarray gene expression data. Seventy-three (55%) had an influenza virus infection, 64 influenza A and 9 influenza B. The remaining subjects had a rhinovirus infection (N = 32), other viral infections (N = 4), or no viral agent identified (N = 24). The results, which were replicated between two seasons, showed a dramatic upregulation of interferon pathway and innate immunity genes. This persisted for 2-4 days. The data show a recovery phase at days 4 and 6 with differentially expressed transcripts implicated in cell proliferation and repair. By day 21 the gene expression pattern was indistinguishable from baseline (enrollment). Influenza virus infection induced a higher magnitude and longer duration of the shared expression signature of illness compared to the other viral infections. Using lineage and activation state-specific transcripts to produce cell composition scores, patterns of B and T lymphocyte depressions accompanied by a major activation of NK cells were detected in the acute phase of illness. The data also demonstrate multiple dynamic gene modules that are reorganized and strengthened following infection. Finally, we examined pre-and post-infection anti-influenza antibody titers defining novel gene expression correlates.",

            "text": "Influenza viruses are highly contagious respiratory pathogens that cause about three to five million cases of severe illness, and about 250 000 to 500 000 deaths worldwide each year [1] . In the US, influenza affects an estimated 5% to 20% of the population yearly [2] , and is responsible for an average of 3.1 million hospitalized days, and 31.4 million outpatient visits. Direct medical costs are estimated to be at least $10.4 billion annually [3] . A new influenza virus appeared in Mexico and the United States in April 2009 and caused extensive outbreaks of influenza in the population. The virus was promptly identified as a swine-like influenza A (H1N1) virus and shown to be a triple reassortant virus containing genes from swine, human, and avian influenza A viruses [4] . Pandemic swine influenza (pH1N1) peaked in the United States in October 2009, with minimal activity during the subsequent winter period of influenza and reappeared during the winter of 2010-2011. Our recent studies showed that preexisting antibody to the seasonal A/H1N1 virus reduced pH1N1 influenza virus infection and illness in healthy young adults [5, 6] .",

Many aspects of host-pathogen interactions after influenza infection have been studied [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . Blood transcriptome profiling provides a 'snap shot' of the systematic host immune networks, as blood circulates throughout the body, carrying naive and educated immune cells, whose transcriptional activity can be influenced by environmental stimuli such as a respiratory virus illness [13] . Transcriptional signatures have been described in the context of ARIs caused by different etiological agents, including influenza, rhinovirus (HRV), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), as well as by influenza vaccination [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . These studies have shown that blood gene expression signatures are distinctive for individuals with infection-induced ARI. ARI gene expression signatures show highly significant enrichment for transcripts encoding proteins involved in interferon signaling and pattern recognition induced innate immunity responses [14, 16] .",

In previously reported studies in humans with ARI, transcriptional profiling was only performed on RNA samples collected either at a single timepoint of peak symptoms, or within the initial 2 to 3 days of hospitalization. The dynamic changes over the entire time course of naturally acquired infection and illness in humans are less clear. Experimentally induced influenza infection has been used to obtain information about changes in temporal gene expression [14, 21] . Huang et al made important observations about the differences in response between asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals. These studies, however, were limited by sample size and could not contrast other common respiratory virus agents with influenza. Menachery et al reported a contrasting gene signature between pH1N1 and coronavirus infected airway epithelial cells [22] . The genes they investigated were limited to interferon-stimulated genes. Studies to characterize the temporal dynamics of the systemic transcriptional response to ARI in humans are necessary to better understand the biology of infection, the host response and occurrence of disease. Furthermore, serum antibody responses to influenza virus infection have large interindividual variation [5, 6] . Several influenza vaccine studies showed genes that play a role in antigen presentation and T cell recognition are associated with influenza vaccine-induced antibodies [19, [23] [24] [25] . Whether the same sets of genes contribute to the variation in antibody response to naturally acquired influenza infection is not known.",

Since the probability for multiple transcripts to follow a complex pattern of expression across all the samples by chance is low, such sets of genes should constitute coherent and biologically meaningful transcriptional units [29, 30] . Recently developed differential co-expression analysis goes beyond identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) or pathways to identify differential co-expression pattern [31] [32] [33] .

Samples which failed QC were excluded from the analyses (N = 10), leaving 880 high quality arrays from which the subsequent analysis was conducted. Differential expression analyses for each day, compared to the baseline were then stratified by viral agent. We first analyzed the gene expression profiles in 49 subjects from whom an influenza virus infection was identified. The 24 subjects with influenza A virus infection in the 2009 cohort were used as a discovery group, and the consistency of differential expressed genes was assessed in another 21 influenza A virus infected subjects and 4 influenza B virus infected subjects in the 2010 cohort as a validation group. After performing significance testing with corrections for multiple tests, we detected highly significant expression differences in thousands of transcripts during the period of influenza illness (days 0, 2, 4, 6) in both discovery and validation groups. In contrast, once the subject had clinically recovered there were no significant expression differences detected (day 21, and spring samples).",

To \"deconvolute\" these two phenomena, we computed a cell score derived from the expression profile of each sample using a composite of lymphocyte, neutrophil or monocyte specific transcripts. We found that lymphocyte lineagespecific transcripts were depressed in the acute phase of influenza virus infection, increased above baseline in the recovery phase, and then returned to baseline on day 21 (Fig 2A) . An opposite change in neutrophil score was observed ( Fig 2B) . Expression levels of monocyte markers were increased in the acute phase and returned to baseline on day 6 ( Fig 2C) . These changes in established lineage markers of the broad cell populations probably track the changes in cell composition in the peripheral blood. The changes in lymphocyte and neutrophil proportions we predicted \"in silico\" are consistent with the changes described in [34, 35] . Changes in lineage composition could explain part of the differential gene expression observed during the infection. We therefore recomputed the differential expression analysis using the lymphocyte and neutrophil scores as covariates in a series of contrasts focusing on days 0 to day 6 compared to baseline. Although the p-values were slightly increased, the rank ordering of genes showing highly specific differential expression was nearly identical (Tables 2-5). This indicates that while cell composition does affect estimates of total transcript abundance, the most important component of the differential expression arises from changes in transcript abundance within those populations. On a global scale, changes in the host transcriptomes were observed from the first day of illness through day 6 evaluations.

These genes fall into two clusters: 1) genes that were regulated in the acute phase of influenza virus infection, and 2) genes that became differentially expressed at a later time-point (recovery phase). All individuals showed complete recovery to the baseline transcript profile by day 21 after onset of illness. In the acute phase, there was a very large increase in components of the interferon pathway and innate immunity (e.g. IFI44L, IFIT1, MX1, IFITM3, OAS2, IFI27 and IFIT3, see Table 2 ), as well as decreased expression of genes involved in translational elongation and protein biosynthesis (e.g. RPS4X, RPS18, RPS6, RPS8 and RPL5, see Table 3 ). This was most intense on the first day of illness and continued for 2-4 days. This phase was followed by a characteristic recovery phase in which there was a transition to genes involved in antigen binding and antibody secretion (IGJ, LOC652694, IGLL1 and MZB1, see Table 4 ) and genes regulating cell morphogenesis (STRADB, DPYSL5, EPB42, LST1 and MAP1S, see Table 5 ). Inter-individual variations in the magnitude of transcriptional response at each phase were observed (S2 Fig) , and greater variations were seen at the times when the transcriptional responses were strong. The expression profiles for individuals infected with Influenza A and B virus were indistinguishable. Likewise individuals infected with both influenza and rhinovirus were not different from those infected with influenza virus alone. No statistically significant differences in expression of any transcripts were identified that marked the mixed infection group.",

This indicates that the host response to acute respiratory viral infection, despite the distinctive biology of these diverse viruses, is largely conserved. By performing differential expression analysis comparing influenza virus and rhinovirus infection group (Criteria for DEGs were BH-corrected P values < 0.0001), we found that comparing to rhinovirus, influenza virus infection and illnesses induced a larger magnitude and longer duration of activation of interferon signaling pathway, and a greater depression in translation and protein biosynthesis (S4A and S4B Fig, S2 Table) . Some of the DEGs encode kinase or kinase inhibitor (e.g. MAPK1, PAK2, CDKN1A and CDKN1B, S4C Fig) . Several protein phosphatase encoding genes were also differentially expressed, such as PPM1M, PPP2R4, PPP3CA, etc. However, the magnitudes of differential expression in these genes were small and there were only two transcripts showed |log 2 fold-change| >1.5: IFI27 was consistently upregulated in the influenza virus group on days 0-6 but not upregulated in the rhinovirus or other infection groups ( Fig 2F) ; in addition, PI3 was consistently downregulated in the influenza-infected individuals but not in the other groups ( Fig 2G) . The fold changes of IFI27 and PI3 transcript levels comparing the first day of illness with baseline were also measured by RT-qPCR, and were consistent with the microarray result (S5 Fig) .",

The changes in the expression levels are likely influenced by both the proportion of the cells in the peripheral blood as well as the transcriptional state of those cells. In the acute phase of infection there was a slight depression of lineage markers for NK cells, followed by upregulation of the marker gene GPR56 on day 2 that became stable by day 21 and thereafter ( Fig  3A) . The same procedure was used to compute a score for the activation status. Notably, NK cells showed very dramatic increases in activation state during the acute infection but then the activation signature rapidly resolves in the convalescent phase as the infection subsided ( Fig  3B) . The changes observed in the 2009 cohort were replicated in the 2010 cohort. Our findings of the dramatic activation of NK cells during the early phase are consistent with the observations from influenza-infected mouse lungs [20] .

Analyses of significant differentially expressed genes on day 0 and day 2 (BH-corrected P value <0.05 in both discovery and validation cohorts) revealed that the upregulated genes were mostly enriched in defense response, response to other organism, response to virus, innate immune response, positive regulation of cytokine production, and positive regulation of tumor necrosis factor production ( Fig 4A) , while the downregulated genes were involved in translational elongation, translation, cellular protein metabolic process, rRNA binding, and cellular macromolecule biosynthetic process (Fig 4B) . The functional interpretation of differentially expressed genes in the recovery phase (day 4 and 6) is much less clear: there are a range of protein metabolic process and regulation of ubiquitin-protein ligase activity functions represented in the upregulated genes (Fig 4A) , and actin cytoskeleton organization functions associated with the downregulated genes ( Fig 4B) , but how these changes may be integrated will require further investigation.

Cellular processes such as dendritic cell maturation and crosstalk between dendritic cells and NK cells were also enriched, indicating the activation of these pathways in acute influenza. On the other hand, the downregulated genes were significantly enriched for pathways related to gene translation and cell proliferation, such as EIF2 signaling, regulation of eIF4 and p70S6K signaling and mTOR signaling. A group of pathways distinct from those seen in the acute phase were enriched in DEGs in the recovery phase (S6B Fig). A large number of upregulated genes in the recovery phase were functioning in the protein ubiquitination pathway. Stress response pathways (e.g. hypoxia signaling in the cardiovascular system and NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response) were also enriched. In addition, significant enrichment in multiple growth factor signaling pathways (e.g. GM-CSF signaling, HGF signaling and PDGF signaling) and cell cycle regulation (e.g. mitotic roles of polo-like kinase) were observed.",

Genes in module Day 0_2 are enriched for translational elongation, the majority of the transcripts in this module are downregulated on day 0 but the transcript levels then gradually increased and became above baseline on day 4 (Fig 5B) , suggesting the host translation system was attenuated in the acute phase of influenza but then recovered during the later phase.",

We found that the correlations between gene expression levels of all the gene pairs are higher on day 0 compared to baseline (Fig 6A) . Particularly, the modules 1 in the lower left corner have significant correlation differences between day 0 and baseline, suggesting that the module genes are in the same regulatory network.

We computed the correlation coefficients among all gene pairs and plotted the results as a function of the magnitude of correlation or connectivity ( Fig  6C) . The co-expression patterns among these genes peaked on the first day of illness, gradually weakened thereafter, and become indistinguishable with baseline by day 21.

The Day 0 transcript levels of 2119 DEGs were tested for their correlation with the delta antibody titers among 58 ill subjects with H1N1 infection.

Transcriptional profiles for ill subjects were examined at 7 time points, including baseline, the first day of illness and up to 21 days after as well as after the influenza season. The aim of this study was to use an unbiased genome-wide approach to identify genes whose expression is regulated by occurrence of an ARI and networks that are activated in the host response to infectious stimuli during different stages of an acute respiratory viral illness. The results show a gene expression signature that strongly corresponds to influenza virus infection. Components of interferon pathway and innate immunity (IFI44L, IFITM3, MX1, IRF7, OAS2, STAT2, etc.) are significantly upregulated in the acute phase of infection, while the expression levels of genes involved in translational elongation and protein biosynthesis are decreased. Other researchers have identified host gene expression patterns that are associated with viral infection in human airway epithelial cells [17] and bronchial epithelial cells [28] . DEGs in type I interferon or STAT1 signaling were similar to those found in our current study. In particular, IFI27, an antiviral molecule that regulates interferon-mediated apoptosis, was the most highly up-regulated gene in these studies [14, 17] . Our study identified IFI27 and PI3 as the most differentially expressed genes comparing influenza virus and rhinovirus infections. IFI27 up-regulation was observed in hospitalized infants with RSV bronchiolitis [36] , yet it was not seen in the three healthy adults infected with RSV in our study. PI3 (peptidase inhibitor 3) encodes elafin, a potent neutrophil elastase inhibitor, localized to the injury sites in the lung [37] . PI3 protein was shown to possess antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities [38] . Its mechanism of action is, however, poorly understood and down-regulation of PI3 has been reported previously in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [39] , but not in studies of viral infections. A key finding in this study was a recovery phase that involves differential expression of a set of genes distinct from those observed in the acute phase of infection. Molecular characterization of a recovery phase has not been previously reported and the functions in the immune response of most of the differentially expressed genes are much less clear. Protein ubiquitination pathways and protein metabolic process are associated with the genes upregulated in the recovery phase. Symptomatic influenza cases exhibited extensive regulation in multiple growth factor signaling and cell proliferation pathways during the recovery phase. How these results may be integrated will require further investigation.",

In addition to IFI27 and PI3 that have the largest expression difference between influenza and HRV, CDKN1A and CDKN1C, which are essential genes involved in cell cycle control, appeared to be differentially expressed specifically in influenza virus infection. It has been reported that influenza virus infection induced cell cycle arrest in G1/S phase [40] , and the transcriptional reprogramming of cell cycle correlated with the severity of influenza illness [41] . The differences in host transcriptional response to influenza virus and rhinovirus infection might be explained by the fact that influenza virus replicates in the nucleus of host cells while HRV replicates in cytoplasm [42] , or explained by the distinct viral mechanisms in histone modification [22] . Individuals who did not have an identified pathogen associated with illness had conserved systemic expression signatures that were indistinguishable from the influenza and rhinovirus groups, with a large variation in the intensity of transcriptional response. This suggests that they were actually infected with one of the respiratory viruses for which we tested but which was not detected, or that they had an infection with another infectious agent that induces a similar transcriptional response.

We identified 229 genes whose transcriptional levels were correlated with the antibody response. Although the sample size we had for the correlation analysis is relatively small, over 1/3 of the genes identified in this study have previously been shown to be correlated with antibody response to influenza vaccination [24] . B cell proliferation genes, which predict influenza vaccine-induced antibody response [23] , were also correlated with the antibody response to naturally occurring influenza infection. These findings provide more insight into the molecular mechanisms of antibody production and secretion, and may also contribute to influenza vaccine development.",

Those subjects who subsequently developed influenza-like illness had moderate symptoms [5] . Children, the elderly, were not included and, fortunately, none of the research subjects developed severe illnesses. Second, this study did not allow analysis of the subjects who had influenza infection without symptoms. Based on seroconversion rates, 38% of the subjects were probably infected with influenza A H1N1 but did not have symptoms sufficient to trigger a follow up study visit. Third, all the subjects with influenza-illness enrolled in year 2009-2010 were infected with influenza A H1N1. And in year 2010-2011, only 9 were infected with influenza B and 3 were infected with influenza A H3N2, all the others were infected with H1N1 infection. Thus the sample size was not sufficient for comparing host transcriptional response to influenza A H1N1, H3N2 and influenza B. Fourth, the transcriptional responses to infection of cells residing in the secondary immune tissues, like lymph nodes or spleen, might be different from that of peripheral blood. Future research may investigate the correlations of gene expression between cells residing in different tissues. Finally, while antibody titers have been used to assess humoral immune responses, it is clear that they do not capture the complexity of the host response to ARIs. Additional studies would be necessary to establish the causal relationship between the genes identified and the antibody response, and whether they also regulate cytokine or chemokine levels.",
