Four core syndromes were endorsed for surveillance: acute fever and rash, prolonged fever, influenza-like illness and acute watery diarrhoea. In March 2015, Vanuatu was struck by Cyclone Pam, after which several important changes and improvements to the country's syndromic surveillance were made. To date, there has been no formal evaluation of whether regular reports are occurring or that core syndromes are being documented. We therefore carried out a descriptive study in the 11 sentinel sites in Vanuatu conducting syndromic surveillance between July and December 2015. There was a total of 53 822 consultations which were higher in the first 13 weeks (n = 29 622) compared with the last 13 weeks (n = 24 200). During the six months, there were no cases of acute fever and rash or prolonged fever. There were cases with influenza-like illness from week 27 to 35, but no case was reported after week 35. Acute watery diarrhoea occurred in one or two cases per week during the whole study period. For these two core syndromes, there were generally more females than males, and about one third were children aged under 5 years. In conclusion, Vanuatu implemented changes to its new syndromic surveillance system from July to December 2015, although laboratory components had not yet been incorporated. The laboratory components are working in 2016 and will be the subject of a further report.",

A central and historic responsibility for the World Health Organization (WHO) has been the management and control of the international spread of disease. To this end, International Health Regulations were formulated by WHO and adopted by the World Health Assembly in 1969. 1 In 2005, the World Health Assembly approved a second edition of the International Health Regulations in response to growth in international travel and trade and the emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome, the first global public health emergency of the 21st century. 2 Within this framework, Member States are mandated to collect information regarding public health events through surveillance activities and to assess the potential of these events to cause international spread of disease and possible interference with international travel and trade.",

The 11 sentinel sites include six hospitals, one in each province, and five health centres located in five islands in three provinces selected because of remoteness, population sizes or damage from Cyclone Pam. The population sizes in the catchment areas of the sentinel sites varied from 2600 to 15 000. At each sentinel site, doctors and/or nurses record the number of outpatient consultations each day on specially designed forms.
