            "text": "The overall threat of a viral pathogen to human populations is largely determined by the modus operandi and velocity of the pathogen that is transmitted among humans. Microorganisms that can spread by aerosol are considered a more challenging enemy than those that require direct body-to-body contact for transmission, due to the potential for infection of numerous people rather than a single individual. Additionally, disease containment is much more difficult to achieve for aerosolized viral pathogens than for pathogens that spread solely via direct person-to-person contact. Thus, aerobiology has become an increasingly necessary component for studying viral pathogens that are naturally or intentionally transmitted by aerosol. The goal of studying aerosol viral pathogens is to improve public health preparedness and medical countermeasure development. Here, we provide a brief overview of the animal biosafety level 4 Aerobiology Core at the NIH/NIAID Integrated Research Facility at Fort Detrick, Maryland, USA.",

            "text": "Microorganisms infect humans through numerous routes of transmission. Viral pathogens that are dependent on direct person-to-person contact for transmission are generally contained by preventing direct physical contact between humans. Although viral pathogens that spread by direct contact can still cause disease outbreaks on a global scale (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus 1), these outbreaks usually develop in a protracted manner (decades) rather than spreading geometrically in an explosive manner. Novel pandemic threats to human populations are therefore largely relegated to microorganisms that can be transmitted by aerosols (large respiratory droplets or small particle droplet nuclei) [1] . As a result, humans infected with such pathogens may infect numerous people within larger urban settings in a very short time. Thus, complete containment of aerosolized viral pathogens may prove impossible in instances when the numbers of infected people have reached a critical limit. Viral pathogens that cause significant morbidity and lethality through their natural airborne transmission include influenza A viruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, human herpesvirus 3 (varicella zoster virus), and variola virus. Recently, epidemiologists and biodefense researchers are increasingly concerned that bioterrorists or other aggressors may \"aerosolize\" pathogens usually not transmitted through the air. In this scenario, the introduction of pathogens into the human host through an unnatural mechanism may result in modified disease courses that clinicians may fail to properly diagnose and treat.",

Aerobiology studies have become increasingly sophisticated over the past decade, thanks to significant technological advances made at multiple scientific institutions. Research at the NIH/NIAID Integrated Research Facility at Fort Detrick (IRF-Frederick) located in Frederick, MD, USA, focuses on high consequence emerging viral pathogens that require animal biosafety level 4 (ABSL-4) or biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) containment, including specific arenaviruses, bunyaviruses, flaviviruses, and filoviruses. Work with these NIAID Priority Pathogens and/or CDC Bioterrorism Agents requires rigorous and specialized staff training, strict biosecurity/biosurety oversight, and the highest level of biocontainment [3] [4] [5] . Biosafety precautions for ABSL-4/BSL-4 experiments are outlined in the Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL) manual and several other publications [6] [7] [8] . Such precautions are implemented through facility-specific standard operating procedures. The primary focus of the IRF-Frederick is to facilitate the development and/or evaluation of medical countermeasures against high consequence viral pathogens and ease the transition of candidate therapeutics or vaccines to clinical licensure. To accomplish this task, the IRF-Frederick has been constructed to mimic an intensive care unit for animals experimentally infected with high consequence viral pathogens [9] . Here we describe the Aerobiology Core of the IRF-Frederick and the safety requirements and procedures that govern aerobiology.",

The Class III BSC provides a primary barrier of protection and a safe, controlled, ABSL-4 or BSL-4 environment in which researchers perform viral pathogen characterization or in vivo experiments. Decontamination of the cabinets must take place between experiments to facilitate safe maintenance and/or repairs and to prevent cross-contamination between subsequent studies. The method of choice for decontamination at the IRF-Frederick is paraformaldehyde gas, as the gas is effective and easy to use in Class III BSCs [12] . All decontamination procedures follow standard operating procedures. Successful decontamination of a Class III BSC is documented from the results of biological indicators that validate agent inactivation ( Figure 3 ). The Class III biosafety cabinet (BSC) is a hermetically sealed stainless steel cabinet containing an ABSL-4 environment under negative pressure (currently in static state for easy viewing) within an ABSL-4 cabinet laboratory. Materials can be introduced into the BSC by staff working in the ABSL-4 cabinet laboratory through an under-cabinet-mounted stainless steel tank containing the disinfectant Micro-Chem Plus \u00ae (commonly referred to as a \"dunk tank\" in ABSL-4 or BSL-4 settings). Because the BSC is built into the wall separating the cabinet laboratory from an ABSL-4 suit laboratory, materials, animals, and viral pathogens can also be moved into the BSC from the ABSL-4 suit laboratory side using a transport cart and a Rapid Transfer Port (RTP). The contents within the BSC can be manipulated from the outside by researchers wearing various types of synthetic rubber gloves, specifically neoprene/chlorosulphonated polyethylene. Contents, excluding infectious samples, are removed from the BSC after sterilization through a double-door autoclave or disinfection via the dunk tank. Figure 2 . The IRF-Frederick Aerobiology Core Class III BSC laboratory. Shown are the IRF-Frederick Aerobiology Core's two Class III BSCs within the ABSL-4 cabinet laboratory. One researcher is manipulating the contents of one of the Class III BSCs via synthetic rubber gloves. The other researcher is monitoring the parameters of the experiment electronically. Figure 3 . Class III BSC paraformaldehyde gas decontamination setup. After an experiment, a researcher connects a decontamination machine to the BSC through designated external ports on top of the glove box. From a paraformaldehyde gas generator (Certek, Durham, NC, USA), the gas is pumped into the BSC and decontaminates the BSC after an appropriate contact time (i.e., 6 h). The gas is then neutralized by ammonium bicarbonate for an additional 6 h (12 h total decontamination). Biological indicators are placed throughout the BSC and the results are recorded and analyzed by staff.",

The BMBL manual mandates that all Class III cabinet laboratories have an attached autoclave and equivalent decontamination method, such as a pass-through tank filled with disinfectant (dunk tank) [6] . At the IRF-Frederick, materials are sterilized and passed in and out of the cabinet through a double-door autoclave ( Figure 6 ). An interlocking door mechanism ensures that only one autoclave door can be opened during Class III BSC use. This mechanism also prevents the outer door of the autoclave from being operational until a decontamination cycle has taken place.

Lastly, a dedicated High-Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filtration system is used in conjunction with the general laboratory exhaust system, known as the \"HEPA deck.\" Air entering the Class III BSCs is filtered once, whereas outgoing air is filtered twice before being discharged to the facility's HEPA deck exhaust system [6, 9] . The two exhaust HEPA filters on the Class III BSCs are installed \"in series\" and are certified independently by use of the disperse oil particle scan method. After gas decontamination of HEPA filters, all HEPA filters are tested, and a negative result indicates that the filters are \"clean\" or \"non-infectious\". HEPA filters are also tested for leaks and certified annually to ensure correct functionality [10] .",

A few readings from the particle sizer gives a snapshot of the total particle count in the sampled air, mass median aerodynamic diameter of the particles, and geometric standard deviation. The cascade impactor (e.g., Cascade Impactor, In-Tox Products) analyzes particle size continuously during the exposure. The researcher analyzes particle size (mass) within a dedicated size range. As the particle size decreases, the ability to travel further through the device increases. The researcher determines the size range of the majority of generated particles from mass accumulation of particles collected onto each stage (collection plate with culture medium) of the cascade impactor (e.g., seven stages for the Cascade impactor). From the ability to generate particles of different sizes and to evaluate the particle size distribution in relation to disease course and pathogenesis, the researcher can estimate the deposition of particles within the respiratory tract. The deposition pattern is dependent on particle size, density, shape, airway geometry, and breathing pattern, as well as the mechanisms of deposition (impaction, settling, diffusion, interception, and electrostatic deposition) [20] .

In experiments involving smaller animals, the inhaled dose is calculated using body-weight-based formulas to estimate respiratory minute volume. With one such formula, Guyton's formula, the respiratory minute volume is estimated by cc/min = 2.1 \u00d7 (body weight in grams) 0.75 [24] . In larger animals, the inhaled dose is calculated using a simplified formula D = R \u00d7 C aero \u00d7 T exp . D is the presented or inhaled dose (e.g., virus plaque-forming units), R is the respiratory minute volume (L/min) measured by plethysmography, C aero is the aerosol concentration (plaque forming units/L), and T exp is the duration of the exposure (min) [14, 23] . In the future, the respiratory minute volume will be monitored continuously. Then, exposure time will be varied so that the same inhaled dose could be delivered to each animal, as the minute volume of larger animals can vary widely [14] . By monitoring the respiratory function during the experiment, the researcher can control the amount and duration of the inhalation procedure, rather than using predetermined estimates of time of exposure. The AAMP will then terminate the exposure when the target dose of the virus is achieved.",
