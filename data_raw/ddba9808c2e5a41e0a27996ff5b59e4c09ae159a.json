Here we mapped 33 host protein interactions of CD81 in primary human liver and hepatoma cells using high-resolution quantitative proteomics. In the CD81 protein network, we identified five proteins which are HCV entry factors or facilitators including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Notably, we discovered calpain-5 (CAPN5) and the ubiquitin ligase Casitas B-lineage lymphoma proto-oncogene B (CBLB) to form a complex with CD81 and support HCV entry. CAPN5 and CBLB were required for a post-binding and pre-replication step in the HCV life cycle. Knockout of CAPN5 and CBLB reduced susceptibility to all tested HCV genotypes, but not to other enveloped viruses such as vesicular stomatitis virus and human coronavirus. Furthermore, Plasmodium sporozoites relied on a distinct set of CD81 interaction partners for liver cell entry. Our findings reveal a comprehensive CD81 network in human liver cells and show that HCV and Plasmodium highjack selective CD81 interactions, including CAPN5 and CBLB for HCV, to invade cells.",

Currently, it remains enigmatic how CD81 guides the entry process of both pathogens and whether it functions in a similar way during liver cell invasion of HCV and malaria parasites. Here, we use high resolution quantitative proteomics to identify CD81 associated host proteins in liver cells. We found that at least 33 proteins form a complex with CD81, 23 of which were not reported as interaction partners before.

All tested HCV genotypes require CAPN5 and CBLB for full infection, but neither malaria parasites nor other tested enveloped virus rely on CAPN5 or CBLB.

In particular, CD81 is essential for infection with both pathogens as mice are only susceptible to HCV when expressing human CD81 and blocking CD81 on human hepatocytes impairs P. falciparum infection [4, 6] . While HCV binds to the ectodomain of CD81 and co-internalizes with CD81 into clathrin-coated vesicles [5, 7] , P. falciparum and the murine parasite P. yoelii do not seem to directly interact with CD81, but still require CD81 for productive uptake into hepatocytes [4, 8] .",

            "text": "HCV entry is tightly spatio-temporally controlled. After basolateral attachment of HCV to SCARB1 and subsequently CD81, the CD81-virus complex laterally translocates towards tight junctions, where the late entry factors claudin-1 (CLDN1) and occludin (OCLN) reside [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . Here CD81 and CLDN1 co-internalize with the virus into endosomes [10] . The trafficking steps are thought to be coordinated by epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling and EGFR is indeed an entry factor for HCV [14, 15] . Acidification of the endosomal pH ultimately leads to fusion of the viral envelope with the limiting endosomal membrane to deliver the viral nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm [16, 17] . Importantly, CD81 interaction with HCV induces conformational changes in the E1E2 surface glycoprotein heterodimer, which is a prerequisite for pH-dependent fusion [18] . After membrane fusion, the viral nucleocapsid disassembles and releases the viral genome to the cytoplasmic sites of viral genome translation and replication. This uncoating and trafficking is thought to require serum response factor binding protein 1 (SRFBP1), which is recruited to CD81 during HCV entry [19] . In sum, although CD81 fulfills multiple functions during HCV entry [20] , the steady-state CD81 interaction partners required for HCV entry are largely unknown and demand elucidation.",

Previously, we identified 26 proteins, which associate with or dissociate from CD81 during HCV entry, six of which with a role in HCV infection [19] . Here we rationalized that not only virus induced CD81 interactions, but potentially also pre-existing steady state interactions may play a role in HCV infection. Therefore, we determined high stringency CD81 protein interactions in human hepatoma cells and primary human liver cells through analysis of 120 different CD81 co-immunoprecipitations (co-IP) and high-resolution quantitative mass spectrometry. This revealed 33 CD81 interactions, ten of which were previously described. RNAi and CRISPR/Cas9 knockout follow up elucidated two proteins, the endopeptidase calpain-5 (CAPN5) and the E3 ubiquitin ligase Casitas B-lineage lymphoma protooncogene B (CBLB) as HCV host factors. We further confirmed a role of CAPN5 and CBLB in HCV infection of all HCV genotypes. Both proteins are expressed intracellularly and seem to affect a post-binding entry step during HCV infection. CAPN5 and CBLB are not required for Plasmodium uptake. Finally, we report a whole cell proteome expression dataset for human hepatoma cells and show that CAPN5 is strongly associated with CD81. Taken together, we used a combined quantitative proteomics-CRISPR/Cas9 strategy to map CD81 interactions in liver cells and identified CAPN5 and CBLB as HCV entry facilitators.",

Mass spectrometry based-proteomics has matured into a powerful technology to comprehensively analyze protein-protein interactions (PPIs) from cell culture and primary cell material [22] [23] [24] . Here we set out to apply label-free quantitative (LFQ) proteomics to map the interaction network of the HCV and Plasmodium entry factor CD81 in human liver cells (Fig 1A) . Therefore, we used human hepatoma cell lines (Lunet N) lacking endogenous CD81 and expressed wildtype or C-terminally hemagglutinin-(HA) tagged CD81 in these cells (S1A Fig) . This allowed us to use antibodies against endogenous or tag epitopes to pull out different versions of the bait. We confirmed expression of the respective CD81 protein by immunoblot, immunofluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. Wildtype and HA-tagged CD81 were expressed at the cell surface and in intracellular compartments comparable to endogenous CD81 in Huh-7.5 human hepatoma cells (S1B-S1D Fig) . Lunet N cells lacking detectable CD81 expression served as negative control in all infection and proteomics experiments [25] . Expectedly, Lunet N cells lacking CD81 were refractory to infection with HCV and with lentiviruses pseudotyped with HCV glycoproteins, which rely on HCV receptor interaction during entry [26, 27] . In contrast expression of hCD81 or hCD81HA in Lunet N cells rendered cells HCV susceptible (S1E and S1F Fig).",

Nonetheless, BS3 crosslinking reduced CD81 and SCARB1 enrichment by one or two orders of magnitude, respectively (intensity (CD81): 10 10 This reduced capture may result from crosslinking of large protein aggregates, which are lost during preclearing of lysates or from masking of antibody epitopes.

            "text": "To unravel, whether the identified CD81 protein interaction network in hepatoma cells reflected the PPIs in primary human hepatocytes, we developed a second LFQ affinity enrichment mass spectrometry (AE-MS) pipeline (Fig 2A) . Here due to lack of control cells negative for CD81 expression, we performed isotype control co-IPs to determine nonspecific background binding of proteins to the IP resin ( Fig 2B) . We analyzed primary human hepatocytes from five donors. Samples from two donors passed our quality criteria namely strong CD81 bait and SCARB1 positive control enrichment (>10-fold). An irrelevant protein (APOL2) showed similarly low abundance in CD81 specific and control IPs (Fig 2C and 2D ). More than 150 proteins were enriched more than 10-fold over controls in both donors. Of these proteins roughly 80% are annotated as membrane associated (Fig 2E and S3 Table) . Twenty-three CD81 interactors found in primary human hepatocytes overlapped with the set of 29 hepatoma cell interactors (Fig 2F and Table 1 ). As prey protein enrichment was limited in the co-IPs from HA-tagged CD81 expressing cells, we performed a second overlap analysis exclusively with the primary hepatocyte hits (>4-fold enrichment) and highly significant hepatoma cell hits (FDR = 0.004, s0 = 2) from cells with untagged CD81. Through this second analysis, we detected an overlap of 26 proteins including ten 'novel' proteins ( Fig 2G) not found in the first overlap analysis (Fig 2F) . Of note, these ten hits were also enriched in anti-CD81 co-IPs from CD81HA expressing cells, but not to an extent to fulfill our very stringent hit inclusion criteria of roughly 30-fold enrichment ( Table 1 ). The 10 novel hits together with the 23 hits from the first overlap analysis resulted in 33 high confidence CD81 interactors in primary hepatocytes and hepatoma cells (Fig 2G and Table 1 ). Fig 2H summarizes the protein abundance of the CD81 bait protein and the 33 CD81 interactors in co-IPs from hepatoma cells and primary human hepatocytes. Lastly, we performed an integrated network analysis based on STRING and DAVID data for the 33 conserved CD81 binding partners and showed that 28 proteins are highly interconnected through previously reported interactions ( Fig 3A and Table 1 ). From this network, we included the closest nine nodes in our hit list for follow up, resulting in a final hit list of 42 proteins. This ensured that putative network proteins poorly amenable to MS identification were still included in subsequent infection assays (in silico interactors labeled with \u00c3 in Table 1 ). Of the final 42 CD81 network molecules defined in this study, ten proteins were previously recognized CD81 interactors including SCARB1, the integrins ITGA1, ITGA6, ITGB1, the G proteins GNA11, GNAI1, GNAI3, CD151, ApoE and prostaglandin F2 receptor negative regulator (PTGFRN) [15] . Six of the CD81 liver cell interactors found here were previously reported HCV entry facilitators as described above (labeled with + in Table 1 ). In addition, the LFQ approach and extensive comparison of hepatoma and primary cell datasets elucidated 27 CD81 interactors without a previously reported role in HCV entry or CD81 binding. In summary, we defined a stringent set of 42 CD81 interactors in human liver cells (S3A Fig, Table 1 ).",

The CD81 silencing effect was limited since we used Lunet N hCD81 cells, which overexpress hCD81. Five CD81 network proteins, namely the E3 ubiquitin ligases CBLB and CBL, the endopeptidase CAPN5, SCARB1 and CD151, reduced the susceptibility to HCV upon siRNA silencing with mean z-scores of -2.3, -4.1, -2.7, -3.4 and -2.4, respectively ( Fig 3C) .

First, we evaluated the P. yoelii requirement for CD81 using Lunet N hCD81 cells.

Moreover, CAPN5 and CBLB appear to be strongly associated with the CD81 complex as their total abundance in human hepatoma cell lysates was comparably low as quantified by intensity based absolute quantification (iBAQ). LC-MS/MS analysis of Lunet N hCD81 whole cell lysates revealed moderate expression levels for CAPN5 (log 2 (iBAQ) = 23) ( Fig 5A) . Expression was comparable to OCLN (log 2 (iBAQ) = 23) and lower than for SCARB1, CLDN1 and CD81 (log 2 (iBAQ)>25). Similar expression patterns occurred in all other tested human hepatoma cell lines (S5A and S5B Fig, S4 Table) . CBLB, which we included as in silico predicted network edge, was undetectable by LC-MS/MS. However, we could clearly show protein expression in hepatoma cells by flow cytometry, immunofluorescence microscopy and immunoblot (Figs 5D, S5D and S5H). Comparison of the absolute CAPN5 abundance with the enrichment from the CD81 IP ( Fig 5B) suggests that a large fraction of CAPN5 is associated with CD81 in human hepatoma cells. Next, we addressed the subcellular localization of CAPN5 and CBLB. Both proteins have multiple cellular component annotations including plasma membrane, cytosol and nucleus. In human hepatoma cells we detected both proteins in intracellular compartments but not exposed to the cell surface (Fig 5C and 5D ). Immunofluorescence analysis further confirmed expression in cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments as reported for other cell types (S5C and S5D Fig) . Both CAPN5 and CBLB showed a weak co-localization with the plasma membrane expressed protein zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1) with Pearson's correlation coefficients of 0.28 and 0.26, respectively (Fig 5E and 5F ).",

Neither CAPN5 nor CBLB affected surface expression of SCARB1, CD81, CLDN1 and OLCN on human hepatoma cells (Fig 6C) . Similarly, EGFR surface expression levels remained unaffected by CAPN5 and CBLB knockout (S6A Fig). Next, we analyzed whether receptor usage of HCV was impaired by CAPN5 or CBLB. Therefore, we took advantage of lentiviral pseudoparticles displaying the HCV surface glycoproteins E1 and E2 and thus mimicking the receptor dependent entry steps [16, 34] . Neither CAPN5 nor CBLB influenced cell entry of HCV glycoprotein pseudotyped lentiviruses ( Fig 6D) . This held true for both tested HCV genotypes, namely GT1a (H77 strain) and GT1b (Con1 strain).

To further investigate a possible role of both proteins in fusion and uncoating, we fused HCVcc particles at the plasma membrane of CAPN5 and CBLB knockout cells by low pH wash and monitored infection rates. In this assay, entry through the natural route is prevented by concanamycin A blockage of endosomal acidification. CAPN5 and CBLB knockout cells displayed similar infection rates through the plasma membrane bypass, while the HCV fusion inhibitor flunarizine reduced infection rates to background levels ( Fig 6E) [36]. This indicates that HCV membrane fusion is not altered by CAPN5 and CBLB and moreover that HCV uncoating is unaffected by CAPN5 and CBLB.",

Subgenomic genotype 1b and full length genotype 2a replicons showed comparable results as genotype 2a subgenomes (S6B and S6D Fig) .

CAPN5 and CBLB were dispensable for CoV and VSV infection in human hepatoma cells (Fig 7B and 7C) . Similarly, P. yoelii and P. berghei sporozoites entered CAPN5 and CBLB knockout cells at least as efficiently as control cells (S7 Fig). In contrast, CAPN5 and CBLB were necessary for full infection with all tested HCV genotypes (Fig 7D-7J) , revealing a pan-genotypic requirement for CAPN5 and CBLB. Complementation of CAPN5 and CBLB knockout cells with either enzymatically active or dead variants of both proteins led to a twofold increase in HCV susceptibility (Fig 8A) . We confirmed these findings using non-reporter genotype 2 HCV (strain Jc1). CAPN5 and CBLB knockout cells showed a 3-fold drop in titers of released HCV, which was rescued by either wildtype or active site mutants of CAPN5 and CBLB (Fig 8B) . To further shed light on CAPN5 and CBLB domains required for HCV infection, we overexpressed full length and truncated domain mutants of CAPN5 and CBLB in Lunet N hCD81 cells (Fig 8C) . Overexpression of full length CAPN5, the N-terminal protease core domains (PC1 and PC2) or the two C-terminal C2-like domains (C2L) increased basal HCV infection three-fold. Overexpression of CBLB full length, N-terminal tyrosine kinase binding (TKB) and RING finger domain or the RING finger domain together with the C-terminal proline-rich and ubiquitin associating domain (UBA) led to a maximum 1.5-fold increase in HCV infection (Figs 8D and  S8 ). This suggests that CAPN5 and CBLB function in HCV entry independent of their enzymatic and signaling functions, i.e. that both proteins have a scaffolding function. Taken together our study reveals a role for CD81 PPIs in productive HCV entry and specifically unravels CAPN5 and CBLB as host entry facilitators guiding productive uptake of HCV lipoviroparticles into replication competent intracellular sites.",

In B lymphocytes CD81 serves as a clamp for the B cell receptor complex [37, 38] . In liver cells only little information on the CD81 guided membrane protein complexes is available and this is reflected by a limited knowledge on endogenous CD81 functions in the liver [15, 39] . Here, we identified 33 CD81 associated proteins and their relative strength of interaction with CD81 as determined by abundance in CD81 co-IPs (depicted in a centered network in S3A Fig) plus nine closest neighbor network proteins. Using STRING network, Ingenuity pathway and DAVID GO enrichment analysis of the 42 CD81 network proteins in liver cells, we found ephrin receptor signaling, ephrin B signaling, thrombin signaling, and Tec kinase signaling as top four biological pathways (-log(p)>20) (S3B Fig). Notably, ephrin receptor serves as entry facilitator for HCV and other viruses such as Nipah virus and Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus [14, 40, 41] . The top four associated diseases and disorders reflect a reported role of CD81 in cell migration and include organismal injury (33 molecules), cancer (28 molecules), inflammatory response (17 molecules) and infectious disease (15 molecules) (S3C Fig). The notion of an involvement of CD81 receptor complexes in cell migration is further strengthened by the association of the CD81 interactome with the following molecular and cellular functions: cell-to-cell signaling (33 molecules), cell movement (25 molecules) and cell morphology (23 molecules) (S3D Fig). The two top ranked cellular networks associated with the CD81 interactome in liver cells are cell-to-cell signaling and movement (score 36, 18 focus molecules) and infectious disease (score 16, 10 focus molecules) (S3E Fig). The analysis suggests a role for CD81 in integrin and G protein coordination as well as TFRC and EGFR signaling. The latter two receptors are HCV entry facilitators, highlighting once more that the heredefined CD81 interactome can indeed reveal host factors with a role in pathogen invasion in the liver.",

We found that the E3 ligase activity of CBLB is dispensable for promoting HCV uptake. This is in line with an E3 ligase activity independent role of CBLB in B cell receptor internalization [45] . CBLB is known to coordinate EGFR internalization together with CBL, which others and we describe as HCV entry facilitator [29, 46] . This together with our findings suggests that CBLB has a scaffolding function during EGFR driven endocytosis of the HCV-CD81 platform. Future studies possibly using recently developed organoid models and single particle tracking of HCV may shed light on the spatiotemporal role of CBLB in HCV entry [13] .",

Firstly, HCV in contrast to lentiviral pseudoparticles tightly associates with serum lipoproteins to form lipoviroparticles [56, 57] . Secondly, HCV replicates in specialized cytoplasmatic compartments while lentiviruses replicate in the nucleus [58] . Our data points towards a role of CAPN5 and CBLB in guiding endosomal uptake and trafficking to HCV replication competent cytoplasmic compartments. This model is supported by the notion that endosomal sorting depends on membrane protein-lipid complexes and that correct endosomal routing is critical for productive virus infection [59] [60] [61] . Thus we propose a model in which CBLB and CAPN5 regulate endosomal uptake of HCV-receptor complexes and subsequent routing towards replication competent subcellular compartments (Fig 8E) .",

This is in line with the fact that HCV critically relies on the host cell endocytic machinery, while Plasmodium is a motile organism that enters cells actively using its own motor machinery. Moreover, different regions in the CD81 ectodomain are required for HCV and Plasmodium entry, respectively [5, 8, [62] [63] [64] . In line with this, we demonstrate that CAPN5 and CBLB promote HCV entry, but not Plasmodium entry into human hepatoma cells. Interestingly, growth factor receptors are implicated in the entry process of HCV and Plasmodium [14, 65] , suggesting that some CD81 interaction partners may be hijacked by both pathogens. In this study, we only identified only CBL as common entry facilitator and in fact activation of growth factor receptors likely differs between both pathogens. While the Plasmodium thrombosponin-related anonymous protein (TRAP) can directly activate host kinases [66] , HCV probably induces kinases through CD81-mediated receptor clustering. Such mechanistic details, however, remain to be elucidated. Interestingly, EGFR associated molecules scored positive for HCV and Plasmodium in the RNA interference screen. HCV relied on CBL and CBLB, while Plasmodium relied on CBL and the EGFR adaptor protein GRB2 [67] . GRB2 has also been reported as HCV entry facilitator [15] . We show that CBLB knockdown and knockout cells are fully functional for Plasmodium uptake. This highlights the versatile follow up of receptor interaction proteomics and demonstrates similarities and differences in usage of CD81 by HCV and Plasmodium.",

Our RNAi data suggests that steady state interactions of the HCV receptor CD81 in liver cells are non-protective. In this study we concentrated on interactions occurring in susceptible primary liver cells and hepatoma cells. The latter were adapted to support the full HCV life cycle. Notably, we found a significant number of primary hepatocyte specific interactions, which we did not follow up on functionally in this study. It is conceivable that some of these interactions are protective. This, together with the stronger innate immune response of primary hepatocytes as compared to the highly HCV-adapted hepatoma cell lines, could explain the low susceptibility of primary cells to HCV. In infected patients a very slow disease progression with limited viral spread in the liver and symptoms occurring 15 to 25 years post contraction reflects this phenotype. Future work will clarify the existence of protective protein networks in primary hepatocytes. Clearly the CD81 interaction network in non-susceptible cells like B cells markedly differs from the here described liver cell CD81 network [69] . This confirms the notion that CD81 interactors like SCARB1 contribute to the narrow tissue tropism of HCV [70] .",

Proteomics methods, in contrast to genomics and transcriptomics methods, have just in the past decade reached resolution and throughput necessary for systematic analysis of host pathogen interactions and overall proteome profiles of infected cells [72] . Importantly, protein interaction profiling in combination with computational biology is an iterative process which ultimately can map a near to completion cellular network. In the future, we may be able to predict in silico, how perturbations of such a network by pathogens influences cellular functions. In the current study, we describe the isolated network of the plasma membrane protein CD81. This tetraspanin functions in cell motility and in confirmation we found integrins, small G proteins, GTPases and growth factor receptors involved in cell migration as CD81 network molecules [39] . To our current knowledge, HCV uses only two of these molecules (EGFR, ITGB1) for cell entry and Plasmodium presumably none of the molecules involved in cell migration. Thus, design of antimicrobial drugs with minimal side effects on endogenous CD81 functions may be possible. Importantly, pathogens may use protein domains and functions, which are not required for the endogenous role of the protein, as indicated by the functionality of active site mutants of CAPN5 and CBLB in HCV entry. It may thus be feasible to specifically target protein functions used by pathogens and thereby exclude or minimize side effects. Furthermore, systems virology approaches using primary cell material from numerous donors hold the promise of elucidating individual differences in protein expression and networks, thereby spurring personalized medicine. In conclusion our study not only impacts the understanding of HCV entry and pathogenesis, but also sets the stage for further elucidation of HCV driven carcinogenesis and entry of the malaria parasite into the liver.",

The screen was conducted nine times on cells of three independent passages. Normalization and statistical analysis was performed on a set of 45 targets including CD81, CLDN1 and SCARB1 positive controls in R using the Bioconductor package RNAither [95] . Briefly, normalization for plate effects was done by subtracting the plate mean and dividing by the plate standard deviation.",
