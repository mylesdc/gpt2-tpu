A Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship approach, for classification, was used for the prediction of active/inactive compounds relatively to overall biological activity, antitumor and antibiotic activities using a data set of 1804 compounds from PubChem. Using the best classification models for antibiotic and antitumor activities a data set of marine and microbial natural products from the AntiMarin database were screened-57 and 16 new lead compounds for antibiotic and antitumor drug design were proposed, respectively. All compounds proposed by our approach are classified as non-antibiotic and non-antitumor compounds in the AntiMarin database. Recently several of the lead-like compounds proposed by us were reported as being active in the literature.",

            "text": "Small organic molecules have proven to be important tools for biological systems research, but there is still much to learn from their use. From the 150,000 structures in the CRC Dictionary of Natural Products (NPs) only approximately 1% of them have at least one biological test results described in the MDL Drug Data Report database (MDDR) [1] , which has been compiled by Prous Science from the patent literature since 1988. NPs or synthetic products inspired by NPs have been the single most productive source leads for the development of drugs. In fact, more than half of the approved drugs from 1981 to 2010 are based on NPs [2] . At the turn of the 21st century, a new branch of NPs chemistry had been fully established-Marine Natural Products (MNPs). In fact, the future seems very promising for this new branch since MNP chemists have already elucidated the chemical structure of over 22,000 novel compounds [3] . Moreover, from these, 7 are already approved drugs [4] , (four anticancer, one antiviral, one pain control, and one hypertriglyceridemia). The success rate of drug discovery from the marine world is 1 drug per 3140 natural products described. This rate is approximately 1.7-to 3.3-fold better than the industry average (1 in 5000-10,000 tested compounds) [5] . Nowadays, there are facilities for high-throughput screening available both in academic labs or in drug pharmaceutical companies, but the cost of random screening for very large collections of compounds can nevertheless be prohibitive, making chemoinformatics approaches for the virtual screening of the most probable active compounds valuable tools. Although in the last few years chemoinformatics approaches have been applied for in silico screening of natural products [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] , this is a field that can be significantly improved by the modeling of data from large databases containing information relative to biological activities, which are becoming available to the scientific community. Besides the virtual screening, the computational methods can be very useful to build appropriate databases, allowing for effective short-circuits of NP extracts dereplication procedures [13] , which will certainly result in increasing the efficiency of drug discovery. An example of a powerful database is AntiMarin [14] , which contains approximately 50,000 compounds from marine macroorganisms and both marine and terrestrial microorganisms. AntiMarin is the result of a merger between AntiBase [15] (a database of all terrestrial and marine microbial natural products) and MarinLit [3] (a database of marine natural products literature). Bacteria are an exceptional source of chemical diversity. Among them, species of the order Actinomycetales (commonly called actinomycetes) are the single most productive source of microbial derived natural products, accounting for ca. 75% of all antibiotics discovered [16] , as well as a broad range of anticancer agents. Although the actinomycetes are best known as soil bacteria, a growing interest in its distribution and ecological role in the marine environment has been observed. Therefore, besides marine natural products (MNPs) we will refer the NP derived from microbial source as microbial natural products M b NPs, accounting for those of terrestrial origin.",

As was expected the overall CT biological model shows poor prediction accuracy-a G-mean of 0.21 for test set I. With the overall biological activity model, we intended to improve the precision of lead-like profiling by compensating for the lack of bioactivity records in the 1192 compounds extracted from the AntiMarin database. Like in other databases, in the AntiMarin database each molecule has been tested for only a few activities chosen by the researchers or grant programs, so there are probably many bioactive molecules that lack an activity record, because they have never been tested against other biological screens. With this problem in mind we would expect that the difficulty with this model was actually the false positives (FPs) for the test set II. Indeed, we obtained a large number of FP for the test set II, as shown by the low specificity value of 0.32 obtained for the best model (RF) compared with the high specificity value of 0.78 obtained for the test set I, Table 1 . The analysis of the results obtained from RF and SVM models has shown that there are 176 and 12 FP, common to both models, for the test set II and I, respectively. For these FP, it was obtained an average probability of being active (Prob_ave_act) in the RF model of 0.68 (80 FP have a Prob_ave_act \u2265 0.7), and 0.61 (2 FP have a Prob_ave_act \u2265 0.7) for the test set II and I, respectively. Many authors have tried to rationalize the drug-like and lead-like nature of compounds, Waldmann et al. [8] suggested through a statistical analysis of the structural classification of natural products that more than half of all natural products have just the right size to serve as a starting point for hit and lead discovery. The lead-like molecules must have a scaffold with two, three, or four rings, and their van der Waals volumes must match the lower end of the majority of the protein cavities (i.e., van der Waals volume between 300 and 800 \u00c5 3 [8] ). The analysis of the active and non-active profiles of the van der Waals volume of the 2706 compounds from PubChem (training set and test set I) and 1192 compounds from AntiMarin (test set II) containing different ring numbers demonstrated that the non-active compounds from AntiMarin present a higher number of compounds having three and four rings with the right size than those from PubChem ( Figure 1 ).",

In the test set I, there are 225 compounds with these specifications. From those 216 compounds (i.e., approximately 96%) are active compared with only 195 active compounds (i.e., approximately 72%) from the 271 AntiMarin (test set II) compounds with the same specifications. On the other hand 188 and 178 compounds were predicted as true positive (TP) with a Prob_ave_act of 0.72 and 0.74 using the RF model for test set I and II, respectively. Moreover, for the test set II, 67 compounds were predicted as FPs, compared with only 4 FPs for the test set I, with a Prob_ave_act of 0.68 and 0.59, respectively. Additionally, we use the Lipinski rule-of-five (R-o-5) to analyze the RF activity model. The R-o-5 is widely used as a filter in drug discovery to evaluate drug likeness and to verify if a compound with some activity has properties that would make it a possible orally active drug in humans. It is applied in the optimization of activity, selectivity and drug-like properties of lead compounds. Beside its wide application, it should be emphasized that the R-o-5 does not really predict if a compound is active, the Lipinski rule states that a compound that is more likely to be an orally active drug and easily absorbed by the body has no more than one violation of the following criteria: a molecular weight less than 500, an estimation of the octanol-water partition coefficient not greater than 5, a sum of nitrogen and oxygen atoms in a molecule not more than 10 and, a total number of potential hydrogen-bond donors not more than 5 [17] . This criterion was applied to test set II and the filtered compounds that conform to the R-o-5 were analyzed and compared to the RF performance for the same set of filtered compounds. Similarly to the RF model with the application of the R-o-5 to test set II a large number of FPs emerged, 202 (212 FP by the RF model). From those Lipinski's FP compounds there were as well 108 compounds that were predicted as FP by the RF model with a Prob_ave_act of 0.61. Twenty eight MNPs (Scheme 1) were listed as having a probability of being active (Prob activity ) greater than or equal to 0.8 using the RF activity model. For the test set I, only active compounds were predicted with a Prob activity greater than or equal to 0.8 using the RF activity model. We propose these MNPs and M b NPs as lead bioactive compounds and consider that they have been misclassified as non-active compounds in the AntiMarin database. Scheme 1. The selected 28 lead bioactive MNPs and M b NPs from the AntiMarin database using theRF activity model. From these 28 FPs, seven compounds (IDs 105, 106; 333, 573, 647, 917 and 992) are considered to be FPs using the -right size\u2016 approach but only one (ID 959) is conform to the R-o-5 criteria. Interestingly, from the 28 FPs, 26 MNPs and M b NPs (i.e., 25 M b NPs and 1 MNP) were classified as being antibiotic by the RF antibiotic model with an average probability of being antibiotic (Prob_ave_antibiotic) of 0.82, compared with only 3 MNPs and M b NPs (i.e., 1 M b NP and 2 MNPs) that were classified as being antitumor by the RF antitumor model with an average probability of being antitumor (Prob_ave_antitumor) of 0.56. From those 26 FPs, 6 (IDs 105, 106, 573, 647, 860 and 992) were predicted as being antibiotic with a probability of being antibiotic (Prob antibiotic ) greater than or equal to 0.9 using the RF antibiotic model. Although no biological activity was recorded for the butirosin A analogs (IDs 105, 106 and 647, see Scheme 1) in the AntiMarin database, the work of Woo et al. [18] had shown an improved antibiotic activity of deoxy derivatives in the \u03b1-D-glucopyrasonyl unit (namely IDs 105, 106 and 647) over butirosin A (a broad-spectrum aminoglycoside antibiotic). Moreover, this study had referred also to the advantageous effect of the 5-amino function in the \u03b2-D-xylofuranosyl unit (e.g., IDs 105, 106) as compared with the 5-hydroxyl group of butirosin A and M b NP ID 647, against some, but not all, of the organisms studied. The 1-N-acyl derivative of the arbekacin (ID 573 see Scheme 1), was identified as being resistant to many inactivating enzymes while retaining most of the intrinsic antibiotic activity of the unsubstituted molecules against susceptible strains [19] . As far as we know, the bioactivity of the 3\u2032-N-demethylated derivative (ID 992, see Scheme 1) of gentamicin C1 (a naturally occurring broad-spectrum antibiotic) has never been recorded. However in accordance with the literature we expect that this derivative may be active since it carries a methyl group on N-6\u2032, which appears to be responsible for the resistance to N-acetyltransferase enzymes as referred for the gentamicin C1 and C2b [19] . The aklavinone glycoside, ID 860 Scheme 1, is a parent aglycone of an extensive family of glycosidically derived anthracycline antibiotics possessing significant anticancer activity, although the specific activity of this M b NP has not yet been reported. The aglycone, luteolin, of the flavonoid, luteolin-7-O-\u03b2-glucoside (ID 917, Scheme 1) has been shown to inhibit a series of human cancer cell lines [20, 21] (renal A-549, ovary SK-OV-3, melanoma SK-MEL-2, XF-498, HCT15, gastric HGC-27), breast MCF-7 [22] and human leukemia cells [23] . More recently, additional antitumor assays have suggested that luteolin-7-O-\u03b2-glucoside could be an interesting antitumor NP, even more active in the breast adenocarcinoma cell than its aglycone [24] . Although the bioactivity of the MNP, ID154, has never been recorded, the high toxicity of those cortinarin derivatives was extensively reported [25] .",

            "text": "Taking into account the MeanDecreaseAccuracy measure in the RF model for predicting the overall biological activity, antitumor and antibiotic activities it is possible to correlate those activities with the type of descriptors selected. For instance, the overall biological activity appears to be related with the electronic and molecular descriptors. The CPSA, BCUT and WHIM descriptors seem to have a main role in modeling the overall activity. The BCUT descriptors encode connectivity information and atomic properties of the molecule [45] . The WHIM descriptors are weighted holistic invariant molecular descriptors that are built in such a way to capture relevant molecular 3D information with respect to molecular size, shape, symmetry and atom distribution [46] . While the antitumor activity appears to be largely related with the topological descriptors. In addition, the molecular distance edge descriptors (MDE), which evaluate molecular distance edge descriptors for carbon, nitrogen and oxygen atoms, seems to be the most important type of the descriptors for modeling the antitumor activity (4 MDE descriptors out of the ten most important descriptors). Only the MDEO-12 (molecular distance edge between primary and secondary oxygen atoms) and the khs.sssCH (a fragment count descriptor that encode the presence of a tertiary carbon group in which it has three single bonds) descriptors were selected for all machine learning techniques (i.e., CFS filter for SVM, the two measures of the RF, and CT). The MDEO-12 is the most important descriptors for the MeanDecreaseAccuracy parameter in the RF model and it is as well the first descriptor selected to build the antitumor classification tree (see a graphical representation of the first two rules of the antitumor tree in Figure 2 ). Using the first rule of the antitumor tree (MDEO-12 < 0.999 for antitumor compounds and MDEO-12 \u2265 0.999 for non-antitumor compounds) it was possible to correctly discriminate antitumor/non-antitumor 751/508 compounds, corresponding to ~70% of the training set and 372/245 compounds, corresponding to ~68% of the test set I. Training and test set I with 918/886 and 456/446 antitumor/non-antitumor compounds, respectively. The results were even impressive when only the -MDEO-12 < 0.999\u2016 rule was applied-from the 918 antitumor compounds 751 were correctly classified, ~82%, for the training set and 372 out of 456, ~82%, for the test set I. Only two of 16 lead-like antitumor MNPs and M b NPs that we had already proposed are classified as non-antitumor (IDs 567 and 580) by this rule. The remarkable performance of this descriptor in discriminating between antitumor and non-antitumor compounds has never been reported, however it was reported the importance of MDE descriptors in modeling chemical reactivity parameters [47] , platelet-derived growth factor (PDGFR) inhibitors [48] , Factor Xa inhibitors [48] , cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors [48] , and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) inhibitors [49] . The MDEO-12 descriptor is known to codify the molecular size by taking into account oxygen atoms also characterizes polarity [48] . Inspection of the compounds belonging to the training set reveals that this descriptor provides an indication of the presence of oxygen-containing groups such glycosyl, amide, lactam, ester or lactone together with hydroxyl, carboxylic acid or ether functional groups. For example the aminoglycoside antibiotic, CID 215651, from the training set (see Scheme 5), has a high MDEO-12 descriptor value of 11.20.",

Six descriptors were selected for all machine learning techniques-one electronic (TopoPSA), two topological (MDEO-12 and MDEC-22-molecular distance edge between secondary carbon atoms), two constitutional (khs.sssCH, khs.dssC-a fragment count descriptor that codifies the presence of a quaternary carbon group in which it has two single bonds and one double bond), and one molecular (C2SP2-counts the number of sp2 secondary carbon atoms). The TopoPSA is the most important descriptor for the MeanDecreaseGini parameter in the RF model and it is as well the first descriptor selected to build the antibiotic tree (see a graphical representation of the antibiotic tree first rule in Figure 3) . Using the first rule of the antibiotic tree (TopoPSA \u2265 120.7 for antibiotic compounds and TopoPSA < 120.7 for non-antibiotic compounds) it was possible to correctly discriminate 509/888 and 267/416 antibiotic/non-antibiotic compounds for the training set (654/1150) and test set I (338/564), respectively. Subsequently the TopoPSA descriptor presents similar results for both antibiotic and non-antibiotic classes differently to the antitumor CT model where the MDEO-12 descriptor shows impressive discrimination ability only relatively to the antitumor compounds. Globally 1397 out of 1804 compounds, ~77%, were correctly classified by this rule with 509 out of 654 antibiotic compounds, 77%, and 888 out of 1150 non-antibiotic compounds, ~77%, correctly classified for the training set. Similar results were obtained for the test set I. Only three M b NP of 57 lead-like antibiotic MNPs and M b NPs that we had already proposed are classified as non-antibiotic (IDs 128, 483, 977) by this rule. In spite of the predictive power of the TopoPSA descriptor for modeling the antibiotic activity has never been reported, its importance in predicting P-glycoprotein [50] and cytochrome P450 [51] inhibitors was already noticed. Moreover, the high correlations of this descriptor with passive drug transport through membranes [43] and drug transport by multidrug resistance associated protein 1 (MRP1/ABCC1) [52] were also reported.",

This heuristic takes into account the usefulness of individual descriptors for predicting the activitiy (i.e., overall biological, antitumor, or antibiotic) together with the level of intercorrelation among them. The experiments for comparing the descriptors for each one of three models were conducted with the AttributeSelectedClassifier routine of Weka with the CfsSubsetEval option as descriptor evaluator and the BestFirst or GreedyStepwise option as search method.

Each node is produced by a logical rule, usually defined for a single descriptor, where objects below a certain descriptor's value fall into one of the two child nodes, and objects above fall into the other child node. The prediction for a compound reaching a given terminal node is obtained by a majority vote of the objects (in the training set) reaching the same terminal node.

The best split at each node was defined among a randomly selected subset of descriptors. Prediction is made by a majority vote of the classification trees in the forest. Additionally, performance is internally assessed with the prediction error for the objects left outin the bootstrap procedure (internal cross-validation or OOB estimation). The method quantifies the importance of a descriptor by the increase in misclassification occurring when the values of the descriptor are randomly permuted, correlated with the mean decrease in accuracy parameter, or by the decrease in a node's impurity every time the descriptor is used for splitting, correlated with the mean decrease in the Gini coefficient parameter. RFs also assign a probability to every prediction on the basis of the number of votes obtained by the predicted class. A measure of similarity between two objects can be calculated from the number of trees in the ensemble that classify the two objects in the same terminal node. RFs were grown with the R program, version 2.13.1, using the Random Forest library [63] . The RF models were built with 500 trees and using the set of 232 CDK descriptors. As a result of the nature of two-class imbalance in the overall activity model, this problem was alleviated setting the class weights to 50:50.",

In this study, SVM were established with the Weka 3.6.5 program, using the LIBSVM package [65] [66] [67] [68] . The type of SVM was set to C-SVM-classification and the kernel function was the radial basis function. The parameter C of the C-SVM-classification was optimized in the range of 10-500 and the default \u03b3 parameter in the kernel function was used.
