In spite of intense study, it remains unclear whether the deletion actually reflects adaptation to humans. Here we engineered full, partially deleted (\u221229 nt), and fully deleted ORF8 into a SARS-CoV infectious cDNA clone, strain Frankfurt-1. Replication of the resulting viruses was compared in primate cell cultures as well as Rhinolophus bat cells made permissive for SARS-CoV replication by lentiviral transduction of the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor. Cells from cotton rat, goat, and sheep provided control scenarios that represent host systems in which SARS-CoV is neither endemic nor epidemic. Independent of the cell system, the truncation of ORF8 (29 nt deletion) decreased replication up to 23fold. The effect was independent of the type I interferon response. The 29 nt deletion in SARS-CoV is a deleterious mutation acquired along the initial human-to-human transmission chain. The resulting loss of fitness may be due to a founder effect, which has rarely been documented in processes of viral emergence. These results have important implications for the retrospective assessment of the threat posed by SARS.",

The variant termed rSCV epi corresponds to isolates from the main phase (also referred to as middle and late phases) of the epidemic containing a 29 nt deletion that introduces a ribosomal frameshift separating ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b. Two alternative virus variants without ORF8 were constructed. Variant 1, rSCV del8-1 , had ORF8 removed without any replacement. Variant 2, rSCV del8-2 , had ORF8 replaced by a 5 nt spacer sequence (AATAA) which occurs instead of ORF8 between ORF7b and the nucleocapsid gene in a natural SARS-related CoV variant from European rhinolophid bats 13 .",

Table 1 . Bat specimens included in this study and confirmation of absence of ORF8. Absence of ORF8 was determined by RT-PCR using reverse primers F29260R (TTTGTATGCGTCAATGTGCTTG) for reverse transcription and F28182R (GGGTCCACCAAATGTAATGCGG) and forward primer F27626F (GAGAAAGACAGAATGAATGAGC) for PCR. Variants of the open reading frame 8 (ORF8) were designed in accordance to their appearance in nature. (a) rSCV 8full represents a single ORF8 as found in reservoir bats and amplification hosts in China, as well as in the early phase of the SARS epidemic. The middle phase of the epidemic was dominated by a virus variant carrying a 29 nt deletion resulting in the disruption of ORF8 in 2 reading frames, 8a and 8b, as seen in rSCV epi . The absence of ORF8 is a genomic feature of reservoir bats in Europe and the epidemic virus in the late phase. Two deletion variants were constructed. Variant 1, rSCV del8-1 , perfectly misses ORF8. In variant 2, rSCV del8-2 , ORF8 is replaced by the short substitutional sequence AATAA in accordance to the upstream region of the nucleocapsid gene of the European SARS-related bat-CoV BtCoV/BM48-31/Rhi bla/Bulgaria/2008 (NC_014470). (b) Plaque morphology of rSCV 8full and rSCV epi were very similar, while rSCV del8-1 produced only diffuse and rSCV del8-2 reduced plaques. Western Blot analysis revealed that only rSCV 8full , rSCV epi , and rSCV del8-2 infected cells expressed the nucleocapsid protein, while none could be detected in cells infected with rSCV del8-1 . Detection of \u03b2 actin served as loading control. Virus replication of the three ORF8 variants, (rSCV del8 = rSCV del8-2 ) was monitored by plaque titration after infection of VeroFM cells at two different multiplicities of infection, 1 (c) and 0.001 (d).",

Because bats of the genus Rhinolophus are the bona-fide animal reservoir for SARS-related CoV 2 , an epithelial cell line was generated from the lung of Rhinolophus alcyone (Fig. 3a) . One pregnant female individual was euthanized and embryonal tissues were prepared using techniques described previously (Fig. 3b) [31] [32] [33] . The resulting immortalized Rhinolophus lung cell culture, termed RhiLu, clearly expressed cytokeratin as a marker for epithelium (Fig. 3c) , and hardly showed any expression of the fibroblast marker S-100A4 (Fig. 3d) , suggesting that the cell culture mainly contains epithelial cells. Initial infection experiments in RhiLu cells identified these cells to be non-permissive for SARS-CoV infection. By use of VSV-G protein-pseudotyped lentiviral particles, RhiLu cells were therefore transduced with the gene for the SARS-CoV entry receptor, human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), and selected to stably express hACE2 upon co-expression of a puromycin resistance gene from the same lentiviral vector. Chromosomal To determine the RhiLu cell type the epithelial protein marker cytokeratin (c) and the fibroblast marker S-100A4 (d) were detected by immunofluorescence assay using mouse-anti cytokeratin or rabbit-anti S-100A4 Ig. Secondary detection was performed by incubating with goat-anti-mouse cyanin 2-or goat-anti-rabbit cyanin 3-labeled Igs. The bars represent 20 \u00b5m. (e) Integration of hACE2 into the genome of RhiLu cells was verified by PCR. The vector containing the hACE2-puromycin resistance gene construct was used as a PCR positive control. (f) Expression of hACE2 was confirmed by Western blot analysis using mouse anti-hACE2 Ig (1:1,000). In addition, \u03b2 actin protein was detected using rabbit anti-\u03b2-actin Ig (1:2,000) to ensure that similar protein amounts were applied. MA104 cells, expressing hACE2 naturally, served as positive control. (g) Virus replication of rSCV 8full , rSCV epi and rSCV del8 was observed by titration of supernatants sampled at 24, 48, and 72 hpi. Cells were infected in triplicates at an MOI of 0.001.

Replication differences were levelled off by 48 hpi, when all viruses reached the plateau of replication. Of note, the utilized cell cultures in total represent hosts from four different orders of Euarchontoglires and Laurasiatheria, the two main groups of mammals.",

The gradual deletion of ORF8 constituted the most obvious change in SARS-CoV after emergence. Because few changes occurred in other parts of the genome, we have focused our study on ORF8 and kept the rest of the genome constant representing the sequence of SARS-CoV strain Frankfurt-1. This prototype virus was isolated from the late phase of the SARS-CoV epidemic when transmission chains already occurred in countries outside China 36 . Even in this late epidemic strain, a reconstitution of the full ORF8 reading frame led to an increased replicative capability, suggesting that the viral genome was still compatible with its primordial ORF8 element in spite of possible onward evolution in humans 9 .",

The phenotypic difference depends on the presence of full ORF8, with enhanced replication as opposed to the deletion variant. Earlier experiments in which no clear differences in replication have been noted were aimed at the identification of strong attenuation markers as necessary for live vaccine development, and hence worked at very high MOIs at or above 1 22 . We have also included such high MOIs in our experiments for comparison, and our results were highly concordant with those earlier studies. For instance, like in the study by Yount et al. 22 , differences between viruses with full ORF8 and 29nt deletions were only about three-fold at MOI = 1. Natural infection, however, does not involve high virus doses 37 . When a virus is passed from human to human, the stochastic nature of infection success implicates that inocula just below or above one unit of human-infectious virus are transmitted. For instance, during influenza A transmission in ferrets as few as 2 virus units were transmitted between animals 38 . Under conditions of inter-host transmission, the observed phenotypic differences as observed in our study may have significant effects on viral fitness 37 .",

This interpretation contrasts with the earlier notion that the 29 nt deletion reflects adaptation to humans. The conclusion of adaptation is partly based on results from expression of ORF8 or its truncation products in overexpression systems or expression in heterologous virus genomes, suggesting various influences on virus-cell interaction [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . For instance, one study provided evidence for IFN evasion mediated by ORF8b 17 . This is not confirmed by our experiments studying ORF8 in full virus context. Other authors have proposed that the 29 nt deletion may have been neutral for fitness after viral host transition to humans, assuming that ORF8 may elicit a function that is only relevant in the bat host 9, 22 . However, we have not observed any bat-specific effects in cell culture, and rather show that ORF8 optimizes fitness irrespective of the host cell system, including hosts that are irrelevant for the SARS-CoV chain of emergence 11 . Our experiments suggest that only the deletion of further portions after initial fragmentation of ORF8 may have been neutral to fitness. Such deletions were seen during very late phases of the SARS epidemic in Hong Kong 9 .",

The available studies leave it open whether these deletions involved changes of replication level or virulence. However, it is known that ORF4a acts as an effective antagonist of MDA5-dependent induction of type I IFN 44 , and that MERS-CoV is highly sensitive against type I IFN in human airway epithelial cultures 45 . Based on these known mechanisms, attenuation rather than human adaptation should be considered. Our results are also relevant in the context of a series of experimental studies recently conducted to understand potential adaptive changes in the 2014 Ebola virus Makona outbreak in West Africa. Whereas initial studies suggested human adaptation with increase of replication level during the outbreak 46-50 , later studies found that a late-outbreak strain rather caused reduced virulence and prolonged survival of experimental animals 51 .

On an individual level, however, a reduction of replication level is likely to attenuate the pathogenicity of infection and reduce the health burden caused by a given outbreak.",

            "text": "It may be seen as a weakness in our present study that no experimental animals were infected as in Marzi et al. However, mouse models of SARS-CoV do not reflect human disease as accurate as macaques do for Ebola virus, and the HAE culture system used in the present study already provides an appropriate model for the authentic site of replication of SARS-CoV in the human body (Ebola virus infection cannot be modeled by organ-specific cultures). Moreover, the infection phenotypes as seen in our study for ORF8 full and ORF8 epi have already been demonstrated in mice, and the corresponding effects in cell culture based on those variants have been reproduced in our study 22 . We have therefore avoided additional animal experimentation and focused on human epithelial models with low inoculation doses such as seen in natural infections. Our data suggest that SARS-CoV has suffered an attenuating mutation by the 29 nt deletion that constitutes a landmark genetic change. The SARS epidemic in 2003 may have taken a more severe course if not involving this mutation. Further work, including work in experimental animals, will be required to understand and confirm whether the absence of ORF8 in European bat-associated SARSr-CoV correctly predicts lesser epidemic risks as compared to Asian strains.",

All animal handling and sampling was done by trained personnel, with animal safety and comfort as the first priority during minimally invasive sampling (collection of faeces). Bat species were identified on site and, if necessary, mitochondrial DNA in representative fecal samples was amplified and sequenced for species confirmation as described previously 54 . Captured bats were freed from nets immediately and put into cotton bags for 2 to 15 min to allow them to calm down before examination. While being kept in bags, bats produced fecal pellets that were transferred to 500 \u00b5l RNAlater RNA stabilization solution (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) for sample processing. After homogenization, 50 \u00b5l of the suspension was resuspended in 560 \u00b5l of buffer AVL from the Qiagen viral RNA minikit and processed according to manufacturers instructions.
