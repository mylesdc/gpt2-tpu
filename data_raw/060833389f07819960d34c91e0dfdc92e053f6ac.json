The RNA silencing pathway is an intracellular innate response to viral infections. However, it is unknown whether PRRSV interacts with cellular RNA silencing to facilitate the viral infection. Here, we report for the first time the interaction between PRRSV and RNA silencing in both the porcine macrophages and African green monkey kidney cell line (MARC-145) cell line, which were derived from African green monkey kidney cells and highly permissive for PRRSV infection. Our data demonstrated that PRRSV suppressed RNA silencing induced by short-hairpin (sh) RNA, double-strand (ds) RNA and microRNA (miRNA) and downregulated the expression of argonaute protein-2 (Ago-2), which is a key protein of the RNA silencing pathway in animal cells. Further, exogenous introduction of siRNA and shRNA downregulated Dicer or Ago-2 proteins of the cellular RNA silencing apparatus in MARC-145 cells and porcine macrophages, which, in turn, increased the viral replication and titers. The viral non-structure protein 1\u03b1 (nsp-1\u03b1) and nsp11 of PRRSV were identified as the suppressors for cellular RNA silencing (RSSs) to downregulate the Ago-2 protein. Our results identify that PRRSV, through its nsp proteins, suppresses the cellular RNA silencing apparatus in favor of viral infection and supports a co-evolutionary process of the virus and the cellular RNA silencing process.",

The cellular miRNA genes could encode the endogenous cellular miRNAs [3, 4] . Because the structures of short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) are similar to the structures of pre-miRNAs, shRNAs are used as the precursor molecules of siRNA in cells.",

During virus infection, the anti-viral activity of RNA silencing could be activated by the emergence of virus-specific dsRNA or miRNA, finally destroying the RNA of the virus. However, during the co-evolutionary process of the virus and the cellular RNA silencing process, the viruses have produced suppressors of RNA silencing (RSSs) to overcome the anti-viral RNA silencing [8, 9] . Furthermore, accumulating evidence suggested that RNA silencing might also be an important innate antiviral immunity in vertebrates [5, [10] [11] [12] . Firstly, the RNA silencing pathway in mammal cells is competent. Secondly, small RNAs induced by the virus have been identified in several animal viruses [13] . Thirdly, inactivation of Dicer could influence the replication of animal viruses [9, [14] [15] [16] . Finally, many animal viruses encoded RSSs to inhibit RNA silencing [5] .",

The virus genome could induce an RNAi-based antiviral response, since the viral genome could form a double-stranded RNA intermediate, local secondary structures and overlapping virus transcripts during viral replication. It is worth debating whether the RNA silencing also plays an important role in controlling animal virus, and more and more evidence indicates that RNA silencing is also a part of the innate immunity of animals to the virus [5, 10] . For example, Chinnappan et al. [9] have found that both downregulation of Dicer and Ago-2 enhanced HBV replication, and the viral titers of HBV were negatively correlated with the mRNA levels of Dicer and Ago-2; in a further study, it was found that the HBx protein was the important RSS of HBV. Maillard et al. [11] showed that ablating a Nodamura virus (NoV)-encoded RSS could deregulate viral replication, while a Dicer-deficient mouse cell line could rescue this mutant NoV and enhanced NoV replication.",

The experimental results showed that PRRSV could suppress the RNA silencing induced by shRNA, dsRNA and miRNA (Figure 1 ), so it was reasonable to speculate that PRRSV modified the antiviral response of RNA silencing if the RNA silencing could be a partial anti-PRRSV response. Thereby, we tested whether the RNA silencing could be a part of the anti-PRRSV response. Because the proteins Dicer and Ago-2 are the cellular RNA silencing apparatus for shRNA, dsRNA and miRNA-induced RNA silencing, both silencing Dicer and silencing Ago-2 enhanced PRRSV replication (Figures 2-4) , which indicated that RNA silencing could be a defense system against PRRSV. Therefore, our present work provides new evidence that RNA silencing may be as an antiviral immunity to the invading virus in mammal cells.",

Our present work found that PRRSV could downregulate the expression of Ago-2 ( Figure 4E ,F), and the nsp1\u03b1 and nsp11 of PRRSV could also downregulate the expression of Ago-2 ( Figure 5 ), which indicates that PRRSV inhibited the RNA silencing by influencing the expression of the key protein of the RNAi pathway.",

Similar to the above results, this work not only showed that the PRRSV nsp1\u03b1 and nsp11 were the RSSs, but also demonstrated that the activity of PCP\u03b1 and the activity of endoribonuclease were respectively required for nsp1\u03b1 and nsp11 as the RSSs ( Figure 5 ). In fact, the relationship between the IFN pathway and the RNA silencing pathway may be an interesting topic in the future, since it suggests that the RNA silencing and the IFN pathway are overlapping. Firstly, some viral components antagonize both the RNA silencing and IFN response. For example, the most discovered RSSs were also the antagonists of type I interferon [5] . Secondly, some miRNA could be induced by IFN cytokine, and miRNA could regulate the IFN system. Thirdly, adenosine deaminase acting on the production of miRNA was also an effector of the IFN system. Therefore, the relationship between RNA silencing and the IFN system suggests that both RNA silencing and the IFN system were the first line against animal virus infections. However, the detailed mechanism of the interaction between RNA silencing and the IFN system deserves further study.",
