For it is a never been experienced respiratory disease before and with infection ability widely and quickly, it attracted the world's attention but without treatment and control manual. For the request from frontline clinicians and public health professionals of 2019-nCoV infected pneumonia management, an evidence-based guideline urgently needs to be developed. Therefore, we drafted this guideline according to the rapid advice guidelines methodology and general rules of WHO guideline development; we also added the first-hand management data of Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University. This guideline includes the guideline methodology, epidemiological characteristics, disease screening and population prevention, diagnosis, treatment and control (including traditional Chinese Medicine), nosocomial infection prevention and control, and disease nursing of the 2019-nCoV. Moreover, we also provide a whole process of a successful treatment case of the severe 2019-nCoV infected pneumonia and experience and lessons of hospital rescue for 2019-nCoV infections. This rapid advice guideline is suitable for the first frontline doctors and nurses, managers of hospitals and healthcare sections, community residents, public health persons, relevant researchers, and all person who are interested in the 2019-nCoV.",

However, when patients had hypercapnia (acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiogenic pulmonary edema), hemodynamic instability, multiple organ failure, and abnormal mental status HFNO oxygen is not the routinely adopted measure. If respiratory failure cannot be improved or worsens continuously within a short time (1 h) after using HFNO or NIV, intubation should be performed immediately. Low tidal volume (4-8 ml/kg) and low suction pressure (platform pressure < 30cmH 2 O) are used for invasive mechanical ventilation. It is suggested that positive endexpiratory pressure (PEEP) with high positive endexpiratory pressure should be used in patients with moderate or severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, and PEEP should be titrated according to FiO 2 to maintain SpO 2 , in order to improve alveolar atelectasis and reduce alveolar hyper-expansion and pulmonary vascular resistance at the end of inspiration.

Accurate RNA detection of 2019-nCoV is with diagnostic value (Strong recommendation). The RNA of 2019-nCoV positive in the throat swab sampling or other respiratory tract sampling by fluorescence quantitative PCR method, especially that from multiple samples and detection kits, excluding sample quality, sample collection time, contaminatory and technical problems, is of great support for etiological diagnosis. (4) Other laboratory testing. There are other laboratory tests for the status of 2019-nCoV infection, including blood gas analysis, liver and kidney function, myocardial enzyme, myoglobin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), Procalcitonin (PCT), lactate, D-dimer, coagulation image, urine routine test, inflammatory factors (interleukin(IL)-6, IL-10, TNF -\u03b1), 11 items of tuberculosis (TB) subgroup, complement, anti-acid staining, etc. Blood gas analysis is helpful to judge the oxygenation of moderately-illed and severe patients. Combining the increase of lactic acid, it is feasible to screen the patients with high-risk of oxygenation disorder. Some infected patients have increased liver enzymes, muscle enzyme, ESR and myoglobin. The detection of CRP and PCT is of certain value to distinguish whether there was bacterial infection in the lung. D-dimer of most severe patients was significantly increased in this epidemic, with frequent clotting disorders and microthrombotic formation in peripheral blood",
