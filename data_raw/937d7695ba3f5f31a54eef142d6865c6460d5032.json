            "text": "Background: Patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) often experience acute exacerbation (AE) after an episode of common cold. Aims: To establish a mouse model of virus infection-induced AE-IPF and investigate the mechanism underlying the AE-IPF. Methods: Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1) was inoculated intranasally to wild-type (WT) and IL-17A gene knockout (IL-17A -/-) mice 21 days after intratracheal administration of bleomycin (BLM). Results: HSV1 infection caused acute exacerbation in mice with BLM-induced fibrosis. Compared with the BLM+Saline mice, the mice with BLM+HSV1 showed significantly higher acute lung injury (ALI) score (P < 0.0001), lower survival rate (100% vs 21.4%, P < 0.0001), poorer lung function and higher inflammatory response representing by increased total inflammatory cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) (P = 0.0323), increased proportion of Th17 cells in peripheral blood (P = 0.0004) and higher inflammatory factors in BALF. In addition, HSV1 infection increased the expression of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS)-related proteins in mice with BLMinduced fibrosis. The inhibition of ERS by tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA, an ERS inhibitor) significantly reduced the IL-17A levels in BALF (P = 0.0140) and TH17 cells in the peripheral blood (P = 0.0084) of mice with BLM+HSV1, suggesting that suppression of ERS may reduce TH17 response in mice with AE-IPF. Compared with WT mice with BLM+HSV1, IL-17A -/mice with BLM+HSV1 had lower ALI score (P = 0.0119), higher survival rate (78.6% vs 21.4%, P = 0.004), improved lung function, and milder inflammatory response. Conclusions: HSV1 infection in addition to BLM-induced IPF can successfully establish AE-IPF in mice. IL-17A and ERS promote lung inflammation in AE-IPF development. K E Y W O R D S acute exacerbations of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, endoplasmic reticulum stress, herpes simplex virus 1, interleukin-17A Tao Chen, Hui Qiu and Meng-Meng Zhao contributed equally to this work.",

The natural course of IPF shows several clinical characteristics: such as slow progression, long-term stable stage and acute exacerbation of IPF (AE-IPF). Approximately 1%-20% of patients with IPF develop AE-IPF within 1 year. [1] [2] [3] The clinical presentation of AE-IPF is characterized by acute respiratory difficulty within 30 days, lung histopathology showing diffuse alveolar damages in addition to fibrosis, >50% mortality rate and median survival time of only 2-4 months. 1,2 AE-IPF-associated deaths account for 46% of the total deaths of patients with IPF. 1 Thus, AE-IPF is the leading cause of death in patients with IPF.",

Analyses using pan-viral microarray and multiplex polymerase chain reaction have found the common respiratory viruses in the respiratory track of patients with AE-IPF, such as cytomegalovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, rhinovirus and coronavirus. 4, 5 A previous epidemiological study has shown that AE-IPF occurs frequently in winter and spring and in patients using immunosuppressants, 6 indicating that virus infection may be a critical factor contributing to AE-IPF. Studies using animal models have also demonstrated that mammal herpes virus \u03b3HV-68 infection in addition to lung fibrosis can exacerbate the lung fibrosis. 7, 8 However, animal models of infection-induced AE-IPF have not been established, which seriously limits the investigation on the biological mechanisms and therapeutic intervention of AE-IPF.",

Each mouse in the Saline+HSV1, BLM+HSV1, and BLM+HSV1+TUDCA groups was inoculated intranasally with 10 \u03bcL of the HSV1 suspension for four times, and each mouse in the Sali-ne+Saline and BLM+Saline groups was administered with the equal volume of saline. According to the description by Keestra-Gounder et al, 12 each mouse in the BLM+HSV1+TUDCA group received daily intraperitoneal injection of TUDCA (250 mg/kg; Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany) after the intranasal inoculation of HSV1. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected on post-HSV1-infection day 3 (day 24 after the BLM administration) and day 7 (day 28 after the BLM administration) and centrifuged at 200 g for 5 minutes and the supernatant was harvested and stored at \u221280\u00b0C for future experiments. Left lung tissue was frozen at \u221280\u00b0C. Part of the right lung tissue was used to determine wet to dry weight ratio; the remaining right lung tissue was fixed in a standard tissue fixation solution (Wuhan Goodbio Technology Co. Ltd, Wuhan, China) for hematoxylin and eosin (H & E) and Masson staining. The mice used to collect the BALF and lung tissue were from two batches of experiments, but modelled in the same way. Therefore, the lung tissues used for wet to dry ratios and histopathology were not perfused by saline.",

The Kaplan-Merier method was used to plot survival curve, and the survival time was compared by the logrank test. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Figure 1A ,B). Lung tissue inflammation in the WT+BLM+HSV1 group was worse than that in the WT+BLM+Saline and the worst on day 28. On day 28, the WT+BLM+HSV1 mice presented typical AE-IPF characteristics, including alveolar septal congestion and oedema, inflammatory cell infiltration in the lung tissue, alveolar epithelial damages and apparent transparent membrane structure in the alveolar cavity ( Figure 1A ). The IL-17A -/-+BLM+HSV1 mice showed less inflammatory cell infiltration in the lung tissue than the WT+BLM+HSV1 mice ( Figure 1B ). The BLM+HSV1 group had a significantly higher ALI score than the BLM+Saline group (P < 0.0001, Figures 1C, S5) , and the IL-17A -/-+BLM+HSV1 mice showed significantly lower ALI score than the WT+BLM+HSV1 mice (P = 0.0159, Figure 1C ). BLM+HSV1 mice developed severe inflammation and formed dense aggregates of inflammatory cells after 1 week of HSV1 infection, which looks like the fibrosis foci, thus, Masson staining seemed as if the WT+BLM+HSV1 mice might develop more severe fibrosis than the WT+BLM+Saline mice ( Figure 1D ), but the fibrosis score was not statistically significantly different ( Figure 1E ). In addition, hydroxyproline content measurement also demonstrated similar results ( Figure S2 ). These data suggest that HSV1 infection may stimulate acute lung damages in short-term but may not exacerbate BLM-induced fibrosis substantially. In addition, HSV1 infection alone can also cause acute inflammation in lung tissue, which is IL-17dependent ( Figure S4 ).",

As far as we know, some innate immune cells such as \u03b3\u03b4T and ILC3 cells can also produce IL-17A in the innate primary immune responses. 24 In our preliminary study, we found that patients with AE-IPF had higher TH17 levels in peripheral blood than patients with stable-IPF (data not shown). Thus, in the current study, we focused on the roles of Th17 cells in the AE-IPF model. In our current study, we cannot exclude the effects of IL-17A produced by other cells such as \u03b3\u03b4T and ILC3 cells, because compared to WT mice, IL1-7A -/mice might have different levels of IL-17A-producing \u03b3\u03b4T cells and ILC3 cells.",

However, excessive UPR may trigger inflammatory responses. 30 A previous study has found the concurrence of herpes virus infection and UPR in the alveolar epithelial cells of patients with IPF, suggesting that virus infection may contribute to alveolar epithelial injury by exacerbating ERS. 15 The current study found that compared with the mice treated with BLM+Saline, the mice treated with BLM+HSV1 demonstrated significantly elevated expression of UPRrelated proteins and particularly higher CHOP expression in lung tissue. The three signalling pathways involved in UPR: PERK, IRE-1, and ATF6, can all induce CHOP overexpression. 31 In our study, ATF4 and ATF6 overexpression was quite obvious in the mice treated with BLM+HSV1. Jane and colleagues have found that CHOP can act as a transcription factor to co-ordinate NF-\u03baB to stimulate IL-23p19 expression synergistically. 32 Our previous study has demonstrated that ERS occurs in AEC. In our previous study, we used alveolar epithelial cells (A549) to establish AE-IPF cell model, and found that HSV1 infection stimulated the ER stress pathways in AEC in a timeand dose-dependent manner. 11 In the current study, the mice treated with BLM+HSV1 had increased IL-23 levels in the BALF compared with the mice treated with BLM+Saline. IL-23 binds to the IL-23 receptor on na\u00efve CD4 + T cells to induce the CD4 + T cells to differentiate into TH17 cells, consequently increasing IL-17A concentration. 33, 34 In addition, we found when ERS was inhibited by TUDCA, the proportion of Th17 cells in mouse peripheral blood was reduced;",

Our findings indicate that inhibition of ERS can alleviate lung inflammation, and it probably takes effects by reducing IL-17A production. However, a previous study on respiratory syncytial virus infection in animal models suggests that ERS in lung tissue increases IRE-1expression, resulting in caspase-1 cleavage and mature IL-1\u03b2 production. This enhanced IL-1\u03b2 secretion might account for the aggravation of inflammation. 35 While in a report on LPS-induced acute lung injury, ERS can activate NF-\u03baB, 36 then it can promote kinds of cytokines' secretion, such as IL-6, IL-23, IL-17A, KC and G-CSF. Till now there has not been a study identifying which pathway plays a critical role, more work should be done to explore the relationship between ER stress and inflammation. In addition, the study also suggests that anti-IL-17A antibody treatment and IL-17A gene knockout alleviate UPR in lung tissue substantially, supporting that IL-17A may promote ERS in lung tissue 36 (Figure 7 ).",

HSV1 was inoculated intranasally to the mice that already developed BLM-induced lung fibrosis. One week after the HSV1 infection, the mice showed obvious diffuse lung injury, higher ALI score than mice with stable BLM-induced lung fibrosis, exacerbated lung oedema, increased protein contents in the alveolar cavity, dimin-ished lung function and reduced survival. These HSV1 infectioninduced histological and functional exacerbations in mice with BLM-IPF resemble the clinical presentations of patients with AE-IPF, such as diffuse lung injury, diminished lung function and reduced survival rate, supporting that BLM+HSV1 treatment can mimic AE-IPF development closely. Previous studies have shown that nasal inoculation of \u03b3HV68 virus in addition to lung fibrosis results in lung infection-stimulated exacerbation of the lung fibrosis. 7,8 Notably, because \u03b3HV68 is a mammalian virus that infects animals but not humans, \u03b3HV68 infection in addition to lung fibrosis may not mimic the AE-IPF development in human.

This might be explained by the demonstrated fact that the formation of obvious lung fibrosis appears between 14 and 28 days after a single-dose administration of bleomycin in mice,23 however, Wilson and colleagues drew the conclusion by evaluating fibrosis in 7 days after administrating BLM and this has been proved to be an acute inflammatory period. In contrast, we observed the similar degree of fibrosis and hydroxyproline content in WT+BLM+Saline and IL-17A -/-+BLM+Saline groups in 28 days after administration of BLM. These suggested that IL-17A might contribute to acute lung injury but not fibrosis in our study. Sandra et al24 showed similar conclusion in their previous study. They found that in experimental silicosis the acute alveolitis induced by silica is IL-17A dependent, but this cytokine appears dispensable for the development of the late fibrotic lung responses to silica.

Compared with the WT mice, the IL-17A -/mice showed reduced G-CSF and KC concentrations in the BALF, fewer inflammatory monocytes and neutrophils in the BALF, attenuated lung inflammation and dysfunction and higher survival rate. Although IL-17A -/-+BLM+HSV1 mice showed significantly higher ALI score than the IL-17A -/-+BLM+Saline mice, the total protein in BALF of the two groups did not show significant differences. IL-17A knockout leads to a reduction in the number of infiltrated inflammatory monocytes and neutrophils in BALF. Fewer inflammatory monocytes & neutrophils in the BALF of IL-17A -/-+BLM+HSV1 group could result in milder HSV1 infection-induced alveolar epithelial injury and thus less plasma protein exudation. On the other hand, total protein in BALF is just one of the indexes to evaluate ALI. As reported by Mikawa et al, 13 ALI score mainly emphasizes the levels of inflammatory cell infiltration. IL-17A knockout obviously reduced the number of inflammatory monocytes and neutrophils in BALF (Figure 3I). However, inflammatory monocytes and neutrophils only accounted for a small proportion of inflammatory cells (0.167%) in the BALF of IL-17A -/-+ BLM+HSV1 mice. Other inflammatory cells might contribute to a higher ALI score. Nevertheless, IL-17A -/-+BLM+HSV1 mice showed significantly lower ALI score than the WT+BLM+HSV1 mice F I G U R E 7 Cartoon diagram showing the hypothesis that IL-17A and ERS contribute to HSV1 infection-induced AE-IPF. We concluded three possible mechanisms in this model. In mouse lung tissue, BLM-mediated lung fibrosis stimulates ERS. (1) In addition to the existing ERS, HSV1 infection further exacerbates ERS and increases CHOP expression. CHOP, as a transcription factor, elevates the secretion of inflammatory factors, such as IL-23. IL-23 then promotes IL-17A release. IL-17A can enhance ERS by a positive feedback mechanism so to induce acute inflammatory reactions and acute lung damages. (2) Exacerbated ERS might increase IRE-1 expression, resulting in caspase-1 cleavage and mature IL-1\u03b2 production. This enhanced IL-1\u03b2 secretion stimulates further IL-17A production from CD4+ effector T cells through IL-1 receptor signalling. (3) ER stress increases cytokine secretion (IL-6, IL-17A, IL-23, KC and G-CSF) by activating NF-\u03baB. These cytokines contribute to HSV1-induced acute inflammation in fibrotic lung(",
