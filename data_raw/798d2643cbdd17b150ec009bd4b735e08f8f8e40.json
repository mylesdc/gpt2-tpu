            "text": "Glycoprotein B (gB) is the conserved herpesvirus fusion protein, and it is required for the entry of herpesviruses. The structure of the postfusion conformation of gB has been solved for several herpesviruses; however, the gB prefusion crystal structure and the details of how the protein refolds from a prefusion to a postfusion form to mediate fusion have not been determined. Using structure-based mutagenesis, we previously reported that three mutations (I671A, H681A, and F683A) in the C-terminal arm of the gB ectodomain greatly reduced cell-cell fusion. This fusion deficit could be rescued by the addition of a hyperfusogenic mutation, suggesting that the gB triple mutant was not misfolded. Using a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC), we constructed two independent herpes simplex virus 1 mutant strains (gB 3A) carrying the three arm mutations. The gB 3A viruses have 200-fold smaller plaques than the wild-type virus and demonstrate remarkably delayed entry into cells. Single-step and multistep growth curves show that gB 3A viruses have delayed replication kinetics. Interestingly, incubation at 40\u00b0C promoted the entry of the gB 3A viruses. We propose that the gB 3A viruses' entry deficit is due to a loss of interactions between residues in the gB C-terminal arm and the coiled-coil core of gB. The results suggest that the triple alanine mutation may destabilize the postfusion gB conformation and/or stabilize the prefusion gB conformation and that exposure to elevated temperatures can overcome the defect in gB 3A viruses. IMPORTANCE Because of its complexity, the mechanism of herpesvirus entry into cells is not well understood. Our study investigated one of the most important unanswered questions about herpesvirus entry; i.e., how does the herpesvirus fusion protein gB mediate membrane fusion? gB is an essential protein that is conserved in all herpesviruses and is thought to undergo a conformational change to provide the energy to fuse the viral and cellular membranes. Using our understanding of the structure of gB, we designed mutations in the gB \"arm\" region that we predicted would impede gB function. We introduced these mutations into herpes simplex virus 1 by using a bacterial artificial chromosome, and the mutant virus exhibited a drastically delayed rate of entry. This entry defect was rescued by incubation at elevated temperatures, supporting a hypothesis that the engineered mutations altered the energetics of gB refolding. This study supports our hypothesis that an interaction between the gB arm and the core of gB is critical for gB refolding and the execution of membrane fusion, thus providing key details about the function of gB in herpesvirus-mediated fusion and subsequent virus entry. H erpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) entry into cells and virus-induced cell-cell fusion require the coordinated action of viral entry glycoprotein D (gD), gH, gL, and gB. The binding of gD to one of several host receptors results in a conformational change Citation Fan Q, Kopp SJ, Connolly SA, Longnecker R. 2017.

The postfusion gB structure adopts a hairpin conformation wherein the hydrophobic fusion loops that insert themselves into the host cell membrane reside at the same end of the molecule as the C terminus of the ectodomain, the site where the transmembrane domain would connect. This hairpin arrangement is common for the postfusion form of fusion proteins. A central coiled-coil core consisting of three \u2423-helices in domain III contributes to the stability of the trimer. The C-terminal region of the ectodomain (domain V) consists of a long arm that extends down the length of the molecule and packs into a groove in the central coiled coil. The antiparallel packing of this arm against the coiled-coil helices is reminiscent of the six-helix bundle present in the postfusion conformation of class I fusion proteins. Formation of the class I six-helix bundle is proposed to help overcome the energy barrier to membrane fusion (18) . We hypothesize that gB refolds similarly to class I fusion proteins and that the arm packing against the coiled coil provides a driving force for the gB conformational change from its prefusion to its postfusion form. Interestingly, electron cryotomography of gB on vesicles revealed a gB conformation that lacks the coil-arm complex, supporting the concept that this complex may be absent from the prefusion form (19) .",

Addition of the gB 3A mutations to the viral genome permitted analysis of multistep growth curves and plaque sizes, data that cannot be collected by using a virus that is complemented phenotypically. Our results showed that a gB 3A mutant virus had impaired growth and significantly delayed penetration of cells. We found that elevated temperatures could partially rescue the penetration of cells by gB 3A virus. The ability of heat to overcome the penetration defect is consistent with the hypothesis that the gB 3A mutations favor the prefusion conformation.

            "text": "gB 3A viruses display a small-plaque phenotype. Compared to the GS3217 (WT) virus, both gB 3A viruses formed smaller plaques on Vero cells after 3 days of incubation (Fig. 3A) . Relative to the GS3217 (WT) gB plaques, the gB 3A plaques were approximately 200-fold smaller, with a 50-to 300-fold range of reduction (Fig. 3B ). The plaque size was partially restored when VgB cells (Vero-24 cells expressing WT gB) were infected with the gB 3A viruses (Fig. 3A) , with gB 3A plaques sizes only two to three times smaller than those of the WT (Fig. 3B ). This partial restoration of plaque size suggests that the mutations in the gB-encoding gene of gB 3A are responsible for gB 3A viruses have slow growth kinetics. To investigate the growth of the gB 3A viruses, we performed single-step growth curve assays (Fig. 4A ). Vero cells were infected with gB 3A-1, gB 3A-2, or GS3217 (WT) virus at 5 PFU/cell, and virus titers were determined at 6, 12, 18, and 24 hpi (Fig. 4A) . A defect in gB 3A mutant virus replication was detected at 12, 18, and 24 hpi. By 24 hpi, the mutant virus titers were 3 log units lower than those of the GS3217 (WT) virus. To examine the replication of the gB 3A viruses at a lower multiplicity of infection (MOI), we performed a multistep growth curve assay (Fig. 4B ). Vero cells were infected with the viruses at 0.01 PFU/cell, and virus titers were determined every 12 h until 48 hpi. At 12 hpi, the GS3217 (WT) virus titer had increased but the gB 3A virus titers had not. At 24 hpi, the gB 3A titers lagged behind the GS3217 (WT) virus titer by more than 5 log units (Fig. 4B ). At 48 hpi, the gB 3A virus titers were increasing but had not reached the titer achieved by the GS3217 (WT) virus. Consistent with their small-plaque phenotype (Fig. 3) and delayed development of a CPE (Fig. 2) , the gB 3A viruses demonstrated significant growth defects in both the single-step and multistep growth curves (Fig. 4) . gB Mutations That Impact Fusion \u00ae gB 3A viruses show slow penetration of cells. The entry of HSV-1 into the cell begins with viral gB and/or gC attachment to cell surface HS proteoglycans. After binding, the virus is resistant to removal from the cell surface with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) rinses but bound virions are sensitive to inactivation by a low-pH citrate buffer (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) , Once fusion has occurred, the virions are no longer sensitive to inactivation by citrate buffer (21, 26, 27) . This ability to differentiate between \"bound viruses\" and \"fused viruses\" by using low-pH inactivation allows penetration assays to be performed. GS3217 (WT) or gB 3A HSV-1 (150 PFU) was allowed to adsorb to Vero cell monolayers for 1 h on ice. Cells were then incubated at 37\u00b0C for 0 to 4 h. At specific time points, cells were treated with citrate buffer to inactivate extracellular virus or with PBS as a control. After treatment, the cells were overlaid with methylcellulose medium and plaques were allowed to form. For G3217 (WT) virus, incubation at 37\u00b0C for 2 h prior to the citrate buffer treatment was sufficient to reach nearly maximal titers (Fig. 5A) . Indeed, penetration of the G3217 (WT) virus was detectable after only 20 min at 37\u00b0C. In contrast, when the gB 3A viruses were allowed to adsorb to Vero cells for 1 h at 4\u00b0C and then allowed to enter the cells for 2 h at 37\u00b0C before citrate buffer inactivation, very few plaques formed (Fig. 5B ). When the gB 3A viruses were rinsed with PBS instead of citrate buffer at 2 hpi, plaques formed as expected (Fig. 5B ). These results demonstrate that at 37\u00b0C, the gB 3A viruses remain sensitive to low-pH inactivation longer than the G3217 (WT) virus.",

The gB 3A and G3217 (WT) viruses (200 PFU) were added to Vero cell monolayers, and the cells were incubated at 4\u00b0C or 37\u00b0C for up to 120 min. At 4\u00b0C, viruses can bind to but not fuse with the cells. At distinct time points, the cells were rinsed with PBS twice to remove unbound virus and methylcellulose medium was added. Plaques were counted after 3 days of incubation to determine the level of resistance to the PBS washes.

The plaque counts of all viruses increased as the incubation time prior to the PBS washes increased.

To confirm that the small-plaque phenotype of the gB 3A virus maps to the gB 3A protein, we determined whether this phenotype could be rescued by complementing the virus with a hyperfusogenic form of gB (gB 876T) (20, 28) that has a truncation gB Mutations That Impact Fusion \u00ae in its cytoplasmic tail. Vero cells were transfected overnight with a plasmid encoding gB 876T or gB 3A or with the vector. Transfected cells were infected with gB 3A-1 or gB 3A-2 virus, and plaques were imaged after 3 days. The plaque size on gB 876Texpressing cells was up to 10-fold larger than that on cells transfected with the vector (Fig. 7) . These results indicate that expression of gB 876T partially rescues the gB 3A virus small-plaque phenotype, consistent with this phenotype mapping to the gB 3A protein. Interestingly, cells expressing gB 3A showed somewhat larger plaques than cells transfected with the vector, suggesting that greater levels of gB 3A expression may enhance virus spread. (29, 30) . To determine whether an increase in temperature could promote the entry of the gB 3A viruses into cells, the penetration assay was performed at both 37\u00b0C ( Fig. 8A to C) and 40\u00b0C (Fig. 8D to F). Viruses were allowed to penetrate cells for 2, 4, or 6 h before treatment with low-pH citrate buffer to inactivate extracellular virus or with PBS as a positive control. As expected, the citrate buffer treatment did not affect the entry of the G3217 (WT) compared with the PBS control because maximal penetration has occurred by 2 hpi (Fig. 8C) . As previously seen, the gB 3A viruses failed to penetrate the cells after a 6-h incubation at 37\u00b0C (Fig. 8A and B) ; however, a small number of plaques were apparent when the gB 3A viruses were incubated with cells for 4 h at 40\u00b0C prior to citrate buffer treatment (Fig. 8D and E). These results suggest that the energy provided by the increased temperature may overcome the penetration defect in the gB 3A virus, potentially by promoting the prefusion-to-postfusion conformational change in gB.",

In the current model of entry, gD binding to an entry receptor gB Mutations That Impact Fusion \u00ae relays a signal to gH/gL that is transmitted to gB to trigger fusion (31) . To explore whether the defects in gB 3A function are due to a deficiency in its gH/gL interaction, we used a cell-cell fusion assay that allowed us to titrate increasing levels of gH/gL DNA (Fig. 9 ). If the gB 3A fusion defect is due to a reduced capacity to interact with the fusion regulator gH/gL, higher levels of gH/gL expression might compensate for the defect. Transfection with high levels of gH/gL DNA did not enhance fusion mediated by gB 3A, and thus, the hypothesis that gB 3A has impaired an interaction with gH/gL was not supported.",

For herpesviruses, an interaction with gH/gL is proposed to destabilize the prefusion conformation of gB to trigger the conformational change that mediates fusion. Heat has been used previously as a surrogate trigger for several class I and III fusion proteins to transition from a prefusion to a postfusion conformation (29, (39) (40) (41) (42) (43) (44) (45) . To explore whether the defects in gB 3A fusion could be overcome by heat, the viral penetration rate was examined at an elevated temperature. At 37\u00b0C, penetration by the gB 3A viruses required more than 10 h of incubation with cells (Fig. 5) ; however, penetration was detectable after only 4 h at 40\u00b0C (Fig. 8) . Although heat may impact multiple stages of the HSV-1 infectious cycle, WT virus penetration was unaffected by the 40\u00b0C incubation. The absence of a nonspecific enhancement of WT virus penetration at 40\u00b0C suggests that heat partially rescued the cell penetration of the gB 3A virus by affecting the gB 3A protein.",

At each step of the BAC constructions, the intermediate BACs with Kan r -encoding gene insertions and the final BACs were confirmed by at least four restriction enzyme digestions.",
