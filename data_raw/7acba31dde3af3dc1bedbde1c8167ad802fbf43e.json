IBV belongs to the order of the Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae, subfamily Coronavirinae and genus Gammacoronavirus [2] . Worldwide, IBV causes huge economic losses in both broilers and layers. IBV has a tropism not only for the epithelium of the respiratory tract but also for the epithelium of kidneys, oviduct, gastrointestinal tract (oesophagus, proventriculus, duodenum, jejunum, bursa of Fabricius, caecal tonsils, rectum and cloaca) and testes [3, 4] . IBV is clinically associated with poor performance of birds, reduced egg production and quality, as well as increased predisposition to other secondary bacterial infection [5] . IBV is highly contagious. Currently, multiple serotypes of IBV exist, and new variants emerge due to frequent point mutations and recombination events in the viral genome [4] . Vaccination failure is very common against IBV due to poor or no cross-protection between different IBV serotypes.",

In the early 1950s, the well-known respiratory Massachusetts type of IBV (Mass) was isolated in the United States. In subsequent years, Mass-type (prototype: M41) strains have been identified worldwide, and many variants emerged. Some IBV strains were called nephropathogenic because the initial respiratory infection was followed by severe kidney infection. Important clinical signs of nephropathogenic IBV strains include increased water consumption, low body weight gain, watery droppings and significant mortality. Necropsy of birds that died during a nephropathogenic infection reveals enlarged and pale kidneys with urates in the collecting tubules [7] . In the 1960s, the first nephropathogenic IBV strains were reported in the US and Australia, and later worldwide. In the last 15 years, nephropathogenic IBV strains have been emerging as most prevalent IBV strains in commercial poultry [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . The B1648 strain is a Belgian reference nephropathogenic IBV serotype, that was responsible for large outbreaks of kidney disease in broiler farms in Belgium, The Netherlands and Northern France, and was first isolated in 1984 [7, [13] [14] [15] .",

            "text": "In September 2012, a novel coronavirus emerged in humans, designated Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). MERS-CoV has a higher mortality rate (>35%) than another well-known coronavirus, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (9.6%). The MERS-CoV infected patients usually end up with a severe pneumonia complicated with kidney failure. The severity of MERS-CoV infections in humans, caused by its extra-pulmonary infection of kidneys have prompted us to question why this virus has a strong tropism for the kidneys. The same question has been raised for the kidney tropism of certain IBV strains, for the past 25 years [7, [13] [14] [15] . Hence, in the present study, we aimed to explore the tissue tropism characteristics of IBV nephropathogenic (B1648) and respiratory (M41) strains in chickens. To this end, replication kinetics of IBV B1648 and M41 were evaluated in vitro in tracheal mucosa explants and blood monocytes by a reproducible quantitative analysis system using confocal microscopy [16] [17] [18] . A new 5\u2032 RT-qPCR was validated and used for comparing in vivo the viral replication kinetics in the respiratory tract and dissemination in blood of IBV B1648 and M41 [19] . Elucidating the tissue tropism mechanisms of B1648 and M41 is important to plan better prevention strategies for emerging highly nephropathogenic IBV infections.",

Briefly, three eight-week-old specific-pathogen free (SPF) chickens were euthanized by intravenous injection of sodium pentobarbital (100 mg/kg) in the brachial wing vein. Tracheas were collected and carefully split into two equal halves with surgical blades (Swann-Morton). Tracheal mucosal explants covering a total area of 10 mm 2 were made and placed on top of fine-meshed gauzes in six-well culture plates (Nunc), epithelium upwards. The explants were maintained in serum-free medium [50% Ham's F12 (Gibco)/50% DMEM (Gibco)] supplemented with 100 U/mL penicillin (Continental Pharma), 0.1 mg/ mL streptomycin (Certa), 1 \u03bcg/mL gentamycin (Gibco) and 25 mM HEPES (Gibco). The epithelium of the explants was slightly immersed in the fluid to achieve an air liquid interface. Explants were maintained up to 96 h at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO 2 .",

For the inoculation, explants were taken from their gauze and placed at the bottom of a 24-well plate with the epithelial surface upwards. Explants were washed twice with warm serum-free medium and inoculated with 1 mL of a virus stock containing 10 7.0 EID 50 (1 h, 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO 2 ). In in vitro tracheal mucosa experiments, the local mucus layer and other innate defense barriers reduce infectivity of the mucosa. Therefore, the mucosal explants were washed before inoculation to remove mucus and other innate defense barriers and high virus titers were used (10 7 EID 50 /mL) in order to have sufficient virus to reach the epithelial cells. In addition, the main aim of this study was to evaluate replication kinetics at early time points, before the viability of the mucosal explants goes down, i.e. 96 h of cultivation and 72 h after virus inoculation. To meet the above expectations, the use of a high virus titer for the inoculation of in vitro mucosal explants is a general standardized protocol in our laboratory [17, 25, 26] . After 1 h of virus incubation, the inoculated explants were washed three times with warm medium and placed back on the gauze.

Hence, we have investigated the replication patterns of IBV nephropathogenic (B1648) and respiratory (M41) strains in vitro, in respiratory mucosa explants and peripheral blood monocytes, and in chickens. The replication kinetics and invasion strategies of IBV B1648 and M41 were better understood by the work done with respiratory mucosa explants. Similar to many other IBV viruses, B1648 and M41 are epitheliotropic in the respiratory mucosa [3, 5, 7] . Replication kinetics of B1648 and M41 in the respiratory mucosa explants have revealed some important differences between these strains. B1648 replicated somewhat better than M41 in the epithelium of the respiratory mucosa at 6, 12 and 24 hpi (P < 0.05). Consequently, B1648 destroyed the epithelial layer more severely than M41. The desquamation of the cells present in the epithelial layer is the main reason for the decreased number of IBV infected cells after 24 hpi [30] . Above results indicated that B1648 was highly virulent compared to M41 in the epithelial layer of respiratory mucosa.",

            "text": "Although speculative, a hypothesis can be formed to explain the lower virulence of M41 strain in vitro, which was used in the present study. The passage history of the strain and genome sequence should be considered. The passage history of the present study M41 strain is unknown [21, 22] . For IBV isolation from infected chickens, sometimes several passages of the strain in embryonated eggs are necessary to observe characteristic clinical signs of infection on embryos [22] . The repeated passages may alter the virulence and antigenicity of the virus [22] . If the present study M41 strain has been serially passaged in the past, then it may have lost part of its replication ability, and it may not be able to replicate or show virulence to the extent that is associated with other reported M41 strains [31, 32] . Therefore, it is important to give more emphasis on the passage history of the strains to have a better understanding about their virulence and its associated biological properties [35] . The genome sequence of the present study M41 strain may be different from those of the M41 strains reported by Chhabra et al. [31] , Raj and Jones [32] and Abd El Rahman et al. [34] . At present, there is no information available on the full genome sequence of M41 strain used in the present study. In the future, our M41 strain will be sequenced and analyzed. However, in contrast with the in vitro findings, our M41 was replicating better than the B1648 IBV strain in vivo demonstrating the fitness of our M41 in birds. Therefore, one should be careful with overinterpreting the in vitro results. Similar replication differences were observed in tracheal organ cultures with many other IBV strains and serotypes [32, 36, 37] . In general, the differences in virulence of strains at the respiratory mucosa might be related to the presence/absence, and/or differential expression of receptors on susceptible epithelial cells, antiviral responses of the host cells and immune-evasion mechanisms developed by the IBV strain [38] . It would be interesting to compare the replication kinetics in in vitro tracheal mucosa explants, between B1648 and other worldwide important IBV strains such as variant nephropathogenic IS/885/00-like and QX-like strains, recent variant M41 strains and variant Italy 02 and 4/91 strains [7] .",

Virus isolation was performed by inoculating embryonated eggs. Tissues were collected at euthanasia (12 dpi) from chickens inoculated with IBV B1648 and M41, and PBS (mock). Viral RNA copies (log 10 viral RNA copies/g of tissue) were measured by RT-qPCR. The quantification limit of RT-qPCR was 3.4 log 10 copies/ mL (dotted line). The detection limit of RT-qPCR was 2.4 log 10 copies/ mL (bold dotted line). During the epithelial cell layer infection, both B1648 and M41 infected cells penetrated through the basement membrane (BM) into the lamina propria. The number of B1648 viral antigen positive cells in the lamina propria was quite higher than the number of M41 viral antigen positive cells at 6, 12, 24 and 48 hpi, and was significantly higher at 72 hpi (P < 0.05). Certain infected cells were identified as KUL01 + cells (monocytic cells) and, whose number started to increase from 12 hpi, where the total number of IBV infected cells started to decrease. It could be that the infected monocytic cells (KUL01 + cells) that increased after 12 hpi, started to cross the BM to enter the lamina propria and underlying layers. These infected monocytic cells (KUL01 + cells) may play a crucial role in dissemination of virus to the blood circulation and internal organs. Therefore, monocytic cells may be identified as carrier cells that breach through the BM to reach underlying layers of the respiratory mucosa. The use of monocytic cells by nephropathogenic IBV as a Trojan horse to penetrate through connective tissues is in line with what has been observed with equine herpes virus 1 (EHV1) and European equine arteritis virus in the respiratory mucosa of horses [16, 17, 39, 40] . In our study, many infected cells in the epithelium and lamina propria were observed. Because only a certain percentage was identified as KUL01 + , efforts will be made to identify the KUL01 negative IBV infected cells in the propria of tracheal mucosa explants.",

The intracellular and extracellular titers showed that B1648 has a strong productive replication in the peripheral blood monocytes. The decrease or no change in the intracellular and extracellular virus titers of B1648 strain at 48 and 72 hpi may be due to the absence of available susceptible cells or due to an antiviral response (e.g. interferon). This is in line with the MERS-CoV and dengue virus interactions with human macrophages, and classical swine fever virus interactions with monocyte derived dendritic cells [41] [42] [43] . Absence of increase of percentage of infected cells and virus titers in the cell lysate and supernatant with M41 demonstrated that the M41 infection of monocytes was abortive. The productive replication of B1648 and abortive replication of M41 is most probably the result of differences at certain steps of the replication cycle (entry, disassembly, genome release, transcription, translation and assembly). This issue will be further explored in the future.",

Indeed, during coronavirus replication, RNA dependent RNA polymerase synthesizes genomic RNA, as well as minus strand and subgenomic mRNAs. Based on our past experience with feline coronavirus quantification, 5\u2032 RT-qPCR is the most consistent and reliable quantification method, because it evades overestimation of genomic RNAs than 3\u2032RT-qPCR [19, 50] .

Infected cells were demonstrated by immunofluorescence in cytospinned mononuclear cells at 2 (n = 2), 4 (n = 3) and 6 dpi (n = 2) with B1648. M41 infected cells were never demonstrated. These results demonstrated the onset of a cell free and cell-associated viremia at 2 dpi with B1648. This indicates that cell free B1648 virus and/or B1648 infected cells are able to enter into the blood circulation very quickly. The potential spread of B1648 from blood into the internal organs was demonstrated. In contrast with B1648, infectious virus was not demonstrated for M41 to reach the blood circulation and internal organs. Pseudorabies virus and classical swine fever virus are other examples of viruses that result in a combination of cell free and cell-associated viremia leading to the viral spread in mammals [52, 53] .

Firstly, the number of B1648 infected KUL01 + cells in the lamina propria of in vitro tracheal mucosa explants was quite higher than M41. Secondly, the percentage of infected cells and virus production in the in vitro inoculated blood mononuclear cells (KUL01 + cells) was higher for B1648 than for M41. Thirdly, viral RNA copies were detected in mononuclear cells of all B1648 infected chickens and exceptionally with M41. The results above implicate that monocytic cells may be important carrier cells, which are required for the progress of B1648 disease. The productive and sustainable replication of B1648 virus in blood monocytic cells (KUL01 + cells) may represent an important strategy used by B1648 to disseminate virus to the kidneys and other internal organs. In mammals, many highly pathogenic viruses or virus strains exploit and replicate productively in macrophages to cause severe systemic disease [43, [54] [55] [56] . Because monocytes/macrophages are usually the first line of defense against virus entry, the successful replication of virus in these cells may hamper their immunological functions and by the migratory characteristics of these cells, virus is disseminated throughout the body. In this context, monocytes are considered as double edged swords [57] [58] [59] .",

Furthermore, the replication ability of M41 may be lowest in the lamina propria and underlying layers to release cell free virus.

The results presented here are somewhat different with those from other reports, where Massachusetts type strains (M41) were detected in kidneys [60, 61] . Some other studies with the M41 reference strain have shown only mild histopathological lesions with the absence of viral antigen positive cells [62] . The basis for the differences between the different studies is not clear but might be due to different M41 strains, passage levels, experimental Figure 9 Hypothetical model of IBV B1648 and M41 replication kinetics in respiratory mucosa, blood and internal organs of chickens. Stars represent infectious virus. Star number and infectivity are directly proportional to each other. After natural entry of virus through nostrils, both nephropathogenic IBV B1648 and M41 replicate in the tracheal mucosa. B1648 uses a higher number of infected KUL01 + cells as carriers to penetrate deeper in the layers of the respiratory mucosa in contrast to M41. B1648 productively infects KUL01 + blood monocytic cells while M41 infection is abortive. Only B1648 disseminates via a cell-associated viremia in mononuclear leukocytes and cell free virus in plasma to reach lungs, liver, spleen and kidneys. B1648 productive infection is present in kidneys and to a less degree in lungs, liver and spleen. design and conditions, nutrition, environment, intercurrent infections, age/breed of the birds, and detection techniques [30, 63] .",

Mutation and recombination events are common in coronaviruses, which are likely to contribute to the emergence of new variants/mutants and outbreaks of new diseases [64] . Currently, at least 8 full genome sequences of M41 are available in Genbank. The full genome sequence of the latest M41_2006 was closest (90.8%) to the B1648 full genome sequence compared to earlier Mass 41_1965-85 (89.7%) full genome sequences [15] . It could be that the recent M41 strains may be recombinant viruses like M41_2006 with only the spike gene from the prototype M41 and the remaining genome regions from Connecticut and California serotypes [65] . The Mass type (M41) is identified/classified based on the sequence of its spike gene (3500 bp) only, but one should consider that remaining genomic regions (24 000 bp) may also play an important role in the pathogenicity of the virus [15, 66] . Thus, in the near future, full sequences should be considered and not only parts of it. Therefore, the full genome sequence of the M41 strain used in the present study will be elucidated to understand its evolutionary relationship with other Massachusetts type strains.",

Both B1648 and M41 strains successfully invade and replicate in the epithelium of the respiratory mucosa. B1648 uses more mononuclear cells as carrier cells to breach through the underlying layers of the respiratory mucosa. The penetration through the deeper layers of the respiratory mucosa was more intensive with B1648 compared to M41. B1648 spreads via a cell free and cell-associated viremia to target organs such as kidneys, liver, spleen and lungs whereas M41 does not do this. B1648 showed a fully productive replication in the KUL01 + blood monocytic cells. B1648 replication was more productive in kidneys and less in liver, spleen and lungs. During M41 infection, the infected KUL01 + cells could not be able to infiltrate into the circulation or were abortive in the submucosal layers of the upper respiratory tract (trachea and bronchi). Our study unveils hitherto unknown, but crucial aspects of the tissue tropism of B1648 and M41 strains. B1648 has achieved highly nephropathogenic hallmarks by exploiting the carrier mononuclear cells in an active manner, whereas M41 is not nephropathogenic due to the abortive nature of M41 infection of mononuclear cells.",
