Although extensive work has been carried out with them, including their classification into six distinct phylogenetically clades, little is known on bacterial macrodomains, especially if these latter are able to remove poly(ADP-ribose) polymer (PAR) from PARylated proteins, activity that only has been confirmed in human TARG1 (C6orf130) protein. To extend this limited knowledge, we demonstrate, after a comprehensive bioinformatic and phylogenetic analysis, that Fusobacterium mortiferum ATCC 9817 TARG1 (FmTARG1) is the first bacterial macrodomain shown to have high catalytic efficiency towards O-acyl-ADP-ribose, even more than hTARG1, and towards mono-and poly(ADPribosyl)ated proteins. Surprisingly, FmTARG1 gene is also inserted into a unique operonic context, only shared by the distantly related Fusobacterium perfoetens ATCC 29250 macrodomain, which include an immunity protein 51 domain, typical of bacterial polymorphic toxin systems.",

            "text": "Macrodomains have been phylogenetically subdivided into six distinct clades 1,14 . MacroD-type clade is the most studied and comprises several distinct proteins ranging from mono-(ADP-ribosyl) hydrolases and OAADPr deacetylases, such as human MacroD1 and MacroD2 15 , Oceanobacillus iheyensis MacroD (OiMacroD) 14 and E. coli YmdB 16 , to poly(A) binding modules, such as GDAP2, a highly conserved protein found from plants to humans with a lipid-binding SEC14 domain at the C terminus 17 . Another class characterized by strong binding to ADP-ribosylated proteins without catalytic activity is the MacroH2A-type clade, which include the epigenetic tumour suppressor MacroH2A 18,19 , and the macrodomains from multidomain human PARP9, PARP14, and PARP15, which are involved in the regulation of cell migration associated with lymphoma (PARP9 and PARP14) 20 , in tumour suppression (PARP15) 21 and in the host-virus response (PARP14 and PARP15) 22 . Macrodomain-containing proteins from Coronaviridae, Togaviridae, and Hepeviridae virus families have also been identified as a separate clade 23,24 , as a part of the multidomain nonstructural protein 3 (nsP3), which is involved in host protein recruitment and viral replication 25 . These macrodomains, also known as X domain or Mac1, are present in several (+)ssRNA viruses (e.g. hepatitis E virus, SARS coronavirus, human coronavirus HCoV 229E, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, and Chikungunya virus) and possess broad hydrolase activity towards mono-ADP-ribosylated proteins (PARP15, PARP14 and PARP10) 26 , but only weak activity towards PAR automodified PARP1 27 and ADP-ribose-1\u2032\u2032-phosphate 28-30 . In addition, the nsP3 proteins of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and other \u03b2-coronaviruses (MERS-CoV, BtVs-BetaCoV/SC2013) contain a non-conserved region that follows the X domain (or Mac 1) with two additional macrodomains, Mac2 and Mac3, formerly known as SUD-N and SUD-M 25 , respectively. Mac2 and Mac3 do not bind or hydrolyse ADP-ribose, but do bind G quadruplexes 24,31 . However, while Mac2 has been seen to be dispensable for the SARS-CoV replication/transcription complex, Mac3 is essential for such processes, even though it is not conserved in all the coronaviruses 31 . Thus, viral macrodomains seem to be critical for viral pathogenesis and evasion of the host immune response, making them an important target for top-rated pathogens that are in need for vaccine development, such as Chikungunya virus 27 .",

            "text": "Poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolases (PARGs) form another diverged clade, which were recognized as macrodomains only after their seven-stranded mixed \u03b2-sheet sandwiched by a five \u03b1-helices structure with the PARG-specific GGGX (6-8) QEE catalytic motif within loop 1 was determined both in bacteria and human 32,33 . These enzymes release oligo-or poly(ADPr) fragments from PARylated proteins, being predominantly exoglycohydrolases with only minor contributions to debranching PAR polymers 34 . On the other hand, the Macro-2 type clade groups important and ubiquitous cellular processing macrodomain enzymes involved in the tRNA splicing pathway, which catalyses the conversion of ADP-ribose-1\u2032\u2032-phosphate (Appr-1\u2032\u2032-p) to ADP-ribose 35 , with no de-MARylating activity 36 . Their only studied representative is the hypothetical Saccharomyces cerevisiae ATCC 204508/S288c YMR087W protein (UniProt code YMX7_YEAST) 35 . By contrast, the YBR022W macrodomain protein of the same yeast strain (now named POA1) not only converts Appr-1\u2032\u2032-p to ADP-ribose, being responsible for \u223c90% of Appr1p processing activity in yeast extracts, but also produces de-MARylation 37 . These differences in activity could be related to the fact that POA1 belongs to a different macrodomain clade, the ALC1 clade, thus named for the presence in it of the chromatin remodeler ALC1 (amplified in liver cancer 1) protein 38 , and whose macrodomain binds to sites of DNA damage by sensing PARP1-generated PAR 39 . Belonging to the same clade is the Streptomyces coelicolor SCO6735 macrodomain protein, which hydrolyses glutamate-linked protein mono-ADP-ribosylation, and whose depletion significantly increases the production of the antibiotic actinorhodin in S. coelicolor 40 . Interestingly, a unique class of macrodomains with DNA ADP-ribosyl glycohydrolase activity, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Thermus aquaticus DarG proteins, could also be included in this clade. These last proteins reverse the thymidine base-specific ADP-ribosylation caused by the corresponding DarT toxins, a new class of DNA ADP-ribosyl transferases 41 . These DarG proteins are structurally most similar to metazoan TARG1 (terminal ADPr protein glycohydrolase1, also known as OARD1 or C6orf130) proteins, but with an active site mostly positively charged to facilitate the binding of their negatively charged ssDNA substrate 41 . Of note, full-length DarG seems to inhibit DarT through a protein-protein interaction, providing another layer of DarT regulation, in addition to its macrodomain hydrolytic activity 41 . This mechanism of DarT-DarG interaction has some parallelism with that recently described for the bifunctional immunity protein Tri1, an ADP-ribosyl hydrolase, which protects the essential bacterial tubulin-like protein FtsZ against the ADP-ribosylating toxin Tre1 42 .",

Its catalytic lysine residue forms a covalent intermediate with the ribose ring through an Amadori rearrangement mechanism, followed by aspartic acid-mediated hydrolysis 12 .

            "text": "Human and reviewed mammalian TARG1 sequences were used to determine key sequence features to scan the UniProt database in an attempt to discover new canonical TARG1 members. These latter sequences are highly conserved, and their ADPr binding site can be structurally divided into three well defined regions (Fig. 1A ). The first is where the adenosine moiety is bound by means of both the electrostatic interaction between the side chain carboxyl group of D20 (hTARG1 numbering) and the adenine primary amine, and the hydrophobic interactions with L21 and F22 on the \u03b2 1 -\u03b2 2 loop, I44 and L47 on the \u03b2 2 -\u03b1 1 loop (aka Loop1 or L1, Fig. 1A) , and P118, Y150, and the C-terminal L152 10, 12 . In the second region, the pyrophosphate moiety is embedded in the \u03b2 5 -\u03b1 4 loop containing a GxG signature (L3, Fig. 1A) , which is typical of phosphate-binding domains, and whose positive dipoles are oriented towards the phosphates to stabilize their negative charges 10, 12 . Finally, the distal ribose region includes the vicinity of H32 and C33 main chain amides (L1, Fig. 1A) , and the side chains of S35 (L1, Fig. 1A ), T83 (L2, Fig. 1A ), and D125 (L3, Fig. 1A) , which possibly interact with its C2\u2032\u2032-and C3\u2032\u2032-hydroxyl groups 10, 12 . Also in this distal ribose binding pocket is the catalytic residue, K84 (L2, Fig. 1A) , which acts as a nucleophile to attack the C1\u2033 ribose ring, forming a covalent lysyl-ADPr intermediate, which is decomposed via hydrolysis by D125 12 . Based on the relevance of Loop 2 and Loop 3 in the specific TARG1 catalytic mechanism, the Prosite-compatible pattern TKx (30, 35) Px [IL] GxGxD was designed (Fig. 1A) . This pattern covers the distance between T84 and D125, and basically represents the upper part of the binding site and the amino acids needed to obtain such a specific structure (Fig. 1B , tan surface). When this pattern was scanned against a macrodomain protein sequence database composed of 22435 sequences obtained using the Prosite pattern PS51154 (Domain Macro) in UniprotKB database (including Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL), only 326 sequences were found before curing them by length (130-230 residues), giving a total of 262 sequences. Among them, 87% were Eukaryotic ( Fig. 2 ; Supplementary Table S1), and included the sequences of a spathe colourful flowering plant (Anthurium amnicola aka Tulip amnicola, Uniprot code A0A1D1XP44), a free-living nonparasitic kinetoplastid flagellated phagotrophic protozoan that feeds on bacteria (Bodo saltans, A0A0S4JUK8), a large trumpet ciliate protist (Stentor coeruleus, A0A1R2CA94), an arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (Rhizophagus irregularis; A0A2H5TLZ2, A0A015JVI8, and A0A015L9B9) and 222 animals, among them, a cnidarian (Stylophora pistillata, A0A2B4RUI1). Surprisingly, insecta with 84 sequences is the most abundant group, and all of these sequences belong to the suborders Brachycera (58) and Climorpha (26) , the latter suborder represented by a high number of mosquitos (24) that are vehicles of human diseases (Fig. 2) . All chordata sequences belong to the Craniata subphylum, being almost uniformly distributed among Actinopteri (35, mainly bony fishes) and Aves (40) classes, but not in Reptilia, with only 5 sequences (Fig. 2) . By contrast, the most abundant class is Mammalia with 50 sequences, of which, 27 are from Primates, including the one in human (Q9Y530) (Fig. 2) .",

Fusobacterium mortiferum has also been isolated from other human clinical specimens, such as colonic tissue from Crohn's and Behcet's disease patients 44 , maxillary abscesses (e.g. type strain ATCC 25557), and faeces (strains AM25-18LB, AM25-1 and OM06-15BH).

Thus, the ALC1-type clade is now divided into the five subclasses ( Fig. 4) , which include the SCO6735-like, the ALC1, the POA1-like, DarG and TARG1-like proteins.

Furthermore, in the case of the TARG1-like proteins there is a clear distinction between bacterial and eukaryotic sequences within the same clade.

In the MacroD-type clade, four subclasses could be deciphered, starting from the most abundant, MacroD-like proteins, continuing with another consisting of operational macrodomains (MacroD and sirtuin-fused domains, SAV0325-like), another displaying poly(A) binding modules (GDPA2-like), and ending with the archaeal macrodomain of the Af1521 protein. MacroH2A-type is clearly divided into two branches, the H2A1/2 and the PARP-like, whereas Macro2-type and PARG are represented by uniform clades, with no clear subdivisions. However, viral macrodomains can be divided into two main subclasses, those belonging to Togaviridae and those to Coraviridae. This latter subclass also includes Mac3(SUD-M)-like macrodomains, which are able to bind G-quadruplex sequences 25,31 . Fusobacterium macrodomains are diverse, but TARG1-type genome context is unique. F. mortiferum ATCC 9817 TARG1 macrodomain (FmTARG1) is the only fusobacterial TARG1-type sequence found in UniProt. In order to explore similar sequences, we also scanned the NCBI database, finding only one additional protein (WP_027129123.1) in F. perfoetens ATCC 29250 ( Fig. 5A ; Supplementary Fig. S2 ), a strain that Supplementary Table S1 , whereas bacterial sequences are in Supplementary Table S2. www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ was isolated from piglet faeces 49 . These two sequences corresponded to only 2% of the macrodomains found in the genus (94). Most of them (84%) are MacroD-type macrodomains (e.g. F9EJ99 from F. nucleatum subsp. animalis ATCC 51191) ( This macrodomain distribution is clearly unrelated with Fusobacterium phylogeny (Fig. 5B ), in light of the DNA sequences of their short 16S-23S rDNA spacer regions 50 , in which, an adaptive radiation into five clades has been found with an early point in its evolution from Leptotrichia 51 . F. nucleatum subspecies, along with F. periodonticum and F. russii, form clade 1, whereas F. necrophorum and F. gonidiaformans belong to clade 2. The third clade groups very closely related species from F. mortiferum/varium/ulcerans (93-98% similarity), which is also related with clade 4, which includes F. necrogenes (79-81%) 50 . Finally, F. perfoetens, known originally as Coccobacillus perfoetens for its distinct coccoid morphology, creates a quite separate clade from the other rod-shaped Fusobacterium species 51 .",

            "text": "Curiously, and although F. mortiferum ATCC 9817 and F. perfoetens ATCC 29250 belong to distantly related clades, their gene context analysis around TARG1 macrodomain genes (FMAG_01619 and T364_RS0108030, respectively) shows a similar operonic structure (Fig. 5C ). In this structure, all the corresponding gene products are putative proteins with unknown functions (PFAM database DUFs numbers 1963, 2262, 4241, 4253, 4274, and 4299), except for the product of the contiguous gene FMAG_01620, in whose protein sequence an immunity protein 51 domain can be identified by PFAM. Proteins containing domains of this type are present in bacterial polymorphic toxin systems in the form of immediate gene neighbours of the toxin gene. These toxin operonic structures are present in some actinobacteria, bacteroidetes, \u03b2,\u03b3-proteobacteria, cyanobacteria, spirochaetes, firmicutes and fusobacteria 52 . Importantly, this genome context is exclusive in nature to the two TARG1 macrodomains found in Fusobacterium spp., as the PATRIC database shows (https://www.patricbrc.org/). Such genome context singularity might be of biological relevance, although little is known about F. mortiferum biology. In fact, its strategy of invasion is different from that of other Fusobacterium spp., including 'active' and 'passive' invaders, since it lacks adhesion protein FadA and BMC (bacterial microcompartment) domains, and has a moderate number of MORN2 (membrane occupation and recognition nexus 2) domains 51 . www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ FmTARG1 is the first bacterial macrodomain known to be capable of deacetylating, de-MARylating and de-PARylating ADPr-modified substrates. After sequence-based phylogenetic analysis, the F. mortiferum FMAG_01619 gene was cloned into the pSol-AFV vector and transformed into E. cloni 10G. After induction with L-rhamnose at 25 \u00b0C, the soluble recombinant protein was purified in three simple steps, as described in Materials and Methods. The purified monomeric enzyme (16820.32 Da) ( Supplementary Fig. S3 ) showed deacetylase activity towards OAADPr and exhibited a saturation kinetics as its concentration increased up to 1 mM (Supplementary Fig. S4 ). The apparent K M calculated at 25 \u00b0C for OAADPr was 145 \u00b1 20 \u03bcM, with a k cat of 0.64 \u00b1 0.02 s \u22121 and a k cat /K M of 4414 M \u22121 s \u22121 (Table 1 ). This latter catalytic efficiency is 1.4-to 2.4-fold higher than that described for other bacterial catalytic macrodomains (Table 1) , such as EcYmdB (3042 M \u22121 s \u22121 ) 16 , OiMacroD (2412 M \u22121 s \u22121 ) 14 , and SaV0325 (1840 M \u22121 s \u22121 ) 15 , respectively. This difference in catalytic efficiency is much more pronounced compared with human macrodomains (Table 1) , ranging from 2.6 to 8.3-fold in hTARG1 (1700 M \u22121 s \u22121 ) 10 , hMacroD2 (1100 M \u22121 s \u22121 ) and hMacroD1 (533 M \u22121 s \u22121 ) 15 , respectively. This variation was also maintained when hTARG1 cloned and purified as described in Materials and Methods was measured under the same experimental conditions used for FmTARG1 (1622 M \u22121 s \u22121 ) ( Table 1) .",

            "text": "FmTARG1 also showed competitive inhibition by ADPr ( Supplementary Fig. S4 ), as has been previously described for both hTARG1 and hMacroD1 10, 15 . The inhibition constant (K i ) obtained was 203 \u00b1 10 \u03bcM, which is similar to that for hTARG1 and hMacroD1 (119 and 145 \u03bcM at 23 \u00b0C, respectively) 10,15 . These results indicate that FmTARG1 contains a specific binding site for ADPr, which is identical to the active site for OAADPr deacetylation. This could also be observed from the thermal shift assay carried out with both FmTARG1 and hTARG1 ( Supplementary Fig. S5 ). ADPr and OAADPr protects FmTARG1 from thermal inactivation in a similar way, increasing its melting temperature (T m = 52.5 \u00b1 0.1 \u00b0C) by about 4.0 \u00b0C in a dose-dependent manner up to 1 mM (Supplementary Fig. S5A,B) . This protection was higher, reaching up to 5.4 \u00b0C (Supplementary Fig. S5C,D) in hTARG1, whose melting temperature (T m = 41.3 \u00b1 0.2 \u00b0C) is about 10 \u00b0C lower than that of FmTARG1. In addition, ADPr analogues, such as AMP and ADP, also bind to both enzymes in a dose-dependent manner, but with lower affinities, since higher compound concentrations are needed (up to 50 mM) to observe similar www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ thermal protection ( Supplementary Fig. S5B,D) . Collectively, these thermal shift experiments confirm that AMP is the smallest portion of the ADPr molecule that can bind to macrodomains not only in MacroD-type macrodomains 14 , but also in TARG1-type ones. In addition, it also reinforces the importance of the distal ribose in the binding of ADPr and OAADPr compared with ADP.",

However, its activity was lower than that observed with hTARG1 (Fig. 6C) , which was also lower than that described for PARG 12 . In addition, when the reaction products of both enzymes (hTARG1 and FmTARG1) towards PARylated hPARP1were analysed by HPLC-ESI-MS/MS, the level of ADPr did not surpass that of PARylated hPARP1 in either case (Supplementary Fig. S6 ). These results reinforce the idea of FmTARG1 as a genuine bacterial hTARG1 analogue, sharing the ability to deacetylate, de-MARylate and de-PARylate ADPr-modified compounds (OAADPr) or proteins, making it the first bacterial macrodomain with this substrate profile to be described. In addition, it also confirms the existence of more macrodomains, other than hTARG1, able to carry out such plethora of activities. www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/",

            "text": "Macrodomain proteins are involved in sensing, removing, and modulating reversible post-transcriptional modification reactions that involve NAD + as substrate with the concomitant release of nicotinamide. These reactions are catalysed mainly by both a special class of glycosyltransferases, named ADP-ribosyltransferases (ARTs) that produce either the mono-ADP-ribosylation (MARylation) or the poly-ADP-ribosylation (PARylation) of their target proteins, and sirtuins, which generate protein deacetylation, rendering OAADPr. Although other enzymes, such as PARG and ADP-ribosylhydrolase 3 (ARH3), are also related with the PAR catabolism, among macrodomains, only TARG1-type macrodomains are capable of producing OAADPr deacetylation, de-MARylation and de-PARylation. Recently, hTARG1 has also been demonstrated to be able to reverse the ADP-ribosylation of DNA at both 5\u00b4P and 3\u00b4P ends, but its activity towards these DNA modified substrates was lower than that of ARH3, MacroD2, and PARG sequentially 54 . In addition, its role in the serine ADP-ribosylation posttranslational modification of proteins produced after DNA damage has been studied, showing that hTARG1 was not able to remove Ser-ADPr modification from a well-defined histone H3 peptide, whereas ARH3 was 55 .",

            "text": "These singular TARG1-type represented only 1% of total macrodomain sequences when protein databases were scanned using a profile based on the TARG1-type active centre (Fig. 1) . These enzymes have mainly been found in Metazoa, with a few examples in Euglenozoa, Fungi, and Viridiplantae (Fig. 2) . In addition, TARG1-like macrodomains were also detected in Bacteria (Fig. 3) , where they represented only 13% of the 262 TARG1-like sequences selected (Fig. 2) , forming a defined branch in the six-clade macrodomain phylogenetic tree (Fig. 4) . Among these sequences, only one belongs to a microorganism (F. mortiferum ATCC 9817) that infects human, whereas the rest of the sequences come from microorganisms retrieved from environmental samples or animal faeces. Curiously, the above microorganism has a very limited PAR metabolism, comprising just one TARG1-like macrodomain (C3WDV1) and one Sir2(CobB) protein (C3WDZ8), without any PARP, PARG or ARH3-like enzymes. In addition, its corresponding macrodomain gene (FMAG_01619) is inserted in a unique operonic structure (Fig. 5) , which is only shared with the F. perfoetens macrodomain gene (T364_RS0108030), and formed basically of genes whose protein products are unknown, except for one with an immunity 51 domain. This last domain is related with bacterial polymorphic toxins (Fig. 5C ). Interestingly, this scheme (only one macrodomain) is not generally applicable to other Fusobacterium spp., since, and unexpectedly, some of them (e.g. F. nucleatum subsp. animalis ATCC 51191 and F. periodonticum ATCC 33693) display several macrodomains, each of them from a different clade (MacroD-, SAV0325-and DarG-like, respectively) (Fig. 5A) . Kinetically, F. mortiferum ATCC 9817 TARG1 macrodomain (FmTARG1) is a remarkable catalyst, since it showed the highest catalytic efficiency described for a macrodomain, 2.6-fold higher than its homologous human enzyme (hTARG1) and 8.3-fold higher than hMacroD1 (Table 1 ; Supplementary Fig. S4) 10, 15 . Of note too is the fact that FmTARG1 was not only capable of removing terminal ADPr from MARylated proteins (Fig. 6A,B) , but also PAR from PARylated hPARP1 (Fig. 6C) , confirming that is a canonical TARG1-type macrodomain and that hTARG1 is not the only enzyme with these three activities. This, together with its high thermal stability compared with hTARG1 ( Supplementary  Fig. S4 ) and some MacroD proteins (e.g. OiMacroD), makes FmTARG1 an ideal biocatalyst for obtaining PAR polymer from PARylated proteins in order to study relevant molecular processes in which PAR is involved, such as Parthanatos 56 . Finally, in F. mortiferum ATCC 9817 TARG1-type macrodomain could be associated with the forefront ADP-ribosylation interaction between the bacterium and the host, mediated by PARP enzymes. In addition, it is tempting to speculate that some of the products of its operonic structure might also be related with this host-pathogen response. Finally, the above-described results will provide the foundation for a search for new future bacterial macrodomains from the vast number of sequences described in the databases, which will expand our knowledge of the PAR metabolism.",
