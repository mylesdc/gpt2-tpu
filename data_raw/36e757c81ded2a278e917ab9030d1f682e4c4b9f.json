Managing enormous health issues associated with such a mass gathering requires a very vibrant health delivery plan. Related research is part of the strategy. This study was done to assess the pattern of patients and illnesses encountered at one health facility at Arafat on the 2nd day of Hajj, when all the pilgrims move from Mina and stay in Arafat for a few hours . The objective of the study was to provide input so that recommendations can be given for future improvement of health care during this mass transit. Methods: All patients reporting sick to the Nimra Hospital on the Day of Arafat were included and documented on a detailed Performa and analyzed. Results: We received 211 patients, essentially all of those were in need of acute medical intervention. Acute severe asthma and injuries were the major problems encountered. There were two deaths both related to heat stroke. Patients received were predominantly Arabic speaking. Conclusions: Only those needing acute intervention seek medical advice during transit. Well equipped and staffed health facilities are, however, needed to cater these and for any mass casualties. Pre Hajj training and mandatory Flu vaccination can help.",

Logistics, transportation and health care are major areas of concern. 7 The Saudi Arabian government works all the year round to ensure the smooth performance of Hajj, providing all available assistance and facilities to the pilgrims. 8 Based on previous experience, these services remain in constant process of improvement. Research is encouraged. 9 Center of Excellence in Hajj and Omrah Research (CEHOR) and Health at Hajj and Umrah (HAHU) Research groups are two examples. Much of the previous work in medical field has been targeting the aspects related to communicable diseases. 10, 11 It appears logical as this remains the biggest health threat to all pilgrims. Studies done include evaluation and prevention of: \u2022 Infection coming to Saudi Arabia during inflow of pilgrims. 12,13 \u2022 Infection among pilgrims during the Hajj. 14 \u2022 Infection getting exported to other countries with outgoing pilgrims. 15 In our study, we concentrated on the health problems related to the 2nd day of Hajj when all pilgrims move to Arafat and usually stay there for a few hours before moving out.",

Asthma is a common problem and most patients are carrying their inhalers and medications while coming for Hajj. Advanced symptoms not responding to their regular and ongoing medication need further medical help. Worsening of symptoms may be related to respiratory infections prevailing during this mass gathering. Hajj cough is a known entity. 16 Influenza and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) have been identified as the main culprits. 17 Unlike Meningococcal Vaccine which is mandatory, Influenza vaccine is not mandatory but recommended for all pilgrims. 18, 19 Individuals with better health awareness and those coming from countries like UK and USA tend to have this vaccination but this is not a common practice among pilgrims from developing world. Related to this, the threat of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) provided a unique opportunity to put active detection, surveillance and international collaboration in place during the 2013 Hajj. 20 Patients reporting with injuries were 33 in number. Eight of them had injuries of serious nature. Three had RTA (road traffic accident) needing referrals to Makkah after initial care and stabilization while 5 had fractures which were reduced and discharged from our facility. This emphasizes the importance of having a good surgical team with adequate facilities. Moreover, any incident of a larger scale with multiple casualties remains a possibility during such a mass gathering. Medical teams need to be well equipped in terms of staff and material for providing immediate triage and life saving measures before larger scale efforts are mobilized. Although no such event has occurred during last many years, the medical team had adequate resources with an effective contingency plan to manage such casualties.",

We only received 14 patients with heat effects. In addition, we also had 14 patients having gastroenteritis and 12 patients with dehydration without any symptom of gastroenteritis. Once again the reduction in number of gastroenteritis cases indicate successful pre-Hajj education of pilgrims by their respective countries and enormous improvement in sanitary and hygienic conditions during Hajj by the Saudi authorities. 22 Gastroenteritis used to be one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality in the past, this is not the case anymore. 23, 24 Considering that the next 15 to 16 Hajj seasons will be in increasing hot summer months, the importance of proper education of pilgrims regarding prevention against heat effects cannot be over emphasized.

Presence of cardiologists, endocrinologists and orthopedic surgeons is essential.Considering high prevalence of respiratory infections during Hajj and their adverse effects on worsening the condition of patients with underlying respiratory pathologies like asthma, it is recommended that use of Influenza vaccine should be mandatory like meningococcal vaccine and not optional. Presence of large number of old aged pilgrims also supports this.More emphasis is required on pre-Hajj education of pilgrims and more plantation and shelters at Arafat will be beneficial to counter an expected rise in cases of heat stroke and heat exhaustion in coming years when Hajj will be performed in hotter months.Distribution of handouts in native languages regarding health tips and how to seek medical help will also help.",
