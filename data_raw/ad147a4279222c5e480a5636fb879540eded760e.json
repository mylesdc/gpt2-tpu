This threshold corresponds to parameters where the system's equilibrium becomes unstable. Consequently, we use the average rate at which deviations from the equilibrium shrink to define a distance to this threshold. However, the vital dynamics of the host population may occur slowly even when transmission is far from threshold levels. Here, we show analytically how such slow dynamics can prevent estimation of the distance to the threshold from fluctuations in the susceptible population. Although these results are exact only in the limit of long-term observation of a large system, simulations show that they still provide useful insight into systems with a range of population sizes, environmental noise and observation schemes. Having established some guidelines about when estimates are accurate, we then illustrate how multiple distance estimates can be used to estimate the rate of approach to the threshold. The estimation approach is general and may be applicable to zoonotic pathogens such as Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV) as well as vaccine-preventable diseases like measles.",

            "text": "Many infectious disease epidemics occur with sufficient regularity that their anticipation is straightforward. For example, seasonal influenza has a pronounced winter seasonality in most of the world, with annual outbreaks [1] . Some systems are more episodic but still well understood, such as measles in sub-Saharan Africa where regional inter-epidemic periods between 1 and 4 years have been observed in recent times [2] . By contrast, emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases are rarely anticipated, even though the root causes are often discerned soon after the event. Many childhood infectious diseases naturally spread effectively, including measles, chickenpox and rubella. This means that, in unvaccinated populations, one infectious individual may infect many others, measured by the pathogen's basic reproduction number, R 0 [3] . Outbreaks are prevented in these cases by maintaining a very high proportion of vaccinated individuals, generating herd immunity in which the effective reproduction number is below 1, meaning small chains of transmission are quickly broken [4] . Reduced vaccine uptake rates can move the infectious disease system from controlled (sub-critical, with effective R 0 , 1) to super-critical, when outbreaks may occur [5] . Alternatively, other features of the system may be slowly changing, similarly enhancing the transmission of the pathogen. Host demographic changes, particularly rising birth rates, can increase the supply of susceptible individuals to the population, and pathogens frequently evolve at high rates, whereby fitter strains (higher R 0 ) may be favoured by selection [6] . Predicting a dynamical system's movement from sub-to super-critical before it happens has enormous potential to remove the element of surprise associated with emerging infectious diseases, to prioritize mitigation strategies to reverse, stop or slow the transition, and in worst cases to simply be better prepared for the inevitable.",

            "text": "A potentially robust basis for estimating the distance to a threshold is the general slowing down of a system's dynamics as a threshold is approached. To be more precise, the average decay rate of deviations from a fixed point of the system becomes increasingly smaller as the parameters of the system approach the point at which that fixed point becomes unstable. Wissel [8] pointed out that this phenomenon, known as critical slowing down or sometimes simply as slowing down, could be used to determine whether the parameters of a system were approaching a threshold that, when crossed, could result in the system changing in an abrupt and drastic manner. Such changes have come to be called critical transitions [9] . A great deal of interest has developed in the possibility of devising model-independent methods to anticipate critical transitions in complex systems using early warning signals [10] . In general, early warning signals are statistical properties of observations of systems that can be expected to change in characteristic ways as a threshold is approached. Perhaps the most common examples are increasing autocorrelation and variance of model variables. These signals can often be derived from the increasingly slow decay of perturbations due to slowing down, and many other early warning signals are in one way or another quantifications of slowing down. The beauty of early warning signals is that their basis in generic properties of dynamical systems means they have the potential to be reliable even when the system is complex and unidentifiable. Examples of complex and poorly identified systems abound in ecology and epidemiology. With application to such systems in mind, several authors [11] [12] [13] demonstrated the application of early warning signals based on slowing down to forecasting infectious disease emergence and eradication. Further development and integration of these methods into surveillance systems may provide a novel and broadly applicable method of evaluating the control of infectious diseases from existing surveillance data streams.",

Such a point is also referred to as a steady state or an equilibrium of the system. A fixed point is called asymptotically stable if solutions that start at points near the fixed point move closer to it over time. Because the starting points are nearby, deviations z \u00bc x 2 x* are small and can be accurately modelled by solutions to the linear system _ z \u00bc Fz, where F denotes the matrix of first derivatives of f with respect to x (i.e. the Jacobian matrix). The general solution of such a system is z(t) \u00bc exp (Ft)z(0). If the real parts of all of the eigenvalues of F are negative, this solution will shrink to zero and it follows that x* is asympotically stable. If the real parts of any of the eigenvalues are positive, the solution will not shrink to zero and x* is not asymptotically stable. Thus, as long as the real parts of the eigenvalues of F are not zero, their signs tell us whether or not any fixed point is stable.",

In this case for a stable fixed point to become unstable, one of the eigenvalues must cross zero. Thus as the parameters approach the threshold where stability is lost, one of the eigenvalues must approach zero in its real part. We call such an eigenvalue an informative eigenvalue because its value is informative of how far the system's parameters are from a threshold. We call the magnitude of such an eigenvalue a distance to the threshold. If an informative eigenvalue can be monitored over time, one can determine whether the system is approaching a threshold or not and even make a forecast of when the threshold will be crossed. An informative eigenvalue can be measured by monitoring the decay of small perturbations away from the fixed point along the eigendirection of the informative eigenvalue. Identifying trends in such a decay rate is the goal of early warning signals based on slowing down.",

            "text": "Despite the simplicity of this goal, it is currently not clear exactly how it can be achieved when systems have multidimensional phase space. When one of the eigenvalues of F gets closer to zero, only a small number of the model's observable variables may become less resilient to perturbations. The implication is that early warning signals such as increasing variance and autocorrelation will not be present in all of the model's variables. Several authors have provided examples of such a case. Kuehn [15] showed that in a susceptibleinfected-susceptible (SIS) model of an epidemic on an adaptive contact network, only one of the three model variables had a clear increase in variance as the epidemic threshold was crossed. Boerlijst et al. [16] even showed that, depending on the types of perturbations a system experiences, the autocorrelation of some variables may either increase or decrease as a threshold is approached. Consequently, a review [17] identified the selection of appropriate variables in multivariate systems for detection of slowing down as an important problem in need of solution. Dakos [18] has recently used an eigendecomposition of F to derive a simple rule about which state variables have a decay rate that is most affected by the dominant eigenvalue of F. However, this approach only provides a partial answer to the question of variable selection, because it does not account for the covariance of the perturbations to the system, which can be as important as the eigenvectors of F on the decay rate of a state variable. Furthermore, another consequence of models having multiple dimensions is that the informative eigenvalue may not necessarily be the dominant eigenvalue. When its real part gets close enough to zero, the informative eigenvalue will of course become dominant but, as we shall demonstrate, that may not happen until it is very small. So although slowing down is often explained to be a consequence of the dominant rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org J. R. Soc. Interface 15: 20180034 eigenvalue approaching zero, methods to estimate the dominant eigenvalue of F from a multivariate time series may not reliably estimate the distance to the threshold. There does not seem to be any general approach for estimating the distance to the threshold in multidimensional systems.",

We demonstrate the application of this method to the susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model for directly transmitted infectious diseases. We find that, for parameters relevant to many vaccine-preventable diseases, the autocorrelation of the number infected almost always is indicative of the distance to the epidemic threshold, while the autocorrelation of the number susceptible is not. We examine the sensitivity of the accuracy of these estimates to environmental noise, small population size, the frequency of observation and observation of case reports instead of the actual number infected. We also show a simple example of estimating the change in the distance to the threshold over the length of a time series.

Typically, we assume that these numbers are the integer-valued random variables of a Markov process having the parameters defined in table 1 and the transitions defined in table 2. In the following, we often omit explicit notation of time dependence for the sake of conciseness. We also consider models where the death rate or the force of infection (i.e. the per capita rate at which susceptibles become infected) is subject to variation over time due to fluctuations in the environment over time. We follow Bret\u00f3 & Ionides [19] in modelling such variation as multiplicative gamma white (temporally uncorrelated) noise. This noise could represent changes in rates due to weather conditions or social mixing [20] or even model errors in model specification, such as a failure to model spatial heterogeneity [21] . Bret\u00f3 & Ionides [19] show that the model remains Markovian with such noise with the modified propensities for the death and transmission events given by the expressions in table 3. Inclusion of multiplicative gamma noise leads to the possibility that more than one individual becomes infected or dies in a single event (i.e. the associated counting processes are compound) and table  3 gives the propensity of birth and death events for all positive integers k, k 1 , k 2 and k 3 .",

A more realistic model would include much higher mortality at old age, but such realism is not necessary for our study. Another key feature of our model is the inclusion of the h term in the force of infection (tables 2 and 3), which relaxes the assumption that the population is closed to infection from other populations or environmental reservoirs.

Figure 1 shows representative examples of the kinds of time series that we suppose could become available for statistical analysis. For two of the parameter values, cycles are visible in both the number of susceptibles, X, and the number of infecteds, Y; this is a consequence of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian, F, being complex. This behaviour is typical of parameters for which R 0 . 1. We have explained in the Methods section that, in this case, any white noise perturbation may allow for the distance estimate to be obtained from either variable. When R 0 , 1, typically there are two real eigenvalues. Without any knowledge about the model, we would expect that the ability to obtain an estimate depends on the covariance of the perturbations. With the knowledge that the observations come from an SIR model, we could expect that the dynamics of the X and Y variables will be largely independent of each other. The number infected will generally be too small to affect the fluctuations in the number susceptible. Thus, the rate at which susceptible perturbations decay will depend mostly on the per capita death rate m, whereas the rate at which infected perturbations decay will depend on the sum of the per capita rates at which Y grows and shrinks, bX * /N 0 2 g 2 m. Thus, the variable Y is generally the one that should be observed to estimate the distance to the threshold when the disease is not widespread. In the electronic supplementary material, we derive explicit equations for the autocorrelations that support this conclusion.",

We use the approach described in the Methods section to find the set of noise parameters that allow the distance to the threshold to be estimated with a given accuracy from each variable. These sets appear as regions in space in figure 2 . Consistently with the conclusions of the previous paragraph, the regions are much larger for the number infected, Y , than for the number susceptible, X. The regions for Y include the perturbations that result from the intrinsic noise present in simulations of the model with finite population sizes.

Having shown that, in principle, it is often possible to obtain distance estimates from the SIR model from at least one of the variables, we next turn to the question of whether estimates may be obtained in practice from a simulated time series of realistic length using our estimation method. Figure 3 shows that for time series of about 1000 observations our estimation method was generally successful when the perturbations are predicted to be suitable. The perturbations were simply intrinsic noise, so the low accuracy of estimates based on X when R 0 \u00bc (0.1, 0.5, 0.9) is consistent with figure 2. As expected, when R 0 . 1 estimates from both X and Y were similarly accurate. Therefore, Y permits a distance estimate for all R 0 considered. Fortunately, Y is the variable which is more often observed in practice. We have included estimates based on X in our results primarily to evaluate our analytical predictions about when a variable can provide an accurate distance estimate.",

A rough guideline for accurate estimation seems to be that the duration of observation be at least as long as the period of any oscillation in the autocorrelation function. Another guideline is that the time between observations be much less than the period of oscillation of the autocorrelation. In the R 0 \u00bc 16 panel of figure 4 , no distance estimates were obtained when the observation frequency went from 0.25 per week to 1 per year. For these parameters, the autocorrelation had a period of about 3 years, so three observations per cycle seems much less likely to provide sufficient information than 40 observations per cycle. A similar guideline on the sampling frequency holds when the autocorrelation function is not periodic. In the R 0 \u00bc 0.9 panel, no estimates based on Y are available as the sampling frequency dips below 0.25 per week. Here, the autocorrelation shrinks by a factor of e % 2.7 about every 23 weeks. This time can be used to characterize the time scale of a decaying function and is sometimes called the return time. A third guideline, then, is that the time between samples should be less than the return time. In summary, for accurate estimates the duration of observation should be much greater than the time scale of the autocorrelation function but the time between observations should be much smaller than the time scale of the autocorrelation function.",

In particular, it is relatively rare for the number of infections in a population at a given point in time to be observed. A more typical type of observation is the count of the number of infected individuals that moved into the removed class, for example, because these individuals were diagnosed with infection and then greatly reduced contact with others [33] . We refer to such counts as case reports. Figure 4 shows that the estimates based on case reports were similar to those based on direct observation of X or Y . The main difference is that when the data consist of case reports we concluded more often that there was insufficient information available for an estimate. For example, many estimates based on Y are plotted when R 0 \u00bc 0.9 and the observation frequency is 0.25 per week, but the same set of simulations resulted in no estimates based on case reports. When the reporting of each recovery is not sure but instead occurs with a certain probability, as in the study of Gamado et al. [34] , the number of simulations that resulted in estimates went down with the reporting probability ( figure 5 ).",

The solution is a method of calculating what type of white noise perturbations, if any, allow slowing down to be detected based on observation of a given variable. To provide a specific example, this general solution has been applied to the SIR model and been shown to be consistent both with a modelspecific analysis and with simulations. This application has also served to demonstrate and stress-test a method of estimating a distance to a threshold that is defined as one of the eigenvalues of the linearized model's matrix, F. Importantly, this informative eigenvalue is not always the dominant eigenvalue. When the informative eigenvalue is not dominant it is a consequence of the vital dynamics of the host occurring on a time scale that is much longer than the dynamics of small outbreaks that occur when the infection does not spread very well in the host population. Such a difference in time scales seems likely to occur in other multivariate models of population dynamics.",

In the SIR model, the autocorrelation function of one of the state variables is often very similar to that of one of the eigendirections. This allowed us to select variables based on the criterion of how well the autocorrelation function matched up with that of the eigendirection corresponding to the informative eigenvalue. In general, as the number of variables grows we might expect the autocorrelation function of each variable to become more strongly influenced by multiple eigenvalues. For this more challenging case, we wonder whether harmonic inversion methods [35] might be capable of estimating the values of each of the eigenvalues that strongly influence each variable from its autocorrelation function. Variables that allow the informative eigenvalue to be estimated in this manner could then be considered appropriate for tracking the distance to the threshold.",

In the context of infectious disease surveillance, an exciting prospect of this approach is the possibility that surveillance programmes might be able to determine that some change in the system is moving it closer to the epidemic threshold long before the threshold is crossed. Besides increasing awareness, such measurement may allow for management of the distance to the threshold in some systems, for example, by guiding the allocation of resources to vaccination programmes. In this way, infectious disease control goals could move beyond early detection of and rapid response to epidemics towards targeted prevention of epidemics. Furthermore, tracking has the potential to measure the relenting and reversing of system dynamics in response to control goals. Finally, establishing the conditions under which statistical analysis of fluctuations in the number of infected individuals is more informative than similar analysis of susceptible individuals does not make a case against susceptible reconstruction methods [36] in distance-to-threshold studies because such methods estimate major trends in the susceptible population size rather than fluctuations around them. Rather, our result makes a case for analysis of the fluctuations in the number infected, whether estimated from readily available time-series incidence data or from pathogen sequence data [37] .",

To avoid confounding the effects of frequency with the effects of the length of the time series, its length was kept the same for all sampling frequencies by adjusting the stop time of the simulations. In the R 0 \u00bc 2 panel offigure 4, we see that, when such a trade-off exists between the duration of observation and the observation frequency, a high observation frequency can be detrimental due to the short observation period. For daily observation frequency, the total duration of observation was limited to 1000 days, whereas the period length of the oscillations in the autocorrelation was about 11 years. With weekly observation frequency, the duration of observation is about 20 years and the estimates are much In our SIR model for most R 0 , 1, the set of noise parameters under which the distance to the epidemic threshold may be estimated is much larger for the number infected than for the number susceptible. Each panel plots as a prism, for a range of variances in white noise perturbations to the number of susceptible and infected (subscripts 1 and 2, respectively), the region containing the covariances for the perturbations that result in the autocorrelation of the model variable being within 0.1 of the reference that would result in a perfect distance estimate. The axis labels denote elements of the matrix D in equation (2.7). The points in each panel correspond to the intrinsic perturbations calculated by the linear noise approximation equation (2.9). The red line segments are drawn vertically from these points to the nearest boundary of the low-error region. The points in the panels for the infecteds fall within the low-error region. Parameters were as in table 1, with b set to 1.66, 8.31 and 14.9. (Online version in colour.) Distance estimates can be obtained from both X and Y in stochastic simulations of our SIR model. However, the distance estimates based on X are not always reliable. The X and Y variables were sampled weekly for 20 years. Parameters for the simulations are in table 1, with b set to R 0 (g \u00fe m). The distance to the threshold is defined here as the modulus of the informative eigenvalue. The true value is marked with an 'x'. One hundred datasets were simulated for each set of parameters and all estimates obtained for each variable are plotted. The x-values of the points have been jittered to make the density of points at each y-value clearer.rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org J. R. Soc. Interface 15: 20180034",
