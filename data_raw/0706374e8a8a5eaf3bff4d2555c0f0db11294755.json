The potent anti-inflammatory and ethnopharmacological properties of Lonicera japonica Thunb. (Caprifoliaceae) make it an excellent source of novel medicinal targets for the treatment of NASH. The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of L. japonica ethanol extract (LJEE) on NASH in mice. C57BL/6J mice were fed with methionine-choline-deficient diet (MCDD) for eight weeks to promote the development of NASH. After development of the model, the mice were administered LJEE once daily via oral gavage at doses of 100, 200, or 300 mg/kg for another four weeks. Simultaneous treatments with LJEE (300 mg/kg/day) resulted in pronounced improvements in liver steatosis, ballooning degeneration, and inflammation. LJEE prevented MCDD-induced plasma level increases in aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase. LJEE significantly reduced hepatic malondialdehyde level and ameliorated hepatic inflammation and fibrosis in MCDD-fed mice, which were associated with down-regulation of cytochrome P450 2E1 suppression of multiple proinflammatory and profibrotic genes. LJEE can prevent hepatic steatosis by reducing hepatic peroxisome acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 expression, as well as by inducing proliferator-activated receptor \u03b1 expression. In addition, the LJEE treatments caused significant reduction in the phosphorylated form of Jun N-terminal kinase along with an increase in the phosphorylated level of extra cellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2. Our study demonstrated the protective role of LJEE in ameliorating nutritional steatohepatitis.",

            "text": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a condition in which excessive fat accumulates in the liver of a patient who does not have a history of alcohol abuse [1] . NAFLD is classified into two categories: simple steatosis, in which only steatosis is observed, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), in which, in addition to steatosis, lobular inflammation and liver cell injury are observed. Although the underlying mechanisms of disease progression remain poorly understood, the \"two-hit\" hypothesis described the pathophysiology of NASH [2] . Steatosis (a primary insult) can sensitize the liver to secondary serious insults including reactive oxygen/nitrogen species, gut-derived endotoxins, pro-inflammatory cytokines like tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF\u03b1), resulting in NASH development [3] . NASH may develop into liver cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma [4] . The available treatment options for NASH include weight loss, dietary, and lifestyle modifications, use of insulin sensitizing, and lipid lowering drugs [5] . Furthermore, combinations of these approaches have also been tried for management of NASH [5] . Since NASH is a multifactorial disease, single target based therapy has limited implications.",

The constituents of this plant have been previously investigated and shown to contain iridoid glucosides and polyphenolic compounds [7] . The main polyphenolic components in L. japonica are chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, flavoyadorinin-B, methyl chlorogenate, and protocatechuic acid, make great contribution to its special activities [7] . In current Chinese Pharmacopoeia [8] , chlorogenic acid has been officially used as the indicator compound to characterize the quality of this herb. The modern pharmacological studies showed that L. japonica had wide pharmacological actions, such as antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, antiendotoxin, antipyretic, and other activities [6] . Since 1995, Lonicera japonica has been listed in the Pharmacopoeia of the People's Republic of China [9] , and made in some preparations to treat chronic enteritis, pneumonia, acute tonsillitis, nephritis, acute mastitis, leptospirosis in clinic. L. japonica also has been employed extensively to prevent and treat some serious viral diseases of human and veterinary, such as SARS coronavirus, H1N1 (Swine) flu virus [10] . In Chinese Pharmacopoeia, only the flowers and flower buds have been officially used as the active parts to treat diseases [8] .",

It has also been reported that an herbal formula consisting of L. japonica attenuates carbon tetrachloride-induced liver damage in rats [12] ; hepatoprotective potential of this plant could be considered. However, the possibility that L. japonica could prove beneficial in ameliorating NASH has not been previously explored. The use of a diet deficient in essential amino acids such as methionine and choline is a well-accepted model for inducing NASH, which recapitulates many of the features of this disease in humans, including a histologic picture that mimics that seen in human fibrotic disorders associated with hepatic lipid accumulation, and the presence of inflammation and oxidative stress [13] . To support the application of L. japonica in the treatment of NASH-like disorders, the study investigated the hepatotherapeutic effect of L. japonica in an animal model of methionine-and choline-deficient diet (MCDD)-induced hepatic injury and to elucidate the underlying mechanism involved. Ciprofibrate, a fibric acid derivative, is a commercially available drug in the treatment of hyperlipidemia [14] . It has been documented that ciprofibrate at the daily oral dosage of 10 mg/kg was effective to ameliorate hyperlipidemia in hypertriglyceridemic mice [14] . In the present study, ciprofibrate was thus used as positive control to compare the effects of L. japonica on the amelioration of NASH.",

            "text": "Fat accumulation in the liver can be recognized as the \"first hit\" in the pathogenesis of NASH. We found that LJEE produced pharmaceutical effects on hepatic cholesterol and TG levels. Several studies have suggested that hepatic lipogenesis is increased in hepatic steatosis, which may result from either increased TG synthesis, or decreased fatty acid oxidation, both leading to increased TG content in the liver [22] . DGAT2 is a microsomal enzyme that joins acyl-CoA to 1,2-diacylglycerol and thus constitutes the final step in TG biosynthesis [23] . Although MCDD promotes intrahepatic lipid accumulation through impairment of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion [24, 25] , the mRNA encoding genes related to lipogenesis, such as DGAT2, were suppressed in mice fed a MCDD [26, 27] , which is in agreement with our findings. Our results showed that DGAT2 expression in MCDD-fed mice was also decreased in the LJEE-treated group. These results demonstrated that LJEE induced down-regulation of lipogenesis-related genes to inhibit accumulation of hepatic lipid droplets via a decrease of TG synthesis in MCDD-fed mice. The microsomal TG transfer protein (MTTP) is responsible for VLDL assembly and export from the liver, which probably contributes to the derangement of triglyceride metabolism [28] . However, reduced MTTP expression has been found in various mouse models of NASH [29, 30] . Further direct studies are needed to assess whether LJEE alterations would suffice to correct for the defect. In addition, PPAR\u03b1 mRNA level was significantly increased in LJEE-treated MCDD-fed mice. PPAR\u03b1 plays a central role in the uptake and \u03b2-oxidation of fatty acids, especially in the liver, and has been reported to protect against MCDD or high-fat-induced NASH in rodents [31, 32] . The beneficial effects of LJEE in the treatment of liver steatosis may be partly due to enhanced fatty acids oxidation in the liver.",

The oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids can increase lipid peroxidation, which can activate hepatic stellate cells thus expediting the development of fibrosis [33] . CYP2E1, a member of the oxido-reductase cytochrome family, can oxidize a variety of small molecule substrates including xenobiotics, ethanol, and fatty acids [34] . CYP2E1 expression and activity in the liver are increased in humans and in animal models of NAFLD, which is considered to be the critical \"hit\" in the transition from benign steatosis to steatohepatitis [34] . In this work, LJEE treatment suppressed CYP2E1 expression, and reduced hepatic MDA level, a marker of lipid peroxidation, in MCDD-fed mice, indicating that treatment with LJEE could abate MCDD-induced oxidative stress in livers.",

TNF\u03b1 is an inflammatory cytokine that plays a major role in the progression from steatosis to NASH, and causes secretion of various other cytokines and chemokines [36] . Among these secreted cytokines, the most important one is TGF-\u03b2, which plays a pivotal role in hepatic fibrogenesis through hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation [37] . HSC activation by TNF\u03b1 and TGF-\u03b2 results in the expression and deposition of \u03b1-SMA and collagen [38] . TNF\u03b1 also modulates several matrix metalloproteinases that are involved in liver injury, repair, and remodeling, with MMP1 and MMP9 the most relevant MMPs with regards to liver disease [39] . The present study demonstrates that LJEE lowers mRNA levels of hepatic TNF\u03b1 and TGF\u03b2 that are otherwise higher following MCDD feeding. The increased expression of \u03b1-SMA and various extracellular matrix-related factors such as collagen I, MMP2, and MMP9 in the livers of MCDD fed mice were also diminished by LJEE treatment. Results from the present research suggest the attenuation of the second hit by LJEE improved liver inflammation and fibrosis induced by the MCDD.",

Increased JNK phosphorylation has been reported in NASH model mice, whereas p38 pathway remained unaffected by MCDD [42] . Our data, in full agreement with the published reports [43] , demonstrated that MCDD has led to higher phosphorylation of JNK; treatment with LJEE decreased JNK phosphorylation in the NASH model mice. Although inhibition of p38 activation did show a clear association with the benefit effect of LJEE to attenuate hyperglycemia-affected renal dysfunction [15] , our data showed that activation of p38 was affected by neither MCDD nor the LJEE administration. In addition, it has been reported that ERK MAPK pathway is not involved in MCDD-induced NASH, however its activation is reported to decrease DGAT2 expression; ERK activation is probably required for the treatment of the disease [42, 44] . In this study, we demonstrated that LJEE increased in the extent of ERK phosphorylation, which may lead to increased regeneration of the liver and reduced fat accumulation and inflammation by decreasing the expression of DGAT2, proinflammatory cytokines, and chemokines in NASH. These results suggested that the inhibitory effect of LJEE on the development and progression of NASH is apparently governed by the augmentation of ERK activity and attenuation of JNK activation.",
