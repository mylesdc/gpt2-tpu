DENV infection causes varying degrees of disease manifestation, such as self-limited febrile dengue fever, skin rash or drowsiness, agitation, liver enlargement, or dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and even death. A second DENV infection may lead a life-threatening dengue shock syndrome (DSS) (Abel, Liautaud & Cabie, 2012; Kyle & Harris, 2008; Martina, Koraka & Osterhaus, 2009) .

DENV-caused respiratory disease was revealed (Rodrigues et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2007) , in addition, our previous study showed that the lung carcinoma A549 cells were well susceptible target cells for DENV, these cells have been used in the study model of viral-host interaction. Thus, A549 cells were applied as the screening model in this study (Chang, Liao & Lin, 2006) . The cytotoxic effect of the extracts was evaluated in lung carcinoma A549 cells by WST-1 cell proliferation assay. Except S. divaricatus, extracts from other 23 plants revealed no cytotoxicity effect at the maximum tested concentration, 100 \u00b5g/ml. Therefore, S. divaricatus extracts were excluded in the antiviral screening (Supplementary information, Table S1 ). (Table 1 ). In addition, leaf extracts of F. sarmentosa var. henryi showed an anti-DENV-2 effect, with IC 50 72.04\u00b114.5 \u00b5g/ml, which was higher than for the extracts of F. septica (Table 1 ).",

DENV infection-mediated liver disorder was reported (Samanta & Sharma, 2015; Tristao-Sa et al., 2012) , therefore, the F. septica against DENV1 and DENV-2 but not AiV were also confirmed in the hematoma cell lines, HepG2 and Huh7.5 cells (Figs. 1C and 1E).

A higher dose of F. septica (IC 50 41.1 \u00b1 6.7 \u00b5g/ml) against AiV was determined in WS1 cells, which was not showed in other tested cells types. This data implicated a cell type-specific manner of AiV inhibition by F. septica. However, the precise mechanism remains to be further explored.",
