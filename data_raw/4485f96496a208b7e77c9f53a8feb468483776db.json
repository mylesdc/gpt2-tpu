In particular, several herpesviruses encode microRNAs that seem to be involved in regulating viral latency. Viruses may use microRNAs to regulate sequential patterns of gene expression much like other organisms use microRNAs to regulate key genes that determine progression from one developmental state to another. SV40-encoded microRNAs direct the cleavage of early SV40 transcripts, which encode T antigens [2] . Hepatitis C virus makes use of the microRNA miR-122, which is effi ciently expressed in liver cells and matches a sequence in the viral 5\u2032 untranslated region, to promote its replication [3] . Since viruses have evolved to exploit intrinsic host molecular pathways to promote their own replication, they will be an important tool for probing how microRNAs regulate gene expression even in uninfected cells. Interfering with either virally encoded or host microRNAs required for effi cient viral replication may provide a novel strategy for antiviral therapeutics.

In vitro studies have shown the usefulness of RNAi in replication. This fi gure shows some possible targets for suppressing HIV replication. Silencing CCR5 can prevent viral entry, while any viral gene can also be silenced to interfere with viral production. siRNAs could also target the viral long term repeat or even the proviral genomic RNA prior to integration, although whether this can be done is controversial.

Algorithms for siRNA or short hairpin RNA (shRNA) design provide guidance for designing effective sequences, but this process is imperfect (with a success rate of over 60%). The algorithms do not predict which sequences will be most effective at silencing their target gene. Nor do they predict which sequences maximize viral inhibition and minimize sequence-specifi c offtarget effects arising from unintended silencing of partially homologous genes or from sequence-specifi c binding to Toll-like receptors, which triggers an infl ammatory response. The best candidate siRNA sequences need to be determined by experiment. Offtarget silencing of genes with partial homology is impossible to avoid because inhibition of translation may involve complementarity to just a seven-nucleotide stretch of the siRNA. However, translational inhibition generally has only a small impact on gene expression, can be minimized by avoiding sequences that target important genes, and is unlikely to be an important impediment to the clinical use of RNAi, although clinically signifi cant toxicity from off-target effects will be diffi cult to predict in advance. Off-target effects caused by incorporation of the passenger strand, instead of the antisense strand, of the siRNA into RISC can be avoided by designing the siRNA ends to favor RISC uptake by the intended active strand.",

For any particular virus, a cocktail of siRNAs targeting viral and host genes whose products act at different points in the viral life cycle is likely to act synergistically to suppress viral replication more effectively and hence reduce the chance of viral escape mutation [12] . However, the cellular RNAi machinery has limited capacity since silencing can be suppressed by an excess of irrelevant double-stranded small RNAs, a strategy used by adenovirus for suppressing RNAi [13] . Similarly, gene therapy vectors that express high amounts of shRNAs can cause toxicity by interfering with the nuclear export of endogenous microRNAs [14] .

The small molecule approach is best suited to short-term interventions, while gene therapy can potentially be used for long-term silencing via expression from an integrated transgene. To treat chronic infections, such as HIV or hepatitis C, a gene therapy strategy may make sense. However, concerns about safety and controlling gene expression make gene therapy less practical for immediate applications.",

In the genital tract, siRNAs are taken up deep into the lamina propria and the underlying stroma. The mechanism of uptake is not understood. Most viral infections are transmitted through mucosal surfaces, which provides the opportunity to intervene to prevent or treat viral infections during transmission or acute infection. In mice, local instillation of siRNAs targeting viral genes has shown striking protection against respiratory challenge with infl uenza, parainfl uenza, and respiratory syncytial viruses [15] [16] [17] . The potential for siRNAs to treat viral infection has also been shown in primates challenged with the SARS coronavirus [18] . These encouraging animal experiments have led to the recent fi rst phase I study of siRNAs designed to treat viral infection. This study will begin to test the potential of RNAi for treatment of acute respiratory syncytial virus infection, a leading cause of death and serious morbidity in newborn children.",

Mice were even protected when siRNA administration was delayed until 3 hours after viral challenge. This study suggests the possibility that a persistent antiviral state might be achieved in the genital tract to prevent sexual transmission, reactivation, or even oncogenesis for a variety of sexually transmitted viruses, such as HSV-2, HIV, and human papillomavirus. Topical application of antiviral siRNAs might also be effective at other localized and accessible sites of viral infection, such as the upper respiratory tract, eye (i.e., herpes keratitis), or skin (i.e., warts).",

The main impediments to systemic uptake are the diffi culty in traversing the cell membrane and the short half-life of intravenously injected siRNAs. Several potential solutions to the former problem have been described recently, including covalent conjugation of the passenger siRNA strand to a cell-targeting moiety, noncovalent association of siRNAs with cell-targeting molecules, and incorporation of siRNAs into liposomes or other nanoparticles [7, 20, 21] . The short half-life, which is caused by both rapid renal fi ltration and endogenous ribonuclease digestion, can be readily addressed by incorporating siRNAs into complexes or particles and by minor chemical modifi cations of the RNA backbone. Early studies showing inhibition of hepatitis viral replication required introducing siRNAs via a highvolume bolus (termed hydrodynamic injection) that causes right-sided heart failure and is not suitable for clinical use. Although siRNAs can be effectively introduced into an organ, such as the liver or kidney, by selective catheterization of the principal vein draining the tissue [22] , this is invasive and costly.
