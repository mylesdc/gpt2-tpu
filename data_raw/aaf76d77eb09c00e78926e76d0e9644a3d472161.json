To quantify the plausibility of each model, given the data and the set of four models including Logistic, Gompertz, Rosenzweg, and Richards models, the Bayes factors are calculated and the precise estimates of the best fitted model parameters and key epidemic characteristics have been obtained. In particular, for Ebola the basic reproduction numbers are 1.3522 (95% (95% CI (25630, 25958)), 3916 (95% CI (3865, 3967)), 9886 (95% CI (9740, 10031)), and 12633 (95% CI (12515, 12750)) for West Africa, Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, respectively. The main results confirm that model selection is crucial in evaluating and predicting the important quantities describing the emerging infectious diseases, and arbitrarily picking a model without any consideration of alternatives is problematic.",

In particular, the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa represents the largest outbreak of Ebola virus to date. Public health interventions have been introduced in all affected countries and show the great effects on the infection. However, the numbers of infected cases from Ebola show a trend of bouncing back after declining in February 2015. Those indicate that the outbreak patterns of Ebola in West Africa become more and more complex, and hence it is important to determine the best model by employing mathematical models and model selection methods, which can be used to estimate and predict the characteristics of emerging infectious diseases.",

Several models have been proposed to estimate basic reproduction number, turning point, and final size by cumulated cases; some of them are based on purely empirical relationship, while others have a theoretical basis and are realized by differential equations. The simplest and commonly applied model among all the infectious disease models is the Richards model [3] [4] [5] . By employing Richards model, Hsieh et al. investigated the characteristics including basic reproduction number, turning point, and final size for influenza such as H1N1 [3] , SARS [4] , and Dengue [5] by fitting Richards model to the reported cumulative cases.",

A single wave of infections consisting of a single peak of high incidence, an S-shaped cumulative epidemic curve, and a single turning point of an outbreak can be the best fitting to data using the selected model. Inference and estimation of parameters and their precision are based on the fitted model. Therefore, the interesting questions would be as follows: Can Richards model effectively predict the growth of the cumulative infected population? How to select the best model for fitting the emerging infectious diseases data? Is it possible to predict the turning point and final size and effectively estimate the basic reproduction number which are quite important in the disease control and management?",

The adjusted coefficient of multiple determination that is often used in model selection was found to be a very poor approach [8] . Posada and Buckley [9] pointed out that the Bayesian and Akaikes information criterion (AIC) approaches present several important advantages over other model selection methods. Therefore, in the present work we employ the Bayes factors to select one model from a set of competing models which can capture the underlying disease outbreak best, and further it can be confirmed by calculating AIC values. The basis of the Bayes factor approach to model selection is quantifying the plausibility of each model when the data and the set of candidate models are given. The Bayes factor is a measure of the change from prior model odds to posterior model odds, brought about by the observed data. In this study, we calculate the Bayes factor with the ratio of the selected number of different models and sample from the joint space of product of model and parameters in each model and then estimate the posterior probability of each model using Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithms.",

The AIC values for both Logistic model and Richards model further indicate that these two models are the best. In Figure 3(a) , the numbers of four models which have been selected in the last 2000 runs are 1168, 0, 0, and 832 for models 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 , respectively. It is interesting to notice that the probability for Logistic model is the biggest one and Richards model is the second one, which further confirms that Logistic model is the best model for West Africa data set. In Figure 4 Table 4 and basic reproduction number 0 and turning point based on West Africa data are shown in the second line of Table 5 . The mean estimated generation interval = 12 days given by Chowell and Nishiura [12] is used to calculate the basic reproduction number 0 . Based on Logistic model 0 is estimated to be 1.3522 (95% CI (1.3506, 1.3537)) and the variation in 0 with different generation intervals is shown in Figure 5 For Guinea, the selection results are given in the third line of Table 3 and Figure 3 (b). From Table 3 , Bayes factor\u015d 12 ,\u03021 3 are infinite (>100 naturally), which confirm that there exists decisive evidence for model 1 (i.e., Logistic model) compared with models 2 and 3 . Moreover, both 1 <\u03021 4 = 1.25 < 3 and 1/3 <\u03024 1 = 0.8 < 1 mean that the selection of the Logistic model and the Richards model is uniform and alternating. The AIC values are 1991, 3427, 18476, and 1998 for models 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 , respectively. The AIC values for both Logistic model and Richards model further indicate that these two models are the best for us to fit Guinea data.

Cyan curve represents Logistic model; blue curve represents Gompertz model; red curve represents Rosenzweig model; black curve represents Richards model. 1028, 0, 0, and 972 for models 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 , respectively, which further shows that the Logistic model and the Richards model are the best model for Guinea data set, as shown In Figure 4 (b).

Comparing the actual reported cases and the model predicted cases, on 14 June, 2015, the rates of underestimated or overestimated model are, respectively, \u22125.9%, +2.8%, \u22127.7%, and \u22123.5% for West Africa, Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, as shown in Table 6 . In Liberia, the underestimated rate is bigger than others because the data had changed due to ongoing reclassification, retrospective investigation, and availability of laboratory results, and the data of Liberia had significant adjustments. This also is why 0 for Liberia is the biggest. Note that the reported accumulated cases including confirmed, probable, and suspected cases in Liberia have been revised largely; for example, there are 4665, 6535, and 6525 cases on October 23, October 27, and November 2, 2014, respectively. Similarly, the reported accumulated cases in Sierra Leone are 3896, 5235, and 4759 on October 23, October 27, and November 2, 2014, respectively. Those big differences could result in the big variances in estimating and predicting the outbreaks of Ebola in West Africa. Therefore, the more precise data sets are, the more accurate estimation and predication are.",

Further, many factors such as differences in population densities, realization of control measure, and mobility of the population among regions led to a wide range of reproduction number. Our estimated reproduction numbers from the hospital notifications are in broad agreement with those obtained in studies on data from Mexico (95% CI (1.2, 1.6)) [18] , the United States of America (95% CI (1.7, 1.8)) [19] , and New Zealand (95% CI (1.80, 2.15)) [20] .

That is the reason of the country having entered a 3-month period of heightened vigilance from May 9, 2015, and WHO will maintain an enhanced presence in the country until the end of 2015, with a particular focus on areas that border Guinea and Sierra Leone (http://apps.who.int/ebola/en/current-situation/ebola-situation-report-13-may-2015).",

All those indicate that the model selection depends on the length of the time series. Moreover, Logistic model is a special case of Richards model with the exponent of deviation parameter 1. Therefore, we conclude that Richards model could be chosen firstly when estimating 0 that require more extensive and detailed data [24, 25] . E. Tj\u00f8rve and K. M. C.

For the purpose of computing 0 , we employ the mean estimated generation interval of = 4 days given by Tang et al.[13], which results in the estimation of 0 based on Logistic model (i.e., 0 = 1.9005 (95% CI (1.8869, 1.9142))). The likelihood-based and compartment modelbased estimations of 0 are 1.663 (95% CI (1.273, 2.053)) [13] and 1.682(95% CI (1.446, 1.918))[11] for the period from 3 September to 21 September with a generation time of four days. All those show that in order to evaluate the emerging infectious disease we could employ the simplest model, because it allows us to identify the model parameter values more quickly and it is actually based on a small number of data points, and this is quite important for public health.
