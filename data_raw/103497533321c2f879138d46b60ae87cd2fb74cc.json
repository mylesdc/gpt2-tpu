            "text": "Human norovirus infections are a major disease burden. In this study, we analyzed three new norovirus-specific Nanobodies that interacted with the prototype human norovirus (i.e., genogroup I genotype 1 [GI.1]). We showed that the Nanobodies bound on the side (Nano-7 and Nano-62) and top (Nano-94) of the capsidprotruding (P) domain using X-ray crystallography. Nano-7 and Nano-62 bound at a similar region on the P domain, but the orientations of these two Nanobodies clashed with the shell (S) domain and neighboring P domains on intact particles. This finding suggested that the P domains on the particles should shift in order for Nano-7 and Nano-62 to bind to intact particles. Interestingly, both Nano-7 and Nano-94 were capable of blocking norovirus virus-like particles (VLPs) from binding to histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs), which are important cofactors for norovirus infection. Previously, we showed that the GI.1 HBGA pocket could be blocked with the soluble human milk oligosaccharide 2-fucosyllactose (2=FL). In the current study, we showed that a combined treatment of Nano-7 or Nano-94 with 2=FL enhanced the blocking potential with an additive (Nano-7) or synergistic (Nano-94) effect. We also found that GII Nanobodies with 2=FL also enhanced inhibition. The Nanobody inhibition likely occurred by different mechanisms, including particle aggregation or particle disassembly, whereas 2=FL blocked the HBGA binding site. Overall, these new data showed that the positive effect of the addition of 2=FL was not limited to a single mode of action of Nanobodies or to a single norovirus genogroup. IMPORTANCE The discovery of vulnerable regions on norovirus particles is instrumental in the development of effective inhibitors, particularly for GI noroviruses that are genetically diverse. Analysis of these GI.1-specific Nanobodies has shown that similar to GII norovirus particles, the GI particles have vulnerable regions. The only known cofactor region, the HBGA binding pocket, represents the main target for inhibition. With a combination treatment, i.e., the addition of Nano-7 or Nano-94 with 2=FL, the effect of inhibition was increased. Therefore, combination drug treatments might offer a better approach to combat norovirus infections, especially since the GI genotypes are highly diverse and are continually changing the capsid landscape, and few conserved epitopes have so far been identified.",

The capsid protein can be expressed in insect cells and self-assembles into virus-like particles (VLPs) assumed to be morphologically similar to native virions. The X-ray crystal structure of prototype genogroup I genotype 1 (GI. 1) norovirus VLPs showed that the capsid is divided into two domains, the shell (S) and protruding (P) domains, which are connected via a flexible hinge (4) . The S domain forms the scaffold surrounding the RNA, while the surface-exposed P domains, which are further subdivided in P1 and P2 subdomains, contain the main determinants of antigenicity and host binding epitopes. Norovirus interaction with cofactor histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs) is important for infection (e.g., GI.1, GII.4, GII.10, and GII.17), although certain genotypes poorly bind HBGAs (e.g., GII.1) (5) (6) (7) (8) . HBGAs are found as soluble antigens in saliva and are expressed on epithelial cells. Studies have indicated that norovirus may interact with HBGAs prior to cell attachment (9) and/or bind particles on cell surfaces (10) .",

            "text": "As with many antivirals, insufficient cross-reactivity among the diverse norovirus genotypes appears to be a limiting factor for broad-range therapy (11, 20) . For other viruses, enhanced effectivity has been achieved by joint administration of several compounds. Indeed, current state-of-the-art therapies take advantage of drug combination approaches. Through additive or synergistic effects, the administration of a combination of drugs can enhance the effectiveness without increasing the overall dose. The drugs can interact to magnify their effects, or, by independently acting on different target sites, ultimately the compounds can complement each other to maximize the response rate to generate a highly efficient combination therapy. In the current standard treatment guidelines for HIV infections, three synergistically acting drugs are used. These compounds are from different drug classes and target distinct stages of the virus life cycle to suppress virus proliferation (21) (22) (23) . Investigation of synergistic or additive drug effects is common in antiviral research for a variety of viruses, such as hepatitis B virus (HBV) and dengue virus (19, 24, 25) . Additionally, several studies have shown synergistic effects for viral inhibitors targeting the stage of viral attachment. Combinations of different neutralizing MAbs exhibited positive effects against a number of different viruses, such as HIV, hepatitis C virus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (26) (27) (28) (29) . Furthermore, synergistic inhibition of HIV has been observed for combinations of soluble forms of the receptor CD4 combined with different neutralizing MAbs (30) . Combined antiviral activity of drugs was also demonstrated in studies using rotavirus, another common cause of gastroenteritis. In these studies, combinations of plant extracts or plant-derived compounds were shown to synergistically increase the inhibition of rotavirus replication in vitro (31, 32) .",

Nano-7 interacted with P1 and P2 subdomain residues as well as both P domain monomers, which included both main and side chains (Fig. 3B ). Seven P2 subdomain and four P1 subdomain residues interacted with Nano-7, forming a vast network of direct hydrogen bonds. In addition to hydrogen bonds, electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions with the P1 and P2 subdomain residues were also observed. Overall, Nano-7 was held with copious P domain residues (21 residues and 33 interactions), the most observed to date for any norovirus-specific Nanobody (12, 13) . Indeed, this finding was likely related to the subnanomolar affinity of Nano-7 (Fig. 2) . Interestingly, Nano-7 bound in such a way that the end opposite to the complementarity-determining region (CDR) loops of the Nanobody might contact the S domain and neighboring P domains. Superposition of GI.1 P domain-Nano-7 complex onto the GI.1 VLP structure showed that the Nano-7 clashed with the S domain as well as neighboring P domains (Fig. 4) . This result Examples of the titrations (upper graphs) are shown. The binding isotherm was calculated using a single binding site model after subtraction of the heat of dilution (lower graphs).

In order to better understand why the GI.1 Nanobodies were genotype specific, we aligned capsid sequences of other GI genotypes (Fig. 8) . Overall, the GI capsid sequences were rather variable compared to GII sequences (3, 34) . The Nanobody binding residues were all located in regions of the P domain, which included a mixture of both conserved and variable residues. This finding corresponded well with the lack of Nanobody crossreactivity among other GI genotypes.

We found that Nano-62 weakly blocked VLP attachment to PGM, whereas both Nano-7 and Nano-94 blocked GI.1 VLPs in a dose-dependent manner, with half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC 50 s) of 0.4 g/ml and 9.2 g/ml, respectively. These results were similar to those with GII Nanobodies, where not all Nanobodies were capable of blocking, despite binding at similar regions on the P domain (20) . It is tempting to speculate that the greater number P2 subdomain residues interacting with Nano-7, compared to Nano-62, influenced the ability of Nano-7 to inhibit binding to HBGAs, although direct evidence is lacking. Another mechanism might relate to allosteric inhibition, since a similar finding was observed with several GII-specific Nanobodies (20) .",

Therefore, we examined the possibility that a combination of Nanobody and 2=FL might have an enhanced HBGA-blocking potential. For these PGM-blocking assays, the VLPs were preincubated with serially diluted Nano-7 or Nano-94 combined with a constant 2=FL concentration (10, 20, 30, 40 , and 50 mM 2=FL) (Fig. 11) . The combination of Nano-7 or Nano-94 with 2=FL led to enhanced inhibition, indicating that no adverse effects occur between Nanobodies and 2=FL. Moreover, the extent of inhibition enhancement correlated with increasing 2=FL concentrations, suggesting a synergistic effect (Fig. 11A to C). Therefore, the mathematical model of Bliss independence (36) was used to deter- mine if the Nanobodies and 2=FL acted in an additive or synergistic manner. The combination of Nano-94 and 40 mM or 50 mM 2=FL was not defined as synergistic, since 2=FL alone already showed high inhibition, and the calculated values for expected additive effects exceeded full inhibition ( Fig. 11D and E). According to our 20% criterion for synergistic effects, our data indicated synergism at various Nano-94 and 2=FL concentrations, for example, at 10 mM 2=FL combined with 25, 12.5, and 6.3 g/ml of Nano-94 or at 20 and 30 mM 2=FL combined with 12.5 to 3.1 g/ml of Nano-94. The strongest synergistic effect was observed for combinations with 20 mM 2=FL.

One possible reason might relate to the technique used for preparing the VLPs. During crystallization, the P domain could be compacted on the S domain, whereas for cryo-EM, the vitreous ice layer might allow the P domains to be less compressed. Clearly, a high-resolution cryo-EM structure of GI.1 VLPs would be required to confirm if the sample preparation influenced the VLP structure. Another explanation might simply signify the unique structural difference between the two genogroups.

Nano-62 did not influence the particle structure or inhibit HBGA binding; in contrast, Nano-26 was shown to induce particle disassembly upon binding to GII.10 VLPs, therefore effectively inhibiting HBGA binding (20) . These results suggested that the specific interactions, as well as the Nanobody orientation with respect to the P domain, were important in terms of how Nanobodies could influence viral integrity. This was also stressed by the fact that Nano-7, which attached to a similar binding site as Nano-62, was strongly inhibiting HBGA binding, whereas Nano-62 did not inhibit.",

In this case, Nano-32 induced rearrangement of P domain loops, which subsequently led to an alteration in surface hydrophobicity. For Nano-94, only minor rearrangements of the P domain loops were observed, implying that the mode of aggregation here was different. In both cases, the binding was characterized by positive enthalpy change coupled with large positive entropy change as main contributing factor to the free energy change (\u0394G). Since only minor structural rearrangements in the P domain occurred upon Nanobody binding, the structures of the respective complexes could be fitted very well to the X-ray structure of the GI.1 VLP (4). However, fitting of Nanobody-P domain complexes in all possible positions on the VLP structure revealed sterical clashes on the capsid. Likewise, similar steric clashes were observed for Nano-62. Overall, these results suggested that the GI.1 hinge region between the P and S domains might have intrinsic flexibility to allow Nano-7 and Nano-62 to bind to intact particles.",

In the case of 2=FL and Nano-94, the treatment resulted in a synergistic inhibitory effect. This inhibition might occur by different mechanisms. For example, Nano-94 treatment led to fast and severe aggregation of VLPs, and the remaining nonaggregated VLPs were inhibited with 2=FL. Alternatively, the aggregated VLPs had a reduced number of 2=FL binding sites, and the concentration of 2=FL relative to the remaining available binding sites was higher. For 2=FL and Nano-85, our data suggested that Nano-85 inhibited HBGA attachment by compromising the stability of VLPs (13), while 2=FL inhibited the binding to HBGAs. Compared to 2=FL and Nano-94, the combination treatment of 2=FL and Nano-85 1 VLPs with Nano-94 (orange) led to a considerable diameter increase and particle aggregation compared to those with GI.1 VLPs alone (black). Nano-7 (green) and Nano-62 (cyan) treatment did not affect the particle sizes. Experiments were performed with native-size (T\u03ed3) GI.1 Norwalk virus VLPs. (B) EM analysis of untreated and Nanobody-treated VLPs. Nano-94 treatment produced large aggregates of intact native-size VLPs, whereas Nano-7 and Nano-62 had no obvious changes. caused an additive increase in inhibition. In the case of 2=FL with Nano-7, an additive increase in inhibition also was observed. However, the reasons for the Nano-7 inhibition were not clear, except that Nano-7 bound many more P domain residues than other known Nanobodies (13, 20) , which might have indirectly affected HBGA binding. Overall, these new data showed that the positive effect of the addition of 2=FL was not limited to a single mode of action of Nanobodies or to a single norovirus genogroup.",

They and others concluded that passive Nanobody treatment was safe and had very high efficacy (41) (42) (43) . One of the best-known examples of using Nanobodies against virus infections is for RSV (44) . Researchers showed that intranasal administration of bivalent RSV-specific Nanobodies protected mice from infection. This type of treatment could provide immediate protection for the host and should certainly be further exploited with human noroviruses (13, 20) .

For the blocking assay, microtiter plates (MaxiSorp; Thermo Scientific) were coated with 100 l/well of PGM (10 g/ml; Sigma) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. The plates were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T) and subsequently blocked with 5% skimmed milk in PBS for 1.5 h at room temperature. Nano-7, Nano-62, or Nano-94 was serially diluted in PBS and then added to GI.1 VLPs (final concentration, 0.5 g/ml) for 30 min at room temperature. The plates were washed three times with PBS-T, and then 100 l of each VLP-Nanobody mixture was added to triplicate wells for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. After washing, 100 l of GI.1-specific biotinylated Nanobody 60 (Nano-60) (20) was added. Following a washing step, horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated streptavidin monoclonal antibody was added to the wells and incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. Plates were washed and then developed with o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (OPD) and H 2 O 2 in the dark for 30 min at room temperature. Finally, the reaction was stopped with 3 N HCl, and the absorbance at 490 nm (OD 490 ) was measured. Nano-62 (GI negative control) and 2=FL (GI positive control) were used as controls in each experiment. The OD 490 value of the untreated VLPs was set as the reference value corresponding to 100% binding. The percentage of inhibition was calculated as [1 \u03ea (treated VLP mean OD 490 /mean reference OD 490 )] \u03eb 100. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) was determined using the Prism software (version 6.0) (14) . All experiments with PGM binding were performed in triplicate, and standard deviations were calculated. For the dual Nano-7/Nano-94 and 2=FL treatment, a similar approach was performed, except that the serial dilutions of Nano-7/Nano-94 were combined with constant concentrations of 2=FL (final concentrations, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 mM).",

To evaluate the interaction of Nano-7 and Nano-94 with 2=FL, Bliss independence was employed for data analysis of the HBGA-blocking assays (36, 53) . This model assumes a stochastic process in which both compounds contribute to the final result but act independently by targeting different sites.

If zero interaction applies, the effects of the two drugs are additive, and as a consequence, the measured values of drug combination are close to the calculated theoretical additivity values. If the observed combination values are 20% above the expected additivity values, synergistic effects are implied, and if the observed values are 20% below the expected additivity, antagonism is implied. To determine if the difference between the expected additivity and our observed inhibition was statistically significant, we performed a paired two-tailed t test for all single data points and two-way ANOVA.",
