            "text": "Influenza viruses are among the most important human pathogens and are responsible for annual epidemics and sporadic, potentially devastating pandemics. The humoral immune response plays an important role in the defense against these viruses, providing protection mainly by producing antibodies directed against the hemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein. However, their high genetic variability allows the virus to evade the host immune response and the potential protection offered by seasonal vaccines. The emergence of resistance to antiviral drugs in recent years further limits the options available for the control of influenza. The development of alternative strategies for influenza prophylaxis and therapy is therefore urgently needed. In this study, we describe a human monoclonal antibody (PN-SIA49) that recognizes a highly conserved epitope located on the stem region of the HA and able to neutralize a broad spectrum of influenza viruses belonging to different subtypes (H1, H2 and H5). Furthermore, we describe its protective activity in mice after lethal challenge with H1N1 and H5N1 viruses suggesting a potential application in the treatment of influenza virus infections.",

Infants, immunocompromised individuals and the elderly are particularly susceptible, with 90% of deaths occurring in the latter group [2] . Influenza viruses can also cause pandemics that, although rare, are recurrent events historically associated with high levels of morbidity and mortality [3, 4, 5, 6] . Preventive vaccination has historically been the most efficient measure of influenza control, but this approach presents important limitations due to the accumulation of antigenic mutations in the virus, known as antigenic drift. Vaccines typically elicit a potent neutralizing antibody response limited to the specific viral strains included in the preparation and to closely related viruses [2] . For this reason, seasonal vaccines need to be annually reformulated based upon the forecasting of viral strains that will circulate in the coming influenza season. Furthermore, influenza vaccines have suboptimal immunogenicity and efficacy in the groups at highest risk of severe disease [7] . Moreover in the case of a pandemic, the use of vaccine is limited by the time required for its development and deployment [8] .",

However, the natural and/or acquired resistance to these drugs has been reported [9, 10] . Resistance to adamantanes is prevalent among seasonal and avian influenza A viruses significantly reducing their usefulness [11, 12] . The sudden and widespread emergence of resistance to oseltamivir among prepandemic H1N1 viruses has raised further concerns over the current therapeutic options [13, 14] . Oseltamivir resistance was reported in patients infected with the pandemic H1N1 viruses and highly virulent H5N1 viruses [15, 16] . The resistance to zanamivir is rare [17] , but its use is limited to patients who can actively inhale it, which often excludes young children, impaired older adults or patients with underlying airway disease [14] , that is the groups of patients most vulnerable to serious influenza infection complications.",

The whole IgG molecule was tested in fluorescence inhibition assay, infectious foci formation reduction assay and plaque reduction assay against human, swine and avian influenza A viruses belonging to phylogenetic group 1 (H1N1, H2N2, H5N1 and H9N2) and group 2 (H3N2 and H7N2). The results obtained showed that IgG PN-SIA49 has a stronger neutralizing activity compared to Fab PN-SIA49 (Table 1) [26, 27] . Indeed, IgG PN-SIA49 neutralized all tested viruses belonging to group 1, except the virus strain belonging to H9N2 subtype, with a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) ranging between 0.1-1.9 mg/ml (Table 1 and Figure S1 ). On the contrary, PN-SIA49 showed no neutralizing activity against the viruses belonging to group 2 ( Figure S2 ). These data suggest that the epitope recognized by PN-SIA49 is conserved among group 1 viruses.",

An anti-HCV/E2 mAb (e137) [28] was used as control at 10 mg/ kg. PN-SIA49 protected mice from lethal challenge with WS33 in a dose-dependent manner providing 100% protection (6/6) against death in animals that received 10 mg/kg of the antibody and 83.3% protection (5/6) in animals that received 1 mg/kg ( Figure 1C ). Consistent with the in-vitro neutralizing activity, PN-SIA49 at 10 mg/kg afforded 66.6% protection against lethal H5N1 virus challenge ( Figure 1D ) whereas control mice rapidly succumbed to infection by day 8 post-challenge (p.c.). Surviving mice remained healthy and showed minimal body weight loss (maximum weight loss: 7.2% in WS33 group, 14.4% in VN04 group) over the 2-week observation period. At the conclusion of the experiment, The mean body weight loss was 2.2% in the treated mice challenged with VN04 virus ( Figure 1B ) while mice infected with WS33 regained their full body weight ( Figure 1A ).",

All the other mutations did not have any effect on the antibody PN-SIA49 binding to the HA ( Figure 3 ). To exclude the possiblity that the reduced PN-SIA49 binding to HA was due to reduced expression of HA on the cell surface, we performed a FACS analysis in which wild-type HA and mutants HA were stained with a mouse anti-influenza A HA (H1 subtype) monoclonal antibody. This antibody was directed against a linear epitope in order to evaluate the expression level for each HA on cell surface. As shown in figure S4 , the HA mutants are expressed on the cell surface at a similar levels to that of wild type HA.",

IgG PN-SIA49 neutralizes a broad spectrum of viruses belonging to different influenza subtypes (H1, H2 and H5) and is characterized by the lowest mean IC50 values described to date for a heterosubtypic mAb [20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25] against the influenza subtypes tested in this study (Table S1 ). Furthermore, IgG PN-SIA49 is endowed with a stronger neutralizing activity compared to its monovalent molecule (Table 1) . Indeed, it is well documented in the literature that bivalency of IgG molecule may be an essential feature for the biological activity of a mAb, mostly due to an increase in antibody avidity [33, 34, 35, 36] . The increased avidity may also play an important role in the prophylactic and therapeutic application of an antibody, allowing the administration of smaller amount compared to the Fab fragment. Additionally, the whole IgG molecule has a longer half-life than its fragments, with a consequent prolonged effect of the molecule. For all these reasons, we used IgG PN-SIA49 to treat mice infected with H1N1 and H5N1 viruses and data obtained show that PN-SIA49 protects mice from H1N1 and H5N1 virus lethal challenge suggesting its potential application in treatment of influenza virus infections.",

Each reaction contained 3 ml of the anti-influenza vaccine season 2011-2012 (InflexalV-Crucell), which contains 30 ng of A/California/7/09 (H1N1) HA or 3 ml of the anti-influenza vaccine season 2011-2012 combined with 2 fold molar excess of PN-SIA49. Titron X-100 was added to prevent aggregation of the post-fusion HA. The pH was lowered in all samples except controls using citric acid 0.1 M pH 3. Reactions were mixed, briefly centrifuged and incubated at 37uC for one hour. After incubation, reactions were equilibrated to room temperature and the pH was neutralized by addition of 1 M Tris, pH 9. The actual pH reached was determined in parallel using larger buffer volumes without protein. Trypsin was added to all samples except controls at a final ratio of 1:25 by mass and samples were digested overnight at 37uC. Non-reducing SDS buffer was added to each reaction. Samples were boiled for ,2 minutes and loaded on a nonreducing 4-15% polyacrilamide pre-casted gel (Biorad, Italy). After running, samples were transferred on a PVDF membrane (PerkinElmer, Belgium) for 2 hours at 350 mA. The membrane was then blocked with 5% not fat milk in PBS-Tween20 0,1% (PBST) for 1 h at room temperature and then washed three times with PBST. PN-SIA28, a human anti-HA monoclonal antibody recognizing HA0 [39] , was used as primary antibody at 1 mg/ml in 5% not fat milk-PBST. The membrane was incubated for 1 hour at room temperature and then was washed three times with PBST. Secondary anti-human antibody was added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After incubation the membrane was washed, the substrate solution (SuperSignalH West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate, PIERCE) was added and incubated for 2 min.",

            "text": "The whole antibody molecule was obtained using the BD BaculoGold System (BD Biosciences Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA). Briefly, nucleotide sequences codifying heavy and light chains of the PN-SIA49 Fab fragment were cloned into the baculovirus expression vector pAc-k-Fc (PROGEN Biotechnik GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany). Sf9 insect cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) were co-transfected with the linearized baculovirus DNA (BD Biosciences Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA) and the pAc-k-Fc/PN-SIA49. The obtained virus was inoculated at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5 to infect 16109 High Five insect cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) in a final volume of 1 liter. After an incubation of 96 hours the culture media was collected, clarified by centrifugation and filtered with 0.2 mm filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). The media was loaded into a protein G column (Amersham Biosciences GE Healthcare, Zurich, Switzerland), the antibody was eluted with citric acid 0.1 M, pH 3, and immediately neutralized with Tris Base 1 M, pH 9. The solution containing the antibody was dialyzed against PBS and then concentrated using Amicon Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filter Devices (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). Antibody concentration was determined by SDS-PAGE gel and by spectrophotometric measurement at 280 nm.",
