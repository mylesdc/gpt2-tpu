In 2016, according to US Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry data, one in three patients required at least one course of intravenous (IV) antibiotics to treat a PEx 1 . Exacerbations have a profound impact on the morbidity and quality of life of individuals with CF, and unfortunately PEx outcomes remain suboptimal with poor recovery of baseline lung function following PEx treatment 2 . As a result, efforts are under way within the CF research community to improve the management of these clinically impactful events. The focus of this review is to summarize some of the recent advances that have taken place in our understanding of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of PEx in CF and to provide direction for future study.",

Varying PEx definitions employed in the CF literature have been a major impediment to research progress and have inherently confounded many of the studies included in this review.

However, this definition has been criticized by some experts in the field because the diagnosis of PEx should be independent of the physician's decision to treat and pulmonary function testing limits the age range of patients assessed. Some recent pediatric trials have used the PEx definition employed in the Early Pseudomonas Infection Control (EPIC) trial, which consists of one major criterion (decrease in forced expiratory volume in one second [FEV 1 ] at least 10% from baseline with the previous 6 months; oxygen saturation less than 90% on room air or at least 5% decline from baseline; new lobar infiltrates or atelectasis on chest X-ray; hemoptysis) or two minor symptoms/signs (increased respiratory rate; new or increased adventitial sounds on lung exam; weight loss of at least 5% in the previous 6 months; increased cough; decreased exercise tolerance; increased chest congestion or change in sputum) for at least 5 days or with significant symptom severity 4 .",

Less than half (48%) of these individuals received oral antibiotics prior to admission, suggesting that certain patients may have prolonged symptoms in keeping with PEx but, due to delays in diagnosis, are not started on treatment. For these reasons, there has been a recent focus on home monitoring of symptoms and lung function to promote earlier PEx detection and treatment to prevent irreversible lung damage.",

However, a large multi-center randomized trial recently conducted in the US demonstrated that although electronic home monitoring of symptoms and spirometry is feasible and leads to earlier and more frequent diagnoses of PEx compared with usual care, this strategy does not lead to less lung function lost over 1 year 7 . An earlier diagnosis in the home-monitoring arm led to more frequent use of oral (versus IV) antibiotics compared with the usual-care arm (67% versus 43%), and this might have resulted in a higher rate of non-recovery of FEV 1 % predicted to within 5% of baseline (47% versus 21%) due to a less robust response to oral antibiotic treatment 7 . The authors concluded that identifying PEx earlier may not be sufficient and that future studies must also find better approaches to treatment of exacerbations once they are detected. However, there may still be utility for home monitoring for early PEx detection, particularly for individuals who are poor perceivers of their symptoms, have frequent exacerbations, or reside in rural areas which may delay access to care.",

Furthermore, it should be noted that up to 25% of patients in the STOP trial had their best lung function at the time of PEx diagnosis and therefore a sizeable proportion of patients will be defined as responders even before treatment has started, leading to underestimation of treatment non-response. Most studies have used the best FEV 1 in the 3 months following the end of IV antibiotic treatment as the follow-up FEV 1 , since lung function improvement can continue following the completion of IV antibiotics and therefore end-of-treatment values can underestimate rates of response.",

It was previously hypothesized that viruses could increase bacterial density of chronic colonizing organisms; however, a recent study has refuted this, demonstrating no change in P. aeruginosa density between viral-versus non-viral-associated PEx 17 . Interestingly, anti-viral interferon signaling in response to RSV infection is capable of inducing P. aeruginosa biofilm formation through dysregulated iron homeostasis and this could represent a putative mechanism for viral-triggered PEx but warrants further study 22 . It is also important to note that although there appears to be a strong association between viruses and PEx, this does not necessarily imply a causal relationship, as studies have demonstrated the presence of virus even when patients are well (suggesting asymptomatic nasopharyngeal carriage) 23,24 .",

It is believed by some experts that organisms (such as anaerobes) can interact with the primary pathogen to enhance virulence without a change in density 31 . For example, a recent study evaluating airway bacterial communities with 16S rRNA sequencing found no significant differences in bacterial community diversity or density between paired stable and PEx samples, but there was a change in community structure for a subgroup of patients 26 . Furthermore, the absolute and relative abundance of Gemella spp. increased in the majority of samples from stable to PEx state, and this was most discriminative of health status (stable versus PEx) 26 .",

However, in deciding on the optimal treatment setting, an important factor is not just safety and feasibility but also whether one treatment setting is more efficacious than the other. One small randomized, two-factor, mixed-design comparative study involving 17 adults with CF has been performed and showed similar results for most outcome measures for home and hospital treatment 41 . Owing to selection bias, the results of a larger RCT of the two treatment settings may not be generalizable and will be challenging to interpret because of lack of blinding, attrition bias, high rates of crossover, and lack of standardized resources for home care at various care centers 40 .",

The baseline characteristics between the two groups were similar; however, the hospitalized group had a greater improvement in lung function with a shorter duration of therapy 42 . In a recent observational study of pediatric CF patients from the Epidemiologic Study of CF (ESCF), those with an acute decline in lung function were more likely to recover to within 90% of baseline FEV 1 when receiving treatment as an inpatient versus outpatient 43 . However, observational studies involving treatment are often confounded by indication bias. In other words, patients are not randomly assigned and therefore the intensity of treatments is not standardized between comparisons; ultimately, patients in hospital might receive more intensive treatments. Another recent study that also used the ESCF employed statistical approaches to control for indication bias and found that PEx with a greater proportion of days treated as an inpatient (versus outpatient) with IV antibiotics was more likely to lead to return of FEV 1 % predicted to at least 90% of baseline 44 . Although this observational study is not definitive (as there was likely residual confounding), the benefits of inpatient PEx treatment are likely due to multiple factors other than the IV antibiotics alone, including improved medication adherence, better nutrition, real-time adjustment of adjunct therapies, increased airway clearance treatments, and increased rest.",

There have been no randomized studies examining the duration of IV antibiotics to provide evidence-based recommendations. An observational study that used the US CF Foundation Patient Registry found that FEV 1 % predicted plateaus by day 10 of treatment and duration of treatment did not influence time until next PEx 45 . More recent retrospective data on the benefits of prolonging antibiotic treatment are conflicting, as a study using the Toronto CF Database found improved outcomes with longer treatment duration (>14 days) whereas a larger study using data from the ESCF did not find a significant association between treatment duration and rate of recovery of FEV 1 % predicted to within 90% of baseline 16, 44 . However, as in observational studies of treatment setting, interpretation is limited by indication bias, since patient factors influence treatment duration (patients with lower lung function received longer treatment courses) 45 . A large multi-center study (STOP2) is under way in the US examining IV antibiotic duration since it was identified as the most important research question by CF physicians and patients/caregivers. A divergent trial design is being used and randomly assigns patients to 10 versus 14 days or 14 versus 21 days of IV antibiotics depending on initial symptom and lung function response by day 7 46 .",
