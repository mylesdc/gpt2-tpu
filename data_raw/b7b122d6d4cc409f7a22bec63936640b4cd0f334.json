The recently characterized E protein ion channel activity (EIC) has also been implicated in modulating viral pathogenesis. In this study, we used infectious bronchitis coronavirus (IBV) as a model to study EIC. Two recombinant IBVs (rIBVs) harboring EIC-inactivating mutations -rT16A and rA26F -were serially passaged, and several compensatory mutations were identified in the transmembrane domain (TMD). Two rIBVs harboring these putative EICreverting mutations -rT16A/A26V and rA26F/F14N -were recovered. Compared with the parental rIBV-p65 control, all four EIC mutants exhibited comparable levels of intracellular RNA synthesis, structural protein production, and virion assembly. Our results showed that the IBV EIC contributed to the induction of ER stress response, as up-regulation of ER stress-related genes was markedly reduced in cells infected with the EIC-defective mutants. EIC-defective mutants also formed smaller plaques, released significantly less infectious virions into the culture supernatant, and had lower levels of viral fitness in cell culture. Significantly, all these defective phenotypes were restored in cells infected with the putative EIC revertants. EIC mutations were also implicated in regulating IBV-induced apoptosis, induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and viral pathogenicity in vivo. Taken together, this study highlights the importance of CoV EIC in modulating virion release and various aspects of CoV -host interaction.",

            "text": "Translated from the subgenomic mRNA3 via an internal ribosomal entry mechanism, the E protein is a small (8-12 kDa), integral membrane protein present at a low amount in the virion . Nonetheless, CoV E protein serves an important role in the process of particle assembly, presumably mediated by its ability to induce membrane curvature and its physical interaction with the M protein (Lim and Liu, 2001; Liu et al., 2007) . In fact, co-expression of CoV M and E protein is both necessary and sufficient for the production of virus-like particles (VLPs) in cell culture (Bos et al., 1996; Vennema et al., 1996) . For some CoVs such as mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and SARS-CoV, deletion of the E gene did not completely abolish replication, but the virions were severely crippled with significantly reduced titers (Kuo and Masters, 2003; DeDiego et al., 2007) . Compared with the wild-type control, SARS-CoV lacking the E gene (rSARS-CoV-E) was also significantly attenuated in vivo, presumably due to its deficiency in suppressing host stress response and apoptosis induction (DeDiego et al., 2007 (DeDiego et al., , 2011 . Recently, the PDZ (Postsynaptic density 95, PSD-85; Disks large, Dlg; Zonula occludens-1, ZO-1)-binding motif (PBM) at the C-terminus of SARS-CoV E protein was demonstrated to interact with a host PDZ protein called syntenin and lead to its relocation to the cytoplasm, thereby activating the p38 kinase to induce the expression of proinflammatory cytokines . Therefore, E protein modulates both viral replication and pathogenesis during CoV infection.",

Further structural and biophysical studies have gradually established a cation channel model constituted by the pentameric \u03b1-helical bundle of the transmembrane domain (TMD), which exhibited voltage-independent ion conductance regulated by lipid charges (Torres et al., 2005 (Torres et al., , 2007 Verdi\u00e1-B\u00e1guena et al., 2012) . For SARS-CoV, two mutations in the TMD -N15A and V25F -have been shown to abolish E protein ion channel activity (EIC) (Verdi\u00e1-B\u00e1guena et al., 2012) . Recombinant SARS-CoV harboring either of these two EIC-defective mutations replicated similarly as the wild-type control in cell culture, but the in vivo pathogenicity was dramatically reduced, presumably due to a lower level of calcium efflux and inflammasome activation in the infected cells . However, several studies have shown that the SARS-CoV accessory protein 3a and 8a also harbor ion channel activity (Lu et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2011) , and recombinant SARS-CoV was not viable only when both the E and 3a gene were deleted (Casta\u00f1o-Rodriguez et al., 2018) . This functional redundancy has complicated the mechanistic characterization of EIC in SARS-CoV.",

Two point mutations in the IBV E protein -T16A and A26F -are homologous to the N15A and V25F in the SARS-CoV E protein, respectively (Ruch and Machamer, 2012) . The T16A mutation abolished the ability of IBV E protein to disrupt the Golgi complex and host secretory pathway, but did not impact virus assembly as determined by the level of VLP production (Ruch and Machamer, 2012) . In contrast, IBV E A26F disrupted cellular secretory pathway, but did not support VLP production (Westerbeck and Machamer, 2015) . Using a pH-indicating fluorescent protein pHluorin, it was also found that transfection of IBV E or E A26F , but not E T16A , correlated with an increase of Golgi luminal pH (Westerbeck and Machamer, 2019) . The authors thus concluded that IBV EIC facilitated virion release, presumably by neutralizing the Golgi lumen to protect the S protein from premature proteolytic cleavage (Westerbeck and Machamer, 2019) . However, these studies were based on overexpression experiments and the IBV EIC was not investigated by reverse genetics in the setting of actual infections. Recently, we reported the successful recovery of recombinant IBVs (rIBVs) harboring these two mutations . Compared with the parental control, rT16A and rA26F exhibited similar levels of intracellular viral replication and assembly, but the levels of virion release were significantly reduced .",

Compared with the parental virus, all four EIC mutants exhibited comparable levels of RNA replication, structural protein translation, and intracellular virion assembly. However, the two EIC-inactive mutants formed smaller plaques, released significantly less infectious virions to the supernatant, and had lower levels of viral fitness in cell culture. Remarkably, all these defective phenotypes were restored in cells infected with the putative EIC revertants. Additionally, EIC also contributed to the activation of ER stress response and the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines during IBV infection. Moreover, IBV EIC mutations modulated apoptosis induction and correlated with virulence in embryonated chicken eggs. Taken together, using authentic infection systems, our data establish the important roles of EIC in regulating CoV infection, CoV -host interactions, and viral pathogenesis.",

The two rIBVs harboring channelinactivating mutations reported previously , rT16A and rA26F, were serially passaged in Vero cells. The putative reverting mutation A26V was observed for rT16A in passage 10, and the mutation F14N was observed for rA26F in passage 5 (data not shown). Using reverse genetics, the parental rIBV-p65, the two IC-defective mutants (rT16A and rA26F) and the two corresponding putative revertants (rT16A/A26V and rA26F/F14N) were recovered and plaque-purified. The E gene was sequenced to verify the incorporation of the desired mutations and the absence of additional mutations. The titers of the virus stocks were determined by the TCID50 method. All four mutants achieved high titers comparable to the parental rIBV-p65 with no significant difference among each other ( Figure 1A) . However, striking differences in the plaque phenotypes were observed. Compared with the parental rIBV-p65, the plaque sizes of the IC-defective mutants were significantly smaller, and the rA26F plaques were apparently even smaller than the rT16A plaques (Figures 1B,C) . Unrecognized and not reported in our previous study, such differences in the plaque sizes presumably result from a refined plaque assay protocol with a longer incubation time and the inclusion of 1% FBS in the agarose overlay. Remarkably, plaque sizes of the putative IC revertants returned to similar levels as the parental rIBV-p65 (Figures 1B,C) . Taken together, the data suggest that although EIC does not affect the titers of virus stocks, deficiency of EIC results in a distinctive small plaque phenotype.",

To determine the effect of the EIC-reverting mutations on viral fitness, competition assays were performed between two rIBVs. WT:EIC-defective mutant, WT:revertant, or revertant:EIC-defective mutant was mixed in a ratio of approximately 1:9, and the mixed virus samples were passaged in Vero cells for six times. Consistent with our previous data, the fitness of both rT16A and rA26F were much lower than rIBV-p65, so the two IC mutants were rapidly displaced in a few generations (Figures 4A,D) . In contrast, although the relative abundance of both rT16A/A26V and rA26V/F14N gradually reduced during the competition assay, neither of them was outcompeted by rIBV-p65 at passage 6 ( Figures 4B,E) . Therefore, the fitness of the two EIC-reverting mutants was only slightly lower than that of the parental virus. In line with this, when the EIC-defective mutants were mixed with their corresponding revertants, both IC-defective mutants rapidly lost out in the competition (Figures 4C,F) . Taken together, the data suggest that the EIC-reverting mutations restored, though not completely, the fitness of the corresponding IBV EIC-defective mutants.",

As expected, significant PARP cleavage was detected in cells infected with rIBV-p65 at 28 hpi. Induction of apoptosis was also revealed by the increased cleavage level of N protein, which is also known to be a substrate of effector caspases.

These studies have established the structural basis behind the CoV EIC (Torres et al., 2005) and revealed its significance in modulating the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV (Nieto- Torres et al., , 2015 . However, several studies have shown that the SARS-CoV accessory protein 3a and 8a also harbor IC activity (Lu et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2011) . Moreover, while rSARS-CoV lacking both the E and 3a proteins is not viable (Casta\u00f1o-Rodriguez et al., 2018) , rSARS-CoV lacking the E protein alone is viable, although significantly attenuated in vitro and in vivo DeDiego et al., 2007) . This functional redundancy complicates the interpretations of phenotypes associated with IC mutations in the E protein, as compensatory functions of the accessory proteins need to be taken into consideration. On the contrary, deletion of E gene is lethal for IBV (unpublished data), and no other proteins encoded by the IBV genome is reported to harbor IC activity. Notably, SARS-CoV E protein IC inactive mutants grow similarly as the parental virus, and their slightly lower fitness is only revealed in a long-term (20 passages) competition assay (Nieto- .

In SARS-CoV E protein, N15 is predicted to be located facing the channel lumen; its mutation to alanine presumably compromise the attraction of cation but is not likely to affect the channel architecture . In comparison, V25 is located at monomer-monomer interface of the SARS-CoV E protein, and its mutation to a bulkier phenylalanine is likely to introduce larger structural changes to the ion channel . Such speculations agreed well with the IC-reverting mutations observed during serial passages in vivo and in culture cells. An in situ mutation from alanine to the polar aspartic acid (D) was identified for rSARS-CoV-E-N15A. For rSARS-CoV-E-V25F, multiple compensatory mutations of the V25F-facing TMD residues presumably restored oligomerization and thus channel activity . In our previous study, we have shown that unlike the homologous N15A mutation in SARS-CoV, the T16A mutation in IBV E protein indeed abolished oligomerization, which was partially restored in the T16A/A26V revertant . Additionally, IBV E A26F did not abolish oligomerization and was compensated for by mutations at the N-and C-terminal extramembrane domains . In this study, we identified yet another reverting mutation for A26F -replacement of the bulky aromatic phenylalanine at position 14 with the polar non-charged asparagine. Although conductance measurement has not been performed for IBV E A26F/F14N , phenotypes of the corresponding rIBV strongly suggested that IC activity should be restored. The reciprocal occurrences of IC-reverting mutations at A26 or at location proximal to T16 suggest certain level of functional and/or structural relatedness. While the pentameric model depicts the general structure of CoV E protein ion channels, conformations and monomer-monomer interactions may vary among different CoV species. Further structural and biophysical analysis are thus required to unravel the mechanisms behind the IC-inactivating and IC-reverting mutations of the IBV E protein.",

In contrast, the A26F mutation in IBV E protein retained the ability to disrupt cellular secretory pathway but did not support VLP production (Westerbeck and Machamer, 2015) . In a recent study by the same group, IBV infection, transfection of wild-type IBV E, or transfection of E A26F , but not E T16A , correlated with an increase of Golgi luminal pH (Westerbeck and Machamer, 2019) . The neutralization of Golgi lumen presumably protected IBV S protein from premature cleavage and facilitated the release of infectious virus from the cells (Westerbeck and Machamer, 2019) . Evidence from these studies suggests that the two IC-inactivating mutations might affect virion release via different mechanisms. In this study, we have observed reduced levels of both IBVgRNA and structural proteins in the supernatant of cells infected with rT16A or rA26F, compared with the rIBV-p65 control. Such deficiency in virion release seemed to be more pronounced in the rA26F-infected cells, indicating that the A26F mutation might be comparatively more destructive to the EIC of IBV. However, no apparent difference was observed in the intracellular cleavage patterns of IBV S protein in cells infected with the five rIBV, suggesting that IBV S processing was not significantly affected by the EIC. To reveal the mechanistic involvement of EIC in virion release, it would be very meaningful to determine the levels of Golgi neutralization and S incorporation in cells infected with the EIC-defective mutants and respective revertants.",

Intracellular Ca 2+ is mainly stored in the ER lumen, where it binds with Ca 2+ -binding protein chaperones (such as calreticulin) to facilitate proper folding of nascent proteins in the ER (Michalak et al., 2009) . Therefore, the disturbance of luminal Ca 2+ concentration can substantially impact the ER folding capacity and activate ER stress response. Previous studies have shown that SARS-CoV E protein can form Ca 2+ channels in the ERGIC/Golgi membranes (Nieto-Torres et al., 2015) and that disturbance of cellular Ca 2+ homeostasis may lead to ER stress and cell death (Sano and Reed, 2013) . In previous studies, we have shown that IBV infection induces ER stress and activates the PERK/PKR-eIF2\u03b1 and the IRE1-XBP1 branch of the UPR (Liao et al., 2013; Fung et al., 2014b) . In this study, we observed that the upregulation of ER stressrelated genes was significantly reduced in the absence of IBV EIC. Although in vitro conductance measurement of IBV E was performed with potassium ions , it is quite possible that IBV E protein may also form Ca 2+ channels in the ER, thereby activating ER stress response in the infected cells. Further studies using time lapse Ca 2+ imaging would be helpful to explore this hypothesis. Alternatively, IBV EIC may also induce ER stress indirectly, presumably by disrupting normal cellular secretory pathway or causing structural alterations to the ER/Golgi membrane network.",

In this study, the induction of IL-6 and IL-8 was significantly reduced in cells infected with the EIC mutants, but was restored to levels comparable to the rIBV-p65 control in cells infected with the respective revertants. While it would be interesting to examine the involvement of the inflammasome pathway, induction of proinflammatory cytokines may also be mediated by the ER stress pathway. In fact, overexpression of the MHV S protein was shown to induce ER stress and upregulate the transcription level of CXCL2 (mouse homolog of human IL-8) (Versteeg et al., 2007) . Other UPR effector proteins are also known to participate in the induction of proinflammatory and innate immune response (Fung and Liu, 2014; Fung et al., 2014a) . Similarly, the CoV EIC may either directly or indirectly modulate apoptosis induction. CoV EIC may directly lead to Ca 2+ efflux, which activates apoptosis by directly depolarizing the inner mitochondrial membrane (Giorgi et al., 2008) . Alternatively, CoV EIC may first activate the ER stress and UPR, which then mediates apoptosis via the activation of JNK, CHOP, or caspase 12 (Szegezdi et al., 2006) .",
