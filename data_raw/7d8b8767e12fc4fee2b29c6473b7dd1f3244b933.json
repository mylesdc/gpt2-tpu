            "text": "Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy leads to severe congenital Zika syndrome, which includes microcephaly and other neurological malformations. No therapeutic agents have, so far, been approved for the treatment of ZIKV infection in humans; as such, there is a need for a continuous effort to develop effective and safe antiviral drugs to treat ZIKV-caused diseases. After screening a natural product library, we have herein identified four natural products with anti-ZIKV activity in Vero E6 cells, including gossypol, curcumin, digitonin, and conessine. Except for curcumin, the other three natural products have not been reported before to have anti-ZIKV activity. Among them, gossypol exhibited the strongest inhibitory activity against almost all 10 ZIKV strains tested, including six recent epidemic human strains. The mechanistic study indicated that gossypol could neutralize ZIKV infection by targeting the envelope protein domain III (EDIII) of ZIKV. In contrast, the other natural products inhibited ZIKV infection by targeting the host cell or cell-associated entry and replication stages of ZIKV. A combination of gossypol with any of the three natural products identified in this study, as well as with bortezomib, a previously reported anti-ZIKV compound, exhibited significant combinatorial inhibitory effects against three ZIKV human strains tested. Importantly, gossypol also demonstrated marked potency against all four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV) human strains in vitro. Taken together, this study indicates the potential for further development of these natural products, particularly gossypol, as the lead compound or broad-spectrum inhibitors against ZIKV and other flaviviruses, such as DENV. and fetal death, have been approved. This calls for the development of safe and effective therapeutic agents against ZIKV infection in humans.",

The life cycle of ZIKV involves several crucial steps, including viral attachment to target cell receptors or cofactors, receptor-mediated endocytosis (viral entry), virus-endosomal membrane fusion, and postentry or post-translation stages [9, 10] . In this life cycle, E protein plays a key role in viral entry into target cells and subsequent fusion of virus and cell membranes; thus, ZIKV E protein serves as an important therapeutic target against ZIKV infection [11, 12] .",

Briefly, ZIKV (strain PAN2016, 70~100 plaque-forming unit (PFU); multiplicity of infection (MOI) ~0.001) was incubated with 2-fold serial dilutions of natural products (including curcumin, digitonin and conessine, as well as anti-ZIKV compound control, bortezomib) or DMSO (0.4% vol/vol) control at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. The compound-virus mixtures were then transferred to Vero E6 cells (10 5 /well) and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. For gossypol, ZIKV (strain PAN2016, ~2.5 \u00d7 10 3 PFU; MOI ~0.025) was incubated with serial dilutions of this natural product at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h, and the unbound gossypol was removed by centrifugation after addition of 3% PEG-6000. Gossypol-treated ZIKV was then incubated with Vero E6 cells at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. The cells were washed thoroughly with PBS and overlaid with DMEM containing 1% carboxymethyl cellulose and 2% FBS, followed by in vitro culture at 37 \u00b0C for 4-5 days, and then stained with 0.5% crystal violet. The inhibitory activity of all natural products tested against DENV-1-4, as described above, was performed following the above procedures, except that LLC-MK2 cells were used for infection, and cells were cultured at 37 \u00b0C for 14-16 days before staining with 0.5% crystal violet. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) and IC90 of natural products were calculated based on the concentrations at 50% and 90% plaque reduction, respectively, using the CalcuSyn computer program, as described before [17] .",

Briefly, ZIKV (strain PAN2016, 70~100 plaque-forming unit (PFU); multiplicity of infection (MOI) 0.001) was incubated with 2-fold serial dilutions of natural products (including curcumin, digitonin and conessine, as well as anti-ZIKV compound control, bortezomib) or DMSO (0.4% vol/vol) control at 37 \u2022 C for 1 h. The compound-virus mixtures were then transferred to Vero E6 cells (10 5 /well) and incubated at 37 \u2022 C for 1 h. For gossypol, ZIKV (strain PAN2016,~2.5 \u00d7 10 3 PFU; MOI~0.025) was incubated with serial dilutions of this natural product at 37 \u2022 C for 1 h, and the unbound gossypol was removed by centrifugation after addition of 3% PEG-6000. Gossypol-treated ZIKV was then incubated with Vero E6 cells at 37 \u2022 C for 1 h. The cells were washed thoroughly with PBS and overlaid with DMEM containing 1% carboxymethyl cellulose and 2% FBS, followed by in vitro culture at 37 \u2022 C for 4-5 days, and then stained with 0.5% crystal violet. The inhibitory activity of all natural products tested against DENV-1-4, as described above, was performed following the above procedures, except that LLC-MK2 cells were used for infection, and cells were cultured at 37 \u2022 C for 14-16 days before staining with 0.5% crystal violet. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) and IC 90 of natural products were calculated based on the concentrations at 50% and 90% plaque reduction, respectively, using the CalcuSyn computer program, as described before [17] .",

Based on Table 1 , four \"hit\" natural products, including gossypol, curcumin, digitonin, and conessine ( Figure 2A -D), were selected, since they demonstrated inhibitory activity against ZIKV infection with no obvious cytotoxicity in Vero E6 cells when observed under a microscope. These natural products were subsequently ordered from Sigma with \u2265 95% purity, and tested for their cytotoxicity using a cell-based cytotoxicity assay (CCK8 kit), with CC 50 values ranging from 14.17 to 323.71 \u00b5M (Table 2, Figure S1 ). Among these natural products, curcumin has been previously reported to inhibit ZIKV infection [37] , whereas the other three natural products have not been previously reported to have anti-ZIKV activity. Gossypol, curcumin, digitonin, and conessine were retested to confirm their anti-ZIKV (strain PAN2016) activity, with IC 50 values of 3.48, 13.67, 4.31, and 9.75 \u00b5M, respectively ( Table 2 ). The IC 90 values of these natural products against ZIKV PAN2016 strain were also calculated, equal to about 6.91, 47.69, 7.91, and 31.82 \u00b5M, respectively, for gossypol, curcumin, digitonin, and conessine ( Figure S1 ), which were slightly higher than the respective IC 50 values, but much lower than the corresponding CC 50 values.

The above data demonstrate that the identified natural products, particularly gossypol, were able to block infections of divergent human, mosquito, and monkey ZIKV strains isolated from different time periods and countries, including six recent ZIKV human strains, confirming their broad-spectrum anti-ZIKV activity.",

            "text": "After completing the above approaches, we gained insight into the potential mechanisms of the natural products responsible for inhibiting ZIKV (PAN2016) infection. After pretreatment of ZIKV with gossypol at 37 \u2022 C before incubation with the target cells, ZIKV completely lost its infectivity, whereas it maintained its infectivity after other treatments described above ( Figure 3B ), suggesting that gossypol can effectively neutralize ZIKV infection by targeting the virus, rather than the cell or cell-associated entry or replication stages. The results from curcumin revealed that about 75-100% of ZIKV infection was blocked when curcumin was incubated with ZIKV only at 37 \u2022 C, or coincubated with ZIKV and cells at 4 \u2022 C or 37 \u2022 C, whereas there was low to no impact on ZIKV infection when curcumin was pretreated with cells or postincubated with ZIKV-treated cells at 4 \u2022 C and 37 \u2022 C, respectively ( Figure 3C ). These results suggest that curcumin inhibits ZIKV infection at the early stages of viral entry, particularly the viral attachment stage. Pretreatment of Vero E6 cells with digitonin and then with ZIKV or cotreatment of cells with ZIKV and digitonin at 37 \u2022 C significantly (\u226594%) blocked ZIKV infection, whereas preincubation of cells with ZIKV and then with digitonin at 37 \u2022 C, pretreatment of cells with ZIKV at 4 \u2022 C and then with digitonin at 37 \u2022 C, or cotreatment of cells with digitonin and ZIKV at 4 \u2022 C inhibited about 49-74% of ZIKV infection ( Figure 3D ). In contrast, preincubation of digitonin and ZIKV had no effect on ZIKV infection ( Figure 3D ). These results suggest that digitonin could not directly neutralize ZIKV infection, but inhibited ZIKV infection by binding to the viral receptors or inhibiting viral entry (i.e., attachment and membrane fusion or postentry steps). The data from conessine indicated that coincubation of cells with conessine and ZIKV at 37 \u2022 C or postincubation of conessine with ZIKV-treated cells at 4 \u2022 C or 37 \u2022 C resulted in 80-96% inhibition of ZIKV infection, whereas pretreatment of cells with conessine before ZIKV incubation blocked about 38% of ZIKV infection. Nevertheless, preincubation of conessine and ZIKV at 37 \u2022 C or cotreatment of cells with conessine and ZIKV at 4 \u2022 C had very low to no effect on ZIKV infection ( Figure 3E ). These data suggest that conessine does not block ZIKV attachment to the host cell, but inhibits ZIKV infection by targeting virus-cell fusion or postentry step. The above steps of inhibition of ZIKV infection were further proven inhibition of ZIKV infection were further proven by the respective anti-ZIKV compound controls ( Figure 3F-I) . Therefore, the above data confirm the potent inhibitory activity of the identified natural products, particularly gossypol, in blocking ZIKV infection at various stages of the viral life cycle. anti-ZIKV inhibitor, temoporfin [28] , was used as a control for step a. (G) An anti-ZIKV entry (especially in inhibition of the internalization/fusion step) inhibitor, 25-hydroxycholesterol [29] , was used as a control for steps b and e. Anti-ZIKV compound bortezomib was used as a control for step d (H), and a replication inhibitor, NITD008 [30] , for step f (I). The natural product curcumin (C), which has been previously reported to inhibit the attachment of ZIKV to host cells [37] , was used as a control for stage c. The percent inhibition was calculated in the presence or absence of serially diluted natural products. The data are expressed as mean \u00b1 s.e.m. (n = 2). The experiments were performed in Vero E6 cells and repeated three times, with similar results. (F) A potent anti-ZIKV inhibitor, temoporfin [28] , was used as a control for step a.

            "text": "Since gossypol demonstrated the highest antiviral activity individually against all ZIKV strains tested, we next investigated the potential combinatorial effects of the combination of gossypol with three other natural products identified, namely curcumin, digitonin, and conessine, as well as anti-ZIKV compound control (bortezomib). Results demonstrated significant combinatorial inhibitory effects against three ZIKV strains (PAN2016, FLR, and PRVABC59) tested when combining gossypol with any of these natural products, and the CI values ranged from 0.44 to 0.6 \u00b5M, 0.44 to 0.95 \u00b5M, and 0.19 to 0.3 \u00b5M for ZIKV PAN2016, FLR, and PRVABC59 strains, respectively (Tables 3-5 ). The combinations of gossypol with each of these natural products also resulted in the highest enhancement of anti-PRVABC59 activity among the three ZIKV strains tested (Table 5 ). These data show that gossypol can be combined with other inhibitors described above to further increase overall inhibitory activity against current and future emergent ZIKV strains. The above results on the combinatorial effects against ZIKV infection could not exclude the possibility that the observed decrease in IC 50 in the presence of another natural product might result from the enhanced cell death caused by the natural product in combination. Therefore, we also assessed the change of CC 50 of the natural products alone and in combination, and compared the enhancement of CC 50 with that of IC 50 against ZIKV strain PRVABC59. As shown in Table 6 , the cytotoxicity of gossypol in combination with curcumin, digitonin, or conessine was not enhanced. The cytotoxicity of gossypol in combination with bortezomib was slightly increased (1.35-fold), but it was much lower than the enhancement in anti-PRVABC59 activity of gossypol (8.73-fold) in combination with bortezomib. In addition, the cytotoxicity of curcumin and bortezomib, respectively, in combination with gossypol was not enhanced. The cytotoxicity of digitonin or conessine in combination with gossypol was slightly increased by about 2.60-and 5.78-fold, respectively, while they were still lower than the enhancement in anti-PRVABC59 activity of digitonin (5.98-fold) or conessine (6.29-fold) in combination with gossypol. Moreover, the CI values of gossypol with any of the four natural products tested were greater than 1 ( Table 6 ), indicating that there was no combinatorial effect on the cytotoxicity to the test cells. These results suggest that the observed decrease in the IC 50 values of the natural products in combination was not due to the enhancement in cytotoxicity of these natural products. Note: Gossypol with one of the natural products, including curcumin, digitonin, conessine (three lead natural products) or bortezomib (anti-ZIKV compound control), were first mixed according to the molar ratio identified in the above combinational experiment against ZIKV strain PRVABC59, and then added to Vero E6 cells to determine cytotoxicity. The combinatorial cytotoxicity of natural products to Vero E6 cells is expressed as CC 50 ",

Even though all four natural products could inhibit DENV-1-4 infections, results showed that gossypol had the highest potency against DENV-1, DENV-2, and DENV-4 infections, with IC 50 values of 1.87, 1.89, and 2.6 \u00b5M, respectively (Table 7) .

The cytotoxicity of these natural products on LLC-MK2 cells was investigated by a cytotoxicity assay, with the CC 50 values ranging from 14.54 to 302.69 \u00b5M ( Table 7) . The above data indicate the potent anti-DENV activity of the natural products, particularly gossypol, against infections of four DENV human strains with low to no cytotoxicity.

            "text": "Development of safe and effective antiviral therapeutics is urgently needed to treat ZIKV infections and ZIKV-caused diseases, particularly ZIKV-associated microcephaly, fetal death, or neurological diseases [7, [42] [43] [44] [45] . Here, we have identified four small-molecule-based natural products, namely gossypol, curcumin, digitonin, and conessine, with robust anti-ZIKV activities in Vero E6 cells. Among them, gossypol had the greatest potency to block infections of ZIKV for almost all 10 strains isolated from 1947 to 2016 from nine countries and three hosts, including six recent human strains associated with congenital Zika syndrome and other neurological malformations. Time-of-addition-based mechanistic studies indicated that gossypol could neutralize ZIKV infection by targeting the virus rather than the cell or cell-associated ZIKV entry or replication steps. Inhibition assays revealed that gossypol strongly bound to ZIKV E protein, particularly the conserved EDIII, and blocked the binding between ZIKV EDIII and EDIII-specific neutralizing mAbs, rationalizing its efficacious and broad-spectrum anti-ZIKV activity. It appears that the binding between gossypol and ZIKV E/EDIII protein might be nonspecific, since gossypol is also active against other enveloped viruses, including herpes simplex virus type 2, parainfluenza virus type 3, influenza virus, and HIV-1 [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] . Because of the potential toxicity and side effects of gossypol to humans [50] [51] [52] , it might not be a good idea to use this natural product as a drug to treat human diseases, including ZIKV-associated microcephaly and other flavivirus-caused diseases. Nevertheless, the goal of this study is to identify the best active, natural product, then modify it to improve its antiviral activity and drug-like properties and reduce its toxicity. Due to the symmetric nature of the gossypol molecule, there will be better opportunity to defragment its structure to smaller drug-like molecules with higher activity and lower toxicity. Therefore, it is suggested not to use gossypol as the lead molecule, but rather the final drug. Unlike gossypol, digitonin and conessine did not neutralize ZIKV directly, but instead inhibited ZIKV infection at various stages of the life cycle, including viral attachment, membrane fusion, or postentry steps. Notably, digitonin is a glycoalkaloid saponin detergent. It is widely used as a cell membrane permeabilizing agent [53, 54] and a detergent for selective solubilization of membrane proteins [55] [56] [57] ; thus, the antiviral activity of this natural product is likely to be very nonspecific. By comparison, conessine appears to be a good candidate with a decent anti-ZIKV activity and very low cytotoxicity (higher selectivity). However, it is a steroidal alkaloid [58] , which might not be ideal for further optimization. Similar to gossypol, curcumin may directly neutralize ZIKV infection, but it seems to mainly inhibit the early stage (attachment) of virus infection, the mechanism of which is similar to that seen in a previous report using different approaches [37] .",

We have found that gossypol bound to ZIKV E protein, potentially EDIII, suggesting that it may recognize highly conserved regions and sites in the E proteins of ZIKV and DENV. Previously, curcumin was shown to potentially inhibit DENV-2 infection through direct effects on viral particle production or various cellular systems [38] . We have not found studies in the literature reporting on the antiviral activity of curcumin on other serotypes of DENV or the inhibitory effects of gossypol, digitonin, and conessine on ZIKV and other flaviviruses. Thus, the present study provides a rationale for further understanding of anti-DENV and anti-ZIKV mechanisms of these natural products and identifying their potential binding sites in the viral proteins.",

It is interesting to note that combining gossypol with curcumin, digitonin, or conessine resulted in increased combinatorial effect against PRVABC59 strain compared to the FLR strain of ZIKV, potentially because gossypol had more potent anti-FLR activity than anti-PRVABC59 activity when tested individually. Also, such combinations enhanced the individual antiviral activity of curcumin, digitonin, and conessine against the test viruses. We have shown that the combination of gossypol and bortezomib, a licensed proteasome inhibitor previously reported inhibiting ZIKV infection [16, 59] , led to significant combinatorial activity against the three epidemic ZIKV human strains tested. Therefore, our study demonstrates the possibility of combining gossypol with other natural products or compounds to enhance antiviral activity.",

Future observations will be needed to evaluate the protective efficacy of these natural products individually or in combination, or using their defragmented, small drug-like molecules (in the case of gossypol) against ZIKV-caused congenital infection and fetal demise in available animal models. Modification of the structure of gossypol and identification of its derivatives with better antiviral activity, but without cytotoxicity, would be essential for developing a safe and effective anti-ZIKV agent for human use. Also, future studies to evaluate the antiviral activity of modified gossypol or its derivatives against other flaviviruses, both in vitro and in vivo, will be helpful for identification of an effective and safe pan-flavivirus inhibitor. Taken together, the broad-spectrum ability of the identified natural products, especially gossypol, against ZIKV and DENV infections indicates the potential for further development of these small molecules or their derivatives as the lead compounds or effective anti-flavivirus inhibitors.",
