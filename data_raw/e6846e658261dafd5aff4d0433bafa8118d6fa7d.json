            "text": "Lambda interferons (IFN-\u03bbs) are a major component of the innate immune defense to viruses, bacteria, and fungi. In human liver, IFN-\u03bb not only drives antiviral responses, but also promotes inflammation and fibrosis in viral and non-viral diseases. Here we demonstrate that macrophages are primary responders to IFN-\u03bb, uniquely positioned to bridge the gap between IFN-\u03bb producing cells and lymphocyte populations that are not intrinsically responsive to IFN-\u03bb. While CD14 + monocytes do not express the IFN-\u03bb receptor, IFNLR1, sensitivity is quickly gained upon differentiation to macrophages in vitro. IFN-\u03bb stimulates macrophage cytotoxicity and phagocytosis as well as the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and interferon stimulated genes that mediate immune cell chemotaxis and effector functions. In particular, IFN-\u03bb induced CCR5 and CXCR3 chemokines, stimulating T and NK cell migration, as well as subsequent NK cell cytotoxicity. Using immunofluorescence and cell sorting techniques, we confirmed that human liver macrophages expressing CD14 and CD68 are highly responsive to IFN-\u03bb ex vivo. Together, these data highlight a novel role for macrophages in shaping IFN-\u03bb dependent immune responses both directly through pro-inflammatory activity and indirectly by recruiting and activating IFN-\u03bb unresponsive lymphocytes.",

While all IFN-\u03bbs signal through a unique IFNLR1:IL10R\u03b2 receptor complex, they activate a gene signature similar to type I IFNs, IFN-\u03b1, and IFN-\u03b2 (1) . Both type I and III IFNs activate the transcription of hundreds of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) (1) that exhibit numerous autocrine and paracrine antiviral roles. Although IFNs are required to clear most viral infections, prolonged expression due to environmental or genetic factors can stimulate sustained immune activation, driving tissue damage, and fibrosis (2, 3) .",

In humans, epithelial cells within the lung, intestine and liver among others, are uniquely IFN-\u03bb sensitive. In particular, IFN-\u03bbs have been shown to protect against pulmonary influenza and human metapneumovirus (HMPV) (7, 8) , gastrointestinal rotavirus and norovirus (9, 10) and hepatic HBV and HCV (11, 12) . While the majority of human studies have been performed in vitro, murine studies have shown potent antiviral effects of IFN-\u03bbs against numerous viruses including influenza and SARS coronavirus (13, 14) , rotavirus, norovirus, and reovirus (15) (16) (17) . It should be noted that IFNLR1 expression may differ between humans and mice, as exemplified in murine hepatocytes that do not respond to IFN-\u03bb (18) . Immune cells also demonstrate very restricted IFN-\u03bb responsiveness with myeloid immune cell populations harboring the strongest responses: Human dendritic cells (DC) and neutrophils are highly responsive to IFN-\u03bbs (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) , whereas natural killer (NK) and T cells have consistently demonstrated minimal responsiveness (21, 24, 25) . Investigation of monocyte and B cell responsiveness has produced conflicting results (21, 24, (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) , perhaps confounded by studies utilizing co-culture models in the presence of IFN-\u03bb responsive cells (31) (32) (33) .

In vivo, macrophages are responsive to IFN-\u03bb3 and accumulate in inflamed human liver.

DdPCR enables the precise quantification of RNA transcripts by performing the PCR reaction within >10,000 oil droplets, and calculating transcript copies using Poisson's law of small numbers (34) . IFNLR1 expression in freshly isolated monocytes and in M\u03c6s cultured for 7 days with GM-CSF was compared to IFN-\u03bb responsive cells (pDCs) and \"unresponsive\" cells (NK and T cells). Similar to NK and T cells, monocytes expressed minimal IFNLR1 transcript. M\u03c6 and pDC IFNLR1 expression was significantly increased compared to other populations, suggesting IFN-\u03bb responsiveness ( Figure 1A) . Increased abundance of IFNLR1 was confirmed following monocyte to macrophage differentiation using seven datasets from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (35) (Figure S1 ). To assess IFNLR1 expression during differentiation, IFNLR1 expression was quantified over 24 h (qPCR, no differentiation stimulus) and 7 days (flow cytometry, GM-CSF differentiation) following monocyte plating. Expression of the IFNLR1 transcript was quickly increased as early as 16 h post-plating, reaching a 30-fold increase at 24 h ( Figure 1B) . IFNLR1 surface expression was significantly increased at day 3 (monocyte IFNLR1 MFI 927 vs. day 3 M\u03c6 3199) and further increased at day 7 (day 7 M\u03c6 IFNLR1 MFI 10,412) ( Figure 1C) .",

To avoid generating M\u03c6s whose IFN-\u03bb sensitivity is influenced by phenotype skewing, monocytes were differentiated for 7 days with GM-CSF or M-CSF alone, as previously described (37, 38) . The resulting M\u03c6 populations are differentially responsive to inflammatory stimuli, and are thus M1-or M2-shifted while maintaining some baseline characteristics of polarized M\u03c6s ( Figure S3) .When compared to monocyte derived DCs (MDDCs) generated using IL-4 and GM-CSF, the resulting M\u03c6s express elevated surface expression of CD14 and CD16, reduced CD1C, and unlike MDDCs, adhere strongly to culture dishes ( Figure S4 ).

To test this hypothesis, we differentiated monocytes for 7 days with either M-CSF or GM-CSF alone (differentiation stimulus), or in combination with IFN-\u03bb3 (activation stimulus), followed by transcriptional and functional assessment of M\u03c6 phenotype ( Figure 3A) .

UV induced apoptotic K562 cells stained with Zombie Yellow viability stain or DAPI labeled E. coli were incubated with M\u03c6s for 1 h at a ratio of 2:1 and 4:1, respectively. The ratio of double-fluorescent (phagocytic, CD14+) cells to mono-fluorescent (non-phagocytic, CD14+) cells, as measured by flow cytometry (Figure 5A ) was calculated to determine the phagocytic M\u03c6 percentage (Figure 5B ). Confocal microscopy was additionally used to confirm cell engulfment. IFN-\u03bb3 increased phagocytosis of K562 cells (30% increase) and E. coli bacteria (10% increase) in M-M\u03c6 alone. M\u03c6 MFI, indicating of the number of engulfed target cells, was consistent among populations when K562 cells were used as targets, likely reflecting ",

Following incubation, Huh-7 cells were labeled with Epcam, Annexin V, and propidium iodide (PI) to quantify cells undergoing apoptosis ( Figure 5C) . Additionally, Huh-7 and JFH1 infected Huh-7 cultures were used as controls to confirm HCV mediated Huh-7 cell apoptosis, as previously described (45) . M-and GM-M\u03c6s differentiated with IFN-\u03bb3 stimulated an increase of early apoptotic (Annexin V+, PI \u2212 ) cells, by \u223c20 and 90%, respectively, compared to mock treated controls ( Figure 5D ). GM-M\u03c6s alone increased Annexin V+, PI+ cells, representing late apoptosis by \u223c20% following IFN-\u03bb3 treatment. The cytotoxic mechanism by which M\u03c6s killed infected cells has not been determined, but is likely mediated by soluble factors such as TRAIL that is highly inducible following IFN-\u03bb3 treatment in GM-M\u03c6s in particular ( Figure 5E ). Low expression of TRAIL in untreated M\u03c6s may explain the apparent lack of apoptosis following co-culture. In addition, no nitric oxide production by M-or GM-M\u03c6s was found in response to IFN-\u03bb3, bacterial or infected cell stimulus. To validate Huh-7 cell apoptosis results, qPCR for apoptosis markers Caspase 3 (Casp3), Caspase 7 (Casp7), and Bax were performed ( Figure S11) . Coculture with IFN-\u03bb3 differentiated GM-M\u03c6s increased Casp3 and 7 expression by \u223c6-fold in addition to increasing the antiviral response of Huh-7 cells as demonstrated by strong induction of ISGs viperin and ISG15.",

As such, monocytes likely become IFN-\u03bb responsive upon movement into tissue and subsequent differentiation. Upon IFN-\u03bb stimulation, macrophages develop a robust immune-stimulatory gene signature, expressing hundreds of ISGs, cytokines, chemokines, and co-stimulatory molecules to stimulate both autocrine and paracrine immune cell activation (Figure 7) . IFN-\u03bbs are inducible cytokines that drastically increase in abundance upon viral infections, but can also effectively protect against bacterial and fungal insults (46, 47) . Activation of TLRs 3, 4, 5, 7, 9 (48, 49) can drive IFN-\u03bb expression, which is dependent factors including cell type and cellular environment. IFN-\u03bbs are necessary for epithelial barrier protection in the lungs, liver and gastrointestinal tract, however their dysregulation has been associated with a number of diseases that lack an obvious association with microbial infection. These include chronic inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis (50) , systemic lupus erythematosus (51) , and asthma (52) . Consequently, it is important to understand the direct and indirect molecular mechanisms by which IFN-\u03bbs are induced, as well as the responding cellular identities.",

Recent evidence suggests that IFNL genotype influences IFN-\u03bb expression in the liver to facilitate immune cell migration and subsequent inflammation (4, 5) . Unlike IFN-\u03bb4 which is weakly secreted by hepatocytes (53, 54) , IFN-\u03bbs 1-3 are highly expressed, and can exert paracrine effects on surrounding immune cells. This is consistent with reports showing increased M\u03c6 activation in patients possessing the favorable IFNL genotype (55) . The importance of the M\u03c6 response is additionally underscored by the fact that M\u03c6 but not hepatocyte ISG expression is positively associated with both the favorable IFNL genotype that produces increased IFN-\u03bb3 and antiviral response (56, 57) .",

Increased expression of pattern recognition receptors [TLR3, IFIH1 [MDA5], DDX58 [RIG-I]] in response to IFN-\u03bb can increase antigen recognition, as we have shown in Figure 5 . Numerous pro-inflammatory transcription factors including STATs 1-3, IRFs 1, 7, and 9, AP-1, and NF\u03baB components were activated in response to IFN-\u03bb, as demonstrated by an enrichment of their respective target genes (Table S4) . Inflammatory cytokines TNF and IL1B that are known mediators of hepatocyte apoptosis and liver injury were moderately, albeit significantly induced by IFN-\u03bb treatment alone (Figure 3E) , though our data supports additional inflammatory effects of IFN-\u03bb. By strengthening M\u03c6 recognition and response to pathogen associated molecular patterns, IFN-\u03bbs likely sensitize M\u03c6s to inflammatory stimuli, thus amplifying the strength and/or duration of the inflammatory cascade. This has been demonstrated by Liu et al. who showed that IFN-\u03bb1 can promote IL-12 production in TLR7 stimulated M\u03c6s (28) .",

In agreement with RNA-Seq gene expression data, we demonstrated that IFN-\u03bb3 treated GM-M\u03c6s stimulate T and NK cell chemotaxis and subsequent NK cell cytotoxicity. These data suggest that IFN-\u03bbs are strong mediators of the Th1 response and provides a rationale for works by Morrow et al. who showed that IFN-\u03bb3 can increase IFN-\u03b3 secretion and degranulation despite T cell insensitivity to IFN-\u03bb (58). A similar phenotype has been observed in tumor model NK cells, where IFN-\u03bb signaling drives NK cell cytotoxicity, suppression of tumor growth and metastases (33, 59) . This Th1 skewing effect has been further validated using murine models of Th2 diseases where IFN-\u03bb alleviated symptoms of airway disease (60), intestinal inflammation (61), and conjunctivitis (62) .",

This data is consistent with work by Fleetwood et al. that demonstrate a strong dependence on type I IFN signaling in M-CSF over GM-CSF cultured M\u03c6s (37) . Consistent with an M2 phenotype (63), M-M\u03c6s were not particularly efficient at driving immune cell chemotaxis and activation upon IFN-\u03bb3 stimulation, but were significantly more phagocytic than GM-M\u03c6s both at baseline and in response to IFN-\u03bb3.

While DCs have a strong IFN-\u03bb response, they are a small population in the liver and migrate toward proximal lymph nodes in response to infection (65) . Liver M\u03c6s (Kupffer cells) on the other hand consist of the \u223c3/4 of hepatic immune cells, and remain locally to become crucial drivers of localized tissue inflammation (65) .
