The vaccine concept relies on exposure to a subacute dose of a pathogen resulting in protective immune responses [18, 19] . Although it is generally thought that host immune responses are protective against subsequent exposure to a virus, there is evidence from some pathogenic viruses that prior exposure and immune responses to a virus may actually promote greater virus infection or increased pathology in subsequent exposures to the virus [20] . For instance, antibodies were reported to enhance SARS-CoV cell entry [21, 22] and an animal model of SARS-CoV infection in African green monkeys showed increased liver pathology in immunized animals [23] . Antibody enhancement of flavivirus infection occurs in vitro [24] and there is evidence of immune responses to primary infections of dengue virus or feline coronavirus altering secondary infections [25] . For RSV, molecular studies have noted that previously circulating antigenic diversity may influence subsequent group and genotype predominance during the epidemics and this could be responsible for some of the reinfections observed in populations [26] .",

Study details have been previously described [5, [29] [30] [31] . The hospital pneumonia etiology study has been ongoing since 2002 and recruits children aged 0-59 months of age with signs of severe or very severe pneumonia that prompt admission. The household study recruited 483 participants from 47 households between December 2009 and June 2010, collecting nasopharyngeal flocked swabs from each household member twice weekly irrespective of symptoms. For both studies, samples were initially screened for a panel of respiratory viruses including 3 endemic coronaviruses (HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-OC43) using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) [32, 33] . A sample threshold cycle (Ct) value of <35.0 was considered positive for the target virus. The 25 pairs of samples for whole-genome sequencing were selected based on having 2 positive NL63 samples >14 days apart. For individual with multiple positive isolates in each period, the samples with the lowest Ct (highest viral load) were selected. Furthermore, to distinguish prolonged shedding from reinfection, pairs were chosen that had at least 4 NL63-negative samples in the intervening period between positive samples.",

Their phylogeny including the Kilifi spike sequences confirmed the segregation of HCoV-NL63 strains in the S1 region into 2 genotypes (A and B) ( Figure 3A ). Similar to the Kilifi sequences, subclades within these genotypes were evident, mostly clustering by year of isolation. We assigned these subclades into lineages, A0, A1, A2, B0, B1, and B2. We constructed a phylogeny based on the Kilifi (household) and global whole-genome sequences ( Figure 3B ). The household genomes formed a single monophyletic group within the global phylogeny ( Figure 3B ). The temporal occurrence of the 6 lineages based on the spike sequences is shown in Figure 3C . Global and Kilifi spike sequences were aligned and compared to the HCoV-NL63 reference strain (NC_005831) to reveal the spike amino acid differences ( Figure 4A ). These patterns further supported the conclusion that 2 major genotypes of HCoV-NL63 The binding domain for the cellular receptor for HCoV-NL63 (ACE2) resides in the central portion of the spike protein, residues 476-616 [42, 43] , identified by the orange horizontal band marked RBD in Figure 4A top panel. Differences in this region were marked in Figure 4A with several amino acid polymorphisms persisting in multiple samples (eg, I507L, E471D, E572A), suggesting genetic drift or possible positive advantage for these residues.",

When plotted by sample date, 3 patterns were observed. Type 1 pattern: If the total amount of time a subject showed coronavirus-positive samples <14 days or if the subject had only a single coronavirus-positive sample the subject was considered to have a single infection. This group comprised the majority of subjects in the study ( Table 2 ) and no conclusions about repeat infections could be made from this group. If there were at least 2 coronavirus-positive samples and the time between the first and last positive sample was \u226514 days and there were 4 intervening NL6-negative samples, the subject was considered to have a repeat (type 2) infection. A type 2A pattern was defined as having any Ct values in the second half of the period higher than any Ct value in the first half of the period. A type 2B pattern was defined as having any Ct values in the second half of the period lower than any Ct value in the first half of the period. Examples of individuals displaying the 2 patterns are shown in Supplementary Figure 2 . The diagnostic results in Supplementary Figure 2A show individuals with low Ct values initial samples and elevated Ct values in the reinfection samples consistent with a protective effect of prior exposure to the virus. In contrast, the diagnostic results in Supplementary Figure 2B show the reverse pattern with at least 1 reinfection Ct value lower than any Ct value in the initial infection, indicating greater virus growth in the second infection. An analysis of the 3 coronavirus infections monitored in the cohort (HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43) was performed to document the frequencies of these infection patterns across the entire cohort. HCoV-NL63 showed 21%, HCoV-229E showed 5%, and HCoV-OC43 showed 4% type 2 infections (Table 2 ). Among the type 2 infections, type 2A pattern (repeat infection higher Ct) was the majority pattern.

Only a total of 9146 nucleotides of HCoV-NL63 sequence were assembled from the first infections, making it difficult to perform a comparative phylogenetic analysis across pairs. As an alternative approach we applied a more sensitive kmer method to directly genotype the HCoV-NL63 short reads from first and second infection to determine if the repeat infections involved a shift to an alternate HCoV-NL63 genotype. Training sets of all HCoV-NL63 sequences, HCoV-NL63 genotype A sequences, and HCoV-NL63 genotype B sequences (>1000 nt) was retrieved from GenBank and combined with the genotype A or B local spike sequences or the genotype A full genomes. All 30-nt kmer sequences that were present in 1 genotype and not the second were identified (see Methods and Table 3 ) and these genotype-specific kmers were used to classify the coronavirus reads from all 50 samples. Each read from each sample was examined for the presence of genotype-specific kmers. If 20 such kmers or more were identified with the 300-nt read, the read was classified as genotype A or B. Using this method, 259 reads were classified as HCoV-NL63 using a combined HCoV-NL63 kmer set, and 151 of the HCoV-NL63 reads could be classified by genotype and all 151 were genotype A. Second infections were all classified as genotype A, consistent with the phylogenetic analyses (see Figures 2 and  3) , supporting a conclusion that genotype switching between the first and second infection is not required for reinfection.",

Inclusion of global sequences also supported this segregation of the HCoV-NL63 spike sequences into 2 genotypes with sublineages. Notably, the community study observed only genotype A strains (no genotype B) but it is also important to note that the study lasted only 6 months. Further studies will determine if particular genotypes contribute to more severe respiratory infections.",

In most cases, genomic or spike sequences from other parts of the world can be identified that were close to each Kilifi genotype.

            "text": "The observation that infection enhancement can occur after prior exposure to the virus, with strongest enhancement occurring >80 days after initial exposure ( Figure 4C ), is consistent with an immune response playing a role. The majority of the repeat infections showed a pattern of reduced virus replication after prior exposure, which is consistent with the vaccine principle. Also there are likely to be cases of repeat exposure infection ( Figure 4C ). In addition, we speculate that the host's prior exposure to the virus, the host's HLA type, the quantity of virus in inoculum, and the host's health status may influence the outcome of the exposure. If indeed these viruses exploit the host immune response to enhance infection, this mechanism could account for the low evolutionary rate of these viruses. There would be a negative selection of amino acid changes in immune epitopes that would disrupt this enhancement. This study had limitations. Firstly, HCoV-NL63 single infection samples failed to yield full spike region or full genome sequences, most likely related to the low virus titers. Nonetheless, we could generate sufficient signal using a kmer approach ( Table 3) to conclude that genotype switching did not accompany reinfection. We do realize the limitations of the kmer approach to detect specific differences in the reinfecting virus, such as changes in immune epitopes that might accompany reinfection. Secondly, our understanding of the global migration of HCoV-NL63 was hampered by the small number of HCoV-NL63 sequences available in GenBank. The limited global HCoV-NL63 sequence data meant that we could not infer the origins of HCoV-NL63 strains circulating in Kilifi with any detail. Nonetheless, the global data combined with the new Kilifi data from this report revealed a surprising stability in HCoV-NL63 with genotypes detectable globally over 10-15 years of observation. Recent increases in virus sequence surveillance will benefit this field and will provide data for a more detailed understanding of HCoV-NL63 genetic diversity and phylogeography.",

Virus lineages circulated within the community over several years, suggesting no requirement of reintroduction for persistence and hence absence of herd immunity. Reinfections with HCoV-NL63 did not require genotype switching and there were multiple cases where the second infections resulted in higher viral loads than the initial infection, revealing ineffective protective immune responses after initial exposure to the virus. Finally, the new HCoV-NL63 sequences generated here provide useful data for coronavirus surveillance, primer design, and other efforts to document the evolutionary patterns of this virus.",
