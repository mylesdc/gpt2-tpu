We consider this entry route for diseases such as the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), a zoonotic emerging disease with possible transmission within the human species. The majority of the cases have been related to healthcare centers, but transmission is possible between relatives. In an outbreak on South Korea in 2015, only one patient infected more than 70 people during his stay in a hospital emergency room for 3 days (13). According to the data provided at the WHO database (14) Another route of entry is the movement of contaminated vehicles, potential source of transmission of diseases and can also vehicle vectors. Vehicles transporting animals that have not been correctly disinfected could be an important source of pathogens; therefore the animals that are loaded after have a high probability of infection during transport (4, 5) .",
