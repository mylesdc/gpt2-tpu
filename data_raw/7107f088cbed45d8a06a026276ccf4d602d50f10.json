Microglia remain quiescent, unable to perform effector and antigen presentation (APC) functions until activated by injury or infection, and have been suggested to represent the first line of defence for the CNS. Previous studies demonstrated that microglia can be persistently infected by neurotropic mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) which causes meningoencephalitis, myelitis with subsequent axonal loss, and demyelination and serve as a virus-induced model of human neurological disease multiple sclerosis (MS). Current studies revealed that MHV infection is associated with the pronounced activation of microglia during acute inflammation, as evidenced by characteristic changes in cellular morphology and increased expression of microglia-specific proteins, Iba1 (ionized calciumbinding adaptor molecule 1), which is a macrophage/microglia-specific novel calcium-binding protein and involved in membrane ruffling and phagocytosis. During chronic inflammation (day 30 postinfection), microglia were still present within areas of demyelination. Experiments performed in ex vivo spinal cord slice culture and in vitro neonatal microglial culture confirmed direct microglial infection. Our results suggest that MHV can directly infect and activate microglia during acute inflammation, which in turn during chronic inflammation stage causes phagocytosis of myelin sheath leading to chronic inflammatory demyelination.",

            "text": "Microglia are specialized macrophages of the CNS that constitute 5-20% of total glial cells in rodents, depending on the specific neuroanatomical region of the CNS. Microglia are distinguished from neuron as well as glial cells, such as astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, by their origin, morphology, gene expression pattern, and function. While neuron and conventional glial cells are neuroectodermal in origin, microglia are of haematopoietic origin and act as primary responding cells for pathogen infection and injury like monocytes/macrophages in peripheral tissues. Microglia exhibit several features that distinguish them from other populations of macrophages, such as their \"ramified\" branches that emerge from the cell body and communicate with surrounding neurons and other glial cells. Microglia can rapidly respond to infectious and traumatic stimuli and adopt a \"phagocytotic\" nature. Activated microglia are known to produce many proinflammatory mediators including cytokines, chemokines, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and nitric oxide which mainly contribute to the clearance of pathogens or infections. However, prolonged or unwarranted microglial cell activation may result in pathological forms of inflammation which can lead to several neuroinflammatory conditions of the nervous system. Microglia-mediated innate immune response in the CNS is now considered to be potentially one of the major pathogenic factors in a number of CNS neuroinflammatory diseases that lack 2 Clinical and Developmental Immunology the prominent leukocytic infiltrates of adaptive immune responses [1] . Neuroinflammation is associated with many neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and multiple sclerosis (MS) [2] . While AD, PD, and ALS are commonly known to be neurodegenerative disease with underlying neuroinflammatory mechanisms, MS is one of the major chronic inflammatory CNS diseases in humans with heterogeneous (chronic/remitting) clinical presentations and course [3, 4] .",

            "text": "MS is believed to be an autoimmune inflammatory demyelinating disease in which exposure of genetically predisposed people to environmental factors triggers a breakdown in T-cell tolerance to myelin antigens. Demyelination is a complex process, and while the precise mechanisms of this pathology are unclear, inflammatory demyelination is thought to be the result of adaptive immune-mediated responses to myelin antigens in the myelin sheaths of axons and/or in the myelin-forming oligodendrocytes. Most studies have focused on the pathogenic role of myelin-specific CD4 + T cells because of the relatively strong association of susceptibility to MS with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II alleles [5, 6] . There is also increasing recognition of the potential importance of CD8 + T cells in the pathogenesis of demyelination [7, 8] . However, the contribution of innate immune cells in mediating MS pathogenesis has been recently gained attention, as several studies demonstrated the role of various innate immune cells in mediating MS pathogenesis, in particular, the potential anti-inflammatory or proinflammatory function of microglial cells along with its physical interaction with myelin [9] [10] [11] . For long time, microglia were known to be present in the chronic inflammatory demyelinating plaque to remove myelin from the dead sick neuron in MS patients but the emerging recognition of microglia as CNS resident immune cells and their role in CNS health and diseases stimulated substantial efforts to redefine the role and function of microglia in the regulatory mechanisms of demyelination.",

Natural and genetically constructed recombinant MHV strains (generated by targeted RNA recombination) with differential pathological properties were used in several studies to understand the mechanisms of demyelination and concomitant axonal loss [17] [18] [19] [20] . The outcome and degree of MHV-induced disease are dependent on several factors, including the age and strain of the mouse, the strain of MHV, and the route of virus inoculation. Even very closely related strains of MHV differ in pathogenic properties. Some strains of MHV are purely hepatotropic (e.g., MHV-2) [21] ; some are primarily neurotropic (e.g., JHM, MHV-4, an isolate of JHM) [15, 22] ; while others (e.g., MHV-A59 and MHV3) [16, 23] are both hepatotropic and neurotropic. Viral titer reaches its peak at days 3 and 5 postinfection (p.i.) [21] . Infectious virus is cleared within the first 10-14 days; however, at this time mice begin to develop demyelination, either clinical or accompanied by chronic hind limb paralysis [16, 24] . Both MHV-JHM and MHV-A59 cause inflammatory demyelination in the brain and spinal cord whereas MHV3 only causes vasculitis [23, 25] . It was formerly believed that in primary MHV-induced demyelination neuronal axons remain relatively preserved. Recently, it has been shown that axonal damage is, in large part, immune mediated in MHVinfected mice and occurs concomitantly with demyelination. Concurrent axonal loss and demyelination have recently also been observed with S protein recombinant demyelinating strain-infected mouse spinal cord [20] .",

            "text": "Evidence from highly neurovirulent JHM strains of MHV suggests that MHV-induced demyelination is primarily immune mediated [26, 27] . Clearance of infectious virus is mediated by both cytolytic and cytokine-mediated mechanisms and microglia, and T cells modulate pathologic changes. Demyelination can be prevented in JHMinfected lymphocyte-deficient (RAG \u2212/\u2212 ) mice [28] . However, demyelination will occur upon transfer of splenocytes from immunocompetent mice to RAG \u2212/\u2212 mice [28] . It has also been shown by depletion and transfer studies in the JHM model that CD8 + T cells can induce demyelination. These studies suggest that an intact adaptive immune system is required to promote demyelination in JHM-MHV infection. Contrary to these findings, demyelination, induced by MHV-A59, has been shown to develop in adult immunocompromised mice lacking B and T cells [29] . It has also been demonstrated that the depletion of CD4 + or CD8 + T cells after the acute stage of infection does not reduce demyelination [28, 30] . Indeed, MHV-A59 or its isogenic spike protein (hostattachment protein) recombinant strain, RSA59 [19, 20, 31] , induces a MS-like disease in mice mediated by microglia, along with a small population of T cells. The mechanism of demyelination is at least, in part, due to macrophagemediated myelin stripping, with some direct axonal injury as well as without involving the conventional T cells. In our current studies, we have used RSA59 infection in vivo, in vitro, and ex vivo as a model to understand whether MHV can directly infect CNS resident microglia and the mechanism of microglial activation in the induction of chronic demyelination.",

RSA59-induced meningitis (Supplementary Figure 1(a) ), and encephalomyelitis (accumulation of inflammatory cell and perivascular cuffing) ( Supplementary Figures  1(b) and 1(c) ) were observed as shown previously [18, 19] (Supplementary Figure 1 ; these data are partly published but for the ready information compiled in one figure. ). To characterize inflammatory cell types, brain sections from day 7 postinfection were stained immunohistochemically with anti-CD45 (leukocyte common antigen (LCA)), anti-CD11b and/or anti-Iba1 (macrophage/microglial marker), or anti-CD3 (pan T-cell marker) (data not shown). The majority of inflammatory cells in RSA59-infected brains were immunoreactive for both LCA (Supplementary Figure 1(d) ) and CD11b (Supplementary Figure 1(e) ) and Iba1 (Supplementary Figure 1(f) ). Some CD3-stained infiltrating T cells were also found (data not shown), although nonspecific background staining of neurons with available anti-CD3 antibodies made quantification difficult. No CD4-and CD19positive cells but few CD8-positive cells were observed in the inflamed brain and spinal cord sections in RSA59-infected mice (data not shown). Demyelination was observed by LFB staining as early as day 7 as examined (Supplementary Figure 1(h) ) and it reaches its peak at day 30 postinfection (Supplementary Figure 1(i) ) as observed earlier [20, 31] . LFB-stained spinal cord section showed no myelin loss (Supplementary Figure 1(g) ). Together, the data indicate that RSA59 causes meningoencephalitis and demyelination. CNS inflammation consists of a mixed population of inflammatory cells, predominantly macrophages/microglia as well as a smaller population of T lymphocytes as shown previously [17, 20, 37] .",

Previously, it has been demonstrated that neurotropic strains of MHV can directly infect different neural cell types [16, 19, 38, 39] but there is no evidence whether neurotropic strain can directly infect microglia or only acquire activity indirectly due to the infection of other neural cell types. In order to determine the tropism of RSA59 in CNS resident microglia, fourweek-old, MHV-free, C57BL/6 (B6) mice (Jackson Laboratory) were inoculated intracranially with RSA59. Mice were sacrificed at the peak of inflammation (day 6), and the spinal cord sections were prepared for cryostat sectioning. Since RSA59 expresses EGFP, viral antigen was viewed directly by fluorescence microscopy. Identification of CNS resident microglia was performed by using Iba1 as a specific marker for microglia/macrophages [40] . While Iba1 immunofluorescence was observed in both gray and white matter, double fluorescence/immunofluorescence demonstrated dual labelling of EGFP (viral antigen) positive Iba1 positive microglia/macrophages were present only in the white matter of RSA59 infected mice (Figure 1 ). In the white matter, all the microglia (Iba1-positive) were not infected as shown by arrowheads (Figures 1(e) and 1(f) ). In the control mock infected spinal cord section, no double fluorescent labelled cells were observed as expected (data not shown).",

In order to determine whether RSA59 can infect microglial cells in vitro in absence of any neural cells, 2-dayold neonatal microglial cultures were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 2 : 1 with RSA59 or mock infected with noninfected cell lysate. Microglia harvested in the cell suspension by the conventional shake-off method as described earlier [36] were 99 \u00b1 0.5% positive for CD11b staining (Figure 4(a) ). Very few GFAP (astrocyte marker) positive cells were observed in the isolated microglia culture (data not shown). At 0, 6, 12, and 24 hrs after infection, cultures were examined by microscopy for EGFP fluorescence. At 0 and 6 hrs, no fluorescence was observed in the infected culture but at 12 hrs bright fluorescence started to appear denoting the presence of viral antigen in the microglia. At 12 hrs postinfection, infected microglia demonstrated stressed morphology and started to fuse with the neighbouring cells, and at 24 hrs postinfection, most of the infected cells were involved into large syncytia formation (Figure 4(c) ) which is a characteristic of some enveloped RNA viruses and more specifically characteristic of MHV-A59 (parental strain of RSA59), an enveloped demyelinating strain of MHV [41] . Nucleus of the syncytia was very obvious as shown in Figure 4 staining.

Both strains are capable of causing hepatitis, encephalitis, and meningitis. However, the two strains differ in their ability to induce subsequent demyelination and axonal loss [20] . Seven days post infection, RSA59 produces demyelination that is best observed in the spinal cord at day 30 postinfection (peak of inflammation). In contrast, RSMHV2 does not produce demyelination and only rarely demonstrates axonopathic changes in spinal cord white matter [20] . The inability of RSMHV2 to induce demyelination is due in part to a lack of transport of viral antigen (and the subsequent inflammatory reaction) to the white matter. Furthermore, in vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrate deficits in the ability of RSMHV2 to spread between neurons when compared to interneuronal spread by RSA59 [20] . RSA59-induced demyelination occurs in the setting of both axonal degeneration and macrophage mediated myelin stripping along intact axons [20] . While spike glycoprotein mediates spread of viral antigen to white matter through axonal transport, specific mechanisms leading to subsequent demyelination are not known. One plausible explanation is that MHV spreads intra-axonally within gray matter and when it reaches the white matter, viral particles may need to spread directly into oligodendrocytes, astrocyte, and microglia, using the spike protein, and can induce local oligodendroglial dystrophy and inflammation. Viral antigen in white matter axons may be sufficient to trigger an inflammatory response via microglial activation. Infected and activated microglia due to its intrinsic nature of chemotaxis can recruit more microglia to the site of inflammation and strip myelin from the damaged axon and successively cause demyelination.",

Furthermore, the delay in complete development of demyelination following partial resolution of encephalitis (up to 30 days after peak inflammation) documented in previous studies would not be expected [16, 18, 31] . Moreover, ex vivo colocalization of EGFP-positive cells with microglia confirmed that RSA59 can directly infect CNS resident microglia in absence of peripheral immune cells.

Affymetrix microarray analyses for mRNA expression have revealed that expression of inflammatory mediators by MHV infected microglia, including chemokine and inflammatory cytokines. MHV infection of the mouse spinal cord was also associated with increased expression of genes involved in IFN signalling compared to mock-infected controls in the CNS. During chronic infection (day 30 postinfection), microglia are still present within areas of demyelination and microgliaassociated inflammatory mediators are still produced which indicates that microglia are still active. Our results suggest that putative activated microglia and inflammatory mediators contribute to a local CNS microenvironment that eventually regulates viral replication and IFN-gamma production during acute phase of infection. Sequentially, IFN-can activate microglia by promoting phagolysosomes maturation and activation (engulfment of the myelin sheath) leading to demyelination. Affymetrix microarray data warrants further confirmation. Viral infection in the CNS is classically recognized as inflammatory in nature, with meningeal perivascular and parenchymal infiltrates of peripheral leukocytes but RSA59 infection could be an exception where inflammation can proceed with CNS resident glial activation without involving the peripheral immune responses like Rabies virus infection [42] , HIV infection [43] , and prion diseases [44, 45] . In this perspective, it is tempting to speculate that the underlying mechanism of chronic myelin loss in MS could be a combination of persistence of myelin-related autoimmunogens that has escaped self-tolerance with persistence of activated CNS resident microglia which can mediate demyelination by phagocytised myelin.",

The concept of chronic inflammation as opposed to acute inflammation is more relevant in the context of understanding other CNS diseases, more specifically neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease. These neurodegenerative diseases lack the prominent infiltrates of mononuclear cells but the underlying mechanism of inflammation could be through activation of CNS resident microglia. Activation of CNS resident microglia in the context of chronic neuroinflammation as one of the underlying mechanism of neurodegeneration warrants further study. Microglia as the prime components of an intrinsic CNS resident immune system become a major focus in cellular neuroimmunology and, therefore, in neuroinflammation.",

Our current microglial tropism studies revealed that RSA59, an isogenic demyelinating strain of MHV, can infect and activate CNS resident microglia, and microglia can help to mediate demyelination by engulfing myelin debris. RSA59-induced neuroinflammatory models are helpful in understanding direct CNS cellular injury and demyelination that does not require an intact adaptive immune system. Understanding the role of direct CNS resident microglial infection and activation will shed some light on the pathogenesis of CNS inflammatory disease, not only infectious diseases but also chronic CNS disorders. The vision of CNSresident-microglia-driven neuroinflammatory responses in RSA59 with neuropathological consequences has extended the avenue to explore the contribution of microglia in chronic neuroinflammatory CNS diseases.",

Mice were inoculated intracranially with RSA59 or mock-infected and sacrificed at day 7 and day 30 postinfection. Spinal cord sections were stained with antinucleocapsid antiserum and/or anti-Iba1 antisera. At day 7 postinfection, viral antigen is present both in gray and white matter but predominantly in the white matter (a). Similarly, at day 7 postinfection, Iba1-positive cells are scattered throughout the gray and white matter with a tendency of white matter accumulation similar to viral antigen (b). At day 30 post infection majority of the Iba1 positive cell-(c, e) are present in the demyelination plaque (LFB-stained section (d, f)). Day 30 spinal cord sections are shown from two different RSA59-infected mice. Arrows show accumulation of Iba1 in (c, e) and demyelinating plaque in (d, f). Arrow, indicate Iba1-positive cells in the demyelination plaque. postinfection explants, slices were processed for fluorescentimmunostaining with anti Iba1-antibody and EGFP fluorescence was used to detect viral antigen.
