We aimed to establish a remote robot-assisted intubation system (RRAIS) and expected it to improve success rate of pre-hospital ETI. To test the robot's feasibility, 20 pigs were intubated by direct laryngoscope or the robot system. Intubation time, success rate, airway complications were recorded during the experiment. The animal experiment showed that participants achieved a higher success rate in absolute numbers by the robot system. In summary, we have successfully developed a remote robotassisted intubation system. It is promising for RRAIS to improve the success rate of pre-hospital ETI and change the current rescue model.",

Participants in this study achieved a higher first-pass rate and overall success rate in absolute numbers by the robot system, although there was no statistically difference between two groups, which indicated the robot system may be an effective and feasible approach for EMTs. RRAIS can divert intubation job from front-line EMTs to rear specialists who have qualifications and richer experience for ETI. Inexperienced EMTs are just required to put the robot into patient's mouth while the core intubation work is completely done by rear specialists, which reduces the skill demands and frontline time of EMTs.
