            "text": "The recent Ebola virus outbreak has highlighted the therapeutic potential of antisera and renewed interest in this treatment approach. While human convalescent sera may not be readily available in the early stages of an outbreak, antisera of animal origin can be produced in a short time frame. Here, we compared adjuvanted virus-like particles (VLP) with recombinant modified vaccinia virus Ankara and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), both expressing the Ebola virus antigens. The neutralizing antibody titers of rabbits immunized with adjuvanted VLPs were similar to those immunized with the replication-competent VSV, indicating that presentation of the antigen in its native conformation rather than de novo antigen expression is essential for production of functional antibodies. This approach also yielded high-titer antisera against Nipah virus glycoproteins, illustrating that it is transferable to other virus families. Multiple-step immunoglobulin G purification using a two-step 20-40% ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by protein A affinity chromatography resulted in 90% recovery of functionality and sustained in vivo stability. Adjuvanted VLP-based immunization strategies are thus a promising approach for the rapid generation of therapeutic antisera against emerging infections.",

            "text": "Outbreaks of emerging viruses occur with worrying regularity, and while some are quickly controlled locally, others become public health events of global concern. Among the pathogens involved, viruses that can be transmitted directly and cause severe disease with high mortality such as filovirus and henipavirus are considered World Health Organization (WHO) priority pathogens. Until the recent West African Ebola virus (EBOV) epidemic, which resulted in 28,616 confirmed cases and 11,310 deaths, 1,2 EBOV outbreaks were generally small and rapidly contained. 3, 4 The same holds true for Nipah (NiV) and Hendra (HeV) viruses, which so far have mainly caused local clusters of infection, 5, 6 or small outbreaks as the one currently ongoing in India. 7 However, the first NiV outbreak in Malaysia and Singapore in 1998-1999 resulted in 276 documented infections with a case fatality rate of approximately 40%, 8, 9 illustrating the challenges associated with predicting and preparing for such events. Since licensed therapies or vaccines are often not immediately available, patient isolation, supportive care, and contact tracing are the main approaches used to control these outbreaks. 10, 11 There is thus a renewed interest in therapeutic approaches such as convalescent sera or hyperimmune sera of animal origin, which can be rapidly available.",

            "text": "Passive antibody treatment with whole blood or plasma from convalescent patients has been used as experimental therapy during filovirus outbreaks since 1967, 12, 13 with variable results. Whole blood from convalescent donors was given as a postexposure treatment during the 1995 Kikwit outbreak with seven of eight patients surviving the infection. 14 However, post-exposure treatment of nonhuman primates with whole blood from convalescent donors did not replicate the successes seen in human patients. 15 More recently, 84 patients treated with convalescent plasma failed to show significant improvement in survival during the 2014 West African outbreak, 16 but definitive interpretation of these data is difficult because the antibody titers and virus-neutralizing activity of the convalescent plasma was not reported. Post-exposure prophylaxis studies in EBOV-infected nonhuman primates using high-titer purified immunoglobulin G (IgG) from convalescent macaques is fully protective against subsequent challenge, 17 indicating that functional antibody titers may be the determining factor. Neutralizing antibodies are also important mediators of protection against NiV. 18 Post-exposure passive transfer of sera from hamsters immunized with either vaccinia or vesicular stomatitis viruses (VSVs) expressing the NiV-G protein provides protection from lethal virus challenge in a hamster model, 19, 20 as do murine monoclonal antibodies that bind either NiV-F or NiV-G, 21 and a human monoclonal antibody with neutralizing activity against the related Hendra virus G protein in ferrets. 22 In general, passive immunization has proven to be beneficial for numerous acute infections and is still commonly used as emergency treatment against life-threatening diseases. Human IgG preparations are the gold standard for rabies 23 and tetanus 24 post-exposure prophylaxis, and are available as emergency treatment for anthrax. 25 Pooled human IgG for intravenous use (IVIG) is used as a prophylactic and post-exposure treatment against hepatitis B, 26 and is given to patients with complications during measles infection or to those that are at risk for severe disease. 26 While human convalescent sera may not be readily available in outbreak situations, antisera of animal origin can be produced in a short time frame. Animal-origin purified IgG 27 and IgG fragment preparations are still routinely used as antivenoms, and even though immunization of horses with inactivated EBOV failed to yield effective therapeutic antisera, 28 equine hyperimmune sera produced using EBOV virus-like particles (VLPs) conferred protection against lethal challenge in rodents. 29 Here we compared different immunization platforms for the rapid induction of high functional antibody titers against EBOV and NiV, and optimized the subsequent IgG purification process.",

Serum was collected 2 weeks after each immunization and kinetics of total and neutralizing antibody responses were followed. First antibodies against EBOV-GP were detected after 2 weeks, with approximately 10-fold higher titers in the Sigma and TiterMax adjuvant groups. The titers in all groups gradually increased over the course of the immunizations, but while the final titers induced by non-adjuvanted EBOV VLPs were similar to those in the Alhydrogel-adjuvanted and TiterMax-adjuvanted groups, Sigma adjuvant resulted in 10-fold higher final titers (Fig. 1c) . Neutralizing antibody titers were determined by plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) with the recombinant VSV Fig. 1 Ebola VLP production and antibody response kinetics. a, b VLP preparations analyzed after transfection of HEK-293 cells, harvest of the VLP-containing supernatant, purification, and concentration by ultracentrifugation through a sucrose cushion.

To determine the importance of this aspect for the induction of functional antibodies, we compared adjuvanted EBOV VLPs with vector vaccines based on the replication-deficient modified vaccinia Ankara virus (MVA) that expresses either the GP protein of the Zaire EBOV Gu\u00e9ck\u00e9dou strain alone or in combination with VP40 (unpublished data), and the replication-competent VSV\u0394G/EBOV-GP. 34 Due to the around 80% amino acid sequence identity and strong structural and functional conservation among Zaire EBOV-GP proteins, the induced immune responses are cross-reactive within the species. 35, 36 As before, mice were immunized three times in 2-week intervals. Total antibody titers against EBOV-GP increased rapidly after initial immunization in all groups, but in contrast to the adjuvanted EBOV VLPs and the VSV\u0394G/EBOV-GP, there was no further increase after the third immunization with the MVA-based viral vectors (Fig. 2a) . Neutralizing antibodies were detected in MVA/EBOV-GP-immunized groups after the first and MVA/EBOV-VP40/GP-immunized groups after the second immunization and slightly increased to yield final titers around 10 (Fig.  2b ). The first neutralizing antibodies in VSV\u0394G/EBOV-GP animals were also detected after the first immunization with final titers reaching 40 (Fig. 2b) . Even though the neutralizing antibodies were again only detected after the first boost in the group immunized with adjuvanted EBOV VLPs, titers ultimately reached levels around 100 (Fig. 2b) , illustrating that de novo protein expression is not required for efficient induction of functional antibodies.",

First, serum proteins were precipitated in a two-step precipitation using 0.864 and 1.728 M ammonium sulfate followed by IgG affinity chromatography using Protein A. Next, IgG was modified by a pepsin digestion to remove the Fc portion to generate F(ab\u2032) 2 preparations (Fig. 4a) . To accurately compare antibody titers over the course of the purification process, titers are expressed relative to the same volume for all samples. The purification and concentration is illustrated on a Coomassie-stained non-reducing SDS-PAGE gel loaded with the same protein concentration of initial serum, purification intermediates after precipitation, and the IgG and F(ab\u2032) 2 preparations (Fig. 4b) . After ammonium sulfate precipitation, more than 90%, and even after subsequent IgG affinity purification more than 80% of neutralization activity were recovered (Fig. 4c) . Pepsin digest led to around 50% loss of neutralization activity in F(ab\u2032) 2 preparations compared to unmodified serum, indicating that the multi-step purification process results in high yield purified IgG preparations with only little loss of functional antibody titers, and F(ab\u2032) 2 fragmentation with at least 50% recovery of functional activity.",

Monoclonal antibodies that neutralize EBOV, such as KZ52, are protective in some small animal models, 47 but often fail to provide protection in more relevant NHP models. 48 The success of the ZMapp monoclonal antibody cocktail demonstrated that targeting more than one antigenic site, including some non-neutralizing epitopes, improves efficacy. 49 Polyclonal antisera have the advantage of inherently targeting multiple neutralizing and nonneutralizing epitopes of a given antigen, thereby reducing the risk of escape mutant emergence, another known limitation of monoclonal antibody therapies. 50, 51 This broader specificity is also a unique asset at early stages of an outbreak when the pathogen is not yet fully characterized, since cross-reactivity of already available antisera against related strains can be quickly ascertained and may provide an immediate treatment option.",

The strong neutralizing antibody responses seen after immunization with adjuvanted VLPs not only against EBOV but also NiV demonstrates the potential of this approach to be extended to other emerging pathogens. The determinants of VLP formation in other virus families such as flaviviruses, 55 coronaviruses, 56 and orthomyxoviruses 57 are known, and medium-scale to large-scale transient transfection processes are increasingly used for customized antigen or protein production. 58 This could conceivably form the basis of a \"plug-and-play\" system where antigens from emerging viruses are either synthesized or cloned, then expressed and purified using such production processes, and used for immunization of serum-producing animals. The regulatory requirements regarding the quality and safety of antigens and adjuvants used for the production of antisera differ considerably from vaccines, 59,60 as they are not applied directly to patients. Since the manufacturing of therapeutic antisera is antigenindependent, existing processes and facilities could be used with little or no further adaptation to produce such pathogen-specific antisera in an emergency situation. Furthermore, for pathogens with the potential of high public health impact, licensing under the Food Drug Administration \"Animal Rule\" or the EMA \"Orphan Medicines\" designation and subsequent stockpiling could be envisaged. 61, 62 VLPs have long been licensed as hepatitis B or human papillomavirus vaccines, 63 and they are among the candidate platforms for emerging infections. 64 For the generation of therapeutic antisera, VLPs combine several advantages: they are non-infectious and can thus be handled without biosafety concerns, they can be adjuvanted, they are boostable, and they can be produced in a variety of cell lines. 65, 66 For EBOV, the combination of a non-neutralizing antibody targeting the glycan cap makes the monoclonal antibody cocktail ZMapp more potent, 49 indicating that the native glycosylation profile could be one crucial factor in the induction of effective polyclonal antibodies. In general, mammalian expression systems are able to produce post-translational modifications (PTMs), but only human cell lines have the advantage of producing complex proteins with fully human PTMs that are similar to those naturally synthetized in humans. 67 A recent report demonstrates the efficacy of polyclonal antisera generated by immunization with VLPs produced in an insect cell expression system. 29 However, differences in Nglycosylation and O-glycosylation profile between human and insect cell derived filovirus GPs were reported, 68 and may affect the quality of the antisera, and limit the application of this system to other pathogens.",

Precipitated proteins were removed by centrifugation at 3000 \u00d7 g for 20 min at 4\u00b0C. Next, the ammonium sulfate concentration of the supernatant was adjusted to 1.944 M (45% saturation) to remove serum proteins that are more soluble than IgG. After centrifugation, the supernatant was removed and the IgG-containing precipitate was dissolved in the original volume of the serum sample using 0.1 M Tris-HCl. The dissolved precipitate was dialyzed against Tris-buffered saline through a 20 kDa molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) cassettes (Thermo Scientific) before IgG was purified by affinity chromatography using protein A columns (Vivapure Kit, Sartorius) according to the manufacturer's recommendations with some modifications. Briefly, 5 ml precipitated sample was mixed with two volumes of 1.5 M glycine/NaOH, 3 M NaCl, pH 9.0, binding buffer and centrifuged at 150 \u00d7 g for 30 min at room temperature to let the IgG bind to protein A. This step was repeated with the flow through before the column was washed eight times with binding buffer and centrifuged at 500 \u00d7 g for 3 min at room temperature. IgG was eluted in 10 ml 0.2 M glycine/HCl elution buffer with pH 2.5 immediately into 1.3 ml previously prepared 1 M Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, neutralization buffer to bring the samples' pH to approximately 7.5. For concentrating to the original volume and buffer exchange of the IgG sample, 50 kDa MWCO centrifugal column (Vivaspin, Sartorius) were used according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Concentrated IgG was dissolved in PBS for immunization, or 20 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 4 for F(ab\u2032) 2 preparation. To generate F(ab\u2032) 2 fragments, purified IgG in acetate buffer was mixed with pepsin (>2500 U/mg, Sigma) in a 40:1 ratio and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 6 h. The digestion was stopped with the addition of Tris base (pH 11.24) to adjust the final pH to 7.4. F(ab\u2032) 2 fragments were separated from undigested IgG by separation through a 100 kDa MWCO centrifugal concentrator and from remaining peptides and pepsin by separation through a 50 kDa MWCO centrifugal concentrator before dissolving in PBS.",
