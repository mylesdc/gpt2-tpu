The neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) is the only IgG transport receptor, its expression on mucosal surfaces is triggered upon viral stimulation, which significantly enhances mucosal immunity. We utilized TGEV as a model pathogen to explore the role of FcRn in resisting viral invasion in overall intestinal mucosal immunity. TGEV induced FcRn expression by activating NF-\u03baB signaling in porcine small intestinal epithelial (IPEC-J2) cells, however, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. First, using small interfering RNAs, we found that TGEV up-regulated FcRn expression via TLR3, TLR9 and RIG-I. Moreover, TGEV induced IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, TGF-\u03b2, and TNF-\u03b1 production. TGF-\u03b2-stimulated IPEC-J2 cells highly up-regulated FcRn expression, while treatment with a JNK-specific inhibitor down-regulated the expression. TGEV nucleocapsid (N) protein also enhanced FcRn promoter activity via the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway and its central region (aa 128-252) was essential for FcRn activation. Additionally, N protein-mediated FcRn up-regulation promotes IgG transcytosis. Thus, TGEV N protein and TGF-\u03b2 up-regulated FcRn expression, further clarifying the molecular mechanism of up-regulation of FcRn expression by TGEV.",

TGEV has a 28.5-kb singlestranded, positive-sense RNA genome, including at least nine open reading frames (ORFs): ORF1a, ORF1b, Structural proteins, nucleocapsid (N) protein, membrane (M) glycoprotein, spike (S) glycoprotein, a small envelope (E) glycoprotein, and accessory proteins 3a, 3b, and 7 (Escors et al., 2003) . ORF1a and ORF1b, located in the 5 twothirds of the viral genome, are cleaved into 16 non-structural proteins (nsp1 to nsp16) by the nsp3 and nsp5 proteases. These nsps are responsible for viral replication, viral transcription, and the antagonization of host innate immune responses.",

            "text": "Transmissible gastroenteritis virus replication occurs in the small intestinal epithelial cells, while viral entry and release are restricted to the apical surface of polarized epithelial cells. Neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) is a specific receptor for the immunoglobulin IgG, which is expressed in many cells, including epithelial cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells (Ye et al., 2008) . FcRn transports of IgG in the female reproductive tract plays an important role in combating infection (Li et al., 2011) . In addition to IgG, FcRn binds albumin, which regulates liver damage (Pyzik et al., 2017) . It has been found that FcRn can enhance HIV-I endocytosis in transmucosal epithelial cells (Gupta et al., 2013) . It has also been documented that the use of fusion proteins of the Fc fragment as immunogenic antigens can improve the impact of vaccines. Intranasally inoculated fusion protein, HSV-2 gD, HIV Gag fused with the Fc region of IgG, and targeted FcRn can all induce systemic and mucosal immunity to genital infections (Lu et al., 2011; Ye et al., 2011) . Most studies on FcRn have focused on the function of FcRn in humans and mice; so far, only a few relevant studies about pathogenic infection and FcRn expression regulation have been reported. In our previous study, TGEV induced FcRn expression via the NF-\u03baB pathway in IPEC-J2 cells (Guo et al., 2016b) , but the regulatory mechanisms underlying this remain unclear; thus, we need to further explore the involvement of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), inflammatory factors, and virus-coding proteins in the regulation of FcRn.",

            "text": "In the innate immune system, PRRs recognize pathogenassociated molecular patterns (PAMPs) as the first step in the host's resistance to infection. After recognition of PAMPs, these receptors interact with their corresponding binding molecules to trigger downstream signaling events that activate NF-\u03baB and IFN regulatory factors that induce several types of antiviral cytokines (Thompson and Locarnini, 2007) . TGEV infection activates transcriptional activator 1 (JAK-STAT1) signaling pathways according to a quantitative proteomics study in PK-15 cells . TGEV infection has been reported to activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and destroy epithelial barrier integrity in IPEC-J2 cells (Zhao et al., 2014) . TGEV N, nsp2 and nsp14 proteins all induce NF-\u03baB activation (Zhou et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018) , but the regulatory mechanism of FcRn is still unknown. Most studies on TGEV have focused on the induction and activation of NF-\u03baB and IFN, but host cell biology may affect cell function. However, the detailed mucosal immunity mechanism during TGEV pathogenesis remains unknown. Viral invasion always triggers an inflammatory response, which is the key mediator of host response to microbial pathogens (McDonnell et al., 2016) . TGEV infection has been shown to induce the production of IFNs and pro-inflammatory cytokines in vitro and in vivo (Cruz et al., 2013) . A direct correlation between dsRNA antiviral response induction and TGEV virulence has been demonstrated (Cruz et al., 2011) . Moreover, the inflammatory factors produced will also contribute to the production of a strong immune response. TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 can activate NF-\u03baB to up-regulate the expression of human FcRn, which enhances FcRn-mediated IgG transport (Liu et al., 2007) . TGEV infection was also found to induce EMT via TGF\u03b2 in IPEC-J2 cells (Xia et al., 2017) . The aim of this study was to identify the TGEV-encoded proteins involved in inducing FcRn production.",

Transient transfection and RT-qPCR assays proved the low knockout efficiency of each siRNA, and the silencing efficiencies of the siRNAs to these receptors were over 50% (Figure 2A) . The cells were transfected with each siRNA and then infected with TGEV; then, the changes in FcRn expression were detected by RT-qPCR and Western blot. The results showed that, compared with the cells transfected with NC siRNA, siRNA knockdown of TLR3, TLR9, RIG-I, TRIF, and MyD88 effectively reduced the TGEVinduced up-regulation of FcRn, while FcRn mRNA expression was not inhibited in cells transfected with siRNA targeting TLR2, TLR4, or TLR8 ( Figure 2B) . Next, IPEC-J2 cells were transfected with TLR-specific siRNA or NC siRNA. After 12 h, the cells were infected with 1 MOI TGEV for an additional 36 h. Compared with NC siRNA, TLR3, TLR9, RIG-I, TRIF, and MyD88-specific siRNAs inhibited TGEV-induced FcRn expression, while no significant change was detected in s TLR2, TLR4 and TLR8-specific siRNAs (Figures 2C,D) . These data suggest that TGEV infection activates FcRn via TLR3, TLR9, TRIF, MyD88, and RIG-I.

The expression of FcRn was up-regulated by the inflammatory cytokine TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 in a dose-dependent manner, as determined by RT-qPCR (Figures 3A,B) , and this was consistent with that observed in a previous study (Liu et al., 2007) . MAPK is a highly conserved serine protein kinase in the cytoplasm that mediates a signaling pathway that plays an important role in the body's inflammatory response. The MAPK family is mainly divided into three classes: extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), JNKs, and p38 MAPK kinases. Multiple stimulating factors activate the MAPK pathway, including inflammatory factors, growth factors, and cellular responses (Huang et al., 2004) . TGF-\u03b2 dose-dependently induces pIgR production via the p38/MAPK pathway in human bronchial epithelial cells (Ratajczak et al., 2010) . Moreover, TGF\u03b2 was said to inhibit pIgR production in bronchial epithelium (Gohy et al., 2014) . In this study, we observed that TGF-\u03b2 upregulates FcRn via the JNK MAPK pathway, perhaps because TGEV activates the JNK MAPK pathway in porcine cells.",

However, efficient expression was obtained only from plasmids encoding the N, E, 3a, nsp1, nsp2, nsp5, nsp7, nsp8, nsp9, nsp10, nsp13, and nsp14. The expression of viral protein was not high or related to cell type and state. Among these proteins, N was the most potent NF-\u03baB activator, and it induced FcRn expression. The proteins 3a, nsp1, and nsp5 also enhance but have little influence on NF-\u03baB promoter activity. While nsp2 and nsp14 are also potential NF-\u03baB activators, consistent with that reported in previous studies (Zhou et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2018) . Since the essential and multifunctional N protein is fundamental for immune regulation and pathogenesis, we examined it more closely. Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) N protein mediates NF-\u03baB activation through TLR pathways and has functions in cell growth, cell cycle and ER stress (Xu et al., 2013) . In fact, the interaction of TGEV N protein with several host cell proteins has been shown (Zhang et al., 2014 (Zhang et al., , 2015 . In addition, overexpression of TGEV N protein induces cell cycle arrest (Ding et al., 2014a) . Using domainspecific mutations, we determined that the domain at aa 128-252 of the N protein (immunodominant central region) is critical for FcRn activation; it contains a ZnF structure and a SR-rich region. Both the SR-rich truncated proteins of the N protein of SARS coronavirus and PEDV can effectively promote the activation of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway (Zhang et al., 2007; Cao et al., 2015a) .",

NF-\u03baB is a branch of the downstream signaling pathways of TLR and RLR, which also play important roles in various immune responses. Diverse coronaviruses can escape host immune responses via NF-\u03baB activation through different pathways. PEDV activates NF-\u03baB signaling through TLRs, while mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) does so through RLRs (Li et al., 2010; Cao et al., 2015a) . IPEC-J2 cells express mRNA encoding TLR1, TLR2, TLR3, TLR4,  TLR6, TLR8, TLR9, TLR10 , IL-1\u03b1, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-18, TNF\u03b1, and GM-CSF (Bowie and Haga, 2005; Burkey et al., 2009; Mariani et al., 2009) . Rotavirus infection triggers the production of IL-8, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 in IECs by activating the TLR3 and RIG-I pathways (Broquet et al., 2011) . Compared with the NC siRNA, TLR3-, TLR9-, RIG-, MyD88-, and TRIF-specific siRNAs inhibited TGEV-induced FcRn activation, while TLR2-, TLR4-, and TLR8-specific siRNAs did not. We speculate that TGEV activates NF-\u03baB via the TLR3, TLR9, and RIG-I pathways. Our results suggest that TLR3, TLR9, and RIG-I may be used to activate the FcRn signaling pathway when TGEV infects IPEC-J2 cells. Recently, our research has shown that PEDV down-regulate the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway to inhibit FcRn by TLR3 and RIG-I pathway in the early stage of infected piglets (Qian et al., 2019) . PEDV and PDCoV N protein inhibited IFN-\u03b2 by RIG-I pathway (Ding et al., 2014b; Likai et al., 2019) , and we found that TGEV N protein up-regulated FcRn by RIG-I pathway. Moreover, TGEV infection induced IFN-\u03b2 production and PEDV inhibited IFN-\u03b2 production Cao et al., 2015b) . These results may be important causes of PEDV being more pathogenic than TGEV.",

FcRn not only transports IgG, but also transports antigen-antibody complexes, which are taken up by antigenpresenting cells (APCs) (Rath et al., 2013) . When the pathogen stimulates the mucosal epithelium, the expression of FcRn may be regulated. Simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) infection decreases FcRn and pIgR expression, which may also be the mechanism responsible for its pathogenesis in rhesus monkeys (Wang and Yang, 2016) . On the other hand, TGEV up-regulates FcRn expression, which is potentially what provides the mucosal protection. To observe and measure IgG transcytosis in vitro, we applied the transwell system to mimic the porcine intestinal microenvironment, using IPEC-J2 cells to construct the transwell model, our previous research showed that FcRn not only transports specific antibodies across the mucosal epithelium in vitro, but also reduces the yield of TGEV (Guo et al., 2016a) . We speculated that the up-regulation of FcRn by N protein may mediates more TGEV-specific antibody transcytosis across the mucosal epithelium, thereby enhancing the host's anti-infective ability. On the other hand, N protein-enhanced FcRn mediates more IgG immune complex transcytosis, followed by antigen uptake by specialized APCs to activate adaptive immune responses. Overall, we elucidated the immune mechanism of TGEV induced FcRn expression and provided a scientific and theoretical basis for the prevention and control of TGEV infection.",
