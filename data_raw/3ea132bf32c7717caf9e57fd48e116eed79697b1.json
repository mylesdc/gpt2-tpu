The viruses were used as an immobilized target followed by incubation with a 12mer phage display random peptide library. After five rounds of biopanning, phages had a specific binding activity to BRV were isolated. DNA sequencing indicated that phage displayed peptides HVHPPLRPHSDK, HATNHLPTPHNR or YPTHHAHTTPVR were potential ligands to BRV. Using the specific peptide-expressing phages, we developed a phagebased ELISA to differentiate BRV from other viruses. Compared with quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), the phage-mediated ELISA was more suitable for the capture of BRV and the detection limitation of this approach was 0.1 mg/ml of samples. The high sensitivity, specificity and low cross-reactivity for the phage-based ELISA were confirmed in receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis.",

            "text": "Neonatal calf diarrhea (NCD) is a common gastroenteritis infection worldwide, threatening the cattle production and causing substantial economic losses. Group A bovine rotavirus (BRV) is a causative agent of NCD [1] . Rotavirus belongs to the family of Reoviridae and is a non-enveloped virus; its genome is enclosed in three concentric layers and is composed of 11 segments of doublestranded RNA, which encode six structural proteins (VP1 to 4 and VP6 to 7) and five nonstructural proteins (NSP1 to 5) [2, 3] . According to the antigenic and genetic variations in the VP6 region, rotavirus can be divided into seven groups designated A-G. Group A BRV, the major viral pathogen for NCD can further be differentiated into 23 G-(glycoprotein) and 32 P-(protease sensitive protein) types, based on the VP7 and VP4 antigens, respectively [4] . Sporadic outbreaks of BRV in China have been reported recently [5] . Although the clinical course following rotavirus infection is typically short, virus can be detected in faeces for up to 3 weeks post-infection [6] . Some diagnostic procedures such as viral culture, RT-PCR and serology have been proved to be useful for detection of the pathogens, nevertheless, the World Health Organization recommends the use of enzyme immunoassays for the diagnosis of rotavirus infections [7] .",

It is also reported that compounds isolated from the roots of G. uralensis may be potent anti-rotavirus agents in vivo [15] , however, their antiviral effects have not been evaluated clinically. In vaccination, although progress has been made in the development of live, attenuated oral vaccines, improved vaccines are still needed, particularly in developing countries due to the unsatisfactory effect of those vaccines [16] . At present, effective diagnostic tests for screening viruses are important for prevention of BRV.",

In this study, we used the BRV as an immobilized target followed by biopanning process using a 12-mer phage display peptide library to select ligands to this virus. Because the viruses were harvested from the cells, we performed a subtract panning to decrease potential reaction background. Additionally, we gradually increased concentration of Tween 20 to improve the specificity of biopanning. The results showed that the titer of the eluted phages was increased gradually (data not shown). After the last panning, twelve phage clones that were able to bind to BRV were identified by ELISA, in contrast, the control phages had a negligible binding ability to this virus ( Figure 1 ).",

As shown in Figure 2 , the three identified phages were capable of recognizing BRV specifically rather than other control viruses (p,0.01); in contrast, the control phage complex from the phage library had a negligible reaction with these viruses used in this study. As amplification of phage is relatively cheap, the specific phages identified in this study may be specific and inexpensive assay reagents for detection of BRV.

Furthermore, the correlation between phage-based ELISA and qPCR was evaluated by determining the area under the ROC-curve (AUC). As shown in Figure 4 , the ROC-analysis was very high and comparable AUC-values exceeding 0.9 using either the results of YP, HV or HA as one matrix (the ROC-curve of YP, HV and HA was 0.923, 0.914 and 0.921, respectively). As high values close to 1 of the ROC-curve represent a highly accurate test, the phage-mediated ELISA is a rather sensitive diagnostic approach for BRV. The dependency between GE of qPCR and OD extinction values of the established ELISA was analyzed using Spearman's rank test. For the Spearman test, Spearman's rho of YP, HV and HA was 0.710, 0.695 and 0.707, respectively (p,0.01). This result indicates that a stronger correlation between GE in qPCR and OD in phage-based ELISA.

The ROC (receiver operating characteristics) analysis for all samples to each phage detection (YP, HV or HA) was performed, respectively according to the area under the ROC curves (AUC). The results of the qPCR analysis of these samples were used as ''gold standard'' reference. The ROC plots the true positive rate (sensitivity) against the false positive rate (1specificity). The diagonal indicates no discriminatory power. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0028667.g004",
