We revealed that supplementation with SB incorporated into milk replacer can ameliorate the negative impact of heat stress on Holstein dairy calves by increasing dry matter intake (DMI), reducing rectal temperature and heart rate, and alleviating diarrhea via modulating pathogenic bacteria in the digestive tract. The results showed that SB can be used as an alternative anti-stressor in the diet of young dairy calves under heat stress (HS).",

During the TN period for 21 days (d 1 to 21), calves receiving SB showed quadratic or linear effects compared to the control group, showing higher dry matter intake (DMI, p = 0.002), and water consumption (p = 0.007) but lower frequency of fecal diarrhea (p = 0.008), rectal temperature (p < 0.001), heart rate (p < 0.001), and fecal microbiota at 21 day (Escherichia coli, p = 0.025; Enterobacteriaceae, p = 0.041). Meanwhile, calves exposed to HS for 7 days (d 22 to 28) receiving SB showed quadratic or linear effects compared to the control group, showing higher DMI (p = 0.002) but lower water consumption (p = 0.023), rectal temperature (p = 0.026), and cortisol level (p = 0.014). Our results suggest that live SB is useful in the livestock industry as an alternative to conventional medication (especially in times of suspected health problems) that can be added to milk replacer for young dairy calves experiencing HS.",

They can increase vaccination costs and mortality, which in turn could lead to severe economic losses for the livestock industry worldwide [1] . A study by Brickell et al. [2] has reported that approximately half of all deaths among calves up to the first month after birth are due to diarrhea. Calf diarrhea has a complex and multifactorial etiology. For any infectious disease, nutritional, environmental, and herd management factors such as housing type, colostrum intake, and hygienic conditions can be associated with field outbreaks, indicating that these factors may influence the severity and outcome of the disease [3, 4] .",

However, when 1.0 g of a product containing Saccharomyces boulardii CNCM I-1079 (SB; 2 \u00d7 10 10 CFU/g) is incorporated into milk replacer, it does not improve DMI or growth of young calves [10] . Interestingly, less calves have diarrhea or pneumonia if they receive yeasts, regardless of dosages or strains [9, 10] , without noting conditions of ambient temperature and humidity. Calves experiencing HS show elevated body temperature [11] [12] [13] which can increase intestinal permeability of enteric pathogens. Calves exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. coli O55:B5) also show increased body temperature [14] . Meanwhile, yeast can alleviate the effects of HS on the number of undesirable enteric microbes [14] and acute inflammatory responses in swine [15] . However, few data are available on calf responses to SB coupled with HS in a controlled environment. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the effect of SB supplementation in milk replacer on performance and physiological traits of dairy young calves under HS. We hypothesized that serial concentrations of SB ranging from 0.5 to 2.0 g (2 \u00d7 10 10 CFU/g) could reduce responses of calves under HS, such as increasing rectal temperature, heart rate, and frequency of fecal diarrhea.",

A dried yeast of SB, a monogastric or young ruminant specific yeast containing 2.0 \u00d7 10 10 CFU/g of Saccharomyces boulardii CNCM I-1079 with beyond 99% of alive (Eagle Vet Co., Ltd., Chungcheongnam-do, South Korea), was used in this study. The trial length was 28 d with two environmental periods consisting of 21 d of thermal neutral (TN) conditions and 7 d of HS conditions. Calves were housed on straw bedding in one pen with 4 compartments and 12 feeding buckets in a climatic chamber located at Konkuk University Farm Facility.",

Commercial calf starter, rice straw, and water were offered individually in feeding buckets and recorded before the morning feeding. During both experimental periods, calves were fed ad libitum, and residues of each calf starter, rice straw, and water were recorded daily. The calf starter was provided by National Agricultural Cooperative Federation (Konkuk calf starter; Anyang, Korea) to meet nutrition requirements of the National Research Council (NRC) [16] for growing calves. Samples of milk replacer, calf starter, and rice straw were ground to pass a 1-mm screen (standard model 4, Arthur H. Thomas Co., Philadelphia, PA, USA) and chemically analyzed using the standard methods of the association of official analytical chemists (AOAC) [17] for dry matter (135 \u2022 C in drying in the oven for 2 h; method 967.03), crude ash (550 \u2022 C in an ashing furnace for 6 h; method 942.05), crude protein (Kjeldahl procedure; method 976.06), ether extract (method 920.29), and acid detergent fiber (ADFom, method 973.18).

            "text": "We found that DMI of calves in the MSB group was greater (p < 0.05) than those in other groups during periods of TN and HS, except for ADG and feed efficiency ( Table 2) . Although the ADG of calves supplemented with MSB showed a numerical increase compared to others during the experiment period, the increase was not statistically significant. Increased DMI found in the MSB group in the current study was consistent with results in other studies. For example, it has been reported that DMI and body weight (BW) gain in calves are improved when yeast fermentation products are included in calf starter [25] . Water consumption was greater (p < 0.05) in the LSB and MSB groups compared to that in the control group during the TN period. No significant difference in water consumption was found among treatment groups during the HS period. Despite the increases in DMI, BW and ADG barely increased in the present study, in contrast to the results of previous studies, after feeding calves with SB incorporated into milk replacer [9] or by oral infusion [10] . These results suggest that nonfermenting yeast can improve DMI without affecting BW gain or ADG in the growth stage of calves. In the current study, with increasing temperature during the HS period, water intake increased, particularly when the temperature was above 30 \u2022 C compared to the TN period. Increased water intake during the HS period is closely associated with body temperature control in ruminants [26] , because ruminants can control their body temperatures by discharging sweat through skin. For this reason, when animals are exposed to high temperature and high relative humidity, physiological sweat discharge is elevated to control their body temperature. However, no alleviating effect of SB supplementation on water intake of calves during the HS period was observed in the present study.",

            "text": "Regarding physiological parameters, when calves were subjected to HS conditions, the fecal status of the control calves gradually became soft. Some even showed diarrhea. However, calves in all SB groups (LSB, MSB, and HSB) showed lower (p < 0.05) fecal scores during the HS period compared to those in the control group (Table 3) . Rectal temperature and heart rates of calves in SB groups were lower (p < 0.01) than those in the control group throughout the whole experimental period except for calves in the LSB group during the HS period. Consistent with previous studies [9, 10] , the current study also showed that milk replacer supplemented with SB could decrease the rectal temperatures and heart rates of calves, particularly during the HS period. Among hormonal parameters, cortisol concentration has been used as an indicator of stress status in animals [27] . High temperature is a factor that can increase stress of calves, resulting in higher blood cortisol concentrations. For instance, continuous exposure to high heat, or temperatures exceeding 37.7 \u2022 C, for at least six hours can cause a significant increase in cortisol levels [11] . In the current study, no significant difference in serum cortisol concentration was found among treatment groups on day zero. No increase in serum cortisol level of calves receiving MSB supplementation during the TN period was observed either, although the cortisol level of calves supplemented with MSB was lower (p < 0.05) than that in the control group during the HS period. These results suggest that SB diets can alleviate thermal stress experienced by young calves by reducing blood cortisol level. All values in calves were within ranges under normal physiological conditions throughout the whole experimental period.",

During the whole experimental period, S. enteritidis and C. perfringens were not detected in the faeces of calves. Feeding SB to calves increased (p < 0.05) the population of fecal yeast during TN and HS periods, suggesting that SB remaining in the digestive tract could decrease the number of undesirable bacteria through competing for sites of colonization of E. coli and Enterobacteriace during the TN period. In addition, they might provide stability for gut microbiota by decreasing the number of E. coli and Enterobacteriace during the HS period. Increasing the body temperature of calves that experience HS [11] [12] [13] can increase intestinal epithelial permeability responses to enteric pathogens. Additionally, previous studies [28, 29] have reported that calves exposed to LPS (E. coli O55:B5) show increased rectal temperature and body temperature compared to saline-infused calves. These changes are accompanied by the presence of fever, the main indicator of acute inflammatory response. Yeasts including SB possess the ability to reduce the number of undesirable enteric microbes [14] . They can inhibit inflammation associated with immune and cortisol responses in swine [15] . The findings of the current study suggesst that the alleviating effect of SB not only reduced E. coli density in faeces and cortisol level in blood, but also elevated yeast remaining in faeces, leading to decreased rectal temperature and diarrhea frequency in calves experiencing HS.",
