For instance, the 2014 West African Ebola epidemic killed more than 11,000 people over the course of the 30-month epidemic (Kaner & Schaack, 2016) , and outbreaks of SARS and MERS have killed hundreds (de Wit, Doremalen, Falzarano, & Munster, 2016) . Although large-scale vaccination campaigns of wild animals have shown the ability to reduce spillover events in temperate regions (e.g., Europe and North America for rabies in red foxes and raccoons), similar efforts cannot provide the coverage needed for control of most emerging zoonoses because of difficulties in reaching wildlife populations with conventional vaccines in the more remote and inaccessible environments where these pathogens frequently emerge.",

The possible combinations afforded by this approach appear almost unlimited, and the ability to choose vectors from a wide range of possibilities should permit rates and pathways of vaccine transmission to be tuned to at least some degree. However, recombinant vaccines face regulatory issues due to their genetically modified status, and the ability to transmit-a big advantage in pathogen control-may provide a hurdle to regulatory approval. There are multiple means by which transmissible RVVs may overcome potential regulatory issues for their use in wildlife populations.

Although we represent reversion as a simple single-step process, in reality it depends on a complex progression of processes (e.g., mutation, selection, sampling) playing out within-host individuals. We assume the vaccine is continuously administered directly to a fraction, \u03c3, of newborn animals. Although this may be difficult to accomplish in many wild animal populations, it may be possible using the distribution of baits or by directly vaccinating and releasing animals reared in captivity. Our model assumes directly vaccinated animals become infected with the vaccine and recover from vaccine infection at rate, V . Upon recovery, previously infected animals develop lifelong immunity against the target pathogen (hence against the vaccine). The degree of cross-immunity between viral vector and intact vaccine has been shown to influence the efficacy of recombinant vector transmissible vaccines . Here, we study two models that capture the extreme ends of the cross-immunity spectrum. In the first model, we assume a complete absence of cross-immunity; the dynamics of vaccine and vector are independent of each other (Figure 1a ). In the second model, we investigate the opposite extreme, where complete cross-immunity between vector and vaccine exists, leading to strong competition between them for susceptible hosts (Figure 1b ).",

In the absence of cross-immunity, the dynamics of the transmissible vaccine and pathogen can be described without explicitly tracking the density of vector generated by reversion: When a reversion transforms vaccine to vector, the host that was vaccine-infected merely moves back into the pool of susceptible hosts. Consequently, we need follow only the densities of hosts susceptible to vaccine and pathogen (S), infected with vaccine (V), infected with pathogen (P), or recovered from vaccine infection (R V ) or pathogen infection (R P ) and immune to infection by both vaccine and pathogen.

Integrating cross-immunity necessitates a more complex model where the dynamics of the vector are tracked explicitly. In this model, when a reversion transforms the vaccine into vector, the revertants are removed from the vaccine-infected class (V) and moved to the vector-infected class (M). Because the vector no longer carries or expresses pathogen genes, vector and pathogen share no cross-immunity and can co-infect.

However, it stems simply from the assumption that individuals infected with the transmissible vaccine are allowed to decay into susceptibles (at rate \u03bc) without first gaining immunity to the target pathogen. Thus, individuals that are directly Inspection of (4) demonstrates that the relative performance of a transmissible vaccine depends on its rate of reversion to insert-free vector ( Figure 2 ). Specifically, if the reversion rate is small relative to host death rate, d, and recovery rate from vaccine/vector infection, V , reversion has only a very slight impact on vaccine performance ( Figure 2 ). In contrast, if the reversion rate is large relative to death and recovery rates, (4) demonstrates that reversion can have a substantial adverse effect on the performance of the transmissible vaccine ( Figure 2 ). This implies that, all else being equal, genetically unstable transmissible vaccines that generate short-lived infections (i.e., large recovery rate, V ) will be more effective than those that generate long-term infections from which the host recovers only very slowly (i.e., small recovery rate, V ). The reason the rate of recovery matters, of course, is that long-lived infections offer substantially greater scope for reversion to vector and thus may undermine the effectiveness of genetically unstable transmissible vaccines.",

Consequently, although we successfully solved for the critical level of direct vaccination required to prevent pathogen invasion, the expression becomes unwieldy. Instead, we report the key results gleaned from numerical investigations. Plotting the relative performance of a transmissible vaccine as a function of its basic reproductive number, R 0,V , and reversion rate to vector, \u03bc, demonstrates that any cross-immunity between vector and vaccine substantially reduces the scope for a transmissible vaccine to outperform a traditional vaccine ( Figure 3 , compare to Figure 2 ). This result generalizes previous work by showing that the rate of reversion to vector plays an important role. Specifically, in the presence of cross-immunity, even rates of reversion as low as 1.5 \u00d7 10 \u22122 day \u22121 (one reversion every 66.7 days, on average), can cause a highly transmissible vaccine to be outperformed by a conventional and directly administered vaccine ( Figure 3 ). Here too, we find that, all else being equal, transmissible vaccines with a rapid host recovery rate are more effective than those with a slow recovery rate. The benefit of rapid host recovery is, once again, the reduction in opportunities for within-host evolution to cause reversion of genetically unstable transmissible vaccines and the production of insert-free vector with which the vaccine must effectively compete.",

The most immediate reason for ensuring that transmissible vaccines self-extinguish is for regulatory reasons. In this respect, deletion of the insert would restore the vaccine to the status of viral vector, an entity that may be naturally circulating in the wild population. Fortunately, deletion is also the process most easily controlled by engineering. For example, deletions are well known to occur between direct repeats in DNA (Cunningham et al., 1997; Springman, Molineux, Duong, Bull, & Bull, 2012) , and modification or elimination of those repeats reduces the spontaneous rate of deletions (Sleight, Bartley, Lieviant, & Sauro, 2010) . Genome engineering may also afford the possibility of designing accelerating rates of genomic instability. Our model assumed a constant rate of decay to revertant; a rate that accelerated over time would have many advantages. Such methods are not obviously ready for implementation, but they are at least suggested by \"counting mechanisms\" that have been employed in bacteria (reviewed in Bull & Barrick, 2017) .",

In the left-hand column, the vaccine is constructed from a vector characterized by a recovery rate that is large relative to the reversion rate ( V = 0.05), whereas in the right-hand column, the vector has a recovery rate that is low relative to the reversion rate ( V = 0.002809). In all panels, the pathogen had an R 0,P = 2, with remaining background parameters given by: b = 10, d = 0.002809, and P = 0.05 . In this figure, the vaccine was administered to 30% of newborn animals over a period of 720 days. Although the vaccine would ultimately be eliminated from the population, as predicted by our analytical results, for very low rate of reversion, this process is very slow and requires more time than our simulations were run the model results will then inform the possibilities and avenues for success. Consider cytomegalovirus (CMV), a vector currently being used in the development of transmissible vaccines targeting Ebola and Lassa fever (Marzi et al., 2016; Murphy et al., 2016; Tsuda et al., 2011 Tsuda et al., , 2015 . CMV appears promising because of its high level of species specificity, and ability to readily reinfect previously infected hosts , a property shown to be critically important here, and in a previous study . In contrast, our results also illuminate a potential weakness of CMV, which tends to generate long-lived infections that our results suggest increase opportunities for vaccine reversion. Ultimately, a rigorous assessment of vector quality will require robust estimates for key parameters such as transmission rates and rates of reversion to vector, something that should be a central focus of ongoing efforts to engineer successful transmissible vaccines.",

One important assumption is that reversion from vaccine to vector has no impact on rates of transmission, despite the clear reasons to expect greater rates of vector transmission after the genetic cargo has been unloaded. Although we did not explicitly model this scenario, we expect doing so would support our current results. For instance, if the vector transmits more rapidly than the vaccine, we expect cross-immunity to become even more important and the efficacy of a transmissible vaccine to be further reduced. As a consequence, the difference between vectors that generate cross-immunity and those that do not would become even more significant. Another important assumption of our model is that it is possible to directly vaccinate newborn animals and that these newborn animals have the same rate of transmission as adult animals. If recovery from vaccine infection is rapid and newborn animals have limited encounters with the population at large, this could substantially limit the efficacy of a transmissible vaccine. Evaluating how this important assumption influences our results will require more complex models that explicitly integrate age structure. Finally, our modeling framework focuses on a single well-mixed population and thus ignores potential impacts of spatial heterogeneity and population structure (Varrelman, Basinski, Remien, & Nuismer, 2019) .",

Because there are no equilibria of System A4 that describe a host population with positive levels of vaccine-infected hosts, we can conclude that levels of vaccine infection are not maintained by a stable equilibrium, nor are maintained by periodic orbits about a steady state. Barring the existence of chaotic dynamics that sustain the level of vaccine-infected hosts, we conclude that the vaccine is unable to persist in the population.
