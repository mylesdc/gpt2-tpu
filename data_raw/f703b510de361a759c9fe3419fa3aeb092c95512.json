In the 19 th century, Robert Virchow coined the term \"zoonosis\" to describe pathogens that are naturally transmitted between vertebrate animals and humans. 11 Virchow's contemporary, Sir William Osler, was the first to use the term \"one medicine.\" 9 Later, during the 20 th century, Calvin Schwabe revived the concept of \"one medicine.\" 10 A few years ago, the term \"One Health\" emerged from the joint efforts of American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) and American Medical Association (AMA). By definition, One Health is based on a systems approach, which includes disciplines of human medicine, veterinary medicine, and other related scientific health disciplines, working locally, nationally, and globally, to attain optimal health for people, animals, and our environment. 12 Currently, One Health aims to develop the capacity and infrastructure to prevent and respond to the rapidly expanding zoonoses through research that is not only focused on the disease but also on the promotion of health at the individual, population, and ecosystem levels. 13 Table 1 : Evolution of the term One Health",

The Office International des Epizooties (OIE) -World Organization for Animal Health endorsed the One Health approach in 2008, as a collaborative and all-encompassing way to address animal and public health globally. 15 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) established a One Health office in 2009, and in 2010, the European Union reaffirmed its commitment to operate under One Health umbrella. 16 One Health also gained international prominence through the coordinated efforts of multidisciplinary professionals, such as physicians, veterinarians, ecologists, etc.",

This search returned 1,682 articles, with the oldest article from January 1953. The articles found by the general search term \"One Health\" were not necessarily linked to zoonoses but had a multitude of meanings, such as One Health district, region authority, system, care, resource, sciences, etc. Literature published beginning in November 2006 was more associated to zoonoses. In order to examine the effect of the 2007 definition of One Health, we excluded articles prior to 2007 with no link to zoonosis. After Similarly, an advanced search for the term \"zoonoses\" AND \"One Health\" identified 188 articles from January 2007 to December 2014. Through an advanced search, \"zoonosis AND one health\" and \"zoonoses AND one health\" terms were searched for the period between January 2007 and December 2014. The articles found were then categorized based on the type of journals in which the articles were published. For the second phase, \"One Health\" was searched as a Medical subject heading (MeSH) 17 term, which is the National Library of Medicine controlled vocabulary thesaurus used for indexing articles. In the third phase, One Health advocate organizations were found using Google search engine. During the final phase, \"One Health\" was searched in Google scholar and examined by Google trends, which analyzes the number of searches for terms in Google. 18 Google ngram was then used to to analyze the use of the terms in Google books. 19",

We were able to identify and list the major One Health advocates through a Google search, where OIE emerges as the most prominent advocate. However, a PubMed search for One Health has shown the zoonoses linkage to the term from the year 2007 only, and this correlates with the joint declaration made on One Health by AVMA and AMA in 2007. Prior to 2007, One Health had many connotations to health in the medical literature. Our results have shown that there is a sustained use of the term One Health from 2007 onwards, with an accelerated use in 2013 and 2014. However, an incomplete adherence to the usage of One Health linking zoonoses in the medical literature is evident, and this practice of poor adherence will potentially impede the implementation of the goals of One Health initiatives. The systems approach of One Health is practical, cost effective, and involves the sustainable, multidisciplinary support of academia and various organizations to undertake more rigorous scientific research for countering the accelerated rise of zoonoses. Such research inquiry on zoonoses compels the correct use of terminologies that are acceptable and comprehensible, without any misuse and misunderstanding in the medical literature. The term One Health suits the current demand of multidisciplinary scientists involved in the development of this term, which evolved with consensus and feedback from multiple disciplines over time. Therefore, we suggest creating a MeSH term for One Health in the PubMed database that could be under the MeSH tree structures of Health [N01. 400] similar to family health, public health, rural health, occupational health, and veteran's health to support more specific research on zoonoses. Furthermore, exploring the possibility of a comprehensive, definitive definition for the term One Health is a necessity to promote One Health, global health, and evidence based public health.",
