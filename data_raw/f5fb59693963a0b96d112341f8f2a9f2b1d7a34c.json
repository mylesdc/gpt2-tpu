            "text": "Mitochondrial function is essential to meet metabolic demand of pancreatic beta cells respond to high nutrient stress. Mitophagy is an essential component to normal pancreatic \u03b2-cell function and has been associated with \u03b2-cell failure in Type 2 diabetes (T2D). Our previous studies have indicated that mitochondrial Rho (Miro) GTPase-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction under high nutrient stress leads to NODlike receptor 3 (NLRP3)-dependent proinflammatory responses and subsequent insulin resistance. However, the in vivo mechanism by which Miro1 underlies mitophagy has not been identified. Here we show firstly that the expression of Miro is reduced in human T2D and mouse db/db islets and in INS-1 cell line exposed to high glucose and palmitate. \u03b2-cell specific ablation of Miro1 (Miro1f/f: Rip-cre mice, or (IKO) under high nutrient stress promotes the development of hyperglycemia. \u03b2-cells from IKO mice display an inhibition of mitophagy under oxidative stress and induces mitochondrial dysfunction. Dysfunctional mitophagy in IKO mice is represented by damaged islet beta cell mitochondrial and secretory capacity, unbalanced downstream MKK-JNK signalling without affecting the levels of MEK, ERK or p38 activation and subsequently, impaired insulin secretion signaling via inhibition IRS-AKT-Foxo1 pathway, leading to worsening glucose tolerance in these mice. Thus, these data suggest that Miro1 may be responsible for mitophagy deficiency and \u03b2-cell dysfunction in T2D and that strategies target Miro1 in vivo may provide a therapeutic target to enhance \u03b2-cell mitochondrial quality and insulin secretion to ameliorate complications associated with T2D.",

            "text": "Excessive caloric or fat intake leading to obesity has been associated with beta cell dysfunction, and subsequently insulin resistance and T2D (type 2 diabetes) in human . High fat diet (HFD) feeding in mice has been reported to cause deficient islet beta cell mitophagy [1, 2] . Mitochondrial function regulated by mitophagy is essential to preserve pancreatic beta cell function and insulin secretion. Impaired beta cell function, together with deficient mitophagy, are both associated with chronic inflammation and insulin resistance [3] . Thus, insulin resistance, inflammation and pancreatic cell dysfunction are common pathological events in obese individuals [4] . Although in-depth research has been done in this area, the occurrence of complex and associated cell events and related behaviors in vivo connecting mitochondrial function and perturbed insulin secretion in T2D are not well understood. Mitochondrial activity is necessary for the process of cell proliferation and metabolism, and mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with a variety of human diseases, including cancer [5] , diabetes [3] and age-related diseases [6] . Increasing evidence suggests that mitophagy maintains mitochondrial integrity and quality control not only by selectively removing dysfunctional or damaged mitochondria [7] [8] [9] , but also by promoting biosynthesis of new mitochondria [10] . Recently, it has been found that before the onset of mitophagy, Cells block mitochondrial motility by causing mitochondrial Rho GTPase (Miro) degradation and ubiquitination of mitochondrial proteins to promote their identification and recruitment to autophagosomes [11] [12] [13] [14] . Miro1 is a Rho GTPase with a Ca 2+ binding site [15] . Oxidative stress-induced increases in cellular Ca 2+ concentrations, a primary target for insulin release; target Miro1 for stop mitochondrial motility. A deficiency in Miro1-mediated mitophagy triggers triggers mtROS(mitochondrial ROS)induced NLRP3 dependent pro-inflammatory responses and is linked to T2D diseases in vitro [12, 15] [9, 16, 17] .",

Islet beta cells from IKO mice under HFD have impairment of insulin secretion. In addition, the ablation of Miro1 in diabetic mice inhibited mitophagy, caused mitochondrial dysfunction, and unbalanced activation of downstream MKK-JNK pathway without affecting the levels of MEK, ERK or p38 resulted in insulin resistance via IRS-AKT-Foxo1 inhibition. Thus, ablation of Miro1 in IKO mice interferes with autophagy of islet beta cells and causes mitochondrial dysfuncion and subsequent insulin secretion impairment. This study provides a mechanism for unraveling the role of Miro1 in the pathogenesis of T2D under HFD stress.",

Miro1 expression was decreased in the mitochondria in db/db mice and T2D patients ( Figure  1A) . A similar result was observed in INS(rat insulinoma cell)-823/13 cells under diabetic conditions treated with 0.5mM PA(palmitic acid) + 20mM Glucose ( Figure  1C ). Previous studies showed that treatment with high glucose and palmitate induced Miro1 degradation via a Ca2+-dependent pathway (7) . Similar to these results, a decline in Miro1 staining was observed in STZ mice (Supplementary S3) ( Figure 1B ). In addition, TAG content in islets was increased by more than 30.5% upon HFD feeding ( Figure 1D ). These observations suggest that Miro1 may play a role in the pathogenesis of \u03b2-cell dysfunction.",

In response to HFD treatment, IKO mice significantly increased body weight during 4 to 24 weeks compared to mouse-specific Miro1flox / flox (Floxed) mice ( Figure 2B ). However, there was no significant difference in the level of energy intake between floxed and IKO mice (Supplementary Figure 2) , thus eliminating the lack of Miro1-deficient as a cause of lower body weight in mice. With regard to the effect of islets Miro1 on insulin resistance, We observed fasting blood glucose (FBG) ( Figure 2C ), fasting serum insulin (FINS) levels ( Figure 2D -2E) and homeostasis model assessment of the insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR) ( Figure 2F ). After HFD treatment, these levels were significantly higher in IKO mice than those in the floxed group. In addition, compared with the NC group, in intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test and intraperitoneal insulin tolerance test assays, the area under the curve was increased in IKO mice, and these effects in floxed significantly improved ( Figure 2G-2H) .

Conform to this concept, we investigated the effect of Miro1 knockdown on mitophagy in vivo. We used transmission electronmicroscopy (TEM) to confirm the double-membrane structure of autophagosomes containing undigested organelles, to observe whether HFD caused mitochondrial and autophagosome damage. As shown in Figure 3A , oval mitochondria in the control group had a complete crista structure. However, after 24 hours of incubation with HFD, mitochondria swelled and had few cristae in islet beta cells. Double membrane vesicles enclosing the mitochondria were also examined. Further, we measured the contribution of Miro1 to mitophagy in islet cells under diabetic conditions composed of 20 mM glucose and 0.5 mM PA incubation. We treated the islet cells with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) to examine the rate of protein degradation. As a result, mitochondrial protein degradation rates were lower in IKO islet cells with 20 mM glucose +0.5mM PA compared to floxed islet cells. Effect of CHX treatment on protein levels of other cellular compartments such as Golgi (Golgi-58), lysosome (Lamp2), endoplasmic reticulum (calregulin), or cytosol (Gapdh, Actin) were not associated with the Miro1 effects (*, P < 0.05). Then, to get further evidence, we detect mitophagy by transfecting multi-functional pLVX-GFP-LC3B-IRES-mito-mCherry vector into islet beta cell. Green fluorescence shows autophagosomes, red fluorescence indicating mitochondria. Yellow fluorescence indicates co-localization of autophagosomes and mitochondria. Obviously, this colocalization was reduced in Miro1 Miro1 expression was normalized to that of GAPDH (n = 4 for normal and 7 for T2D samples, *P < 0.05 versus control). B.

As shown in confocal fluorescence microscopy, IKO cells had very higher MitoTracker red staining when compared to floxed cells. Thus, the density of dysfunctional mitochondria, as expressed as MitoTracker red/green ratio, was increased by 43.5% in IKO islet cells ( Figure 4A , right). Previous study in our group has identified that the pancreatic islets ROS is mainly produced by mitochondria and NADPH oxidase [15] , and the process of producing ROS is a feed-forward vicious cycle. Then, siRNA targeting NLRP3 suppressed IL-1b mRNA expression significantly more than a specific inhibitor of NF-\u03baB (Bay11-7082) targeted NF-KB pathway in HFG(high fat and glucose)-treated IKO islet cells ( Figure 4B ). These results suggested that NLRP3 not the activation of NF-KB pathway were involved in inflammation activation under HFG diabetic condition. Because T2D is closely related to chronic inflammatory response [7] , we measured the expression levels of inflammatory mediators in the serum samples. The serum levels of IL-1b, IL-6, TNF-a and chemokines monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) were significantly higher in IKO mice, but lower in floxed mice after HFD treatment ( Figure 4C ). Collectively, these findings show that islets from Miro1 KO exacerbate HFD-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and the related inflammatory responses.",

Thus western blotting results showed that ERK, p38 and JNK signalling were activated simultaneously in the islets in response to HFD treatment (Figure 6 ), whereas the absence of Miro1 only significantly enhanced the activation of the HFDinduced MKK7-JNK-C-JUN pathway induced by in vivo ( Figure 7A ). Previous studies showed that the impairment of insulin sensitivity is primarily mediated by insulin signalling, particularly IRS-AKT-Foxo1. Therefore, we studied the phosphorylation of IRS1, AKT and Foxo1 in these mice that were refed for 4 h after overnight fasting, and observed that IKO mice reduced insulin signal transduction induced by refeeding, as demonstrated by increased phosphorylation of IRS1 at residue Ser307 and decreased phosphorylated levels of IRS1 (Tyr608), AKT, and Foxo1 ( Figure 7B ) in IKO mouse islets compared to floxed . In general, observation of IKO mice showed that insulin signaling was inhibited due to the specific lack of islets of Miro1. Examination of insulin levels during the first 30 min after glucose administration during the GTT indicated that, unlike IKO groups with a significant increase in insulin levels from 1.3-to 1.5-fold, NC mice were able to raise insulin levels in response to a glucose challenge ( Figure 2G-2H) . We also measured C-peptide levels, which, due to its longer half-life, can be a more sensitive index for insulin secretion. Indeed, C-peptide levels were elevated by approximately 3-fold 30 min after glucose administration in NC mice, whereas the levels did not change in beta cell IKO mice under HFD ( Figure 7C ). These results point to the idea that insulin secretory function of beta cells may be defective in IKO mice respond to HFD treatment ( Figure 7B ). Unaltered glucose tolerance in our RIP-Cre mice probably was due to the pure C57BL/6J background that we employed in our studies. Schematic illustration of molecular events and related behaviors underlying Miro1ablation in islet beta cell is shown in Figure 7C : respond to a continuous HFD stress, Miro1 expression is reduced in beta cells and directly inhibit mitophagy and mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to the activation of downstream MKK7-JNK-C-JUN and inflammatory response. By enhancing the phosphorylation of IRS on Ser307 and destroying its downstream Foxo1 phosphorylation aggravates insulin resistance, which contribute to inflammation and insulin resistance ( Figure 6 ).",

Metabolic stress-induced mitochondrial damage and ROS overproduction has been shown to lead to beta cell dysfunction and further develop into T2D [15, 21] . The presence of ROS in HFD stress indicates that mitochondria are the major source of ROS in islet cells after HFD treatment because the effect of DPI (NADPH oxidase inhibitors) on the elimination of HFDinduced ROS production is negligible [22] . It has been demonstrated that mtROS activates NLRP3 inflammasome together with fatty acids in vitro, leading to the release of active IL-1\u03b2 and the production of IL-1-dependent cytokines and chemokines. In our previous study, it was confirmed that Bay11-7082 did not participate in the initiation of NLRP3 inflammatory body, so the NLRP3dependent proinflammatory response driven by sustained mtROS production was not caused by NF-Kb activation [15] . Consistent with previous reports, in the present study, HFD stress reduced the expression of Islet Miro1, thereby promoting the damage of mitochondrial-induced mtROS production and loss of membrane potential, further leading to cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2) and chemokine (MCP-1) in islet \u03b2 cells of IKO mice [23] . In addition, our findings confirmed that Miro1 ablation damages beta cell function examined by Cpt2, Acadvl, and Hadhb led to inflammasome activation interfering with mitochondrial secretory function by detecting PDX-1, NeuroD, insulin, Glut2, and urocortin3, suggesting a therapeutic promising of Miro1 for mtROS-related T2D.",

Mitophagy deficiency is known to lead to both mitochondrial dysfunction and defects in mitochondrial dynamics related to Miro1 [25, 26] [15] . We examined the removal of damaged mitochondria by mitophagy over time by measuring the protein levels of mitochondrial markers on the inner, outer membrane, matrix, and intermembrane space. Knockdown of Miro1 in IKO mice significantly reduced the mitochondrial removal process, and all of the above mitochondrial markers disappeared in control islet cells faster than IKO islet cells. This indicates that mitophagy activity is weaker after Miro1 knockout. To further confirm this result, we monitored the autophagolysosome formation under an electric microscope. We found that knockout of Miro1 resulted in the accumulation of mitochondria that were damaged in the perinuclear region compared to control of islet cells, this is consistent with previous report that Miro1 is an essential for mitochondrial autophagy [27, 28] . Recent study shows that Miro1 involved as part of a mitophagy pathway by arresting of mitochondrial motility, helps to quarantine a depolarized mitochondrion or mitochondrial fragment prior to phagocytosis [29, 30] , so that the damage caused by the released mtROS will be limited to a smaller area. Removal of Miro1 from beta-cell mitochondria will detaches kinesin from its surface [30] . This confirms our observations of defective insulin release, activated inflammation, and oxidative stress related to islet cell mitophagy function in IKO mice. This may be at the stage of the pathway at which decreased level of Miro1 occurs under more than 4-week sustained HFD stress and mitophagy impairs after initial compensation. Our findings underscore the significance of Miro1-associated mitophagy for providing adequate energy for a change in energy demand and clearing damaged mitochondria under late-event (4-24 week) of HFD stress.",

The diabetic model was established in mice through feeding a HFD (protein, 18.1%; fat, 61.6%; carbohydrates, 20.3%; D12492, Research Diets, NJ, USA) continuously for 24 weeks. Mice administered an NC diet (protein, 18.3%; fat, 10.2%; carbohydrates, 71.5%; D12450B, Research Diets) served as controls. Food and water were provided ad labium. The body weight (BW) and fasting blood glucose (FBG) level of mice was examined every 4 weeks. Immediately after death, the pancreases were surgically removed, and the islets isolated by collagenase dispersion. Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer was used for isolation and pooling of the islets (19) .",
