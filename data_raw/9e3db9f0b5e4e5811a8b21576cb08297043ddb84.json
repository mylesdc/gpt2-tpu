Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) leads to severe economic losses for swine industry since being first identified in early 1990s. PRRSV interplays with host IFN production and IFN-activated signaling, which may contribute to the delayed onset and low level of neutralizing antibodies, as well as weak cell-mediated immune response in infected pigs. PRRSV encodes several proteins that act as antagonists for the IFN signaling. In this review, we summarized the various strategies used by PRRSV to antagonize IFN production and thwart IFN-activated antiviral signaling, as well as the variable interference with IFN-mediated immune response by different PRRSV strains. Thorough understanding of the interaction between PRRSV and host innate immune response will facilitate elucidation of PRRSV pathogenesis and development of a better strategy to control PRRS.",

There are three types of interferons. In human, type I interferons include IFN-, IFN-, IFN-, IFN-, and IFN- [9, 10] . In addition, IFN-, IFN-, and IFN-(or Limitin) have been identified as type I IFNs in swine, ruminant, and mice, respectively [11] . Almost all cell types are capable of producing IFN-/ ; however, plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) are considered to be the major source of IFN-production during viral infection [12, 13] . Type II IFN contains only IFN-, whose production is restricted to activated T cells, natural killer cells, and macrophages [14] . Type III IFNs comprise IFN-1, IFN-2, and IFN-3 (also known as interleukin-(IL-) 29, IL-28A, and IL-28B, resp.), which are mainly generated by dendritic cells [11] .

            "text": "Host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) for RNA viruses include Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and RIG-(retinoic acid inducible gene-) I-like receptors (RLRs). TLRs that can detect viral RNA are TLR3, TLR7, and TLR8 [18] . The RLR family of PRRs comprises RIG-I and melanoma differentiationassociated gene 5 (MDA-5) [19] . Both RIG-I and MDA-5 signal through adaptor IPS-1 (also known as MAVS, Cardif, and VISA) on the outer membrane of the mitochondria [20] . TLR3 and RLR can recognize double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) of viral genome or replication intermediate of RNA viruses. Activation of TLR and RLR signaling pathways leads to activation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), IRF7, and NF-B. These transcription activation factors translocate into the nucleus and result in induction of type I IFNs and expression of inflammatory cytokines, which not only lead to an antiviral state of the neighboring uninfected cells, but also serve as key regulators to evoke adaptive immune response. At least 39 functional type I IFN genes have been identified in porcine chromosomes 1 and 10 [21] . These IFN genes include 17 IFN-subtypes, 1 IFN-, 11 IFN-, 7 IFN-, 1 IFN-, 1 IFN-, and 1 IFN-. PRRSV is sensitive to type I IFNs and the sensitivity is confirmed in vitro and in vivo. Pretreatment of PAMs with porcine IFN-resulted in significant reduction of PRRSV yield [22] . Pretreatment of MARC-145 cells and porcine pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAMs) with porcine IFNinhibited PRRSV replication [23] . Pigs that were inoculated with recombinant adenovirus for IFN-expression and challenged one day later with PRRSV had lower febrile responses, reduced lung lesion, and delayed viremia and antibody response compared to controls [24] . Therefore, for invading host immune clearance, PRRSV has evolved multiple strategies to antagonize the host IFN induction.",

The PRRSV suppression of IFN induction correlates with the virus replication. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are thought to be the major source of IFNin vivo. PRRSV fails to induce porcine pDCs to produce IFN-, while pseudorabies virus (PrV), swine influenza virus (SIV), and TGEV stimulated the pDCs to synthesize IFN- [26, 27] . Moreover, presence of PRRSV markedly reduced the typical IFN-response of pDCs to TGEV or Toll-like receptor 9 agonist. Loving et al. showed that PRRSV replicated in monocyte-derived DCs but not lung DCs and the response of both cell types to PRRSV was only limited to IFN-transcription [28] . Additionally, for MARC-145 cells PRRSV replication also significantly inhibited the dsRNA-induced type I IFN expression [29] [30] [31] . These data suggest that PRRSV infection directly interferes with type I IFN induction in vivo and in vitro.",

The result showed that nsp1 and its two cleavage products, nsp1 and nsp1 , inhibited the activation of IFN-promoter (p125-Luc) and an artificial promoter containing three IRF3 binding sites (p55-CIB-Luc) after SV40 stimulation.

The amino acid residue H129 of nsp11, a presumed catalytic histidine, was involved in the inhibition of IRF3 phosphorylation.

IFN-2 and elevation of ISGs were detected in A2MC2-infected cells. Sequencing analysis indicated that A2MC2 was closely related to VR-2332 and Ingelvac PRRS MLV with an identity of 99.8% at the nucleotide level [47] . There were a total of 28 nucleotide (nt) variations when compared to VR-2332, resulting in 14 amino acid changes scattered from nt 4681 to the end of the genome. Compared to both VR-2332 and MLV, A2MC2 has 15 unique nucleotides. Yet the mechanism of this strain inducing IFNs is not known and it is intriguing to note that the first 4.6 kb of its genome is identical to VR-2332. Its nsp1 and nsp1 proteins should be able to inhibit IFN induction. We hypothesize that the unique nucleotides in A2MC2 genome resulting in special RNA structures or unique dsRNA formation during early viral replication could evoke IFN production. It is worth to note that the induction of IFNs is dose dependent. The virus is able to replicate when the inoculum is at less than 0.1 MOI, which induces limited IFNs that cannot suppress the virus replication [47] . A2MC2 infection of pigs resulted in earlier onset and higher level neutralizing antibody against homologous and heterologous strain than MLV vaccine strain that is highly homologous in sequence [48] .

            "text": "Type I IFNs are critical to innate immunity against viral infections and play an important role in the stimulation of adaptive immune response [49, 50] . The activation of IFN signaling leads to the induction of antiviral responses. The signaling of type I IFNs is initiated after they bind to their receptors on the cell surface [51] [52] [53] . This receptor binding activates Janus kinases (JAK), which phosphorylates both the signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 (STAT1) and STAT2. The phosphorylated STAT1 and STAT2 form heterodimers, followed by interaction with interferon regulatory factor 9 (IRF9) and subsequently formation of heterotrimers, also known as interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3). Translocation of ISGF3 into the nucleus followed by binding to consensus DNA sequences leads to the expression of IFNstimulated genes (ISGs), which then take part in antiviral responses. [54] [55] [56] . PRRSV replication in MARC-145 cells suppresses JAK/STAT signaling stimulated by addition of IFN-to the culture [54] . Transcripts of ISG15, ISG56, and protein STAT2 were significantly reduced compared to mockinfected cells. The phosphorylation of both STAT1 and STAT2 was unaffected. Immunoprecipitation with STAT1 or STAT2 antibody for MARC-145 cell lysates was performed and the result showed no significant difference for STAT1/STAT2 heterodimer formation between PRRSV-infected and mockinfected cells. Further study showed that the nuclear translocation of STAT1/STAT2 heterodimer was blocked. PRRSV infection of PAM cells also blocks JAK/STAT signaling shown by reduction of ISG expression after stimulation with external IFN-, while a vaccine strain Ingelvac PRRS MLV had little effect, possible due to its less efficient replication in the primary cells [54] .",

PRRSV nsp1 was found to block the nuclear translocation of STAT1 and significantly inhibit the expression of ISGs [54] . By observing STAT1-GFP distribution under fluorescence microscopy, Chen et al. [32] noticed that STAT1-GFP accumulated in cytoplasm in HEK293T cells with nsp1 expression. Further studies on nsp1 revealed that it induced the degradation of karyopherin-alpha1 (KPNA1, also called importin-alpha5), which is known to mediate the nuclear import of ISGF3 [56] . The N-terminal domain of nsp1 was involved in the ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation of KPNA1. Residue 19 of nsp1 was found to be essential in inducing KPNA1 degradation and inhibiting IFN-mediated signaling as the residue change from valine to isoleucine diminished the suppressive effect. Notably, PRRSV infection of MARC-145 cells by VR-2332 and VR-2385 also reduces KPNA1 expression, whereas infection by Ingelvac PRRS MLV does not. MLV nsp1 has no effect on KPNA1 expression or IFN signaling but gains the suppressive function when residue 19 is changed to valine [56] .",

Among the antiviral ISGs, the best studied ones are 2 ,5 -oligoadenylate synthetases (OASs), ribonuclease L RNaseL, the dsRNA-activated protein kinase (PKR), p56 (ISG56, interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1 (IFIT1)), Mx1 (Myxovirus (influenza virus) resistance 1), and ISG15. PRRSV nsp2 was shown to inhibit the antiviral function of IFN-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) by the deubiquitinase activity of the OTU domain of nsp2 ( Figure 2 and Table 1 ) [58] . ISG15 is an ubiquitin-like antiviral protein [59, 60] . ISG15 conjugation (ISGylation) to substrate proteins follows a process similar to that of ubiquitin conjugation. ISGylation of many important immune-related molecules leads to the activation of host innate immune response. As mentioned above, the cysteine protease domain (PL2) at the N-terminus of nsp2 belongs to OTU-containing superfamily of proteases (DUBs), which possesses deubiquitinating activity [58] . Sun et al. revealed that nsp2 was an antagonist for the antiviral activity of ISG15 by reducing ISG15 production and conjugation. The N-terminal PL2 domain of nsp2 was crucial for the antagonizing function.",

Partly the reason is possibly because of PRRSV interference with IFN-mediated innate immunity. PRRSV infection appears to inhibit synthesis of type I IFNs in vivo and in vitro with the exception of some atypical strains that induce IFN production, such as A2MC2. The mechanism for the interference is at multiple steps from inhibition of IRF3 activation, CBP interaction with IRF3, and posttranscriptional suppression. PRRSV also block IFN-activated signaling, which results in suppression of the expression of antiviral ISGs. The mechanism is PRRSVmediated blocking of ISGF3 nuclear translocation.",

In addition, type I IFNs are proinflammatory cytokines. The protective effect of IFNs in vivo may be context dependent. The IFNs in proper amount at right site and time should be protective. Otherwise, its elevation might be a consequence of inflammation during PRRSV infection.
