            "text": "Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) represents one of the poultry industry major threats, particularly in high density producing countries. The emergence and spread of new IBV genotypes have frustrated the various disease control efforts implemented over time. Despite that, few comprehensive and large scale studies have been performed to understand the international and local spreading dynamics of this virus. In the present work, these phenomena were evaluated by implementing a Bayesian phylodynamic approach to reconstruct the epidemiological patterns and population history of the QX genotype (currently renamed GI-19 lineage), the most relevant IBV lineage of the Old-World. Our analysis, based on 807 partial S1 sequences of strains collected from 18 countries between 1993 and 2015, demonstrates that this genotype originated in China well before its first identification. After a prolonged local circulation, it started spreading to other European, Asian and Middle East countries in successive waves, which were mirrored by concomitant fluctuations in viral population size. Interestingly, the within-Europe spread was characterized by a higher estimated migration rate compared with the inter-continental one, potentially reflecting the closer geographic and economic relationships among these countries. Nevertheless, the colonization of new states by the GI-19 lineage appeared to occur mostly by single introduction events in both intra and inter-continental spread, likely because of epidemiological factor and health policy combination which seems to prevent the frequent introduction and mixing of different strains. On the other hand, the within Italy QX circulation reconstruction showed a much more intricate connection network among different locations, evidencing the difficulty in controlling IBV spread especially in highly densely poultry populated areas.

In fact, IBV causes mainly a highly contagious upper respiratory tract disease, with a morbidity of typically 100% and mortality reaching 50% when some strains that cause nephritis or opportunistic infections occur [1] . Additionally, the genital tract of layer and breeder birds can also be affected, causing reproductive disorders and altered egg production [2] .",

            "text": "The infection is caused by a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus belonging to the order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae genus Coronavirus. The viral genome is about 27 Kb long and encodes for different proteins, such as the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), numerous accessory and regulatory proteins and the structural proteins spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid [1, 3] . Particularly, the spike protein (S) (or part of it) is widely studied and sequenced because of its importance in the viral life cycle, in the development of the host immune response and as an epidemiological marker. This protein is post-translationally cleaved in the S1 and S2 subunits. The former contains domains for cell receptor attachment while the latter has a transmembrane domain anchoring the spike to the virion. Besides being involved in viral adhesion, membrane fusion and viral entry, the S protein contains epitopes inducing neutralizing antibodies [3] and therefore its variability is essential in conditioning the cross-protection among strains [4] . As other RNA viruses, IBV is characterized by a high substitution [5, 6] and recombination rate [7, 8] , which are responsible for the continuous emergence of new genetic and antigenic variants characterized by heterogeneous biological and epidemiological properties. While in the past IBV characterization depended on virus isolation and serological assays (i.e. virus neutralization), the advent of molecular biology techniques has radically changed the routine typing approach. Despite the not direct genotypeserotype relationship, the currently adopted IBV classification and nomenclature are based on the genotypic features and strains are therefore grouped in so called \"genotypes\". Unfortunately, there was no agreement on the exact method by which sequences should have been compared and on the criteria for differentiating and naming the genotypes.",

The presence of recombinant strains was evaluated using RDP4 [36] on a dataset including the selected GI-19 like strains plus the reference ones. The RDP4 settings for each method were adjusted accounting for the dataset features according to the RDP manual recommendations. In particular RDP, GENECONV, Chimaera and 3Seq were used in a primary scan while the full set of available methods was used for the analysis refinement. Only recombination events detected by more than 2 methods with a significance value lower than 10 \u22125 (p-value < 10 \u22125 ) and Bonferroni correction were accepted. After recombinant removal, the absence of residual breakpoints was confirmed with SBP [37] implemented in HyPhy [38] . Finally, TempEst [39] was used to assess that heterochronous sequences under investigation displayed sufficient 'temporal signal' for reliable analysis. After preliminary checking the molecular clock hypothesis, the sequences whose sampling date was inconsistent with their genetic divergence and phylogenetic position were removed. Indeed, significant deviations from the expectation can be due to several factors including low sequencing quality, excessive passaging leading to the accumulation of cell-line adaptations, recombination, mislabelling of the sequence, sequencing of a vaccine virus (which undergoes no evolution while in storage), etc. [39] .",

The rise and spread of the GI-19 lineage (formerly known as QX genotype) represents an extremely pregnant example in this sense. While the efficacy of available vaccines has been proven against the QX genotype [21, 29] , the incapability of preventing its diffusion demonstrates that control strategies must not rely only on vaccination.

Concordantly, a sequence published only in 2013 (originating from a sample collected in 1993) demonstrates that this lineage was already present at that time. Our phylodynamic study further backdates the QX emergence of more than ten years. How a usually virulent IBV variant passed undetected for such a long time will require further investigations; however, several non-competing hypothesis can be advocated. At first, only 34 IBV sequences are available from China before 1993 and all originate from samples collected after 1985 (data available at ViPR database [49] ), thus a limited surveillance and/or reporting system can have played a major role indeed. At that time, the availability of advanced diagnostic and sequencing technologies was lower if compared with the current ones. Moreover, the backyard poultry farming had and still has a relevant weight in Chinese farming [50] . It is plausible that the first QX strains originated and were allowed to circulate in a rural environment where surveillance systems were less efficient and financial resources more limited [50] . Finally, although the QX genotype emerged as a virulent genotype, there are no proofs that this feature was an ancient one. Other studies dealing with other pathogens have described episodes of virulence increase when mild viruses are allowed to circulated for a prolonged time period in an animal population [51] [52] [53] .",

The high evolutionary rate demonstrated in the present study can have favoured this phenomenon, allowing the virus to rapidly explore new phenotypic traits [54, 55] . As a side comment, differently from Valastro et al., (2016) [9] who reported the absence of any temporal structure in the whole IBV phylogenesis and the presence of a weak one in the GI-19 one, the present study evidences a higher conformity to the molecular clock theory. When the whole IBV population is considered, it is highly likely that many vaccine derived strains are confused with field ones [26] and included in the analysis, clearly obscuring the temporal structure of the data [39] . Accordingly with this hypothesis, McKinley et al., [6] had reported that live vaccine use can hamper the accurate measurement of virus mutation rate [6] . Explaining the different results obtained for the GI-19 lineage is far more challenging. Nevertheless, the twofold size of the dataset used in the current study compared to Valastro et al. (2016) [9] , and/or the different genomic region considered can account for the different clock-like structure intensity estimated by the two studies.",

While confined in China, the relative genetic diversity became substantially constant or even decreased after the initial noteworthy expansion (Fig 2) . This scenario was bound to change in the late '90, when the lineage was able to invade and spread in other countries. The acquisition of a new niche characterized by a high density and immunological relatively na\u00efve population favoured the emergence of at least four consecutive waves (Fig 2) that substantially corresponded to: QX first introduction in Europe (early 2000), spread in central Europe and Italy (~2005), expansion in Spain and Eastern Europe (~2008-2010) and final invasion of Middle-East and North Africa (2013-2015) . However, it must be stressed that the skyline reconstructions are approximations, with an unavoidable degree of uncertainness and relatively broad confidence intervals, such that the median value should be interpreted with cautions [40, 43] . Additionally, the viral population size history is representative of the whole GI-19 population at each time period and thus the variations attributable to changes occurring at local scale are probably smoothed or masked by the global scenario. Nevertheless, the coincidence between the areal expansion and the population size changes is at least suggestive and supported by epidemiology theory. Big, high turnover animal concentrations, as the European poultry one is, can create favourable conditions for viral replication and for the genesis of huge viral populations [5] . The dense connections among poultry industries clearly speeded up the GI-19 lineage spreading likelihood among European Union (EU) countries, as testified by the high migration rate that characterizes the within-Europe connections compared with the non-EU ones.",

Even if international live poultry trades are quite massive (https:// comtrade.un.org/) (S4 Fig), because of EU health legislation, European importations are negligible, reducing the likelihood of strain introduction from developing countries. Additionally, the traded animals are typically young chicks, while field strain infection typically occurs in older animals (about 30 days of age) [21] . Finally, the competition with the earliest established QX strains could have hampered the introduction and settling of new foreign variant of the same genotype. On the other hand, the rapid viral spread within Europe [19, [23] [24] [25] 58] was probably facilitated by the high and unconstrained goods circulation within EU, particularly among geographically neighbouring countries. Nevertheless, the low strain introduction frequency despite the unfavourable epidemiological conditions suggests the feasibility of a more effective fight against IBV, by enhancing the efforts in the direct control measures and through a more integrated cooperation among different areas.",

The GI-19 lineage was able to rapidly settle in this country after the first introduction, persisting and giving rise to several waves (even if less marked compared with those observed at international scale) until nowadays (Fig 5) . Over this timespan, it was able to spread and circulate freely backwards and forwards among closely and distantly related regions (S2 Video and S2 Fig) , being the highly densely populated areas of Emilia Romagna the main, but not the only, source of infection (Fig 6) . Unfortunately, other studies on IBV spreading routes have not been performed in Italy. The high poultry farm density surely favours the maintenance and circulation of viral infection, particularly in the Northern Italian regions where more than 70% of poultry production is located. However, the transmission of strains among nonneighbouring regions demonstrates that other spreading routes, like animal and supply transportation among different farms of the same poultry production chain, rather than local airborne diffusion are pivotal in the infection dissemination and should thus represent a priority for future actions.",

The severe imbalance in sequence number could bias the results of population parameter estimation and migration pattern reconstruction toward over-represented countries. Additionally, it has been proven by simulation studies that variation in population sizes reconstructed by Bayesian skyline family methods can be subject to spurious phenomena caused by nothing more than the choice of samples [40] . To mitigate both these effects, a down-sampling strategy was applied, balancing the number of strains collected from each area over time. Additionally, by repeating the analyses with different randomly selected sample sets, as suggested by Hall et al.,(2016) [40], the robustness of the obtained results was confirmed.",

Russia and other Eastern countries represent a paradigmatic example in this sense. Firstly reported in Russia in 2001 [13] , the QX genotype was proven to persistently circulate in this country [14] , which could have played a major role in its dissemination to Europe because of its \"intermediate position\" between China and the EU in a geographical, commercial and cultural sense.",

The countries where GI-19 has been detected lay along four main flyways: the Black Sea-Mediterranean, the East Africa-West Asia, the Central Asia and the East Asia-Australian routes, even if these paths are clearly a simplification and numerous exceptions from the common patterns have been described [63] . Migration connects many bird populations and virus infected birds can transmit their pathogens to other groups that may subsequently bring it to new areas. Additionally, during migration, birds aggregate in favourable stopover or wintering sites, creating high density populations where the infectious pressure is potentially higher [63] .",

After a prolonged undetected circulation in China, it was able to spread to the Old World main poultry producing countries, typically by single introduction events followed by establishment and rapid local expansions. Long distance migration events appear sporadic, likely because of epidemiological factor and health policy combination which seems to prevent the frequent introduction and mixing of different strains in the same country. On the other hand, the Italian experience demonstrates the inefficacy of current control strategies implemented at local scale, claiming the need of a further effort and cooperation among private companies and public institutions aimed to the infection control. The incompleteness of available molecular epidemiology data represents an insurmountable limit which left many questions currently unsolved. Particularly, further studies will be necessary to understand the role of Russia in linking Eastern and Western countries and the part played by wild birds in IBV dissemination. (PDF) S1 Video.
