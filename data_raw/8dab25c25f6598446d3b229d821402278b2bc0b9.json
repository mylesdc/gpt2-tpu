Based on the gene annotation of the transcriptome, 104 unigenes were identified covering most of the catalytic steps in the general biosynthetic pathways of indole, terpenoid, and phenylpropanoid. Subsequently, the organ-specific expression patterns of the genes involved in these pathways, and their responses to methyl jasmonate (MeJA) induction, were investigated. Metabolites profile of effective phenylpropanoid showed accumulation pattern of secondary metabolites were mostly correlated with the transcription of their biosynthetic genes. According to the analysis of UDP-dependent glycosyltransferases (UGT) family, several flavonoids were indicated to exist in I. indigotica and further identified by metabolic profile using UPLC/Q-TOF. Moreover, applying transcriptome co-expression analysis, nine new, putative UGTs were suggested as flavonol glycosyltransferases and lignan glycosyltransferases. Conclusions: This database provides a pool of candidate genes involved in biosynthesis of effective metabolites in I. indigotica. Furthermore, the comprehensive analysis and characterization of the significant pathways are expected to give a better insight regarding the diversity of chemical composition, synthetic characteristics, and the regulatory mechanism which operate in this medical herb.",

These compounds are mainly divided into three classes, namely, alkaloids, phenylpropanoids, and terpenoids as listed in the Additional file 1: Table S1 . Among these ingredients, the pharmaceutical activities of the indole alkaloids are mostly reported. Indirubin, isaindigotone, 5-hydroxyoxindole, indole-3-carboxaldehyde, and trytanthrin are validated to be the active substances for the doxorubicin resistance, leukocyte inhibition, and antiviral activities [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . Phenylpropanoids is another major group of active compounds, which is mainly comprised of lignans and flavonoids. Lignans, including pinoresinol, lariciresinol, and lignan glycoside derivatives as lariciresinol-4\u2032-bis-O\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside were identified as anti-inflammatory and antiviral constituents [13, 14] . In addition, compounds such as sitosterols, epigitrin, epiprogoitrin, and hypoxanthine, etc. also are involved in the major drug actions of I. indigotica. However, most of these compounds are presented in I. indigotica at alow natural abundance, such as lariciresinol (0.24\u2030 DW), lariciresinol-4\u2032-bis-O-\u03b2-Dglucopyranoside (0.4\u2030 DW), and hypoxanthine (0.49\u2030 DW) [13, 15] . Therefore, increasing the content of the active metabolites is of significance for enhancing the quality of I. indigotica, and also meets the growing market requirements.",

            "text": "Metabolic engineering approaches have emerged as a very powerful tool for increasing the production of valuable compounds in plants. With in-depth understanding of biosynthesis, the content of valuable compounds is dramatically increased by bio-engineering techniques in many medicinal plants as Catharanthus roseus [16] , Hyoscyamus niger [17] , and Salvia miltiorrhiza [18] . However, because of the limited information of biosynthesis pathways, there has been no successful progress on metabolic engineering in I. indigotica until now. Therefore, a deep understanding of the biosynthetic pathways of the various compounds produced by the plant becomes the first imperative. As a non-model plant species, little information was initially available to achieve this goal. In previous studies, the genes involved in lignan synthesis were isolated and characterized, including PAL (DQ115905), C4H (GU014562), 4CL (GU937875), CCR (GQ872418), CAD (GU937874), C3H (JF826963), CCoAOMT (DQ115904), and PLR (JF264893) by homologous cloning [19, 20] . Nevertheless, the slow process of homologous cloning has afforded only limited progress toward a complete understanding of these diverse, biosynthetic pathways in I. indigotica. Most of genes involved in secondary metabolites synthesis and the corresponding regulatory genes for these active compounds still remain unclear.",

Meanwhile, two unigenes also showed high similarity to chalcone synthase genes (CHS) with e-value of 0 and 1.00E-144. STS and CHS belong to the same family (type III polyketide synthases). Only a few residues are critical for their activity distinction [30, 31] . Therefore, further investigations on function of two unigenes and stilbene metabolites were needed for the identification of these genes. Moreover, isoflavone synthase gene (IFS), which leads to the isoflavonoids synthesis, was not identified.",

Homologous Arabidopisis genes, including 52 UGTs, ten flavonol synthesis genes, and nine lignan synthesis genes, were subjected as query. As shown in Figure 7 , a total of 45 co-expressed genes showed greater correlation coefficient than 0.5 with at least one other genes, and were mainly classified into four major clusters. Cluster 1 was mainly made up of general phenylpropanoid biosynthesis genes, including PALs, 4CLs, and C4H, and lignan biosynthesis genes, such as C3H, CCoAoMT, CAD, and CCR. Cluster 2 and Cluster 3 contained flavonoid and lignan correlated genes, respectively. DIR2 and DIR3, which located at downstream of lignan biosynthesis, were classified into cluster 2. In correspondence with DIR2 and DIR3, five UGTs in cluster 2 were regarded as lignan glucosyltransferase genes. In cluster 3, flavone biosynthesis genes CHS, F3\u2032H, and FLS were correlated with four UGTs. Besides UGT78D1 and UGT78D2, which were known to be O-glucosytranferase genes, UGT84A1 and UGT84A2 were predicted to be flavonol glucosyltransferase genes due to the catalytic activity of correlative genes.

RNA sequencing makes it possible to carry out some \"High-flux\" analysis in I. indigotica. Here, the transcriptome annotation presents the most abundant genetic resource concerning I. indigotica to date. It will serve as the foundation for other functional genomic research efforts and provide the basis for improving the production of active compound through genetic engineering.",
