Moreover, S1P-specific a 1 -antitrypsins significantly inhibited replication and spread of a replication-competent recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus expressing the Lassa virus glycoprotein GP as well as authentic Lassa virus.

Based on their antigenic relationships and geographic distribution, arenaviruses are divided into two major groups. The Old World group includes the prototype of this family, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), and LASV, which is endemic in West African countries and causes every year thousands of human infections with hemorrhagic fever as a severe clinical manifestation [1] . The New World group includes among others Machupo, Junin, Guanarito and Sabia viruses which can cause viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF). With the exception of the New World virus Tacaribe, which was isolated from Artibeus bats, arenaviruses are rodent-borne viruses [2] .",

Until now there is no specific and effective treatment available to combat hemorrhagic fevers caused by arenaviruses. Administration of convalescent plasma has been reported to reduce the mortality rates of patients with Argentine hemorrhagic fever, however, 10% of immune-plasma recipients developed a late neurological syndrome of unknown origin [6] . The only existing drug used to treat Lassa fever and certain South American hemorrhagic fevers is the broad-spectrum antiviral agent ribavirin, a ribonucleoside analogue, which has shown to be partially effective if given early in the course of illness [7, 8, 9, 10] . Even though the drug is relatively inexpensive for patients in highdeveloped countries, it is still unaffordable for many of those living in West Africa and South America. Moreover, several adverse effects have been associated with ribavirin therapy in patient studies and animal models [11, 12, 13, 14, 15] . The lack of effective disease control measures as well as the discovery of new fatal arenavirus species that pose a risk of epidemic potential [16, 17] , emphasize the need for novel therapeutic interventions.",

Post-translational maturation cleavage of GP-C by the proprotein convertase site 1 protease (S1P, [21] ), also known as subtilisin kexin isozyme-1 (SKI-1, [22] ), leads then to the generation of the distal receptor-binding subunit GP-1 and the transmembrane-spanning fusion competent subunit GP-2 [23] .

Using systematic mutational analysis of the LCMV GP cleavage site, the consensus motif R-(R/K/ H)-L-(A/L/S/T/F) was determined, which is conserved in the glycoprotein sequences of the Old World viruses LASV, Mopeia and Mobala, as well as the New World virus Pichinde, suggesting that all arenavirus glycoproteins are cleaved by S1P [26, 32] . Indeed, more recently Rojek et al. reported that glycoproteins from the New World hemorrhagic fever viruses Junin, Machupo and Guanarito are also processed by S1P, although Guanarito possesses a protease recognition motif that differs from known arenavirus GP consensus cleavage sequences, indicating a broader substrate specificity of S1P than previously anticipated [33] .",

The exploration for the potential use of modified antitrypsins with an altered inhibitory spectrum has been guided by the discovery of a natural variant of a 1 -AT, known as Pittsburgh (a 1 -AT-PIT), found in a patient who had a severe bleeding disorder caused by mutation of the P1 reactive center residue of antitrypsin from methionine to arginine [37] . This substitution changed its specificity from elastase to thrombin and other coagulation proteases. Due to the introduction of a second mutation from alanine to arginine at P4 of the RCL, the engineered a 1antitrypsin variant Portland (a 1 -AT-PDX) showed high affinity for furin [38] . a 1 -AT-PDX efficiently inhibited the formation of infectious HIV, measles virus, and human cytomegalovirus progeny by blocking furin-dependent processing of glycoproteins gp160, F0 and gB, respectively [38, 39, 40, 41] . Pullikotil and coworkers used this approach for the generation of highly selective a 1 -antitrypsin variants specific for S1P by introducing various S1P recognition motifs into the RCL of a 1 -antitrypsin [42] . The adaptation of a 1 -antitrypsin towards S1P efficiently inhibited the processing of the S1P substrates SREBP-2 (sterol regulatory element binding protein), ATF6 (activating transcription factor 6) as well as CCHFV glycoprotein [42] . However, the effect of these inhibitors on CCHFV infection was not analyzed in that study. To block cleavage of the LASV glycoprotein, we generated here recombinant a 1 -antitrypsin variants mimicking the S1P recognition motifs RRIL, RRVL and RRYL that exhibited the greatest inhibitory potential based on immunoblot quantification. In addition, we used an a 1 -AT construct that contains the LASV GP cleavage motif RRLL in its RCL. Using a doxycycline regulated expression system we demonstrate that S1P-adapted a 1antitrypsin variants efficiently block proteolytic maturation of the glycoprotein precursor GP-C, whereas a furin-specific a 1 -AT had no effect on GP-C processing. Virus replication of both a replication-competent recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus expressing the LASV glycoprotein GP-C (VSVDG/LASVGP) and authentic LASV was significantly inhibited in the presence of S1P-specific a 1 -antitrypsins. The degree of inhibition of viral replication correlated with the ability of the different a 1 -antitrypsin variants to inhibit the processing of LASV GP-C.",

Current treatment options to control fatal outcome of disease are limited to the ribonucleoside analogue ribavirin, although its use has some significant limitations. The lack of effective treatment alternatives emphasizes the need for novel antiviral therapeutics to counteract these life-threatening infections. Maturation cleavage of the viral envelope glycoprotein by the host cell proprotein convertase site 1 protease (S1P) is critical for infectious virion production of several pathogenic arenaviruses. This finding makes this protease an attractive target for the development of novel antiarenaviral therapeutics. We demonstrate here that highly selective S1P-adapted a 1 -antitrypsins have the potential to efficiently inhibit glycoprotein processing, which resulted in reduced Lassa virus replication. Our findings suggest that S1P should be considered as an antiviral target and that further optimization of modified a 1 -antitrypsins could lead to potent and specific S1P inhibitors with the potential for treatment of certain viral hemorrhagic fevers.",

The reason we chose CHO-K1 cells for our studies is the availability of a site 1 protease-deficient CHO cell line (designated SRD-12B cells), in which GP maturation is abolished and only GP-deficient non-infectious LASV particles are released [23] . Thus, this cell clone provides an ideal control for inhibition studies. Vero E6, CHO-K1, and SRD-12B cells were infected with either VSVDG/ LASVGP or wild-type VSV (VSVwt) as a control. Aliquots of cell culture supernatants were collected at different times after infection and were analyzed by plaque assay. Growth kinetics revealed that VSVDG/LASVGP grows to similar titers in CHO-K1 cells compared to Vero E6 cells which have been used in earlier studies (Fig. 1A) [48] . These data demonstrated that CHO-K1 cells support efficient VSVDG/LASVGP replication, and thus are useful tools for further investigations. As expected, VSVDG/ LASVGP lacks efficient replication in SRD-12B cells, whereas virus growth of VSVwt remained unaffected in these cells (Fig. 1A) . The reason for the low but detectable virus titers in the supernatant of VSVDG/LASVGP-infected SRD-12B cells is currently not known but has been also observed for LASV ( [23] and present study), LCMV [34] and New Word arenaviruses [33] . Glycoprotein activation by a yet unknown protease though with only very low efficiency might explain this phenomenon.",

To allow only one replication cycle, cell lysates were analyzed 10 h post-infection for detection of LASV GP cleavage by Western blot analysis using a GP-specific antiserum that recognizes both the precursor GP-C and the cleaved subunit GP-2. In CHO-K1 Tet-On cells LASV GP was efficiently cleaved, regardless of whether doxycycline was present or not. In contrast, virtually no detectable cleavage of GP was observed in SRD-12B cells that are deficient in S1P (Fig. 3A, lanes 1-4) . Without expression of the various antitrypsins efficient cleavage was detected in these stably transfected cell lines, similar to the processing of GP in wild-type CHO-K1 Tet-On cells (Fig. 3A , lanes 1, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13) .

Quantification of GP-2 cleavage revealed that the a 1 -AT variant RRIL exhibited the greatest inhibitory effect on GP processing (.80% inhibition) followed by a 1 -AT RRLL (.60% inhibition), which possesses the amino acid cleavage motif of the LASV GP-C. Also a 1 -AT variants RRVL and RRYL were found to be inhibitory, although to a lesser extent (inhibition less than 50%) than the variants RRIL and RRLL (Fig. 3B) .

In viral particles from supernatants of noninduced a 1 -AT RRIL cells and CHO-K1 Tet-On control cells cleaved GP-2 was readily observed, whereas in the particulate material isolated from the supernatant of a 1 -AT RRIL expressing cells no glycoprotein was detected (Fig. 4A) . However, Western Blot analysis for VSV proteins revealed the release of these viral proteins into the supernatant of a 1 -AT RRIL expressing cells, which is consistent with our earlier findings that, in the absence of GP-C cleavage, enveloped non-infectious LASV-like particles containing the matrix protein Z and the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex, but devoid of viral glycoproteins, are still released [23] . The lower amount of VSV proteins observed in the cell lysate and supernatant of a 1 -AT RRIL expressing cells reflect lower levels of viral replication, which is due to less efficient virus spread (Fig. 4A) . In contrast to its ability to efficiently block incorporation of LASV GP into virions, the presence of a 1 -AT RRIL had no effect on the release of glycoprotein G containing wild-type VSV particles. The amount of VSV proteins detected in the supernatant from a 1 -AT RRIL expressing cells was similar to the amount of viral proteins observed in supernatants of non-induced cells and CHO-K1 cells, indicating efficient viral replication and cell-to-cell spread of VSVwt despite the presence of a 1 -AT RRIL (Fig. 4B) . Taken together, these data demonstrate that S1P-specific a 1 -antitrypsins have the potential to prevent LASV GP incorporation by inhibiting glycoprotein cleavage, which is an essential prerequisite for infectious progeny.",

To investigate this, we established a 96-well plate assay in which infected cells are immunostained with True Blue substrate as described in Materials and Methods. Virus spread can be monitored by the appearance of characteristic comet-shaped foci, showing that the virus progeny is carried over the cell monolayer, while prevention of virus spread results in limited radial growth, due to infection of only neighbouring cells. This assay allows rapid screening of potential inhibitors [50] . Effect of S1P Inhibition on LASV Replication www.plosntds.org type cells (Fig. 5A, upper panel) . In contrast, virus spread was significantly diminished in cells expressing a 1 -AT specific for S1P (Fig. 5A, lower panel) . These data indicate that S1P-adapted a 1antitrypsins have the potential to specifically inhibit the processing of LASV GP, which in turn is required for efficient virus spread. It should be noted that the infectious foci observed in a 1 -AT RRIL expressing cells were larger compared to SRD-12B cells in which virtually no virus spread of VSVDG/LASVGP was observed, resulting in only single infected cells (Fig. 5A) . Although similar inhibition values were observed by means of immunoblot quantification (Fig. 3) , a few remaining non-detectable cleavage events may count for this limited cell-to-cell spread in a 1 -AT RRIL expressing cells. Cells expressing the furin-adapted a 1 -AT variant RVKR did not prevent virus spread. At first glance, we rather observed an enhancement of infectivity compared to noninduced cells, which might be due to an increase in the LASV cellular receptor a-dystroglycan on the cell surface [56] .",

To this end, cells were infected with VSVDG/LASVGP at an MOI of 0.02 in the presence or absence of doxycycline. Cell culture supernatants were collected 24 h and 48 h post-infection and virus titers were determined by plaque assay. As shown in Table 1 , non-induced S1P-specific a 1 -AT cell lines permitted unaffected growth of Effect of S1P Inhibition on LASV Replication www.plosntds.org VSVDG/LASVGP to comparable titers, whereas virus titers were reduced in cells expressing the S1P-specific a 1 -AT variant. At 24 h post-infection virus production decreased about 100 fold in cells expressing the a 1 -AT variant RRIL compared to non-induced control cultures. The presence of a 1 -AT variant RRLL reduced the virus titer in the supernatant about 10 fold, followed by a 6.2 fold reduction of virus production in a 1 -AT variant RRVL expressing cells. The presence of the a 1 -AT variant RRYL only exhibited a very moderate inhibitory effect on viral replication (inhibition ,2 fold). Again, the presence of the furin-adapted a 1 -AT variant RVKR did not affect VSVDG/LASVGP replication compared to non-induced control cells. Our results indicate that the various S1P-adapted a 1 -antitrypsins exhibit different inhibitory potentials, due to their different recognition motifs. However, the degree of inhibition of virus replication correlated well with the inhibitory potential of the various S1P-adapted a 1 -antitrypsin variants to block LASV GP processing. Interestingly, following the inhibition of virus progeny over a time period of 48 h only the S1P-adapted a 1 -AT variants RRIL and RRLL sustained their inhibitory capacity, whereas in cells expressing a 1 -antitrypsin variants RRVL and RRYL virus production was found to recover although the initial expression levels of a 1 -antitrypsin variants were similar (Table 1 ). These data indicate that the inhibitory potential of the a 1 -AT variants RRVL and RRYL is not sufficient to efficiently suppress the formation of infectious particles by effectively blocking LASV GP-C cleavage, whereas the a 1 -AT variants RRIL and RRLL seem to be appropriate candidates for efficient inhibition of LASV propagation.",

While current antiviral strategies in the arenavirus field mainly target virus entry [58, 59, 60, 61] or replication and assembly [62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67] , inhibition studies of the glycoprotein activating endoprotease and its impact on viral replication are largely unexploited. Due to its central role in the arenavirus life cycle [23, 26, 33, 34] , S1P should be considered as a cellular target for antiviral drug development. In the present study we analyzed the inhibitory effect of S1P-adapted a 1 -antitrypsins on proteolytic processing of LASV GP-C and its consequences for viral replication. To our knowledge, this is the first report that Effect of S1P Inhibition on LASV Replication www.plosntds.org addresses the impact of protein-based S1P inhibition on LASV GP-C cleavage and multicycle replication. Furin-adapted a 1 -ATs have been shown to efficiently inhibit the formation of infectious progeny of other viruses (e.g. HIV, measles virus and human cytomegalovirus) [38, 39, 40, 41, 68, 69] . Using a replication-competent recombinant VSV pseudotyped with the LASV glycoprotein GP [48] , we demonstrate that proteolytic maturation of the precursor GP-C is sensitive to S1Padapted a 1 -ATs. Mutagenesis of the reactive centre loop (RCL) into the S1P recognition motif RRIL resulted in an abrogation of GP-C processing similar to that observed in S1P-deficient SRD-12B cells. The inhibitory activity of the a 1 -AT variant RRIL on LASV GP cleavage described here is in agreement with a previous study showing its inhibitory potential on the processing of the natural S1P substrates SREBP-2 and ATF6 [42] . Also an a 1 -AT variant that contains the LASV GP-C cleavage motif RRLL exhibited a high S1P inhibitory potential and was found to drastically reduce GP processing. Interestingly, this variant exhibited a 100% inhibition activity on maturation cleavage of an artificial pro-PDGF (precursor of platelet-derived growth factor) mutant that is processed by S1P due to introduction of a RRLL cleavage site, but failed to inhibit cleavage of endogenously expressed SREBP-2 [42] . These data indicate that various substrates differ in their sensitivity towards S1P inhibition.",

Therefore, the extent of multicycle replication of LASV and thus, the load of infectious particles in its host organism have an important impact for the progress of disease. Our studies revealed that a 1 -AT variants RRIL and RRLL have a potency sufficient to sustain their inhibitory capacity during multicycle replication, which resulted in a significant reduction of virus infectivity. Inhibition of viral replication correlated with the ability of the a 1 -AT variants RRIL and RRLL to efficiently inhibit the processing of the LASV glycoprotein precursor. Although our data demonstrated that inhibition of glycoprotein cleavage by a 1 -AT RRIL reduced incorporation of the subunits GP-1 and GP-2 into virions to below detectable levels, the viral titer from a 1 -AT RRIL expressing cells was found to be greater than that obtained from S1P null cells. Based on this observation, we consider that even the most potent a 1 -AT variant RRIL failed to entirely inhibit S1P activity. However, given that S1P has important biological functions in the regulation of various cellular processes, a complete inhibition of the catalytic activity of S1P is not desirable. For a 1 -AT variants RRVL and RRYL, we observed similar inhibition values by immunoblot quantification analysis as described for CCHFV GP cleavage [42] . Though, their inhibitory activity on LASV GP-C cleavage was not sufficient to efficiently reduce virus replication of VSVDG/LASVGP. These results should be taken into consideration for experimental setups in future studies that address the impact of S1P inhibition in arenavirus replication.",

These studies can be performed under biosafety level 2 laboratory conditions that would otherwise require biosafety level 4 laboratory conditions [71] .

For example, the addition of exogenous a 1 -AT-PDX, a potent and selective furin inhibitor, was found to efficiently block human cytomegalovirus infection [39] . However, in contrast to furin, which is known to recycle between the plasma membrane and the TGN via endosomal compartments, membrane-bound S1P is localized in the secretory pathway and can be sorted to endosomal compartments but not to the cell surface [73, 74, 75] . Follow-up studies with small synthetic peptides, which are derived from S1P-specific a 1 -antitrypsins described in the present work, are currently in progress and will address cellular delivery and organelle specific targeting, as well as their inhibitory potential on authentic LASV replication. In analogy to inhibition strategies of the eukaryotic subtilase furin, we previously designed and developed a cell-permeable peptidyl chloromethylketone S1P inhibitor, which contained the LASV GP-C cleavage site, designated dec-RRLL-cmk [76, 77, 78] . This irreversible inhibitor efficiently blocked the processing of LASV GP at nanomolar concentrations, however, because of cell type-dependent toxicity observed by us and others, its potential in vitro use requires further investigation [79, 80] .",

With the exception of Ebola virus, whose glycoprotein cleavage by the proprotein convertase furin is not essential for virus replication in cell culture and virulence in nonhuman primates [71, 87, 88, 89] , maturation cleavage of surface glycoproteins of several virus species by endoproteases is a key determinant for host cell tropism and pathogenicity [90] . Thus, the emergence of viral escape mutants that confer resistance due to targeted inhibition of an endogenous protease is rather unlikely. In S1P-deficient SRD-12B cells, which were persistently infected with Junin virus vaccine strain Candid 1, no virus escape variants possessing a cleavage motif other than a S1P recognition motif have evolved, indicating a low potential of arenaviruses to develop de novo a different glycoprotein maturation pathway [33] . This observation together with our findings that inhibition of S1P significantly affects LASV GP processing and virus infectivity should encourage the development of S1P inhibitors as a potential drug target to counteract infections caused by pathogenic arenaviruses.",
