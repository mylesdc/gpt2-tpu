For example, in ovo treatment of CpG DNA significantly induced the recruitment of macrophages in chicken lungs [13] .

Similarly, in another study, the enhanced NO production in macrophages following treatment of the TLR4 ligand, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), led to an antiviral response against infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV) [14] .

In chickens, ssRNA can induce antibacterial effects against Salmonella Enteritidis [17] and antiviral effects against very virulent infectious bursal disease virus infection [18] , similarly in mice, pre-treatment with resiquimod cleared bacteria involved in sepsis [19] . Recently, a study demonstrated that synthetic ssRNA upregulates mRNA of pro-inflammatory mediators including IL-1\u03b2 and iNOS in chicken in vivo [20] . However, the antiviral response of TLR7 activation against ILTV infection in chicken is not known. Therefore, our objectives for this study were to determine 1) whether in ovo treated synthetic ssRNA, resiquimod is capable of eliciting macrophage responses post-hatch, 2) whether activation of the TLR7 pathway stimulates antiviral activity against ILTV and 3) the antiviral mechanisms involved following activation of TLR7 pathway in chicken.",

First, in ovo treated resiquimod can elicit macrophage response in respiratory and intestinal tracts of chicken when the eggs are hatched in addition to IL-1\u03b2 production in lungs. However, in ovo treatment of embryonated eggs with resiquimod did not lead to decrease in ILTV shedding as demonstrated by oropharyngeal ILTV genome loads, although there was a significant decrease in cloacal ILTV shedding recorded only at 7 dpi. Second, resiquimod treatment of avian macrophages leads to antiviral response against ILTV in vitro. Third, we found that resiquimod induces NO and IL-1\u03b2 production, but not type 1 IFN activity in vitro. The resiquimod-mediated antiviral response elicited against ILTV in avian macrophages is not dependent on any of the innate immune mediators observed. Increased recruitment of macrophages has been observed previously in chickens following in ovo treatment of CpG DNA (TLR21 ligand) [13, 30] and LTA (TLR2 ligand) [15] . In the current study, we discovered that in ovo treatment of TLR7 ligand, synthetic ssRNA, increased recruitment of macrophages in respiratory and gastrointestinal systems. Macrophages are key immune cells involved in initiating innate antiviral response by several mechanisms. First, avian macrophages are capable of producing highly reactive antiviral molecules such as NO [36] and previously it has been reported NO mediated antiviral activity against number of avian viruses such as ILTV, reovirus and Marek's disease virus [14, 35, 37] . Second, avian macrophages can produce a number of cytokines such as type 1 IFNs and IL-1\u03b2 [38, 39] . These cytokines can elicit antiviral responses. For example, type I IFNs are effective in reducing avian viruses such as birna virus, corona virus, herpes viruses and paramyxovirus [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] . Third, macrophages play a role as phagocytic cells reducing virus burden in the host [45] . Fourth, as an antigen presenting cell, the macrophages a b Fig. 5 Stimulation of avian macrophages with the synthetic ssRNA, resiquimod increases the production of IL-1\u03b2 but not type 1 IFNs. a Avian macrophages, MQ-NCSU cells, were cultured in 12-well plates (1 \u00d7 10 6 cells per well) for 24 h and stimulated with either resiquimod (10 \u03bcg/ml) or growth media (control) in triplicates. The culture supernatants were collected 24 h post-treatment and transferred to DF-1 cell monolayers grown in 12-well plates and infected with VSV conjugated with GFP (0.1 MOI). At 24 h post infection, the percentage of cells expressing GFP signal was quantified after fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde and nuclear staining. The experiment was repeated two more times with similar results and the data were pooled. The representative figures in each group are shown. b The MQ-NCSU cells were cultured on coverslips in 12-well plates with 1 \u00d7 10 6 viable cells per well and protein transport inhibitor (2 \u03bcl/ml) was added to culture medium after 6 h. After 24 h of culture, the cells were stimulated with resiquimod (10 \u03bcg/ml), or RPMI media as a control separately (triplicates per treatment). Following 24 h of treatment, immunofluorescent staining targeting IL-1\u03b2 was performed after fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde.

            "text": "It has been reported previously that many TLR ligands were able to induce protective host responses against ILTV, such as CpG DNA, LPS and LTA [9, 14, 15, 30] . Although different types of TLR ligands were found to be effective against many viral infections, there is a paucity of literature on the antiviral effect of TLR7 ligand against avian viral infections. Previously, Annamalai et al reported that the TLR7 agonist, R848, induced protective antiviral response against infectious bursal disease virus Fig. 6 Antiviral activity of synthetic resiquimod against ILTV replication is not dependent on IL-1\u03b2 production. Avian macrophages, MQ-NCSU cells, were cultured in 12-well plates (1 \u00d7 10 6 cells per well) for 24 h and stimulated with either resiquimod (10 \u03bcg/ml) or growth media (control) in 6 replicates. The resultant MQ-NCSU cell culture supernatants were collected at 24 h post-treatment and transferred (250 \u03bcl) to LMH cell monolayer. Before transferring MQ-NCSU cell culture supernatants, 3 wells from resiquimod and control groups in LMH cells were incubated with 1.0 \u03bcg/ml of IL-1Ra for 30 min. Twenty-four hours later, the LMH cells were infected with ILTV (300 PFU/well). The plates were stained with 1% crystal violet at 5 dpi and resulting plaques were counted. The experiment was repeated two more times with the same number of replicates with similar results and the data were pooled. ANOVA with Bonferroni's posttest for selected comparison was performed to identify the differences between groups and the differences were considered significant at P < 0.05 infection in 3 weeks old chicken, associated with the upregulation of pro-inflammatory genes, such as IL-1\u03b2, IL-4, iNOS and IFN\u03b3 [18] . Similarly, Stewart et al demonstrated that the other TLR7 ligands, Poly-C and ioxoribine, inhibited low pathogenic H1N1 avian influenza virus replication in chickens and the antiviral response of ioxoribine was associated with the increased gene expression for IFN\u03b1, IFN\u03b2 and IFN\u03bb from primary chicken splenocytes [47] . Our study was directed to demonstrate whether TLR7 ligand, resiquimod was able to elicit antiviral responses against ILTV infection when resiquimod treatment is done in ovo. In agreement with previous studies using other TLR ligands against ILTV infection [9, 14, 15, 30] , we found that in ovo treated resiquimod is capable of eliciting antiviral response against ILTV infection in terms of reducing cloacal virus shedding at 7 dpi. Although we observed that resiquimod was effective when treated in ovo reducing ILTV shedding via cloacal route at 7 dpi, we did not observe a significant reduction in ILTV shedding at 4 dpi and via oropharyngeal route at 4 or 7 dpi. Previously, it has been reported in similar experiment setting that CpG DNA injected in ovo reduces ILTV cloacal shedding at 4 dpi but not the oropharyngeal shedding [48] . It is difficult to explain this discrepancy of ILTV shedding between cloacal and oropharyngeal routes. However, it may be potentially related to the differences in virus replication pattern between 4 dpi and 7 dpi, a differences in the antiviral mechanism induced from a different TLR ligand used [48] and the differences in the immune response between gastrointestinal and respiratory systems [49] such as intestinal immune tolerance [50] and presence of antiviral surfactant proteins in the lungs [51] . Furthermore, we did not observed severe clinical manifestations following ILTV (strain N-71851) infection in this experiment as has been seen previously by our group [30, 48] . The lack of clinical manifestation except transient non-specific signs such as huddling together and droopy and ruffled feathers may be due to differences in the batch of the virus and slight reduction in ILTV titer during storage at \u2212 80\u00b0C.",

Although resiquimod was capable of inducing NO production in vitro, interestingly, we did not find the resiquimod-mediated induction of NO in vivo. Furthermore, the resiquimod-mediated NO production is not eliciting antiviral response against ILTV. However, previously it has been shown that NO originated from LPS/ CpG DNA-mediated induction of avian macrophages is inhibitory against ILTV and low pathogenic avian influenza virus infections [13, 14] . Although, this discrepancy in antiviral response mediated by NO originated from various TLR pathways is difficult to explain, it is possible that the difference may be connected to the amount of NO production downstream of these TLR pathways. In the current study, the amount of NO produced following resiquimod induced macrophages was minimal (< 10 \u03bcM) compared to other TLR ligands we tested previously in similar experimental setting such as LPS (> 50 \u03bcM) [14] and CpG DNA (> 30 \u03bcM) [13] . Overall, our current and previous findings suggest that antiviral response mediated Fig. 7 In ovo synthetic resiquimod treatment increases the production of IL-1\u03b2 from macrophages in lungs in vivo. SPF eggs were treated in ovo with resiquimod (n = 5) or PBS (n = 4) at ED18 and the eggs were incubated until hatch. At day 1 post-hatch, lungs were preserved in OCT, sectioned and double immunofluorescent assay was performed to identify the macrophages that produce IL-1\u03b2. The quantitative data from lung is shown along with representative immunoassayed images. Student's t-test was performed to identify group differences and the differences were considered significant at P < 0.05 by NO is dependent on the concentration of NO. However, one of the limitation in this study is that we did not find the exact level of NO that can decrease the viral replication and that 1400 W can inhibit this antiviral effect by including other TLR ligands such as LPS and CpG DNA at different concentrations.",

Our current data show that macrophages produce IL-1\u03b2 in response to TLR7 ligand, resiquimod in vitro and in vivo in lungs. Direct and indirect IL-1\u03b2 mediated antiviral responses have been observed in other host-virus infection models. Furthermore, it has been reported that IL-1\u03b2 inhibits the replication of West Nile virus [58] , hepatitis B virus [59] , cytomegalovirus [60] and respiratory syncytial virus [61] . However, our current data show that the antiviral response against ILTV infection is not dependent on IL-1\u03b2 originated from avian macrophages in response to resiquimod. Whether this lack of antiviral responses against ILTV attributable to IL-1\u03b2 is due to the amount of IL-1\u03b2 produced following resiquimod treatment requires further investigation. This fact would have been clarified in our in vitro experiment if we had included recombinant IL-1\u03b2 as a positive control. Although, our finding of resiquimod-induced antiviral response against ILTV is not dependent on individual innate immune mediators, it may be potentially due to the combined effect of NO and IL-1\u03b2 or other antiviral cytokines not tested in this study such as IFN\u03b3 [62] .",

Consequently, resiquimod treatment resulted in the reduced ILTV shedding via cloacal route that can minimize transmission potential of the disease. The main implication of this observation is that this induction of immune response via in ovo administration is desirable in the field situations in order to provide early innate immune response at the time of placing the day-old chickens in the barn against circulating environmental pathogens. Although we studied the mechanistic aspects of in ovo resiquimod treatment against only ILTV infection, our finding of the mechanisms of induction of innate immunity following in ovo treatment of resiquimod may be applicable against other respiratory viruses as well due to the non-specific nature of innate host responses which requires further investigation.",

In vitro, we found that although enhanced NO and IL-1\u03b2 productions from avian macrophages are possible following resiquimod stimulation, antiviral response against ILTV is not dependent on individual mediators observed. It is possible that the cells other than macrophages are involved in vivo in eliciting IL-1\u03b2 expression. Although our results provide insights into the mechanisms of antiviral response mediated by resiquimod against ILTV infection in chickens, further investigations are required to identify further cells and mediators involved in enhanced antiviral response against ILTV infection following administration of resiquimod in ovo.
