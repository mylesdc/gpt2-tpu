Although faculty believed that they were the primary library clientele, librarians performed a year-long study of library users to obtain evidence.

For example, modern start-ups and media firms occupy open environments that contain moveable furniture and foster collaboration. Thus, libraries could create student spaces in collaboration with companies like WeWork, which designs and leases coworking spaces that are aesthetically pleasing and flexibly meet user needs.",

Most library users are \"satisficers\" who do not need much data to make a decision, whereas librarians tend to be \"maximizers\"; users might want only a few articles to get started instead of hundreds of references. People are outcome-focused; their objective is simply to get work done. Information may be indistinguishable to users: A student may want a journal article instead of the journal article, and how they get it is irrelevant. People have more choices for sourcing information, with even Garrity admitting that he used Google Scholar rather than his library's search tool for researching his talk. Library tools and services are often invisible, causing users to lose connection with librarians' expertise. Finally, library tools and services are too difficult to use: \"If any business put their customers through what we put our users through, they'd be out of business.\"",

His university has recently seen a burgeoning of research programs, resulting in more researchers experiencing the \"headache\" of complying with open access and data management mandates. At the same time, given the digital medium of today's research process, a traditional university archives approach struggled to capture the story of campus growth. To meet multiple needs at once, Garrity's library has developed a program that simultaneously supports researchers' needs from the beginning of their careers and that preserves and provides access to university materials of enduring value. Together, his library's Archives and Institutional Assets, Scholarly Communications, and Data Management programs rely on referrals among liaison and specialist librarians to connect researchers with library staff who can alleviate their \"headaches,\" while also demonstrating the impact of their research.",

Librarians should put themselves in the role of a new student or faculty member who tries to use library tools and services; \"you might be appalled at what we expect people to do.\" Librarians should ask themselves: Are our tools intuitive to use? Are they convenient (i.e., low-to-no barriers)? Are we enabling our users' success? (2) Do we strive to offer value that is not otherwise available from competitors? (3) Do we make expertise visible, relevant, and intrinsic to the user experience?",

One participant emphasized that librarians \"cannot view libraries as a temple of librarians.\" Rather, libraries should be \"true interprofessional educational homes,\" and user communities should be invited into these spaces to collaboratively solve problems. However, a librarian who said he had long worked to advance interprofessional education expressed concern that different user communities are monolithic entities who engage in tribal affiliation, saying that \"forced mixed groups fall apart.\" This librarian also expressed interest in applying diversity practices (e.g., advocacy, allyship, critical librarianship) and design thinking processes to the redevelopment of library spaces and services as well as working with industry partners toward this end. Garrity agreed with the importance of creating library spaces for diversity and inclusion. He described how the consulting firm brightspot discovered that students at his institution would rather learn from each other than from librarians. Based on this evidence, library spaces were dedicated to specific student advocacy groups, into which librarians \"dropped in\" when students were studying together and were poised to learn. This experience helped librarians break out of the \"I am the informational professional\" perspective and meet students where they are.",

The most popular subject categories are neuroscience, bioinformatics, evolutionary biology, and genomics/genetics.

            "text": "A new approach to authentication is needed because users increasingly access scholarly content from off-campus networks. However, publisher and campus pathways for providing off-network access are complex, cumbersome, and insecure and have not kept pace with the positive user experience offered by other online services (e.g., Google, Facebook, LinkedIn). Despite the disadvantages of IP authentication, most off-campus solutions such as virtual private networks (VPNs)/proxy servers, device pairing, and Google Scholar's Campus Activated Subscriber Access (CASA) still leverage institutional IP address recognition and require user setup in advance. Due to difficulty accessing content from publisher platforms, even when they are fully entitled to access, users are turning to alternative, often illegitimate sources of content (e.g., SciHub) due to their ease of use. Flanagan emphasized the need to develop an approach to authentication that is a better experience for users, quoting Steve Jobs: \"You have to start with the customer experience and work your way back to technology.\" RA21 seeks to implement the same approach to authentication employed by consumer sites but with jmla.mlanet.org the added protection of user privacy. For example, a user can set up a Doodle account using their Google login information, but this results in Doodle having too much information about the user, including name, email address, and picture. With RA21, however, when users are off-campus, they authenticate through their institutions, and the publisher receives attributes about users (e.g., their roles within the institution) but not the users' identities. Additional benefits of RA21 include users' ability to start their searches from their tool of choice (e.g., Google, PubMed) instead of first needing to go through an institutional portal; the lack needing yet another account ID and password, as RA21 leverages a user's existing institutional credentials; the ability to block a single user account instead of an IP address; and the ability for subscribers to receive more granular usage statistics.",

Pickering stated that they trust the publishers that provide content to Yewno and do not censor the literature. Yewno does not \"enter the debate\" but only surfaces links, which must ultimately be evaluated by the user.

Their goal is to help faculty see librarians as partners in the publishing process and to give them tools for evaluating journals (e.g., Editage Insights checklist, Allen Press's phony versus legit infographic) rather than relying on a blacklist.

The question is how to \"curate\" the discovered content in a way that is meaningful to the user's search topic. The search results interface should also map to a subject area librarian who has the expertise to guide the user along another discovery path if the search results do not meet the user's expectations. There should be no dead-ends: users should be presented with a next step (e.g., contact a human expert to explore other search strategies, training opportunities, or different discovery tools). Furthermore, patterns in discovery tool input error could be identified to allow automatic correction by the system.",
