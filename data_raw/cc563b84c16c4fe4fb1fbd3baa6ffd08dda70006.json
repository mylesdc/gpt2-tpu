            "text": "African swine fever virus (ASFV), the etiological agent of African swine fever (ASF), a hemorrhagic fever of domestic pigs, has devastating consequences for the pig farming industry. More than 1,000,000 pigs have been slaughtered since 3 August 2018 in China. However, vaccines or drugs for ASF have yet to be developed. As such, a rapid test that can accurately detect ASFV on-site is important to the timely implementation of control measures. In this study, we developed a rapid test that combines recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) of the ASFV p72 gene with lateral flow detection (LFD). Results showed that the sensitivity of recombinase polymerase amplification with lateral flow dipstick (RPA-LFD) for ASFV was 150 copies per reaction within 10 min at 38 \u2022 C. The assay was highly specific to ASFV and had no cross-reactions with other porcine viruses, including classical swine fever virus (CSFV). A total of 145 field samples were examined using our method, and the agreement of the positive rate between RPA-LFD (10/145) and real-time PCR (10/145) was 100%. Overall, RPA-LFD provides a novel alternative for the simple, sensitive, and specific identification of ASFV and showed potential for on-site ASFV detection.",

ASF, which was first identified by Montgomery (1921) in Kenya in the 1920s, made its first incursion into Europe via two successive entries into Portugal (in 1957 and again in 1960) , spreading rapidly throughout Western Europe and then to South America and the Caribbean (Michaud et al., 2013) . It was eventually eradicated by the mid-1990s, with the exception of Sardinia (Mur et al., 2016) . However, since the second major incursion of the disease, initially into Georgia in 2007, ASF has spread to Eastern Europe and Russia (Rowlands et al., 2008; Revilla et al., 2018) . The virus has continued to spread worldwide, including China. Since the first ASF case emerged in China in August 2018, more than 100 cases have been recorded in 25 provinces (Zhou et al., 2018) .",

Post-mortem examination shows pericardial effusion, kidney enlargement, lymphadenectasis, and darkened and enlarged spleen. All these features are indistinguishable from those seen in classical swine fever virus (CSFV) infection (Tauscher et al., 2015; Li and Tian, 2018) . At present, no effective treatment or vaccine for ASFV is available, and disease control is based mainly on animal slaughtering and strict sanitary measures (Cisek et al., 2016; Rock, 2017) . Rapid laboratory diagnosis is important for timely triage and confirmation to control and preventing this disease because of its rapid progression to death and spread.",

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and real-time PCR techniques have provided a supportive method to post-mortem ASF diagnosis (Aguero et al., 2003; Zsak et al., 2005; Fernandez-Pinero et al., 2013) ; however, they cannot be used for field (on-site) detection in pig farms. Recently, Liu et al. (2019) reported that the improved realtime PCR assay using a Universal Probe Library (UPL) probe could be applied to ASFV molecular diagnosis under field conditions. Due to limitations of the battery-powered realtime PCR instrument, it can process only a moderate number of samples. Isothermal recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) has been successfully used to detect multiple viral pathogens, including infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus (Hou et al., 2017) , bovine coronavirus (Amer et al., 2013) , Ebola virus (Yang et al., 2016) , bovine viral diarrhea virus, or foot-and-mouth disease virus (Wang et al., 2018) . As reports of ASFV detection by RPA are limited, we aimed to develop and evaluate a rapid detection tool that combines immunochromatographic strip tests, more commonly referred to as lateral flow devices (LFDs), with RPA targeting the conserved ASFV p72 gene.",

            "text": "Different isothermal molecule amplification assays, including loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay (LAMP) (James et al., 2010) , polymerase cross-linking spiral reaction (Wozniakowski et al., 2017) , cross-priming amplification method (Fraczyk et al., 2016) , chimeric DNA/LNA-based biosensor (Biagetti et al., 2018) , and droplet digital PCR (Wu et al., 2018) , have been developed as a rapid, simple, and cost-effective alternative to PCR-based molecule assay. RPA has several advantages. For example, initial heating for DNA denaturation is not required, and test conditions (38 \u2022 C within 20 min) are easily implemented. LAMP assay for ASFV detection requires a long time (60 min) and high temperature (62 \u2022 C\u221265 \u2022 C) (James et al., 2010) . By comparison, RPA assay takes less than 20 min at 38 \u2022 C to complete. As such, RPA assay is simpler and more easily used than LAMP assay. Wang et al. (2017) reported the field validation of real-time RPA for ASFV, although this technique can specifically detect ASFV plasmid with a detection limit of 10 2 DNA copies per reaction. However, this detection assay is based on an expensive scanner device. Detection methods for actual clinical samples have yet to be designed, so the application of this test to clinical samples is limited. Gao et al. (2018) developed crosspriming amplification combined with immune-chromatographic strips for the rapid on-site detection of ASFV, but its reaction conditions include 60 min at 59 \u2022 C and six primers for a reaction system, thereby causing non-specific amplification. The use of lateral flow assays combined with a monoclonal antibody against p72 protein of ASFV can be used to detect p72 viral and recombinant protein or inactivated culture virus (Sastre et al., 2016) ; however, the sensitivity of the assay is 100-fold lower than genomic amplification.",

In combination with a commercially magnetic nanobead-based DNA extraction kit, this approach can be applied to on-site testing or rapid diagnosis under poorly equipped conditions. RPA is highly resistant to crude samples, suggesting that it can be used for on-the-spot field testing with crude nucleic acid extraction. In an RPA-NFO reaction system, NFO cleaves the primer of the probe at the THF position and effectively deblocks the probe, thereby generating a new 3 hydroxyl group that can act as a primer for polymerase extension; thus, the probe is transformed into an extension primer with an increased specificity of amplification (James and Macdonald, 2015) .",

Therefore, precautions should be taken. For example, reaction tubes should be carefully opened and closed, gloves should frequently be changed, the progress of pre-and post-RPA amplification should be separated, and reaction time should be shortened if possible. The replacement of dTTP with dUTP may help prevent such carryover contamination as demonstrated in other nucleic amplified system assays.",
