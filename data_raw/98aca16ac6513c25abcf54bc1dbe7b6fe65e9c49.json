The MDCK cell line was established from the kidney of a healthy cocker spaniel dog in 1958 and has a long history in the studies of influenza viruses. The conventional MDCK cell with adherent growth (MDCK-A) is a good candidate for the preparation of vaccine seed viruses, since it supports efficient growth of human influenza viruses. 10, 11 The MDCK33016PF suspension cell line, designated as MDCK-S in this paper, was first developed and utilized to produce seasonal influenza vaccines. [11] [12] [13] Suspension cells are superior to adherent cells owing to the following advantages: simpler culture process without micro-carrier beads, lower cost, and higher virus yield. Therefore, MDCK-S could be a suitable substrate for influenza vaccine seed preparation.",

Methods: A total of 341 clinical specimens were collected from patients with influenza or influenza-like illness and analyzed by ResPlex II assay to detect 18 respiratory viruses. The patterns of co-infection were statistically analyzed with Fisher's exact test. The samples with double or triple infections were passaged in suspension MDCK cells (MDCK-S), adherent MDCK cells (MDCK-A), and LLC-MK2D cells. Cellpassaged samples were analyzed by ResPlex II assay again to investigate whether each cell line could amplify influenza viruses and eliminate other respiratory viruses. Results: Double infections were detected in 8.5% and triple infections in 0.9% of the collected clinical specimens. We identified four pairs of viruses with significant correlation. For all samples with double and triple infection, MDCK-S and MDCK-A could selectively propagate influenza viruses, while eliminating all contaminating viruses. In contrast, LLC-MK2D showed lower isolation efficiency for influenza virus and higher isolation efficiency for coxsackievirus/echovirus than MDCK-S and MDCK-A. Conclusions: Both MDCK-S and MDCK-A are considered suitable for the preparation of influenza vaccine seed viruses without adventitious agents or egg-adaptation mutations.",

            "text": ", one of the most effective measures to prevent influenza virus infection, is mainly produced in embryonated chicken eggs. However, influenza viruses propagated in eggs frequently acquire antigenic alteration through host adaptation, 4-9 and this change would pose a serious challenge owing to the reduction in vaccine effectiveness. Cell-based vaccines can potentially solve the problem of antigenic changes associated with egg adaptation. Vaccine seed viruses, for cell-based vaccines, can be prepared from clinical specimens with cell cultures; however, clinical samples have a risk of harboring respiratory viruses other than influenza viruses. Moreover, mammalian cells might amplify contaminating human viruses more easily than embryonated chicken eggs owing to host similarity. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the patterns of co-infection present in clinical samples and explore whether cell culture technology can selectively propagate influenza viruses from samples containing other respiratory viruses. For the propagation of influenza viruses, cell lines such as Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, Vero cells, LLC-MK2 cells, and PER.C6 cells have been commonly used.",

We identified four pairs of viruses with significant association (P < .05), where INFA-INFB and INFB-CVEV showed negative correlation and CVEV-RHV and CVEV-RSVB exhibited positive correlation (Table 2). However, influenza viruses were not significantly correlated with most of the other respiratory viruses. These results suggest that INFA and INFB would mutually interfere in each other's infection, whereas infection with influenza and other viruses would occur independently in most cases. To investigate whether MDCK-S, MDCK-A, and LLC-MK2D can selectively amplify influenza virus in the presence of other respiratory viruses, co-infection samples containing influenza virus plus other viruses were inoculated and passaged in the three cell lines. From all samples with triple or double infection, MDCK-S and MDCK-A could selectively allow proliferation of influenza viruses while eliminating all contaminating viruses (Table 3). Particularly, the isolation rates of influenza viruses were significantly higher than those of co-existing viruses in the groups of double infection 1 (INFA and OC43, P < .01), double infection 2 (INFA and CVEV, P < .01), and double infection 3 (INFA and RHV, P < .05). For LLC-MK2D, influenza viruses were isolated from the groups of double infection 1 and double infection 3 without propagation of adventitious viruses; however, the differences in detection rates between influenza virus and others were not significant. In the double infection 2 group, an isolate of CVEV was obtained from four specimens (25%), although no influenza virus was amplified during cell passages. To examine further whether MDCK-S, MDCK-A, and LLC-MK2D can eliminate contaminating viruses, we passaged clinical specimens containing respiratory viruses other than influenza virus in the three cell lines.

Brunstein et al 17 have reported some statistically relevant associations between particular pathogens such as CVEV-RHV (positive correlation) and INFB-CVEV (negative correlation). These results were reproduced in the present study. Moreover, we newly identified INFA-INFB as a negatively associated pair and CVEV-RSVB as a positively associated pair. We anticipated that in the case of co-infection, a negative correlation would be observed frequently because the first viral infection would activate interferon signaling and interfere with the second viral infection. However, our study detected significant co-suppression only in INFA-INFB and INFB-CVEV. Influenza viruses did not exhibit remarkable association with most of the other respiratory viruses. One possible explanation for this could be the attenuation of interferon signaling by virally encoded proteins such as influenza virus NS1. It is also possible that the required sample size was larger than that in the present study for detection of more significant associations between influenza viruses and other viruses. These results suggest that co-existence of influenza virus",

The two MDCK cell lines showed different growth phenotypes; MDCK-S is a suspension cell line, whereas MDCK-A is an adherent cell line. This difference suggests that MDCK-S and MDCK-A have dissimilar patterns of glycosylation and protein expression on the cell surface. Consequently, we expected that MDCK-S and MDCK-A would exhibit different profiles of virus amplification; however, MDCK-S and MDCK-A showed the same results as both cell lines could propagate all influenza viruses and remove all adventitious agents from multiple infection samples. These results demonstrate that both MDCK-S and MDCK-A could be good cell substrates for the preparation of vaccine seed viruses. Regarding LLC-MK2D, the isolation rate of influenza viruses was 9.1% (n = 22), whereas that in MDCK-S and MDCK-A was 100% with a statistically significant difference (P < .01). From four samples in the group of double infection 2, all contaminating CVEV was eradicated during passages in MDCK-S and MDCK-A, whereas one CVEV was isolated during LLC-MK2D passages.

When a novel respiratory virus emerges that can replicate well in MDCK cells with influenza viruses, it might be difficult to prepare seed viruses from clinical specimens.In this situation, reverse genetics is useful because plasmids with no virus are starting materials to produce influenza viruses.A(H3N2) viruses particularly have serious problems such as low replication efficiency in embryonated hen eggs and critical antigenic alterations during egg adaptation.19,20 Recently, the US-FDA approved an influenza vaccine with cell-derived seed virus.21 It is thus expected that a completely cell-based A(H3N2) vaccine will pave the way to overcome the difficulties associated with egg-based vaccines.MDCK-S and MDCK-A cells were determined to be useful in this study for the preparation of vaccine seed viruses without adventitious agents.
