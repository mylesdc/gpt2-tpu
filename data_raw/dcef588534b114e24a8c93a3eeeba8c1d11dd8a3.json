            "text": "Interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) inhibit infection of diverse enveloped viruses, including the influenza A virus (IAV) which is thought to enter from late endosomes. Recent evidence suggests that IFITMs block virus hemifusion (lipid mixing in the absence of viral content release) by altering the properties of cell membranes. Consistent with this mechanism, excess cholesterol in late endosomes of IFITM-expressing cells has been reported to inhibit IAV entry. Here, we examined IAV restriction by IFITM3 protein using direct virus-cell fusion assay and single virus imaging in live cells. IFITM3 over-expression did not inhibit lipid mixing, but abrogated the release of viral content into the cytoplasm. Although late endosomes of IFITM3-expressing cells accumulated cholesterol, other interventions leading to aberrantly high levels of this lipid did not inhibit virus fusion. These results imply that excess cholesterol in late endosomes is not the mechanism by which IFITM3 inhibits the transition from hemifusion to full fusion. The IFITM3's ability to block fusion pore formation at a post-hemifusion stage shows that this protein stabilizes the cytoplasmic leaflet of endosomal membranes without adversely affecting the lumenal leaflet. We propose that IFITM3 interferes with pore formation either directly, through partitioning into the cytoplasmic leaflet of a hemifusion intermediate, or indirectly, by modulating the lipid/protein composition of this leaflet. Alternatively, IFITM3 may redirect IAV fusion to a non-productive pathway, perhaps by promoting fusion with intralumenal vesicles within multivesicular bodies/late endosomes.",

IFITM2 and -3 are predominantly found in late endosomes (LE) and lysosomes [13, 14] , whereas IFITM1 is also found at the cell periphery [4, 15] . Different membrane topologies of IFITMs have been proposed [16] , but recent data suggests that IFITM3 is a type II transmembrane protein [17] . Accumulating evidence implies that IFITMs may interfere with virus-endosome fusion [1, 2, 5, 13, 14] . The fact that IFITMs seem to expand acidic intracellular compartments [13] indicates that the fusion block is downstream of the low pH trigger. Effective restriction of viruses that enter from the LE, such as IAV, Ebola virus (EBOV) and SARS coronavirus seems consistent with the cellular localization of IFITM2 and -3 proteins. However, these proteins also restrict Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV) that appears to fuse with early endosomes [18] .",

            "text": "IFITMs have been reported to curtail viral infection by modifying properties of cellular membranes, such as fluidity and spontaneous curvature [3, 5, 14] . These effects could be related, in part, to the accumulation of cholesterol in LE as a result of IFITM-mediated disruption of the interaction between the vesiclemembrane-protein-associated protein A (VAPA) and oxysterolbinding protein (OSBP) [14] . Since lipids play an important role in membrane fusion, these findings offer an attractive paradigm for a broad antiviral defense mechanism that involves altering the lipid composition of cellular membranes. The recent finding that amphotericin B, which forms complexes with sterols [19] , rescues IAV infection in IFITM2-and IFITM3-expressing cells [20] is in line with the notion that cholesterol may be directly or indirectly involved in IAV restriction. However, lipid composition-based models do not readily explain the lack of restriction of amphotropic MLV and arenaviruses, which enter cells via distinct endocytic routes [21, 22] . These findings indicate that IFITMs may restrict virus entry from a subset of intracellular compartments. In order to define the mechanism of IFITM restriction, it is important to identify the viral entry step(s) targeted by these proteins, define compartments in which restriction occurs, and elucidate potential changes in intracellular membranes that may be responsible for this phenotype.",

Our results show that IFITM3 does not inhibit the lipid mixing stage of IAV fusion but blocks the release of viral contents into the cytosol, and that this phenotype does not correlate with cholesterol accumulation in intracellular compartments. Specifically, IFITM3 inhibits the conversion of hemifusion to fusion through a mechanism that does not rely on cholesterol accumulation. Together these findings reveal a previously unappreciated view of IFITM-mediated restriction and suggest new avenues of investigation to delineate the mechanism by which these proteins block infection.",

Since published data suggest that IFITM3 likely inhibits the viral fusion step, a direct virus-cell fusion assay was employed to evaluate the extent of restriction in different cell lines [23] . HIV-1 particles carrying the b-lactamase-Vpr (BlaM-Vpr) chimera and pseudotyped with the influenza HA and NA proteins from the H1N1 A/WSN/33 strain (referred to as IAVpp) were allowed to fuse with cells transduced with an empty vector or with an IFITM3-expressing vector. The resulting cytosolic BlaM activity was measured as previously described [24] . Out of several cell lines tested, A549 and MDCK cells over-expressing IFITM3 were least permissive to IAVpp fusion (Fig. 1A) . In agreement with the previous reports [2, 13] , we found that IFITM3 overexpression partially inhibited VSV G glycoprotein-mediated fusion of pseudoviruses (VSVpp) carrying the BlaM-Vpr chimera (Fig. 1A) . Similar to inhibition of IAVpp fusion, the IFITM3mediated restriction of VSVpp was most potent in A549 and MDCK cells. As expected, fusion of particles pseudotyped with the Lassa fever virus glycoprotein (LASVpp), which directs virus entry through an IFITM3-resistant pathway [2, 6] , was not considerably affected by IFITM3 over-expression.",

Of note, potent IAV restriction in A549 and MDCK cells was not related to the usage of HIV-1 corebased pseudoviruses. Influenza virus-like particles containing the IAV BlaM-M1 chimera [25] also failed to efficiently fuse with A549-IFITM3 and MDCK-IFITM3 cells while fusing well with vectortransduced cells (Fig. 1C) . We also found that both vectortransduced A549 and MDCK cells were highly susceptible to IAV infection, as determined by virus titration (see Materials and Methods).

Since fusion with the plasma membrane is more amenable to mechanistic studies than endocytic entry, we asked whether IFITM3 can restrict forced IAV fusion. Exposure to acidic buffer induced IAVpp fusion with A549-Vector cells pretreated with Bafilomycin A1 (BafA1), which blocked low pH-dependent entry from endosomes (Fig. 1D ). The extent of forced fusion was lower compared to the conventional entry route. By contrast, forced IAVpp fusion with A549-IFITM3 cells was ,3-fold more efficient than endocytic fusion with cells not treated with low pH or BafA1, showing that IFITM3 does not restrict IAVpp fusion at the cell surface. Interestingly, IFITM1 suppressed IAVpp-plasma membrane fusion at low pH (Fig. 1D ), in agreement with the Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (JSRV) and IAV fusion data [5, 20] . The inability of IFITM3 to block IAV fusion with the plasma membrane is consistent with its lower abundance at the cell surface [13, 14, 20] and shows that the mechanism of restriction must be studied in intracellular compartments.",

IFITMs are thought to prevent virus hemifusion (merger of contacting leaflets without formation of a fusion pore) by altering the properties of cell membranes. Here we performed single IAV imaging and found that IFITM3 did not interfere with hemifusion, but prevented complete fusion. Also, contrary to a current view that excess cholesterol in late endosomes of IFITM3-expressing cells inhibits IAV entry, we show that cholesterol-laden endosomes are permissive for virus fusion. The ability of IFITM3 to block the formation of fusion pores implies that this protein stabilizes the cytoplasmic leaflet of endosomal membranes, either directly or indirectly, through altering its physical properties. IFITM3 may also redirect IAV to a non-productive pathway by promoting fusion with intralumenal vesicles of late endosomes instead of their limiting membrane.",

In addition, we did not detect any correlation between the lag before the onset of lipid mixing and the vDiD dequenching slope (Fig. S4A ). This result reinforces the notion that late lipid mixing events are mediated by HA and not by virus degradation. Control experiments, in which samples were not exposed to laser light during the first 30 min at 37uC, did not reveal fast dequenching events reaching completion in less than 1 min (data not shown).

To assess whether early fusion intermediates in control and IFITM3 + cells restrict vDiD diffusion to the same extent, we examined the rate of vDiD dequenching. Single particle analysis revealed that, in A549 cells, the average vDiD dequenching profile (Fig. 3C ) was independent of IFITM3 expression, as were the initial slopes of vDiD dequenching ( Fig.  S4B , P.0.5). These results indicate that IFITM3 over-expression does not affect the properties of fusion intermediates responsible for vDiD redistribution, such as the size and/or architecture of a hemifusion site (e.g., [34, 35] ). We then asked whether the rate of vDiD dequenching varied depending on the cell type. The average rate of vDiD fluorescence increase in MDCK cells was ,2-fold greater than in A549 cells (Figs. 3C and S4B, P,0.02). This demonstrates our ability to detect changes in the rate of vDiD transfer and shows that lipid transfer lasts several minutes irrespective of the cell type.",

The only difference was that virus imaging was not continued beyond 1 h after initiation of fusion, whereas infection proceeded overnight. We found that one or more vDiD dequenching events occurred in 15% of A549 cells while 44% of cells got infected (Fig. S5 ). Under the same conditions, 20% of MDCK cells ''hosted'' one or more dequenching events and 36% were infected. The greater fraction of infected cells compared to those permissive to hemifusion is likely due to the shorter time widow for single virus imaging, which is likely to miss late vDiD dequencing events (Fig. 3B ). The lower apparent fraction of cells supporting vDiD dequenching could also be caused by the presence of viruses that did not incorporate self-quenching amounts of vDiD. Importantly, the comparable efficiencies of lipid mixing and infection, indicate that the former events likely culminate in productive infection.",

The average pH in virus-containing endosomes of MDCK-IFITM3 cells was slightly less acidic than in control cells: 5.3860.03 (n = 498) vs. 4.9860.04 (n = 242), respectively ( Fig. 6D and F, P, 0.001). Interestingly, as shown in Figure 6E , endosomal pH in U18666A-treated MDCK cells was markedly shifted to neutral values (6.4460.05, n = 160, P,0.001). Since the pH threshold for triggering A/PR/8/34 fusion is reported to be around 5.6 [43] , elevation of endosomal pH in U18666A-treated MDCK cells is the likely cause of inhibition of viral fusion. Together our results We also took advantage of the available CHO cell line that does not express NPC1 [44] to further ascertain the role of endosomal cholesterol in IAV fusion. These cells (designated CHO-NPC1 2 ) exhibited exaggerated endosomal cholesterol staining, in sharp contrast to a peripheral staining pattern in parental CHO cells (Fig. 7A) . In spite of the high endosomal cholesterol content in CHO-NPC1 2 cells and of the elevated level of total cholesterol (Fig. S6 ), IAVpp fused with these cells as efficiently as with parental cells (Fig. 7C) . The NPC1-null cells also supported IAV lipid mixing, albeit at somewhat reduced level compared to control (Figs. 7D and S8) . Pretreatment of CHO cells with U18666A also trapped cholesterol in endosomes and raised the total cholesterol content (Figs. 7B and S6 ), but only modestly diminished the extent of IAVpp or VSVpp fusion (Fig. 7E) . Interestingly, in contrast to the decreased endosome acidity in MDCK cells, endosomes in U18666A-treated CHO cells were more acidic than in control cells (Fig. S9) . In control experiments, both the lack of NPC1 expression and U18666A pretreatment blocked EBOVpp fusion (Fig. 7C, E) , consistent with its reliance on NPC1 receptor and high sensitivity to disruptions of cholesterol transport [45] .",

Recent studies lead to a model that IFITMs inhibit virus-host hemifusion [5] and that the membranerigidifying properties of cholesterol may contribute to antiviral actions [14] . In contrast to these studies, our results now demonstrate that IFITM3 prevents the release of viral genomes into the cytosol by inhibiting viral entry after hemifusion but prior to fusion pore formation (Fig. 8) . Moreover, we found that IFITM3 can promote hemifusion in some cells, perhaps secondary to its acidifying the endosomal pathway. IFITM3 therefore does not negatively regulate the properties of contacting leaflets involved in hemifusion, but stabilizes the cytoplasmic leaflet of the endosomal membrane, thereby disfavoring the formation of fusion pores [35] . In one potential scenario IFITM3 is located directly at the site of arrested hemifusion, perhaps ''toughening'' the endosomal membrane to create a barrier to viral entry (Pathway 1). A considerable colocalization of IFITM3 with internalized IAV ( [3] and Fig. S10 ) is consistent with Pathway 1's direct mechanism of inhibition. Alternatively, IFITM3 might arrest hemifusion through an indirect mechanism, perhaps involving modulation of lipid and/or protein composition of the cytoplasmic leaflet (Pathway 2). Recent findings that changes in global membrane properties interfere with productive entry would appear to support an indirect mechanism [5, 14] .",

Although this prediction is consistent with efficient lipid mixing in endosomes of IFITM3 + cells observed in our imaging experiments, several studies [20, [46] [47] [48] and our own results do not support cholesterol accumulation as playing a role in fusion inhibition. We found that cholesterolladen endosomes in cells pretreated with U18666A or expressing undetectable/low levels of NPC1 supported efficient viral fusion.

If, as suggested in [14] , IFITM3 disallows back fusion of ILVs with the limiting membrane, then virus-ILV fusion products will likely be degraded. Indeed, back fusion has been implicated in the VSV core release into the cytosol following the virus-ILV fusion [50] . It should be stressed that this ''fusion decoy'' model does not explain the ability of IFITM1 to interfere with fusion at the cell surface ( [5] and Fig. 1D ).

This is because a lipophilic dye in the limiting membrane of an endosome should be quickly removed through membrane trafficking [24, 31, 52] . Because post-dequenching decay was not observed irrespective of the level of IFITM3 expression, it is possible that IAV may infect several cell lines by fusing with small intralumenal vesicles followed by the nucleocapsid release through back fusion (Fig. 8, dashed black arrows) . This pathway could explain the similar extents and rates of vDiD dequenching in control and IFITM3-expressing cells, which are indicative of similar lipid intermediates and of the size of a target membrane, respectively.",

Slow dilution of this dye in Pathway 3 could occur through multiple rounds of IAV fusion with small ILVs, whereas Pathways 1 and 2 would predict restricted lipid diffusion through early fusion intermediates formed at the limiting membrane. Although the latter notion is in agreement with the reported restriction of lipid movement through hemifusion sites and small fusion pores [34, 35, 53, 54] , these intermediates are usually short-lived under physiological conditions and tend to resolve into larger structures that do not impair lipid movement [28, 32, 35] . Clearly, more detailed studies of virusendosome hemifusion and fusion are needed to understand the nature of slow lipid redistribution between IAV and endosomes.",

While both IFITM3's membrane-associated topology and its localization to the site of viral attenuation suggest it acts to restrict viral entry via a direct mechanism, additional work remains to be done to fully elucidate its actions. Nonetheless, as the primary effector of IFN's anti-IAV actions, IFITM3 represents a previously unappreciated class of restriction factor that prevents viral entry by stabilizing a hemifusion intermediate, likely comprised of an invading virus fatally tethered to the interior of the endosome's limiting membrane. Future single virus experiments combining the detection of both viral lipid and content release events (see for example [52] ) should provide further insights into IAV entry pathways and the mechanism of IFITM3-mediated restriction. Indeed, such efforts may also bring to light unknown viral countermeasures, which are perhaps employed by the IFITMresistant New and Old World arenaviruses.",

Images were collected from at least 10 different fields, and single particle-based ratio of fluorescence signals was calculated. Outliers with a near-background CypHer5E signal were rejected to reduce the uncertainty in pH measurements.",

Single-particle fusion events in control and IFITM3 expressing cells were compared by the z-test. Figure S5 Relationship between IAV lipid mixing activity and infection. The fraction of A549 cells where at least one lipid mixing event was observed within 1 h at 37uC, and the fraction of cells that became infected within 15 h at 37uC were estimated as described in Methods S1. Infectivity data were collected from 5 image fields each, with .30 cells per field. Particle-to infectivity ratio was calculated from the fraction of infected cells and the average number of virions bound to cells. Figure S7 Calibration of labeled IAV as a pH-sensor. AF488-and CypHer5E-labeled IAV particles were attached to poly-L-lysine coated coverslips, and the ratio of two fluorescence signals was measured in citrate-phosphate buffers of different acidity. (A) Top and bottom panels are images of labeled IAV at neutral pH and low pH, respectively. (B) The total signal for each dye was determined after thresholding and the CypHer5E/AF488 ratio at different pH are plotted. Error bars are standard deviations for 3 different imaged fields for each pH value. The line indicates a first order polynomial fit to the data, which served as a pH calibration curve. (PDF) Figure S8 An example of single IAV lipid mixing event in CHO cells. (A) Image panels show entry of an AF488 (green) and vDiD (red) labeled virus into a CHO cell that culminates in vDiD dequenching (arrow).

Shown are the distributions of endosomal pH in CHO cells pretreated with 40 mM of U18666A for 12 h or left untreated. Cells were incubated with AF488/Cypher5E-labeled IAV, and endosomal pH was measured as described in Materials and Methods. U18666A increased endosomal acidity (P,0.001). (PDF) Figure S10 Incoming IAV tends to colocalize with IFITM3-positive endosomes. A549-IFITM3 cells were allowed to internalize IAV for 90 min at 37uC and immunostained for the IAV-NP using mouse antibody (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and for IFITM3. The enlarged boxed area is shown on the right. IAV and IFITM3 puncta were identified by thresholding and object identification. The extent of colocalization was estimated by counting IAV puncta, which exhibited a volumetric overlap of at least 50% with IFITM3 puncta, and normalizing over all IAV puncta. The number in the right corner is the mean % colocalization and standard deviation for 7 image fields. (PDF) Figure S11 A line-fitting approach to determining the onset and the initial rate of vDiD dequenching in single IAV fusion experiments. Fitting the vDiD dequenching traces with two straight lines yields the time of hemifusion (T H ) and the initial slope of dequenching. (PDF)",
