Protein component modifications caused by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion are related to a wide range of human diseases; however, little is known about how nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins (mt proteome) changes under such dysfunctional states. In this study, we investigated the systemic alterations of mtDNA-depleted (r 0 ) mitochondria by using network analysis of gene expression data. By modularizing the quantified proteomics data into protein functional networks, systemic properties of mitochondrial dysfunction were analyzed. We discovered that up-regulated and down-regulated proteins were organized into two predominant subnetworks that exhibited distinct biological processes. The down-regulated network modules are involved in typical mitochondrial functions, while up-regulated proteins are responsible for mtDNA repair and regulation of mt protein expression and transport. Furthermore, comparisons of proteome and transcriptome data revealed that r 0 cells attempted to compensate for mtDNA depletion by modulating the coordinated expression/transport of mt proteins. Our results demonstrate that mt protein composition changed to remodel the functional organization of mitochondrial protein networks in response to dysfunctional cellular states. Human mt protein functional networks provide a framework for understanding how cells respond to mitochondrial dysfunctions.",

Proteins rarely act alone but rather interact with other proteins and comprise specific functional modules in the network [7] . Functional module is a group of proteins which are related by one or more cellular and genetic interactions such as co-regulation, co-expression, and the member of a biological pathway or a protein complex [8] . Such module is the building block of cellular organization and carries out unique biological process [9] .

Although mitochondria possess their own DNA, it is estimated that at least 98% of the 1,500-2,000 mitochondrial proteins are encoded by nuclear genes and shuttled posttranslationally into the mitochondria [11, 12] . In addition, the majority of human mt disorders are known to be related with nuclear genome defects [13] . Thus, compiling a comprehensive list of mt proteins is essential to understand mitochondrial biogenesis and pathology. Large-scale approaches such as mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics [14] , epitope tagging combined with microscopy [15] , genome-wide predictions of protein subcellular localizations [16] , and comparative genomics analyses [17, 18, 19] have revealed the localization of the mt protein inventory.",

MtDNA-depleted (r 0 ) osteosarcoma cell has been used as an important tool to investigate dysfunctional mitochondria. The r 0 cell was established by long-term treatment of ethidium bromide (EtBr) which intercalated into mtDNA without any detectable effect on nuclear DNA division [30] and led to the inhibition of mtDNA replication and transcription [31] . Thus, we examined a set of nuclear-encoded mt proteins as mt proteome. To quantify protein abundance ratios of mt proteins in r 0 versus r + mitochondria, we labeled mt proteins with cICAT containing light ( 12 C) and heavy ( 13 C) isotope signatures, which react with thiol groups of cysteines in proteins. The experimental scheme is summarized in Figure S1 (see Materials and Methods for details). From the cICAT analysis, we identified 1,121 proteins (Table S1 ). According to the mt protein abundance ratios (r 0 /r + ), we classified all proteins into three classes: up-regulated, downregulated, and not significantly changed proteins in r 0 mitochondria. The number of up-regulated proteins with r 0 /r + $1.5 was 201, while the number of down-regulated proteins with r 0 / r + #0.67 was 313.The thresholds of 1.5 represents the 1.5-fold increase, whereas the threshold of 0.67 represents 1.5-fold decrease under dysfunctional r 0 state. Meanwhile, 607 not significantly changed proteins were present in both r 0 and r + mitochondria with similar abundances (0.67,r 0 /r + ,1.5).",

In total, 569 out of 1,121 proteins (50.76%) were annotated as mitochondrial proteins and observed from at least one reference mt protein dataset ( Figure 1B) . Then, we assessed the physical and functional links of reference mt proteins based on the assumption that protein pairs that interact or share similar functions tend to cluster within the same subcellular organelle [15] . A total of 201 proteins were physically (82 proteins, 7.31%) or functionally (119 proteins, 10.62%) linked to the 569 reference mt proteins ( Figure 1B ). Physical link represents proteinprotein interaction. Meanwhile, functional link represents a relationship between two proteins if they shared a substrate in a metabolic pathway, co-expressed, co-regulated, or involved in the same protein complex. We listed these 770 mt proteins (569+82+119) in Table S1 as a reliable mt protein dataset. Among the 770 mt proteins, the numbers of down-regulated, up-regulated, and not significantly changed proteins were 288, 122, and 360, respectively ( Figure 1C ).

To meet the specific needs of different cellular states, mitochondrial protein repertoires are adjusted. It is critical to characterize the systemic alterations of mitochondria to different cellular states to understand the dynamic organization of mitochondrial systems. In this study, we modularized the quantified proteomics data into protein functional networks to characterize gene expression changes under dysfunctional mitochondrial conditions. Our results demonstrate that mitochondrial protein repertoires changed to compensate for dysfunctional cellular states by reorganizing mitochondrial protein functional network. Through network clustering analysis, we discovered that cells respond to pathological conditions by modulating the coordinated expression/transport of mitochondrial proteins.

When we measured the fraction of links per protein, intraregulatory links were 3-fold more common than interregulatory links (Whitney-Mann U test, p-value = 7.55610 278 ; Figure 2C ). Furthermore, the shortest path length of proteins connected within intraregulatory links was smaller than that of proteins connected within interregulatory links (Whitney-Mann U test, p-value = 7.55610 2156 ; Figure 2D ). Shortest path length is the minimum number of links connecting one protein to another protein in the network, thus a smaller shortest path length implies that two proteins are more closely related [6] .

            "text": "Expression profile analysis of mt protein and mRNA under a dysfunctional mt state Eukaryotic cells can monitor and respond to changes in mt conditions through alterations of nuclear gene expression [32] . To understand how cells respond to the dysfunctional r 0 state to facilitate survival, we analyzed the expression profiles of mt proteins and mRNAs. We found that 40% of mt proteins (274 = 127+147) exhibited a positive correlation between protein and mRNA abundances, while 43% of mt proteins (296 = 78+218) exhibited a negative correlation between protein and mRNA abundances ( Figure 4A ). By using the kmeans clustering algorithm, the mRNA and protein-expression profiles were divided into five groups depending on the abundance ratios of mt protein-mRNA: up-up (127), downdown (147), up-down (78), down-up (218), and unchanged (118) groups ( Figure 4A and Table S4 for protein list). We found that up-regulated and down-regulated functional modules exhibited distinctive patterns in expression profiles ( Figure 4B and C; details in Table S3 ). Specifically, both protein and mRNA abundances increased in the five up-regulated functional modules ( Figure 4B ). Conversely, mRNA abundances increased, but mt protein levels were decreased in the eight down-regulated functional modules ( Figure 4C ). The upregulated functional modules were involved in mtDNA maintenance and control of mt protein transport. The downregulated functional modules were associated with mitochondrial energy production and metabolism. These results suggest that cells actively modulate the expression and transport of mt proteins depending on the functions necessary to survival under pathological conditions.",

We found that the levels of seven out of the eight up-regulated proteins were increased in r 0 mitochondria ( Figure 5A ). The up-regulated proteins were eIF4A1, PLG, HNRPM, XRCC6 (Ku70), XRCC5 (Ku80), APEX1, and STUB1. Likewise, the levels of all tested down-regulated proteins were decreased in r 0 mitochondria, consistent with the cICAT quantifications ( Figure 5B ). The down-regulated proteins were GTPBP3, NDUFS6, ATP5A1, ALDH6A1, GLUD1, MTRF1, TFAM, HSPD1 (HSP60), and ALDH2. The change of PARP1 levels was not detected by western blot. Additionally, the reliability of the protein expression patterns of cICAT was further confirmed by comparing the expression patterns of previously reported 2DE proteomic analyses [33] . Thirty of the 33 mt proteins (90.91%) identified from the 2DE proteomic analyses showed similar expression patterns compared to those obtained from the cICAT analysis ( Figure S2 ). The difference between protein expression patterns of cICAT and 2DE was insignificant (p-value was only 0.08).",

We found that up-regulated and down-regulated proteins of dysfunctional mt states were organized into two predominant subnetworks that exhibited distinct biological processes. It has been suggested that proteins cooperate with other proteins as a part of functional module which tend to physically associated or share similar expressions to deliver a certain biological function [36, 37] . Network analyses of molecular pathways or complexes elucidated the collective behavior of differentially expressed proteins and provided complementary information to conventional single gene-based analysis which routinely performed in proteomic analyses [38, 39] . We discovered that not only the relevant proteins changed their expression under dysfunctional mt state, but also the subnetworks composed of multiple functional protein groups changed their expression cooperatively to regulate biological processes. These network-module alterations are particular importance for relating an altered phenotype with dysfunctional mt state at molecular level because phenotypic alterations are more closely related with pathway remodeling than individual gene expression changes [38] .",

            "text": "We found that functional modules controlling mt protein translation, folding, proteolysis, and mtDNA repair were upregulated in the dysfunctional r 0 state (Figure 3 ). To properly respond to changes in cellular states, these processes may require retrograde regulation [35] . Retrograde signaling regulates many cellular activities under pathophysiological conditions by changing the protein inventories of subcellular organelles. It may be possible that up-regulated mt proteins shuttle between the mitochondria and other organelles for intracellular communication [40] . Indeed, we found that the proteins of up-regulated functional modules tended to have multiple annotations of subcellular localization and to be involved in processes occurring inside and outside of mitochondria (Table S1 ). For example, AP-endonuclease 1 (APEX1) of the DNA repair module is known to shuttle from mitochondria to the nucleus in response to oxidative stress [41] . Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (HNRPK), a member of the ribonucleoprotein complex associated with mtDNA transcription, has been detected in the nucleus, cytoplasm, and mitochondria [42] . These observations suggest that up-regulated functional modules act as cross-talk components connecting mitochondria with other organelles to sense and propagate the We observed that up-regulated and down-regulated functional modules contain a small fraction of proteins with opposite protein expression patterns (Figure 3 ). On average, levels of 5.5% of the proteins in down-regulated functional modules were increased, while levels of 4.7% of the proteins in up-regulated functional modules were decreased under the dysfunctional r 0 state. Proteins with opposite expression patterns in the functional module could act as negative regulators of the module [43] . For example, in the TCA cycle module, acetolactate synthase (AHAS) was upregulated, while other proteins were down-regulated. It has been reported that upregulation of AHAS decreases the activity of the TCA cycle by reducing pyruvate flow into the cycle [44] . In addition, ATP6V1B2 and ATP6V1G1 in the ATP synthesis module were up-regulated, while other proteins were downregulated. Upregulation of these proteins is known to participate in ATP hydrolysis, leading to the downregulation of ATP synthesis [45] . Moreover, two heat shock proteins, HSP90AA1 and HSP90AB1, involved in protein folding on the mt surface were down-regulated, while other proteins were up-regulated. The heat shock proteins regulate chaperone activity in response to ATP concentrations in the cell [46] . Under the dysfunctional r 0 state, ATP reduction could induce the disruption of HSP90 chaperone activity. Thus, we suspect that oppositely expressed proteins may compensate for the function of other proteins in the same modules.",

This indicated that up-regulated proteins were successfully recruited into r 0 mitochondria. It has been proposed that there is a compensatory mt protein import pathway independent from the dissipated membrane potential [47] . This pathway is known to facilitate the translocations of proteins involved in mt protein folding and mtDNA repair to the mitochondria [48] . It implies that ''emergency'' proteins are increasingly imported to dysfunctional r 0 mitochondria to repair pathophysiological mt conditions. The cross-talk properties of up-regulated functional modules support this idea.",

The tested proteins, GLUD1, GTPBP3, ATP5A1, TFAM, and NDUFS6, were selected from each downregulated functional module. We found that the cytoplasmic protein levels of GLUD1 (amino acid metabolism), GTPBP3 (tRNA metabolism), and ATP5A1 (ATP synthesis) were increased, whereas the mitochondrial levels of those proteins were found to be decreased ( Figure S3 ), suggesting that those proteins remained in the cytoplasm and did not properly transport into mitochondria. Meanwhile, both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial protein levels of TFAM (mtDNA replication) and NDUFS6 (electron transport) were decreased ( Figure S3) . It might be possible that these proteins degraded more rapidly than synthesized in r 0 cell, consequently showed down-regulated protein expression levels.",

Analysis of mt protein functional networks elucidated the biological implications of mt regulatory mechanisms under dysfunctional mt states. Our efforts of systematic data-integrative analysis to evaluate the reliability of proteomics data and to identify important functional modules of mitochondrial proteins can be valuable to computational biology community working on gene expression and proteomics analysis. First, we applied a data-integrative approach to select protein list by using various databases, proteomics datasets, and protein functional network. Mitochondrial proteins were organized into functional modules to identify significantly altered biological processes under different cellular states. The framework of our systematic data-integrative analysis may be useful to reliable proteome analyses for other cellular systems. Second, organizing the thousand mitochondrial proteins into groups of up-or downregulated ones and identifying functional modules are necessary steps in getting an in-depth understanding of the complex molecular mechanism of mitochondria. Third, mapping both mitochondrial proteins and mRNA expression information together is critical to understand the cooperative expression regulation of mitochondrial functional modules. Such multidimensional data analysis can be a valuable asset to develop novel system level models and methods. Also, experimental biologists can utilize our dataset as a resource for target selection to elucidate regulatory mechanisms of mt proteins under dysfunctional mt states.",

Peptides were eluted with a linear gradient of 5-35% buffer B (running buffer A: 0.1% formic acid in H 2 O; elution buffer B: 0.1% formic acid in 100% acetonitrile) over 90 min at 200 nl/min using an Agilent 1100 capillary pump system. Eluting peptides from the column were analyzed using LTQ linear ion trap mass spectrometers (Thermo Finnigan, San Jose, CA). A MS survey scan from 300-2000 m/z was acquired with three mscans followed by three data-dependent MS/MS scans (isolation width, 1.5 m/z; normalized collision energy, 28%; dynamic exclusion lists, 100; dynamic exclusion duration, 3 min). Data from RAW MS/MS files (minimum ion counts, 15; minimum peak intensity threshold, 1; mass range, 600-4300 Da) were generated, and peptide sequences from the data were assigned against the International Protein Index (IPI) human database (Version 3.13; 57,034 proteins) including known contaminants (180 entries) by using a 4-node SEQUEST (version 27, revision 9) cluster with the following search parameters: specificity (no enzyme), number of missed cleavage (max three sites), cysteine mass (fixed, +227.13 for light cICAT), cysteine mass (variable, +9 for heavy cICAT), methionine mass (variable, +16 for oxidation), mass tolerance of precursor ion (3.0) and fragment ion (0.5), mass type of precursor and fragment ion (average mass), and subsequence (cysteine residue). To discriminate true proteins from false positives and to quantify the abundance of proteins, we used Trans-Proteomic Pipeline of Institute for Systems Biology (TPP; Version 1.7.2; INTERACT, PeptideProphet TM , ProteinProphet TM , XPRESS programs). The peptides with P$0.50 by PeptideProphet TM were applied to ProteinProphet TM . The proteins with P$0.95 by ProteinProphet TM were considered to have the correct identification. Single-and double-hit proteins of the correct identifications were further validated through manual inspections of MS/MS spectra (false positive rate, below 0.4%). Quantification of peptides and proteins was performed with XPRESS software, and the peptides with bad quality (e.g., below S/N#2) were not considered by quantification. Finally, we identified nuclear-encoded 1,121 mt proteins that included 313 down-regulated proteins (r 0 /r + #0.67), 201 up-regulated proteins (r 0 /r + $1.5), and 607 not significantly changed (0.67,r 0 / r + ,1.5) proteins. The thresholds of 0.67 represents the 1.5-fold decrease (r 0 /r + #1/1.5), whereas the threshold of 1.5 represents 1.5-fold increase (r 0 /r + $1.5). Protein abundance ratio smaller than 0.67 or larger than 1.5 were routinely-applied thresholds indicating significant changes in proteomic analyses [64, 65, 66, 67] . See Table S1 for further details on the list of identified mt proteins.",

The cDNAs of several candidate proteins were synthesized from the total RNA of r + cells by RT-PCR, sub-cloned into the T-easy vector (Promega), and then cloned into the N-terminus of the pEGFP-N3 vector (BD Bioscience). The resulting GFP-hybrid plasmids of pZCD1-EGFP, pGPT2-EGFP, pPYCR2-EGFP, pCTSD-EGFP, and pHSPBP1-EGFP were transfected using Superfect (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA) into DsRed2-mito-SK-Hep1 cells. At 48 h post-transfection, the transfected cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, mounted, and imaged using a confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss LSM 5). The mt localizations of candidate proteins were determined by the overlap of EGFP and DsRed signals. Figure S1 Workflow of comparative cICAT analysis of mitochondria proteomes.
