Illegal products of animal origin may contain hazardous infectious agents that can compromise animal and public health. The aim of this study was to identify associations between possession of illegal animal products in baggage and demographic characteristics of the passengers, as well as characteristics of their travel plans in the two main Brazilian international airports. A total of 457 passengers were divided into two groups: passengers identified as carrying illegal animal products and control. Passengers identified as carrying illegal animal products not stated on the accompanied baggage declaration completed a questionnaire, to aid in profiling. Nationality, origin, age and residency of passengers were analyzed using chi square, logistic regression and odds ratios. Passengers from Eastern Europe were the most likely to enter with animal products as were those aged between 35 and 55 years. When evaluating the departure point, the highest frequency was seen in those coming from Portugal. Passenger group, reasons for travel, amount and type of baggage were available only for passengers identified as carrying illegal animal products, noting that they prefer traveling alone, for leisure, bringing few bags. Such information can contribute to the early identification of passengers that have illegal animal products in baggage at Brazilian airports.",

This is because infectious agents can be transported in food of animal origin, especially those without health certificates and these can be detected in international baggage (Taniguchi et al. 2008 , Chaber et al. 2010 ) using X-ray scanners. Airborne, food-borne, vector-borne, and zoonotic infectious diseases transmitted during commercial air travel became an important public health issue due to the greater affordability of air travel, increasing the mobility of people (Mangili and Gendreau 2005) . To minimize the risk of these diseases entering a country, products of animal origin need to be accompanied by an international health certificate. This is crucial to assure a reliable health situation when countries with known health status are involved, as regulated by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) for its member countries (Pastoret and Chaisemartin 2011) .",

Intensive epidemiological work was carried out by researchers from various Brazilian and international institutions, involving a number of public authorities. Brazil declared an Animal Health Emergency and adopted immediate measures to contain and eradicate the disease, following recommendations of OIE. The owner of the farm was an officer stationed at Gale\u00e3o International Airport and he had collected leftovers from meals served on international flights to feed to his animals, including food from Portuguese and Spanish airlines. The direct and indirect costs of emergency actions reached US $ 13 million, including compensation for the loss of income from the slaughter of 66,902 pigs. Thus, emergency action also caused unemployment in 2,000 families who depended on pig farming in the region (Moura et al. 2010) .",

These diseases included: Classical Swine Fever in 1866, Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) in 1895 and Rinderpest in 1921. During this period, every 15 months a new disease or nosological agent entered Brazilian territory. This was compounded in the late 1970s, with the notification of 27 new diseases, including African Swine Fever. It is believed that this growing trend occurred due to the greater vigilance by the veterinary services that were structured in most states during this period and the consequent increase in health surveillance (Moura et al., 2010) .",

To get an idea of the scale of the increase in movement during the FIFA World Cup, between June and July 2014 the National Civil Aviation Agency has authorized Brazilian airlines to operate 1,973 new flights in this short period, and authorized changes in approximately 80,000 existing flights.

The area under the ROC curve was 0.6970, showing the importance of this factor. This large amount of passengers arriving from Latin Europe can be explained by the fact that countries making up this area (Spain, France, Italy, Portugal) have close historical links with Brazil and several countries in South America. This also includes passengers who begin a trip in Europe, but, after arriving in Brazil, they may travel on to other countries of South America, using Brazil as a stopover. There was a higher frequency of passengers identified as carrying illegal animal products from Latin Europe but analyzing countries individually, Argentina was the most frequent. The fact that most passengers identified as carrying illegal animal products took the plane to Brazil from Portugal and Argentina is understandable if one analyses Brazil's relationship with these countries.
