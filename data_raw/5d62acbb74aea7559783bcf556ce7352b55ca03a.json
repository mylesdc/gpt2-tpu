            "text": "Background: Enteric diseases are an important health problem for the intensive poultry industry, resulting in considerable economic losses. Apart from such microbiological agents associated with enteritis as bacteria and parasites, a lot of research has been recently conducted on viral origin of enteric diseases. However, enteric viruses have been identified in intestinal tract of not only diseased but also healthy poultry, so their role in enteritis is still unclear. The present study aimed at determination of the prevalence of four enteric viruses, namely astrovirus, coronavirus, parvovirus and rotavirus in meat-type turkey flocks in Poland as well as at statistical evaluation of the occurrence of the studied viruses and their relationships with the health status and the age of birds. Two hundred and seven flocks of birds aged 1-20 weeks originating from different regions of the country were investigated between 2008 and 2011. Clinical samples (10 individual faecal swabs/flock) were duly processed and examined using molecular methods targeting the conservative regions of viral genomes: RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene of astrovirus, non-structural 1 gene of parvovirus, non-structural protein 4 gene of rotavirus, and 5\u2032 untranslated region fragment of turkey coronavirus. Different statistical methods (i.e. the independence chi-square test, the correspondence analysis and the logistic regression model) were used to establish any relationships between the analyzed data. Results: Overall, 137 (66.2%, 95% CI: 59.3-72.6) of the 207 turkey flocks sampled were infected with one or more enteric viruses. Among the 137 flocks, 74 (54%, 95% CI: 45.3-62.6) were positive for one virus, whereas 54 (39.4%, 9 5% CI: 31.2-48.1) and 9 (6.6%, 95% CI: 3.1-12.1) were co-infected with two or three different enteric viruses, respectively. No flock was simultaneously infected with all four viruses studied. The prevalence of astrovirus infection was 44.9% (95% CI: 38.0-52.0), parvovirus 27.5% (95% CI: 21.6-34.2), rotavirus 18.8% (95% CI: 13.8-24.8), and coronavirus 9.7% (95% CI: 6.0-14.5). Young turkeys aged 1-4 weeks old had the highest (82.1%, 95% CI:71.7-89.8) prevalence of viral infection. Applied statistical methods have indicated the dependence of rotavirus infection as well as the co-infection with multiple viruses and the health status of turkeys. Furthermore, our results statistically confirm that especially young birds are susceptible to infection with rotavirus and astrovirus. Conclusions: The study demonstrated the presence of astrovirus, coronavirus, parvovirus and rotavirus infections in Polish turkey farms. These viruses were detected in both healthy and diseased birds. However, the presented results provide valuable feedback which could help to evaluate the role of some enteric viruses in the etiology of enteritis in turkey.",

            "text": "Enteric diseases are an important health problem for the intensive poultry industry and can result in considerable economic losses. The most characteristic of these conditions are diarrhea, stunting, huddling, increased feed conversion and extended time-to-market. In the more severe forms, immune dysfunction and increased mortality may occur. Different terms have been used to describe enteric disease syndrome in turkey: poult enteritis complex (PEC) and poult enteritis mortality syndrome (PEMS) or light turkey syndrome (LTS) [1] [2] [3] . However, none of these descriptions relate to any specific agents, and numerous factors have been associated with them, including environmental, such as housing, ventilation, temperature and humidity; management, such as biosecurity programmes; and microbiological agents (viruses, bacteria and parasites). In recent years there has been a lot of research regarding the viral origin of enteric diseases, and different viruses, such as astrovirus, coronavirus, reovirus, rotavirus, parvovirus, and adenovirus have been identified in intestinal tract of not only diseased but also healthy poultry. The role of some viruses in enteritis is well-defined, i.e. coronavirus is a known factor of mud fever/bluecomb disease of turkeys [4] . However, the clinical and epidemiological significance of turkey infection with most of them still remains unclear. It seems that viruses are present in large amounts and different combinations in bird intestines, but in optimal nutritional and environmental conditions they do not cause clinical disease. In favorable conditions, such as feed change, sudden temperature shift or other stress factors, the viruses present in the gut might damage its walls making birds more susceptible to secondary bacterial infection. Furthermore, it is also possible that enteric viruses could contribute to the development of symptoms only by co-infections with multiple viruses. For a better understanding and control of enteric disease in turkeys, more studies on enteric viruses are needed.",

In spite these viruses were detected both in diseased and healthy birds, they were recently regarded as those which are mainly responsible for enteritis in turkeys. Presence of astroviruses, irrespective of their affiliation to virus type was identified by using RT-PCR aimed at RNA dependent RNA polymerase gene fragment according to the protocol described by Tang et al. [6] . This method enables detection of both turkey astrovirus type 1 (TAstV-1) and type 2 (TAstV-2) as well as avian nephritis virus (ANV). Detection of CoV was performed in real-time RT-PCR aimed at 5\u2032 untranslated region (5'UTR) fragment present in gammacoronaviruses of poultry i.e. turkey coronavirus and infectious bronchitis virus [7] . For parvovirus detection, primers which enable the amplification of non structural 1 (NS1) of Aveparvovirus gene were used [8] . For RoV identification the method according to Day et al. was applied [9] . This method enable the amplification of highly conserved non-structural protein 4 (NSP4) gene region which was believed not group specific. But next studies revealed that NSP4 gene of avian D, F and G rotavirus groups are only distantly related to that of avian group A so it seems that applied method is useful only for this group of rotavirus [10] . Details on primers sequences, annealing temperatures and sizes of expected amplicons are presented in the Table 1 . Tests were performed using Qiagen One-Step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen, Germany) for RT-PCR, OptiTaq DNA Polymerase Kit (EURx, Poland) for PCR and QuantiTect Probe RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen, Germany) for real time RT-PCR. The above tests were conducted in a 2720 Thermal Cycler or 7500 Real Time PCR System for conventional or real time amplifications, respectively (both Applied Biosystems, USA). The details on reaction mixtures and the protocols of applied assays are available on request.",

To compare the quantitative correlation between age, health status as well as the number of identified viruses in all groups of birds, the Kruskal-Wallis test was used. In turn, the Mann-Whitney test was used to correlate the age of infected and uninfected birds. The interactions between qualitative variables, i.e. the age (categorized in groups) or health condition of the tested flocks and the prevalence of the studied viruses, as well as correlations between the incidences of the investigated pathogens, were also examined. These variables were summarized in the contingency tables which were examined by the independence chi-square (\u03c7 2 ) statistical test. The statistical methods which inform about the strength of the relationship between qualitative variables were then applied. Consequently, we calculated the Yule coefficients. However, these tests do not describe the nature of the relationships, and thus we applied the correspondence analysis (CA) to this end. The CA is the method of displaying the relationships between categorical variables as scatterplot diagrams; they are, however, not shown here, and only the conclusions from the obtained diagrams are discussed. We also implemented logistic regression (LR) model, which is also helpful in description of the strength and nature of the relationship between the variables. In the LR model, a dichotomous scale is used, so the health status of flocks has been rearranged as healthy or sick (PEC/PEMS) animals. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated and the differences with P < 0.05 were considered as significant. Data analysis was performed using STATISTICA ver. 10 (StatSoft, Inc., 2011Dell Software, Aliso Viejo, CA, USA).",

As the role of these viruses in the development of enteritis is still unclear, statistical analysis was also applied in an attempt to better understand the influence of these viruses on the health status of studied turkey flocks. All applied statistical analyses confirmed the common knowledge that the older the turkeys are, the healthier they are. The intestines during the first weeks of bird's life (up to 2-3 week) are in a phase of morphological, biochemical, immunological and molecular maturation and during this time they are concomitantly exposed to a variety of factors [11] . They contain their own microbial communities which are initially influenced by the breeder, but later also by environment [12] . The health status of intestines depends on maintaining the balance of all components of the turkey gut and environmental factors. Any disturbances in this balance may cause enteritis. Clinical signs of enteritis in turkey aged 1-4 weeks are most probably due to the disturbance of this delicate balance between various factors in immature intestines.",

Among the studied viruses, the most frequently detected in both healthy as well as in enteric turkeys was AstV, accounting for 28.9% and 47.2%, respectively. Our previous studies on Polish turkey flocks also revealed the presence of turkey astroviruses, independently of detected types (TAstV-1, TAstV-2 or ANV), in both turkeys experiencing enteritis as well as in clinically healthy birds [13] . Previously applied statistical methods indicated a weak correlation between astrovirus incidence and the health status, with calculated coefficients between combined TAstV-1 and TAstV-2 presence or TAstV-2 presence and the health status equal to 0.14 and 0.1, respectively [13] . However, rank Spearman correlation used at that time seems to be not fully appropriate for qualitative variables. Thus in this study we have applied other methods, more useful for such kind of analysis. None of them indicated any correlation between AstVs prevalence and turkey health status. There are many reports of astrovirus presence in turkeys, with the prevalence varying from about 24 to 100% depending on the methods used for virus detection and the country; however, according to our knowledge, none of them specifically explored the impact of astroviruses on the health of turkeys. The surveys of commercial turkeys conducted in the USA revealed that 47.2 and 100% of the analyzed samples were astrovirus-positive [14] . The majority of detected astroviruses belonged to TAstV-2 and their level ranged from 69.6 to 71.8%. The occurrence of TAstV-1 and ANV was less frequent, accounting for 9.8-28.1% and 2.7 -12.5%, respectively, but all of these turkey astrovirus types were detected irrespectively of the turkey health status [14] . Brazilian studies also revealed a high prevalence of astroviruses in turkey flocks ranging from 44% to 81.6% [15, 16] . The share of individual astrovirus types was different than in the USA, but no clear influence on the health status was suggested. Cattoli et al. reported TAstV in Italian and Spanish turkey farms with enteritis [17] . On the other hand, Jindal et al. reported TAstV-2 in apparently healthy breeder turkey poults by RT-PCR; 47.2% of pooled fecal samples were positive [18] . Recently, TAstV-2, TAstV-1 and ANV were detected in 50%, 20% and 13.8% of market-age turkeys with lower weight but also in 33%, 20% and 12.5% of turkeys with standard breed character, respectively [3, 19] . Moreover, the same author found TAstV-2 in fecal swabs of both experimentally infected and PBS-inoculated turkeys [3] . In several reports the existence of two turkey astrovirus pathotypes were suspected: pathogenic and non-pathogenic [19, 20] . Presented results of applied statistical methods do not exclude the existence of such pathotypes, but it seems that the frequency of pathogenic astrovirus strains occurrence is rather low.",

            "text": "The overall observed frequency of RoV detection was 20.8%, but its prevalence was different in regards to health status of studied turkeys: in enteric flocks (21.1%) it was above fourfold higher than in healthy ones (4.7%). All three applied different statistical methods have indicated the correlation between rotavirus prevalence and turkey health status. Calculated odds of disease symptoms in turkeys infected with RoV, depending on the methods used, were from five-to almost sevenfold higher than the occurrence of these symptoms in the uninfected group. Rotaviruses are a major cause of acute enteritis in young children and in several mammalian and avian species [25] [26] [27] . However, the impact of RoV on the health of turkeys is ambiguous, as its presence was reported in healthy as well as in enteric birds. Periodic monitoring of eight turkey flocks in North Carolina revealed the presence of rotaviruses in 69.7% of all tested samples during the whole production cycle. Moreover, RoVs were also detected in poults at the hatchery and vertical transmission was suggested as the reason of such detection. Interestingly, all studied flocks were described as healthy and normally performing by field personnel, but compared to the turkeys raised in experimental conditions they had significantly lower body weight and worse feed conversion rate [1] . The monitoring of enteric turkeys in Minnesota showed the presence of RoV in 48.3-93% of tested flocks [28, 29] . In subsequent studies by the above authors, the monitoring of five flocks of apparently healthy breeder turkeys over the period of 9 weeks revealed RoV presence with maximum occurrence until 5 weeks of age [18] . In a Brazilian study, rotavirus infections were identified in 52.6% of surveyed turkey farms; its prevalence in enteric and healthy flocks was 57.8% and 39.3%, respectively [16] . The presence of RoV in 18.8% of Polish diseased and healthy turkey flocks has also been previously reported [30] . It should be stressed that in all abovementioned studies the same protocol was used for RV detection as in present study [9] . The possible reason for the observed ambiguous impact of rotavirus infection on enteritis is the circulation of virus strains that differ in pathogenicity. Although our previous studies reported only several amino acid changes in NSP4 both in strains identified in enteric and healthy turkeys, the biological characteristics of RoVs, such as the replication ability, virulence and pathogenicity, are determined by a combination of many genes, such as VP4, VP7, VP3, NSP1, NSP2, and NSP4 gene [31] . Thus in order to get more insight into the pathogenicity as well as to establish a definite classification of detected rotavirus strain, the complete genome sequence should be characterized.",

They were detected in 6.7% of healthy flocks and 9.2% of flocks with clinical signs of enteritis. Generally, TCoV is directly connected with enteritis [4] . The virus was responsible for enormous losses in turkey production in Minnesota in the early 1970s and then for several outbreaks in multiple states in the United States since the 1990s [32, 33] . Maurel et al. reported that 37% of intestinal samples from diseased turkey flocks in France were TCoV-positive [34] . Villareal et al. demonstrated the presence of TCoV in 82.4% of studied diseased turkey flocks, but also in one apparently normal [15] . In another study from Brazil, TCoVs were detected in 71.1% and 28.6% of enteric and healthy flocks, respectively [16] . The lack of clinical signs of enteritis in spite of detected infection with turkey coronavirus may be interpreted in a few ways. Firstly, the sampling timecompilation of the results when the sampling was performed in the early stages of infection before the onset of clinical symptoms of the disease or at a later stage when clinical symptoms can be observed in the presence of the virus below its detection limit will lead to doubtfulness. Secondly, the existence of turkey coronaviruses with various pathogenicity. In addition, the severity of the disease could be influenced by other zoohygenic or infectious factors.",

We also found the correlation between AstV and RoV and the age of turkeys in studied flocks pointing at young birds as more susceptible to infection with these viruses.

The dependence between rotavirus infection and the health status of turkeys was found. The occurrence of TAstV, TuPV and TCoV had no statistical effect on the development of clinical signs of enteritis. Additionally, our results suggest that infection with two or three viruses also has an effect on the health of turkeys, which is in line with recent observations, so far statistically unsupported, suggesting that viral co-infections may be relevant in the onset and the severity of enteric disease [16, 18] . Final determination of the role of these viruses could be clarified in experimental conditions using SPF or commercial turkeys. However, in order to do this, the virus should be available as propagated on embryos/cell lines, which however currently has not been achieved.",
