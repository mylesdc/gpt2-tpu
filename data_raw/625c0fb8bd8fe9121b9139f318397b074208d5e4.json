Our primary hypotheses were that RV-C target ciliated airway epithelial cells (AECs), and that cell specificity is determined by restricted and high expression of the only known RV-C cell-entry factor, cadherin related family member 3 (CDHR3). Methods: RV-C15 (C15) infection in differentiated human bronchial epithelial cell (HBEC) cultures was assessed using immunofluorescent and time-lapse epifluorescent imaging. Morphology of C15-infected differentiated AECs was assessed by immunohistochemistry. Results: C15 produced a scattered pattern of infection, and infected cells were shed from the epithelium. The percentage of cells infected with C15 varied from 1.4 to 14.7% depending on cell culture conditions. Infected cells had increased staining for markers of ciliated cells (acetylated-alpha-tubulin [aat], p < 0.001) but not markers of goblet cells (wheat germ agglutinin or Muc5AC, p = ns). CDHR3 expression was increased on ciliated epithelial cells, but not other epithelial cells (p < 0.01). C15 infection caused a 27.4% reduction of ciliated cells expressing CDHR3 (p < 0.01). During differentiation of AECs, CDHR3 expression progressively increased and correlated with both RV-C binding and replication.",

            "text": "Non-influenza viral respiratory illnesses cost the US an estimated $39.5 billion annually from both healthcare costs and loss of productivity [1] . Rhinovirus (RV) is the most common cause of viral upper respiratory illness resulting in rhinitis, sinusitis, pharyngitis, or otitis media, and can lead to the development of bacterial superinfections [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . While most individuals only experience mild symptoms during a RV infection, children, the elderly, the immunosuppressed, and those with asthma, COPD, or cystic fibrosis are predisposed to lower respiratory tract illnesses including wheezing, asthma exacerbations, and respiratory distress that can often result in hospitalization [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . RV has also been implicated in the initiation of asthma, as the presence of wheeze during acute RV infection in the first few years of life is strongly correlated with the development of asthma later in life [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . Three RV species (A, B and C) have been identified, and recent studies have established a link between RV species and illness severity [14, 20] . The RV-C, discovered in 2006, appear to instigate more severe upper and lower respiratory tract symptoms in infants and children under 5 years of age [14, 20] . In an effort to explain this phenomenon, Nakagome et al. inoculated airway epithelial cells with multiple members of each RV species, and observed the highest levels of viral replication, cytotoxicity, and release of inflammatory cytokines following inoculation with either RV-A or C [21] .",

Consider, for example, that cellular retargeting of avian influenza virus in human tissue from ciliated to secretory cells is necessary to produce severe and clinically apparent disease, and also that a broadening of the human coronavirus tropism to alveolar pneumocytes contributed to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome pandemics [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . For RVs, the cellular targets of the RV-A and B have been studied with varying results [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] . RV-B14 replication and expression of the major group RV receptor ICAM-1 have been identified in non-ciliated cells derived from the palatine tonsils, and high levels of RV-A16 (A16) replication were noted in cultures with mucus cell metaplasia, which can occur in asthma or COPD [31, 32, 34] . Significant ICAM-1 expression and A16 binding were also observed on basal epithelial cells [33, 36] . More recently, Jakiela et al. contradicted previous studies by identifying ciliated cells as the primary target for A16, and further indicated mucus cell metaplasia as a protective factor against A16 infection [34, 35] . Regarding the RV-C, Bochkov et al. demonstrated the presence of viral RNA in sinus mucosal tissue organ cultures, and subsequently identified cadherin-related family member 3 (CDHR3) as the first and only known RV-C entry factor. However, the specific host cell for the RV-C remains unknown [37, 38] .",

Analysis of cells stained with WGA further confirmed that secretory cells were not infected with C15 (p = ns, Fig. 4b ).",

Preliminary experiments revealed that cells cultured using a different HBEC culture medium (PneumaCult\u2122, Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, Canada) had more plentiful ciliated cells [43] . We hypothesized that the greater differentiation of ciliated cells achieved using PneumaCult\u2122 media (PCM) would lead to greater susceptibility to RV-C infection. Thus, we inoculated HBEC-ALI cultures for 18 h with either C15 or BEGM alone, and then analyzed single cell suspensions for markers of epithelial cell subsets and C15 infection (Fig. 5) . When compared to BEGM-differentiated cultures, the proportion of ciliated cells was lower in PCM-differentiated cultures (p \u2264 0.001, Additional file 2: Figure S1A ). However, C15 staining was observed in 6.2 to 14.7% of HBECs differentiated in PCM, which represented a 5-10-fold increased frequency of infected cells compared to cells differentiated in BEGM (Fig. 5a) . Interestingly, following C15 inoculation the proportion of ciliated cells was 13.0% greater compared to mock-inoculated cultures (p \u2264 0.01, Additional file 2: Figure S1B ). Again, C15 replicated only in ciliated cells (p < 0.001, Fig. 5a) , as there was no significant C15+ staining of non-ciliated cells or Muc5AC+ cells compared to mock-inoculated cells (p = ns, Fig. 5b ).",

            "text": "We recently demonstrated that surface expression of cadherin-related family member 3 (CDHR3) enabled RV-C entry into normally non-permissive HeLa cells followed by viral replication [38] . Replication of C15 in ciliated cells suggested that CDHR3 expression might be restricted to these cells. To test this hypothesis, we inoculated differentiated HBECs with either C15 or medium alone and stained cells for cilia, C15, and CDHR3 (Fig. 6) . In mock infected cultures, the staining of CDHR3 was 2.87-times brighter on ciliated cells compared to nonciliated cells (p \u2264 0.01, Fig. 6a) . Furthermore, C15 inoculation reduced CDHR3-positive staining on ciliated cells from 80.8% to 53.4% (p \u2264 0.01, Fig. 6b) . Similarly, C15 inoculation reduced the intensity of CDHR3 staining of ciliated cells by about one third (Fig. 6c) . To test this hypothesis, we cultured 8 HBEC-ALI cultures in PCM to allow differentiation over a 28-day time period and monitored CDHR3 mRNA and protein expression at weekly intervals. In addition, each week, aliquots of differentiating cells were inoculated with C15 (2x10 6 PFU equivalents) and cell lysates were collected at 2 and 24 h post inoculation (hpi) to test for C15 binding and replication, respectively. Cellular expression of CDHR3 mRNA and protein in differentiating HBECs increased through day 28 ( Fig. 7a-b) . Congruently, C15 binding and replication titers increased over time in the differentiating human BECs (Fig. 7c) . CDHR3 mRNA expression strongly correlated with C15 binding (r = +0.77, Fig. 7d ) and C15 replication (r = +0.96, Fig. 7e ). The largest increase in CDHR3 mRNA expression was observed from day 7 to day 14, which corresponded with large increases in C15 binding and replication. virus, and RV-A), and infections thereof have been correlated to viral receptor expression [22, 27, 28, 35, [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] . CDHR3 genotype was initially linked to the risk of childhood asthma with acute severe exacerbations, and subsequent studies showed that transfection of HeLa cells with CDHR3 rendered the cells permissive for RV-C binding and replication [50] . Furthermore, the asthma-risk genotype of CDHR3 conferred increased RV-C binding and replication [38] . Our data extend observations into primary AEC, and demonstrate that CDHR3 expression was high and largely restricted to ciliated cells. Notably, RV-C does not infect secretory cells, which can be overrepresented in chronically inflamed airways [35, 51] . These findings were consistent for cells differentiated in two different culture media (BEGM and PCM). We found that BEGM-cultures have larger proportions of ciliated cells, but only a small fraction of these cells could be infected with RV-C. Cultures differentiated in PCM had fewer ciliated cells, together with an increased representation of other differentiated cell types (goblet, clara, basal, etc.), more closely mimicking airway biology [43] . A larger fraction of ciliated cells cultured in PCM could be infected with RV-C, however, the majority of ciliated cells were not infected in either culture system, despite an excess of virus. This finding may indicate the presence of unidentified cofactors or specific cellular properties required for RV-C binding or entry. Many viruses either utilize co-receptors or have cofactors that facilitate cellular binding. Poliovirus, for example, utilizes bacterial polysaccharides to increase the kinetics of binding to its host cells in the gut [52, 53] . Alternately, some cells may be protected from RV-C infection by overlying mucus, or perhaps CDHR3 exposure to RV-C is reduced by sequestration to lateral membranes (a common location for intracellular cadherins) [54] . RV-C infection led to changes in cell composition, including a reduction in CDHR3 expression and increased percentage of ciliated cells. The reduction in CDHR3 staining could be due to viral shutoff of host protein synthesis, CDHR3 down-regulation following internalization of the virus/receptor complex, or lysis of infected cells. The apparent increase in ciliated cells following C15-inoculation may occur through infection-induced differentiation from basal cells, or perhaps through Fig. 7 CDHR3 expression in differentiating bronchial epithelial cells positively correlates with RV-C binding and replication. a CDHR3 protein expression (~100 kDa) and b mRNA expression (n = 8) by differentiating airway epithelial cells in ALI using PCM from day 1 to day 28. c BECs in ALI were infected weekly with C15 and the infected cell samples were collected and analyzed for viral binding (2 hpi) and viral yield (24 hpi). d and e Correlations (linear regression) between cellular CDHR3 mRNA expression and C15 binding and yield transdifferentiation of goblet or clara cells to ciliated cells, a concept proposed in previous studies of airway epithelia and infection [55] .",

For example, A16 has been shown to primarily target ciliated cells, even though ICAM-1 is also expressed on some nonciliated cells [35] . Notably, virus-sized (40 nm) nanoparticles adhere to motile cilia in vitro, demonstrating a potential nonspecific mechanism for viral adhesion to ciliated cells [56] . These findings raise the possibility that RV may adhere to cilia to facilitate cell entry, and this is consistent with our observations that cilia of infected cells stained positive for C15 (Fig. 3a) .",

The shedding of infected cells, perhaps before the virus is able to spread to surrounding cells, could contribute to the patchy distribution of infection. The resulting gaps in the epithelium would likely impair barrier function and perhaps facilitate bacterial superinfection [2, 4, 5, 7] . These effects have been noted following influenza A infections in vitro [57] . It will be of interest in future studies to determine whether CDHR3 genotype or disease states influence patterns of CDHR3 expression and RV-C infection.",

Scale bars indicate 20 \u03bcmDiscussionSince their discovery in 2006, the RV-C have been identified as important contributors to severe respiratory illness in infants and exacerbations of chronic airway disease, yet little is known about how they interact with airway cells. Here, we demonstrated that among epithelial cells, CDHR3 protein expression in ALI cells is developmentally regulated and largely confined to ciliated cells. Several techniques were used to show that RV-C replicate in ciliated AECs, but not secretory cells. Finally, during the differentiation process, RV-C binding and especially replication were closely correlated to temporal patterns of CDHR3 induction. These findings show evidence of a close relationship between ciliated epithelial cells, CDHR3 expression, and susceptibility to RV-C infection.Ciliated AECs are targets for multiple RNA viruses (e.g. avian influenza virus, coronavirus, RSV, parainfluenza a b Immunohistochemical analysis of C15 infectivity in HBEC-ALI cultures.
