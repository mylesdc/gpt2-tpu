There are more than 150 antigenically heterogeneous HRV serotypes, with \u223c90 HRVs belonging to major group species A and B. Development of small animal models that are susceptible to infection with major group HRVs would be beneficial for vaccine research. Previously, we showed that the cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus) is semi-permissive to HRV16 (major group, species HRV-A virus) infection, replicating in the upper and lower respiratory tracts with measurable pathology, mucus production, and expression of inflammatory mediators. Herein, we report that intranasal infection of cotton rats with HRV14 (major group, species HRV-B virus) results in isolation of infectious virus from the nose and lung. Similar to HRV16, intramuscular immunization with live HRV14 induces homologous protection that correlated with high levels of serum neutralizing antibodies. Vaccination and challenge experiments with HRV14 and HRV16 to evaluate the development of cross-protective immunity demonstrate that intramuscular immunization with live HRV16 significantly protects animals against HRV14 challenge. Determination of the immunological mechanisms involved in heterologous protection and further characterization of infection with other major HRV serotypes in the cotton rat could enhance the robustness of the model to define heterotypic relationships between this diverse group of viruses and thereby increase its potential for development of a multi-serotype HRV vaccine.",

In addition, HRV infections have been associated with exacerbation episodes in asthmatic and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients (Nicholson et al., 1993; Johnston et al., 1995; Rakes et al., 1999; Papi et al., 2006) .

            "text": "Nearly 60 years after their isolation, there are no approved antiviral therapies for the prevention or treatment of HRV infections (Jacobs et al., 2013) . Currently, three genetically distinct groups, HRV-A, -B, and -C, have been characterized on the basis of genomic structure (Savolainen et al., 2002; Lau et al., 2007; Palmenberg et al., 2009; Simmonds et al., 2010; Bochkov et al., 2011) . Seventy-five serotypes of HRV-A and 25 serotypes of HRV-B are antigenically distinct viruses based on cross-neutralization properties in vitro (Kapikian et al., 1967; Hamparian et al., 1987) . Based on competition for cellular binding sites, two different groups of HRVs using non-identical receptors for cell attachment were defined. Approximately 10 minor group serotypes (1A, 1B, 2, 29, 30, 31, 44, 47, 49, and 62) use the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) as the receptor for cell entry (Hofer et al., 1994; Marlovits et al., 1998) , while >90% of major group serotypes, including HRV16 (species HRV-A) and HRV14 (species HRV-B), utilize intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) receptor (Greve et al., 1989) . Some major group HRVs also use heparin sulfate as an additional receptor (Vlasak et al., 2005) . The HRV-C group of viruses does not infect conventional cell lines used for virus propagation (i.e., HeLa or embryonic fibroblasts). Recently, Cadherin-related family member 3 was characterized as the receptor for the HRV-C and HRV-C15 was propagated using reverse genetics facilitating the isolation of HRV-C strains (Bochkov et al., 2011 (Bochkov et al., , 2015 . In addition, HRV-C viruses have been shown to grow in sinus mucosal tissue or differentiated sinus epithelial cells (Bochkov et al., 2011; Ashraf et al., 2013) . Efforts at vaccine development have been hindered because there are more than 150 HRV serotypes with extensive antigenic heterogeneity and broad circulation (Savolainen et al., 2002; Lau et al., 2007; Palmenberg et al., 2009; Simmonds et al., 2010; Bochkov et al., 2011) . An experimental animal model that is susceptible to different HRV serotypes would be pivotal to evaluate the degree of crossprotection in vivo, to delineate anti-HRV vaccine strategies, or to conduct preclinical studies of antiviral compounds. Since 2008, multiple studies have evaluated a mouse model for rhinovirus-induced disease and exacerbation of allergic airway inflammation (Bartlett et al., 2008; McLean et al., 2012; Glanville et al., 2013) . Using minor group HRV1B serotype, Bartlett et al. (2008) demonstrated that infection in BALB/c mouse is localized in the lungs and induces strong airway and pulmonary inflammation and mucin production, albeit accompanied by low viral replication. In addition, a model for major group HRV16 serotype infection was also reported by using transgenic mice expressing a human/mouse ICAM-1 chimeric receptor (Bartlett et al., 2008) . This model showed a strong inflammatory response to infection with low levels of viral replication similar to HRV1B in BALB/c mice. However, use of a transgenic mouse for infection with \u223c90 major group viruses for in vivo cross-protection studies could become challenging. Therefore, development of an alternative small animal model that is susceptible to infection by major group HRVs would be a step forward to vaccine development.",

The cotton rat is an animal model frequently used to study infections by many respiratory viral pathogens that affect human health, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (Boukhvalova and Blanco, 2013) , influenza (Ottolini et al., 2005; Blanco et al., 2013) , measles (Wyde et al., 1992; Pfeuffer et al., 2003) , and the recently re-emerging Enterovirus-D68 (EV-D68) (Patel et al., 2016) . We have previously demonstrated that intramuscular (i.m.) immunization of cotton rats with live HRV16 generates protective immunity that correlates with high levels of serum neutralizing antibodies (NA), which protect vaccinated animals as well as litters born to vaccinated females against HRV16 challenge. In addition, passive prophylactic treatment with hyperimmune anti-HRV16 serum protects na\u00efve animals against i.n. challenge with HRV16 (Blanco et al., 2014) . These results suggest that the cotton rat could become a useful model for testing vaccines and prophylactic therapies against major group of HRV infection.",

We have demonstrated that i.m. immunization of cotton rats with live HRV14 or HRV16 serotypes generates strong NA responses against homologous virus (Figure 2 ; Blanco et al., 2014) . Groups of na\u00efve cotton rats, cotton rats immunized and boosted i.m.

Five animals in each group were euthanized 8 h p.i. to determine lung viral titers ( Figure 3A) . Consistent with our previous data, animals vaccinated i.m. with live HRV16 virus were strongly protected against homologous HRV16 challenge, by reducing the lung viral titers by at least 3 Log 10 ( Figure 3B ; Blanco et al., 2014) . Importantly, live HRV14 i.m. immunization also strongly protected animals challenged with a homologous HRV14 infection, by reducing the lung viral titers by more than 3.5 Log 10 ( Figure 3C) . Immunization with either UV-HRV16 or UV-HRV14 did not render protection to either HRV16 or HRV14 challenge, respectively (Figures 3B,C) . When the generation of cross immunity was analyzed by cross-challenge experiments, cotton rats immunized i.m. with live HRV14 did not show heterologous protection against HRV16 challenge at the level of pulmonary viral replication ( Figure 3B) . However, i.m. vaccination with HRV16 partially protected animals against heterologous HRV14 challenge. Importantly, cotton rat vaccinated with live HRV16 i.m. and infected with HRV14 had \u223c1.5 Log 10 lower load of HRV14 in the lungs compared to na\u00efve HRV14 infected animals, suggesting induction of detectable cross-protective immunity ( Figure 3C ).",

Here we show that cotton rats are susceptible to infection by another member of the major group, HRV14, with detectable replication in the URT and lower respiratory tract (LRT). The replication cycle of HRV14 is short-lived in nose and lung tissues of cotton rats. However, infectious virus titers in nose and lung tissues were measureable until 24 h p.i., which permits evaluation of vaccine efficacy or immunization strategy. We recently reported that EV-D68, another Picornavirus biologically similar to HRVs, also exhibited a similar replication cycle in cotton rats (Oberste et al., 2004; Patel et al., 2016) . In contrast, other human respiratory viruses, e.g., RSV, and to a lesser extent, influenza virus, show extended replication (1-4 days p.i.) in nose and lung tissues of cotton rats (Ottolini et al., 2005; Blanco et al., 2013; Boukhvalova and Blanco, 2013) . We believe that this shorter replication cycle of HRV may represent a hallmark of Picornaviruses in the respiratory tract of cotton rats and may be the result of differential tropism, interferon susceptibility, and/or receptor availability for this group of viruses.",

HRV16 infection induced mild, however, significant alveolitis, bronchiolitis and perivasculitis over 1-3 days p.i.

Infection and re-infection with HRV14 also resulted in induction of moderate NA in some animals; however, the induced NA titers were widely variable within the group compared to the i.m. HRV14-immunized group. Previously, we observed that a single i.n. infection with HRV16 did not induce a detectable NA response (Blanco et al., 2014) . Similarly, it was shown in the mouse models that two or more HRV infections were necessary to generate detectable NA (McLean et al., 2012) . As demonstrated by the lack of immune response generated by UV-inactivated viruses, viral replication seems to be an important component in the generation of NA in cotton rats (Blanco et al., 2014 ; Figure 2) . It is possible that HRV14 or HRV16 replicate better in the lymph node draining from i.m. site of inoculation than from those draining from the respiratory mucosa. This is in agreement with our observations with EV-D68 that replicates in draining lymph nodes near the site of i.m. injection (Patel et al., 2016) , possibly explaining the reason of higher NA response by i.m. inoculation compared to i.n. infection.",

Experimental and natural infections in humans induce NA, which provide some protection against re-infection with the homologous HRV serotype (Barclay et al., 1989; Alper et al., 1996) . Inactivated virus vaccinations given i.n. or i.m. in humans similarly induced NA and provided protection against disease caused by the homologous HRV serotype (Doggett et al., 1963; Mitchison, 1965; Perkins et al., 1969; Buscho et al., 1972; Hamory et al., 1975) . We show here that live HRV14 or HRV16, used as immunogen and administered i.m., induce high levels of protective homologous NA that correlated with the ability of each of these viruses to undergo detectable replication in the nose and lung of i.n. infected cotton rats (Blanco et al., 2014) . However, cotton rats immunized with minor group serotype HRV1B (that use LDL as a receptor) following identical vaccination schedule, neither generated NA nor replicated efficiently in the URT or LRT of these animals (Blanco et al., 2014) . Additionally, HRV1B-immunized animals failed to render any protection FIGURE 3 | Homologous and heterologous HRV protection measured in vivo. (A) Scheme of immunization, serum collection, and challenge for this experiment. Animals were either unimmunized (na\u00efve), immunized i.m. with UV-HRV14 or UV-HRV16, or immunized i.m. with live HRV14 or HRV16 (10 6 PFU/100 \u00b5l). Three weeks after the initial immunization, animals were boosted with the same immunogen as indicated. At week 7, half of the animals in each group were challenged i.n. with HRV14 (10 6 PFU/100 \u00b5l) and half with HRV16 (10 7 PFU/100 \u00b5l), and all were euthanized 8 h later to determine lung viral titers. Lung viral titers following (B) HRV16 and (C) HRV14 infection are shown. n = 5 animals/group, data representative of two independent experiments. All data differences between different immunization groups with same infection were assessed by one-way ANOVA and individual differences were identified by Bonferroni post hoc test. (D) Homologous and heterologous serum NA titer of HRV14-or HRV16-immunized sera. NA titers were determined as described in the Materials and Methods section. The sera were assayed in duplicate and NA titer is expressed as Log 2 geometric mean \u00b1 SEM, n = 10-20 sera/group. A NA titer of 3.3 \u00b1 0.0 is the limit of detection of the assay. (E) Passive transfer of HRV16 hyper immune serum does not protect animals from HRV14 challenge. Animals were treated intraperitoneally with na\u00efve serum (0.5 ml) or serum from animals immunized i.m. with HRV16 (0.5 or 1 ml). The following day, animals were challenged i.n. with 10 6 PFU (100 \u00b5l/rat) of HRV14 and euthanized 8 h later to determine lung viral titers. n = 5 per group. (F) IFN-\u03b3 ELISPOT with splenocytes of na\u00efve, HRV14-, and HRV16-immunized cotton rats after in vitro stimulation with control media, uninfected HeLa OH cell supernatant, homologous or heterologous UV-inactivated viruses, and Con A. Cotton rats were either unimmunized (na\u00efve), immunized i.m. with live HRV14 or HRV16 (10 6 PFU/100 \u00b5l). Three weeks after the initial immunization, animals were boosted with the same immunogen as indicated. At week 7, spleens were harvested and IFN-\u03b3 producing cells were estimated by ELISPOT assay as described in Section Materials and Methods. n = 3-5 rats/group. against heterologous major group HRV16 challenge (Blanco et al., 2014) . Taken together, these data suggest, first, that ICAM-1 in the cotton rat might harbor conserved features of the human counterpart that permits major group HRV attachment and entry. Second, our data supports the conclusion that viruses that generate strong humoral responses in cotton rats upon i.m. vaccination would potentially undergo productive replication in the airways. These two characteristics provide the basis for further development of an animal model for major group HRVs to test the probable vaccine candidates.",

It is clear that a vaccine that targets this group of viruses will need to elicit an immune response that is broad enough to protect against a wide range of HRV serotypes. In a key study carried out more than 30 years ago using sera from rabbit and guinea pigs immunized with different HRV types, Cooney and collaborators defined several cross-neutralization relationships between HRV A and B types that allowed classification of different types into crossreactivity groups (Cooney et al., 1975 (Cooney et al., , 1982 . More recently, genetic clustering of all human serotype strains has been performed based on the genomic sequence of the VP4/VP2 region (Savolainen et al., 2002) and based on the whole viral genome (Palmenberg et al., 2009) . A report showed that immunization with recombinant HRV14 and HRV89 (two distantly related HRV strains) VP1 in mice and rabbits induced strong cross-NA response that showed cross-protection against distantly related HRV strains. However, the cross-protection was evidenced only by in vitro neutralization assays, and was based on the previously published serotype relationships (Edlmayr et al., 2011) . In fact, there is limited in vivo data available to prove cross-protection or neutralization between different HRVs. Our data shows that the cotton rat can replicate two HRVs, both of which use ICAM-1 to gain entry into cells and major group A HRV16-immunized cotton rats were partially protected against major group B HRV14 challenge, indicating generation of cross-serotype immunity. Thus, our results indicated that the cotton rat model could be useful to measure the efficacy of vaccines against homologous, but also could be useful for dissecting heterologous protection once more serotypes of the major group are validated in the model.",

            "text": "To decipher the mechanisms underlying heterologous crossprotection, we have explored basic mechanisms of protection. First, using in vitro neutralization assays, we were unable to detect cross-NA response ( Figure 3D) . Secondly, we performed prophylactic treatment of na\u00efve cotton rats using a hyperimmune pool of anti-HRV16 serum (Blanco et al., 2014) . Although significant levels of NA were detected in treated animals, these animals failed to exhibit cross-protection upon HRV14 challenge ( Figure 3E) . Finally, to detect T-cell responses that could result in the cross-protection seen in vivo, we performed cotton rat-specific IFN-\u03b3 ELISPOT assays using splenocytes derived from HRV16-immunized animals and stimulated with control cell supernatant, UV-HRV14 or UV-HRV16 in vitro. We did not observe any difference in the number of IFN-\u03b3-producing cells detected after stimulation with UV-HRV14 or control stimulation in the conditions and times assayed ( Figure 3F) . Overall, these additional experiments preclude us from concluding that either humoral or cellular responses are involved in crossprotection; however, they lay the groundwork for us to carry out more focused investigations further. Airway lymphocyte responses (using bronchoalveolar lavage, airway-draining lymph nodes, lung homogenates as source of lymphocytes) or crossprotective antibodies against HRV14, that are of mucosal in nature and are not neutralizing in vitro, could be sufficient to mediate neutralization in vivo or facilitate antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) when present in the right quantity and distribution at the site of infection (Glanville et al., 2013) . In addition, ELISPOT assay that measure IL-4-or IL-5producing cells could also give some indication of type of response generated during cross-protection. It has been reported using a C57BL/6 model of HRV infection that immunization with recombinant VP0 protein from major group HRV16, combined with Th1 promoting adjuvants, induced antigenspecific Th1 responses in the airways, enhanced NA responses upon infection with minor group virus HRV1B and 29 and major group HRV14, and caused a rapid decrease in lung virus load in mice challenged with HRV1B, indicating that immunization with the capsid protein could prime animals to develop broader cross-reactive immunity against HRVs (McLean et al., 2012; Glanville et al., 2013) . Importantly, Glanville et al. have shown that splenocytes from HRV16 VP0 protein immunized mice produced both IFN-\u03b3 and IL-5 when stimulated with VP0 peptides of HRV14. The lack of cross-stimulation of IFN-\u03b3 in splenocytes of HRV16 immunized cotton rats when stimulated with UV-HRV14 ( Figure 3F) is likely the result of immunization with whole virus instead of a highly conserved peptide. A more recent report has shown that serum NA against many HRVs can be induced by polyvalent, inactivated HRVs plus alum as the adjuvant. Using formulations up to 25-valent in mice and 50-valent in rhesus macaques, Lee et al. showed that the extent of HRV vaccine immunogenicity was related to the quantity of input antigens, and valency was not a major factor affecting potency or breadth of the response. In addition, it was shown that the NA responses were type-specific and not cross-neutralizing because there was minimal in vitro neutralization activity induced by the 25-valent vaccine against 10 non-vaccine types (Lee et al., 2016) .",

            "text": "In addition, we failed to document a correlation between immunization-mediated reduction in viral replication and the reduction of lung pathology to establish a clinically relevant protection. As inflammation due to primary HRV14 infection was mild, in the presented immunization experiment, a correlation between viral replication and disease could not been drawn. However, this result is not surprising since, as is observed in humans, the cotton rat model also fails to show benefit in clinical outcome when therapeutic administration of antibodies during RSV infection was used, despite complete protection of the lung from viral replication (Rodriguez et al., 1997; Malley et al., 1998; Prince et al., 2000) . Although we could demonstrate partial heterologous protection by HRV16 immunization against HRV14 challenge, a reciprocal immunological relation between these two viruses could not be demonstrated (Figures 3B,C) . It is entirely possible that an immunodominant epitope on HRV16 represents a minor epitope on HRV14, allowing for partial protection of animals vaccinated with HRV16, but not vice versa. Consistent with this hypothesis is the possibility that a distinct immunodominant epitope on HRV14 not present on HRV16 elicits homologous protection but not heterologous protection in HRV16-challenged animals.",
