However, recent worldwide respiratory outbreaks discourage routine use of nebulization. Previous studies have shown that combined budesonide/formoterol (Symbicort \u00ae , AstraZeneca) is effective as both a maintenance and reliever anti-asthmatic medication. Methods: We performed a randomized, open-label study from March until August 2011 to compare the bronchodilatory effects of Symbicort \u00ae vs. nebulized salbutamol in acute exacerbation of mild to moderate asthmatic attack in an emergency department. Initial objective parameters measured include the oxygen saturation, peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) and respiratory rate. During clinical reassessment, subjective parameters [i.e., Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and 5-point Likert scale of breathlessness] and the second reading of the objective parameters were measured. For the 5-point Likert scale, the patients were asked to describe their symptom relief as 1, much worse; 2, a little worse; 3, no change; 4, a little better; 5, much better. Results: Out of the total of 32 patients enrolled, 17 patients (53%) were randomized to receive nebulized salbutamol and 15 (47%) to receive Symbicort \u00ae . For both treatment arms, by using paired t-and Wilcoxon signed rank tests, it was shown that there were statistically significant improvements in oxygen saturation, PEFR and respiratory rate within the individual treatment groups (pre-vs. post-treatment). Comparing the effects of Symbicort \u00ae vs. nebulized salbutamol, the average improvement of oxygen saturation was 1% in both treatment arms (p = 0.464), PEFR 78.67 l/min vs. 89.41 l/min, respectively (p = 0.507), and respiratory rate 2/min vs. 2/min (p = 0.890). For subjective evaluation, all patients reported improvement in the VAS (average 2.45 cm vs. 2.20 cm), respectively (p = 0.765). All patients in both treatment arms reported either \"a little better\" or \"much better\" on the 5-point Likert scale, with none reporting \"no change\" or getting worse. Conclusion: This study suggests that there is no statistical difference between using Symbicort \u00ae vs. nebulized salbutamol as the reliever for the first 15 min post-intervention.",

Even though at this stage it is premature to state whether Symbicort \u00ae can or should be used as an alternative reliever in acute asthmatic attacks, nonetheless, we demonstrated that both Symbicort \u00ae and salbutamol offer similar improvement in objective and subjective assessments, and that there is no difference between the two.",

Furthermore, in this study, the patient's comorbidities, duration of asthma and risk factors such as smoking status were not taken into consideration. However, this study may pave the way for larger studies in the future to study the beneficial effects of Symbicort \u00ae beyond the first 15 min and whether it can be used as an alternative reliever. A better alternative methodology would be to add a placebo inhaler for patients in the nebulized salbutamol arm and a placebo nebulization (e.g., saline) for the Symbicort \u00ae arm. In this way, the confounding bias due to the different drug delivery systems could be minimized.",

This is often because patients do not understand the difference between maintenance and reliever medications as well as the importance of regular ICS use [15, 16] . As a result, many patients tend to over-rely on short-acting \u03b2-2 agonist medications for quick relief of symptoms at the expense of omitting their ICS therapy, thus lowering anti-inflammatory protection and increasing the propensity for the development of severe and potentially lifethreatening exacerbations [17] . If an alternative agent that combines both reliever and maintenance medications could be used, this would simplify treatment and provide a more convenient and effective way in which to deliver medications to the endobronchial tree.",
