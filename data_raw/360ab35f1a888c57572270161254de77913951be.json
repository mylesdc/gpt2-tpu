            "text": "During pregnancy, the maternal immune response changes dramatically over the course of gestation. This has implications for generation of lactogenic immunity and subsequent protection in suckling neonates against enteric viral infections. For example, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is an alphacoronavirus that causes acute diarrhea in neonatal piglets. Due to the high virulence of PEDV and the na\u00efve, immature immune system of neonatal suckling piglets, passive lactogenic immunity to PEDV induced during pregnancy, via the gut-mammary gland (MG)-secretory IgA (sIgA) axis, is critical for piglet protection. However, the anti-PEDV immune response during pregnancy and stage of gestation required to optimally stimulate the gut-MG-sIgA axis is undefined. We hypothesize that there is a gestational window in which non-lethal PEDV infection of pregnant gilts influences maximum lymphocyte mucosal trafficking to the MG, resulting in optimal passive lactogenic protection in suckling piglets. To understand how the stages of gestation affect maternal immune responses to PEDV, three groups of gilts were orally infected with PEDV in the first, second or third trimester. Control (mock) gilts were inoculated with medium in the third trimester. To determine if lactogenic immunity correlated with protection, all piglets were PEDV-challenged at 3-5 days postpartum. PEDV infection of gilts at different stages of gestation significantly affected multiple maternal systemic immune parameters prepartum, including cytokines, B cells, PEDV antibodies (Abs), and PEDV antibody secreting cells (ASCs). Pregnant second trimester gilts had significantly higher levels of circulating PEDV IgA and IgG Abs and ASCs and PEDV virus neutralizing (VN) Abs post PEDV infection. Coinciding with the significantly higher PEDV Ab responses in second trimester gilts, the survival rate of their PEDV-challenged piglets was 100%, compared with 87.2, 55.9, and 5.7% for first, third, and mock litters, respectively. Additionally, piglet survival positively correlated with PEDV Langel et al.",

For example, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a highly virulent re-emerging enteric coronavirus that causes acute diarrhea, dehydration, and death in neonatal piglets (3) . It has killed over 8.5 million piglets since its emergence in the US in 2013. In adult pigs, PEDV causes watery diarrhea, depression, and anorexia as well as agalactia and reduced reproductive performance (1) (2) (3) . Lactogenic immunity remains the most promising and effective way to protect neonatal suckling piglets from enteric diseases like PEDV (4, 5) . This is dependent on trafficking of pathogen-specific IgA + plasmablasts to the mammary gland (MG) and accumulation of secretory IgA (sIgA) antibodies (Abs) in milk, defined as the gut-MG-sIgA axis (6) (7) (8) . Understanding the regulation of mucosal homing receptor and chemokine expression is critical to generate sufficient lactogenic immunity for piglet protection. For example, chemokine receptor (CCR)10, a lymphocyte gut homing marker, is required for IgA + plasmablast recruitment to the MG in mice and humans (9) (10) (11) . Additionally, an increase in lymphocyte migration to the MG in swine at the end of gestation and during lactation coincides with an increase in \u03b1 4 \u03b2 7 integrin, another lymphocyte gut homing marker, on B cells (12) . Identifying factors that influence lymphocyte migration and the gut-MG-sIgA axis may lead to improved PEDV vaccine regimens in gestating swine, boosting overall herd immunity and health and industry productivity.",

For example, in swine, high rates of protection against another porcine enteric alphacoronavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) in piglets is achieved when pregnant sows are orally infected with live virulent virus (5) (6) (7) (13) (14) (15) . The increased rate of protection was associated with high titers of IgA Abs in colostrum and milk. This demonstrates that enteric viral infection stimulates the intestinal mucosa influencing lactogenic immunity via the gut-MG-sIgA axis (4, 5) . This model system can be used in the context of PEDV, as similar maternal vaccination strategies are needed for initiation of the gut-MG-sIgA axis and piglet protection (4, 12, 16, 17) . We showed previously in third trimester pregnant gilts that administering a higher dose of virulent PEDV increased virus neutralizing (VN) Ab titers in colostrum/milk and piglet protection compared with a lower dose (4) . Despite this, field reports demonstrate incomplete and variable protection in orally PEDV-infected gestating swine (4) . Furthermore, the optimal stage of gestation to initiate the gut-MG-sIgA axis by means of natural infection or oral vaccination in na\u00efve pregnant swine to generate protective lactogenic immunity is unknown.",

For example, during the first trimester of gestation, levels of innate and proinflammatory factors increase, facilitating embryo implantation (19, 20) . As pregnancy progresses, inflammatory cytokines decrease and regulatory cells and cytokines increase to support fetal growth and development to prevent rejection of the fetus (21) (22) (23) (24) . In the third trimester of gestation, the immunoregulatory environment is retained until immediately prior to parturition when proinflammatory and tissue repair factors increase, promoting the contraction of the uterus and expulsion of the fetus and placenta (18) . The ability of pregnancy to differentially modulate the immune response explains why the severity of illness and efficacy of vaccination is dependent on stage of gestation. For example, the risk and severity of influenza (25) , malaria (26) , and listeria (27) is higher for women in their third trimester than other gestational stages. Additionally, in women vaccinated with the trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine, seroconversion rates were higher in late third trimester compared with first trimester-vaccinated women (28) . Due to the differences in immune responses at different stages of pregnancy, it is important to consider stage of gestation when designing vaccines aimed to increase lactogenic immunity and passive transfer of protective Abs in colostrum/milk from mother to neonate.",

Our goal was to identify innate and adaptive immune factors during pregnancy that influence lymphocyte trafficking, in addition to immune correlates of lactogenic immune protection in neonatal suckling piglets. Understanding the impact of stage of gestation at PEDV infection or exposure on maternal immunity will allow more precise maternal vaccination protocols to target the time when the animal is most immunologically responsive. Optimizing vaccine efficacy for gestating and lactating animals will enhance lactogenic immunity in neonates and decrease morbidity and mortality associated with neonatal enteric disease.",

The number of viable piglets born were not statistically significant between treatment groups ( Figure S5 ). Second trimester PEDV infection of gilts resulted in 100% survival of PEDV challenged piglets ( Figure 7A ). First trimester gilts provided intermediate protection (87.2% survival) while third trimester gilts provided the least amount of protection (55.9% survival) among PEDVinfected gilts. Mock piglet's survival rate (5.7%) was significantly lower than all other treatment groups. Comparison of piglet weight gain revealed second trimester litters gained significantly more weight than all other treatment groups starting at post challenge day (PCD) 4 and lasting throughout the experiment ( Figure 7B ). First trimester litters had significantly higher normalized weights than third trimester litters at PCD 6, 7, and 9, but were similar thereafter. Mock litters were stunted (decreased or no weight gain) from PCD 1-7 and had the lowest normalized weights throughout the study. Lactogenic immune protection coincided with decreased PEDV RNA shedding titers where mean peak titers were 6.1 \u00b1 0.2 log 10 copies/ml, 7.8 \u00b1 0.3 log 10 copies/ml, 9.1 \u00b1 0.3 log 10 copies/ml, and 10.1 \u00b1.2 log 10 copies/ml for second, first, third, and mock litters, respectively ( Figure 7C ). Corresponding to increased weight gain and decreased PEDV RNA shedding titers, diarrhea scores were significantly lower in second trimester litters throughout the study ( Figure 7D ). While first trimester litters had diarrhea, it was delayed and significantly lower than third trimester litters at PCD 2-5. Mock litters had diarrhea immediately at PCD 1, lasting through PCD 11 and diarrhea scores were significantly higher than all other treatment groups. Gilt mean PEDV RNA shedding titers and fecal consistency scores were measured post piglet challenge. Mock gilt PEDV RNA shedding titers were significantly higher at PCD 2-7 than first, second and third trimester PEDV-infected gilts and remained numerically higher until PCD 17 ( Figure S6A) . Additionally, first trimester gilt PEDV RNA shedding titers peaked at PCD 4, earlier compared with second and third trimester gilts ( Figure S6A ). Mock gilt fecal consistency scores were significantly higher at PCD 5-11 compared with first, second and third trimester PEDV-infected gilts ( Figure S6B) .

Maternal vaccination that enhances passively transferred protective Abs in milk, induced via the gut-MG-sIgA axis, is the major strategy to protect neonatal suckling piglets immediately after birth (4, 5). However, due to the biological and immunological differences at each stage of pregnancy (18) , the optimum time to induce maternal immunity and the gut-MG-sIgA axis was previously undefined. Here, we evaluated the impact of stage of gestation at PEDV infection on the maternal immune response, the generation of PEDV-specific ASCs and Abs in serum and milk .

For example, second trimester gilts had the highest peak levels of circulating PEDV IgA and IgG ASCs and Abs and VN Abs prior to parturition. Interestingly, this coincided with higher serum cytokine concentrations of TGF-\u03b2 (significantly) and IL-6 (numerically) at PID 0 in second trimester gilts. TGF-\u03b2 a cytokine produced by multiple lineages of leukocytes and stromal cells (42) , is required for IgA class switch recombination (43) and IgA + B cell survival in the lamina propria (44) . Additionally, IL-6 promotes Ab production by increasing B cell helper capacity of CD4 + T cells (38) . Our data support previous research demonstrating increased serum TGF-\u03b2 in women during the second trimester (45) correlating with increased Ab titers (46) . The increased serum TGF-\u03b2 and IL-6 at PEDV infection in second trimester gilts likely contributed to the enhanced anti-PEDV maternal immune responses.",

            "text": "Despite being PEDV-infected 5 weeks earlier, first trimester gilts generated a lower maternal immune response during gestation compared with second trimester gilts ( Table 1) . This suggests stage of gestation dependent differences in immune parameters may contribute to differential induction of the humoral immune response during PEDV infection (47, 48) . The increase in NK cell frequencies at PID 0 in first compared with second and third trimester gilts (first trimester,  second trimester, GD 57-59; and third trimester, GD 96-97) is in agreement with previous studies reporting increased numbers of cytotoxic peripheral NK cells in first trimester women and swine (49) (50) (51) . Furthermore, the significantly higher circulating NK cell cytotoxicity at PID 6-8 coincided with enhanced mean concentrations of serum IL-12 and IL-22, NK cell activation, and proliferation cytokines, at PID 0 in first trimester gilts (29, (52) (53) (54) . Increased peripheral and decidual NK cell frequencies and lytic activity during the first trimester are thought to support maternal tissue remodeling during embryo implantation in swine and humans (20, 51, 55, 56) . Additionally, NK cells are known to modulate B cell immunity (57, 58) . Therefore, the unique immune environment during the first trimester may impact B cell responses to PEDV infection in pregnant gilts. Future studies investigating the effects of NK cells on the maternal immune response during an enteric viral infection in gilts are warranted.",

            "text": "We also hypothesized that stage of gestation would impact B cell phenotypes pre and post PEDV infection. For example, lymphocyte \u03b14 + \u03b27 + integrin is a mucosal adhesion molecule responsible for cellular migration in the intestinal mucosa and lymphoid tissue by interacting with its receptor mucosal addressin cellular adhesion molecule 1 (MAdCAM-1) (59-62). Circulating \u03b14\u03b27 + lymphocytes reflect the intestinal tissue in which they were primed (63) and may influence the gut-MG-sIgA axis. The significantly higher frequencies of \u03b14 + \u03b27 + B cells at PID 0 and 6-8 in second and third trimester, compared with first trimester gilts ( Table 1) , coincides with increased concentrations of immune modulating pregnancy-associated hormones in swine, like estrone, estrone sulfate, 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2), and E2 sulfate (64) . For example, trafficking of IgA + lymphoblasts to the MG in ovariectomized female mice was enhanced after E2 administration (65) . Additionally, E2 in combination with progesterone administration in ovariectomized female mice resulted in increased L-selectin and \u03b14-dependent adhesion of NK cells to mucosal tissues (60) . Additionally, we observed differential effects of gestational stage on CD2 \u2212 CD21 + (primed and/or activated) B cell frequencies in blood. The significant increase in circulating CD2 \u2212 CD21 + B cell frequencies at PID 6-8 and 12-17 in second and third trimester compared with first trimester gilts is similar to the trend observed for \u03b14\u03b27 + B cell frequencies later in pregnancy ( Table 1) . The increasing concentrations of pregnancy-associated hormones as pregnancy progresses could modulate circulating frequencies of CD2 \u2212 CD21 + B cells, contributing to the differential immune responses observed in this study. Future studies treating ovariectomized swine with exogenous E2 or progesterone are needed to decipher the in vivo effects of pregnancy associated hormones on mucosal lymphocyte trafficking, B cell activation and ASC and Ab production.",

In our study, second trimester gilts provided greater passive lactogenic immune protection (100%) compared with first (87.2%) and third (55.9%) trimester and mock gilts (5.7%). The increased levels of protection were significantly correlated with PEDV IgA ASCs and Abs and VN Abs in colostrum and milk (Tables 1, 2) . These results are in agreement with previous work done with TGEV-infected pregnant swine. For example, high rates of protection against TGEV in piglets were achieved when pregnant sows were orally infected (6, 7, 13) with live virulent virus (14, 15) . The increased rate of protection was associated with high titers of IgA Abs in colostrum and milk induced via the gut-MG-sIgA axis (66) . Additionally, PEDV IgA and IgG Ab titers in piglet serum at PCD 0 correlated with piglet protection against PEDV challenge. In our study, we experimentally infected gilts with the same dose and strain of PEDV and controlled for parity and lack of prior TGEV-exposure. Therefore, we were able to observe correlates of immunity where second trimester gilts provided optimal protection in PEDV challenged suckling piglets correlating with levels of colostrum and milk PEDV IgA ASCs and Abs and VN Abs and piglet serum IgA and IgG Abs ( Table 1) . Experimental infection studies of gilts/sows with controlled PEDV doses and timing of piglet challenge post parturition are important for determining correlates of lactogenic immune protection against PEDV.",

This suggests factors involved in intestinal homeostasis are impacted by the hormonal changes during the third trimester. For example, circulating E2 and porcine growth hormone concentrations increase in the third trimester prior to parturition (64) . There is growing evidence that hormones dynamically influence the gut microbiome (67) . Coincidently, the gut microbial environment during pregnancy changes dramatically from the first to third trimesters in humans (68, 69) and swine (70) resulting in decreased bacterial community richness. Additionally, studies of PEDV-infected pregnant sows revealed a significant decrease of observed bacterial species compared with healthy pregnant sows (71) . Although the gut microbiome was not examined in this study, it is possible that pregnancy hormone-induced effects on the gut microbiome during late pregnancy in combination with PEDV infection resulted in increased gut dysbiosis in third trimester pregnant gilts. Future studies investigating the impact of the microbiome during pregnancy on PEDV pathogenesis and the gut-MG-sIgA axis are warranted.",

More research is needed in humans and livestock to better understand maternal immunity and to design the most effective maternal vaccines to passively protect suckling neonates and prevent neonatal morbidity and mortality.",

            "text": "In summary, a comparison of PEDV infection at different stages of gestation demonstrated that first, second and third trimester gilt immune responses vary greatly in magnitude of their immune response and association with lactogenic immune protection. We conclude that second trimester gilts have the greatest capacity to generate a robust anti-PEDV humoral immune response prior to parturition, resulting in the highest amount of lactogenic immune protection against PEDV challenge in neonatal suckling piglets. Additionally, piglet protection against PEDV challenge is correlated with PEDV IgA ASC, IgA Abs, and VN Abs in milk and PEDV IgA and IgG Abs in piglet serum (Tables 1, 2) . Our results provide novel insights and identify possible predictors of maternal vaccine efficacy for passive protection of suckling piglets. Finally, pregnancy should not be evaluated as a single event and development of a successful attenuated PEDV vaccine requires consideration of stage of gestation at the time of vaccination.",

Second and third trimester gilts arrived at our facilities at GD 49-51 and 89-92, respectively, and acclimated for 1 week prior to PEDV infection. First trimester gilts were housed and PEDV-infected at the National Animal Disease Center, USDA-ARS, in Ames, Iowa and then four gilts were shipped to our facilities at GD 93 after they were determined to be fecal shedding negative by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Gilt fecal samples were collected, and clinical signs observed on PID 0, 2, 4, 6, 10, and 14. Fecal consistency was scored as follows: 0, solid; 1, pasty; 2, semiliquid; 3, liquid, respectively. A fecal consistency score of >1 was considered as diarrhea (4, 77) . Blood samples were collected post-PEDV infection at PID 0, 6-8 and 12-17 and also prior to parturition at GD 82-95, 98-102, and 104-114 for serum and mononuclear cell (MNC) isolation. All gilts farrowed naturally in our facilities at GD 114 (\u00b1 3) and colostrum was collected within 12 h of parturition. Piglets were orally PEDV-challenged at 3-5 days of age (mean \u00b1 SD challenge day for first trimester litters = 4.0 \u00b1 0.82, second trimester litters = 4.4 \u00b1 0.96, third trimester litters = 4.2 \u00b1 0.82 and mock litters = 3.7 \u00b1 0.96). Gilt and piglet serum were collected on PCD 0, 5-9, 12-17, and 21-29. All colostrum and milk samples were collected after administration of 2cc oxytocin intramuscularly (IM) at PPD 0, 3-5, 8-14, and 15-22 ( Figure 1B) . Gilt MG biopsies were collected at GD 104-114 and PPD 8-14. Piglet fecal samples were collected and clinical signs and body weights were recorded daily on PCD 0-7 and every other day through PCD 15-17. All animals were euthanized at PCD 21-29. Upon euthanasia, gilt blood, ileum, MG, MLN, and spleen tissues were collected for MNC isolation. Piglet blood was collected and the serum separated for immunologic assays.",

Subsequently, the inoculum was removed, cells were washed twice with sterile PBS [1X pH 7.4 (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO)] and overlaid with 0.75% low melting point agarose (SeaPlaque, Lonza, Riverside, PA) in serum free media supplemented with tryptose phosphate broth and trypsin as described for PEDV cultivation (75) . Plates were incubated at 37 \u2022 C for 3 days and then stained with 0.001% neutral red solution (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Plaques were counted and the VN titers were determined by calculating the reciprocal of the highest dilution of a serum/whey sample showing an 80% reduction in the number of plaques compared with seronegative control serum/whey.",

At the time of testing, PEDV or mock antigen solution was further diluted 1:4 and added(60 \u00b5l per well) to uncoated polystyrene plates (Fisher Scientific, Hampton, NH) in alternating wells. Plates were incubated for 4 h at 37 \u2022 C or overnight at 4 \u2022 C. Plates were washed 5X with PBS-T wash solution (PBS 1X, 0.1% Tween-20 [Fisher Scientific, Hampton NH], pH 7.4). General Block ELISA blocking solution (Immunochemistry Technologies, Bloomington, MN) was added (200 \u00b5l per well) and plates were stored at 4 \u2022 C overnight. After incubation, plates were washed twice with PBS-T and samples were added. All samples were serially diluted starting at 1:4 and added (50 \u00b5l per well) in duplicate to coated plates. Positive and negative controls (Ab-positive and -negative experimental samples) were included per plate for each sample type. Plates were incubated at room temperature (RT) for 1.5 h and washed 5X with PBS-T. Primary Abs were added (100 \u00b5l per well) diluted in PBS-T to detect IgA Ab [peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-pig IgA (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA)] and IgG [biotin-conjugated goat anti-pig IgG (Seracare, Milford, MA)] in serum (1:4,000 and 1:20,000, respectively) and milk/intestinal samples (1:20,000). IgA plates were incubated at RT for 1.5 h and IgG at 37 \u2022 C for 1 hr. For IgG plates, peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin [1:10,000 (Roche, Basel, Switzerland)] was added (100 \u00b5l per well) and incubated at RT for 1 h. For both IgA and IgG, plates were washed twice with PBS-T and the reaction was visualized for all plates by adding 100 \u00b5l of 3,3 \u2032 ,5,5 \u2032 -tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate with H 2 O 2 membrane peroxidase substrate system (Seracare, Milford, MA). Plates were incubated at RT for 5 min and stopped by addition of 100 \u00b5l stop solution (1 M sulfuric acid) to each well. Reactions were measured as optical density at 450 nm using an ELISA plate reader (Spectramax 340pc, Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA). The ELISA Ab titer was expressed as the reciprocal of the highest dilution that had a corrected A 450 value (sample absorbance in the virus-coated well minus sample absorbance in the mock antigen-coated well) greater than the cut-off value (mean corrected A 450 value of negative controls plus 3 standard deviations). Samples negative at a dilution of 1:4 were assigned a titer of 1:2 for the calculation of geometric mean titers (GMTs). To detect PEDV ASCs, PEDV PC22A, and mock-infected, acetone-fixed Vero cells in 96-well plates were used similar to methods used to detect TGEV ASC (85, 86). Briefly, after infected Vero cells (at 95-100% confluency) showed 90-95% CPE, cells were fixed with 80% acetone for 15 min, allowed to dry for 1-2 h and stored at \u221220 \u2022 C. Mock-infected cell monolayers served as negative controls. Plates were thawed and rehydrated in sterile PBS for 15 min at RT. Serial dilutions of MNCs (5 \u00d7 10 5 , 5 \u00d7 10 4 , 5 \u00d7 10 3 , and 5 \u00d7 10 2 ) were added to duplicate wells (100 \u00b5l per well) of fixed PEDV PC22A and mockinfected cell monolayers. Plates were centrifuged at 120\u00d7 g, for 5 min at RT and incubated at 37 \u2022 C with 5% CO 2 for 12-14 h. After incubation, the plates were washed 5X with PBS-T. ASCs were detected by incubating plates with HRP-conjugated antipig IgA [1:4,000 (Bio-Rad, Hercules)] or biotinylated anti-pig IgG [1:20,000 (Seracare, Milford, MA)]. All Abs were added at 100 \u00b5l per well. Plates incubated with Abs to IgA were incubated at RT for 1.5 h and for Abs to IgG at 37 \u2022 C for 1 h. For IgG plates, peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin [1:10,000 (Roche, Basel, Switzerland)] was added (100 \u00b5l per well) and incubated at RT for 1 h. The reaction was visualized for all plates by adding 100 \u00b5l TMB substrate with H 2 O 2 membrane peroxidase substrate system (Seracare, Milford, MA). Spots were detected and counted using a light microscope. Counts were averaged from duplicate wells and expressed relative to 5 \u00d7 10 5 MNC. Analysis and Evaluation of PEDV Ab + Cells in the MG To evaluate PEDV Ab + cells in the MG, 5 cm biopsies were collected using a 12 gauge \u00d7 10 cm semi-automatic needle (Bard Peripheral Vascular, Tempe, AZ) and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. Sections were trimmed, processed, and embedded in paraffin. Sections were cut (3.5 \u00b5m thick) and processed for antigen retrieval (0.05% pronase E treatment [Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO]). For detection of PEDV Ab + cells, a PEDV viral suspension sandwich immunohistochemistry (IHC) method was developed. Semipurified inactivated PEDV antigen, as described previously for PEDV Ab ELISA plates, was added to tissue sections and incubated overnight at 4 \u2022 C. A mAb to the N protein of a highly virulent US PEDV strain [PC22A-like (PEDV 72-111-25 IgM G-14, kindly provided by Steven Lawson and Eric Nelson, Department of Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences, South Dakota State University)] was added to tissue sections and incubated overnight at 4 \u2022 C. Supersensitive Polymer-HRP IHC Detection System (Biogenex, Fremont, CA) was used as a secondary Ab and substrate prior to hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining.
