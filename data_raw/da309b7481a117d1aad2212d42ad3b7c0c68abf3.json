One of the major interests and challenges in NS5 is to understand the interplay between RdRP and MTase as a unique natural fusion protein in viral genome replication and cap formation. Here, we report the first crystal structure of the full-length flavivirus NS5 from Japanese encephalitis virus. The structure completes the vision for polymerase motifs F and G, and depicts defined intra-molecular interactions between RdRP and MTase. Key hydrophobic residues in the RdRP-MTase interface are highly conserved in flaviviruses, indicating the biological relevance of the observed conformation. Our work paves the way for further dissection of the inter-regulations of the essential enzymatic activities of NS5 and exploration of possible other conformations of NS5 under different circumstances.",

            "text": "As a genus of viruses in the family Flaviviridae among positivestrand RNA viruses, flaviviruses have more than 70 members, often causing human encephalitis and hemorrhagic diseases. Among these, the mosquito-borne species include important human pathogens such as dengue (DENV), yellow fever (YFV), West Nile (WNV), and Japanese encephalitis (JEV) viruses, affecting about onethird of the world population, mostly in tropical and subtropical regions. Currently, there is no effective antiviral drug available for all flaviviruses, and vaccines are lacking for DENV and WNV. The 10-11 kilo-base positive-sense flavivirus RNA genome contains both 59 and 39 untranslated regions (UTRs) and a single open reading frame that is translated into a large polyprotein. The genome bears a cap 1 structure ( N7Me G59-ppp-59A 29OMe ) at its 59 end [1] , while its 39 end is not poly-adenylated. The polyprotein is processed into three structural and seven non-structural proteins. Among those, the <900-residue non-structural protein 5 (NS5) comprises an Nterminal S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferase (MTase) domain, and a C-terminal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) region that harbors the classic thumb, palm, and fingers domains present in all single-subunit polymerases. Although MTase is common for viruses bearing a 59 cap structure and RdRP is required for all RNA viruses, the flavivirus NS5 represents a unique natural fusion of these two important enzymes. However, whether and how inter-regulations and cooperativity take place between the two enzymes of NS5 remain elusive.",

The flavivirus MTase is believed to catalyze both the N7 and 29-O methylation steps, and may also act as a guanylyltransferase (GTase) to form the G59-ppp-59A linkage [5, 6] , thereby playing key roles in the capping process. In 2007, the crystal structures of the RdRP region (the C-terminal 630 residues) from WNV and DENV were reported [7, 8] . Despite the fact that polymerase motifs F and G were not resolved, these RdRP structures exhibit high degree of similarity to the non-structural protein 5B (NS5B) from hepatitis C virus (HCV) and bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) that represent the other two genera of the family Flaviviridae [9, 10] . Different from primer-dependent RdRPs such as poliovirus (PV) 3D [11, 12] , these polymerases contain a ''priming element'' that partially occupies the putative ds-RNA channel (also termed ''front channel'') and is believed to play an important role in de novo initiation of the RNA synthesis.",

The overall folds of MTase and RdRP are largely consistent with existing flavivirus NS5 crystal structures for individual enzymes (Figs. 1-2, Fig. S2A in Text S1). The MTase (residues 1-266) is complexed with the S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH), the demethylated form of SAM. Unlike previously reported RdRP structures, the RdRP region of NS5 is intact, with motifs F and G completely resolved. The linker is largely seen with only three residues (271-273) not modeled due to weakness of the electron density. The missing of residues 271-273 is not a result of proteolysis since the protein is intact in the crystal (Fig. S1D in Text S1). The distance between a-carbon atoms of residues 270 and 274 in the model is about 13 \u00c5 , at least 17 \u00c5 shorter than any other possible connections in the crystal lattice, thus making the current model unambiguous.

            "text": "Due to limited coding capacity, RNA viruses often generate proteins that contain more than one enzyme module to fulfill their rather complicated life cycle. Among those, the flavivirus nonstructural protein NS5 comprises an Nterminal methyltransferase (MTase) and a C-terminal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), playing key roles in processes including viral genome replication and capping. Although high-resolution crystal structures are available for MTase or RdRP alone, the intra-molecular interactions between the two modules remain elusive. By solving the crystal-structure of the full-length Japanese encephalitis virus NS5, we provide the first high-resolution readout of NS5 in its integrity, featuring an MTase-RdRP interface that is highly conserved in flaviviruses. Flaviviruses also include other important human pathogens such as dengue, West Nile, yellow fever, and tick-borne encephalitis viruses, currently lacking effective anti-viral drug. The conserved interface revealed by our structure thus may provide possibilities for the pharmaceutical community in the development of anti-flavivirus drug in a broad-spectrum manner.",

            "text": "To better describe the NS5 RdRP structure and its interactions with the MTase, we define individual finger subdomains according to a nomenclature first used in PV RdRP [11] (Fig. 2A) . The tip of the index finger interacts with the thumb domain, forming an encircled active site that is unique to viral RdRPs. The index finger also contains a nuclear localization signal bNLS (residues 322-370) that coincides with the suggested NES (residues 329-345) and NS3 binding site [15] [16] [17] 22, 23] . The highly conserved 20-residue core (residues 345-364) of this region centers at an a-helix that has been suggested to interact with importin b (Fig. 2D ) [16] . The middle finger (residues 578-598) includes the second and third strands of the fingers domain 5-stranded b-sheet, and no specific function has been assigned to this element except for the contribution to the structural integrity of the fingers domain. Interestingly, the flavivirus RdRP middle finger is at least 7-8 residues longer than those of other positive-strand RNA virus RdRPs including HCV and BVDV NS5Bs (Fig. 2B/D) , thus extruding to the surface of the protein. The ring finger (residues 453-479) includes the NTP binding motif F, containing the fourth and fifth strands of the 5-stranded b-sheet. In WNV and DENV RdRP structures, the majority of the ring finger is disordered and the authors proposed an alternate main chain path of this region. In our JEV NS5 structure, the ring finger is ordered and intact, forming the roof of the NTP entry channel, a canonical position observed in other viral RdRPs ( Fig. 2A /B/D). It is noteworthy that the bNLS core helix of the index finger, the tip of the elongated middle finger, and the tip of the ring finger, line in a row at the top-right rim of the NTP entry channel, and interact with the MTase intra-molecularly through key hydrophobic interactions (Figs. 2-3, and details below). Comparing to other fingers, the pinky finger is relatively bulky and forms one side of the dsRNA channel. In primer-dependent viral RdRPs such as PV 3D pol , the pinky finger contains a conserved motif G (residues 109-118) that wedges at the +1/+2 kink of the template RNA, and its N-terminal half runs roughly parallel to the upstream template RNA (Fig. 2B ) [12] . While the corresponding region is mostly disordered in the WNV and DENV RdRP structures, it is resolved in the JEV NS5 structure (residues 404-412), adopting a conformation consistent with that observed in HCV and BVDV NS5Bs (Figs. 2B, S2B). Although not conserved in sequence even within the Flaviviridae family, this region is structurally conserved among all viral RdRPs ( Fig. 2B /D, Fig.  S2B in Text S1), likely playing common roles in RdRP-RNA complex stability and/or RdRP translocation through its intimate association with the template strand.",

However, it associates with the core polymerase in the full-length context and has minimum interactions with the MTase domain ( Fig. 2A) . Interestingly, BVDV NS5B has an N-terminal stretch (residues 94-113) that is highly analogous in conformation [10, 27] , albeit previously not noted ( Fig. 3C /D). Although its function is unclear to date, the N-terminal extension may play auxiliary roles to RdRP by interacting with the first strand of the fingers domain 5-stranded b-sheet. Related to this, a WNV RdRP truncated at residue 317 has the entire middle finger, ring finger, and the majority of the index finger disordered in the crystal structure, and is catalytically inactive. In contrast, an RdRP truncated at residue 273 is active and has the index and middle finger properly folded with the N-terminal extension ( Fig. 2A in Text S1) [7] . Viral RdRPs perform de novo RNA synthesis require an insertion in the thumb domain that projects into the active site, sometimes assisted by a C-terminal extension of the thumb [9,10,21]. As suggested in bacteriophage phi6 RdRP, by using an aromatic side chain (Trp in flaviviruses, Tyr in HCV and phi6) to set up a priming platform through stacking interactions to an initiating NTP, these elements play a critical role in the early stages of genome replication, and are believed to withdraw from the active site upon the growth of the template-product dsRNA during the transition to the elongation phase. The flavivirus NS5 has the priming element as a single loop structure (residues 790-812) connecting two a-helices of the thumb domain ( Fig Fig. 1C ) with a color-coded bar defining structural elements underneath. Coloring scheme is as in Figure 1 , except that the index (green), middle (orange), ring (yellow), and pinky (light red) fingers are individually color-coded. Side chains of key residues in the MTase-RdRP interface are shown in sticks. The strand numbers of the 5-stranded b-sheet are indicated. B-C) Structural comparison of important elements in the core polymerase (B), the N-terminal extension and the priming loop (C). The JEV model is shown as thick ribbons and colored as in panel A. Three highly conserved charged residues in motif F (K459, E461, R474) and two structurally conserved motif G residues (A410, L411) interacting with the +1/+2 junction of the template strand are shown as spheres. The RNA duplex in the PV elongation complex (EC) model is shown in the motif G subpanel. The template strand in the priming loop subpanel is modeled using the PV EC model. Side chains of key priming loop residues W800, R797 and the invariant D536, D668 are shown in sticks. The putative priming NTP site (''p'') and the elongating NTP site (''e'') are indicated. D) Structure-based sequence alignment of RdRP motifs A-G, and other important elements. Three viruses from flavivirus genus, HCV and BVDV representing the other two genera of the Flaviviridae family, and PV representing viruses using primer-dependent strategy in genome replication are included in the alignment. Conserved active site residues (red text), MTase interacting residues (blue text and triangle), priming loop residues (purple text) are highlighted, the two invariant catalytic Asp residues are highlighted by asterisks, and residues in lower case letters either deviate from the consensus structure conformations or are not resolved in the crystal structures and are therefore included based only on sequence homology. The structurally conserved residues interacting with the template +1/+2 junction is highlighted by a red box, Colors at top of the alignment correspond to coloring of the structural elements in panel A. FLAV and PICO are used as abbreviations for Flaviviridae and Picornaviridae Families, respectively. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1003549.g002 cation-p interactions [28] in an orientation suitable for priming the initiating NTP (Fig. 2C) . In contrast to HCV and BVDV NS5B, the C-terminus of JEV NS5 is not a component of the priming platform, as also noted in the WNV RdRP structure [7] . Although the C-terminal 10 residues (896-905) are unresolved in the fulllength structure, the nearly 40 \u00c5 distance between residues 895 and 800, and steric hindrance make it unlikely for the C-terminus to reach the vicinity of the active site.",

The N-terminal 265-residue SAM-dependent MTase domain is highly analogous to all other flavivirus MTase crystal structures, which are unexceptionally solved with the core polymerase excluded from the constructs. To its C-terminus, the MTase is connected by a 10-residue linker (residues 266-275) whose sequence is highly variable among genus flavivirus (Fig. 3C) . The linker is in turn connected to a 28-residue N-terminal extension (residues 276-303) of the core polymerase. This region is modestly conserved among flaviviruses and its function remains elusive. The core polymerase runs from residue 304 to the C-terminus of NS5, and adopts the canonical viral RdRP cupped right hand conformation with an encircled active site. All seven polymerase motifs (motifs A-G) common to viral RdRPs and reverse transcriptases are properly arranged around the polymerase active site, among which the fingers domain motifs F and G are properly resolved for the first time in genus flavivirus, while the motifs A-E are within the palm domain. The 23-residue priming loop (residues 790-812) project into the polymerase active site as an insertion in the thumb domain, playing a key role in de novo initiation process common to polymerases including those from Flaviviridae and Cystoviridae families [7, 21, 27, 30] .",

The PV 3CD protease is a precursor of the 3C protease and 3D polymerase. In its crystal structure, the protease domain connected to the RdRP region through a short linker, with minimal interactions between the two modules [31] . The spatial arrangement between RdRP and its N-terminal fused partner is also different. In NS5, MTase approaches the RdRP from the back, in a direction almost aligned with the dsRNA channel, while in 3CD the 3C protease resides at the left wing of the 3D polymerase backside (Fig. 5 ). In the crystal structure of the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus (SARS-CoV) nsp16/nsp10 binary complex, the stimulatory factor nsp10 forms extensive interactions with the nsp16 MTase. Different from the JEV NS5 that has the RdRP approaches almost perpendicularly to the opening of the MTase catalytic cleft, SARS-CoV nsp10 utilized a slightly concaved surface region to integrate itself to the SAM binding pocket and to extend the putative RNA binding groove of nsp16 MTase, thus enhancing the MTase activity [32] . In contrast, flavivirus MTase domain exhibits both the N7 and 29-O methylation activity comparable to full-length NS5 in methylation assays in vitro [5] , suggesting that the enzymatic function of the MTase is not much affected by its interactions with RdRP. The MTase-RdRP interface is formed mainly by five elements, two from the MTase domain and three from the RdRP region. We define the first element in the MTase as RdRP interacting module (residues 112-128). It includes the b3 strand at the edge of the 7-stranded b-sheet and an extended b-like stretch antiparallel to b3. Among the three key MTase hydrophobic residues forming half of the interface core, Pro113 and Trp121 are highly conserved among known flaviviruses. The second element is the almost invariant GTR sequence at residues 263-265. Along with the spatially neighboring Trp121, the GTR sequence was hypothesized to mediate MTase-RdRP interactions due to its location at the terminus of the MTase [3] . On the RdRP side, the ring finger provides Phe467 at its tip to interact with Pro113/Leu115 of MTase, the bNLS core helix offers Phe351 to wedge between Leu115 and Trp121, and the elongated middle finger that is unique for flaviviruses participates this elegant hydrophobic network through Pro585. Together with the aforementioned key residues in the MTase domain, Phe467/Phe351/P585 are all highly and only conserved in flaviviruses, strongly arguing that the interactions observed in the JEV full-length structure is functionally relevant and common to the flavivirus genus.",

NS5 also interacts with other viral replication proteins, the 59-SLA of the viral RNA genome, and cellular proteins that include transporters between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Therefore, NS5 may adopt drastically different conformations under different circumstances. The bNLS of NS5 contains a highly conserved core (residues 345-364) centers around a helix that is largely occluded by the MTase domain in the full-length structure, making three bimportin interacting candidates R355/K358/K360 inaccessible. Together with the fact that the NS3 binding site was also mapped to the same region of bNLS, these observations argue that unraveling of the 1480 \u00c5 2 MTase-RdRP interface may occur if necessary. Among the two models of NS5 structure proposed previously, the 125 \u00c5 -long extended conformation suggested by SAXS data of DENV NS5 may reflect a form, rather than a defined conformation of NS5 with MTase and RdRP disengaged ( Fig. 6B ) [19] . The radius of gyration (R g ) values of the JEV NS5 structure and the DENV NS5 SAXS model are 31.7 \u00c5 and <36 \u00c5 , respectively, indicating that these two models indeed differ in compactness. The model based on reverse genetics data places the MTase off the front channel (Fig. 6C) [7] . Such an arrangement would favor cooperativity of the two enzymes, but the validation of this cooperative model requires further structural evidence at high resolution.",

            "text": "Motifs F and G are responsible for NTP binding and template RNA binding, respectively. These two regions are both well resolved in the full-length JEV NS5 but disordered in WNV and DENV RdRP crystal structures. The formation of the MTase-RdRP interface likely makes motifs F and G less dynamic and helps maintain a canonical fold of RdRP, which in turn is beneficial for the initiation of RNA synthesis. Based on the spatial arrangement of the two key hydrophobic arrays P113/L115/ W121 and F467/F351/P585, and the GTR pivot (Fig. 4) , we postulate that NS5 could also open up the MTase-RdRP interface using GTR as the pivot to turn into a flexible state (Fig. 6 A-B) when interacting with other components of the genome replication machinery or transporters, or at certain stages of RNA replication. However, the existence of other defined conformation or the formation of an alternate interface between MTase and RdRP requires extra experimental evidences. The 10-residue linker not conserved in sequence would provide freedom for the sampling of other possible conformations to some extent, but larger scale rearrangements may require additional flexibility at the MTase-RdRP junction. Several evidences argue that the N-terminal extension (residues 276-303) may play a role in such a process. This 28-residue region is sometimes considered as part of the MTase [5, 33] . The only structural evidence supporting this came from the Wesselsbron virus MTase crystal structure that has the JEV 271-286 equivalent region folded back to the RdRP interacting module [34] . In contrast, all other crystal structures with this region resolved (including the JEV structure in this study) have it integrated to the core polymerase, wrapping around the first strand of the fingers domain 5-stranded b-sheet ( Fig. 2A, Fig.  S2A in Text S1). In addition, mutations within the C-terminal four residues 300-303 reduced the polymerase activity only to 40-70% [35] , suggesting that the N-terminal extension could play auxiliary roles with respect to the polymerase. However, the association of the N-terminal extension with the RdRP may not be robust either. We have mentioned that BVDV NS5B residues 94-113 is structurally analogous to the N-terminal extension of JEV NS5. Although the same mode of interactions between the N-terminal extension and the fingers domain were observed, in the two crystal forms of the BVDV NS5B, one has the N-terminal extension folded with its own RdRP, and the other has it in a domainswapping arrangement, associating with the RdRP from a second polypeptide chain. Taken together, the versatility of interactions offered by the N-terminal extension may significantly increase the spatial freedom for the placement of the MTase relative to the core polymerase, allowing the two regions to adopt drastically different relative orientations as needed for the sake of enzymatic activities, regulatory reasons, or MTase-RdRP cooperativity. For example, the conformation of the WNV NS5 cooperative model may be achieved with the flexibility of the N-terminal extension (depicted in Fig. 6C ). Further efforts in obtaining more high-resolution NS5containing structures are necessary to test this hypothesis.",

            "text": "The structure-function studies on primer-dependent viral RdRPs represented by PV 3D are greatly benefited from the fact that polymerase elongation complexes can be readily assembled using RNA construct with a template-primer duplex at least 6-basepair in length, so that the elongation process can be dissected independent of the naturally occurring complicated initiation process [12, 36] . In contrast, de novo viral RdRPs undergo an unstable initiation phase that is analogous to abortive cycling of DNA-dependent RNA polymerases and do not prefer primers longer than two nucleotides [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] , making the in vitro assembly of either initiation complex or elongation complex very challenging for structural studies. One major advance in these RdRPs came from the crystal structure of the bacteriophage phi6 polymerase initiation complex obtained by co-crystallization, which started to reveal how these RdRPs utilize their own priming elements to facilitate initiation. Upon the transition to the elongation phase, the priming element of de novo RdRP is expected to withdraw from the active site and reach its destiny that is unknown to date. Recently, a co-crystal structure of HCV NS5B and end-protected template-primer RNA were obtained using a construct with a deletion in the priming element [42] . The structure doesn't resolve the remainder of the priming platform and very much resembles primer-dependent RdRP-RNA complexes [12, 25, 36] . In a separate study, very stable elongation complex was assembled using wild type HCV NS5B and a dinucleotide primer [43] . However, robust in vitro RdRP assays suitable for assembly of RdRP-RNA complex for structural studies have not been established in flavivirus NS5 to date. The full-length JEV NS5 structure presented here would set up an integral framework for such efforts. Together with recent advances in HCV NS5B, the molecular details of RNA synthesis by de novo RdRPs have begun to unravel.",
