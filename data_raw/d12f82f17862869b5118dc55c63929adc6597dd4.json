In conditions of lymphoid tissue depletion, the liver plays an important role in host defence against viruses. The changes in mice liver infected with HPAI H5N1 virus A/goose/Krasnoozerskoye/627/05 have been studied. It has been shown that the virus persistence in the liver leads to the expression of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-, IL-6) and intracellular proteases (lysozyme, cathepsin D, and myeloperoxidase) by Kupffer cells. Defective antiviral response exacerbates destructive processes in the liver accelerating the development of liver failure.",

When studying the distribution of HPAI H5N1 viruses in tissues of internal organs of infected animals in a number of studies, it was shown that they are able to replicate not only in the lung, but also in extrapulmonary organs including liver, kidney, spleen, and brain [9] [10] [11] . The incubation period typical for HPAI H5N1 is too brief for the occurrence of primary humoral response [12] , and the initial period of the disease occurs with the inhibition of the interferon response and reduction of interferon in the blood [10] . At the same time, many researchers have reported significant depletion of lymphoid tissue as a result of massive apoptosis of lymphocytes under the infection [13, 14] . In this connection, a special role acquires nonspecific protection mechanisms of the organism, particularly cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system, a significant pool of which is concentrated in the lungs and liver [12] . Macrophages can phagocytize viruses, destroying them [12, 15] ; however, in cases of infection with highly pathogenic viruses, including HPAI H5N1, their successful replication occurs in macrophages with the development of cytopathic effect expressed in many organs, which often results in fatal outcome [16] .",

Also, lysozyme-secretory activity was detected in endothelial cells, but their numbers were insignificant compared with Kupffer cells. Probably, the prevalence of cells expressing the lysozyme in the early stages after infection has an adaptive nature in connection with a broad spectrum of activity of this enzyme, which belongs to the enzymes of \"rapid response\" destroying the peptidoglycan envelope viruses and enhancing the effectiveness of phagocytosis [21, 22] .
