The family of PRRs includes secreted, membrane-bound and cytosolic PRRs [1] . Pathogenic organisms use sophisticated strategies to modulate PRR recognition and to control downstream signaling. Accordingly, the human enteropathogen Shigella exploits different mechanisms to hijack the innate immune response. The Shigella genus includes 4 serogroups: S. boydi, S. dysenteriae, S. flexneri and S. sonnei. and S. flexneri are the main serogroups circulating in industrialized and developing countries respectively [2] , but most studies centered on the invasion process of Shigella in vitro and in vivo have been carried out with S. flexneri.",

Once inside the colonic mucosa, shigellae either fuel or dampen the inflammatory response, depending on the step of the invasion process. In epithelial cells, Shigella multiplies freely within the cytoplasm [4] where the cytosolic PRR Nod1 recognizes cell-wall peptidoglycan (PGN) and activates NF-\u03baB [5, 6] . This leads to CXCL8/IL-8 production. IL-8 attracts neutrophils which are required for the clearance of shigellae but which also participate in the destruction of the epithelial barrier [7] . Within epithelial cells, S. flexneri changes its lipopolysaccharide (LPS) structure from a highly inflammatory hexa-acylated lipid A form to a less inflammatory tetra-and tri-acylated lipid A variant [8] . This low-inflammatory LPS is poorly recognized by the PRR Toll-Like-Receptor 4 (TLR4), making macrophages and neutrophils less able to control the infection. Furthermore, in B lymphocytes Shigella induces TLR2-mediated apoptotic death through a mechanism mediated by T3SS, independent of cell invasion [9] . These immune evasion strategies involve TLR2 and TLR4, which are PRRs present on the surface of many cell populations, suggesting that the extracellular step could be critical for successful infection. To gain insight about this poorly explored aspect of Shigella pathogenesis we analyzed the potential role of humoral PRRs, focusing on the possible involvement of Pentraxin 3 (PTX3), which has served as a paradigm of humoral innate immunity [10] .",

Pentraxins are an evolutionarily highly conserved superfamily of proteins. PTX3 is the prototypic long pentraxin, while the short pentraxins include C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid P component (SAP), acutephase proteins in man and mouse respectively. PTX3 is rapidly produced and released by several cell types, e.g. mononuclear phagocytes, dendritic cells (DCs) and neutrophils [11] in response to primary inflammatory signals (e.g. TLR engagement, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2). PTX3 binds selected microorganisms, including Aspergillus fumigatus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa [12, 13] and uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) [14] . It also promotes complement activation, thereby facilitating pathogen recognition by phagocytes [15] . All these features prompted us to investigate whether PTX3 could play a role in Shigella pathogenesis and how and to what extent this PRR is released upon Shigella infection. Our findings highlight that PTX3 is a new player in the Shigella cross-talk with the infected tissues and provide novel insights into the mechanisms of Shigella to control the production of this humoral PRR.",

We observed that PTX3 (50 \u03bcg/mL, 1,1 \u03bcM) opsonized the wild type S. flexneri 5 strain M90T (Fig 1A and 1B) and its plasmidless, non-invasive variant BS176 though to a lesser extent compared to P. aeruginosa (strain PAO1), used as a positive control (12, 17) Epithelial cell invasion and macrophage death [18] are hallmarks of Shigella pathogenesis. We investigated whether PTX3 binding could affect epithelial-cell penetration by Shigella. M90T was incubated with different concentrations of recombinant PTX3 (0.05, 0.5, 5 and 50 \u03bcg/mL) prior to infection of HeLa cells. M90T treated with bovine serum albumin (BSA) (50 \u03bcg/mL) or with a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the T3SS-invasin IpaD (50 \u03bcg/mL), which is involved in bacterial internalization [19] was used in parallel. As shown in Figs 1C and S1A, PTX3 opsonization with only the concentration of 50 \u03bcg/mL significantly decreased the number of intracellular bacteria at 1 h and 2 h post-infection (p.i.) (p< 0.001: PTX3-opsonized M90T vs. M90T plus BSA at 2h) to levels like those induced by the anti-IpaD antibody.",

Likewise, the rate of MoMs cell death, measured through lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, (Fig 1F and S1C Fig) was improved by PTX3 opsonization, as also shown with the anti-IpaD antibody [19, 20] . However, the cell death rate followed the trend as above since it was only increased with PTX3 at the concentration of 50 \u03bcg/mL (p< 0.01: PTX3-opsonized-M90T vs.M90T plus BSA) (S1C Fig) PTX3 is also involved in complement cascade activation and regulation [21] . There is scant and dated literature on Shigella sensitivity to the bactericidal activity of serum [22] , so we set up a bactericidal serum assay against S. flexneri M90T. In preliminary experiments using different serum concentrations (10%; 13%; 17%; 67%) for 30 min at 37\u02daC, we found that M90T was sensitive to concentrations of > 10% pooled normal human serum (NHS). Exposure to 17% NHS killed around 60% of bacteria (Fig 1G) . Addition of low concentrations of PTX3-5-0.5 \u03bcg/mL in the bactericidal serum assay (17% serum) significantly increased bacterial death rate of the bacteria (Fig 1H) .",

CCL5 (RANTES) and IL-1\u03b2 values were similar in BALs and lung homogenates for untreated and PTX3-treated infected animals, while those of TNF-\u03b1 CXCL2/MIP-2 and CXCL1/KC were drastically decreased in both homogenates and BALs of PTX3-treated mice compared to infected-untreated mice (for all, p <0.0001, two-tailed Mann-Whitney test). Furthermore, we quantified the PTX3 levels in sera (Fig 2E) , lung homogenates ( Fig 2F) and BALs (Fig 2G) . In lung homogenates of M90Tonly-infected animals the PTX3 level was lower than that of PTX3-treated infected and uninfected mice (for both, p < 0.0001 two-tailed Mann-Whitney test). Likewise, in BALs and sera the levels of PTX3 were significantly (p < 0.0001, two-tailed Mann-Whitney test) reduced in M90T-only-infected animals with respect to those treated with PTX3. At macroscopic examination (S2 Fig Top) , lungs of infected mice were enlarged, of rubbery consistency, edematous and dusky red in color due to severe hyperemia. The lungs of infected and PTX3-treated animals were macroscopically like the controls, and they appeared aerated, pinkish and spongy.",

Pulmonary phlogosis was characterized by a severe and diffuse neutrophil infiltrate in peribronchial, intraluminal and interstitial areas between alveoli (S2A, S2D and S2G Fig). In contrast, in PTX3-treated infected mice, lungs conserved a physiological architecture with a moderate inflammation of the aerated parenchyma and airways and a low and scattered neutrophilic exudate (S2B, S2E and S2H Fig) . Histopatological scores (S1 Table) As oppose to the protective effect of recombinant PTX3 in the models of P. aeruginosa and S. fumigatus lung infection, Ptx3-deficient mice showed increased mortality and lung colonization [12, 17] . Likewise, Ptx3 -/-mice were more susceptible than the wild type to influenza virus and to UPEC infections [31, 14] . Hence, we assessed whether deficiency of PTX3 could affect the virulence of Shigella. With this aim Ptx3-/-mice were infected via intranasal route with M90T as above and the animals were monitored for a week. We found that Ptx3-/-mice challenged with M90T showed an accelerated death with respect to M90T-infected wild type mice (p < 0.046, two-tailed Mantel-Cox test) as the majority (75%: 20/30) of the animals died after 48 hours p.i. (Fig 3A) At a same time point, only 23% (7/30) wild type infected mice died. The bacterial load in lungs of Ptx3-/-of the infected animals was around ten times more (9,3 x10 5 vs 1,54 x10 5 ) (p <0.0001, two-tailed Mann-Whitney test) than that found in infected wild type animals (Fig 3B) . Likewise, the levels of TNF-\u03b1, CXCL-1 and CXCL-2 in BALs (Fig 3C) and lung homogenates (Fig 3D) were significantly higher (for all, p <0.0001, two-tailed Mann-Whitney test) than those elicited in infected wild type mice.",

PTX3 and TNF-\u03b1 production was monitored in parallel at 1, 3, 6 and 18 h. post-infection (p.i) BS176 induced a significantly higher release of PTX3 than M90T (Fig 4A) , while TNF-\u03b1 release was equivalent with both strains (S4A Fig). To test if invasiveness was correlated to PTX3 release, we introduced another non-invasive strain into our assay. M90T \u0394ipaB lacks the T3SS-secreted invasin IpaB and is thus non-invasive in epithelial cells even if it can still construct the T3SS machinery [19] . PTX3 release induced by M90T \u0394ipaB was similar to that of BS176 (Fig 4A) .",

First, BMDCs were exposed to the invasive and non-invasive strains, previously killed with gentamicin (Fig 4B) . M90Tand BS176-killed bacteria potentially could be phagocytized by DCs; however, the invasive ability of M90T was destroyed. The release of PTX3 did not change in BMDCs infected with killed BS176. In contrast, the PTX3 values induced by killed M90T were significantly higher than those recorded with live M90T. Then, we prevented cell internalization of bacteria by treating the cells with cytochalasin D, which disrupts cytoskeleton organization [36] . In contrast to the previous approach, here invasive and non-invasive bacteria could not be internalized by the cells. Under this condition the PTX3 values induced by M90T were comparable to those of BS176 (Fig 4C) .",

            "text": "We then infected LPS-primed BMDMs as described previously [8] to evaluate the influence of LPS modification on PTX3 release. BMDMs were primed with M90T aLPS (mainly hexaacylated), M90T iLPS (mainly tetra-acylated) and M90T \u0394msbB1 \u0394msbB2 LPS (mainly pentaacylated) and were then infected with M90T at MOI 10. Infected BMDMs primed with iLPS and M90T \u0394msbB1 \u0394msbB2 LPS (both LPSs hypo-acylated) released significantly less PTX3 than those primed with aLPS (Fig 5B) , while the amount of TNF-\u03b1 was similar for all the LPSs, as already shown [8] (S5B Fig). Then, we stimulated the BMDMs (without infection) with the three Shigella LPS (10 ng/mL) as above for 6 h. PTX3 and TNF-\u03b1 yields were lower with iLPS and M90T \u0394msbB1 \u0394msbB2 LPS (both LPSs hypoacylated) than with aLPS (Fig 5C  and S5C Fig). To evaluate the relative role of structural LPS on live bacteria and LPS priming, BMDMs were primed with different LPSs and then infected with M90T \u0394msbB1 \u0394msbB2 (carrying a penta-acylated LPS) instead of M90T (carrying a hexa-acylated LPS) as above. PTX3 release followed the trend observed with M90T, which was consistent with the acylation degree of the LPSs used for priming; however, M90T \u0394msbB1 \u0394msbB2 triggered a significantly lower release of PTX3 compared to M90T for each condition, in accordance with the hypo-acylation degree of its LPS (Fig 5D) . For TNF-\u03b1, the difference between M90T and M90T \u0394msbB1 \u0394msbB2 was maintained, while no significant difference was induced by priming with the various LPSs as for PTX3 (S5D Fig). We then examined whether MoMs (peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages) respond to Shigella infection and LPS stimulation as observed with BMDMs, BMDCs and MoDCs. With this aim, MoMs were infected with either: M90T, BS176, M90T \u0394msbB1 \u0394msbB2 or stimulated with the different LPS and both PTX3 and TNF-\u03b1 production was evaluated. When infected with M90T, BS176 or M90T \u0394msbB1 \u0394msbB2, PTX3 (Fig 5E) and TNF-\u03b1 yields (S5E Fig) were significantly higher with BS176 than with M90T. This result was consistent with that seen in BMDMs, BMDC and MoDCs. Likewise, M90T \u0394msbB1 \u0394msbB2 induced the lowest PTX3 and TNF-\u03b1 production in accordance with its LPS structure and as also observed in BMDMs and MoDCs. In MoMs stimulated with the four forms of LPS (M90T iLPS and aLPS, M90T \u0394msbB1 \u0394msbB2 and E. coli LPS), iLPS and M90T \u0394msbB1 \u0394msbB2 LPS induced the lowest production of PTX3 (Fig 5F) and TNF-\u03b1, just as for BMDMs (S5F Fig) .",

We then used Myd88 -/-, Trif -/-, Irf3 -/and Cd14 -/-BMDMs (Fig 5G) as described for BMDCs. Surprisingly, PTX3 release was abrogated in all knockout BMDMs, indicating that the MyD88-dependent and MyD88-independent pathways are synergistic in the production of PTX3. In accordance with published results [8] we found that the MyD88 pathway was mainly involved in the release of TNF-\u03b1 (S5G and S5H Fig) , with some contribution of the Trif pathway. In Cd14 -/-BMDMs, the values of TNF-\u03b1 were significantly lower than in wild-type cells, while the absence of Irf3 did not impair TNF-\u03b1 release (S5G Fig).

We evaluated whether S. sonnei could, like S. flexneri M90T, induce PTX3 production. BMDCs, MoDCs and BMDMs and MoMs were infected with S. sonnei as with M90T (S6A, S6B, S6C, S6G and S6I Fig) . The involvement of PTX3 in shigellosis prompted us to investigate PTX3 levels in plasma of shigellosis patients. Plasma samples were collected from 31 patients in the acute stage (0-7 days after onset) of culture-proven S. sonnei shigellosis and from 19 healthy subjects and PTX3 levels were measured. Mean PTX3 levels were significantly higher in the patient group (10.4 ng/mL) compared to the control group (2.3 ng/mL) (p = 0.003). The highest levels of PTX3 in patients and controls were 50 ng/mL and 11.75 ng/mL, respectively (Fig 6) . PTX3 levels were significantly higher within 2 days of disease onset than in samples collected later and were positively associated with signs or symptoms related to the severity of shigellosis such as body temperature, number of watery stools per 24 hours and bloody stools (S2 Table) . Among acute cases of S. sonnei shigellosis whose maximal measured body temperature was above 39\u02daC, the mean PTX3 level was much higher than among acute patients whose maximal measured temperature was equal or below 39\u02daC. Similar results were found in regard to presence of blood in stool or when both signs of severity were present, albeit reaching borderline statistical significance (p = 0.05, p = 0.06 respectively).",

In vitro, PTX3 opsonization impairs Shigella internalization in epithelial cells, which are the replicative niche of this pathogen. Likewise, PTX3 binds human cytomegalovirus and inhibits viral-cell fusion and internalization, supposedly by crosslinking of glycoproteins on viral or cellular surface [43] . PTX3 binding to Shigella might inhibit bacteria-host cell contact by interfering sterically with the T3SS machinery thereby affecting bacterial micropinocytosis. Antibodies directed against Shigella surface structures have been shown to prevent epithelial cell internalization [23, 24, 44 and this study] and to promote the opsonophagocytic activity in macrophages [45] . In this light, PTX3 opsonization is reminiscent of some in vitro properties of protective antibodies against Shigella external structures, thus contributing to Shigella eradication before the adaptive immune response is mounted. These features reveal a role of PTX3 as an \"ante-antibody\" [16, 44] in Shigella infections. At a local level of infection, extracellular Shigella that are no longer protected by the host cell cytoplasm, can be targeted by the complement system and easily internalized by macrophages, thus improving the bacterial clearance by the tissues as we observed in lungs of PTX3-treated mice. Indeed, Shigella is sensitive to the serum bactericidal activity (this study), and low concentrations of PTX3 increase the killing activity of complement. It is unsurprising that PTX3 contributes to complement activity only at low concentrations given that it can play a double role, either by activating the three complement pathways or by negatively regulating them through various mechanisms, thereby limiting complementmediated inflammation [21] .",

In these mice, high levels of TNF-\u03b1 and chemokines such as CXCL1 and CXCL2, which act as potent neutrophil chemoattractants [46] , contribute to lung injury. In Ptx3-/-infected mice the inflammatory response seemed to be exacerbated, as the production of TNF-\u03b1, CXCL1 and CXCL2 was significantly higher than in wild type animals. In contrast, in lungs of PTX3-treated infected mice low levels of CXCL1 and CXCL2 were associated with few areas filled by a neutrophilic exudate. PTX3 can also directly contribute to local regulation of the inflammatory reaction based on neutrophil infiltrate as it binds to the adhesion molecule P-selectin and inhibits leukocyte rolling in the endothelium [47] . Although these findings sound very encouraging a definitive result could be achieved through a genetic rescue with transgene expression in Ptx3-/-infected mice or alternatively through administration of recombinant Ptx3 to these animals.",

In clinical trials with a S. dysenteriae 1-attenuated but still invasive vaccine, no PTX3 increase was observed in the plasma of vaccinated individuals, [48] suggesting that only invasion of the epithelial layer by Shigella is not sufficient to rise the amount of PTX3 at the systemic level. In contrast to the attenuated strains, which are likely confined to the epithelial layer, fully virulent shigellae break the integrity of the epithelial barrier and penetrate into the mucosa where they induce severe inflammation characterized by a huge amount of cytokines and inflammatory factors, which can act as signals to promote PTX3 release. In line with this issue, in plasma of patients with shigellosis (infected with S. sonnei) the levels of PTX3 correlate positively with the severity of symptoms, particularly with high temperature and blood in the stools being a reliable parameter of severity of shigellosis, just as in conditions like sepsis [49] and critical infections [50] .",

Moreover, bronchial epithelial cells express and produce PTX3 upon TNF-\u03b1 trigger, but not following bacterial PAMP stimulation (such as LPS) [52] . We could suggest that in natural and experimental shigellosis, epithelial cells cannot or barely produce PTX3 upon initial bacterial contact. PTX3 is likely to be released only when inflammatory signals like TNF-\u03b1 and especially IL-1\u03b2 are present. Upon inflammatory activation, neutrophils release about 25% of their pre-formed PTX3 content in lactoferrin granules [53] .

Involvement of the TriF pathway is evident as the absence of Trif or Irf3 abrogates and massively reduces the PTX3 release in BMDMs and BMDCs, respectively. The role of IRF3 in PTX3 production has already been observed in the context of tissue repair and remodeling [54] .

The impact of LPS composition present on live bacteria on PTX3 and TNF-\u03b1 yield is particularly evident in human cells.

This immune evasion behavior can favor bacterial survival and proliferation, thus allowing tissue colonization during the initial phases of the disease. We suggest that PTX3 could potentially contribute to the eradication of the infection by targeting the poorly explored extracellular phase of the invasion process, which can be considered the \"Achille heels\" of Shigella invasion process.",
