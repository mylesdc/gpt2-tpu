Samples were tested through real-time RT-PCR, virus culture, and sequencing to detect and characterize avian influenza A viruses. Among 4,308 waterfowl tested, 191 (4.4%) were positive for avian influenza A virus, including 74 (1.9%) avian influenza A/H5 subtype. The majority (99%, n = 73) of the influenza A/H5-positive samples were from healthy appearing waterfowl. Multiple subtypes, including H1N1, H1N3, H3N2, H3N6, H3N8, H4N1, H4N2, H4N6, H5N1 (clades  2.2.2, 2.3.2.1a, 2.3.4.2), H5N2, H6N1, H7N9, H9N2, H11N2 and H11N3, H11N6 were detected in waterfowl and environmental samples. Environmental samples tested positive for influenza A viruses throughout the year. Avian influenza viruses, including H5N1 and H9N2 subtypes were also identified in backyard and small-scale raised poultry. Live bird markets could be high-risk sites for harboring the viruses and have the potential to infect naive birds and humans exposed to them.",

Birds raised in larger flocks with >20 birds and the birds raised in backyard flocks (vs. raised in small-scale operations) were less likely to be infected with influenza A/H5 viruses ( Table 2) .",

This suggests that the influenza viruses, including H5N1 (clade 2.2.2) virus, have been maintained in reservoir hosts after their initial introduction into the country. Although a previous study reported very limited circulation of H5N1 in the live bird markets in Bangladesh 21 , we frequently identified the subtype in waterfowl brought into the markets. The majority of the H5N1 subtypes identified in our surveillance were circulating in domestic ducks, which in most cases, did not exhibit clinical illness. This finding is supported by several studies showing that ducks that carry influenza A viruses, including HPAI H5N1 virus, demonstrate very limited clinical signs or remain asymptomatic and shed the virus in feces and respiratory droplets 15, 16, 29, 30 .",

Poultry in larger-sized flocks (>20 birds) usually belonged to small-scale poultry operations; mostly consisting of free-ranging ducks raised for egg production that roam in rivers and other water bodies such as ponds, ditches, other wetlands and rice fields. These birds might acquire influenza A viruses through ingestion of water contaminated by other free ranging waterfowl 34 . Our multivariate analysis suggested that it was less likely to identify H5N1 infected waterfowl in the birds belonging to a larger flock size (>20) ( Table 2) . A study on similar (small scale) waterfowl operations examined egg yolk and found 24% of the samples had antibodies against H5N1, whereas fecal samples yielded very little evidence of active shedding of the virus 34 . Since most of the waterfowl from small scale operations were brought to the market after the end of the egg laying cycle, it is likely that we might have missed their active virus shedding period. Although the samples from small scale raised flocks had more influenza A viruses detections, the backyard raised flocks yielded more diverse subtypes, which might be explained by the diversity of exposure (both the environment and the commercial poultry marketing chain) to the backyard poultry enabling them to contract a variety of influenza A subtypes.",

It is likely the clade 2.3.2.1a virus was either introduced to a completely naive waterfowl population or the new clade was highly virulent for the waterfowl population 35, 36 . Our surveillance identified an influx of H5N1 detections right after the introduction of clade 2.3.2.1a in early 2011. This clade also likely replaced the previously circulating clade 2.2.2 (Figs 2 and 3) 37 . Clade 2.3.2.1a was considered to be one of the several invasive clades of H5N1 virus because of its ability to maintain efficient transmission within multiple species of poultry and wild birds and, subsequently, spread over a large geographic area 38 Europe in recent years 39, 40 . Previous studies have suggested that because clade 2.3.4.2 viruses were only found in domestic chickens that they might have been introduced through poultry trade. Since 2011, the viruses detected in Bangladesh were derived from clade 2.3.2.1, but not from 2.3.4.2 suggesting a lack of sustained circulation of this genetic group of H5N1 viruses in Bangladesh 41 .",

We identified more avian influenza A viruses occurring in colder months (October-March) (Appendix - Fig. 3 ). However, we were unable to identify any distinct seasonality for H5N1 virus occurrences (Appendix - Fig. 4) . Reports from other countries in Asia observed a distinct seasonal pattern of H5N1 occurrence that peaked during autumn and winter months, demonstrating a strong tie between environmental factors and the occurrence of avian influenza in poultry 42, 43 . In Bangladesh, it appears that anthropogenic factors, such as live bird markets and poultry marketing chains might contribute to the introduction of H5N1 infected poultry to the domestic poultry population throughout the year. Although the live bird market closure could be an intervention to interrupt transmission of avian influenza A viruses within the dynamic poultry population maintained within the marketing chain 44 , such interventions are seldom practiced in the urban live bird markets in Bangladesh. The circulation of H5N1 viruses throughout the year also leads to the possibility of co-circulation, co-infection and reassortment within the human and bird population 42 . Perhaps the currently ongoing avian influenza virus surveillance among live bird market poultry workers 45 might help us better understand co-seasonality in humans and birds; if and when the virus co-infects, reassorts, acquires capacity to infect humans and turns out to be a public health concern.",

Identification of influenza viruses in market environmental samples highlights the persistence influenza viruses in the market environment throughout the year. Although rRT-PCR is unable to differentiate between presence of viable virus or only the viral nucleic acid, the steady identification in the market environment suggested sustained contamination of influenza A viruses through birds in the market chain. Through our surveillance and other studies in Asia, it is evident that multiple influenza A virus subtypes were simultaneously present in the live bird markets 1, 8, 10, 47 and there were chances that the birds brought to the market could be co-infected with multiple subtypes and clades. Co-infection of multiple subtypes of influenza A viruses within a host may result in the generation of a reassortant progeny as they are able to exchange their genetic material during the replication process 48 . The samples that we collected from individual birds did not identify more than one subtype co-infecting a waterfowl. While we did not identify an event of co-infection in the market waterfowl samples, a separate phylogenetic analysis of the H5N1 isolates identified from our surveillance demonstrated that the viruses reassorted within the same clade of H5N1, between different clades of H5N1, and between low pathogenic viruses (H9N2) 41 .",

We applied rRT-PCR to detect nucleic acids of influenza A viruses from market environmental samples that might not be associated with viable viruses. rRT-PCR detections were followed by virus culture and other techniques including virus amplification, direct sequencing, and nucleotide 'BLAST' analysis to characterize the viruses. Since many of the environmental samples were positive for NDV RNA, these samples were destroyed to prevent possible isolation of velogenic NDV, a United States Department of Agriculture Select Agent Program policy that applies to the laboratories of the CDC Influenza Division. It was also difficult to culture viruses from environmental samples that contained bacteria that contaminated the eggs used to propagate the viruses. We therefore relied on multiplex PCR subtyping assays to detect virus in environmental samples. Samples with positively identified subtypes were then subjected to virus isolation and full length HA and NA sequence analysis.",

Variables that were statistically associated with influenza A or influenza A/H5 (p < 0.2) in the bivariate X 2 tests of independence analysis, were entered into a multivariate logistic regression model to determine the association with the outcome (i.e. influenza A or influenza A/H5 test positive) and adjusted for confounding effects (i.e. age, bird type, raising pattern) and reported the adjusted odds ratio with 95% CI. Since the bird samples were from surrounding regions of the selected live bird markets, and sometimes, multiple samples were collected from a flock, we calculated robust confidence interval to guard against overestimation of the precision in estimates. We performed backward elimination and covariates with p < 0.05 were retained in the model. Using bivariate X 2 tests, we assessed collinearity for the predictors retained in the final model. Finally, we performed Hosmer-Lemeshow X 2 statistics 65 for goodness-of-fit. We used Seasonal-Trend Decomposition method based on locally weighted regression, as a filtering procedure to decompose monthly influenza A and influenza A/H5 occurrence time series data in to trends, seasonal and reminder components 66 to understand seasonality and trends of the influenza viruses in the poultry brought to the live bird markets. The figures with maps were generated using ArcGIS version 10.4 (http://arcgis.com/). Statistical analysis were performed using STATA version 13.1 (www.stata.com) and R version 3.3.1 (https://cran.r-project.org/).",

However, this report builds on the prior reporting and focuses on the epidemiology of both high and low pathogenic avian influenza viruses identified in the LBMs in Bangladesh from 2007 to 2012. The magnitude and variety of influenza viruses in domestic poultry is an economic, food security and health concern 24-26 . The circulation of influenza A viruses throughout the year could be due to poultry-to-poultry transmission leading to entry into the poultry marketing chain and subsequent spread of disease at a national scale. It is also likely that substantial numbers of avian influenza infected poultry continuously enter the poultry marketing chain and serve as a source of infection for poultry kept in the urban live bird markets. Avian influenza circulation in the urban live bird markets could become sustained as urban live bird market closures and cleaning are not routinely practiced in Bangladesh 27 . The unsold birds and their excreta are likely in contact with uninfected birds brought in to the pool of susceptible birds in the markets and might maintain influenza viruses in the live bird markets.
