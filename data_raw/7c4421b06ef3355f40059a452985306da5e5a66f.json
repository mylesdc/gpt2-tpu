In the present study, we identified differentially expressed proteins in the spleens of chickens infected with the REV-A HLJ07I strain, using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis on samples from time points coinciding with different phases of the REV life cycle. Differentially expressed proteins were identified using one-dimensional liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (1D LC ESI MS/ MS). Comparative analysis of multiple gels revealed that the majority of changes occurred at early stages of infection. In total, 60 protein spots representing 28 host proteins were detected as either quantitatively (false discovery rate [FDR] B0.05 and fold change C2) or qualitatively differentially expressed at least once during different sampling points. The differentially expressed proteins identified in this study included antioxidants, molecular chaperones, cellular metabolism, formation of the cytoskeleton, signal transduction, cell proliferation and cellar aging. The present findings provide a basis for further studies to elucidate the role of these proteins in REV-host interactions. This could lead to a better understanding of REV infection mechanisms that cause immune suppression.",

The REV group includes defective REV-T [32, 33] , non-defective REV-A [11, 75] , chick syncytial virus [14] , duck infectious anemia virus [41] , and spleen necrosis virus (SNV) [66] . REVs cause immunosuppression, runting disease, and lymphoma in a variety of avian hosts, including chickens, turkeys, ducks, geese, pheasants, peafowl, and some other bird species [7] . The immunosuppression caused by REV infection increases the susceptibility to concurrent or secondary bacterial or viral infections and results in poor immune responses to other vaccines [38, 80] . REV can co-infect with other viruses [17] and cause contamination of a variety of poultry biologics [31] . In addition, REV integrates easily into the host genome, and it has been associated with a number of hematopoietic cell tumors [37, 76] . Therefore, REV poses a serious threat to the poultry industry.",

Linear regression analysis of the standard curve was used to estimate the number of viral genomic RNA copies per 100 ng of spleen RNA.

The gel was washed with 70% v/v acetonitrile (ACN) and dried in a SpeedVac Vacuum Concentrator (Bachhofer).

Peptide samples, which were redissolved in 10 ml of 0.5% TFA, were eluted with 50% ACN/0.1% TFA and dried in a SpeedVac Vacuum Concentrator.",

Fig. 2 Representative 2D gel images of REV-infected and uninfected control spleen proteomes at different sampling times. The differentially expressed protein spots are shown in gels with their unique sample spot protein numbers. Arrows indicate the successfully identified protein spots. Please refer to Table 1 for the identities of the proteins in the numbered spots Among the 28 proteins that were differentially expressed, there was a considerable number of proteins that produced multiple spots in 2D gels. In addition, there was some degree of disagreement between the expected and experimental molecular weights for some of the proteins. There could be several reasons for this. First, some proteins exist as different isoforms (and therefore have different pI values) as well as different intermediate stages between translation and attainment of the functionally mature form (i.e., pre-pro-and pro-forms of the protein). This could change the molecular weight and/or the isoelectric point as discussed below. Another reason is possible protein degradation between sample collection and processing. Analysis of the virus load revealed high levels of viral RNA copies in spleen tissue at 7, 14, and 21 dpi, indicating the development of persistent infection. The virus load reflects the status of viral replication and disease evolution, and it has therefore been used as an important marker for disease progression of retroviral infections [57, 74] . Thus, it is conceivable that the virus copy numbers observed in the present study would be indicative of a high level of infection.",

Actin might also participate in endocytosis, with actin rearrangements contributing to the internalization of virus particles [54] . It has been reported that expression of actin, cytoplasmic type 5(ACT5), a third cytoplasmic isoform of the chicken non-muscle actin [6] , is induced in the late stages of IBDV infection [81] .

The identities of spots that were commonly expressed were placed in overlapping areas accordingly. The corresponding spot numbers are shown in parentheses. Refer to Table 1 for the respective protein names Ferritin is a 24-subunit protein composed of two subunit types, termed H and L. The ferritin H subunit has a potent ferroxidase activity that catalyses the oxidation of ferrous iron, whereas ferritin L plays a role in iron nucleation and protein stability [52] . Ferritin plays a role in protecting endothelial cells [3] and tumor cells [10] from oxidant damage. Increasing ferritin levels always accompany or closely precede rapid disease progression in HIV-infected patients [20] .

Several stress proteins have been shown to play roles in the life cycle of a variety of RNA and DNA viruses [58] . In this study, four HSPs were differentially expressed during REV infection. One was HSP60, a highly conserved stress protein that has chaperone functions in regulating apoptosis [26] and eliciting a potent proinflammatory response in cells of the innate immune system [51] . Two others were HSP70 and HSC70, which are involved in apoptosis regulation, signal transduction and eliciting cancer immunity [4, 18, 67] . Hsp70 induction serves to signal to the immune system the presence of an immunologically relevant (dangerous) situation against which an immune reaction should be raised [65] . Both the stress-inducible protein Hsp70 and its constitutive form Hsc70 interact with various viral proteins and may be involved in the assembly of adenovirus, enterovirus and polyomavirus capsid protein complexes [15, 42, 43] . Hsp70 expression is selectively increased following infection with HIV-1 [70] , and it has been suggested that Hsp70 plays a role in the nuclear import of HIV-1 preintegration complexes [1] and early events of infection [28] . The fourth HSP was HSP90, the expression of which was reduced in REV-infected chickens at 7 and 14 dpi. Hsp60, Hsp70, and Hsp90 have been shown to interact with hepatitis B virus reverse transcriptase and to facilitate the initiation of viral DNA synthesis from hepatitis B virus pregenomic RNA [35, 53] . Significant changes in the expression of HSP70 and HSP90 in the spleen of MDVinfected birds has been reported [64] . In line with that, we also observed downregulated expression of HSP90 proteins in REV-infected chickens. However, the possible effects of HSP90 on immune suppression caused by REV needs to be explored in future studies.",

In addition to its role in the ER stress pathway, PDIA3 is a part of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I peptide-loading complex, which is essential for the formation of the final antigen conformation and for export from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell surface [24] . In PDIA3-deficient mice, this complex is impaired and negatively influences presentation of antigenic peptides. This may help tumors to escape from immune surveillance by cytotoxic T cells [23] . PDIA3 aides in dengue virus (DENV) replication by suppressing TNF-a production in human monocytic THP1 cells [47] . Our previous studies showed that TNF-a was also downregulated in REV-infected chickens [78] . Thus, the upregulation of PDIA3 may relevant to tumor formation and contribute to REV-A replication.",

In this study, hypothetical protein RCJMB04_1h13 with ID gi|53126859 was highly increased at 7, 14 and 21 dpi. As reported by Caldwell et al., the most frequent molecular function associated with a domain is 'ATP binding', assigned to protein kinase domains and other domains such as the AAA ATPase family, ABC transporters and others [9] . The upregulation of hypothetical proteins is similar to that of actin in this study, which demonstrates that they may play important roles in REV infection and proliferation.",

Although the functions of the proteins that were identified here were not studied, it is likely that all or some of them are involved in host-virus interactions. One of the limitations of the tools used in this study is the inefficiency of detecting low-abundance proteins or those with low molecular weights, such as cytokines and chemokines. Therefore, a more comprehensive study is needed to elaborate on our present observations and to further explore other proteins that may play a role in the pathogenesis of and host responses to this virus.",
