Phylogenetics, though currently the most popular tool used to characterize the likely host of a virus, can be ambiguous when studying species very distant to known species and when there is very little reliable sequence information available in the early stages of the outbreak of disease. Motivated by an existing framework for representing biological sequence information, we learn sparse, tree-structured models, built from decision rules based on subsequences, to predict viral hosts from protein sequence data using popular discriminative machine learning tools. Furthermore, the predictive motifs robustly selected by the learning algorithm are found to show strong host-specificity and occur in highly conserved regions of the viral proteome.",

However, similarity measures based on genomic/protein sequence or protein structure could be misleading when dealing with species very distant to known, annotated species. Other approaches are based on the fact that viruses undergo mutational and evolutionary pressures from the host. For instance, viruses could adapt their codon bias for a more efficient interaction with the host translational machinery or they could be under pressure of deaminating enzymes (e.g. APOBEC3G or HIV infection). All these factors imprint characteristic signatures in the viral genome. Several techniques have been developed to extract these patterns (e.g., nucleotide and dinucleotide compositional biases, and frequency analysis techniques [3] ). Although most of these techniques could reveal an underlying biological mechanism, they lack sufficient accuracy to provide reliable assessments [4, 5] . A relatively similar approach to the one presented here is DNA barcoding. Genetic barcoding identifies conserved genomic structures that contain the necessary information for classification.",

Prediction accuracy of the classifier is measured by the area under the ROC curve, and is compared to a straightforward nearest-neighbor classifier.

The viral genome usually contains about 1-2 Open Reading Frames (ORF), each coding for protein sequences about 2000-3000 amino acids long. Rhabdoviridae is a family of negative sense single stranded RNA viruses whose genomes typically code for five different proteins: large protein (L), nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), glycoprotein (G), and matrix protein (M). The data consist of 148 viruses in the Picornaviridae family and 50 viruses in the Rhabdoviridae family. For some choice of k and m, we represent each virus as a vector of counts of all possible k-mers, up to mmismatches, generated from the amino-acid alphabet. Each virus is also assigned a label depending on its host: vertebrate/ invertebrate/plant in the case of Picornaviridae, and animal/plant in the case of Rhabdoviridae (see Tables S1 and S2 for the names and label assignments of viruses). Using multiclass Adaboost [6] , we learn an Alternating Decision Tree (ADT) classifier [7] on training data drawn from the set of labeled viruses and test the model on the held-out viruses.",

The nearest neighbor approach to classification then assigns the host of the closest virus to the unknown virus. Intuitively, as this approach uses the whole protein to perform the classification, we expect the accuracy to be very high. This is indeed the case -BLAST, along with a 1-nearest neighbor classifier, successfully classifies all viruses in the Rhabdoviridae family, and all but 3 viruses in the Picornaviridae family.

Specifically, if the data largely consist of nearly-similar viral sequences (e.g. different sequence reads from the same virus), the learned ADT model would overfit to insignificant variations within the data (even if 10fold cross validation were employed), making generalization to new subfamilies of viruses extremely poor. To check for this, we hold out viruses corresponding to a particular subfamily (see Tables S1 and S2 for subfamily annotation of the viruses used), run 10-fold cross validation on the remaining data and compute the expected fraction of misclassified viruses in the held-out subfamily, averaged over the learned ADT models. Tables 1 and 2 list the mean classifier validation error and number of viruses for subfamilies in Picornaviridae and Rhabdoviridae. Note that the Picornaviridae data used consist mostly of Cripaviruses; thus, the high misclassification rate when holding out Cripaviruses could also be attributed to a significantly lower sample size used in learning. The poorly classified subfamilies contain a very small number of viruses, showing that the method is strongly generalizable on average.",

            "text": "We can now BLAST the selected k-mers in Figure 3 against the GenBank database [10] of Picornaviridae. It is interesting to point out that most of these motifs are found in regions with an essential biological function. For instance, the motif 'DDLGQNPDGEDC' occurs in a highly conserved region in the 2C protein [11] . The 2C protein functions as ATPase and GTPase [12, 13] , is involved in membrane-binding [14, 15] and RNA-binding activities [16] . In particular, this motif forms part of a larger NTP-binding pattern that is found not only in picornaviruses but in DNA viruses (papova-, parvo-, geminiviruses, and P4 bacteriophage) and RNA viruses (coma-and nepoviruses). While genes coding for these proteins occur in a variety of viruses, this specific motif aligned strongly with proteins from vertebrate viruses like human cosavirus, saffold virus and Theilers murine encephalomyelitis virus. The k-mer 'AHLKDELRKKEK' occurs in a region coding for RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, a protein found in all RNA viruses essential for direct replication of RNA from an RNA template. This motif strongly aligned with proteins from hepatitis A virus, Ljungan virus and rhinovirus isolated in humans and ducks, while the k-mer 'AGKTRVFSAGPQ' occurs in a functionally similar region for invertebrate viruses. Finally, the k-mers 'ASAFHRGRLRIV' and 'KVQVNSQPFQQG' occur in regions coding for viral capsid protein. This motif strongly aligned with proteins from Human parechovirus, Drosophila C virus and Cricket paralysis virus. Variations in the amino acid sequence of these proteins are important both for determining viral host-specificity and contributing to antigenic diversity. For Rhabdoviridae, the motif 'GLPLKASETW' is found highly conserved in the RNA polymerase in the L protein of plant viruses (see Figures S1, S2 ).",

Thus, given that partial genomic sequence is normally the only information available, we could achieve quicker bioinformatic characterization by focusing on the selection and amplification of these highly predictive regions of the genome, instead of full genomic characterization and contiguing. Moreover, in contrast with generic approaches currently under use, such a targeted amplification approach might also speed up the process of sample preparation and improve the sensitivity for viral discovery.",

While we have focused on virus host in this work, ADTs could be applied straightforwardly to the barcoding problem, replacing the host label with a species label. Additional constraints on the loss function would have to be introduced to capture the desire for suitable flanking sites of each selected k-mer in order to develop the universal PCR primers important for a wide application of the discovered barcode [18] .",

This tree-structured representation of the model will play an important role in specifying how Adaboost, the learning algorithm, greedily searches over an exponentially large space of binary-valued functions.
