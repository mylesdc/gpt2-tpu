We analyzed 10 years of electronic health records-a total of 69.4 million blood tests-to see how well standard rule-mining techniques can anticipate test results based on patient age and gender, recent diagnoses, and recent laboratory test results. We evaluated rules according to their positive and negative predictive value (PPV and NPV) and area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (ROC AUCs). Using a stringent cutoff of PPV and/or NPV$0.95, standard techniques yield few rules for sendout tests but several for in-house tests, mostly for repeat laboratory tests that are part of the complete blood count and basic metabolic panel. Most rules were clinically and pathophysiologically plausible, and several seemed clinically useful for informing pre-test probability of a given result. But overall, rules were unlikely to be able to function as a general substitute for actually ordering a test. Improving laboratory utilization will likely require different input data and/or alternative methods.",

We fixed some of the metrics (see below) that were used in building the final tree. The CART grows classification tree in two stages. In stage one, a tree is grown by finding a feature which best splits the data into two groups. Splitting is done only if the overall ''impurity,'' the number of outcomes different from the majority (e.g., a ''low'' response alongside many ''normal'' responses), decreases, above some threshold (the ''complexity parameter;'' 0.01). Then, in top-down fashion, these two subgroups are further divided in a recursive manner until the subgroups reach a minimum size (minsplit = 20 records) or until no further improvement can be made. The resulting tree may overfit the training data. To avoid this, crossvalidation (xval = 10; 10-fold cross-validation) was used in the second stage by pruning the tree.

These were mostly components of the complete blood count (CBC) and metabolic panels. Interestingly, the predictive power of these rules was almost exclusively based on a previous measurement of the test in question: in other words, the best rules were for repeat tests, and the best predictor of a result being normal or abnormal was whether it had been normal or abnormal within the previous seven days. For example, the NPV for a low red blood cell count was 0.95 (with PPV = 0.75), with a rule that depended most on the previous red blood cell count also having been low, and the PPV for high total calcium was 0.98 (NPV = 0.76) and based exclusively on the previous total calcium having been high.",

Examples included low white blood cell count (WBC; PPV = 0.97, NPV = 0.79), platelet count (0.95, 0.88), and serum sodium (0.96, 0.65), and high total calcium (0.99, 0.67), mean corpuscular volume (0.98, 0.84), and iron (0.97, 0.56) all of which were determined almost exclusively from the previous value being low or high (Table 1) . Overall, there was good agreement in PPV between GLM and CART for tests for which both methods found rules, but CART outperformed GLM noticeably in NPV (Fig. 2 ).",

Most of these studies were limited in scope to predicting risk of a particular diagnosis. Harper [22] compared four classification techniques (regression, CART, artificial neural networks, and discriminant analysis) on four different datasets and concluded that there was no obvious best choice for their data; while CART performed best, regression was fastest and nearly as good. Similar comparative studies on coronary artery disease [20] and Alzheimer disease [23] indicated that newer algorithms such as ANN and random forests [24] have little advantage over simpler, more traditional approaches. Also, the utility and limitations of these approaches for predicting laboratory results (as opposed to diagnoses) are unclear. However, while CART is both a top performer and overcomes GLM's problem with missing values, it is also more computationally intensive and potentially less sensitive to simple algebraic relationships among features (e.g., among sodium, chloride and bicarbonate and the anion gap). Therefore we chose GLM as a well-understood approach with strong performance and excellent speed, and CART as the bestperforming complementary approach for purposes of comparison.",

However, as long as the setting in which such rules would be applied is the substantially similar to that in which they were found, selection bias would have little if any effect on finding rules.

One way to approach this question is by considering the positive and negative predictive value of each rule (PPV and NPV). These metrics are in contrast to sensitivity and specificity, by which rules are often measured but which do not incorporate disease prevalence in spite of its importance to clinical decision-making. A PPV of 0.95 means that when a rule suggests that the test result will be abnormal, the result actually will be abnormal 95 percent of the time. A NPV of 0.95 means that when a rule suggests that the test result will be normal, the result actually will be normal 95 percent of the time. We found rules with PPV and/or NPV$0.95 (by GLM) for only two tests that are sendouts at our hospital-one of which is ceruloplasmin, which we have previously suggested is overordered via chart review [25] . In contrast, for in-house tests we found over a dozen such rules. Interestingly, the main determinant for rules for in-house tests was a normal or abnormal result for the same test within the previous seven days. Although in this study we did not set out explicitly to make a statement about repeat laboratory testing, the appropriateness of which has been investigated elsewhere [4] , these results suggest that repeat laboratory testing within one week does not always add information that could not have been anticipated from the previous result. Refining this observation using the same unbiased approach we have followed here is potentially an area for future investigation.",

Thus, while prediction that a result will be abnormal may be correct 95 percent of the time, which may be good enough to discourage repeat ordering, prediction that a result will be normal may not be so dependable. Therefore use of a rule depends on the subtle distinction of whether the clinical question is ''will the result be abnormal'' vs. ''will the result be normal.'' Second, we note that no rules with such strong performance were found for the majority of our sendout or in-house tests by either of our two complementary approaches. Thus while the rules we found can inform clinical decision-makers, the information they provide rarely replaces the information obtained from actually performing these tests.",
