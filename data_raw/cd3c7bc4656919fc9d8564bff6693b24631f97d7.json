            "text": "Using multiple viral systems, and performing silencing approaches, overexpression approaches, and experiments in knockout cells, we report, for the first time, that interferon (IFN)-induced protein 44 (IFI44) positively affects virus production and negatively modulates innate immune responses induced after viral infections. Moreover, IFI44 is able to rescue poly(I\u00b7C)-and IFN-mediated inhibition of virus growth. Furthermore, we report a novel interaction of IFI44 with the cellular factor FK506-binding protein 5 (FKBP5), which binds to cellular kinases such as the inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B (IB) kinases (IKK\u2423, IKK\u2424, and IKK). Importantly, in the presence of FKBP5, IFI44 decreases the ability of IKK\u2424 to phosphorylate IB\u2423 and the ability of IKK to phosphorylate interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3), providing a novel mechanism for the function of IFI44 in negatively modulating IFN responses. Remarkably, these new IFI44 functions may have implications for diseases associated with excessive immune signaling and for controlling virus infections mediated by IFN responses. IMPORTANCE Innate immune responses mediated by IFN and inflammatory cytokines are critical for controlling virus replication. Nevertheless, exacerbated innate immune responses could be detrimental for the host and feedback mechanisms are needed to maintain the cellular homeostasis. In this work, we describe a completely novel function for IFI44 in negatively modulating the innate immune responses induced after viral infections. We show that decreasing IFI44 expression by using small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) or by generating knockout (KO) cells impairs virus production and increases the levels of IFN responses. Moreover, we report a novel interaction of IFI44 with the cellular protein FKBP5, which in turn interacts with kinases essential for type I and III IFN induction and signaling, such as the inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B (IB) kinases IKK\u2423, IKK\u2424, and IKK. Our data indicate that binding of IFI44 to FKBP5 decreased the phosphorylation of IRF-3 and IB\u2423 mediated by IKK and IKK\u2424, respectively, providing a likely explanation for the function of IFI44 in negatively modulating IFN responses. These results provide new insights into the induction of innate immune responses and suggest that IFI44 is a new potential antiviral target for reducing virus replication.",

Production of type I and III IFNs is crucial for the induction of antiviral responses restricting virus replication, since type I and III IFNs trigger the transcription of IFNstimulated genes (ISGs) (2), many of them having antiviral activity (3) . However, excessive production of IFN and/or other cytokines can be deleterious to the host. Therefore, in contrast to the classical role of ISGs in antiviral activity, several ISGs play regulatory functions to control excessive antiviral responses (4, 5) .",

IRF-3 and IRF-7 activation involves the phosphorylation of these proteins by the kinases TANK-binding kinase-1 (TBK-1) and IKK (7) . This posttranslational IRF-3 and IRF-7 phosphorylation allows IRF dimerization and nuclear translocation and transcription of IFN and proinflammatory genes (8) . (ii) In unstimulated cells, NF-B dimers are sequestered in the cytoplasm by a family of inhibitors, named IBs, which become phosphorylated. The multisubunit IB kinase (IKK) responsible for IB phosphorylation contains two catalytic subunits, IKK\u2423 and IKK\u2424, both being able to phosphorylate IB, and IKK\u2425, which is a regulatory subunit (9) . Phosphorylation of IB inhibitors leads to their degradation by the proteosome, allowing NF-B to migrate to the nucleus and activate IFN and proinflammatory cytokine expression (10) . FK506-binding protein 5 (FKBP5) is an immunophilin that interacts with IKK\u2423, IKK\u2424, and IKK\u2425 and facilitates IKK complex assembly, leading to increased IKK\u2423 and IKK\u2424 kinase activity, NF-B activation, and IFN production (11) . In addition, it was proposed previously that FKBP5 interacts with IKK (12) .",

We then performed experiments knocking down, knocking out, and overexpressing IFI44 to determine its effect on innate immune responses and on the replication of different ssRNA viruses such as IAV, LCMV, and VSV. Furthermore, using mass spectrometry and coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP), we demonstrated an interaction of IFI44 with the cellular factor FKBP5. We show that in the presence of FKBP5, IFI44 overexpression leads to a decrease in the ability of IKK and IKK\u2424 to phosphorylate IRF-3 and IB\u2423, respectively, likely leading to decreased IFN responses mediated by IRF-3 and NF-B. Notably, this is the first time that IFI44 has been reported to negatively modulate antiviral responses induced by multiple viral systems. Importantly, IFI44 could be used as a potential target to regulate innate immune responses after viral infection to control a negative exacerbated immune reaction that could have deleterious consequences for the host or to control the cytokine storm induced during viral infection that has been shown to be responsible, at least in part, for the pathogenesis of some viruses, such as IAVs (22, 23) or coronaviruses (24) .",

            "text": "In a previous transcriptomic analysis, we found that IFI44 was induced in IAV-infected cells (25) . IFI44 has been previously described as an ISG (16, 18) ; however, its functions are mostly unknown. To further confirm that IFI44 is an ISG, human 293T cells were treated with two different concentrations (150 and 750 U/ml) of universal IFN-\u2423 for 12 h, and the levels of IFI44 upregulation were assessed by Western blotting using an antibody (Ab) specific for IFI44 (Fig. 1A) . To show that this antibody is specific for IFI44, 293T cells were transfected with a pCAGGS plasmid expressing the IFI44 gene fused to a hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag or with empty pCAGGS plasmid (Fig. 1A) . The IFI44-specific antibody recognized the IFI44 protein expressed from plasmid-transfected cells as well as the endogenous IFI44 isoform in cells treated with both concentrations of IFN-\u2423, with the IFI44 protein expression levels being higher in the cells treated with the largest amount of IFN-\u2423 (Fig. 1A) . These data confirm that IFI44 expression is induced in IFN-\u2423-treated cells in a dose-dependent manner. Next, we evaluated whether IFI44 is induced after IAV infection (Fig. 1B) reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) (Fig. 1B) . Increased levels of IFI44 mRNA were detected after IAV infection, reaching a maximum (up to 120-fold higher than the levels seen with mock-infected cells) at 48 hpi. These data indicated that IFN-\u2423 treatment and IAV PR8 infection induce the expression of IFI44. IFI44 silencing decreases virus production. To study whether IFI44 expression affects IAV production, silencing (loss-of-function) experiments were performed. Using two different small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), IFI44 mRNA was silenced in A549 cells by more than 85% as determined by RT-qPCR ( Fig. 2A) . To confirm that the IFI44-specific siRNAs knocked down IFI44 expression at the protein level, A549 cells transfected with the plasmid expressing IFI44-HA were silenced with the two different IFI44 siRNAs or with the nontargeted (NT) siRNA (Fig. 2B) . Western blotting using an anti-HA-specific antibody showed a reduction of about 25-fold in the overall levels of IFI44 in IFI44silenced cells using the two different specific IFI44 siRNAs (Fig. 2B) . These data indicated that the IFI44 siRNAs efficiently knocked down the expression of IFI44 at the mRNA ( Fig. 2A) and protein (Fig. 2B ) levels.",

However, some of them are known to regulate the antiviral response through a negative-feedback mechanism (4, 26) . Taking into account that IAV and LCMV are sensitive to IFN responses (3, (27) (28) (29) and that IFI44 silencing negatively modulates the production of these viruses ( Fig. 2C and D), we hypothesized that IFI44 was negatively modulating IFN responses. To evaluate this hypothesis, A549 cells were silenced with the NT siRNA control or with an siRNA specific for IFI44 and were then infected with IAV, r3LCMV-GFP/Gluc, recombinant VSV-GFP (rVSV-GFP), or SeV to induce host antiviral responses. As expected, after viral infections, high levels of IFI44 (see Fig. S1A in the supplemental material) and of IFN-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 2 (IFIT2) (an ISG) (Fig. 3A) were induced. Interestingly, the levels of IFIT2 induction measured after the virus infections were 2.5-fold to 6-fold higher in the IFI44-silenced cells than in the NT-silenced control cells (Fig. 3A) . Importantly, at least in the IAV-infected and r3LCMV-GFP/Gluc-infected cells, the higher level of IFIT2 induction in the IFI44-silenced cells was not due to higher virus titers, as it was found that the virus titers were lower in the IFI44-siRNA-transfected cells ( Fig. 2C and D) .",

Human A549 cells were transfected with two different IFI44-siRNAs or with the pCAGGS plasmid expressing IFI44. At 36 h posttranscription (hpt), cells were transfected with poly(I\u00b7C) or treated with exogenous IFN-\u2423 to induce an antiviral state and were then infected with rVSV-GFP (MOI of 0.1), which is sensitive to the antiviral state induced by poly(I\u00b7C) and IFN treatments (25, 31) . Then, rVSV-GFP production was analyzed at 24 hpi. In mock-treated cells, rVSV-GFP grew with high titers (\u03fe10 7 PFU/ml) ( Fig. 3E and F). In contrast, virus titers were decreased more than 250-fold in poly(I\u00b7C)- transfected and IFN-\u2423-treated cells, consistent with the induction of a host antiviral state in these cells ( Fig. 3E and F). Interestingly, in IFI44-silenced cells transfected with poly(I\u00b7C) or treated with IFN, the rVSV-GFP titers were at least 5-fold lower than the titers in NT siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 3E ). In contrast, rVSV-GFP titers were 3-fold higher in cells overexpressing IFI44 than in cells transfected with empty plasmid (Fig. 3F) .

Since the role of IFI44 in regulating innate immune responses has not been described previously, we analyzed host cell proteins binding to IFI44. To that end, human 293T cells were transiently transfected with a plasmid expressing IFI44-HA or with plasmids expressing HA-tagged irrelevant proteins (IFI6 and IFI27) as negative controls. Next, IFI44-, IFI6-, and IFI27-associated complexes were purified by the use of anti-HA affinity columns and eluted. Mass spectrometry analysis demonstrated that in cells overexpressing IFI44-HA, IFI44 was immunoprecipitated with a high (90%) level of coverage and with 39 distinct peptides identified, whereas this protein was not detected in cells transfected with the empty plasmid or in the cells transfected with plasmids expressing IFI6-HA and IFI27-HA proteins that were used as controls. The second most highly represented protein in the samples, which was specifically associated with IFI44-HA, but not with IFI6-HA and IFI27-HA, was endogenous FKBP5. FKBP5 was detected with a level of coverage higher than 57%, and 24 peptides were identified.",

To analyze whether the interaction of IFI44 with FKBP5 disrupts the interaction of FKBP5 with these kinases, human 293T cells were transiently cotransfected with pCAGGS plasmids expressing FKBP5-FLAG and MYC-IKK\u2424 (Fig. 5E ) or expressing FKBP5-FLAG and MYC-IKK (Fig. 5F) in the presence or absence of the pCAGGS plasmid expressing IFI44-HA.

Tissue culture supernatants from the experiment shown in Fig. 6B were used to treat fresh A549 cells for 24 h. Then, cells were infected with rVSV-GFP, and at 24 hpi, the levels of GFP were quantified using a microplate reader (Fig. 6D) and fluorescence was observed under a fluorescence microscope (Fig. 6E) . As expected, rVSV-GFP replication, as determined by GFP expression, was lower in cells treated with tissue culture supernatants from IKK-transfected cells than in cells treated with empty-plasmid-transfected cell supernatants (Fig. 6D and E) , consistent with the idea of IFN production in cells overexpressing IKK. Interestingly, the levels of rVSV-mediated GFP expression were lower in the cells treated with the supernatants coming from pCAGGS-IKK-transfected cells which were silenced with the two IFI44 siRNAs than in the cells treated with the supernatants coming from pCAGGS-IKK-transfected cells which were silenced with the NT control siRNA (Fig. 6D and E) . These data correlate with our findings that IFI44 silencing increases IFN responses after IKK overexpression (Fig. 6B) .",

            "text": "It has been reported previously that signaling pathways leading to type I IFN production involve the phosphorylation of IRF-3 by IKK (7) and the phosphorylation of IkB\u2423 by IKK\u2424 (36) . IFI44 did not show any ability to phosphorylate IRF-3 and IkB\u2423 in kinase assays (data not shown). To analyze whether IFI44 negatively regulates IKK\u2424 and IKK activity and whether any such regulation was dependent on FKBP5 expression, cells were silenced for IFI44 or for FKBP5 and were then transiently transfected with pCAGGS plasmids expressing His-IKK or MYC-IKK\u2424, IFI44-HA, and FKBP5-FLAG. At 24 hpt, IKK and IKK\u2424 complexes were purified with anti-His and anti-MYC antibodies, respectively, and these complexes were assayed in kinase assays using purified IRF-3 (for IKK complexes) and purified IkB\u2423 (for IKK\u2424 complexes) as substrates. Expression of IKK and IKK\u2424 ( Fig. 7A and B , respectively) and of FKBP5 and IFI44 (data not shown) was confirmed in all the experiments. Silencing of FKBP5 was confirmed at the mRNA level (Fig. S5A) and at the protein level (Fig. S5B) . Total and phosphorylated levels of IRF-3, IKK, IkB\u2423, and IKK\u2424 were analyzed by Western blotting using specific antibodies ( Fig. 7A and B, respectively) . pIRF-3 and pIkB\u2423 were observed when IKK and IKK\u2424 were expressed, in contrast to the cells transfected with an empty plasmid control, indicating that IKK and IKK\u2424 were responsible for IRF-3 and IkB\u2423 phosphorylation, respectively, in those assays. Interestingly, when IFI44 was expressed together with FKBP5 and IKK or IKK\u2424, the levels of pIRF-3 and pIkB\u2423 (normalized to the levels of IKK and IKK\u2424 present in the complexes) were 3-fold to 4-fold lower than when IFI44 was not expressed. However, the levels of nonphosphorylated IRF-3 and IkB\u2423 were similar in both cases ( Fig. 7A and B, lower panels) . Interestingly, when FKBP5 was not present in the complexes, the presence or absence of IFI44 had no effect on the levels of IRF-3 and IkB\u2423 phosphorylation (Fig. 7A and B, lower panels) . Importantly, expression of IFI44 did not significantly affect the expression levels of IKK and IKK\u2424 ( Fig. 7A and B , respectively, top panels) but did affect the levels of phosphorylated (phospho-) IKK and phospho-IKK\u2424 ( Fig. 7A and B , respectively, middle panels), measured as hallmarks of activation (37, 38) . These results suggest that IFI44 negatively affects IKK\u2424 and IKK kinase activities and that this effect is likely dependent on the binding of IFI44 to FKBP5. This negative outcome of the effect of IFI44 on IKK\u2424 and IKK activities most likely represents the mechanism used by IFI44 to regulate IFN responses.",

            "text": "In this work, we describe a completely novel role for IFI44 in negatively regulating innate immune responses induced by infection with different viruses, including IAV, VSV, SeV, and LCMV (Fig. 8) . After virus infections, type I and III IFNs are produced, through a mechanism involving the recognition of virus components by PRRs such as RIG-I, MDA-5, and TLRs (6). This recognition leads to the activation of kinases such as IKK, which phosphorylates and activates the transcription factors IRF-3 and IRF-7 (7), and the activation of IKK\u2423 and IKK\u2424, which phosphorylate IB\u2423, leading to IB\u2423 degradation and NF-B activation (10). IRF-3, IRF-7, and NF-B are critical for the induction of expression of type I and III IFNs (Fig. 8) (1). Type I and III IFNs signal through the IFN-\u2423/\u2424 receptor (IFNAR) and IFN-receptor (IFNR1), respectively, leading to STAT1 and STAT2 phosphorylation and activation by the tyrosine kinases JAK1 and TYK2 (2) (Fig. 8 ). In addition, STAT1 is phosphorylated by IKK during IFN signaling, this step being critical for the induction of IFN antiviral responses (14, 15) (Fig. 8) . Activation of STAT1/STAT2 leads to the induction of ISGs with antiviral activities (2), including IFI44 (18, 19) (Fig. 8) . In this work, we describe a completely novel interaction of IFI44 with FKBP5 ( Fig. 5A to C) , which in turn interacts with IKK\u2423, IKK\u2424, and IKK kinases (Fig. 5E and F) (11) . In the presence of FKBP5, IFI44 decreases the ability of IKK to phosphorylate IRF-3 (and most probably IRF-7 and STAT1) (Fig. 7A and data not shown) and the ability of IKK\u2424 to phosphorylate IkB\u2423 (Fig. 7B) . As a consequence, IFN production ( Fig. 3C ; see also Fig. 6B ), IFN signaling (Fig. 3D) , and NF-B activation (Fig. 6A) are increased in the absence of IFI44, and therefore IFN responses are induced to a higher extent. Furthermore, we report that IFI44 silencing negatively affects virus production ( Fig. 2C and D) , most probably because of its effects in negatively modulating innate immune responses.",

In contrast to the general idea that ISGs display antiviral functions, here, we show novel data suggesting that knocking down the expression of IFI44 decreased viral production of different viruses such as IAV and LCMV (Fig. 2C and D) and that IFI44 negatively This recognition leads to the activation of kinases such as IKK, which phosphorylates and activates transcription factors IRF-3 and IRF-7, and IKK\u2423 and IKK\u2424, which phosphorylates IB\u2423, leading to IB\u2423 degradation and NF-B activation. IRF-3, IRF-7, and NF-B are critical for the induction of expression of type I and III IFNs. Type I and III IFNs signal through IFNAR and IFNLR1, respectively, leading to STAT1 and STAT2 phosphorylation. In addition, STAT1 is phosphorylated by IKK during IFN signaling, which is the step critical for the induction of IFN antiviral responses. Activation of STAT1/STAT2 leads to the induction of ISGs with antiviral activities, including IFI44. IFI44 interacts with FKBP5, which in turn interacts with IKK\u2423, IKK\u2424, and IKK kinases. In the presence of FKBP5, IFI44 decreases the ability of IKK to phosphorylate IRF-3 (and, most probably, IRF-7 and STAT1) and the ability of IKK\u2424 to phosphorylate IkB\u2423. As a consequence, the levels of IRF-3 activation, NF-B activation, and IFN production (A) are decreased in the presence of IFI44, leading to diminished antiviral responses (B) after virus infections. Fig. S2 and S4) , even under conditions in which we did not observe a complete silencing of IFI44 (Fig. 1) . This is not the first study reporting cellular factors, including ISGs, which negatively regulate IFN responses. For example, it has been shown that the ISGs IFI35 (39) and ISG56/IFIT1 (40); the ubiquitin ligases RING finger protein-5 (RNF-5) (41), RNF-125 (42) , and RANBP2-type and C3HC4-type zinc finger containing 1 (RBCK1) (43) ; and other cellular factors such as suppressor of IKBKE (SIKE) (44) and A20 (45) negatively modulate innate immune responses, although the modulation occurs through mechanisms and targets different from those described in this study for IFI44. An excessive level of production of IFN and other cytokines could be deleterious to the host, and negative-feedback mechanisms such as those provided by these ISG proteins are needed.",

It is known that IAV and LCMV, like other viruses, are sensitive to the antiviral states induced by IFN (3, (27) (28) (29) and that many ISGs such as Myxovirus resistance protein 1 (MX1), IFN-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITM), oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS), protein kinase R (PKR), IFIT1, and IFIT2 restrict IAV replication (3). According to the potent effect of IFN in restricting virus replication, viruses encode proteins which counteract innate immune responses induced by the host, allowing the virus to replicate more efficiently in the cells, including such proteins as IAV nonstructural 1 (NS1) protein (46) and LCMV nucleoprotein (NP) (47) .

            "text": "In addition, we have shown for the first time that IFI44 interacts with the immunophilin FKBP5 (Fig. 5 ). Immunophilins comprise a family of chaperones that are members of a highly conserved family of proteins all of which are cis-trans peptidyl-prolyl isomerases (49, 50) . FKBP5 binds IKK\u2423, IKK\u2424, and IKK\u2425 and facilitates IKK complex assembly, leading to increased IKK\u2423 and IKK\u2424 kinase activity (11) . The phosphorylation of IB inhibitors mediated by IKK\u2424 and IKK\u2423 leads to their degradation, allowing NF-B to migrate to the nucleus and activate IFN and proinflammatory cytokine expression (10) . In addition, it has been proposed that FKBP5 interacts with IKK (12) , an interaction that was confirmed in this work (Fig. 5F ). IKK phosphorylates the transcription factors IRF-3 and IRF-7 (7), leading to their activation and to induction of IFN (6) . Considering that IFI44 interacts with FKBP5 ( Fig. 5A to C) and that FKBP5 interacts with IKK\u2423, IKK\u2424, and IKK kinases ( Fig. 5E and F) (11) , we analyzed whether the interaction of IFI44 with FKBP5 affects the kinase activity of IKK\u2424 and/or IKK. Our data suggest that IFI44 does not disrupt the interaction of FKBP5 with IKK\u2424 and IKK ( Fig. 5E and F) . Notably, in the presence of FKBP5 (but not in its absence), the levels of pIB\u2423 and pIRF-3 were lower in the presence of IFI44 (Fig. 7A and B) , strongly supporting the results indicating that IFI44 negatively affects the kinase activities of IKK\u2424 and IKK and that, for this function, FKBP5 needs to be expressed. These data identify a novel mechanism for the negativefeedback modulation of IFN responses by IFI44.",

At 24 hpt, IKK (A) and IKK\u2424 (B) complexes were purified with anti-His and anti-MYC antibodies, respectively, and these complexes were assayed in kinase assays using IRF-3 (for the IKK complexes shown in panel A) and IkB\u2423 (for the IKK\u2424 complexes shown in panel B) as substrates. The levels of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of IRF-3 (panel A, bottom blot) and IkB\u2423 (panel B, third and fourth blots) were analyzed by Western blotting using specific antibodies. Levels of IKK were analyzed using an anti-His-specific antibody (A, first blot) and anti-pIKK (A, second blot), and levels of IKK\u2424 were analyzed using an anti-MYC-specific antibody (B, first blot) and anti-pIKK\u2424 (B, second blot). Western blots were quantified by densitometry using ImageJ software (v1.46). Protein expression levels in cells expressing IKK (A) and IKK\u2424 (B) alone were assigned a value of 100% for comparisons with the levels of expression in cells expressing the different combinations of IKK/IFI44/FKBP5 (A) or IKK\u2424/IFI44/FKBP5 (B) (numbers are indicated below each plot). pIRF-3 and IRF-3 levels (observed in the same bottom blot in panel A) and pIkB\u2423 and IkB\u2423 (third and bottom blot in panel B) are represented with numbers below each blot. Levels of pIRF-3 and pIkB\u2423 normalized to the levels of IKK and IKK\u2424 are represented in the bottom graphs in panels A and B, respectively.
