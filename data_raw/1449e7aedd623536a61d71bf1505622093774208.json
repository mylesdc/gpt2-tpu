Although FCoV is prevalent among cats; the fastidious nature of type I FCoV to grow on cell culture has limited further studies on tissue tropism and pathogenesis of FCoV. While several studies reported serological evidence for FCoV in Malaysia, neither the circulating FCoV isolated nor its biotypes determined. This study for the first time, describes the isolation and biotypes determination of type I and type II FCoV from naturally infected cats in Malaysia. Findings: Of the total number of cats sampled, 95% (40/42) were RT-PCR positive for FCoV. Inoculation of clinical samples into Crandell feline kidney cells (CrFK), and Feline catus whole fetus-4 cells (Fcwf-4), show cytopathic effect (CPE) characterized by syncytial cells formation and later cell detachment. Differentiation of FCoV biotypes using RT-PCR assay revealed that, 97.5% and 2.5% of local isolates were type I and type II FCoV, respectively. These isolates had high sequence homology and phylogenetic similarity with several FCoV isolates from Europe, South East Asia and USA. Conclusions: This study reported the successful isolation of local type I and type II FCoV evident with formation of cytopathic effects in two types of cell cultures namely the CrFK and Fcwf-4 , where the later cells being more permissive. However, the RT-PCR assay is more sensitive in detecting the antigen in suspected samples as compared to virus isolation in cell culture. The present study indicated that type I FCoV is more prevalent among cats in Malaysia.",

The isolates replicate in CrFK and Fcwf-4 cell cultures with the formation of CPE comparable to reference strain. Phylogenetic analyses show that majority of the local FCoV isolates belongs to type I and rarely of type II biotypes. Additionally, the study revealed that, Malaysia FCoV s is phylogenetically related with isolates from South East Asia, USA and UK, signifying possible common ancestral origin.",

The sampled cats comprises of 28 male and 14 females with age range from 6 month to 5 years. All cats came from neibouring areas within Klang valley and had no previous history of vaccination against FCoV as FIP vaccination is not a common practice in most clinics. Samples were consecutively designated as FCoV UPM1C/07 to UPM42C/10. The samples were processed and inoculated onto the CrFK (ATCC W ; CCL-94) and Fcwf-4 (ATCC; CRL-2787) as described previously [13] . Haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of cell cultures was carried as described by Hsiung [14] . On the other hand, indirect immunofluorescent (IIF) test using polyclonal antibodies against FIPV 79-1146 virus was performed according to the method of Evermann et al. [15] .",
