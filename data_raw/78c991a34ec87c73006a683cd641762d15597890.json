The full-length S genes of representative field strains were sequenced. 33 field strains share 93.5%-99.9% homologies with each other at the nucleotide sequence level and 92.3%-99.8% homologies with each other at the amino acids sequence level. Most field strains have nucleotide deletion and insertion regions, and show lower homologies (93.5%-94.2%) with Chinese classical strain CH/S, however higher homologies (97.1%-99.3%) with recent strain CHGD-1. The phylogenetic analysis showed there are classical strains and variants prevailing in pig herd in China. PEDV has a high detection rate in pig herds in China. Sequence analysis indicated the S genes of recent field strains have heterogeneity and the variants are predominant.",

In order to control and prevent PEDV infection, it is necessary for us to further investigate the prevalence of PEDV and the molecular characteristics of the S genes of Chinese PEDV field strains during 2011-2012.

The sequence data found that the S genes of recently Chinese field strains have 4,146-4,170 nucleotides (nt) in length (Table 1) . Compared to the S gene (4152 nt) of CV777, the S genes of 3 field strains are 6 nt shorter and consist of 4,146 n, the S genes of 8 field strains are 3 nt shorter and consist of 4,149 nt, the S genes of 2 field strains consist of 4152 nt, the S genes of 2 field strains are 6 nt longer and consist of 4158 nt, the S genes of 17 field strains are 9 nt longer and consist of 4,161 nt and the S gene of 1 field strain are 18 nt longer consists of 4,170 nt. These consequences were due to the presences of the number of deleted or inserted nucleotides that were accumulated in the N-terminus of the S gene. The S proteins of recently Chinese field strains have 1,381-1,389 amino acids (aa) in length (Table 1) . These consequences were due to the presences of the number of deleted or inserted amino acids that were accumulated in the N-terminus of the S protein. The antigen epitope motif ( 1368 GPRLQPY 1374 ) against 2C10, a monoclonal antibody that showed neutralizing activities against PEDV [13] , the CO-26K equivalent (COE) domain (aa499-638) [14] and the epitopes SS2 ( 748 YSNIGVCK 755 ), SS6 ( 764 LQDGQVKI 771 ) [15] of S protein can induce neutralizing antibodies against PEDV. According to the result of multiple alignments of amino acid sequences, the antigen epitope motif ( 1368 GPRLQPY 1374 ) is conserved in all the Chinese field strains. The epitope SS2 is conserved in all the Chinese field strains (excluding CH/HLJHG/2011). The epitope SS6 shows 2-or 3-amino acid mutations in most field strains ( Figure 1 ). Compared to CV777-attenuated, 7 field strains have no amino acids change in the COE domain, 27 field strains have 1-8 different amino acids in the COE domain (Table 2 ).",
