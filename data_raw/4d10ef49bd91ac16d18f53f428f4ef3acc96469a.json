Analysis of these new species is important for research into animal models of hepatitis C virus infection and into the zoonotic origins of human viruses. Here, we provide the first systematic phylogenetic and evolutionary analysis of these two genera at the wholegenome level. Phylogenies confirmed that hepatitis C virus is most closely related to viruses from horses whereas human pegiviruses clustered with viruses from African primates. Within each genus, several well-supported lineages were identified and viral diversity was structured by both host species and location of sampling. Recombination analyses provided evidence of interspecific recombination in hepaciviruses, but none in the pegiviruses. Putative mosaic genome structures were identified in NS5B gene region and were supported by multiple tests. The identification of interspecific recombination in the hepaciviruses represents an important evolutionary event that could be clarified by future sampling of novel viruses. We also identified parallel amino acid changes shared by distantly related lineages that infect similar types of host. Notable parallel changes were clustered in the NS3 and NS4B genes and provide a useful starting point for experimental studies of the evolution of Hepacivirus host-virus interactions.",

            "text": "Hepaciviruses and pegiviruses are two genera of the viral family Flaviviridae. This family comprises a genetically diverse group of viruses, several of which cause significant human diseases, and includes two further genera, the pestiviruses and flaviviruses. Both the Hepacivirus and Pegivirus genera contain species that infect humans. Hepatitis C is a disease caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV), a hepacivirus that infects approximately 3% of the world's population, yet was discovered only comparatively recently, in 1989 (Choo et al. 1989) . HCV is one of the most important causes of severe chronic liver disease (Pfaender et al. 2014 ) and the healthcare costs associated with HCV infection are estimated to be $6.5 billion in the United States alone (Razavi et al. 2013) . Human pegivirus (HPgV) is the most closely related human virus to HCV (Stapleton 2003) and is also a recent discovery. HPgV was described only in 1995, at which time it was known as hepatitis G, or GB virus C (Simons, Leary, et al. 1995; Simons, Pilot-Matias, et al. 1995) . HPgV is a lymphotropic virus but unlike HCV it has little, if any, associated pathogenicity in humans, although it infects an estimated 5% of people worldwide (Stapleton et al. 2011 ) and may be of clinical relevance in individuals who are coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) (Williams et al. 2004) .",

            "text": "In recent years there has been a huge expansion in our knowledge of the number, genetic diversity, and host range of Hepacivirus and Pegivirus species. Since 2010, more than 250 new virus sequences isolated from nonhuman host species have been published. These new viruses have been found in a wide range of mammalian hosts, including bats (Epstein et al. 2010; Quan et al. 2013) , primates (Lauck et al. 2013; Sibley et al. 2014) , rodents (Drexler et al. 2013; Kapoor, Simmonds, Scheel, et al. 2013; Firth et al. 2014) , and domesticated animals such as dogs (Kapoor et al. 2011; El-Attar et al. 2015) , cows (Baechlein et al. 2015; Corman et al. 2015) , and horses (Burbelo et al. 2012; Lyons et al. 2012; Chandriani et al. 2013; Kapoor, Simmonds, Cullen, et al. 2013; Gemaque et al. 2014; Reuter et al. 2014; Tanaka et al. 2014; Matsuu et al. 2015; Pfaender, Cavalleri, et al. 2015; Scheel et al. 2015) . As a result of these discoveries, bats, rodents, and horses are now of significant interest to the hunt for the zoonotic origin of human hepaciviruses and pegiviruses, whereas in the past primates were the primary target of this research (Simmonds 2013) . The potential for bat and rodent populations to act as reservoirs of viral infection and sources of cross-species transmission is well known; they have been estimated to be responsible for a quarter of all recently emerged human pathogens (Woolhouse and Gaunt 2007) . The recent explosion in the known genetic diversity of the Hepacivirus and Pegivirus genera suggests that there may be many more viral species in novel host species yet to be discovered, hence the picture of hepacivirus and pegivirus evolution may yet change. Despite this, now is a good time to consolidate the discoveries of the last 3 years.",

HCV contains ten distinct genes capped by untranslated regions (UTRs) at the 5 0and 3 0 -ends: a structural core protein (C), two envelope proteins (E1 and E2), nonstructural assembly proteins (p7 and NS2), and other nonstructural proteins used in replication (NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B) ( fig. 1 ; Moradpour et al. 2007 ). HPgV has a very similar structure, with several structural and nonstructural proteins. However, not all pegiviruses appear to encode a core protein (Pfaender et al. 2014) and some show evidence of a different, third structural protein, X, between the envelope and nonstructural proteins ( fig. 1 ; Sibley et al. 2014) . Despite their conserved genome structure, there is very significant genetic diversity within and among the two genera. This is in part due to highly errorprone replication by the virally encoded RNA polymerase (Neumann et al. 1998) .",

            "text": "Hepaciviruses and pegiviruses infect a wide range of mammals, although each virus species tends to have narrow a host range (Sibley et al. 2014) . Nonhuman hepaciviruses are of significant interest for at least two reasons. First, very little is known about the zoonotic origin or potential animal reservoirs of HCV. Molecular clock analyses indicate that HCV has infected human populations for hundreds to thousands of years (e.g., Smith et al. 1997; Markov et al. 2012; Iles et al. 2014) even though the disease it causes has been discovered only recently, and a long-term evolutionary association between HCV and humans has also been hypothesized (Simmonds 2013) . The origin of HPgV is also unknown, and there is no evidence indicating the animal populations responsible for the transfer of these viruses to humans (Makuwa et al. 2006) . Second, there is no animal model in which HCV infection can be studied straightforwardly, and current cell culture systems are limited in scope, so a better understanding of related viruses could provide valuable insights into the biology of HCV (Bukh 2012) . Chimpanzees that are experimentally infected with HCV suffer from chronic infection resembling that observed in humans; however, surveys have not found viruses related to HCV in wild chimpanzees (Makuwa et al. 2003) . Although chimpanzees are the most realistic model system of human infection available, their use in medical research raises very substantial ethical, logistical, and financial problems (Bukh 2004) . More recently, human liver chimeric mice have been used as small animal models of HCV infection (Bissig et al. 2010 ) but their lack of functional or natural immune system limits their use (Bukh 2012) . In the future nonhuman hepaciviruses, notably equine hepaciviruses, may prove to be practical as animal models for HCV biology (Pfaender, Cavalleri, et al. 2015) .",

            "text": "Despite numerous recent reports of newly discovered species of hepaciviruses and pegiviruses (see above), a systematic phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analysis of the two genera has not been conducted. This has resulted incongruent tree topologies being reported for the Hepacivirus genus among recent studies (Kapoor, Simmonds, Scheel, et al. 2013; Quan et al. 2013; Tanaka et al. 2014; Baechlein et al. 2015; Corman et al. 2015) . Previous phylogenetic analysis have utilized only small regions of the virus genome (specifically, parts of the NS3 and NS5B genes), or have investigated only a subset of available taxa. Further, no analysis of recombination or parallel molecular evolution at the interspecific level has been undertaken. Although recombination has been reported between genotypes and subtypes of HCV, it does not appear to be a significant process in HCV evolution (Kalinina et al. 2002; Colina 2004; Cristina and Colina 2006; Raghwani et al. 2012; Shi et al. 2012; Galli and Bukh 2014) , although it has been hypothesized that ancient recombination may explain the origin of pegivirus-like internal ribosomal entry sites in rodent hepaciviruses (located in the 5 0 -UTR of Flaviviridae) (Drexler et al. 2013) . In this study, we perform a comprehensive evolutionary analysis of the hepaciviruses and pegiviruses that draws together all currently available data. We attempt to resolve the phylogenetic structure of both genera and we find that taxa appear to cluster most strongly by host species type. Intriguingly, we find some evidence for interspecific recombination in the hepaciviruses, although clear interpretation of this result is hampered by viral genetic diversity and undersampling. Further, we detect a number of important parallel amino acid mutations among hepacivirus lineages that infect similar hosts, which suggests potential adaptive residues suitable for investigation in experimental studies.",

After trimming the hepacivirus and pegivirus alignments were 1,927 and 2,233 amino acids in length, which represents 64% and 74% of their total coding regions, respectively ( fig. 1 ). These alignments are hereafter termed the \"genome-wide\" alignments. Maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenies were estimated from the genome-wide amino acids alignments using the LG + I + G + F substitution model and parameters; this model was selected under the Aikaike information criterion using the ProtTest program (Darriba et al. 2011) . ML phylogenies were estimated using RAxML (Stamatakis 2006) . Statistical support for phylogenetic nodes was assessed using a bootstrap approach (with 100 replicates).

Two genomic regions in particular were commonly sequenced in both genera: part of NS3, a viral helicase, and of NS5B, the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. These genes correspond to strongly conserved regions within the genome-wide alignment ( fig. 1 ). Multiple alignments of partial NS3 and NS5B proteins contain substantially less phylogenetic information but include a wider range of taxa. Since there is a trade-off between the number of taxa and sequence length, we chose to examine both genome-wide and subgenomic data sets. We therefore performed multiple amino acids alignment and ML phylogenetic inference, as above, on both the partial NS3 and NS5B regions, using the LG + I + G substitution model and parameters, as selected by the ProtTest program.",

The 99% confidence limits of these positions were not determined, meaning that RDP had difficulties in identifying the breakpoint positions. These estimated 5 0 breakpoints positions are approximately 1,000-1,500 nt downstream of those detected with RECCO. However, the two sets of locations are sited either side of a large unalignable region in the genome-wide alignment ( fig. 1) ; the absence of this region from the alignment means that small amounts of random estimation error could lead to substantial jumps in estimated breakpoint placement. Further, all 3 0 breakpoint locations were in the same region of the hepacivirus genome, corresponding to the middle of NS5B. Because RDP implements a more sophisticated suite of tools for estimating breakpoint locations than RECCO, we rely on the results of the former and conclude that the recombinant fragments most likely lie between the 5 0 boundary and the middle of NS5B.",

One theoretical explanation for this difference is a higher rate of recombination in hepaciviruses, which could generate a greater number of apparent homoplasies (Maynard Smith and Smith 1998) . Of the parallel mutations found in the hepaciviruses, a disproportionate number are found in the NS4B protein (ten mutations in a region onl\u1ef9 250 amino acids long), which acts as membrane anchor for the replication complex (Chevaliez and Pawlotsky 2006) . Moreover, the only parallel amino acid change that was observed in multiple pairwise comparisons (position 6210 in hepacivirus reference genome H77; fig. 1 ) is located in the NS4B protein.

The genetic distances between HCV and HPgV and the bat viruses most closely related to them are large, so the currently known hepaciviruses and pegiviruses from bats are unlikely to represent the virus populations directly responsible for zoonotic transmission. Some zoonotic viruses have been found to require a \"stepping stone\" species to facilitate transfer between bats and humans. For example, horseshoe bats were discovered to be the source of severe acute respiratory syndrome, whereas civet cats, which had previously been assumed to be basal, were relegated to the position of an intermediate host species (Lau et al. 2005) . Importantly, the phylogenetic distribution of bat hepaciviruses and pegiviruses could yet change with more sampling; the long internal branches in the phylogenies of these groups (figs. 2 and 3) may represent massive undersampling of true virus diversity (Pybus and Gray 2013) . The same argument can be made for rodents, which appear to host a wide variety of genetically diverse hepaciviruses, found in three separate lineages ( fig. 2 ). Rodent pegiviruses are currently more limited in number, with only two complete genomes available ( fig. 3 ). Although analysis of partial NS3 and NS5B sequences provided more sequences, further sampling of rodent hepacivirus and pegiviruses would greatly enhance our understanding of their evolutionary history and host distribution. The recent discovery of hepaciviruses and pegiviruses in commensal rat species is particularly intriguing, as they represent a population with considerable direct and indirect interactions with humans (Firth et al. 2014) .",

SIV is thought to have been transmitted to humans through the hunting or butchering of bushmeat. The primate species from which pegivirus complete genomes are available ( fig. 3) , particularly the Ugandan red colobus monkey, Piliocolobus tephrosceles, are not commonly hunted for bush meat in Uganda (Chapman and Lambert 2000) . However the NS3 and NS5B phylogenies show virus isolates from chimpanzees situated basal to the HPgV (supplementary figs. S3 and S4, Supplementary Material online), supporting the hypothesis that HPgV originated in chimpanzees or cospeciated within the great apes. This highlights the need to undertake complete genome sequencing of the chimpanzee isolates for which only NS3 or NS5B sequences are available to better understand the evolution of these viruses.",

            "text": "Despite the discovery of many new hepaciviruses and pegiviruses in recent years, there are significant issues regarding sampling diversity. Undersampling of viral diversity is the most likely cause of the long internal branches that generate distinct lineages, each of which contain clusters of closely related viruses. There is surely a huge diversity of hepaciviruses and pegiviruses yet to be discovered, and the species examined to date represent only a small proportion of potential hosts. For example, rodents represent 40% of extant mammalian species (Gorbunova et al. 2014 ) and bats contribute another 20% of species (Rose and Archibald 2005) . However, so far, only 22 species of bat have had hepaciviruses or pegiviruses isolated from them, representing less than 2% of the total number of bat species (Quan et al. 2013) . Sampling is even sparser for rodents; hepaciviruses or pegiviruses have been collected from only six rodent species, accounting for approximately 0.25% of the total number of rodent species (Drexler et al. 2013; Firth et al. 2014) . The six rodent host species identified so far come from only two of the five suborders of rodent: five are from the Myomorpha suborder and one from the Castorimorpha suborder. Yet even within the narrow range of species sampled, the diversity of viruses discovered in bats and rodents far outweighs that found in humans and horses (Pybus and Gray 2013) . If hepaciviruses and pegiviruses are species-specific (Kapoor, Simmonds, Scheel, et al. 2013) then we would expect to find many more virus species once a wider range of bat and rodent species are sampled. Inclusion of more virus species will likely break down the long internal branches in the phylogenies (figs. 2 and 3), providing a more accurate picture of the evolution of these genera. A high level of undersampling is by no means unique to these two genera; it has been estimated that within just nine viral families there is likely to be a vast diversity of viral species yet to be discovered in mammals (Anthony et al. 2013 ). If new viruses are found that fall basal to the currently known hepaciviruses and pegiviruses, then we would expect that the original criteria for defining these two sister genera (Stapleton et al. 2011 ) may be questioned and re-evaluated in the future. Although several tests for interspecific recombination within the hepaciviruses produced significant results (e.g., RECCO, Bootscan), it is hard to produce high bootstrap scores for phylogenetic analyses of recombination when the sequences in question are highly divergent. In influenza viruses it has been suggested that a combination of among-gene and among-lineage evolutionary rate variation can give a false appearance of recombination (Worobey et al. 2002) . However, evidence for recombination is strengthened when positive results are produced by multiple analyses. The hypothesized recombination in NS5B gene region between lineages C and G is especially intriguing as these lineages infect the same type of host (Bats) and are spatially overlapping (Kenya). However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the putative recombination events identified in silico in this study are the result of laboratory-generated recombination. As in all such cases, computational analysis alone cannot resolve this issue. Confirmation of recombination could be achieved by resequencing of the proposed recombinant breakpoints from fresh extractions of the initial samples. Further sampling of diverse hepaciviruses will help to answer questions about the rate and nature of recombination in the group with greater confidence.",

            "text": "Our analysis of parallel mutation may also support the notion that hepaciviruses are subject to recombination, as more homoplasies were observed between distantly related hepacivirus lineages than among pegivirus lineages. The higher density of parallel changes found in the hepacivirus NS3, NS4B, and NS5B genes indicate that these genes may play an important role in host-species viral adaptation. The most notable result is our identification of multiply parallel amino acid changes in the NS3 gene leading to lineages infecting the same type of host but not in other lineages. This result is analogous to one previously reported for HIV (Wain et al. 2007) , where a parallel change in the viral gag protein was found in three independent lineages leading to HIV groups M, N, and O in humans, but not in the viral ancestors of these groups (SIV isolated from chimpanzees and gorillas). Moreover, the NS3 protein is particularly interesting in terms of host-virus coevolution, as the NS3-4A protease is capable of cleaving human mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) (Patel et al. 2012) , which is necessary for the activation of transcription factors that regulate expression of beta interferon and contributes to antiviral immunity. Two recent studies have shown that the equine hepacivirus NS3-4A protease can cleave human MAVS (Parera et al. 2012; Scheel et al. 2015) , questioning the strength of coevolution between these host and viral proteins. However, it remains unclear whether either equine hepacivirus or HCV proteases are capable of cleaving equine MAVS. Hence, the genetic similarity of HCV and equine hepaciviruses may explain why equine hepacivirus NS3-4 protease is capable of cleaving human MAVS.",

These genes are highly conserved due to their importance in viral replication, making them easier and quicker to identify in new host species using PCR and the number of sequences for these regions is correspondingly greater than for whole genomes. Here, in order to maximize phylogenetic information, we estimated phylogenies from all alignable regions with the hepacivirus and pegivirus genomes. These regions comprised 64% of the hepacivirus genome and 74% of the pegivirus genome ( fig. 1 ). As expected, the commonly sequenced partial NS3 and NS5B regions could be easily aligned, but much less of the envelope genes (E1 and E2) and NS5A could be reliably aligned. Further sampling of hepaciviruses and pegivirus diversity may unlock the evolutionary information concealed in regions that are currently unalignable.",

Furthermore, both hepaciviruses and pegiviruses tend to be species-specific, indicating that they are well adapted to their hosts (Sawyer and Elde 2012) . The sites exhibiting parallel evolution identified here will provide a useful starting point for experimental studies of species-specific replication and the evolution of host-virus interactions.
