However, inflammatory stimuli can trigger IFNAR1 ubiquitination and downregulation thereby attenuating IFN effects in vitro. The significance of this paradoxical regulation is unknown. Presented here results demonstrate that inability to stimulate IFNAR1 ubiquitination in the Ifnar1 SA knock-in mice renders them highly susceptible to numerous inflammatory syndromes including acute and chronic pancreatitis, and autoimmune and toxic hepatitis. Ifnar1 SA mice (or their bone marrow-receiving wild type animals) display persistent immune infiltration of inflamed tissues, extensive damage and gravely inadequate tissue regeneration. Pharmacologic stimulation of IFNAR1 ubiquitination is protective against toxic hepatitis and fulminant generalized inflammation in wild type but not Ifnar1 SA mice. These results suggest that endogenous mechanisms that trigger IFNAR1 ubiquitination for limiting the inflammation-induced tissue damage can be purposely mimicked for therapeutic benefits.",

Initial stages of inflammation that exacerbate tissue damage are often followed by subsequent regeneration/repair of tissue to restore its function (Medzhitov, 2008) . Failure to progress to these later stages contributes to development of chronic pathologic conditions associated with numerous human diseases including pancreatitis and hepatitis, arthritis, and neurodegenerative syndromes. Despite the enormous medical significance of persistent inflammation, the mechanisms that restrain the tissue damage and ensure the transition to the restorative phase largely remain to be understood (Nathan & Ding, 2010) .",

Cytokines that belong to the family of type 1 interferons (IFN) protect the host against viruses and tumors (Stark et al, 1998) . IFN act on cells through engaging a cell surface-located cognate receptor (formed by IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 chains) and subsequent stimulation of the signal transduction cascade including activation of the Janus kinases (JAK) and signal transduction and activators of transcription (STAT1/2) proteins (Uze et al, 2007) . The latter interact with IRF9 to form a specific transcriptionally active complex capable of inducing a plethora of IFN-stimulated proteins that act in concert to mediate the anti-viral, anti-tumorigenic and immunomodulatory effects of IFNs. These effects underlie the use of pharmacologically formulated IFN for treatment of viral infections, cancers and multiple sclerosis (Stark et al, 1998; Platanias, 2005; Stark & Darnell, 2012) .",

            "text": "However, the benefits of IFN actions to the host are offset by tissue toxicities elicited by these cytokines (Trinchieri, 2010) . Importantly, while anti-viral effects of IFN action could be achieved at low concentrations, a higher dose is required to achieve the anti-proliferative and anti-survival effects of IFN on tumor and benign cells (Jaitin et al, 2006) . Furthermore, the toxic effects of IFN correlate with its affinity for IFNAR1 (Jaitin et al, 2006; Kalie et al, 2007; Thomas et al, 2011; de Weerd et al, 2013) and require a much higher cell surface density of its receptor (Moraga et al, 2009; Levin et al, 2011; Piehler et al, 2012) . The cell surface levels of IFN receptor and ensuing sensitivity of cells to IFN are negatively regulated by the ubiquitination, endocytosis and degradation of IFNAR1 facilitated by the b-Trcp E3 ubiquitin ligase (Kumar et al, 2003 (Kumar et al, , 2007 . The ability of b-Trcp to interact with IFNAR1 and to ubiquitinate this protein requires phosphorylation on specific serine residues (Ser526 in mouse IFNAR1 or Ser535 in human receptor) within a conserved degron motif located in the intracellular domain of IFNAR1 (Kumar et al, 2003 (Kumar et al, , 2004 . This IFNAR1 phosphorylation triggered by IFN (Kumar et al, 2004; Marijanovic et al, 2006) through JAK-mediated activation of protein kinase D2 (PKD2) attenuates IFN signaling by ubiquitination-driven downregulation and degradation of IFNAR1 (Zheng et al, 2011a,c) . Importantly, this phosphorylation of IFNAR1 can be induced by ligand-unrelated stimuli that altogether desensitize cells to IFN (reviewed in (Fuchs, 2013) . For example, PKD2-activating vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) can trigger ubiquitination and downregulation of IFNAR1 and blunt the cellular responses to IFN (Zheng et al, 2011b) . Other stimuli capable of IFN-independent phosphorylation of IFNAR1 utilize a different pathway (Liu et al, 2008 (Liu et al, , 2009b ) that involves IFNAR1 Ser526/535 phosphorylation by casein kinase 1a (Liu et al, 2009a) amplified by an adjacent priming phosphorylation (Bhattacharya et al, 2010) , which is mediated by the p38 stress-activated protein kinase (Bhattacharya et al, 2011) . These stimuli include inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1b and tumor necrosis factor-a [IL1b and TNFa (Huangfu et al, 2012) ], and bacterial lipopolysaccharide [LPS, ].",

We initially focused on the role of IFN signaling and IFNAR1 stability in development of acute pancreatitis, a deadly disease affecting millions of people worldwide [reviewed in (Pandol, 2006) ]. Whereas the etiology of this disease is complex, common pathogenetic mechanisms include food/alcohol-induced pancreatic hyperstimulation and pancreatic duct obstruction leading to increased pancreatic duct pressure and reflux of active trypsin. As a result, trypsin and other proteolytic enzymes become activated within pancreatic acinar cells resulting in their autolysis and induction of local inflammation [reviewed in (Pandol, 2006; Reichert & Rustgi, 2011) ]. Intriguingly, pancreatitis induces many pathways known to downregulate IFNAR1 such as VEGF (Kuehn et al, 1999) , unfolded protein response (Kubisch & Logsdon, 2007) , and pathogen recognition receptors (Pastor et al, 2004; Li et al, 2005) . Furthermore, a number of reported cases of iatrogenic pancreatitis have been attributed to the IFN-based drugs (Trivedi & Pitchumoni, 2005) , and IFN-induced pancreatic inflammation was observed in mice injected with poly I:C (Hayashi et al, 2011) .",

Importantly, na\u20ac \u0131ve Ifnar1 SA mice developed normally and exhibit neither any signs of growth retardation nor gross abnormalities ( Supplementary Fig 7) , nor hallmarks of constitutive pancreatic inflammation (Fig 1B,C) . Cells from these animals exhibited a slower rate of IFNAR1 degradation yet did not display a hyperreactive IFN signaling as evident from the lack of constitutive activation of STAT1 ( Supplementary Fig 8) , sustained ability of their hematopoietic cells to engraft and reconstitute bone marrow in lethally irradiated mice (Material and Methods and experiments described below), normal blood cell counts and serum chemistry profiles as well mitochondrial activities in the peripheral tissues similar to that of wild type mice (Supplemental Table 1 ).",

Noticeably higher TNFa mRNA levels were found in pancreatic tissues from Ifnar1 SA mice than in their wild type counterparts ( Fig 3A) . In addition, the pancreatitis-induced increase in blood plasma TNFa levels were also greater in Ifnar1 SA (7.89 fold) than in Ifnar1 +/+ (4.50-fold) mice. Levels of IL10 protein in blood plasma were higher in caerulein-treated Ifnar1 SA animals (251 AE 2 versus 114 AE 2 pg/ml in wild type mice) indicative of systemic anti-inflammatory response and consistent with reported increase of this cytokine in caeruleintreated mice (Zhou et al, 2012) and documented ability of IFN to induce IL10 production in leukocytes in vitro (Aman et al, 1996; Rudick et al, 1996) . However, unexpectedly low IL10 mRNA levels were found in the pancreatic tissues from Ifnar1 SA animals ( Fig 3A) . This result suggests that downregulation of IFNAR1 in cells localized in the focus of inflammation restrains production of inflammatory TNFa while promoting the expression of antiinflammatory IL10.",

Yet, pancreata from Ifnar1 SA mice exhibited very few sings of acinar cell restoration and displayed a persistent immune infiltration ( Fig 1B  and Supplementary Fig 3) . An even greater increase in pancreatic inflammation and damage was observed in Ifnar1 SA mice receiving multiple injections of caerulein to model chronic pancreatits (Fig 4A-D and Supplementary Fig 12) . Unlike wild type mice that displayed both signs of inflammation (including edema and leukocytic infiltration) and restored tissue (Fig 4B) , pancreata from Ifnar1 SA animals remained highly inflamed (Fig 4B,D and Supplementary Fig 12) and exhibited pronounced signs of tissue damage, degeneration and fibrosis (Fig 4B-D) . These data strongly suggest that induction of IFNAR1 ubiquitination restricts the extent of inflammation and tissue injury and enables pancreatic tissue regeneration in chronic pancreatitis.

Furthermore, livers harvested from Ifnar1 SA mice exhibited dramatic histopathologic alterations (Fig 5C and Supplementary Fig 16) along with robust activation of p38 kinase (Fig 5D) , greater number of hepatic lesions and consistently higher hepatitis grade (Table 1) . These alterations in Ifnar1 SA mice together with a more pronounced leukocyte infiltration ( Supplementary Fig 17) strongly suggest that ubiquitination of IFNAR1 plays a protective role during hepatitis of either autoimmune or toxic etiology.

We tested the effects of LPA in a clinically relevant model of toxic hepatitis induced by analgesic agent Acetaminophen (APAP), whose overdose causes severe liver damage and greatly contributes to acute liver failure of non-viral etiology in human patients (Ostapowicz & Lee, 2000; Bernal et al, 2010) . A greater extent of APAP-induced liver damage (assessed by the plasma aminotransferase levels) was detected in Ifnar1 SA mice compared to wild type animals. While AST/ALT levels in APAP-treated wild type were significantly decreased upon treatment with LPA, we did not observe this effect in Ifnar1 SA mice (Fig 7D and Supplementary  Fig 20) .

While conducting the experiments on LPS-induced cytokines (Fig 2) we were unable to compare the levels of these cytokines between wild type and Ifnar1 SA mice past 24 h after LPS treatment because of early lethality in the Ifnar1 SA group.

First, the results suggest that accelerated ubiquitination and ensuing downregulation of IFNAR1 in response to numerous stimuli may (at least to some extent) functionally mimic the complete loss of this receptor via genetic ablation. Under specific physiologic and pathologic scenarios, this accelerated degradation may result in a phenotypic equivalency between wild type and IFNAR1 knockout animals. Such equivalency should not be over-interpreted as the lack of role of IFN in a given physiologic process or a pathologic condition. Second, given that upregulation of Irf7 seen in Ifnar1 SA mice can contribute to further increases in ligands production ( Supplementary  Figs 1, 2, 9 and 15 ), the inability to eliminate IFNAR1 may create a feed-forward signaling amplification mechanism. Importantly, the augmented IFN signaling as well as phenotypes observed in Ifnar1 SA mice are evident despite numerous negative regulators of IFN pathway that function downstream of receptor and include the expression of signaling and transcriptional inhibitors including tyrosine phosphatases, suppressors of cytokine signaling, Sprouty, Ubp43, protein inhibitors of STAT, etc. (Coccia et al, 2006; Zhang & Zhang, 2011; Sharma et al, 2012) . This fact suggests that ubiquitination-dependent downregulation of IFNAR1 represents a major and critically important mechanism that attenuates the sensitivity of cells and tissues to IFN and plays a key role in limiting IFN-mediated immunopathology.",

Temporarily limiting the output of IFN signaling is expected to attenuate the direct detrimental effects of IFN on cell growth and viability and affect IFN-induced p38-dependent (Katsoulidis et al, 2005) and NF-jB-regulated (Du et al, 2007) inflammatory pathways known to contribute to expression of additional inflammatory cytokines (Karin, 2005) . Furthermore, previously published studies showed that IFNAR1 expression is essential for efficient IL6 signaling (Mitani et al, 2001) . The produced cytokines/chemokines either directly kill cells or contribute to subsequent waves of recruitment of immune cells that are capable of further damaging the inflamed tissue. Pancreatic inflammation in mice deficient in IFNAR1 ubiquitination was paralleled with an altered balance between proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. TNFa and IL10) and increased expression of CCL2 (Fig 3) . Given that IFN directly induces transcription of CCL2 (Buttmann et al, 2007) that mediates recruitment of inflammatory monocytes, which in turn produce TNFa and other inflammatory cytokines (Guha & Mackman, 2001) , it is plausible that down-regulation of IFNAR1 may help to restrict this pathway. Consistent with this possibility, a greater number of inflammatory monocytes/macrophages was observed in tissues from If-nar1 SA mice (Fig 3 and Supplementary Fig 11) .",

Some of these agents and their receptors were already shown to play a role in regulating the severity of inflammation (Ohta & Sitkovsky, 2001) .

Initial stages of inflammation that exacerbate tissue damage are often followed by subsequent regeneration/repair of tissue to restore its function. While failure to progress to these later stages contributes to development of many human diseases, the mechanisms limiting tissue injury and promoting the transition to the restorative phase are poorly understood. Type 1 interferons (IFN) protect the organism from viruses and tumors yet elicit tissue toxicities often being manifested in patients with tumors or chronic viral infections treated with IFN-based drugs. All effects of IFN are mediated by its cell surface receptor, whose levels are regulated by phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination and degradation of the IF-NAR1 chain. Importantly, these processes depriving cells from ability to respond to their future encounter with IFN can be stimulated by inflammatory stimuli in vitro. Should this regulation occur in vivo, it would pose a medical problem of reduced efficacy of pharmaceutical IFN in inflamed tissues. Furthermore, the very existence of such mechanism is counterintuitive for the host defense as it may limit the anti-viral and anti-tumorigenic benefits of endogenously produced IFN within the regions of inflammation. Hence, we sought to investigate the manifestation and biological significance of inflammationinduced IFNAR1 ubiquitination and downregulation in vivo.",

Altered balance of pro-inflammatory/ anti-inflammatory cytokines and specific chemokines resulting in the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes was observed in pancreatic tissues of IFNAR1 ubiquitination-deficient mice. These mice displayed extensive damage and persistent immune infiltration of inflamed tissues, and, in the case of generalized inflammation, overwhelming mortality. Under conditions of chronic pancreatitis, these mice also exhibited a dramatically impaired ability to repair the pancreatic tissue and restore its anatomical and functional integrity. Experiments using bone marrow transplantation determined that inability to ubiquitinate and degrade IFNAR1 in hematopoietic compartment is responsible for excessive pancreatic and hepatic inflammatory phenotypes.
