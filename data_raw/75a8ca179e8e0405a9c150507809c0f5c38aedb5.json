Informed by atomic structures of RSV fusion (F) glycoprotein in prefusion (pre-F) and postfusion (post-F) conformations, we demonstrate that FI-RSV predominately presents post-F on the virion surface, whereas infectious RSV presents both pre-F and post-F conformations. This significant antigenic distinction has not been previously appreciated. Thus, a stabilized pre-F antigen is more representative of live RSV than F in its post-F conformation, as displayed on the surface of FI-RSV. This finding has major implications for discriminating current pre-F-based immunogens from FI-RSV used in historical vaccine trials.",

In part, this delayed development stems from clinical trials using formalin-inactivated RSV (FI-RSV) product that caused an enhanced respiratory disease (ERD) syndrome in children who received the FI-RSV vaccine. The FI-RSV vaccine adjuvanted with alum was evaluated in four separate studies in seronegative infants and young children in 1966 (refs 2-6). Instead of eliciting protective immunity, a greater number of vaccinees developed severe illness compared to control groups. A three dose regimen (0, 1, 4 months) was used in subjects between 2 and 7 months of age, 16 were hospitalized of the 20 infected children in the FI-RSV-vaccinated group (N = 31) compared to only 1 hospitalized of 21 infected in the control groups (N = 40) 3 . Tragically, two of the FI-RSV recipients died at 14 and 16 months of age from bacterial pneumonia complicating their subsequent RSV infection. In the majority of vaccinees, priming with FI-RSV led to pathology upon subsequent RSV infection that ordinarily is only manifest in a small fraction of RSV-na\u00efve individuals. The immunological basis for FI-RSV-induced enhanced illness has focused on two major features of the humoral and cellular responses. First, FI-RSV induced high titers of binding antibody with weak neutralizing and fusion-inhibitory activity 7,8 . These antibodies in the context of large antigen load led to immune complex deposition and complement activation in airways upon subsequent RSV infection 9 . Second, natural RSV infection after immunization with FI-RSV was associated with exaggerated peribronchiolar inflammation and infiltration of neutrophils and eosinophils into airways. This is consistent with findings in animal models where FI-RSV has been shown to induce Th2-biased immune responses and airway hypersensitivity characterized by up regulation of IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and IgE 10 .",

At high concentrations (1%), formalin fixes tissue and obliterates infectivity by forming chemical additions (carbonyls) and intra-and inter-protein crosslinking 13 . At lower concentrations, however, these modifications have a varied effect on preserving antigenic sites. Hepatitis A virus vaccine that was inactivated with 0.0625% formalin elicited antibodies in humans that neutralized virus and protected against infection 14, 15 . However, poliovirus that was inactivated with 0.025% formalin was shown to have decreased binding to the human poliovirus receptor, suggesting that formalin inactivation had altered the receptor-binding site 16 . These data suggest that formalin can potentially \"fix\" or stabilize protein conformation, alter protein structure, and/or chemically modify protein surfaces.

While G may play a role in attachment to airway epithelium and immunomodulation, the F glycoprotein is the major target for vaccine development due to its requirement for viral entry and high sequence conservation. F is a type I transmembrane protein cleaved by furin-like proteases into F1 (AA 137-574), peptide 27 (AA 110-138) and F2 (AA 1-109) that form a trimer of F1-F2 heterodimers. Atomic-level structures of F have been determined in two distinct conformations, prefusion and postfusion [17] [18] [19] (pre-F and post-F, respectively) ( Fig. 1a,b) . Similarly to other class I fusion proteins, RSV F undergoes a massive conformational rearrangement to mediate viral-cell membrane fusion, transitioning irreversibly from a metastable pre-F to a stable post-F conformation. Although pre-F and post-F structures have distinct shapes, they share roughly 50% of their surface area, including two well-defined antigenic sites (II and IV) that are moderately neutralization sensitive. On the unique surfaces of pre-F there are at least three additional antigenic sites reported so far (\u00d8, III, and V) that are highly neutralization sensitive, particularly site \u00d8 (Fig. 1b) . Antibodies that bind antigenic site I have weak or no neutralizing activity and bind almost exclusively to post-F. Both pre-F and post-F are present in the membrane of infectious RSV, but neutralizing antibody responses found in naturally infected individuals > 5 years of age are predominantly directed towards pre-F surfaces 20 . To have significant neutralizing activity, RSV F-specific antibodies have to recognize and interrupt pre-F function 21 .",

In the experiments using a conformationally stabilized prefusion F protein (DSCav1), pre-F specific antibodies were able to recognize DSCav1 after incubation at 37 \u00b0C with or without the addition of 0.025% formalin. This indicates that the loss of recognition of FI-RSV by pre-F specific antibodies is not due to chemical modifications by formalin, but rather due to modifications of pre-F conformation. To investigate the effect of formalin on antigenic recognition, we increased the concentration of added formalin to 1% and found that the recognition of post-F by motavizumab and DSCav1 by all antibodies were greatly reduced ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). This indicates that formalin can influence antigenicity, but the effect is not discernable at the \"formalin-inactivating\" concentration of 0.025%, and is much less than the impact of temperature. To further understand the effect of formalin and elevated temperature on the antigenic profile of RSV virions, we recapitulated the methods used to manufacture FI-RSV and defined the kinetics of antibody reactivity. Immediately after the application of formalin, RSV retained both pre-F and post-F antigenic sites; however, over time at 37 \u00b0C, pre-F specific epitopes on the surface of RSV disappear (Fig. 2a) . The disappearance of pre-F specific epitopes (particularly site \u00d8) correlated with reduction in infectivity, as determined by flow cytometry of recombinant GFP-expressing RSV-infected cells (Fig. 2b) .",

These proteins all mediate membrane fusion by a conformational change from a prefusion form to a transitional pre-hairpin intermediate form and eventually to a stable 6-helix bundle postfusion form. Therefore, defining the protein conformation presented on the surface of a viral immunogen is key to understanding mechanisms of antibody neutralization, and represents an important step toward designing a vaccine immunogen targeting the functional prefusion conformation. Recent work on HIV-1 Env has demonstrated that, in contrast to strain-specific antibodies raised against gp120 monomers or non-native trimeric gp140, stabilized versions of the prefusion Env trimer can preferentially elicit conformation-dependent, cross-reactive antibodies that can effectively target a functional prefusion conformation 23 . Similarly, the critical differences between antigenic sites of pre-F on infectious RSV and post-F on FI-RSV suggest that the balance of F conformational states determines virus infectivity. Designing immunogens that preserve neutralization-sensitive epitopes on the functional form of viral proteins will promote the induction of protective antibody responses and diminish non-neutralizing antibody responses, theoretically reducing the likelihood of immune complex formation and complement activation.",

This contradicts the original presumption that production of FI-RSV from RSV alters only the infectivity of the virus, not the antigenicity, and that this low concentration of formalin would help preserve or fix the antigenic sites on the virus 24 .",
