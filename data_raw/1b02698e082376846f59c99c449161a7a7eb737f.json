In both of these disease models, the accumulation of autoreactive T cells in the target organ is significantly reduced in the absence of Drak2. The reduced accumulation of autoreactive T cells is due to an increased susceptibility to death of the Drak2 -/-T cells [2, 3] . Interestingly, despite this increased sensitivity to death in the T cells, the Drak2 -/mice effectively eliminate infectious pathogens and retain the ability to combat tumors as well as wildtype mice [2, [4] [5] [6] [7] . Thus, Drak2 is an ideal protein to target in order to treat autoimmune disorders without compromising immunity to pathogens and tumors. However, the substrates and downstream effects of Drak2 signaling that contribute to autoimmunity require further elucidation to validate its potential as a therapeutic target and to further understand how these autoimmune diseases develop.",

TGF-\u03b2 is a pleiotropic cytokine that elicits numerous effects on various cell types [13] . In T cells specifically, TGF-\u03b2 inhibits proliferation of na\u00efve T cells, induces development of regulatory T cells, and enhances apoptosis of activated T cells. A recent study proposed that Drak2 functions as a negative regulator of TGF-\u03b2 signaling by inhibiting the phosphorylation and recruitment of Smad2 and Smad3 to the TGF-\u03b2RI in cell lines [12] . Thus, the absence of Drak2 in T cells may render these cells more susceptible to TGF-\u03b2 signaling, which could prevent autoimmunity. However, it has not been tested if Drak2 functions as a negative regulator of TGF-\u03b2 in T cells, and consequently, whether Drak2 -/-T cells are more sensitive to TGF-\u03b2 signaling.",

We found that TGF-\u03b2 signaling via Smad2 and Smad3 was not enhanced in the absence of Drak2 in T cells, and that Drak2 -/-T cells did not exhibit enhanced responses to TGF-\u03b2 signaling during in vitro assays. These data suggest that Drak2 does not function as an inhibitor of TGF-\u03b2 signaling in T cells. Moreover, in the absence of TGF-\u03b2 signaling, Drak2 -/-T cells remained more susceptible to apoptosis, suggesting that the increase in cell death observed in vitro, was not due to enhanced TGF-\u03b2-mediated signals. These data provide insight into the role of Drak2 in autoimmune diseases by showing that Drak2 may not suppress TGF-\u03b2 signaling in T cells, and therefore may contribute to autoimmune disease via other molecular pathways.",

            "text": "Given that recent experiments in cell lines suggested that Drak2 negatively regulates TGF-\u03b2 signaling [12] , and enhanced TGF-\u03b2 signaling in T cells could contribute to the resistance to autoimmune disease, we tested whether Drak2 functions as a negative regulator of TGF-\u03b2 signaling in T cells. TGF-\u03b2 receptor engagement results in the phosphorylation of the Smad2/Smad3 signaling complex, which then translocates from the cytoplasm into the nucleus to facilitate TGF-\u03b2-mediated transcription. To determine if Smad2 translocation into the nucleus was increased in the absence of Drak2, we activated CD4 + T cells with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies for 24 hours, and then utilized confocal fluorescent microscopy to analyze Smad2 localization following addition of TGF-\u03b2. As expected, Smad2 translocation into the nucleus was not observed in stimulated T cells without exogenous TGF-\u03b2 (Fig 1) . The addition of TGF-\u03b2 during the final 20 minutes of culture elicited Smad2 translocation into the nuclear region of both wildtype and Drak2 -/-T cells (Fig 1) . Importantly, there were no differences in Smad2 translocation between wildtype and Drak2 -/-T cells in response to exogenous TGF-\u03b2.",

Therefore, we explored the effects of TGF-\u03b2 on several T cell functions in vitro. TGF-\u03b2 suppresses T cell receptor-induced proliferation of na\u00efve T cells in vitro [14] . Thus, we examined if na\u00efve Drak2 -/-T cells were more sensitive to TGF-\u03b2-mediated inhibition of proliferation than naive wildtype T cells. Na\u00efve OT-II and OT-II.Drak2 -/-CD4 + T cells were stimulated with OVA 323pulsed splenocytes in the presence or absence of TGF-\u03b2, and analyzed for proliferation. The number of live, divided CD4 + T cells decreased in response to TGF-\u03b2 (Fig 3a) . However, the effect of TGF-\u03b2 inhibition was comparable between OT-II and OT-II.Drak2 -/-T cells.

Although we did not observe differences in TGF-\u03b2 signaling in the absence of Drak2, there may be alternative TGF-\u03b2-mediated effects on T cell survival. Thus, we sought to determine if the survival defect in Drak2 -/-T cells compared to wildtype T cells was due to enhanced TGF-\u03b2 signaling. To test this, we compared T cell survival between wildtype and Drak2 -/-T cells that exhibit impaired TGF-\u03b2 signaling due to expression of a dominant-negative TGF-\u03b2 receptor II (DNRII) transgene. The DNRII transgene is a kinase-dead mutant that blocks signaling through the endogenous TGF-\u03b2 receptor by competing for TGF-\u03b2 binding [17] . Na\u00efve CD4 + and CD8 + T cells were sorted from wildtype, Drak2 -/-, DNRII, and DNRII.Drak2 -/mice. The purified T cells were stimulated in vitro with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28. We found that even with the severe reduction in TGF-\u03b2 signaling, there was an increase in the proportion of nonviable DNRII.Drak2 -/-CD4 + (Fig 6a, right portion of graph) and CD8 + (Fig 6b, right portion of graph) T cells compared to DNRII CD4 + and CD8 + T cells. These data show that the enhanced death in the Drak2 -/-T cells following in vitro stimulation is not due to increased TGF\u03b2 signaling, and suggest that alternative signaling pathways play a role.",

Mutations that lead to tumorigenesis could facilitate a role for Drak2 regulation in TGF-\u03b2 signaling. Thus, as reported in certain tumors, Drak2 may function to negatively regulate TGF-\u03b2 signaling and promote tumorigenesis [12] . However, this is contrary to other reports that describe Drak2 as a tumor suppressor [18] [19] [20] . Therefore, the role of Drak2 in different types of tumors is also controversial and needs to be studied further.

The importance of Drak2 specifically in T cells during autoimmunity was highlighted in our previous studies, which demonstrated that the resistance to disease in the mouse model of multiple sclerosis was due to Drak2-deficiency in T cells [2] . In addition, we found that the resistance to type 1 diabetes was also due to the absence of Drak2 in T cells (TLH and MAM manuscript submitted).",

For example, increased levels of Smad7, a negative regulator of TGF-\u03b2 signaling [21] , could mask alterations in TGF-\u03b2 signaling in the absence of Drak2. Therefore, Drak2 -/-T cells may exhibit altered signaling pathways that function differently compared to physiological conditions in wildtype T cells, which warrants further investigation. Nevertheless, our data presented here indicate that TGF-\u03b2 signaling is not enhanced in Drak2 -/-T cells following in vitro stimulation. Consequently, Drak2 may not function as a negative regulator of TGF-\u03b2 signaling in T cells, which are critical for the induction of autoimmunity. Therefore, further investigation of the potential molecular mechanisms by which Drak2 functions during autoimmune disease is required to gain insight into the etiology of these diseases.",

Cells were harvested and replated at equal numbers with or without various cytokine combinations. Cytokines were replenished 2 days later. Cells were harvested and analyzed by flow cytometry on day 6. A) The number of live, CD8 + cells and B) percent Annexin V + of CD8 + cells are shown for each cytokine condition. Cells were obtained from one OT-I or OT-I.Drak2-/-mouse and tested in quadruplicate.
