The Global Preparedness Monitoring Board (GPMB) warns, \"The world is at acute risk for devastating regional or global disease epidemics or pandemics that not only cause loss of life but upend economies and create social chaos (82) .\" However, the GPMB report did not recognize the importance of geospatial science and POCT. Population clusters in highly vulnerable areas amplify the risk. Nonetheless, we must eliminate inequities, while also responding quickly and effectively to increasingly frequent disasters, complex crises, and epidemics. To understand how to mitigate risk, we can use geospatial science mappings and produce \"visual logistics, \" that is, easily understood graphics, flowcharts, topography maps, time contours, and other illustrations that show where, when, and how to position POCT optimally, create mobile rapid response, and implement the solutions in Table 1 .",

The spatial distribution of reported cases, including suspected cases adjusted for test positivity rates, indicates higher caseloads in the northern regions. Applying GIS-based methods and multilevel regression analysis to unique longitudinal three-wave survey data from rural Mozambique, the authors investigated the impact of a rapid expansion of HIV-related services on access to and utilization of HIV testing. The results illustrate the declining importance of spatial barriers to utilization of HIV testing services as these services expanded. In addition, the expansion of HIV-related services decreased the spatial variability of HIV testing among the survey respondents. Use of geographic information systems for placement and management of point-of-care technologies in small-world networks Point-of-care technologies afford first responders with the mobility to deliver diagnostic testing at the site of care, and because they do not rely on conventional infrastructure, are more robust for use in disasters and complex emergencies. Healthcare systems are built on geographic relationships between patients and resources that reliably provide care to them and can be thought of as SWNs. A GIS allows us to view and analyze spatial relationships among entities to draw conclusions. A GIS can quantify SWNs leading to informed decisions on improving the healthcare systems in the context of day-to-day and disaster medical management. ",

Most nodes in a SWN are not neighbors, but can be reached in a few steps. Scale-free networks have hubs of connectivity that shape the way the network operates. Hubs provide robustness to failure, a key point when improving community resilience. Hubs connect nodes locally while also connecting clusters globally, conferring SWN properties to the healthcare system.",

However, removal of a busy hub during a disaster, because of physical destruction, invasive flooding, or some other calamity can turn the SWN into an isolated graph. Hence, resilience depends in part on self-reliance at individual nodes and clusters, an attribute that POCT confers nicely by enabling evidencebased decision making and local treatment. Only a few edges (interactions) separate nodes, a property leading to the popular notion of only 6 degrees of separation between any two people in the world. Separation impacts SWNs, so separation, per se, is to be avoided. Transit and information delays among SWNs can be fixed with physical splines (e.g., transportation \"short-cuts\") and virtual connectivity (e.g., using POC disposable test modules on smartphones with built-in wireless communication).",

Figure 2 illustrates the process of discovering the characteristics and infrastructure of a SWN in rural impoverished provinces in Isaan, Northeast Thailand. Interactions, especially emergency links, infectious vectors, and other systematic and random phenomena tend to transcend simple policy, roadmaps, phone lines, cellular towers, and radio transmissions. They encompass personal and professional interactions, resource limitations, adaptable social networks, and government requirements regulating tiered use of health maintenance sites, primary care units (PCUs), clinics, community and regional hospitals, and university or referral medical centers. Their interdependencies, both routine and emergent, often cross established boundaries and bridge international borders through fluxes of supplies, laborers, professional personnel, and also, communicable diseases. Table 1 provides analysis (right column) of SWN field applications of POCT in limited-resource settings. Typically, these settings do not have helicopter or fixed-wing aircraft rescue and often lack adequate ambulance service. After successful pilot studies and educational seminars held for emergency staff, critical care nurses, and cardiologists, an executive decision was made at the national level by an academic (GK, while a Fulbright Scholar), professional, and industry team to implement approximately 700 POC cardiac troponin T (cTnT) handheld devices (cobas h 232, Roche Diagnostics) in over 500 community hospitals, revolutionizing the care of acute coronary syndrome patients in Thailand [5] . The other applications under Solution 1 demonstrate similar utility and value of POCT in SWNs. The keys are flexibility and adaptability. Well-placed POCT can make SWN response \"organic, \" that is, rapidly adaptable in the face of evolving needs and crises. Figure 3 illustrates space-time transformation of the healthcare network with analysis of mobility, geographic routes, and ambulance travel. For example, an emergency room physician in a community hospital distant from the provincial regional hospital could rule in the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction using POC cTn testing, and then, save time by transporting the patient immediately and directly to a referral site where an interventional cardiologist is available (upper left, Figure 3) , rather than routing the patient through the regional hospital in the center of the province when there is no cardiologist available. Figure 4 illustrates temporal contour map analysis in northern Nan Province of Thailand, where a team from the POCT\u2022CTR, Siriraj Hospital (Mahidol University), and the College of Population Studies (Chulalongkorn University) conducted extensive field surveys of healthcare needs, resources, transportation routes, emergency medical systems/services (EMS), radio dispatching, and delivery gaps that could be filled with POC, near-patient, or satellite laboratory testing. The right frame shows the benefit of reduced response time when there is a regional hub. Hubs arise because combining resources overcomes constraints. Contour analysis clarified trade-offs of time and locale in the province SWN. The hub hospital substantially improved the efficiency of providing care to those living near the Thailand-Laos PDR border.",

For diabetes, medical staff wanted to use immediate onsite HbA1c results to avoid long specimen transport to referral sites, week or longer delays waiting for results, time and money consuming return trips by patients, and their forfeiture of employment income. HbA1c also can help identify patients with diabetes in field facilities, quarantine, and isolation for highly infectious diseases, such as Ebola when specimens cannot be sent to the clinical laboratory for fear of contamination.

ArcGIS 10.5 (ESRI) was used to run different algorithms to identify candidate POC facilities, select facilities for POC placement, and model the different scenarios. POC VL testing reduces costs of expanding access to the hardest-to-reach populations, despite the cost of equipment and low patient volumes.

The authors present a vision where POCT accelerates an Ebola SCP and future molecular diagnostics enable facilitated-access self-testing; design an alternate care facility for the SCP; innovate an Ebola diagnostic center; and propel rapid POCT to the frontline to create resilience that stops future outbreaks.By identifying weak links in the chain of community resilience, SCPs upscale key unfulfilled needs, discover new ideas for innovation-invention, bolster educational outreach, and improve patient access to evidence-based primary, emergency, and hospital care. Strong collaborative initiatives can foster activism in the global community. It is time for insightful leadership and participative outreach to bridge professional disciplines, span different countries, and steward POC into a brilliant new future.",

            "text": "ContinuedThe authors invented a scoring metric comprising health resources, poverty levels, and diagnosticians to alleviate inequities in provinces with overburdened health systems and/or critical poverty. Scores reflect lack of primary care units, hospital beds, medical doctors, registered nurses, technical nurses, pharmacists, and medical technologists. The higher the score, the worse the situation. DCU clusters with high scores for health resources, high ratios of poor people, high numbers of poor people, and deficiencies in medical technologists were located mainly in the northeast, where POCT and unique new care paths can have a significant impact on improving outcomes and cost-effectiveness. Geodemographic linking of POCT and needs reveals where to implement fast mobile medical diagnostics and care paths that improve standards of care.Bangkok, ThailandDiagnostic testing strategies for health care delivery during the Great Bangkok Flood and other weather disastersFeasibility of POCT was demonstrated in previous flood episodes (e.g., Hurricane Katrina) and again during the Great Bangkok Flood, although on a limited basis. Preparation, training, mobility, and deployment were challenges. In addition, some medical problems required sophisticated analytical methods, such as the diagnosis of Leptospirosis by PCR, not yet amenable to testing directly at the site of need. Unmet needs ensure a bright future for innovators who develop new POC solutions and increase the mobility of diagnostic services for weather disasters. Global warming will bring more floods. Risk assessment will mitigate damage in terms of both human and economic losses.Strategic point-of-care requirements of hospitals and public health for preparedness in regions at riskThe authors studied health resources and POCT requirements for urgent, emergency, and disaster care in Phang Nga Province, Thailand, after the tragic 2004 Andaman Sea Tsunami; determined instrument design specifications through a direct needs assessment survey; described POC test menus useful in the SWN; and assessed strategies for preparedness. Respondents selected complete blood cell count, electrolytes/ chemistry, blood type, oxygen saturation (by pulse oximeter), hematocrit, and microbiology as top priorities and preferred direct blood sampling with cassettes. Cardiac biomarkers were important in alternate care facilities. Staphylococcus aureus, SARS, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and hepatitis B virus were top infectious disease problems. Temperature, vibration, humidity, and impact shock were four important environmental factors during extreme conditions. These data tell us how to integrate POCT in disaster situations.This study evolved a systematic approach to risk assessment and identified geographic sites at high risk in the event of a new Tsunami.The 2004 earthquake/Tsunami devastated Southeast Asia. The authors studied POCT and O 2 saturation monitoring in Phang Nga, the hardest hit southern coastal province, to develop preparedness strategies for low-resource SWNs. Early 2005, they surveyed 4 provinces, then, in 2007-2011, focused on Phang Nga with new field/phone/mail/e-mail/fax surveys of 7 primary care units, all 7 community hospitals, and both regional hospitals. They used short-and long-form Thai surveys, photo documented instruments, and assessed resources. Overall, preparedness for medical testing improved significantly. Value proposition strategies built on post-Tsunami advances enhance SWN POCT preparedness, as well as daily emergency care. Daily use of POCT improves chances of high quality response during crises, if the POCT is positioned shrewdly in vulnerable geographic sites. Frontiers in Public Health | www.frontiersin.org",
