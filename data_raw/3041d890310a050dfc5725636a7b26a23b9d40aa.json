            "text": "We have previously demonstrated that the replacement of the S gene from an avirulent strain (Beaudette) of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) with an S gene from a virulent strain (M41) resulted in a recombinant virus (BeauR-M41(S)) with the in vitro cell tropism of the virulent virus but that was still avirulent. In order to investigate whether any of the other structural or accessory genes played a role in pathogenicity we have now replaced these from the Beaudette strain with those from M41. The recombinant IBV was in effect a chimaeric virus with the replicase gene derived from Beaudette and the rest of the genome from M41. This demonstrated that it is possible to exchange a large region of the IBV genome, approximately 8.4 kb, using our transient dominant selection method. Recovery of a viable recombinant IBV also demonstrated that it is possible to interchange a complete replicase gene as we had in effect replaced the M41 replicase gene with the Beaudette derived gene. Analysis of the chimaeric virus showed that it was avirulent indicating that none of the structural or accessory genes derived from a virulent isolate of IBV were able to restore virulence and that therefore, the loss of virulence associated with the Beaudette strain resides in the replicase gene.

            "text": "Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses that replicate in the cell cytoplasm and contain a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of 28 to 32 kb [16] . IBV has a 27.6 kb RNA genome and like all coronaviruses contains the four structural proteins; spike glycoprotein (S), small membrane protein (E), integral membrane protein (M) and nucleocapsid protein (N) which interacts with the genomic RNA. All coronaviruses also encode a set of accessory protein genes of unknown function that are not required for replication in vitro [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] , but may play a role in pathogenesis [19, 22] . IBV encodes two accessory genes, genes 3 and 5, which both express two accessory proteins 3a, 3b and 5a, 5b, respectively. In addition to the structural and accessory genes, two-thirds of a coronavirus genome comprises the replicase gene, which expresses two polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, in which pp1ab is an extension product of pp1a as a result of a -1 ribosomal shift mechanism. The two polyproteins are cleaved by two types of virus-encoded proteinases usually resulting in 16 non-structural proteins (Nsp1-16); IBV lacks Nsp1 thereby encoding Nsp2- 16. We have previously shown that the IBV accessory genes are not required for replication in vitro [17, 18] ; however, we could not determine any role of the IBV accessory proteins in pathogenicity as our reverse genetics system is based on the avirulent Beaudette strain. Replacement of the Beaudette S gene with the corresponding M41 S gene sequence altered the tropism of the rIBV but did not result in a change in virulence [24] [25] [26] . This implied that although the IBV S gene may play a role in virulence, associated with tropism, expression of an S gene from a virulent strain alone was not sufficient to alter the avirulent phenotype associated with Beaudette.",

Previously Beaudette had been considered to be poorly immunogenic and never used as a vaccine strain [30] . In this study, we describe the generation of recombinant IBVs that consisted of the replicase gene from the avirulent Beaudette strain and the structural and accessory genes from the virulent M41 isolate of IBV, to determine whether the replicase or the combination of the structural and accessory genes of IBV play a role in pathogenesis.",

Both the Beaudette and M41 strains of IBV belong to the same, Massachusetts, serotype. All IBV strains were titrated in CK cells. Vaccinia viruses were grown and titrated on Vero cells and large stocks for DNA isolation were grown in BHK-21 cells [37] .

Briefly, 50% confluent monolayers of vero cells were infected with rVV-BeauR-Rep-DStruct, containing the Beau-R cDNA sequence, at a MOI of 0.2 and transfected 2 h later with 5 mg of pGPT-BeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-3UTR in lipofectin (Invitrogen). Resultant phenotypically GPT + rVVs were selected by three rounds of plaque purification using vero cells in the presence of 25 mg/ml mycophenolic acid (MPA), 250 mg/ml xanthine and 15 mg/ml hypoxanthine. Randomly selected MPA resistant rVVs were grown and plaque purified three times using vero cells in the absence of selection medium. This resulted in a second recombination event (see Fig. 1 ) involving the loss of the GPT gene from the rVVs, and either generation of an IBV cDNA corresponding to the sequence in rVV-BeauR-Rep-DStruct or a full-length IBV cDNA consisting of a Beau-R replicase gene and the rest of the IBV genome derived from IBV M41-CK within the VV genome (Fig. 1) . PCR was used to confirm the absence of the GPT gene in resulting rVVs, which were further screened by PCR amplification of the IBV 39-UTR, using oligonucleotides BG56 (59-26941 CAACAGCGCCCAAAGAAG 26958 ) and 93/100 (59-27607 GCTCTAACTCTATACTAGCCT 27587 -39), part of the replicase gene, using oligonucleotides BG40 (59-18941 ATC-TAATTTGCTCGTTCA 18958 -39 and BG128 (59-19720 CGCCAC-TCCTTTGTCGCTTC 19739 -39, and the junction of the replicase and  S genes using oligonucleotides BG40 (59-18941 ATCTAATT-TGCTCGTTCA 18958 -39  and  BG134 (59-21398 AGCAATT-GAAACTGAAAGTG 21417 -39.

The transfected CK cells (P 0 ) were incubated until they showed a cytopathic effect (CPE), the medium was filtered to remove any rFPV/T7 and any potential rIBV passaged three times more on CK cells (P 3 ). Total RNA from the infected P 3 CK cells was extracted and analysed by RT-PCR and spot sequence analysis. Sequence analysis showed that rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-12 contained an extra adenosine nucleotide at position 25317 in a six base polyadenosine repeat sequence within the M41 intergenic region (IGR) between the end of the M gene and start of gene 5. Consequently only rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2 from the P 3 CK cells was titrated in CK cells and used for further characterisation. Sequence analysis of the M41-CK-derived sequence in rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2 revealed three nucleotide changes when compared to the sequence in rVV-BeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2 ( Table 1 ). The nucleotide changes resulted in one amino acid change in the S protein, the other was a silent mutation and a single amino acid change in the N gene. Comparison of the sequence indicated that the changes arose during rescue or during the first three passages of the rescued viruses. ",

The birds were observed for clinical signs up to 11 days post-inoculation. At 4 and 7 days post-infection the tracheas of three randomly selected chickens from each group were examined for ciliary activity and presence of IBV. Observations for clinical signs, snicking, wheezing and nasal discharge, of an IBV infection were carried out daily on each group from three days post-infection. Only chickens inoculated with M41-CK showed any clinical signs of an IBV infection. As can be seen from figure 3, M41-CK induced high rates of snicking, which peaked by day 5 post-inoculation, whereas Beau-R and rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2 induced a much lower rate of snicking, similar to those observed for the mockinoculated chickens (Fig. 3A) . Similarly, only chickens (11-16%) inoculated with M41-CK showed any nasal discharge three, four and six days post-inoculation (Fig. 3B) . Again, wheezing was only observed in chickens inoculated with M41-CK, in which 90% of the infected chickens demonstrated wheezing by 7 days postinoculation (Fig. 3C) . Analysis of the tracheas isolated from the chickens showed that the mock, Beau-R and rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2 infected chickens had .95% ciliary activity whereas the chickens inoculated with M41-CK showed 0% ciliary activity (100% ciliostasis; Fig. 3D ). In summary, our observations of the parameters used to assess pathogenicity demonstrated that rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2 was not pathogenic and that it had the characteristics associated with Beau-R rather than M41-CK.",

Our previous results had shown that Beau-R was not reliably detected in the tracheas of Beau-R in infected chickens whereas M41-CK is detectable [26, 43] . To check for the presence of M41-CK-, Beau-R-or rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2-derived RNA in the tracheal epithelial cells from the infected chickens, total RNA was isolated from the epithelial cells and analysed by RT-PCR using oligonucleotides BG56 and 93/100, corresponding to the 39-UTR of the IBV genomes. As can be seen from Fig. 4 , the tracheal epithelial cells isolated from chickens infected with M41-CK were positive for the presence of M41-CK-derived RNA. In contrast, no IBV-derived RNA was detected in the tracheal epithelial cells of chickens infected with either Beau-R or rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2 supporting our virus isolation data. Furthermore, sequence analysis of the IBV-derived RT-PCR product amplified from the tracheal epithelial cells of chickens infected with M41-CK confirmed that it was derived from IBV M41-CK. This was consistent with previous results suggesting that Beau-R probably does not reach the tracheas of chickens infected by the eye-drop and intranasal routes and that similarly rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2 did not appear to reach the epithelial cells of the tracheas of infected chickens. A rIBV, BeauR-M41(S) [24] , which consisted of the Beau-R genome but with an M41-derived S gene, had the tropism of M41 in vitro but the characteristics of Beau-R in vivo indicating, together with our rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2 result, that the inability of Beau-R-derived viruses to reach the tracheas of infected chickens resides within the replicase gene.",

Although our results showed swapping of the S gene did not result in virulence we could not rule out the fact that other IBV structural (E, M and N) and accessory (3a, 3b, 5a and 5b) genes may also play a role and therefore be required for the acquisition of virulence. We therefore decided to exchange the region of the Beau-R genome from the end of the replicase gene to the poly(A) tail with the corresponding sequence from M41-CK to investigate whether exchange of the structural and accessory genes was sufficient to confer pathogenicity to a resultant chimaeric rIBV, rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct. Such an approach would also allow us to determine whether or not the replicase gene plays a role in the pathogenicity of IBV. IBV Beaudette is a well known apathogenic lab strain of IBV that was attenuated by multiple, several hundred, passages in 11-day-old embryonic chicks [30] , therefore loss of virulence could have resulted in multiple changes throughout the genome. IBV Beau-R is a molecular clone of Beaudette-CK [35] ) that is also avirulent in chickens [26] .",

We have used our IBV reverse genetics system [24, 25, 35] to produce chimaeric IBV, rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct, consisting of the replicase gene from Beaudette (Beau-R) and the S, 3a, 3b, E, M, 5a, 5b, N and the 39-UTR from M41-CK. The M41-CK-derived structural and accessory gene sequence was fused to the Beau-R replicase by homologous recombination using the TDS method [25, 37] and rIBVs were rescued in CKCs. The M41-CK-derived region, in addition to the structural and accessory genes in common with Beau-R, also contains an untranslated region, the intergenic untranslated region (IGR), between the M and gene 5, which is 305 nt in Beaudette and 350 nt in M41-CK. The M41-CK IGR, like some other strains of IBV, contains a potential open reading frame (ORF) of 285 nt potentially encoding a 94 amino acid product of 11 kD with the initiation codon immediately downstream of the M gene stop codon. A similar ORF has been identified at a similar position in the genome of turkey coronavirus (TCoV) [5, 6] , the only TRS identified for TCoV is 288 nt upstream of the potential ORF, within the M gene, but with low identity to the TCoV canonical TRS. No sg mRNA for this potential ORF has been identified in TCoV or IBV, including M41-CK, infected cells. The lack of a sg mRNA, the long distance between the initiation codon and a potential TRS and the loss of the potential ORF, as a result of several deletions, in some strains of IBV indicates that the ORF is probably a pseudogene.",

The rIBV rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2 was able to replicate in TOCs, though the amount of virus produced was about 1 log 10 less than for the growth of Beau-R and M41-CK, somewhat analogous to the growth pattern observed for the virus on CKCs.",

There are known differences between IBV 39 UTRs, in fact the M41-CK 39-UTR is 184 nt smaller than the Beau-R 39-UTR, the remaining part of the M41-CK 39-UTR representing the conserved region of the IBV 39-UTR and contains the predicted RNA secondary structures believed to be involved in replication [44] . There are 7 and 3 nucleotide differences between the 59-and the conserved region of the IBV 39-UTRs, respectively, of Beau-R and M41-CK ( [33, 42] , raising the possibility that if the two UTRs interact during replication their heterologous nature could be responsible for the observed decrease in growth for rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2 in both CKCs and TOCs. Impairment in growth on TOCs may also have been responsible for the loss of ciliostasis. We hypothesised that an increase in growth would be a selective advantage to the virus and therefore decided to serially passage rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2 25 times on CKCs to see whether any adaption could result in a higher growth rate and a virus that could cause ciliostasis in TOCs. For example, due to the very few differences in the 59-and 39-UTRs, between the two parental viruses, a nucleotide substitution in either UTR that may result in a more homogenous interaction, as seen with either parental virus, may result in an increase growth rate. Analysis of the passaged virus, rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2-P 25 , on CKCs and TOCs showed an altered growth rate in comparison to rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2-P 3 (Fig. 6) . However, rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2-P 25 still did not cause ciliostasis in TOCs. Sequence analysis of the 59-and 39-UTRs of rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2-P 25 showed that there were no nucleotide substitutions within these regions when compared to rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2-P 3 , indicating that the change in the growth characteristics was not associated with changes in the UTRs. We therefore sequenced the entire genome of rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2-P 25 for comparison with the sequence in rVV-BeauR-Rep-M41-Struct, used for generating rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2-P 3 , in order to identify any potential changes that may have been responsible for the phenotypic change in growth. We identified three nucleotide changes between the P 3 and P 25 viruses, one resulted in an amino acid change, PheRLeu, in the S1 region of the S gene and two adjacent nucleotides in the ORF-5b sequence that had two potential effects, (1) the introduction of a premature stop codon in ORF-5b and (2) modification the N gene TRS. These observations indicate that the increase in growth associated with rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2-P 25 could have arisen from the amino acid change in the S protein, the loss of ORF-5b or a potential change in the expression levels of sg mRNA 6, which is responsible for the expression of the N protein. Overall, the main conclusion from our results is the fact that rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2 was nonpathogenic; indicating that the loss of virulence associated with Beaudette is not determined by the structural and the accessory genes of IBV but resides within the replicase gene.",

[45] who reported that the differences in pathogenicity between two strains of the murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), MHV-JHM and MHV-A59, mapped to the MHV genome encoding the structural and accessory genes downstream of the haemagglutinin esterase (HE) gene. The replicase gene was interchangeable between the two virus genomes but the differences in pathogenicities associated with two viruses did not appear to correlate with the replicase genes of the rMHVs generated. However, a major difference between the two MHV isolates and the two IBV viruses we used was that the two MHVs were pathogenic but demonstrated different pathogenicities, neurovirulence and hepatitis, respectively, whereas the difference between the two IBV isolates used in this work was that one causes disease and the other does not. It is clear from the MHV work that both replicase sequences are of a ''virulent'' phenotype and that the pathogenicity phenotype of the recombinant viruses is associated with the structural and accessory genes. In contrast our results demonstrated that loss of virulence per se can be determined by some attenuating modification to one or more of the coronavirus replicase components. Recent work involving the attenuation of a nephropathogenic strain of IBV by serial passage in embryonated chicken eggs, reported that the virus became fully attenuated by passage P 110 [46] . Sequence analysis of the 39-7 kb (S gene to poly(A) tail) region of the genome from the P 110 virus identified several amino acid substitutions and a 109 nt deletion within the 39 UTR when compared to P 0 virus. The authors reported that the changes identified were potentially responsible for attenuation; they did not report any changes within the replicase gene of the P 110 virus and indicated that other changes, apart from those identified in the 39-7 kb region, within the genome may also be involved in attenuation. Other workers attenuated the virulent Ark DPI 11 strain of IBV following 101 passages in embryonated eggs (Ark DPI 101) and compared the complete genomes of both viruses; identifying 21 nucleotide changes corresponding to 17 amino acid changes [47] . The nucleotide changes resulted in eight amino acid changes in Nsp2 (1), Nsp3 (3), Nsp6 (2), Nsp10 (1) and Nsp13 (1) of the replicase protein, eight amino acid changes in the S protein and one amino acid in ORF 5a and the N protein. The authors were unable to confirm which amino acid changes were responsible for loss of pathogenicity. Taking into consideration our results that loss of virulence associated with the Beaudette strain resides in the replicase and the results of Ammayappan et al. [47] , it is possible that very few amino acid substitutions within the replicase gene can result in attenuation following serial passage in embryonated eggs.",

How these proteins function in the context of pathogenesis is still not well understood, however, some of the Nsps for other coronaviruses have been linked to loss of virulence. For example, the loss of Nsp1 from MHV did not affect replication in tissue culture but severely attenuated the rMHV in vivo [49] ; inactivation of the MHV ADP-ribose-10phosphatase activity in Nsp3 caused a reduction in virus replication in the livers of infected mice but did not induce liver disease [50] and a single amino acid change in the MHV Nsp14 did not alter the replication of the rMHV in tissue culture but resulted in attenuation in mice [51] .",

Results from work described here has shown that replacing all the Beaudette structural and accessory proteins with those from a virulent isolate of IBV did not restore virulence. Generation of the rIBV produced in this work can either be viewed as replacing the structural and accessory genes of an avirulent virus with those of a virulent virus or replacing the replicase gene of a virulent isolate (M41-CK) with one from an avirulent virus (Beau-R). In either scenario our results indicate that loss of virulence associated with IBV Beaudette resides within one or more of the 15 IBV replicase proteins comprising the IBV replicase gene.",

Clinical signs were recorded from days 3 to 11 post-infection in which clinical signs were recorded for individual birds, apart for snicking where signs were observed from a group. The clinical signs recorded were (A) snicking, (B) nasal discharge (mean of all birds), (C) wheezing (mean of all birds) and (D) ciliary activity in tracheal rings (mean of 10 tracheal rings from three individual chicks per group). doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0007384.g003recombinant viruses. As there are only 7 and 3 nucleotide difference between the 59-UTR and the conserved region of the 39-UTR, respectively, from Beau-R and M41-CK we decided to serially passage rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2 25 times on CK cells to see whether this would result in a virus with a higher growth rate and that could cause ciliostasis in TOCs and to determine in the P 25 -derived virus whether this was a result of any nucleotide substitutions in either of the UTRs or any other region of the genome that may account for any potential change in phenotype.",

Sequence analysis of rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2-P 25 identified a dinucleotide substitution, UURAA, which resulted in a premature stop codon in ORF 5b. The figure compares the sequence chromatograms showing the acquisition of the stop codon in the virus genomes following passage of rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2-P 3 (P 3 ) through to rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2-P 25 (P 25 ). The line highlights the second nucleotide of the pair, showing that at passage 5 the rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2 was a mixed population and that it appeared both substitutions occurred simultaneously and that by P 15 rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2 preferentially contained the substituted nucleotides. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0007384.g007",
