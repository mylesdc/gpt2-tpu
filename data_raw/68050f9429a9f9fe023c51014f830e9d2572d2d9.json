Average age of people affected by this intractable disease is quite young, at about 38 years old. [1] [2] [3] Early detection of ONFH is key to achieving good curative results. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] Currently, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is universally accepted as the most accurate method for its early diagnosis. [2, 3, 10, 11] However, there is a delay between corticosteroid use and ONFH development [12, 13] and even after ONFH has emerged, it may not be detectable on MRI. [14, 15] Knowledge of this timeline is essential to explore the mechanism of ONFH, to design interventions to reduce the occurrence of ONFH, and to develop screening plans for high-risk patients.",

All patients were rescreened by MRI 4 years later, which revealed no new lesions. [17] For ONFH patients requiring continuous steroid use for treatment of background diseases, no expansion of the necrotic lesion was found. [18] In a prospective study of 291 joints in 106 SLE patients without osteonecrosis after initial steroid therapy, only 6 joints developed new osteonecrosis, which only occurred after SLE recurrence in association with increased steroid doses. New lesions were delayed for a mean of 5.9 years after initial steroid administration. Mean time from SLE recurrence to appearance of new lesions was 6.2 months. [19] Our results are consistent with those of previous studies. In this study, average time between steroid administration and initial MRI scan was 45.7 \u00b1 25.5 days (range, 10-94 days) and between steroid administration and ONFH diagnosis was 199.9 \u00b1 165.8 days (range, 32-762 days). All of these studies indicated that the adverse effects of steroid-induced osteonecrosis are time limited. Onset of ONFH might be assumed to occur 0 to 6 months after steroid use, with presentation on MRI 1 to 6 months after steroid therapy.",

            "text": "ONFH is an intractable disease that affects relatively young, active patients, with a mean age of 36 to 38 years. [2, 3, 11] Most asymptomatic ONFH cases will develop to symptomatic ONFH within 5 years. Untreated ONFH has a poor outcome and often leads to subchondral collapse within a short period. [20, 21] Surgical head-preserving procedures are helpful to relieve pain and improve function of the affected femoral heads only in the early stage. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] Most patients must undergo total hip arthroplasty when the femoral head collapsed. Even with great progress in the design and technology of prostheses, revision (with unfavorable prognosis) is needed 20 to 30 years later. [22, 23] Thus, early diagnosis is very important for a good prognosis. Knowledge of the time lag between steroid use and MRIdetectable disease can aid us in making a detailed and reasonable screening plan. In this study, 21 cases with discomfort were misdiagnosed because the initial MRI presentation was normal. Twelve hips progressed to the collapsed stage, and 1 received lumbar discectomy after the final diagnosis. All of these events could be avoided if another MRI were performed 6 to 12 months after steroid therapy.",

Although granulation tissue development is a physiological response that contains the lesion and promotes healing, the subsequently formed fibrosis and sclerotic bone act as a barrier to revascularization of the bone marrow and the transport of the cytokines and other cellular mediators needed to remodel the bone. Necrotic bone has poor biomechanical properties. When mechanical constraints exceed bone resistance, stress fracture occurs, resulting in femoral head collapse and hip osteoarthritis. The use of some drugs, such as lipid-lowering drugs, anticoagulants, vasodilators, and traditional Chinese medicines, during the time lag period may reduce occurrence of necrosis. [24, 25] Other methods, such as electromagnetic stimulation, extracorporeal shock-wave therapy, hyperbaric oxygen, and core decompression, may alter the prognosis of ONFH. [7] [8] [9] Previous studies [26, 27] reported that some patients experienced pain, mostly involving the hip and knee joints, early after treatment with steroids. In general, this \"fleeting joint pain\" is severe, lasts up to a week, and is accompanied by negative imaging results. Fleeting joint pain may resolve by itself or be treated with calcium antagonists. The mechanism of fleeting joint pain has yet to be elucidated but may be related to corticosteroid impulse therapy. In this study, 12/21 patients complained of short-term pain 4 to 30 days (average 14.7 \u00b1 8.3 days) after steroid therapy. Another MRI was performed when the pain recurred. These patients met the criteria of fleeting joint pain syndrome. The remaining 9 patients complained of pain later, 52.0 \u00b1 22.3 days after steroid therapy. This pain persisted until osteonecrosis was confirmed by a second MRI examination.",
