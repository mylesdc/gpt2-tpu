However, typical model forms focus largely on the epidemiological characteristics of the disease at the time of emergence, and while such models may be used as a platform for projection of intervention effects, they seldom explicitly account for the behavioral, regulatory, and informational interventions that are either put into place by public health authorities, or occur spontaneously in a worried public, once knowledge of an epidemic is widespread [12] . Such limitations can be overcome post-hoc through model fitting and calibration, but insights from models would be most helpful early in outbreaks and epidemics, when such data is almost uniformly unavailable. Standard mathematical models that attempt to project outbreak duration and final size based on initial characteristics will predictably overestimate final outbreak size, since reproduction numbers decline not only due to depletion of susceptible individuals, but also to spontaneous and planned control activities and behaviours [1, 13, 14] .",

The rate of growth of an epidemic is a function of both R 0 and the average serial interval, which is defined as the time between symptoms developing in an index case and symptoms developing in a secondary case [11, 15] . We use a symptom-based interval so that the IDEA model is applicable in situations where microbiological or serological diagnosis is not available.

As this process continues, the effective reproduction number R is often defined as R 0 x S/N, where S/N is the proportion of the population that remains susceptible to infection (defined as S = number of susceptibles divided by N = total population size), and the decline in R with time results in ultimate termination of the epidemic. However, many outbreaks rapidly dampen after a short period of time, in a manner that cannot be attributed to a decline in susceptibles [1, 13, 14, 16] . A potential mechanism driving decline in epidemics in the presence of susceptibles is spontaneous or planned reduction in the components of R 0 itself (disease duration, contact rate, and infectiousness of cases) either because of public health interventions, or due to concern about disease among members of the public. As a decline in R for this reason is unlikely to be estimable in real time in the context of an outbreak, we propose that control be modeled empirically in a time-varying manner analogous to a financial discounting function.

Re t is a function of the basic reproductive number, R 0 . Typically, Re t is expressed as R 0 S t /N but such a formulation fails to account for control activities and dynamic changes in population behavior that may reduce transmissibility of infection. We defined Re t as: Re t = R 0 k t S t /N where k is a function of time and represents the proportionate reduction of risk of transmission via control activities. k t is defined as the relative risk of disease transmission (RR) raised to some power, such that k t = RR x . Here x is some exponential function of t such that x = t n and n is an integer . = 0. We refer to n as the ''order'' of control. For 0 th order control, the impact of control does not change over time, and Re is simply reduced by a constant fraction throughout the epidemic. For first order control, disease risk is reduced in a manner that accelerates with time; second and third order control represent ''accelerating acceleration of control'', and so on.",

As a result, the IDEA model was used to compare actual versus projected cases as a means of judging whether the outbreak was under control. Figure 6a shows the Nunavut outbreak with the actual cases of influenza on the 6 axis and the cases projected by IDEA model on the y axis. Each point on the y axis represents the model fitted to i generations and applied to i+1 generations. On average, projections to the next generation are correct within 20.3% [95% credible interval 11.8, 28.8]. In Figure 6a we propose that when y.x, the model is projecting excess cases, implying that at this snapshot in the outbreak, the current generation had slowed its growth. Similarly, as the outbreak shifts to the y,x side of the line, the model is projecting a total case count lower than the actual outbreak, implying that the outbreak is uncontrolled and that the current generation has exceeded the model's projection. Figure 6b shows the trend in percent error as the outbreak progresses and demonstrates that after the seventh serial interval the percent error remains below 22%.",

            "text": "With the development of the IDEA model, we have demonstrated a simple, versatile model for emerging communicable disease outbreaks that has the capacity to provide short term projections of outbreak growth and contraction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of this particular descriptor to epidemic growth, though other fitting methods of varying complexity are well described [25, 28, 29, 30] . However, Wu and Huberman have previously described an approach similar to that outlined above to describe the growth and decay of interest in news items on the Internet, with exponential growth countered by a ''discount factor'' that damps the ''reproductive number'' for page sharing as a function of time [31] . We found that best-fit projections for the IDEA model for disease dynamic systems with low or intermediate R 0 were exceedingly good, with parameters derived within 3-4 generations able to project the full extent of Figure 6 . Utility of the IDEA model in evaluating the impact of public health and social or environmental factors on outbreak behaviour. (a) The utility of the IDEA model in evaluating the level of control over the outbreak. Each projection is based on the outbreak up to i intervals, projected to the i+1 th interval. With the exception of serial intervals 6 and 7 illustrated in the figure, the projected case counts were less than the actual case counts implying that at each serial interval the outbreak grew more than would be expected by its previous course. During this outbreak, the model underestimated the actual number of cases except during two serial intervals. (b) Percent error between the projection for the next generation and actual case counts according to generation. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0083622.g006 simulated epidemics with remarkable accuracy. If validated, the implications of such a finding may be profound (e.g., the ability to project, with a high degree of accuracy, the final size and duration of a seasonal influenza outbreak within 2 weeks of onset).",

Nonetheless, the application of this technique to high R 0 epidemics may be useful for a variety of reasons: first, early (preepidemic peak) IDEA estimates of R 0 closely matched true R 0 values in simulations, suggesting that the use of this technique for early R 0 estimation when novel diseases emerge may be reasonable regardless of whether R 0 is low or high. Furthermore, the Dd metric, and the abrupt shift in R 0 estimates that occurs with the epidemic peak would provide a helpful signal to epidemiologists that the epidemic is peaking or changing. Finally, as parameter estimates stabilize again for high R 0 systems, the IDEA model remains a useful tool for projecting the total size and duration of an outbreak. It is also possible that challenges in fitting the IDEA model to simulated data represent not a limitation of the IDEA model, but are rather an artefact of our use of SIR difference equation models, which tend to peak and collapse suddenly with at high R 0 .",

The model's main asset is its simplicity and the fact that it does not require consideration of population immune status for parameterization. The model is constructed entirely on a case count time series that is likely to be available to public health professionals charged with outbreak control. IDEA requires no sophisticated knowledge of mathematics or computing, and can be realized using commonly available spreadsheet programs. The model's outputs, which include both cumulative case counts under best-fit conditions, and cumulative outbreak duration, would be valuable to front-line public health professionals seeking to budget material and human resources needed to see an outbreak through to its conclusion. This simplicity may make the model especially useful in resource-limited settings where rapid assessment of both outbreak behaviour, and change in outbreak behaviour is needed.",

            "text": "File S1 Combined file of supporting figures. Figure A : IDEA estimates of total epidemic size and duration. The figure plots percent deviation of the IDEA model from simulated epidemic size data (gray dashed curve) and epidemic duration data (black dashed curve) with increasing basic reproductive number (R 0 ). Across a broad range of values of R 0 , final size estimates from the IDEA model remained accurate. However, when R 0 exceeded a threshold of ,6, there was an increasing tendency for the IDEA model to project the epidemic to end later than was in fact the case. This may represent a limitation of the IDEA model, but may also be an artifact of the sudden ''collapse'' of epidemics with high R 0 in SIR simulations. Figure B : IDEA estimates of R 0 and d by generations of data available. Estimated values of R 0 derived via IDEA model fits, according to generations of data available, with varying R 0 , from SIR model simulations with first order control. True R 0 values are presented in the legend; fitted R 0 estimates are presented on the Y-axis. It can be seen for R 0 , = 5, best-fit R 0 values and true R 0 values agree closely. High R 0 models demonstrate similar concordance prior to epidemic peaks (which occur for high R 0 models in generations highlighted by the shaded rectangle). However, in order to reproduce peaks and subsequent declines, IDEA model fits to simulated epidemic curves required higher R 0 values than true R 0 values, or R 0 estimates obtained prior to the epidemic peak. Figure C : IDEA estimates of R 0 and d by generations of data available. Estimated values of the ''discount factor'' d derived via IDEA model fits, according to generations of data available, with varying R 0 , from SIR model simulations with first order control. True R 0 values are presented in the legend; Estimates of d are presented on the Y-axis. It can be seen for R 0 , = 5, d stabilizes with a value of around 0.054, in fewer than 5 generations and remains stable. High R 0 models demonstrate similar stability in d (and empiric values of d) prior to epidemic peaks (which occur for high R 0 models in generations highlighted by the shaded rectangle). However, in order to reproduce peaks and subsequent declines, IDEA model fits to simulated epidemic curves required extremely high d values; the greater the true R 0 the higher the value of d required to reproduce the epidemic curve in its totality. Figure D : Impact of under-reporting. Impact of under-reporting of cases generated using SIR difference model on IDEA model fits, as assessed with final-size-normalized root-mean-squared differences (RMSD). It can be seen that over a range of simulated R 0 utilized in the SIR model, fits remained good except where under-reporting resulted in extremely small absolute case numbers. This is reflected in the fact that low-R 0 fits are more sensitive to underreporting than high R 0 fits. The legend presents R 0 values used in SIR models. Figure E : Impact of under-reporting. Impact of under-reporting of cases generated using SIR difference model on best-fit estimates of the discount factor d generated using the IDEA model. Best-fit values of d, based on a complete 30 generation time series, are robust in the face of a wide range of under-reporting but become unstable when very small absolute numbers of cases are reported. Figure F : Impact of underreporting. Impact of under-reporting of cases generated using SIR difference model on best-fit estimates of R 0 generated using the IDEA model. Best-fit values of R 0 values are fairly stable; notably, as under-reporting increases, the best estimate of R 0 for the high-R 0 SIR outputs actually becomes a progressively better approximation of the true R 0 . Figure G : IDEA fits to biphasic epidemic. A biphasic epidemic was simulated using the SIR difference model with an R 0 of 3, as described in the text (solid black curve). IDEA model fits, based on early generations (pale gray curve, for generations up to generation 16, prior to the onset of the second wave) and on all generations up to and including the peak of the second wave (dashed curve) are superimposed on the biphasic epidemic curve. The IDEA model's structure makes fitting to multiple peaks impossible; the best-fit IDEA model is based on parameters that create a single peak epidemic with a duration similar to that seen with the biphasic epidemic. Figure   H : IDEA fits to biphasic epidemic. Best estimates of R 0 and d for a biphasic epidemic, according to the number of generations available for model fitting. It can be seen that fits are perturbed by the onset of a second peak. The difference in d between sequential fits increases with the second wave (denoted by the shaded area), such that increases in this delta d parameter represent a potentially useful indicator of the onset of a second epidemic wave.
