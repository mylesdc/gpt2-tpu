            "text": "Selection of reference genes has become an integral step in any real time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) based expression studies. The importance of this study stems from the fact that riverine buffaloes are major dairy species of Indian sub-continent and the information generated here will be of great interest to the investigators engaged in functional genomic studies of this important livestock species. In this study, an effort was made to evaluate a panel of 10 candidate reference genes (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), beta-actin (ACTB), ubiquitously expressed transcript (UXT), ribosomal protein S15 (RPS15), ribosomal protein L-4 (RPL4), ribosomal protein S9 (RPS9), ribosomal protein S23 (RPS23), hydroxymethylbilane synthase (HMBS), \u03b22 Microglobulin (\u03b22M) and eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha 1 (EEF1A1) across 12 tissues (mammary gland, kidney, spleen, liver, heart, intestine, ovary, lung, muscle, brain, subcutaneous fat and testis) of riverine buffaloes. In addition to overall analysis, tissue wise evaluation of expression stability of individual RG was also performed. Three different algorithms provided in geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper softwares were used to evaluate the stability of 10 potential reference genes from different functional classes. The M-value given by geNorm ranged from 0.9797 (RPS9 and UXT) to 1.7362 (RPS15). From the most stable to the least stable, genes were ranked as: UXT/RPS9> RPL4> RPS23> EEF1A1> ACTB> HMBS> GAPDH> B2M> RPS15. While NormFinder analysis ranked the genes as: UXT> RPS23> RPL4> RPS9> EEF1A1> HMBS> ACTB> \u03b22M> GAPDH> RPS15. Based on the crossing point SD value and range of fold change expression, BestKeeper analysis ranked the genes as: RPS9> RPS23/UXT> RPL4> GAPDH> EEF1A1> ACTB> HMBS> \u03b22M> RPS15. Overall the study has identified RPS23, RPS9, RPL4 and UXT genes to be the most stable and appropriate RGs that could be utilized for normalization of transcriptional data in various tissues of buffaloes. This manuscript thus provide useful information on panel of reference genes that could be helpful for researchers conducting functional genomic studies in riverine buffaloes.",

            "text": "The riverine buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) is major livestock species of India that plays an important role in agricultural economy due to its dairy, meat and draught potential. It contributes more than half of the total milk production of India [1] . As buffalo is the major livestock species and milk contributor for Indian subcontinent, therefore concerted efforts on genomic and transcriptomic studies to determine gene functions, gene networks and biological pathways for various phenomic traits needs to be strengthened. Understanding expressed genes pattern is critical to provide insights into complex regulatory networks and for identification of genes relevant to new biological processes. Among the array of techniques available, quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) is a well-established and widely used technique to quantify precise mRNA levels of target gene of interest in different biological samples. Due to its several benefits over the conventional methods of measuring RNA, like higher sensitivity, large dynamic range and potential for high throughput, the technique has revolutionized the approach to analyze the gene expression patterns in various fields of biological research [2] [3] [4] . However the expression data from qPCR studies needs normalization as this technique is prone to analytical variations. To achieve accurate quantification, it is quite essential to take into account the variations that might occur due to differing amount of starting material, pipetting errors, efficiencies of RNA extraction and reverse transcription. Use of internal control genes (ICGs) or reference genes (RGs) with constant expression level between samples in response to experimental treatment or physiological state, are now considered as effective method for normalization of transcriptional data to account for the experimental variations. This approach has been widely used in different cell types and tissues in various species [5] [6] [7] . In past though, trend was to use only single reference gene; mostly GAPDH, ACTB or 18S rRNA to normalize the real time PCR data. However, now it is an established notion that for each experimental set-up, proper evaluation of multiple RGs is crucial to avoid variations and use of single reference gene for normalization of qPCR data is inappropriate [8] . Therefore, number of studies have successfully been conducted to identify least regulated and stably expressed RGs [9] [10] [11] across tissues of various species such as human, pig, sheep, bovines etc [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . To our knowledge, not much information is available on set of suitable reference genes that can be used in lactation or physiological studies in riverine buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis) although few studies have been performed in specific cell types/tissues [19] [20] [21] . Considering the fact that choice of suitable reference/RGs genes is crucial for accurate expression profiling of target genes, this study presents the information on panel of appropriate RGs across 12 buffalo tissues. Such information will be a useful resource to normalize the qPCR based expression data generated across tissues during various physiological or metabolic studies in riverine buffaloes.",

After extraction, RNA was purified using RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Germany) and then subsequently followed by on-column digestion with the RNase-free DNase (Qiagen). The RNA was quantified using Nanodrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies). RNA integrity was confirmed by denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis as well as checking the RIN value of representative RNA samples using experion Bioanalyser (BioRad, USA). The RNA samples were stored at -80\u02daC till further use. First strand cDNA was synthesized using 100ng RNA as described in our previous studies [7, 19] using the program: 25\u02daC for 5 min, 50\u02daC for 60 min, and 70\u02daC for 15 min. cDNA was then diluted 1:4 (v:v) with DNase/RNase free water. Sufficient cDNA was prepared in a single run to perform the qPCR experiments for all selected genes. The primer details for reference genes are given in Table 1 . Primers specificity was confirmed in 20 \u03bcL PCR reaction using the similar protocol as described for qPCR except for the final dissociation protocol. 5 \u03bcL of the PCR product was run in a 2% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. The accuracy of primer pairs was also ensured by the presence of a unique peak during the dissociation step at the end of qPCR. PCR efficiency (E) for each primer pair was calculated on the basis of slope of standard curve using equation: E = 10 (1/-slope) .",

The analysis showed that V2/V3 combination gave slightly higher V value (0.304) than the acceptable limit (recommended cut off value of 0.15) (Fig 3) . However, with the addition of RPS23 in V3/V4 gene combination, some drop in V value was observed (0.228). Though this value was also little higher than the standard acceptable V value, however considering the 12 diverse type of tissues evaluated in the study, the value of 0.228 was considered to be in acceptable range. Few studies [25] [26] [27] have also indicated slightly higher V value. In our opinion, for studies handling diverse sample types, V value 0.15 should be considered as a suggestive threshold criteria and not necessarily a universal cut-off criteria in deciding the number of genes to be used to calculate normalization factor. The V value threshold vary according to the biological system and type of samples being evaluated. Therefore, we used the lowest Vn/n+1 value (0.228) to determine the number of RGs adequate for normalization. Based on the gene stability and pair wise analysis, UXT, RPS9, RPL4 and RPS23 were found to be the appropriate RGs for normalization of expression data across 12 buffalo tissues.",

The relationship between RG and BestKeeper was described in terms of Pearson correlation coefficient (r), coefficient of determination (r 2 ) and the p value. p<0.05 was obtained for all genes indicating a significant contributions of all genes towards the index. The best correlation between BestKeeper and RG was observed for \u03b22M (r = 0.808), UXT (r = 0.759) and HMBS (r = 0.736) followed by RPS23 (r = 0.703), RPL4/EEF1A1 Reference genes for qPCR studies across tissues of riverine buffaloes (r = 0.639), RPS15 (0.492) and RPS9 (r = 0.481). The high correlation values for these genes indicated their reliability as reference genes except \u03b22M, HMBS and EEF1A1 which although showed high correlation value but they showed high x fold change values of 3.11, 2.53 and 2.32 (Table 3 ) respectively making them unsuitable as RGs. UXT was termed as best reference gene based on the highest correlation value and RPS9 was best RG on the lowest SD and fold change values. The statistically significant correlation shown by these RGs with the BestKeeper index appeared to be consistent with their evaluation as assessed by geNorm and NormFinder.",

Our data showed that UXT, RPS23, RPL4 and RPS9 were the most reliable and stable RGs as identified using all the three algorithms. Further, it was found that \u03b22M and RPS15 were the least stable genes as they showed highest expression variability making them non-suitable RGs for normalization of data. In our study, the ranking of most stable RGs utilizing these different algorithms were comparable to a large extent. In recent past, our groups has conducted number of similar Reference genes for qPCR studies across tissues of riverine buffaloes studies to identify appropriate reference gene panels for application in transcriptional studies in Indian native cattle and riverine buffaloes. In one such study, \u03b22M, RPS9 and RPS15a genes were identified as best RGs for heat stressed mononuclear cells of Indian cattle and buffaloes [19] ; \u03b22M, RPS23, RPL4 and EEF1A1 as most reliable RGs in heat stressed mammary explants and mammary epithelial cells of buffaloes [6, 7] ; RPL4, EEF1A1, ACTB and GAPDH genes were found to be most stable genes in milk derived mammary epithelial cells in Sahiwal cows during different lactation stages [30] . Similarly identification of stable reference genes for transcriptional studies in bulls distinctive in meat quality [5] and in buffalo muscle tissue [31] were also reported. Terzi and coworkers [32] have followed a different approach wherein, EST transcripts from publicly available Bos taurus database were evaluated across different tissues of water buffaloes. In their study, they could identify ribosomal proteins L4, L5 and Gek protein encoding genes as stably expressed transcripts and suggested them to be used as normalizers to compare gene expression levels across buffalo tissues. In our study, we observed unstable expression of two of the most commonly used RGs, ACTB and GAPDH across different tissue. In the past, large number of studies have used GAPDH and ACTB as single control gene [33] to normalize the qPCR data. However several studies have shown that the expression of these reference genes gets affected by the experimental conditions [17] . Hence one should properly evaluate the commonly used genes in any cell type or tissue of interest for correct interpretation of qPCR results.",
