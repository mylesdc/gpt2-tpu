Using an edge-based compartmental approach and percolation tools, we find that a time-dependent quantity W S (t), namely, the probability that a given neighbor of a node is susceptible at time t, is the control parameter of a node void percolation process involving those nodes on the network not-reached by the disease. We show that there exists a critical time t c above which the giant susceptible component is destroyed. As a consequence, in order to preserve a macroscopic connected fraction of the network composed by healthy individuals which guarantee its functionality, any mitigation strategy should be implemented before this critical time t c . Our theoretical results are confirmed by extensive simulations of the SIR process.",

Recent outbreaks of new influenza strains like the H1N1 [1] and the H5N5 flu or the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) [2] , which are characterized by a high rate of mortality and/or fast propagation velocity, motivate the development of epidemic models that capture the main features of the spread of those diseases.

            "text": "One of the simplest models that reproduce seasonal diseases, such as influenza, is the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model [3, 4] , which has been the subject of extensive theoretical and numerical research on complex networks [3] . In the SIR model the individuals can be in one of three states, susceptible, infected or recovered. In its discrete formulation [5] [6] [7] , at each time step, infected individuals infect their susceptible neighbors with probability b and recover at a fixed time t r since they were infected, called recovery time. According to these rules, the disease spreads on the contact network until it reaches the steady state where there are only susceptible and recovered individuals. It was found that the steady state of the SIR model can be mapped into a link percolation problem which provides a theoretical framework to study this process [6, [8] [9] [10] . It is known that the size of the infection, defined as the fraction of recovered individuals at the steady state, is governed by the effective probability of infection or transmissibility T of the disease which depends on b and t r . In the SIR model, the size of the infection is the order parameter of a second order phase transition with a critical threshold transmis-sibility T c . Below T c the disease is an outbreak, where the infection reaches a small fraction of the population while above T c an epidemic develops exactly as in a link percolation process [6, [8] [9] [10] . In uncorrelated infinite networks this threshold is given by T c~1 =(k{1) [6, 11] , where k~Sk 2 T=SkT is the branching factor of the network, and SkT and Sk 2 T are the first and the second moment, respectively, of the degree distribution P(k). Here, k is the degree or number of links that a node can have with k min \u0192k\u0192k max . For Erd\u00f6s-R\u00e9nyi networks (ER), the degree distribution is P(k)~e {SkT SkT k =k! and the threshold is found at T c~1 =SkT. However, most of the real networks have a heterogeneous degree distribution that is better represented by a pure Scale-Free network (SF) with P(k)*k {l , where l measures the broadness of the distribution. In the thermodynamic limit, for SF networks with 2vlv3, Sk 2 T?? and as a consequence, the critical transmissibility T c ?0 which means that the epidemic spreads for any value of T [6, 11] . However, due to finite size effects, real networks have finite critical transmisibilities.",

From an epidemiological point of view, this implies that if a disease spreads for a second time on the residual network, it cannot become an epidemic. On the other hand, Valdez et al: [13] showed that T \u00c3 is an important parameter to determine the efficiency of a mitigation or control strategy, because any strategy that decrease the transmissibility below T \u00c3 , can protect a large and connected cluster of susceptible individuals. Using a percolation framework, they explained the lost of the susceptible giant cluster as a not-random node percolation process, that they called node void percolation, in which a susceptible individual corresponds to a void node in link percolation.",

            "text": "Even though percolation theory was very useful to describe the steady state of the SIR model on complex networks, it is still very challenging to explain the dynamics of the model to develop intervention strategies before the epidemic spreads to a large fraction of the population. To describe the dynamics of epidemic spreading on networks, recently some researchers developed differential rate equations for the SIR model that take into account the network topology. Lindquist et al: [14] introduced an ''effective degree'' approach through a large system of ordinary differential equations. Under this approach, the nodes and their neighbors are categorized by their disease state (susceptible, infected, recovered) and each differential equation compute the evolution of the fraction of susceptible or infected nodes with a number i and s of infected and susceptible neighbors, respectively, with 0\u0192i\u0192k max and 0\u0192s\u0192k max . As a result, a system with O k 2 max \u00c0 \u00c1 equations needs to be solved. This approach represents accurately the evolution of the number of infected individuals, but at a high computational cost. On the other hand, Miller [15] and Miller et al: [16, 17] proposed an ingenious approach to describe the evolution of a SIR process with rates by means of an edgebased compartmental model (EBCM) [15, 16] which has the advantage to describe the dynamical spreading of an epidemic with only a few equations. With these equations, the authors found accurate results for the evolution of the number of infected individuals for static and dynamic evolutive topologies like ''edge swapping'' and ''dormant contacts'' for transmissibilities above the critical threshold [16] .",

In this paper we present a novel idea for the SIR model, based on a dynamical study of the network composed by susceptible individuals. We show that the temporal decreasing of the size of the giant susceptible cluster can be described as a dynamic void node percolation process with an instantaneous void control parameter. We find that there exists a critical time t c above which the giant susceptible component overcomes a temporal second order phase transition with mean field exponents. The paper is organized as following: in Methods and Results we present the theoretical framework to derive the evolution equations. Then we study the evolution of the giant susceptible cluster and its temporal critical behavior. Finally we present our conclusions.",

Here, P 1 (k) is the probability to reach a neighbor of a node, following a link. It is straightforward that the mean connectivity of the nodes is SkT~G 0 0 (1). Denoting the fraction of susceptible, infected and recovered individuals at time t by S(t), I(t) and R(t), respectively, the EBCM approach describes the evolution of the probability that a node (which we call root node) is susceptible. In order to compute this probability, an edge is randomly chosen and a direction is given, in which the node in the target of the arrow is the root, and the base is its neighbor. Disallowing that the root infects the neighbor, h(t):h t is the probability that the neighbor does not transmit the disease to the root, with h t given by",

Thus, the magnitudes derived for the static percolation of the susceptible individuals have a dynamical counterpart. As a result, V s and W S (t), are equivalent not only at the steady state, but also at every instant of time. In order to show the equivalence, in Fig. 1 we show in the same plot S 1 (t) as a function of W S (t), obtained from Eqs.

(12) and (13) , and the simulations which validate that percolation tools can be used to describe the time dependence of the susceptible individuals in the SIR process for TwT \u00c3 . On the other hand, in the figure we can see that for TwT \u00c3 , the giant susceptible cluster S 1 (t) is destroyed at t~t c which occurs exactly at W S (t c )~V s c (see the insets of Fig. 3 ). Our results show that W S (t) can be used to determine whether a giant susceptible cluster exists at a given time. In turn, in the insets of Fig. 3 we can see that the size of the second susceptible cluster S 2 (t) has a sharp peak around t c , indicating that, as in static percolation, the susceptible individuals overcome a second order phase transition. However, this transition is not given by a random node percolation process. As the disease spreads through the links, the susceptible individuals are removed with probability proportional to kP(k), i:e:, the susceptible network loses the higher degree nodes first. For this reason, the disease spreading induces a second order phase transition in the susceptible network with mean field exponents at t c (see discussion in the Supporting Information Sec.2).",

We show using an edge-based compartmental approach and percolation tools that as the disease spreads the evolution of the susceptible network can be explained as a temporal node void percolation that can be mapped instantaneously into static percolation. We show that for transmissibilities above T \u00c3 , there exist a critical time above which the giant susceptible cluster is destroyed and the susceptible network overcomes a second order transition with mean field exponents. All our theoretical results are in excellent agreement with the simulations. Our findings are very interesting from an epidemiological point of view since the existence of a threshold time implies that when a very virulent disease reaches a small number of susceptible individuals, the authorities have only a limited time to intervene, in order to protect a big community (susceptible giant component) that has not been already reached by the epidemic, and to preserve the topological features of SF networks. Our finding on the susceptible network could be extended to other epidemics dynamics allowing to obtain a better description of the effect of diseases spreading on social and technological networks.",

The value of W S (t c )~V s c (dashed line) was obtained from Eq. (16). S 2 (t) has been amplified by a factor of 50 in order to show it on the same scale as the rest of the curves.
