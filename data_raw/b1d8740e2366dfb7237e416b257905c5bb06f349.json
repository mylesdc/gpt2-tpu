            "text": "Human parainfluenza viruses (HPIV) types 1-4 are common respiratory pathogens that cause both upper and lower respiratory tract illnesses, especially in young children. 1 HPIV-1 and HPIV-2 are more common in children and more often associated with croup. 1 HPIV-3 is more frequently associated with bronchiolitis, bronchitis, and pneumonia. HPIV-4, while least well-characterized, has been described as associated with both mild illness in children and lower respiratory tract disease. 2 HPIV types have varying seasonality, prevalence, and clinical manifestations. In the United States, HPIV-1 usually occurs in the fall of odd numbered years, HPIV-2 occurs every fall, and HPIV-3 occurs in spring and summer. 1, 3 The seasonality of HPIV-4 has not been as well defined, often due to its low prevalence. 4 A recent study conducted in Colorado found a year-round prevalence of HPIV-4 with peaks in the fall of odd numbered years. 5 However, estimates of HPIV-4 prevalence are increasing, potentially due to improved and increased diagnostic testing, but few recent studies have assessed this. 6, 7 Widespread availability of multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays allows for more in-depth studies of the epidemiology and impact of HPIV types. The population of this study included both a community-based cohort and hospitalized children and adults with laboratory-detected HPIV. The inclusion of the community cohort allowed for a broader evaluation of the impact of HPIV than has been previously assessed. The study's objectives were to (a) assess the seasonality of HPIV types 1-4, (b) determine clinical outcomes by HPIV type, and (c) identify risk factors for increased severity of illness.",

The association of comorbid conditions and severe illness in those with HPIV is consistent with other respiratory viruses, most notably RSV and influenza, which both can exacerbate underlying cardiac and pulmonary conditions.

The severe category included patients who died within 30 days of HPIV detection, required ECMO or were mechanically ventilated. Moderate illness included those who were admitted to an ICU or required CPAP which can be provided on non-ICU floors as well as ICUs. Mild illness included all others.Putative risk factors for illness severity were examined among hospitalized patients. Bivariate analyses first considered the distribution of illness severity category by levels of possible risk factors. Variables with a significance of P < 0.10 in bivariable analysis were included in the multivariable ordinal logistic regression models which were used to regress the odds of illness severity.

HPIV-associated illnesses contributed to healthcare burden and cost as 32% of ARI episodes were medically attended, 9% received antibiotics, and 29% missed work or school. Few studies have examined HPIV in a communitybased cohort, but among infants in daycare, the clinical presentations and severity of illness were also similar with different HPIV types.18 Demographic and clinical characteristics, and outcomes did vary by HPIV type in hospitalized patients. Those with HPIV-3 had longer hospitalizations, were more likely to be \u226565 years old, and have \u22654 chronic conditions. They were also more likely to have chest x-rays performed, potentially reflective of their underlying conditions. In contrast, those with HPIV-4 all received antibiotics and were more likely to have an ICU admission with longer ICU stays. Those with HPIV-4 were most likely to have a primary respiratory diagnosis, supporting the pathogenicity of HPIV-4 as previously reported.19,20",
