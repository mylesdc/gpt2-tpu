In 2006, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Global Disease Detection [GDD] program began collaborating with China to enhance China's risk communication capacity to address gaps in the SARS communication response. This article describes tangible improvements in China's public health emergency risk communication capacity between the SARS and H7N9 outbreaks; documents U.S. CDC GDD cooperative technical assistance during 2006-2017; and shares lessons learnt to benefit other countries and contribute to enhance global health security. Method: A questionnaire based on the WHO Joint External Evaluation tool [Risk Communication section] was developed. A key communications official from the China National Health Commission [NHC] completed the questionnaire retrospectively to reflect China's capacity to manage communication response before, during and after the outbreaks of SARS in 2003, influenza H1N1 in 2009, and influenza H7N9 in 2013. A literature search was also conducted in English and Chinese to further substantiate the results of the questionnaire completed by NHC.",

China NHC improved its response through preparedness, availability of dedicated staff and resources for risk communication, internal clearance mechanisms, standard operating procedures with national response parties external to NHC, rumor management, communication with international agencies and consistent messaging with healthcare and private sectors. Correspondingly, the perceived level of trust that the public had in the NHC following outbreaks rose between the SARS and H7N9 response. Conclusion: Risk communication capacities in China have increased during the ten years between the SARS outbreak of 2003 and the H7N9 outbreak of 2013. Long-term risk communication capacity building efforts in bilateral collaborations are uncommon. The U.S. CDC GDD project was one of the first such collaborations worldwide. The lessons learned from this project may benefit lower and middle-income countries as they build their national emergency risk communication capacity.",

Approximately half of the risk communication response capacities during these public health emergencies were somewhat in place at the time of SARS, but again improved greatly between the SARS and H7N9 outbreaks (Additional file 2). At the time of SARS, NHC/ MOH lacked mechanisms to coordinate communication among national and international responders and stakeholders. This improved between the outbreak responses potentially due to the implementation of IHR in the interim. Other proactive capacities such as audience analyses, message testing, and frequent media updates proved to be lacking capacities during the SARS outbreak but were used as part of the communications response for the H7N9 outbreak and H1N1 before that.",

            "text": "Additionally, risk communication has to be coordinated among all response partners. Therefore, adoption of practices by just one agency wouldn't have much, if any, effect. As mentioned, whenever possible, training workshops and exercises included health response partners from a variety of agencies that should coordinate during emergencies. Sometimes this happened automatically, particularly in the latter years of the cooperation, but other times it required some guidance. For the work through U.S. CDC GDD we would often support workshops for a certain organization [China CDC or MOH]. In many of the cooperative agreement documents, we would stipulate that one organization had to reserve a certain number of seats for a partnering organization. We would also regularly meet with our counterparts at the WHO office in Beijing to ensure that we were targeting technical assistance areas in a complimentary fashion as opposed to duplicating efforts or not addressing gaps.",

Capacity building efforts changed as needs changed and, in many cases, decreased. A search of Chinese literature was conducted to illustrate what capacity building efforts changed policy and improved preparedness and response capabilities. In addition, key informants in the MOH provided additional insights on systematic advancements in the Chinese public health risk communication system during and following capacity building efforts. Capacity increased along the same path as technical assistance.Lessons learned from this bilateral technical assistance program can be adapted by other risk communication capacity programs. Ensuring that capacity is built with not only the \"voice\" of the public health system such as policy makers and leaders but also with responders such as FETP officers can best ensure institutional behavior change. Likewise, programs should train communicators on how to respond to emergencies at the field level where they're needed. Encourage partnerships and cooperation. The more agencies and organizations that adopt risk communication practice and collaborate and coordinate during the preparedness phase, the more seamless the next emergency response will be. Showing dedicated and influential counterparts a working risk communication system can help clarify and inspire policy action.Strengthening risk communication capacity is an important component of worldwide efforts to enhance global health security. IHR implementation, which is aimed at ensuring that all countries have the capacity to rapidly detect and contain public health threats at their source, requires that all countries have adequate and effective risk communication capacity. Lessons learned from the risk communication capacity building efforts in China were used to develop capacity assessment tools currently being used by IHR and may be helpful for other countries striving to implement IHR, and thereby can contribute to enhanced global health security.The U.S. CDC GDD efforts should not be credited for the success of China's improved ability to communicate both with its population and the global community during public health emergencies; that credit goes to the China CDC, the China Ministry of Health/National Health Commission, and the hardworking men and women serving in public health roles across the country.
