In the book, McLuhan described how the global media shaped current events surrounding the Vietnam War [1] and also predicted how modern information and communication technologies would accelerate world progress through trade and knowledge development. Globalization now refers to a broad range of issues regarding the movement of goods and services through trade liberalization, and the movement of people through migration.",

The agreement has been severely criticized by some, who claim that it increases privatization of health care services and undermines public health care systems. However, given its ambiguities, the actual impact of the agreement on the health sector will be largely determined by the way in which the agreement is further specifi ed in multinational commitments [14] . Social justice, equity, benefi cence, and nonmalefi cence will all come into play in the implementation of this treaty.",

It is very diffi cult to sequester new knowledge that might be applied to building biological weapons without simultaneously impeding research on defense against those bioweapons and on other benefi cial biomedical advances. Most BIG Project scientists agree that the benefi ts of releasing scientifi c information in general outweigh the risk of its misuse. However, the scientifi c community needs to consider whether new codes of conduct are necessary or whether existing governance is suffi cient to support a bioethical approach to research on possible dualuse technologies.",
