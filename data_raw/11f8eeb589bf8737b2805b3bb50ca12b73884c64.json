            "text": "Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is the essential infectious agent responsible for causing porcine circovirus-associated diseases in pigs. To date, eleven RNAs and five viral proteins of PCV2 have been detected. Here, we identified a novel viral gene within the PCV2 genome, termed ORF5, that exists at both the transcriptional and translational level during productive infection of PCV2 in porcine alveolar macrophages 3D4/2 (PAMs). Northern blot analysis was used to demonstrate that the ORF5 gene measures 180 bp in length and overlaps completely with ORF1 when read in the same direction. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to show that the ORF5 protein is not essential for PCV2 replication. To investigate the biological functions of the novel protein, we constructed a recombinant eukaryotic expression plasmid capable of expressing PCV2 ORF5. The results show that the GFP-tagged PCV2 ORF5 protein localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), is degraded via the proteasome, inhibits PAM growth and prolongs the S-phase of the cell cycle. Further studies show that the GFP-tagged PCV2 ORF5 protein induces ER stress and activates NF-\u03baB, which was further confirmed by a significant upregulation in IL-6, IL-8 and COX-2 expression. In addition, five cellular proteins (GPNMB, CYP1A1, YWHAB, ZNF511 and SRSF3) were found to interact with ORF5 via yeast two-hybrid assay. These findings provide novel information on the identification and functional analysis of the PCV2 ORF5 protein and are likely to be of benefit in elucidating the molecular mechanisms of PCV2 pathogenicity. However, additional experiments are needed to validate the expression and function of the ORF5 protein during PCV2 infection in vitro before any definitive conclusion can be drawn.",

            "text": "The PCV2 genome is a single-stranded, ambisense, closed circular DNA containing between 1,766 and 1,768 nucleotides [19] [20] . Although the nucleotide homology within individual isolates of either PCV1 or PCV2 is over 90%, the homology between PCV1 and PCV2 as serotypes is only 68% to 76% [19, 21] . This diversity may be responsible for the differences in pathogenicity or virulence observed for these serotypes. The virus was predicted to possess 11 overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) [19], of which four have been characterized in detail in replicating PCV2. On the viral strand, there is the ORF1 (nucleotides 51-995) gene, which encodes the Rep and Rep' proteins essential for PCV2 replication [22]. On the complementary strand, there are the ORF2 (nucleotides 1735-1034), ORF3 (nucleotides 671-357) and ORF4 (nucleotides 565-386) genes, which encode the capsid protein [23], apoptotic protein [21] and controversial anti-apoptotic protein, respectively [24-25]. Previous transcriptional analysis conducted during productive PCV2 infection of porcine kidney cells measured nine unique PCV2-specific RNA transcripts (designated-CR, Rep, Rep 0 , Rep3a, Rep3b, Rep3c, NS515, NS672, and NS0) [26]; however, only CR, Rep and Rep 0 transcripts were proven capable of translation into functional proteins [22, [26] [27] . In contrast, ORF3 and ORF4 transcripts, which are not included in the above nine RNAs, were subsequently confirmed to play important roles in the pathogenesis of PCV2; ORF3-deficient PCV2 is attenuated in its natural host [28] , and ORF4-deficient PCV2 induces a higher viral load and more severe microscopic lesions in the spleen during early stages of infection in mice [24] . Collectively, these research findings indicate that PCV2 pathogenesis is both complicated and multigenic and that the individual viral proteins encoded by ORF2, ORF3 or ORF4 are insufficient in determining pathogenicity. Previous computational analysis has revealed that the PCV2 genome contains at least seven ORFs with the potential to encode proteins > 5 kDa [29] ; to date, four have been identified. However, it has not yet been determined whether the three additional predicted proteins exist or whether there are still other viral proteins encoded by PCV2 that control its pathogenicity.",

However, several groups have aligned the genomic sequences of various PCV2 isolates and found a region of extremely high identity (over 95%) at the amino acid level, suggesting that PCV2 encodes a novel protein, although different names for this possible protein have been used in the literature (Gen Bank accession no. O92288, Q77GS3, Q77S04, etc). This new putative viral gene (designated ORF5 in this study), which is entirely different from that predicted by Hamel et al in 1998 [19], completely overlaps the ORF1 gene and is read in the same direction. The ORF5 gene is approximately 180 bp (spanning nucleotides 553-732) and encodes a polypeptide that is predicted to be of 6.5 kDa in molecular weight, whereas the corresponding region of PCV1 does not appear to produce a peptide.

Fig 4 depicts the transcription curve of each gene at the indicated time points following infection. The expression curve of ORF5 mRNA demonstrates that the site-directed mutation within ORF5 did not affect its transcription, as the PCV2\u0394 ORF5 transcript displayed a similar expression curve to wPCV2 or rPCV2 during this experiment (Fig 4) . These results suggest that the ORF5 gene may initiate transcription at a more upstream site. However, the expression levels of ORF1 and ORF2 transcripts in PCV2\u0394-infected cells were significantly lower than those measured in wPCV2-or rPCV2-infected cells from 12 hpi to 72 hpi (P < 0.05) (Fig 4) , suggesting that the lack of ORF5 reduced the transcriptional capacity of ORF1 and ORF2 during the first 72 hours after infection. These results indicate that the replication capacity of ORF5-deficient PCV2 might be smaller than previously thought. Additionally, the expression levels of ORF1 and ORF2 mRNAs were basically in accordance with each other and exactly conformed to the growth rhythm of the virus.

As expected, the negative control PAM cells did not produce any immunostaining signal. Thereafter, the proliferation of GFP-ORF5-expressing cells and control cells was measured by CCK8 assay. As shown in Fig 6, the GFP-ORF5-expressing cells divided much more slowly compared to control cells, resulting in a significantly decreased cell number after a time course of 96 h. In a recent study, PCV2 replication has been found to be both S-and G2/M-phase dependent [38] , indicating the possibility that the ORF5 protein might be involved in cell cycle progression. To validate this hypothesis, flow cytometric Functional Analysis of GFP-Fused Putative PCV2 ORF5 Protein analysis was utilized to analyze the cell cycle via PI staining. As shown in Fig 7, the proportion of GFP-ORF5-expressing cells found to be in S-phase was 51.07%, whereas the proportions of the phase for the control cells were 46.03% and 46.61%, respectively. The results of further quantitative analysis of these data are displayed in Fig 7 and suggest that the presence of the GFP-tagged PCV2 ORF5 protein could trigger a higher proportion of cells to enter S-phase versus control cells.

As shown in Fig 9, the GFP-ORF5 protein localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), whereas the GFP protein was predominantly located in the nucleus and to a lesser degree in the cytoplasm. Due to the ER localization of the GFP-ORF5 protein, the possibility that GFP-ORF5 induces ER stress must be assessed. To accomplish this, we first examined the expression level of glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78), which is a well-characterized ER chaperone protein and a marker of ER stress [46] . As shown in Fig 10, GRP78 expression was significantly up-regulated at both the transcriptional and translational levels in GFP-ORF5-expressing cells compared with controls, suggesting that the GFP-ORF5 protein has a likely role in ER stress activation.

Despite this, both the total number of viral proteins encoded by PCV2 and the potential functions of these novel proteins have not yet been determined. In this study, a novel transcript ORF5 RNA could be easily detected by RT-PCR in PCV2-infected PAMs and further detected by northern blot assay (Fig 1) . At 180 bp in length, this transcript was smaller than most confirmed viral RNAs but similar to the newly identified ORF4. Here, we demonstrated that ORF5 transcription was initiated during the process of PCV2 replication. Furthermore, to validate whether the ORF5 transcript can be translated into an actual protein by PCV2, we generated a specific mouse polyclonal antibody against the ORF5 protein. Immunofluorescence showed that the putative ORF5 protein of PCV2 was indeed expressed during PCV2 infection and was predominantly located in the cytoplasm of the infected cells (Fig 2) . It is unfortunate, however, that the ORF5 protein signal could not be detected via western blots in protein samples that were treated with loading buffer and boiled. Previous studies have reported that some viral proteins are only short-lived and sharply decay in cells, such as CSFV NS2 protein and HCV p7 protein [47] [48] . Thus, we infer that the polypeptide encoded by ORF5-RNA may be either expressed at low levels and transiently during PCV2 infection or that its antigenic epitopes were seriously destroyed during post-harvest processing. However, if possible, the natural existence of ORF5 protein during PCV2 infection needs to be further confirmed by independent experiments. Further investigation indicated that ORF5-deficient PCV2 replicates slowly in PAMs, whereas the maximal DNA copies and viral titers are comparable to wPCV2, a phenomenon similar to that of ORF3-deficient PCV2 [21] . Hence, certain features or potencies of the ORF3 protein may also be suitable for ORF5. Because it has been suggested that ORF3 could enhance the spread of PCV2, and that abrogation of ORF3 will attenuate its virulence [28] , it will also be meaningful to analyze the growth characteristic of PCV2\u0394 in its natural host. Such studies will be beneficial toward deepening our understanding of the role played by this protein and its potential role in creating a vaccine strain that could elicit an appropriate immune response against wild-type PCV2. Careful analysis of the transcriptional curves of each gene suggests that the lack of ORF5 protein expression blocks the transcription of ORF1 and ORF2, whereas ORF5 does not have any impact on the transcription of ORF3 and ORF4 (Fig 4) . Previous studies have demonstrated that ORF3 promotes apoptosis, whereas ORF4 interferes with the process. These data would imply that the ORF5 protein might not be implicated in PCV2-induced apoptosis. Additional investigations into the effect of the ORF5 protein on apoptosis via qRT-PCR and flow cytometric analysis also confirmed this claim (Fig 8) .",

            "text": "As the subcellular localization of a protein will usually reflect its function [45] , we examined the localization of ORF5 using confocal fluorescence microscopy. We demonstrated that the GFP-tagged PCV2 ORF5 protein localizes to the ER (Fig 9) and is able to induce ER stress via the upregulation of both the molecule chaperon GRP78 and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) (Fig 10) . NF-\u03baB is considered to be an important regulator of the expression of various genes during viral infection, particularly with regard to the secretion of the proinflammatory factors IL-6, IL-8, and COX-2 [18] . Thus, the activation of NF-\u03baB is considered to be a protective response [52] . Our findings show that overexpression of the GFP-tagged PCV2 ORF5 protein elevates NF-\u03baB activity by promoting I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation and p65 nuclear translocation and is consistent with previous results demonstrating that PCV2 infection activates the NF-\u03baB signalling pathway in PK-15 cells [53] . Collectively, these results imply that PCV2 ORF5 may enhance viral replication, survival, and even immune evasion. Furthermore, the upregulation of IL-6, IL-8 and COX-2 (Fig 11) following overexpression of GFP-ORF5 further confirmed this hypothesis. Thus, these results suggest that PCV2 ORF5 probably palys a critical role in assisting PCV2 infection by regulating the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway, leading to an enhanced inflammatory response.",

            "text": "As PCV2 is the smallest DNA virus known to infect mammals, its genome is very compact and has a highly limited coding capacity. Thus, PCV2 replication depends extensively on host cellular factors. Therefore, it is generally acknowledged that PCV2 must not only interact with the host cell to subvert cellular factors or processes to complete viral replication but also to modulate host immunity to cause cytokine imbalance, immunosuppression, and disease, utilizing its DNA sequences or encoded proteins. Therefore, the identification of cellular proteins that interact with PCV2 viral factors and the detailed description of such interactions are of paramount importance. In this study, five cellular proteins including type I transmembrane glycoprotein (GPNMB), cytochrome P450 enzyme (CYP1A1), adapter protein (YWHAB), transcriptional regulator (ZNF511) and RNA splicing factor (SRSF3), were identified to interact with the PCV2 ORF5 protein (summarized in Table 2 ), although the domains responsible for these interactions and their biological significance remain largely unknown. Undoubtedly, further studies will be necessary to elucidate the exact molecular mechanisms governing virushost interplay and will be very useful toward gaining further understanding of the dependency of viral growth on host cell factors, as well as the pathogenic mechanism of PCV2 infection.",

Moreover, the relative expression level of ORF5 was more abundant than ORF1 (Fig 4) , which is consistent with previous northern blot analysis that demonstrates that PCV2 NS0 is more abundant than PCV2 Rep [54] . To date, it is not clear whether the minor NS0 RNA encodes a protein or what function such a protein may possess during the life cycle of PCV2. Previous work has suggested that PCV2 NS0 is more abundant than PCV1 NS0 and that the differential splicing and relative expression levels of NS0 RNAs may contribute to the pathogenesis of PCV2 [54] . However, contradictory evidence has also shown that introducing a stop codon into NS0 RNA did not have any effect on viral protein synthesis or DNA replication [22] . In consideration of all of the above, we conclude that the alleged NS0 may be merely a fraction of ORF5 and is therefore incapable of playing as extensive of a role as the intact ORF5.",
