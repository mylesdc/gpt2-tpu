The membrane topology of SARS-CoV M and the functional significance of its N-glycosylation are not completely understood as is its interaction with the surface glycoprotein S. Using biochemical and immunofluorescence analyses we found that M consists of a short glycosylated N-terminal ectodomain, three transmembrane segments and a long, immunogenic C-terminal endodomain. Although the N-glycosylation site of M seems to be highly conserved between group 1 and 3 coronaviruses, studies using a recombinant SARS-CoV expressing a glycosylation-deficient M revealed that N-glycosylation of M neither influence the shape of the virions nor their infectivity in cell culture. Further functional analysis of truncated M proteins showed that the N-terminal 134 amino acids comprising the three transmembrane domains are sufficient to mediate accumulation of M in the Golgi complex and to enforce recruitment of the viral spike protein S to the sites of virus assembly and budding in the ERGIC.",

In March 2003 the world health organization issued a global alert about a severe partially fatal respiratory disease named severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). SARS originated in Southeast China, affected thousands and spread to many countries worldwide via international travel. Drastic quarantine measures and tight travel restrictions finally contained the SARS outbreak [4, 5] . In parallel, the etiologic agent of the outbreak was identified with unprecedented speed and turned out to be a novel coronavirus with several distinguishing features to known coronaviruses [6] [7] [8] . The SARS outbreak showed drastically that coronaviruses can develop into highly pathogenic agents with the potential to threaten public health and global economy severely [9, 10] .",

Expression of M N4Q Insert which contains only the novel glycosylation site between the potential transmembrane segments 2 and 3 resulted in two M-specific bands (Fig.  1C , lanes 2 and 6). Endo H digestion revealed that the upper band was glycosylated suggesting that the two forms correspond to non-and monoglycosylated M N4Q Insert . (Fig. 1C, lane 7) . These results demonstrate that the linker-domain between the putative second and third hydrophobic domains faces the luminal site and the two hydrophobic stretches are probably incorporated in the lipid-layer. Therefore we hypothesize a membrane topology of M as depicted in the right graphic in Fig. 1C .",

To confirm these in silico data the N-terminal N-glycosylation site of the homologue protein of another human pathogenic coronavirus, HCoV-NL63, was mutated which led to the loss of glycosylation completely as it is the case for SARS-CoV M (data not shown) [17] . These results induced the idea that N-glycosylation might be important for protein transport, protein-protein-interactions or other steps in the viral life cycle. Therefore, the intracellular distribution of the glycosylation-deficient mutant M N4Q of SARS-CoV was investigated by immunofluorescence analysis (Fig. 2B ). The staining of the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and the recombinantly expressed M N4Q revealed a strong colocalization suggesting that the M N4Q as well as wild type M accumulates in the budding compartment ERGIC and that N-glycosylation has no influence on intracellular transport of M (Fig. 2B , right image) [17] .",

Expression of viral proteins was confirmed by western blot analysis using serum of a SARS-convalescent or the human monoclonal \u03b1-M antibody S30 [17] . The serum recognized the structural components spike-(S) and nucleocapsid-(N) protein in cell lysates of wt and mutant recSARS-CoV infected Vero-cells.

However, in cells infected with M N4Q recSARS-CoV only the unglycosylated form of M was detected. These results provide evidence that we successfully rescued a replication-competent recSARS-CoV expressing a glycosylation-deficient M. To illustrate the morphology of wt as well as mutant recSARS-CoV, we performed electronmicroscopy analysis of purified virions demonstrating that both virions share a characteristic corona-solis like appearance (Fig. 3B , upper panel).

At 24 h p.t., cells were fixed, permeabilized and viral proteins were stained with a rabbit polyclonal \u03b1-S serum and a rhodamine-coupled \u03b1-rabbit secondary antibody. SARS-CoV (strain Frankfurt) infected Vero cells were fixed, permeabilized and incubated with the same antibodies as described above. B, Huh7 cells coexpressing M C or the truncated form M 1-134 together with S were fixed, permeabilized and incubated with a rabbit \u03b1-S serum and a mouse monoclonal \u03b1-FLAG antibody followed by a FITC-coupled \u03b1-mouse and a rhodamine-coupled \u03b1-rabbit secondary antibody. The merged images are shown on the right hand side and respective, coexpressed proteins are given on the left hand side of the panels. place. Replacing M by the mutant containing only the hydrophobic N-terminal part of the protein, M 1-134 , we observed that S is still found in the perinuclear region and plasma membrane transport is prevented (Fig. 6B, lower  row) . In summary this experiment showed that coexpression with at least the first 134 amino acids of M induced a redistribution of the surface protein S to the perinuclear region which is consistent with the idea that M recruited S to site of assembly and budding of SARS-CoV.",

Hence, incorporation of S into the viral envelope is essential for infectivity of released progeny virions [41] [42] [43] . A retention signal located at the cytosolic C-terminus of most coronaviral S proteins prevents surface expression of S [44, 45] . However, we and others could observe that upon single expression, S of SARS-CoV is detectable at the plasma membrane Figure 7 Membrane topology model of SARS-CoV M protein. [36, 45, 46] . Thus, the question arose whether interaction with other viral proteins supported retention of S. Previous studies on MHV showed an interaction between M and S and emphasized the impact of this interaction on viral morphogenesis [12, 42, 43, 47] . Here, we observed that M suppressed the surface transport of S and may thus functionally support the ER retrieval signal identified by McBride and Machamer [46] .

Further in vivo studies using the generated N-glycosylation-deficient SARS-CoV are necessary to elucidate the role of conserved N-glycosylation during immune response of the infected host. Finally, our data revealed that the N-terminal part of M induces the retrieval of S to the ERGIC.",

Intracellular staining was achieved by subsequent fixation with 4% PFA/DMEM for 15 min at room temperature, permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min and additional incubation for 1 h with a polyclonal \u03b1-FLAG and a FITC-coupled secondary \u03b1-rabbit antibody (Dianova) at room temperature.

Eickmann, Marburg) using FuGENE (Roche) according to the manufactor's protocol. In addition, a plasmid was cotransfected encoding the T7 DNA-dependent RNA-polymerase supporting the expression of the M mutants. At 24 h p.t., the cells were fixed with 4% PFA/DMEM for 15 min and permeabilized for 10 min with 0.1% Triton X-100.

Briefly, the viral genome of SARS-CoV (Frankfurt 1 isolate) was subdivided into seven fragments by RT-PCR and subsequently cloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) or pSMART vectors (Lucigen) using appropriate restriction enzymes. In order to achieve a full length SARS-CoV cDNA clone the present constructs were subjected to further restriction/ligation steps into pBelo vectors finally assembling a pBelo-SARS clone under the control of the T7 promoter. The full-length BAC-constructs were linearized, in vitro transcribed and electroporated in BHK-21 cells using GenePulser (Biorad). Harvest and purification of infectious virus was done under BSL4conditions. According to this approach, we constructed a cDNA-subclone with a substitution in the N-glycosylation site of M by site-directed mutagenesis (Quick change, Stratagene) using wild type pSMART-F as template. Subsequent cloning steps and the rescue of a recombinant SARS-CoV expressing glycosylation-deficient M was performed as described above for wild type recombinant SARS-CoV.",

Surface-staining (red fluorescence) and subsequent intracellular staining (green fluorescence) of M was performed 24 h posttransfection (p.t.) using a polyclonal \u03b1-FLAG and a fluorescence-labelled secondary antibody. C, M and the glycosylation mutants M Insert and M N4Q Insert were in vitro translated in the presence of canine microsomal membranes and metabolically labelled with [ 35 S] PROMIX (Promega).

To further analyze the growth kinetics of both viruses, cell cultures were infected and the viral replication efficiency was assessed by calculating the number of viral genomes in the supernatant by real-time RT-PCR(Fig. 3C). In FRHK4 cells (fetal rhesus monkey kidney), wt recSARS-CoV (blue bars) as well as M N4Q rec-SARS-CoV (red bars) exhibited a considerable 10 6 -fold increase in viral genomes copies within 18 h p.i. andreached a plateau of approximately 10 7 viral genomes late in infection (40 h p.i.; Fig. 3C, left panel). These results were independent of the used cells since infection of Vero cells with both viruses resulted in similar amounts of viral particles late in infection (40 h p.i.; Fig. 3C, right panel). However, infection with M N4Q recSARS-CoV resulted in a 10-fold reduction of released genome copies early in infection compared to wt rec SARS-CoV. In general, both recombinant viruses possessed a delayed viral replication in infected Vero cells compared to FRHK4 cells. In summary, we could provide evidence that a suppressed N-glycosylation of SARS-CoV M do not have a significant impact on protein transport and on assembly and replication of new virions in cell culture.

Cell lysates were harvested and subjected to Western blot analysis. Virus inactivation was achieved by treatment with 1% SDS and boiling of the samples. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto PVDF membranes.To detect viral structural proteins the membrane was incubated with a serum of an immunized rabbit or with the human monoclonal antibody S30.
