Of various CyDs, AFliposomes associated with plasmid DNA (pDNA) and \u03b3-cyclodextrin (\u03b3-CyD) (pDNA/\u03b3-CyD/AF-liposomes) showed the highest gene transfer activity in HepG2 cells without any significant cytotoxicity. In addition, \u03b3-CyD enhanced the encapsulation ratio of pDNA with AF-liposomes, and also increased gene transfer activity as the entrapment ratio of pDNA into AF-liposomes was increased. \u03b3-CyD stabilized the liposomal membrane of AF-liposomes and inhibited the release of calcein from AF-liposomes. The stabilizing effect of \u03b3-CyD may be, at least in part, involved in the enhancing gene transfer activity of pDNA/\u03b3-CyD/AF-liposomes. Therefore, these results suggest the potential use of \u03b3-CyD for an enhancer of transfection efficiency of AF-liposomes.",

CyDs are 2 Journal of Drug Delivery cyclic (\u03b1-1,4)-linked oligosaccharides of \u03b1-D-glucopyranose containing a hydrophobic central cavity and hydrophilic outer surface, and they are known to be able to act as novel host molecules by chemical modification [17] . Davis and his colleagues reported that the ternary complex of a water-soluble \u03b2-CyD polymer with 6 A ,6 D -dideoxy-6 A ,-6 D -di-(2-aminoethanethio)-\u03b2-CyD and dimethylsuberimidate (\u03b2CDP6), galactosylated, or transferrin polyethylene glycol conjugates with adamantane, and pDNA possesses higher transfection efficiency in hepatoma or leukemia cells, respectively, through receptor-mediated endocytosis [18, 19] . Recently, we reported the potential use of PAMAM dendrimer functionalized with \u03b1-CyD (\u03b1-CDE) [20] and lactosylated \u03b1-CDE (Lac-\u03b1-CDE) as a hepatocyte specific gene delivery in vitro and in vivo [21] . Meanwhile, Lawrencia et al. reported that lipoplex transfection of pDNA with DOTAP (N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium methyl-sulfate) in the presence of cholesterol, which is solubilized by methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (methyl-\u03b2-CyD), has significantly improved transfection efficiency in urothelial cells due to change in membrane fluidity by methyl-\u03b2-CyD [22] . In addition, we previously demonstrated that intravenous injection of the pegylated liposomes entrapping the doxorubicin (DOX) complex with \u03b3-CyD in BALB/c mice bearing Colon-26 tumor cells showed DOX accumulation in tumor tissues and the potent antitumor effect, compared with those of DOX solution and pegylated liposomes entrapping DOX alone [23] . These lines of evidence suggest that transfection efficiency and pharmacokinetics of pDNA can be altered by the association of CyDs with AF-liposomes.",

The fractions number 26-30, which eluted both phospholipids and AF, were collected as the AF-liposomes fraction (Figure 1(b) ). The \u03b6-potential value and particle size of AF-liposomes were 31.2 \u00b1 0.1 mV and 230.7 \u00b1 4.2 nm, respectively. The amount of AF modification in 1 \u03bcmol of AF-liposome lipids was 35.8 \u03bcg/\u03bcmol lipids, indicating that AF modification rate against DPPE in liposomes was 0.75%.

After freezingthawing for three times, the vesicles were extruded through PVDF membranes (Nucleopore, Plesanton, CA) with pores of diameter 450 and 200 nm. The filtrates were used for further experiments as pDNA/CyDs/AF-liposomes or pDNA/CyDs/N-liposomes. The entrapment ratios of CyDs were evaluated by the anthrone-sulfuric acid method [26] . Briefly, 3 mL of anthrone reagent was added to 0.5 mL of the suspension containing CyDs/liposomes. The tube was covered with a glass ball and was heated for 10 min in boiling water. After quenching with cold water, absorbance of the suspension was measured by a U-2000A spectrophotometer (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) at 620 nm.

In cationic liposome-mediated gene transfection, lipid composition and lipid type are the most important physicochemical factors, because they affect not only the interaction with pDNA but also the affinity to target cells [36, 37] . In the present study, we prepared AF-liposomes with a lipid composition of TMAG/DOPE/DLPC/DPPE (2/4/3/1, molar ratio). DOPE is known to enhance the endosomal escape of pDNA due to its structural change into hexagonal II form at pH 5-6, an endosomal pH range, resulting in destabilizing endosomal membranes [38, 39] . TMAG, a cationic lipid, makes it possible to interact with pDNA in AF-liposomes. Additionally, DPPE was used as a binding lipid with AF. Actually, cationic liposomes composed of TMAG/DOPE/DLPC (1/2/2, molar ratio) are commercially available transfection reagents as GeneTransfer, which have already been utilized in a clinical trial for a nonviral vector to deliver the interferon-\u03b2 gene for the treatment of brain tumor in Japan [40] .

In fact, the CLSM study demonstrated that cellular uptake of pDNA/\u03b3-CyD/AF-liposomes was higher than that of pDNA/\u03b3-CyD/AF-liposomes ( Figure 11 ). Furthermore, we confirmed that transfection efficiency of pDNA/\u03b3-CyD/AF-liposomes was increased, as the encapsulation ratio of pDNA into pDNA/\u03b3-CyD/AF-liposomes was augmented (Table 4 ). In view of the findings, the particle size of pDNA/\u03b3-CyD/AF-liposomes and encapsulation ratio of pDNA into pDNA/\u03b3-CyD/AF-liposomes are crucial role for enhancing transfection efficiency of pDNA/AF-liposomes.",

            "text": "The important question regarding the enhancing effect of \u03b3-CyD on transfection efficiency of pDNA/AF-liposomes still remains, because three types of HP-CyDs did not have the enhancing effect. To address this question, the DSC analysis was performed. This study indicated that \u03b3-CyD, but not HP-\u03b3-CyD, changed membrane fluidity and stabilized the N-liposomal membranes (Figure 9 ). In fact, \u03b3-CyD increased the Tc value of DLPC-liposomes, although HP\u03b3-CyD did not increase anymore ( Figure 10 ). This increase in the Tc value induced by \u03b3-CyD could be attributed to a compactness of lipid bilayer of DLPC liposomes. It is thereby possible that \u03b3-CyD may increase Tc values of the other liposomes such as DMPC, DPPC, and DSPC. Here, it is well known that \u03b3-CyD is highly hydrophilic and surface inactive [17] . Therefore, we presumed that \u03b3-CyD encapsulates the aqueous compartment of liposomes rather than in the bilayer of liposomes. Anyhow, it is clear that the magnification of the interaction of liposomal membranes containing DLPC with HP-\u03b3-CyD is weaker than that with \u03b3-CyD, possibly due to the steric hindrance of the HP group in a HP-\u03b3-CyD molecule. Taken together, it is likely that the stabilizing effects of \u03b3-CyD on AF-liposomal membrane may lead to inhibition of pDNA leakage from AF-liposomes and increase in cellular uptake of pDNA, eventually leading to the enhancement of in vitro transfection efficiency of pDNA/\u03b3-CyD/AF-liposomes in cells.",

Consequently, the potential use of \u03b3-CyD could be expected as an enhancer of gene transfer activity of AFliposomes.
