At the district level, three districts were sampled from the total seven central urban districts of Shanghai by PPS (Huangpu, Xuhui, and Changning). At the subdistrict level, ten subdistricts within those three central urban districts were sampled by PPS, where the number of subdistricts needed per district was determined by proportionate stratification (four from Xuhui, three from Huangpu, and three from Changning). At the household level, 25 households per neighborhood were selected with the help of neighborhood committee cadres.

Models were based on age-weighted methods. The sampling weights werecalculated based on the age distribution of Shanghai (central urban districts) census in 2017. The distribution of household sizes was not considered because we could not obtain the census statistics of household size stratified by age. Text S5: Human-human contact matrix We defined the original matrix C=(Cij) where Cij was the number of encounters between participants of age group i and contacts of estimated age j. The total number of participants in each age class was Ni. The original contact matrix was normalized by these to give the mean contact matrix M=(Mij) where Mij= Cij / Ni.
