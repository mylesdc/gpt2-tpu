            "text": "The genus Coronavirus contains about 25 species of coronaviruses (CoVs), which are important pathogens causing highly prevalent diseases and often severe or fatal in humans and animals. No licensed specific drugs are available to prevent their infection. Different host receptors for cellular entry, poorly conserved structural proteins (antigens), and the high mutation and recombination rates of CoVs pose a significant problem in the development of wide-spectrum anti-CoV drugs and vaccines. CoV main proteases (M pro s), which are key enzymes in viral gene expression and replication, were revealed to share a highly conservative substrate-recognition pocket by comparison of four crystal structures and a homology model representing all three genetic clusters of the genus Coronavirus. This conclusion was further supported by enzyme activity assays. Mechanism-based irreversible inhibitors were designed, based on this conserved structural region, and a uniform inhibition mechanism was elucidated from the structures of M pro -inhibitor complexes from severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV and porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus. A structureassisted optimization program has yielded compounds with fast in vitro inactivation of multiple CoV M pro s, potent antiviral activity, and extremely low cellular toxicity in cell-based assays. Further modification could rapidly lead to the discovery of a single agent with clinical potential against existing and possible future emerging CoV-related diseases.",

Coronaviruses (CoVs) infect humans and multiple species of animals, causing a variety of highly prevalent and severe diseases [1, 5] . For example, human coronavirus (HCoV) strains 229E (HCoV-229E), NL63 (HCoV-NL63), OC43 (HCoV-OC43), and HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1) cause a significant portion of upper and lower respiratory tract infections in humans, including common colds, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia. They have also been implicated in otitis media, exacerbations of asthma, diarrhea, myocarditis, and neurological disease [2, 3, [6] [7] [8] [9] . A previously unknown HCoV, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which is most closely related to the group II CoVs [10] , proved to be the etiological agent of a global outbreak of a life-threatening form of pneumonia called severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which, in 2003, was the cause of more than 800 fatalities worldwide [11] [12] [13] [14] . Animal CoVs are mainly associated with enteric and respiratory diseases in livestock and domestic animals. Most of the viruses are highly contagious with significant mortality in young animals, resulting in considerable economic losses worldwide [5, 9] .",

During the SARS epidemic in China, the emergence of SARS-CoV suggested an animal-human interspecies transmission [22, 23] . The virus continued evolving to adapt to the human host during the course of the outbreak [22] with about onethird the mutation rate of human immunodeficiency virus [24] . The high degree of similarity between genome sequences of bovine CoV and the recently sequenced HCoV-OC43 suggested an earlier animal-to-human interspecies transmission than SARS-CoV [25] . Moreover, a high frequency of RNA recombination is a common feature of CoV genetics and has been demonstrated for representative viruses from all CoV groups, including murine hepatitis virus (MHV), TGEV, and IBV [9, 26] . For instance, the outbreaks caused by variant strains of IBV that arose from recombination of vaccine and wild-type virulent strains in chicken flocks limit the usage of vaccines against IBV [27, 28] . Consequently, it is of concern whether current vaccines or drugs in development will be effective against the next wave of attacks by altered SARS-CoV [22] .",

However, some of the key factors controlling the host spectrum and viral pathogenicity are highly variable among CoVs. For instance, CoVs use different host receptors for cellular entry, have poorly conserved structural proteins (antigens), and encode diverse accessory genes in their 3'-terminal genome regions that probably contribute to the pathogenicity of CoVs in specific hosts [1] [2] [3] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] . Clearly, this structural and functional diversity presents a significant obstacle for designing a versatile compound against all CoVs unless a highly conserved target that is comparatively stable during evolution is identified within the genus Coronavirus. Here we report the discovery of a highly conserved region based on four crystal structures and one homology model of M pro representing all three genetic clusters of the genus Coronavirus, and a uniform inhibition mechanism revealed from the structures of M proinhibitor complexes from SARS-CoV and TGEV. A structureassisted optimization program has yielded compounds with fast in vitro inactivation of multiple CoV M pro s, potent antiviral activity, and extremely low cellular toxicity in cellbased assays. Further modification could rapidly lead to the discovery of a single agent with clinical potential against existing and possible future emerging CoV-associated diseases.",

However, pairwise BLAST of the primary sequences among CoV M pro s showed identities of only 38% in some cases. Since it is acknowledged that three-dimensional structures are more closely conserved than primary sequences, we decided to investigate the conservation among the CoV M pro structures. As the M pro s showed comparatively high sequence similarity within each CoV group, representatives from every group were chosen for comparison. The structures of M pro s from TGEV (group I), HCoV-229E (group I), and SARS-CoV are available [36] [37] [38] . Although the crystal structure of IBV (group III) M pro is currently under refinement by our group, it can nevertheless be used as an experiment-based model. As the structure of MHV M pro (group II) was unavailable, and previous studies have shown that SARS-CoV is related to group II [10] , we constructed a homology model for MHV M pro based on the structure of SARS-CoV M pro . Superposition of the crystal structures and homology model showed approximately 2 \u00c5 root mean square deviation for all 300 C a , but the most variable regions were the helical domain III and surface loops. The substrate-binding pockets located in a cleft between domains I and II, and especially the S4, S2, and S1 are highly conserved among CoV M pro s suggesting the possibility for wide-spectrum inhibitor design targeting this region in the M pro s of all CoVs. This hypothesis was further supported by enzyme activity assays (see Table 1 ). Based on the assumption that the substrate-binding sites are highly conserved among CoV M pro s, a fluorescence-labeled substrate MCA-AVLQflSGFR-Lys(Dnp)-Lys-NH2 was synthesized to determine the kinetic parameters of TGEV, HCoV-229E, FIPV, MHV, IBV, and SARS-CoV M pro s. The substrate sequence was derived from residues P4-P59 of the SARS-CoV M pro N-terminal autoprocessing site, which has the sequence AVLQSGFRK. IBV M pro demonstrated an almost identical K m to that of SARS-CoV M pro . An interesting observation was that four other CoV proteases showed marginally stronger binding affinity to the substrate than SARS-CoV M pro itself. These results further support the preliminary biochemical studies on conservation of substrates of CoV M pro s [39] .",

The sequence of this substrate-analog was derived from residues P6-P1 of the N-terminal autoprocessing site of TGEV M pro [36, 38] . However, the two protomers of SARS-CoV M pro each exhibited an unexpected binding mode, possibly resulting from the comparatively weak binding of peptidyl elements derived from the substrate of TGEV M pro and from the highly reactive electrophile CMK. This would suggest that nucleophilic attack might have occurred before a stable noncovalently bound enzyme-inhibitor complex was formed. Accordingly, the single binding mode in the TGEV M pro complex was taken into account when designing possible broad-spectrum inhibitors on the basis of these structures and models. Although the CMK inhibitor is nonselective because of its high chemical reactivity and is susceptible to cleavage by gastric and enteric proteinases, it could provide structural insight into the substrate-binding pocket. Superposition of the structures and model revealed that all these proteases have a His-Cys catalytic dyad with relatively conserved orientations, in which His acts as a proton acceptor and Cys undergoes nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon of the substrate. It is widely accepted that increased inhibitor potency can be achieved provided that a covalent bond is formed between the active Cys residue and the designed compound, resembling the intermediate during substrate cleavage. The Michael acceptors, a class of conjugated carbonyl compounds, were successfully introduced to devise irreversible Cys protease inhibitors, including the antirhinovirus compound ruprintrivir (formerly designated AG7088) [40] [41] [42] , and so the highly reactive electrophile CMK was replaced by a less reactive trans-a, b-unsaturated ethyl ester, which was expected to readily extend into the bulky S19 subsite of CoV M pro s.",

Since backbones of CoV M pro s constituting this area superimposed particularly well, except for a small segment located on the outer wall of S2, we concentrated on the variation of side chains forming these pockets. In the TGEV M pro complex structure [36] , the side chains of 165-Glu, 162-His, 171-His, and 139-Phe (also conserved in other M pro s) are incorporated with other backbone elements to constitute the S1 site, which has an absolute requirement for Gln at the P1 position via two hydrogen bonds. Modeling showed that a lactam with (S) stereochemistry at the a-carbon might preserve the hydrogen bonds essential for S1 recognition; moreover, a comparatively bulky lactam ring would create additional van der Waals interactions. The side chains of 164-Leu, 51-Ile, 41-His, and 53-Tyr, as well as the alkyl portion of side chains of 186-Asp and 47-Thr, are involved in forming a deep hydrophobic S2 subsite that can accommodate the relatively large side chain of Leu in TGEV M pro . This feature can also be observed in the HCoV-229E M pro . Several conservative substitutions occur in other CoV M pro s (164-Leu ! 165-Met in SARS-CoV and MHV M pro s; 53-Tyr ! 50-Trp in IBV M pro ). Another minor difference was observed in SARS-CoV and MHV M pro s, where the outer wall segment is composed of a short 3 10 -helix from residues 45-50, compared with a less regular structure in HCoV and TGEV M pro . With respect to the structure of IBV M pro undergoing refinement, no clear electron density was observed in the corresponding stretch of residues 44-47. We reasoned that variations in the segment located on the outer wall of S2 should not significantly affect the hydrophobicity of this deep subsite. This is supported by evidence wherein Leu is found at position P2 of substrates for all CoV M pro s. As P2 Phe is present in the C-terminal autocleavage site of SARS-CoV, phenyl was used as a smaller substituent to explore this subsite. The side chain of Thr at P3 is solvent-exposed, so this site was expected to tolerate a wide range of functionality. The side chains of 164-Leu, 166-Leu, 184-Tyr, and 191-Gln that form the S4 hydrophobic subsite of TGEV are conserved in other CoV M pro s, excluding the following conservative substitutions: 184-Tyr ! 184-Phe in HCoV M pro ; 164-Leu ! 165-Met, 184-Tyr ! 185-Phe in SARS-CoV. A tertiary butyloxycarbonyl was introduced at the P4 position as an N-terminal protecting group to enter into the S4 site. Thus, by combining the modifications above, a novel compound designated as I2 (see Figure 1A ) was designed and a series of analogs was synthesized for the inhibition assay (see Protocol S1).",

We were able to solve a 2.7-\u00c5 resolution crystal structure of SARS-CoV M pro complexed with I2 (see Figure 1B ; Table S1 ) despite the weak noncovalent binding, in order to enhance the inhibitory effect of these compounds. Briefly, compound I2 binds to the shallow cleft formed by a portion of the strand eII and a segment of the loop linking domains II and III. The C b atom of the Michael acceptor forms a covalent bond with Sc of 145-Cys as expected. The lactam P1 inserts favorably into S1 and the side chain of Val at P3 is solvent-exposed. However, the failure of P2 and P4 to be properly accommodated by their corresponding subsites attracted our attention, and might account for the poor inhibitory effect of this series of molecules. First, although phenyl at P2 could enter the S2 site, its rigidity prevents it from reorienting to insert further into this site. Second, the Nterminal protecting group tertiary butyloxycarbonyl did not insert into the S4 subsite, possibly as a result of the planar property of the butyloxyamide group.

For the P2 subsite, the phenyl group was substituted by a more flexible Leu side chain. In order to enhance the binding affinity, a series of residues were utilized as substituents at P4, followed by a heterocycle that should increase the Van der Waals contacts with residues flanking at either side. From this round of modification, two inhibitors designated as N1 and N9, and a more efficacious derivative named N3, were identified with fast in vitro inactivation of all CoV M pro s tested, including those of TGEV, HCoV-229E, FIPV, HCoV-NL63 (representatives from group I); MHV, HCoV-HKU1 (representatives from group II); SARS-CoV (related to group II); and IBV (representative from group III) in preliminary inhibition assays (see Figure S2 ). These inhibitors are not sensitive under 1 mM concentration of dithiothreitol (DTT), which is consistent with a previous report of this type of compound [42] . Subsequently, strict inhibition kinetic parameters were determined and are listed in Table 1 (determination of kinetic parameters of M pro s of HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 is underway). These inhibitors showed more powerful inhibition of FIPV M pro than other proteases with high inactivation rates (k obs /[I] ! 23,000 M \u00c01 s \u00c01 ), such that measurement of K i and k 3 proved difficult. In this case, k obs /[I] was utilized to evaluate their inhibition as an approximation of the pseudo second-order rate constant (k 3 /K i ) if very rapid inactivation occurs. The K i of N1 ranges from approximately 1.11-10.7 lM and k 3 ranges from approximately 4.1-50 3 10 \u00c03 s \u00c01 ; the K i of N9 ranges from approximately 0.9-6.7 lM, and k 3 ranges from approximately 2.6-19.5 3 10 \u00c03 s \u00c01 . Compared with N1 and N9, N3 demonstrated more potent inhibition on TGEV, FIPV, MHV, and IBV M pro s with k obs /[I] ranging from approximately 4,700-47,000 M \u00c01 s \u00c01 . We therefore solved the crystal structure of SARS-CoV and TGEV M pro s individually complexed with N1, which revealed a common mechanism of inhibition among CoV M pro s.",

As a result, discussion will be focused entirely on protomer A (see Figures 1C, 1D, 2A,  and 2B ). From the omit map (contoured at 1.2 r), clear electron density showed that N1 binds in an extended conformation with the inhibitor backbone atoms forming an antiparallel sheet with residues 164-168 of the long strand eII on one side, and with residues 189-191 of the loop linking domains II and III.

Comparison between the molecular surfaces of SARS-CoV M pro complexed with N1 and the native enzyme show that certain residues constituting the S1 and S2 subsites undergo large conformational changes on inhibitor binding (see Figure 2A and 2B). The side chain of 142-Asn flips over with a 6-\u00c5 shift to superpose onto the lactam like a lid when P1 inserts into the subsite. This might account for the movement of main chains of residues 141-143 toward the S1 site; 142-Asn, together with the main chains of neighboring residues, covers the P1 site like one half of a gate. On the opposite side, 49-Met protrudes by around 5\u00c5 from the hydrophobic S2 site and is situated parallel to the side chain of Leu at P2. The side chain of another residue, 189-Gln, moves upward to form a 3.0-\u00c5 hydrogen bond with the backbone NH of P2. These two residues constitute the other half of a gate. Together, these two halves should serve as a gate-regulated switch with an essential role in substrate or inhibitor recognition and binding.",

Clear electron density showed that the S c atom of 145-Cys forms a standard 1.8-\u00c5 C-S covalent bond with the C b of vinyl group, which suggests a Michael addition reaction. The S c atom moved slightly (approximately 0.6 \u00c5 ) toward the interior of the protein compared with the native enzyme. The Michael acceptor remains in a plane following the Michael addition since it is stabilized by a water molecule. This ordered water molecule donates a long 3.3-\u00c5 hydrogen bond to the carboxylate oxygen of the ester and then accepts a 2.8-\u00c5 hydrogen bond from the backbone NH of 143-Gly and a 3.0-\u00c5 hydrogen bond from the carboxamide nitrogen of 142-Asn. The position of S c in 145-Cys implies that it undergoes nucleophilic attack on C b by approaching the p-electron cloud from above. The carbonyl oxygen occupies the oxyanion hole and is close to backbone NHs of 143-Cys and 145-Cys, mimicking the tetrahedral oxyanion intermediate formed during Ser protease cleavage. However, the standard hydrogen bonds are not formed. The ethyl ester portion extends into the S19 site, with sufficient size, and in an extended conformation, to interact with the alkyl portions of 25-Thr and 27-Leu by van der Waals interaction. P1, P2, and P4 sites. The lactam at P1 inserts favorably into the S1 subsite and forms two stable 2.6-\u00c5 hydrogen bonds: one between the lactam oxygen and NE2 of 163-His, and another between the lactam NH and a water molecule at the bottom of this subsite. The C a of Leu at the P2 site in N1 moves into the S2 subsite by approximately 1 \u00c5 relative to the corresponding carbon atom in I2, and C b -C c of Leu forms an angle of approximately 408 to the phenyl at P2 in the I2 complex, inserting deeply into the S2 subsite. Another notable difference between N1 and I2 is the insertion of an Ala between P3 and P4 in I2, the latter of which was replaced by an isoxazole to block the N-terminal. As expected, the side chain of Ala at the current P4 position readily enters into the S4 subsite. Simultaneously, the backbone NH of Ala donates a hydrogen bond to the carbonyl oxygen of 190-Thr. The isoxazole at P5 makes Van der Waals contacts with 168-Pro and the backbone of residues 190-191.",

N1 binds to TGEV M pro in a similar mode to SARS-CoV M pro with some subtle differences (see Figure 3 ). First, after the nucleophilic addition reaction, the Michael acceptor does not remain in a plane as in the SARS-CoV M pro complex structure, but instead flips over by about 908 to interact with the backbone atoms of residues 141-142. Unlike the SARS-CoV M pro complexed with N1, the TGEV M pro lacks a water molecule connecting the ethyl ester with the side chain of residue 142 (Asn ! Ala in TGEV M pro ). The rate of chemical inactivation presumably depends on how the reactive vinyl group is oriented and on the extent to which the transition-state intermediate can be stabilized by proteases [42] . We suspect that in SARS-CoV M pro , the water molecule prevents the Michael acceptor from reorienting to accept a proton from the imidazole of 41-His in the transition state. Although the intermediate remains to be unveiled, this could partially explain why N1 has a higher inactivation rate constant (k 3 ) against TGEV M pro than SARS-CoV M pro s. Second, another water molecule in the TGEV M pro complex occupies an equivalent position to the 189-Gln side chain, which interacts with the backbone NH of Leu at P2 in SARS-CoV M pro -N1 complex. This water molecule, however, donates a 2.6-\u00c5 hydrogen bond to 47-Thr and accepts a 2.7-\u00c5 hydrogen bond from the NH backbone of Leu at P2. Third, the isoxazole sways to interact with the backbone atoms of residues 188-189. It is worth mentioning that these slight variations do not notably affect the K i , as the binding modes of P1, P2, and P4 remain the same as in SARS-CoV M pro . lM, and 2.7 lM, respectively (see Figure 4A -4C). The dose response curves all show that N3 was able to penetrate cells derived from different species and tissues to access its targets. Consequently, the results strongly imply that N3 was a widespectrum anti-CoV lead compound. However, we noticed some small discrepancies in the data between enzymeinhibition assays and cell-based assays. This can be explained by the different cells for the inhibitor to enter and by potential incongruities in the dependence of M pro for different CoVs. Furthermore, we cannot exclude the potential existence of differences among the bacterially expressed proteases in enzyme-inhibition assays and subtle differences in activity that were not fully revealed by the SARS-CoVderived substrate used in our in vitro assays.",

            "text": "Evidence suggests that CoVs may have completed at least two animal-to-human interspecies transmissions to date [22, 24, 25 ]. An alternative hypothesis has been proposed whereby the 1889-1890 pandemic characterized by malaise, fever, pronounced central nervous system symptoms, with a significant increase in case fatality with increasing age, was the result of interspecies transmission of bovine CoV to humans rather than an influenza virus [25] . Although this hypothesis needs more evidence to support, it is widely acknowledged that SARS resulted from animal-to-human transmission of a previously unknown CoV. CoVs, especially those that can infect hosts such as domestic animals and pets, which humans have frequent contact with, remain a potential threat to human health assuming they cross the interspecies barrier again. Hence, the development of wide-spectrum drugs will lead to increased protection of human health, a reduction of the considerable economic costs associated with CoVs, defense against endangered wild animals susceptible to infection, and valuable model animals such as transgenic mice with high mortality rates for CoVs. Identification of the CoV M pro as a conserved target among all CoVs will provide an opportunity for the development of broad-spectrum inhibitors against all CoV-related diseases. Ruprintrivir, whose backbone was also a trans-a, b-unsaturated ester incorporated with the peptidyl portion, has entered clinical trials against rhinovirus infection [42] , although it did not show inhibition of CoVs [20] . This is a compound with poor aqueous solubility and low oral bioavailability in animals. In preclinical animal studies, hydrolysis of this compound produced alcohol and carboxylic acid metabolite, which was 400-fold less active than ruprintrivir and was the predominant biotransformation pathway. Ruprintrivir is formulated as a suspension for intranasal delivery. Phase II studies reported ruprintrivir prophylaxis reduced the proportion of subjects with positive viral cultures and viral titers. Ruprintrivir is well tolerated, and the most common adverse effects of this compound are blood-tinged mucus and nasal passage irritation [45, 46] . This highlights that structure-assisted optimization of N3 could possibly lead to the discovery of a single agent to enter clinical trials against all CoV-associated diseases, although ultimate clinical potential requires more sufficient investigation. Our latest results show that N3 could also strongly inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV and TGEV in cell-based assays (data to be published elsewhere). Furthermore, since this compound was designed against a highly conserved region within the genus Coronavirus, it should have efficient resistance to the high mutation and recombination rates of CoVs. It is noteworthy that N3 also exhibited potent inhibition on the M pro s of HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1, two recently identified HCoVs associated with bronchiolitis, conjunctivitis, and pneumonia [2, 3] , in preliminary inhibition assays (see Table S2 ). This strongly supports our hypothesis that a single agent developed from N3 could provide an effective first line of defense against future emerging CoVrelated diseases. Moreover, it also suggests that incorporation of Michael acceptor with the peptidyl portion specific for proteases would be a good starting point for the development of inhibitors against viral Cys or Ser proteases. A comprehensive and systematic program of optimization of this class of inhibitors based on CoV M pro -inhibitor complexes is underway. We have so far crystallized MHV M pro , and the crystallization of M pro s of recently identified HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 are in progress.",

Then, a 3-ll aliquot of such solution was added to the drop, and the crystals were soaked for approximately 2-6 days. A single crystal was prepared for low-temperature data collection by transfer to a cryoprotectant solution containing 30% PEG 400 and 0.1 M Mes (pH 6.0) and then flash frozen in a stream of N 2 gas at 100 K. The set of SARS-CoV M pro -I2 complex data was collected to 2.7 \u00c5 resolution using a Mar345 image plate (Marresearch, Norderstedt, Germany) mounted on a Rigaku RU2000 X-ray generator (Sevenoaks, United Kingdom) operated at 48 kV and 98 mA (k \u00bc 1.5418 \u00c5 ).
