For countries at risk of introduction of H7N9, such as Vietnam, early detection of H7N9 virus is essential for the early containment of the virus. Insulated isothermal reverse transcriptase PCR (iiRT-PCR) is a portable PCR system that can be deployed under field conditions to identify pathogens at the sampling site. Applying PCR at the sampling site will greatly reduce the time to obtain a diagnostic result which allows the veterinary authority to take immediate action to contain disease spreading.",

The average time to obtain a laboratory result is 2.5 days, with the majority of this time being attributed to sample shipment and transport to the laboratories (6-24 hours on average). Novel technologies, such as the insulated isothermal PCR (iiRT-PCR), are portable PCR systems that can be applied under field conditions by the fast PCR reaction (in 42 minutes). The iiRT-PCR portable system is a miniature portable device for field test, using freeze-dried thermostable reagents and powered by rechargeable lithium batteries. The iiRT-PCR applies the concept of Rayleigh-Benard convection to drive a PCR reaction in capillary tubes.",

This system has recently been developed to rapidly detect pathogenic viruses, including white spot syndrome virus, classical swine fever, foot and mouth disease, equine influenza, bluetongue virus, and MERS-CoV.

The detection endpoint (all triplicates positive) was compared to that of RRT-PCR assays using primers and probe set of H7 CODA and H7 CNIC. The sensitivity of AIV H7 iiRT-PCR was shown to be comparable to that of H7 CODA RRT-PCR assay in detecting the 4 representative H7N9 viruses, while having at least one log higher sensitivity when compared to that of H7 CNIC RRT-PCR assay ( Table 3 ). The sensitivity of AIV N9 iiRT-PCR was shown to be about one log lower than that of H7 CODA RRT-PCR assay in detecting the four representative H7N9",

Using virus isolation as the gold standard, the iiRT-PCR showed a sensitivity of 98% and a specificity of 100%. Results from field pilot studies (unpublished data) showed that it was feasible to install the system rapidly at any given sites and that personnel in the flied could be trained in the use of the iiRT-PCR system within 2 days. One of the challenges of the system is how it will be incorporated into current ongoing active surveillance designs. iiRT-PCR can be complementary to current surveillance designs, yet it needs to be clear if and how results will be confirmed by standard laboratory-based tests (real-time RT-PCR, virus isolation, or sequencing) and how data sharing will occur from local levels to province or central levels.",

            "text": "By the end of March 2018, totally 1625 human cases were confirmed to be infected with avian influenza A (H7N9) virus in 27 provinces of mainland China. 1 The 2016-17 H7N9 epidemic wave [5th wave] began earlier, spread to more districts and counties in affected provinces, and had more confirmed human cases than previous epidemics. In this wave, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) was detected for the first in a human infection in Guangdong Province on February 13, 2017, with illness onset in December 2016. Thus far, 28 HPAI human infections have been identified, among which 27 reported in Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Inner Mongolia, and Hebei, and 1 imported case to Taiwan [WHO, 2018]. Following the 5th wave, the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) decided to implement nationwide H7N9 vaccination starting in September 2017. Inactivated bivalent vaccine (H5N1 Re-8 strain + H7N9 H7-Rel strain) replaced the previously used H5 inactivated vaccine, and vaccination was applied to all kept chicken, duck, goose and domestic quail, pigeon, and rare birds. During the 6th wave (winter season 2017-2018), only 3 human cases and 15 animal outbreaks were reported (as of June 2018). Currently, H7N9 circulation seems to be much lower in the poultry population, with only 1 outbreak was reported in the 2018-2019 influenza season 2 and only one human case was recently reported in April 2019 in Jiuquan City in Gansu Province. 3 Recent molecular characterization of H7N9 viruses showed a continuous evolution of the viruses similar to the H5N1 evolution. 4 The latest circulating H7N9 viruses are clustered into two main lineages: the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) and Pearl River Delta (PRD) HA lineage. Additionally, certain H7N9 viruses of the YRD lineage acquired multiple basic amino acids at the cleavage site of their HA gene, converting them into highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) variants. These HPAI viruses have been isolated from poultry, environmental samples, and human patients. In neighboring countries of China (Vietnam, Lao PDR, and Myanmar), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has been supporting risk-based active surveillance for influenza A and H7N9 in live bird markets and along the poultry value chain. In Vietnam, active surveillance was conducted in live bird markets (LBMs) in 26 out of 63 provinces for H5N1 and in 14 provinces for H7N9 during 2016-2017. From April 2017 to March 2018, the surveillance has detected influenza A virus in 38 out of 107 markets sampled (22% positive at sample level) (FAO, unpublished results). These markets were located in all 26 provinces. To date, H7N9 has not been detected through surveillance activities and no human infection has been reported, suggesting the virus is not currently present in Vietnam. Based on recent risk assessments, the threat of introduction of H7N9 into Vietnam remains moderate to high based on value chain studies, which have found undocumented movement of poultry into Vietnam from China and the recent occurrence of HPAI H7N9 in poultry in China.",

They can be easily transported under ambient temperature and used upon needed. Briefly, 100 \u03bcL of each swab sample was added to individual wells in the first row of preloaded 48-well extraction plate. The preloaded 48-well extraction plate was inserted into the instrument, and the \"start\" button was pressed. The extraction time was 25 minutes, and the eluted nucleic acid was available in the last row of the preloaded 48-well extraction plate. The nucleic acid was used immediately or stored at \u221280\u00b0C until use.",

Further validation is needed to show the possibility to use other sample types (environmental samples, human swabs) or to use the system to detect different HA (H5, H9) or NA-types (N6 or N8).Recently, other H7Nx were also found to be circulating in China and Southeast Asia. These H7Nx belong to the Eurasian H7-lineage and are distinct from the Chinese H7N9. The current H7 test will most likely also detect these viruses as the H7 iiRT-PCR primer/probe design targets a broad spectrum of H7. For public health purposes and early warning, this possible cross-reactivity can be considered beneficial as any type of H7 is potentially zoonotic and detection of H7Nx in livestock samples can serve as an early warning system to raise public awareness of circulating animal influenza with pandemic potential. Also, the N9 protocol can detect other non-H7N9 viruses, for example, H1N9 or H12N9 as shown inTable 1. Further steps in these cases should be confirmation of the subtype in the laboratory, followed by full HA and NA (or full genome) sequencing.The innate characteristics of the iiRT-PCR system make it a very useful tool for onsite diagnosis. The device is compact (hand-held), uses lyophilized thermostable PCR reagents, and runs on rechargeable batteries, enabling it to be used in various field conditions (live bird markets, farms, quarantine stations, veterinary stations, road check points, or hospitals) and thus reducing time of sample transportation. Having a quick result onsite will make it possible to initiate a quick response, such as initial movement control and quarantine measures in live bird markets or on farms, reducing the risks of further spread and potential human infections of H7N9. In Vietnam for example, the portable PCR was introduced into the active live bird market surveillance for the early detection of H7N9. Once a case of H7 would be detected in the field through the portable system, immediate movement restrictions will be put in place while waiting for confirmatory diagnosis from the laboratory.",
