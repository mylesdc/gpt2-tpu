Interestingly, all six animals showed an asymptomatic course of infection despite virus shedding via various routes indicating a highly adapted host-pathogen interaction.

            "text": "Most of emerging viruses that are continuously detected belong to the RNA viruses and are often zoonotic in nature with epidemic or epizootic potential in case of transmission to livestock or humans [1] [2] [3] . Interestingly, approximately 50% of the highly pathogenic diseases caused by these agents affect the central nervous system [4] [5] [6] . Emerging viruses and also viruses highly pathogenic for animal species often arise from animal reservoirs, namely bats, rodents and insectivores. Thus, reliable animal models for the in vivo analysis of host-pathogen interactions in respective reservoir species and the mechanisms that drive crossing of species barriers are urgently needed. This could also allow characterization of transmission routes and maintenance in reservoir populations of these viruses. The order Mononegavirales comprises non segmented negative stranded RNA viruses with a considerable number of highly pathogenic viruses which reside inconspicuously in natural reservoirs, e.g. lyssaviruses, paramyxoviruses and henipaviruses in bats. In case of transmission to susceptible animals or humans they cause fatal disease [7, 8] . Borna disease virus-1 (BoDV-1) also belongs to the order Mononegavirales and was classified within an own and currently growing family named Bornaviridae. A new classification of this family with subdivision into 5 species has been proposed with the classical Borna disease virus-1 as part of the species Mammalian 1 bornavirus [9] . Recently, a variegated squirrel-derived bornavirus (VSBV-1) was found in association with the death of three people indicating the zoonotic potential for this newly discovered bornavirus [10] . Comparably to other reservoir-bound viruses of the order Mononegavirales, BoDV-1 infection can lead to a lethal neurological disorder in accidental hosts such as horses and sheep due to a severe immune mediated non purulent meningoencephalitis [11] . The strictly endemic course of Borna disease with seasonal appearance in spring and early summer, the varying incidence between years with peaks every three to five years as well as the highly conserved viral genome pointed to a natural reservoir for BoDV-1 already for a long time [12] . However, many studies in wild rodents did not reveal any signs of BoDV-1 infection in these species [13] . First evidence of natural BoDV-1 infection in small mammals was provided by the detection of BoDV-1 antigen and RNA in bicolored white-toothed shrews (Crocidura leucodon) originating from an endemic area in Switzerland [14, 15] . This was substantiated by a study based on a geographic information system analysis which connects the prevalence of Borna disease and the distribution of C. leucodon [16] . Recently, similar occurrence of BoDV-1 infection in C. leucodon in endemic areas in Bavaria and in Saxony-Anhalt [17, 18] further underlines the role of this shrew species as BoDV-1 reservoir. Overlapping feature of all BoDV-1-infected shrewsregardless of their endemic origin-is the widespread virus distribution not only in the central nervous system (CNS) but also in peripheral organs capable of shedding virus in secretions and excretions [15, 17, 18] . Experimental BoDV-1 infection of neonatal immune incompetent rats leads to a quite comparable mode of virus distribution [19] . In these animals, persistent infection is achieved by immune tolerance. Obvious neurological signs are lacking but behavioural deficiencies have been noted. In contrast, adult Lewis rats exhibit a severe neurological biphasic disease due to a non purulent meningoencephalitis closely resembling the accidental host situation. Certain mice strains develop a fatal neurological disease only after intracerebral infection of newborns [20, 21] . Thus, outcome of experimental BoDV-1 infection in rodents such as mice and rats depend on the species and even the particular strain and, the age at time point of infection. The latter is most likely explainable by the status of the immune system. This leads to significant differences in virus-host interactions resulting in variable clinical outcome and fatality of disease, reaction pattern of the immune system, virus distribution and shedding.",

Trapping was performed at two sites in the administrative district of Swabia (permission No. 55.1-8646-2/75), a known endemic area for BoDV-1 infections and clinical apparent disease (Borna disease) in horses. After trapping, shrews were transported separately and put in husbandry. The animals were kept isolated from each other in single cages. They were kept in adapted standard cages type 4 and with respect to the natural requirements they were fed with a mixture of chicken heart muscle, chicken liver and insects. After an adaption period of 4 weeks and the initial veterinary care the animals stayed in husbandry for breeding. With respect to the high vulnerability to stress of wild-born animals, a health monitoring was installed. Once a day a visual examination of body condition, haired skin and behaviour was carried out and food intake was measured. Once a week body mass was recorded. The animals were monitored for any sign of direct abnormal behaviour or any indirect evidence like altered food intake, altered skin care or loss of body weight. In case of suffering, an early humane endpoint scheme adopted from laboratory rodents could be applied including euthanasia by anaesthesia conducted with CO 2 and decapitating. A postmortem examination scheme with evaluation of gross and histologic lesions could be performed to evaluate the cause of death.",

In totally six out of eleven shrews (female #2, male #5, female #6, male #9, male #10, male #12) natural BoDV-1-infection was confirmed by detection of viral RNA, in three out of eleven shrews (female #2, male #5, female #6) additionally by detection of infectious virus. Two of the naturally infected shrews (male #5, female #6) died about 9 weeks after the start of the observation period (see below). The five other shrews did not exhibit any evidence for BoDV-1-infection, neither infectious virus nor viral RNA was detected at any time point investigated. During the whole observation period up to 600 days, activity and behaviour during day or night light regime and food intake did not differ between infected and noninfected animals. Furthermore, there was no significant difference of relative body mass trend between infected and non-infected individuals (Mann-Whitney U-test, p > 0.06 for each comparison) (Fig 1) .

Viral RNA of isolates from saliva of #2 and saliva of #6 was sequenced (Genbank accession no. KM349818, KM 349819). In a 2150 nucleotide stretch (nt 17 to 2161 covering the N, X, P, half of M-protein-encoding regions) sequences of both isolates revealed a homology of 99% compared to a recent BoDV-1-sequence (GenBank accession no. KF275185) obtained from a shrew of the same endemic area and to an equine BoDV-1-sequence from a horse housed in the same region (GenBank accession no. KF275184) [17] . Both isolates are part of the regional BoDV-1 subcluster 1a. (Fig 3) The results obtained from the living shrews were compared to the organ distribution of viral antigen and BoDV-1-RNA in three naturally BoDV-1-infected C. leucodon from pest control (#2001 and #5017, [17] and another animal #5072 from the same stable as #5017) and in the two deceased shrews. Detailed information about organ distribution is given in S3 Fig. In all of these animals, mRNA, genomic RNA and/or viral antigen were detected in the nervous system and widespread in peripheral organs (e.g. epithelial cells of the parotid gland, lacrimal gland, sebaceous glands, bronchi, kidney tubules, esophagus and epidermal keratocytes) [17] (Fig 4) . Interestingly, viral antigen was also present in the uterus in one shrew. Thus, detection of viral RNA and infectious virus from secretions and excretions in the living shrews (saliva, lacrimal fluid, skin swabs, urine and faeces) fits well with the morphological demonstration of viral antigen and RNA in the respective organ systems and further confirms successful viral replication in peripheral organs. Beside virus shedding via secretions and excretions shedding of BoDV-1 seems also to be possible via scaling of epidermal epithelial cells.",

The order Mononegavirales comprises many viruses with high zoonotic and pathogenic properties, e.g. filoviruses, henipaviruses, paramyxoviruses and lyssaviruses which reside in bat reservoirs [7, 31] . In their biological behaviour, bornaviruses, as known from the mammalian Borna disease virus-1 (BoDV-1), are unique [10, 32] , but in several aspects pretty comparable to other neurotropic Mononegavirales. The recently found zoonotic variegated squirrel 1 Bornavirus (VSBV-1) clearly differs in its homology to the classical mammalian BoDV-1 but provides evidence for its zoonotic capacities [10] . As the current knowledge is sparse, it is not known if VSBV-1 share features with BoDV-1 behaviour. However, detection of VSBV-1 in several organs including CNS and peripheral organs like lung and kidney of the squirrel [10] also indicate a widespread virus distribution comparable to the BoDV-1 infected bicolored white-toothed shrew. Typically shrews rear up to four litters from March to September and winter resource shortage is the most important source for mortality [33] . Trapping took place during summer and autumn, therefore caught shrews were likely born in the same year and the age at time of trapping could be estimated between 1 to 6 months. As most of the offspring settles locally [33] kinship between the individuals and joint rearing cannot be excluded. During trapping, infection status of the individuals was unknown. Previous studies showed different infection prevalence of shrews that also differed between the trapping sites in the study. Hilbe et al [14] found only infected shrews (100%), Puorger et al. [15] detected 2/6 infected shrews (33%), Bourg et al. [17] showed 1/1 infected shrews (100%) at one site und 1/ 19 infected shrews (5%) at the other site whereas D\u00fcrrwald et al. [18] found an amount of 9/17 infected shrews (53%) at one site with a variance between the years from 25% to 100%. These differences can be due to the small number of animals in the respective population or represent the natural variation within the shrew population between sites and years. Since examination of larger cohorts has not been carried out so far, the percentage of naturally infected shrews among the trapped animals could not be predicted in detail. Six naturally infected shrews out of eleven shrews implies a percentage of 55% of infected shrews with variations between the sites and years from 50% (site A, year 2013 3/6, year 2014 1/2) to 66% (site B, year 2014 2/3). As all non-infected animals did not show any shedding during the whole observation period, transmission of the virus in the husbandry could be successfully prevented in captivity.",

            "text": "Interestingly, shedding of viral RNA was continuously present.As shrews were naturally infected before trapping, the time between the infection and first virus release remain unknown. However, low ct-values were found in samples taken at time points at least more than 4 to 8 weeks after infection and at time points at least more than 200 days after infection. This indicates a persistent BoDV-1 infection as known from other animals [11, 13] with long lasting and continuous virus release. There was certain variability in the amount of viral RNA, sites of shedding, between individual animals and for the time points of sampling. Some of these variations can be due to variations in sample size, as gathering of samples had to be performed non-invasive on non-anaesthesized animals. However, several shrews exhibited lowest ct-values in saliva and lacrimal fluid regardless of time point of sampling. Whether this might have a role for virus transmission, e.g. combating, needs to be further investigated. The simultaneous presence of viral antigen, viral mRNA and genomic RNA in CNS and peripheral tissues points to many sites of viral replication thereby enhancing probability of successful virus transmission to other animals [17] . Horizontal transmission of BoDV-1 in shrews might be either achieved via direct contact with secretions or excretions or even via contaminated environment. Since shrews are known to behave territorially, infection by infected saliva during combating for a habitat might also occur. Vertical transmission of BoDV-1 in shrews cannot be excluded as viral antigen has been detected in the uterus. However, the route of entry in the reservoir still remains unknown. Offspring might already be infected early by their mothers due to the various sites of viral shedding even from the skin. The underlying viral mechanisms of maintenance in the reservoir are still incompletely understood but might include adjusted viral life cycle possibly with attenuated pathogenicity, differences in viral entry and circumvention of the antiviral host immune system [4, 34, 35] . The latter could be achieved best in specific situations of the host immune system. Infection of animals in an immune-incompetent stage can lead to persistent, immune-tolerant virus infections, often associated with shedding of high doses of infectious virus and without any severe clinical signs and notable inflammatory lesions. To date it remains unknown whether disseminated BoDV-1 infection of shrews is only possible when infected in an immune incompetent state as known for rats [19] . However, the clinical inconspicuous course could point to an immune tolerant infection and a highly adapted viral-host interaction. Neonatally BoDV-1 infected rats display no neurological signs but increased motor activity, learning deficits and subtle changes in social behaviour and memory [36, 37] . Moreover, experimental BoDV-1 infection of the prosimian tree shrew (Tupaia glis) leads to a persistent infection and transient mild encephalitis, resulting in a disorder characterized primarily by hyperactivity and pronounced disturbances in social and breeding behavior rather than neurological signs [38] . In the neonatally BoDV-1 infected rat the behavioral changes were attributed to lesions in the hippocampus and cerebellum and in the tree shrew to alterations of the limbic system. Whether naturally BoDV-1 infected shrews also display subtle deficits in learning, memory and/or social behavior, especially mating, needs to be addressed in further behavioral and breeding experiments. As known so far, C. leucodon did not exhibit any morphological changes in cerebellum, hippocampus or elsewhere in the brain as noted for the neonatally infected rat. However, any behavioral changes might contribute to higher contact frequency or increased aggressive and territorial behavior thereby facilitating viral transmission and maintenance in the reservoir.",
