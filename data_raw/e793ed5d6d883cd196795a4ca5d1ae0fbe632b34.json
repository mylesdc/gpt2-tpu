            "text": "The manuscript by De Benedictis describes the isolation and characterization of several monoclonal antibodies to lyssaviruses, with potential utility for rabies post-exposure prophylaxis. A total of 500 mAbs were isolated from memory B cells from vaccinees prescreened for anti-RABV activity. From these, two mAbs (RVC20 and RVC58) were shown to neutralize with greater breadth and potency than those mAbs currently under clinical development. This data is supplemented by partial epitope mapping and virological analysis. Finally, the authors show that relatively low doses of a combination of these 2 mAbs protects hamsters from a lethal RABV challenge, and assessed the effect of these mAbs on vaccine responses in hamsters. The potential superiority of these new mAbs over CR57, CR4098 and RAB1 is clearly shown here, providing the basis for future clinical studies. Figure 2 and related text. There are some intriguing findings here. Although the reciprocal competition is very clean for mAbs to antigenic site I, it is more confusing for antigenic sites III and III.2, with mAbs RVB181, RVC56 etc. blocked by antigenic site III antibodies, but unable to block in the opposite assay. The authors speculate that these antibodies form a third cluster that recognizes a distinct site, but I am not sure this accounts for the timing. The opposite is true for RBV686. Are there potential other explanations e.g. conformational changes that could account for this? Figure 3 . the extraordinary breadth of RCV68 (despite low potency) suggests this target should be further investigated as a new conserved target. It would be worth adding this to the discussion. Page 7. Can the authors comment on the discrepancy between neutralization of pseudotyped viruses compared to live viruses by RVC68? Is this simply a general reflection of the reduced potency of the mAb compared to others i.e. is the pseudovirus assay intrinsically more sensitive or does this reflect the use of IC50 versus IC90? Figure 6 . Why is the more detailed analysis (the pie charts) only performed for selected sites? For Ag site 1, only the 2 most polymorphic sites are described, whereas for Ag site II only one site is omitted. Figure 7 . In panel A (the challenge study) the high dose is 0.045, whereas for the vaccine responsiveness experiments in panels B-D, HD is 40mg/kg. I found this confusing and would more clearly label the axes in B-D.",

We thank the reviewer for the positive comments on our study. The discrepancy in neutralisation observed between live virus and pseudotyped virus assays is likely due to more than one reason. Firstly, the density of the G protein on the surface of these viruses may differ.

Of note, we have further assessed whether the peripheral neutralizing titers conferring protection to hamsters may be due to either hamster endogenous post-vaccination immune response, to exogenous human antibodies due to passive immunization or by a mixture of them. We found that viral neutralization was mainly due to hamster endogenous response when HRIG or RVC20+RVC58 (0.045mg/kg) was administered, and that our cocktail had almost been fully cleared by the organism about 40 days after administration. As for the RVC20+RVC58 (40 mg/kg) antibody mixture (dubbed HD in the previous version), although the endogenous response elicited (as detected by ELISA by measuring the levels of hamster antibodies directed against the RABV G protein) indicated that an interference between the passively administered monoclonal antibodies and vaccine had somehow occurred, hamsters still had a high neutralizing titre in peripheral blood over 40 days post administration and were therefore still potentially protected against a lethal RABV challenge. These findings merit further investigations, as it has the potential to break the paradigm on which post-exposure prophylaxis approaches are based. Authors acknowledge that this important finding was not discussed in the previous version of the manuscript and for this reason a specific comment has been now added in the discussion section (page 13, lines 10-27).",

This characteristic of PV allowed for the isolation of mAbs that bound to the HA2 stem region of influenza A viruses, which is not readily exposed on the live virus (Corti et al. JCI 2010), but also for a more accurate reflection of lyssavirus epidemiology in bats, thanks to the greater sensitivity of the PV assay (Wright et al. Virology 2010). Secondly, PV-based assays allowthe study of entry inhibition however; in the case of live virus assays we also have the potential for viral replication and spread that could affect neutralisation titres.

A more detailed definition of the epitopes of this antibody panel would require further investigation and this work could be part of a follow-up study. Authors acknowledge that this point was not sufficiently explained in the previous version of the manuscript and have therefore addressed it accordingly (see Results page 6, lines 13-19).Figure 3. the extraordinary breadth of RCV68 (despite low potency) suggests this target should be further investigated as a new conserved target. It would be worth adding this to the discussion.We appreciate the Referee's point. The method used to isolate the monoclonal antibodies investigated in this study had already proven effective in identifying broadly neutralizing antiviral antibodies, which made it possible to discover conserved epitopes that may ultimately lead to design new vaccines capable of conferring broader protection (Corti and Lanzavecchia, Annual Review in Immunology 2013). In relation to rabies, the broadly neutralizing activity of the RVC68 antibody, in spite of its limited potency if compared to other antibodies isolated in the study, worth further investigation as it presumably recognizes a conserved and probably yet undetermined epitope.Possible applications of our findings may range from vaccine development, immune therapy or to the development of new diagnostic tools accounting for the wide lyssavirus diversity. Authors acknowledge that this finding was not sufficiently discussed in the previous version of the manuscript and have addressed the Referee's remark accordingly in the Discussion section (page 12, lines 15-17).",
