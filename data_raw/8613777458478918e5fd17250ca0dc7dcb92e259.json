            "text": "Hantaan virus (HTNV) is a major zoonotic pathogen that causes hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Asia, especially in China. Shaanxi province, which is located in northwest of China, is one of the areas in China most severely afflicted with HFRS epidemics annually. This study aims to establish a quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) assay to detect HTNV both in cell culture and clinical serum samples. We established a SYBR Green \u2160-based onestep qRT-PCR assay that targets the S segment of the HTNV genome for rapid detection and quantification. The HTNV cRNA standards were constructed by in vitro transcription, and the copy numbers of the HTNV cRNA were quantified. Standard curve was generated by determining the mean cycle threshold (Ct) values versus 10-fold serial dilutions of the HTNV cRNA over a range of 1\u00d710 8 to 1\u00d710 3 copies/\u03bcl. The standard curve had a reaction efficiency of 102.1%, a correlation coefficient (R 2 ) of 0.998, and a slope of -3.273. The coefficient of variation (CV) of the intraand inter-assays ranged from 0.68% to 3.00% and from 0.86% to 3.21%, respectively. The cycle intervals of the qRT-PCR assay between each dilution ranged from 2.9 to 3.8 cycles, and the lowest detection limit of the qRT-PCR assay was 10 copies/\u03bcl. The assay exhibited high specificity that was confirmed by melting curve analysis, and no cross reaction with the Seoul virus (SEOV) and other viruses (HBV, HCV and HIV) was observed. HTNV RNA was also detected in the 27 serum samples of clinical HFRS patients using the assay, and the HTNV RNA viral load ranged from 2.06\u00d710 1 to 1.95\u00d710 5 copies/\u03bcl. The SYBR Green \u2160-based one-step qRT-PCR assay is a sensitive, specific, reproducible, and simple method for detecting and quantifying HTNV in cell culture and clinical samples.

            "text": "Hantaan virus (HTNV) is a worldwide pathogen that causes serious infectious disease featured with febrile, mucocutaneous hemorrhage, renal damage and shock. The disease is thus named hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). The cases of HFRS in China account for nearly 90% of all HFRS cases worldwide [1] . During 1950-2007, 1,557,622 HFRS cases and 46,427 deaths from HFRS (a death rate of 3%) were reported in China [2] , and HFRS cases are reported in most provinces and cities (28/31) of mainland China annually [2, 3] , making HFRS a notable public health problem. Shaanxi province, which is located in northwest of China, is one of the most seriously afflicted areas [4] . Over the past decade (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) , the majority of HFRS cases (65%) occurred from October to December annually [4] . The composition of the population of HFRS cases has changed with the rapid development of society and the environment in recent years; however, the infected population is primarily 16-to 59-year-old farmers [4] .",

            "text": "HTNV (genus Hantavirus, family Bunyaviridae) is an enveloped virus with a single-stranded, negative-sense RNA genome. HTNV was the first hantavirus described and was isolated in 1978 [5] . The virion encloses three gene segments named L (large), M (medium), and S (small), which encode different proteins [6] . The L segment encodes an RNAdependent RNA polymerase, the M segment encodes two glycoproteins, Gn and Gc, and the S segment encodes a nucleocapsid protein (NP) [7] . Variation in the S and M segments may alter the virulence and antigenicity of hantaviruses [8] . The transmission pathway of hantavirus within rodents and from rodents to humans includes inhalation of aerosolized excreta (i.e., saliva, urine and feces), the consumption of contaminated food, or rodent bites [9] . Seven species of hantaviruses have been identified in China, but only HTNV, which is carried by Apodemus agrarius, and Seoul virus (SEOV), which is carried by Rattus norvegicus, are associated with HFRS [10] [11] [12] . However, the disease caused by HTNV is more clinically severe than that caused by SEOV [3] . HTNV has been reported to be the predominant etiological agent for HFRS in the Xi'an district of Shaanxi province, and SEOV and other hantavirus species are seldom detected [4] .",
