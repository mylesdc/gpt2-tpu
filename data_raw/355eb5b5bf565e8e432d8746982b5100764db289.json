Multiplex RT-PCR (SeeplexTM RV detection, Seegene) was performed to detected 12 respiratory viral pathogens. Results: A total of 607 hospitalized patients were enrolled from 2011 to 2013. Viruses were identified in 35.75 % (217/607) of cases, including 78 influenza virus A and B (IVA and IVB), 47 para-influenza viruses (PIVs), 41 respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and 38 adenovirus (ADV). For the children under 15 year old, the common detected viruses were influenza viruses, RSV, PIVS and ADV, while the principal respiratory viruses were human coronaviruses (HCoV), PIVs, influenza viruses for the old adults. Co-infections with multiple viruses were detected in 15.67 % of patients. Children under 5 years were more likely to have one or more detectable virus associated with their ARI. The peak of ARI caused by the respiratory viruses occurred in winter. Conclusion: This study demonstrated respiratory viruses were the major cause of hospitalized ARI patients in Shandong Province, influenza virus was the most common detected, RSV was the highest incidence among the young children (\u22645 years). These findings also gave a better understand of virus distribution among different age and seasons, which help to consider potential therapeutic approaches and develop effective prevention strategies for respiratory virus infection.",

The major viral agents of ARIs include influenza viruses A and B (IAV,IBV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), para-influenza viruses (PIVs), adenovirus (ADV) and human rhinovirus (HRV).

The epidemic characteristic differed among the age groups and seasonality.

For the young children less than 5 years, the positive rate was three times than that in old adults (15.63 % VS 4.62 %). The influenza virus A(H1N1) pdm09 and dynamic change of influenza viruses could explain this shift. As an emergence infectious disease, people could be vulnerable to infection with influenza virus A (H1N1) pdm09 because of low antibody in the second wave in 2010-2011 surveillance season [20] . The influenza surveillance data also verified that influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 was the main strain in Shandong in 2011 and 2013 [21] . After that in 2011, IVB became the predominant strain in 2012 due to the limited immunological cross-reactivity between influenza subtypes which lead to the increase of the infection population [20, 21] . Our study also highlighted a clear seasonal distribution of influenza viruses which were active in winter and IVA was detected in the four seasons.",

In 2012, IBV had the highest incidence (14.62 %), accounting for 34.25 % of all positive samples, followed by RSV, HRV and PIVs. In 2011, IAV was the most common virus in 2011, followed by ADV and PIVs, while IVA was the predominant pathogen in 2013, followed by PIVs, ADV and RSV. At the same time, the rate of the sample amount in 2013 (48.21 %) was higher than the other 2 years (39.18 and 19.38 %) in the non-epidemic season of respiratory virus infection (May-October) which lead to the decrease of positive rate in 2013.",
