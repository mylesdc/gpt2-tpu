            "text": "Pre-existing immunity to human adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) is common in the general population. Bypassing pre-existing immunity could maximize Ad5 vaccine efficacy. Vaccination by the intramuscular (I.M.), nasal (I.N.) or oral (P.O.) route with Ad5 expressing Ebola Zaire glycoprotein (Ad5-ZGP) fully protected na\u00efve mice against lethal challenge with Ebola. In the presence of pre-existing immunity, only mice vaccinated I.N. survived. The frequency of IFN-c+ CD8+ T cells was reduced by 80% and by 15% in animals vaccinated by the I.M. and P.O. routes respectively. Neutralizing antibodies could not be detected in serum from either treatment group. Pre-existing immunity did not compromise the frequency of IFN-c+ CD8+ T cells (3.961% na\u00efve vs. 3.661% pre-existing immunity, PEI) nor anti-Ebola neutralizing antibody (NAB, 40610 reciprocal dilution, both groups). The number of INF-c+ CD8+ cells detected in bronchioalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) after I.N. immunization was not compromised by pre-existing immunity to Ad5 (146614, na\u00efve vs. 120616 SFC/million MNCs, PEI). However, pre-existing immunity reduced NAB levels in BAL by ,25% in this group. To improve the immune response after oral vaccination, the Ad5-based vaccine was PEGylated. Mice given the modified vaccine did not survive challenge and had reduced levels of IFN-c+ CD8+ T cells 10 days after administration (0.360.3% PEG vs. 1.760.5% unmodified). PEGylation did increase NAB levels 2-fold. These results provide some insight about the degree of T and B cell mediated immunity necessary for protection against Ebola virus and suggest that modification of the virus capsid can influence the type of immune response elicited by an Ad5-based vaccine.",

            "text": "The ability of human adenoviruses to induce strong innate and adaptive immune responses makes them powerful adjuvants that facilitate the immune response against an encoded antigen. Recombinant adenoviruses have been shown to elicit significant immune responses to bacterial (anthrax, plague), viral (Hepatitis C, Rabies, SARS) and tumour-associated antigens [1] [2] [3] . While these results are encouraging, immunity eventually develops against virus capsid proteins. This severely reduces the immunogenicity of adenovirus-based vaccines in mice, [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] , primates [9] and humans [10] . This problem is also significant since a large portion of the Western world has marked levels of anti-adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) antibodies and is also prominent in regions of sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia, where many of these vaccines are needed [11, 12] . Thus, assessment of the impact of pre-existing immunity on immune protection and alternative vaccination strategies may be needed for successful use of many adenovirusbased vaccines.",

Increasing the vector dose or adopting a prime-boost regimen in order to overcome pre-existing immunity to the virus is a common approach [2] . There is mixed enthusiasm for this plan, however, due to the documented toxicity associated with high doses of adenovirus and the length of time required for primeboost regimens when only a prime could be sufficient [13, 14] . 'Seroswitching', using recombinant adenoviruses constructed from chimpanzees or rare human serotypes with limited exposure rates such as adenoviruses 35 and 11 can elicit potent immune responses that are minimally affected by pre-existing immunity [7, 8, [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . Hexon-chimeric adenoviruses can also avoid neutralization [22, 23] . Both approaches offer promise in the context of addressing pre-existing immunity, but require further investigation in response to concerns regarding safety and feasibility of largescale production. Covalent attachment of polyethylene glycol or incorporation of the virus into polymer matricies can also effectively protect Ad5 from neutralization [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] . Delivery of Ad5-based vaccines by mucosal routes can also circumvent the effect of pre-existing immunity and induce a significant immune response against an encoded antigen [32] .",

The primary objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that administration of an Ad5-based Ebola vaccine by either the nasal or oral route can circumvent pre-existing immunity and confer full protection upon challenge. Systemic and mucosal T and B cell responses to Ebola GP were assessed in both na\u00efve mice and those with pre-existing immunity.

The number of activated IFN-c secreting mononuclear cells harvested from splenocytes was significantly reduced by 38 and 59% in mice vaccinated nasally or orally when compared to those immunized by intramuscular injection (p#0.05, Figure 2A ). In contrast, samples obtained from the spleen of animals with pre-existing immunity that were immunized by the I.N. route contained the highest number of activated IFN-c secreting cells (8156190 spot-forming cells (SFC)/ million mononuclear cells (MNCs), Figure 2C ) although this was approximately 30% lower than that seen in naive animals (1,3406146 SFC/million MNCs, Figure 2A ). Pre-existing immunity also significantly reduced the number of these cells produced by animals immunized by the I.M. (210668 SFC/million MNCs) and P.O. routes (71612 SFC/million MNCs) with respect to those seen in na\u00efve animals (2,145612 (I.M.) and 8856168 (P.O.)), p#0.05, Figure 2A) . A very limited number of activated IFN-c secreting mononuclear cells were detected in splenocytes of na\u00efve animals immunized with the AdlacZ vector (50620 SFC/million MNCs, Figure 2A ) and those with pre-existing immunity to the same virus (1261, AdlacZ, Figure 2C ). Significant levels of INF-c positive cells were detected in bronchioalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) after intranasal immunization (146614 SFC/million MNCs, p#0.05, Figure 2B ). This was not significantly compromised by pre-existing immunity to adenovirus (120616 SFC/million MNCs, p#0.06, Figure 2D) . A limited number of INF-c secreting cells were detected in BAL from na\u00efve animals immunized by the I.M. or P.O. routes (462 and 1165 SFC/million MNCs respectively, Figure 2B ) and were similar to that seen in samples obtained from animals given the AdlacZ vector (1261, negative control). Pre-existing immunity to adenovirus reduced these cell populations further to values that were not statistically significant (161 (I.M.), 562 (P.O.) and 261 (AdlacZ) SFC/million MNCs (p = 0.08, Figure 2D) ). INF-c positive cells were found in mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) and Peyer's Patches (PP) (146611 and 2965 SFC/million MNCs, respectively) only after oral vaccination with Ad-ZGP ( Figure 2B ). Pre-existing immunity, however, reduced production of these cells to 18612 SFC/million MNCs (MLN) and 1662 SFC/million MNCs (PP) ( Figure 2D ).",

To date, few efforts have been made to focus on the mucosa as the primary sight of exposure to Ebola virus and priming it for participation in the host defense by vaccination [47] . This is surprising given that the pulmonary, nasal and oral immune systems which comprise the mucosal-associated lymphoid tissues (MALT) are responsible for the production of approximately 80% of all immunocytes [48, 49] and mucosal immunity is often the first line of defense against pathogens coming in contact with susceptible hosts. Many studies in rodents indicate that systemic immunization produces strong anti-viral systemic responses while mucosal vaccination can stimulate both the mucosal and systemic immune systems and can confer long-term immunological memory against a given pathogen despite the fact that the magnitude of these responses are often reported to be somewhat reduced [37, 48, 50] . We have found this to be the case in the studies outlined here since the systemic cellular response and neutralizing antibody levels against Ebola Zaire GP were consistently lower following nasal and oral vaccination. Mucosal vaccination did, however, generate significant cellular and antibody responses in the periphery (BAL, MLN or Peyer's patches) and a single intranasal immunization with Ad5-ZGP conferred 100% protection even in the presence of pre-existing immunity.",

            "text": "Administration of recombinant adenovirus-based vaccines to the mucosa has also conferred sufficient protection against challenge with a variety of pathogens in the presence of preexisting immunity to the vaccine carrier in mice and other preclinical models of disease [5, 19, 32, 51, 52] . This served as a basis for the present study. A single intranasal dose of a recombinant Ad5 vaccine expressing the Zaire Ebola glycoprotein conferred 100% protection in both na\u00efve mice and those with pre-existing immunity despite the fact that the strength of the immune response generated by this route of administration was quantitatively lower than that seen in animals vaccinated by intramuscular injection. It is also important to note that pre-existing immunity induced by intramuscular injection did not severely compromise the T cell-mediated response at either the systemic or mucosal levels in these animals. The level of anti-Ebola GP antibodies in the circulation and in the lung was also not significantly compromised by pre-existing immunity to adenovirus. While these results suggest that intranasal vaccination with an Ad-based vaccine is indeed a promising strategy to overcome pre-existing immunity, one might wonder how accurately our results translate to natural exposure to the wild type virus via the respiratory tract. This is somewhat difficult to establish in the mouse model since the ability of the wild-type adenovirus to replicate is limited [53] . In addition, the amount of neutralizing antibody present in the nasal cavity of those in the general population with pre-existing immunity to adenovirus 5 has not been assessed to the degree that serum neutralizing antibodies have, making it difficult to set a relative parameter for one to target in pre-clinical animal models. Lack of this data may be due to the invasive nature of the technique for acquiring samples and/or the fact that antibody levels in the mucosa of individuals with established pre-existing immunity to adenovirus type 5 are quite low and transient in contrast to systemic levels of anti-adenovirus neutralizing antibodies which are quite robust and persist over time (unreported observations). Thus, for these studies, we decided to induce pre-existing immunity against adenovirus by intramuscular injection at a dose that has been shown to induce production of systemic neutralizing antibodies at 1:320, a level mostly below what was reported in humans with documented preexisting immunity [8, 11, 12] . Additional studies designed to assess the amount of neutralizing antibody to AdHu5 in the lung over time after intranasal administration of varying doses of AdHu5 are currently underway in an effort to further define stringent conditions under which pre-existing immunity can be established for experimental testing.",

Immunization by this route induced quantitatively lower T and B cell mediated immune responses against Ebola glycoprotein with respect to that achieved by either intramuscular or intranasal immunization. Despite this, every na\u00efve animal immunized with a single oral dose of Ad-ZGP survived challenge, giving better precision on the minimal threshold of immunity required to achieve protection. As seen with intranasal immunization, the T cell-mediated response was not compromised by pre-existing immunity 10 days after oral vaccination. The number of IFN-c secreting T cells in both mucosal and systemic compartments of these animals at day 45, however, was significantly reduced by pre-existing immunity. It is possible that the peak T cell response at day 10 does not reflect the extent by which pre-existing immunity decreases the Ad5-ZGP-induced T cell response. Alternatively, it is also possible that the ELISPOT assay could detect subtle variations that flow cytometery could not monitor accurately due to differences in the sensitivity of each assay. Neutralizing antibody was not detected in the serum of animals with pre-existing immunity given a single oral dose of the vaccine. More importantly, none of these animals survived challenge with mouse adapted Ebola.",

Interestingly, the T-cell mediated immune response was significantly reduced and antibody levels increased in na\u00efve animals given a single oral dose of the PEGylated vaccine with respect to that seen in animals given the same dose of unmodified Ad5-ZGP. It has been shown that modification of virus capsids by PEGylation can significantly dampen the T-cell mediated immune response against the virus and stimulate the antibody response against a secreted antigen [26, 27, 30, 54] . Taken together, these data support the notion that the exposition of the virus capsid proteins facilitates the immune response against the encoded antigen. Optimization of PEGylation chemistries and/or densities on adenovirus-based vaccine that promote and strengthen protective immune responses following oral immunization is currently underway.",

Vaccines administered in this manner will offer improved safety with respect to disease transmission and needle-stick injuries among health care workers, significant issues of concern in developing countries where the demand for many vaccines is high [55] . Mucosal administration of vaccines reduces the pain associated with vaccination, eliminates the need for specialized training programs for large vaccination campaigns and makes selfadministration of the vaccine possible. This route of administration may also significantly reduce systemic toxicity associated with recombinant adenovirus despite the fact that it has been shown that nasal immunization with recombinant adenovirus-based vaccines can facilitate translocation of the virus to the central nervous system [52] . Even though testing of other virus-based vaccines such as influenza have reported similar findings and are currently used in the clinic [56] , studies designed to fully assess the toxicological profile of adenovirus vaccine after nasal administration are also currently underway.",

The issue of pre-existing immunity must also be adequately addressed in order to develop efficient recombinant adenovirus-based vaccines. While the majority of the literature suggests that pre-existing immunity significantly hamper the effective use of AdHu5 vaccine carriers, other investigators have reported that pre-existing immunity did not interfere with the potency of recombinant Ad5-based vaccines in both pre-clinical models of disease and in humans [59, 60] . Thus, additional studies identifying clinically relevant conditions under which to test Ad-based vaccine candidates are necessary to assess the full impact of pre-existing immunity on vaccine potency, including in different compartments. Better define the role of preexisting immunity on vaccine-induced immunity will further the understanding of how individuals previously exposed to adenovirus will respond to these immunization regimens.",
