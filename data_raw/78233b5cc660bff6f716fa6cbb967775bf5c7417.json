Interestingly, avian viruses were relatively more replication permissive in all three bat species of cells than with the use of human viruses which suggest that bats could potentially play a role in the ecology of avian influenza viruses.

Despite being hosts to such an array of pathogens, bats generally show mild or no clinical symptoms to their presence, a phenomenon that is largely a mystery and a potential biomedical treasure trove that could offer new insights into the treatment and control of such pathogens in humans and affected animals. The lack of illness does not mean that bat cells are not infected by such viruses. Bat cells are susceptible to infections with paramyxoviruses and filoviruses [4] , and show varying degree of permissiveness to virus replication, which is a pre-requisite for the hosts to acquire carrier status. Bat lung epithelial cells (TB1-Lu) of Tadarida brasiliensis display resistance to reovirus infection; infected cells show no cytopathic effects and rapid decline in virus production; however, low virus release is maintained for at least 2 months [5] . Murine encephalomyocarditis virus, in contrast, causes severe cytopathic damage in TB1 Lu cells, and Ebola virus shows persistent infection in such cells [5] .",

These viruses are, however, highly divergent from conventional mammalian and avian influenza A viruses. Chimeric virus housing the six core genes from bat H17N10 virus replicated well in human primary airway epithelial cells and mice, but poorly in avian cells and chicken embryos without further adaptation [7] . Furthermore, the chimeric bat virus failed to reassort with conventional influenza viruses in MDCK cells [7] . Bat viral ribonucleopolymerase (vRNP) complex subunits (PB1, PB1 and PA) were not functionally interchangeable with corresponding human virus-derived vRNP subunits suggesting there is limited reassortment potential between bat and human influenza viruses [8] . However, vRNP from bat H17N10 virus is able to drive with high efficiency the non-coding region of human H1N1 virus (A/WSN/ 1933) in vRNP minigenome reporter assays, highlighting the possibility of viable reassortment between bat and human influenza viruses [9] . Although the issue of functional reassortment between native bat and conventional influenza A viruses has not been fully resolved, its likelihood is presently considered low.",

Similar number of infected cells were found among all seven bat cell lines by immunocytochemical detection of viral nucleoprotein (NP) [4] . Human virus-derived vRNP complex was shown to perform better than avian virusderived vRNP complex in the same A/WSN/33 viral backbone at progeny virus release, based mostly on the use of TB1-Lu bat cells, which appear inherently resistant to influenza virus infection [8] . Although there is limited potential for reassortment between human and bat influenza viruses [8] , Pteropus alecto kidney cells were able to produce reassorted progeny from human H1N1 (A/WSN/1933) and highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 (A/Vietnam/1203/04) viruses [10] . Collectively, these findings appear to indicate that bat cells are susceptible to infection with conventional mammalian and avian influenza viruses. However, we are unclear about the relative permissiveness of bat respiratory epithelial cells to conventional influenza viruses in the production of viable progeny. Although bats are not known to act as hosts for human and avian influenza viruses, the potential epidemiological significance of avian influenza virus infection in bats was highlighted by the recent discovery that around 30 out of 100 free ranging Eidolon helvum (fruit bats) in Ghana were serologically positive for avian H9 virus [11] .",

We found that all three species of bat cells were more resistant than control Mardin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, in terms of reduced progeny virus production and higher cell viability, which appeared not to depend on JAK/STAT signalling.

Viruses were propagated in 10-day old embryonated chicken eggs in accordance to Operation of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 (UK). Forty-eight hours post-infection (hpi), allantoic fluid was harvested and virus was titrated and stored at \u2212 80\u00b0C. Cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and infected with specified dose of virus in serum-free infection medium (Ultraculture, Lonza) supplemented with 1% P/S, 1% glutamine and 500 ng/ml tosyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK) trypsin. After 2 h of virus incubation, cells were washed three times with PBS, and incubated in fresh infection medium for a further specified period. For virus quantification, focus forming assay was performed on MDCK cells that were infected for 6 h. Cells were immunolabelled using an EnVision+ system-HRP (DAB) kit (Dako) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Mouse monoclonal antibody (AA5H; Abcam) was used at 1 \u03bcg/ml for 40 min for viral nucleoprotein (NP) detection. Positively stained cells were visualised and counted using an inverted microscope. The average number of cells positive for NP in six wells of a 96-well plate was used to calculate infectious focus-forming units (ffu) of virus per microlitre of infection volume from which MOI dosage was derived. A virus dose of 1.0 MOI is regarded as the minimum volume of virus needed to infect each MDCK cell in a culture well as determined by NP detection at 6 hpi.

At 6 hpi, there was little or no detection of NP; at 24 hpi, NP was found only in a limited proportion of nuclei (Fig. 1b) .

In contrast, in E. helvum cells infected with human viruses (USSR H1N1 and pdm H1N1), NP was only detected in a small proportion of cells even at 24 hpi suggesting that they were less infected with human than avian influenza viruses. A similar infection pattern was observed in C. perspic cells. At 6 hpi with avian viruses, most nuclei of C. perspic cells were strongly labelled for NP and by 24 hpi, cytoplasmic NP was evident with extensive cell loss (Fig. 1d ). With human USSR or pdm H1N1 virus, limited number of C. perspic cells were infected even at 24 hpi with NP largely localised to the nuclei. In summary, all three species of bat cells infected with human and avian influenza viruses showed much less viral NP production than correspondingly infected MDCK cells, with TB1-Lu cells producing the least viral NP. Relatively, E. helvum and C. perspic cells showed greater NP production and cell loss at 24 hpi when infected with avian than with human viruses.",

The recent finding of 30% of free ranging E. helvum (large fruit bats) in Ghana to be serologically positive for avian H9 virus [11] . We found that the lung epithelial cells of three diverse bat species, T. brasiliensis (a medium insectivorous bat), E. helvum and C. perspicillata (a small mainly fruit bat) were consistently more resistant to avian and human influenza A viruses than correspondingly infected control MDCK cells in terms of reduced progeny virus production, less infected cells and greater cell viability. Interestingly, between avian (H2N3 and H6N1) and human (USSR H1N1 and pdm H1N1) viruses, bat cells, in particular E. helvum and C. perspic, infected with avian viruses were more permissive to virus production and showed greater cytopathogenicity than those infected with human viruses.",

TB1-Lu cells were most resistant among the three species, producing the least number of infected cells and progeny viruses. Both host SA\u03b12,3-Gal and SA\u03b12,6-Gal receptors appear important in all bat cells for entry of conventional influenza A viruses in that their removal by sialidase treatment led to significant reduction in virus output. The weak presence of SA\u03b12,6-Gal receptor in TB1-Lu cells could account in part for host resistance to the entry of human influenza viruses. There were differences in the expression of viral proteins (PB1, M1 and NP) between the three bat cell types separately infected with avian H2N3 and human USSR H1N1 virus. Such differences in a b Fig. 5 Variation in viral protein production between infected bat cells. All three species of bat cells and MDCK cells were infected with human USSR H1N1 (a) or avian H2N3 (b) virus at 0.5 MOI for 24 h for the detection of viral PB1, NP and M1 along with detection of \u03b2-actin as loading control. Differential viral protein expression of PB1, NP and M1 was evident between the three bat cell types for each virus (a and b). All three viral proteins were strongly expressed in MDCK and E. helvum cells with each virus. USSR H1N1 virus infected TB1-lu cells showed weak expression of each viral protein; similarly avian H2N3 virus infected TB1-Lu cells showed faint presence of PB1 and M1 proteins. Infected C. perspic cells displayed an intermediate pattern of viral protein expression that was between that of correspondingly infected E. helvum and TB1-Lu cells. Insets are corresponding densitometric quantification of Western blotting results. Significance indicated is in relation to corresponding MDCK cells viral protein expression could not readily account for the differences in virus output or cell viability observed between the species of bat cells but hint at the possible presence of translational/post-translational mechanisms of virus inhibition in bat cells as added layers of host innate resistance.",

            "text": "Given that bats play hosts to a diverse range of deadly zoonotic viruses often without serious clinical consequences to themselves, it is reasonable to assume that there are generic innate immune responses in bats that are effective across different viral pathogens. Insights into such processes could provide invaluable basic knowledge for the control and treatment of lethal human infections transmitted by bats. The JAK-STAT pathway is a major signalling pathway of type I interferons and cytokines in the transcriptional activation of anti-viral responses. Based on the use of pyridone 6 (JAK inhibitor), we found that the JAK-STAT pathway in the three species of bat cells appeared not to be critical in the control of influenza virus production. This observation is consistent with the recent finding that certain bat cells have a dampened interferon response due to the replacement of the highly conserved serine residue (S358) in STING, an essential adaptor protein in multiple DNA sensing pathways [25] . Additional work is needed to further assess (chemically and genetically) the anti-viral role of JAK/STAT signalling in bat cells. The unavailability of bat species-specific reagents is currently a major research bottleneck hampering progress in the area. There are obvious needs for bat species-specific gene sequences and antibodies to be able to conduct quantitative PCR and Western blotting to detect members of the innate immunity such as specific interferons, cytokines and their corresponding responsive gene products. The NF-\u03baB pathway has a complex relationship with influenza A virus. Inhibition of NF-\u03baB signalling in murine and human respiratory epithelial cells has been shown to reduce both virus replication and production of proinflammatory cytokines following avian and human influenza virus infections [26, 27] . However, for the wealth of evidence that supports NF-\u03baB as a pro-viral agent in the promotion of influenza virus propagation, there is credible evidence to show that NF-\u03baB is also a mediator of inflammatory and anti-viral responses [28] [29] [30] . We speculate that the NF-\u03baB pathway could be functionally more important in bat cells than the JAK/STAT pathway.",

Furthermore, avian H2N3 virus conferred higher M-gene expression than corresponding human USSR H1N1 virus infection in each bat species. Collectively, these results indicate that all three species of bat cells are more resistant than MDCK cells to influenza virus infection of which TB1-Lu cells are most resistant, and that E. helvum and C. Bat respiratory epithelial cells were less susceptible than MDCK cells to influenza A virus infections but showed differential susceptibility between human and avian influenza viruses. Epithelial cells of T. brasiliensis (TB1-Lu), E. helvum, C. perspic and control MDCK cells were separately infected with human (USSR H1N1 and pdm H1N1) and avian (H2N3 and H6N1) viruses at 1.0 MOI for 6 h and 24 h, and immunostained (brown) for viral NP. Expectedly, MDCK cells were extensively infected showing nuclear localisation of NP at 6 hpi, and widespread cytoplasmic spread of NP at 24 hpi with each virus type (a). TB1-Lu cells, by contrast, were not readily infected by human or avian viruses; even at 24 hpi only a limited number of cells showed intranuclear NP localisation (b). E. helvum and C. perspic cells showed differential infection susceptibility between human and avian viruses. Cells from the two bat species, like TB1-Lu cells, were not readily infected with human viruses (USSR H1N1 or pdm H1N1 virus) such that relatively few cells showed intranuclear NP localisation at 24 hpi (c and d). However, E. helvum and C. perspic cells were extensively infected by 6 hpi with avian viruses (H2N3 or H6N1 virus), and by 24 hpi exhibited extensive cell loss and cytoplasmic spread of NP (c and d)",

Cells of all three bat species (TB1-Lu, E. helvum and C. perspic) and MDCK cells were infected with human or avian viruses at 0.5 MOI (based on focus forming assays) for 24 h. Supernatants were titrated on MDCK cells in 6 h focus forming assays to quantify progeny virus release. Infected bat cells of all three species produced significantly less viable virus than correspondingly infected MDCK cells (a-d). TB1-Lu cells released the least progeny virus among the three bat species. Furthermore, proportionally more progeny avian (H2N3 and H6N1) than human (USSR and pdm H1N1) viruses were produced from each species of bat cells. Results shown are the combined results of three independent experiments. Typically virus output from infected MDCK cells is in the region of 200 ffu/\u03bcl (a-d).
