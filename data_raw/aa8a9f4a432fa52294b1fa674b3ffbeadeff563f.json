            "text": "Background: Human pathogenic coronavirus NL63 (hCoV-NL63) is a group 1 (alpha) coronavirus commonly associated with respiratory tract infections. In addition to known non-structural and structural proteins all coronaviruses have one or more accessory proteins whose functions are mostly unknown. Our study focuses on hCoV-NL63 open reading frame 3 (ORF 3) which is a highly conserved accessory protein among coronaviruses. Results: In-silico analysis of the 225 amino acid sequence of hCoV-NL63 ORF 3 predicted a triple membranespanning protein. Expression in infected CaCo-2 and LLC-MK2 cells was confirmed by immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis. The protein was detected within the endoplasmatic reticulum/Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) where coronavirus assembly and budding takes place. Subcellular localization studies using recombinant ORF 3 protein transfected in Huh-7 cells revealed occurrence in ERGIC, Golgi-and lysosomal compartments. By fluorescence microscopy of differently tagged envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins it was shown that ORF 3 protein colocalizes extensively with E and M within the ERGIC. Using N-terminally FLAG-tagged ORF 3 protein and an antiserum specific to the C-terminus we verified the proposed topology of an extracellular N-terminus and a cytosolic C-terminus. By in-vitro translation analysis and subsequent endoglycosidase H digestion we showed that ORF 3 protein is N-glycosylated at the N-terminus. Analysis of purified viral particles revealed that ORF 3 protein is incorporated into virions and is therefore an additional structural protein.",

The genome of hCoV-NL63 comprises 27,553 nt and has a gene organization conserved in all CoV, i.e., gene 1a/b, spike (S), open reading frame 3 (ORF 3), envelope (E), membrane (M) and the nucleocapsid (N) gene. CoV virions consist of a nucleocapsid core surrounded by an envelope containing three membrane proteins, S, E, and M. CoV assemble and bud at membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) [8, 9] . While the budding site of several CoV has been localized at the ERGIC, the viral surface proteins can also be found in downstream compartments of the secretory pathway [8] . M localizes predominantly in the Golgi apparatus [10, 11] , S is found along the secretory pathway and at the plasma membrane [12, 13] , and E is detected in perinuclear regions, the ER and Golgi [14] [15] [16] . S and M are typically glycosylated and it was shown that glycosylation plays an important role in the generation of bioactive protein conformations and influences fusion activity, receptor binding, and antigenic properties of CoV [17] [18] [19] [20] .",

The SARS-CoV ORF 3a protein is expressed in infected cells and patient sera contained antibodies reactive with recombinant ORF 3a antigen. The N-terminal ectodomain was able to induce virus-neutralizing antibodies in rabbits [31] . SARS-CoV ORF 3a protein is a triple-spanning membrane protein with a similar topology as the M protein, and is integrated into virions [32] . Moreover, truncated forms were discovered for recombinantly and virally expressed ORF 3a protein which could also be detected in virions [33] . Unlike the M protein it is not N-glycosylated but O-glycosylated and it was shown to interact with E, M and S protein [16, [34] [35] [36] . Subcellular localization of ORF 3a protein was found to be at the Golgi complex and the plasma membrane where it was also internalized by endocytosis [36] . ORF 3a protein was shown to induce apoptosis [37] and cell cycle arrest [38] and to up-regulate expression of fibrinogen in lung epithelial cells [39] . Although small interfering RNAs targeting the ORF 3a-specific viral subgenomic RNA were able to reduce viral replication [40] , deletion of ORF 3a from an infectious cDNA clone had no effect on viral replication in cell culture and mice [28] . Moreover it has been demonstrated that SARS-ORF 3a protein forms a homotetramer through inter-protein disulfide bonds, functionally working as a potassium ion channel that modulates virus release [41] . Very recently it was shown that the ORF 3a protein disrupts the architecture of the Golgi apparatus and might thus be responsible for the formation of vesicular structures in which virus replication takes place [42] .",

It was shown that virulence of these viruses could be reduced by altering the ORF 3 gene through cell culture adaptation [44, 45] . For hCoV-NL63, preliminary experiments suggested that deletion of ORF 3 had little influence on viral replication in cell culture [46] . However, the closely related hCoV-229E has a homologous gene named ORF 4 that is split into two ORFs (4a and 4b) in cell culture but maintained in all circulating viruses. This suggests an in-vivo function that may not be necessary for viral replication in cell culture [47] .",

To investigate colocalization of NL63-ORF 3 protein with structural proteins, an expression plasmid containing ORF 3 with an N-terminal FLAG-tag epitope was co-transfected with vectors coding for green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to hCoV-NL63 E, M and N proteins, respectively. Expression of proteins with correct molecular weights was confirmed by Western blot analysis (data not shown). The ERGIC compartment was stained in transfected cells as described above. As shown in Figure 4 , GFP-E and GFP-M both showed extensive colocalization with FLAG-ORF 3 protein. Protein complexes were localized predominantly within the ERGIC, represented by white areas in Figure 4 . GFP-N had primarily a cytosolic distribution but there were small areas of colocalization with FLAG-ORF 3 protein, within the ERGIC compartment. All experiments were done in Huh-7 cells supportive of hCoV-NL63 replication, but these same findings were also confirmed in another cell line, human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293T (data not shown).",

As expected, the M protein and a protein corresponding to ORF 3 protein migrated at corresponding heights in Western blots ( Figure 5A ). Both proteins showed additional bands at slightly higher molecular mass, consistent with posttranslational modification. In contrast to virus-infected cells, cells overexpressing ORF 3 protein from plasmid with an N-terminal FLAG epitope showed only a single band in Western blot whose migration was consistent with the hypothetical unglycosylated form ( Figure 5B, left panel) . It was assumed that glycosylation at the predicted N-glycosylation site at position 16 (Table 1 ) might be ablated in the overexpressed protein, due to presence of the N-terminal epitope tag. Indeed, recombinant ORF 3 (rORF 3) protein without any tag and overexpressed in the same cells from the same vector showed both forms, identical to those observed in virus-infected cells ( Figure 5B , right panel). To determine whether N-terminal glycosylation was to be expected at position 16, the membrane topology of the N-terminus was examined next.",

For confirmation, N-terminally FLAGtagged ORF 3 protein was overexpressed in HEK-293T cells and stained by IFA using monoclonal antibodies against the FLAG tag, or alternatively, a polyclonal antibody against a peptide representing the ORF 3 protein C-terminus. As shown in Figure 6 , a perinuclear distribution of fluorescence was observed with both antibodies in permeabilized cells. In non-permeabilized cells, only the anti-FLAG antibody yielded fluorescence at cell surfaces. Unfortunately, there was no complete overlap of signals from both antibodies in fully permeabilized cells in merged fluorescence pictures, most likely due to additional non-specific recognition of non-viral epitopes by the polyclonal antibody against the ORF 3 protein Cterminus. For this reason a clear intracellular localization of the C-terminus in relation to the ER/Golgi membrane could not be formally determined. However, it could be concluded that the N-terminus of the ORF 3 protein was facing towards the extracellular space.",
