            "text": "Study of the effect on shelter cat intakes and euthanasia from a shelter neuter return project of 10,080 cats from ABSTRACT Cat impoundments were increasing at the municipal San Jose animal shelter in 2009, despite long-term successful low cost sterilization programs and attempts to lower the euthanasia rate of treatable-rehabilitatable impounds beginning in 2008. San Jose Animal Care and Services implemented a new strategy designed to control overall feral cat reproduction by altering and returning feral cats entering the shelter system, rather than euthanizing the cats. The purpose of this case study was to determine how the program affected the shelter cat intakes over time. In just over four years, 10,080 individual healthy adult feral cats, out of 11,423 impounded at the shelter during this time frame, were altered and returned to their site of capture. Included in the 11,423 cats were 862 cats impounded from one to four additional times for a total of 958 (9.5%) recaptures of the previously altered 10,080 cats. The remaining 385 healthy feral cats were euthanized at the shelter from March 2010 to June 2014. Four years into the program, researchers observed cat and kitten impounds decreased 29.1%; euthanasia decreased from over 70% of intakes in 2009, to 23% in 2014. Euthanasia in the shelter for Upper Respiratory Disease decreased 99%; dead cat pick up off the streets declined 20%. Dog impounds did not similarly decline over the four years. No other laws or program changes were implemented since the beginning of the program.",

More than 70% of the adult cats entering the shelter were being euthanized. Local cat advocates discussed a program with the shelter manager, based on a 2008 Jacksonville, Florida, USA plan (Mitchell, 2008) , to alter all healthy feral cats impounded at the shelter, and then return the cats to their place of capture, rather than euthanize them as healthy but unadoptable. This was viewed as a controversial program, as some groups believe feral cats are killing too many birds (Loss, Will & Marra, 2013) , or live short, brutal lives (Jessup, 2004) . The program began as a pilot in March 2010. Initially the program was called Feral Freedom, and is now referred to as Shelter Neuter Return (SNR).",

            "text": "A follow up 1,000 household study of the pet population in 2005 found 93% of owned cats in Santa Clara County were reported by their owners to have had alteration surgery, rather than the prior 1993 rate of 86%. However, unowned but fed cats were reported altered by their caregivers at only a 5.5% rate. Further, in 1993, 16% of owned cats had a litter prior to being altered, while in 2005, less than 0.5% of owned cats were reported to have had a litter prior to being altered (Kass, Johnson & Weng, 2013) . The vast majority of owned cats are reported altered, yet many cats and kittens are still being impounded as free roaming stray cats at the local shelters and almost all of them are unaltered. In 2013, only 2% of cats were reclaimed by owners in San Jose (170 out of 8,643), suggesting a low level of ownership among the shelter population. It seems apparent that the only substantial cat population left to alter would be the feral population.",

Large volumes of cats in any shelter system elevate the risk of disease acquisition and transfer (Pedersen et al., 2004) . URI is one of the most prevalent cat health concerns facing shelter personnel. Feral and fractious cats experience extreme stress in the shelter environment, making all cats more susceptible to URI. \"Because of its close association with herpesviral activation and stress, URI is also a bellwether for overall shelter cat health and wellbeing\" (UC Davis).",
