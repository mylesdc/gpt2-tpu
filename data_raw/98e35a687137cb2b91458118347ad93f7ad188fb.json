The mAbs, two IgG1\u03ba and one IgG1\u03bb, were secreted by B-cell clones obtained from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of one person convalescent from acute hepatitis B and one vaccinated individual. The former recognized a denaturation-insensitive epitope within the p24 protein whereas the latter recognized a denaturation-sensitive, conformational epitope located within the HBsAg common \"a\" determinant. This mAb, denominated ADRI-2F3, displayed a very high protective titer of over 43,000 IU/mg mAb and showed an extremely potent neutralizing activity in the in vitro model of HBV infection using primary hepatocytes from Tupaia belangeri as target. Recombinant variable heavy and light domain sequences derived from mAb ADRI-2F3 were cloned into eukaryotic expression vectors and showed identical fine specificity and 1 log 10 higher titer than the original IgG1\u03bb. It is envisaged that such mAb will be able to efficiently prevent HBV reinfection after liver transplantation for end-stage chronic HBV infection or infection after needle-stick exposure, providing an unlimited source of valuable protective anti-HBs antibody.",

Transmission occurs via percutaneous and mucosal exposure to infectious body fluids. Therefore, the most common route of transmission is sexual transmission. However, infection through blood transfusions and blood products has not been completely eliminated [3] and contaminated injections during medical procedures, sharing of needles, syringes and paraphernalia among intravenous drug users still represent a major public health problem. Vertical transmission is common, especially in Asia, where HBV titers in maternal blood are high, and in developing countries which have not yet implemented hepatitis B vaccination. Further, HBV poses a risk to healthcare workers exposed to accidental needle-stick injuries.",

To determine whether infection of PTH by HBV could be prevented by human anti-HBs mAbs, HBV was preincubated with three different human mAbs ADRI-2F3, PK10C7, PK3D1, at dilutions ranging from 1:10 1 to 1:10 6 . The neutralization power of the human anti-HBs mAbs was directly compared with a well-characterized preS1-specific antibody (MA18/7) which was previously shown to exhibit significant neutralizing activity in PTH in vitro infection assay [15] .

All humAb IgG showed strong binding to HBsAg in ELISA (Fig 1A) . ADRI-2F3 secreted IgG1\u03bb, whereas PK10C7 and PK3D1 secreted IgG1\u03ba. Western blot analysis showed that PK10C7 and PK3D1 recognized a sequential, denaturation-insensitive epitope located within a band corresponding to the expected molecular weight (24 kDa) of the major S envelope protein [17] , whereas ADRI-2F3 did not bind to any protein band, indicating that it recognized a denaturation-sensitive conformational epitope (Fig 1B) . Competitive ELISA showed that ADRI-2F3 and its recombinant recADRI2F3 binding to HBsAg was almost completely inhibited by addition of murine mAb specific for the HBsAg common \"a\" determinant (Fig 1C & 1D) while PK10C7 and PK3D1 binding to HBsAg was not significantly affected by the same mAb (Fig 1D) mAb neutralizing activity This was analyzed for both ADRI-and PK-derived humAb using the neutralization assay described above. ADRI-2F3 supernatant showed strong neutralization activity up to 1:10,000 dilution. Since the specific IgG1\u03bb concentration in the supernatant was 27 \u03bcg/ml it can be extrapolated that ADRI-2F3 efficiently neutralized HBV at concentrations of at least 2.7 ng/ml (Fig 2) . Since the viral inoculum used for infection of PTH was 10 8 /ml it can be derived that no more than 2.7 ng/ml were sufficient to neutralize 10 8 HBV particles. PK humAb supernatant showed contrasting behaviors. Thus, PK10C7 did not neutralize infection of PTH while PK3D1 showed moderate neutralizing activity down to a dilution of 1:10 2 (about 200 ng/ml) which proved to be at least as good as the standard murine MA18/7 anti-pre-S1 mAb used as positive neutralization standard (1:100, corresponding to a concentration of 10 \u03bcg/ml) (Fig 2) .

The resulting VH and VL domains were sequenced (in sense and in antisense direction) of n = 20 VH and n = 20 VL cDNA clones of the 5 0 RACE reaction on RNA isolated from human B-cell clone ADRI-2F3 which yielded clear sequences for both the VH and the VL domains (n = 38 and 36 identical sequences, respectively). Few individual point mutations were detected in the sequence files of individual clones. These ambiguities were solitary occurrences in an otherwise unambiguous sequence alignment, most likely caused by erroneous insertion of bases during the polymerase chain reaction, or a bias in sequencing reactions. Sequencing was performed in opposite directions; i.e. two sequencing reactions were obtained per clone. Only full-length cDNAs with an obvious sequence were analyzed. Germline alignment allowed identification of complementarity determining regions (CDRs) which determine the specificity for HBsAg. VH and VL sequences from clone ADRI-2F3 are available as S1 Fig. Eukaryotic expression of ADRI-2F3 hIgG1\u03bb yielded a recombinant with specificity identical to the original clone As VH and VL sequences were all identical, representative VH and VL sequences were cloned in the eukaryotic expression vector described above. Recombinant ADRI-2F3 proved to be reactive towards its target antigen. Interestingly, the recombinant ADRI-2F3 spent culture supernatant displayed a reactivity of approximately one log 10 scale above the spent culture supernatant of the originating human B-cell clone, as detailed in Fig 3. Therefore this experiment conclusively showed that recombinant ADRI-2F3 could be cloned, produced, and reactivity towards its target antigen (HBsAg) could be validated by ELISA.",

Such a standardized reagent could also beneficially be used in other settings, such as in the acute treatment of accidental needle-sticks and in the prevention of vertical-perinatal HBV transmission. Administration of anti-HBs antibodies is usually performed as a prophylactic measure while waiting for the full development of vaccine-induced adaptive immunity to HBV. To this end, several mAb have been proposed and developed in order to address that need. Most mAb against HBV are of murine origin. Such murine antibodies have the inherent disadvantage that they evoke an immune reaction in a human recipient when used in a therapeutic or prophylactic composition. HumAb capable of neutralizing HBV infection have also been described. For instance two humAb termed HBV-17 and HBV-19, obtained from PBMC from HBV vaccinated individuals engrafted in the Trimera mouse model were described with a specific activity of 514 IU/mg and 2,900 IU/mg respectively [18] . Another series of humAb has been described by Tajiri et al., [19] . These humAb were derived from human VH/VL chain fragments from B cells of vaccinated persons and cloned in a vector. However, they did not seem to provide full protection against HBV infection in vitro, even not at the highest concentrations tested providing still residual activity after neutralization of HBV with each of the humAb tested. Another humAb HB-C7A has been described by Shin et al. which was able of fully preventing HBV infection in two chimpanzees after mixing 100 CID50 of HBV and 100 \u03bcg of HB-C7A [20] [21] . The humAb was constructed from a phage-displayed Ab library and converted into a human IgG1. It has been reported to have a titer of 2,600 IU/mg.",

This problem can by and large be overcome by maintaining a high titer of neutralizing antibody and this can be achieved with a potent mAb such as the one described herein. The problem may be circumvented by preparing pools of mAbs, although this would be extremely difficult to achieve working with human mAbs since the common \"a\" determinant is a dominant epitope which tends to monopolize the specificity of immune responses to a complex protein. Indeed, the \"original antigenic sin\", first described in 1953 [24] , is the phenomenon in which sequential exposure to viral variants induces preferential antibody response to a dominant virus strain encountered in the past.
