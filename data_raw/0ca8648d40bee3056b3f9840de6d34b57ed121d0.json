            "text": "Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), a member of the Birnaviridae family, is a major avian pathogen responsible for an immunosuppressive disease affecting juvenile chickens. The IBDV genome is formed by two dsRNA segments. The largest one harbors two partially overlapping open reading frames encoding a non-structural polypeptide, known as VP5, and a large polyprotein, respectively. VP5 is non-essential for virus replication. However, it plays a major role in IBDV pathogenesis. VP5 accumulates at the plasma membrane (PM) of IBDV-infected cells. We have analyzed the mechanism underlying the VP5 PM targeting. Updated topological prediction algorithm servers fail to identify a transmembrane domain within the VP5 sequence. However, the VP5 polycationic C-terminal region, harboring three closely spaced patches formed by two or three consecutive basic amino acid residues (lysine or arginine), might account for its PM tropism. We have found that mutations, either C-terminal VP5 deletions or replacement of basic amino acids by alanine residues, that reduce the electropositive charge of the VP5 C-terminus abolish PM targeting. Lipid overlay assays performed with an affinity-purified Flag-tagged VP5 (FVP5) protein version show that this polypeptide binds several phosphoinositides (PIP), exhibiting a clear preference for monophosphate species. Experiments performed with FVP5 mutant proteins lacking the polycationic domain demonstrate that this region is essential for PIP binding. Data gathered with IBDV mutants expressing C-terminal deleted VP5 polypeptides generated by reverse genetics demonstrate that the VP5-PIP binding domain is required both for its PM targeting in infected cells, and for efficient virus dissemination. Data presented here lead us to hypothesize that IBDV might use a non-lytic VP5-dependent cell-to-cell spreading mechanism.",

The VP5 ORF overlaps the 5 0 end region of the polyprotein ORF, thus transcription of this segment results in the synthesis of bicistronic mRNA molecules. The mechanism(s) regulating the translation of both ORFs remains uncharacterized. Bioinformatics analyses indicate that the VP5 ORF originated by gene overprinting on an ancestral polyprotein gene [3] . The presence of VP5 orthologs only in genomes from viruses belonging to two, i.e. avibirnavirus and aquabirnavirus, of the four birnavirus genera suggests that this ORF was generated late during birnavirus evolution.",

Despite the enormous amount of work devoted to unravel molecular basis underlying IBDV pathogenesis our understanding about this critical issue is as yet scarce [11] . The IBDV protein arsenal is quite narrow, encompassing only five mature polypeptides (VP1-5). Although much effort has been focused on the characterization of structural polypeptides (VP1-3) and the virus-encoded protease (VP4), structural and functional data concerning VP5 is comparatively scarce. Indeed, an in depth knowledge about VP5 might provide new clues for the understanding of IBDVhost interactions.",

We have experimentally examined the mechanism underlying the interaction of this polypeptide with the PM. Data presented in this report show that the polycationic VP5 C-terminal tail is essential for the PM targeting of this polypeptide. Additionally, we demonstrate that VP5 specifically binds different phosphoinositide (PIP) species, and that this interaction is mediated by its electropositive C-terminal tail.

FVP5 sequences including the following amino acid substitutions: A 394 !G, A 395 !C, C 397 !G, G 398 !C and G 399 !T for FVP5M2; A 406 !G, A 407 !C, C 409 !G, G 410 !C, C 411 !T, C 412 !G and G 413 !C for FVP5M3; A 424 !G, G 425 !C, G 426 !A, A 427 !G and A 428 !C for FVP5M4; and all the previous substitutions for FVP5M1. All plasmids were subjected to nucleotide sequencing to assess the accuracy of inserted sequences, and then used to generate the following recombinant VACVs: VT7/FVP5, VT7/FVP5\u03945, VT7/FVP5\u039410, VT7/FVP5\u039415, VT7/FVP5M1, VT7/ FVP5M2, VT7/FVP5M3, and VT7/FVP5M4, respectively. Generation of recombinant VACVs was performed by infecting BSC40 cells with the VT7LacOI virus [15] , followed by transfection with the corresponding pVOTE.2 plasmid derivatives. Selection and amplification of recombinant VACVs were carried out as described [15] .",

Provided that was the case, the reduction of the net charge of the VP5 Cterminal tail should significantly affect PM targeting. To test this hypothesis, four Flag-tagged VP5 mutant versions, in which cationic clusters were selectively replaced by non-polar alanine (A) residues, were engineered. A diagram depicting the configuration of the C-terminal tails of the different mutants is shown in Fig 4A. The FVP5CTM1 recombinant gene lacks the three cationic clusters. The FVP5CTM2, FVP5CTM3, and FVP5CTM4 polypeptides lack the 132 KR 133 , the 136 KRR 138 or the 142 RK 143 cluster, respectively. The described constructs were used to generate inducible recombinant VACVs. The resulting viruses were employed to infect HeLa cells. The electrophoretic mobility and the subcellular distribution of the different FVP5 mutant versions were analyzed by Western blot and CLSM analysis. VT7/FVP5, expressing the full length Flag-tagged VP5 protein was used as a control for these experiments.",

Accordingly, this protein region is henceforth described as the VP5 PIP-binding domain. Array strips spotted with decreasing lipid amounts (100-6.25 pmol/spot) were used to comparatively assess the affinity of the protein for different PIPs. As shown in Fig 5C, VP5 exhibited a similar affinity for the three monophosphate PIP species, giving a significant signal with spots containing 12.5 pmols of these lipids. Significant binding to PI(3,5P) 2 , PI(4,5)P 2 , or PI (3,4,5)P 3 was only found at higher (25 pmols/spot) lipid concentrations. The interaction with either PI(3,4)P 2 or PI was negligible.

Indeed, data obtained from recombinant expression systems should be treated with some caution. It was therefore important to investigate the effect of mutations affecting the PIP-binding domain within the context of the IBDV infection. To perform this analysis, three IBDV mutants, namely IBDV_VP5\u03943CT, IBDV_VP5\u039410CT, and IBDV_VP5\u039414CT, expressing truncated versions of the VP5 polypeptides lacking 3, 10, and 14 VP5 C-terminal residues, respectively, were generated by reverse genetics (Fig 6A) . The segment A of these three viruses contain a single nucleotide substitution A 489 !U, A 501 !U or A 522 !U, respectively, that convert the \"AAA\" codons coding for VP5 K 132 and K 136 , or the \"AAG\" codon coding for K 142 , into \"UAA\" or \"UAG\" translation termination codons. Noteworthy, these substitutions result in the introduction of synonymous mutations within the overlapping ORF, thus not altering the amino acid sequence of the virus polyprotein. Two additional viruses, i.e. wild type IBDV (IBDV_WT), expressing an unmodified VP5 version of the IBDV Soroa strain (WT), and IBDV VP5 knockout (IBDV_VP5 KO), were also generated by reverse genetics and used as controls for subsequent experiments. IBDV_VP5 KO contains a single nucleotide substitution, i.e. segment A: G 98 !A, converting the VP5 \"AUG\" translation initiation codon into an \"AUA\" triplet, thus abolishing VP5 expression [8] . A diagram depicting the configuration of the C-terminal tails of the different mutants is shown in Fig 6A. The described viruses were used to infect monolayers of DF1 cells at a multiplicity of infection of 3 plaque forming units/cell. At 24 h p.i., cultures were either harvested to assess the expression of the VP5 and VP3 IBDV-encoded proteins by Western blot or processed for IF using anti-VP5 serum.",

Thus, in order to analyze the effect of the described VP5 C-terminal deletions on the ability of the virus to disseminate from cell-to-cell, we compared the plaque size phenotype of the different mutant viruses to that of the wild type and VP5 knockout viruses. For this, QM7 monolayers grown in 6-well culture plates were infected with serial dilutions of stocks corresponding to IBDV_WT, _VP5 KO, _VP5\u03943CT, _VP5\u039410CT, and _VP5\u039414CT viruses described above. After infection, monolayers were washed twice with PBS and then covered with DMEM supplemented with 0,75% agarose and 2% FCS.

Indeed, electrostatic interactions between anionic lipids and surface exposed polycationic protein domains play a key role on the targeting of many proteins to the plasmalemma [24] . The presence of three positively charged clusters, 132 KR 133 , 136 KRR 138 and 142 RK 143 , within the C-terminal VP5 tail suggested that this region might be important for the interaction of this protein with the PM. Experiments performed with GFP/ CT122-145, a GFP C-terminal fusion containing the 24 C-terminal VP5 residues, show that this region is sufficient to target GFP to the PM. Additionally, data gathered with recombinant Flag-tagged VP5 versions, harboring C-terminal deletions or amino acid substitutions, evidenced that the reduction of the net electropositive charge of the C-terminal domain either weaken or abolish the interaction of the protein with the PM. Identical effects were observed in cells infected with IBDV VP5 C-terminal ablation mutants generated by reverse genetics. Taken together these data demonstrates that the C-terminal domain is essential for the PM tropism of this protein, thus ruling out our previous hypothesis that VP5 might behave as a class II transmembrane polypeptide.",

Interestingly, this mutation lies within the first electropositive patch of the polycationic domain. Indeed, the After infection, monolayers were covered with semisolid medium. After three days, the medium was removed and virus-induced plaques were detected by immunostaining using serum specifically recognizing the VP2 IBDV capsid polypeptide. B. Statistical analysis. The statistical analysis was carried on images from immnunostained monolayers using the GraphPad Prism software 4.0. A Kruskal-Wallis test was performed followed by Dunn's multiple comparison tests between lysis plaque areas detected in monolayers infected with the different mutant viruses and those generated by the wild type virus. Presented data correspond to three independent experiments totalizing 750 plaques for each virus. Significant differences (p<0.001) between KO, \u039410CT, \u039414CT and WT viruses are indicated with asterisks (***). C. Extracellular virus yields.
