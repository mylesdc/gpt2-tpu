            "text": "Endoribonucleases participate in almost every step of eukaryotic RNA metabolism, acting either as degradative or biosynthetic enzymes. We previously identified the founding member of the Eukaryotic EndoU ribonuclease family, whose components display unique biochemical features and are flexibly involved in important biological processes, such as ribosome biogenesis, tumorigenesis and viral replication. Here we report the discovery of the CG3303 gene product, which we named DendoU, as a novel family member in Drosophila. Functional characterisation revealed that DendoU is essential for Drosophila viability and nervous system activity. Pan-neuronal silencing of dendoU resulted in fly immature phenotypes, highly reduced lifespan and dramatic motor performance defects. Neuronsubtype selective silencing showed that DendoU is particularly important in cholinergic circuits. At the molecular level, we unveiled that DendoU is a positive regulator of the neurodegenerationassociated protein dTDP-43, whose downregulation recapitulates the ensemble of dendoU-dependent phenotypes. This interdisciplinary work, which comprehends in silico, in vitro and in vivo studies, unveils a relevant role for DendoU in Drosophila nervous system physio-pathology and highlights that DendoUmediated neurotoxicity is, at least in part, contributed by dTDP-43 loss-of-function.",

XendoU is an endoribonuclease involved in the biogenesis of small nucleolar RNAs, which participate in ribosome function 4,5 . Three-dimensional structure determination revealed that XendoU had a novel fold 3 , which led it to be defined the founding member of the Eukaryotic EndoU ribonuclease family by the Structure Classification of Proteins Database (SCOP) 6 . We later characterised another member of the same family, closely related to XendoU, namely human Placental Protein 11 (PP11) 7 , which is highly tissue-specific and represents a tumour-marker in several cancers. Proteins distantly related to XendoU family members are encoded by viruses. They represent genetic markers of nidoviruses 8 , which are responsible for human respiratory diseases, and the Nsp15 prototype is essential in the viral replication cycle 9,10 . Eukaryotic and viral endoribonucleases share a unique combination of biochemical features: Mn 2+ -dependent enzymatic activity, uridylates specificity, and release of products with 2\u2032 , 3\u2032 -cyclic phosphate termini 1,7 .",

Sequence comparison detected the two protein products encoded by CG2145 and CG3303 genes as XendoU homologs. Deep biochemical analyses revealed that CG3303 product alone shares the aforementioned biochemical features. We named this protein, which is annotated by the major databases as serine protease, DendoU (Drosophila endoribonuclease U-specific). By exploiting the powerful reverse-genetics tools of the fruit fly model system, we investigated DendoU in vivo activity. The protein was found to be essential for Drosophila viability and crucial for neuronal activity. Depletion in the nervous system resulted in severe abnormalities such as immature phenotypes, highly reduced lifespan and impaired locomotion behaviour. These phenotypes overlap with those caused by loss-and gain-of-function of the neurodegeneration-associated protein dTDP-43, which we revealed to be regulated by DendoU.",

The C-terminal regions, instead, have similar length (281 and 276 amino acids, respectively) and high sequence identity (41%). The multiple sequence alignment of CG3303 and CG2145 with XendoU and human PP11 homologues, shown in Fig. 1b , highlighted that the 1-250 region of XendoU, comprising most of the residues previously reported to be involved in catalytic activity 2 , was well conserved in both Drosophila isoforms and PP11. Conversely, the 251-292 region is more variable in both length and sequence. This region contains several residues, including N270, H272, G277, T278 and Y280, involved in binding the RNA substrate based on the experimentally determined XendoU structure 3 . The high sequence variability in this region indicates that the mode of RNA substrate binding is likely to be different between the two Drosophila proteins.",

Sequence numbering indicates starting and ending residues of XendoU and the CG2145 and CG3303 regions homologous to XendoU (see panel b). These regions comprise a highly conserved segment (EndoU-like, white boxes) and a variable segment (striped boxes).

The N-terminal region of CG2145 is significantly longer and comprises a signal peptide (black box), a long disordered and prolinerich region (gray box), and a short glycine-rich segment (light gray box). The N-terminal region of CG3303 comprises a disordered segment (dotted box) and a predicted trans-membrane region (horizontally-striped box).

Moreover, adult flies displayed several abnormalities (Fig. 4c) . They appeared as immature animals bearing unexpanded wings, soft cuticle, unretracted ptilinum, dimpled dorsal thorax, and misoriented scutellar bristles. Remarkably, immature-looking flies also showed severe locomotor defects and marked uncoordination. Compared to control flies (Supplementary video 2), pan-neuronal interfered flies were quite unable to walk or stay upright, and usually became stuck in the culture medium immediately after eclosion. Impaired body posture and overall weakness were so severe that standard climbing assay could not be performed. Therefore, locomotor activity of these flies was assessed by evaluating voluntary locomotion on a horizontal surface (Supplementary video 3). As shown in the video, walking assays revealed substantial impairment of motor capacities. Flies were unable to move and promptly restore themselves to an upright position after being knocked down to the bottom of a dish by gentle agitation. The same immature phenotype and locomotor defects were observed in an independent RNAi line, upon exclusion of any off-target effect ( Supplementary Fig. 4a ,b and Supplementary video 4).",

We used choline acetyltransferase (Cha) promoter-driven GAL4, which is expressed in both central and sensory cholinergic neurons. DendoU downregulation resulted in the same immature phenotypes observed in pan-neuronal knockdown ( Fig. 5a and Supplementary Table 2 ). This result indicates that dendoU-linked immature phenotype can be, at least partially, ascribed to cholinergic DendoU function. DendoU silencing in cholinergic neurons also produces relevant effects on median lifespan, with 75% decrease (31.06 \u00b1 0.37 days for control flies vs 7.57 \u00b1 0.18 days for cha-G4 > dendoU RNAi ) ( Fig. 5b and Supplementary Table 2) , and locomotion, with 70% reduction (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Table 2 ). To verify whether DendoU effect on locomotion is cell-autonomous, functional inactivation of dendoU in motor neurons was performed by the specific D42-GAL4 driver. Climbing assays showed 25% decrease of performance index (Fig. 5d and Supplementary Table 2) , indicating the involvement of DendoU in motor neuron activity. Moreover, dendoU silencing in motor neurons caused a low frequency of altered phenotypes, i.e. 3% of immature phenotype and 7% of mild immature phenotypes (unexpanded wings), and 30% decrease of median lifespan (31.38 \u00b1 0.26 days for control flies vs 21.53 \u00b1 0.50 days for D42-G4 > dendoU RNAi flies) (Fig. 5e and Supplementary Table 2 ).",

However, deep biochemical characterization revealed distinct features in sequence-specificity and cleavage chemistry. This suggests that they recognize and/or cleave different RNA substrates and act through different catalytic mechanisms in vivo. On this basis, we propose to include only DendoU, which was annotated in databases as putative serine-protease, in the aforementioned family. These findings underline the relevance of combining biochemical and sequence/structure analyses to elucidate protein function. Taking advantage of Drosophila in vivo model system to investigate the contribution of target genes to biological processes, we demonstrated that DendoU is essential for fly viability whereas CG2145 is not. Indeed, DendoU systemic silencing resulted in pupal lethality, indicating that in vivo activity of DendoU is not redundant.",

            "text": "We unveiled a crucial role for DendoU in Drosophila nervous system physiology and pathology. Remarkably, some of the phenotypes determined by dendoU pan-neuronal silencing, i.e., pupal lethality, strongly reduced fly lifespan, juvenile phenotypes and severely impaired locomotion, overlap with those caused by dTDP-43 deregulation 17 . TDP-43 is an evolutionary conserved RNA/DNA binding protein, considered to be a neuronal activity-responsive factor and neurodegeneration hallmark 21, 22 . As shown in different model systems, TDP-43 cellular levels must be exquisitely regulated since even subtle alterations result in neurotoxicity 23, 24 . We demonstrate, through two independent RNAi lines, that dendoU knockdown causes an about 35% decrease of dTDP-43 protein, indicating that one relevant function of DendoU in Drosophila nervous system is to contribute to the control of dTDP-43 levels. These data suggest that DendoU-linked phenotypes are at least in part mediated by dTDP-43 loss-of-function. The involvement of other genes is expected in light of the more severe phenotype observed in dendoU RNAi flies compared to dTDP-43 RNAi . Moreover, since dTDP-43 mRNA is not a direct DendoU substrate, dTDP-43 regulation must be mediated by still unknown DendoU targets. Ongoing transcriptomics analysis aims at identifying DendoU target genes responsible for the regulation of i) dTDP-43 dependent circuit; ii) other molecular pathways underlying the observed dramatic phenotypes. Inside the nervous system, DendoU contribution is not restricted to individual neuronal sub-types but extended to complex neuronal networks, largely dependent on cholinergic neurons. Indeed, dendoU depletion in this neuronal subclass recapitulates the pan-neuronal phenotypes indicating a defect in excitatory inputs to CCAP/bursicon and motor neurons. This is in line with the already demonstrated defects in synaptic efficacy caused by deregulation of dTDP-43 20 .",

            "text": "Expression profile and western blot analyses. mRNA and protein levels were determined by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and semi-quantitative PCR analysis (RT-PCR) or by Western blot assay, respectively. For qRT-PCR, RNA extracted from specific samples (developmental stages or tissues) by Qiazol reagent (Qiagen) was used to generate cDNA using SuperScriptTM III First-Strand Synthesis SuperMix (Invitrogen). The qRT-PCR was performed using QuantiFast SYBR Green PCR Kit (Qiagen) or miScript SYBR-Green PCR Kit (Qiagen) through a 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR (Applied Biosystem), using the oligonucletides listed below. The reaction mixtures were kept at 95 \u00b0C for 15 min, followed by 40 cycles at 95 \u00b0C for 15 s and 60 \u00b0C for 1 min. Fluorescence output results were captured and analyzed using 7300 System SDS v1.4 Software (Applied Biosystems), and the threshold cycle (Ct) was used for assessing relative levels of target transcripts versus rp49 transcripts. For RT-PCR, amplicons were fractionated along a 2% agarose gel and revealed by ChemiDoc XRS + Molecular Imager (Bio-Rad). Gapdh mRNA was used as loading control. ImageJ was used for intensity band quantification. For protein level determination, Western blots were carried out using custom antibodies against CG2145 (PRIMM) (1:1000) and dTDP-43 18 (1:1000), or antibodies against Giotto (provided by G. Cestra) (1:5000). Walking, climbing and survival assays. The assays were performed according to earlier established protocol 18 . For the walking assay, we examined the behaviour of freely walking upright adult flies on a flat horizontal surface. Newly eclosed female and males were transferred in batches of 15 to fresh vials and aged for 3-4 days. The flies were transferred, without anaesthesia, to the centre of 200 mm Petri dish to allow for video recordings using a Nikon D5000 mounted on a WILD M3B (Wild Heerbrugg) stereomicroscope. For the climbing assay we used an apparatus consisting of two empty polystyrene vials vertically joined by tape facing each other. For the lower vial, a vertical distance of 8 cm above the bottom surface was measured and marked by drawing a circle around the entire circumference of the vial. For the climbing assay, a group of 10 male flies were transferred into the lower vial and allowed to acclimatize to the new setting for 1 minute. The climbing assay involved gently tapping the flies down to the bottom of the vial and measuring the number of flies per group that can climb above the 8 cm mark by 15 seconds after the tap, recorded as the percentage success rate. Nine trials were performed for each group and n \u2265 100 flies were assayed for each genotype. Experiments were performed during daylight to minimize potential effects of circadian oscillation. All average data are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM and compared with 2-tailed unpaired t-tests. Statistical tests were performed using Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc.). For survival assay, homozygous virgins bearing GAL4 were crossed to homozygous UAS-dendoU RNAi transgene and Scientific RepoRts | 7:41559 | DOI: 10.1038/srep41559 control Ore-R males. The progeny from these crosses were maintained on standard cornmeal-sucrose-yeast-agar diet at 29 \u00b0C. Every 2-3 days, flies were passed into new vials and dead flies were counted. The survival rate was calculated by the percentage of total flies surviving. Survival curves were analysed by the log-rank method using GraphPad Prism (n \u2265 500 flies for all genotypes except for D42-G4 > dendoU RNAi (n \u2265 200)).",
