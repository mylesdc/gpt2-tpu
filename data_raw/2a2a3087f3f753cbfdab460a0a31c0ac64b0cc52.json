            "text": "Many economically important cattle diseases spread between herds through livestock movements. Traditionally, most transmission models have assumed that all purchased cattle carry the same risk of generating outbreaks in the destination herd. Using data on bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) in Scotland as a case example, this study provides empirical and theoretical evidence that the risk of disease transmission varies substantially based on the animal and herd demographic characteristics at the time of purchase. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that purchasing pregnant heifers and open cows sold with a calf at foot were associated with an increased risk of beef herds being seropositive for BVDV. Based on the results from a dynamic within-herd simulation model, these findings may be partly explained by the age-related probability of animals being persistently infected with BVDV as well as the herd demographic structure at the time of animal introductions. There was also evidence that an epidemiologically important network statistic, \"betweenness centrality\" (a measure frequently associated with the potential for herds to acquire and transmit disease), was significantly higher for herds that supplied these particular types of replacement beef cattle. The trends for dairy herds were not as clear, although there was some evidence that open heifers and open lactating cows were associated with an increased risk of BVDV. Overall, these findings have important implications for developing simulation models that more accurately reflect the industry-level transmission dynamics of infectious cattle diseases.",

As such, researchers are continually developing more sophisticated epidemiological models to better understand how disease control resources can be applied more cost-effectively across the large population of cattle herds [2] [3] [4] . Cattle movements have received particular attention in recent years both because of their central role in the epidemiology of many economically important cattle diseases [5] [6] [7] and because the movements of individual cattle have been explicitly recorded in databases across the European Union since 1998 [8] . The latter has provided researchers with an unprecedented opportunity to study the dynamics of directly transmissible infectious diseases. Using network analysis based approaches, it has been consistently shown that targeting control measures at the small number of herds or movements that are highly connected in the trade network can lead to significantly greater reductions in disease prevalence than targeting the same number of herds or movements at random [9] [10] [11] [12] .",

As numerous empirical studies have shown, the probability of any individual animal being infected or transmitting disease to susceptible cattle is strongly influenced by factors such as age, production type, and on-farm management practices [13] [14] [15] [16] . For example, contagious mastitis pathogens are highly unlikely to spread through the movements of male cattle or store calves purchased for fattening, whereas older lactating dams are predicted to have a significantly increased risk based on the higher prevalence of disease and greater opportunity to spread disease through contaminated milking equipment [17, 18] . Identifying cattle movements that are associated with the greatest risk of infectious disease transmission has important implications for refining future epidemiological models and disease control strategies. In this analysis, we use data on bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) in Scotland as a case example to illustrate that not all cows in the movement network are epidemiologically equal.",

During acute outbreaks, cattle infected with BVDV may exhibit nonspecific clinical signs of depression, inappetence, fever, and diarrhoea leading to transient declines in milk production, growth performance, and animal fertility [22] . More serious complications arise when BVDV crosses the placental barrier in pregnant cattle. Foetal infections have been associated with early embryonic death, abortions, stillbirths, congenital abnormalities, and the development of persistent infections in calves that gain immunotolerance to BVDV through vertical transmission of the virus during early gestation [23] . Persistently infected (PI) calves shed large quantities of virus for life and are primarily responsible for sustaining disease transmission at the population level [24] . Due to underlying immunosuppression and the development of fatal mucosal disease, few PI cattle survive beyond three years of age [25, 26] . However, those that appear clinically normal are at risk of being sold to other herds as store cattle or breeding replacements leading to the exposure of pregnant dams in the gestational risk period for generating additional PI calves [27] [28] [29] .",

While most published studies agree that maintaining an open breeding herd is the primary risk factor for disease introductions [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] , there are likely specific cohorts of purchased cattle that are at increased risk of generating outbreaks in the destination herd. For example, the probability that any given batch of purchased cattle will contain at least one PI animal is expected to decrease with age given the higher observed mortality rates amongst PI calves [25, 36] . However, older animals purchased as replacement breeding cattle have a greater probability of being directly comingled with susceptible breeding dams than animals purchased as yearling heifers. Seropositive dams that are pregnant at the time of purchase carry the additional risk of introducing BVDV through the birth of PI calves [37] , particularly since there are few reliable prenatal tests to determine the BVDV status of the foetus [38] [39] [40] .",

For each herd, the total number of cattle purchased in the two year period prior to serological sampling was recorded. The two year time window was selected because of the uncertainty in when BVDV may have been introduced to the herd. A series of six binary categorical variables were created representing each of replacement breeding cattle types (open heifer, pregnant heifer, open cow (dry), open cow (lactating), pregnant cow (dry) and pregnant cow (lactating)). The levels of the variables were \"None purchased\" and \"At least one purchased\". Herds that purchased no cattle in the 2 year period prior to sampling were considered closed herds. The odds of a closed herd being seropositive for BVDV were initially calculated and the remaining analyses then Preliminary univariate screens were performed to select variables for inclusion in the final multivariate logistic regression models. All six movement variables were associated with BVDV seropositivity at a p-value < 0.20 and were therefore retained. Thereafter, components of the final multivariate models were determined by a backwards stepwise elimination process in which variables with the highest p-values were sequentially dropped from the model until all the remaining variables had a p-value < 0.05. Forwards stepwise selection was then performed adding in each of the eliminated variables in turn and checking for p-values of < 0.05 to ensure that no variables were excluded based on the order of elimination.",

Betweenness centrality measures the number of times the shortest paths between any two farms in the network pass through a particular farm [55] . In previous theoretical simulation studies, it has been shown that farms with high betweenness centrality scores have a statistically higher probability of acquiring disease and spreading disease due to their connectivity with other farms in the network [10, 56] . We would therefore expect that cattle purchased from herds with a high betweenness centrality to have an increased risk of being positive for BVDV.",

For beef herds, pregnant heifers and open cows with a calf at foot were identified as high risk groups in the multivariable model, while for dairy herds, open heifers appeared to have the greatest risk. These results are in accordance with anecdotal evidence from throughout the world (Gunn, G.J. pers. comm. 2014) and therefore provide valuable empirical evidence in their favour. While it is possible that these findings may simply be an artefact of the small sample size or may simply be proxies for other management practices associated with BVDV transmission, results from the within-herd simulation model and the network characterizations provide additional theoretical support to explain the differences in predicted risk.",

To our knowledge, only one other published study to date has used CTS records in this manner [13] and this represents a significant advance in developing more realistic models of BVDV transmission dynamics.

            "text": "Pregnant replacement breeding cattle are a known epidemiological control challenge for beef herds since there are few reliable prenatal diagnostic tests to identify animals carrying a PI calf [38] [39] [40] and once born, the calves mix directly with susceptible breeding dams until weaning at approximately 6 to 8 months of age. Given that the majority of farmers in Scotland do not routinely screen cattle at the time of purchase [59] , it is unlikely that calves are tested after birth to identify and remove PIs [60, 61] . Similar concerns are present for dams that are purchased with a calf at foot, especially if they are introduced to the herd at the start of the breeding season when a large number of dams are in the gestational risk period for generating PI calves. We would expect that older dams are less likely to be PI and more likely to be immune from previous exposure, which may partly explain why the purchase of pregnant cows with a calf at foot was not a significant risk factor for seropositivity in beef herds. Interestingly, the purchase of any type of pregnant cattle was not a significant risk factor for BVDV seropositivity in dairy herds. One possible explanation is that dairy calves are removed from their dams within 24 h of birth and either sold directly to fattening units for beef production or raised in separate production units on the farm. Therefore, even if a pregnant replacement dam gives birth to a PI calf, there are fewer opportunities for disease to spread to susceptible breeding cattle. There may also be underlying differences in the management practices and within-herd transmission dynamics of source herds supplying pregnant replacement dairy cattle that reduce the risk of these animals carrying PI calves. In contrast, the purchase of open heifers and open breeding cattle in general was a significant risk factor for seropositivity in dairy herds, but not for beef herds. One possible explanation is that beef heifers were purchased at a much younger age than dairy heifers and under certain circumstances, it has been shown that exposing susceptible heifers to PI cattle can be beneficial in inducing protective immunity to prevent future transient BVDV infections during early gestation [52] . Most open dairy heifers were introduced to the herd closer to the average age at first calving for the dairy industry and may have been more likely to be commingled with susceptible breeding cattle. Based on findings from the within-herd simulation model, there are also likely differences in the herd demographic structure (i.e. percentage of dams in the gestational risk period for generating PI calves) at the time when these particular types of replacement breeding cattle were introduced that influence the risk of BVDV subsequently spreading through the herd. A previous investigation into the management practices of the herds examined in our study showed significant differences in the basic level of biosecurity that beef and dairy herds adopted for purchased cattle [59] . However, the survey questions were simple binary response variables and it was not possible to assess whether the biosecurity measures were applied differently across the various types of replacement breeding cattle. This highlights the need for more basic research into understanding how these heterogeneities in herd management impact the both the within-herd and between-herd transmission dynamics of infectious cattle diseases.",

Herds that sold pregnant replacement beef heifers and open beef cows with a calf at foot had higher median betweenness centrality scores than herds that sold other types of cattle, which may indicate an increased likelihood that they were infected with BVDV. In short it is possible that it is not the type of replacement animal per se that matters, but could be the connectedness of herds to others that tend to transfer that particular type of animal. A recent study from Sweden found that herds with large ingoing infection chains (another measure which accounts for both the number and connectivity of source herds for purchased cattle) were significantly more likely to be seropositive for bovine coronavirus and bovine respiratory syncytial virus than more isolated herds [66] . With the limitations of the small study sample, it was not possible to investigate whether herds that sold replacement breeding cattle were more likely to be seropositive for BVDV and whether placing increased biosecurity restrictions on herds that sell replacement breeding cattle would be a more cost-effective control strategy. These questions may be answered in the near future as more comprehensive surveillance data from the recently launched Scottish BVD Eradication Scheme becomes available [67] . We also did not assess the potential for BVDV to spread between cattle at livestock market sales, which may be another important mechanism of disease transmission in the Scottish cattle industry.",

This applies to the testing for BVDV antibodies in bulk milk and interpretation of the test is made more confused by the fact that currently most dairy herds in Scotland buy in replacement heifers. Such factors probably explain our observation that the trends in movement and network risks associated with purchased replacement breeding cattle were less clear for dairy herds than for beef herds [68, 69] . Although we intentionally excluded herds that reported using BVDV vaccines, we recognize that the simple question of \"Do you routinely vaccinate your herd for BVD?\" does not allow for variation in the number of cattle vaccinated, the use of different vaccination strategies for different management groups, and the past use of vaccinations in the breeding herd, all of which may result in the presence of antibody positive cattle in the absence of an active BVDV infection. In a previously published analysis of these data [59] , we also found evidence that local transmission mechanisms may be relatively more important for dairy herds than for beef herds, which may further weaken the associations between recent cattle movements and BVDV seropositivity in dairy herds.",

This may have underestimated the number of herds that purchased replacement breeding cattle as well as the potential risk associated with purchasing open heifers. Additional bias may have been introduced to the empirical risk factor analysis through the exclusion of farms that could be linked to a valid CPH code through their reported address.
