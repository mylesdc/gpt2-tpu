We identified two peptides (amino acid residues K 93 FITSRCRL and F 57 GYMTFVHF) as CD8 + cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes. These peptides elicited significant numbers of IFN-\u03b3 secreting cells, compared with other M nonapeptides and one irrelevant nonapeptide. Bioinformatics analysis showed that the former is an H-2K d -restricted CTL epitope, and the latter is an H-2D d -restricted CTL epitope. Multiple amino acid sequence alignment among different PRRSV M sequences submitted to GenBank indicated that these two CTL epitopes are strongly conserved, and they should therefore be considered for further research on the mechanisms of cellular immune responses to PRRSV.",

Characterization of field isolates suggested that PRRSV are genetically diverse, and this genetic variation increases the difficulty of developing effective vaccines. Based on significant sequence differencesPRRS viruses are grouped into two distinct genotypes, European isolate (Lelystad virus, LV) and North American isolate (VR-2332) [1] PRRSV has two major structural proteins, GP5 and M, encoded by ORFs 5 and 6, respectively. GP5, the most important neutralizing antigen of PRRSV, has the highest genetic diversity among isolates [2] . And, recent studies in Yorkshire \u00d7 Landrace crossed and outbred pigs, showed that there are two immuno-dominant T-cell epitopes derived from the GP5 protein: L 117 AALICFVIRLAKNC and K 149 GRLYRWRSPVII/VEK [3] . The M protein, which contains highly conserved amino acid sequences, also has very good immunogenicity and is associated with protection against PRRSV infection. DNA vaccinations have also revealed that M is the most potent inducer of T lymphocyte proliferation [4] .",

Vaccines based on inactivated PRRSV virus have been ineffective at inducing protective immune responses. Live-attenuated PRRSV vaccines can provide protection against this pathogen, but have been observed to revert to virulence [5] , restricting the application of this vaccination approach. The rational development of future PRRSV vaccines will necessitate a systematic understanding of the protective humoral and cellular immune responses that occur during PRRSV infection, and should aim to induce a broad immune responses that accommodates the plasticity of the major antigenic sites. Recent research has indicated that cell-mediated immunity may play a very important role in the clearance of PRRSV [6] . Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) can kill virus-infected cells and eliminate potential sources of new virus [7] . Hence, identification of CTL epitopes is crucial in the design of synthetic vaccines, and a number of studies have successfully identified pathogen-derived T cell epitopes [8] [9] [10] [11] .",

A subsequent booster vaccination with the recombinant vaccinia virus, rWR-PRRSV-M, elicited a further increase in PRRSV-specific antibody (P < 0.01, Additional file 5, Fig. S5 ). In contrast, control mice vaccinated with pVAX1-only or PBS-only did not show significant increases in M protein-specific antibody titers after the booster vaccination with rWR-PRRSV-M (P > 0.05, Additional file 5, Fig. S5 ). Overall, mice vaccinated with pVAX1-Ub-M generated significantly higher M protein-specific antibody titers compared to mice vaccinated with pVAX1 or PBS (P < 0.01, Additional file 5, Fig. S5 ). These results indicate that rWR-PRRSV-M amplifies the protective effects of DNA vaccination and reveals the advantage of this priming-boosting strategy. DNA vaccination with pVAX1-Ub-M likely drives the differentiation of memory B cells which are subsequently activated by rWR-PRRSV-M following the booster immunization, resulting in increased M-specific antibody titers.

The frequency and number of CD3 + CD8 + T cells that produced IFN-\u03b3 following stimulation with peptides derived from PRSSV M protein was enumerated using ICS and ELISPOT assays. Using these approaches, we identified two peptides from PRSSV M protein that elicited IFN-\u03b3 production from the splenocytes of vaccinated mice. As shown in Figure  1 , intracellular IFN-\u03b3 staining following stimulation of splenocytes from vaccinated mice with the peptide K 93 FITSRCRL and F 57 GYMTFVHF revealed a population of IFN-\u03b3 producing CD8 + T cells comprising 4-5% of the total CD3 + splenocyte population. In contrast, unstimulated splenocytes and splenocytes exposed to an irrevelant peptide did not contain a population of IFN-\u03b3 producing CD8 + T cells (Figure 1 , panel B and C). Consistent with the ICS data, peptides K 93 FITSRCRL and F 57 GYMTFVHF elicited IFN-\u03b3 production from splenocytes of vaccinated mice when measured by ELISPOT, whereas unstimulated splenocytes and splenocytes stimulated with an irrelevant peptide did not reveal IFN-\u03b3 producing cells (Figure 2 ). The K 93 FITSRCRL and F 57 GYMTFVHF PRSSV M protein peptides were identified bioinformatically as H-2K d and H-2D d restricted CTL epitopes (Table 2) . Specific increases in the number of cells producing IFN-\u03b3 following stimulation with the peptides \"K 93 FITSRCRL\" and \"F 57 GYMTFVHF\" was observed by day 3 after the booster vaccination with rWR-PRRSV-M (Figure 1 and 2) . Furthermore, splenocytes from mice vaccinated with pVAX1-Ub-M responded strongly to \"K 93 FITSRCRL\" and \"F 57 GYMTFVHF\", but not other M protein-derived peptides, at all time points tested following the booster vaccination with rWR-PRRSV-M. When the same pattern of reactivity on three different time points after boosting with rWR-PRRSV-M within each vaccination group were analyzed statistically using ANOVA analysis, statistically significant differences were noted for the peptides \"K 93 FITSRCRL\" and \"F 57 GYMTFVHF\" when compared to the other peptides tested among mice vaccinated and boosted with pVAX1-Ub-M and rWR-PRRSV-M, respectively (P < 0.01, Figure 3A and 3B).

            "text": "It is important to recognize that the ICS assay calculates the percentage of IFN-\u03b3 + cells among CD3 + T cells in the spleen (4-5%), whereas the ELISPOT assay assesses the number of IFN-\u03b3 + cells among all splenocyte cell types (0.05%), and cannot definitively assign the production of IFN-\u03b3 to a particular cell type. Thus, the two assays use different denominators in calculating the frequency of IFN-\u03b3 + production by splenocytes. Importantly, each method clearly identified K 93 FITSRCRL and F 57 GYMTFVHF as the only two peptides from a panel of 27 that elited significant IFN-\u03b3 production from the splenocytes of vaccinated mice. In this study we used BALB/c mice as a model system to identify CTL epitopes in the M protein of PRSSV to circumvent limitations derived from shortages of inbred pigs and a paucity of reagents to evaluate porcine immune responses. The identification of PRSSV CTL epitopes in BALB/c mice allow for the future generation of reagents, such as MHC class I: peptide staining reagents, that will enable the in-depth investigations of CD8 + T cell responses during PRSSV infection and immuinization. Whether these two epitopes can bind the SLA class I molecules of pigs remains to be determined. In some cases, specific peptide epitopes are known to be recognized by cytotoxic T cells in different animal species. For instance, the core region of HCV contains an epitope that is recognized by cytotoxic T cells of both mice and humans [19] . Further research on the role of these peptide epitopes in different species is ongoing in our laboratory.",

B: Summary results of ELISPOT analysis for IFN\u03b3 + production from splenocytes of immunized BALB/c mice stimulated with a panel of M protein-derived peptides. Finally, one hundred and twenty mice were used to analyze the results from ICS and ELISPOT. And the same pattern of reactivity on days 3, 5 and 12 after boosting with rWR-PRRSV-M within each vaccination group were analyzed, and the numbers 1-27 represent different peptides derived from M protein of PRRSV Ch-1a strain; Number 28 is an irrelevant peptide control; NC is an unstimulated negative control; PC is a PMA + ionomycin stimulated positive control; BC is a background control.

M protein-specific antibody responses in mice immunized with PBS, or pVAX1 or pVAX1-U-M DNA, and boosted with rWR-PRRSV-M. Serum samples was obtained from vaccinated mice 7 days after each DNA vaccination and 3 days after boosting with rWR-PRRSV-M, and were evaluated for reactivity to Mprotein in an ELISA based on coating with the truncated M protein fused with a GST tag. And, the day 0 represents the day of the first DNA immunization. Statistically significant differences are indicated by \"*\" or \"**\" for p-values < 0.05 or < 0.01, respectively, as determined by ANOVA.Authors' contributions DLW and GLL gave me the idea of this study. WJZ and YL participated in the design and conducted the majority of the experiments as well as drafted the manuscript. TGT helped revise the manuscript and participated in the first stage of the experiments. YB and QW participated in the prediction of CTL epitopes and analyzed the data. YHX, NHL and TY participated in the sequence alignment. ZGB provided the expression system of recombinant vaccinia virus, and GZT provided the PRRSV Ch-1a strain.
