            "text": "Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) causes considerable economic losses in the poultry industry worldwide, including Taiwan. IBV is among the most important pathogens in chickens, and it spreads rapidly among flocks. In addition to dozens of known serotypes, new viral variants have emerged due to the viral evolution and antigenic variation in IBVs. Therefore, the development of a sensitive, specific, and easily performed assay is crucial for the rapid detection and surveillance of IBV infections. A rapid and simple immunochromatographic strip (ICS) was developed in this study by employing monoclonal antibodies against spike and nucleocapsid proteins of IBV as the tracer and the capture antibody. The ICS showed high specificity in detecting IBV antigens, including several IBV genotypes and novel variants, as opposed to three other common avian respiratory viruses. The detection limit of the strip reached 10 4.4 50% embryo-infective dose. Moreover, in the experimental chicken model, the strip test demonstrated consistency in detecting IBV with RT-PCR gene detection. Taken together, this antigen detection strip has the potential to serve as an on-farm rapid test for IBV; therefore, it may facilitate surveillance and control of the disease.",

IBV can infect the respiratory and urogenital systems in growing chickens, causing high mortality, slowing down growth, and reducing egg production in the flock [1] . Therefore, IBV may result in a considerable economic loss in the global poultry industry. In Taiwan, IBV first appeared in 1958, and the disease has occurred frequently, although an IBV vaccination program has long been implemented [2] . IBV strains in Taiwan include two genotypes, namely Taiwan Group I (TW-I) and Taiwan Group II (TW-II), which are prominent because of their capacity to cause nephritis and respiratory symptoms in chickens [3, 4] . Because of its frequent gene mutations and recombination events, IBV variants in different serotypes have been isolated from the field constantly [5] . Due to serotype differences in Taiwan, extensive use of commercially available Massachusetts (Mass) serotype vaccines did not effectively prevent IBV outbreaks in chicken flocks [2] .",

The S1 protein is highly variable and is the primary target for neutralizing antibodies [7, 8] . Moreover, the N protein is a relatively conserved structural protein that reveals high identity among various strains [9] , and its highly immunogenic nature can induce antibodies as well as the T-cell mediated immunity in chickens [10] . Therefore, the S and N proteins, in parallel development, are widely used as antigen targets for IBV detection [11, 12] .",

A positive IBV TW-I type AF was used as an antigen, and SPF AF was used as a negative control to determine the detection capacity of each combination. It was found that the use of mAb LK-10a and LK2-13a in the ICS generated non-specific signals and thus was ruled out as an option. In the preparation of the tracer, the stability of the mAb-gold conjugate is critical for optimizing the ICS strip's performance. In this study, an mAb concentration of 15 \u00b5g/mL with colloidal gold solution at pH 8 exhibited the most stable condition in coagulation curves.

Moreover, mAbs employed on the strip and the colloidal gold-mAb tracer were ideal for identifying various IBV genotypes. The ICS has the potential to be employed as a screening tool for diagnosing IBV infections in the poultry industry. Further studies evaluating the sensitivity and specificity of ICS detection using the field samples are warranted.",
