Little is known about how the human astrovirus (HAstV) exploits signaling cascades to establish an infection in host cells. Recent studies showed that activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) is important for HAstV infection, though the involvement of other signaling cascades remains unclear. Methods: A panel of kinase blockers was used to search for cellular signaling pathways important for HAstV1 infection. To determine their impact on the infectious process, we examined viral gene expression, RNA replication, and viral RNA and capsid protein release from host cells. Results: Inhibitors of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activation interfered with the infection, independent of their effect on ERK 1/2 activation. Activation of the PI3K signaling cascade occurred at an early phase of the infection, judging from the timeframe of Akt phosphorylation. PI3K inhibition at early times, but not at later times, blocked viral gene expression. However, inhibiting the downstream targets of PI3K activation, Akt and Rac1, did not block infection. Inhibition of protein kinase A (PKA) activation was found to block a later phase of HAstV1 production.",

            "text": "The human astrovirus (HAstV), a member of the Astroviridae family, is a small (28-30 nm) non-enveloped virus with a 6.8-kb, positive-sense RNA genome bound at the 5\u2032 end with the viral protein Vpg and polyadenylated at the 3\u2032 end [1, 2] . Human astroviruses cause gastroenteritis and are a leading cause of viral diarrhea in young children. HAstV type 1 (HAstV1) is the most prevalent of the eight known HAstV serotypes in patients with gastroenteritis. The viral genome of HAstV1 encodes two non-structural proteins, nsp1a and nsp1ab, and a structural protein, the viral capsid protein. The nsp1a protein is encoded by open reading frame (ORF) 1a, whereas the nsp1ab is produced by a translational frameshifting mechanism that begins by translating ORF1a, and then skips ORF1a's stop codon by shifting to the overlapping ORF1b [3, 4] . The nsp1a and nsp1ab polyproteins catalyze their own proteolytic processing to produce functional viral proteins, including Vpg and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [5] . These viral proteins are believed to concertedly modulate cellular function to facilitate viral propagation and directly participate in viral RNA replication [2] . The viral capsid protein, encoded by ORF2, is translated as an 87-kDa protein that undergoes maturational processing by cellular enzymes and trypsin to become the functional viral capsid [6, 7] . The progeny virions produced in the host cell can be released without cell lysis, which appears to be linked to processing of the viral capsid protein by cellular caspases and may involve cellular apoptotic events [8] [9] [10] .",

PI3K is activated when the Src homology domain of its regulatory subunit, p85, binds to auto-phosphorylated tyrosine kinase receptors, non-receptor tyrosine kinases, or some viral proteins in the cytoplasm [14] . The catalytic subunit of the activated PI3K, p110, then converts phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into the lipid messenger phosphatidylinositol (3, 4, 5) -trisphosphate (PIP3), which activates the downstream targets of PI3K. A primary target is Akt, a serine/threonine protein kinase that modulates diverse signaling pathways, such as cell survival, proliferation, migration, differentiation, and apoptosis [15] . The binding of PIP3 allows Akt to form a complex with PDK-1, which phosphorylates and activates Akt [15] . Another important target of PI3K is Rac1, a small Gprotein involved in cytoskeletal remodeling during lamellipodium formation, cell-to-cell contact, and cell migration [16, 17] . PIP3 activates Rac1 by mediating the activation of Rac1-specific guanine exchange factors, such as Tlymphoma invasion and metastasis actor 1 (Tiam1) or Vav1 [16, 17] .",

In this study, we sought to identify additional signaling pathways that play important roles in HAstV1 infection. Our approach was to use a panel of kinase inhibitors to test whether the specific inhibition of individual signaling pathways interferes with HAstV1 infection. We found that inhibitors of PI3K activation blocked HAstV1 infection, despite the fact that ERK activation was not inhibited. This PI3K activation occurred at an early phase of the infection, and apparently did not involve PI3K-mediated phosphorylation of Akt.

Caco-2 cells were infected with HAstV1 in the presence or absence of each kinase inhibitor, and the presence of the inhibitor was maintained until 24 hours post-infection (hpi), when the cells were detected for viral capsid protein by immunofluorescence. While DMSO, the solvent for the inhibitors, did not interfere with viral gene expression ( Figure 1A , panels A and a), 4 \u03bcM staurosporine ( Figure 1A, B and b) , a general kinase inhibitor, or 10 \u03bcM genistein ( Figure 1A , C and c), a general inhibitor for tyrosine kinases, blocked viral gene expression. We noted that staurosporine treatment caused modest cellular toxicity, evident by nuclear staining with DAPI ( Figure 1A , b) and by colorimetric assay for cell viability ( Figure 1C ). However, the almost complete absence of cells positive for viral antigen suggests that the drug was effective in blocking infection in the cells that survived drug treatment. Consistent with the previously reported requirement for ERK1/2 signaling in HAstV1 infection [19] , U0126, a MEK1/2 inhibitor that blocks ERK1/2 phosphorylation, also blocked viral gene expression ( Figure 1A , D and d). Other members of the MAPK family that we tested did not appear to be involved in establishing HAstV1 infection because neither 50 \u03bcM SB 203580, which blocks p38 activation ( Figure 1A , E and e), nor 50 \u03bcM JNK inhibitor II, which selectively inhibits JNK ( Figure 1A , F and f), had a significant effect on viral capsid gene expression. We were also able to confirm that ERK1/2 activation occurs at an early stage of HAstV1 infection. The phosphorylation level of various kinases was examined at different times post-infection by Western blotting for both phosphorylated and phosphorylation-independent epitopes of each kinase (Figure 2A ). The signal intensity of each band relative to that of each mock-infected sample at 0.25 hpi is presented in Figure 2C . Compared with that of the mock-infected sample, the phosphorylation levels of ERK1/2 were noticeably elevated at the early time points (0.25 hpi and 0.5 hpi) ( Figure 2A , \"pERK\" and Figure 2C , \"ERK\"). Similarly, the p38 phosphorylation level appeared to be elevated at 0.25 hpi (Figure 2A , \"pp38\" and Figure 2C , \"p38\"). A marginal increase in the phosphorylation level of JNK was observed in the infected cells throughout the time points examined (Figure 2A , \"pJNK\" and Figure 2C , \"JNK\"). However, only the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, and not that of p38 and JNK, was necessary for infection, judged from the results of the capsid protein expression assay performed with inhibitors specific to these kinases ( Figure 1A ). We noted that the level of phosphorylated ERK1/2 increased at 8 hpi ( Figure 2A , right \"pERK\"), an observation not reported earlier [19] . This is unlikely to be related to any infection event because phosphorylated ERK1/2 was similarly elevated at this time point in the mock-infected sample (left \"pERK\" panel).",

To evaluate this possibility, the phosphorylation level of ERK in the presence or the absence of a PI3K blocker was analyzed by Western blotting ( Figure 2B ). We found that, unlike U0126, which abolished post-infection ERK phosphorylation ( Figure 2B , \"pERK\" panel in the \"U0126\" group), LY294002 did not affect their phosphorylation ( Figure 2B , \"pERK\" panel of the \"LY294002\" group).

In order to more quantitatively measure the effect of the drugs on viral propagation, the amount of viral RNA produced in the cells at 24 hpi in the presence or absence of the drugs was measured by quantitative real-time RT-PCR ( Figure 3A ). Cells treated with genistein, staurosporine, U0126, and LY294002 contained significantly lower amounts of viral RNA than cells treated with the solvent alone, consistent with the finding that these drugs were inhibitory to the expression of viral capsid. Although treatment with wortmannin could show inhibitory effect on viral capsid expression ( Figure 1B) , it did not translate into a significant effect on viral RNA replication (see Discussion). Not surprisingly, drugs that did not inhibit viral gene expression-inhibitors of MAPK p38s (SB203580), JNK (JNK inhibitor II), Akt (MK2206), and PKA (H89)-had no measurable effect on the extent of viral RNA replication. Treatment with triciribine, NSC23766, or Y27632 induced higher levels of RNA replication and did not inhibit the production of viral RNA. These results support the idea that PI3K activation is important for the initiation of viral infection via a non-Akt, non-Rac mediated pathway.",

Although the phosphorylation of Akt did not appear to be essential for viral infection, the early time frame of PI3K activation indicated that PI3K was activated during an early phase of infection, perhaps at the step of viral entry.

The observation that specific, selective PI3K kinase inhibitors did not block ERK phosphorylation, yet exhibited inhibitory effect on infection, indicates that the PI3K-mediated cascade acts independent or downstream of that mediated by ERK ( Figure 2B ). The involvement of ERK activation is not uncommon in signaling during viral infection. ERK signaling has been shown to be important in the mobilization of receptors for the hepatitis C virus (HCV) [28] ; in viral gene expression for respiratory syncytial virus [29] , human cytomegalovirus [30] , and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV) [31] ; in viral genome replication for the influenza virus [32] and mouse hepatitis virus [33] ; in viral assembly for HCV [34] ; and in viral release from host cells for Borna disease virus [35] . Similarly, PI3K-Akt activation is needed for viral entry for the influenza virus [36] , avian leucosis retrovirus [37] , and vaccinia virus [38] , all of which are also functionally dependent on Akt activation, unlike the case with HAstV1 infection. An integration of multiple signaling cascades has been shown for KSHV infection, in which the FAK-Src-PI3K-PKC-MEK-ERK cascade is involved in viral early gene expression [39] , and the PI3K-Akt-RhoA cascade, but not ERK activation, is important for viral entry [40] . An integration of the PI3K and ERK pathways was not observed in HAstV1 infection; rather, the signaling pathways appeared to be separate. Because such a pattern of kinase activation during infection has not been found for other viruses, our study has uncovered a unique signal transduction strategy of HAstV1 for establishing infection in host cells.",

After being washed, the wells were incubated with a 5000-fold dilution of HRPconjugated sheep anti-mouse antibody (GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI, USA) in the blocking solution for 1 h at 37\u00b0C, followed by incubation with an HRP-colorimetric substrate (TMB Microwell Peroxidase Substrate System; catalog no. 50-76-00; KPL, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) at room temperature. The colorimetric reaction was stopped using TMB Stop Solution (catalog no. 50-85-05; KPL) and the absorbance was measured using a SpectraMax M5 microplate reader (Molecular Devices).",

However, treatment with 10 \u03bcM triciribine (Figure 1B, C and c) or with 10 \u03bcM MK2206 (Figure 1B, D and d), both of which are known to inhibit Akt activation as well as Akt-mediated phosphorylation, had marginal effects on viral capsid expression. Examination of the phosphorylation level of Akt in the HAstV1infected cells incubated with LY294002, wortmannin, triciribine, or MK2206 for 24 h showed that all but triciribine treatment effectively blocked the phosphorylation of Akt (Additional file 1 and see Discussion). In addition to the Akt-mediated cascade, Rac1 is also known (See figure on previous page.) Figure 1 Effects of kinase inhibitors on capsid protein expression following HAstV1 infection. (A) Caco-2 cells were infected with HAstV1 (MOI = 0.22) in the presence of solvent alone (DMSO, panels A and a), staurosporine (4 \u03bcM; B and b), genistein (10 \u03bcM; C and c), U0126 (20 \u03bcM; D and d), SB 203580 (50 \u03bcM; E and e), or JNK inhibitor II (50 \u03bcM; F and f). The cells were fixed at 24 h post-infection (hpi), and then HAstV capsid protein was detected by immunofluorescence. Each pair of panels shows, for the same field of cells, the staining patterns for the viral capsid protein (anti-HAstV, A through F) and for cellular DNA (DAPI, a through f). (B) Caco-2 cells were infected with HAstV1 in the presence of various kinase inhibitors, LY294002 (50 \u03bcM; panels A and a), wortmannin (1 \u03bcM; B and b), Triciribine, (10 \u03bcM; C and c), MK-2206 (10 \u03bcM; D and d), NSC23766 (50 \u03bcM; E and e), Y27632 (50 \u03bcM; F and f), and H89 (10 \u03bcM; G and g)",
