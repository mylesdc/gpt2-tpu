Peste des petits ruminants virus dampens host interferon-based signaling pathways through multiple mechanisms. Previous studies deciphered the role of V and C in abrogating IFN-\u03b2 production. Moreover, V protein directly interacted with signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 (STAT1) and STAT2 resulting in the impairment of host IFN responses. In our present study, PPRV infection inhibited both IFN-\u03b2-and IFN-\u03b3-induced activation of IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) and IFN-\u03b3-activated site (GAS) element, respectively. Both N and P proteins, functioning as novel IFN response antagonists, markedly suppressed IFN-\u03b2-induced ISRE and IFN-\u03b3-induced GAS promoter activation to impair downstream upregulation of various interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and prevent STAT1 nuclear translocation. Specifically, P protein interacted with STAT1 and subsequently inhibited STAT1 phosphorylation, whereas N protein neither interacted with STAT1 nor inhibited STAT1 phosphorylation as well as dimerization, suggesting that the N and P protein antagonistic effects were different. Though they differed in their relationship to STAT1, both proteins blocked JAK-STAT signaling, severely negating the host antiviral immune response. Our study revealed a new mechanism employed by PPRV to evade host innate immune response, providing a platform to study the interaction of paramyxoviruses and host response.",

            "text": "The causative agent of PPR, peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV), belongs to the genus Morbillivirus within the family Paramyxoviridae [8] . Peste des petits ruminants virus is a non-segmented, negative-sense, single-stranded RNA virus with a genome length of about 15 kb. The viral genome contains six genes encoding eight proteins that include nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), fusion protein (F), hemagglutinin membrane glycoprotein (H), and large protein (L) structural proteins, as well as non-structural W and C/V proteins [7] . The V and W proteins are the co-transcripts of the P gene due to the one and double G insertion at the editing site, respectively, during the viral transcription. Meanwhile, mRNA coding for the C protein is also generated from the P protein-encoding gene, but through transcription that generates mRNA that encodes an alternate open reading frame [7] . Type I interferons (IFNs) (including IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2) and Type II IFN (IFN-\u03b3) are induced during most viral infections and are responsible for restriction of viral replication in vivo [9] . Type I IFNs directly activate the antiviral response in infected or uninfected cells through upregulation of a series of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) that ultimately inhibit viral replication [10, 11] . Type I IFNs (IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2) bind to IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 receptors, which are composed of interferon-\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor 1 (IFNAR1) and IFNAR2 subunits, to induce autophosphorylation of janus kinase 1 (JAK1) and tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2). Actions of these activated kinases further lead to phosphorylation of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) that include STAT1 and STAT2 [12, 13] . Subsequently, phosphorylated STAT1 and STAT2 form heterodimers that bind to IFN-regulatory factor 9 (IRF9) to form IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) [14, 15] , which functions as a transcriptional factor and is imported into the nucleus to bind to IFN-stimulated response elements (ISREs), initiating expression of various ISGs [10, 11] .",

The activated JAK1 and JAK2 further phosphorylate STAT1 to form homodimers naming gamma activated factor (GAF), which is transported into the nucleus and binds to the gamma interferon activated site (GAS) elements to initiate transcription of IFN-\u03b3-regulated antiviral genes which play a significant role in host innate immune response against pathogen infection [9, 11, 18] .",

The P gene products of paramyxoviruses have been implicated in blocking host IFN response, such as the V protein degrades STATs and inhibits the phosphorylation of STATs, blocking STATs' nuclear translocation [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . The PPRV V protein blocks STAT1 and STAT2 nuclear translocation through interacting with STAT1 and STAT2 [24] . Recently, it has been described that the N proteins of the measles virus (MeV), nipah virus (NiV), and hendra virus (HeV) inhibit IFN responses through different mechanisms [25, 26] . In this study, N and P proteins were identified as two novel IFN antagonistic proteins of PPRV. Both N and P protein showed inhibitory effects on the ISRE and GAS promoter activation induced by IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3, respectively. The expression of antiviral genes induced by IFN-\u03b2 or IFN-\u03b3 was also considerably suppressed by N and P proteins. Further investigation indicated that the nuclear translocation of STAT1 was blocked by N and P protein suppression that, in turn, impaired the expression of various antiviral genes.",

The IFN-\u03b2-induced ISRE promoter activation and IFN-\u03b3-induced GAS promoter activation were both significantly inhibited by PPRV infection ( Figure 1A ). To identify the viral proteins that were responsible for the PPRV-mediated antagonistic role against IFN-\u03b2-and IFN-\u03b3-induced response, the plasmids expressing various viral proteins were co-transfected with ISRE or GAS reporter plasmids, and the cells were then mock-treated or treated with IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3. The results showed that IFN-\u03b2 incubation considerably activated ISRE promoter activation and IFN-\u03b3 treatment highly activated GAS promoter activation. However, PPRV N, P, and V proteins significantly impaired the activation of both ISRE promoter activation and GAS promoter activation ( Figure 1B ). The expression of these viral proteins was confirmed by Western blot analysis ( Figure 1B) . The antagonistic role of V protein has been reported previously.

Some of these genes are commonly inducible by both IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3, while others are only selectively induced by either IFN-\u03b2 or IFN-\u03b3. IFN-\u03b2 initiates upregulation of a set of downstream ISGs, such as ISG54, ISG15, OAS1, and MxA, which play key roles in the antiviral response. To determine whether PPRV N and P proteins inhibited expression of ISGs induced by IFN-\u03b2, mRNA levels of ISG54, ISG15, OAS1, and MxA were measured in the IFN-\u03b2-treated cells which had been transfected with empty vector, N or P expressing plasmids. IFN-\u03b2 treatment induced high expression of these ISGs in the empty vector plasmids transfected cells. However, in the N or P expressing plasmid transfected cells, the expression of these ISGs were remarkably decreased ( Figure 2A) . Similarly, IFN-\u03b3 induced the expression of IFN-\u03b3-regulated genes including IRF1 and STAT1. IRF1 is thought to coordinate the expression of multiple inflammatory genes and cytokines, and STAT1 is an important gene to regulate signal transduction [17] . Overexpression of N or P proteins significantly inhibited IFN-\u03b3induced upregulation of IRF1 and STAT1 ( Figure 2B ). These results suggest that PPRV N and P proteins inhibit the expression of antiviral related genes induced by both IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3. well culture plates were transfected with ISRE (100 ng) or GAS (100 ng) reporter plasmids together with pRL-TK (10 ng) plasmids and 200 ng of various PPRV viral protein expressing plasmids or vector plasmids. At 24 h post-transfection, the cells were treated or mock treated with IFN-\u03b2 (1000 U/mL) or IFN-\u03b3 (100 ng/mL). Luciferase activity was determined at 12 h after IFN-\u03b2 or IFN-\u03b3 treatment. The expression of various PPRV proteins in the transfected cells were detected by Western blot analysis using anti-Flag tag antibody. (C and D) HEK-293T cells in 24 well culture plates were transfected with gradient dose of plasmids coding for N, P, C or M (100, 200 or 300 ng) along with ISRE (100 ng) or GAS (100 ng) reporter plasmids and pRL-TK (10 ng) plasmids for 24 h. Then the cells were treated with IFN-\u03b2 (1000 U/mL) or IFN-\u03b3 (100 ng/mL) for 12 h and subjected to luciferase activity determination.

To determine which N protein domain was responsible for inhibition of IFN-\u03b2-and IFN-\u03b3-induced responses observed in this study, two truncated mutants expressing the core domain and tail domain of N protein were constructed, respectively ( Figure 5A ). Expression of each truncation was confirmed by Western blot analysis ( Figure 5B ). The effects of core domain (N-core) and tail domain (N-tail) on IFN responses were separately evaluated. As shown in Figure 5C , the N-core domain inhibited IFN-\u03b2-induced ISRE promoter activation, while the N-tail domain did not. By contrast, the N-tail domain exerted a crucial suppressive effect upon IFN-\u03b3-induced GAS promoter activation, while the N-core domain exhibited no inhibitory effect ( Figure 5D ). The suppressive roles of both mutants were further investigated by evaluating their effects on expression levels of various host antiviral genes normally induced by IFN-\u03b2 or IFN-\u03b3. As observed in the aforementioned reporter assay, IFN-\u03b2-induced expression of ISG54 and ISG15 was significantly inhibited by the N-core domain, but not by the N-tail domain ( Figure 5E ), while IFN-\u03b3-induced expression of IRF1 and STAT1 was inhibited by the N-tail domain, but not by the N-core domain ( Figure 5F ). The effect of N-core and N-tail on nuclear transport of STAT1 was also investigated by IFA assay (Figure 5G ), which showed that N-core suppressed the nuclear import of STAT1 induced by IFN-\u03b2 but not IFN-\u03b3. However, N-tail only suppressed IFN-\u03b3-induced nuclear import of STAT1. A statistical evaluation was used to analyze the subcellular localization status of STAT1 in the nucleus and cytoplasm which confirmed the different effect of N-core and N-tail ( Figure 5H and I). These results suggest that PPRV N protein core and tail domains play different antagonistic roles and each operate in an IFN type-specific manner. ( Figure 5B ). The effects of core domain (N-core) and tail domain (N-tail) on IFN responses were separately evaluated. As shown in Figure 5C , the N-core domain inhibited IFN-\u03b2-induced ISRE promoter activation, while the N-tail domain did not.

            "text": "P and V proteins of paramyxoviruses share similar N-terminal domains. However, it has been found that these proteins may act via different antagonistic mechanisms to counter host antiviral responses, such as the V protein of rinderpest virus (RPV) could effectively block the IFN-induced phosphorylation of STAT1; however, P protein was relatively inefficient [22, 34] . Measles virus (MV) P but not V protein could inhibit STAT1 phosphorylation [35, 36] . We determined that PPRV P protein significantly blocked both IFN-\u03b2-and IFN-\u03b3-induced phosphorylation of STAT1. A previous study had indicated that tyrosine 110 (Y110) of the PPRV V protein, the key amino acid involved in the interaction between V and STAT1, was involved in inhibiting IFN signaling [24] . We also investigated whether the Y110 of PPRV P protein was involved in the P protein-mediated antagonistic effect involving STAT1 observed here. To avoid a P protein conformational change-mediated explanation for loss of function resulting from amino acid substitution, Y110 was substituted with either a basic amino acid residue (histidine, H) or an aromatic amino acid residue (phenylalanine, F). To investigate whether the mutation of Y110 affects the interaction of P protein with STAT1, Myc-STAT1 expressing plasmids were co-transfected with wild-type P protein (WT), the mutants of P protein Y110H or Y110F expressing plasmids or empty vector in HEK-293T cells. The co-immunoprecipitation assay was then performed. As shown in Figure 7A , introduction of Y110H or Y110F into the P protein abrogated its interaction with STAT1, suggesting that Y110 is a key residue involved in the P protein interaction with STAT1. The V protein shares the N-terminus to the P protein. It suggested both the N terminus of V and P proteins showed significant antagonistic roles, and the involved antagonistic mechanism by the N terminus might be similar.",

The plasmids expressing mutants Y110H, Y110F or WT P proteins were co-transfected with reporter plasmids and subjected to IFN-\u03b2 or IFN-\u03b3 treatment. The luciferase activity was then measured and compared. The ISRE promoter activation level induced by IFN-\u03b2 and the GAS promoter activation level induced by IFN-\u03b3 were clearly higher in the Y110H or Y110F mutant expressing cells than that in the WT P protein expressing cells ( Figure 7B and C) . However, the mutation of Y110 did not fully recover the total (100%) activity. The ISRE promoter activation level induced by IFN-\u03b2 in the Y110H or Y110F mutant expressing cells did not reach the control levels. Maybe other sites were also involved in this suppressive effect. The expression of antiviral-related genes stimulated by IFN-\u03b2 or IFN-\u03b3 were further evaluated and analyzed. The IFN-\u03b2-induced expression of ISG54 and ISG15 and the IFN-\u03b3-induced expression of IRF1 and STAT1 were remarkably increased in the Y110H or Y110F mutant expressing cells than in the WT P protein expressing cells ( Figure 7D and E).

In this study, we found that PPRV N protein also impaired the host IFN response by blocking JAK-STAT pathway signaling. No interaction was observed between PPRV N protein and components of the JAK-STAT pathway, and N protein exhibited no inhibitive effect on IFN-\u03b2-or IFN-\u03b3-induced phosphorylation of STATs. The PPRV N protein considerably reduced STAT1 nuclear accumulation which was similar than the effect caused by MV and NiV N proteins [25, 26] . However, PPRV N protein did not affect STAT's complex formation. Further studies should be performed to investigate the different mechanisms used by N proteins of various paramyxoviruses.",

The C-terminal tail in N protein possesses the features of intrinsically disordered proteins [33] . It is identified that the 1-375 amino acid region of MV N protein is the minimal region for nucleocapsid assembly [31] . In the present study, the region of amino acids 1-375 of the PPRV N protein was defined as the N-core domain, and the 376-525 region was defined as the N-tail domain. We determined that the N-core suppressed the IFN-\u03b2-meditated signaling, but the N-tail inhibited the IFN-\u03b3-induced signaling, showing that the different regions of the N protein targeted different IFN pathways. The N-core and N-tail might target different adaptor molecules and result in this distinction. This is different from the N-cores of NiV and HeV, which inhibit both the IFN-\u03b2-and IFN-\u03b3-induced IFN response [26] . This might be the reason why N proteins of different paramyxoviruses reveal different functions in suppression of host IFN response. Whether PPRV N protein inhibited the nuclear transport system for STATs should be further investigated. The mechanisms for the different role of N-core and N-tail should also be explored.",

In the present study, we determined that PPRV P protein interacted with STAT1 and suppressed STAT1 phosphorylation and nuclear transportation. The P protein of MV was able to interact with STAT1 and prevented the phosphorylation of STAT1 to inhibit the IFN-\u03b2-induced response [35, 45] . The PPRV P protein may suppress host IFN response through a similar manner used by the MV P protein. However, the MV V protein does not interfere with STAT1 phosphorylation [35, 36] .

The PPRV V protein interacts with JAK1 [46] , but we did not observe an interaction between P protein and JAK1. Both PPRV P and V proteins interacted with STAT1. The tyrosine 110 (Y110) in the PPRV V protein is critical for its interaction with STAT1. We found mutation of Y110 in the P protein completely abrogated its interaction with STAT1 and resulted in a considerably decreased suppressive effect of P protein on IFN response. The Y110 site of PPRV V and P proteins might share a similar antagonistic mechanism by targeting STAT1. The Y110 in the MV P protein is also required to block STAT1 phosphorylation [35] . The Y110 in the V and P proteins is identified as specific amino acid residue for the STAT1 interaction in some Morbilliviruses [35, 48, 49] . These results indicate that the Y110 plays a significant role in the V protein and P protein of paramyxoviruses. We speculate that the binding site of STAT1 for PPRV P protein may be essential for phosphorylation of STAT1. The Src homology 2 (SH2) domain of STAT1 is critical for the phosphorylation of STAT1, the P protein of MV binds with the SH2 domain of STAT1, which sequesters the JAK1-meditated STAT1 phosphorylation or hinders the interaction between STAT1 and its receptor [45] . Further investigation will focus on more extensive elucidation of STAT1 residues involved in binding to the PPRV P protein.",
