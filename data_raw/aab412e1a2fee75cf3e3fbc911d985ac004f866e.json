It is an immune mechanism that removes intracellular pathogens by the degradation of dysfunctional intracellular organelles. Mammalian autophagy involves initiation, nucleation, elongation, closure, maturation, and degradation [2] . Impaired autophagy has been linked to the pathogenesis of various diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), ne crotizing enterocolitis (NEC), tuberculosis neurodegeneration, and aging. Polymorphisms in two autophagyrelated genes-ATG16L1 and interferon-regulated GTPase (IRGM)-are strongly correlated with Crohn's disease (CD) [3, 4] . Autophagy occurs in the intestinal epithelium of neonatal piglets [5] , in the intestinal epithelium of NEC patients and in the ileum of NEC rats [6] . Multiple autophagy-related proteins control autophagosome formation. Activated mTOR, VPS34, and Beclin-1 (a mammalian homolog of yeast Atg6) are required to induce autophagy. Although it is unclear whether autophagy is a protective response or a deleterious process, it is clear that uncontrolled autophagy has adverse effects in certain pathological conditions, ultimately causing cell death.",

Relative protein band intensities of ATG16L1 in pig ileum were analyzed with NIH image. Data are reported as the mean \u00b1 SD. ANOVA, * P<0.05. By H&E staining, we observed vigorous immune infiltration (yellow arrow) and discontinued muscularis mucosae (green arrow) in pig ileum infected with HRV ( Figure 5A ), but the LGG-treated infected ileum had less inflammation. LGG helped to maintain intestinal epithelial integrity. Claudin-2 is a 'leaky' claudin that forms a water channel, which mediates paracellular water transport in leaky epithelia [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . Western blotting showed that virus infection increased the expression of claudin-2, whereas LGG treatment lowered the claudin-2 level after infection ( Figure 5B ). This result may explain our observations that LGG-treated piglets were less likely to develop HRV diarrhea and had a shorter mean duration of diarrhea compared with the non-treated group (data not shown). Our previous study and unpublished data showed that nontreated infected pigs had worse clinical and histopathological outcomes than the LGG+HRV group.

Our data suggest that well-controlled autophagy is necessary to protect the host intestine from injury. The Gn pig model allowed us to observe the effects of continuous LGG feeding on HRV gastroenteritis in a relatively clean background and well-controlled system. This model ensured that the data were not confounded by other microbes present in conventionally reared pigs. The gastrointestinal physiology and immune system in piglets closely mimic those of human infants [28] . However, we also recognize the limitations of the current studies. We had limited number of piglets in the experimental groups. We could not use a genetically engineered pig model to further investigate the host autophagy responses or the genes that mediate the protective role of LGG. In an in vitro experiment, we investigated autophagy after virus infection and LGG treatment in a pig intestinal epithelial cell line [29] , but we did not observe responses similar to those in vivo. Moreover, some antibodies against the relevant porcine proteins are not commercially available. Regardless of the limitation, our current findings have their novelty in studying virusinduced autophagy and LGG suppression of uncontrolled autophagy in vivo.",

All pigs were confirmed as germ-free prior to LGG feeding and sera negative for rotavirus antibodies prior to HRV exposure. Pigs (both males and females) were randomly assigned to four treatment groups as follows: (1) LGG colonization plus HRV infection (LGG+HRV), (2) HRV only (HRV), (3) LGG only (LGG) or (4) mock control (Mock). At 3 days of age (post-LGG feeding day, pigs in LGG groups were orally dosed with 10 3 CFU LGG in 3 ml of 0.1% peptone water, and the daily LGG dose increased by 10-fold each day up to 10 12 CFU. The incremental increases in LGG doses were determined empirically to avoid causing diarrhea by high doses of probiotic bacteria during the first few days of life, as Gn pigs lack maternal antibodies. The pigs were then fed 10 12 CFU every day until euthanasia. Pigs in non-LGG groups were given an equal volume of 0.1% peptone water. At PFD 9 (post-HRV inoculation day [PID] 0), pigs in HRV groups were orally inoculated with10 5 FFU HRV in 5 ml Diluent #5 (Modified Eagle Medium with 1% non-essential amino acids, 1% antibiotics [penicillin 10,000 I.U./ml + streptomycin 10,000 MCG/ml + amphotericin 25 MCG/ml]), and pigs in non-HRV groups were orally inoculated with an equal volume of Diluent #5. Pigs were given 8 ml of 100 mM sodium bicarbonate 20 min before HRV inoculation to reduce gastric acidity. Pigs were euthanized for sample collection on PFD11 (PID 2).",
