            "text": "Interferon alpha/beta (IFN-\u2423/\u2424) is a critical mediator of protection against most viruses, with host survival frequently impossible in its absence. Many studies have investigated the pathways involved in the induction of IFN-\u2423/\u2424 after virus infection and the resultant upregulation of antiviral IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) through IFN-\u2423/\u2424 receptor complex signaling. However, other than examining the effects of genetic deletion of induction or effector pathway components, little is known regarding the functionality of these responses in intact hosts and whether host genetic or environmental factors might influence their potency. Here, we demonstrate that the IFN-\u2423/\u2424 response against multiple arthropod-vectored viruses, which replicate over a wide temperature range, is extremely sensitive to fluctuations in temperature, exhibiting reduced antiviral efficacy at subnormal cellular temperatures and increased efficacy at supranormal temperatures. The effect involves both IFN-\u2423/\u2424 and ISG upregulation pathways with a major aspect of altered potency reflecting highly temperature-dependent transcription of IFN response genes that leads to altered IFN-\u2423/\u2424 and ISG protein levels. Discordantly, signaling steps prior to transcription that were examined showed the opposite effect from gene transcription, with potentiation at low temperature and inhibition at high temperature. Finally, we demonstrate that by lowering the temperature of mice, chikungunya arbovirus replication and disease are exacerbated in an IFN-\u2423/\u2424-dependent manner. This finding raises the potential for use of hyperthermia as a therapeutic modality for viral infections and in other contexts such as antitumor therapy. The increased IFN-\u2423/\u2424 efficacy at high temperatures may also reflect an innate immune-relevant aspect of the febrile response. IMPORTANCE The interferon alpha/beta (IFN-\u2423/\u2424) response is a first-line innate defense against arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses). Arboviruses, such as chikungunya virus (CHIKV), can infect cells and replicate across a wide temperature range due to their replication in both mammalian/avian and arthropod hosts. Accordingly, these viruses can cause human disease in tissues regularly exposed to temperatures below the normal mammalian core temperature, 37\u00b0C. We questioned whether temperature variation could affect the efficacy of IFN-\u2423/\u2424 responses against these viruses and help to explain some aspects of human disease manifestations. We observed that IFN-\u2423/\u2424 efficacy was dramatically lower at subnormal temperatures and modestly enhanced at febrile temperatures, with the effects involving altered IFN-\u2423/\u2424 response gene transcription but not IFN-\u2423/\u2424 pathway signaling. These results provide insight into the functioning of the IFN-\u2423/\u2424 response in vivo and suggest that temperature elevation may represent an immune-enhancing therapeutic modality for a wide variety of IFN-\u2423/\u2424-sensitive infections and pathologies.",

This role has been abundantly demonstrated with arboviruses and other viruses by infection of Ifnar1 \u03ea/\u03ea mice that lack interferon alpha/beta (IFN-\u2423/\u2424) signaling. In many cases, a completely benign localized infection of normal mice is rendered systemic and rapidly fatal by elimination of signaling through the IFN-\u2423/\u2424 receptor (e.g., see references 2 to 5). Even minor changes in the characteristics of the IFN-\u2423/\u2424 response greatly increase viral replication and disease (6) .",

This leads to production of proteins in infected and uninfected cells that, together, constitute an \"antiviral state.\" This response is the primary protector of vertebrate hosts from overwhelming virus replication prior to development of the adaptive immune response and is also involved in the clearance phase of infection (9, 10) . Subclinical infections with arboviruses and other viruses that normally affect only regional tissues can be rendered systemic and catastrophic by the absence of this response (2, 3, 11) . The type I IFN response is so effective that it can determine apparent tissue tropism for highly IFN-\u2423/\u2424-sensitive viruses (2) . This suggests that even minor increases or decreases in the efficacy of this response could have dramatic impacts upon the outcome of virus infection.",

However, temperatures in peripheral tissues of humans can range as much as 5\u00b0C below 37\u00b0C under normal room-temperature conditions (12) and can become much lower under more extreme conditions (13) . In addition, few studies have examined IFN-\u2423/\u2424 responses under the febrile conditions under which they commonly act in vivo during pathogen infection. Indeed, core (rectal) temperatures can rise to 42\u00b0C during extreme febrile or hyperpyrexic episodes, and febrile responses to infection typically range between 38 and 40\u00b0C (14) . However, two recent studies have suggested that IFN-\u2423/\u2424 responses may be lesser in upper airway epithelia, where temperatures are substantially below core (15, 16) . This work complemented several historical studies that also suggested temperature-mediated effects on IFN-\u2423/\u2424 efficacy in other model systems (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) . Other early studies, however, including some with arboviruses, which identified temperature variation as a factor in IFN-\u2423/\u2424 effectiveness implicated temperature-altered virus replication rather than the IFN-\u2423/\u2424 response (24) (25) (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) (31) (32) (33) (34) (35) .",

            "text": "Here, we demonstrate that multiple arboviruses, including alphaviruses, bunyaviruses, and flaviviruses, which have evolved to replicate at ambient temperatures in the invertebrate vector, are dramatically more resistant to the IFN-\u2423/\u2424 system at temperatures below 37\u00b0C. Subnormal temperatures led to a considerable diminution of IFN-\u2423/\u2424 efficacy, and supranormal temperatures led to a modest enhancement of efficacy, possibly representing an evolutionary mechanism for the febrile response. At the same time, induction of IFN-\u2423/\u2424 was delayed and reduced at low temperatures and enhanced at higher temperatures in vitro. A primary mechanism underlying the temperature effect appeared to involve reduced rates of gene transcription at the lower temperatures. Furthermore, in a mouse model of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection and musculoskeletal disease (MSD), lowered temperatures induced in torpid or reserpine-treated mice resulted in exacerbation of virus replication and signs of MSD in an IFN-\u2423/\u2424 response-dependent manner. The results of these studies will have impacts upon the understanding of pathogenesis of all arboviruses as well as other viruses that replicate in sites with altered temperature (e.g., rhinovirus [RV], influenza virus, and coronavirus) as well as other therapeutic contexts in which IFN is used (e.g., oncology). 37\u00b0C ( Fig. 2A and B and S2A to C). ISG mRNA expression patterns paralleled protein production at early time points, suggesting that temperature-dependent differences in ISG transcription efficiency contribute to differences in corresponding protein levels ( Fig. 2C and S2D and E). However, ISG mRNA induced at 30\u00b0C did equal or surpass the levels induced at the higher temperatures at later times post-IFN-\u2423/\u2424 treatment, whereas protein levels did not. These data may suggest that both ISG transcription and subsequent translation are independently affected by cell temperature variation and that attenuation of both processes at 30\u00b0C contributes to the decreased magnitude of ISG production in response to IFN-\u2423/\u2424 treatment.",

We observed an approximately 2-fold decrease in intron transcript levels in cells incubated at 30\u00b0C compared to 37\u00b0C; however, raising the temperature to 39\u00b0C did not appear to influence basal transcription (Fig. S3A ). To test whether basal translation rate was also affected by temperature variation separately from effects on basal transcription, we transfected MEF cells with in vitro-transcribed RNAs expressing firefly luciferase (fLuc) and measured fLuc activity after 1 h of incubation at 30, 37, and 39\u00b0C. At 30\u00b0C, fLuc reporter protein levels were slightly lower than those at 37\u00b0C, and fLuc activity was slightly increased at 39\u00b0C over that at 37\u00b0C (Fig. S3B ). Beyond 1 h, fLuc activity at 30\u00b0C met and surpassed the higher temperatures and continued to rise through 6 h posttransfection, while activity at the higher temperatures peaked and waned, indicating a defect in reporter RNA and/or fLuc protein degradation at 30\u00b0C. We confirmed this result in MEF cells lacking Ifnar1 to rule out differential IFN-\u2423/\u2424 responses to the reporter RNA at different temperatures accounting for this result (Fig. S3B ). To verify that basal translation rates vary with temperature in a native setting, we performed a [ 35 S]methionine-cysteine incorporation pulse-chase experiment in MEFs incubated at 30, 37, and 39\u00b0C. Equal volumes of total protein lysates were quantified by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography and densitometry analysis of all visible protein bands. In agreement with the fLuc reporter results, we observed an approximately 2-fold reduction in new protein synthesis at 30\u00b0C compared to that at the higher temperatures after 1 and 12 h of incubation (Fig. S3C) . These results indicate that both basal transcription and translation are affected by cellular temperature and likely contribute to the effect of temperature variation on ISG expression.",

            "text": "Suppression of type I IFN signaling pathways is not associated with early temperature effects. In addition to the effects of temperature variation on global cellular transcription rates, we hypothesized that effects on one or more steps in the IFN-\u2423/\u2424 signaling cascade may contribute to the temperature sensitivity of ISG transcription. IFN-\u2423/\u2424 stimulates gene expression via activation of the JAK-STAT pathway, dependent upon the receptor tyrosine kinase activity of the IFN-\u2423 receptor complex (IFNAR1/2) and subsequent phosphorylation of primarily STAT1 and STAT2. It has been published previously that IFN-IFNAR binding characteristics do not vary significantly in the range of 30 to 37\u00b0C (39), so we decided first to examine the effect of temperature variation on the phosphorylation of STAT1 at Tyr-701. This step is mediated by the kinase Jak1 at the receptor complex and is required for assembly of the transcription factor complex ISGF3, which stimulates ISG transcription in the nucleus (reviewed in reference 40). Cells treated with IFN-\u2423/\u2424 at 30, 37, or 39\u00b0C for 30 min showed similar levels of phosphorylated STAT1 (STAT1-p Tyr-701) by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 3A and  S4A and B). By 60 min of IFN-\u2423/\u2424 treatment, STAT1-p levels remained elevated in the 30\u00b0C samples but decreased at the higher temperatures ( Fig. 3A and S4B ). Because phosphorylated STAT1 is required for ISG transcription, these findings did not fit with the attenuation of ISG transcription that we observed at 30\u00b0C (Fig. 2C and S2D and E). For all panels, Vero cells were treated with 1,000 IU/ml IFN-\u2423/\u2424 at 30, 37, or 39\u00b0C for 0 to 24 h. (A and B) Immunoblotting of ISG protein levels (A) and corresponding densitometry quantification with ISG bands normalized to \u2424-actin (B), presented as mean ratio of ISG to actin \u03ee SD. (C) qRT-PCR was performed on total cellular RNA with specific primers for the indicated ISGs. Data are presented as fold change in 18S rRNA-normalized C T values between IFN-\u2423/\u2424-treated and untreated cells at each temperature \u03ee SD. Significance between groups is indicated with color-coordinated asterisks. For example, red and green asterisks indicate significance of 39 and 37\u00b0C results, respectively, over 30\u00b0C. Two sets of same-colored asterisks stacked over a single data point indicate significance of the results at that temperature over both others at that time point.

To test this, we examined the efficiency of STAT1-p Tyr-701 migration into the nucleus at different temperatures using confocal microscopy. In agreement with total STAT1-p levels, but in contrast to the observed effect on ISG transcription, IFN-\u2423/\u2424 treatment of cells at 30\u00b0C resulted in significantly higher average content of STAT1-p per nucleus than at 37\u00b0C and 39\u00b0C by 30 min of IFN-\u2423/\u2424 stimulation ( Fig. 3B and S4C ). Furthermore, we noted similar levels of STAT1 phosphorylated at Ser-727, a modification required for maximal transcriptional activity of STAT1 that occurs in the nucleus, at all temperatures at 1 h post-IFN-\u2423/\u2424 treatment ( Fig. 3C and S4D) . Interestingly, late after IFN-\u2423/\u2424 treatment, levels of STAT1-p Tyr-701 at 37 and 39\u00b0C were significantly increased over those at 30\u00b0C, indicating a potential mechanism for greater sustenance of the response at higher temperatures (Fig. 3D ). This finding could perhaps be a consequence, in part, of the increased level of total 30, 37, or 39\u00b0C were subjected to immunocytochemistry staining for STAT1-p (Y701).

            "text": "Transcription of IFN response pathway genes is highly temperature dependent. Because the IFN-\u2423/\u2424 signaling pathway upstream of ISG transcription was not attenuated by subnormal cellular temperature, we decided to focus more closely on the effect of temperature variation on ISG transcription. Specifically, we examined whether ISG mRNA induction was unique in its temperature sensitivity compared to other inducible and constitutively expressed genes or whether this phenotype might be solely attributable to a decrease in global transcription rates. We performed direct mRNA quantification analysis via the NanoString platform on total RNA derived from MEF cells treated at 30, 37, or 39\u00b0C with IFN-\u2423/\u2424 or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 3 to 12 h. NanoString is a high-throughput mRNA quantification method that utilizes fluorescently bar-coded hybridization probes to simultaneously detect and count hundreds of distinct mRNA species in a given sample. Our multiplexed gene target panel included a variety of inducible genes from each stimulus, as well as signaling intermediates, feedback and regulatory genes, and cell homeostatic components such as transcription and translation factors (see Table S2 for a complete list of target genes). Most constitutive genes were not appreciably affected by changing temperature or the addition of either stimulus (data not shown), including genes selected for normalization (Fig. S5A ). Expression of known temperature-responsive genes, including the cold-inducible CIRP and RBM3 and the heat-inducible HSP70, displayed the expected temperature-dependent patterns, but expression was not influenced by IFN-\u2423/\u2424 or LPS treatment (Fig. S5B ). Gamma actin intron 3 levels also followed the temperaturesensitive trend that we observed in our qRT-PCR assays (Fig. S5C ). These results combine to validate the NanoString platform as a reliable method for quantitating the effect of temperature variation on gene expression. Figure 4A shows the fold induction of IFN-\u2423/\u2424-responsive genes at 30, 37, and 39\u00b0C versus temperature-matched mock-treated samples at 3, 6, and 12 h post-IFN-\u2423/\u2424 treatment, respectively. Figure 4B shows analogous results for LPS-treated cells. Only genes upregulated at least 2-fold over mock at any temperature are shown and included in subsequent analyses. After 3 h of stimulation with IFN-\u2423/\u2424 or LPS, IFN-\u2423/ \u2424-induced and LPS-induced genes displayed similar patterns of temperature-sensitive expression in general, with optimal induction at 37\u00b0C or 39\u00b0C and dramatically reduced induction at 30\u00b0C ( Fig. 4A and B). Upon closer examination, however, differences became apparent. Most ISGs in our panel displayed decreased expression at 30\u00b0C compared to 37\u00b0C far below the 2-fold decrease in basal transcriptional rate that we observed ( Fig. S3A and S5C), indicating that the temperature sensitivity of ISG transcription may be attributable to additional mechanisms. Although this was also true of some LPS-inducible genes, there were several examples (IKBA, NFKBIZ, and TNFAIP3) upon which temperature variation seemed to have little or no effect (Fig. 4B) . These results contrasted with the reliable temperature sensitivity of all ISGs in the panel. In addition, induction kinetics varied between ISGs and LPS-induced genes throughout the rest of the time course. For LPS-induced genes, apart from known ISGs also induced by LPS (GBP1 and GBP2), expression in the 30\u00b0C group matched or exceeded expression at the higher temperatures by just 6 h of LPS treatment ( Fig. 4B and C). At 30\u00b0C in IFN-\u2423/\u2424-treated cells, in contrast, ISG induction remained significantly lower than at higher temperatures until 12 h of IFN-\u2423/\u2424 treatment (Fig. 4C ). These differences in gene induction by LPS and IFN-\u2423/\u2424 at different temperatures could indicate gene-or pathway-specific responses to changing cellular temperature beyond simple changes to basal transcriptional rates.",

Thus far, our studies have focused on the effect of temperature variation on the signaling/effector phase of the IFN-\u2423/\u2424 response. However, as the effector phase is preceded by the IFN-\u2423/\u2424 inductive phase in response to infection in vivo, it is relevant to examine the effect of temperature in this context as well, as IFN-\u2423/\u2424 efficacy in vivo depends concurrently on the two Table S2 ) using the NanoString platform. Raw mRNA counts in each sample were subjected to background subtraction followed by normalization to the geometric mean of five normalization genes (\u2424-actin, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase [GAPDH], \u2424-tubulin, POLR2A, and eIF3a) in the same sample.

It has been published previously that IFN-\u2423/\u2424 induction by rhinovirus is diminished at the subnormal temperatures of airway epithelial cells, which could contribute to enhanced rhinovirus fitness in the upper airways (15) . To avoid temperature-dependent differences in viral replication that could influence IFN-\u2423/\u2424 production, we electroporated poly(I:C) into MEFs and then incubated the cells at 30, 37, or 39\u00b0C. We observed the earliest detectable IFN-\u2423/\u2424 activity in cell supernatants from the 39\u00b0C samples, and IFN-\u2423/\u2424 activity remained highest at this temperature throughout the time course (Fig. 5A ). IFN-\u2423/\u2424 induction at 37\u00b0C was slightly but significantly reduced compared to that at 39\u00b0C at early time points but still far exceeded levels of IFN-\u2423/\u2424 produced at 30\u00b0C, which did not surpass the limit of detection until ",

However, this does not accurately represent the context of a viral infection, in which differences in viral replication rates at different temperatures could lead to variation in pathway stimulation and likely compound the effect of temperature on IFN-\u2423/\u2424 induction that we observed with poly(I:C). To verify that viral infection at different temperatures also stimulates differential IFN-\u2423/\u2424 induction, we infected cells at 30\u00b0C for the first hour to allow equal attachment and entry. After washing, infected wells were divided among 30, 37, and 39\u00b0C temperature treatments for 12 to 24 h, at which times supernatants were collected and assayed for IFN-\u2423/\u2424 activity as described in Materials and Methods. Infections of MEF cells required the use of mutant viruses whose transcription and translation inhibitory mechanisms have been disabled (SINV-nsP2-726G [ Fig. 5D ] and VEEV-CD/nsP2-739L [ Fig. 5E ]) (37) . However, we also tested a wild-type alphavirus, SINV-TR339 (Fig. 5F ), in the murine monocyte/macrophage RAW 264.7 cell line, which, unlike MEFs, can still produce IFN-\u2423/\u2424 upon wild-type alphavirus infection. Unlike the results with poly(I:C), we observed the greatest IFN-\u2423/\u2424 activity from the 37\u00b0C infections, and levels of IFN-\u2423/\u2424 produced at 39\u00b0C either did not differ from or were significantly lower than those observed from the 37\u00b0C treatment ( Fig. 5D to F). In agreement with the poly(I:C) results, however, viral infection at 30\u00b0C resulted in greatly delayed and stunted IFN-\u2423/\u2424 production ( Fig. 5D to F) . Surprisingly, viral titers did not vary appreciably between temperatures, in general, indicating that differences in pathway stimulation may not have contributed much to differences in IFN-\u2423/\u2424 output in this context. Viral growth at any temperature did not seem to be impacted by IFN-\u2423/\u2424 induction by 24 hpi, which may be explained by the fact that these viruses are competent for some inhibition of downstream IFN-\u2423/\u2424 signaling in MEFs. The exception was SINV-nsP2-726G at 39\u00b0C, which did suffer some inhibition compared to the other temperatures, a possible indication of the increased efficacy of IFN-\u2423/\u2424 at 39\u00b0C apparent against this virus. Importantly, these results demonstrate that IFN-\u2423/\u2424 induction is also sensitive to temperature variation and that a viral infection occurring at subnormal temperatures may benefit both from diminished detection and IFN-\u2423/\u2424 induction and from reduced ISG upregulation leading to a weakened antiviral state relative to higher temperatures. Combined, these two factors may create an environment in which the virus can replicate uninhibited by the IFN-\u2423/\u2424 response long enough to produce IFN-\u2423/\u2424 antagonists, which could then combat subsequent IFN-\u2423/\u2424mediated restriction, an interplay that could be particularly relevant in vivo.",

One of two strategies was used to achieve core temperature reduction depending on the experimental setup: either induction of metabolic torpor, a prolonged state of inactivity and energy conservation that attenuates heat-generating mechanisms (42) , or administration of the small molecule reserpine (RES), which depletes peripheral monoamine neurotransmitters by antagonizing the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT), leading to dysregulation of temperature regulatory mechanisms (43, 44) . Both methods effectively reduced mouse subcutaneous (scruff) temperature in both wild-type C57BL/6 (B6) and IFNAR1 \u03ea/\u03ea (AB6) mice (Fig. S6) . For assessing the effect of reduced temperature on CHIKV-induced MSD, torpid and normal mice were infected in the left rear footpad and cross-sectional area was measured daily to track foot swelling. In wild-type mice, torpor induction resulted in significantly greater MSD between 6 and 8 days postinfection (dpi), whereas in IFNAR1 \u03ea/\u03ea AB6 animals, MSD was slightly reduced by torpor (Fig. 6A) . These results suggest that the effect of reduced body temperature on CHIKV-induced disease signs manifests in an IFN-\u2423/\u2424-dependent manner, with low temperature leading to more severe disease only when functional IFN-\u2423/\u2424 is present.",

In B6 mice, viral signal in both the infected (ipsilateral) and contralateral footpads rose similarly over time between RES-treated and normal animals until 3 days postinfection, beyond which the signal in the RES-treated group increased significantly over the signal in the warm group (Fig. 6B ). An opposite trend was observed in AB6 mice, with viral signal in RES-treated animals significantly lower than in the warm mice for the entire course of infection, until the mice were about to succumb to the infection (Fig. 6B ). In addition, viral titers from dissected tissues were not significantly different between normal and torpid B6 mice at 2 dpi but remained high in the infected footpad and spleen of the torpid mice by 6 dpi, indicating dysfunctional viral clearance in those tissues at reduced temperature (Fig. 6C) . Finally, torpid mice failed to induce a robust serum IFN-\u2423/\u2424 response at 2 days post-CHIKV infection compared to normal mice, suggesting that impaired IFN-\u2423/\u2424 inductive pathways in vivo at low temperatures likely contribute to the observed effects on CHIKV infection (Fig. 6D) , although kinetic differences in virus replication brought on by the altered temperatures may have contributed to this result.",

            "text": "Historically, studies of the IFN-\u2423/\u2424 response have largely relied on genetic knockout strategies to examine the roles of individual mediators and effectors in various infection and disease models. However, there is a growing body of literature focused on intact innate immune mechanisms within the variable physiological contexts in which they operate in vivo and how this variability may affect efficacy (15, 16, 19, 20, 23, (46) (47) (48) (49) . The results presented here indicate that ambient temperature can have broad impacts on the effectiveness of the mammalian IFN-\u2423/\u2424 antiviral response. Many human pathogens, such as respiratory viruses, and other pathologies, such as certain malignancies (50), cause disease in tissues regularly exposed to temperatures below the normal core temperature of 37\u00b0C and may take advantage of a weakened innate immune environment. In these studies, we examined whether arboviruses, which are replication competent across a wide range of temperatures due to their evolution in both arthropod vectors and mammalian or avian hosts, represented another type of pathogen capable of subverting IFN-\u2423/\u2424 responses occurring at subnormal temperatures. In vitro, we found that arboviruses representing three distinct viral families had increased fitness at 30\u00b0C relative to 37\u00b0C but only when cells had been pretreated with IFN-\u2423/\u2424 at each temperature. Without IFN-\u2423/\u2424 present, lowered temperature conferred no advantage on viral replication. These findings parallel trends observed with human rhinovirus (RV) and influenza virus (15, 16) , although the increased fitness of RV at low temperature is attributable to additional mechanisms as well (51) . Uniquely, our studies demonstrate that temperature-dependent IFN-\u2423/\u2424 efficacy alone is sufficient to alter Temperature Variation Modulates Interferon Efficacy \u00ae arbovirus fitness and effectively overcome the small disadvantage posed to these viruses by low temperature in the absence of IFN-\u2423/\u2424. Collectively, these data suggest that the effect of temperature on IFN-\u2423/\u2424 efficacy is widely applicable to any IFN-\u2423/ \u2424-sensitive infection or pathology that occurs in a reduced-temperature environment.",

Mechanistically, it has been shown previously (15, 16) that several ISGs were less robustly induced at the mRNA level when cells were treated with IFN-\u2423/\u2424 at temperatures below 37\u00b0C, but the mechanism(s) leading to decreased ISG transcription, as well as whether reductions in ISG transcript are functionally relevant to the antiviral state at the protein level, was not addressed. We found that activation of the JAK-STAT pathway resulting in phosphorylation, nuclear translocation, and nuclear phosphorylation of STAT1 to the transcription-promoting state was not attenuated by subnormal temperature. In fact, IFN-\u2423/\u2424 signaling at 30\u00b0C resulted in more phosphorylated STAT1 present in the nucleus than signaling at 37\u00b0C. Thus, differences in IFN-\u2423/\u2424 signaling efficiency were not responsible for the observed reduction in ISG transcript induction at subnormal temperature. Importantly, marked temperature-dependent differences in ISG expression were observed at the protein level, indicating that differences in ISG transcription and possibly subsequent translation result in differential functionality of the antiviral state at different temperatures. It is also possible that the activities of individual ISGs may be affected by temperature variation and that this could contribute to differences in their efficacy. If true, this idea may help explain the enhanced antiviral activity of IFN-\u2423/\u2424 observed at 39\u00b0C versus 37\u00b0C, when ISG protein levels were only modestly higher at this temperature. Moreover, enhanced induction of ISGs known to strengthen the IFN-\u2423/\u2424 response, such as RIG-I or RNase L, at higher temperatures may also contribute to increased efficacy versus lower temperatures, although this idea would presumably apply also to negative-feedback ISGs, such as SOCS. Further studies will be needed to test this idea for individual ISGs and to determine the relative contributions that these differences may make to immunity against specific pathogens. In sum, we conclude that transcription is the first step in both the IFN-\u2423/\u2424 inductive and effector ISG inductive pathways affected by low cellular temperature that lead to attenuation of the antiviral activity of the IFN-\u2423/\u2424 response.",

            "text": "Although detailed examination of the transcription factor activities for individual ISGs that account for the effect of temperature was beyond the scope of our current studies, our results comparing baseline transcriptional rate with ISG and LPS-responsive gene transcriptional efficiency did reveal some relevant trends. Transcript levels of the constitutively expressed genes included in our NanoString analysis did not change appreciably upon temperature shift, while initial transcription of genes induced upon IFN-\u2423/\u2424 or LPS treatment was highly affected by incubation temperature. We observed an approximately 2-fold reduction in basal transcriptional rate at 30\u00b0C versus 37\u00b0C by intron qRT-PCR, and this may account for a portion of the reduction in inducible gene expression. However, it does not fully explain the dramatic differences in induction of all ISGs that were highly upregulated, nor does it account for the subset of LPSresponsive genes whose expression was not temperature sensitive. In general, these results point to a model in which inactive genes are much more susceptible to transcription attenuation by low temperature than genes actively being transcribed. Potentially, chromatin remodeling around inducible promoters and initial assembly of transcription machinery represent additional obstacles to inducible genes being \"turned on\" that are absent from constitutively active genes (52) . In addition, variation in the chromatin environments around different promoters, as well as in the transcription factors required for transcription of different genes, would allow for differential temperature sensitivity of inducible genes. Indeed, increased sp1 recruitment to a hypothermia-responsive element upstream of the cold-responsive RNA binding protein (Cirp) locus has been identified in the preferential upregulation of this gene at low temperature (53) , indicating that temperature shift can impact transcription initiation at the chromatin level. In this view, the reliable temperature sensitivity that we observed with ISGs is consistent with the presumption that IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE)-containing promoters reliant on similar transcription factors and chromatin modifications (54) (55) (56) would be subject to the same challenges of transcription initiation at subnormal temperatures, yielding the phenotype of temperature-sensitive ISG transcription. In contrast, the chromatin remodeling events and transcription factors required for LPS-responsive genes can vary considerably (52, 57) , allowing for the possibility of different effects of temperature shift on individual genes or subsets of genes. Consistent with this idea, several genes that responded to both LPS and IFN-\u2423/\u2424 treatment followed the same temperature-dependent expression patterns regardless of the stimulus. Examination of additional signaling cascades with known repertoires of inducible genes, particularly those that stimulate distinct sets of transcription factors and cofactors to effect transcription of different gene subsets, will be helpful in elucidating gene-specific versus pan-regulatory effects of temperature variation.",

            "text": "The initial lag in ISG transcription at 30\u00b0C was largely overcome by 12 h post-IFN-\u2423/\u2424 treatment, and in some cases, ISG transcript levels at this temperature continued to increase as they began to stabilize or wane at the higher temperatures. Similarly, LPS-inducible gene transcript levels at 30\u00b0C also initially lagged behind those at higher temperatures on average but drew level by just 6 h of LPS treatment, with many genes exhibiting greater expression at 30\u00b0C by this time point. Although the mechanisms behind this temporal difference in ISG and LPS-induced gene regulation by temperature are unclear, this observation represents another piece of evidence that the effect of temperature on gene transcription is likely gene and/or pathway specific. That levels of gene transcripts induced at 30\u00b0C eventually met or exceeded peak expression at the higher temperatures and remained elevated over a longer period of time could be the result of a generalized increase in mRNA stability at subnormal temperatures (58) (59) (60) and/or due to a defect in negative-feedback pathways responsible for curtailing these signaling pathways. Regardless, there did not appear to be a functional consequence of ISG mRNA levels \"catching up\" at 30\u00b0C, as ISG protein levels remained reduced at this temperature compared to 37 and 39\u00b0C, even as late as 48 h post-IFN-\u2423/\u2424 treatment. It is likely that protein translation was also attenuated separately from transcription, accounting for this difference, as translational slowing is generally considered a hallmark feature of the cellular cold stress response (59, 61) . This idea is supported by our in vitro RNA translation reporter and protein synthesis radiolabel assays (see Fig. S3 in the supplemental material). Differences in translational efficiency may also explain instances of enhanced ISG protein production at 39\u00b0C over 37\u00b0C when there was no difference at the transcript level. We conclude that general suppression of translation likely contributes to the suppression of ISG protein production at 30\u00b0C independently from effects on transcription. Whether ISG transcripts are specifically sensitive to temperature-induced changes to translation efficiency, or whether these effects manifest with all mRNAs, is still unclear.",

            "text": "We also investigated the effect of temperature variation on IFN-\u2423/\u2424 induction efficiency upon stimulation with either poly(I:C) or viral infection. Poly(I:C), a nonreplicating stimulus, was used for examination of IFN-\u2423/\u2424 induction with equal pathway stimulation at each temperature. In agreement with previous studies (15) , poly(I:C) treatment of cells at subnormal temperatures resulted in delayed and stunted IFN-\u2423/\u2424 production compared to 37\u00b0C. That study attributed this difference to a modest reduction in the enzymatic activities of the cytosolic sensors RIG-I and MDA-5 at low temperature, as determined in in vitro ATPase assays (15) . In contrast, we found that that a downstream consequence of RIG-I/MDA-5 stimulation, the phosphorylation of IRF3, was not suppressed at the low temperature, suggesting that any effect on the enzymatic activity of these sensors is functionally inconsequential in this context. Rather, the effect of temperature on this pathway, as in the JAK-STAT pathway, likely manifests first at the level of transcription of responsive genes. We observed delayed transcription of IfnB, Ifna4, and Ifit1 genes, each primarily dependent on IRF3 in fibroblasts (7), at 30\u00b0C versus the higher temperatures at early time points, but levels surpassed those at the higher temperatures quickly thereafter. However, IFN-\u2423/\u2424 protein release was drastically slowed and reduced at 30\u00b0C, both initially and well after mRNA levels had recovered, as was IFIT1 protein expression, indicating that efficiency of translation and/or secretory mechanisms also contributed to the reduction in IFN-\u2423/\u2424 secretion at the lower temperature. Further studies are required to determine whether translation or secretory suppression by low temperature represents a universal effect or whether different mRNAs are affected to various degrees. Poly(I:C) treatment at 39\u00b0C resulted in the highest induction of IFN-\u2423/\u2424 and IFIT1 proteins, indicating that enhanced IFN-\u2423/\u2424 production may be an evolutionary aspect of the febrile response in vivo. As IFN-\u2423/\u2424 is itself a pyrogenic cytokine, this relationship could be evidence of a feed-forward loop in which innate immune responses and fever coregulate to mount a more rapid response to infection.",

            "text": "IFN-\u2423/\u2424 induction was similarly temperature dependent upon alphavirus infection, with the cells infected at 30\u00b0C resulting in delayed and diminished IFN-\u2423/\u2424 production compared to 37\u00b0C. Interestingly, we did not observe the same enhancement of peak IFN-\u2423/\u2424 production at 39\u00b0C compared to 37\u00b0C that we did with poly(I:C) treatment. It is reasonable to hypothesize that an enhanced downstream antiviral state at a febrile temperature could lead to more efficient control of the infection, possibly with lower peak IFN-\u2423/\u2424 induction. Indeed, we did observe greater viral control of SINV-nsP2-726G at 39\u00b0C than at 37 or 30\u00b0C in our MEF cultures, even with IFN-\u2423/\u2424 levels well below those at 37\u00b0C. In contrast, at 30\u00b0C, IFN-\u2423/\u2424 induction and subsequent effector phase are both delayed and attenuated. Because alphaviruses have evolved to grow efficiently at this temperature (and colder) in arthropods, virus replication largely resists the low-temperature environment, and initial replication proceeds largely uninhibited by IFN-\u2423/\u2424. During this window, the virus can produce sufficient levels of IFN-\u2423/\u2424 antagonists before a strong antiviral response can be mounted. IFN-\u2423/\u2424 antagonism by most alphaviruses depends on the activities of nonstructural protein 2 (nsP2) or capsid proteins (37, 62, 63) , and the viruses can also interfere with JAK-STAT signaling (36, 64, 65) .",

            "text": "In a murine model of CHIKV infection, we demonstrated that hypothermia can exacerbate virus replication and associated musculoskeletal disease, but only in the presence of a functional IFN-\u2423/\u2424 response. In mice lacking IFNAR1, lowered body temperatures reduced both viral replication and disease signs, indicating that the effect of the reduced temperatures on the virus was acting through its effects on IFN-\u2423/\u2424, and serum IFN-\u2423/\u2424 levels were much reduced in cold mice versus their warm counterparts. Surprisingly, differences in MSD in wild-type mice manifested several days after hypothermic mice had recovered to a normal body temperature, indicating that, as predicted from our cell culture models, influences of reduced temperature on viral infection occur at an early stage of the virus-host interaction, in the window before IFN-\u2423/\u2424 can control the infection. As MSD in CHIKV infection is a complicated process driven by both viral and host factors (41) , it is tempting to speculate that subnormal temperatures early during infection allowed the virus to establish a more severe infection in the face of a weakened IFN-\u2423/\u2424 response, which then attracted increased immune cell infiltrates and induced greater inflammation at the site of infection. We did observe delayed viral clearance in the infected footpad and the draining lymph node of the hypothermic mice compared to the normal mice at 6 dpi, which could help drive the exacerbated MSD at later time points. Together, these results demonstrate that CHIKV or other arbovirus pathogenesis and disease can be altered by variation in tissue temperature, with subnormal temperatures benefitting, and supranormal temperatures impairing, virus infection via effects on the IFN-\u2423/\u2424 response. This suggests that local or systemic warming could represent a viable therapeutic for infection with CHIKV or other arthritogenic arboviruses if applied early after infection. Finally, it is also worth noting that early studies of temperature and interferon responses focused on the establishment of persistent infection and its relationship to temperature-dependent interferon induction in vitro (66) (67) (68) (69) (70) . It will be of interest to determine if temperature effects on the innate immune system influence the establishment of arboviral persis-tence in sites such as the testes (Zika virus [71] [72] [73] ) and peripheral joints (CHIKV [74] ) that may differ from core temperatures.",
