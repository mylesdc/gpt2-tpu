The objective of this study was to compare the clinical features and risk factors for adverse outcome in patients with RT-PCR confirmed MERS and in those with acute respiratory disease who were MERS-CoV negative, presenting to the King Fahad Medical City (KFMC) in Riyadh between October 2012 and May 2014. The demographics, clinical and laboratory characteristics and clinical outcomes of patients with RT-PCR confirmed MERS-CoV infection was compared with those testing negative MERS-CoV PCR. Health care workers (HCW) with MERS were compared with MERS patients who were not health care workers. One hundred and fifty nine patients were eligible for inclusion. Forty eight tested positive for MERS CoV, 44 (92%) being hospital acquired infections and 23 were HCW. There were 111 MERS-CoV negative patients with acute respiratory illnesses included in this study as \"negative controls\". Patient with confirmed MERS-CoV infection were not clinically distinguishable from those with negative MERS-CoV RT-PCR results although diarrhoea was commoner in MERS patients. A high level of suspicion in initiating laboratory tests for MERS-CoV is therefore indicated. Variables associated with adverse outcome were older age and diabetes as a co-morbid illness. Interestingly, co-morbid illnesses other than diabetes were not significantly associated with poor outcome. Health care workers with MERS had a markedly better clinical outcome compared to non HCW MERS patients.",

As of July 24th, 2016, 1,782 patients have been confirmed with MERS-CoV infection globally with 634 fatalities [2] . MERS still remains a zoonotic infection with dromedary camels suspected to be the source of infection [3, 4] . However, transmission between humans can occur within family or health care settings, some of these leading to hundreds of infections, as occurred in Jeddah, Riyadh and the Republic of Korea [5] . Outbreaks within health care facilities have been associated with low clinical suspicion and delayed recognition, leading to unsuspected secondary transmission. Other factors predisposing to such transmission events include over-crowded emergency rooms, lack of effective triage at first contact with the health care system, deficiencies in routine infection control practices and mild unrecognised infections, especially among health care workers (HCW) resulting in outbreaks [5, 6, 7, 8] .",

Information on whether or not there are clinical, demographic or epidemiological characteristics that distinguish MERS from other causes of acute respiratory illness (ARI) is important for clinicians providing care in MERS-CoV endemic countries such as Saudi Arabia, or when caring for travellers returning from MERS-endemic areas. In one study, 17 patients with MERS were compared with 82 concurrently investigated patients who were RT-PCR negative for MERS [12] . Furthermore, while there have been reports on the clinical presentation of MERS in HCW [13] , we could not identify previous studies that compared the clinical features of MERS-CoV infected health care workers with those who are non-health care workers.",

            "text": "Clinical, demographic and outcome data from 159 patients investigated as suspected MERS were analysed; of these 48 were virologically confirmed as MERS-CoV infected. MERS patients who were not HCW were older than HCW and those who were MERS-CoV negative. The presenting clinical features of patients with MERS were indistinguishable from those who were investigated for MERS but found MERS-CoV negative, with the exception that diarrhoea was more common in patients with MERS. This appears to be primarily because 11 of 23 (48%) HCW with MERS reported diarrhoea significantly more often than patients who were MERS-CoV negative (15/94; 16%) (p = 0006). However, there was no difference in the frequency of diarrhoea in non-HCW MERS patients and non-MERS patients. Notably, diarrhoea was also a prominent feature of SARS with evidence of virus replication in intestinal epithelium [15] . It is important to note that 25% of patients had normal chest radiographs at initial presentation and 15% never developed an infiltrate. This was reminiscent of the radiological presentation of SARS where a proportion of patients also did not have an infiltrates on chest radiography at presentation but many of these did have detectable abnormalities on computerised tomography scans [15] . The observation that the clinical features of patients with MERS-CoV infection is indistinguishable from those who are hospitalised for other ARI emphasises the need for a low threshold of clinical suspicion for initiating MERS-CoV laboratory testing in patients with severe respiratory disease. Exposure to hospital environments in the two weeks prior to clinical onset was one significant risk factor for infection. However, 62% of patients who were not MERS-CoV positive also had similar exposure to health care facilities, possibly because many of them had other co-morbidities. Exposure to animals, though significantly more common reported in the non HCW patients with MERS (10%) than in those without MERS (0%), was not elicited in the majority of patients with MERS. Some of the MERS-CoV infections (both HCW and non-HCW) were known to have been acquired nosocomially [7] and thus would not be expected to have zoonotic exposure as a source of infection. Patients with MERS who were non-HCW were more likely to > 50 years of age when compared to non-MERS patients (p = 0.0034) and MERS patients who were HCW (p = 0.0005). Patients with MERS who were non-HCW had significantly worse clinical outcomes than those who were MERS-CoV negative or HCW with MERS-CoV infection. This may be related, in part, to the fact that both HCW and non-MERS patient groups were younger and had fewer co-morbid conditions. In a previous report of MERS-CoV infection in HCW detected by active case finding of contacts, seven infected HCW were documented, two of whom were asymptomatic, while the other five had mild upper respiratory tract symptoms [13] . The age of the HCW with MERS-CoV infection ranged between 28-56 years with only one of them having underlying co-morbidity. Only 4 (17%) required ICU admission and one (4%) died. In other case series of MERS, significant proportions have been HCW, but the clinical features of the HCW and non HCW MERS patients have not been systematically compared [6, 8, 16] . It is clear that the overall clinical presentation and outcomes in HCW and non-HCW MERS is markedly different. When analysing clinical outcomes of MERS, it is important to distinguish between those in HCW and non-HCW, because they have markedly different clinical outcomes.",
