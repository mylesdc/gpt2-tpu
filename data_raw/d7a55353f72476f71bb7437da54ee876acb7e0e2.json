Abaecin, a 34-aa-long antimicrobial peptide from honeybees, was expressed in a fusion form to 6xHis-SUMO in a new vector system to evaluate the prokaryotic expression platform of the antimicrobial peptides. The fusion sequences were codon-optimized in three different combinations and expressed in E. coli. The combination of the native SUMO sequence with codon-optimized abaecin showed the highest expression level among the three combinations, and most of the expressed fusion proteins were detected in soluble fractions. Cleavage of the SUMO tag by sumoase produced a 29-aa-long abaecin derivative with a C-terminal deletion. However, this abaecin derivative still retained the binding sequence for its target protein, DnaK. Antibacterial activity of the 29-aa long abaecin was tested against Bacillus subtilis alone or in combination with cecropin B. The combined treatment of the abaecin derivative and cecropin B showed bacteriolytic activity 2 to 3 times greater than that of abaecin alone.",

As a proline-rich, non-glycosylated antimicrobial peptide [27] , abaecin has a broad spectrum of bacteriolytic activity [30] and shows increased inhibitory effects on bacterial growth when treated with pore-forming peptides, such as cecropin A [13, 31] , stomoxyn, and hymenoptaecin. The 34-aa-long cationic peptide contains 10 prolines (29%) with no cysteine residue, and the uniformed distribution of the proline residues through the entire peptide prevents the \u03b1-helical conformation [12, 27] .",

The antibiotic resistance gene, aminoglycoside-3\u2033-adenylyltransferase (aadA), was put under the control of 16S rRNA promoter, and the transcripts were stabilized using the 3' UTR fragment of the E.coli rrnB operon [34, 35] . For chloroplast expression of transgenes, flanking sequences which can integrate the expression cassettes into the chloroplast genome at a specific location were added to both ends of the combined expression cassette fragments. The flanking sequences were derived from the trnI and trnA regions of the tobacco chloroplast genome. The integration region is transcriptionally active and has been widely used for high expression of transgenes [36, 37] .

Three different combinations of codon-optimized synthetic sequences of the 6xHisSUMO-abaecin were cloned into the new vector, and their expression in an E. coli system was investigated after the confirmation of their sequences (Fig. 1a, b and Additional file 1: Figure S1 ). For the codon optimization, codon adjustment was performed according to a previous study [33] , in which a new algorithm for codon optimization was developed based on the codon usage hierarchy of chloroplast psbA genes, and the codonoptimized sequences under the control of psbA/5' UTR showed increased expression levels over their respective native sequences in both E. coli and plant chloroplasts. The expressions of all the three fusion constructs didn't show any toxicity to host cells.

Colonies of untransformed and transformed E.coli with each of the three different constructs were randomly picked from solid media and cultured in liquid media at 37\u00b0C overnight and then OD values were measured at 600 nm next day. For the transformed E.coli, the liquid cultures were grown in both 100 \u03bcg/\u03bcl ampicillin and 50 \u03bcg/\u03bcl spectinomycin, while the untransformed one was cultured with no antibiotics. Each bar represents the mean and standard deviation values of three independent OD measurement experiments. DH5\u03b1, untransformed control; 6xHSU-Aba, 6xHisSUMO-abaecin; N, native sequence; C, codon-optimized sequence grown in liquid culture and the relative expression levels between the three fusion proteins were examined using an immunoblot assay with anti-His antibody. The expressed fusion proteins were detected around 20 kDa, not at 15.7 kDa which is a deduced molecular weight (Fig. 2a) . This kind of discrepancy is very often observed in proline-rich proteins expressed in E. coli, due to presumably increased rigidity caused by high proline content, leading to slower migration than the same molecular weight protein [38] [39] [40] [41] . Abaecin (3.9 kDa, 34 amino acids) contains 10 prolines in total of 34 amino acids, accounting for 34.9%, so it is assumed that the high content of proline residues affected the migration of all three fusion proteins (136 amino acids in length for each construct). Among three fusion proteins, 6xHisSUMO (N)-abaecin (C) (N and C, stand for \"native sequence\" and \"codon-optimized sequence\", respectively) showed the highest expression, with 2.8 or 3.5 fold higher expression than 6xHisSUMO(C)-abaecin (N) or 6xHisSUMO(C)-abaecin(C), respectively (Fig. 2b ). All three constructs showed that the expressed fusion proteins were detected at levels 1.4 to 2.1 times higher in the soluble fraction than in the insoluble one (Fig. 2b) .",

We also tested whether the SUMOfused abaecin is toxic to bacteria when treated externally, although we had already confirmed that there was no toxicity of the 6xHisSUMO-fused abaecin to host cells when expressed in the cells (Fig. 1c) . The treatment of the 6xHisSUMO-abaecin didn't show bacteriolytic activity against B. subtilis (Fig. 4a, b) . In the preliminary test, we found that anti-B. subtilis activity of 29-aa abaecin required an amount of 1.7 \u03bcg (Fig. 4a, b) . The antimicrobial activity of 29-aa abaecin was enhanced in a combination treatment with cecropin B. No antimicrobial activity was observed by cecropin B when 0.125 \u03bcg of the peptide was treated (Fig. 4a, b) , however, the antimicrobial activity of abaecin, at the dose of 1.7 \u03bcg, was increased by 40% when combined with the cecropin B (0.125 \u03bcg) (Fig. 4a, b) . The antibacterial activity of abaecin was further enhanced by the increase of cecropin B quantity up to 0.25 \u03bcg (Fig. 4a, b) . These results are consistent with the previous reports that the functional interaction of abaecin with other pore-forming peptides, such as cecropin A, stomoxyn and hymenoptaecin, at their sublethal concentrations, reciprocally potentiates bacteriolytic activity by increasing membrane permeabilization [13, 31, 43] .",

The commonly used fusion carriers such as thioredoxin (12 kDa) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST, 26 kDa) have several advantages associated with increased solubility, promotion of proper folding and prevention of toxicity of AMPs [9, 46, 47] . However, GST increases the relative molecular weight ratio of carrier proteins to the peptides, which leads to low AMP yields. Also, several GST fused-AMPs expressed in E.coli showed proteolytic activity, resulting in inefficient or failed AMP productions. Thioredoxin is more favorably used for peptide production than the GST due to its small size, allowing high peptide yield attributed to the high peptide-to-carrier ratio [47] . However, the proteases used for the release of attached peptides from the carriers are more expensive and more sensitive to pH and chaotropes when compared to SUMO protease [47] . Moreover, AMPs tagged to aggregation-promoting carriers such as PurF fragment, PaP3:30 and ketosteroid isomerase have shown toxicity to host bacterial cells [9, 48] . 3 MS analysis of the cleaved-off abaecin using MALDI-TOF and investigation of binding sequence of 29-aa-long abaecin to DanK. a MS spectra obtained from reflector mode.

In contrast to our expectation, the attached SUMO tag (overall charge \u2212 5) didn't protect the abaecin (overall charge + 4, Fig. 3b ) via electrostatic interaction from endogenous proteases in an E.coli system. Small size peptides with high cationic content are highly susceptible to proteolytic attack in E.coli as shown in Piers et al.'s study [10] . In the study, direct expression of small size cationic peptide such as human neutrophil peptide 1 (HNP-1, a kind of defensin) wasn't successful, while its transcript was detected. Even when the HNP-1 and other cationic Fig. 4 Evaluation of antibacterial activity of 29-aa-abaecin with or without cecropin B. a The antibacterial activities of 29-aa abaecin with or without cecropin B against B. subtilis. Agar plates spread with 100 \u03bcl of B. subtilis liquid culture grown overnight were punctured and dropped with 10 \u03bcl of abaecin or cecropin B or both peptides, which were purified and resuspended in 1X PBS, then incubated at 37\u00b0C for 16 h. The antimicrobial peptides and their amount treated into the corresponding wells are represented in (b). b Evaluation of inhibitory effect by antimicrobial peptides on B. subtilis by measuring the inhibited zone area. The inhibited zone areas of B. subtilis were extrapolated using ImageJ software. Scale bars represent 1 cm peptide, synthetic cecropin/melittin hybrid (CEME), were fused to GST, the fusion proteins were proteolyzed. However, the proteolysis wasn't observed when anionic pre-pro defensin sequence was inserted between the GST and the cationic peptides. Based on our analysis, a positively charged patch created by two Arg (R) at 12th and 13th positions (Fig. 3b ) seemed to not be recognized by endogenous proteases possibly due to charge neutralization effect by the electrostatic interaction with SUMO, while the second patch created by two Lys (K) at 28th and 30th positions (Fig. 3b ) seemed subjected to proteolytic attack. Another possibility of the C-terminal deletion could be a consequence of excessive sonication, resulting in denaturation of the fusion protein and breakdown at the C-terminus. Also, it can't be ruled out that the sumoase could aberrantly cleave the abaecin. It is thought that sumoase is highly specific and active in a broad range of conditions; it cleaves effectively in a wide range of pH (5.5-10.5) and temperatures (4-37\u00b0C), and even in detergents such as 2 M urea or 20 mM DTT or \u03b2-mercaptoethanol [25] . However, the cleavage study at the junction between SUMO and a partner protein showed that the cleavage didn't work when the first amino acid of the partner protein was Pro (P) [25] . Also, the introduction of a stretch of several Try (W) residues close to the cleavage site caused random cleavage within the fusion protein due to an inaccessibility of sumoase by steric hindrance, which, however, was relieved by addition of 1 M urea and led to the release of correct size peptide [26] . Considering the high content of proline in abaecin, the repeated kinks generated by 10 prolines in the abaecin could create a steric hindrance when attached to SUMO, which would lead an unexpected random cleavage. To investigate these issues mentioned above, SUMO could be further modified in a way which introduces additional glycine resides at the cleavage junction to release steric hindrance. In our unpublished study, cleavage of SUMO-cecropin B at the junction by sumoase happened only after introduction of additional glycine residues. Also, genetically modified SUMO which has more negative charge could provide a better protection to cationic peptides.",

Furthermore, the bacteriolytic activities were consistent with previous reports in which the antimicrobial activity of abaecin alone was further enhanced with combinatory treatment with other pore-forming AMPs [31, 43] . Although abaecin has high binding efficacy to DnaK like other proline-rich DnaK-binding AMPs including metalnikowins, metchnikowins, onocin Onc72, apidaecin Api88, drosocin and pyrrhocoricin, the abaecin hasn't a conserved motif, YL/IPRP [43] . So we analyzed both abaecin amino acid sequences such as 34-aa and 29-aa-long abaecins for the functional binding sequence to DnaK using limbo server and found that the full length abaecin has two binding sequence sites: one is at N-terminus ( 1 YVPLPNV 7 , score 1.7) and the other one is at C-terminus ( 25 NPKIKWP 31 , score 2.8). So we assume that the reason why the 29-aa long abaecin still has antimicrobial activity (Fig. 4) is due to the presence of N-terminal binding sequence to DnaK (Fig. 3c) .",

            "text": "The main purpose of this study was to introduce a new expression platform for the production of antimicrobial peptides in E.coli system in a way that does not harm the host cell. Abaecin was chosen as a reference AMP because it targets the intracellular molecule DnaK, prokaryotic heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70), and the binding of abaecin to DnaK can cause protein metabolism to be compromised in E. coli, resulting in host cell death [43] . The 6xHisSUMO-abaecin fusion protein, however, did not exhibit toxicity to E. coli host cells. The transformed E. coli cells grew in liquid culture at the similar growth rate to untransformed ones (Fig. 1c) . Furthermore, the purified fusion protein showed no anti-bactericidal activity against B. subtilis (Fig. 4a, b) . The normal growth of the transformed E. coli and the lack of antimicrobial activity of the fusion protein to B. subtilis proved that the lethal activity of the AMP to the host cells can be properly shielded by SUMO but its activity can be restored by the release from the tag. The antimicrobial activity of AMPs is generally determined by the hydrophobicity and the net positive charge. As reported in the previous study, the electrostatic interactions between the positive charges (between + 4 and + 6) of AMPs and negatively charge residues within SUMO (overall charge \u2212 5) seem to play a key role in neutralizing the bacteriolytic activity and protecting AMPs from degradation by endogenous proteases [26] . In this regard, although the protection of abaecin from proteolytic degradation by SUMO failed, the C-terminal deleted abaecin still had antimicrobial activity. Furthermore, the toxicity of abaecin was, in some way, successfully prevented by the SUMO tag via the presumed electrostatic interaction. The SUMO tagging system is also advantageous because it has no disulfide bond. Due to the reducing environment of the E. coli cytoplasm, proteins that require disulfide bonds fail to achieve their active forms and ultimately form inclusion bodies or are degraded by proteases. To achieve and maintain their active forms, such proteins need to be redirected to periplasmic space or secreted, which are energy-consuming and could potentially lower target protein yield. However, the SUMO tagging system does not require the additional steps because it only contains one cysteine in its entire 96 amino acid sequence.",

There have been many reports that SUMO fusions increased the solubility of difficult-to-express proteins in E.coli, such as GFP, metalloprotease (MMP13) [25] and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV) proteins including 3CL protease, nucleocapsid protein and spike C protein [49, 50] . However, in contrast to antimicrobial peptides, those proteins are not toxic to the host cells. To conclusively distinguish the effect of SUMO on the solubility of the fusion protein, the expression of abaecin alone would need to be compared with SUMO-abaecin fusion protein, which, however, was not examined in this study due to technical issues such as possible low stability and potential toxicity to host cells. As mentioned above, the direct expression of the small size and high cationic content of AMPs are highly susceptible to endogenous proteolysis [10] . Furthermore, the expression of abaecin alone could be lethal to host cells because the peptide inhibits intracellular DnaK [43] , which is a central organizer of the chaperone network in E.coli. The chaperone protein interacts with~700 cytosolic proteins. Among them,~180 proteins are relatively prone to be aggregation and rely extensively on DnaK during and after their initial folding [51] .",

Codon usage was adjusted according to the codon usage preference of a gene, psbA, which is highly expressed in prokaryotic systems, and then three different combinations of codon-optimzed sequences were created. The codon adjustment was performed in a way to increase the compatibility between 5' UTR of the psbA promoter and the 5\u2032 coding region of the fusion gene, with an increase of AT content of the SUMO sequence to 63.5% from 59.5%. In contrast to our expectation, the codon optimization of N-terminal SUMO of the fusion protein failed to improve the expression level over the non-optimized counterpart. As seen in the Fig. 2a, b , the native sequence of SUMO performed better than its corresponding codon-optimized sequence for the expression of the fusion proteins. The expression level of 6xHisSUMO-abaecin (nativecodon-optimized) was 2.8 or 3.5 times higher than that of 6xHisSUMO-abaecin (codon-optimizednative) or 6xHisSUMO-abaecin (codon-optimizedcodon-optimized), respectively (Fig. 2b) . This is likely due to the stability of the transcribed mRNA of the native SUMO sequence, which may be relatively higher than the stability of other codon-optimized sequences [52] . Another possible explanation is that the compatibility of the 5' UTR of the promoter with the 5\u2032 coding sequence of the codon-optimized SUMO could be compromised, resulting in an unstable or inefficient translational initiation complex [53, 54] . It is generally thought that translational efficiency is influenced by the efficiency of the formation of translational initiation complex and thus the first~30-50 codons are considered more important than the rest of the sequence [55, 56] . Therefore, the marginal difference of expression level between codon-optimized SUMO fused native and codon-optimized abaecins could be a conseqeunce of the inefficient formation of the translational initiation complex.",

Pores created in the membrane by the pore-forming peptide allow abaecin to access its intracellular target, DnaK. The inhibited heat shock proteins compromise protein metabolism, and the damaged pores remain unrepaired, thus allowing abaecin even greater access to its target. Abaecin's ability to increase membrane permeabilization consequently reduces the minimal inhibitory concentrations of both abaecin and other pore-forming peptides in a reciprocal manner [31, 43] . Likewise, the activity of the pore-forming peptide cecropin B from Hyalophora cecropia was potentiated in a combinatorial treatment with abaecin ( Fig. 4) , showing that abaecin can be used with diverse pore-forming peptides to inhibit bacteria which are renitent to conventional antibiotics.",

Currently, most AMPs under clinical development are designed to target local infections using a topical formulation. Only a few AMPs are being developed for systemic delivery [45] . Although an oral delivery system is most likely preferred due to straightforward administration, AMPs require special consideration because peptides are rapidly broken down in the gastrointestinal tracts due to the high concentration of proteases and high acidity. In this respect, edible plants can be used as a delivery platform, by which peptide based drugs bioencapsulated within the plant cells can be protected from the harsh environment of the gastrointestinal tract. But the drugs can be released into the intestine by the break-down of the cell walls by cellulolytic bacteria. The plant expression and delivery system can also eliminate the concern of endotoxin contamination, which causes fatal septic shock to recipients. Furthermore, the oral delivery of peptides by edible plant cells eliminates the need for expensive downstream purifications, reducing product cost and benefiting patients [18, 20, 21] . In our future study, we will evaluate the efficacy of the plant expression system as well.",
