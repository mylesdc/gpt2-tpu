Recent studies have shown that monoclonal antibody-(mAb-) based passive immunotherapy is a promising approach to combat virus infection. Specific mouse mAbs can be routinely generated in large amounts with the use of hybridoma technology but these cannot be used for therapy in human beings due to their immunogenicity. Therefore, the development of chimeric and humanized mAbs is important for therapeutic purpose. This is facilitated by a variety of molecular techniques like recombinant DNA technology and the better understanding of the structure and function of antibody. The human-mouse chimeric forms allow detailed analysis of the mechanism of inhibition and the potential for therapeutic applications. Here, a step-by-step description of the conversion process will be described. The commercial availability of the reagents required in each step means that this experimentation can be easily set up in research laboratories.",

Using heterologous sera in humans had its own limitations because of immunological reactions to serum proteins, for example, hypersensitivity. With the help of techniques for better purification of antibodies and monoclonal antibody (mAb) engineering, we now have overcome many of these complications and have attained improved specificity. Till recently, the main focus of the use of the recombinant mAb and passive immunotherapy had been for treatment of cancers or inflammatory conditions [1, 2] .",

            "text": "As vaccination is not always available or suitable, passive immunotherapy could be used to provide protection in the periods of high-exposure risk [3] . As immunotherapy is a promising approach to combat virus infection, much research efforts have been devoted to the generation and characterisation of virus-neutralizing mAbs [4] [5] [6] . In many laboratories, hybridoma clones are derived from mouse or rat B-lymphocytes by fusion with myeloma cell line (e.g., SP2/0, NS0, NS1, Ag8, or P3U1) [7] . One major limitation of using these hybridoma-derived mAbs is that human-antimouse or human-anti-rat antibody response can occur as a result of immunogenicity of these mouse or rat antibodies [4] . Therefore, it is important to humanize these antibodies for human therapeutic purposes without impacting their binding affinity towards antigen targets. For example, in virus research, after a mouse mAb is selected for its potent virus neutralizing activity, it will be useful to convert it into humanmouse chimeric form. If the human-mouse chimeric form has similar neutralizing activity; this will be a reason for further development for therapeutic application. Hence, the technique for converting mouse mAb into human-mouse chimeric form is an emerging research tool.",

For example, chimeric anti-human DR5 MAb (cmDRA6) can bind to DR5 antigen as demonstrated by both ELISA and Western blot [10] . In addition, a human-mouse chimeric antibody generated from mAb against hepatitis E virus (HEV) capsid proteins E2 still maintains binding activity similar to the original mAb as shown by ELISA and Western blot [11] . Since chimeric antibody is expected to be less immunogenic in human, it could be suitable for antibody therapy of viral infections. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that patient, who received chimeric antibody 17-1A, did not show any toxic or allergic reactions and the chimeric antibody appears significantly less immunogenic than its parental murine antibody [13] . The construction of human-mouse chimeric antibody basically involves cloning and ligating of the variable region genes of mouse mAbs into expression vectors, which have heavy-and light-chain immunoglobulin constant regions. A simple methodology for this conversion will be described here in a step-by-step manner.",

Increase the annealing temperature by steps of two degrees if many non-specific PCR products are found. (3) Multiple bands may be present on DNA gel per reaction but purify DNA from band of expected size only (approximately 500 bp). Depending on hybridoma source, two PCR products for region may be obtained since one is from myeloma cells [24] . (4) Alternatively, IgBLAST can be used to verify correct sequence of and (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih .gov/igblast/index.html). (5) Restriction sites introduced to forward and reverse primers for amplifying are chosen based on restriction sites of pFUSEss-CHIg-hG1 in the 5 to 3 direction, including EcoRI, EcoRV, XhoI, and NheI. Restriction sites introduced to forward and reverse primers for amplifying are chosen based on restriction sites of pFUSE2ss-CLIg-hk in the 5 to 3 direction, including EcoRI, AgeI, BstEII, NcoI, and BsiWI. Avoid choosing the restriction site if it is also found within or sequence because short fragment of or after digestion can be ligated into the vector. (6) Other molar ratios of insert DNA to vector, such as 5 : 1 and 1 : 1, can also be performed at the same time. (7) After overnight growth, HEK 293-FT cells should be around 80-90% confluent for optimal transfection. (8) Since the HEK 293-FT cells can be easily dislodged, the media should be gently aspirated and added to the same edge side of the dish. (9) The following protocol can be alternatively used to purify antibody from cell culture supernatant using HiTrap Protein G HP column:(i) attach HiTrap Protein G HP 1 mL column to a peristaltic pump and equilibrate by passing through 10-20 mL PBS at flow rate of less than 2 mL per minute, (ii) filter the culture supernatant through 0.45 m filter to remove any cell debris and dilute the filtrate with one volume of PBS, (iii) pass the diluted filtrate and then 10-20 mL PBS through the HiTrap column at flow rate of 1 mL per min, (iv) elute antibody using elution buffer 0.05 M Glycine-HCl, pH 2.7, (v) collect and check pH of each 0.5 mL fraction, (vi) add 2.5 L of 5 M NaOH for fraction with pH at around 2.7 to return pH to 7-8.",
