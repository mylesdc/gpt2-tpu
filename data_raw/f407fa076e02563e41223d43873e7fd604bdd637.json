In CQ-treated cells, the synthesis of viral RNA, DNA and proteins was significantly higher and occurred earlier than in control cells. CQ facilitates B19V infection by minimizing intracellular degradation of incoming particles. Only amodiaquine amongst other antimalarial drugs had a similar effect. B19V IgM seropositivity was more frequent in 111 children with severe anemia (hemoglobin ,50 g/L) than in 89 healthy controls (15.3% vs 3.4%; P = 0.008). In children who were either B19V IgM or PCR positive, 4-aminoquinoline use was associated with a significantly lower admission hemoglobin concentration.",

The virus is readily transmitted via the respiratory route and has a worldwide distribution. Seroprevalence increases with age and 50%-80% of adults have detectable B19-specific antibody. Since its discovery in 1975 [1] , B19V has been associated with an expanding range of clinical disorders that reflect the patient's immunologic and hematologic status. In healthy individuals, B19V typically causes a mild childhood febrile illness known as erythema infectiosum or fifth disease. More severe manifestations of B19V infection are arthropathies, aplastic anemia, hydrops fetalis and fetal death [2] .",

At the height of viremia, there is an abrupt fall in the reticulocyte count and anemia can supervene. Although this is rarely apparent in healthy patients, it can have serious clinical consequences where there is pre-existing anemia [2] . A case in point is malaria. B19V co-infection has been considered a significant risk for severe anemia in children living in malaria-endemic regions [3] . Studies examining the inter-relationship between malaria, B19V infection and anemia have, however, produced inconsistent results. In a retrospective study from Papua New Guinea (PNG) [4] , 60% of children ,2 years of age and 90% of 6 year-olds were B19V seropositive. B19V infection was significantly associated with severe anemia even in the absence of risk factors including malaria. Similar results were obtained in children from the Republic of Niger [5] . However, studies from Malawi and Kenya did not show evidence that B19V infection contributes to anemia in children and the seroprevalence of B19V was relatively low [6, 7] .",

In addition, a serosurvey performed in Eritrea at a time when CQ was the first-line agent also revealed an unusually high B19V seroprevalence [8] . By contrast, CQ had been discontinued in Malawi because of resistance of local strains of Plasmodium falciparum and its use was declining in Kenya when the B19V seroprevalence studies were conducted [6, 7] . Although CQ has, in addition to antimalarial efficacy, broad antiviral activity [9, 10] , it also enhances Semliki Forest virus (SFV) and encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) infection in mice [11] , and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) expression [12] . The latter effect is thought to play a role in the higher incidence of EBV-induced Burkitt's lymphoma in malaria-endemic areas where CQ is in common use [13] .",

The infection usually resolves without consequence in healthy individuals. However, in patients with immunologic and/or hematologic disorders, B19V can cause a significant pathology. The virus infects and kills red cell precursors but anemia rarely supervenes unless there is pre-existing anemia such as in children living in malariaendemic regions. The link between B19V infection and severe anemia has, however, only been confirmed in certain malaria-endemic countries in parallel with chloroquine (CQ) usage. This raises the possibility that CQ may increase the risk of severe anemia by promoting B19V infection. To test this hypothesis, we examined the direct effect of CQ and other commonly used antimalarial drugs on B19V infection in cultured cell lines. Additionally, we examined the correlation between B19V infection, hemoglobin levels and use of CQ in children from Papua New Guinea hospitalized with severe anemia. The results suggest strongly that CQ and its derivatives aggravate B19V-associated anemia by promoting B19V replication. Hence, careful consideration should be given in choosing the drug partnering artemisinin compounds in combination antimalarial therapy in order to minimize contribution of B19V to severe anemia.",

            "text": "Apart from its antimalarial effects, CQ has a wide antiviral activity. One of the most important mechanisms of action against viruses is the alkalinization of the endosomal vesicles. In this way, CQ is active against viruses that require a low pH step for cell entry, such as flavivirus, retrovirus and coronavirus [9] . All parvoviruses studied to date also depend on endosomal acidification for cell entry because it facilitates capsid structural transitions [21, 22] , and in particular the externalization of the N-terminal region of VP1 which is required for endosomal escape and nuclear targeting [23] . Accordingly, CQ inhibits parvovirus infections. However, we have previously shown that B19V is unique among parvoviruses in that N-VP1 is already externalized on receptor binding [17] and thus not dependent on a low endosomal pH for this critical conformational change. B19V is also unique among parvoviruses for its higher sensitivity to acid degradation [24] . Consequently, CQ-associated alkalinization of endosomal vesicles would be expected to minimize the acidic degradation of incoming B19V particles. Our data confirm that the intracellular degradation of B19V is prevented or minimized in the presence of CQ or AQ. However, other lysosomotropic drugs such as ammonium chloride or bafilomycin A1, which also raise the endosomal pH, had an inhibitory effect on B19V infection in our in vitro system (data not shown). Therefore, the mechanism underlying the stabilization of B19V by CQ or AQ is likely to extend beyond pH-neutralizing activity to destabilization of endosome/lysosome membranes typically observed in CQ-treated cells. In this way, CQ would facilitate the endosomal escape of B19V before it reaches the degradative lysosomal compartment and increase the number of particles that can target the nuclei for replication. This is of particular importance since nuclear targeting Chloroquine Promotes B19V Infection www.plosntds.org has been identified as a major limiting factor in parvovirus infections [22, 25] .",

            "text": "The plausibility of our in vitro observations as an explanation of epidemiological data depends on the pharmacological properties of CQ, especially tissue concentrations. The in vitro enhancement of B19V infection by CQ was achieved at concentrations (10-75 mM) that were well above those achieved in plasma after therapeutic doses in children (typically ,5 mM) [18] . However, Chloroquine Promotes B19V Infection www.plosntds.org B19V does not replicate in plasma but in tissues, primarily the bone marrow. CQ concentrations in bone marrow are substantially higher than in plasma [26] and have been measured at approximately 100 mM in animal studies [27] . This could reflect, in part, concentration of the drug within precursor cells such as has been observed in circulating erythrocytes [28] . The long terminal elimination half-life of CQ (around 10 days in children) [18] means that conditions favorable to B19V viral replication in bone marrow may persist for several weeks after dosing. In many malaria-endemic regions, antimalarial therapy is given empirically to febrile children without blood smear confirmation. Ironically this might include fever due to B19V itself. The administration of frequent courses of CQ may mean that a child spends long periods of each year at risk of CQ-associated enhanced B19V viremia and its consequences such as anemia.",

In our 200 unselected PNG children who were participants in a case-control study of severe pediatric infections, we confirmed previous reports that B19V seropositivity is associated with severe anemia and that the lowest hemoglobin concentrations are in those children who had acute infections (i.e. both IgM and PCR positive) [4] . Although there were limited numbers, there was some evidence that prior 4aminoquinoline, especially CQ, use exacerbates B19V-associated severe anemia apart from in those IgM-and PCR-positive cases who were presumably at the stage of maximal viral replication and consequent bone marrow suppression. Properly designed epidemiological studies in larger, non-convenience samples are, however, needed to confirm these findings.Although CQ is a safe and inexpensive antimalarial drug, the increasing emergence of resistant P. falciparum and P. vivax has seen its use decline throughout the tropics. Our data suggest that the prevalence of severe malarial anemia should also fall as a result. However, when an effective B19V vaccine becomes available, this should be considered a priority intervention where pediatric B19V seroprevalence rates are high and other causes of anemia such as nutritional deficiency and intestinal parasitic infection are present. Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) is the current WHO-recommended first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria [29] . Our data suggest that, pending more definitive in vivo data including appropriately designed clinical trials, a non-4aminoquinoline drug should be preferred to partner the artemisinin derivative so that the contribution of B19V to severe anemia is minimized.",
