We define the first generation of cases to be all those infected by primary (i.e. zero-generation) cases, the second generation of cases to be all those infected by first generation cases, and so on. We define a chain to be a single primary infection plus all subsequent infections that are linked to it. We define an infection cluster as a group of chains that overlap in time and space so that the constituent chains may be hard to discern (sometimes referred to as an outbreak in the literature).

If we focus on cases where k is an integer, this relates to the interpretation of the negative binomial distribution as the number of tails that occur in a sequence of coin flips before k heads occur. In our case the coin has a probability of k R eff +k for flipping as a head. Repeating this process with i coins (analogous to observing how many offspring are generated by i cases), is analogous to flipping one coin until ki tails occur, which is just a new negative binomial distribution with the aforementioned scaling of the mean and dispersion parameter.",

However, since animal-to-human exposures are only observed when at least one human infection occurs, the probability of observing j cases from a point-exposure event is determined by normalizing the true probability of j transmission events by the probability that no animal-to-human transmission occurs.

The model assumes that primary cases are infected at random and that secondary infection occurs in proportion to the number of contacts an infected individual has [6] . Thus there is an implicit assumption that heterogeneity in disease transmission is entirely due to variability in the number of social contacts. This implies that secondary cases may transmit more than primary cases because the individuals with the most contacts are most likely to become secondary cases and in turn spread disease to many others.
