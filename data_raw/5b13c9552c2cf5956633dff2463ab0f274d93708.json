The long-term trend of surface PM concentration in the SMA declined in the 2000s, but since 2012 its concentrations have tended to incline, which is coincident with frequent severe hazes in South Korea. This increase puts the Korean government's emission reduction efforts in jeopardy. This study reports that interannual variation of surface PM concentration in South Korea is closely linked with the interannual variations of wind speed. A 12-year (2004-2015) regional air quality simulation was conducted over East Asia (27-km) and over South Korea (9-km) to assess the impact of meteorology under constant anthropogenic emissions. Simulated PM concentrations show a strong negative correlation (i.e. R = \u22120.86) with regional wind speed, implying that reduced regional ventilation is likely associated with more stagnant conditions that cause severe pollutant episodes in South Korea. We conclude that the current PM concentration trend in South Korea is a combination of long-term decline by emission control efforts and short-term fluctuation of regional wind speed interannual variability. When the meteorology-driven variations are removed, PM concentrations in South Korea have declined continuously even after 2012.",

A 12-year simulation with a constant anthropogenic emission inventory was designed to isolate the interannual variation of surface PM concentrations solely due to variations of meteorology (See method). After testing multiple meteorological variables, we found a significant association of wind speed and surface PM concentrations. Normalized anomalies (annual averages subtracted and then divided by the 2004-2015 average) of surface PM concentration and 10-m wind speed averaged over three geographical coverages (i.e. 9-km domain-wide, Korea, and the SMA) are compared (Fig. 2) . Noticeably, interannual variations of modeled surface PM concentrations show very similar patterns in all regions. The observed PM, averaged over 247 sites in South Korea, shows similar but slightly different interannual variability. Its year-to-year variation pattern is very similar to that of modeled variation; a small drop in 2004, strong positives in 2005-2007, strong negative in 2012, and an increase in 2013-2014. Its general pattern, however, is mostly positive in early years and negative in later years. It thus seems reasonable to say that the observations show mixed signals; likely a combination of a short-term year-to-year fluctuations (caused by meteorological changes) and a long-term decline (caused by changes in anthropogenic emissions) 25 .",

The key feature from the interannual variations of surface PM concentrations and surface wind is that they show totally opposite phases in their interannual variabilities. It should be noted that the interannual variations of PM concentrations, in all three regions, are best explained by the changes of domain-wide averaged wind speed compared with smaller scale averages. This might imply that the controlling mechanism is not on a local scale (e.g. sea breeze or local circulation) but rather synoptic scale activities (e.g. frontal passage). Considering the efficiency of the wipe-out mechanism by cold frontal activities, the annual wind speed variability seems to represent the efficiency of regional ventilation 26 . Northeastern Asia is a routine passage of mid-latitude cyclogenesis, initiated on the lee side of the Altai-Sayan Mountains 27 . The role of Altai-Sayan cyclogenesis, as an efficient cleaning mechanism of pollutants over northern China and Korea during cool season, is demonstrated and discussed in Kim et al. 28 . The change of summertime circulation (i.e. East Asia summer monsoon) on regional pollution is also discussed in Zhu et al. 29 .",

The most likely explanation for this decrease is the impact of the global recession during 2008-2009, as indicated by several previous researches 33, 34 . At this point, we are not able to distinguish if the impact is due to changes caused by the South Korean economy's experience of the global recession, or due to changes of transported pollutants and precursors by Chinese economic changes. The case of 2015 is also interesting. PM concentration was higher in early 2015 (64.1 \u03bcg/m 3 in 2014 Jan-Mar and 72.5 \u03bcg/m 3 in 2015 Jan-Mar), but the annual mean is lower than that of 2014 because its Spring-to-Fall concentration is very low, even with the weakest wind speed observed. This is likely an extraordinary case by the impact of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), which has seriously impacted the South Korean economy and society 35 . Although further investigations are necessary, these cases in 2008 and 2015 may provide interesting examples of the socio-economic impact on the environment, in addition to emission control policy-driven impact. Three factors, long-term trend by emission control, short-term variation by meteorology, and sporadic offsets by unexpected social or economic episodes, seem to be affecting PM concentrations in South Korea.",

This study addresses several important implications. First, interannual variation of meteorological conditions has the strong potential to affect long-term trends in surface PM pollution events. At this point, we do not have any evidence that the reduced wind speed is part of long-term change or just short-term fluctuation in general circulations or ventilation patterns. However, it is worth further investigation since the frequency of mid-latitude cyclones can be reduced in warmer weather conditions, as suggested through observations [36] [37] [38] [39] and models studies 19, 40-42 . Mickley et al. 19 used the Goddard Institute of Space Studies model to demonstrate that the severity and duration of summertime regional pollution can increase due to a decline in the frequency of mid-latitude cyclones under future warmer climates. This may provide a key feature to understand the frequent occurrence of severe haze episodes not only in South Korea but also in East Asia, especially in northern China. Yang et al. 43 also demonstrated haze days over eastern China has increased between 1980 and 2014, and argued that the weakening of winds is the dominant factor leading the decadal increase.",

Underestimation of surface PM concentration is somehow expected, due to the lack of natural emission sources, e.g. Asian dust and wildfire emissions. However, the possible contribution of overestimated surface wind speed should also be considered. If we apply the correlation PM [%] = \u22122.1 \u00b7 WS [%] from Fig. 2C, then reducing wind speed from 3.3 m/s to 2.2 m/s (i.e. \u221230%) can increase PM concentration from 27.9 \u03bcg/m 3 to 45.5 \u03bcg/m 3 (i.e. +63%), which can explain the 71% of current PM simulation bias (i.e. (45.5-27.9)/(52.6-27.9) = 71%).",

The 27-km East Asia domain was chosen to cover possible interactions among international emissions from neighboring countries (e.g. China, Japan, and North Korea), and provides boundary conditions for the 9-km simulation. The 9-km domain then covers the entire of South Korea. The geographical coverage of domains and locations of surface monitoring sites are shown in the supplementary material.For meteorology, WRF (version 3.3.1)46 was initiated with the National Center for Environmental Protection (NCEP) Final Analysis (FNL) product47 . Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) Digital Elevation Model (DEM) with 90-m resolution and Korean Ministry of Environment Land Use Land Cover data were used for terrain and surface land type, respectively. The Meteorology-Chemistry Interface Processor (MCIP, version 3.6) was used as a preprocessor for CMAQ simulation. CMAQ (version 4.7.1) 48 with AERO5 aerosol module 49 and the Statewide Air Pollution Research Center version 99 (SAPRC99) 50 , were chosen as the gas-phase chemical mechanism. An emission inventory set, Clean Air Policy Support System (CAPSS) 2007 for South Korea and Intercontinental Chemical Transport Experiment Phase-B (INTEX-B) 2006 emission inventory for other Asian countries, were used for the 12-year simulation to isolate the impact of interannual variability of anthropogenic emissions. At the same time, an additional choice for the recent emission inventory set, the Model Inter-Comparison Study for Asia (MICS-Asia) 2010 and CAPSS 2010, was also used to check whether there was any dependency on the choice of emission inventory. However, the simulated surface PM concentrations from both emission inventory sets show almost identical interannual fluctuations of PM concentrations, as expected. The 2006 INTEX-B emission inventory provides emissions for eight species, SO 2 , NO x , CO, NMVOC, PM 10 , PM 2.5 , BC, and OC. Data are available for four emission sectors (power plants, industry, residential, and transportation) over 22 countries and regions in Asia (http://mic.greenresource.cn/intex-b2006) 51 . For domestic South Korean emissions, the CAPSS emission inventories were utilized, which provided emission information on point for on-road and non-road emission sectors. Emission sources are classified into four levels: 12 upper level categories, 54 intermediate level categories, 312 lower level categories, and 527 detail level categories. The upper level categories include combustion in energy industries (point sector), non-industrial combustion plants, combustion in manufacturing industries, production processes, storage and distribution of fuels (point and area sector), solvent use, other mobile sources and machinery (mobile sector), waste treatment and disposal (point sector), agriculture, other sources and sinks (area sector), and fugitive dust (mobile and area sector) categories. Emissions for CO, NOx, SOx, PM 10 , and VOCs are available for each upper level category except fugitive dust emissions 5 .
