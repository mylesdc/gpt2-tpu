Four of the 111 genes disrupted in clones selected for resistance to infection by reovirus type 1 involved the insulin growth factor-2 (IGF-II) pathway, including: the mannose-6-phosphate/IGF2 receptor (Igf2r), a protease associated with insulin growth factor binding protein 5 (Prss11), and the CTCF transcriptional regulator (Ctcf). The disruption of Ctcf, which encodes a repressor of Igf2, was associated with enhanced Igf2 gene expression. Plasmids expressing either the IGF-II pro-hormone or IGF-II without the carboxy terminal extension (E)-peptide sequence independently conferred high levels of cellular resistance to reovirus infection. Forced IGF-II expression results in a block in virus disassembly. In addition, Ctcf disruption and forced Igf2 expression both enabled cells to proliferate in soft agar, a phenotype associated with malignant growth in vivo.",

This suggests that host cell contributions to the virus life cycle, although complex, have genetic determinants. We therefore used a genetic approach to identify cellular genes required for infection by reovirus, a small cytolytic RNA virus that replicates in the cytoplasm. A gene trap retrovirus was use to create libraries of rat intestinal epithelial (RIE-1) cell clones in which each clone contained a single gene disrupted by an integrated retrovirus. The mutant libraries were then infected with reovirus, and resistant clones were selected. We hypothesized that genes mutated by gene entrapment may confer reovirus resistance as a result of either haploinsufficiency or loss of heterozygosity and could be identified by characterizing the genes disrupted by the entrapment vector. From these experiments we have isolated 152 clones and have characterized mutations in 111 different genes, providing potential candidates required for reovirus infection and/or cell killing. Many of the disrupted genes have known or imputed functions, and several are known to function in the same or related pathways. For example, four mutations affected genes in the insulin growth factor-2 (IGF-II) pathway, including genes encoding the IGF-ll/manose-6-phosphate receptor [5, 6] (Igf2r, locus ID 25151), the IGF binding protein 5 protease [7] (Prss11, locus ID 65164, 2 clones), and CTCF (Ctcf, locus ID 83726), a transcriptional repressor of the IGF-II gene (Igf2) involved in paternal imprinting.",

Moreover, forced expression of IGF-II in RIE-1 cells was sufficient to confer cellular resistance to lytic reovirus infection.

Unfortunately, cells persistently infected with reovirus (PI) can emerge at high frequencies (one in 10 2 -10 3 ) and are intrinsically resistant to the virus [9, 10] . In preliminary studies, we found that hepa 1/a cells were not suitable for genetic studies due to the emergence of PI clones. However, persistently infected rat intestinal epithelial cells (RIE-1) [11, 12] were found to require a serum survival factor and die when placed in serum free media ( Figure 1 ). In vitro infection of RIE-1 cells with reovirus also appears to mirror virus replication in the rodent host [13] [14] [15] . Consequently, RIE-1 cells were used in the present study, and reovirus-resistant clones were selected in serum-free medium to remove PI survivors. RIE-1 cells were mutagenized by using the U3NeoSV1 gene trap shuttle vector [16] (see Methods) and the resulting libraries of mutagenized cells were infected with reovirus serotype 1/ Lang at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 35, to select for clones resistant to lytic infection. The isolated clones did not express reoviral antigens, and did not produce infectious virus as assessed by plaque assay, suggesting these reovirus resistant clones were not PI.",

The insert in Igf2r was found to decrease the expression of the gene as assayed by northern blot analysis (data not shown). As IGF-II targets the igf2r to lysosomal degradation, mutations in the genes encoding either the receptor (Igf2r) or its ligand (Igf2) will affect the activity of the other, and result in a reduced endosomal trafficking of hydrolases necessary for reovirus disassembly [24] . Our data indicates there is a decrease in virus disassembly in 6B72 cells, consistent with a block at Anchorage-independent growth phenotypes of RIE-1 cell clones Figure 9 Anchorage-independent growth phenotypes of RIE-1 cell clones. 10 5 cells were suspended in media containing 1% agarose and plated in 6 well culture dishes. RIE-1 cells acquire the ability to grow in soft agar after being transfected with a vector expressing pro-IGF2 but not the IGF2 SV splice-variant (a). The vector inserted in the Ctcf gene (6B72) confers the ability to grow in soft agar, but the phenotype is suppressed by expression of IGF2 SV (b). Clones selected for reovirus resistance with gene trap vectors inserted into the Prss11, Igf2r and Anxa2 genes failed to grow in soft agar (c). RIE-1 cells expressing native IGF-II protein without the E-peptide grew in soft agar but the colonies were smaller (d) than produced by pro-IGF-2 (a), while the corresponding IGF-II A62T protein (E-peptide) did not transform RIE-1 cells to anchorage independence (d).

By using constructs that encode the mature hormone without the E-peptide, we were able to show that forced IGF-II expression is sufficient to confer a reovirus resistant phenotype.

The alternative splice site is used very infrequently [only one EST (AA259833) in dbEST was similarly spliced] and thus probably plays no physiological role. Further studies are planned to determine molecular basis for the dominant negative activity of Igf2 sv . 6B72 cells were highly resistant to reovirus infection as determined by virus yield and cell survival at different times post-infection. Virus resistance was a genetically selected trait manifested by clonally pure cell populations, could be conferred by enforced IGF-II expression, and involved decreases in virus disassembly. Although decreased virus disassembly is sufficient to explain virus resistance, we do not exclude the possibility that other mechanisms may contribute to the resistance of 6B72 cells, since any genetic selection may generate clones with multiple, independent mutations. The fact that an early step in infection (uptake/disassembly) is defective in 6B72 cells makes it very difficult to test whether downstream steps might also be affected.",

These results indicate that IGF-II, and by inference other components of the IGF-II signaling pathway, can confer high levels of resistance to lytic reovirus infection. IGF-II expression specifically blocked virus disassembly. Ctcf disruption and forced Igf2 expression both enabled cells to proliferate in soft agar, a phenotype associated with malignant growth in vivo. Therefore, these results illustrate a potential indirect mechanism of viral carcinogenesis by which cells selected to virus resistance may also have enhanced oncogenic potential.",

Twenty libraries of mutant RIE-1 cells, each consisting of 10 4 independent gene entrapment events, were generated and expanded until each mutant clone was represented by approximately 10 3 sibling cells. These cells were plated at low density and incubated in serum-free media for 3 days until they became quiescent, infected overnight with reovirus serotype 1 at a multiplicity of infection of 30 plaque forming units (pfu) per cell. The infected cells were detached with trypsin, DMEM medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Hyclone Laboratories, Inc., Logan, UT, USA) was added and the cells were allowed to reattach. After 4-6 hours the medium was replaced with serum-free medium and the cells were incubated for several days until only a few cells remained attached to the culture flask. Cells that survived the selection were allowed to form colonies that were expanded for further analysis.",
