Here, viral cell-binding proteins and their cognate cellular receptors were investigated using two ranaviruses, Andrias davidianus ranavirus (ADRV) and Rana grylio virus (RGV), and two different cell lines, Chinese giant salamander thymus cells (GSTC) and Epithelioma papulosum cyprinid (EPC) cells. The heparan sulfate (HS) analog heparin inhibited plaque formation of ADRV and RGV in the two cell lines by more than 80% at a concentration of 5 \u00b5g/mL. In addition, enzymatic removal of cell surface HS by heparinase I markedly reduced plaque formation by both viruses and competition with heparin reduced virus-cell binding.",

To our knowledge, this is the first report identifying cell surface HS as ranavirus binding factor and furthers understanding of interactions between ranaviruses and host cells.",

Likewise, aquatic animal viruses can also infect and cause disease in a wide range of aquatic animals [3, 4] . Specifically, the interspecies infection was reported following ranavirus infection [5, 6] . However, the basis for the broad ranavirus host range is not clear [7, 8] . Ranaviruses are large double-stranded DNA viruses within the family Iridoviridae [9] . Ranaviruses target aquatic animals globally and have been isolated from reptiles [10, 11] , amphibians [12] [13] [14] [15] , and bony fish [16, 17] . Among them, several isolates represent great threats to the development of the aquaculture industry and wild animal populations [18] . Aside from infecting several species within a given taxonomic class (e.g., frog virus 3 infects diverse amphibian species), ranaviruses may also infect members of different classes (e.g., frog virus 3-like agents have been isolated from both amphibians and fish) [19] .",

The complete genomes of the two viruses have been sequenced, and several functional proteins have been characterized [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] . For example, RGV-53R, a homolog of ADRV-58L, was identified as an envelope protein [38] . Decreased expression of RGV-53R, or its frog virus 3 (FV3) homolog FV3-53R impaired virus replication in cultured cells [45, 46] . In this report, we examine the role of HS in ranavirus entry. Furthermore, since ranavirus viral envelope proteins [38] [39] [40] [45] [46] [47] [48] are likely involved in the initial interaction between virus and host, we examined the ability of RGV-53R and its ADRV homolog, ADVR-58L, to bind heparin-Sepharose beads.",

The cells, washed twice with fresh medium, were collected by centrifugation, and DNA was extracted with the TakaRa MiniBEST Universal Genomic DNA Extraction Kit (TakaRa, Tokyo, Japan).

For the MCP detection, MCP levels were normalized to \u03b2-actin levels in each sample. The level of bound virus (MCP level) in the treated group versus that in the control group (no heparin) was calculated by the 2 \u2212\u2206\u2206CT method [53] .",

Here we examine the role that viral envelope proteins play in this process by monitoring the interaction of purified recombinant viral envelope protein with heparin-Sepharose beads. To accomplish this, the amino terminal 192 amino acids of ADRV-58L and RGV-53R and the C-terminal region of ADRV-58L (amino acids 238-522) were cloned into pET32a and pET28a and expressed in E. coli (Figure 5a ). Because the amino acid sequences of the C-terminal regions of ADRV-58L and RGV-53R are identical, only the C-terminal region of ADRV-58L was expressed. Note the recombinant proteins were increased in size, due to a 17 kDa Trx-His-S tag in pET32a, and a 4 kDa His-T7 tag in pET28a. As shown in Figure 5b ,c, recombinant proteins of the expected sizes were generated using the two expression systems. Subsequently, purified recombinant proteins were isolated and incubated with heparin-Sepharose beads or control beads lacking heparin. The three recombinant proteins (r58L-N, r53R-N, and r58L-C), expressed using either pET32a or pET28a, bound heparin-sepharose beads and were eluted in the presence of a high salt wash. In contrast, all three recombinant proteins failed to bind sepharose beads lacking heparin, and, as a result, were present in the unbound supernatant (S) fraction (Figure 5d ). When considered together, these results support the view that HS is a cellular receptor for both ADRV and RGV and the binding fashion may be similar to the interaction between 53R/58L and heparin that occurred in vitro.",

Here we examine the role that viral envelope proteins play in this process by monitoring the interaction of purified recombinant viral envelope protein with heparin-Sepharose beads. To accomplish this, the amino terminal 192 amino acids of ADRV-58L and RGV-53R and the C-terminal region of ADRV-58L (amino acids 238-522) were cloned into pET32a and pET28a and expressed in E. coli (Figure 5a ). Because the amino acid sequences of the C-terminal regions of ADRV-58L and RGV-53R are identical, only the C-terminal region of ADRV-58L was expressed. Note the recombinant proteins were increased in size, due to a 17 kDa Trx-His-S tag in pET32a, and a 4 kDa His-T7 tag in pET28a. As shown in Figure 5b ,c, recombinant proteins of the expected sizes were generated using the two expression systems. Subsequently, purified recombinant proteins were isolated and incubated with heparin-Sepharose beads or control beads lacking heparin. The three recombinant proteins (r58L-N, r53R-N, and r58L-C), expressed using either pET32a or pET28a, bound heparin-sepharose beads and were eluted in the presence of a high salt wash. In contrast, all three recombinant proteins failed to bind sepharose beads lacking heparin, and, as a result, were present in the unbound supernatant (S) fraction (Figure 5d ). When considered together, these results support the view that HS is a cellular receptor for both ADRV and RGV and the binding fashion may be similar to the interaction between 53R/58L and heparin that occurred in vitro.

Binding to cell surface GAGs, including HS, has proved to be the initial event in the entry of several mammalian viruses [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] . Because GAGs are linked to proteins and usually exist as proteoglycans in vivo [26] , viral envelope proteins may bind to cell surface heparan sulfate-linked proteins and facilitate attachment between the virus and potential host cells. Our results suggest that binding of cell surface HS is required for initiation of productive infection by ranaviruses. However, since competition by increasing concentrations of heparin or HS, or treatment with heparinase did not completely inhibit plaque formation, it appears that HS is not the sole cellular receptor for ranaviruses. A similar phenomenon has been observed in the binding of the vaccinia virus, which uses cell surface GAGs and cellular matrix laminin as receptors [22] [23] [24] [25] . A recent study showed that class A scavenger receptors are utilized by frog virus 3, the type species of the genus Ranavirus [54] . Additional ranavirus binding factors and specific cellular protein receptors may be involved in viral attachment and entry. In addition, although the host range of ranaviruses could be determined by binding to other cellular proteins, binding to cell surface GAGs likely plays an important role in the initial interaction between virus and host cell.",

Thus, the existence of different virions that have an outer envelope or not could be another reason for the incomplete inhibition efficiency in the present study. This is a report showing that iridoviruses bind cells of different species through the interaction between cell surface GAGs and envelope proteins.
