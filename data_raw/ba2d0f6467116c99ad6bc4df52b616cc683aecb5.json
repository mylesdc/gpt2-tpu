The results validate the clinical diagnosis, and suggest that more attention to bacterial communities in children with chronic cough may lead to more rapid recognition of this condition with earlier treatment and reduction in disease burden. PLOS Introduction Persistent or protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) is a leading cause of chronic wet cough lasting more than 4 weeks in young children. PBB is particularly common in pre-school children, often developing after a viral lower respiratory infection [1, 2] , but may present at any age. As a result, PBB is often either misdiagnosed as asthma or the symptoms are dismissed as being due to recurrent viral infection [1] [2] [3] . Standard treatment for PBB is high dose oral antibiotics, the cough typically taking 10-14 days to resolve [4] . Although the aim of therapy is to provide a definitive cure, reoccurrences are frequent and if not treated successfully may lead to bronchiectasis [1] [2] [3] [4] .",

This failure to recognize organisms in chronic airways diseases may account in part for the 'negative' culture results from BAL and sputum samples that are frequently encountered in the presence of purulent secretions. This may be of particular importance when it comes to Neisseria species, which are commonly found to colonise the nasopharyngeal mucosa [22] . Despite many Neisseria species being considered non-pathogenic, they have been implicated in cases of pneumonia [23] , periodontal disease [22] and COPD [24] . No significant differences in the bacterial community of PBB patients whose parents were smokers compared to non-smokers were found. However, due to the low number of individuals in this study we cannot exclude smoking having an effect on the bacterial communities of children. It would be important to expand this research to include a much larger sample set to investigate this further.",

No difference in the bacterial community was associated with a diagnosis of wheeze however, this may due to insufficient power. The impact of PBB on the pulmonary microbiome In this study nose and throat samples were collected from mothers of children under 2 years old and compared with the results from the lower airways of their offspring. Nose swabs from mothers were significantly different from their own throat swabs, showing that there are major differences between these areas of the upper respiratory tract. Previous studies have shown that unlike the nose the bacterial community from the throat is more similar to that of the lower airways [11] . It was hypothesised that the bacterial community present in the respiratory tract of mothers and children would therefore potentially share similarities, due to their close proximity and shared environments when children are under 2 years of age. In the majority of cases however, the community composition of the mothers' samples were significantly different from their children. Only a single case was observed where the maternal oropharyngeal community and their child's lower airway bacterial communities were similar, and these samples were found to be dominated by the same organism.",

This has resulted in many paediatric studies either sampling the upper respiratory tract [26] or including \"controls\" with other respiratory indications [9, 11] . Hilty et al. observed a decrease in the Proteobacteria and an increase in Bacteroidetes in controls compared to asthmatics, although only 3 of their 7 controls had no respiratory symptoms [11] . The current study demonstrates that the data generated from a blind brushing via an ET tube is comparable to that obtained by visualization using bronchoscopy, the so-called non-blind brush, allowing the inclusion of healthy children attending the hospital for reasons unrelated to respiratory symptoms.",

This is due to the high levels of dominance of Haemophilus, Neisseria, Streptococcus and Moraxella. In many cases the dominant organisms by sequencing were not those identified by culture. This study is the first step in using next generation sequencing methods to increase our understanding of the bacterial community within the lungs of children with PBB. These methods have the potential to lead to quicker more effective treatments, reducing the risk of recurrence or disease progression. ",
