            "text": "Aberrant glycosylation of cell surface glycoprotein due to specific alterations of glycosyltransferase activity is usually associated with invasion and metastasis of cancer, particularly of gastric carcinomas. Polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 2 (ppGalNAc-T2), which catalyzes initiation of mucin-type O-glycosylation, is also involved in tumor migration and invasion. However, a comprehensive understanding of how ppGalNAc-T2 correlates with the metastasic potential of human gastric cancer is not currently available. In the present study, ppGalNAc-T2 was detected in a variety of human poorly differentiated tumor cells, and expression appeared to be higher in SGC7901 gastric cancer cells. In addition, we investigated the potential effects of ppGalNAc-T2 on growth and metastasis-associated behavior in SGC7901 cells after stable transfection with ppGalNAc-T2 sense and antisense vectors. We found that cell proliferation, adhesion and invasion were decreased in ppGalNAc-T2 overexpressed cells but increased in ppGalNAc-T2 downregulated cells. Therefore, we attempted to clarify the mechanisms underlying the anti-metastatic activities of ppGalNAc-T2. Further investigation indicated that overexpression of ppGalNAc-T2 is involved in the inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 expression at both the protein and mRNA levels, which may be associated with ppGalNAc-T2 suppressing the expression of transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21. However, it did not exhibit any apparent correlation with MMP-14 expression levels. Our data show the effect of ppGalNAc-T2 on proliferation, adhesion or invasion of SGC7901 gastric cancer cells, suggesting that ppGalNAc-T2 may exert anti-proliferative and anti-metastatic activity through the decrease of MMP-2 and TGF-\u03b21. These results indicate that ppGalNAc-T2 may be used as a novel therapeutic target for human gastric cancer treatment.",

Aberrant glycosylation of membrane components due to specific alterations of glycosyltransferase activity is a common feature of carcinoma cells and is usually associated with invasion and metastasis of cancer. For example, GCNT2, which is a gene-encoding glucosaminyl (N-acetyl) transferase 2, contributes to breast cancer metastasis with preferential expression in basal-like breast cancer (2) . ST6Gal-I expression in ovarian cancer cells promotes an invasive phenotype by altering integrin glycosylation and function (3) . Since aberrant glycoproteins as a result of these enzymes may be involved in promoting tumor invasion and metastasis, these enzymes could also be used as cancer biomarkers (4) . Therefore, cancer-specific changes in the expression of glycosyltransferases exhibit the most marked and consistent change of activity in tumorigenesis.",

Several reports indicate a complexity in glycosyltransferase activities which lead to several tumor associated carbohydrate structures in gastric carcinoma. Glycosyltransferase mRNA expression has been found to be significantly altered in gastric carcinomas isolated from surgical specimens (5) . Upregulation of glycan:sulfotransferase activities and downregulation of \u03b1,2-fucosyltransferase activity appear to be associated with human gastric tumorigenesis (6). Shimizu et al (7) confirmed that \u03b14GnT, which forms a unique glycan, GlcNAc\u03b11-->4Gal\u03b2-->R, is detectable in 80% of 5 patients with an early stage of gastric cancer and the expression level of \u03b14GnT mRNA is increased in association with tumor progression. Recently, \u03b23Gn-T8, which can extend polylactosamine on N-glycan, was also reported to be involved in malignancy in gastric cancer cells (8) . However, our previous study demonstrated that polypeptide N-acetylgal actosaminyltransferase 2 (ppGalNAc-T2) was also involved in gastric cancer migration and invasion.",

All ppGalNAc-Ts in mammals are type II transmembrane proteins that have a Golgi lumenal region that contains a catalytic domain with glycosyltransferase activity and a C-terminal R-type lectin domain (9) . The human ppGalNAc-T family contains more than 18 members, each of which has unique transferase activity, different peptide substrate specificities, and dissimilar patterns of expression (10, 11) . Among all the ppGalNAc-Ts identified in mammals thus far, the ppGalNAc-T2 gene was highly expressed in cancer and may play an important role in the occurrence and development of tumor. Brooks et al (1) reported that levels of ppGalNAc-T2 expression may change with the differentiation of breast carcinoma. Mandel et al (12) showed that ppGalNAc-T2 expression was strong in poorly differentiated tumors. It has also been confirmed that ppGalNac-T2 is involved in vanadium-induced HL-60 cell differentiation (13) . Moreover, both acute T cell leukemia Jurkat cell lines and human heptocarcinoma HepG-2 cell lines clearly express ppGalNAc-T2 (14) . The invasion and metastasis of human glioma cells can also be regulated by ppGalNAc-T2 (15) . Our previous studies revealed that ppGalNAc-T2 expression appears to be higher in gastric cancer SGC7901 cells than in other poorly differentiated human cancer cells, indicating that ppGalNAc-T2 may play a vital role in the process of gastric cancer emergence and development. However, a comprehensive understanding of how ppGalNAc-T2 correlates with the invasive potential of human gastric cancer is not currently available.",

Thus, this study was undertaken to evaluate the role of ppGalNAc-T2 in gastric cancer invasion and metastasis by creating stable transfectants and evaluating them for invasive and metastatic potential in vitro. In order to elucidate the role of ppGalNAc-T2 in the gastric cancer metastasis process, SGC7901 cells were treated with ppGalNAc-T2 sense or antisense vectors and examined for the following: i) the relationship between the ppGalNAc-T2 expression and the cell proliferation, adhesion, and invasion ability, in order to clarify whether ppGalNAc-T2 is correlated with SGC7901 cell metastasis-associated behavior; ii) the impact of ppGalNAc-T2 on MMP-2, MMP-14 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21 regulation including mRNA and protein levels, to investigate the molecular mechanisms of the anti-metastasic activities in human gastric carcinoma. These data suggested that high expression of the ppGalNAc-T2 gene in gastric cancer SGC7901 cells might exert anti-growth and anti-metastasic activity through the decrease of MMP-2 and TGF-\u03b21. Our findings indicate that ppGalNAc-T2 is useful in regulating gastric carcinoma invasion and metastasis, and this may be used as a novel approach for cancer therapy.",

To investigate the potential role of ppGalNAc-T2 in human malignant tumors, we first detected the expression panel of ppGalNAc-T2 in 5 types of poorly differentiated malignant tumor cell lines. The mRNA level of ppGalNAc-T2 in these cells was determined by RT-PCR. All poorly differentiated tumor cells which have aberrant terminal sugar structures of O-glycan chains, including SGC7901 gastric cancer, SHG44 glioma, SHI-1 leukemia, A549 lung adenocarcinoma, and HO8910 ovarian cancer cells expressed ppGalNAc-T2 (Fig. 1) . Thus ppGalNAc-T2 may be markers for poorly differentiated carcinomas. In addition, we found that ppGalNAc-T2 mRNA was differentially expressed, as shown in Fig. 1A . The mRNA expression ratios (ppGalNAc-T2/\u03b2-actin) were 0.38\u00b10.016, 1.23\u00b10.017, 0.82\u00b10.035, 0.69\u00b10.014 and 0.78\u00b10.023, respectively.

To investigate whether the MMP-2 inhibitory effect of ppGalNAc-T2 resulted from the suppression of TGF-\u03b21 expression, TGF-\u03b21 mRNA and protein levels were measured. The SGC7901 cells transfected with ppGalNAc-T2 sense vectors exhibited a direct reduction at the levels of TGF-\u03b21 mRNA and protein (P<0.05) (Fig. 7) . Meanwhile, the expression of TGF-\u03b21 in the SGC7901-T2as group was contrary to that in the SGC7901-T2s group (P<0.05). The change of TGF-\u03b21 at the mRNA and protein level displayed a similar trend with that of MMP-2. These results suggest that the MMP-2 inhibitory effect by high expression of ppGalNAc-T2 is probably through regulation of TGF-\u03b21 expression.",

            "text": "Although multiple factors contribute to aberrant glycosylation in cancer, such as the availability and localization of nucleotide sugar donors and substrates, one of the primary mechanisms seems to be the differential expression of glycosyltransferases involved in the synthesis of glycans. Mucin-type linkages (GalNAc\u03b11-O-Ser/Thr) of proteins begin with the addition of a single GalNAc monosaccharide to a serine or threonine residue on the polypeptide. Attachment is catalyzed by a family of glycosyltransferases called the UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine: polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases (ppGalNAc-Ts, EC 2.4.1.41), which is a crucial regulatory step (17, 18) . These structural changes can alter the function of the cell, and its antigenic and adhesive properties, as well as its potential to invade and metastasize. PpGalNAc-T2, an important member of ppGalNAc-Ts, is often variable in cells of different types and differentiation, and the expression may change in cancer cells (12) . Herein, we investigated the mRNA expression of ppGalNAc-T2 in several human poorly differentiated cancer cells, including SGC7901 gastric cancer cells (19) , SHG44 glioma cells (20), SHI-1 leukemia cells (21) , A549 lung adeno- carcinoma cells (22) , and HO8910 ovarian cancer cells (23) . We found that all of these cells could express ppGalNAc-T2, however, mRNA expression in SGC7901 cells appeared to be higher than in other cells. Furthermore, ppGalNAc-T2 was identified as a metastasis-associated gene, which was highly expressed in human acute T cells, heptocarcinoma HepG-2 cells, and glioma U251 cells (14, 15) . However, the expression of ppGalNAc-T2 in gastric cancer has not been previously reported. In this regard, we first demonstrated that SGC7901 cells show significantly increased expression of ppGalNAc-T2 compared with other poorly differentiated tumor, suggesting that expression levels of ppGalNAc-T2 in gastric cancer are associated with a high risk of metastasis.",

For example, patients with gastric cancer generally have metastasis when clinically examined. There is a low 5-year survival rate and poor quality of life even after tumor resection. The SGC-7901 human gastric cell line was first established from the metastatic lymph node of a 56-year-old female patient suffering from gastric adenocarcinoma (26) . To examine the potential anti-metastasic effects of ppGalNAc-T2, proliferation, adhesion and invasion assays were performed on SGC7901 cells. Regardless of the exact mechanism of ppGalNAc-T2 in the cell metastatic process, pEGFP-C1-ppGalNAc-T2 sense vectors or pEGFP-C1-ppGalNAc-T2 antisense vectors were transfected into SGC7901 cells to reconstitute the expression of ppGalNAc-T2, focusing on the changes in the characteristics of cell metastasis-associated behavior. In ppGalNAc-T2 overexpressed cells (SGC7901-T2s group), proliferation, adhesion, and invasion were decreased compared with untreated SGC7901 cells, whereas the values for the same assays were increased in ppGalNAc-T2 downregulated cells (SGC7901-T2as group).",

We also looked at adhesion of the cells on various ECM components including FN and HA. The ppGalNAc-T2 antisense vectors transfected cells attached better to FN and HA than any other cell line.

Among the many MMPs that have been identified, MMP-2 encodes an enzyme which degrades type IV collagen, the major structural component of basement membranes. MMP-14 activates MMP-2 protein, and this activity may be involved in tumor invasion (30) . Thus, we examined the effect of ppGalNAc-T2 on the expres sion of MMP-2 and MMP-14 in SGC7901 cells. Our study revealed that expression of ppGalNAc-T2 had an inverse correlation with the expression of MMP-2 at the mRNA and protein levels. It is highly likely that ppGalNAc-T2 regulates the proliferation, adhesion, and invasiveness, all of which are essential steps for the establishment of metastasis of SGC7901 cells, due to the regulation of the MMP-2 signaling pathway. However, it did not exhibit any apparent correlation with MMP-14 expression. MMP-14 has been shown to interact with tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2) (31) . Further experiments are required to determine if ppGalNAc-T2 functions in SGC7901 cells, in part, by TIMP-2 signaling pathways.",
