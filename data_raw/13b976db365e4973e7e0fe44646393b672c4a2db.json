Nevertheless, the means by which random mutation improves viral fitness is not well characterized. Here we report the X-ray crystal structure of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the human coronavirus, HCoV-229E, in complex with the ectodomain of its receptor, aminopeptidase N (APN). Three extended loops are solely responsible for receptor binding and the evolution of HCoV-229E and its close relatives is accompanied by changing loop-receptor interactions. Phylogenetic analysis shows that the natural HCoV-229E receptor-binding loop variation observed defines six RBD classes whose viruses have successively replaced each other in the human population over the past 50 years. These RBD classes differ in their affinity for APN and their ability to bind an HCoV-229E neutralizing antibody. Together, our results provide a model for alphacoronavirus adaptation and evolution based on the use of extended loops for receptor binding.",

            "text": "C oronaviruses are enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses that cause a number of respiratory, gastrointestinal, and neurological diseases in birds and mammals 1, 2 . The coronaviruses all possess a common ancestor and four different genera (alpha, beta, gamma, and delta) that collectively use at least four different glycoproteins and acetylated sialic acids as host receptors or attachment factors have evolved [3] [4] [5] . Four coronaviruses, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1 circulate in the human population and collectively they are responsible for a significant percentage of the common cold as well as more severe respiratory disease in vulnerable populations 6, 7 . HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are both alphacoronaviruses and although closely related, they have evolved to use two different receptors, aminopeptidase N (APN) and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), respectively 8, 9 . The more distantly related betacoronaviruses, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1, are less well characterized and although HCoV-OC43 uses 9-O-acetylsialic acid as its receptor 10 , the receptor for HCoV-HKU1 has not yet been determined [11] [12] [13] . Recent zoonotic transmission of betacoronaviruses from bats is responsible for SARS and MERS, and in these cases infection is associated with much more serious disease and high rates of mortality [14] [15] [16] . Like HCoV-NL63, SARS-CoV uses ACE2 17 as its receptor and the observation that MERS-CoV uses dipeptidyl peptidase 4 18 highlights the fact that coronaviruses with new receptor specificities continue to arise.",

            "text": "The coronavirus spike protein (S-protein) is a trimeric singlepass membrane protein that mediates receptor binding and fusion of the viral and host cell membranes 19 . It is a type-1 viral fusion protein possessing two regions, the S1 region that contains the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and the S2 region that contains the fusion peptide and heptad repeats involved in membrane fusion [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . The coronavirus S-protein is also a major target of neutralizing antibodies and one outcome of hostinduced neutralizing antibodies is the selection of viral variants capable of evading them, a process known to drive variation [26] [27] [28] . As shown by both in vivo and in vitro studies, changes in host, host cell type, cross-species transmission, receptor expression levels, serial passage, and tissue culture conditions can also drive viral variation [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] . RNA viruses are characterized by a high mutation rate, a property serving as a buffer against environmental change 34 . A host-elicited immune response, the introduction of antiviral drugs, and the transmission to a new species provide important examples of environmental change 35 . Nevertheless, the means by which random mutations lead to viral variants with increased fitness and enhanced survival in the new environment are not well characterized. Given their wide host range, diverse receptor usage and ongoing zoonotic transmission to humans, the coronaviruses provide an important system for studying RNA virus adaptation and evolution. The alphacoronavirus, HCoV-229E, is particularly valuable as it circulates in the human population and a sequence database of natural variants isolated over the past fifty years is available. Moreover, changes in sequence and serology have suggested that HCoV-229E is changing over time in the human population [36] [37] [38] .",

The structure shows that receptor binding is mediated solely by three extended loops, a feature shared by HCoV-NL63 and the closely related porcine respiratory coronavirus, PRCoV. It also shows that the HCoV-229E RBD binds at a site on hAPN that differs from the site where the PRCoV RBD binds on porcine APN (pAPN), evidence of an ability of the RBD to acquire novel receptor interactions. Remarkably, we find that the natural HCoV-229E sequence variation observed over the past fifty years is highly skewed to the receptor-binding loops. Moreover, we find that the loop variation defines six RBD classes (Classes I-VI) whose viruses have successively replaced each other in the human population. These RBD classes differ in their affinity for hAPN and their ability to be bound by a neutralizing antibody elicited by the HCoV-229E reference strain (Class I). Taken together, our results provide a model for alphacoronavirus adaptation and evolution stemming from the use of extended loops for receptor binding.",

To define the limits of the HCoV-229E RBD, we expressed a series of soluble S-protein fragments and measured their affinity to a soluble fragment (residues 66-967) 39 of hAPN, the HCoV-229E receptor. The smallest S-protein fragment made (residues 293-435) bound hAPN with an affinity (K d of 0.43 \u00b1 0.1 \u00b5M) similar to that of the entire S1 region (residues 17-560) ( Table 1, Supplementary Fig. 1A , B) and this fragment was used in the structure determination. To confirm the importance of the Table 1 Analysis of the hAPN ectodomain (residues 66-967, WT and mutants) interaction with fragments of the HCoV-229E Sprotein (WT and mutants) using surface plasmon resonance HCoV-229E RBD-hAPN interaction for viral infection, we showed that both the RBD and the hAPN ectodomain inhibited viral infection in a cell-based assay (Fig. 1a, b, c) . Crystals of the HCoV-229E RBD-hAPN complex were obtained by co-crystallization of the complex after size exclusion chromatography. The crystallographic data collection and refinement statistics are shown in Table 2 . The asymmetric unit contains one hAPN dimer (and associated RBDs) and one hAPN monomer (and associated RBD) that is related to its dimeric mate by a crystallographic two-fold rotation axis. Both dimers (noncrystallographic and crystallographic) are found in the closed conformation and are essentially identical to that which we previously reported 39 for hAPN in its apo form (RMSD over all C\u03b1 atoms of 0.34 \u00c5). Each APN monomer is bound to one RBD as shown in Fig. 2a . The HCoV-229E RBD-hAPN interaction buries 510 \u00c5 2 of surface area on the RBD and 490 \u00c5 2 on hAPN.",

As our complex shows, HCoV-229E binds at a site on hAPN (H-site) that differs from the site on pAPN (P-site) used by PRCoV (Fig. 3a, b) . Glu 291 in hAPN, a residue in the hAPN-RBD interface, is an N-glycosylated asparagine (Asn 286 ) in pAPN and attempts to dock the HCoV-229E RBD at the H-site on pAPN leads to a steric clash with the N-glycan ( Supplementary Fig. 3A ). Consistent with this observation, the HCoV-229E RBD cannot bind to a mutant form of hAPN (E291N/K292E/Q293T) that possesses an N-glycan at position 291, as we have shown ( 41 . Across species, the sequence identity at the H-and P-sites is only~60% ( Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 3C ) and the receptor-binding loops of these viruses must be accommodating the remaining APN structural differences on receptors from species that they do not infect. Together these results provide evidence that the extended receptor-binding loops of these alphacoronaviruses possess conformational plasticity. The observation that HCoV-229E and PRCoV bind to different sites on APN has important consequences. Among species, APN is found in open/intermediate and closed conformations and conversion between them is thought to be important for the catalysis of its substrates 39, 42 . The HCoV-229E RBD binds to hAPN in its closed conformation and structural comparison shows that the H-site does not differ between the open and closed conformations. This is to be contrasted with the P-site of pAPN that differs in the open and closed conformations. Indeed, the PRCoV RBD has recently been shown to bind to pAPN in the open conformation as a result of P-site interactions made possible in the open form 42 . These differences in binding and receptor conformation are reflected in the fact that enzyme inhibitors that promote the closed conformation of APN block TGEV infection 42 , but not HCoV-229E infection 8 , and the fact that the PRCoV S-protein 42 , but not HCoV-229E 43 , inhibits APN catalytic activity.",

Sequence data from viruses isolated over the past 50 years provides a wealth of data on the natural variation shown by HCoV-229E ( Supplementary Fig. 5 ). With reference to the HCoV-229E RBD-hAPN complex reported here, we now show that 73% of the amino acids in the receptor-binding loops and supporting residues vary among the sequences analyzed (52 sequences in total), while only 11% of the RBD surface residues outside of the receptor-binding loops show variation (Fig. 4a, b) . Moreover, for the eight variants where full genome sequences were reported, the receptor-binding loops represent the location at which the greatest variation in the entire genome is observed (Fig. 4c) . Analysis of the HCoV-229E RBD-hAPN interface further shows that of the 16 RBD surface residues that are fully or partially buried on complex formation, 10 of them vary in at least one of the 52 sequences analyzed and a pairwise comparison of the sequences suggests that many of these positions can vary simultaneously ( Supplementary Fig. 5 ). Finally, we show that the six invariant interface residues on the RBD (Gly 313 , Gly 315 , Cys 317 , Cys 320 , Asn 319 , and Arg 359 ) constitute only 45% of the viral surface area buried, the very region expected to be the most highly conserved from a receptor-binding standpoint.

To characterize these classes, a representative sequence from each was selected; for Class I, the RBD of the reference strain, also used in our structural analysis, was selected. To simplify characterization, the RBDs of the other five classes were synthesized with the Class I sequence in all but the loop regions (Fig. 4d) . As observed for Class I, the other RBDs do not bind to the hAPN mutant that introduces an N-glycan at Glu 291 (Supplementary Fig. 4D) , an observation suggesting that they all bind at the same site on hAPN. The RBDs bound hAPN with a\u00f1 16-fold range in affinity (K d from~30 to~440 nM). These differences in affinity are largely a result of differences in k off with little difference in k on (Table 3 and Supplementary Fig. 7) . Table 2 shows the identity of the loop residues that have shown variation. Of those buried in the RBD-hAPN interface, residues 314, 404, and 407 are particularly noteworthy as they undergo considerable variation in amino-acid character. Residue 314, for example, accounts for 9% of the total buried surface area on complex formation and changes from Gly to Val to Pro in the transition from Classes I to VI. Variation of this sort provides insight into how changes in receptor-binding affinity might be mediated during the process of viral adaptation.",

To this end, we have delimited the HCoV-229E RBD and determined its X-ray structure in complex with the ectodomain of its receptor, hAPN. We found that three extended loops on the RBD are solely responsible for receptor binding, and that these loops are highly variable among viruses isolated over the past 50 years. A phylogenetic analysis also showed that the RBDs of these viruses define six RBD classes whose viruses have successively replaced each other in the human population. The six RBDs differ in their receptor-binding affinity and their ability to be bound by a neutralizing antibody (9.8E12) and taken together, our findings suggest that the HCoV-229E sequence variation observed arose through adaptation and selection.",

            "text": "Antibodies that block receptor binding are a common route to viral neutralization and exposed loops are known to be particularly immunogenic 44 . Loop-binding neutralizing antibodies are elicited by the alphacoronavirus TGEV 40 , and the receptorbinding loops of HCoV-229E mediate the binding of the neutralizing antibody, 9.8E12. As shown by the sequences of the viral isolates analyzed, the RBDs differ almost exclusively in their receptor-binding loops. 9.8E12 blocks the hAPN-RBD interaction and it can only bind to the RBD (Class I) found in the virus that elicited it. This observation shows that loop variability can abrogate neutralizing antibody binding. Indeed, the successive replacement or ladder-like phylogeny observed, when the sequence of the HCoV-229E RBD is analyzed, is characteristic of immune escape as shown by the influenza virus 45, 46 . Taken together, our results suggest that immune evasion contributes to if not explains the extensive receptor-binding loop variation shown by HCoV-229E over the past 50 years. HCoV-229E infection in humans does not provide protection against different isolates 37 , and viruses that contain a new RBD class that cannot be bound by the existing repertoire of loop-binding neutralizing antibodies provide an explanation for this observation. Neutralizing antibodies that block receptor binding can also be thwarted by an increase in the affinity/avidity between the virus and its host receptor. Increased receptor-binding affinity/avidity allows the virus to more effectively compete with receptor blocking neutralizing antibodies, a mechanism thought to be important for evading a polyclonal antibody response 47 . In addition, an optimal receptor binding affinity is thought to exist in a given environment. As such, adaptation in a new species, changes in tissue tropism, and differences in receptor expression levels can all lead to changes in receptor binding affinity 29, 31, 48 . Recent cryoEM analysis has shown that the receptor-binding sites of HCoV-NL63, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and by inference HCoV-229E, are inaccessible in some conformations of the prefusion S-protein trimer [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . Although the ramifications of this structural arrangement are not yet clear, restricting access to the binding site has been proposed to provide a means of limiting Bcell receptor interactions against the receptor-binding site 23 . How this might work in mechanistic terms is also not clear given the need to bind receptor. However, in a simple model, the inaccessible S-protein conformation(s) would be in equilibrium with a less stable (higher energy) but accessible S-protein conformation (s). The energy difference between these conformations is a barrier to binding that decreases equally the intrinsic free energy of binding of both the viral receptor and the B-cell receptor and relative binding energies may be the key. Both soluble hAPN and Values after \u00b1 correspond to the residual standard deviation reported by Scrubber 2. Two experiments were performed NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI: 10.1038/s41467-017-01706-x ARTICLE antibody 9.8E12 can inhibit HCoV-229E infection in a cell-based assay, an indication that their binding energies (K d of 430 and 66 nM, respectively) are sufficient to efficiently overcome the barrier to binding. However, B-cell receptors bind their antigens relatively weakly prior to affinity maturation 49 and they would be much less able to do so. The dynamics of the interconversion between accessible and inaccessible conformations may also be a factor in the recognition of inaccessible antibody epitopes 50, 51 , and further work will be required to establish if and how restricting access to the receptor binding site enhances coronavirus fitness. The cryoEM structures also show that the receptor-binding loops make intra-and inter-subunit contacts in the inaccessible prefusion trimer. This suggests the intriguing possibility that the magnitude of the energy barrier, or the dynamics of the interconversion between accessible and inaccessible conformations, might be modulated by loop variation during viral adaption. Immune evasion and cross-species transmission involve viral adaptation and we posit that the use of extended loops for receptor binding represents a strategy employed by HCoV-229E and the alphacoronaviruses to mediate the process. Such loops can tolerate insertions, deletions, and amino acid substitutions relatively free of the energetic penalties associated with the mutation of other protein structural elements. Indeed, our analysis of the six RBD classes shows that the receptor-binding loops possess a remarkable ability to both accommodate and accumulate mutational change while maintaining receptor binding. Among the six classes, 73% of the loop residues show change and only 45% of the receptor interface buried on receptor binding has been conserved. As we have shown, variation in the receptorbinding loops can abrogate neutralizing antibody binding and it will also increase the likelihood of acquiring new receptor interactions by chance. In this way, the selection of viral variants capable of immune evasion and/or cross-species transmission will be facilitated 27, 28, [52] [53] [54] .",

By a similar reasoning, the use of conserved receptor interactions requiring little optimization would facilitate large species jumps.

Manual building of the HCoV-229E RBD was performed using COOT 67 . Alternate rounds of manual rebuilding and automated refinement using Phenix were performed. Secondary structural restraints and torsion-angle non-crystallographic symmetry restraints between the three monomers in the asymmetric unit were employed. Ramachandran analysis showed that 96% of the residues are in the most favored region, with 4% in the additionally allowed region. Data collection and refinement statistics are found in Table 2 . A stereo image of a portion of the electron density map in the HCoV-229E-hAPN interface is showed in Supplementary Fig. 9 . Figures were generated using the program chimera 68 .

The protein sequence of the HCoV-229E P100E isolate RBD (residues 293-435) was used to perform a search of the non-redundant protein sequence database using Blastp. 70 and the residue-specific sequence conservation index was mapped onto the surface of the RBD using the \"render by conservation\" tool in Chimera 68 . Percentage identity is mapped using a color scale with blue indicating 100% identity and red indicating 30% identity. The protein-coding regions of the eight sequences for which the entire genome were reported (GenBank Identifier numbers: NC_002645.1, JX503060.1, JX503061.1, KF514433.1, KF514430.1, KF514432.1, AF304460.1, and KU291448.1) were aligned using Muscle. The entire protein-coding region of the viral genome was treated as a continuous amino-acid string (8850 residues in total). Protein residues that were not identical among the eight sequences were counted as a difference and plotted in 100 residue bins. The sequence AAK32191.1 was chosen as the representative of Class I and the loop sequences of ABB90507.1, ABB90514.1, ABB90519.1, ABB90523.1, and AFR45554.1 were combined with the non-loop sequences of AAK32191.1 to generate the RBDs of Classes (II-VI), respectively.
