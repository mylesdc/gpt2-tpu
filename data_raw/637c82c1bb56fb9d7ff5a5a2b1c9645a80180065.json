They are able to carry a specific single stranded RNA (ssRNA) sequence of choice inside their capsid, thus protecting it against the effects of ubiquitous nucleases. Such particles are able to mimic ssRNA viruses and, thus, may serve as the process control for molecular detection and quantification of such agents in several kinds of matrices, vaccines and vaccine candidates, drug delivery systems, and systems for the display of immunologically active peptides or nanomachines. Currently, there are several different in vivo plasmid-driven packaging systems for production of MS2 PLP. In order to combine all the advantages of the available systems and to upgrade and simplify the production and purification of MS2 PLP, a one-plasmid double-expression His-tag system was designed. The described system utilizes a unique fusion insertional mutation enabling purification of particles using His-tag affinity. Using this new production system, highly pure MS2 PLP can be quickly produced and purified by a fast performance liquid chromatography (FPLC) approach. The system can be easily adapted to produce other MS2 PLP with different properties.",

            "text": "MS2 phage-like particles (MS2 PLP) are artificial pseudo-viral particles whose production is based on knowledge of the familiar bacteriophage MS2 (+ssRNA, Leviviridae) 1 and the ability of its coat protein dimers to pack specific single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) molecules 2-4 . The packaging is driven by dimerization of coat proteins followed by a specific interaction of dimers with a stem-loop structure (called the \"pac\" site) in ssRNA resulting in spontaneous formation of MS2 PLP. These particles are small in size (about 27 nm), non-enveloped, non-infectious, non-replicative, stable pseudo-viral particles with the ability to protect encapsidated ssRNA molecules against the effects of ubiquitous nucleases. Due to these properties and their morphological and physicochemical characteristics, MS2 PLP carrying specific ssRNA molecules can serve as suitable process control virus (PCV) for the detection and quantification of ssRNA viruses within a wide range of samples; for example, human norovirus (NoV), human enterovirus (EV), hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis E virus (HEV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) 2,5-8 . Perspectives on the practical use of MS2 PLP as RNA vaccines and vaccine candidates, drug delivery systems, and systems for the display of immunologically active peptides or nanomachines are discussed in a recent review 9 .",

            "text": "Since the first study at the beginning of the 1990s in which non-bacteriophage RNA was encapsulated by MS2 coat protein dimers, many different methods for the production of MS2 PLP have been developed 4 . Currently, the production of MS2 PLP is based on various in vivo plasmid-driven packaging systems, which exploit the spontaneous assembly of MS2 coat protein dimers in the presence of the pac site inside Escherichia coli (E. coli) 10 . However, while each of these systems have their advantages, they are also characterized by various drawbacks, e.g., limited capacity for packaging of control ssRNA, lower efficiency of packaging, complicated system construction, or complicated and time-consuming purification of produced MS2 PLP. The newest and most advanced plasmid-driven packaging system, the so-called one-plasmid double-expression packaging system, allows construction of MS2 PLP with high efficiency and packaging specificity, and allows a maximum length of encapsidated ssRNA of up to 3,600 nucleotides (nt) 11 . Recently, this packaging system was even used for the construction of MS2 PLP carrying a 4,942-nt-long control sequence for Zika virus 12 . However, this system still does not address a major drawback of current MS2 PLP preparations: the purification procedure. Therefore, produced MS2 PLP must be purified in a time-consuming and laborious ultracentrifugation step, which does not isolate MS2 PLP in the required purity 4, 8, 10, 11, 13 . The problem of purification can be solved by the introduction of an affinity tag (e.g., polyhistidine-tag; His-tag) to the structure of MS2 PLP allowing their purification using the Co 2+ affinity chromatography method 13,14 . This approach enables easy and fast purification of huge amounts of pure MS2 PLP. As the one-plasmid double-expression packaging system had not yet been developed at that time, Cheng et al. used a so-called one-plasmid expression system for production of MS2 PLP. The system has limited capacity for packaging of control sequences (up to 2,000 nt), and the particles contain undesirable sequences from bacteriophage MS2 10,13 . Based on this knowledge, none of the previously used plasmid-driven systems for production of MS2 PLP is ideal. The novelty of the present study lies not only in combination of all the experience acquired so far with the different methods of MS2 PLP construction for developing a new plasmid-driven construction system, which integrates all the advantages and benefits of the previously described systems. This is also the first report about the construction of single-chain version of the coat protein dimer containing the His-tag capable to successfully form intact His-tagged MS2 PLP that can be purified in less than one hour by FPLC. Moreover, presented approach solves the previous problem of introduction of His-tag to structure of the coat protein in parallel with formation of whole intact MS2 PLP.",

            "text": "It was shown previously that the newest and most advanced in vivo system for production of MS2 PLP-the one-plasmid double-expression system-has great potential for the production of MS2 PLP 11, 12 . In comparison with other previously used systems, the system developed by Zhan et al. has a good expression efficiency, produces MS2 PLP containing only defined control ssRNA sequences without any other MS2 bacteriophage sequences, and also allows packaging of long control ssRNA sequences using multiple pac sites [10] [11] [12] . However, the one-plasmid double-expression system does not enable rapid, simple, and effective purification of produced MS2 PLP. This problem can be resolved by introduction of a His-tag into the structure of MS2 PLP. This results in MS2 PLP carrying 180 His-tag epitopes, which allows their purification using affinity chromatography 13 . Unfortunately, at the beginning of this study it was found that introduction of a His-tag into the structure of MS2 PLP according to Cheng et al. and expression of His-tagged MS2 PLP in a one-plasmid double-expression system does not result in the production of any His-tagged MS2 PLP 13 . It was subsequently discovered that another group also encountered this problem and failed in the production of His-tagged MS2 PLP (Harder, Friedrich Loeffler Institute, Germany, personal communication, March 2017). Ponchon et al. also adopted the previously reported strategy of Cheng et al. and tried to produce His-tagged MS2 PLP 15, 16 . However, Ponchon et al. used a so-called two-plasmid system where the first plasmid carried the MS2 coat protein sequence under control of an inducible tac promoter and the second plasmid carried the sequence for packaging under the control of a constitutive lpp promoter 10, 16 . This strategy allows successful co-expression of both the protein and ssRNA in an appropriate ratio. But as a result, in all cases, it was observed that the MS2 coat protein with the His-tag only formed a dimer rather than intact His-tagged MS2 PLP 16 . It is known that peptide insertions into viral capsid proteins often result in protein misfolding that interferes with MS2 PLP assembly 17 . On the other hand, it is also known that fusion of two coat protein monomers (single-chain dimer) confers tolerance to peptide insertions in an MS2 coat protein dimer 18, 19 . The basic idea of a using a single-chain version of the MS2 coat protein dimer with a His-tag in this study was inspired by these previously published results. The described plasmid-driven system is based on plasmid pACYCDuet-1. Plasmid pACYCDuet-1 was chosen as the basis for the new His-tagged MS2 PLP production system because it was shown to be an optimal solution in previous studies that dealt with the construction of particles or production of MS2 coat protein 11, [20] [21] [22] . Zhan et al. used a one-plasmid double-expression system based on the pACYCDuet-1 plasmid for production of MS2 PLP carrying a 3,034-nt-long control sequence 11 . To test the ability of such a system to also pack very short control sequences, our previously reported specific control sequence with a total length of 150 nt was chosen for packaging 8 . The final pACYCDuet-1-TM-CoatDimer-His expression vector was constructed with a view of easily allowing subsequent modifications. MCS1 of the vector containing the sequences of maturase and single-chain version of the coat protein dimer containing the His-tag was modified, so that the maturase sequence no longer contains the NdeI restriction site. This modification opens the possibility for using the NdeI restriction site for cloning into MCS2, which increases the maximum length of packed ssRNA control sequences, because NdeI is the first restriction site in the MCS2 of the vector. Furthermore, in the case that the NdeI sequence will be present in the sequence of maturase, direct cloning of sequences into MCS2 of the vector using the NdeI restriction site will not be possible. The inserted sequence for the His-tag is flanked by two KpnI restriction sites. This flanking is a consequence of previously used methods of oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis 14, 23 . Although the sequence of maturase and the single-chain version of coat protein dimer containing the His-tag was synthesized de novo, it was decided to maintain the presence of the KpnI restriction sites, mainly due to the possibility of easy replacement of the His-tag sequence at this position. The single-chain version of the coat protein dimer is more tolerant of foreign peptide insertions than the wild-type coat protein monomer 18, 19 . Therefore, utilization of the described system should allow insertion of different peptides at this position without causing any problems for MS2 PLP assembly. The possibility of producing MS2 PLP carrying ssRNAs of choice and presenting various peptides on the surface of the capsid is currently a very promising method for the production of RNA vaccines based on recombinant MS2 PLP 24-28 . The single-chain version of the MS2 coat protein dimer contains one wild-type coat protein fused with one mutagenized coat protein carrying the His-tag. Therefore, the presented method results in the production of His-tagged MS2 PLP containing 90 His-tags in the capsid structure exposed outward from the particle and allowing chelated Co 2+ on the resin beads to access the His-tag. Newly produced single-chain version coat protein dimer containing the His-tag was extensively characterized using SDS-PAGE, western blotting and MALDI-TOF analyses. The molecular weight of the wild-type coat protein measured using MALDI-TOF was 13,730 Da, which is very close to its theoretical value of 13,728.54 Da. The measured molecular weight of the single-chain version of the coat protein dimer containing the His-tag was 28,329 Da (Fig. 4E) , which is also very close to its theoretical value of 28,333 Da. The differences between theoretical and measured values of protein molecular weights are probably due to the sample preparation protocol and instrumentation used. These analyses clearly showed that the desired mutagenized coat protein with the expected properties was successfully obtained after induction. Moreover, this single-chain version of the coat protein dimer containing the His-tag was able to create compact His-tagged MS2 PLP, which were morphologically indistinguishable from previously produced MS2 PLP 2, 8 .",

In fact, the quantity of isolated His-tagged MS2 PLP purified through FPLC is one order of magnitude higher than the quantity of MS2 PLP purified through ultracentrifugation (~10 9 particles/\u00b5l; RT-qPCR quantification according to 8 ). The FPLC purification procedure is also not as laborious as traditional methods of purification and does not have any negative impact on MS2 PLP integrity. The integrity of His-tagged MS2 PLP after FPLC purification was tested by TEM; the stability of particles against nucleases was also tested. In general, the ability of MS2 PLP to withstand the action of nucleases is one of their most important properties, because only intact particles are able to protect the ssRNA that they encapsulate. Testing the stability of FPLC-purified His-tagged MS2 PLP against nucleases clearly showed that the particles were able to effectively protect the ssRNA that they encapsidated against nuclease degradation.",

A possible explanation for this difference is that the lower intensity of His-tagged MS2 PLP bands is related to a lower proportion of contaminating DNA in comparison with MS2 PLP (Table 2) .",

This feature was utilized in our previously developed RT-qPCR system for quantification of MS2 PLP, which uses a two-step format in which RT and qPCR reactions are separated 8 . The step of particle lysis was included in the RT protocol and it was demonstrated that initial denaturation of 65 \u00b0C/5 minutes during the RT protocol is sufficient to lyse His-tagged MS2 PLP. This approach not only saves time, but also represents the gentlest method of thermal lysis and provides the highest RT-qPCR yield. On the other hand, the results of this experiment also show that the temperature of lysis has no critical effect on ssRNA stability, and, thus, the STE buffer in which the particles were diluted and lysed provided good protection to naked ssRNA molecules.",

It is generally accepted that this treatment is sufficient to eliminate contaminating DNA. However, this may not be true. Cheng et al. tested the purity of MS2 PLP purified through ultracentrifugation and found that they exhibit significant DNA contamination 13 MS2 PLP was only ~10 3 particles/\u00b5l). Based on these findings, the His-tagged MS2 PLP produced in this study and previously produced MS2 PLP 8 were tested for the presence of contaminating DNA. Because some MS2 PLP applications, e.g., use as a PCV in RT-qPCR detection and quantification of pathogenic ssRNA viruses from a wide range of samples, require a greater quantity of MS2 PLP (~10 5 -10 8 particles/\u00b5l), the presence of contaminating DNA was tested in range of 10 8 -10 5 particles/\u00b5l. The results are consistent with those reported previously 13 with the difference that His-tagged MS2 PLP are also not absolutely free of contaminating DNA, especially at higher concentrations. On the other hand, according to our findings His-tagged MS2 PLP are always at least 150,000\u00d7 cleaner through all tested concentrations (10 8 -10 5 particles/\u00b5l) than MS2 PLP purified through ultracentrifugation (Table 2) . Moreover, the proportion of contaminating DNA decreases with progressive dilution, but only His-tagged MS2 PLP can be diluted to a quantity where contaminating DNA is not detectable in RT-qPCR. In general, the purity of isolated MS2 PLP is very important because the presence of contaminating DNA could affect quantification in experiments where particles are used as a PCV, or can confer toxic effects on MS2 PLP serving as vaccines or drug delivery systems 9 . Thus, the one-plasmid double-expression His-tag system presented in this work is able to meet this demanding criterion, and can be used for the production of highly pure MS2 PLP. On the other hand, the described purification method is dedicated mainly for using MS2 PLP as a PCV and for using as a vaccines or drug delivery systems it is needed to perform additional laboratory tests.",

To eliminate cell debris, the lysed bacterial suspension was briefly centrifuged at 6000\u00d7 g for 15 minutes at room temperature and the supernatant containing His-tagged MS2 PLP was filtered through a 0.22-\u00b5m syringe PES filter (TPP, Switzerland). Tris, 100 NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH = 7.5, all Sigma-Aldrich). His-tagged MS2 PLP were verified by TEM using a Philips EM 208 electron microscope (FEI, Czech Republic). The sample of supernatant containing His-tagged MS2 PLP was applied to the grid, stained with 2% ammonium molybdate (pH = 7.0) for 1 minute, and inspected at 18,000 \u00d7 magnification and an accelerating voltage of 80 kV. Purified His-tagged MS2 PLP were quantified by RT-qPCR as was described previously 8 . The quantity of FPLC-purified His-tagged MS2 PLP was compared with previously produced non-His-tagged MS2 PLP purified through ultracentrifugation 8 .",

Briefly, MS2 PLP and His-tagged MS2 PLP were resolved by SDS-PAGE 31 using a 15% separating polyacrylamide gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (PVDF; Amersham, UK) which were subsequently blocked in 1% casein hydrolysate (Imuna, Czech Republic) overnight at 4 \u00b0C.

Subsequently, His-tagged MS2 PLP were purified using a fast performance liquid chromatography system (FPLC; Pharmacia, Sweden) with a HiTrap TALON Crude (5 ml) column (GE Healthcare, UK). In brief, the column was preequilibrated with 50 ml of 0.22-\u00b5m (TPP)-filtered binding buffer (50 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 300 mM NaCl, 15 mM imidazole, pH = 8.0, all Sigma-Aldrich) at a flow rate of 10 ml/min. The His-tagged MS2 PLP bound to the column (flow rate 1 ml/min) and were subsequently washed with 200 ml of 0.22-\u00b5m (TPP)-filtered washing buffer (50 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 300 mM NaCl, 30 mM imidazole, pH = 8.0, all Sigma-Aldrich) at a flow rate of 10 ml/min. His-tagged MS2 PLP were eluted from the column in a final volume of 5 ml with 0.22-\u00b5m (TPP)-filtered elution buffer (50 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 300 mM NaCl, 200 mM imidazole, pH = 8.0, all Sigma-Aldrich) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Eluate containing His-tagged MS2 PLP was desalted using Vivacon 10 kDa columns (Vivacon, Sartorius, Germany) and converted to STE buffer (10 mM Scientific RepoRts | 7:17501 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-17951-5",
