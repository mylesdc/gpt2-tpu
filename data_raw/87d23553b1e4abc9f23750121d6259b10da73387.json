            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has recently emerged in the Middle East. Since 2012, there have been approximately 2,100 confirmed cases, with a 35% case fatality rate. Disease severity has been linked to patient health status, as people with chronic diseases or an immunocompromised status fare worse, although the mechanisms of disease have yet to be elucidated. We used the rhesus macaque model of mild MERS to investigate whether the immune response plays a role in the pathogenicity in relation to MERS-CoV shedding. Immunosuppressed macaques were inoculated with MERS-CoV and sampled daily for 6 days to assess their immune statues and to measure viral shedding and replication. Immunosuppressed macaques supported significantly higher levels of MERS-CoV replication in respiratory tissues and shed more virus, and virus disseminated to tissues outside of the respiratory tract, whereas viral RNA was confined to respiratory tissues in non-immunosuppressed animals. Despite increased viral replication, pathology in the lungs was significantly lower in immunosuppressed animals. The observation that the virus was less pathogenic in these animals suggests that disease has an immunopathogenic component and shows that inflammatory responses elicited by the virus contribute to disease.",

Clinical features range from asymptomatic infection, to an acute respiratory distress syndrome, and multi-organ failure (3) . The majority of patients that have succumbed to MERS-CoV have had comorbidities (4, 5) and disease is thought to be more severe in immunocompromised patients. However, the actual MERS-CoV Infection in Immunosuppressed Macaques Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org February 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 205 mechanisms of disease remain to be elucidated. The virus has been shown to replicate in human primary epithelial and ex vivo human lung cultures, especially in non-ciliated bronchial epithelial cells and alveolar type II pneumocytes (6) (7) (8) and the receptor has been identified as dipeptidyl peptidase 4, which is expressed on these cell types (9) . MERS-CoV shedding is higher in patients with more severe disease manifestations compared to milder cases (10) . Our laboratory has recently developed two non-human primate models of MERS, utilizing the rhesus macaque and the common marmoset (11) (12) (13) . Rhesus macaques develop a mild pneumonia upon intratracheal inoculation with MERS-CoV (12) . In this model, virus replicates within the respiratory tract to modest levels, and is detectible in oral and nasal swabs. However, clinical disease is most prominent within the first few days after inoculation and animals show signs of disease resolution soon after. Disease in rhesus likely models the mild form of the human disease, where the infection is self-limiting and clinical signs and symptoms are mild (10, 14, 15) . In an effort to examine whether the immune status of an individual influences the disease severity and pathogenicity and replication kinetics of the virus, we downregulated the immune system of rhesus macaques using immunosuppressive drugs. We found that MERS-CoV replicated to significantly higher titers and disseminated outside of the respiratory tract in immunosuppressed animals, yet pathology was markedly reduced in these animals, showing that disease has an immunopathogenic component.",

Two animals were used for mock immunosuppression controls and received the identical inoculum. Throughout immunosuppression, we monitored WBC populations in the blood to determine the efficacy of the immunosuppression regimen. Total WBC counts were decreased by approximately twofold compared to the control animals in response to CyP and Dex administration at the time of MERS-CoV inoculation. This reduction was due to decreases in all measured cell types (lymphocytes, neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils) (Figure 1 ). Following MERS-CoV inoculation, the absolute counts of these cell populations remained low in the immunosuppressed animals, suggesting their inability to respond to infection. Conversely, the two mock immunosuppressed animals had increased numbers of monocytes and eosinophils in response to infection. To quantify immunosuppression at the tissue level, the spleens and mediastinal lymph nodes of all animals were stained immunohistochemically with T cell and B cell markers (CD3 and CD20, respectively) post-mortem. The amount of staining was quantitatively assessed using imaging software. The quantity of CD3 staining was approximately 2-fold lower in the spleen and 2.7-fold in a mediastinal lymph node in the immunosuppressed animals. Likewise, CD20 was 2.4-fold lower in the spleen and 3-fold lower in the lymph nodes, showing a general reduction in lymphocytes in these tissues and confirming that the suppressive drug therapy was effective in reducing immune cell populations (Figures 2A,B) . Immunosuppression also disrupted the normal architecture of these tissues.",

Some viruses are thought to cause disease by dysregulating the immune response, whereby destruction of infected cells or secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators leads to immunopathology, as in the case of hantaviruses (18) . Conversely, pathogenesis caused by some viruses correlates with deficiencies, or inefficiencies of the immune response, such as in the case of pathogenic viruses affecting the very young and elderly, or immune compromised individuals, as in the case of influenza virus (19) . The mechanisms by which the recently emerged MERS-CoV causes disease in humans, and what host factors are associated with either resistance or a poor outcome are not known (15) . These questions are important for the development of countermeasures that either directly target the virus to inhibit its replication or modulate the immune response to limit immunopathogenesis. Early epidemiologic studies of MERS suggested that patients with comorbidities fared worse than healthy patients upon infection, and the number of comorbidities correlated with a worse outcome (20) . In addition, a few patients with lethal infections were reported to be immunosuppressed (21) (22) (23) . These reports were from cases where diagnoses were primarily in patients already in hospitals, including a relatively large number of nosocomial infections affecting 23 patients in a hospital outbreak in Al-Hasa (24) . Since these initial case reports, more than 2,000 additional cases of MERS-CoV infection have been confirmed (2). Although many of these new cases are reported to be health care related, either stemming from patients or health care workers, it is unclear how many of these cases involve immunocompromised individuals.",

            "text": "Risk factors that have been associated with disease (or infection) include weakened immune systems and chronic diseases, such as diabetes, cancer, and chronic lung disease, as well as co-infections (5, 20, 25) . Although these comorbidities clearly affect the status of the immune response, acute immunosuppression using drugs, as we have done here, provides a more controlled deficit in immune responses, whereas immune dysregulation brought on by chronic disease, infection, and aging is a complex phenomenon that involves deficiencies in the immune response, chronic inflammatory responses, and other known and yet to be described complex changes. For instance, the majority of patients had diabetes as a comorbidity and several others were immunosuppressed with HIV/AIDS. Both of these conditions alter the immune response in a way that both inhibits normal T cell functions, as well as inducing an inflammatory response by altering Th17 responses and secretion of inflammatory cytokines (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) . The immunosuppression in our study mimics some aspects of the human condition in these patients, such as inhibition of CD4 + T cell responses by HIV-infected patients. However, the chemical immunosuppression used herein is unlikely to mimic the chronic inflammatory state in many of these patients. This higher basal level of immune activation associated with these conditions may be important contributions to the manifestation of the clinically overt serious disease following MERS-CoV infection, and would imply that the immune system plays a role in the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV. This agrees with our observation that upon simple immunosuppression, MERS-CoV replicated to higher levels and showed greater dissemination and shedding, while the pathology was actually reduced in these animals. Pathology was likely lessened due to the absence of inflammatory cells and mediators, as observed histologically in the lung tissues. This suggests that the virus itself might cause little damage to the cells that it infects and this would lead toward a mechanism in which the absence of an efficient immune response allows the virus to replicate to high levels, whereas pathology can be attributed to the overactive inflammatory response, which patients with comorbidities are prone to possess. This is supported by data in the resus and marmoset animal models, which show that increased viral replication and the local immune response to this plays an important role in the pulmonary severity of disease (31) . Although not performed in this study, a control group treated with immunosuppressive drugs, and not challenged, would be necessary for a comprehensive picture of the immune status of these animals at the time of necropsy.",

This is supported by the observation that bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of humans infected with MERS-CoV contain high numbers of neutrophils and macrophages (1, 22) . Furthermore, lymphopenia has been associated with disease and is potentially caused by infiltration of lymphocytes in the lung tissue and egress from the blood (34) . Taking these findings into account, we can envision a model in which infection of the lung tissue and resident immune cells, such as alveolar macrophages, leads to the hyper-production of inflammatory cytokines and immune cell recruitment chemokines, which together limit virus replication, but result in an immunopathologic state. Upon immunosuppression of our macaques, the virus was still able to infect and replicate in the lung tissue, and likely induced local cytokine and chemokine expression; however, the depletion of immune cell populations upon chemical immunosuppression inhibited recruitment of inflammatory cells to the lungs (or infected tissues) and, thus, limited pathology. This is the first direct experimental evidence showing that MERS-CoV has an immunopathogenic component. This is in line with the observation in one patient in South Korea, which was taking prolonged high-dose corticosteroid therapy to control lymphoma activity and hemolytic anemia and displayed persistant viral shedding without clinical progression of the disease (23) .",

Blood samples were collected at the indicated time points, inclusive of a control bleed 2 days prior to the initiation of the study (\u221218), and blood cells were enumerated. All blood cell types measured were decreased in the immunosuppressed animals (red lines) at the time of inoculation and remained depressed. Control animals given PBS (black lines) had no reduction in cell counts and cell counts increased in response to infection. Total white blood cells (WBC), lymphocytes (Ly), neutrophils (NE), monocytes (MO), eosinophils (EO), and basophils (BA) were measured.",

Quantitation of the amount of specific CD marker staining (red), compared to the absence of staining (blue) showed that the amount of CD3 staining was reduced approximately 2-fold in the spleen (a) and 2.7-fold in the lymph node (B) in the immunosuppressed animals. Likewise, CD20 staining was reduced by 2.4-fold in the spleen and 3-fold in the lymph nodes, showing a reduction in these cells.
