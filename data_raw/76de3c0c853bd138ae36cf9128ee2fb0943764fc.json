In this study, we designed and synthesized a novel series of emodin derivatives by binding emodin to an amino acid using linkers of varying lengths and composition, and evaluated their anti-proliferative activities using HepG2 cells (human hepatic carcinoma), MCF-7 cells (human breast cancer) and human normal liver L02 cells. Most of these derivatives showed moderate to potent anti-proliferative activities. Notably, compound 7a exhibited potent anti-proliferative activity against HepG2 cells with the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) value of 4.95 \u00b5M, which was enhanced 8.8-fold compared to the parent compound emodin (IC 50 = 43.87 \u00b5M), and it also exhibited better selective anti-proliferative activity and specificity than emodin. Moreover, further experiments demonstrated that compound 7a displayed a significant efficacy of inducing apoptosis through mitochondrial pathway via release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and subsequent activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3, inducing cell arrest at G0/G1 phase, as well as suppression of cell migration of tumor cells. The preliminary results suggested that compound 7a could be a promising lead compound for the discovery of novel anti-tumor drugs and has the potential for further investigations as an anti-cancer drug.",

            "text": "Emodin (3-methyl-1,6,8-trihydroxyanthraquinone, Figure 1 ) is a naturally occurring anthraquinone derivative that is widely distributed in different plants (rhubarb, aloe), lichens and terristrial fungi, that has also been isolated from marine-derived fungi and marine sponge-associated fungi [1] [2] [3] [4] . It is also an active ingredient in Chinese medicinal herbs used in the treatment of constipation, jaundice, gastro-intestinal hemorrhage, and ulcers. Emodin has the same tricyclic planar chromophore skeleton as certain anti-tumor antibiotics such as daunorubicin, doxorubicin, epirubicin, and several synthetic analogs distributed such as mitoxantrone and pixantrone ( Figure 1) ; all of which are in used for clinical treatment of various cancers. Many reports have demonstrated that emodin possesses a wide spectrum of pharmacological effects such as anti-tumour [5] [6] [7] , anti-inflammatory [8, 9] , antiviral [10] , antibacterial [11] , anti-allergic [12] , anti-osteoporotic [13] , anti-diabetic [14, 15] , immunosuppressive [16] , neuroprotective [17] , and hepatoprotective [18, 19] activities, etc. Among these effects, anti-tumor anti-osteoporotic [13] , anti-diabetic [14, 15] , immunosuppressive [16] , neuroprotective [17] , and hepatoprotective [18, 19] activities, etc. Among these effects, anti-tumor activity is the most widely reported. In recent decades, pharmacological studies have shown that emodin is capable of inhibiting cellular proliferation [20] , inducing of cell differentiation [21] and apoptosis [22] , and activating of caspase cascade pathway [23, 24] and mitochondrial death pathway [25, 26] in different cancer cells. Chemical transformation of bioactive compounds of natural products is one of the most common approaches in drug discovery to improve therapeutic properties. To date, the anti-tumor activity of emodin has been improved by structural modification, mainly to the side chain including methyl, hydroxyl, and/or aryl ring groups. For example, Wang et al. reported that emodin quaternary ammonium salt derivatives showed significant anti-cancer activities against hepatoma cells [27] [28] [29] . Xing et al. reported the effects of emodin rhamnoside derivatives against human cancer cells [30] , and Tan et al. reported DNA-binding pyrazole emodin derivatives [31] .",

This prompted us to screen the different length of diol linker between 2-aminopropanoic acid and emodin. Our results also suggest that compared to compound 3a, compound 7a exhibited a slightly more potent anti-proliferative activity against HepG2 cells and MCF-7 cells. Following this, the anti-cancer mechanism of compound 7a was evaluated against HepG2 cells.",

Overall, with the exception of compound 3n, compounds 3k-3m with cyclic alkyl amino acid groups displayed worse inhibitory activities than emodin (1); especially compound 3m containing a heterocycle. Interestingly, compound 3n which contains a cyclopentane amino acid group displayed higher anti-proliferative activity against HepG2 cells and MCF-7 cells with IC 50 values of 12.48 \u00b1 0.59 \u00b5M and 23.51 \u00b1 1.93 \u00b5M, respectively. Compounds 3o and 3p with D-and L-Ala groups exhibited similar inhibitory activity to compound 3n. Compared to emodin (1), compounds 3q-3z with aryl (phenyl, substituted phenyl, benzyl, substituted benzyl, etc.) amino acid groups displayed enhanced activity in varying degrees when tested against two cancer cell lines, with IC 50 values ranging from 11.41 \u00b1 0.77 to 42.44 \u00b1 1.16 \u00b5M. Following our initial results, we performed further modification of compounds 3b and 3c to improve the anti-proliferative activity, thus mono-and dimethylation of the amino moiety in the amino acid afforded compounds 4a, 4b, 5a and 5b. Unfortunately, this modification led to decreased activity to varying degrees against both the HepG2 and MCF-7 cell lines, with IC 50 values ranging from 13.69 \u00b1 0.89 to 68.81 \u00b1 2.25 \u00b5M, as shown in Table 2 . Notably, compound 4b displayed a 6-fold activity reduction against MCF-7 cell lines compared to emodin (1). The results revealed that \"NH 2 \" was the moiety that favors improving the anti-proliferative activity. The preliminary explanation was that amino group can interact with other biomolecules to improve the anti-proliferative activity via formation of hydrogen bond. Mono-or dimethylation of amino group might weaken the trend of hydrogen bonding and decrease the anti-proliferative activity. Next, as shown in Table 3 , the linking group of compounds 3b and 3c was further optimized by increasing the linker length in compounds 3b and 3c by one additional methylene group. The resulting compounds, 7a and 7b, displayed further enhanced potency at inhibiting cell growth against both HepG2 cells and MCF-7 cells. However, compounds 7c-7f initially failed to increase the potency of cell growth inhibition against both tested cancer cell lines; this was successfully addressed by increasing the linker length using additional methylene bridge. On the other hand, elongation of the linker by two to four ethanediol groups resulted in compounds 7g-7l, which showed decreased activity compared to compounds 3b and 3c. Three pairs of compounds possessing stronger anti-proliferative activities were screened out and their cytotoxic activities were preformed against human normal liver cells (L02) in vitro. As shown in Table 4 , the parent compound emodin exhibited stronger cytotoxic activity against L02 cells with an IC 50 value of 22.52 \u00b1 0.18 \u00b5M than against cancer cell lines (IC 50 = 43.87 \u00b1 1.28 \u00b5M against HepG2 cells and IC 50 = 52.72 \u00b1 2.22 \u00b5M against MCF-7 cells). However, all the six compounds exhibited weaker cytotoxic activities against L02 cells compared with their corresponding cancer cell lines. Above all, we finally chose to investigate the mechanism of action for compound 7a because it had the strongest anti-proliferative activity against HepG2 cells. ",

After stirring for 36 h at 60 \u2022 C, the resulting mixture was evaporated under reduced pressure and then mixed with water (500 mL). The pH value of aqueous phase was adjusted to around 5 with 10% hydrochloric acid solution. The yellow precipitate was collected and washed with water to give the crude product, which was in further purification by triturating twice with ethyl acetate (100 mL) and filtered to afford compound 2 (7.6 g, 65%) as a brown solid; 1 General procedure A for preparation of compounds 3a-3z, 4a-4b, and 7a-7l",

Their in vitro anti-proliferation tests revealed that these derivatives exhibited moderate to potent anti-proliferative activity against HepG2 cells and MCF-7 cells. Among these compounds, the most potent compound, 7a, exhibited better selective anti-proliferative activity and specificity than emodin, displayed a significant effect in inducing cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase and inducing cell apoptosis in HepG2 cells via release of cytochrome c and subsequent activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3, which revealed that the possible molecular mechanism of 7a apoptosis induction may mainly through the mitochondrial death pathway. Moreover, Compound 7a also resulted in inhibition of HepG2 cells migration in the wound healing assay. These preliminary molecular mechanism results suggest that compound 7a could be a promising lead compound for the development of novel antitumor drugs and has the potential for further investigations as an anti-cancer drug.",
