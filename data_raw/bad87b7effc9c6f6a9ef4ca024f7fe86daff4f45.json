            "text": "A number of recombinant therapeutic proteins, including recombinant human insulin, are produced in microbial expression systems established using bacteria or yeast. However, the production of larger, more complex proteins often requires extensive post-translational modifications, particularly glycosylation. Most microbial systems cannot perform all of the modifications necessary for proper protein structure and function. Instead, mammalian expression systems have been the traditional approach for the large-scale manufacture of therapeutic proteins which require these critical post-translational modifications. An additional advantage of these mammalian cell systems is that the recombinant proteins are secreted into the media in their natural form. E. coli-expressed proteins, on the other hand, mostly accumulate in a highly denatured form within the cell as inclusion bodies and require renaturation later in the manufacturing process [2] . About 60-70% of all recombinant protein therapeutics are produced in mammalian cells, primarily Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells [3] . CHO cells have many characteristics that have made them the most widely used mammalian host system. In addition to ease of manipulation and other characteristics preferred for large-scale production of proteins, proteins produced in CHO cells have a proven safety profile in humans and these proteins also have glycosylation patterns similar to that of human proteins [4] .Advances in modulating the glycosylation patterns of some yeast strains (e.g., P. pastoris) may lead to an alternative, nonmammalian cell system in the future [5] but currently, mammalian cells remain the primary vehicle for large-scale production of recombinant therapeutic glycoproteins.",

The first step in this evolution was the switch to plasma-derived purified FVIII concentrates in the 1970s, followed by recombinant FVIII concentrates starting in 1992, and finally to animal-and human-plasma free recombinant FVIII starting in 2003 (Fig. 1 ).

Blood or plasma collected during this asymptomatic latent phase can be highly infectious. This is exemplified by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) which has infected nearly 65 million people worldwide. An estimated 33 million people are currently infected with HIV, yet the vast majority of these individuals are unaware of their HIV + status [http://www.unaids.org/en/KnowledgeCentre/HIV Data/GlobalReport/2008/]. The coronavirus which is responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is another example of an emerging human pathogen resulting from zoonotic transmission [9] . Unlike HIV, this coronavirus caused a severe but short epidemic following adaptation to its new human host. Many epidemiologists predict similar types of outbreaks from emerging viruses in the future, with the greatest threat to biopharmaceutical manufacturing being the non-lipid enveloped (NLE) viruses such as circoviruses. Circoviruses, which include torquetenovirus (TTV) and torque-tenominivirus (TTMV), are the smallest of all known mammalian NLE viruses and they cannot be eliminated by nanofiltration [10] .",

These methods have further improved the safety of plasma-derived or plasmacontaining products such that no new cases of HIV, HBV, or HCV transmission from plasma or recombinant therapies have been reported in the US since 1997 [www.hemophilia.org]. However, solvent/detergent, which is the most common virus inactivation technique used in the preparation of plasma-derived products, is mainly effective against lipid-enveloped viruses, such as HIV, HBV, HCV, HTLV (human T-cell lymphotropic virus) and WNV (West Nile virus). NLE viruses, such as parvoviruses, enteroviruses and circoviruses, are resistant to inactivation via solvent/detergent treatment and to some degree against heat and radiation as well [12] . Parvovirus B19 (B19V) and two genotypes of parvovirus PARV4, have been found as contaminants in plasma-derived factor VIII concentrates [13, 14] . Thus, the risk of viral infection remains when plasma-derived and plasma-containing recombinant FVIII products are used [15, 16] . The cloning of the FVIII gene in 1984 [17, 18] led to the development of the first recombinant FVIII therapy (Recombinate, Baxter), which was initially licensed in the US in 1992. Recombinant FVIII products are now classified into three generations (as defined by MASAC, the Medical and Scientific Advisory Council of the National Hemophilia Foundation) based on the degree of elimination of plasma and albumin from production and/or formulation steps, as outlined in Table 1 [MASAC  #182 ]. First generation products use plasma and/or albumin during both the cell culture process and the final formulation steps, while 2 nd generation products use serum proteins during the cell culture process only. These early recombinant products were effective in reducing the risk of pathogen transmission but the presence of serum components was still a concern. Indeed, one first generation recombinant FVIII product containing human serum albumin (Kogenate, Bayer) was suggested as a source of B19V transmission [19] . Moreover, the presence of human or animal proteins in therapeutic products potentially puts patients at risk of contracting novel infections, including those caused by not-yet detectable pathogens. These concerns prompted MASAC to issue recommendation #106: \"Manufacturers of the recombinant products are strongly encouraged to avoid using human and animal proteins in manufacturing their products.\" Only by completely removing plasma proteins from the cell culture and final formulation processes could the risk of infectious disease transmission from recombinant products be totally eliminated. Such plasma-free recombinant proteins were classified as third generation products.",

Advate is produced in CHO cells that were adapted to grow in a medium free of human-and animal-derived additives. Specifically, the serum-and protein-free synthetic minimal medium used for producing Advate contains ultrafiltered soy bean peptides with an average molecular weight of < 500 Daltons, along with sugars, salts and other components which are added to further nourish the CHO cells. The FVIII is then purified through a series of chromatography steps, including an immunoaffinity chromatography process utilizing a monoclonal antibody produced from hybridoma cells grown for more than 30 generations in a plasma-free environment. Advate is then stabilized with trehalose [20] . Therefore, since Advate is never exposed to plasma, the risk of transmitting known and emerging bloodborne pathogens is eliminated. Current manufacturing processes address disease threats that have endangered the blood supply in the past, but there are others for which donated plasma is not routinely screened [12] . For example, human herpesvirus 8, the causative agent for Kaposi's sarcoma, has been shown to be transmitted through blood and blood products [21, 22] . Although the lipid membranes of enveloped viruses generally render them susceptible to inactivation by combinations of solvents and detergents, the transmission of lipid-enveloped WNV via blood transfusion [http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ mm5313a1.htm] still raises new concerns about the safety of the blood supply. Therefore, due to the fact that solvent/detergent and nanofiltration techniques are not 100% efficient against all pathogens, plasma components need to be completely removed from the manufacturing process in order to eliminate the risk of pathogen transmission through blood compo-nents.",

Consumption of meat contaminated with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) caused an outbreak of variant Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (vCJD) in the United Kingdom in 1996 [23, 24] . As of September 2008, 206 primary cases of vCJD had been reported in 11 countries, including the UK, US and France [http://www.cjd.ed.ac.uk/vcjdworld. htm]. Unlike cases of classic CJD, the prion that causes vCJD is found in higher concentrations in lymphoid tissues, and therefore presents a potential threat of transmission through blood and plasma [25] . Indeed, four transfusion-transmitted cases of vCJD have been reported [http://www.hpa.org.uk/ infections/topics_az/cjd/vCJDBloodDonors.htm, 26, 27] . In each confirmed case, the patient had received red blood cell products from donors who later developed vCJD. The latest case reported by the UK Health Protection Agency described an individual who was diagnosed with vCJD nine years after receiving a blood transfusion from an asympto- Biotechnol. J. 2009, 4, 186-201 www.biotechnology-journal.com matically infected donor. None of the four cases of transfusion-transmitted vCJD transmission have been associated with plasma-derived factor concentrates. No cases of vCJD transmission via blood transfusion have been reported in the US. However, the potential for vCJD transmission via plasma products cannot be excluded yet [28] . A nine year study in sheep [29] demonstrated that two different TSE agents (BSE and scrapie) have unexpectedly high rates of transmission through blood transfusion, with relatively short and consistent incubation periods. These experiments suggest that the infectivity titers in the blood are quite high, and that blood transfusion represents an efficient route of transmission for prions.",

Therefore, because proteins are often sensitive to a wide range of factors such as temperature, pH, surface adsorption and salt concentration, they are typically formulated with a mixture of excipients to ensure stability. These excipients include sugars, polyols, amino acids, polymers and often, serum albumin. In most cases, the final material must then be lyophilized to avoid loss of activity during storage.",

In addition, it is often the case that the recombinant protein is required in very small therapeutic doses and can be denatured by surface adsorption to glass vials.To prevent this issue, bulking agents like carbohydrates (e.g., sucrose), or proteins such as human serum albumin (HSA) or animal-derived gelatin are added in excess of the active protein. As a formulation excipient, HSA has an excellent stability and an acceptable safety profile [52, 53] , and along with gelatin, was traditionally among the most commonly used excipients. However, as is the case with all plasma-derived products, the risk of pathogen transmission could not be eliminated. Additionally, HSA exhibits structural heterogeneity and batch-to-batch variability; its pharmacopoeial purity requirement is only \u2265 96%, with the undesired components being a mixture of polymers of HSA and other contaminating plasma proteins remaining from the purification process [54] . Such concerns prompted manufacturers to switch to sugar-based final formulations and to develop a recombinant, plasma-free albumin produced in Saccharomyces cerevisiae for use as a stabilizer in biopharmaceutical manufacturing [55] . Similarly, Pichia pastoris yeast was engineered to produce recombinant animal-free gelatin, which presents a reduced risk of allergic responses compared to tissue-derived substances [56, 57] .",

            "text": "Most recombinant human proteins have been shown to be immunogenic [58] , although the antibody responses they generate are generally variable and of low titer. However, these antibodies can inhibit drug efficacy and cause life-threatening complications when directed against either endogenous self-proteins or exogenous therapeutic proteins [59] . The production of antibodies against recombinant proteins is influenced by several factors, including structural properties of the protein, formulation, dose, route of administration, presence of impurities and the formation of aggregates [60] . For example, high molecular weight complexes formed between rhIFN-\u03b12 and HSA have been linked to the formation of neutralizing antibodies against the interferon molecule [59] . This prompted researchers to develop albumin-free formulations [61] in which HSA is replaced by other excipients that can prevent oxidation, adsorption and aggregation.A new formulation of IFN-\u03b21a [RNF or Rebif New Formulation, EMD Serono] was approved in Europe in August 2007 for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. RNF is HSA-free and is produced by a CHO cell line in serum-free culture medium [62] . Overall results from a phase IIIb study suggest that RNF has improved local tolerability and immunogenicity compared with a historical study of the original formulation [63] , and the authors attribute these benefits largely to the absence of serum components (HSA and FBS) from the preparation. Optimizing the clinical outcomes following treatment with biopharmaceuticals is an issue of special relevance to immune-compromised patients struggling with chronic diseases. Repeated infusions over an extended period or over the lifetime of the patient increase the cumulative risk of pathogen transmission. Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAb) have presented an innovative approach to the treatment of illnesses in which the immune system may be compromised, such as cancer, autoimmune diseases and inflammatory disorders [64] . Successive waves of technology have advanced mAb development from murine antibodies to chimeric, humanized antibodies and finally to fully-human antibodies. mAb manufacturing is trending towards the adaptation of cell lines to serum-free media, along with the removal of animal components from the purification and formulation processes [45, [65] [66] [67] . One of the first examples of this trend is the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1) antagonist, which is approved for the treatment of several autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. The TNF antagonist has evolved from being a chimeric mAb produced from cells grown in media containg serum components (Remicade; Centocor) to a fully human anti-TNF\u03b1 mAb that is plasmafree in both its manufacturing and formulation (Humira; Abbott). Since TNF plays a critical role in modulating the inflammatory immune response, patients treated with TNF antagonists are at special risk for serious infections, which further emphasizes the need for such therapies to be completely pathogen-free. In preventive therapies such as vaccines, minimizing the risk of pathogen transmission is also of paramount importance since vaccines are typically administered to large numbers of children and elderly individuals.Animal proteinfree technology has been applied in the development of pandemic and seasonal influenza vaccines, in which embryonated egg-based technology is currently being replaced by mammalian cell lines grown in serum-free, protein-free medium. Examples include the Vero cell-based H5N1 pandemic mock-up vaccine that has completed preclinical development and is awaiting licensure (Baxter) and a new MDCK cell-based seasonal influenza vaccine that was recently licensed in Europe (Optaflu; Novartis).",

The prohibitive logistics and cost of dedicating equipment for at-risk patients may have made hospitals and dental providers less likely to offer standard services to these patients [68] . Problems such as these can be mitigated by providing previously untreated patients with products that have been manufactured without the addition of animalderived components. Such products are not only an obvious choice for young, previously-untreated and unexposed patients, but should also be considered for patients with existing infections (such as HIV, HBV, or HCV) who must be concerned about the introduction of additional pathogens, which could further complicate a pre-existing infection [69] .",

When alternatives to human-or animal-derived materials do not exist, the best measures available to assure product safety are to control the source of the raw material, test raw material for possible contamination by infectious agents, implement various virus-inactivation and removal steps, and test the end products to confirm absence of pathogens. Following the BSE outbreak, strict requirements were imposed on manufacturers of biologics and medical devices regarding the country of origin for bovine-derived material used in manufacturing [http://www.fda.gov/cber/bse/bse.htm]. Drug companies were forced to find alternatives as the list of countries provisionally free of mad cow disease dwindled. The list of restricted countries was updated in 1998 to include not only those countries where BSE was known to exist, but also countries where no cases of BSE had been identified but which were considered by the US Department of Agriculture to have less restrictive import requirements than the US, and/or independent surveillance. For biologics manufacturers, CBER (Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research) now requires that manufacturers provide detailed information on the cell culture history, isolation, media, identity and pathogen testing of cell lines used in the production of biological products. Additional source control measures include expanded human donor screening and deferral guidelines. However, safety regulations set forth by governments vary between countries, and these variations are compounded by donor screening policies that may differ even within the same country.",

More sensitive tests have been instituted, such as PCRbased nucleic acid amplification testing (NAT), including minipool NAT and single donor testing (ID NAT). For HIV and HCV, NAT is expected to shorten the lag time, during which infection cannot be detected, from 22 to 12 days for HIV and from 70 to 14 days for HCV; but NAT is not able to completely eliminate the lag time [24] .

These methods include pasteurization, vapor heating, low pH, solvent/detergent treatment, separation/purification techniques (such as ion-exchange and immunoaffinity chromatography) and nanofiltration.These steps have helped to significantly reduce the frequency of infections originating from the blood supply, especially for those pathogens for which screening is also performed. However, the risk from novel or emerging pathogens must be taken seriously [72] and, as noted by the CDC, \"in order to protect the safety of the blood supply and blood-derived therapies, it must be recognized that new pathogens will continue to emerge\" [73] . UK health officials withdrew all blood and blood products obtained from donors in which vCJD was subsequently detected, and today, all plasma used in the UK to produce therapeutics is imported. The UK is among many countries (including Australia, New Zealand, Denmark, Ireland, Canada and Japan) that are switching to recombinant products as a standard for the treatment of hemophilia A, and regulatory agencies and physicians' organizations in North America and Europe have prompted drug and device manufacturers to find alternatives to human and animal raw materials and additives whenever possible ( Table 2 ). The FDA and the International Conference on Har-monisation, which develops guidelines for the regulatory bodies of the European Union, Japan and the US, have provided documents guiding the sourcing, characterization and testing of raw materials derived from humans or animals, as well as guiding the evaluation of protein therapeutics for the presence of viruses [79] [80] [81] [82] . The objective is to avoid transmission of adventitious agents, an issue that would not exist if animal-free substances were used in the manufacturing process. Because of regulatory concerns about serum and other animalderived components, the same product can be manufactured in different formulations depending on the regulatory requirements of the country in which it is distributed. Aranesp (Amgen) is a recombinant human erythropoietin that has been modified to contain additional N-glycosylation sites to increase serum half life. Although Aranesp is available in both an HSA-containing and HSAfree formulation in the US, only the HSA-free formulation, containing polysorbate 80, is approved for use in Europe.",

The safety of biopharmaceuticals has come to the forefront for both patients and health care providers due to outbreaks of emerging pathogens, most notably HIV, HCV, vCJD, WNV and SARS, in multiple regions of the world [http://www.who. int/whr/2007/whr07_en.pdf]. The risk of pathogen transmission through the use of human-or animalderived raw materials in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals was the major driver behind the development of PF technology. Blood-derived products were at a special risk of harboring infectious agents and thus present the most important example of the shift to safe alternatives produced by PF manufacturing technology. Patients with hemophilia were at particularly high risk for infection by blood-borne pathogens because they relied on plasma-derived or plasma-containing clotting factor therapies. This excessively high risk was first evidenced by the transmission of HIV-1 to approximately half the hemophilia population prior to the availability of a screening assay for that virus [83] .",

Erythropoeisis-stimulating agents, which were introduced in the late 1980s for the management of anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease [84] , serve as a good illustration of the evolution of recombinant therapeutic protein manufacturing. First, a recombinant product replaced its blood-derived predecessors. In the next phase, a product with a longer half-life was developed (darbepoetin \u03b1 or Aranesp).This product then evolved through conversion to an HSA-free formulation [85] , followed by serum-free formulations of Epoetin \u03b1 (outside the US, Eprex; Ortho Biotech) and Epoetin \u03b2 (NeoRecormon; Roche). Most recently, a PF, PEGylated recombinant erythropoietin \u03b2 with a longer half-life was developed and licensed in Europe (Mircera; Roche).",

With the average cost of developing a biopharmaceutical product exceeding $1 billion [http://csdd. tufts.edu], manufacturers should make every effort to use the safest possible technologies, such as a PF manufacturing process. Given that no major infectious agent outbreaks have occurred in recent years, a false sense of security may be in place, but steps should be taken to avoid complacency. Such issues need to be addressed now that PF technology has matured and become more feasible, and this should be accomplished prior to the next major threat from a new, emerging pathogen. ",
