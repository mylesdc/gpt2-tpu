            "text": "Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterized by central nervous system inflammation and demyelination, and increasing evidence demonstrates significant neuronal damage also occurs and is associated with permanent functional impairment. Current MS therapies have limited ability to prevent neuronal damage, suggesting additional neuroprotective therapies are needed. Compounds that activate the NAD + -dependent SIRT1 deacetylase prevent neuronal loss in an autoimmune-mediated MS model, but the mechanism of this effect is unknown, and it is unclear whether SIRT1 activating compounds exert similar effects in demyelinating disease induced by other etiologies. We measured neuronal loss in C57BL/6 mice inoculated with a neurotropic strain of mouse hepatitis virus, MHV-A59, that induces an MS-like disease. Results: Oral treatment with the SIRT1 activating compound SRTAW04 significantly increased SIRT1 activity within optic nerves and prevented neuronal loss during optic neuritis, an inflammatory demyelinating optic nerve lesion that occurs in MS and its animal models. MHV-A59 induced neuronal loss was associated with reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, and SRTAW04 treatment significantly reduced ROS levels while promoting increased expression of enzymes involved in mitochondrial function and reduction of ROS. SRTAW04 exerted similar protective effects in EAE spinal cords, with decreased demyelination. Conclusions: Results demonstrate that SIRT1 activating compounds prevent neuronal loss in viral-induced demyelinating disease similar to their effects in autoimmune-mediated disease. One mechanism of this neuroprotective effect involves increasing mitochondrial biogenesis with reduction of oxidative stress. SIRT1 activators represent a potential neuroprotective therapy for MS. Understanding common mechanisms of these effects in distinct disease models will help identify targets for more specific therapies.",

Because the etiology is unknown, several MS animal models are used. The most common MS model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), is an autoimmune driven CNS demyelinating disease [12] that also exhibits neuronal damage [13] [14] [15] . Another MS model is induced by infection with a neurotropic strain of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), MHV-A59 [16, 17] . While MHV-A59 induces CNS inflammation and demyelination similar to EAE, the etiology is distinct, involving direct neuronal infection, and the demyelination is not dependant on an intact immune system [18] . Therefore, these models provide unique and contrasting systems for studying potential neuroprotective strategies for MS.",

Due to differences in replication and elimination, these doses result in equivalent viral loads in the CNS, and inoculation of each strain was performed as described previously [31, 32] . Mice were monitored daily for mortality and signs of disease [16, 17] . Mock-infected controls were inoculated similarly but with an uninfected cell lysate at a comparable dilution. SRTAW04 (Sirtris, a GSK company, Cambridge, MA) was prepared in PBS containing 0.5% methyl cellulose and 0.1% tween 80. Mice were treated with SRTAW04, 100 mg/kg/mouse/day by oral gavage. The dose was chosen based on previously measured pharmacokinetics of the drug and its ability to activate SIRT1 which has been used previously with maximal effects [27, 33, 34] . Seven day and 30 day treatment groups received SRTAW04 starting from day 1 until sacrifice. To evaluate whether the SRTAW04 target is SIRT1 and its activation, one group of mice received SIRT1 inhibitor EX527 (10 mg/kg/day i.p.) for 30 days [35] . EX527 has the highest inhibitory activity for SIRT1 compared to other analogues and previous studies have shown that EX527 treatment alone does not result in the acetylation of SIRT1/2 target p53 [36, 37] . We have previously shown that SIRT1 inhibitors or conditional deletion of the SIRT1 gene, do not exacerbate RGC loss in optic nerve disease models [24, 38] .",

Mice were killed 7 or 30 days after infection and each eye was removed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Retinas were isolated, prepared as flattened wholemounts, viewed with a fluorescence microscope (Eclipse E600; Nikon, Tokyo, Japan), and photographed at 20X magnification in 12 standard fields: 1/6, 3/6, and 5/6 of the retinal radius from the center of the retina in each quadrant. RGC numbers shown in each experiment represent the total number of RGCs counted per eye (RGCs/0.74 mm2). RGCs were counted by a masked investigator using image analysis software (Image-Pro Plus 5.0; Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). Alternatively, to confirm RGC numbers, RGC's were immunolabelled with antibodies to Brn3a. Retinas were dissected and flat as previously reported [39] .

Areas of demyelination in LFB staining were quantified using a 0-3 point scale as described earlier [21] 0 -no demyelination; 1 -rare foci of demyelination; 2 -a few foci of demyelination; and 3large (confluent) areas of demyelination.

On the 30th day mice were sacrificed 1 hr after SRTAW04 treatment and protein was extracted from optic nerves for SIRT1 activity assay. Optic nerves of MHV-A59 mice treated with SRTAW04 showed a significant increase in SIRT1 activity compared to control and untreated MHV-A59 infected mice (Figure 2b) . Interestingly, untreated MHV-A59 infected mouse optic nerves also showed a smaller but significant increase compared to control, possibly as a natural defense mechanism. We also examined levels of SIRT1 in retinas and optic nerves of mice after 7 or 30 days with or without treatment by SRTAW04. SIRT1 protein expression levels measured by Western blotting showed no significant differences between any treatment groups in day 30 optic nerves (Figure 2c) , with similar lack of change in day 7 optic nerves and in retinas at either time point (data not shown).",

The ability of SRTAW04 to attenuate neuronal loss in MHV-A59 infected mice was therefore examined. RGCs of 4 week old C57BL/6 mice were labeled with fluorogold and mice were inoculated with MHV-A59 one week later. The treatment group was administered SRTAW04 (100 mg/kg/day) by oral gavage starting from day 1 for 30 days. The decrease in RGC numbers in untreated MHV-A59 mice, compared to controls, was significantly attenuated by SRTAW04 treatment (Figure 3a) . To further confirm the neuroprotective effect of SRTAW04, 4 week old C57BL/6 mice were inoculated with recombinant strain of MHV, RSA59 and the treatment group was administered the same dose of SRTAW04 for 30 days with and without SIRT1 inhibitor EX527 (10 mg/kg/ day i.p.). After 30 days RGCs were labeled by Brn3a staining and counted. Consistent with MHV-A59 results (Figure 3a ) RSA59 induced a significant decrease in RGCs and treatment with SRTAW04 attenuated RGC loss. The SRTAW04 treatment group receiving EX527 showed a significant decrease in RGC numbers compared to the group that only received SRTAW04 (Figure 3b , c) demonstrating that the RGC protective effect of SRTAW04 is dependent on SIRT1. Treatment with SIRT1 inhibitor alone does not further reduce RGC survival (data not shown), similar to prior studies [24, 38] .",

Since tissue is limited in optic nerve, histologic studies were also performed using spinal cord, which has larger areas of white matter, to assess effects of SRTAW04 on demyelination. Spinal cords were isolated from mice infected with RSA59 for 30 days, treated with or without 100 mg/kg SRTAW04 daily, and demyelination levels were measured using LFB staining. Pathology was assessed in five to seven cross-sections of spinal cord from cervical, thoracic, and lumbar regions. Demyelinating plaques were quantified on a 0 to 3 scale in four quadrants from two spinal cord levels for each mouse. Spinal cord sections from the RSA59 infected group showed a significant increase in the demyelinating score compared to control and RSMHV2 infected groups (Figure 7a,b,d,f) . The group receiving SRTAW04 showed a significant decrease in the demyelinating score compared to RSA59 infected group (Figure 7a,f, h) .

Similar neuroprotective effects mediated by several SIRT1 activators were previously demonstrated in two different EAE models of MS, relapsing/remitting EAE in SJL/J mice [23, 24] and chronic EAE in C57BL/6 mice [22] , but the Figure 7 Effects of SRTAW04 on demyelination in the spinal cord.

The current results suggest SIRT1 activators can work by promoting mitochondrial function and reducing the accumulation of ROS. While such oxidative stress has been demonstrated previously in EAE [28, 30] , it was not clear whether similar mechanisms would be found in the MHV induced demyelinating disease. While we found that SIRT1 activation is associated with reduced accumulation of ROS in optic nerves, one limitation of this study that will be addressed in future studies is that a causal relation of this effect has not been confirmed using ROS inhibitors as positive controls.",

            "text": "Interestingly, pathogenesis of neuronal injury begins with different triggers in EAE optic neuritis as compared to MHV optic neuritis, despite similar gross levels of inflammation. Axonal injury and loss of neurons in relapsing/ remitting EAE occurs secondary to inflammation [47, 48] , predominantly mediated by effector T cells, whereas neurotropic strains of MHV can directly infect neurons leading to direct injury, and leading to myelin stripping by activated microglia/macrophages [18] . MHV induced disease also occurs even in the absence of lymphocytes [49] . The ability of SIRT1 activators to prevent neuronal loss in both models therefore suggests they modulate a common mechanism of neurodegeneration downstream of the initial mechanisms of injury. SIRT1 activators appear to work by increasing expression of proteins involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and reduction of ROS, and indicate these are important targets for neuroprotective therapies. Consistent with this, SIRT1 activators were found to have similar neuroprotective effects in a model of traumatic optic nerve injury [38] .",

There is a significant increase (*p < 0.05) in the inflammation score in the MHV-A59 treated mice compared to controls. No significant difference in the inflammation score is observed between the MHV-A59 infected group and MHV-A59 infected mice treated with SRTAW04. By day 30 post-innoculation, limited inflammation is observed by H&E staining in spinal cord, and inflammation that does occur consists almost exclusively of macrophages/microglia, thus sections (n = 4-5 per group) were immunostained for Iba1 to further assess relative levels of inflammation. A representative spinal cord section is shown from (b) control, (c) RSMHV2 infected, (d) RSA59 infected, (e) RSA59 infected + SRTAW04 treatment and (f) RSA59 infected + SRTAW04 + EX527 treatment mice.

However, resveratrol also modulates a variety of cellular signaling pathways independent of its ability to activate SIRT1, exerting a number of potentially beneficial effects including anti-carcinogenic properties, anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting pro-inflammatory mediators and/or activated immune cells, and inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthase and cycooxygenase-2 [53, 54] . For the current studies, we used the SIRT1 activator SRTAW04 to avoid activating other pathways affected by resveratrol. In addition, compounds like SRTAW04 that activate SIRT1 by distinct mechanisms from resveratrol exert similar SIRT1 activation levels at concentrations an order of magnitude lower than resveratrol [33] , and have shown good safety profiles in early phase clinical trials. In addition, we have shown previously that SRTAW04 itself prevents oxidative stress-induced loss of neurons in vitro [27] .",

SIRT1 was originally identified as a histone deacetylase [55, 56] , leading to large changes in overall gene expression, but SIRT1 also has been found to deacetylate a number of other protein targets [57, 58] , including transcription factors that may directly affect expression of specific genes. In addition, post-translational modifications of mitochondrial enzymes may further promote mitochondrial biogenesis, as SIRT1-mediated deacetylation of PGC1-\u03b1 has been shown to do in muscle cells [26] . Results here show that transient increases in SIRT1 activity following administration of SRTAW04 were capable of providing long-term neuroprotective effects in MHV-A59 infected mice, suggesting that deacetylation of SIRT1 substrates may persist beyond the timing of acute SIRT1 activation.",

Unlike EAE models of MS mediated by T cells, in this virus induced model of MS inflammation consists almost exclusively of macrophages, as demonstrated in prior studies [18, 21, 42] . It is interesting that SIRT1 activation fails to block the migration of macrophages into the CNS, as prior studies have shown that SIRT1 activation can block the accumulation of macrophages in peripheral tissues [59] , although even outside the CNS this effect appears to be tissue specific.",

Our results show that SIRT1 activation can preserve RGCs and reduce axonal loss following infection with MHV. SRTAW04 treated mice that also received the SIRT1 inhibitor EX527 did not show a significant reduction in axonal loss or preserve RGCs, suggesting that the neuroprotective effect of SRTAW04 is mediated by SIRT1 activation. Furthermore, SIRT1 activation with SRTAW04 prevented myelin loss following MHV infection. These findings are consistent with a recent study [63] showing that mice overexpressing SIRT1 in neurons have reduced axonal loss and demyelination in the EAE model of MS. Together, results suggest SIRT1 promotes neuronal survival and prevents demyelination in CNS demyelinating diseases.",
