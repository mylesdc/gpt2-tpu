In contrast, the epidemiology of \u03b4-CoVs in wild birds in the US is largely unknown. Our aim was to comparatively assess the prevalence of \u03b4and \u03b3-CoVs in wild migratory terrestrial and aquatic birds in Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio, Tennessee and Wisconsin. A total of 1236 cloacal/fecal swabs collected during the period 2015-2018 were tested for \u03b3and \u03b4-CoVs using genus-specific reverse transcription-PCR assays. A total of 61 (4.99%) samples were \u03b3-CoV positive, with up to 29 positive samples per state. In contrast, only 14 samples were positive for \u03b4-CoV (1.14%) with only 1-4 originating from the same state. Thus, unlike previous reports from Asia, \u03b3-CoVs are more prevalent than \u03b4-CoVs in the US, suggesting that \u03b4-CoVs may spread in birds with lower efficiency. This may indicate \u03b4-CoV emerging status and incomplete adaptation to new host species limiting its spread. Phylogenetic analysis of the partial N gene revealed that the newly identified \u03b4-CoV strains were most closely related to the HKU20 (wigeon) strain. Further studies are necessary to investigate the role of aquatic bird \u03b4-CoVs in the epidemiology of \u03b4-CoVs in swine and terrestrial birds. Viruses 2019, 11, 897 2 of 11",

In a screening study of 918 wild Australian birds, 141 of them tested positive for CoVs. After sequencing, \u03b4-CoV was detected in pacific black ducks, curlew sandpiper, red-necked stints, ruddy turnstones, and pied herons [6] . However, \u03b3-CoV (80% of sequenced samples) was identified more frequently than \u03b4-CoV (20% of sequenced samples) [6] . \u03b3-CoV was also detected in quails and pheasants in Italy [7] . RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) analyses found that quail were also infected with \u03b4-CoV [7]. Wild birds harbor genetically diverse \u03b4-CoV with some of them potentially transmittable to pigs [8] . A previous report from Brazil showed that \u03b4-CoVs were detected in two species of wild terrestrial birds, purple-breasted-parrot and plain parakeet. These avian CoVs were monophyletically related to CoVs from Sparrow (SPaCoV HKU19) and swine (PorCoV HKU15), which were also found to be \u03b4-CoV. This information supports the hypothesis that \u03b4-CoV can cross inter-species barriers, with the potential to transmit from birds to swine [8] .",

These three novel \u03b4-CoVs clustered with a \u03b4-CoV detected in Asian leopard cats [10]; however, further studies are necessary to understand interspecies transmission from birds [9]. In a surveillance study in Hong Kong and Cambodia, \u03b4-CoVs were found in different wild aquatic birds: gray herons, pond herons, great cormorants, black-faced spoonbills, and several duck species [11] . \u03b4-CoVs do not cause severe illness in birds, leading to their endemic nature in the avian population [11] . In a screening study for \u03b4-CoVs in China, none were found in Asian leopard cats, bats, domestic cats, cattle, chickens, dogs, humans, monkeys, and rodents [12] . The investigators discovered seven novel \u03b4-CoVs in pigs and wild birds (white-eye, sparrow, magpie robin, night heron, wigeon, and common moorhen) [12] . Genome sequencing and comparative genome analysis showed that avian and swine \u03b4-CoVs had similar genome characteristics and structures [12] . Similarly, a recent study in the US described a novel sparrow \u03b4-CoV that clustered together with PDCoV [13] and other terrestrial, but aquatic bird \u03b4-CoVs.",

This emphasizes the increased risk for direct interspecies transmission and that in contrast to waterfowl, terrestrial birds may act as intermediate hosts and are commonly found in the sites of bird-swine co-mingling [8]. In Finland, two different avian \u03b4-CoV strains from lesser black-backed gull and black-headed gull were detected which shared 83% and 85% nucleotide identity with avian and mammalian \u03b4-CoVs, respectively [14] .",

Porcine \u03b4-CoV is being studied extensively in the US and elsewhere [4, 5] . In contrast, the diversity and epidemiology of \u03b4-CoVs in wild birds in the US are largely unknown. The association of porcine \u03b4-CoV with enteric disease in pigs and its continuous spread underscore an urgent need to further investigate the mechanisms of its persistence and spread. Extensive epidemiological studies are needed to evaluate \u03b4-CoV prevalence in avian species, swine farms, pig-bird comingling sites and high pig-traffic sites such as abattoirs, assembly yards and truck washes. In this study, we investigated the prevalence of \u03b4and \u03b3-CoVs in wild migratory terrestrial and aquatic birds in Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio, Tennessee, and Wisconsin.

The virus evolves through an accumulation of point mutations and both homologous and non-homologous recombination. It is hypothesized that this ability to recombine allows the virus to evolve and create new forms which can target different species [4] . \u03b1-CoV and \u00df-CoV infect multiple species of mammals, but \u03b3-CoV is only known to infect birds.

The positive sampling locations are shown in Figure 2 . The bird species identified were the blue winged teal (Spatula discors) (n = 6), snow goose (Anser caerulescens) (n = 4), mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) (n = 2), red-tailed hawk (Anser caerulescens) (n = 1) and northern shoveler (Spatula clypeata) (n = 1). Of these 14 positive samples, only up to 4 originated from the same state ( Figure 1B) , suggesting that \u03b4-CoVs spread with low efficiency in the avian species tested. Of note, the red-tailed hawk was sampled upon intake to a wildlife rehabilitation center. Interestingly, the prevalence of \u03b4-CoV in aquatic birds was 1.34% compared to only 0.6% in terrestrial birds, suggesting that aquatic birds represent an important natural reservoir for CoVs. Blue-winged teal and snow goose were the two species associated with the most frequent recovery of \u03b4-CoVs (Table 1) .",

All amplicons generated with degenerate UDCoV-specific primers were confirmed to contain \u03b4-CoV N-gene sequences sharing ~69%-80% nucleotide identity with various avian \u03b4-CoV species. However, due to a high number of degenerate nucleotides incorporated in these primers to allow for broad reactivity and detection of highly diverse porcine and avian \u03b4-CoVs, the amplicons were not of satisfactory quality, with up to 10% of ambiguous nucleotides (Ns). Thus, we selected 4 \u03b4-CoV positive samples ( Table 2 ) that had sufficient amounts of RNA and subjected them to NGS sequencing ( Table 2 ). For one of the samples, Blue Winged Teal coronavirus/USA/Illinois2562/2017, NGS recovered approximately 42% of eukaryotic (host genome; normal; incidental), 20% bacteria, 5% virus, and 33% other. Bacterial reads identified Fusobacterium nucleatum (18%), while further analyses of viral and \"other\" reads identified various bacteriophage (80%).

However, this is higher compared with that observed in our previous study (0.5%) that analyzed Ohio samples from the period 2013-2014 [16] . Also, of these 14 positive samples, only up to 4 originated from the same state, suggesting that \u03b4-CoVs spread with low efficiency in the avian species tested. Additionally, our inability to recover CoV sequences by NGS suggests that they are present in the samples at lower frequency compared with other microorganisms. The latter is more suggestive of asymptomatic carrier status as opposed to acute infection associated with clinical disease. These findings suggest that avian species likely represent a natural reservoir of \u03b4-CoVs, while pigs and other mammals serve as spillover hosts.",

This suggests that aquatic birds may represent a natural reservoir for CoVs of terrestrial birds and pigs, and their concentration or survival may be increased in water sources compared with other avian habitats. Similarly, in a surveillance study in Hong Kong and Cambodia, \u03b4-CoV was found in different wild aquatic bird species including gray herons, pond herons, great cormorants, black-faced spoonbills, and several duck species, whereas \u03b3-CoVs were found in little whistling ducks, tufted ducks, common teals, northern shovelers, eurasian wigeons, and northern pintails [11] . In wild Australian birds, \u03b4-CoV was detected in pacific black ducks, but it was also detected in terrestrial birds such as curlew sandpiper, red-necked stints, ruddy turnstones, and pied herons [6] . This suggests that wild birds are major reservoirs of a wide range of \u03b4and \u03b3-CoVs, and the circulation of CoVs without association with clinical disease is more common than previously recognized [11] . However, it is important to note that \u03b4-CoVs identified in terrestrial birds and pigs are more similar each other phylogenetically [12, 13, 21] , and those from aquatic/wading birds are genetically more distinct. It is of interest, that prevalence of both \u03b3-(92%) and \u03b4-CoVs (86%, Table 1 ) was higher in colder (October-February) than in warmer (March-September) months. This indicates that, similar to previous findings on avian, animal and human CoVs, there are may be seasonal (and migration associated) fluctuations in the prevalence of avian coronaviruses in wild bird in the US [22] [23] [24] [25] .",

While a small pilot study failed to identify porcine \u03b4-CoVs in wild waterfowl in the Mississippi Flyway [27] , the overlap of the bird migratory pathways and high density swine farms creates favorable conditions for birds and pigs to exchange \u03b4-CoV pools directly or through some other intermediate hosts.
