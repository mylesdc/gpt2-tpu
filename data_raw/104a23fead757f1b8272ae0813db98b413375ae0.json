Herein we tested the hypothesis that pneumococci activated pulmonary epithelial cell cytokine release by c-Jun-NH 2 -terminal kinase (JNK) Methods: Human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) or epithelial HEK293 cells were infected with S. pneumoniae R6x and cytokine induction was measured by RT-PCR, ELISA and Bioplex assay. JNKphosphorylation was detected by Western blot and nuclear signaling was assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). JNK was modulated by the small molecule inhibitor SP600125 and AP1 by transfection of a dominant negative mutant.",

Furthermore, pneumococci infection resulted in JNK phosphorylation in BEAS-2B cells. Inhibition of JNK by small molecule inhibitor SP600125 reduced pneumococci-induced IL-8 mRNA expression and release of IL-8 and IL-6. One regulator of the il8 promoter is JNK-phosphorylated activator protein 1 (AP-1). We showed that S. pneumoniae timedependently induced DNA binding of AP-1 and its phosphorylated subunit c-Jun with a maximum at 3 to 5 h after infection. Recruitment of Ser 63/73 -phosphorylated c-Jun and RNA polymerase II to the endogenous il8 promoter was found 2 h after S. pneumoniae infection by chromatin immunoprecipitation. AP-1 repressor A-Fos reduced IL-8 release by TLR2-overexpressing HEK293 cells induced by pneumococci but not by TNF\u03b1. Antisense-constructs targeting the AP-1 subunits Fra1 and Fra2 had no inhibitory effect on pneumococci-induced IL-8 release.",

Since the pulmonary epithelium constitutes a large surface, which is in direct contact with invading pathogens, analysis of the interaction between pathogens and pulmonary epithelial cells is of considerable interest.",

Moreover, we recently demonstrated that cytosolic Nod2 protein [10] recognized invading, cytosolic pneumococci. Pneumococci infection of lung epithelial cells initiated complex signaling pathways leading to activation of the canonical NF-\u03baB pathway and subsequent expression of pro-inflammatory genes. Activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways participated in lung cell activation by pneumococci. For example, p38 MAPK activation induced phosphorylation of NF-\u03baB p65/RelA at serine 536 at the interleukin-8 (IL-8) promoter thus paving the way for RNA polymerase II recruitment, and subsequent IL-8 transcription in pneumococci infected epithelium [11] . In addition, stimulation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase JNK/SAPK kinase was shown in pneumococci infected cells [12] . In other model systems, JNK was shown to subsequently activate transcription factor activator protein-1 (AP-1) [13] , a central regulator of cytokine expression, by phosphorylating its component c-Jun on serine 63 and serine 73 in the NH 2 -terminal activation domain [14, 15] .",

After proteinase K digestion (1 \u03bcg/8 \u03bcl for 6 h at 37\u00b0C and 6 h at 65\u00b0) DNA was extracted using a PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). il8 promoter DNA was amplified by PCR using Hotstart Taq (Qiagen) polymerase. The PCR conditions were 95\u00b0C for 15 min, 33 -35 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 20 s, 60\u00b0C for 20 s, 72\u00b0C for 20 s. PCR products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and detected by ethidium bromide staining. Equal amounts of input DNA was controlled by gel electrophoresis.",

In S. pneumoniae-infected BEAS-2B cells, we detected JNK2 phosphorylation starting at 30 min post infection ( Fig. 2A) . After 4 h, pneumococci induced JNK2 phosphorylation similar to TNF\u03b1. Inhibition of JNK by specific chemical inhibitor SP600125 dose-dependently reduced S. pneumoniae-induced IL-8 protein release (Fig.  2B ) and levels of IL-8 mRNA (Fig. 2C ) in human lung epithelial BEAS-2B cells. Exemplarily, release of the important inflammatory cytokine IL-6 was also analyzed in cells with inhibited JNK kinase (Fig. 2D ). 10 ng/ml of JNK inhibitor SP600125 reduced pneumococci-induced IL-6 release by 50 % (Fig. 2D) , while 1 ng/ml had no significant effect (data not shown).

            "text": "Although S. pneumoniae is the major pathogen of community-acquired pneumonia [30] , little is known about its interaction with target cells, and particularly, with lung epithelial cells [31] . Infection of the human tracheobronchial epithelial cell line BEAS-2B with pneumococci resulted in release of a broad panel of regulatory cyto-, chemokines and growth factors. For example, strong release of the chemoattractants IL-8 (polymorphonuclear neutrophils) and MCP-1 (monocytes) was found. In addition, Th1 cytokines IFN\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1, as well as Th2 cytokines like IL-4, IL-6, and IL-13 were released after pneumococci infection. Prominent secretion of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1\u03b2 was observed as well as liberation of myeloid growth factors G-CSF and IL-7. Interestingly, in addition to pro-inflammatory factors, infection of BEAS-2B cells with pneumococci resulted also in production of anti-inflammatory IL-10. This pattern of immunomodulatory factors released by cultured lung epithelial BEAS cells in vitro may indicate that activation of tracheobronchial epithelial cells by pneumococci in vivo impact on immune reaction in pneumococcal infection. Furthermore, the lung epithelium express membrane bound PRRs (e.g. TLR) [32] as well as cytosolic receptors (e.g. NACHT-LRR protein Nod2) [10] , suitable for the detection of invading pneumococci. Taken these facts in consideration, the lung epithelium may function as an important sentinel system for the detection of lung pathogens rather than only comprising a \"passive\" epithelial barrier.",

Moreover, JNK inhibition by the chemical inhibitor SP600125 reduced pneumococci-related IL-8 mRNA expression and cytokine release (IL-8, IL-6), while intracellular IL-8 and IL-6 levels remained unchanged. Although other bacteria causing pneumonia, such as Legionella pneumophila were shown to activate JNK in human monocytotic cells [33] , there are no further studies analyzing JNK activation after infection of pulmonary epithelial cells with bacteria. In rodent models, current studies suggest an important role of JNK for the regulation of lung inflammation besides pneumococci infection. Lipopolysaccharide-related pulmonary neutrophil influx e.g. was limited by inhibition of JNK [34] and this kinase played an important role in ventilation-induced neutrophil infiltration [27] . Moreover, JNK seems to be important for the regulation of the viabil-AP-1 repressor blocked S. pneumoniae-induced IL-8 release ity of lung epithelium after exposure to active nitrogen species [35] . Although JNK is known to be stimulated by many different types of cellular stress, such as UV, \u03b3 -irradiation and pathogen infection, it is reasonable to suggest, that TLR-or Nod-related signaling mediates JNK activation by pneumococci. However, it could not be ruled out that oxidative stress induced by pneumococci-released hydrogen peroxide contributed to JNK activation. Overall, pneumococci-related JNK activation may be an important signaling step in the pneumococci-host interaction process.",

The AP-1 transcription factor is mainly composed of Jun, Fos and ATF protein dimers [38, 39] . We found increased AP-1 DNA-binding after pneumococci infection of human lung epithelial cells in EMSA as well as increased DNA binding of phosphorylated AP-1-subunit c-Jun in a specific ELISA demonstrating AP-1 transcription factor activation. Next, we specifically addressed the il8 promoter by ChIP and noted recruitment of Ser 63/73phosphorylated c-Jun and Pol II to the endogenous il8 promoter after S. pneumoniae-infection of human lung epithelial cells. In addition, expression of CMV500-A-Fos, a superrepressor of c-Jun-containing AP-1 dimers [19] , strongly reduced pneumococci-, but not TNF\u03b1-induced IL-8 release verifying the central role of JNK-AP-1 for pneumococci-related IL-8 expression. In contrast to A-Fos, Fra1 and Fra2 proteins -which lack potent transactivation domains -seems not to be involved in pneumococci induced IL-8 expression as evidenced by experiments using antisense constructs for Fra1 or Fra2 [40, 41] .",

In addition, stretching of these cells also resulted in JNK-AP-1 dependent IL-8 expression [45] . Although analyzing non-lung cell lines, He et al. provided evidence that severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus CoV nucleocapsid activated c-Fos suggesting that, besides bacteria, viruses may also induce JNK-AP-1-dependent gene transcription in the lung [46] . However, although cumulating evidence suggests an important role of the JNK-AP-1 signaling pathway in lung inflammation, including pneumococcal pneumonia, several questions remain open. For example, the capability of other important lung pathogens like Legionella, viruses or fungi to activate the JNK-AP-1 pathway should be analyzed. In vivo experiments addressing the effect of JNK inhibitors in pneumonia models would help to estimate the therapeutic potential of such inhibitors in lung inflammation. Finally, it would be of interest to analyze these signaling pathways in different human primary pulmonary epithelial cells (e.g. small airways, type-I-, type-IIcells).",
