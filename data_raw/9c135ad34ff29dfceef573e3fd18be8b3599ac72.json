[9] [10] [11] [12] While NIV may initially avoid the need for intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) , several studies have reported high failure rates and the need for invasive ventilation among patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and an association with increased mortality. 12 In a recent analysis from the LUNG SAFE study on unselected patients with ARDS, NIV was associated with higher intensive care unit (ICU) mortality in patients with the ratio of partial pressure of oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO 2 /FiO 2 ) lower than 150 mm Hg. 12 The role of NIV in AHRF secondary to viral respiratory infections is unclear. Although some uncontrolled studies suggested that NIV was effective and safe in management of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), [13] [14] [15] others have highlighted concern of increased transmission risk to healthcare workers when patients with SARS are treated with NIV. 16 Use of NIV in AHRF caused by pandemic H1N12009 virus (pdmH1N1) infection has been reported from several countries, [17] [18] [19] with reported NIV failure reaching up to 85%. 17 All studies were limited by their retrospective nature and, often, small sample size.",

Arabi, College of Medicine, King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, King Abdullah International Medical Research Center, Intensive Care Department, King Abdulaziz Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Email: Arabi@ngha.med.saBackground: Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) has been used in patients with the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, but the effectiveness of this approach has not been studied.Methods: Patients with MERS from 14 Saudi Arabian centers were included in thisanalysis. Patients who were initially managed with NIV were compared to patients who were managed only with invasive mechanical ventilation (invasive MV).Results: Of 302 MERS critically ill patients, NIV was used initially in 105 (35%) patients, whereas 197 (65%) patients were only managed with invasive MV. Patients who were managed with NIV initially had lower baseline SOFA score and less extensive infiltrates on chest radiograph compared with patients managed with invasive MV. The vast majority (92.4%) of patients who were managed initially with NIV required intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation, and were more likely to require inhaled nitric oxide compared to those who were managed initially with invasive MV. ICU and hospital length of stay were similar between NIV patients and invasive MV patients. The use of NIV was not independently associated with 90-day mortality (propensity score-adjusted odds ratio 0.61, 95% CI [0.23, 1.60] P = 0.27).Conclusions:In patients with MERS and acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, NIV failure was very high.

However, it is important to note that the process responsible for higher requirement for inhaled nitric oxide in patients treated with NIV could be related to timing of transition from NIV to invasive mechanical ventilation (ie, if transition were delayed) rather than the use of NIV per se. Finally, the confidence interval around the point estimate for the association of initial NIV and 90day mortality is wide; therefore, a real difference cannot be entirely be excluded in either direction. However, given the very high failure rate, our data therefore indicate that use of NIV in patients with MERS should generally be avoided unless it was used for patients with the least severity of illness.Our study has certain strengths. This is the largest cohort examining ventilation practices among critically ill patients with MERS that contains detailed demographic, baseline characteristics, physiology, interventions, and outcomes. Our study is also subject to several limitations. Due to the retrospective nature of the study, we do not have detailed settings of NIV (eg, PEEP and driving pressure), data on patient tolerance, the type of NIV mask interface (nasal or full-face mask), pre-ICU use of NIV, and reasons for intubation.We do not have data to address the association of NIV vs invasive ventilation with subsequent nosocomial pneumonia. Our study was not designed to address infection control issues related to NIV and risk of transmission to healthcare workers, and therefore, we cannot report on this outcome that is important to healthcare workers and other patients. Although we adjusted for imbalances in baseline characteristics using propensity score, the effect of residual unmeasured confounding cannot be excluded. Given the retrospective nature of our study, the potential effect of indication bias exists. For example, our data show that less severely ill patients as reflected by SOFA were more likely to have been managed by NIV. Nevertheless, we accounted for SOFA in the propensity score, and if residual bias exists, it would likely favor (show better outcomes with) NIV, making our findings a conservative estimate of any potential risks associated with NIV. In addition, the potential for lead-time bias exists. Patients receiving NIV may have presented with less advanced disease, and the disease may have merely progressed while on NIV to the same point at which patients with more advanced had already presented and required invasive ventilation from outset. Due to limited number of patients who avoided intubation, we were not powered to identify independent predictors for NIV success.",
