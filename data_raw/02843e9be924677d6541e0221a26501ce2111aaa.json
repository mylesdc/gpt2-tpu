PTEC and PBEC were cultured under ALI conditions for four weeks. Histological staining of semi-thin sections indicated that both cultures showed the characteristic appearance of a pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium (Fig. 1A) , similar to that obtained by H&E staining of tissue derived from the primary bronchus and trachea of swine (Fig. 1B) .

Co-localization of Maackia amurensis agglutinin II (MAA II) and Sambucus nigra agglutinin (SNA) signals (Fig. 2B , arrows) indicates that some cells expressed sialic acids in both linkage types.

Strong MAA II staining is found in the same area that is stained by the basal cell marker (compare 2A and 2C) indicating that basal cells mainly contain \u03b1 2,3-linked sialic acids.

R1 is derived from the pandemic strain A/Hong Kong/1/68 (H3N2) and has a binding preference to \u03b1 2,6-linked sialic acids. R2 differs from R1 by two mutations in the haemagglutinin and prefers binding to \u03b1 2,3-linked sialic acid 12 . WdPBEC cultures on filter supports were inoculated by R1 or R2 from the apical surface at an MOI of 0.25. At all time points analysed, the titre of R1 virus released from the apical side of wdPBEC was somewhat higher than that of R2 (Fig. 3A ). This result is consistent with the abundant presence of the \u03b1 2,6-linkage type on the apical surface, but it also shows that R2 is able to replicate to substantial titres despite the low amount of \u03b1 2,3-linked sialic acid detected by MAA staining (Fig. 2B ). When IAV was applied from the basal side of wdPBEC, there was no significant difference in the replication kinetics irrespective of the binding preference for \u03b1 2,3-or \u03b1 2,6-linked sialic acids (Fig. 3A ).",

This defence mechanism is based on the mucins produced by mucus-producing cells and the ciliary activity of specialized epithelial cells that transport the mucus out of the respiratory tract 4, 5 . To understand the infection of airway epithelial cells, it is necessary to use culture systems that comprise mucus-producing cells and ciliated cells. To this end, we and others studied IAV infection in differentiated ALI cultures of human airway epithelial cells which contain all major cell types present in human airway epithelium in vivo, namely, ciliated cells, secretory cells and basal cells [12] [13] [14] [15] . Here we developed and employed swine ALI (swALI) cultures that can be used to analyze the infection by both human and swine IAV 16, 17 . Compared to the human counterpart, swALI cells have the advantage that the source of cells is well-defined and WdPBEC were inoculated with IAV from apical (left panels) or basolateral (right panels) sides at an MOI of 0.25. Viruses released from the apical side were harvested at different time points and titrated by focus-forming assay in MDCK cells. The results were shown as means \u00b1 SEM of nine PBECs from three independent donors (swIAV) or six PBECs from two donors (R1 and R2). Each sample was processed with two technical replicates. It should be noted that some error bars are too small to be printed. Statistical analysis was performed with twotailed unpaired Student's t-test (***P < 0.001, **P < 0.01, *P < 0.05).",

The amount of infectious virus released from the apical surface remained high during the whole infection period analyzed, i.e. up to eight dpi. This long period of virus release may be related to the ALI culture conditions. As influenza virions are released from the apical side of the polarized epithelial cells, spread of infection is expected not to be as efficient as in the case of immortalized cells which are covered by medium. Interaction with mucins may further hamper the spread of infection, because the viral binding to sialic acids has to be counteracted by the viral neuraminidase 22 . The infection by IAV was detrimental for the airway epithelial cells as indicated by the detection of apoptotic cells. Another effect of the infection was a significant reduction in the amount of cilia detected on infected airway epithelial cells. The reduction was more pronounced in swIAV-infected cultures compared to cells infected by either of the two human IAV. The difference is consistent with a more efficient infection by swIAV as indicated by the 10-fold increased amount of virus released into the supernatant. The reduced staining of \u03b2 -tubulin can be explained by the loss of ciliated cells, probably due to the apoptotic effect of the infection mentioned above. This conclusion is based on the reduced thickness of the epithelial cell layer at late times of infection that was observed in parallel to the loss of cilia staining. The loss of cilia and the reduction in epithelial thickness were also observed in swIAV-infected porcine trachea tissue explants 23 . The loss of ciliated cells was clearly detected with cultures infected by swIAV. In the case of human IAV, where the foci of infected cells were not as large as those of swIAV-infected ALI cultures, the thickness of the epithelial layer was not significantly reduced. Our results are consistent with data from IAV infections in swine. Airways infected by swIAV have been reported to be lined by flattened epithelial layers 24 .",

            "text": "Despite the detrimental effect of the infection by IAV, the TEER of the epithelial layer and the tight junction protein expression were retained during the whole infection period. A recent study reported IAV infection interrupts the tight junction formation in an in vitro alveolar culture model comprising immortalized epithelial 25 . In our study, however, the well differentiated tracheal and bronchial epithelia retain their barrier function. The finding of epithelial cells with tight junctions indicates that the lost ciliated cells were replaced by polarized cells that were able to maintain the barrier function of the epithelium. It appears that basal cells had started to differentiate into specialized cells. This process had not yet proceeded to the appearance of ciliated cells and mucus-producing cells, or other non-ciliated cells, but the differentiation had resulted in polarized epithelial cells that were sufficient to maintain the barrier function as indicated by the TEER. The reorganization of the epithelial cells has also been observed in a report, where mice were infected by IAV in vivo 26 . The intermediate position of the polarized cells is shown by our lectin staining data, which may indicate that the cells are in a differentiation process. Undifferentiated human airway epithelial cells have been shown to contain \u03b1 2,3-linked sialic acids and the expression of \u03b1 2,6-linked sialic acids is increasing over time during the differentiation phase 27 . Whereas \u03b1 2,6-linked sialic acids are abundantly present on well-differentiated cells, basal cells mainly contained \u03b1 2,3-linked sialic acids. Both linkage types of sialic acids were detected in polarized cells at late times of infection indicating an increased amount of \u03b1 2,3-linked sialic acid on the apical surface of the epithelium compared to the uninfected state.",

On the other side, the loss of well-differentiated cells is compensated by the generation of polarized cells that maintain the barrier function of the epithelial cell layer which may contribute to the restriction of the infection to the respiratory tract. Thus, the localized infection by IAV is not only a matter of the availability of proteases required for proteolytic activation of virus infectivity but is also the result of the maintenance of the barrier function of the airway epithelium.",

This provides an explanation why prior virus infection renders the host more susceptible to the co-infection by another viral or bacterial pathogen. In this context it is interesting to note that the above mentioned increase of the \u03b1 2,3-linked sialic acids on the apical surface indicates an increased abundance of receptors for avian influenza viruses. Therefore, it is intriguing to speculate that swIAV infection renders epithelial cell more susceptible to infection by avian IAV and thus facilitates co-infection and the appearance of reassortant viruses. Such events are assumed to be responsible for the generation of pandemic viruses.",
