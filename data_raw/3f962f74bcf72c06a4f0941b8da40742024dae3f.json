            "text": "Since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the three-dimensional structures of several of the replicase/transcriptase components of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the non-structural proteins (Nsps), have been determined. However, within the large Nsp3 (1922 amino-acid residues), the structure and function of the so-called SARSunique domain (SUD) have remained elusive. SUD occurs only in SARS-CoV and the highly related viruses found in certain bats, but is absent from all other coronaviruses. Therefore, it has been speculated that it may be involved in the extreme pathogenicity of SARS-CoV, compared to other coronaviruses, most of which cause only mild infections in humans. In order to help elucidate the function of the SUD, we have determined crystal structures of fragment 389-652 (''SUD core '') of Nsp3, which comprises 264 of the 338 residues of the domain. Both the monoclinic and triclinic crystal forms (2.2 and 2.8 \u00c5 resolution, respectively) revealed that SUD core forms a homodimer. Each monomer consists of two subdomains, SUD-N and SUD-M, with a macrodomain fold similar to the SARS-CoV X-domain. However, in contrast to the latter, SUD fails to bind ADP-ribose, as determined by zone-interference gel electrophoresis. Instead, the entire SUD core as well as its individual subdomains interact with oligonucleotides known to form G-quadruplexes. This includes oligodeoxy-as well as oligoribonucleotides. Mutations of selected lysine residues on the surface of the SUD-N subdomain lead to reduction of Gquadruplex binding, whereas mutations in the SUD-M subdomain abolish it. As there is no evidence for Nsp3 entering the nucleus of the host cell, the SARS-CoV genomic RNA or host-cell mRNA containing long G-stretches may be targets of SUD. The SARS-CoV genome is devoid of G-stretches longer than 5-6 nucleotides, but more extended G-stretches are found in the 39-nontranslated regions of mRNAs coding for certain host-cell proteins involved in apoptosis or signal transduction, and have been shown to bind to SUD in vitro. Therefore, SUD may be involved in controlling the host cell's response to the viral infection. Possible interference with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-like domains is also discussed.

Therefore, protein domains encoded by the SARS-CoV genome that are absent in other coronaviruses are of particular interest, because they may be responsible for the extraordinary virulence. The most prominent such domain has been identified by bioinformatics as part of nonstructural protein 3 (Nsp3) of the virus and appropriately named the ''SARS-unique domain'' (SUD) [1] . With a molecular mass of 213 kDa, Nsp3 is the largest of the non-structural proteins of SARS coronavirus (see Figure 1 ). Comprising 1922 amino-acid residues (polyprotein 1a/1ab residues Ala819 to Gly2740), SARS-CoV Nsp3 is larger than the entire replicase of Picornaviridae. It contains at least seven subdomains [2] : An N-terminal acidic domain (Ac, also called Nsp3a); an X-domain (also designated as ADRP, or Nsp3b); the SUD (Nsp3c); a papain-like proteinase, PL2 pro (also called Nsp3d); and additional domains (Nsp3e-g) that include a transmembrane (TM) region.",

            "text": "At present, it is completely unclear whether and how the individual domains of Nsp3 interact with one another or with other components of the coronaviral replicase complex. Also, some of them possibly recognize proteins of the infected host cell [2] . In the absence of functional data on these domains, attempts have been made to derive their possible biological role from their three-dimensional structures (see [3] for a review). The NMR structure of an N-terminal fragment of the acidic domain (Nsp3a) has revealed a ubiquitin-like fold complemented by two additional short a-helices ( [4] , PDB code 2IDY). NMR chemical-shift analysis suggested that these non-canonical structural elements might bind single-stranded RNA with some specificity for AUAcontaining sequences, although the K D values observed are relatively high (,20 mM). Interestingly, a second ubiquitin-like domain occurs in Nsp3, as part of the papain-like proteinase (PL2 pro , Nsp3d, [5] ; PDB code 2FE8). The PL2 pro cleaves the viral polyprotein after two consecutive glycine residues to release Nsp1, Nsp2, and Nsp3, respectively (The remaining cleavage reactions are performed by the coronaviral main proteinase (M pro ; [6-8]) ). In addition to its proteolytic activities on the N-terminal third of the polyproteins, the SARS-CoV PL2 pro has also been shown to be a deubiquitinating enzyme [9] [10] [11] [12] . Lindner et al. [13] have shown that in addition to its proteolytic and deubiquitinating activity, the SARS-CoV PL2 pro acts as a de-ISGylating enzyme. Induction of ISG15 and its subsequent conjugation to proteins protects cells from the effects of viral infection [14, 15] . Since the ISG15 gene is induced by interferon as part of the antiviral response of the innate immune system, the de-ISGylation activity of Nsp3d could explain the suppression of the interferon response by the papain-like protease, in addition to a possible direct interaction between the PL2 pro and IRF3 [16] .",

In animal cells, such domains are occasionally physically associated with enzymes involved in ADP-ribosylation or ADP-ribose metabolism. Because of this linkage and on the basis of sequence similarity to Poa1p, a yeast protein involved in the removal of the 10-phosphate group from ADP-ribose 10-phosphate (a late step in tRNA splicing; [20] ), it has been proposed that the coronaviral X-domains may have the function of ADP-ribose-10-phosphatases (ADRPs; [21] ). The crystal structures of X-domains of SARS-CoV [22, 23] as well as of HCoV 229E and Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV) [24] show that the protein has the three-layer a/b/a fold characteristic of the macrodomains.",

The roles of many of these in replication (and/or transcription) are unknown. We attempt to derive conclusions concerning the possible functions of these proteins from their three-dimensional structures, which we determine by X-ray crystallography. Non-structural protein 3 contains at least seven different functional modules within its 1922-amino-acid polypeptide chain. One of these is the so-called SARS-unique domain, a stretch of about 338 residues that is completely absent from any other coronavirus. It may thus be responsible for the extraordinarily high pathogenicity of the SARS coronavirus, compared to other viruses of this family. We describe here the three-dimensional structure of the SARS-unique domain and show that it consists of two modules with a known fold, the so-called macrodomain. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these domains bind unusual nucleic-acid structures formed by consecutive guanosine nucleotides, where four strands of nucleic acid are forming a superhelix (so-called G-quadruplexes). SUD may be involved in binding to viral or host-cell RNA bearing this peculiar structure and thereby regulate viral replication or fight the immune response of the infected host cell.",

The N-terminal subdomain (SUD-N) comprises Nsp3 residues 389-517, and the C-terminal subdomain of SUD core contains residues 525-652. We call the latter the ''middle SUD subdomain'', or SUD-M, because full-length SUD has a C-terminal extension of 74 residues compared to SUD core . The SUD-N and SUD-M subdomains have a similar fold and can be superimposed with an r.m.s.d. of 3.3-3.4 \u00c5 (based on Ca positions); they share 11% sequence identity (see Figure 2C for a structural alignment). Of the 14 amino-acid residues identical between the two subdomains, four form a conserved Leu-Glu-Glu-Ala motif at the N-terminus of helix a4. The linker between the two subdomains (residues 518-524) has no visible electron density. This is due to elevated mobility of the linker, rather than proteolytic cleavage, since we showed by SDS-PAGE of dissolved crystals that the SUD core polypeptide (in the presence of b-mercaptoethanol) has the apparent molecular mass to be expected (,29 kDa; not shown). In addition to the linker, SUD-N and SUD-M are connected by a disulfide bond between cysteines 492 and 623 ( Figure 2B ).

Single-stranded nucleotides of random sequence are only bound if they are longer than ,15 nucleotides. Here we demonstrate that each of the two individual SUD subdomains also binds oligo(dG) ( Figure 4A ). With oligo(dH), where H stands for A, C, or T, but not G, only very small gel shifts, if at all, were observed. As oligo(G) stretches are known to form G-quadruplexes, i.e. four-stranded nucleic-acid structures formed by contiguous guanines [32] , we also examined the binding to the oligodeoxynucleotide 59-GGGCGCGGGAG-GAATTGGGCGGG-39, a G-rich sequence present in the bcl-2 promoter region. This oligonucleotide has been shown by NMR spectroscopy to form a G-quadruplex ( [33] ; PDB code 2F8U). We found that both full-length SUD and SUD core do indeed bind this oligodeoxynucleotide and that this process is enhanced by the addition of K + ions, which are known to stabilize G-quadruplex structures ( Figure 4B ). In agreement with the ability of SUD to non-specifically bind to oligonucleotides of .15 bases [31] , both SUD and SUD core were found to bind the reverse-complementary sequence, but with low affinity and, more importantly, independent of K + ions.",

We made major efforts to produce this protein in a stable form, but with little success. Only when we used in-vitro protein synthesis, were we able to obtain small amounts of a relatively stable preparation comprising Nsp3 residues 349-726 [31] . At the N-terminus of this construct, up to eleven residues actually correspond to the C-terminus of the preceding X-domain (Nsp3b). When we expressed a gene construct coding for SUD (349-726) in E. coli, we observed rapid proteolytic degradation of the N-terminal segment. The relatively stable intermediate obtained had its N-terminus at Nsp3 residue 389. The N-terminal segment ,359-388 is predicted to be intrinsically unfolded by several prediction programs (not shown). Therefore, we assume segment 359-388 to be merely a linker between Nsp3b and SUD, and 389 to be the first residue of the latter. This assignment is justified by the observation that in our crystal structures reported here, the SUD-N subdomain is a complete macrodomain without any residues lacking at the N-terminus. Therefore, the protein corresponding to Nsp3 residues 389-726 is called ''full-length SUD'' here.",

SUD core turns out to consist of two subdomains, SUD-N (Nsp3 residues 389-517) and SUD-M (525-652), each exhibiting the fold of a macrodomain. The two subdomains are connected by a flexible linker (residues 518-524) and a disulfide bond. Even though coronavirus replication occurs in the cytosol, where the environment is reductive, it is unlikely that the formation of this disulfide is an artifact owing to handling of the protein: As the linker between the SUD-N and SUD-M subdomains is very short (seven residues), and the mutual orientation of the subdomains is fixed due to the tight dimerization, cysteine residues no. 492 and 623 will be very close to one another irrespective of the exact conformation of the linker. In fact, disulfide bonds are not uncommon in coronaviral nonstructural proteins (Nsps) involved in RNA replication or transcription. Among others, they have been observed in HCoV-229E Nsp9 [25] and turkey coronavirus Nsp15 [26] , but in these cases, the disulfide bond connects two subunits of the homo-oligomeric proteins, whereas the occurrence in SUD core is the first case of an intramolecular disulfide bond described in a coronavirus Nsp.",

            "text": "Our identification of two macrodomains in SUD core brings the number of these domains in SARS-CoV Nsp3 to three. What are the functions of these modules? The original SARS-CoV ''Xdomain'' (Nsp3b) has been shown to have low ADP-ribose-10phosphate phosphatase (Appr-10-pase or ''ADRP'') activity [21] [22] [23] . However, this assignment is controversial. A nuclear Appr-10pase (Poa1p in yeast, [20] ) is an enzyme of a tRNA metabolic pathway, but there is no evidence for coronavirus Nsp3 ever being translocated to the nucleus, and the other enzymes involved in this pathway are missing in coronaviruses (with the exception of the cyclic 10,20-phosphodiesterase (CPDase) in group 2a viruses such as Mouse Hepatitis Virus, Bovine Coronavirus, and Human Coronavirus OC43). Therefore, it has been proposed that the Xdomain may be involved in binding poly(ADP-ribose), a metabolic product of NAD + synthesized by the enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP; [23] ). However, we have recently demonstrated that the X-domain of Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV) strain Beaudette, a group-3 coronavirus, does not have significant affinity to ADP-ribose [24] . This can be explained on the basis of crystal structures: In the X-domain (Nsp3b) of SARS-CoV [23] , and in that of HCoV 229E [24] , a stretch of three conserved glycine residues is involved in binding the pyrophosphate unit of ADP-ribose, whereas in the corresponding domain of IBV strain Beaudette (but not in all IBV strains, see [44] ), the second glycine is replaced by serine, leading to steric interference with ADPribose binding [24] . In the two SUD subdomains, the tripleglycine sequence is not conserved (see Figure 2C ), and hence, they do not bind ADP-ribose either.",

From this, they concluded that the metal-binding activity is associated with the cysteine residues in the N-terminal subdomain. We were also able to observe binding of cobalt ions to SUD core by following the occurrence of a peak at 310 nm in the UV spectrum, which, in contrast to the data presented by Neuman et al. [2] , could be reverted by addition of zinc ions. However, when we removed the N-terminal His-tag, this phenomenon could no longer be observed. Furthermore, we note that of the four cysteine residues in the SUD-N subdomain (residues 393, 456, 492, and 507), 456 and 507 are non-accessible in the interior of the subdomain, and 492 is involved in the buried disulfide bond to Cys623; therefore, Cys393 and perhaps the solvent-exposed His423 would remain the only potential ligands for cobalt ions in SUD-N. However, these residues are .12 \u00c5 apart and thus unlikely to chelate cobalt ions.",

For full-length SUD and SUD core , we had previously shown binding to oligo(dG) and oligo(G) stretches [31] , but the demonstration here of oligo(dG) binding to the individual SUD core subdomains, SUD-N and SUD-M, is unexpected because their overall electrostatic properties are very different from one another: SUD-N is acidic (pI = 5.3), whereas SUD-M is basic (pI = 9.0).

One potential binding site identified is in the cleft between the SUD-M and the SUD-N subdomains within the SUD core dimer ( Figure S2A ); this binding site is spatially close to the mutations M3 and M4, consistent with the observation that these mutations abolish binding completely. However, we have previously shown by Dynamic Light-Scattering that G-quadruplex binding leads to oligomerization of SUD core [31] . Consequently, we have also constructed models based on the packing modes of SUD core dimers observed in our crystal structures. One potential binding site for G-quadruplexes might be in a cleft between two consecutive SUD core dimers as they occur in both the monoclinic and triclinic crystal forms ( Figure  S2B ), but for confirmation, any of these models will have to await crystallographic determination of the complex. In summary, our mutation experiments demonstrate an involvement of several of the many lysine residues of SUD in binding G-quadruplexes, but as it is probably extended surfaces of SUD core oligomers that participate in this process, it is not possible to pinpoint any single amino-acid residue.",

The SARS-CoV genome contains three G 6 -stretches (one on the plus-strand and two on the minusstrand) and an additional two G 5 -sequences, which could perhaps form local G-quadruplexes. However, the G-stretch binding capabilities of SUD and SUD core seem to have been optimized for recognition of longer G-rich sequences. By systematic variation of the length of oligo(dG), we found that SUD core exhibits strongest affinity (K D ,0.45 mM) for (dG) 10 to (dG) 14 [31] . The 39nontranslated regions of several host-cell mRNAs coding for proteins involved in the regulation of apoptosis and in signaling pathways contain long G-stretches and could also be targets of SUD. Examples of such mRNAs are those coding for the proapoptotic protein Bbc3 [45] , RAB6B (a member of the Ras oncogene family, [46] ), MAP kinase 1 [47] , and TAB3, a component of the NF-kB signaling pathway [48] . It is conceivable that these proteins might be targets for the virus when interfering with cellular signaling. Changes in the stability and/or translation efficiency of these mRNAs due to the binding of a viral regulatory factor could result in an altered reaction of the infected cell to apoptotic signals, or it could silence the antiviral response.",

There are 18 human genes for members of the PARP family; the prototype enzyme, PARP-1, catalyzes the post-translational modification of many substrate proteins, including itself, in a multitude of cellular processes (DNA repair, transcriptional regulation, energy metabolism, and apoptosis) [50] [51] [52] .

PARP-4 is incorporated into vaults, RNAcontaining subcellular particles in the cytoplasm [55] . Furthermore, ZAP, a human antiviral protein comprising a C-terminal PARP-like domain devoid of catalytic activity, has been shown to exhibit antiviral activity on alphaviruses [56] , which contain an Xdomain similar to that of coronaviruses [23, 27, 28] . In addition, ZAP contains an N-terminal zinc-finger domain, a central TiPARP (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD)-inducible PARP) domain, and a WWE domain (a protein-protein interaction module in ubiquitin and ADP-ribose conjugation proteins). In fact, ZAP appears to be part of the human innate immune system and to play a role comparable to APOBEC3G in HIV infection [57] . It is possible that this group of viruses has evolved macrodomains to counteract the antiviral activity of ZAP. Indeed, macrodomains can inhibit PARPs, as has been shown for the macrodomain of the histone mH2A1.1, which downregulates the catalytic activity of PARP-1 [58] . Having three macrodomains at its disposal, SARS-CoV may be much more efficient in knocking down the antiviral response of the host cell than other coronaviruses. Whether this involves a direct interaction between SUD and ZAP or another member of the PARP family, or competition for G-quadruplexes in viral or host-cell RNA, remains to be shown.",

Using the program Phaser [64, 65] , we could find two solutions, and the C-terminal part of SUD core was well defined in the electron-density maps. However, for the N-terminal half, only a few segments of poly(Ala) chain could be built into the maps. This starting model was then refined in BUSTER-TNT [66] using Local Structure Similarity Restraints (LSSR) [67] as non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) restraints to give R and R free values of 0.453 and 0.479, respectively. The resulting 2mF o -DF c electron density was subjected to density modification using solvent flattening, histogram matching, and 2-fold NCS-averaging using DM [68] . The averaging masks were calculated and updated using the auto-correlation procedure [69] as implemented in DM. Using the automatic building program BUCCANEER [70] together with REFMAC [71] (as implemented in the CCP4i [72] interface for CCP4) in an iterative procedure for 20 cycles resulted in a model for 501 residues in 10 chains (the longest having 208 residues), in which 448 residues were assigned both a chemical identity and a sequential residue number, while the remaining 53 residues were modeled as poly(Ala) in 8 shorter chains. The R and R free values resulting from REFMAC were 0.374 and 0.414, respectively. This model was refined in BUSTER-TNT, again using LSSR as NCS restraints for the common parts in the already sequenced 448 residues of the dimer, to R and R free values of 0.269 and 0.316. The improved electron density was again subjected to density modification using DM as detailed above, but using a lower solvent content of 35% as well as anisotropically scaled observed amplitudes as output by BUSTER-TNT. The resulting density-modified and NCS-averaged map was then used for automatic model building using the iterative BUCCANEER/REFMAC procedure described above. This produced a model with 511 residues in 5 chains with 487 residues sequenced. The R and R free values from REFMAC for this model were 0.289 and 0.326, respectively.",

ZIGE assays were performed using a horizontal 1% agarose gel system in TBE buffer (20 mM Tris, 50 mM boric acid, 0.1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), pH 8.3). The protein was incubated at room temperature for 30 min with different concentrations of oligodeoxynucleotides, such as (dG) 10 and bcl-2 promoter region (59-GGGCGCGGGAG-GAATTGGGCGGG-39), or oligoribonucleotides (59-UGGGGG-GAGGGAGGGAGGGA-39 and 59-UGGGGU-39). The samples were mixed with dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO; final concentration 10% (v/v)) and a trace of bromophenolblue (BPB). These proteinoligonucleotide samples were applied to the small slots. Oligonucleotide with the same concentration as in the small slots was also mixed with DMSO and BPB in 1xTBE buffer and applied to the long slots of the gel (total volume 100 ml). Electrophoresis was performed at 4uC for 1 h with a constant current of 100 mA. Staining was performed as outlined in [77] .",

SUD core alone (label 0) and decreasing concentrations (1, 0.5, 0.1, 0.05 and 0.02 mM) of NAD + , or decreasing concentrations (1, 0.5, 0.1, 0.05 and 0.02 mM) of ADP-ribose. Found at: doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1000428.s001 (0.70 MB DOC) Figure S2 Alternative models of G-quadruplex binding to SUD core , obtained by automated docking into the crystal structures. The SUD-N and SUD-M subdomains are in violet and cyan, respectively, the G-quadruplex as found in the bcl-2 promoter region (PDB code: 2F8U) is in orange. The pairs of mutations in SUD-N are indicated by green (M1, K505A+K506A) and blue (M2, K476A+K477A) spheres. The M3 set of mutations in SUD-M is indicated by olive (K563A) and orange (K565A+K568A) spheres. The M4 set of mutations, also in SUD-M, is indicated by orange (K565A+K568A) and yellow (E571A) spheres. (A) A possible binding site is in a cleft between monomers in the SUD core dimer. The binding site is close to the lysine residues replaced by the M3 and M4 mutations, compatible with the inability of these mutants to bind G-quadruplexes. (B) A second potential binding site is a cleft between two neighboring SUD core dimers as found in both crystal packing arrangements (space groups P2 1 and P1). This binding mode is compatible with the observation of SUD core oligomerization upon G-quadruplex binding. ",
