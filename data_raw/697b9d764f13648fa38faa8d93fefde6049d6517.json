            "text": "Immune sera from convalescent patients have been shown to be effective in the treatment of patients infected with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Virus (SARS-CoV) making passive immune therapy with human monoclonal antibodies an attractive treatment strategy for SARS. Previously, using Xenomouse (Amgen British Columbia Inc), we produced a panel of neutralizing Human monoclonal antibodies (HmAbs) that could specifically bind to the ectodomain of the SARS-CoV spike (S) glycoprotein. Some of the HmAbs were S1 domain specific, while some were not. In this study, we describe non-S1 binding neutralizing HmAbs that can specifically bind to the conserved S2 domain of the S protein. However, unlike the S1 specific HmAbs, the S2 specific HmAbs can neutralize pseudotyped viruses expressing different S proteins containing receptor binding domain sequences of various clinical isolates. These data indicate that HmAbs which bind to conserved regions of the S protein are more suitable for conferring protection against a wide range of SARS-CoV variants and have implications for generating therapeutic antibodies or subunit vaccines against other enveloped viruses.

Passive antibody therapy has been successfully used to treat patients infected with SARS-CoV [2] [3] [4] , and to confer protection against lethal challenge in experimental animals [5] . Reemergence of SARS in humans remains a credible health threat because of the animal reservoirs [6] [7] [8] [9] . As of now, there is no effective treatment for SARS. However, since virus titer peaks 10 days post-infection [1, 10] , post-exposure treatment that is effective against a broad spectrum of viral variants remains a viable option. Many of the reported HmAbs against SARS-CoV fail to neutralize all of the clinical isolates [11] [12] [13] . Therefore, there is a need for a clinically usable therapy against SARS-CoV infection.",

            "text": "The Spike (S) glycoprotein plays an essential role in receptor binding and membrane fusion critical for the virus entry, and contains epitopes that elicit neutralizing Abs [14] [15] [16] [17] . The SARS-CoV S protein consists of two functional domains, S1 (amino acids 12-680) and S2 (amino acids 681-1255) [18] . The receptor binding domain (RBD) (amino acids 318-510) contained within the S1 domain is required for binding to ACE-2 receptor on the cell surface and is thought to contain the majority of neutralizing epitopes [14, 19, 20] . Co-crystallization of the RBD and human ACE-2 identified the receptor binding motif (RBM) (amino acids 424-494) in direct contact with ACE2 [18] . The S2 domain contains the fusion peptide followed by two conserved heptad repeats (i.e. HR1 and HR2), which upon cleavage by cathepsin-L associate to form a fusion core [15, 18, [21] [22] [23] , and facilitate fusion with the cell membrane required for the virus entry [24] . Synthetic HR2 peptides as well as HR2 specific antibodies have been shown to block SARS-CoV infection [25] [26] [27] . The RBD shows high rates of mutation which allows the virus to escape neutralization by Abs without losing its ability to infect cells [13, 28] . In contrast, the S2 domain is highly conserved among different clinical isolates of the SARS-CoV [29, 30] , and thus raise the possibility that Abs against this region may confer better protection against a broad spectrum of clinical isolates.",

To identify broadly neutralizing HmAbs, we wanted to test our HmAbs against a relatively large panel of variants. We aligned the RBD amino acid sequences available from 94 SARS-CoV late clinical isolates and found mutations in the RBD region of only four clinical isolates relative to the Urbani RBD sequence (Fig. S1B ). The clinical isolates with the identified RBD mutations are named Sin845, GZ-C, GD01 and GZ0402 (GenBank accession number: AY559093.1, AY394979.1, AY278489.2 and AY613947.1 respectively). We inserted the identified mutations within the RBD by site directed mutagenesis into the Urbani 12-510 S1 sequence that is fused to human IgG1 Fc tag at the C-terminus [14] . The Urbani and the mutated 12-510 S1-IgG proteins were expressed in 293FT cells, purified and analyzed by SDS/PAGE (Fig. S2A ) followed by western blot (Fig. S2B ). S1 Proteins Containing RBD Sequences of Sin845, GD01, and GZ0402 Isolates Show Low Binding to S1 Specific Neutralizing HmAbs, While that of GZ-C Isolate Shows Higher Binding Relative binding of HmAbs to different S1 proteins at different concentrations of antibodies was determined. The binding at the highest concentration used (2.5 mg/ml) is shown. Interestingly, the Sin845-S1 protein failed to react with 16/18 HmAbs (OD , 0.2) when compared to the control OD of ,0.156. However, HmAbs 4D4 and 6B1 showed about 50% binding to Sin845 S1 protein relative to their binding to Urbani S1 protein (Fig. 1A) . The GD01-S1 protein showed a diminished binding to 16/18 HmAbs and binding of about 40% and 60% to 4D4 and 3C7 HmAbs respectively (Fig. 1B) . The GZ0402-S1 protein showed minimal binding to 15/18 HmAbs, and 57%, 52% and 69% binding to HmAbs 4D4, 6B1 and 3C7 respectively (Fig. 1C) .

Combining the S1 binding 4D4 HmAb with either 1F8 (HR1) or 5E9 (HR2) resulted in increased virus neutralization of the mutants Sin845, GZ-C and GZ0402 compared to the individual HmAbs. Failure of the 4D4/ 1F8, 4D4/5E9 and 1F8/5E9 combinations to increase GD01 pseudovirus inhibition, when compared to the inhibition seen either with 5E9 or 1F8 alone, was likely due to enhanced binding and neutralization of this virus by these HmAbs when used individually. However, a combination comprising of HmAbs 4D4, 1F8 and 5E9 showed further significant increase in virus neutralization compared to each of the individual HmAbs or any of the pairs. These results suggested that the use of a cocktail consisting of HmAbs that can bind to different conserved regions of the S protein may be more desirable for therapeutic use against SARS-CoV infection. This speculation is supported by earlier studies that have shown that it is far more difficult to select for viral variants in the presence of either a polyclonal neutralizing antibody or a cocktail of monoclonal neutralizing antibodies [36, [38] [39] [40] .",

Presence of similar structures in many other class I viral fusion proteins [42] , point to a common fusion mechanism used by different viruses. Therefore, monoclonal antibodies against such conserved regions might constitute the most effective passive therapy. Our findings are not only relevant to designing a highly effective passive therapy for SARS-CoV but have implications for the development of passive therapy for other viral infections including influenza and HIV [38, 39, 43] .
