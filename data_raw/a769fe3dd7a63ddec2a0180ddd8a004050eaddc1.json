The full-length genome of QdCoV detected in quails with enteritis in Poland has similar organization as Middle Eastern viruses although there is no NSP7c gene. The overall degree of nucleotide sequence identity was 92.4-92.6% between Polish PL/G032/2015 and Middle Eastern UAE-HKU30 QdCoV isolates. The sequences of the individual genes show similar nucleotide identities in the range of 91.4-94.7% with the exception of the S gene with lower identity of 85.6-85.7%. The most variable part of the S gene is its fragment encoding the N-terminal domain of the S protein which is responsible for receptor binding. The amino acid homology in this region between PL/G032/2015 and UAE-HKU30 QdCoVs was 74.5-74.7%. In contrast, the C-terminal domain of the S protein which is responsible for membrane fusion had an amino acid homology of 96.9%. In the phylogenetic tree, PL/G032/2015 branched separately but clustered with the UAE-HKU30 QdCoV isolates. These data suggest that PL/G032/2015 could be a new genetic/serologic variant of QdCoV.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs), enveloped, positive-sense ssRNA viruses, belong to the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae, family Coronaviridae, suborder Cornidovirineae, in the order Nidovirales. Orthocoronavirinae are further divided into four genera Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-, and Deltacoronavirus [9] . Generally, alpha-and betacoronaviruses infect humans and domestic animals while gamma-(gCoVs) and deltacoronaviruses (dCoVs) are associated mainly with avian but also mammalian hosts [12, 19] . The avian representatives of the Gammacoronavirus genus recently assigned to the separate Igacovirus subgenus are infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and genetically similar viruses isolated from other domesticated galliformes [2, 8, 11] . The Deltacoronavirus genus, subdivided into four subgenera, currently comprises seven species, including six bird coronaviruses and one pig coronavirus, but deltacoronaviruses have also been identified in Asian carnivores [6] . The Old World quails (Coturnix coturnix japonica) seem to be susceptible to infection with two genera of avian coronaviruses, gCoV as well as dCoV [4, [16] [17] [18] . Recently, quail deltacoronavirus (QdCoV) has been reported in fecal samples of five quails sampled in the United Arab Emirates [10] . Phylogenetic analysis of their full genomes revealed that QdCoV UAE-HKU30 belongs to the same CoV species as porcine deltacoronavirus (PdCoV) HKU15 and sparrow deltacoronavirus (SpdCoV) HKU17 within Buldecovirus subgenus, suggesting transmission between avian and swine hosts. Moreover, most probably this quail dCoV originated from recombination between PdCoV/SpdCoV and munia deltacoronavirus (MundCoV) HKU13 [10] . This study presents the genetic characterization of deltacoronavirus detected in diseased quails in Poland.",

The farm consisted of one house in which quail-layers and their progenies were housed. The building housed over 15000 layers reared in small sectors/ boxes for 350 birds. Disease symptoms were reported in quails from one sector only. Firstly, short-lived diarrhea appeared in the parents, but subsequently severe symptoms were observed in offspring. Hatched chicks were weak; watery diarrhea started on days 2-4 of life, lasted about 2 weeks, and was accompanied by an elevated mortality of up to 3-10 birds per day. The birds were treated with antibiotics but without any beneficial effects and died at day 10-11 of life. Later on, increased embryo mortality was also noted. After the disinfection of the house, the problem did not reoccur.",

The samples were also checked for coronavirus presence using primers specific for the RdRp gene fragment of all CoVs and for untranslated regions (UTRs) at 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 genome ends of gCoVs [1, 2, 13] . The RT-PCR results revealed that tested samples were positive for coronavirus but negative for gammacoronavirus. Obtained bands were sequenced and blast (blastn) analyzed. The nucleotide sequence of partial RdRp gene of coronavirus detected in diseased birds revealed 93.5% identity with the quail deltacoronavirus UAE-HKU30 1101F strain (LC364346). The detected virus was named QdCoV/PL/ G032/2015 and its complete genome was generated using Illumina MiSeq technology (Illumina Inc, San Diego, USA) offered by Department of Microbiology, National Veterinary Institute (SVA), Uppsala, Sweden. The sequencing reads were trimmed and de novo assembled into contigs, with which blast analysis against a virus database was performed. The reads were also mapped to available reference sequences and then consensus sequence was extracted. The obtained complete genome sequence of the virus was deposited in the GenBank database under the accession number MH532440. The full-length genome consists of 25881 nt and has the following structure 5\u2032UTR-ORF1a/1b-S-E-M-NS6-N-NS7a-NS7b-3\u2032UTR. The lengths of respective regions/genes and their putative products are shown in Table 1 . Similarly to UAE-HKU30 QdCoVs, one ORF (NS7a) overlaps with N but in contrast to them only one additional ORF (NS7b) is present downstream of N, there is a lack of ORF coding nonstructural NSP7c protein.",

Deduction of the cleavage site is rather problematic as the furin could recognize different amino acid patterns; however, the putative cleavage site was deduced between position 691 and 692 just after the probable furin recognition pattern ( 687 RKGGR 691 ) according to the rules described recently [15] . The homology of the region preceding the putative cleavage site (amino acids 1-691) was 74.5-74.7% in contrast to the region behind this site (residues 692-1178) homology of 96.9%.

            "text": "This study is the first description of the full-length genome sequence of QdCoV detected in the intestines of quails with enteric disease in Poland. Phylogenetic analyses showed that the Polish QdCoV/PL/G032/2015 branches separately but in the same genetic cluster as the Middle Eastern QdCoVs. The most variable part of the genome is the S gene, especially its fragment coding N-terminal domain of S protein responsible for receptor binding. The equivalent of this genome fragment (the S1 subunit) of the main representative of gammacoronaviruses, infectious bronchitis virus shows the highest diversity in the whole viral genome and is considered as critically important for the emergence of new virus genotypes, serotypes, and variants [3] . It seems that Polish QdCoV/PL/G032/2015 is another genotype/variant of QdCoV. Interestingly, unlike most of the genes, which have higher identities of amino acid than nucleotide sequences between the Polish and other quail coronavirus genomes, the levels of nt and aa identities of the S gene are similar. This observation might be the evidence for positive selection of aa changes within the S gene. Detection of QdCoV in quails with enteritis suggests that the virus might be responsible for observed disease symptoms but this requires additional in vivo studies. However, to do this, it would be necessary to isolate/propagate the virus on embryonated chicken or quail eggs which so far, despite many attempts, has been unsuccessful.",
