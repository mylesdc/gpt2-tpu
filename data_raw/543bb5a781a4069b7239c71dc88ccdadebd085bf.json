            "text": "SARS-coronavirus (CoV) is a zoonotic agent derived from rhinolophid bats, in which a plethora of SARS-related, conspecific viral lineages exist. Whereas the variability of virulence among reservoir-borne viruses is unknown, it is generally assumed that the emergence of epidemic viruses from animal reservoirs requires human adaptation. To understand the influence of a viral factor in relation to interspecies spillover, we studied the papain-like protease (PLP) of SARS-CoV. This key enzyme drives the early stages of infection as it cleaves the viral polyprotein, deubiquitinates viral and cellular proteins, and antagonizes the interferon (IFN) response. We identified a bat SARS-CoV PLP, which shared 86% amino acid identity with SARS-CoV PLP, and used reverse genetics to insert it into the SARS-CoV genome. The resulting virus replicated like SARS-CoV in Vero cells but was suppressed in IFN competent MA-104 (3.7-fold), Calu-3 (2.6-fold) and human airway epithelial cells (10.3fold). Using ectopically-expressed PLP variants as well as full SARS-CoV infectious clones chimerized for PLP, we found that a protease-independent, anti-IFN function exists in SARS-CoV, but not in a SARS-related, bat-borne virus. This PLP-mediated anti-IFN difference was seen in primate, human as well as bat cells, thus independent of the host context. The results of this study revealed that coronavirus PLP confers a variable virulence trait among members of the species SARS-CoV, and that a SARS-CoV lineage with virulent PLPs may have pre-existed in the reservoir before onset of the epidemic.",

CoVs are large, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses that cause acute and prolonged infections in a variety of mammals and birds. Pathogenic human CoVs include members of the genus Alphacoronavirus, termed human coronavirus (HCoV)-NL63 and HCoV-229E, as well as members of the genus Betacoronavirus, termed HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1. These endemic viruses cause upper and lower respiratory tract infections in humans worldwide. Past zoonotic descent can be inferred for HCoV-OC43 and -229E, respectively [1] [2] [3] [4] . Actual zoonotic acquisition is known for two betacoronaviruses that both cause severe lung disease in humans. The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a zoonotic agent that is frequently and repeatedly acquired by humans upon contact with dromedary camels in the Arabian Peninsula and parts of Africa [5, 6] . This virus seems to cause only limited human-to-human transmission, but is considered a major threat to global public health due to recurring nosocomial outbreaks that may facilitate onward adaptation to humans [7] [8] [9] . The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV caused an epidemic with sustained human-to-human transmission during 2002 to 2003 in China and other countries, involving more than 8,000 notified infections with a case fatality proportion of about 10% [10, 11] .",

Additional mutagenesis studies in replicating virus context associate the functional difference to a more efficient binding of ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like modifiers. Against the general assumption that reservoir-associated viruses are highly adapted to their hosts, we find the PLP of the human epidemic virus to counteract IFN better than the bat-derived PLP even in bat cells.

During establishment of the assay we noticed a considerable level of mRNA splicing while expressing SR-PLP under the control of a chicken \u03b2-actin promoter (S1 Fig). Codonoptimized constructs were therefore generated. The truncated nsp3-GFP product was detectable by Western blot using anti-GFP epitope tag antibodies with all PLPs (Fig 2A; lanes 2, 4 and 6). To confirm that the protease activity of SR-PLP and SO-PLP depended on the same typical catalytic domain as in SA-PLP, the catalytic cysteines of each PLP (C1651) were changed to alanines. For SA-PLP this mutation was previously shown to abolish PLP activity [46] . The mutants are henceforth referred to as CA-mutants. As expected, each PLP CAmutant was unable to process the SARS nsp2/3-GFP substrate (Fig 2A; lanes 3, 5 and 7). To confirm PLP expression in all cases, Western blots were done on the same cell lysates using antibodies directed against the FLAG epitope tag fused to PLPs. It was found that the expression levels of all PLPs were equal (Fig 2A, lower panel) .",

As already suggested by protease cleavage assays, SR-PLP-rSCV was slightly less sensitive against protease inhibitor 3e than SA-PLP-rSCV (rSCV: IC 50 = 2.36 \u03bcM; SR-PLP-rSCV: IC 50 = 11.02 \u03bcM), providing additional evidence for functional and structural integrity of SR-PLP in the context of SARS-CoV replication (Fig 3D) .

Because PLP IFN antagonism functions have been linked to IRF-3 function, a sensitive assay for IRF-3 nuclear translocation was established. Nuclear translocation of an overexpressed IRF-3/GFP fusion protein was stimulated by superinfection with Rift Valley fever virus clone 13 (RVFV Cl 13), an RVFV-mutant devoid of the IFN induction antagonist NSs. RVFV Cl 13 is known to trigger a strong IFN response [52, 53] . The proportion of cells with nuclear translocation of GFP signal was counted microscopically. As summarized in Fig 5A and 5B , ectopic expression of SA-and SR-PLP blocked the nuclear translocation of IRF-3 to comparable levels (SA-PLP: 18% and SR-PLP: 20% of cellular IRF-3/GFP fusion proteins located in the nucleus). The SO-PLP of the outlying virus blocked the nuclear translocation of IRF-3 even more efficiently (3% of cellular IRF-3/GFP fusion proteins located in the nucleus). For all PLPs, CA-mutants were included in the experiment to determine whether anti-IFN effects depended on protease function. The inhibitory capacity of the SA-and SO-PLP CA-mutants were strongly reduced, but still detectable at significant levels (SA-PLP: 71% and SO-PLP: 45% of cells with IRF-3/GFP fusion protein located in the nucleus). In Supernatants were taken at 24 hpi, and viral replication was determined by a plaque titration assay. The experiment was performed in triplicate and repeated twice. Error bars indicate the standard deviations of the means. One representative experiment is shown. (d) Virus growth was compared in IFN-competent human cells (Calu-3) as described above. The experiment was performed in triplicate. (e) To determine IFN-\u03b2 expression, Calu-3 cells were infected with rSCV, SR-PLP-rSCV or IFN-inducing RVFV Cl 13 (control of IFN-\u03b2 expression) at an MOI of 1. Total mRNA was extracted from cell lysates at 24 hpi. IFN-\u03b2 expression was determined using quantitative real-time PCR analysis. The mean fold change in IFN-\u03b2 expression was calculated using TATA-binding protein (TBP) expression as a reference gene and the 2 \u2212\u0394\u0394Ct analysis method [55] . The experiment was done in quadruplicates. Statistical significance between the indicated groups was determined using a two-sided t test. (f) Human airway epithelial cells (HAE) were infected with rSCV and SR-PLP-rSCV with an absolute infectious dose of 40,000 PFU. At 0, 48, 72 and 96 hpi samples were taken and viral replication was determined by a plaque titration assay. The experiment was done in duplicate and repeated three times independently. Statistical significance in (d-f) was determined using a two-sided t test.",

The likely mechanism for this additional activity has been identified by in-vitro studies to involve binding of ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like modifiers [34, 54, 58] . Here we confirmed the functional link between DUB functions and IFN antagonism for the first time in a replicating CoV. Because the cytopathogenic nature of SARS-CoV infection prevented sensitive cell-based assays for DUB-and deIS-Gylating functions, we relied on knowledge of structure-function relationships from a study on equine arteritis virus (EAV), an arterivirus related to CoVs [35] . In EAV PLP2, a ubiquitinbinding surface distinct from the protease active site was identified and mutagenized without causing a loss of protease processing. A definite link to IFN antagonism was established by engineering of a destabilizing mutation into the ubiquitin-binding surface in an EAV infectious clone, causing increased induction of IFN during replication. By introduction of a homologous mutation in our SARS-CoV infectious clone, we found an even clearer loss of IFN antagonism than with EAV. The choice of the mutation was informed by another study that defined the primary ubiquitin-binding surface in SARS-CoV PLP and found position M209 to critically interact with a conformational binding patch (I44, V70, L8) on ubiquitin but to not affect protease activity [54] . Concordantly, we found no signs of catalytic inactivation of the M209 mutant in Vero cells where it replicates like wild type virus, and a pattern of fully protease-dependent IFN antagonism like that of the reservoir-derived PLP. We conclude that ubiquitin binding constitutes an anti-IFN function of SARS-CoV PLP that is independent of the conserved protease function, is phenotypically relevant for replication level and immune evasion, and is variable among viral variants.",

In that study, a D130A mutation in the nsp16 2'-O-methyltransferase domain replicated like wild type in Vero cells but caused about 10-fold lower replication in an IFN-competent human airway epithelial cell line. When engineered in a mouse-adapted backbone, the mutant was cleared faster from the lungs of infected mice, and caused significantly less weight loss. The present study did not use in vivo models to evaluate the consequences of the introduced mutations on replication. Mouse experiments may not reflect the role of PLP in host switching because ISG15 (expectably the most important ubiquitin-like modifier processed by SARS-CoV PLP [38] ) is not conserved between humans, bats, and mice [60] . However, we can derive from the existence of SR-PLP in bats that the ubiquitin-related function of PLP is not essential for SARS-CoV replication in the natural host, and functional variants reflect natural diversity.",

Crystallization of PLP in complex with K48-linked di-ubiquitin identified the structure of the second binding site (Ub2), which seems to be more critical for K48-linked di-ubiquitinbinding than the primary binding surface [38] . The primary ubiquitin-binding surface (Ub1) is more critical for ISG15 binding [38, 60] . The SARS-CoV strains found in reservoirs in China and Europe show several variants at both ubiquitin-binding sites that could be studied for effects on replication level or other virulence traits (Fig 8A) .",

The fact that, apart from our observed functional differences, there may also be structural changes between two closely related PLPs of a single virus species (the species \"SARS-related CoV\") is particularly intriguing as such differences were previously only seen among CoVs that belong to different virus genera. The PLP of HCoV-NL63, for example, has similar protease-independent anti-IFN functions as the PLP of SARS-CoV whereas MERS-CoV PLP anti-IFN activity clearly depends on protease function [34, 37] . The existence of functional diversity in the reservoir makes sense in light of viral evolution and emergence. For instance, the capacity to modulate processing and substrate binding in separate domains of PLP opens the possibility for reservoir-associated CoVs to adjust fitness or virulence levels based on changes in host population structure. Increased virulence may confer increased transmission rates, but may come at the cost of host population decline. Based on our data it seems that the reservoir contains a considerable degree of functional variability that is based on highly conserved host functions such as the ubiquitin systems. Virus adaptation to the human host may not only be an evolved property at the beginning of virus emergence. Rather, the reservoir may contain pre-formed virulence traits that can be predicted by experiments informed by detailed knowledge of molecular virus functions, enabling new approaches to forecast emergence potential.",

All fecal samples were collected non-invasively by trained field biologists and stored at -80\u02daC until analysis. In detail, bats were caught with mist nets, which were checked at intervals of 5 min. Captured bats were freed from nets immediately and put into cotton bags for several minutes. While being kept in bags, bats produced fecal pellets that were collected and transferred into RNAlater RNA stabilization solution (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). Procedures were previously described in [62] , and were consistent with guidelines of the American society of mammalogists [63] for the use of wild mammals in research and national guidelines for the capture, handling, and care of bats. For all capturing, sampling and sample export, permission was obtained from the Wildlife Division of the Ministry of Lands, Forestry, and Mines in Ghana (permit no. CHRPE49/09; A04957) as described previously in [45] . Primary human airway epithelial cells were procured from patients who underwent surgical lung resection for any pulmonary disease and who gave informed consent.

The proposed localization of Ub1 and Ub2 is depicted in the cartoon below the alignment. SA-and SR-PLP, which were investigated in the presented study, are highlighted in red. Homology modelling for SR-PLP was done to compare the interaction surfaces between SA-and SR-PLP, respectively, and the two ubiquitin molecules of a K48-linked di-ubiquitin. Molecular graphics and analyzes were performed with the UCSF Chimera package [71] with the crystal structure of SARS-CoV PLP in complex with a K48-linked di-ubiquitin (PDB entry 5e6j) as template and the amino acid sequence of SR-PLP as a target. Putative amino acid contact points between SA-and SR-PLP and Ub1 (b) and Ub2 (c) highlight the conformational variability of both PLPs in ubiquitin-binding.

(a) A chimeric rSCV containingSR-PLP (SR-PLP-rSCV) was generated by reverse genetics to investigate SR-PLP functions in the context of a replicating virus. SR-PLP (purple) was inserted at the genomic position of SA-PLP (blue). The plaque morphology was analyzed in Vero E6 cells. Therefore, cells were infected with (b) rSCV and (c) SR-PLP-rSCV (MOI 0.01) and overlaid with a highly viscous medium. At 3 dpi, cells were fixed and stained with crystal violet. (d) To investigate structural integrity of the SR-PLP domain in the molecular context of the SARS-CoV nonstructural protein 3, cells were infected with either rSCV or SR-PLP-rSCV (MOI 0.0001) and treated with the SA-PLP protease inhibitor 3e (24-well format). After 1 h, cells were washed twice with PBS and either DMSO (0 \u03bcM) or in DMEM serially diluted compound 3e (3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25 and 50 \u03bcM) was added.
