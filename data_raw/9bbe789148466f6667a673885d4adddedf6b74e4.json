It is also named \"heat stress in transport\", causing morbidity and mass death. New variants of BPIV3 have been detected or isolated in China since 2008. Here, we isolate one BPIV3 strain (named BPIV3 BJ) in Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells from nasal samples collected in China. Phylogenetic analysis showed that our isolate is related to BPIV3 of the genotype A. The comparison of BPIV3-BJ and the reference Chinese isolate NM09 showed that these strains are highly divergent. We found many differences in the amino acid composition in the nucleocapsid (NP) protein among these genotype A strains. Since the NP protein has been implicated in immunization studies, our BPIV3 isolate will be useful for the development of immune assays and vaccine studies. The diversity of BPIV3 lineages that we found in China indicated ongoing evolution for immune escape. Our study highlights the importance of genetic surveillance for determining the effect of BPIV3 variability on pathogen evolution and population-scale immunity.",

The disease is commonly referred to as \"Shipping fever\" and causes an increase in morbidity mortality rates [1] . The multiple factors that cause BRDC include stress, infectious agents, immunity, and housing conditions. The infectious agents associated with BRDC include viruses, bacteria, and mycoplasmas [2, 3] . While most acute infections with uncomplicated infectious agents are sub-clinical, they can cause respiratory disease characterized by a cough, fever, and nasal discharge [4] . Mixed infections with two or more infectious agents are thought to contribute to BRDC [5] . The primary viral infectious pathogens that cause BRDC are bovine parainfluenza virus 3 (BPIV3), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), bovine alphaherpesvirus 1 (BHV-1), bovine coronavirus (BCV), and so forth [6, 7] .",

The phylogenetic comparison of our isolated strain with strains previously characterized in China indicated the presence of divergent strains of genotype A circulating in the country. The diversity of BPIV3 in China seems to mirror the diversity of this virus, which is observed in the USA [8, 11, 15] . In addition, the full characterization of our BPIV3 genotype A strain will lend support to molecular diagnoses and to future studies aimed at developing an efficient vaccine against multiple viral lineages.",

The samples were filtrated through a 0.22 \u03bcm filter and inoculated to monolayer culture MDBK cells. The cells were cultivated three times with five-day intervals. Cell cultures (third passage) were frozen and thawed three times before inoculating MDBK cells. MDBK cells inoculated with the virus produced typical cytopathic effects characterized by rounding, shrinkage, and cracking off ( Figure 2 ). The successfully isolated BPIV3 stain was named BPIV3-BJ. The median of viral tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) of the third passage was determined in MDBK cells. The titer of BPIV3-BJ was up to 10-9.5/0.1 mL. The high titer of BPIV3-BJ on MDBK indicated that the virus has a good growth performance in MDBK cells. The whole genome of BPIV3-BJ was assembled using SeqMan. The genomic annotation was performed according to the blastx search. The complete genomic length of BPIV3-BJ was 15,480 bp with 36.1% GC content. The percentage of nucleotide sequence similarities was assessed with these BPIV3 strains for which complete genomic sequences were available in GenBank. BPIV3-BJ showed a low nucleotide similarity to BPIV3 strains located in genotype B (83%-83.6%) and genotype C (81.7%-82.1%). It shared a higher nucleotide identity with isolates located in genotype A. In total, 99% of nucleotide identity was observed between BPIV3-BJ and 910N (Genbank number: D84095). The virus isolated in this study showed a lower nucleotide identity with Chinese BPIV3 strains.",

Since the NP protein has been implicated in immunization studies, it is important to determine the extent of differences between BPIV3-BJ and other strains. The comparison of BPIV3-BJ and the Chinese isolate NM09 showed that these strains are highly divergent. Although there are few BPIV3 complete genomes available, the genetic divergence of strains of genotype A suggests that this genotype is continuously disseminated in distinct countries. Our study showed that the diversity of genotype A strains in China was likely affected by incoming strains from the USA. Because China imports large amounts of beef resources from the USA and the European Union, it is quite reasonable that this trade has impacted the spread of BPIV3 of genotype A to the region. Furthermore, there are also some levels of imported or smuggled live cattle from abroad and this will certainly have had a direct impact on the maintenance of distinct BPIV3 strains in China. To better address the dynamics of BPIV3 in China, and the pathways and impact of animal trade, a very extensive survey on local herds and shipments coming from other countries should be conducted.

In summary, we have described the isolation and genomic sequencing of BPIV3 genotype A strains isolated from cattle in China. Our isolate is highly divergent from the previously described isolate from China, NM09. The BPIV3 genotype A infection has been infecting livestock animals in China and causing enormous economic loss to the cattle industry. For this reason, the isolation and genomic characterization of our divergent BPIV3 genotype A strain will help the development of molecular diagnostic tools and vaccine studies.",
