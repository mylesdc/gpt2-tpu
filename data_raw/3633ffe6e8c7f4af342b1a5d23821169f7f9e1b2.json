Care was taken to avoid bacterial DNA contamination by utilizing DNA-free reagents when applicable, filter sterilizing all solutions through a 0.2 \u00b5M filter, and working in a PCR-clean hood. Before DNA extraction, faeces samples were weighted and the volume of urine samples was measured. To control for the introduction of contaminating DNA, negative extraction controls (reagents only) were included in the extraction procedure. The protocol includes the addition of the peptidoglycan-degrading enzymes mutanolysin and lysozyme and the use of the QIAmp DNA Micro kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), as previously described [3] . We used a 3 hours incubation time at 56\u00b0C, the addition of carrier RNA, and faeces samples were centrifuged (2 min. at 604g) and the supernatant collected before the transfer to the Qiagen column. DNA was eluted into 32 \u00b5l of buffer AE and stored at -20\u00b0C.",

Samples from M. natalensis and R. aegyptiacus were processed separately, with the production of two distinct libraries. Additional negative and positive PCR controls, in the form of an ultrapure water sample and a mock community respectively, were provided by Genoscreen and included in the preparation of each library. The indexed DNA libraries were equimolar pooled and diluted at a final concentration of 4 nM.

Assembled reads were quality trimmed based on their length prior to alignment against the MOTHUR-formatted SILVA database. Preclustering of the data was performed using a 4-bp difference, following by the detection and removal of chimeras using the UCHIME algorithm [6] . We then classified sequences using the MOTHUR-formatted version of the RDP training set (v.9), and any unknown, chloroplast, mitochondrial, archaeal, or eukaryotic sequences were removed.

All PCRs were ran with a negative (PCR mix only) and positive controls (i.e. DNA from a Human herpesvirus 1 cell culture, DNA from an adenovirus-positive bat (Neoromicia spp.) sample, DNA from a Leptospira interrogans culture).

Careful manual checking of chromatograms did show double peaks for herpesviruses found in R. aegyptiacus, thus we retained only the mono-infected samples for the phylogenetic analyses.
