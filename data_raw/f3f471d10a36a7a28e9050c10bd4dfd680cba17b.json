The complexity of the latter simulations, however, is not necessary for a reliable description of infection dynamics in large populations [7] . A minimum requirement for a pandemic influenza planning tool is a dynamic modelling structure which allows investigation of time-dependent variables like incidence, height of the epidemic peak, antiviral availability etc. The tool should, on the other hand, be adjustable to local conditions to adequately support the pandemic preparedness plans of different countries which involve considerably different assumptions (Table 1) .",

Values for the R0 associated with an influenza strain with pandemic potential are suggested to lie between 2 and 3 [10] . This value is higher than the effective reproduction number which has been estimated to be slightly lower than 2 [11, 12] .

A fraction of cases remains asymptomatic; others become moderately sick or clinically ill (i.e. they need medical help). Depending on the combination of age and risk group, a fraction of the clinically ill cases needs to be hospitalized, and an agedependent fraction of hospitalized cases may die from the disease ( Table 5 ). This partitioning of the cases into four categories allows combining the realistic description of the transmission dynamics with an easy calculation of the resources consumed during an outbreak. The degree and duration of contagiousness of a patient depend on the course of the disease; the latter furthermore depends on the age of the patient (Table 5) . Passing through the incubation and contagious period is modelled in several stages which allows for realistic distributions of the sojourn times ( Table 4 ). The last two stages of the incubation period are used as early infectious period during which the patient can already spread the disease. Infectiousness is highest after onset of symptoms and thereafter declines geometrically (Table 6 ). Clinically ill patients seek medical help on average one day after onset of symptoms. Very sick patients are advised to withdraw to their home until their disease is over, whereas extremely sick patients need to be hospitalized and may die from the disease (Table 4) . After the end of their contagious period, clinically ill patients go through a convalescent period before they can resume their ordinary life and go back to work (Table 4) .",

Figure 1 shows the graphical user interface of the software which is divided into input and output windows. The user may set new values in the input fields or move sliders to almost simultaneously obtain new results for the course of an epidemic in a given population. Figures 2A and 2B show pandemic waves which result from varying the basic reproduction number from 1.5 to 4.0. Using the standard parameter values as given in Tables 2, 3 , 4, 5, 6 and omitting all interventions in a town of 100,000 inhabitants results in a pandemic wave which lasts for about ten weeks (Figure 2A , with R 0 = 2.5). The peak of the pandemic wave is reached after six to seven weeks, with a daily incidence of up to 2,340 influenza patients seeking medical help, with up to 280 hospital beds occupied by influenza cases and with up to 14,000 out of 60,000 working adults unable to go to work because of illness or convalescence. These results depend on the assumptions concerning the yet unknown contagiousness and pathogenicity of the virus. Figures 2C and 2D show how the shape of the curves depends on the course of contagiousness: the pandemic wave proceeds relative slowly if the contagiousness does not change during the infectious period (x 50 = 50%), but proceeds quickly if the contagiousness is highest after onset of symptoms and decreases thereafter (x 50 > 50%).",

Extremely sick patients, whose hospitalization is prevented by treatment, are sent home and join the group of treated very sick patients(W a, T ). The remaining duration of disease and contagiousness of treated cases is reduced by f D percent so that their rate of progressing from one stage to the next has To obtain a realistic distribution of this sojourn time, convalescence is modelled in j stages so that progression from one stage to the next occurs at rate \u03c1 = j/D C .

The duration of the fully contagious stage depends on the course of the disease and on the age of the case. Sojourn times are D A, a and D M, a for asymptomatic and moderately sick cases, respectively, and D V, a for both groups of severe cases. To obtain realistic distributions of these sojourn times, the contagious classes are modelled in m stages each so that progression from one stage to the next occurs at rate \u03b3 A, a = m/D A, a , \u03b3 M, a = m/D M, a and \u03b3 V, a, U = m/D V, a , respectively. Severe cases seek medical help on average D D days after onset. Assuming that the waiting time until visiting a doctor is exponentially distributed, we use a constant rate \u03b1 = 1/D D for doctoral visits. Very sick patients (V a ) who visit a doctor are advised to withdraw to their home (W a ) until the disease is over whereas extremely sick cases (X a ) are immediately hospitalized (H a",
