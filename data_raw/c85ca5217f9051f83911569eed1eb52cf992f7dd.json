In most cases, (\u2212)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) has been shown to play a central role in these effects by green tea. Catechins from other plant sources have also shown health benefits. Many studies have revealed that the binding of EGCG and other catechins to proteins is involved in its action mechanism. Computational docking analysis (CMDA) and X-ray crystallographic analysis (XCA) have provided detailed information on catechin-protein interactions. Several of these studies have revealed that the galloyl moiety anchors it to the cleft of proteins through interactions with its hydroxyl groups, explaining the higher activity of galloylated catechins such as EGCG and epicatechin gallate than non-galloylated catechins. In this paper, we review the results of CMDA and XCA of EGCG and other plant catechins to understand catechin-protein interactions with the expectation of developing new drugs with health-promoting properties.",

            "text": "Green tea and green tea catechins (GTCs) have been revealed to have beneficial effects on a variety of diseases such as cancer, metabolic syndrome (MetS), infectious diseases, and neurodegenerative diseases [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . In most cases, (\u2212)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is believed to play a central role in the biological actions of green tea. Plant catechins from other sources also show health benefits [8] . EGCG and other catechins contribute to these effects mainly through their antioxidative and prooxidative properties [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] (Figure 1 ). In addition, many studies have revealed that the binding of EGCG and other catechins to proteins is involved in its action mechanism [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . Among studies on catechin-protein interactions, Arora et al. (1989) appears to be the first to provide detailed information on the interaction of serum albumin (SA) with catechins, determined by physico-chemical methods [9] . There are several methods to demonstrate catechin-protein binding interaction, including equilibrium dialysis, interaction, including equilibrium dialysis, pH-metric and spectrophotometric methods, affinity chromatography, surface plasmon resonance, nuclear magnetic resonance, X-ray crystallographic analysis (XCA), and computational molecular docking analysis (CMDA) [5] . CMDA has been used to reveal further intricacies of the interaction between SA and catechins [5] . For example, data obtained by experiments that included CMDA indicated that EGCG binds to residues located in subdomains IIa and IIIa of human SA and that specific interactions occur with residues Trp214, Arg218, Gln221, Asn295, and Asp451 [10] . EGCG was shown to bind to IIa and IIIa domains of bovine SA, inducing a binding-dependent conformational change in the protein [11] . More recently, Ikeda et al. demonstrated that a gallate ester moiety at the C-3 position enhanced the binding ability of catechins to bovine SA by interacting with both Trp134 and Trp213 via \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking ( Figure 2) . EGCG was also shown to interact with Glu130, Glu165, and Glu284, located on the surface of BSA, through hydrogen bonds [12] . Treatment of human hepatoma HepG2 cells with EGCG induced non-apoptotic cell death when serum proteins such as in fetal bovine SA and bovine SA were absent, and the toxicity of EGCG caused by its binding to various cellular proteins such as caspase-3, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, and \u03b1-tubulin, was reduced by the addition of SA [13] . CMDA indicated that bovine SA had a stronger affinity to EGCG than other proteins and that SA may act as a protein carrier. Binding information may be useful for developing a drug delivery system.",

For example, data obtained by experiments that included CMDA indicated that EGCG binds to residues located in subdomains IIa and IIIa of human SA and that specific interactions occur with residues Trp214, Arg218, Gln221, Asn295, and Asp451 [10] . EGCG was shown to bind to IIa and IIIa domains of bovine SA, inducing a binding-dependent conformational change in the protein [11] . More recently, Ikeda et al. demonstrated that a gallate ester moiety at the C-3 position enhanced the binding ability of catechins to bovine SA by interacting with both Trp134 and Trp213 via \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking ( Figure 2) . EGCG was also shown to interact with Glu130, Glu165, and Glu284, located on the surface of BSA, through hydrogen bonds [12] . Treatment of human hepatoma HepG2 cells with EGCG induced non-apoptotic cell death when serum proteins such as in fetal bovine SA and bovine SA were absent, and the toxicity of EGCG caused by its binding to various cellular proteins such as caspase-3, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, and \u03b1-tubulin, was reduced by the addition of SA [13] . CMDA indicated that bovine SA had a stronger affinity to EGCG than other proteins and that SA may act as a protein carrier. Binding information may be useful for developing a drug delivery system. Shi et al. applied small-angle X-ray scattering to study the complex structure of bovine SA bound by catechin or EGCG [14] .

For example, Bu et al. reported that the synthetic MMP inhibitor Batimastat exhibited inhibitory effects on tumor growth, tissue invasion, and intrahepatic and lung metastasis [15] . In the nude mice model of liver cancer, Batimastat prolonged survival of the animals [15] . EGCG and ECG have been shown to inhibit the enzymatic activity of MMPs, and GTCs and green tea have a proven record of inhibiting cancer metastasis in several animal experiments [16] [17] [18] . As discussed previously [5] , CMDA demonstrated a binding interaction between GTCs and MMPs including MMP-2, MMP-9, and MMP-14, and the gallate group is important for establishing a strong interaction between MMP-2 and EGCG or ECG [19, 20] . MMP-9 activity was inhibited by EGCG and ECG, but not by EC and EGC [20, 21] . Their results showed interactions between EGCG and several amino acid residues in MMP-9 (Leu187, Leu188, Ala191, Glu402 (active site residue), His405, and Pro421) with an interaction energy exceeding 2 kcal/mol resulting from chemical bonds such as hydrogen bonds, \u03c0-\u03c0, \u03c0-cation, and \u03c0-\u03c3 interactions. These residues were also shown to be involved in the interaction with EC, EGC, and ECG. A galloyl moiety in EGCG interacts with amino acid residues such as Phe201, His401, Glu402, His 411, and Pro421. Due to the presence of a galloyl residue, EGCG and ECG had about 1.5fold higher binding affinity with MMP-9 than EC and EGC, indicating its important role in the inhibitory action against MMP-9 activity [20] .",

For example, Bu et al. reported that the synthetic MMP inhibitor Batimastat exhibited inhibitory effects on tumor growth, tissue invasion, and intrahepatic and lung metastasis [15] . In the nude mice model of liver cancer, Batimastat prolonged survival of the animals [15] . EGCG and ECG have been shown to inhibit the enzymatic activity of MMPs, and GTCs and green tea have a proven record of inhibiting cancer metastasis in several animal experiments [16] [17] [18] . As discussed previously [5] , CMDA demonstrated a binding interaction between GTCs and MMPs including MMP-2, MMP-9, and MMP-14, and the gallate group is important for establishing a strong interaction between MMP-2 and EGCG or ECG [19, 20] . MMP-9 activity was inhibited by EGCG and ECG, but not by EC and EGC [20, 21] . Their results showed interactions between EGCG and several amino acid residues in MMP-9 (Leu187, Leu188, Ala191, Glu402 (active site residue), His405, and Pro421) with an interaction energy exceeding 2 kcal/mol resulting from chemical bonds such as hydrogen bonds, \u03c0-\u03c0, \u03c0-cation, and \u03c0-\u03c3 interactions. These residues were also shown to be involved in the interaction with EC, EGC, and ECG. A galloyl moiety in EGCG interacts with amino acid residues such as Phe201, His401, Glu402, His 411, and Pro421. Due to the presence of a galloyl residue, EGCG and ECG had about 1.5-fold Molecules 2018, 23, 2020 4 of 28 higher binding affinity with MMP-9 than EC and EGC, indicating its important role in the inhibitory action against MMP-9 activity [20] .",

Main contributors to hydrogen bond binding to EGCG were shown to be Asp189, Ser190, Ser195, Gly216, and Gly219, while those in the binding to catechin are Asp189, Ser190, Gly216, and Gly219. EGCG exhibited much stronger inhibitory activity than catechin. The data are consistent with those of Cui et al. who showed that in trypsin-catechin complexes residues Asp189, Ser190, Gln192, Ser195 and Val213-Ser214-Trp215 in common contribute to conserved hydrogen bond interactions or hydrophobic contacts [23] . Thus, catechin's occupancy of the catalytic pocket of trypsin would hinder the substrate binding, leading to inhibition of the protein-degrading activity and the finding provides explanation of higher efficiency of galloylated catechins than non-galloylated catechins. binding of EGCG to the trypsin's catalytic cavity involves hydrogen bonding provided by the hydroxyl groups in the galloyl residue, whereas that of catechin uses those in the B-ring [14] ( Figure  3 ).

CMDA also suggested that a particular pose of EGCG may lead to covalent modification of the N-terminal threonine (Thr1) of the proteasome \u03b25 subunit in the chymotrypsin-like active site [24] . Methylation of EGCG may reduce the biological activity of EGCG such as proteasomal chymotrypsin-like inhibitory activity. Methylation can disrupt the ability of ECG and EGCG to interact with Thr1 of this subunit. CMDA showed that methylation causes the ester carbon in these catechins to move away or be blocked entirely from Thr1, impairing the ability of these catechins to dock well.

Chromenylchalcone 11 showed a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 93.1 nM which is comparable with those of catechin gallate and ECG.

Efferth et al. used the known STAT3 inhibitor BP-1-102 as a reference compound to study several potential anti-STAT3 compounds by methods including CMDA. Among 22 compounds assessed, six compounds including EGCG had a binding energy lower than that of BP-1-102 (around \u22127 kcal/mol), suggesting that they are more potent STAT3 inhibitors. The pKi values were 3.81 \u00b1 1.94, 0.20 \u00b1 0.06, 0.31 \u00b1 0.07, 0.65 \u00b1 0.27 for BP-1-102, gingektin, withaferin A, and EGCG, respectively, supporting that these three representative compounds are better inhibitor than BP-1-102. Amino acid residues involved in the binding interaction are: Lys609, Asn647, Met648, Ser649, Arg688 in BP-1-102; Asn647, Glu652, His694, Lys707, Thr708, Lys709, Phe710 in gingektin; Asn646, Asn647, Met648, Glu652, Arg688, Lys709 in withaferin A; and Glu652, Arg688, Glu693, Lys707, Thr708, Lys709 in EGCG ( Figure 6 ). Thus, the amino acids participating in the EGCG-protein binding are also involved in the binding of at least one of the other three compounds, with the exception of Glu693. These amino acids involved in binding of the compounds to STAT3 are located in the Src homology 2 domain of the protein ( Figure 6 ).

Cyanidin also increased SIRT6 expression in human colorectal cancer Caco-2 cells. Binding of activators can change the conformation of a polypeptide loop near the acetylated peptide substrate binding site, leading to the activation of SIRT6.

The EGCG-induced protein complexes are unstructured and EGCG reacts selectively with amyloidogenic mutants. Their proposed mechanism consists of three steps: (i) native monomers are converted via partially unfolded intermediates into amyloid fibrils, (ii) EGCG binds either to Pro59 (P59) with low affinity and no precipitation, or to Pro44 with higher affinity, and (iii) more EGCG molecules are recruited to the Pro44 (P44) binding site, which in turn results in the association of further proteins, leading to eventual precipitation (Figure 7) .

EGCG was reported to inhibit MMP-9 [20, 21] and docked well with MMP-9. Thus, EGCG may inhibit MMP-9 in the brain and slow the degradation of NGF, thereby preventing DS [72] . Down syndrome (DS) is a genetic disorder caused by the presence of all or part of a third copy of chromosome 21. The disease is associated with a decrease in the amount of mature nerve growth factor (NGF) by: (i) down-regulation of tissue plasminogen activator that activates plasminogen to plasmin, an enzyme that converts proNGF to mature NGF and (ii) overexpression of MMP-9, which degrades NGF.

Quercetin formed the most energetically stable interactions, apigenin lacked the hydroxyl groups necessary for important contacts and the non-planar structure of catechin could not support predicted hydrogen bonding patterns.

For example, in a case-control study, drinking green tea had a significant negative association with tuberculosis with an odds ratio of 0.534 [81] . Catechins have antibacterial activity and can modify the properties of multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Taylor comprehensively discussed the binding avidity of catechins, among which ECG showed the strongest binding to MRSA [82] . Incubation of MRSA with ECG inhibited bacterial growth and gave a dark color to MRSA, indicating that ECG bound to MRSA. Thus, catechin gallates are attractive agents for therapeutic intervention. In a clinical trial, Sameshima et al. demonstrated that green tea powder greatly potentiated the effect of interferon/rivabirin therapy in intractable chronic hepatitis C patients [83] . Song reviewed laboratory studies of antiviral activities of catechins on diverse families of viruses, including hepatitis B and C virus, human immunodeficiency virus, Herpes simplex virus, and influenza virus [84] . CMDA has provided a molecular basis to explain how catechins exert anti-microbial effects as shown next.",

EGCG is an inhibitor which blocks gp120-CD4 binding. Hamza et al. examined the inhibitory mechanism by using CMDA and other methods to predict the most favorable structures of CD4-EGCG, gp120-CD4, and gp120-CD4-EGCG binding complexes in water. EGCG bound with CD4 in such a way that the calculated binding affinity of gp120 with the CD4-EGCG complex was negligible and the favorable binding of EGCG with CD4 effectively blocked gp120-CD4 binding [92] . It was suggested that EGCG can block CD4-gp120 binding, with an IC50 of about 100 \u03bcM. These findings would be useful for the development of next-generation anti-HIV-1 drugs. 3C-like protease (3CLP) of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronaviruses plays a pivotal role in viral replication and is a promising drug target. Nguyen et al. used recombinant 3CLP to study inhibition and kinetics with seven plant flavonoids [93] . The IC50 values of these flavonoids ranged from 47 to 381 \u03bcM. Quercetin, EGCG, and gallocatechin gallate (GCG) were good inhibitors with IC50s of 73, 73 and 47 \u03bcM, respectively. GCG exhibited competitive inhibition with a pKi value of 25 \u00b1 1.7 \u03bcM. CMDA showed that GCG with a binding energy of around \u221214 kcal/mol to the active site of 3CLP and the galloyl moiety at the 3-OH position was required for 3CLP inhibition activity [93] .",

This is typically illustrated in the interaction with trypsin, where the galloyl group of EGCG interacts with the active cavity while the B-ring of catechin does so [14] (Figure 3 ). Another example may be the study on Staphylococcal enterotoxin A, where EGCG and EGC bind to Tyr91 in the bioactive A-6 domain, but the responsible groups differ, in that the hydroxyl group in the galloyl group in EGCG and that of the A-ring in EGC are not the same (Figure 8) , providing a reason for which EGCG displays inhibitory activity against the activity of this toxin [89] .",

Generally, gallate-containing catechins have higher biological activity than catechins without a galloyl group and this structure-activity can be mostly explained by CMDA and XCA which show an important role of the galloyl group in the catechin-protein molecular interaction. This is typically illustrated in the interaction with trypsin, where the galloyl group of EGCG interacts with the active cavity while the B-ring of catechin does so [14] (Figure 3 ). Another example may be the study on Staphylococcal enterotoxin A, where EGCG and EGC bind to Tyr91 in the bioactive A-6 domain, but the responsible groups differ, in that the hydroxyl group in the galloyl group in EGCG and that of the A-ring in EGC are not the same (Figure 8) , providing a reason for which EGCG displays inhibitory activity against the activity of this toxin [89] .",

Based on CMDA, Farhan et al. proposed that the synthesis of any novel anticancer drug should have as many galloyl moieties as possible, which would provide an increased number of hydroxyl groups that can facilitate binding to a target macromolecule [32] . In addition, CMDA and XCA studies have proposed that conformational changes in protein induces further binding of EGCG to serum immunoglobulin light chains as shown in Figure 7 [32] .",

Moreover, most CMDA and XCA studies examined the protein interaction of only one type of catechins, for example, EGCG, in the absence of other catechins or related compounds. The synergistic effects between EGCG and other chemicals including catechins have often been observed. Therefore, it would also be important to examine the synergy or competition among catechins in the protein interaction by CMDA and XCA to assess, for example, how a protein interacts with EGCG in the presence of EGC.",
