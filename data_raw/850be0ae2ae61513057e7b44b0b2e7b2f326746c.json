            "text": "Infrared (IR) modalities represent the only currently viable mass fever screening approaches for outbreaks of infectious disease pandemics such as Ebola virus disease and severe acute respiratory syndrome. Non-contact IR thermometers (NCITs) and IR thermographs (IRTs) have been used for fever screening in public areas such as airports. While NCITs remain a more popular choice than IRTs, there has been increasing evidences in the literature that IRTs can provide great accuracy in estimating body temperature if qualified systems are used and appropriate procedures are consistently applied. In this study, we addressed the issue of IRT qualification by implementing and evaluating a battery of test methods for objective, quantitative assessment of IRT performance based on a recent international standard (IEC 80601-2-59). We tested two commercial IRTs to evaluate their stability and drift, image uniformity, minimum resolvable temperature difference, and radiometric temperature laboratory accuracy. Based on these tests, we illustrated how experimental and data processing procedures could affect results, and suggested methods for clarifying and optimizing test methods. Overall, the insights into thermograph standardization and acquisition methods provided by this study may improve the utility of IR thermography and aid in comparing IRT performance, thus improving the potential for producing high quality disease pandemic countermeasures. a The data for uniformity, accuracy, stability and drift were based on worst-case scenarios. b Uniformity values were for a \u00b11\u02daC step from ambient temperature at 80% of the central area. For other temperature, multiply by \u0394T (the difference between the ambient and the blackbody temperatures). c Calculated based on the standard uncertainty value of uniformity, stability and drift. Assuming ambient temperature of 20\u02daC and blackbody temperature of 35\u02daC.",

            "text": "IR thermography-also known as thermal imaging-is a non-contact and noninvasive imaging approach that has been exploited for a wide range of biomedical and non-biomedical applications. It has been studied for use in cancer imaging [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] , ischemic monitoring and vascular disease [8, 9] , wound assessment [10] , corneal temperature measurement [11] [12] [13] , diagnosis of rheumatologic diseases [14] , fever screening [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] been encountered in clinical translation of IR thermography. Standardization in different aspects of medical thermography, including tools (both acquisition hardware and processing algorithm) and examination environment, has always been a general agreement among the community of medical thermography [27] . The concept of standardization in thermography was introduced by the European Association of Thermography in 1978 and later a proposal for a standard was outlined by Clark et al [27] . Factors such as examination room conditions (temperature, humidity, etc.), thermographic imager accuracy, and image analysis methods were discussed in this proposal. Thereafter, with the steady increase in development and utility of IR thermography in medical applications, more detailed criteria for deployment of IR thermography were discussed and presented, resulting in improved diagnostic capability and reliability [28, 29] . Following two guidance documents published by the Standards, Productivity and Innovation Board of Singapore (SPRING Singapore), the International Standards Organization (ISO) produced two documents [18] : one describes the essential performance specification of suitable imaging systems for fever detection in humans [30] , and the other describes the deployment, implementation and operational guidelines for identifying febrile humans using a screening thermograph [31] . These two documents lay a foundation for the best practices of evaluation and application of fever-screening IR thermographs (IRTs). Many parameters are defined in these documents. Assessment of these parameters is more important for absolute temperature measurement (e.g. fever screening) than relative temperature measurement. IRTs (also known as IR/thermal cameras) and non-contact IR thermometers (NCITs) are the only currently viable temperature measurement approaches for mass screening of infectious disease pandemics, like the recent Ebola virus disease outbreak in West Africa [32] , severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 [33] , and the influenza A pandemic (H1N1) outbreak in 2009 [34] . IRTs and NCITs enable nearly real-time estimation of body temperature by detecting IR emissions, which may result in more prompt quarantine of infectious individuals. Currently, NCITs remain a more popular choice for fever screening, and all IRTs cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration have been limited to use in an adjunctive capacity and/or as a relative measurement. A document from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicates that IRTs are not as accurate as NCITs and may be more difficult to use effectively [35] . However, there has been increasing evidences in the literature that IRTs can provide greater accuracy in estimating body temperature than NCITs. A study directly compared an NCIT to three IRTs indicated that the NCIT was less accurate [36] . Another study has shown that forehead skin temperatures measured by most NCITs are a much less reliable indicator of fever than inner canthi temperatures, the suggested measuring spots for IRTs [19, 30, 37] .",

There have been standard and technical report recommending specific device performance testing requirements as well as best practices for thermographic fever screening [30, 31] . Currently, IEC 80601-2-59 is the only international standard for performance evaluation of IRTs intended for fever screening. However, some testing procedures and performance characteristics in this standard are not well-defined and the reference papers provide no discussion of their suitability or practical demonstration of their implementation. The purpose of this study is to evaluate, optimize and demonstrate the utility of a battery of test methods for standardized, objective and quantitative assessment of IRT performance based on IEC 80601-2-59.

Nominal IRT specifications are listed in Table 1 . The IRTs were attached to a stable platform and images were acquired with manufacturer-provided software. A hand-held weather meter, WM (Kestrel 4500NV, Weather Republic LLC, Downingtown, PA) was used to measure the ambient temperature and relative humidity, which are input parameters for the IRTs. The IRTs were stabilized for 15 minutes prior to each test (clause 201.101.8). A separate experiment was performed on each IRT to make sure that 15 minutes was long enough for stabilization. Measurement instability was considerably small during the normal operational condition (after the stabilization period), especially when used together with an ETRS (data are not shown here). Two extended area blackbodies with high temperature accuracy, stability, uniformity and emissivity, and low drift were used for IRT performance testing: BB-1 (SR-33N-4, CI Systems Inc., Simi Valley, CA) and BB-2 (SR-800R-4D, CI Systems Inc.). The blackbodies had the same emitter size of 4\u00d74 inch 2 . BB-1 was used as an ETRS and BB-2 as a CS. Technical specifications of the blackbodies are listed in Table 2 . All data in Table 2 were claimed by the manufacturer without independent calibration except for the total system uncertainty values that were calculated based on the claimed data. Each blackbody can be set to a target temperature within its operating range. BB-1 has an embedded controller and works in absolute mode. It is claimed to be highly accurate, with total system uncertainty of u BB1 = \u00b10.04\u02daC or expanded uncertainty of U BB1 = k \u00c1 u BB1 = \u00b10.08\u02daC (k = 2 is the coverage factor for a confidence interval of approximately 95% [44] ) and combined stability and drift of \u00b10.02\u02daC, which satisfies the standard requirements (maximum expanded uncertainty of \u00b10.3\u02daC, maximum combined stability and drift of \u00b10.1\u02daC, clause 201.101.3.1). BB-2 was claimed to have superior accuracy and stability compared to BB-1. BB-2 was used as a CS for characterizing the STs and can be operated in absolute or differential modes. The expanded uncertainty (U BB2 = \u00b10.08\u02daC) and combined stability and drift (\u00b10.02\u02daC) of BB-2 were the same as those of BB-1, which meets the standard requirement (maximum expanded uncertainty of \u00b10.2\u02daC, maximum combined stability and drift of \u00b10.05\u02daC, Annex BB in [30] ). Both blackbodies were claimed to be traceable to the NIST ITS-90 thermocouples database. The standard [30] recommends use of a CS with emissivity ! 0.998 (Annex BB). The nominal emissivity of BB-1 and BB-2 was 0.98\u00b10.01. We are not aware of any available commercial blackbody that meets the standard's requirements in the intended minimum temperature imaging range of 30\u02daC to 40\u02daC (clause 201.101.2.1). We did not find the justification for the specified emissivity in the standard. The references in the standard do not mention the emissivity of 0.998. While some cavity blackbodies have emissivity around 0.99, they usually operate at temperature higher than 50\u02daC.",

The difference between the temperatures calculated based on measured T refl and assumed T refl over the range from 30\u02daC to 40\u02daC is less than 0.08%, confirming that the assumption is reasonable. Approximating T refl with the ambient temperature is for ease of testing. However, this approximation should be verified for a given system under a given environment. In case of the presence of an excessive surrounding IR radiation, reflected temperature should be measured per ASTM recommendations [45] . Ambient IR transmissivity could be less than unity in long distance imaging and high relative humidity conditions. But given the current testing at 0.8 m, an assumption of \u03c4 atm = 1.0 was implemented. The measuring distance, relative humidity and ambient temperature can affect \u03c4 atm and such assumption should be verified for a different system under a different environment.",

The working distance between the blackbodies and the IRTs was d = 0.8 m (exception: working distance was set to 0.15 m for IRT-1 and 0.05 m for IRT-2 for short distance uniformity test and 0.35 m for MRTD evaluation inside a temperature chamber, respectively). For normal fever screening, the working distance should ensure thermograms with minimum dimensions of 240\u00d7180 pixels for the subject's face (clause 201.12.2.103) and 20\u00d720 pixels for the ETRS (clause 201.101.3.2). Given the sensor dimensions and field of view (FOV) of IRT-1 and IRT-2, as listed in Table 1 , a distance of 0.8 m is needed to achieve a 240\u00d7180 pixels thermogram of the face with a spatial resolution (clause 201.101.9) of~1 mm /pixel (i.e., one pixel can image an area of 1\u00d71mm 2 on the face). The working distances for IRTs with different sensor pixel numbers and camera FOV might be different. The size of ETRS active area is recommended to be less than 10% of the face during fever screening (Annex AA); however, we have shown that a larger size (15-20%) is also acceptable if it can be experimentally proven that the ETRS doesn't adversely affect the measurement. A cloth backdrop with low reflectivity was used to minimize reflected IR radiation from the surroundings (clause 201.7.9.3.9).

For evaluation of ST-1 and ST-2, captured BB-2 frames were corrected for temperature offset error using the ETRS (BB-1). A region of each frame within the BB-2 aperture-in this case a 60\u00d760 pixels square excluding BB-2's four edges to avoid data inaccuracy-was extracted for calculations. Then the mean temperature value within the extracted region, M frame , was calculated for each frame. Afterwards, the mean and standard deviation (SD) of the 1,920 M frame values for 8 hours of measurement (M 8h and SD 8h ) were calculated. The standard requires that three times SD 8h -the confidence interval of the observations that is greater than 99% [44] -should be less than 0.1\u02daC.

It determines the IRT efficiency for discriminating details in a scene and provides insights into its sensitivity and spatial resolution. In this study, MRTD compliance was checked based on the ASTM E1213-14 standard [50] . The MRTD test target (named 4-bar target) was an aluminum plate with high-emissivity coating. Five groups of four bars were etched away to obtain five spatial frequencies, between 0.04 to 0.2 cycles/mrad (measured at the working distance of 0.8 m). The 4-bar target was mounted in front of the extended surface of BB-2 so the BB-2 surface can be seen through the etched bars. The aspect ratio of each bar was 1:7. The differential temperature (\u0394T) between the etched bars (the background BB-2) and the conjugate bars (the area on the aluminum plate between the etched bars, maintained at the ambient temperature) was adjusted using the BB-2 controller. IRTs were focused on the target, located in the center of the WTP with the bars in the vertical direction, and images were captured and viewed on a monitor with proper brightness and contrast. The resolution of the monitor should be high enough so that the MRTD is only affected by the input thermal images instead of the monitor. Initially, \u0394T was set to zero, then gradually increased in increments of 0.005\u02daC, until the observer could visually distinguish the four bars on the screen. The mean temperatures of the etched bars and the conjugate bars were then calculated from captured thermograms, and their difference was recorded. No offset compensation is necessary for this experiment since the etched and conjugate bars are imaged in the same frame at the same time. The test was then repeated with three other observers. For each particular spatial frequency, the lowest recorded temperature difference with a detection probability of at least 50% was selected as the MRTD value [50] (in this study at least two of the four observers shall resolve the bars). The data were then plotted against spatial frequency as a metric of IRT performance. The MRTD shall be less than or equal to 0.1\u02daC (clause 201.101.5).",

For IRT-1, the whole FOV is the WTP since the sensor only have 320\u00d7240 pixels. The standard [30] required at least 29 points to evaluate the uniformity. Since the evaluation process is random, the uniformity results also show random behavior. We repeated the IEC-29-pixels method on a frame for 100 times and got the uniformity values ranged from 0.21 to 0.47\u02daC for IRT-1 and 0.24 to 0.56\u02daC for IRT-2. Therefore, each uniformity value throughout this section is the mean from 100 repeated sampling process and is expressed with average and SD values. When BB-2 was set at 37\u02daC, uniformity values within the WTPs were measured to be 0.32\u00b10.05\u02daC and 0.36\u00b10.06\u02daC for ST-1 and ST-2, respectively based on the IEC-29-pixels The modified-29-pixels method is less burdensome and more robust to artifacts associated with the uniformity than the IEC-29-pixels approach since it only needs one single frame and avoids repeated repositioning. Theoretically, for a fixed IRT focal length, the uniformity values by placing BB-2 at different distances (in-focus and out-of-focus situations) [49] should be rather close if BB-2 is highly uniform.

Two dominant spatial non-uniformities were recognized in IRT-1 at both focal lengths. The first is a vertical striping pattern likely generated during digitization or other post-processing procedures. This is not an artifact of BB-2 since the pattern remained unchanged after rotating the IRT (data not shown here). The second is a vignetting artifact (intensity reduction near the corners), likely caused by the lens. In IRT-2, striping artifacts are less apparent than in IRT-1. However, a dark circle when the camera focused at 0.05 m (and a brightened circle when the camera focused at the working distance) is seen in the center of the image, likely a narcissus effect due to IRT-2 optics [49]. A vignetting artifact, especially when the camera focused at the working distance, is also apparent in the IRT-2 image. These thermograms show the uniformity changes at different focal lengths for both IRT-1 and IRT-2 and the change for IRT-2 is more significant. Therefore, the camera should be focused at the working distance for uniformity evaluation to avoid the effect of focal length.",

Larger number of frames for averaging may lead to a higher level of uniformity for a static object, but require longer image acquisition time and may introduce blurring of the averaged image for a moving object. Presumably, motion artifact is negligible in standardized fever screening where subjects are asked to remain still at a given distance from the imager. While such image processing algorithms can be implanted in the IRT image processing pipeline to reduce image noise and improve uniformity before the output, they are not the topics of this manuscript.

Moreover, finding a WTP with best uniformity within a FOV is easy using the all-pixels method. However, the uniformity value based on the all-pixels method is much larger than other methods since the value is calculated from the maximum and minimum values of all the pixels. On the other hand, the uniformity value will be rather stable if we use SD as a uniformity measure. Our data (Fig 4b) have shown that the SD values from randomly selected pixels are rather constant if the pixel number is larger than 1000. Therefore, a simple way of evaluating uniformity is to calculate the SD values from all the pixels within the region of interest. Of course, the uniformity criterion based on SD is different from the IEC-29-pexels criterion of 0.2\u02daC. IRT-2 has uniformity values of~0.2\u02daC based on the modified-29-pixels method (Fig 5) and~0.05\u02daC based on the all-pixels-SD method (Fig 4b) . Therefore, it is reasonable to mirror the IEC uniformity criterion of 0.2\u02daC to a criterion values of approximate 0.05\u02daC based on the all-pixels-SD method. The maximum difference and SD of a large number of pixel intensity values do have correlation. Statistically, if we assume the intensity values of the pixels has a normal distribution and the largest intensity difference of 0.2\u02daC cover 95.45% of confidence level (a confidence level covered by 4 times of SD values), then the SD of the pixel intensity values can be directly calculated as 0.05\u02daC (0.2/4 = 0.05). Therefore, we propose to use the all-pixels-SD method to evaluate the uniformity and set the uniformity criterion as SD of 0.05\u02daC.",

This is in part due to the vertical striping noise seen in IRT-1 (Fig 3a) , which makes it more challenging for observers to visually resolve low contrast vertical bars. On the other hand, the MRTD values of IRT-1 are lower than those of IRT-2 for horizontal bars. For all cameras in both the vertical and horizontal directions, the MRTD values increase monotonically with spatial frequency. We propose to define the u MRTD as the difference of MRTD values between the highest and lowest target frequencies with the similar rationale as the definition of u D .",

For drift analysis, the standard requires that the experiment should be repeated every day for the device's calibration interval or two weeks, whichever is longer. We measured the device drift over two weeks since our focus is on the evaluation methods instead of the device evaluation and we assume the ETRS has high stability and low drift and has been calibrated per the calibration interval. From the experience of thermal camera drift measurements at National Physical Laboratory, drift caused by lens and/or detector changes can only truly be determined over a period longer than one month. The standard requires data acquisition every 5-15 seconds for 8 hours each day for stability and drift measurement, which will accumulate a huge amount of data for drift measurement. We evaluated the stability and drift based on longer data acquisition intervals of 30, 60, 120 and 300 seconds, and got similar results for different intervals. Therefore, data acquisition every 5 minutes might be sufficient for stability and drift measurement. Different uniformity evaluation approaches were implemented and compared. Multiple types of spatial artifacts were observed, including striping, vignetting, and narcissus artifacts. Therefore, for each individual IRT, spatial artifacts may need to be detected, analyzed and mitigated accordingly. While the focal length of IRT-1 didn't significantly affect the uniformity, it did cause lens artifacts for IRT-2 (Fig 3c and 3d) . Therefore, uniformity testing needs to be performed by focusing at the working distance but placing the CS at a shorter distance so that the CS is defocused to reduce its non-uniform effects on uniformity evaluation. Both IR cameras failed the uniformity tests following the standard (IEC-29-pixels method). This method should be further evaluated to see whether the threshold value is too tight.",

These methods are less burdensome than the IEC-29-pixels method since only one frame is needed and the CS doesn't need to be moved around. Furthermore, no offset compensation is necessary for these methods since all the pixels are from the same frame, thus no stability problem exists.

The all-pixels method showed the largest uniformity values since it considers the entire thermogram.

We suggest to average frames captured in 0.2 seconds and calculate the contrast level of the averaged frame to simulate the human eye/brain time integration system. Our data show that 10% contrast can be defined as the minimum recognizable contrast level. Therefore, the minimum temperature difference of a bar group whose image contrast is 10% can be defined as the MRTD.",

In this paper, we defined u MRTD as the difference of MRTD values between the highest and lowest target frequencies. Obviously, the u MRTD values will be larger for a wider spatial frequency range (Fig 6) . Therefore, defining a reasonable spatial frequency range is essential. The highest frequency a camera can detect is limited by both the optics (cutoff frequency) and the sensor pixel size (Nyquist frequency). Therefore, the highest spatial frequency for u MRTD measurement should be the cutoff frequency or the Nyquist frequency whichever is smaller. The lowest spatial frequency for u MRTD measurement should be a frequency that below which the MRTD value will not change.",

The evaluation data in this paper were based on the assumption that the blackbodies parameters in Table 2 are accurate. From experience of calibrating blackbodies at the National Physical Laboratory, the uncertainty values of an extended area blackbody are typically larger than the values in Table 2 . Therebefore, the blackbodies should be independently calibrated for accurate evaluation. The standard requires the emissivity of the CS should be at least 0.998. However, such CS is difficult to find. Since the CS emissivity can be compensated based on the Stefan-Boltzmann formula, a CS with emissivity around 0.98 should be sufficient. The standard recommends the size of ETRS active area to be less than 10% of the face during fever screening. However, we showed that an ETRS with larger size (in our case: 15-20%) is also acceptable if it does not negatively affect the results.",
