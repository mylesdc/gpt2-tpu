Overlapping seasonal trends of viruses were recorded over the year, with dual peaks for EV and single peaks for the others. By logistic regression analysis, EV was positively associated with the average temperature and humidity, hCoV, and PIV4, but negatively with HRV, PIV3, and hBoV. HRV was inversely associated with EV and PIV3.",

            "text": "Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are one of the illnesses of highest morbidity and mortality in children worldwide [1] [2] [3] . The pathogens causing ARIs vary geographically and by season, but globally viruses play a major role. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is by far the most common pathogen associated with severe respiratory diseases as bronchiolitis, exacerbation of asthma, or pneumonia in early life, and is a leading cause of hospitalization in children under two [4] . Influenza viruses have the greatest potential to cause severe respiratory diseases in the very young, the elderly and those with underlying chronic conditions [5] . Enteroviruses including human rhinoviruses (HRV) and human enteroviruses (EV), previously identified in childhood upper respiratory tract infections, are commonly associated with milder ARIs and have been suspected as major etiological agents of lower respiratory tract infections leading to bronchiolitis and pneumonia in infants [6] . It has also been reported that human metapneumovirus (hMPV) causes approximately 5-10% of all ARIs in children and adults [7] and adenoviruses (ADV) account for 5-15% of respiratory infections in children [8] . Respiratory illnesses can be attributable to other viruses such as parainfluenza viruses (PIV) and human coronaviruses hCoV-229E, OC43 [7] . With rapid progress in molecular diagnostics, newly discovered viruses including human bocavirus (hBoV), human coronaviruses (hCoV-NL63, hCoV-HKU1), human parechoviruses (hPeV), and polyomaviruses WU (WUPyV) and KI (KIPyV) have also been detected in children with respiratory infections, with varying levels of proof of causation [9] .",

Coinfection is reportedly related to the time of year when circulations of multiple viruses occur [11] . Some studies have shown that the prevalence of co-infections is not related to the absolute prevalence of individual viruses [12] . Factors such as young age, male gender, and history of immunosuppression are associated with an increased chance of viral co-infections [11, 13, 14] . There could be likely interactions between climatic, environmental, and behavioral factors, and complex interplay between circulating viruses and population-level immunity regarding viral coinfections.

The optimal relative humidity was 60-79% for PIV3 and 80-99% for hCoV. similar studies [6, [21] [22] [23] , were detected in 10.4% and 7.0% of our cases, with hCoVs (229E, OC43, HKU1, and NL63) in 14.4%, and relatively recently discovered viral pathogens hBoV and hMPV in 7.3% and 0.3% of cases, respectively ( Table 3) . The viral co-detection rate (38.6%, 415/1,074) was also high among our study population. Reported rates of codetection vary widely, from 6.1% among pediatric patients with influenza-like illness [19] to 62% among infants with acute bronchiolitis [24] . Detection of dual viruses is common, and co-detection of five [25] or even six viruses [26] is not anecdotal. All the cases with 5-7 viruses in this study were in May, the end of the cold season in the Chaoshan region. This may be in part due to past viral infections, as some viruses can still be detectable by PCR several weeks after infection [15, 16] . Most studies have shown that RSV is the predominant respiratory pathogen co-detected in hospitalized children, followed by HRV, PIV, hMPV, hBoV, and FluA [25, 27] . In this study, EV, HRV, hCoV, and PIV 3-4 were involved in the majority of co-detections, with EV-HRV as the most frequently co-detected pair (23% of codetections). EV and HRV were included in the panels in many studies globally [6, 7, 10, 11, 24, [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] , and the EV-HRV pair was the most commonly detected pair among outpatient children with ARIs in Finland (19.6% of codetections) [28] and infants with acute bronchiolitis in Brazil [10] . The co-detection rate of EV-HRV in this study is similar to that in Finland [28] .",

Low temperatures have been found to favor RSV in southeast China [38] , Malaysia [41] , Nepal [23] , Brazil [42] and Germany [37] , influenza in Japan [43] and Germany, and ADV in Germany [37] ; however, high temperatures favored PIV3 in southeast China [38, 44] and Nepal [23] , RSV in Singapore [45] , Hong Kong [46] , and Indonesia [47] , and ADV in southeast China [38] . No association between temperature and FluA activity was found in Nepal [23] and Brazil [42] .

Our findings on PIV3 are inconsistent with animal and laboratory observations that lipid-enveloped viruses such as PIV survived better in cooler, less humid environment [49] . hBoV was negatively associated with the average humidity, and its optimal humidity was 30-69% (Tables 4 and 5 ).

Climate could have a direct or indirect effect on viral survival, transmission efficiency, host immunity, and social behavior change [23, 37] . Cold and dry conditions might favor the transmission of viruses, and cold or rainy days could decrease outdoor activities of children and increase the probabilities of close contact and transmission of infections [37] . Holidays (supported by our data with less cases in February as Chinese new year and July-August summer holiday, Figure 2 and Additional file 3), could also play a role in an annual epidemic cycle [50] . It is likely that several factors interact in complex ways in the development of observed epidemics under optimal climatic conditions and that the contributions of individual factors vary for different viruses. Further investigations such as time series model over many years are needed to account for their inherent autocorrelations [29] , and thus the observed associations between meteorological parameters and viruses in this exploratory analysis should be interpreted with caution.",

We also found that rhinorrhea was more frequently present in patients with multiple viruses than in those with a single virus, and some viruses were more (or less) likely to exist in certain age groups or were accompanied with certain symptoms.

There were overlapping seasonal trends of many viruses throughout the year. Meteorological factors, including temperature, humidity, and wind velocity, were associated with the viral detection rates. Statistically significant associations were present among the viruses. Further studies are needed to address polyviral etiology and viral interaction in multiple virus positive cases.",
