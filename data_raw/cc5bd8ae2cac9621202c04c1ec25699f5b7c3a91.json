Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at high risk of acquiring infectious diseases and may be among the first to contract emerging infections. This study aims to explore European HCWs' perceptions and attitudes towards monitoring their absence and symptom reports for surveillance of newly circulating infections. Methods: A qualitative study with thematic analysis was conducted using focus group methodology. Forty-nine hospital-based HCWs from 12 hospitals were recruited to six focus groups; two each in England and Hungary and one each in Germany and Greece. Results: HCWs perceived risk factors for occupationally acquired infectious diseases to be 1.) exposure to patients with undiagnosed infections 2.) break-down in infection control procedures 3.) immuno-na\u00efvety and 4.) symptomatic colleagues. They were concerned that a lack of monitoring and guidelines for infectious HCWs posed a risk to staff and patients and felt employers failed to take a positive interest in their health. Staffing demands and loss of income were noted as pressures to attend work when unwell. In the UK, Hungary and Greece participants felt monitoring staff absence and the routine disclosure of symptoms could be appropriate provided the effectiveness and efficiency of such a system were demonstrable. In Germany, legislation, privacy and confidentiality were identified as barriers. All HCWs highlighted the need for knowledge and structural improvements for timelier recognition of emerging infections. These included increased suspicion and awareness among staff and standardised, homogenous absence reporting systems. Conclusions: Monitoring absence and infectious disease symptom reports among HCWs may be a feasible means of surveillance for emerging infections in some settings. A pre-requisite will be tackling the drivers for symptomatic HCWs to attend work.",

In the past, hospitals have become amplifiers of newly emerging infections due to transmission from patients to HCWs, owing to ineffective infection control measures and failing to recognise a new pathogen [4, 8] .

From May to September 2010, we conducted six 60-90 minute focus group discussions in four European countries: two each in England and Hungary and one each in Greece and Germany. The research team, comprising of a group of international partners in the aforementioned countries [12] , employed a targeted recruitment strategy to include a group of expert staff of hospitals they either were affiliated to or were particularly relevant to the study, such as those with large infectious disease departments. Purposive sampling and snowballing techniques were used to recruit hospital-based HCWs from diverse professions, departments and responsibilities. As the aim of the research was to explore a specific topic in the context of a diverse range of views, we did not sample a representative group of the healthcare worker or hospital populations. The study intends to provide the ground work for highlighting which factors could be issues in a representative and or broader population. GE, GT, TE, ES and GP identified and emailed potential participants and distributed information sheets. In total 49 staff from 12 hospitals participated and all participants had experience of working in other hospitals. A description of participating hospitals and participants is provided in table 1. AA, GE and FN prepared a protocol, topic guide and information leaflets about the study which were translated by an external company. GE, GT, TE, ES and GP facilitated the sessions in their respective countries. All participants provided written consent, and were informed that they could cease to participate at any time. They were assured their participation would remain confidential and their answers analysed anonymously.",

In general, nosocomial disease transmission risk was perceived to be low, although UK participants considered healthy people to be more likely to contract infectious diseases in a hospital than in the community. A breakdown in infection control procedures was deemed acceptable in some situations as some participants in Hungary, who worked in intensive care departments, expressed the view that they have 'more pressing issues' than following infection control procedures, such as 'saving lives'. Other members of this group however felt that staff, in particular accident and emergency staff, needed to be 'more afraid of patients' and thought intensive care staff to be more at risk, but also more aware. It was generally accepted that it was the responsibility of the individual HCW to report suspicion of nosocomial transmission incidences, though they expressed the belief that there was a need for more policies to protect the most vulnerable, such as for accident and emergency and pregnant staff.

Consequently, they were reluctant to stay at home with mild symptoms and even felt they were expected to come to work under such conditions to relieve managers from staffing pressures as, at times, managers were required to cover these shifts themselves. They felt they lacked understanding concerning the relationship between severity of symptoms and infectiousness and at which point they may pose a risk to others. The participants commented on the varying illness behaviour patterns and absence reporting practices across professions with doctors being those most likely to attend work with infectious disease symptoms (appendix 3). They stated that only severe symptoms such as high fever and acute pain would encourage higher level staff to be absent and highlighted a lack of clear guidelines for symptomatic staff in the work place. In addition, in Hungary, staff sick leave entitlements amount to less than their actual pay, further motivating HCWs to come to work when unwell or take sick leave as annual leave.

Willingness to disclose symptoms for routine surveillance however varied. UK participants were more open towards discussing symptoms and were of the view their colleagues would also be, in cases where the sickness was genuine and the rationale of the reporting system understood (appendix 4). They were nevertheless also concerned that detailed enquiries could be perceived as intrusive and provoke or increase feelings of anxiety and distrust. Further, they believed the sensitivities around disclosing this level of detail would vary depending on the individual, employer-employee relationships and the type of symptom, potentially undermining the validity of the data (appendix 4). Nevertheless, the concept was positively received as opportunities were identified for hospitals to give direction on how to manage symptomatic staff and, they in fact, anticipated reduced rates of absence.",

Specialist input would be required for the monitoring process, introducing further labour and financial burdens on hospitals. In addition, the need for HCWs to be discriminating as to which symptoms to report, could result in wide variation in reporting practice, again potentially undermining the validity of the system. With EIDs viewed as rare events, participants felt that if the detection of EIDs was the sole rationale for reporting, adherence could decline as HCWs might question the usefulness of such a system.",

With regular use of bank, temporary and contract staff, an accurate overview of absentee levels and reasons for absence within the hospital was deemed challenging.",

Participants criticised the lack of funding and resources supplied to these departments, which currently played a minor role in managing HCWs' health beyond initial employment screening. They felt occupational health departments would be well placed to manage symptom and personal health data and organise diagnostic testing, and were keen to see their function broaden, assisting with the management of acutely as well as chronically sick staff, and in particular those symptomatic in the work place. Further, they felt independent assessments of symptomatic staff by occupational health departments would make decisions to send staff home 'more valid' and minimise anxieties and scepticism (appendix 5). In all countries, participants described the current practice for sick HCWs to visit their own general practice doctors, highlighting the potential inability for these to identify unusual symptoms in the first instance and make time-spatial links with other possible cases. There was consensus on the need to expand standard management and control guidelines of infectious disease outbreaks in the work place beyond those for gastrointestinal infections. However, with occupational health departments struggling with current functions, such as promoting and providing seasonal influenza vaccinations, participants lacked confidence in the ability of these departments to manage staff with acute infections and perform epidemiological investigations. HCWs' perceptions of knowledge and structural barriers are presented in appendix 5.",

These include under-resourced occupational health services and uncertainty over the role and function of these departments (including the balance between supporting staff and managers), the issue of HCWs coming to work when feeling unwell, and the perception that senior managers or the employing organisations fail to take a positive interest in HCWs' health. Another study has also provided evidence that HCWs attend work with symptoms suggestive of communicable disease [15] . Similar to findings here, a study by Blake et al. found a loss in income was associated with the general working population's ability to comply with recommendations during an influenza pandemic in the US, resulting in symptomatic staff in the workplace [16] . A recent survey, also in the US, found that 55% of workers without sick pay compared to 37% with, would attend work with an infectious disease [17] .",
