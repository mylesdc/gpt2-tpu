One day old Pekin 6 ducklings (Anas platyrhynchos var. domesticus) and Muscovy ducklings (Cairina moschata) 7 were obtained from commercial sources. Adult 6-7 month old throughbreed ducks (Anas 8 platyrhynchos var. domesticus, \"Rouen Claire\") and geese (Anser anser var. domesticus, 9 \"Pommeranian goose\") were obtained from a local breeder and tested AIV-seronegative by 10 ELISA (ID-Vet, France) before inoculation. Animal numbers and group assignment are 11 summarized in table S2. Intravenous pathogenicity index testing (IVPI) was done according to 12 standard procedures 1 . Intramuscular pathogenicity index (IMPI) testing in one week old 13 Pekin and Muscovy ducklings followed the procedure of the IVPI in chicken, but with 14 injection of virus into the caudal femoral muscles and subsequent clinical scoring for 10 days. 15 In two subsequent experiments aadult ducks were inoculated oculo-nasally (o.n.) with 10 6 16 TCID 50 of either DE14-H5N8A or DE16-H5N8B. During the first infection experiment geese 17 (n=10) were simultaneously infected with DE14-H5N8A and housed together with inoculated 18 ducks. Virus replication was monitored by pharyngeal-and cloacal-swabs on day 2, 4, 7, 10 19 and 14 and on day 2 and 4 2 animals were sacrificed to investigate birds pathologically.",
