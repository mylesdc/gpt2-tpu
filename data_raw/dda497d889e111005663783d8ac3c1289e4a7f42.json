We prospectively studied 481 hospital HCWs in China, documented risk factors for infection, including performing HRPs, measured new infections, and analysed whether HRPs predicted infection. Infection outcomes were clinical respiratory infection (CRI), laboratory-confirmed viral or bacterial infection, and an influenza infection. About 12% (56/481) of the study participants performed at least one HRP, the most common being airway suctioning (7\u00b77%, 37/481). HCWs who performed a HRP were at significantly higher risk of developing CRI and laboratory-confirmed infection [adjusted relative risk 2\u00b79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1\u00b742-5\u00b787 and 2\u00b79, 95% CI 1\u00b737-6\u00b722, respectively]. Performing a HRP resulted in a threefold increase in the risk of respiratory infections. This is the first time the risk has been prospectively quantified in HCWs, providing data to inform occupational health and safety policies.",

Transmission of highly infectious diseases from infected patient to other patients and HCWs occurs constantly in hospitals and healthcare centres and has been well documented [1] [2] [3] . Although HCWs are aware of infection control measures, low levels of compliance with standard precautions by this group are frequent [4, 5] . HCWs are less willing to adhere to infection-control practices when they work for extended hours [6] , with probable reasons for low compliance being insufficient time, scarcity of equipment, lack of knowledge and low perception of risk [5] .",

For any pathogen, more than one transmission route may occur, but many pathogens are known to be transmitted by one predominant mode. In droplet transmission, pathogens or droplets which are larger than 5 \u03bcm, such as influenza virus and Bordetella pertussis are transmitted from an infected patient to HCWs through breathing, talking, coughing, sneezing, as well as through performing high-risk procedures (HRPs) [2, 7, 8] . However, influenza virus has also been documented to be transmitted by the airborne route, which results in infectious particles being present in the air for longer periods of time [9] [10] [11] [12] .",

Many studies suggest that both invasive and non-invasive procedures are likely to increase the probability of HCWs being infected [13, 14] . Some studies have reported that non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) can be a risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) transmission to HCWs [15] [16] [17] . Cardiopulmonary resuscitation, manual ventilation, bronchoscopy and suctioning have also been documented to increase the risk of HCWs being infected with SARS and tuberculosis (TB) [18] [19] [20] [21] , while tracheal intubation has been significantly associated with risk of SARS transmission to HCWs [17] . While it has been well documented that TB and SARS can be transmitted to HCWs during aerosol-generating procedures, there are some data suggesting H1N1 can transmit via such procedures [13] . Seasonal influenza also causes outbreaks in healthcare settings [22] . HCWs are one of the most vulnerable groups likely to be infected with influenza infection in acute-care facilities due to the high exposure rates in such settings [23] . An attack rate of nosocomial influenza could reach 11-59% in HCWs in a healthcare environment [24] . As such, HCWs are a priority group for preventive strategies such as influenza vaccination [25, 26] .",

Our findings demonstrated that HCWs who perform a HRP have a greater risk of respiratory infections than those who did not perform a HRP. This is consistent with observational findings of other studies [15, 16, 18, 21, 28] ; however, we have been able to quantify the magnitude of this risk in our study as a threefold increase in risk. Many factors influence the nosocomial spread of infectious diseases, and HCWs are the initial point of contact with patients in both acute and long-term healthcare settings. Our findings suggest that targeted interventions and policies are warranted to offer greater protection to HCWs who perform HRPs. This has occupational health and safety implications for HCWs routinely engaged in HRPs. More than 10% of HCWs performed a HRP during a 1-month period, and the majority of those performed more than one HRP. This suggests that interventions to reduce transmission of respiratory infections may be more efficient if targeted to HCWs performing HRPs. There may be certain settings such as emergency wards, intensive-care units and respiratory wards where HRPs are more commonly performed, making these important targets for interventions.",

            "text": "There are some limitations to our study. Our study was conducted in China, so the results, particularly around frequency of performing HRPs, may not be generalizable to different HCW populations in other contexts. There are variations in infection control practices from hospital to hospital, even within China. However, the quantification of risk for HCWs who perform HRPs has implications for HCWs everywhere. The fact that this was a control group in a larger trial is a strength, rather than a limitation, in that this group had rigorous follow-up and documentation of incident infection as well as risk factors (including HRPs). This provides more robust data than, for example, an observational study such as a case-control study, because it was prospective and measured infection in a group that went about usual practice. To date, there is much policy debate and direction about HRPs, but no data whatsoever to inform the actual risk associated with HRPs. Despite the limitations of the analysis, we believe that the data we present in this paper are a useful addition to current knowledge. HCWs are at higher risks of contracting respiratory infections, and are subject to generic guidelines around infection control. These include hand hygiene before and after the patient care; wearing of personal protective equipment such as gowns, goggles, gloves, N95 respirators or surgical masks; presence of minimum number of HCWs when performing a procedure in a single room; and in addition, it is recommended that such procedures should be performed in a sterilized room [13, 29, 30] . We have shown in two large randomized controlled trials that the risk of respiratory infection in HCWs can be reduced with the use of N95 respirators [27, 31] . We also show that in highrisk wards, targeted use in situations of self-identified risk, such as when performing HRPs or barrier nursing a patient, is less effective than continuous use of a respirator in that ward while on shift [31] . This suggests that HCWs are unable to identify all situations of risk when left to decide whether or not they should wear a respirator. This is the first time the risk of HCWs performing HRPs has been prospectively quantified, and this finding has important occupational health and safety implications for HCWs, particularly in settings such as emergency and respiratory wards where HRPs are frequently performed. The traditional approach to hospital infection control has not consistently categorized staff in terms of whether they perform HRPs in order to apply guidelines. We found that the majority (89%) of HCWs do not perform HRPs. This proportion may vary in different country, hospital and ward settings; our study suggests that categorizing HCWs by whether or not they perform HRPs in their work may serve as a useful classification in order to tailor guidelines appropriately or increase the attention to adherence with existing guidelines. The minority of HCWs performing HRPs should receive optimal respiratory protection, and high-risk wards should have guidelines in place to minimize the risk to HCWs. ",
