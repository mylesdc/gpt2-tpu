Although statistical data describing the relative proportion of different occupations or economic activities are available from the Hong Kong Government, the divisions are rather rough, obscure, and overlap with each other. We preliminarily define eight social groups by combining the Hong Kong Government data on population groups with potential similar location visiting behavior profiles are summarized in Table A1 .

To reduce the simulation cost, we used one day as the outbreak simulation time step and assume that individuals' infection statuses will only be altered daily. However, the unit of time in individuals' location visiting schedules might be an hour or even minutes. To coordinate the two different units, we assumed that individuals in the same location group have the same daily schedule; therefore, the possible locations that an individual visits during a day are organized into a sequence. When this assumption is made, the time of a visit to a location such as a restaurant has to be specified, because individuals may choose to visit these locations at different times, and the assumption that all of them visit a location together will cause an overestimation of social contacts. Hence, we divided each location in the restaurants, shops, public places, and transportation location groups into several locations, each representing different time periods that individuals may spend at these locations.",

The two studies that monitored CO 2 levels suggested that natural ventilation can increase ventilation rates in classrooms (Lee and Chang, 2000; Lee et al., 2002a) . There is only one tracer gas experiment conducted in the sub-groups of shops and libraries, and it used a relatively small room volume. Ventilation rates tested in hospitals are mostly conducted in isolation rooms and operation rooms (Chow and Yang, 2003; Li et al., 2007) . Consequently, there is a need for more data on the ventilation rates in large volume locations such as shopping malls, libraries, and hospital waiting rooms. Ventilation rates for high occupant density locations such as schools have also been largely neglected in the literature.",

In this model, the virus shedding abilities of infectors are assumed to be identical and constant across the infectious period. Hence, t o R can be calculated according to the expected number of infectors, I t , and the expected number of new infectors and for day t as At the beginning of the outbreak, for most individuals, the probability of being an infector is very small; using this small probability to calculate the probability of infecting others in some locations might underestimate the transmission. Furthermore, the location visiting behavior of an individual at a certain time in real life is in the model replaced by the probabilities of visiting several favorite locations; hence, there might be a dilution of the transmission ability of an infector in a simulated probability network in a single day, compared to a fixed network. Thus, although the reproductive number is small in the initial stage of the outbreak, the connectivity of the probability network is larger than that of the fixed network.
