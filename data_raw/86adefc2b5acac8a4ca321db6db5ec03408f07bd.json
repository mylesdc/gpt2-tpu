            "text": "During cell division, chromosome segregation must be coordinated with cell cleavage so that cytokinesis occurs after chromosomes have been safely distributed to each spindle pole. Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) is an essential kinase that regulates spindle assembly, mitotic entry and chromosome segregation, but because of its many mitotic roles it has been difficult to specifically study its post-anaphase functions. Here we use small molecule inhibitors to block Plk1 activity at anaphase onset, and demonstrate that Plk1 controls both spindle elongation and cytokinesis. Plk1 inhibition did not affect anaphase A chromosome to pole movement, but blocked anaphase B spindle elongation. Plk1-inhibited cells failed to assemble a contractile ring and contract the cleavage furrow due to a defect in Rho and Rho-GEF localization to the division site. Our results demonstrate that Plk1 coordinates chromosome segregation with cytokinesis through its dual control of anaphase B and contractile ring assembly.

The mitotic spindle controls both the movement of chromosomes in mitosis and the division of cells in cytokinesis. During anaphase, chromosomes are separated by moving from the metaphase plate to the spindle pole (anaphase A) and by the elongation of the mitotic spindle (anaphase B). In cytokinesis, the position of the mitotic spindle directs the assembly and contraction of an actomyosin ring, midway between the spindle poles, to cleave the cell. Although the mitotic spindle directs both the segregation of chromosomes and the specification of the cleavage plane, the mechanisms that initiate anaphase spindle dynamics and that communicate spindle position to the site of contractile ring formation are not known [1, 2] .",

            "text": "Anaphase chromosome to pole movement is triggered by dissolving the link between sister chromatids. Artificially separating sister chromatids is sufficient for anaphase A [5] , thus chromosome to pole movement appears to result from a change in the balance between sister chromatid cohesion and forces pulling chromosomes toward the spindle pole. In budding yeast, sister chromatid cohesion also regulates anaphase B as loss of chromosome cohesion is sufficient to trigger spindle elongation [6] . The regulation of metazoan spindle elongation is more complex. Removal of all chromosomes from the spindle does not result in anaphase spindle elongation [7] thus there must exist a trigger other than chromosome cohesion to initiate spindle elongation. Although the exact mechanism for anaphase B is unknown, Plk1 localizes to the spindle midzone immediately after anaphase, is known to directly phosphorylate the midzone kinesin MKLP2 [8] and is required for the midzone localization of the MKLP1 kinesin [9] . Thus Plk1 is a candidate for controlling anaphase spindle elongation but its role in the process has not been defined.",

Two Rho-GEF proteins (Tus1 and Rom2) are Cdc5 substrates and mutation of Cdc5 or the Rho-GEF proteins disrupted Rho activation at the bud neck and blocked contractile actin ring formation [27] . Budding yeast cytokinesis is unique in that cleavage plane specification is not microtubule dependent and occurs at bud emergence rather than at the time of cytokinesis [28] thus it is an interesting question as to whether Plk1 controls vertebrate cytokinesis in an analogous manner. Human cells expressing kinase dead Plk1 failed to complete cytokinesis [29] and expression of nondegradable Plk1 mutants in HeLa cells delayed cleavage furrow contraction and reduced the cleavage furrow ingression rate [30] . Depletion of Plk1 using siRNA results in a prometaphase arrest and the formation of monopolar spindles [4, 31] . The mitotic arrest caused by Plk1 depletion has made it difficult to study cytokinesis in Plk1 depleted cells, however it has been reported that cells depleted of Plk1 do not show a defect in the initiation or progression of cytokinesis [31] .",

To avoid perturbing spindle assembly or chromosome segregation, we monitored HeLa cells by differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy, added inhibitor just as chromosomes separated at anaphase and then monitored the progression of cytokinesis. Treatment of HeLa cells with either BTO-1 or BI-2536 completely blocked the ingression of the cleavage furrow resulting in cytokinesis failure ( Figure 1A , Video S1, S2 and S3). Untreated HeLa cells showed significant contraction within 15 minutes of anaphase onset ( Figure 1A Figure 1B BTO-1 and BI-2536). Plk1 inhibition also blocked cytokinesis in the kangaroo rat PtK 2 cell line ( Figure S1 , Video S4 and S5). In the more adherent PtK 2 cell line, we observed some furrow contraction late in cytokinesis but furrow contraction was significantly reduced in rate and extent ( Figure S1 , Video S5). This is consistent with the previous observation that more adherent cell lines can contract in the absence of active Rho but that less adherent HeLa cells cannot [13] . The use of two structurally unrelated Plk1 inhibitors in two different cell types suggests that the effects we observe are specific to Plk1 inhibition. Our observed inhibition of contractile ring ingression by BTO-1 and BI-2536 indicates a role for Plk1 activity early in cytokinesis during the specification or assembly phase of the contractile ring or a mechanical block to furrow ingression as seen with myosin II inhibition [35] .",

Treatment of cells with Plk1 inhibitor did not affect the formation of the spindle midzone and anaphase A chromosome to spindle pole movement occurred at the same rate as in untreated cells ( Figure S2 , Video S6).

HeLa cells rapidly resumed furrow contraction after BTO-1 washout ( Figure 3A and 3C, Video S8) but anaphase B spindle elongation did not recover ( Figure 3A and 3B, Video S8).

We previously showed that kinase inhibitors that disrupted the spindle midzone or blocked ROCK activity resulted in a loss of myosin II from the contractile ring but did not affect the localization of the contractile ring protein anillin [35] . Anillin requires Rho for its contractile ring localization but does not depend on any of known Rho effectors for its contractile ring assembly [17, 41, 42] . We examined the localization of anillin and myosin II after Plk1 inhibition and found that both anillin and myosin II were delocalized from the contractile ring ( Figure 4A , 4B).
