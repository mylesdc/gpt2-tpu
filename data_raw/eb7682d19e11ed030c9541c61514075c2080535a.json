Routinely, it requires submission of multiple samples to separate laboratories. Advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) have provided the opportunity for development of a comprehensive method to identify infectious agents. This study describes the use of target-specific primers for PCRmediated amplification with the NGS technology in which pathogen genomic regions of interest are enriched and selectively sequenced from clinical samples. In the study, 198 primers were designed to target 43 common bovine and small-ruminant bacterial, fungal, viral, and parasitic pathogens, and a bioinformatics tool was specifically constructed for the detection of targeted pathogens. The primers were confirmed to detect the intended pathogens by testing reference strains and isolates. The method was then validated using 60 clinical samples (including tissues, feces, and milk) that were also tested with other routine diagnostic techniques. The detection limits of the targeted NGS method were evaluated using 10 representative pathogens that were also tested by quantitative PCR (qPCR), and the NGS method was able to detect the organisms from samples with qPCR threshold cycle (C T ) values in the 30s. The method was successful for the detection of multiple pathogens in the clinical samples, including some additional pathogens missed by the routine techniques because the specific tests needed for the particular organisms were not performed. The results demonstrate the feasibility of the approach and indicate that it is possible to incorporate NGS as a diagnostic tool in a cost-effective manner into a veterinary diagnostic laboratory.",

The technology can randomly amplify and detect all the pathogens that may be present in a sample, enabling universal unbiased pathogen detection. Unfortunately, this random amplification results in the amplification of all the nucleic acids, including host nucleic acids, which are more abundant than the pathogen nucleic acids. Therefore, millions of reads need to be analyzed to identify the pathogen(s) of interest. This drawback is one of the major hurdles that has delayed the implementation of the technology in the diagnostic laboratory because of the number of reagents that have to be used for deep sequencing and the need for curated databases to accurately evaluate such large data sets (8, 9) . An alternative to metagenomic sequencing is targeted NGS. Targeted NGS refers to the selective capture or amplification of specific genomic regions of interest prior to massive parallel sequencing. Compared to metagenomic sequencing, the possibility of targeted sequencing discovering new pathogens is limited. However, selectively sequencing pathogens of interest provides better sensitivity, better specificity, ease of downstream analysis, and lower cost by allowing more samples to be tested in one run (10) . Targeted NGS has been applied successfully in cancer diagnostics (11) (12) (13) . All of these advantages suggest that targeted NGS can be used for syndromic testing by providing a comprehensive diagnostic assay for the detection of known, clinically relevant pathogens from a variety of specimens, particularly for cases that present nonspecific disease signs that may be associated with multiple infectious agents. Therefore, in this study, we tested 60 clinical samples (including tissues, feces, and milk) with the targeted NGS assay, along with routine diagnostic methods, to evaluate the feasibility of applying a targeted NGS technique to syndromic testing (for mastitis, enteritis, and respiratory and reproductive disease) in a clinical molecular diagnostic laboratory.",

Automated preparation minimizes sample handling and lowers the chance of contamination, as well as providing reproducible chip loading. For library construction, up to 70 ng of DNA/RNA was amplified using the designed panel (Ampliseq; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the Ion Ampliseq kit for Chef DL8, according to the manufacturer's protocol, with less than 15 min hands-on time. The kit allowed the preparation of 8 barcoded Ion Ampliseq libraries per Ion Chef run (8 different clinical cases) in about 7 h, depending on the number of cycles used for target amplification (21 cycles were used). Then, 50 pM of the 8 mixed libraries was templated and loaded on an Ion 314 chip using the Ion Chef instrument with the Ion PGM Hi-Q Chef kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific), according to the manufacturer's instructions, in about 12 h (overnight). Briefly, the prepared library was clonally amplified on the Ion Chef system by emulsion PCR of library molecules captured on A negative extraction control (NEC) was used to detect any contamination that might occur during the extraction and/or the library preparation process.

Determination of the clinical sensitivity (PPA) and specificity (NPA) of an assay requires the evaluation of every detected pathogen in every clinical case and comparing the sensitivity/specificity with those of reference standards. Given the number of pathogens that the bovine-targeted NGS assay can detect, determining the exact PPA and NPA for all the individual targets is cost prohibitive for any veterinary diagnostic laboratory. To overcome this challenge, 60 different clinical cases (57 bovine and 3 caprine) that were submitted to TVDIL and AVDL, University of Georgia, for diagnostic testing from 2015 to 2017 were included in a comparative study. The samples tested were feces (enteritis cases), milk (mastitis cases), and pooled tissue (a portion of the affected tissue was usually used, for example, lung or trachea for respiratory cases; the affected section of the intestine for enteric cases; and placenta, fetal lung, liver, kidney, brain, or stomach contents in cases of abortion). Each case was tested using the designed targeted NGS assay, along with routine laboratory diagnostic methods (reference methods). The routine diagnostic tests included bacterial cultures, DFAT, enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), PCR, qRT-PCR, and qPCR. When there was a discordant result between the targeted NGS and one of the routine diagnostic assays, the sample was examined by another, more sensitive/specific (generally PCR) diagnostic assay. The clinical cases included 16 mastitis cases, 15 respiratory cases, 20 enteric cases (2 caprine and 18 bovine), and 9 reproductive/abortion cases (1 caprine and 8 bovine). The relative PPA and NPA were assessed with respect to conventional/reference methods as a group (17) . Also, the overall agreement and Cohen's kappa (the standard agreement coefficient) were assessed by looking across all the pathogens that can be detected by the new assay relative to conventional/reference methods as a group. Relative PPA and NPA calculations were performed for a few individual organisms within the syndromes tested, and those results are also included. antibody test (DFAT). Examination of these 4 cases by a commercial rotavirus quantitative reverse transcription (qRT)-PCR (LSI VetMax Triplex; Thermo Fisher Scientific) confirmed the detection of rotavirus in only 1 case, with a C T value of 31 (Table 3 ). In one of the additional enteric cases, rotavirus was not detected by DFAT, while the targeted NGS assay and qRT-PCR were able to detect the rotavirus (C T \u03ed 23).",

            "text": "Current tests for infectious disease diagnosis rely on culture, antigen detection, and PCR. These methods often have low sensitivity and/or specificity, long turnaround times, or limited scope. As a result, the etiologies of many infections remain unknown, and patients are treated empirically. This leads to missed opportunities for targeted treatment and the overuse of antibiotics. Recent advances in NGS have provided an opportunity for the development of new research and diagnostic techniques (15) . This study showed the feasibility of the use of targeted NGS as a method for molecular detection of various types of pathogens in the same sample with a single test. The assay was able to detect pathogens that had high C T values, demonstrating the ability of the assay to detect the pathogens even if they were present at low levels. Evaluation of analytical sensitivity is usually done by testing the LOD with plasmids or in vitrotranscribed RNA. Considering the lack of availability of all the reference material needed to perform this type of testing and the prohibitive cost, we decided to limit this evaluation to relative LOD for group representatives of viral/bacterial/parasitic DNA and viral RNA. Though this is not best practice, the test is intended to detect organisms a Milk sample was collected from a healthy animal as part of a study that was done in the TVDIL. b Primers for this pathogen were not included in the panel. Targeted Next-Generation Sequencing Journal of Clinical Microbiology associated with clinical disease, so determining the absolute analytical sensitivity was considered less important than it would be if the assay was instead used for testing in which a very low limit of detection is needed, such as for foreign animal diseases or for biothreat agents. However, targeted NGS has been shown to be very sensitive and has been used for this type of testing. A targeted NGS approach was able to detect biothreat pathogens with as little as 10 copies/ml in a sample that contained multiple pathogens and was spiked with human genome. Though the sample used in that study did not reflect a true sample matrix, it showed the ability of targeted NGS to detect pathogens of interest in a complex matrix (16) . In the current study, the targeted NGS assay was able to specifically detect the targeted pathogens, as well as to provide enough pathogen coverage over the host background from various sample types, effectively removing the hurdle created by the host background nucleic acid to the application of NGS as a routine clinical diagnostic test. The bovine targeted NGS panel was able to detect pathogens that gave a C T value as high as 38. While this C T value would normally be considered a suspect result with real-time PCR testing, the use of targeted NGS provides the sequencing data to allow confirmation of detection of such small amounts of target in the sample.",

The kappa statistic is commonly used to measure agreement between two tests. However, when a new assay is being compared to an imperfect reference, the PPA and NPA are more appropriate metrics of comparison than the overall agreement or the kappa statistic. The overall percent agreement does not differentiate between agreement on the positives and agreement on the negatives. Kappa statistics is sensitive to the distribution of the marginal totals. A substantial imbalance in the marginal totals, shown in Table 4 , either vertically or horizontally, can result in high agreement but a lower kappa value (17) , which is what was observed in this study. This type of comparison among the entire group of organisms detected is more suitable for a metagenomic-type test and over-or underrepresents the PPA and NPA for each individual target, as shown by evaluating a few organisms individually. However, it does give a general idea of the capability of the method. It is important to note that the number of cases for each individual organism was very small, and additional testing to evaluate all the discrepant results could not be performed for each individual case.",

However, the high C T value of this case revealed a very small amount of viral RNA in the sample, suggesting that rotavirus was not necessarily a significant cause of the enteritis in this case; indeed, Cryptosporidium, which was also detected, appears to have been the primary cause of the clinical disease. Therefore, given the lack of clinical significance of the PCR findings, the reduced sensitivity to rotavirus in the NGS method is not a concern (18). The positive rotavirus DFAT results in 3 enteric cases that were negative by commercial rotavirus A-specific qRT-PCR indicate that DFAT is problematic as a diagnostic tool for rotavirus. Though DFAT provides rapid results, its diagnostic usefulness is limited by poor sensitivity and specificity, a cumbersome procedure, the quality of the antibody used, and subjective reading/interpretation of results (19, 20) .",

Consequently, it is sometimes difficult to determine if these organisms are true pathogens based on culture results alone. To overcome this problem, the targeted NGS assay was designed to detect E. coli and C. perfringens virulence factors/toxins to discriminate commensals from pathogenic bacteria. Therefore, lack of detection of virulence factors or toxins in these specific cases suggests the culture of normal flora or perhaps the presence of virulence factors that were not detected by the assay because the specific primer set was not included in the panel. Based on detection of other pathogens in these cases that could account for the observed lesions, it was concluded that culture of normal flora was more likely (Table 3) .",

NGS may not have detected the pathogens that were present in the sample in very low loads and were outcompeted by the other pathogens that were abundant in the cases. This resulted in variability in the PPA and NPA among the organisms detected. Generally, the detection of multiple pathogens in a clinical sample by either targeted NGS or conventional diagnostic methods should be evaluated in light of the clinical disease and pathological findings. Detection of a bacterium or virus in a sample does not necessarily discriminate the true pathogen from an innocent bystander or a component of the normal flora. Organism quantity in a sample is helpful for determining clinical significance, and the targeted NGS method can give a general estimate of the pathogen load via the read numbers, but this is not as absolute as quantitative real-time PCR.
