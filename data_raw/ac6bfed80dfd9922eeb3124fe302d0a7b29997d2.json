The use of nanoparticles in vaccinology is inspired by the fact that most pathogens have a dimension within the nano-size range and therefore can be processed efficiently by the immune system, which leads to a potent immune response. Herein, we report a facile approach to increase antigen size to achieve not only fast but also effective responses against the recombinant HA/H7N9 protein via a simple conjugation of the protein onto the surface of nanodiamond particles.",

The trimeric H7 solution was subsequently mixed with a nanodiamond suspension in different ratios. The successful conjugation of the trimeric H7 onto the surface of nanodiamond particles was demonstrated by the changes in size and Zetapotential of the particles before and after protein coating, Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and Western-blot analysis. Next, biofunction of the protein-nanodiamond conjugates was screened using a haemagglutination assay. A mixture containing 5 \u00b5g of trimeric H7 and 60 \u00b5g of nanodiamond corresponds to a ratio of 1:12 (w/w) of agglutinated chicken red blood cells at HA titer of 1024, which is 512-fold higher than the HA titer of free trimeric H7. After the 2nd and 3rd immunization in mice, ELISA and Western blot analyses demonstrated that the physical mixture of trimeric H7 protein and nanodiamond (1:12, w/w) elicited statistically significant stronger H7-specific-IgG response demonstrated by higher amounts of H7N9-specific IgG (over 15.4-fold with P < 0.05 after the second immunization).",

With excellent mechanical and optical properties, high surface areas, tunable surface structures and biocompatibility, nanomaterials are well suited to biomedical applications. Previous studies have shown that strong acid-oxidized NDs have a remarkably high affinity for proteins [2, 11] . Thus, proteins and NDs can form stable conjugates easily and effectively in different buffers via physical absorption. It is also unique that both soluble proteins and native membrane proteins solubilized in detergent micelles can be easily conjugated onto the surface of NDs, likely due to the intrinsic hydrophobicity of the carbon-based nanomaterial [17, 18] . This characteristic allows a facile and effective loading of a high amount of protein molecules on their surface for bio-medical applications. For ~ 100 nm NDs, a 20-30-\u00b5g weight of nanoparticles can carry a 1 \u00b5g dried weight of protein [2, 17] .",

H7N9 viruses, along with many other emerging influenza subtypes, challenge scientists to develop faster and more efficacious vaccines. Haemagglutinin (HA), which is the major protein of influenza H7N9 virus envelope, contains virus-neutralizing epitopes and is included in all currently approved human influenza vaccines as well as in majority of experimental vaccines [5] .

The optimal mixture of trimeric H7 and NDs (designated as H7:ND) was screened using the Western blot and haemagglutination assays that are based on the binding capacity of trimeric H7 on the surface of NDs and the ability of trimeric H7 to agglutinate chicken red blood cells (RBCs), respectively. The successful conjugation of trimeric H7 onto the surface of NDs was analysed using a particle analyser, SDS-PAGE, and Western blot. The trimeric H7 protein, NDs and the optimal mixture of H7:ND were injected in mice. Then, the immunogenicity induced by the optimal mixture of H7:ND in mice was compared to that of trimeric H7 as well as NDs only according to ELISA and Western blot.",

Following cross-linking, reaction products were separated on a gradient of 4-10% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, blotted and immune detected using an antic-myc monoclonal antibody.

These results indicate that the ability to agglutinate chicken RBCs increased using the mixture of trimeric H7 and more ND, which corresponds to the H7:ND ratios of 1:1-1:12 (w/w). This confirms that H7:ND retained its function of RBCs binding ability. The mixture of H7:ND at the ratio of 1:12 (w/w) exhibited the highest haemagglutination activity (HAU = 1024 per 50 \u03bcL of the mixture of 100 ng/ \u00b5L H7:1.2 \u00b5g/\u00b5L ND). In contrast, for the mixture with an H7:ND ratio of 1:15 (w/w), the HA titer was decreased (HAU = 512) due to an unknown reason. The PBS:ND at the ratio of 1:15 (w/w) (not other PBS:ND ratios) agglutinated chicken RBCs at HA titer of 4. This means that at a certain amount of ND, it can bind to receptors on the surface of RBCs to create the network with RBCs. We suggest a hypothesis that ND may act as a non-competitive/ competitive inhibitor of H7 if too much NDs are present in the mixture of H7:ND (H7:ND ratio of 1:15, w/w). We observed that the free trimeric H7 (50 \u03bcL of 100 ng/ \u00b5L = 5 \u00b5g) was able to agglutinate RBCs at HA titer of 2, which is 512-folds less than HA titer of the H7:ND mixture at a ratio (w/w) of 1:12.

            "text": "In the present study, the trimeric H7 protein was formed by fusing H7 with a trimeric GCN4pII heptads repeat sequence derived from a wild-type dimeric GCN4 repeat found in Saccharomyces cerevisiae [7, 28] . To generate oligomeric H7 as a synthetic H7-VLP formation, trimeric H7 was physically mixed with a mixture of NDs in a wide range of sizes from ~ 50 to ~ 500 nm in diameter in optimized ratios. In the current study, we have shown that a facile and successful conjugation of H7 onto the surface of NDs can be obtained by simply mixing them together in DI-H 2 O. Characterization of the H7:ND complexes via size measurements, SDS-PAGE, Westernblot, and haemagglutination assay showed that recombinant proteins are non-covalently conjugated onto ND surface, and the activity of protein is well preserved after conjugation. In the previous study, it was shown that rH7 isolated from Sf9 cells represents high-molecular-weight VLP nanoparticles of approximately 20 nm that are likely comprised of 3-4 HA trimers, and that data suggest that the majority of H7 forms oligomeric VLP, which may be important for immunogenicity [23] . In the present study, the change in surface chemistry of NDs after trimeric H7 coating is not prominent since the Zeta-potential of ND and H7:ND was ~ \u2212 45 and ~ \u2212 38 mV, respectively. Since H7 is a glycoprotein, it is more likely that the protein does not interact with NDs through its glycanexpressing regions. After protein conjugation onto the ND surface, its glycans with negatively charged molecules are exposed to water. Because ND is a carbon-based nanoparticle, it likely interacts with the protein through hydrophobic forces as also observed for other membrane proteins [17] . Thus, the glycan expression domains of H7, a Western blotting analysis confirms the conjugation of trimeric H7 with ND at different ratios. Trimeric H7 (100 ng/\u00b5L) was used for combining with NDs at different ratios (1:1, 1:3, 1:5, 1:7, 1:9, 1:12, 1:15, w/w). After mixing, the resulting products were washed in water and diluted in PBS. The same volume of H7 (2.5 \u00b5g) and all mixtures of H7:ND separated by 10% SDS-PAGE were blotted and detected with anti-c-myc monoclonal antibody followed by horseradish peroxidase-linked sheep anti-mouse IgG as a secondary antibody. b Bio-functional characterization of trimeric H7 and the mixture of trimeric H7 and ND via a haemagglutination assay.

Notably, our synthetic H7-VLP exhibited a haemagglutination activity at a minimum total protein amount of 0.01 \u03bcg (Fig. 5b) , which is lower than the minimum total protein amount of H7 VLP exhibiting haemagglutination activity from previous studies of Hu et al. [9] and Pushko et al. [23] of 0.098 and 0.039 \u03bcg, respectively. In contrast, in the present study, the free trimeric H7 agglutinated chicken RBCs at a minimum amount of total protein of 5 \u03bcg. These data suggest that ND presents a potential effect related to bio-function of H7 VLP shown in haemagglutination activity.",

H7:ND may form oligomeric H7 as synthetic H7-VLPs that enhance H7 presentation and immune processing and are transported to draining lymph nodes for stronger H7-specific IgG immune responses. In a previous study, synthetic VLPs were prepared by mixing 100 nm gold nanoparticles and a spike protein [1] . Compared with inoculation with free proteins, vaccination with synthetic VLP showed enhanced lymphatic antigen delivery, stronger antibody titers, increased splenic T-cell response, and reduced infection-associated symptoms in an avian model of corona virus infection [1] . VLPs can act as adjuvants by carrying peptide sequences into antigen presenting cells and thus enhancing antigen processing pathways [25] . Surfacemodified diamond nanoparticles can conformational stabilize proteins/peptides. NDs also provide a high degree of surface exposure to protein antigens. The elicitation of a strong and specific immune response as we observed can thus be explained by an adjuvant effect [15] .",

Our result demonstrated the successful preparation of synthetic VLP via physical mixing of NDs with trimeric H7. Vaccination with the physical mixture of 5 \u03bcg of trimeric H7 protein and 60 \u03bcg of NDs elicited stronger H7 specific-IgG immune responses than free trimeric H7 protein. NDs have the potential to improve vaccine efficacy. NDs will continue to address challenges remaining in immunology and provide innovative strategies that can be broadly applied for the development of different vaccines in the future.

Fig. 6 Immunopotentiation following immunization with an H7:ND (1/12, w/w) conjugate. a Immunization scheme in mice. b Measurement of H7 specific IgG amount in mouse sera via ELISA. In total, 50 ng of purified H7 [Influenza antigen A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9), NIBSC] per well were coated at the plate. The sera were diluted 1:5000 and a monoclonal mouse anti-H7N9 haemagglutinin/HA antibody (SinoBiological InC.) at concentrations of 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25, 2.5, 5, 12.5, 25, 50, 100, 150 \u03bcg/mL was applied as a standard, then analysed via ELISA. Specific immune responses were measured at 450 nm after 1 and 2 booster immunizations with H7 (group 1), H7:ND (group 2) and PBS:ND (group 3). The responses were recalculated according the standard values as \u00b5g/mL anti H7N9 antibody in the sera. The BSA background was subtracted. A standard curve was built by the help of OD450 values corresponding to known amounts of H7N9 haemagglutinin/HA antibody. The amount of H7 specific IgG antibody in mouse sera was measured via the standard curve. Statistical analyses were performed using the t-test (SigmaPlot) and are presented. A single dot indicates the value of a single mouse serum. SD was included on a single dot that corresponds to an ELISA data variation of a single mouse serum with three replications. The bars indicate the average value of the test groups. P < 0.05 was defined as a statistically significant difference. c Detection of H7-specific IgG antibodies via a Western blot. Sera from five mice from each group (against H7, H7:ND and PBS:ND as a negative control) were mixed, diluted 500 times and used as a primary antibody for detecting 100 ng of purified H7 [Influenza Antigen A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9), NIBSC]. Anti-mouse H7N9 haemagglutinin/HA antibody (SinoBiological InC.) was used as a primary antibody (positive control: P). HRP-linked goat anti-mouse IgG was used as a secondary antibody",
