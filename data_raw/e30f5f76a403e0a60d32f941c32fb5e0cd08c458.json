            "text": "n our previous study, we have shown that canine coronavirus type II (CCoV-II) activates both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathway in a canine fibrosarcoma cell line (A-72 cells). Herein we investigated the role of Sirtuin and Forkhead box O (FOXO) families in this experimental model using Nortern Blot and Western Blot analysis. Our results demonstrated that mitochondrial SIRT3 and SIRT4 protein expression increased from 12 and 24 h post infection (p.i.) onwards, respectively, whereas the nuclear SIRT1 expression increased during the first 12 h p.i. followed by a decrease after 36 h p.i., reaching the same level of control at 48 h p.i. Sirtuins interact with/and regulate the activity of FOXO family proteins, and we herein observed that FOXO3A and FOXO1 expression increased significantly and stably from 12 h p.i. onwards. In addition, CCoV-II induces a remarkable increase in the expression of TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), while we observed a slight up-regulation of FasL/Fas at 36 p.i. with a decrease of both proteins at the end of infection. Furthermore, we found that virus infection increased both bax translocation into mitochondria and decreased bcl-2 expression in cytosol in a timedependent manner. These data suggest that FOXO transcription factors mediate pro-apoptotic effects of CCoV-II, in part due to activation of extrinsic apoptosis pathway, while some Sirtuin family members (such as SIRT3 and SIRT4) may be involved in intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Moreover, these results propose that TRAIL is an important mediator of cell death induced by CCoV-II during in vitro infection.",

Furthermore, they have been implicated in the control of critical cellular processes such as differentiation, proliferation, metabolism, senescence, apoptosis, as well as in transcriptional silencing, genetic control of aging, and calorie restriction-mediated longevity of organisms ranging from yeasts to humans [6, 7] . In mammals, there are seven members of the Sirtuin family of proteins (SIRT1 to SIRT7). Among those, SIRT1 also known as the guardian of cellular integrity, is primarily located in the nucleus. In addition to histones, SIRT1 has been shown to deacetylate other proteins, including forkhead transcription factors box O (FOXO) [8] . SIRT1 can monitor cellular metabolism and exert corresponding effects on gene expression. Previous studies showed that SIRT1 is a key regulator of cell defenses and survival in response to stress [8] , and deacetylates and represses FOXO1 dependent apoptosis [9] . Other authors reported that SIRT1 increases the ability of FOXO3A to induce cell cycle arrest and resistance to oxidative stress, but inhibited the ability of FOXO3A to induce cell death [10] . In addition, FOXO transcription factors control cell proliferation and survival by regulating the expression of genes involved in cell-cycle progression, for instance cyclin D1/2, and apoptosis, for instance Bim, tumour-necrosis-factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) and Fas ligand (FasL) [11, 12] . Cellular death receptors (DRs) transmit apoptosis-inducing signals initiated by specific death ligands, most of which are primarily expressed as biologically active type II membrane proteins that are cleaved into soluble forms. FasL activates Fas, and TRAIL activates DR4 (TRAILR1) and DR5 (TRAILR2) [13] . Moreover, TRAIL can activate the apoptotic pathway of cells by modulating the Bcl-2 family proteins, particularly the proapoptotic member Bax [14] . To perform Northern blot assay, RNA was extracted from mock-infected (lanes cc, control cells) and infected cells at the indicated times, electrophoresed and hybridized with a labelled probe as described under Material and Methods. b-actin was used as loading control. Blot is representative of three separate experiments. (B) Densitometric analysis of blots relative to SIRT3. The bars represent the mean 6 SEM of the results from three separate experiments.

The role of SIRT3 in the mechanisms of cell death and cell survival is still controversial. In fact, it has been demonstrated that the mitochondrial NADdependent deacetylase SIRT3 plays a role in the maintenance of basal ATP levels and as regulator of mitochondrial electron transport [16] . SIRT3 decreases mitochondrial membrane potential and reactive oxygen species production, while increasing cellular respiration [17] . Furthermore, SIRT3 regulates acetyl-CoA synthetase 2 [18, 19] and glutamate dehydrogenase [20, 21] . On the other hand, SIRT4 has been shown to inhibit glutamate dehydrogenase in pancreatic beta cells [15] and, in concert with SIRT3, to function as a mitochondrial NAD(+)-dependent deacetylase [22] . In this regards, it is important to note that little else is known about biological functions of SIRT4 [21] . Moreover, sirtuins also regulate viral transcription. SIRT1-SIRT3 can deacetylate the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 1 transactivator Tat, thereby promoting viral transcription [23] . Interestingly, the observation that SIRT1 inhibitors can reduce HIV transcription suggests that SIRT1 antagonists could prove useful to combat viral infection.",

In particular, significant increases of SIRT1, FOXO3A and FOXO1 protein levels were evident at 12 h p.i. (P,0.01) ( Figure 4A, B) . Expression levels of SIRT1 protein peaked at 12 h p.i.

            "text": "Sirtuins are considered key regulators of cell survival and apoptosis through their interaction with nuclear and mitochondrial proteins. Moreover, it is established that sirtuins interact with and regulate the activity of FOXO gene family proteins [28, 29] . Since SIRT1 itself does not bind to DNA directly, targeted deacetylation of histones is thought to occur through its interaction with specific DNA binding factors, such as FOXO3A and FOXO1. Thus, SIRT1 can bind and deacetylate FOXO3A and FOXO1, leading to a selective augmentation of FOXO-regulated stress resistance genes [9, 10] . In this study, to better understand the mechanism of canine coronavirus type II-induced apoptosis, we examined the role of SIRT1, SIRT3 and SIRT4 during the CCoV-II infection. Furthermore, we investigated the evolving relationship between SIRT1 and FOXO3A/FOXO1 members. Our data show a different pattern in both gene and protein expression of SIRT1, FOXO3A and FOXO1 over the course of CCoV-II infection. After an early up-regulation of SIRT1, we observed after 12 h p.i. a gradual decrease in expression when levels fell back to those of the control cells. Such modification in expression level of SIRT1 might led to an increased expression of pro-apoptotic FOXO targets such as bim. This hypothesis is consistent with our previous work in which we have observed an increased time-dependent expression of bim during the CCoV-II infection [4] . On the other hand, it was already reported that the FOXO3A/FOXO1-induced cell death is mediated through bim, which is one of the FOXO-target genes [30] [31] [32] . It has also been shown that expression levels of TRAIL, FasL and Fas, which are further transcriptional targets of FOXO, can control cell cycle and apoptosis [31, [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] . For this reason, in the present study, we also investigated protein expression of TRAIL, FasL and Fas. In our study, it appears that TRAIL expression level increased at 12 h p.i., when CCoV-II-induced apoptosis starts, as previously described [4] . While a slight up-regulation in the expression of FasL/Fas protein levels occurred only in the late stage of infection. Our results suggest that CCoV-II infection modulates the TRAIL expression levels more than that of FasL/Fas, suggesting that the contribution of TRAIL with respect to that of FasL/Fas is more crucial in CCoV-II-induced extrinsic apoptotic pathway. Strong induction of TRAIL but not FasL expression in SARS coronavirus infected human monocytes derived dendritic cells was also observed [38] . In general, viral infection can lead to apoptosis of host cells, through two apoptotic pathways, the death receptors pathway (extrinsic pathway) and the mitochondrion pathway (intrinsic pathway). These two pathways interact together to coordinate apoptosis [39] . Particularly, infection of a canine fibrosarcoma cell line by CCoV-II resulted in an apoptotic process [3, 4] depending on the activation of both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of the caspases cascade [4] . Previously, we demonstrated that CCoV-II triggers apoptosis in A-72 cells through the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, and alterations in the proand anti-apoptotic members of Bcl-2 family [4] . To better understand the mitochondrial alterations, herein, we have also examined the role of some mitochondrial SIRT proteins. It is known that the coordinated actions of two mitochondrial sirtuins, SIRT3 and SIRT4, are able to inhibit cell death by maintaining constant mitochondrial NAD + levels following stress [22] . In this study, we observed the SIRT3 and SIRT4 increase in the mitochondria depending upon CCoV-II-infection. Recently, it has been shown that SIRT3 can block bax translocation to the mitochondria and hence prevent cardiomyocytes stress-mediated cell death [40] . Since we observed an increasing trend of SIRT3 expression from 12 p.i. onwards, such result could either suggest that, in our system, SIRT3 does not render infected cells resistant to bax-mediated cell damage or, more likely, that SIRT3 facilitates the apoptotic pathway activated by CCoV-II. In fact, SIRT3 has been associated with induction of cell death by regulating distinct basal apoptotic pathways [41] and SIRT3 overexpression has also been shown to increase in kaempferol induced apoptosis [42] . The increasing trend of SIRT4 in the mitochondria with peaks at 24 and 36 hours of post infection that we observed is more difficult to interpret due to the fact that very little is known about the activity and specificity of SIRT4 in apoptosis.",

The link between activation of the FOXO proteins and cell death was well established, and it was identified the role of the pro-apoptotic gene FasL in the activation of the death receptor Fas/CD95/APO-1 promoting mitochondria-independent apoptosis [11, 12] . For this reason, we believe that both the activation of extrinsic apoptotic pathway by FOXO transcription factors, TRAIL-FasL/Fas, and the activation of intrinsic apoptotic pathway by Sirtuin proteins such as SIRT3 and SIRT4 occurred during CCoV-II infection.",
