Information on sapovirus infection of wildlife is limited and is currently lacking for any free-ranging wildlife species in Africa. By screening a large number of predominantly fecal samples (n = 631) obtained from five carnivore species in the Serengeti ecosystem, East Africa, sapovirus RNA was detected in the spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta, family Hyaenidae), African lion (Panthera leo, family Felidae), and bat-eared fox (Otocyon megalotis, family Canidae), but not in golden or silver-backed jackals (Canis aureus and C. mesomelas, respectively, family Canidae). A phylogenetic analysis based on partial RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene sequences placed the sapovirus strains from African carnivores in a monophyletic group. Within this monophyletic group, sapovirus strains from spotted hyenas formed one independent sub-group, and those from bat-eared fox and African lion a second sub-group. The percentage nucleotide similarity between sapoviruses from African carnivores and those from other species was low (< 70.4%). Long-term monitoring of sapovirus in a population of individually known spotted hyenas from 2001 to 2012 revealed: i) a relatively high overall infection prevalence (34.8%); ii) the circulation of several genetically diverse variants; iii) large fluctuations in infection prevalence across years, indicative of outbreaks; iv) no significant difference in the likelihood of infection between animals in different age categories. The likelihood of sapovirus infection decreased with increasing hyena group size, suggesting an encounter reduction effect, but was independent of socially mediated ano-genital contact, or the extent of the area over which an individual roamed.",

If so, individuals with a limited range may be less likely to encounter virus infected feces than those with an extensive range. In the Serengeti NP, adult and subadult hyenas (i.e. those !12 months of age) not only range throughout the approximately 56 km 2 of their clan's territory, but also undertake long distance foraging trips (of approximately 140 km distance round-trip) from their clan territory [46, 47] . The ranges of cubs (<12 months of age) are by comparison extremely limited, being restricted to the communal den area within the clan territory [47] . If the extent of an animal's range determines its chance of encountering virus infected feces, then all else being equal, cubs should be less often infected with sapovirus than older animals.",

Currently nothing is known about the immunological responses of spotted hyenas to sapovirus infection, or the length of immunological protection following sapovirus infection. Even so, if sapovirus infection induces long-term immunity against reinfection regardless of strain-type, we would expect cubs (i.e. na\u00efve animals) to be more prone to infection than adults, as is the case for coronavirus infection in this species [35] . However, if sapovirus infection provides only short-term immunity, we would expect re-infections among animals of all ages.

Following collection, feces were thoroughly mixed and divided in aliquots. Tissue samples (5 intestine, 2 liver, 9 lung, 10 lymph node, 12 spleen, 10 blood, 1 muscle, 1 saliva) were also collected opportunistically from dead spotted hyenas which were mostly killed by lions or when hit by motor vehicles [40] and hence were not necessarily members of study clans, and from two other carnivore species (bat-eared fox: 2 intestines; silver-backed jackal: 1 intestine, 2 liver, 3 lung). Both fecal and tissue samples were stored and transported frozen at -80\u00b0C, or were preserved in RNAlater (Sigma-Aldrich Inc., St. Louis, MO, USA), stored initially at -10\u00b0C, and finally stored at -80\u00b0C until analyses [35, 36] .",

Sapovirus RNA was detected with the broadly reactive primer pair p289 and p290 [52] targeting highly conserved motifs in the RdRp protein of caliciviruses. Based on the sequences initially generated, nested primers were designed, Cali2F (5'-CAG TGA CAG CCA CAT CCT TG-3') and Cali2R (5'-AGC ACT GCA GCA GCA AAG TA-3'), targeting the RdRp gene. RT-PCR was performed using SuperScript TM III One-Step RT-PCR System with Platinum 1 Taq DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) following the user manual's instructions in a total reaction volume of 25\u03bcl. Amplicons of the expected size were purified using the Qiagen PCR purification Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). In order to avoid RNases, all surfaces were cleansed with RNase away (Molecular BioProducts, San Diego, CA, USA). The purified products were sequenced bidirectional using the Big Dye Terminator Cycle sequencing kit 1.1 (Applied Biosystems [ABI], Darmstadt, Germany) following the manufacturer's instructions. A 3130 Genetic Analyzer (ABI) was used for the sequencing. Subsequently, sequences were assembled in Geneious v 9.0.2 (Biomatters Ltd, Auckland, New Zealand) or BioEdit 7.0.9.0 [53] . Samples that could not be sequenced were considered positive when bands of the expected size were present with both primer pairs. For these samples the RT-PCRs were run in duplicate to ensure that the results were reliable. To obtain a longer segment of the RdRp gene, the primer 90R (5'-RCC CTC CAT YTC AAA CAC TA-3') was used together with the primer CaliR2.. GenBank accession numbers for 20 sequences identified by this study are designated KT777545-KT777564. These accession number are included in our phylogenetic tree (Fig 2) , together with the host species, the year in which the variant was collected and for spotted hyenas also clan membership, denoted as I,M,P if know or Z if not known. All partial RdRp genes sequences (210 nucleotides, 70 amino-acids) presented the characteristic caliciviral GLPSG motif. One sample from a spotted hyena in 2011 was sequenced for a longer fragment of the RdRp gene (700 nucleotides, 233 amino-acids, accession number KT777560) which presented both the GLPSG motif and the YGDD motif.",

In order to assess whether the range of an animal, the size of the area over which an individual typically roams, determines the chance of exposure to pathogens, we classified adults and subadults of both sexes with an extensive geographical foraging range as 'roaming' , because they range both within their clan territory (~55-75 km 2 ) and undertake long distance foraging trips outside the clan territory [46, 47] . Cubs were classified as 'den-bound' , i.e., with a small range restricted to the vicinity of the communal den inside the clan territory.

This permitted us to show the effect of clan size on the likelihood of infection whilst controlling for the covariates contact rate and lifetime range at their middle values.

Of these, 15 individuals were sampled on at least three separate occasions, and from five of these animals on a fourth occasion ( Table 2) .

In many cases the infection status did not change between sampling dates, for both initially negative (negative to negative, 53 cases) and initially positive individuals (positive to positive, 11 cases).

Transition intervals were similar between first and second, second and third, and third and fourth sampling date (Kruskal-Wallis test, H = 2.567, df = 2, p = 0.28). We therefore analyzed the relationship between the duration of time intervals between successive samples and changes in infection status without regard to the number sampling repeats per individual. The duration significantly varied between different categories of changes of infection status (survival analysis, log-rank test, log-likelihood ratio = 10.114, df = 3, p = 0.018).

The results revealed that infection was not significantly altered by either contact rates or the extent of an individual's range ( Table 3 ). The likelihood of infection significantly declined as clan size increased: with every additional individual in the clan, clan members were 1.02 times less likely to be infected with sapovirus ( Table 3) . As the actual clan sizes ranged from 65 to 145 individuals, this implied a more than two-fold change in the likelihood of infection across the observed range of clan sizes (Fig 4) . Correspondingly, median clan sizes were significantly lower during outbreak (median = 77, mean = 83.6, with 95% C.I.: 81.4-85.9) than non-outbreak (median = 89, Table 2 .

Our results extend the host species range for this genus to include the spotted hyena, African lion and bat-eared fox. Prior to our study, sapovirus infection in carnivores worldwide was not known from any species belonging to the Felidae (including the domestic cat) [72] , or Hyaenidae, but was reported only for species in the families Otariidae (Californian sea lion) [23] , Mustelidae (mink) [25] and Canidae (domestic dog) [26] . Our phylogenetic analysis based on partial RdRp gene sequences revealed that sapovirus strains from wild carnivores in the Serengeti ecosystem formed a monophyletic group that was distinct from other sapovirus strains worldwide, including strains from the three previously identified carnivore hosts (Fig 2) . Strains from spotted hyena formed a separate sub-group from those obtained from African lions and bat-eared foxes, even within the same sampling year (Fig 2) , suggesting that strains circulating in the spotted hyena population are distinct from those in the African lion and bat-eared fox populations. Evidence for a degree of species- specificity in host range is apparent in other viruses of carnivores in the Serengeti ecosystem. Genetically distinct alphacoronavirus variants infect spotted hyenas and sympatric silverbacked jackal during the same year [35] , genetically distinct strains of kobuvirus infect domestic dogs and wild carnivores [36] , and during the 1993/1994 canine distemper epidemic in the Serengeti NP, genetically distinct strains circulated in non-canids (African lion and spotted hyena) and canids (domestic dog and bat-eared fox) [73] . More extensive characterization of sapovirus strains infecting carnivore species in the Serengeti ecosystem would clarify their host range and help identify which species in the large carnivore guild are infected with sapovirus. Currently it is not known whether or not domestic dogs and domestic cats in Africa are infected with sapovirus.",

Clearly we would have detected far less genetic diversity in our partial RdRp gene sequence data had our sampling of spotted hyenas been limited to a time frame of one or two years (Fig  2) , and particularly if sampling was (by chance) only undertaken during non-outbreak years when infection prevalence was low (Fig 3) . Samples obtained during outbreak years revealed considerable genetic diversity; for example from 2006 to 2007 we obtained sequence data from five different variants, including the distinct 2007 variant (KT777556) which was the least similar to all others from this host species. As we were not able to sequence data from all RT-PCR positive samples, we cannot exclude the possibility that the genetic diversity among spotted hyena strains was higher than our results indicate. Even so, in line with a previous study [74] , our result show that sequence data from the non-structural RdRp gene yields useful information on the genetic diversity of circulating sapovirus strains.",

Our long-term monitoring of sapovirus infection in spotted hyenas revealed significant changes in yearly prevalence during the study (Fig 3) and the occurrence of three outbreaks of infection. The highest infection prevalence (above 72.4%) occurred during an outbreak from 2002 to 2004, whereas infection prevalence in two later outbreaks (from 2006 to 2007 and in 2010) was considerably lower. Presumably the 2002/2004 sapovirus outbreak induced herd immunity to the genetic strains that circulated in spotted hyenas during this period, but our phylogenetic analysis (Fig 2) did not reveal the emergence of genetically distinct strains in response to this. Even so, our partial sapovirus RdRp gene sequence data are insufficient to draw strong conclusions. For this, a more extensive genetic investigation is needed, particularly using the VP1 gene used to place sapoviruses in genogroups [16, 21] , that may reflect the antigenic relationships between sapovirus [77] . Overall sapovirus infection prevalence in spotted hyenas (34.8%) in the Serengeti NP was several magnitudes higher than the prevalence reported for the domestic dog (< 2%) [26, 72] and the bat H. pomona (1.6%) [28] . Moreover, our long-term monitoring reveals that infection prevalence in spotted hyenas was typically high, being above 20% in most years (Fig 3) .",

Several animals transitioned from positive to negative, and we interpret this to indicate that they successfully cleared the virus following infection. If, following an initial infection, spotted hyenas gained long-term immunity against further infection, infection prevalence should decline with age. As prevalence amongst adults reached almost 50% during outbreak years, our results do not provide strong evidence for long-term immunity in this species (Table 1) . Even so, we found no individual that changed from RT-PCR positive to negative to positive (Table 2) which would have provided direct evidence of re-infection. During outbreaks of sapovirus in humans and pigs, cases of re-infection with sapovirus belonging to different genogroups have been reported in both species, suggesting genogroup-specific immunity for sapoviruses [74, 79, 80] . More extensive investigation of the genetic diversity across strains circulating in our spotted hyena population is needed to determine whether sapovirus strains induce (1) short-term immunity, which would permit re-infection with strains from the same sapovirus genogroup, (2) genogroup-specific immunity, in which re-infection would involve strains from different genogroups, or (3) possibly a complex interplay between the two, as hypothesized for the genetically and antigenically diverse Norovirus which is closely related to the Sapovirus genus [81, 82] .",

Animals that were negative on two separate dates (Table 2 ) had the shortest median period between sampling dates (82 days), those that changed from negative to positive (158 days) and from positive to negative (180 days) had an intermediate median number of days, whereas animals that were positive on both sampling days (715 days) had the longest median period. Taken together, these results suggest that when a spotted hyena is infected, infection is cleared, and reinfection is unlikely within a period of several months, which is consistent with the idea that exposure to sapovirus does not provide long-term immunity against further infection. In humans, sapovirus shedding often subsided 14 days after the onset of illness [83] , but can persist for up to 38 days [74] . Hence, we speculate that the spotted hyenas which were positive on two sampling dates several months apart were animals that were re-infected rather than individuals with persistent long-term infections. However, currently we cannot exclude the possibility that there may be spotted hyenas that shed sapoviruses for periods spanning several months.",

Yet when we tested whether these two factors influenced sapovirus infection in this species, neither the predicted effect of contact rates based on known patterns of greeting ceremonies, nor the extent of an individual's range significantly influenced the likelihood of infection in our study population (Table 3) . Clan size was a significant factor, but contrary to our expectation, the likelihood of infection declined with increasing clan size. This phenomenon is known in the behavioral literature as the attack-abatement effect [84] or as the encounter-reduction effect [48, 85, 86] . In multi-species host assemblages the same phenomenon in the ecological literature is termed a 'dilution' effect. At least five non-exclusive mechanisms have been identified [49] that can cause a reduction in infection incidence as the number of host species increases, but not all of them are relevant to intraspecific sapovirus infections in spotted hyenas. We have no evidence that sapovirus infection increases the death rate of infected individuals (mechanism 1), as no obvious clinical signs are associated with sapovirus infection in most spotted hyenas. Although we lack a precise measure of the recovery rate (mechanism 2), the general absence of obvious clinical signs of sapovirus infection suggest that the recovery rate is already very high, so that a change in this factor is likely to be modest. A decrease in the density of susceptible individuals (mechanism 3) is unlikely unless this results from a substantial increase in the proportion of clan members immune to sapovirus infection, even if immunity is relatively transient. A substantial increase in the prevalence of immune clan members would result in far fewer sapovirus susceptible individuals. Moreover, such an increase in herd immunity would probably also lead to a decrease in the prevalence of sapovirus excreting clan members, thereby reducing the probability of: (1) sapovirus transmission per encounter (mechanism 4) between clan members and (2) the encounter rate between susceptible and infectious individuals (mechanism 5) in a clan. Further research and more detailed modeling of the interplay between clan size and the prevalence of clan members in different sapovirus infection states (susceptible, infected/excreting virus, and immune) is required to test this idea.",

Moreover, sapovirus typically infects intestinal tissue and to our knowledge is not known to infect other tissues, as illustrated by the absence of viral RNA in any extra-intestinal tissues in gnotobiotic pigs inoculated with PEC Cowden [87] . However, in a few dead spotted hyenas (typically road casualties) from which we opportunistically obtained tissue samples, we detected sapovirus RNA most often in the spleen and occasionally also in lymph nodes, intestines and the liver. To our knowledge this is the first report of sapovirus RNA in extra-intestinal tissues following natural infections. The possibility that sapoviruses disseminate to extra-intestinal tissues may be of clinical importance [88] . Notably, in asymptomatic mice shedding murine norovirus in feces, viral RNA was also found in several extra-intestinal organs, including the liver, spleen and lymph nodes [89] .",

For example, serological surveys documented that African lions [90] and spotted hyenas in the Serengeti ecosystem were exposed to FCV [91] with a high prevalence. Our phylogenetic analysis shows that the variants we report from wild carnivores in Africa are distinct from both FCV and canine calicivirus (Fig 2) . A norovirus (genus Norovirus, family Caliciviridae), genetically related to human noroviruses was reported from a captive African lion [92] and subsequently identified in domestic dogs and domestic cats [93, 94] . Combining these findings with our results suggests that the spotted hyena and African lion can be infected by viruses belonging to three different genera of the family Caliciviridae.",

Sapovirus prevalence in the spotted hyenas varied between years and was not influenced by age. An individual's likelihood of infection significantly declined with increasing group size, consistent with an encounter reduction effect. Our results reinforce the importance of long-term studies in viral epidemiology of wild species.",
