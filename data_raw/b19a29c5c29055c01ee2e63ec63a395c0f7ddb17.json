Every probe is chosen such that it is thermodynamically optimal, does not form secondary structures and hybridizes only to its target viral genome [5, 6] . In a typical experiment to detect the presence of viral pathogens in a given sample, the sample first undergoes reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using tagged random primers [7] . Then, the amplified cDNA is end labeled and hybridized onto the microarray. Ideally, probes specific to the viral pathogens present in the given sample would have significantly higher signal intensity than that of all other probes.",

Several explanations have been suggested for the occurrence of these phenomena. For example, DNA hybridization may be sequence-dependent causing some probes to be inherently noisy [9] .

We build on our previous paper [14] describing in further detail the AES algorithm that identifies genomics sequences that can be successfully amplified by random primers, facilitating the design of appropriate microarray probes for detection of the pathogen. Finally, we introduce LOMA, a novel algorithm for designing efficient tagged-random primers.

While microarrays allow for the parallel detection of hundreds of pathogens in one assay, there are significant technical and bioinformatics challenges for RT-PCR using specific primers. Therefore random primers have traditionally been used for the unbiased amplification of samples in microarrays [2, 7, 15] . A tagged random primer consists of two parts: a constant 17 bp at the 5'-end known as the 5' tag and a random oligomer (unknown base N) of length 9-15 at the 3'end which could theoretically bind to any sequence [16] . In a RT-PCR assay, the first (reverse transcription) step uses the tagged random primer to generate 500-1000 bp products with tagged primer sequences at both ends. In the second (PCR) step, the primer with the constant 17 bp sequence is used to amplify the PCR products from the first step.",

About 80% of the probes with high signal intensities (\u2265 mean + 3 standarad deviation) have high AES values. We also observed that primers A2 and A3 showed a tremendous improvement in overall PCR efficiency in amplifying RSV over primer A1. This increase in PCR efficiency resulted in increased hybridization of DNA to the probes and is reflected in the uniformly higher signal intensities observed using primer A2 and A3. This is illustrated in Figure 3 . Further analysis of the RSV experiments revealed that only 20% to 30% of the 1948 RSV probes had signal intensities above detection threshold when primer A1 was used. By contrast, the use of primer A2 resulted in 60% to 71% of probes with signal intensities above detection threshold. Primer A3 fared slightly better than primer A2, resulting in more than 70% of the probes having signal intensities above detection threshold. We conducted another set of experiments to verify that the observations made involving RSV and the three randomtagged primers are not isolated observations and that they can be replicated in other genomes as well. Following the experimental procedure used in the previous set of experiments, three patient samples containing HMPV are subjected to amplification by primers A1, A2 and A3 [see Additional file 2].

In the case of using random primers, the quality of the RT-PCR product depends on how well a random primer instantiation pair binds to the target genome. Here, we termed a particular configuration of the given random primer as a random primer instance. For example, GTTTCCCAGTCACGATATTTTAAAAG and GTTTCCCAGTCACGATACATCATCAT are instantiations of the random primer GTTTCCCAGTCACGA-TANNNNNNNNN. Some instantiations of the random primer can bind better to the target genome than others. The identification of such random primer instantiations and where they bind to the target genome gives us an indication of how likely a particular region of the target genome will be amplified. Using this approach, we proposed an amplification efficiency model in our previous paper [14] which computes an Amplification Efficiency Score (AES) for every position of a target genome.

For simplicity, we assume that a random (forward or reverse) primer instantiation can bind to a particular position i of v a only if 9-mer of the instantiated random oligomers of the random primer is a reverse complement of the length-9 substring at position i of v a (Note that other binding criteria such as 75% similarity rule or nearest-neighbour binding free energy [5] can be used as well).

We compute P f (i) and P r (j) based on well-established primer design criteria [32] . The idea is that P f (i) and P r (j) will be small if the forward primer or reverse primer forms self-dimers or has extreme melting temperatures, or form a significant primer-dimer with each other.
