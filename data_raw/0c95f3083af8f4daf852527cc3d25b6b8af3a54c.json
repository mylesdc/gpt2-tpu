            "text": "Automated nucleic acid extraction from primary (raw) sputum continues to be a significant technical challenge for molecular diagnostics. In this work, we developed a prototype openarchitecture, automated nucleic acid workstation that includes a mechanical homogenization and lysis function integrated with heating and TruTip purification; optimized an extraction protocol for raw sputum; and evaluated system performance on primary clinical specimens. Eight samples could be processed within 70 min. The system efficiently homogenized primary sputa and doubled nucleic acid recovery relative to an automated protocol that did not incorporate sample homogenization. Nucleic acid recovery was at least five times higher from raw sputum as compared to that of matched sediments regardless of smear or culture grade, and the automated workstation reproducibly recovered PCR-detectable DNA to at least 80 CFU mL -1 raw sputum. M. tuberculosis DNA was recovered and detected from 122/123 (99.2%) and 124/124 (100%) primary sputum and sediment extracts, respectively. There was no detectable cross-contamination across 53 automated system runs and amplification or fluorescent inhibitors (if present) were not detectable. The open fluidic architecture of the prototype automated workstation yields purified sputum DNA that can be used for any molecular diagnostic test. The ability to transfer TruTip protocols between personalized, on-demand pipetting tools and the fully automated workstation also affords public health agencies an opportunity to standardize sputum nucleic acid sample preparation procedures, reagents, and quality control across multiple levels of the health care system.",

While there is no shortage of manual sample preparation methods for use in reference or hospital laboratories [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] , the specific combination of M. tuberculosis and primary (raw) sputum presents a number of technical and logistical challenges for automated sample preparation systems and sample-to-answer diagnostic devices because sputum is a complex, viscous, clumpy and non-homogenous sample that contains mucus, human cells, non-target bacteria and viruses, blood and pus [17, 20, 21] , and the M. tuberculosis cell wall is difficult to lyse with chemical-based nucleic acid extraction kits [22] [23] [24] [25] . For these reasons, mechanical sample homogenization and cell lysis (sonication, bead beating or bead blending) are often used to prepare sputum samples for nucleic acid tests, as these methods tend to improve DNA recovery relative to purely chemical or enzymatic processes [12, 17, 19, 22, 23, 26] .",

            "text": "The design principle for integrating a mechanical sample homogenizer with TruTip nucleic acid purification is described elsewhere [33] . Briefly, the concept involves separating the consumable from the energy-transducing mechanism-in this case, a rotating cylindrical magnet that is external to the lysis tubes (or reagent plate). At high rotational speeds, the external magnet induces the rotation of a small magnetic stir disc inside of each lysis tube, which in turn agitates the solid particles. Particle agitation is controlled by adjusting the speed of the external, rotating magnet. Magnetically-induced vortexing (MagVor) therefore generates a chaotic bead-milling or bead beating effect within the sample using simple hardware components and with minimal heat generated in the solution. Adjacent to the rotating magnet is a motorized carriage with integrated heater that holds all consumables for the extraction including sample lysis tubes, heater tubes, and a 96-well reagent plate. The carriage controls the position of the consumables relative to a fixed-position, 8-channel, custom-built pipetting manifold. The pipetting manifold (with attached TruTips) moves vertically up and down and a positive-displacement syringe pump controls the speed and aspiration/dispense volumes across all eight tips simultaneously. Pipetting speed is used as a proxy and means for controlling flow rate through the TruTip matrix. A selection valve and small air pump control air flow to the individual tips to dry the silica binding matrix after wash steps and before nucleic acid elution. Biosafety concerns were (partially) addressed in the prototype workstation by incorporating a HEPA-filtered exhaust fan and enclosure around the moving parts and consumables, creating a negative pressure air box relative to the operating environment. Electronic components were protected from potential liquid splashes by protective covers that can be wiped down with bleach or other disinfectants. The prototype was also designed to fit within a standard Biosafety cabinet if needed or desired. The synergistic, positive impact of integrated bead milling on nucleic acid recovery is summarized in Table 2 , where DNA yield at least doubled (> 1 \u0394C t ) at cell inputs ! 10 3 CFU mL -1 (p < 0.05) and M. tuberculosis dilutions [at 100% extraction and detection efficiency, a 1 C t difference represents a 100% increase in recovered DNA]. The data also show that the extra offline enzymatic liquefaction step is not required for efficient DNA extraction, but was retained for all subsequent experiments because it simplified the transfer of a precise sputum volume from the primary sample container to the automated system lysis tubes. Given the heterogenous nature of individual sputum samples and an inability to accurately split a primary sputum sample, we were unable to determine the relative effect of MagVor alone on native (nonspiked) specimens.",

To address the risk, 2 x 10 8 cells of H37Ra were added to 12 independent sputum samples and processed in three replicate runs, where every other lysis tube, channel, and row in the reagent plate contained a water blank. There was no detectable IS6110 DNA in any of the water blanks (n = 36; C t values > 37 at an estimated LoD of 3 fg per reaction). All other external negative controls processed during this work (n = 53 system runs containing negative controls) were likewise negative (not shown), indicating that the MagVor homogenization does not introduce a significant sample contamination risk. We established analytical performance metrics for the integrated TruTip workstation by amending six independent, TB-negative sputa with a five-fold dilution series of H37Ra cells and extracting them with the automated protocol in Table 1 . Real-time PCR data (C t ) values are summarized in Fig 1 (p 0.05 for each dilution) . Because there was no fully automated sputum extraction method available at the time of this study, we used a commercially-available, manual Norgen Sputum DNA Isolation Kit as a benchmark of performance rather than a head-to-head comparator. One replicate extract from one of the six TruTip sputum samples was PCR-negative at 16 CFU mL -1 (PCR detection limit of 3 fg DNA (< 1 M. tuberculosis cell equivalent)). From these data, the automated workstation can repeatedly and reliably extract M. tuberculosis-detectable DNA from sputum (of variable background composition) containing between 16 and 80 CFU mL -1 . The estimated limit of detection across multiple sputum backgrounds is consistent with published performance guidelines [2] and is within the analytical sensitivity range for detecting M. tuberculosis DNA in smear-negative specimens.",

There was a significant linear correlation between DNA recovery and smear status (or quantity of acid fast bacteria) for both sputum and sediment extracts, which corresponds with the estimated bacillary load in the original sample. Nucleic acid recovery was significantly higher from raw sputum as compared to that of matched sediments regardless of smear or culture grade (inclusive of smear negative and culture negative samples), averaging at least five times (log 2 2.45) more DNA recovered from raw sputum than sediment (p < 0.0001) and > 10X yield in 34% (39/116) of the smear positive specimens. In fact, there were only 14 samples where there was more detectable M. tuberculosis DNA in the sediment extract than in the raw sputum extract (S1 Table, negative \u0394C t values). We suspect that the lower DNA recovery from sediment is due, in part, to cell and/or DNA loss during the sputum decontamination and sedimentation process (e.g., [34] ), or minimal amounts of human DNA in sediment that may otherwise serve as a carrier in sputum extracts. Nevertheless, the data show that one and the same automated protocol is equally efficacious on raw sputum and sediment, regardless of sputum quality or characteristics, and that primary sputum may actually be the preferred specimen for sensitive M. tuberculosis detection or diagnosis.",

Indeed, the specific design of the automated workstation and its open fluidic architecture provides a level of engineering and IVD product development flexibility that is difficult to achieve with cartridge-based or otherwise \"closed\", point-of-care microfluidic devices. As a stand-alone workstation, however, there is now an opportunity to push sputum nucleic acid sample preparation closer to the point of need and independent of any specific nucleic acid detection technology.",

TruTip therefore satisfies a basic sample processing demand identified by Denkinger [4] and others [2, 20, 39, 40] . At the same time, the ability to transfer protocols between personalized, on-demand Tru-Tip tools and fully automated workstation affords an opportunity to standardize nucleic acid sample preparation procedures, reagents, and quality control across multiple levels of the health care system, irrespective of desired throughput. We therefore expect TruTip and the automated workstation will add value to the TB community as a stand-alone sample preparation device while continued research focuses on integrating automated TruTip sample preparation with drug-resistant TB amplification microarrays.",

Five microliters of each nucleic acid extract was combined with 20 \u03bcL master mix in a 96-well plate to achieve a final reaction composition of [1X LightCycler1 FastStart DNA Master HybProbe buffer and enzyme (Roche), 2.5 mM MgCl 2 , 0.45 \u03bcM forward primer (5'-GGG-TAG-CAG-ACC-TCA-CCT-ATG), 1.35 \u03bcM reverse primer (5'-AGC-GTA-GGC-GTC-GGT-GA), and 25 nM minor groove binding internal probe (5' 6FAM-TCG-CCT-ACG-TGG-CCT-TT-MGB)]. Microtiter plates were loaded onto the thermal cycler, denatured for 10 min at 95\u02daC, and cycled for 45 cycles of [95\u02daC for 15 sec, 60\u02daC for 60 sec]. A dilution series of H37Ra genomic DNA (from 10 pg \u03bcL -1 -2.4 fg \u03bcL -1 ) was run at least monthly to verify amplification reagents and PCR efficacy, and an aliquot of one of the standard dilutions processed with each PCR plate as an external positive control. M. tuberculosis DNA was considered \"detected\" if the C t value for both PCR replicates was 37.",
