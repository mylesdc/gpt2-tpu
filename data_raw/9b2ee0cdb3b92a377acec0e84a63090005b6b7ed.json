By allowing the accurate relative quantification of protein abundance in both control and test samples, true interactions may be easily distinguished from experimental contaminants. Low affinity interactions can be preserved through the use of less-stringent buffer conditions and remain readily identifiable. This protocol discusses the labeling of tissue culture cells with stable isotope labeled amino acids, transfection and immunoprecipitation of an affinity tagged protein of interest, followed by the preparation for submission to a mass spectrometry facility. This protocol then discusses how to analyze and interpret the data returned from the mass spectrometer in order to identify cellular partners interacting with a protein of interest. As an example this technique is applied to identify proteins binding to the eukaryotic translation initiation factors: eIF4AI and eIF4AII.",

Further, as a sample is typically analyzed whole, rather than as individual protein bands, proteins of interest are not masked by similarly migrating proteins on a gel, nor do they typically need to be present at sufficient levels to be visible after staining, leading to increased numbers of confidently identified proteins 4 .",

Harvest cells from the dish into ice cold PBS using a cell scraper. Collect cells by centrifugation at 220 x g, 4 \u00b0C for 5 min. Wash the cells a further 3x in 10 ml of ice-cold PBS. 2. Resuspend the cell pellet in 200 \u03bcl of cell lysis buffer (10 mM TrisCl/pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP40) containing freshly added protease inhibitor cocktail III at 1x concentration and RNase cocktail (optional) at 5 \u03bcl per ml. Note: For proteins with known nucleic acid binding activity, it may be necessary to add nucleases to the lysate prior to precipitation. In cases where nuclease is added, samples should be incubated on ice for 30 min on ice, with pipetting every 10 min. Extracting total nucleic acid from a small fraction of the sample and analysis by agarose gel electrophoresis can test the effectiveness of the nuclease. 3. Centrifuge samples at 13,000 x g, 4 \u00b0C for 10 min retain the supernatant as the soluble cell lysate. 4. The concentration of the cell lysate should be assessed by BCA assay according to the manufacturer's instructions. 5. Use lysis buffer containing protease inhibitor cocktail III to normalize protein concentration in a final volume of 500 \u03bcl. 6. Adjust the volume to 1 ml with the addition of 500 \u03bcl of dilution buffer (10 mM TrisCl/pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA) containing protease inhibitor cocktail III at final 1x concentration. A 50 \u03bcl aliquot of the sample should be retained as the sample input and the lysate kept on ice whilst preparing anti-GFP beads (e.g., GFP-trap). Note: Typically yields vary between 1-3.5 mg of protein in the final 1 ml sample. Whilst the above buffers are suitable for many proteins of interest, for others it may be necessary to modify buffer components to ensure the bait protein is solubilized and to maintain protein-protein interactions. Possible alterations include the buffering agent (Phosphate, HEPES), salt concentration (150-500 mM), the choice of detergent, or other additives.",

Create columns for the SILAC ratios, and ratio variability from each experiment as well as for the protein name/description column. 4. In the description tab, use the vlookup formula to collect the description of each accession number. Drag the formula down the column to fill in the protein description. The vlookup formula is: \"=vlookup(AccessionNo, WheretoLook, ColumnsAccross, False)\", where: AccessionNo is $aX with X being the row number. WheretoLook is the 'Experiment tab Name'!$a$2:$Y$Z where Y and Z are the bottom right piece of data on the spreadsheet being referenced. ColumnsAccross is the number of columns across from the accession number in column A a desired value lies. Note: For example, if the Accession number is in column A, and the data of interest lies in column E. The value here would be 5 (column A counts as 1). As accession numbers were pooled in step b, it is most likely that vlookup will not obtain all the required names from one experiment. Where it returns N/A, modify the formula to obtain the description from each experiment in turn until all the descriptions are acquired. 5. To highlight interacting proteins in the combined dataset, select each ratio column individually and click on the Home tab, followed by Conditional Formatting>Highlight cells rules>More rules. 6. Select style 'Classic'. Format only cells that contain 'Cell value', 'Greater than or Equal to'. In the box, type in the 1.96 standard deviation value, and click 'OK'. 7. Assess the ratio variability for each positive interaction. If subtracting the % variability would drop a 'hit' below the threshold value, this should be treated with caution. Note: This represents how consistent the individual ratios for each peptide that together make up a proteins' SILAC ratio are, and is given as a percentage. When the ratio variability is taken into account and a protein gives a SILAC ratio above the threshold, this protein represents a hit. If the ratio variability gives a range that falls below the threshold, the 'hit' may represent a contaminant. 8. Repeat this for each of the results columns and compare across experiments. Highlighted proteins identified in two or more experiments represent a high confidence interaction. Note: Depending on the database used to assign protein accession numbers, in different experiments a protein may have been identified under a different, or even multiple accession numbers.

However, the clustering of non-specifically binding proteins in a normal distribution allows proteins that specifically bind to a protein of interest to be distinguished as these have higher sample/mock ratios than the background. Whilst contaminants should theoretically cluster around a log 2 SILAC ratio of 0, this is not necessarily the case, an example of this is given in Figure 3 . Possible reasons for this include imperfect SILAC labeling of cells, loading unequal volumes or concentrations of lysate onto the anti-GFP beads, accidental loss of beads during purification or unequal mixing of samples at the end of the purification procedure 3 .

As might be expected from their high sequence identity 6 , protein:protein interactions appeared largely conserved between the two isoforms in this experimental system 7, 8 . A selection of some of the interacting proteins are given in Table 2 , illustrating the data format. The total score of a protein (which represents the sum of the individual peptide scores). The exact score required for significance will vary between experiments. A MS facility will usually apply a 5% false discovery rate cutoff.",

Where possible, western blots or functional assays should be performed to detect binding of a known protein interaction partner. Should a protein not tolerate fusion with a GFP tag, other tagging or pulldown strategies have been applied to SILAC pulldowns using both other tags (FLAG 11 , Biotin 12 , STREP (own data, unpublished)), or by using primary antibodies against a protein of interest where siRNA knockdown of the target protein provides a control sample 13 . Such experiments have been described elsewhere in the literature, but in brief, step 1 and steps 5.4-8 would be applied as above, with steps 2-5.3 modified as appropriate for the expression/pulldown system of choice using equal protein inputs as described in steps 2.4-2.5. As the quantification stages allow non-specific binding proteins to be removed at the analysis level, it is recommended to omit pre-incubation with control beads, or high salt washes in order to preserve low-affinity protein:protein interactions with a protein of interest. A nuclease may be included or omitted from this protocol according to the specifics of a particular experiment. For example: as the proteins used in this method are RNA helicases, RNase cocktail was included in the protocol to remove indirect interactions mediated via the RNA (step 3.2). In some cases however, there could be benefit from running parallel experiments with and without nuclease to identify nucleic acid dependent interactions.",

Whilst this approach is potentially more stringent, it does increase the complexity of the analysis, as in at least one replicate, a protein of interest will be produced in 'light' labeled cells and so it is necessary to distinguish between proteins consistently identified in 'light' samples (environmental contaminants such as keratins), and those that are only enriched in 'light' samples when bound to a protein of interest.",

For most uses this is more than sufficient for identifying novel proteins of interest. Further modifications to this approach to help reduce this data loss are described elsewhere in the literature and include the use of a protein frequency library where known contaminant proteins for a specific set of experimental parameters (cell line, bead matrix, buffer conditions) may be excluded 10, 14 . However, depending on the particular experimental parameters it may be necessary to run a number of control experiments to generate a bead proteome and this can therefore increase both the expense and complexity of the experiment.

The technique can be very easily adapted to a number of different purification strategies, allowing its application to any given protein of interest. Quantification of results vastly simplifies identification of genuine interactions, and permits relaxation of stringent buffer conditions used to remove non-specific binders, and thus preserves low affinity interactions. As up to three samples can be compared in the above strategy, the technique has clear strengths in comparing differences in protein binding between different protein isoforms, mutant proteins, or the effect of pharmacological inhibitors. As whole gel slices are analyzed rather than individual bands that stain by Coomassie, the numbers of proteins identified at high confidence are typically higher than those identified in a standard GST/TAP-pulldown, and experimenter bias in selecting proteins of interest is removed. The technique therefore compares very favorably with other commonly used techniques used in identification of novel protein-interactions (yeast 2-hybrid, GST/His or TAP Pulldowns).",

Under column analysis select 'Frequency distribution'. Keeping the default options click 'OK'. Note: This step generates a histogram illustrating the number of proteins identified at a given ratio. This should form a Gaussian distribution. 4. In the 'Results' folder a new 'Histogram' section will have been generated. Select the frequency distribution section. 5. Click the dropdown 'Insert' menu and select New analysis>XY>Nonlinear regression (curve fit). Click on 'Gaussian distribution' and click OK. Note: This step fits a curve to the frequency distribution data generated in step 7.3, yielding values that can subsequently be used to calculate thresholds for significance. 6. In the results window that appears, the mean and standard deviation are given. Generate a threshold by adding 1.96 standard deviations to the mean. Note: These values represent the mean and standard deviations of the Gaussian distribution, not the total dataset. 1.96 standard deviations would place a threshold at the 95% confidence limit (p\u22640.05). 2.58 SD would give 99%, and 3.3 SD 99.9%.
