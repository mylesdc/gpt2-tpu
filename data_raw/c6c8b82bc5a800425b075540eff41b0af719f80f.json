Hence, we encourage submission of letters in response to articles we publish, preferably as e-letters via our Web site (www.plosmedicine.org) rather than via our manuscript submission site. The four-week limit we originally suggested in our author guidelines was to encourage timely correspondence; however, we accept that there will be occasions when it will be appropriate for letters to be published later than that, and we will accept such submissions. The word limit is more debatable. We think that 750 words is a reasonable limit; any more, and letters are likely to stray off the topic.

The decision by medical editors to stifl e debate is misguided [2, 6] . A time limit, especially a very short one, signals that speed is more important than content, that convenience takes precedence over science. While it is reasonable to encourage early comments, there should be no time limit on comments aimed at clarifying or criticising study methodology. Likewise, it will often be impossible to explain the subtleties of methodological problems in 400 words, and impossible in only 175.

K. Arora, personal communication). Therefore, unsafe medical injections have the potential to propagate this epidemic. Also, injections transmit many other pathogens like hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus. The infections that they cause have a very high morbidity and mortality. Hence, the need and urgency of intervention to decrease the overuse of injections and improve the safety of desired injections should not be questioned. Each country should make appropriate allocation of resources according to its own needs. ",

Rather than relying on the case-control approach, what is needed is intensive contact tracing (with viral sequencing of HIV specimens from index cases and their infected contacts to elucidate transmission relationships [8] ) and a rigorous inventory of possible exposures and vectors [7] . The contact tracing and conscientious environmental risk probing of recent public-health responses to avian infl uenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome are an example of a useful and superior step to the case-control approach.",

Considering the general failure of HIV/AIDS control programs and the neglect of this subject, we believed they were right to raise this controversial hypothesis, so we added a question to our fi eld survey and performed a fresh analysis to test the strength of association between injections and HIV incidence [3] . Therefore, we are disappointed that Brody and Potterat think that we are \"transparently invested in dismissing\" the hypothesis [2] . Now that pertinent incidence data (where the timing of exposure and event can be determined) have been published for Manicaland, Zimbabwe, and Rakai, Uganda, and have shown a lack of association with injections, we think it is unfair to belittle the diffi culty of collecting data and to claim that we have not gone to great lengths to collect high-quality data on sexual behaviour [3, 4] . On the contrary, because of the general problems in generating reliable responses to questions about sexual behaviour [5, 6] , the Manicaland HIV/ STD Prevention study has pioneered the use of informal, confi dential voting interview methods [6] . Brody and Potterat state that we found \"that sexual behaviour was unrelated to risk of incident HIV\". However, in women, having a history of STD symptoms, having multiple sexual partners, or being widowed/separated/divorced (a proxy that a previous sexual partner died of HIV) were associated with HIV incidence. In men, the associations of HIV and sexual behaviour did not reach statistical signifi cance because of the small number of seroconversions.",

This fi nding is not surprising. The characteristics of disease outbreaks, particularly outbreaks of emerging diseases to which human populations are highly susceptible, prevent highly precise forecasts.",

Characteristically, an outbreak begins with a small number of initially infectious individuals. Subsequent infectious contacts are mediated by a wide range of social interactions-contacts within and among households and communities-so that even individuals that are virtually identical can differ considerably in the number of secondary infections they cause. This is a micro-scale cause of variation compared with macro-scale, population-level sources of variation. The important implication for EWSs is that in such situations, especially where the basic reproductive ratio of infections (R0) is initially very high but is rapidly reduced (perhaps by public-health interventions), small deviations in the realized number of infectious contacts are amplifi ed, resulting in relatively large variation in the fi nal size of the outbreak. Because this variation refl ects differences in individual behavior and not macroscopic characteristics of epidemic spread, it is unlikely that climate or other data contain any information about this source of variation (though such data do contain information about macroscopic variation).",

            "text": "A more formal explanation of this phenomenon can be formulated based on a simple model of an epidemic in which an EWS captures all macroscopic causes of variation in the fi nal epidemic size but no microscopic causes. Obviously, an EWS cannot realistically be expected to capture even all the macroscopic information. Thus, this limit to precision is a fundamental limit and should be interpreted as a theoretical upper bound on forecast precision. The simplest case considers a disease with only two macroscopic epidemiological characteristics, an infection rate and a removal rate, which may change over time as in the case of meningococcal meningitis. In particular, we assume that there is no immunity in the population and that infection and removal are independent in time. This model of disease dynamics belongs to a class of stochastic processes known as nonhomogenous birth-death processes, which, conveniently, turn out to be reasonably tractable. More than 50 years ago, Kendall [3] showed how models for the mean and the variance in the fi nal epidemic size are affected by these parameters. The variance can be interpreted as a measure of the precision with which the fi nal epidemic size can be predicted. Kendall's results can be broken down to show that this quantity is equal to the sum of the average fi nal epidemic size and another quantity (x) minus one. For most realistic epidemiological parameters, this other quantity, which is related to the covariance between fi nal epidemic size and the size of the infected population, will be much greater than one. In these cases, the variance in the fi nal epidemic size will be much greater than the average fi nal epidemic size itself.",

            "text": "This fundamental limit to the precision of forecasts does not imply that EWSs cannot be used effectively to plan a response to outbreaks. Rather, it suggests what expectations of EWSs are reasonable. Further, since the precision with which forecasts of the fi nal epidemic size can be obtained will depend on many disease-specifi c properties and maybe other factors, too, case studies of the potential effectiveness of EWSs for different diseases are needed. These studies should exploit recent advances in modeling birth-death processes [4] to gain further understanding of the differences among diseases and of the causes of geographic variation in the intensity of epidemics. Finally, notwithstanding limits to precision, the benefi ts to be obtained from estimates of the average fi nal epidemic size and the timing of epidemics alone may warrant considerable investment in EWSs.",
