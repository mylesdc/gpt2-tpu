A vaccination regimen with the VRC-FLUDNA071-00-VP (H7 DNA) vaccine administered alone or concurrently in different arms with A/Shanghai/2/2013(H7N9) (MIV) as prime followed by inactivated MIV boost will be compared to MIV-MIV prime-boost with a 16 week boost interval. The primary hypothesis is that all the H7 DNA prime-MIV boost, DNA+MIV prime-MIV boost, and MIV-MIV study regimens will be safe for human administration. A secondary hypothesis is that the H7 DNA-MIV regimen will elicit a greater frequency and/or magnitude of antibody against H7 than the MIV-MIV regimen. The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability in healthy adults of the investigational vaccine regimens. Secondary objectives are related to the immunogenicity of the vaccination regimens. Product Description:",

These H7N9 influenza strains are very close in sequence, and therefore it is expected that A/Shanghai/2/2013(H7N9) MIV will provide an efficient boost for H7 DNA vaccine based on the A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) sequence [25] . In assessing immunogenicity of H5 DNA vaccine followed by MIV, a single H5 DNA vaccine prime followed by a single MIV boost at short intervals (4-8 weeks) did not significantly improve HAI titers over that achieved with inactivated vaccine alone. However, a single H5 DNA 4 mg vaccination prime significantly improved HAI responses when the interval to the inactivated vaccine boost was 12-24 weeks, as compared with two vaccinations with the inactivated vaccine [21, 22] . Therefore, a single dose of DNA priming may be sufficient to increase the magnitude and breadth of HA-specific antibody responses. Summary of HA DNA safety and immunogenicity: The safety data for the VRC HA DNA vaccine trials to date shows that these vaccines were well tolerated. No severe local or systemic reactogenicity occurred nor were there any serious adverse events related to vaccine. The pattern of local and systemic reactogenicity appears to be generally mild and similar across the studies, independent of the antigens encoded by the HA DNA constructs included in any one vaccine.",

Briefly, the plasmid used in the Master Cell Bank (MCB) was synthesized and transferred to the VPP where the sequence was confirmed before use. The plasmid was used to transform the Escherichia coli bacterial host strain, DH5\u03b1, in order to produce individual MCB. Each MCB was expanded in culture and inoculated into a fermentor for production. Bacterial cell growth was dependent upon the cellular expression of the kanamycin resistance protein encoded by a portion of the plasmid DNA. Following growth of bacterial cells harboring the plasmid, the plasmid DNA was purified from cellular components, concentrated, filtered, and stored until formulation of the drug product.

The VRC-FLUDNA071-00-VP Drug Substance consists of a single closed-circular plasmid DNA macromolecule (VRC-3601), that encodes the hemagglutinin 7 (H7) protein of A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) influenza derived from a human isolate and identified as EpiFlu Accession # EP1439507 in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) EpiFlu database.
