Carcinoembryonic antigen related cell adhesion molecule 1 (Ceacam1) is a transmembrane glycoprotein found on epithelium, T cells, and many tumors. It regulates a variety of physiologic and pathological processes such as tumor biology, leukocyte activation, and energy homeostasis. Previous studies suggest that Ceacam1 negatively regulates inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease models.",

In vivo, Ceacam1 2/2 T cells caused increased GVHD mortality and GVHD of the colon, and greater numbers of donor T cells were positive for activation markers (CD25 hi , CD62L lo ). Additionally, Ceacam1 2/2 CD8 T cells had greater expression of the gut-trafficking integrin a 4 b 7 , though both CD4 and CD8 T cells were found increased numbers in the gut posttransplant. Ceacam1 2/2 recipients also experienced increased GVHD mortality and GVHD of the colon, and alloreactive T cells displayed increased activation. Additionally, Ceacam1 2/2 mice had increased mortality and decreased numbers of regenerating small intestinal crypts upon radiation exposure. Conversely, Ceacam1-overexpressing T cells caused attenuated target-organ and systemic GVHD, which correlated with decreased donor T cell numbers in target tissues, and mortality. Finally, graft-versus-tumor survival in a Ceacam1 + lymphoma model was improved in animals receiving Ceacam1 2/2 vs. control T cells.",

In the context of Ceacam1 2/2 recipients, we therefore tested the radiation sensitivity of Ceacam1 2/2 mice used as hosts, by irradiating WT and Ceacam1 2/2 BALB/c mice and assessing survival. Ceacam1 2/2 animals showed increased kinetics of mortality, and in some cases, overall mortality after radiation injury ( Figure 4A ). Similar results were obtained on the B6 background ( Figure 4C ). We then enumerated regenerating and surviving crypts in the small intestine (terminal ileum) at 84 hours after irradiation to assess intestinal radiation damage, and observed that Ceacam1 2/2 mice had fewer regenerating and surviving crypts as compared with WT counterparts ( Figure 4B and D), indicating greater damage to the small intestine across a wide range of radiation doses. It is thus quite likely that our radiation-containing conditioning regimen for transplant recipients also contributes in part to their survival kinetics, selective GVHD target organ damage ( Figure 2G -H), and the selective accumulation of donor T cells in lymphoid tissues and target organs ( Figure 3C ) in these recipients.",

In addition, Ceacam1 on donor T cells and tumors may modulate GVT activity. Ceacam1 on both the donor allograft and recipient tissues thus appears to represent an important regulator of GVHD and GVT morbidity and mortality via both T cell dependent and independent mechanisms, suggesting that therapeutic approaches which modulate Ceacam1 may need to assess and balance GVHD vs. GVT.",

This suggests that Ceacam1 on donor T cells interacts with recipient tissues, and that Ceacam1 ''fraternal'' interactions between cells of the donor graft, were not sufficient to restrain GVHD in Ceacam1 2/2 recipients. However, the increased early mortality of Ceacam1 2/2 allo-BMT recipients with GVHD also led us to ask whether Ceacam1 2/2 mice were sensitive to radiation injury.

Thus, our results on donor lymphocyte infiltrates into GVHD target tissues and secondary lymphoid tissues must be interpreted cautiously, as they must be influenced by T cell proliferation, retention and apoptosis, in addition to trafficking. Although Ceacam1 2/2 and Ceacam1-Tg T cells displayed overall symmetric and opposite phenotypes, we also noted differences. Ceacam1-Tg T cells primarily showed decreased proliferation, whereas Ceacam1 2/2 T cells showed changes in proliferation, but also trafficking and activation. Some of these differences may be due to our models: on WT T cells, Ceacam1 is only briefly and transiently upregulated during activation. Consequently, Ceacam1 2/2 T cells are ''missing'' Ceacam1 only transiently, while Ceacam1-Tg T cells constitutively over-express Ceacam1. Furthermore, while Ceacam1 2/2 T cells are effectively insensitive to all Ceacam1 ligands and interactions, Ceacam1-Tg T cells which over-express the protein may have increased fraternal Ceacam1 interactions with other donor T cells, but may not necessarily experience increased Ceacam1 interactions with donor BM or host hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic components. These differences may explain why their activation and trafficking phenotypes are not directly opposed.",

Although both A20 lymphoma and renal cell carcinoma express Ceacam1, A20 cells uniformly expressed Ceacam1 at high levels, while only a subset of RENCA cells showed (somewhat lower) expression. Indeed, a number of hematologic tumors, including EL4 leukemia, P815 mastocytoma, and C1498 myeloid leukemia all express substantial levels of Ceacam1 (data not shown), whereas some solid tumors, such as mouse 4T1 breast epithelial cancer and CT51 colon tumor normally express only lower or even minimal levels of Ceacam1, similar to the lower level of expression we found with RENCA (not shown).",

However, RENCA in our GVT model systems is found primarily in the liver, and to a lesser extent, the lungs. Since donor allografts with Ceacam1 2/2 T cells showed decreased numbers of donor alloreactive T cells in the liver as compared with wildype in GVHD experiments ( Figure 3A) , interpretation of GVT activity against RENCA with respect to Ceacam1 on T cells must also consider this aspect of its biology.",

B) The linearized construct was microinjected into C57Bl/6 oocytes to produce transgenic mice that were identified by Southern blot with a 1.3 kb 32P-labelled probe. This probe cross-reacts with the endogenous Ceacam1, Ceacam2 and Ceacam10 genes and also identifies the 1.7 kb EcoR1-digested transgene. C) Tg mice were identified by PCR amplification of a 320 bp fragment from tail genomic DNA with the CyT2 oligo within the CC1-L cytoplasmic domain and oligo CD2A2 within the hCD2 LCR region. D) Western blots of lysates from thymi and spleens from 5 and 8-week-old WT and Tg littermates with the rabbit polyclonal anti-Ceacam1 Ab 2457.
