Sera were serially diluted in two-fold, in triplicate for each dilution, beginning from 1:12.5 through 1:100 (to yield a final volume of 30 mL per dilution), using phosphatebuffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Rubella virus stock (vaccine virus HPV77) was diluted to a working concentration of 1.2610 3 plaque-forming units (PFU)/mL, and was added (30 mL) to an equal volume of diluted serum (or diluent as in the case of virus-only control), yielding a final serum dilution series of 1:25 through 1:200. The plate was incubated for 1.5 hour at 37uC, 5% CO 2 . Fifty microliters of each mixture were used to inoculate confluent Vero cell monolayers (cultured in flat-bottom 96-well plates) and the cells were incubated for 1 hour at 37uC, 5% CO 2 . After the incubation period, DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS and 50 mg/mL Gentamicin (Gibco; Invitrogen, CA, USA) was added to each well and the plate was further incubated for 72 hours at 37uC, 5% CO 2 . The plates were developed using an indirect immunocolorimetric method and rubella E1-specific monoclonal antibody (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/CDC, GA, USA), as previously described [31] . Optical density (OD) values were measured using a measurement/reference wavelength pair of 450 nm/630 nm. The neutralization titer was calculated as the highest dilution at which the input virus signal was reduced by at least 50% within the dilution series (neutralization titer 50/NT 50 ). The Loess method of statistical interpolation was used to estimate interpolated NT 50 values from observed values [25, 32] . The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), based on log-transformed estimates from samples with repeated NT 50 measurements was, 0.89, demonstrating a high degree of reproducibility in the assay [25, 26] .",

Principal component analysis was repeated via EIGENSTRAT [36] on a collection of SNPs except those that were in low linkage disequilibrium (r 2 ,0.1) and that had HWE p-values.1610 23 .",

Neutralizing antibody (NT 50 ) levels were analyzed as the phenotype of interest after logarithmic transformation in order to conform to linear models assumptions.

Although relatively rare, the heterozygous genotype of these PVR SNPs (no homozygous minor allele genotype was observed) was consistently associated with a significant decrease (. 2-fold) in neutralizing antibody titers after rubella vaccination in both cohorts. Similarly, the heterozygous genotype of two SNPs (rs78245864 and rs41290122, in LD; r 2 = 0.66, Fig. 1 ) in the PVRL2 gene (poliovirus receptor-related 2, herpesvirus entry mediator B, nectin 2, CD112) was associated with a significant increase (, 30%) in rubella-specific neutralizing antibody titers (meta-analysis p-values of 0.038 and 0.04 for rs78245864 and rs41290122, respectively, Table 2 ). Furthermore, five additional PVRL2 genetic variants (some in LD, Fig. 1 ) demonstrated some evidence for association with rubella-specific NT 50 titers post vaccination (meta-analysis p-value,0.044, Table 2 ), although some of the findings (association with high/low response) were not consistent between the two cohorts. Our meta-analysis also revealed potential associations between SNPs in the promoter regions of CD209/DC-SIGN (rs2287886) and IL6 (rs1880241) genes and rubella-specific neutralizing antibodies (meta-analysis pvalues of 0.008 and 0.027, for rs2287886 and rs1880241, respectively, Table 2 ). We found a replicated genetic association for a SNP (rs1153600) in intron 3 of the vitamin A receptor gene RARB that demonstrated a significant decrease in neutralizing antibody titers with the representation of the minor allele (metaanalysis p-value = 0.037, Table 2 ). The homozygous minor allele genotype of a SNP (rs16895223) in the putative rubella virus receptor gene MOG (myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein) was associated with a decrease in rubella-specific antibodies (metaanalysis p-value = 0.046, Table 2 ).

We and others have highlighted the importance of HLA polymorphisms, SNPs in cytokine and cytokine receptor genes, antiviral genes, toll-like receptors and pathway signaling genes, vitamin A and D receptor and cellular viral receptor genes (CD46 and SLAM for measles virus), and other important innate immune genes (TRIM genes, DC-SIGN, etc.) for inter-individual immune response variation after measles and rubella vaccination [2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 21, 22, 23, 24, 28, 29, 39, 40, 41, 42] .

The poliovirus receptor (PVR, CD155) and poliovirus receptor-related 2 (PVRL2, CD112) genes encode transmembrane glycoproteins/nectins of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily, which are components of adherens junctions and serve as cellular entry receptors for poliovirus (PVR), pseudorabies virus, and certain mutant strains of herpes simplex virus (PRRL2) [17, 18, 19] . As virus-specific cell surface receptors, these proteins have important functional downstream effects on processes related to viral entry, such as viral replication, cell-to-cell spread, viral tropism, pathogenesis and antiviral immunity. For example, the Ala67Thr mutation in the poliovirus receptor gene (PVR) was previously associated with a higher risk for developing vaccineinduced and wild-type virus-induced poliomyelitis [43] .",

Importantly, CD155/PVR may play a role in Th2 differentiation and humoral immunity by polarizing na\u00efve CD4 + T cells to a Th2 phenotype [16] .

In turn, this may have downstream effects on rubella virus-specific humoral immunity by either modulating the unspecific (or specific) virus attachment/entry, replication and immune response priming or, more likely, by modulating Th1/Th2 cell differentiation and promoting more (or less) efficient antibody response [16] .",

            "text": "The only cellular receptor for rubella virus identified to date is the myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), an adhesion molecule that is important in nerve myelination and is implicated as a target antigen in the pathogenesis of several autoimmune demyelinating diseases (including multiple sclerosis/MS), and in the central nervous system (CNS) damage in congenital rubella syndrome [11] . However, rubella virus cell tropism and infectivity suggest that other, yet undiscovered, cellular receptors and adhesion factors capable of mediating infection exist for this pathogen. MOG is expressed predominantly in the central nervous system and is hardly detectable in immune system organs/tissues and cells such as spleen, thymus and PBMCs [11] . Our analysis identified two intronic polymorphisms (rs16895223, p = 0.046 and rs1977198, p = 0.027, Table 2 ) in the MOG gene and the highly homologous butyrophilin BTN2A1 gene, both on chromosome 6p22, that were associated with variations in rubellaspecific neutralizing antibody response. Host genetic variation in these or other tagged functional MOG/BTN2A1 SNPs may potentially impair or enhance viral entry into susceptible cells, alter virus replication/propagation and antigen abundance and modulate subsequent immune response. Alternatively, these genes may interfere in immune regulation, as demonstrated for the butyrophilins. The latter are co-stimulatory molecules that are implicated in T cell inhibition (negative regulation of T cell proliferation, activation, cytokine production), immune signaling and interaction with DC-SIGN on dendritic cells (BTN2A1 is identified as a ligand for DC-SIGN), and genetic variation in these genes have been associated with inflammatory diseases [48, 49] . Of note, our results also demonstrate an association between a promoter SNP in DC-SIGN (rs2287886, p = 0.008, Table 2 ) and humoral immune response variations following rubella vaccination. DC-SIGN (Cell-Specific Intercellular adhesion molecule-3-Grabbing Non-integrin, CD209) is a C-type lectin that mediates dendritic cell function and activation of CD4 + T cells and binds multiple microorganisms, including viruses, by recognizing mannose type glycoproteins [20] . This molecule is exploited by many viruses for attachment and/or cellular entry: measles virus (MV); rift valley fever virus (RVFV); influenza A viruses; human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1); hepatitis C virus (HCV); herpes simplex virus (HSV1); human cytomegalovirus (HCMV); Ebola virus; SARS coronavirus and dengue virus [20] . Polymorphisms in DC-SIGN (and, in particular, the promoter SNP rs2287886) have been associated with the clinical course and outcome of dengue virus infection, cytomegalovirus infection, tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) infection and pulmonary aspergillosis [50, 51, 52] . Furthermore, the promoter SNP rs2287886 is functional and was demonstrated to influence DC-SIGN gene expression and HCMC infection in dendritic cells [52] . Interestingly, we found the same DC-SIGN promoter SNP to be associated with variations in measles vaccine-induced TNFa secretion in African-Americans and several other DC-SIGN SNPs that were associated with variations in measles-specific neutralizing antibody levels in Caucasians and African-Americans [21] . Therefore, it is likely that DC-SIGN, PVR, PVRL2 or other attachment factors and/or Figure 1 . Locus zoom plot and schematic LD block structure of the PVR and PVRL2 genetic variants of interest. A.

Only SNPs with p-value below 0.05 in the meta-analysis and homogeneity test p-value above 0.1 are presented. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0099997.t002 cellular viral receptors and pathway-related genes are involved in the genetic control of rubella vaccine-induced immune response heterogeneity after vaccination. Another important finding is the observed genetic association between a SNP (rs1153600) in intron 3 of the retinoic acid receptor, beta (RARB) gene and rubella-specific neutralizing antibody response (the homozygous minor allele and the heterozygous genotypes were associated with lower antibody titers in both cohorts). RARB is a receptor for retinoic acid, the biologically active metabolite of vitamin A, with involvement in cell growth, differentiation, cell signaling and gene regulation. Interestingly, vitamin A has direct effects on the immune system and regulates antigen presentation, lymphocyte homing, proliferation of B and T cells, T-helper differentiation, cytokine production, T cell activation and cytotoxicity, as well as enhancing the antibody response to vaccination, including the measles vaccine, oral polio vaccine, and tetanus and diphtheria toxoids [53, 54] . Furthermore, our previous studies demonstrated associations between: the same RARB SNP (rs1153600, p = 0.034) and two other RARB SNPs and rubella (whole) virus-specific IgG levels (as measured by a chemiluminescent immunoassay) in 738 children/young adults following two doses of MMR vaccine [8] ; and RARB SNPs/haplotypes and variations in measles-specific neutralizing antibody levels and cellular immune outcomes after MMR vaccination [41] . The findings from the current study and previous reports add evidence to the importance of vitamin A receptors and pathway in immune response regulation after immunization.",

The limitations of our study reflect the fact that the characteristics of the study participants were different between the two study cohorts. This made it difficult to compare and/or combine the results from the two cohorts using a method that would typically be applied to control for false-positive findings. For this reason, we applied meta-analytic approaches to evaluate the degree of evidence of association present when evaluating combined results across the two cohorts, with the understanding that false-positive results would be less likely to show consistent associations between cohorts. Given the signals that we observed, and the biological plausibility, it is likely that at least several of the identified associations/genes do indeed play a role in influencing neutralizing antibody levels observed in vaccinated individuals. In addition, our analysis focused on additive genetic effects, and while the support for other genetic models over the additive model was not compellingly strong in our sensitivity analyses, it is possible that for some of the genetic variants an alternative genetic model may prove superior. Other limitations include the influence of unpredictable factors confounding analysis results (e.g., potential wild-type rubella virus exposure in deployed military personnel from the San Diego cohort).",

A significant strength is the genetic association analysis approach, adjusting for known confounding variables, and the use of two independent cohorts (subsetted to Caucasian subjects only) to minimize the false-positive findings. The identified genes and genetic variants will be further fine mapped in order to identify candidate functional variants in the genomic regions tagged by the original SNP (if not functional). The p-values, and magnitudes of effect, obtained from the fine-mapping analyses will provide important insights into which of the variants is most likely to be causing the genetic association that was originally observed. Finally, the identification of likely causal genetic variants will be complemented with functional studies to reveal the SNP immediate functional effect and the downstream consequences/biological mechanisms for humoral immune response variation.",
