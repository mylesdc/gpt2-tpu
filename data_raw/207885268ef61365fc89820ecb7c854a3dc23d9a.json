It inhibits the replication of many viruses and ultimately promotes apoptosis of infected cells, contributing to the control of virus spread. However, viruses have evolved a range of escape strategies that act against different steps in the pathway. Here we unraveled a novel escape strategy involving Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) L* protein. Previously we found that L* was the first viral protein binding directly RNase L. Our current data show that L* binds the ankyrin repeats R1 and R2 of RNase L and inhibits 2'-5' oligoadenylates (2-5A) binding to RNase L. Thereby, L* prevents dimerization and oligomerization of RNase L in response to 2-5A. Using chimeric mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) expressing TMEV L*, we showed that L* efficiently inhibits RNase L in vivo. Interestingly, those data show that L* can functionally substitute for the MHV-encoded phosphodiesterase ns2, which acts upstream of L* in the OAS/RNase L pathway, by degrading 2-5A.",

OAS accumulate as inactive enzymes in cells that have been exposed to interferon. When infection of these cells occurs, double-stranded RNA produced during virus replication activates OAS, which produce 2-5A. 2-5A act as second messengers. They bind a cellular endonuclease called RNase L, thereby triggering the dimerization and the activation of this RNase. Active RNase L degrades cellular and viral RNA molecules, ultimately killing the infected cell, thus preventing virus spread. Viruses PLOS Pathogens | https://doi.have developed diverse mechanisms to escape RNase L activity. We report that Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus, a virus that produces persistent infections of the central nervous system, evolved a novel mechanism to escape the OAS/RNase L pathway. The L \u00c3 protein produced by this virus binds RNase L very close to the pocket known to sense 2-5A and thereby prevents 2-5A from activating RNase L. This mechanism contrasts with that used by Influenza (flu) virus, which sequesters double-stranded RNA and thereby also inhibits alternative antiviral pathways. We further showed that the RNase L antagonist activity of L \u00c3 is effective in vivo and that L \u00c3 can substitute for 2-5A degrading enzymes produced by coronaviruses.",

Persistent strains of TMEV, such as DA, BeAn or TO4 have a remarkable ability to establish persistent infections of the mouse central nervous system. In susceptible mouse strains, TMEV can persist lifelong, replicating mainly in oligodendrocytes, macrophages and microglial cells, in the white matter of the spinal cord [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . Two accessory proteins, L and L \u00c3 , were shown to contribute to the ability of TMEV to establish persistent infections by interfering with the host innate immune response [2, 5] . The L \u00c3 (read \"Lstar\") protein is an 18kDa protein encoded by an alternative open reading frame overlapping the L-, VP4-and VP2-coding regions of the ORF encoding the viral polyprotein [6] . It facilitates the infection of macrophages in vitro [7, 8] and the initiation of persistent infections in vivo [9, 10] . L \u00c3 is first detected in the cytosol of infected cells and subsequently accumulates in the mitochondrial outer membrane [11] . We previously showed that L \u00c3 can inhibit RNase L through direct protein-protein interaction [12] . Interestingly, RNase L inhibition by L \u00c3 is a highly species-specific process. Indeed, L \u00c3 of the mouse TMEV strain DA inhibits mouse RNase L but not its orthologues from other tested species including rat [12] , whereas L \u00c3 of the rat TMEV strain RTV-1 inhibits rat but not human or even mouse RNase L [13] .",

Interferon secreted in response to viral infection induces the expression of a family of enzymes: the oligoadenylate synthetases (OAS). OAS are produced as inactive enzymes and become activated upon binding dsRNA, a byproduct of viral replication. Active OAS catalyze the conversion of ATP into 2'-5' oligoadenylates called 2-5A [16] [17] [18] [19] . 2-5A then act as second messengers and bind to monomeric inactive RNase L, triggering its dimerization and its activation [20] . Enzymatically active RNase L cleaves viral and cellular single-stranded RNA and therefore inhibits protein synthesis, decreases viral replication, and ultimately leads to apoptosis [19, 21, 22] . Through the generation of short RNA fragments, RNase L can further amplify IFN signaling [23] . RNase L products were also reported to trigger autophagy and to activate the inflammasome [24] [25] [26] .",

In the active, dimeric RNase L, two 2-5A molecules are embedded in a composite pocket formed by ANK R2 and ANK R4 of one protomer, and ANK R9 and the pseudokinase N-terminal lobe of the other protomer [27] [28] [29] [30] .

As a consequence, viruses have evolved several strategies to escape this pathway. Interestingly, almost any step of the OAS/RNase L pathway can be targeted by viruses (for review: [34, 35] ). For instance, Influenza A virus encodes the NS1 protein that sequesters dsRNA, thereby preventing OAS activation [36] . More recently, it was shown that MHV, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and rotaviruses express the phosphodiesterases, ns2, NS4b, and VP3 respectively, which degrade 2-5A and thus prevent RNase L activation [33, 37, 38] . Poliovirus acts downstream of the pathway through a highly structured genomic RNA region, which acts as a cleavage-resistant substrate for RNase L [39, 40] . As mentioned above, we recently observed that TMEV L \u00c3 directly binds RNase L suggesting a novel mechanism of RNase L inhibition [12] . As L \u00c3 was found to bind the N-terminal part of RNase L (residues 1-400) encompassing the entire ankyrin domain (ANK R1-R9), L \u00c3 most likely acts by inhibiting 2-5A binding to RNase L, or by preventing RNase L dimerization. It is however not excluded that L \u00c3 could act in an allosteric fashion to block the catalytic activity of RNase L.",

To identify the region within the ankyrin domain that is targeted by L \u00c3 , enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) fusions were constructed that carry ANK repeats of mouse, rat and human RNase L upstream of the eGFP coding sequence (Fig 1A) . The ANK-eGFP fusion proteins were N-terminally Flag-tagged. We next tested whether ANK-eGFP fusion co-immunoprecipitated with HAtagged L \u00c3 (HA-L \u00c3 ), in extracts of transfected 293T cells. As summarized in Fig 1A, L \u00c3 DA interacted with fusion proteins carrying mouse RNase L ANK R1-R2 but not with fusions carrying ANK R2 or ANK R1 alone ( Fig 1B) . Specificity of the interaction was confirmed by showing that L \u00c3 DA only interacted with mouse ANK R1-R2 constructs while L \u00c3 RTV-1 only interacted with rat ANK R1-R2 (Fig 1C) . We concluded that ankyrin repeats 1 and 2 of mouse and rat RNase L are sufficient for binding of L \u00c3 DA and L \u00c3 RTV-1 respectively. In infected cells, L \u00c3 is both cytosolic and partly anchored in the mitochondrial outer membrane [11] . Using the Flag-muANK R1-2-eGFP construct that readily interacts with L \u00c3 DA , we observed by fluorescent microscopy that the soluble pool of cytosolic L \u00c3 was responsible for RNase L binding (S1 Fig).",

Mouse and human RNase L share 64% amino-acid sequence identity, divergent residues being spread throughout the protein (Fig 2) . We thus tested the ability of L \u00c3 from the mouse virus strain DA to bind and inhibit a series of chimeras constructed between mouse and human RNase L (Fig 2A-2D ). Binding was assessed by coimmunoprecipitation of N-terminally Flag-tagged RNase L chimeras (Flag-RNase L) with HA-tagged L \u00c3 (HA-L \u00c3 ) (Fig 2A-2C ). As expected, L \u00c3 interacted with mouse but not with human RNase L (Fig 2B lane 1, 6) . Interestingly, swapping either the first RNase L ANK repeat (residues 1-58) or even residues 26 to 51 within this repeat (Fig 2B, lanes 2 and 7) led to a complete swap of L \u00c3 binding abilities. Within this segment, several amino acid stretches diverge between human and mouse RNase L ( Fig 2E) . Exchanging residues 26-28 did not lead to L \u00c3 binding to human RNase L ( Fig 2B, lane 8) . Exchanging residues 47-51 led to recognition of both human and mouse RNase L by L \u00c3 (Fig 2B, lanes 4 and 9) . Exchanging both residue stretches led to a significant swap in L \u00c3 binding abilities as L \u00c3 readily bound human RNase L ( Fig 2B, lane 10) and almost completely lost the ability to bind mouse RNase L (Fig 2B, lane 5) (Fig 2C) . Thus, amino acid stretches D26, S27, S28 and K47, D50, A51 within ANK R1 of mouse RNase L are important for L \u00c3 binding.",

For this purpose, constructs expressing Flag-RNase L chimeras and constructs co-expressing L \u00c3 and mCherry were transfected in HeLa-M cells, which show minimal endogenous RNase L activity [41] . The OAS/RNase L pathway was activated in these cells by transfecting polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (polyI:C). RNA was then extracted and separated on agarose gel and on RNA chips (Fig 2D and S2A Fig) to evaluate RNA degradation (i.e. RNase L activity). Again, mouse RNase L was inhibited by L \u00c3 whereas human RNase L was not ( Fig 2D and S2A Fig, lanes 2 and 12) , and swapping residues 26-51 of ANK R1 resulted in inhibition of human but not mouse RNase L by L \u00c3 (lanes 4 and 14) . Swapping residues 26-28 and 47-51 led to a clear inhibition of human RNase L while decreasing L \u00c3 influence on mouse RNase L activity (lanes 10 and 20). In general, results from interaction and functional studies were congruent. However, for some constructs such as mouse RNase L G47N50V51, interaction with L \u00c3 was conserved while activity inhibition was weak (Fig 2B-2D) . A possible explanation for such discrepancies is that L \u00c3 still binds to this chimera but with an affinity that is too low to trigger RNase L inhibition.",

Since we recently cloned rat RNase L and showed that L \u00c3 from the rat TMEV strain RTV-1 inhibited rat but not mouse RNase L, we extended the analysis to rat/mouse RNase L chimeras ( Fig 3A) . Rat and mouse RNase L share 79% amino acid identity ( Fig 2E) . In this case, L \u00c3 binding (Fig 3B and  3C ) and L \u00c3 -mediated RNase L inhibition ( Fig 3D) were assessed using both L \u00c3 of the mouse TMEV strain DA (L \u00c3 DA ) and L \u00c3 of the rat TMEV strain RTV-1 (L \u00c3 RTV-1 ). As expected, mouse RNase L interacted with and was inhibited by L \u00c3 DA but not L \u00c3 RTV-1 , while rat RNase L was inhibited by and interacted with L \u00c3 RTV-1 but not L \u00c3 DA (Fig 3B, 3, 11, 12) . Swapping ANK R1-R2 (residues 1-84) was sufficient to swap both interaction and inhibition phenotypes (Fig 3B and 3C , lanes 3, 4, 9, 10; Figs 3D and S2B, lanes 5, 6, 14, 15) . In contrast to what was observed with human/mouse chimeras, swapping ANK R1 (residues 18-58) alone was not sufficient to exchange the phenotypes, indicating that residues in ANK R2 were also required for L \u00c3 interaction. Insertion of point mutations based on differences between rat and mouse sequences showed that swapping residues 80-81 in ANK R2 was sufficient to trigger rat RNase L recognition by L \u00c3 DA ( . Although the exchange of phenotype was not complete (i.e. some interaction was still detected between L \u00c3 DA and mouse RNase L R80,Y81 ), these data show that residues 80 and 81 of ANK R2 contribute to L \u00c3 binding to RNase L and L \u00c3 -mediated RNase L inhibition. Fig 4 illustrates residues that were mapped in ANK R1 and R2 as components of the L \u00c3 footprint on RNase L. Being located very close to both a 2-5A binding site and a protomer-protomer interface, the L \u00c3 interaction site does not resolve the question of whether L \u00c3 interferes with 2-5A binding or with RNase L dimer formation.",

In the presence of L \u00c3 , rRNA integrity was preserved ( Fig 6A, lanes 6-10) , confirming that L \u00c3 could inhibit RNase L in the conditions used for the crosslinking experiment. Immunoblotting showed that RNase L formed dimers and oligomers when activated by 2-5A ( Fig 6B) . The corresponding bands were much less intense when L \u00c3 was expressed, showing that L \u00c3 inhibits mouse RNase L dimerization and oligomerization. When the experiment was reproduced with human RNase L, the appearance of high molecular weight bands upon 2-5A addition was not inhibited by L \u00c3 , as expected ( Fig 6C) . To further confirm the identity of RNase L dimers and oligomers, the experiment was repeated using a dimerization-defective mouse RNase L mutant (RNase L K391R) [43] . High molecular weight bands observed with the wild-type RNase L upon 2-5A treatment were not obtained with the dimerization-defective mutant (Fig 6D) , confirming that these bands indeed corresponded to RNase L dimers and oligomers. We next analyzed whether oligomers formed in the presence of 2-5A involved additional protein partners or whether they resulted from homooligomerization. Therefore, crosslinking was performed after 2-5A addition as above, using the reversible agent dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidyl propionate) (DTSSP) that is compatible with further mass spectrometry analysis. High molecular weight complexes were then separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by mass spectrometry ( Fig  6E) . Except for keratin which is a typical contaminant, no specific protein other than RNase L was detected in the complexes, suggesting that RNase L oligomers corresponded to homooligomers.",

            "text": "Collectively, these data show that 2-5A can trigger the dimerization and the homooligomerization of RNase L and that L \u00c3 binding to RNase L inhibits these processes. L \u00c3 interferes with 2-5A binding to mouse RNase L Dimerization inhibition could result either from steric hindrance of RNase L protomer association or from inhibition of 2-5A binding to RNase L ankyrin repeats. Our data suggest the latter explanation. Indeed, as shown in Fig 7A (white arrows) , high doses of 2-5A added to lysates of 293T cells overexpressing L \u00c3 and Flag-mouse RNase L could overcome L \u00c3 -mediated inhibition of RNase L activity. To analyze the influence of L \u00c3 on 2-5A binding to RNase L in a more direct manner, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments were performed with purified recombinant L \u00c3 , mouse RNase L and, as a negative control, human RNase L. First, by immobilizing biotin-modified 2-5A on streptavidin (SA)-chips followed by addition of mouse RNase L, we determined that mouse RNase L rapidly binds to 2-5A (k a = 2.1 x 10 5 M -1 x sec -1 ) with a relatively slow dissociation rate of 2.2 x10 -3 sec -1 (Fig 7) . Direct binding of mouse RNase L or human RNase L to (His) 6 -L \u00c3 immobilized on Ni-NTA sensor chip was then assessed. Consistent with our prior observations (12), we found that human RNase L did not bind to L \u00c3 while mouse RNase L bound to L \u00c3 with a K D of 1.3 x 10 \u22126 M (S3A and S3B Fig, Fig 7E) . Similarly, L \u00c3 bound to immobilized mouse GST-RNase L (S3C Fig, Fig 7E) . Next, to determine if L \u00c3 binding interfered with 2-5A binding to mouse RNase L, biotin-labeled 2-5A was immobilized on SA-chips and mouse RNase L or human RNase L was simultaneously injected without or with increasing concentrations of L \u00c3 and sensograms were recorded. Whereas L \u00c3 efficiently inhibited binding of mouse RNase L to 2-5A (IC 50 = 6.0 x 10 -7 M), L \u00c3 did not inhibit human RNase L from binding with 2-5A ( Fig 7B and 7C , respectively). Additionally, L \u00c3 was immobilized and mouse RNase L was injected in the absence or presence of different concentrations of 2-5A. 2-5A dose-dependently inhibited mouse RNase L binding to L \u00c3 (IC 50 = 1.32 x 10 \u22128 M) (Fig 7D) . Taken together, our data show that L \u00c3 interferes with 2-5A binding to mouse RNase L while no effect of L \u00c3 was observed on 2-5A binding to human RNase L.",

First, purified mouse RNase L was pre-incubated without L \u00c3 (Fig 7F, open circles) or with 10 \u03bcM L \u00c3 (Fig 7F, closed circles) followed by addition of increasing 2-5A concentrations. Results confirmed that L \u00c3 inhibits 2-5A-dependent RNase L activation and showed that while the 2-5A concentration for half activation (K 50 ) remained unchanged, the maximum velocity (V max ) of the RNase L enzymatic activity was decreased b\u1ef9 40% by L \u00c3 (Fig 7F) . Next, mouse RNase L was either pre-incubated with increasing L \u00c3 concentrations followed by addition of 3 nM 2-5A (Fig 7G, circles) or pre-incubated with 3 nM 2-5A followed by addition of increasing L \u00c3 concentrations (Fig 7G, triangles) . In both cases L \u00c3 inhibited 2-5A-dependent RNase L activation but efficacy of the inhibition was more potent when L \u00c3 was added prior to 2-5A (IC 50 : 9.99 \u03bcM vs 34.14 \u03bcM). Altogether, these results suggest that L \u00c3 inhibits 2-5A binding to mouse RNase L, possibly because L \u00c3 inhibits dimerization required for cooperative binding of 2-5A between the RNase L protomers [30, 45] .",

L \u00c3 -mediated inhibition of RNase L in vivo was not analyzed for TMEV, by comparing the infection of RNase L-deficient (RNase L -/-) and RNase L +/+ mice [21] because these mice are on the C57BL/6 background and therefore rapidly clear TMEV infection through a potent H-2 b -restricted cytolytic T lymphocyte response [46] [47] [48] . We thus tested the RNase L antagonist capacity of L \u00c3 in chimeric MHV viruses. We constructed recombinant MHV A59 viruses (Fig 8A) carrying either a wild-type or a catalytically defective (H126R mutation) ns2 PDE (an enzyme that degrades 2-5A). From the latter construct, we obtained chimeric viruses where the non-essential NS4 protein was replaced by either wildtype L \u00c3 (ns2 H126R -L \u00c3 ) or a truncated L \u00c3 1-92 lacking anti-RNase L activity (ns2 H126R -L \u00c3 1-92 ) [12] .",

Interestingly, expression of full length L \u00c3 but not of L \u00c3 1-92 rescued replication of the ns2 H216R mutant virus to near WT levels. In contrast, mutant and chimeric viruses replicated efficiently in RNase L -/-BMMs, with similar kinetics and final titers (Fig 8D) , confirming that ns2 and L \u00c3 acted through antagonism of the OAS/RNase L pathway.",

On the other hand, rat/mouse RNase L chimeras showed that residues 80, 81 in ANK R2 were also critical for L \u00c3 interaction with RNase L and, to a lesser extent, for RNase L inhibition. In general, results from interaction and functional studies were congruent. For some constructs, however, interaction was observed while inhibition was weak, suggesting that a strong affinity is required for RNase L inhibition. In summary, our data show that L \u00c3 inhibits RNase L activation by associating with loops exposed at the surface of RNase L ANK R1 and R2 (Fig 4) .

It is not known whether 2-5A mediates the interface between RNase L dimers and/or whether dimers interact with each other through a novel interface.

Also, L \u00c3 inhibited 2-5A-dependent RNase L activation when it was added both prior or after 2-5A addition but the inhibition was stronger when L \u00c3 was added first (Fig 7G) . Taken together, our data are compatible with a model where L \u00c3 binding to RNase L sterically hinders 2-5A binding to ANK repeats of RNase L. However, pre-bound 2-5A would decrease the affinity of L \u00c3 for RNase L, likely through dimerization of RNase L. If our model is correct, RNase L activation/inhibition would depend on a race between 2-5A and L \u00c3 production in infected cells. It is worth noting that L \u00c3 is produced by an open reading frame (ORF) that overlaps the ORF coding the main viral polyprotein. The L \u00c3 ORF can be translated from the viral genomic RNA in an IRES-dependent fashion, and is likely expressed very early after infection, before viral dsRNA produced during RNA replication can trigger OAS activation.",

            "text": "It is intriguing to observe the variety of strategies developed by viruses to antagonize RNase L. The NS1 protein of influenza A virus sequesters dsRNA thus preventing sensing by OAS [36] . DsRNA sequestration allows the virus to use a single activity to interfere with OAS activation and to prevent activation of other dsRNA-dependent pathways such as the RIG-like helicase pathway that leads to IFN production and that of the double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) [51] , which leads to translation inhibition. Conversely, acting downstream of the OAS/RNase L pathway would represent a more specific manner to efficiently antagonize RNase L. It is expected that such a strategy would be used by viruses that are particularly susceptible to the OAS/RNase L pathway. In this respect, it is puzzling that L \u00c3 evolved to bind RNase L, and yet interferes with 2-5A binding rather than preventing RNase L dimerization directly. Indeed, the unique known function of 2-5A is RNase L activation [52] . Thus, inhibiting dimerization would appear as a more likely mechanism to antagonize RNase L activation because the concentration of RNase L monomers is expected to be much lower than that of 2-5A molecules, which can reach micromolar concentrations in infected cells [53, 54] .",

For instance, products generated by RNase L enzymatic activity can promote autophagy. Induction of autophagy by RNase L was reported to dampen EMCV or SeV replication at early stages of infection whereas it promoted viral replication at later stages [24, 25] , possibly by increasing the supply in autophagosomal membranes that are hijacked by some viruses like EMCV [55] to assemble their replication complexes.",

Cells were harvested and washed with ice cold 20 mM HEPES pH 8.2 containing 150 mM NaCl and lysed by sonication (20 x 10s) in buffer A (20 mM HEPES pH 8.2, 10% glycerol, 2 mM EDTA, 14.2 mM beta-mercaptoethanol, and 200 mM NaCl) containing 10 units/ml benzonase, protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) and 100\u03bcM PMSF. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 x g for 30 min at 4\u02daC, diluted 5-fold and bound to SP Sepharose FF cation exchange resin (GE Lifesciences) packed in XK 15mm x 10mm column. The column was washed with binding buffer A until the basal OD 280nm was constant. The bound proteins were eluted with a 0.2-2 M gradient of NaCl in buffer A. The fractions were analyzed by SDS page (L \u00c3 eluted at >500 mM NaCl). The peak fractions containing L \u00c3 were pooled and diluted 1:3 in buffer A and bound with Ni-NTA resin, washed with buffer A containing 10 mM imidazole and eluted with 150 mM imidazole in buffer A. Fractions were loaded on 12% SDS-PAGE and stained with Gel-Code Blue (Promega). The yield was~0.25mg/L.",

Transduced cells exhibited a diffuse cytoplasmic and nuclear green fluorescence. L \u00c3 was then introduced in the cells either by transfection or by infection to assess whether L \u00c3 expression would trigger the relocation of Flag-muANK R1-2-eGFP to the cytosol and/or the mitochondrial surface. The truncated inactive L \u00c3 1-92 was used as a negative control. A. Design of the experiment. B. Visualization of Flag-muANK R1-2-eGFP fluorescence (green). L \u00c3 1-92 (ctrl-, negative control) expression did not induce any relocation of the fusion protein. L \u00c3 WT expression led to Flag-muANK R1-2-eGFP relocation to the cytoplasmic compartment. C. L \u00c3 did not concentrate the fusion protein at the mitochondrial surface. Upper panels: visualization of Flag-muANK R1-2-eGFP fluorescence (green, left), HA-L \u00c3 (anti-L \u00c3 serum, artificially colored in blue, middle) and mitochondria (MitoTracker, red, right). Lower panels: merge of Flag-muANK R1-2-eGFP (green) and mitochondria (MitoTracker, red) (left), merge of HA-L \u00c3 (blue) and mitochondria (Mito-Tracker, red) (middle), and merge of Flag-muANK R1-2-eGFP (green), L \u00c3 (blue) and mitochondria (MitoTracker, red) (right). (PDF) S2 Fig. Inhibition of chimeric RNase L by L \u00c3 . Analysis of RNase L-mediated RNA degradation in HeLa-M cells overexpressing indicated Flag-RNase L chimera and HA-L \u00c3 . RNA samples extracted 7 hours after polyI:C transfection were analyzed by RNA chips and quantified. A. Inhibition of mouse RNase L carrying indicated human RNAse L residues (left) and of human RNase L carrying indicated mouse RNAse L residues (right) by L \u00c3 DA . Values under the lanes indicate the extent of rRNA degradation inhibition compared to that of WT mouse RNase L. B. Inhibition of mouse RNase L carrying indicated rat RNAse L residues (left) and of rat RNase L carrying indicated mouse RNAse L residues (right) by L \u00c3 DA and L \u00c3 RTV-1 . Values under the lanes indicate the extent of rRNA degradation inhibition by L \u00c3 compared to that mediated by L \u00c3 DA on mouse RNase L (left panel) or compared to that mediated by L \u00c3 RTV-1 on WT rat RNase L (right panel). (PDF) S3 Fig. Mouse RNase L but not human RNase L binds to L \u00c3 . Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments were performed using Biacore technology with purified recombinant L \u00c3 , mouse RNase L and human RNase L. A. His 6 -L \u00c3 was immobilized on Ni-NTA chips and human RNase L was injected at the indicated concentrations. B. His 6 -L \u00c3 was immobilized on Ni-NTA chips and mouse RNase L was injected at the indicated concentrations. C. GSTmouse RNase L was immobilized on anti-GST CM5 sensor chip and L \u00c3 was injected at the indicated concentrations. RU: response units. (PDF) S4 Fig. Full-length L \u00c3 was expressed in ns2 H126R -L \u00c3 -infected BMMs and inhibited RNase Lmediated RNA degradation. A. Flag-L \u00c3 expression in infected BMM was detected by immunoblotting using an anti-Flag antibody. B. Analysis of RNase L-mediated RNA degradation was performed by RNA chip. (PDF)",
