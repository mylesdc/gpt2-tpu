This study demonstrated for the first time that TRIM52 is a novel antiviral TRIM protein against Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infection. Overexpression of TRIM52 restricted JEV replication in BHK-21 and 293T cells. In addition, JEV nonstructural protein 2A (NS2A) is a protein that interacts with TRIM52. Their interaction degraded NS2A in a proteasome-dependent manner via the E3 ligase activity of TRIM52. Thus, TRIM52 is a novel antiviral TRIM protein, and it exerted antiviral activity against JEV infection by targeting and degrading viral NS2A.",

To test whether TRIM52 can influence JEV replication, we transfected BHK-21 and 293T cells with plasmids expressing HA-tagged TRIM52 or with an empty vector as control. The control and TRIM52-overexpressing cells were both infected with JEV at an MOI of 1. The culture supernatants were harvested 24 hour post-infection (hpi), and the titers of the progeny virus were determined using plaque forming unit assay on BHK-21 cells. Figure 1a shows that TRIM52 overexpression reduced JEV titers both in BHK-21 (left panel) and 293T cells (right panel). Moreover, gene copies of JEV C gene and protein level of NS3 in infected cells were detected, demonstrating the antiviral activity of TRIM52 against JEV. As shown in Fig. 1b , the intracellular C gene levels of JEV were significantly reduced in TRIM52-overexpressing cells compared with that in the vector control cells. In addition, Western blot analysis indicated that the NS3 protein levels of JEV were significantly repressed in the presence of TRIM52. These results suggest that TRIM52 exerted antiviral activity against JEV replication both in BHK-21 and 293T cells.",

TRIM79\u03b1 (also known as TRIM30D or TRIM30-3) presents only in rodent, which was the first reported and identified as an INF-induced TRIM protein that serviced as a flaviviurs restriction factor 35 . TRIM79\u03b1 directly targeted NS5 from Langat virus (LGTV) and Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) for degradation through lysosomes pathway to restrict virus replication. However, TRIM79\u03b1 did not target NS5 from West Nile virus (WNV), nor could it inhibit WNV replication. What's more, TRIM79\u03b1 is an essential mediator for IFN response specific to TBEV infection. TRIM56 is a virus-and IFN-inducible host antiviral factor. Liu and colleagues firstly demonstrated that human TRIM56 exhibited direct antiviral activity against YFV and DENV by targeting intracellular viral RNA replication 32 . Although the detail antiviral mechanisms of TRIM56 restricting YFV and DENV remaining unknown. The E3 ligase activity and integrity of the C-terminus of TRIM56 is essential for its antiviral activity against YFV and DENV. In addition, TRIM21 has been demonstrated that it as a negative regulator of IFN\u03b2 production mediated by IRF3 during JEV infection in human microglial cells (CHME3) 36 . Thus, JEV could exploit TRIM21 to attenuate host antiviral innate immune response during the early stage of infection.",

We also found that TRIM52 could activate NF-\u03ba B transcription activity, and induce the expression of TNF\u03b1 and IL-6.

Few TRIM proteins, including TRIM22 17,42 , TRIM25 43 and TRIM79\u03b1 44 , directly exert antiviral activity. TRIM52 also directly interacted with JEV NS2A protein (Fig. 2) . Moreover, TRIM52 mediated the ubiquitination of JEV NS2A to be degraded via the proteasome-dependent pathway. As shown in Fig. 4b , the protein level of NS2A was repressed in the presence of TRIM52 along with DMSO treatment. Addition of proteasome inhibitor MG132 obviously restored NS2A protein level. Moreover, the results in Fig. 3 indicate that the RING domain of TRIM52 was essential for its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. The RING domain-deleted TRIM52 mutant lost its capacity to degrade NS2A proteins (Fig. 4c) , resulting in truncation did not restrict JEV replication (Fig. 6 ). In summary, our data demonstrated that TRIM52 exerted antiviral activity against JEV replication by targeting the viral NS2A protein.",
