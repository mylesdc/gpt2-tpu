There is an ongoing outbreak of cryptococcosis in the western United States and Canada. Cryptococcosis is a disease resulting from the inhalation of the infectious propagules from the environment. The current and most frequently used animal infection models initiate infection via liquid suspension through intranasal instillation or intravenous injection. These models do not replicate the typically dry nature of aerosol exposure and may hinder our ability to decipher the initial events that lead to clearance or the establishment of infection. We have established a standardized aerosol model of murine infection for the human fungal pathogen Cryptococcus. Aerosolized cells were generated utilizing a Collison nebulizer in a whole-body Madison Chamber at different humidity conditions. The aerosols inside the chamber were sampled using a BioSampler to determine viable aerosol concentration and spray factor (ratio of viable aerosol concentration to total inoculum concentration). We have effectively delivered yeast and yeast-spore mixtures to the lungs of mice and observed the establishment of disease. We observed that growth conditions prior to exposure and humidity within the Madison Chamber during exposure can alter Cryptococcus survival and dose retained in mice.

Cryptococcus is responsible for approximately one-third of all AIDS related deaths and a more prevalent cause of HIV-related mortality in sub-Saharan Africa than tuberculosis [1] . In other developing countries infections as a result of Cryptococcus are second only to tuberculosis and frequently co-occur together [1] . The development of new antifungals, highly active antiviral treatment (HAART), and combination therapy regimens has increased longterm survival rates, but infections remain difficult to treat and frequently reoccur. Cryptococcus is now increasingly associated with a rising number of infections in seemingly healthy humans and animals worldwide [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] .",

Development of overt disease can be the result of acute, latent, or chronic infections. In nature C. neoformans var. neoformans is most frequently isolated from avian habitats and guano, and C. gattii is most frequently isolated from trees and soil. C. neoformans var. grubii, the most prevalent worldwide, has been frequently associated with avian habitats, and also trees and soil. Frequent isolation of Cryptococcus from plants and mating in association with plants, trees, soil, and avian guano suggest the importance of the environmental niche for both the development of infectious propagules (i.e. spores) and the maintenance of infectious reservoirs [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . Cryptococcus is a prominent environmental organism, and humans are frequently exposed to its airborne infectious propagules through inhalation [25, 26] . How the environmental growth conditions and airborne infectious route influences risk and development of disease is presently unknown.",

Although both methodologies cause morbidity and mortality, neither truly mimics the inhalation of infectious particles because these methodologies require yeast and/or spores to be administered within a suspension. The inoculation route, high dosages of cells utilized, and initial fluid solution could alter initial immune response and downstream sequela [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] . Appropriate control of cryptococcal infections depends on an intact immune system including macrophages, neutrophils, T cells, and the appropriate production and activity of cytokines [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] . Mounting evidence suggests that there are significant differences in risk to infection, development of disease, progression and host survival between the different Cryptococcus species [30, 37, 38, [46] [47] [48] . Current murine models are most frequently used but fall short of replicating the actual aerosol route of infection and may hinder our ability to decipher initial events that lead to the clearance or establishment of latent or progressive infection. Therefore these models may not accurately reflect the virulence properties of spores versus yeast, mating type a versus a strains, or the differences between molecular types or species [33, [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] .",

Historic applications of this approach include crude exposure from soil inoculated with Cryptococcus, utilization of a jet nebulizer, and infection in a Henderson Chamber [50, 54, 57] . Information extracted from the soil seeding infection was limited because infection rates and development of disease were variable, mice were exposed for multiple days, and the dosages of cells the mice were exposed to versus the dose initially retained in the lungs were not delineated. Infection initiated through the Henderson Chamber resulted in more consistent infection rates and development of disease in comparison to crude soil exposure [50] . Only 20% of mice exposed to aerosolized Cryptococcus basidiospores via a jet nebulizer succumbed to infection [53] . Variable infection rates and disease development were likely due to differences in the inoculum used, method of aerosolization, duration of exposure, host genotype, and strain of Cryptococcus utilized. These early studies were successful at initiating infection, but computer-controlled facilities were not available, Cryptococcus species were not yet taxonomically differentiated, and mating and the production of spores versus yeast had not been fully appreciated [50, 58] .",

These data can determine the effects of temperature, relative humidity, and the nebulization process on cells. In addition, we can calculate the dose that the mice were exposed to during a given time period, which facilitates the establishment of defined aerobiology exposure parameters for a given pathogen [59] . This study is the first contemporary application of the Madison Chamber to establish a well validated aerosol model of murine infection of Cryptococcus. We define the preparation of inoculum, concentration of inoculum, particle size distributions consistent with efficient aerosolization, and defined aerobiology exposure parameters for the effective and consistent delivery of aerosolized Cryptococcus cells to mice. A well validated inhalation model has considerable potential to facilitate novel insights into the primary exposure route of Cryptococcus in humans, time course of disease development, environmental conditions enhancing risk to acquisition, the role of spores and/or yeast in the infection process, and virulence of divergent mating types and genotypes which could lead to novel preventative strategies or therapeutic modalities.",

For preliminary aerosolization tests we varied growth condition(s), exposure time, and humidity to increase the viable number of cells that mice would be exposed to within the whole-body exposure apparatus (dose presented) as determined from the viable BioSampler densities. We aimed to obtain a calculated dose presented of greater than 100 cells/mouse to maximize dose delivered and retention within the lungs. In various trials, cells were (1) grown in yeast peptone dextrose broth (YPD; 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose) and prepared directly from the liquid preparation; (2) grown in YPD and subjected to natural evaporation and drying to mimic desiccation in nature, before being resuspended in water for nebulization; or (3) subcultured in YPD broth and then inoculated on agar for growth, mating, and the production of dry yeast and/ or spores. Although cells were initially grown by different methods all Cryptococcus strains were collected and 20 mL of 1610 8 cell/mL suspension were used as standard inoculum density for each aerobiology exposure. To confirm the density of each cell preparation prior to nebulization (Pre-nebulization, CFU/mL) in the Madison Chamber 500 mL aliquots from every final preparation were taken and diluted on YPD agar in triplicate and colony-forming units (CFUs) were determined and compared to the expected 1610 8 cell/mL. In total, eleven trial experiments were performed, eight without mice, and three utilizing mice (Table S2) . Broth-grown Cryptococcus cells were passaged twice in 250 mL flasks containing 25 mL of YPD broth with shaking at 30uC overnight (8-12 hrs) . Cells were then collected by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in 5 mL autoclaved millipore water. Cell density was determined by hemacytometer and 20 mL of a 1610 8 cell/mL suspension were prepared for each strain. Cells subjected to drying prior to use in the Madison Chamber were grown in identical conditions to broth grown cells, but after the initial collection by centrifugation and resuspension in 5 mL water, cells were poured into a sterile petri plate, with the lid placed slightly ajar and allowed to air dry in a BSLII hood overnight. Cells were then collected, counted with a hemacytometer, and diluted to the standard density.",

In trials utilizing humidified air, the nebulizer air was mixed with humidified air (3761 lpm) as it entered the Madison Chamber. Humidified air was generated by two humidifiers connected in series (ZAB2-DT-S1-400-7, Lab Commerce Inc.). Humidity in the chamber was controlled from 30%-100% relative humidity (RH) and was measured in real-time during the aerosol exposure. Nebulized and humidified air flow rates were controlled with AeroMP (Aerosol Management Platform, Biaera Technologies, LLC) [57] . The Madison Chamber was operated under negative pressure at 21361 inches of water column using a vacuum pump. Cryptococcus aerosols inside the Madison Chamber were sampled using an SKC BioSampler (SKC Inc, Model 225-9595) and aerodynamic particle sizer (APS, TSI Inc.). The start and stop operation of APS and BioSampler was controlled by AeroMP [57] . Particle size distribution by count and mass were measured by the APS at two-minute intervals for 30 seconds for the duration of the aerosol exposure. AeroMP was used to calculate the count mean aerodynamic diameter (CMAD) and mass mean aerodynamic diameter (MMAD). MMAD is used to describe a polydisperse aerosol particle size above and below which 50% of the mass of the particles is contained. The geometric standard deviation (GSD) was calculated using the particle size distributions by mass [60] . Aliquots obtained post-nebulization and from the BioSampler were dilution plated in triplicate on YPD agar, incubated at room temperature for two to four days and the average CFUs/mL was calculated. This data was utilized to determine the effect of nebulization on the viability of Cryptococcus cells by comparing the CFUs prior to nebulization and postnebulization. Post-nebulization to Pre-nebulization ratio equal to or greater than one indicates 100% survival post nebulization, whereas a ratio value less than one indicates decreased viability post-nebulization. Viable aerosol density (C a ) was used to calculate spray factor (F s ), the ratio of viable aerosol concentration in the chamber to the starting inoculum density in the nebulizer [57, 59] .",

            "text": "Mice were exposed to aerosols in three independent trial experiments (Table S2 , Trial #5, #8, and #11). Delivery of aerosolized Cryptococcus cells to the lungs of mice was successful in all three trials. In the first preliminary mouse exposure, only 50% (EJB18, YPD-dried) to 75% (EJB18, Arabidopsis leaf agar) of mice exposed to aerosolized C. gattii at 70% RH for 20 minutes retained viable C. gattii one hour post exposure (Table S2) . We observed that 100% of mice retain viable C. neoformans var. grubii cells within the lungs when mice were exposed for one hour at 95% RH. C. neoformans var. grubii H99a, KN99a, or the mated mixture with spores were aerosolized in individual exposures and the average doses retained were 2.07610 2 cells/lung, 3.52610 2 cells/lung, and 4.88610 2 cells/lung, respectively (Figure 3 ). Although the dose retained for the mated mixtures with spores was 1.46 (KN99a) and 2.46 (H99a) higher than yeast alone, this difference was not statistically significant. Spleen and brain tissues were not colonized by Cryptococcus one hour post-exposure (Figure 3a) . Over the 24 day duration of the experimental exposure, 100% of the mice displayed patterns of weight loss and significant increase of tissue burdens (lung, brain, and spleen), and one mouse expired prior to the 24 day time-point, consistent with disease development (Figure 3b ). Additionally, we used C. neoformans var. grubii strains YSB119a and KN99a NEO1 with drug resistance markers nourseothricin (NAT, YSB119a) or neomycin (NEO, KN99a NEO1) (Table S1) . To consolidate exposures, we mixed YSB119a and KN99a NEO1 in equal portions to use as the yeast only control for the mated mixtures containing yeast and spores. Similarly, we observed a lower dosed retained in mice exposed to yeast alone (8.8610 1 cells/mouse) versus the yeast and spore mixtures (1.5610 2 cells/mouse) (Figure 4) . Although dose retained for the mated mixtures with spores was 1.76 higher than yeast alone (YSB119a and KN99a NEO1), this difference was not statistically significant. We were able to track the presence of NAT-, NEO-, and NAT-and NEO-resistant colonies from aerosolization to post-nebulization. Doubly-drug resistant colonies represented less than 0.001% of the cells obtained pre-and postnebulization. We also noticed a large disparity between total CFUs on YPD agar and total CFUs of NEO-resistant cells, indicating a generalized loss of the NEO resistance marker (data not shown). After 3-4 weeks incubation we observed a loss of NEO R cells in the KN99a NEO1 strain incubated alone or in combination with YSB119a. After growth on V8 only 35% of the non-mated NEO marked parental strains retained NEO resistance. In contrast, 83% of NEO R cells isolated from mating colonies retained the NEO selective marker. After observing the loss of NEO resistance in the KN99a NEO1 strain we confirmed that the NEO marker was episomal and not integrated by PCR, which prevented the extension of this experiment to explore the role of spores in the infection process. In summary, we obtained NAT-and NEOresistant colonies but did not observe double-drug resistant colonies in the BioSampler or from the lung tissues of mice.",

The MMAD distributions were similar but variable among trials and ranged from 1.0 mm-4.0 mm ( Figure S2 and Table S2 ). However, the MMAD indicates that the particle size was consistently in the respirable range of less than 5 mm except for trial 6 in which the particle sizes ranged from 9.7 mm to 17.2 mm. The observed MMAD, CMAD, and GSD for C. neoformans and C. gattii were similar. MMAD of C. gattii ranged from 1.0 mm to 4 mm, CMAD 0.67 to 0.90, and GSD ranged from 1.2 to 2.95. The MMAD of C. neoformans var grubii ranged from 1.6 mm to 2.1 mm, CMAD 0.78 to 0.83, and GSD ranged from 1.8 to 2.74. In general, the observed MMAD was most consistent at 95% humidity. Particle size distribution by count and mass was variable and ranged up to 10 mm, but a higher concentration and mass of particles less than 5 mm were observed ( Figure S3 to S6). The particle density and mass profiles for C. gattii (EJB18) were consistent over increased aerosolization time from 20 to 60 minutes ( Figure S3 ). Agar grown C. gattii EJB18 exhibited one major particle diameter peak around 3 mm (Figure S4a , b, c) in contrast to the two peaks (,1.5 mm and 3 mm) observed for broth grown cells ( Figure S3 ). Agar grown Cryptococcus cells (Figure S4a , b, c) exhibited more consistent aerodynamic particle diameter, mass, and density profiles versus YPD-broth ( Figure S4d , e) or YPD-dried cells ( Figure S4f ). During aerosolization of C. neoformans var. grubii (H99) particle density, mass, and size profiles remained consistent between 45% to 95% humidity ( Figure S5 ). Broth-grown H99 cells ( Figure S5 ) display a broad aerodynamic particle range in contrast to C. gattii EJB18 broth grown ( Figure S3 ) or agar grown EJB18 cells ( Figure S4 ). Particle mass, size, and density distributions were similar between H99 yeast cells and the mated mixture containing yeast and spores ( Figure S6 ). The size of aerosolized C. neoformans var. grubii particles was stable during 20 minutes of exposure at 45%, 70% and 95% humidity ( Figure S7a ). The coefficient of variance of MMAD was 3.12% (45% RH), 3.54% (70% RH), and 3.83% (95% RH). The concentration of particles generated was more consistent at 70% and 95% RH than with 45% RH ( Figure S7b ). The coefficient of variance related to cell density was higher for 45% RH than 70% RH and 95% RH.",

Our inoculum density is similar to previous reports used to initiate C. neoformans, Aspergillus, and bacterial aerosol infections, but our experiments utilized greater volume than previously reported [50, 53, 54, 56, 59] . The density of viable Cryptococcus yeast cells post-nebulization was equal to or greater than the inoculum density pre-nebulization.

Cryptococcus may survive nebulization better than other organisms because in the environment, it can survive harsh conditions for long periods of time, withstanding desiccation, natural irradiation, passage through hosts, and temperature fluctuations, possibly due to its polysaccharide capsule and ability to melanize [66] . The small increases in cell density observed post-nebulization are most likely an artifact from loss of water volume during the nebulization process and not a result of increasing viability or replication. In all except one trial, MMAD was less than 5 mm and within the respirable range. In the outlier, Trial #6, MMAD ranged from 9 mm to 17 mm. We suspect that the unusual MMAD observed may be the result of inefficient desiccation of yeast cells prior to re-suspension, non-standard growth conditions, or unexplained measurement malfunction during aerosolization.",

(1989) estimated the spore load inhaled by a mouse in 15 minutes of exposure at 10 3 to 10 6 cells, which exceeded what we observed [53] . Effective aerosol delivery of bacteria to murine lungs has been reported with doses presented in the range of 100 to 600 cells/mouse [59] . Aerosol delivery of Aspergillus fumigatus conidia resulted in a dose retained of 10 3 cells/mouse [55, 56] . We aimed to obtain a calculated dose presented greater than 100 cells/mouse to maximize dose delivered and retention within the mouse lungs because Cryptococcus yeast cells are larger than Aspergillus conidia and most bacterial cells delivered through aerosol challenge, 1 mm to 10 mm versus 0.9 mm to 2 mm, respectively [23, 67, 68] . This principle was confirmed since the observed range of MMAD, CMAD, and GSD for of aerosolized Cryptococcus cells was larger and more variable than previously reported for various bacteria and fungi [59, [67] [68] [69] . We observed a broadened aerodynamic size range for C. gattii comprised of two distinct peak concentrations in comparison to C. neoformans, which displayed a smaller size range with one single broad peak size range. These observations appear consistent with previous morphological descriptions detailing the larger and more elongated yeast and spore morphology of C. gattii in contrast to the more consistent and round cell morphology of C. neoformans [70] .",

            "text": "In an attempt to maximize the dose presented, we grew Cryptococcus cells under different laboratory conditions that would more closely mimic conditions in nature, resulting in substrategrown and/or desiccated cells. Cells were grown in YPD broth and subjected to natural desiccation overnight or grown on Arabidopsis agar. During the third trial, we were able to monitor relative humidity by an additional integrated package that was previously unavailable. We observed increased viable BioSampler concentrations, which resulted in a calculated dose presented that attained our predicted cut off value of .100 cells/mouse for both YPD-dried and Arabidopsis agar-grown cells. The increase in the calculated dose presented could be attributed to both 70% relative humidity and/or changes in the cell preparation methodology, and additional experimentation will be necessary to establish the most important factor. Both relative humidity and cell growth conditions are known to impact survival and infectivity for bacteria and viruses [71] [72] [73] [74] [75] [76] [77] [78] . Additional trial exposures (without mice) were conducted to expand the aerosol model to C. neoformans and attempt to determine whether humidity was an important factor for a successful Cryptococcus aerosol model. We observed a linear increasing trend for C. neoformans var. grubii in BioSampler cell densities and dose presented that were positively correlated with increased humidity. These experiments in combination with additional experiments confirmed that increased humidity during aerosoliation increased viable aerosol and dose presented for C. neoformans var. neoformans (JEC21), C. neoformans var. grubii (H99), and C. gattii (EJB18). Following this finding, all aerosolization experiments were conducted at optimal humidity (RH = 95%). Humidity has been implicated to be a key factor in the viability and transmission of influenza (virus) and Francisella tularensis (bacteria) [77] [78] [79] . Low humidity is associated with increased transmission and high humidity is associated with lower transmission of influenza [77, 79] . Increased environmental isolation of Cryptococcus gattii has been associated with the flowering of Eucalyptus in Australia and during dry, hot summers in Vancouver, BC and the pacific northwestern USA [24] . The finding that humidity can influence viability and transmission of infectious propagules for fungal, viral, and bacterial pathogens suggests factors that may contribute to seasonal patterns of disease incidence.",

Mice were exposed to C. gattii cells from YPD-dried or Arabidopsis agar preparations. The dose presented from Arabidopsis agar preparations were slightly higher than those observed from the mice exposed to broth-grown and dried cells. The ability to precisely determine viable aerosols presented in the BioSampler, dose presented, and dose retained in this experiment utilizing the Madison Chamber sets these studies apart from all previously published reports on the aerosolization of Cryptococcus. Soil seeding and four-day exposure limited determining dose exposed and dose retained in mice that were exposed to Cryptococcus via soil exposure methodology. Exposure via the jet nebulizer or Henderson Chamber is much more similar to exposure via the Madison Chamber and hence is more readily comparable. Smith et al (1964) reported that mice received ,10 4 viable cells, but this value far exceeds CFUs obtained post mouse expiration and there is no methodology on the specifics of how this value was calculated. It is likely that what Smith et al. (1964) describes as ''viable cells received'' is comparable to either our BioSampler densities or viable dose presented to mice, and the former is most likely [50] . Our BioSampler densities were ,10 3 cells/mL to 10 5 cells/mL which is similar to the observed ''viable cells received'' reported.",

            "text": "In our study, 50% of the mice exposed to the YPD-dried preparation had quantifiable dose retained in their lungs versus 75% of the mice exposed to the Arabidopsis agar preparation. These rates of initial colonization are similar to the 67% to 100% terminal infection reported by Smith et al. in 1964 and much higher than the 20% mortality rate obtained by Sukroongreung et al. (1998) [50, 53] . In contrast, aerosol delivery of Aspergillus to immuno-compromised mice resulted in much higher lung burden (dose retained) but resulted in only 60 to 70% mortality [55] . CFUs observed in the lungs were variable between 0-50 cells/ mouse, and only a fraction of the dose presented was retained in the lungs. Some cells may be lodged in the upper respiratory system (nose, mouth, or throat), and may not immediately contribute to the dose retained. Cells deposited in the upper and lower respiratory tracts could be cleared by exhalation, killed by host defense mechanisms, or contribute to later development of infection. Actual dose presented and dose retained for each mouse was not addressed in Fu et al. (2012) but average CFUs in lung, blood, and brain tissues were determined at three and seven days post-exposure [54] . Dose retained at one-hour post-exposure in our experiments were much lower than CFUs obtained in other reports at three days, seven days, or post-expiration. In previous reports, the time-point chosen to assay dose retained varies from immediately post-exposure to 24 hrs depending on the organism. Our aim was to obtain the viable number of Cryptococcus cells that reached the lungs, minimizing the potential effects of killing by the host's immunological system, replication, or dissemination of Cryptococcus. We defined the dose retained at the one-hour timepoint because previous studies have indicated that macrophages can quickly initiate killing within two hours and significant differences in killing of Cryptococcus can be observed within one to four hours of in vitro incubation with macrophages and neutrophils [19, 40, 44] . Furthermore, previous reports have established that development of disseminated Cryptococcus does not often occur within hours of intranasal exposure because macrophages are implicated in the exit of Cryptococcus from the lungs, dissemination through the blood, passage through the blood brain barrier, and colonization of the brain [80] [81] [82] [83] [84] [85] . We expect the initial dose retained to increase over time when Cryptococcus is able to survive and replicate within the host.",

            "text": "Additional animal exposures were performed with mated and non-mated C. neoformans var. grubii H99 (a) and KN99 (a) in order to determine if the low dose retained was sufficient to initiate disease development and whether the presence of spores enhanced Cryptococcus viability during aerosoliation, increased dose retained, or enhanced development of disease. H99a and KN99a yeast were aerosolized separately or from a mated mixture containing hyphal fragments, yeast, and spores. No significant differences were observed in pre-nebulization, post-nebulization, BioSampler, spray factor, or dose presented between a or a yeast cells alone or in combination with spores. We observed higher but nonsignificant dose retained in mice exposed to the mated mixtures (yeast+spores). Over time, it is possible that these small differences could be important for disease progression and the development of systemic cryptococcosis. As expected, spleen and brain tissues were not colonized by Cryptococcus at one hour post exposure. Over the 24-day duration of the experiment, 100% of mice displayed patterns of weight loss and significant increase of tissue burdens (lung, brain, and spleen), and one mouse expired prior to the 25day time-point, consistent with disease development. The observed increase in CFUs, dissemination to the brain, weight loss, and death indicate progressive disease development consistent with murine infection models. We did not observe any significant differences in viable densities post-nebulization or particle size, mass, or density distribution of yeast cells or mated mixtures containing spores. Our data suggests that both yeast cells and spores are similar in their ability to survive nebulization and can share overlapping particle size, mass, and density characteristics during aerosolization. Increased relative humidity may contribute to increased viability of desiccated yeast cells post-nebulization. Our data supports the idea that in nature, both yeast cells and spore can serve as infectious particles and that risk to Cryptococcus infection may differ seasonally with varying environmental factors such as humidity. Additional research will be needed to determine if differences exist in the ability of spores versus yeast cells to traverse into the lower respiratory tract, or to enter, survive, replicate, or exit macrophages contributing to enhanced infectivity or dissemination. We demonstrated that at 95% relative humidity, we obtained 100% infection of mice, which exceeds infection efficiency reported for aerosol delivery via crude soil seeding, jet nebulizer, or Henderson apparatus [50, 53, 54] .",
