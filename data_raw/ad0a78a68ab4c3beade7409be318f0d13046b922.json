            "text": "Ubiquitin-specific protease 2 (USP2) belongs to the family of deubiquitinases that can rescue protein targets from proteasomal degradation by reversing their ubiquitination. In various cancers, including prostate cancer and ovarian carcinoma, upregulation of USP2 leads to an increase in the levels of deubiquitinated substrates such as fatty acid synthase, MDM2, cyclin D1 and Aurora-A. USP2 thus plays a critical role in tumor cells' survival and therefore represents a therapeutic target. Here a leukemia drug, 6-thioguanine, was found to be a potent inhibitor of USP2. Enzyme-kinetic and X-ray crystallographic data suggest that 6-thioguanine displays a noncompetitive and slow-binding inhibitory mechanism against USP2. Our study provides a clear rationale for the clinical evaluation of 6-thioguanine for USP2-upregulated cancers.",

            "text": "Ubiquitination, a kind of post-translational modification, as well as deubiquitination, which together comprise the ubiquitination system, can regulate not only the turnover of cellular proteins but also, through various modes of mono-or polyubiquitination, receptor trafficking, DNA repair, cell-cycle progression, immune response, autophagy and apoptosis 1 . This versatility has raised interest in pinpointing components of the ubiquitin system as prime candidates for drug targets 2 . Among them, the pursuit of deubiquitinases (DUBs) as pharmaceutical targets is still in its infancy in that few inhibitors have entered clinical trials, albeit some broad-spectrum inhibitors have been patented and highly selective inhibitors have been developed 3-6 . The human genome encodes about 80-90 DUBs, of which the largest of the five DUB families is the ubiquitin-specific proteases (USPs) 7 . One of these, USP2, is able to remove ubiquitin from a range of protein substrates such as fatty acid synthase 8 , MDM2 9 , cyclin D1 10 and Aurora-A 11 . Fatty acid synthase has been reported to be highly expressed in a variety of cancers, including cancers of the prostate, ovary, lung, colon, and breast 12 , while MDM2, cyclin D1 and Aurora-A play critical roles in p53 regulation, cell cycle progression and mitotic events, respectively 9,10,13 . All of these studies suggest that the inhibition of USP2 may be a good therapeutic approach against cancers. In 2016, Davis et al. 6 reported that a small molecule, ML364, can induce cell cycle arrest and inhibit the growth of colorectal and mantle cell lymphoma cell lines via USP2 inhibition, albeit it is still not a clinical drug. In the present study, 6-thioguanine (6TG), an old drug still clinically used to treat leukemia, rheumatoid arthritis and bowel disease 14 , was identified as a potent USP2 inhibitor. Further studies using enzyme kinetics and X-ray crystallography to delineate its direct binding to USP2 were performed. Our findings support earlier results suggesting that 6TG has a broad spectrum of activity [15] [16] [17] , and have implications with respect to the need for direct clinical evaluation of its use against USP2-upregulated cancers.",

According to previous studies involving molecular docking experiments, the anti-leukemia and immunosuppressant drugs 6MP and 6TG, which act as inhibitors of SARS and MERS coronavirus papain-like proteases (PLpros), may also be able to bind to the active site of human USP2 as both kinds of enzymes share the palm-thumb-fingers structural scaffold and conserved catalytic triad Cys-His-Asp/Asn 17-20 .

To understand the detailed kinetic mechanisms involved in the interaction of 6TG with USP2, the deubiquitination activity of the enzyme was measured under various combinations of inhibitor concentrations and Ub-AFC substrate concentrations. The inhibition data were globally fitted to all possible kinetic models including competitive, noncompetitive, uncompetitive and mixed inhibition models. Interestingly, the results suggest that a noncompetitive inhibition pattern can best describe the inhibition by 6TG with the double reciprocal plot showing all lines intercepting the x-axis and a K is of 24.6 \u03bcM ( Fig. 1C and Table 1 ). On the other hand, although 6MP also showed a noncompetitive inhibition pattern, the K is of 6MP inhibition is 14-fold higher than that of 6TG (Table 1 ). The K is for 6TG inhibition was 11-fold higher than the K M (2.3 \u00b1 0.2 \u03bcM) of the deubiquitination reaction, whereas that for 6MP inhibition was 152-fold higher than the K M of the deubiquitination reaction. The latter K is value indicates the ineffectiveness of 6MP for USP2 inhibition. In contrast, both 6TG and 6MP show a competitive inhibition pattern against coronaviral PLpro 17,18 .",

            "text": "Up to now, although USP2 inhibitors such as ML364 and chalcone-based small molecules 5, 6 have been discovered, no USP2-inhibitor complex structure has yet been solved. Moreover, as a noncompetitive inhibitor may show benefit in combination or adjuvant treatment with a competitive inhibitor, we are very interested in validating the binding mode of 6TG to USP2. Therefore, we tried to determine the structure of USP2 in complex with 6TG by X-ray crystallography. Although repeated attempts at crystallization of USP2 in complex with 6TG failed, we finally succeeded in the crystallization of the USP2 in complex with Ub and then soaked the crystals in the presence of 6TG. The crystal structure of the USP2-Ub-6TG complex was determined at 1.8 \u00c5 resolution (Table 2 and Fig. 2A ). Fortunately, some residual electron density like 6TG molecule lied on one side of the catalytic triad of USP2, while Ub is located on the opposite side ( Fig. 2B and extended data Fig. 1 ). There is no residual electron density like 6TG in the same place while refined using the diffraction data without 6TG soaking. However, after refinement, the temperature factor of 6TG is 65.2 \u00c5 2 , higher than 38.9 \u00c5 2 of the protein. Decrease the occupancy to 50% can lower the temperature factor of the molecule to 40.9 \u00c5 2 . It indicates that 6TG may not exist as a full but half occupancy in an asymmetric unit. We have tried to increase the soaking concentration or soaking time to enhance the occupancy or electron density but failed. The co-crystallization of the protein with 6TG also failed. Nevertheless, the structure indicates that 6TG has polar interactions with residues Leu269, Gln283 and Tyr558 and van der Waals contacts with nearby residues Asn279 and Phe573, while may also show a possible covalent bonding interaction between the sulfur atom of 6TG and the thiol group of residue Cys276 (Fig. 2B ). Unlike 6TG, 6MP lacks an amide group (Table 1) . This may explain the ineffectiveness of 6MP against USP2, as there is a hydrogen-bonding interaction between the amide of 6TG and the side-chain oxygen atom of the residue Gln283. Overall, the ternary complex structure of USP2-Ub-6TG suggests the existence of an enzyme-substrate-inhibitor (ESI) complex and confirms the noncompetitive mechanism of USP2 inhibition by 6TG.",

To resolve this, in the present study, the crystal structure of the USP2 C276S mutant in complex with Ub was determined at 1.24 \u00c5 resolution (Table 2) . Indeed, the hydroxyl group of Ser276 shows a 140\u00b0 orientation change compared with the thiol group of Cys276 (Fig. 3B ). This change results in the rescue of the hydrogen-bonding interaction between Ser276 and His557 and the reconnection of the catalytic triad even in the presence of Ub. Interestingly, but not surprisingly, the USP2 C276S mutant still maintains 10% deubiquitinating activity (Fig. 1B) . This indicates that the C276S mutant is less active but not fully inactive. Furthermore, in the presence of 40 \u03bcM 6TG, the DUB activity of the USP2 C276S mutant decreases to 30%, suggesting that 6TG can still inhibit the enzyme without the disulfide-bonding interaction. Compared with those of wild-type USP2, the residues interacting with 6TG, such as Leu269, Gln283 and Tyr558, have no conformational change in C276S mutant, indicating the existence of 6TG binding pocket (Fig. 3B ). The movement of residue Asp575 following 6TG binding may also result in the inhibition of C276S mutant. Moreover, in the present structure, one oxygen atom of the carboxyl group of Ub-Gly76 is located in the oxyanion hole consisting of the three amides from Asn271, Thr275 and Ser276 (Fig. 3B ). Previous studies indicated that mutation of residue Asn271 (N271A) has no influence on kinetic parameters such as k cat and K M 24 . This indicates that the two main-chain amides from residues 275 and 276 are enough to stabilize oxyanion formation during catalysis. On the other hand, different to the USP2-Ub complex, USP2 C276S-Ub complex shows electrostatic interaction between residues Asp575 and His557 (Fig. 3B) . It suggests that Asp575 may directly influence the protonation of His557, not via the interaction between Asn271 and Asp575 24 . Overall, the present structure provides a foundation for more understanding the molecular basis of USP2 catalysis.",

Scientific RepoRts | (2018) 8:3102 | DOI:10.1038/s41598-018-21476-w the present study, to validate the reversibility of the enzyme inactivation, USP2 was incubated with 1 mM 6TG for 2 h followed by removal of the small molecules using a Sephadex G-25 column. This treatment led to a 95% loss of activity, suggesting irreversible inhibition of the USP2 by 6TG. The irreversible inhibition of enzyme activity indicates that 6TG may be covalently associating with the enzyme 26 . Next, the 6TG-labelled USP2 was incubated with 2 or 20 mM \u03b2ME for 10 min and then measured the activity to see if any re-activation. Although not very high, there is 14% and 20% of the enzyme activity restored after treated by \u03b2ME, respectively. The rescuing effect of reductant suggests that the modification may be due to the disulfide bonding interaction between the enzyme and 6TG. Nevertheless, the above observations suggest that 6TG may be a \"slow-binding\" inhibitor 26 . Here we measured the time-resolved emission for 200 s under various concentrations of 6TG and found that the emission curve was curved downward, indicating a slow-binding mechanism (Fig. 4A) . Different k inact at various concentrations of 6TG were determined by fitting the data to Eq. 2 and then plotted versus those various concentrations of 6TG (Fig. 4B) . The saturation pattern and irreversible inhibition of enzyme activity suggests that slow binding may be due to affinity labeling, in accordance with Copland's models 26 . Following this, fitting the data to the saturation equation, we obtained a K inact of 15.6 \u03bcM (Fig. 4B and Table 2 ). This value is even lower than K is , indicating that 6TG may undergo a covalent-bonding interaction with USP2 very soon after binding.",

Enzyme activity was measured by continuously monitoring the fluorescence emission increase at 485 nm upon substrate cleavage at excitation wavelength of 350 nm in a PerkinElmer LS 50B luminescence spectrometer. The increase in fluorescence was linear for the first 25 s. Kinetic parameters were obtained by fitting the initial velocities (v i ) to the Michaelis-Menten equation. The program Sigmaplot 12 (Systat Software) was used for data analysis.",
