            "text": "Infectious disease nucleic acid amplification technologies (NAAT) have superior sensitivity, specificity, and rapid time to result compared to traditional microbiological methods. Recovery of concentrated, high quality pathogen nucleic acid (NA) from complex specimen matrices is required for optimal performance of several NA amplification/detection technologies such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Fully integrated NAAT platforms that enable rapid sample-to-result workflows with minimal user input are generally restricted to larger reference lab settings, and their complexity and cost are prohibitive to widespread implementation in resource limited settings (RLS). Identification of component technologies for incorporation of reliable and affordable sample preparation with pathogen NA amplification/ detection into an integrated platform suitable for RLS, is a necessary first step toward achieving the overarching goal of reducing infectious disease-associated morbidity and mortality globally. In the current study, we evaluate the performance of six novel NA extraction technologies from different developers using blinded panels of stool, sputum and blood spiked with variable amounts of quality-controlled DNA-and/or RNA-based microbes. The extraction efficiencies were semi-quantitatively assessed using validated real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assays specific for each microbe and comparing target-specific RT-PCR results to those obtained with reference NA extraction methods. The technologies were ranked based on overall diagnostic accuracy (analytical sensitivity and specificity). Sample input and output volumes, total processing time, user-required manual steps and cost estimates were also examined for suitability in RLS. Together with the performance analysis, these metrics were used to select the more suitable candidate technologies for further optimization of integrated NA amplification and detection technologies for RLS.",

Rapid diagnostics are also critical to identify pathogens for which targeted public health interventions can be employed to control disease transmission in the community. Nucleic acid amplification technologies (NAAT) to identify common pathogens have become a routine approach for infectious disease diagnosis in high-income countries. Many NAAT products now exist that have been cleared or approved by national health authority agencies, in addition to a variety of qualified laboratory-developed methods used in some facilities [2, 3] . Although various amplification methodologies have been developed, RT-PCR is the predominant NAAT used for diagnostic testing [4] . The implementation of NAAT in clinical diagnostic laboratories is complex and can require sophisticated equipment, infrastructure, skilled laboratorians, and a robust quality management program [5] . These requirements present insurmountable challenges when trying to diagnose infectious diseases in the resource limited settings (RLS) of low and middle-income countries (LMIC), especially in rural environments where operational and logistical limitations further challenge implementation [4, 6] . Patients with communicable diseases in these locations would greatly benefit from rapid on-site diagnosis and timely linkage to care, resulting in improved individual outcomes and better infectious disease control.",

This unified system must be simple to operate, environmentally robust, yield timely results, be affordable and have high diagnostic accuracy. NAAT-based diagnostic platforms that are developed for use in high-income countries typically cannot tolerate the environmental extremes (e.g. temperature, humidity and dust) encountered in RLS and are not designed for use by healthcare workers that have not received extensive training [7, 8] . These factors make most currently available sample-toanswer NAAT options unsuitable for implementation in peripheral facilities in LMICs [5, 9] . A rapid time to result is necessary to reduce loss to follow up wherein the client may have multiple constraints that prevent returning for test results and possible treatment; these include distances required for travel to the test site, time-off from work for the visit, limited financial resources and other competing needs [10, 11] . Currently, most NAAT test results for infectious diseases are not available on the same day [12] [13] [14] . Cost per test is a further barrier to adoption, as many LMICs cannot purchase these high-cost diagnostic tests without global donor support [15] . For example, the WHO published a target product profile for a simple and accurate diagnostic NAAT for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) to supplant smear microscopy with a targeted price of US $4-6 [16] . For such settings, there is a global need for innovators to design and develop low cost, fully integrated testing systems that meet required performance criteria, while being functional in austere environments and applicable for a variety of pathogenic agents.",

The performance of each was then compared using pathogen-specific real-time PCR assays for each target. Other factors important for RLS were assessed, including specimen input volume (largely for sensitivity), degree of automation, and processing time. Collectively, these data were compiled and analyzed to gauge the suitability of these six technologies for future inclusion into an LMIC-appropriate integrated testing system-a subject of ongoing interest to a funder, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF).",

Other groups have described use of contrived samples in order to compare the performance of different extraction methods, test platforms and diagnostic laboratories hosting test platforms [19, 27] . Aliquots of pooled raw human sputum (10 X 25 mL volumes) and stool (3 X 75 g) were procured from BioIVT (Westbury, NY, USA).

All of the real time PCR assays used in this study are qualitative and not quantitative. To assess extraction performance, the specimen matrices were spiked with target microbes at levels that represented high, medium and low levels of target. It was assumed that all methods assessed in this exercise would detect the high levels and likely the medium range with the detection of low levels from extracts being the primary indicator of performance in terms of recovery and purity of the extract. MTB H37Rv strain Johannesburg and a clinical isolate of influenza A (H3N1) were used for sputum spiking; Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2 and male specific 2 (MS2) bacteriophage were used for stool; and Streptococcus pneumoniae and MS2 phage were used for whole blood. The inactivated MTB cells were procured from the laboratory of Dr. Bavesh Kana (University of Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa) and supplied in ten mLs of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) [28] . The MTB cells were originally cultured in Middlebrook 7H9 broth supplemented with 5% glycerol with incubation at 37\u02daC. The MTB cells were chemically inactivated to ensure minimal risk from laboratory-acquired infection during processing. No growth in MGIT after 42 days incubation confirmed the inactivation of MTB. The influenza A strain was an H3N1 clinical isolate provided by the Washington State Department of Health Public Health laboratories (Shoreline, WA, USA). Dr. Scott Meschke (University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA) gifted both MS2 phage and S. Typhimurium LT2. MS2 phage was propagated in an Escherichia coli F amp+ strain as previously described [29] , harvested from the soft agar overlay, filtered through a 0.22 \u03bcm filter (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), and stocks stored at 4\u02daC until use.

The data from the SP and BL panels extracted by the MagNaPure (CDC) closely correlated with the Qiagen (PATH) data with a +/-2 variance observed between the mean C t values (Table 2) . However, the stool panel data showed greater variance. Although the MS2 C t values were similar between the CDC and PATH results (Table 2) , less S. Typhimurium DNA was detected in the CDC NA extracts from the mid-and high-spiked ST panel members, with no amplification detected in the low-spiked samples. This may be due to PATH using two separate Qiagen kits to extract DNA and RNA respectively, from stool in order to optimize NA recoveries. The CDC laboratory performed a single total NA extraction method with the MagNaPure that incorporated a brief centrifugation of liquefied stool samples to reduce debris prior to extraction. This centrifugation step may explain the differences seen in S. Typhimurium DNA levels, as many of the bacterial cells would likely have been removed in this step. With the exception of S. Typhimurium, the CDC results verified the target NAs levels in all panels ( Table 1 ) and indicated that both the Qiagen and MagNaPure methods used in either laboratory gave typically similar RT-PCR results.

With MS2, developer A extracts gave consistently lower C t values than the reference data indicating the most effective purification overall.

RT-PCR on the extracts from developer B correctly identified the majority of replicates spiked with MS2, but surprisingly, many of the unspiked sample extracts also scored RT-PCR positive (Table 2) , resulting in poor specificity for this panel. Upon investigation it was discovered that developer B routinely used MS2 in other development work in their laboratory, so it is possible that reagents were contaminated with MS2 phage or MS2-related amplicons.

Stool samples required longer processing times for developers C and E (30 and 20 minutes respectively) as compared to sputum or blood, due to additional steps to liquefy and clarify stool before the NA extraction step (Fig 1) . This was also evident with the work stream for developer C who required only three operator steps for sputum and blood, yet eight for stool. Protocols from four developers included ten operator steps for stool sample processing, reflecting that these technologies are relatively early in workflow development or are less integrated compared to others. The protocol with the shortest turnaround time (developer B) had the most hands-on steps and the poorest overall performance.

The inclusion of turnaround times (TAT) and manual steps into the ASSUR dataset were the underlying reasons for Molbio (F) moving ahead of Akonni Biosystems (A) A. Molbio also had good performance but also a more rapid TAT (35 minutes versus 55 minutes) and fewer user steps than the Akonni methodology and so was awarded higher ranking via the radar plot analyses (Fig 1) . Both of these developers use systems that are automated to differing degrees with the Molbio platform hosting a cassette that processes the sample preparation steps [33, 34] . The data from other developers such as B also improved, primarily due to the incorporation of the fastest TATs to augment their relatively poor performance data ( Table 2 and Fig 1) . In light of these findings, the technologies offered by Akonni and Molbio have the best scores for consideration to enter the next stage of assessment for integration into a fully automated stand-alone NAAT platform.",

These technologies are in various phases of product development, ranging from alpha prototypes to products that are on or close to market (e.g. Akonni and Molbio). Therefore, poorer performance may simply reflect that the devices or methods are still being refined. Several of the developers also noted that they normally use different protocols and materials for extracting RNA or DNA, and thus had to make some modifications to co-extract both DNA and RNA to meet a requirement of a potential integrated NAAT. Consequently, some technologies may have been suboptimal under the conditions imposed for this study. We investigated the diagnostic performance and workflow of these technologies by challenging them with three panels of contrived samples representing common specimen types used in the NAAT-based diagnosis of multiple pathogens: 1) sputum (tuberculosis); 2) stool (diarrheal diseases, e.g. Shigella spp.); and 3) blood (e.g. HIV, malaria, and typhoid). Target microbes were spiked at different concentrations to assess the effectiveness of the different NA extraction methods across a range of target burdens within a complex matrix. In each panel, two spiked microbes were selected to evaluate the efficiency of extraction from both DNA-and RNA-based genomic targets. While the reference methods typically gave the best results, the Akonni platform had better performance with certain target pathogens. Akonni is heavily invested in MTB diagnostic NAATs and so their best in class performance for MTB likely reflects their expertise in this area [35] [36] [37] .",

Two methods were used to score the developers relative to each other. One was based solely on performance (i.e. sensitivity and specificity) and the other included the turnaround time, number of manual steps and the estimated cost per extraction. Based on performance, Akonni (developer A) ranked highest with five of the six targets used in the three specimen panels. The Akonni platform is partially Table 4 . The ranking of each developers based on analyses of radial plot values. The five data points for each ASSUR radial data point were equally weighted and the averaged data within each plot was calculated as compared to optimal ASSUR plot values of 1.0 (Fig 2) . The developers were ranked for each of the three sample panels and overall via the average of the pooled values for both targets per sample panel and for all six targets for overall. The developers were ranked in ascending order.

Negative and positive air pressure is used to manipulate liquid lysed material and buffers across the frit to sequentially capture, wash and elute NAs from a sample using an automated pipettor [33, 40] . Molbio and developer E ranked second and third, respectively, but did not consistently detect all NA replicates in the lowest spiked samples. The Molbio platform is the Trueprep AUTO, a battery powered instrument that hosts a cartridge-based extraction system that utilizes Boom chemistry to capture and purify NAs [41] . Observed specificity for most methods was relatively uniform among five of the six technologies but only one developer (C) scored 100%. As with any laboratory procedure, it is possible that contamination of specimens or extracts occurred during preparation, processing, handling, or testing, as observed with MS2 in extracts from developer B. The risk of operatorintroduced contamination is lower when automated systems are used and was observed with the both Akonni and Molbio platforms that have varying degrees of automation [33, 34] . Good laboratory practices for molecular testing laboratories were followed by all laboratories to minimize the potential for contamination of specimens, extracts, or PCR reactions in order to ensure integrity of results.",

It is feasible that with protocol refinement and automation these challenges can be addressed as the ideal test operation must have minimal or no user inputs.

Firstly, because the stool and blood used to generate contrived samples were acquired from single individuals, these may not represent the often challenging heterogeneity seen with samples from different patients. Further, the composition of sputum and typically stool from healthy donors is not representative of the same matrices during the course of an active infection (e.g. presence of blood). Although the RNA and DNA-based microbes used for spiking provided a standardized means to assess differences in extraction efficiency of the various technologies, some targets, such as the chemically inactivated M. tuberculosis cells, may not represent the same challenge to cell lysis as live mycobacteria. Similarly, S. pneumoniae is prone to autolysis when cultured to late growth phase and so the cells prepared for spiking may have been partially compromised during their culture, harvesting or storage. This study was focused on NA extraction efficiency in terms of detecting specific target NAs but did not address matrix effects associated with potential inhibitory compounds that could affect the performance of the RT-PCR reactions [20, 22, 26] . It is feasible that some low ranked methods were highly efficient at extracting NAs but an associated co-purification of confounders masked the former by inhibiting amplification by RT-PCR. While variation in C t values was used to semi-quantitatively assess NA extraction efficiencies, the wide range of sample input and elution volumes used by the different methods makes it difficult to directly compare and normalize extraction efficiencies.",

The Akonni Biosystems and Molbio ranked best via either scoring method. Both companies have NA extraction products on the market and so this exercise highlights a basic fact that products validated for release onto the market typically have better performance than a prototype that is still in development. Several key elements necessary to meet this goal were beyond the scope of this study, including design for manufacturing. While multiple features can be integrated into a single test cartridge, increased design complexity typically raises manufacturing costs and/or failure modes. One area of future investigation is to optimize for the maximum volume of eluate for amplification and detection such that the eluate or an aliquot thereof is the only liquid necessary to add to lyophilized amplification reagents. A parallel evaluation of suitable candidates for NA amplification was recently completed and is presented in a companion manuscript [42] . Ultimately, we intend to assess the most suitable methods for both NA extraction and amplification/detection for integration and potentially enable the development of a lowcost point of care NAAT that meets the clinical and economic challenges for use in RLS.",
