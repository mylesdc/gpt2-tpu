This study aimed to investigate the relationship between white blood cell counts and haptoglobin (Hp) and serum amyloid A (SAA) levels in post-weaned calves with diarrhea caused by BCoV and those that recovered from diarrhea. Blood and fecal samples were collected twice from the same animals; 17 postweaned calves with diarrhea (first) and 15 post-weaned calves that recovered from diarrhea (second). Real-time polymerase chain reaction revealed that all 17 fecal samples from post-weaned calves with diarrhea and one out of 15 from diarrhea-recovered calves were positive for BCoV and negative for Cryptosporidium spp., Escherichia coli K99, Salmonella spp., bovine rotavirus, and bovine viral diarrhea virus. No Eimeria oocysts were detected using the flotation method. In comparison with post-weaned calves with diarrhea, in diarrhea-recovered calves, the lymphocyte count was significantly higher (P = 0.018), and the monocyte count was significantly lower (P = 0.001); however, the number of monocytes was still high. Post-weaned calves with diarrhea had a significantly higher Hp concentration (P < 0.001) compared with diarrhea-recovered calves. The results indicated that increased Hp concentration and monocytosis but not SAA may be associated with diarrhea caused by BCoV. The present study suggests that the monitoring of Hp concentration and monocyte count is useful in the diagnosis of post-weaned calves with diarrhea caused by BCoV in this field.",

BCoV is the causative agent of severe diarrhea in calves, winter dysentery in adult cattle, and respiratory disease in cattle of all ages [1, 2] . Infection leads to high morbidity, but usually low mortality rates. BCoV infection causes severe problems in cattle of various age groups, resulting in significant economic losses by affecting the weight gain or milk production. Clinical signs begin approximately 2 days after exposure and last for 3-6 days. Typically, BCoV infection in calves causes profuse watery diarrhea, and the feces can contain blood. BCoV replicates in the epithelial cells of colonic crypts, destroying the villi and leading to the degeneration, necrosis of the crypt epithelium, and petechial hemorrhage; this could result in severe, often hemorrhagic diarrhea in calves, which can be life-threatening due to the loss of electrolytes and malnutrition [2] [3] [4] .",

The leukocyte, neutrophil, lymphocyte, and eosinophil counts were within reference ranges for post-weaned calves with diarrhea and those that recovered from diarrhea, whereas the monocyte count was above the reference range in both groups ( Table 1 ). The delta measurements (values of post-weaned calves with diarrhea minus those of recovered calves) for lymphocyte and monocyte counts were significantly different in recovered calves. The total number of WBCs has been reported to decrease with age in cattle [14] . Previous studies have shown that from 4 to 6 months of age, the mean neutrophil count gradually declined, whereas the mean lymphocyte count had an increasing trend [15] . These findings are consistent with our results. There is a lack of data of the dynamics of different blood parameters for calves at this age range; however, in the present study, all WBCs except for monocytes were within the normal reference range [16] . The reason for the increase in monocytes is unclear in the present study. Nevertheless, a previous study showed that monocytosis could occur during exposure to acute stress and in the healing phase of acute and chronic infections [14] . However, the monocyte counts vary in cattle and thus are not a reliable indicator of a specific disease [17] . Further studies are needed to explore the association between monocytes and acute phase response (APR) and to evaluate the proinflammatory cytokines in animals infected with diarrhea.",

Hp concentration was higher in the post-weaned calves with diarrhea (932.0 \u00b1 172.0 mg/L) than in the same calves recovered from diarrhea (162.2 \u00b1 35.7 mg/L). Hp was 5.7fold higher in post-weaned calves with diarrhea than in those that recovered from diarrhea. There was a significant difference in Hp concentration (P < 0.001) between post-weaned calves with diarrhea and recovered calves. Moreover, the concentration of SAA in post-weaned calves with diarrhea (46.2 \u00b1 7.6 mg/L) was higher in recovered calves (28.5 \u00b1 7.4 mg/L). SAA was increased 1.6-fold in post-weaned calves with diarrhea compared to the recovered calves; however, this increase was not statistically significant. The results showed that postweaned calves with diarrhea had a significant increased Hp concentration. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report the relationship between Hp concentration and BCoV infection. Our findings are consistent with those of previous studies, which reported that Hp is a major APP in cattle [6, 18] . SAA has been identified as an APP in various species [6] . However, compared with Hp, changes in SAA were less pronounced in post-weaned calves with diarrhea in this Table 1 Normal reference values were established with data obtained from Schalm's Veterinary Hematology [16] Data are presented as the mean \u00b1 SEM. P values were obtained by Wilcoxon's rank-sum test to compare post-weaned calves with diarrhea and diarrhea-recovered calves (* P < 0.05 and ** P < 0.01)",

SAA has been reported to be more sensitive to stress than disease [19] [20] [21] . Although the number of samples used was limited and a definitive conclusion could not be provided, SAA may be less suitable for the assessment of cattle health, particularly for cattle with diarrhea caused by BCoV. Normally, the concentration of APPs increases when a disease develops and decreases during recovery [22] . However, in our study, SAA neither increased significantly in post-weaned calves with diarrhea nor did it decrease significantly during recovery. Taken together, the results suggested that serum Hp concentration may be a useful diagnostic indicator to differentiate between healthy and diseased animals. Further studies are needed to evaluate the association between other APPs (fibrinogen and \u03b1 1 acid glycoprotein) and diarrhea caused by BCoV.",
