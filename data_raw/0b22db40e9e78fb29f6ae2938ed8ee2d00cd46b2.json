            "text": "Prior studies of clay-virus interactions have focused on the stability and infectivity of nonenveloped viruses, yielding contradictory results. We hypothesize that the surface charge distribution of the clay and virus envelope dictates how the components react and affect aggregation, viral stability, and infectivity. The bacteriophage Cystoviridae species \u03c66 used in this study is a good model for enveloped pathogens. The interaction between \u03c66 and montmorillonite (MMT) clay (the primary component of bentonite) is explored by transmission electron microscopy. The analyses show that MMT-\u03c66 mixtures undergo heteroaggregation, forming structures in which virtually all the virions are either sequestered between MMT platelet layers or attached to platelet edges. The virions swell and undergo disassembly resulting in partial or total envelope loss. Edgeattached viral envelopes distort to increase contact area with the positively charged platelet edges indicating that the virion surface is negatively charged. The nucleocapsid (NCs) remaining after envelope removal also exhibit distortion, in contrast to detergent-produced NCs which exhibit no distortion. This visually discernible disassembly is a mechanism for loss of infectivity previously unreported by studies of nonenveloped viruses. The MMT-mediated sequestration and disassembly result in reduced infectivity, suggesting that clays may reduce infectivity of enveloped pathogenic viruses in soils and sediments.",

Clays are a primary nonorganic component of soils and aquatic sediments, therefore the dynamic interactions between clay minerals and phage are expected to affect soil-bacteria activity (Ostle and Holt 1979; Vettori et al. 1999; Weinbauer and Rassoulzadegan 2004; Syngouna and Chrysikopoulos 2010) . Montmorillonite (MMT) is a highly reactive, expandable, hydrous aluminum smectite clay. Smectite platelets are positively charged at the edges and negatively charged along the faces to produce an overall negative charge at pH > 3. Clays readily form colloidal suspensions that have the potential to interact with dispersed viral particles which influences the aggregate structure.",

Numerous studies on the interaction between viruses and clays have yielded conflicting information regarding the effect of clay minerals on virus survival and infectivity; see Jin and Flury (2002) or Kimura et al. (2008) for reviews. The contradictory findings in the literature imply that virus morphology plays a role in the interaction with clays. To our knowledge, published studies on the interactions between clays and viruses have only investigated nonenveloped viruses, although a number of pathogenic viruses found in the environment are enveloped (e.g., avian influenza, coronavirus). Enveloped viruses differ from nonenveloped viruses in that they possess a lipid-protein layer surrounding the nucleocapsid (NC). Cystoviridae, a bacteriophage family that infects the plant pathogen, Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola, is one of the few phage families with an external lipid envelope. Cystoviridae species are often used as a model for enveloped animal and human pathogens (Mindich 1988 (Mindich , 2004 .",

Roper and Marshall (1974) found that at low salinity, MMT particles surrounded Escherichia coli bacteria resulting in greater protection from phage than under higher salinity conditions. Roper and Marshall (1978) determined that MMT inhibited infection of E. coli and that finer suspended clay particles provided the E. coli with greater protection from phage by forming a barrier around the bacteria. However, they found that particles greater than 0.6 lm in diameter offered no protection. Lipson and Stotzky (1984) observed that several proteins (lysozyme, chymotrypsin, and ovalbumin) reduced the adsorption of reoviruses to MMT, likely a result of the proteins competing for adsorption sites on the clay. In contrast, kaolinite and MMT enhanced \u03c6X174 infection of E. coli (Lipson and Alsmadi 1989) . Zeph et al. (1988) determined that MMT protected phage P1 from inactivation, although the presence of MMT had no effect on transduction of E. coli. Vettori et al. (2000) found that clay minerals protect phage PBS1 from inactivation and loss of ability to transduce Bacillus subtilis by UV light.",

(1983a,b) investigated the interaction of poliovirus with nonaggregated MMT, and through scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis determined that the negatively charged virions adhere to the positively charged MMT edges. They also suggested that clay aggregation accompanies adsorption of poliovirus and that the MMT enhances poliovirus survival (Vilker et al. 1983a,b) . Stotzky (1983, 1986) showed that viruses (e.g., poliovirus, coxsackie virus, reovirus) are adsorbed onto clays with enhanced survivability. The adsorption of reovirus onto MMT or kaolinite was almost immediate and correlated with the cation exchange capacity of the clays (Lipson and Stotzky 1983) . This indicates that reovirus adsorbs onto negatively charged regions of the clays. Lipson and Stotzky (1985) found that coliphage T1 and reovirus type 3 adsorb onto different sites on kaolinite and MMT. They also investigated mixtures of kaolinite and reovirus and determined that these were more infectious than equivalent concentrations of virus alone and attributed the increased infectivity to improved viral transport in the presence of kaolinite.",

            "text": "The seemingly contradictory effects of clays on virus survivability are likely a result of differences in the mechanisms behind the clay-virus interactions. Although the literature has focused on the effect of environmental conditions (clay type, clay charge distribution [Lipson and Stotzky 1985; Christian et al. 2006; Templeton et al. 2008] , pH [Zhuang and Jin 2008; Walshe et al. 2010 ], ionic strength [Tong et al. 2012] , buffer composition [Zhuang and Jin 2008; Gutierrez et al. 2010] , and cation exchange capacity [Lipson and Stotzky 1983; Vettori et al. 1999] ), the surface morphology of viruses has been largely ignored. The attachment of phages T1, T7, T2, PBS1, or \u03c6X174 to cation exchanged clay is related to positively charged sites on clay edges (Schiffenbauer and Stotzky 1982; Chattopadhyay and Puls 1999; Vettori et al. 2000) . However, Lipson and Stotzky (1983) found that reovirus adsorption occurs at negatively charged sites on cation exchanged kaolinite and MMT, consistent with Derjaguin, Landau, Verwey, Overbeek (DLVO) (Derjaguin and Landau 1941; Verwey and Overbeek 1948) theory of colloidal aggregation. Rossi and Aragno (1999) found that colloidal aggregation of phage T7 and MMT results in reversible binding and protection from inactivation. Phages MS2 and \u03c6X174 attach to kaolinite and MMT by hydrophobic interactions (Chrysikopoulos and Syngouna 2012). Chattopadhyay and Puls (2000) studied the different forces involved in phage (T2, MS2, \u03c6X174) sorption on soil particles (hectorite, kaolinite, and Norman clay) and found that van der Waals attraction dominated over electrostatic repulsion.",

A minimal amount of stain was employed to reduce the effect of the stain on abundant viral proteins, which would impede identification of viral particles. TEM grids were prepared using \u03c66 concentrations of 10 11 virions mL \uf02d1 and MMT concentration of 1.7 mg mL \u00c01 . Electron micrographs were acquired at the New York Structural Biology Center with either a Jeol 2100 (Jeol Inc., Peabody, MA) or a Tecnai FEI 20 (FEI, Hillsborough, OR) electron microscope, both operating at 200 kV. For the Jeol 2100, micrographs were acquired at magnifications of 30,0009 or 50,0009 giving pixel sizes of 0.511 or 0.306 nm/pixel, respectively, on the 2k 9 2k CCD. For the Tecnai F20, micrographs were acquired at magnifications of 29,0009 or 50,0009 giving pixel sizes of 0.592 or 0.340 nm/pixel, respectively, after 2 9 2 binning of the 4k 9 4k CCD. Isolated \u03c66 virions and NCs are nearly spherical in shape and when negatively stained will appear in electron micrographs as~70 nm and~57 nm circles, respectively. \u03c66 virions have a clearly defined envelope that appears as a lower density region under negative staining. The NC outer icosahedral shell also appears as a brighter region in the micrographs when negatively stained. Classification of intact \u03c66 virions and MMT-induced, enveloped-stripped NCs (MMT-NC) was determined by size and shape analysis. Particles exhibiting nearly circular shape in the micrographs with a diameter between 68 nm and 75 nm were classified as nondistorted \u03c66. Nearly circular particles with diameters between 55 and 63 nm diameters were classified as nondistorted MMT-NCs. Virions deviating from circularity were classified as complete but distorted \u03c66 if the larger diameter was greater than 68 nm, or distorted MMT-NCs if the larger diameter was less than 63 nm.",

The micrograph in Figure 1A shows~10 2 \u03c66 virions with diameter 69 AE 2 nm for over 95% of the particles. The vast majority of the virions in Figure 1A exhibit aspect ratios near unity (1.08 AE 0.07), confirming the spherical morphology of the particles. Only two NC particles with diameters of 57 nm (labeled NC in Fig. 1A ) are present in the field of view, confirming that the \u03c66 envelope rarely spontaneously disassembles. Very few partially disassembled \u03c66 are visible in the micrograph. Although NC particles are icosahedral, the NC particles appear spherical at the resolution of the Figure 1B micrograph. The vast majority of the NCs in Figure 1B have a diameter of 57 AE 2 nm and aspect ratios near unity (1.05 AE 0.02). Therefore, size and aspect ratio clearly distinguish intact \u03c66 and NCs and can be used to gauge morphological changes in the virions as a result of interactions with suspended MMT. Figure 2 shows a representative TEM micrograph of MMT platelets. The clay platelets exhibit a sheet-like structure (platelet face) which in the TEM aggregate results in a mosaic of sharp angular forms with discrete edges. The arrow in Figure 2 indicates parallel edges which is indicative of platelet stacking. The platelet faces exhibit a mottled texture and lack geometric characteristics similar to those of viral particles.",

In all the TEM grids, the entire \u03c66 phage population is sequestered within aggregates. A majority of the virions are sandwiched between platelets and partially obscured due to masking by thin MMT sheets. However, a noticeable fraction of the \u03c66 are attached to the edges of the platelets and are clearly discernible in the micrographs. A preponderance of edge-attached and face-attached virions exhibits extensive distortion in shape, in contrast to the uniformity of particles shown in Figure 1A and B. The presence of smaller (~60-nm-diameter) particles in the micrographs is interpreted as clear evidence of disassembled envelopes leaving only NCs. Approximately third of the \u03c66 in the micrographs are completely stripped of their envelopes and are morphologically similar in size to distorted NC particles. The microscopy evidence therefore reveals that the interaction with MMT results in the disassembly of the \u03c66 envelope.",

This attraction is consistent with DLVO theory of colloidal aggregation. The attachment of virions to the positively charged edges likely includes both electrostatic and van der Waals interactions. A TEM micrograph (Fig. 3) shows a population of \u03c66 in varying states of disassembly, and embedded in two well-defined clay particles. Top plateleta distorted \u03c66 virion (dashed arrow) and several MMT-NCs (solid arrows) appear embedded within layers of clay at position labeled A. The particles near the platelet edge (far upper right) are distinctly smaller than triton-isolated NCs indicating partial disassembly. Bottom plateleta distorted 57 nm MMT-NC attached to the clay edge is evident (particle labeled B). The MMT-NC distortion increases the contact area between the particle and the positively charged MMT edge, suggesting that the outer surface of the P8 protein shell acquired a negative charge during disassembly. A number of distorted \u03c66 (four are noted by dashed arrows) and MMT-NCs (five are noted by solid arrows) are located between platelets. A highly distorted virion (particle labeled C) is shown in inset C; particle size is 93 9 56 nm, corresponding to an aspect ratio of 1.7. The deformed virions indicate that either the envelope disassembly increases particle size as water infiltrates the lipid-protein membrane or compression of virions between platelets has caused distortion. The particle labeled D and shown in inset is nearly circular with a diameter~57 AE 1 nm indicating that the envelope has been completely removed. Figure 4 shows an aggregate of clay platelets and partially disassembled virions (dashed arrows) and MMT-NCs (solid arrows). A pair of fused virions is observed in the micrograph (the elongated shape labeled A, at the bottom center). Distorted \u03c66 and MMT-NCs are congregated near platelet edges (upper left of micrograph, labeled B, C, and D), further evidence that \u03c66 particles 100 nm are sequestered in the MMT aggregates. Other virions with disrupted envelopes (E, F, G, H, and K), as well as deformed MMT-NCs (I, J, and L), are readily observable. The magnified inset depicts the repeating tetrahedraloctahedral MMT layering, visible when platelets are viewed edge-on. In this view, virions are shown to preferentially aggregate along the positive edges and wedged between vertically oriented platelets.",

            "text": "\u03c66 adhered to MMT edges exhibits a distinct oval shape in which the major axis is parallel to the edges, increasing contact area between the virion and the platelet edges. The increased contact suggests that the positively charged edge of the MMT is electrostatically interacting with the negatively charged virus. Two such virions are seen in the TEM micrograph shown in Figure 5A . A tracing of the outer boundary and the internal MMT-NC of virions labeled #1 and #2 are presented in the respective insets, B and C, respectively. Virion #1 has a shorter axis normal to the platelet edge (71 nm), which corresponds to the diameter of an undistorted virion. However, the elongated axis stretches to 92 nm resulting in an aspect ratio of 1.3. In contrast to virions interlayered with platelets (Fig. 4) , where the distortion may be due to either expansion in two or three dimensions, the departure from sphericity noted here includes a volume increase. The boundary layer that includes the envelope (bright border) between MMT-NC and the outer surface of the virion is of variable thickness, as much as 17 nm, compared to the 6 nm envelope thickness reported by Kenney et al. (1992) , suggesting that water is infiltrating the virion. Virion #2, while not appreciably different in size than an undistorted virion, deviates significantly from a spherical form. The envelope of virion #2 at the platelet edge also appeared to have undergone disassembly. The thicker region between the envelope and MMT-NC at the upper part of #2 may have resulted primarily from distortion or water absorption between the envelope and NC. The MMT-NC in virion #2 departs dramatically from a spheroidal geometry.",

In the present case, the NC particles are roughly circular with a 57 nm diameter, that is, nearly identical in appearance to detergent-isolated NC particles. As the detergent-isolated NC particles in the aggregates retain their original morphology, the interaction with the clay is likely weaker than that between the MMT and the partially disassembled virions. This is consistent with the hydrophobic interactions reported for nonenveloped viruses Puls 1999, 2000; Chrysikopoulos and Syngouna 2012) .

The comparable band intensities in lanes 5 and 6, in conjunction with the absence of NC protein bands in lane 6, demonstrate that the NC is also almost totally sequestered in the MMT aggregate without noticeable hydrolysis of viral proteins.

In other words, more than 99.99% of the virions are in the pellet. This is in agreement with the TEM and SDS-PAGE analysis. Figure 8 plots the reduction in \u03c66 infectivity relative to a virus control (no MMT) for a range of ratios of MMT to \u03c66. For the 0.2 lm MMT fraction used in these experiments, a MMT platelet has a mass of~10 fg, yielding about~10 11 platelets mg \u00c01 . At virus concentrations exceeding the number of platelets, moderate loss of infectivity (20-95%) was observed. At virus concentrations lower than the number of platelets, infectivity is reduced by a factor of 10 \u00c01.5 -10 \u00c05 , where the least amount of loss of infectivity corresponded to smaller amounts of clay and the larger degree of loss corresponded to larger amounts of clay. The variation in infectivity loss at comparable platelet and virion populations (10 \u00c09 -10 \u00c011 mg of MMT per virion) may be due to aggregation dynamics affecting the probability of virion-clay contact. This loss of infectivity resulted from either the partial disassembly or complete removal of the envelope. Since essentially all the \u03c66 aggregates with the MMT independently of virion concentration, the differences in infectivity under different relative concentration can be directly attributed to the probability of direct contact between virions and platelets. At relatively lower \u03c66 concentration, the probability that virions are in direct contact with platelets increases, resulting in greater envelope disassembly. However, at higher \u03c66 concentrations, many of the virions are more likely to only be in direct contact with other virions rather than platelets and thus less likely to experience envelope disassembly.",

            "text": "Interactions between colloidal clay and suspended viral particles result in the stripping of the viral envelope and a consequent loss of infectivity of the phage \u03c66. As viral particles become embedded in growing clay aggregates, virions continue to be scavenged from the aqueous medium. TEM captures images of the \u03c66 virions in varying states of envelope disassembly. The extensive shape distortion exhibited by the edge-bound \u03c66 virions indicates that the forces are stronger than those binding the face-attached virions. This observation suggests that an electrostatic interaction is involved. The sandwiched virions are likely held preferentially by van der Waals forces to the negatively charged platelet faces as prescribed by DLVO theory. Both binding mechanisms contribute to the disassembly and swelling of virions and indicate that the envelope is pliable. The irreversible loss of infectivity through the process of envelope disassembly by MMT is a novel and previously unreported mechanism and is relevant to predicting the response of pathogenic enveloped viruses to clays in the environment.",
