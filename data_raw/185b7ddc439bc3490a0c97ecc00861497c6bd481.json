            "text": "The essential requirement of the lymphotoxin beta receptor (LT\u03b2R) in the development and maintenance of peripheral lymphoid organs is well recognized. Evidence shows that LT\u03b2R is involved in various cellular processes; however, whether it plays a role in maintaining the cellular function of intestinal porcine enterocytes (IPEC-J2), specifically during porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infection, remains unknown. In this study, we generated LT\u03b2R null IPEC-J2 cells using CRISPR/Cas9 to examine the importance of LT\u03b2R in cell proliferation, apoptosis, and the response to PEDV infection. Our results showed that the lack of LT\u03b2R leads to significantly decreased cell proliferation, potentially due to S phase arrest in LT\u03b2R \u2212/\u2212 IPEC-J2 cells. Label-free digital holographic microscopy was used to record the three-dimensional morphology of both cell types for up to 72 hours and revealed significantly increased numbers of LT\u03b2R \u2212/\u2212 cells undergoing apoptosis. Furthermore, we found that PEDV-infected LT\u03b2R \u2212/\u2212 null IPEC-J2 cells exhibited significant suppression of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF\u03baB) target genes (interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8) and mucosal barrier integrity-related genes (vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1) and IL-22), which may explain why LT\u03b2R \u2212/\u2212 cells are more susceptible to PEDV infection. Collectively, our data not only demonstrate the key role of LT\u03b2R in intestinal porcine enterocytes, but also provide data for the improved understanding of the cellular response to PEDV infection.",

The L1 and L3 small guide RNA (sgRNA) genome targeting sequences, (L1: 5 -GGGAATGGCGGGCCTCTTGGTTT-3 ; L3: 5 -GAAGGTGCTCCCTTACCGCCCGG-3 ), were cloned into the pX330 vector as previously described [16] . IPEC-J2 cells were transfected by nucleofection using an Amaxa TM Nucleofector TM Kit (Lonza, Cologne, Germany). The pCAG-GFP plasmid was cotransfected with the pX330 plasmid as an indicator for fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were subjected to FACS sorting based on the expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) fluorescence. Single cells were plated into each well of 96-well plates and cultured for approximately 10 days in cell culture medium supplemented with 2.5 ng/mL basic fibroblast growth factor (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). The medium was replaced every 3 days. Confluent cell colonies were propagated and subjected to PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) assays. PCR products (411 bp) were digested with AciI (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) and the restriction fragments were analyzed on a 2% agarose gel. The identified biallelic mutant clones were subjected for sequencing analysis.",

To determine CRISPR-CAS9-mediated mutations, 96 colonies were selected and subjected to RFLP analysis ( Figure 2B ). Our data showed that 10 cell clones were biallelically mutated, and the targeting efficiency was 10.4% ( Figure 2B ,C). To further validate the biallelic mutation, five cell clones, 1-10#, 1-19#, 1-22#, 2-3# and 6-18#, were randomly selected for DNA sequencing (Supplementary Figure S1) , and the results confirmed those of RFLP. Further, the amino acid sequences from the wild-type 1-10# cell clone were compared, and our results demonstrated the shifted mutation in both alleles (Supplementary Figure S2) .",

As shown in Figure 3A , the in vitro proliferation of LT\u03b2R \u2212/\u2212 cells was significantly inhibited at 48 h (0.387 \u00b1 0.023 vs. 0.189 \u00b1 0.018 for LT\u03b2R +/+ and LT\u03b2R \u2212/\u2212 cells, respectively, p < 0.01) and 72 h (0.633 \u00b1 0.062 vs. 0.370 \u00b1 0.027 for LT\u03b2R +/+ and LT\u03b2R \u2212/\u2212 cells, respectively, p < 0.05), suggesting the ablation of LT\u03b2R inhibited IPEC-J2 cell proliferation. In addition, semi-quantitative PCR was used to detect the expression level of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a cell proliferation marker. Consistently, semi-quantitative PCR results showed that PCNA was down-regulated in LT\u03b2R \u2212/\u2212 cells ( Figure 3B ). These results suggest that the knockout of LT\u03b2R reduces cell growth in vitro. Since cell growth is tightly regulated by a series of regulators of the cell cycle [18] , the effects of LT\u03b2R on cell cycle progression were analyzed by flow cytometry using propidium iodide staining. Our data demonstrated S phase arrest in LT\u03b2R \u2212/\u2212 cells, which resulted in a significant population increase of S phase cells (16.715% \u00b1 0.345 vs. 24.09% \u00b1 0.045 for LT\u03b2R +/+ and LT\u03b2R \u2212/\u2212 cells, respectively, p < 0.01) and a dramatic decrease of G2 phase cells (28.12% \u00b1 0.33 vs. 22.74% \u00b1 0.36 for LT\u03b2R +/+ and LT\u03b2R \u2212/\u2212 cells, respectively, p < 0.01) ( Figure 3C,D) . Cell cycle progression is regulated by a complex network of cell cycle-related genes [19] . Since LT\u03b2R \u2212/\u2212 cells were arrested at the S phase, the expression of cyclin E1, a key gene in the G1 to S phase transition, was measured by semi-quantitative PCR. The results revealed substantially higher expression levels of cyclin E1 in LT\u03b2R \u2212/\u2212 cells than in LT\u03b2R +/+ cells ( Figure 3E ).",

A large portfolio of quantitative morphological parameters, including optical cell volume, thickness, area, irregularity, eccentricity, and single-cell tracking, can be recorded and analyzed [20] . Here, digital holographic microscopy was used to monitor dynamic activities and morphological changes of LT\u03b2R +/+ and LT\u03b2R \u2212/\u2212 cells in real-time for up to 72 hours. The results showed that these cells displayed distinct growth characteristics. Specifically, many more LT\u03b2R null cells than LT\u03b2R +/+ cells exhibited increased cell volume (vertical axis) and decreased cell membrane thickness (horizontal axis) ( Figure 4A , cells between the red lines). Figure 4B shows the 3D structures of observed living LT\u03b2R +/+ cells ( Figure 4B , left) and LT\u03b2R \u2212/\u2212 cells ( Figure 4B, right) . Clearly, LT\u03b2R \u2212/\u2212 cells with a white color are apoptotic because the flow of liquids through apoptotic cell membranes (permeability malfunction) leads to increased cell volume, and the lightened cell membranes therefore reflect different colors. Next, because we found that the knockout of LT\u03b2R induces apoptosis, we investigated apoptosis-related genes in both types of cells. q-PCR was performed to examine the expression levels of apoptosis-related genes, including TNF superfamily member 10 (TNFSF10) and Caspase 3 (CASP3), in both cell lines. Our data revealed that these two genes were significantly increased in LT\u03b2R \u2212/\u2212 cells ( Figure 4C ).",

As such, we investigated the effects of LT\u03b2R on PEDV infections in IPEC-J2 cells. We challenged LT\u03b2R +/+ and LT\u03b2R \u2212/\u2212 cells with the PEDV CV777 strain (at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1), and cells were harvested 48 h later to determine the relative viral expression level by real-time PCR using PEDV-specific primers. Our data showed that RNA levels of PEDV in LT\u03b2R \u2212/\u2212 IPEC-J2 cells were significantly higher than those in wild-type IPEC-J2 cells ( Figure 5A ). Since PEDV infection destroys epithelial barrier integrity [22] , and LT\u03b2R signaling was reported to limit mucosal damage through the IL-22-IL-23 pathway [10] , we examined the expression levels of LT\u03b2R downstream genes by semi-quantitative PCR, including VCAM1, IL-22 and IL-23, in PEDV-infected cells. Our data revealed that VCAM1 and IL-22 expression was substantially decreased in LT\u03b2R \u2212/\u2212 IPEC-J2 cells, while IL-23 was intact ( Figure 5B ). The NF\u03baB-dependent genes IL-6 and IL-8 are reported to be induced by activation of LT\u03b2R signaling [4, 23] . We detected expression levels of IL-6 and IL-8 in infected cells, and the data showed that both genes were significantly decreased in infected LT\u03b2R \u2212/\u2212 IPEC-J2 cells ( Figure 5C ). ",

Specifically, LT\u03b2R expression was significantly lower in the duodenum than in other intestinal sections.

In this study, we successfully generated LT\u03b2R null cells using the CRISPR/Cas9 technique, as evidenced by the low expression at both the mRNA and protein levels. The gene targeting efficiency was determined, and the biallelic mutated clone reached 10.4%. Further, our data showed that cell proliferation was significantly inhibited in LT\u03b2R null cells, suggesting that LT\u03b2R-mediated signaling is required to maintain IPEC-J2 cell proliferation. In agreement with this result, the increased viability of LIGHT-stimulated human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) was observed [24] . Cell proliferation is closely associated with the cell cycle. We performed cell cycle analysis with both cell lines using propidium iodide staining, and the ablation of LT\u03b2R prevents cells from completing the G2/S phase transition, so the cells in the S phase significantly increased. Consistent with these results, expression levels of the S phase marker cyclin E1 were high in LT\u03b2R null cells. From these results, we speculate that LT\u03b2R knockout prevents cells from exiting the S phase, which leads to growth inhibition in IPEC-J2 cells.",

            "text": "It has been demonstrated that LT\u03b2R plays an important role in cell death via caspase-dependent and -independent pathways [25, 26] . In this study, we video monitored LT\u03b2R +/+ and LT\u03b2R \u2212/\u2212 cells for up to 72 h by digital holographic microscopy. Compared to other strategies that measure cell death and apoptosis, such as the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay, digital holographic microscopy allows the visualization of real-time morphological alterations in cells and has become a powerful tool for the evaluation of cell responses to various stimuli with no labeling required [20] . The 3D images allowed the visualization of apoptotic cells, and the number of tall cells was increased in the LT\u03b2R \u2212/\u2212 cell population, indicating that more LT\u03b2R \u2212/\u2212 cells than LT\u03b2R +/+ cells underwent apoptosis. Furthermore, we observed that the apoptotic-related genes TNFSF10 and CASP3 were significantly increased in LT\u03b2R \u2212/\u2212 cells, further confirming that the knockout of LT\u03b2R induced the apoptosis of IPEC-J2 cells. Interestingly, in contrast from our observations, Wu et al. reported that the overexpression of either LT\u03b2R or the cytoplasmic domain of LT\u03b2R induces apoptosis in HeLa cells [26] . This opposite observation might be due to the distinct role of LT\u03b2R in different cell types.",

            "text": "LT\u03b2R signaling has been reported to be crucially involved in many cellular processes and molecular events, and we are particularly interested in its role in bacterial and viral infection. Several reports have demonstrated the critical role of LT\u03b2R signaling in bacterial infection of intestinal epithelial cells. For example, LT\u03b2R \u2212/\u2212 mice are sensitive to bacterial infection due to the absence of lymphoid organs in these mice, and LT\u03b2R signaling in intestinal epithelial cells is required for the recruitment of neutrophils to the site of infection during early infection via the production of CXCL1 and CXCL2 [6, 27] . LT\u03b2R signaling is required for clearance of Salmonella typhimurium in infected gut lumen [28] . Additionally, very recent data showed that LT\u03b2R is highly expressed in the lymph nodes, duodenum and jejunum of eight-day-old newborn piglets, which may be beneficial for developing resistance to E. coli F18 in pigs [21] . In addition, the role of LT\u03b2R in viral infection was investigated. Zhu et al. reported that the LT\u03b2R rs12345 polymorphism is related to the spontaneous resolution of hepatitis B virus infection [8] . All these observations revealed the function of LT\u03b2R in infection. Since IPEC-J2 cells have been reported to be susceptible to PEDV infection [22] , we investigated the impact of LT\u03b2R on PEDV infection in IPEC-J2 cells. Our data revealed that the levels of PED virus in LT\u03b2R \u2212/\u2212 cells was significantly higher than in LT\u03b2R +/+ cells, indicating that LT\u03b2R-mediated signaling plays a key role in protecting IPEC-J2 cells from PEDV infection.",

            "text": "Since it has been demonstrated that PEDV infection destroys epithelial barrier integrity [22] and LT\u03b2R signaling limits mucosal damage through the IL-22-IL-23 pathway [10] , we detected expression levels of VCAM1, IL-22 and IL-23 in both cell types by semi-quantitative PCR. VCAM1 and IL-22 were significantly decreased in RNA expression in LT\u03b2R \u2212/\u2212 IPEC-J2 cells, in agreement with the previous observation that an abundance of IL-22 is significantly reduced in LT\u03b2R \u2212/\u2212 mice fed a high-fat-diet [6] . IL-22, a member of the IL-10 superfamily, plays essential roles in fighting against mucosal microbial infection and maintaining mucosal barrier integrity within the intestine. The downregulation of IL-22 and VCAM1 in LT\u03b2R \u2212/\u2212 IPEC-J2 cells indicates that the epithelial barrier integrity of cells might be impaired, which leads to increased susceptibility to PEDV infection, though further investigation is needed. Surprisingly, IL-23 was found to be intact in LT\u03b2R \u2212/\u2212 cells, which suggested that IL-22 and IL-23 may play individual roles in IPEC-J2 cells. In addition, the S-phase arrest might also contribute to the higher viral production in LT\u03b2R \u2212/\u2212 cells. The overexpression of LT\u03b2R, or the activation of its mediated signaling by its functional antibody or cellular receptors such as LIGHT, will also be needed to positively determine its role in preventing infection.",

Our in vitro cellular model will be helpful for better understanding the biological function of LT\u03b2R and the cellular responses to PEDV infection.",

(A) Targeting strategy: two different small guide RNAs (sgRNAs) (L1 and L3) targeting 32 bp regions of exon 2 in the pig LT\u03b2R gene were designed and inserted into the pX330 vector. Then, the pCAG-GFP plasmid was co-transfected with the pX330-L1 and pX330-L3 plasmids, and single cells were sorted into 96-well plates by flow cytometry. (B) A total of 96 colonies were picked and subjected to RFLP analysis. Monoallelic and biallelic mutant clones were labeled by their clone number. (C) Estimation of targeting efficiency. Note that 10 biallelic mutated clones were identified, and the targeting efficiency was 10.4%. (D) Wild-type IPEC-J2 cells and two biallelic mutated clones (namely 1-10# and 1-22#) were picked for real-time PCR analysis. *** p < 0.001 was considered statistically significant. Note that the expression levels of LT\u03b2R were significantly decreased in 1-10# and 1-22# cells (p < 0.001 respectively). (E) LT\u03b2R protein levels in the wild-type and 1-10# cells were detected by immunoblotting with an anti-LT\u03b2R antibody at a 1:1000 dilution (Abcam). GAPDH was used as a loading control.",
