            "text": "Selective packaging is a mechanism used by multiple virus families to specifically incorporate genomic RNA (gRNA) into virions and exclude other types of RNA. Lineage A betacoronaviruses incorporate a 95-bp stem-loop structure, the packaging signal (PS), into the nsp15 locus of ORF1b that is both necessary and sufficient for the packaging of RNAs. However, unlike other viral PSs, where mutations generally resulted in viral replication defects, mutation of the coronavirus (CoV) PS results in large increases in subgenomic RNA packaging with minimal effects on gRNA packaging in vitro and on viral titers. Here, we show that selective packaging is also required for viral evasion of the innate immune response and optimal pathogenicity. We engineered two distinct PS mutants in two different strains of murine hepatitis virus (MHV) that packaged increased levels of subgenomic RNAs, negativesense genomic RNA, and even cellular RNAs. All PS mutant viruses replicated normally in vitro but caused dramatically reduced lethality and weight loss in vivo. PS mutant virus infection of bone marrow-derived macrophages resulted in increased interferon (IFN) production, indicating that the innate immune system limited the replication and/or pathogenesis of PS mutant viruses in vivo. PS mutant viruses remained attenuated in MAVS \u03ea/\u03ea and Toll-like receptor 7-knockout (TLR7 \u03ea/\u03ea ) mice, two well-known RNA sensors for CoVs, but virulence was restored in interferon alpha/beta receptor-knockout (IFNAR \u03ea/\u03ea ) mice or in MAVS \u03ea/\u03ea mice treated with IFNAR-blocking antibodies. Together, these data indicate that coronaviruses promote virulence by utilizing selective packaging to avoid innate immune detection. IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses (CoVs) produce many types of RNA molecules during their replication cycle, including both positive-and negative-sense genomic and subgenomic RNAs. Despite this, coronaviruses selectively package only positive-sense genomic RNA into their virions. Why CoVs selectively package their genomic RNA is not clear, as disruption of the packaging signal in MHV, which leads to loss of selective packaging, does not affect genomic RNA packaging or virus replication in cultured cells. This contrasts with other viruses, where disruption of selective packaging generally leads to altered replication. Here, we demonstrate that in the absence of selective packaging, the virulence of MHV was significantly reduced. Importantly, virulence was restored in the absence of interferon signaling, indicating that selective packaging is a mechanism used by CoVs to escape innate immune detection.",

In the case of coronaviruses, replication/transcription complexes (RTCs) assemble on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes. The RTC, a multiprotein complex, replicates genomic RNA (gRNA) and transcribes subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) during viral infection. During replication, different viral RNAs are replicated, transcribed, translated, or assembled into virions. In RNA virus infections, replication and assembly are often coordinated by cis-acting RNA elements, which may undergo intramolecular RNA interactions to form secondary structures important for recognition. Concordantly, during coronavirus infection, gRNA and sgRNAs must be distinguishable for the purposes of replication, transcription, translation, and assembly.",

In lineage A betacoronaviruses (\u2424-CoVs), such as murine hepatitis virus (MHV), the selective packaging of gRNA is dependent on the packaging signal (PS) and its interaction with structural proteins. Early studies of the MHV PS identified a 190-bp region within the nsp15 locus as the PS (3) . In both infection and virus-like particle systems, the 190-bp PS was sufficient for packaging of nonviral RNA (4) . Selective packaging is intimately tied to interactions with the structural proteins N and M. The selective packaging of nonviral RNA was correlated with M protein binding (5) . Furthermore, N protein binds to RNA indiscriminately and was not required for packaging of nonviral RNA. However, when the N protein C-terminal domain (CTD) from MHV was swapped with sudden acute respiratory syndrome-associated CoV (SARS-CoV), significant increases in packaged sgRNAs were observed (6) . These two studies propose two different models for selective packaging with M, or alternatively N, protein playing the dominant role in conferring packaging selectivity.",

Structural study of the PS from MHV, human coronavirus HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1), bovine CoV, and HCoV-OC43 revealed several conserved elements within the 95-bp stem-loop structure, including 2-nucleotide (nt) bulges, AGC/GUAAU motifs, and a pentaloop ( Fig. 1A) (7) . More recent studies utilizing 20 synonymous mutations predicted to abolish the PS stem-loop structure demonstrated that the secondary structure of the PS was necessary for selective packaging during MHV infection (8) . In this instance, significantly higher levels of sgRNA were packaged into PS mutants than in wild-type MHV. Remarkably, this increase in sgRNA did not accompany equivalent decreases in packaging of gRNA or in viral titers (8) . Thus, these PS mutants had no defect in virus production in tissue culture cells compared to wild-type MHV (8) . This is in contrast to the role of the alphavirus packaging signal, where PS mutants also lead to increased sgRNA packaging, but at the expense of gRNA packaging and viral fitness in cultured cells (9) . Retrovirus packaging signal mutants also lead to greatly decreased genomic RNA packaging with a concomitant increase in cellular mRNA packaging (10) .",

Furthermore, the PS was important for repressing the type I interferon (IFN-I) response during MHV infection of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs). Finally, IFN-I signaling was essential for the attenuation of selective packaging mutants as the virulence of P/S mutants was restored in interferon alpha/ beta receptor-knockout (IFNAR \u03ea/\u03ea ) mice or mice treated with IFNAR-blocking antibody.",

To test whether this phenotype was strain specific, we introduced the HA sequence into nsp15 of the rJHMV strain of MHV (rJHMV Nsp15-HA ), using a previously described full-length pBAC-based reverse genetics system (12) . rJHMV Nsp15-HA had growth kinetics in vitro equivalent to that of rJHMV WT (Fig. S2A) , as previously described for rA59 Nsp15-HA-infected cells (11) . Mice infected with rJHMV Nsp15-HA had substantially decreased weight loss and increased survival ( Fig. 1D and E). While these data suggest that selective packaging is important for MHV virulence, we cannot rule out subtle effects of the HA tag on the function of nsp15 endoribonuclease, a known IFN-I antagonist.

            "text": "To separate the roles of nsp15 protein and of the PS in virulence, we constructed a second set of viruses with packaging defects in the context of both rA59 and rJHMV (termed PS \u03ea ), as previously described (8) . These mutants have synonymous mutations throughout the PS, which are predicted to alter the stem-loop structure of the PS without changing the amino acid sequence of nsp15 (Fig. 1C) . The growth kinetics of two independent rJHMV PS\u03ea clones (3.2 and 4.2) was nearly identical to that of rJHMV WT in vitro (Fig. S2B ). These data are consistent with previous results using rA59 PS\u03ea and indicate that the PS has few, if any, effects on replication in vitro (8) . After confirming the fitness of rJHMV PS\u03ea in vitro, we next assessed the virulence of rJHMV PS\u03ea in infected mice. B6 mice were infected intranasally with either rJHMV WT or rJHMV PS\u03ea and monitored for morbidity and mortality for 14 dpi. Intranasal infection of rJHMV WT resulted in nearly 100% mortality (Fig. 1G ) and substantial weight loss (Fig. 1H ). Mice infected with rJHMV PS\u03ea had significantly increased survival (Fig. 1G ) and reduced weight loss (Fig. 1H ). In agreement with results using rJHMV, mice infected with rA59 PS\u03ea also had decreased weight loss and increased survival compared to mice infected with rA59 WT (Fig. S1C and D) . We next measured the viral load of rJHMV WT , rJHMV PS\u03ea , and rJHMV Nsp15-HA in the brains of infected mice. Both rJHMV WT and rJHMV Nsp15-HA invaded the central nervous system (CNS) within 3 dpi and replicated to similar levels up to 5 dpi (Fig. 1F ). By 7 dpi, titers in rJHMV Nsp15-HA -infected mice were decreased in the CNS compared to those in mice infected with rJHMV WT . rJHMV Nsp15-HA was cleared by 9 dpi. rJHMV PS\u03ea also invaded the CNS, albeit with a delay, and reached similar peak titers as rJHMV Nsp15-HA but not rJHMV WT (Fig. 1I ). rJHMV PS\u03ea titers decreased on 9 dpi and were cleared by 11 dpi (Fig. 1I ). Thus, both PS mutant viruses did not reach the same peak viral titers as, and were cleared more rapidly than, wild-type JHMV. These data, utilizing two distinct PS mutant viruses, indicate that selective packaging of viral genomic RNA is essential for optimal virulence in multiple models of MHV infection. rA59 PS\u060a and rA59 Nsp15-HA have increased sgRNA and cellular RNA packaged into virions. We next assessed the degree of the selective packaging defect observed in rA59 PS\u03ea and rA59 Nsp15-HA virions (Fig. 2 ). To accomplish this goal, the levels of positive-and negative-strand sgRNA7 (\u03e9sgRNA7 and -sgRNA7, respectively) and positive-strand gRNA (gRNA) were determined using concentrated virus samples prepared by velocity centrifugation of infected-cell supernatants. In agreement with previous publications (8, 11) , both rA59 PS\u03ea and rA59 Nsp15-HA virions had higher levels of packaged \u03e9sgRNA7 than gRNA compared to rA59 WT virions ( Fig. 2A) . Furthermore, the ratio of \u03e9sgRNA to gRNA in rA59 PS\u03ea and rA59 Nsp15-HA virions was nearly equivalent to the intracellular ratio in rA59 PS\u03ea -infected and rA59 Nsp15-HA -infected cells. This enrichment of \u03e9sgRNA7 to gRNA in rA59 PS\u03ea and rA59 Nsp15-HA virions contrasts with rA59 WT , where the \u03e9sgRNA7-to-gRNA ratio was dramatically decreased compared to the intracellular ratio ( Fig. 2A ). An increased ratio of \u03easgRNA7 to gRNA was also observed in rA59 PS\u03ea and rA59 Nsp15-HA compared to rA59 WT virions ( Fig. 2B ) but was not equivalent to the intracellular ratio of these RNAs. Finally, these increases in sgRNA7 incorporation had little effect on the levels of gRNA (Fig. 2C) , as neither rA59 PS\u03ea nor rA59 Nsp15-HA virions had more than an~2-fold decrease in packaged gRNA compared to rA59 WT virions.",

The elevated levels of sgRNA, especially -sgRNA, in virions may act as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), which may be sensed during entry, replication, or packaging of PS mutants. To initially test this hypothesis, we utilized bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) because they are easily culturable, are highly susceptible to MHV, and are known to express IFN-I following infection (15) . Virions were pelleted by ultracentrifugation through a 30% sucrose cushion, and viral RNA was isolated. Intracellular RNA was isolated from the 17Cl-1 monolayers using Trizol.

The location of the stem-loop structure within the nsp15 locus allows these coronaviruses to selectively package gRNA and not coterminal sgRNA or host RNA. In this work, we quantified the packaging defect in rA59 Nsp15-HA and rA59 PS\u03ea . The defects present in these two different PS mutants were strikingly similar, despite rA59 Nsp15-HA maintaining the overall structure, the pentaloop, and one of the 2-nucleotide (nt) bulges, elements Coronavirus Selective Packaging Limits IFN Responses \u00ae hypothesized to be important for packaging ( Fig. 1A and B ). In agreement with previous publications (8), we found a significant increase in sgRNA packaging in both rA59 PS\u03ea and rA59 Nsp15-HA virions. We further divided the sgRNA into \u03e9sgRNA and \u03easgRNA and found increased levels of both in the virions of mutant viruses compared to parental viruses. Furthermore, we found increased levels of host cellular RNA in both packaging mutant virions. Interestingly, while the ratios of \u03e9sgRNA7 to gRNA in the virions of both rA59 PS\u03ea and rA59 Nsp15-HA were equivalent to the intracellular ratio, this was not true for ratios of -sgRNA7 or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) to gRNA. Packaging occurs through an interaction between the PS stem-loop and coronavirus structural proteins. A direct interaction between the M protein and the PS was previously reported and correlated with the packaging of nonviral RNA (20) . It can be hypothesized that in the absence of M-PS interactions, packaging of RNA is dependent on N protein. Since N protein binds to RNA indiscriminately (5), levels of packaged RNA would be predicted to closely mimic those present in the intracellular environment. However, the ratio of both -sgRNA7 and GAPDH to gRNA was increased in virions but did not reach intracellular ratios, suggesting that RNA binding by N is not the sole determinant of RNA packaging in rA59 PS\u03ea and rA59 Nsp15-HA . RNA localization, secondary structure in other regions of the genome, or other proteins may influence RNA packaging. The relative lack of -sgRNA7 packaging may reflect its localization to membranous structures associated with replication while \u03e9sgRNA7 would be exported to the cytosol.",

It can be hypothesized that packaged sgRNA and/or host RNAs behave as PAMPs, eliciting an increased IFN-I response in rJHMV PS\u03ea -infected and rJHMV Nsp15-HA -infected cells. Consistent with this hypothesis, IFN-I signaling was essential for this attenuation in vivo (Fig. 3) . Furthermore, BMMs infected with rJHMV PS\u03ea expressed higher levels of IFN-I than rJHMV WT (Fig. 3A) . These data indicate that packaging mutants are capable of inducing an increased IFN-I response, which may be protective in vivo. We investigated the two best-described sensors for IFN-I signaling during coronavirus infection, MDA5 and TLR7. We found that MAVS \u03ea/\u03ea and TLR7 \u03ea/\u03ea mice were both resistant to rJHMV PS\u03ea . These data indicate that neither TLR7-nor MAVS-mediated signaling was solely responsible for the attenuation of rJHMV PS\u03ea .

The presence of \u03easgRNAs in virions, albeit in small amounts, might be most important for the induction of IFN-I since negative-strand viral RNA is presumably not capped but, rather, contains a triphosphate at the 5= end. This would facilitate recognition by the intracellular helical receptor RIG-I. Negative-sense sgRNA is expected to be present as double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), which could be detected by RIG-I, TLR3, and protein kinase R (PKR), in addition to MDA5. It should be noted that while our data suggest that IFN-I signaling and perhaps other changes in the innate immune response are largely responsible for rJHMV PS\u03ea attenuation, defects in virus replication in cells in the infected brain may also contribute to attenuation. We observed no differences between the replication kinetics of rJHMV PS\u03ea or rJHMV Nsp15-HA and those of rJHMV WT in vitro (Fig. S1 ), but this does not preclude subtle differences in primary cells, such as BMMs (Fig. 3D) .",

This work uncovers a unique method by which an RNA virus shields its RNA products from the host to prevent an innate immune response. Selective packaging is conserved among coronaviruses and therefore is likely important for the virulence of most, if not all, coronaviruses. However, the localization of the packaging signal for most coronaviruses is unknown. Thus, an important goal for future research will be to identify the packaging signals in pathogenic human and animal coronaviruses and determine their roles in virulence.",

Using gBlock fragments with the corresponding mutations and listed primers, a PCR product was created with the HA or PS \u03ea substitution, kanamycin followed by an ISCE-I restriction site (KanI), and homologous arms. Either the KanI-HA-or KanI-PS \u03ea -containing product was transformed into competent GS1783 cells harboring the rJHMV.IA pBAC. Chloramphenicol-positive (CML \u03e9 ) Kan \u03e9 colonies were screened for intermolecular recombination by PCR and restriction enzyme digestion. Colonies with the correct intermediates were then used for intramolecular recombination of the homologous arms. Correct colonies were amplified, and the ISCE-I enzyme was induced with 1% arabinose for 2 h. The Lambda Red recombination enzymes were induced by heat shock at 42\u00b0C for 30 min, and cells were then incubated at room temperature for 4 h. CML \u03e9 Kan \u03ea colonies were screened for correct final products by PCR, restriction enzyme digestion, and sequencing. pBAC.IA PS\u03ea or pBAC.IA Nsp15-HA was cotransfected with plasmid expressing N protein into BHK-MHVR cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer's protocol.

No coding mutations were present in either clone; however, rJHMV PS\u03ea3.2 did contain a synonymous mutation in nsp15 3= of the PS. It is unlikely that this mutation significantly alters the secondary structure in this region, and this isolate behaved identically to rJHMV PS\u03ea4 . 2 . rJHMV Nsp15-HA was sequenced after passaging with no mutations found.",
