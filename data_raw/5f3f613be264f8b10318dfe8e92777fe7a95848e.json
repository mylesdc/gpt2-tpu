Real-time reverse transcriptase (rRT) PCR for influenza was performed on combined nasal and throat specimens followed by viral culture, antigenic analysis, antiviral susceptibility testing and full genome sequencing for phylogenetic analysis. ILI-specimens negative for influenza were cultured, followed by rRT-PCR for enterovirus and rhinovirus (EV/RV) and EV71. Influenza was found in 168 cases (29%) and occurred almost exclusively in the rainy season from June to November. Isolated influenza strains had close antigenic and phylogenetic relationships, matching vaccine and circulating strains found elsewhere in Cambodia. Influenza vaccination coverage was low (<20%).

Influenza has been described to be one of the most important causes for hospitalization of children with an ARI [3] . It was suggested that some Southeast Asian countries, where influenza A infection is present year round, play an important role in the global spread of influenza that could trigger annual epidemics in temperate regions [4, 5] .",

Since then, the sentinel surveillance system has, together with event-based surveillance, demonstrated evidence of seasonal, pandemic and avian influenza. Previously published data revealed that Thailand and Cambodia, which are positioned geographically in the Northern hemisphere, demonstrate differing influenza epidemiology with regard to seasonality, with Thailand exhibiting a northern hemisphere transmission pattern while transmission in Cambodia typically occurs from June to December, similar to the southern hemisphere [6] . The rainy season in Western Cambodia is June to November and the dry season is December to May. The more recent data suggests that influenza seasonality is more similar in Thailand and Cambodia than previously thought. [5] .",

The antigenic sites are five somewhat overlapping regions (designated A to E for the H3 strains [9] [10] [11] and Ca1, Ca2, Cb, Sa, and Sb for the H1 strains [12] ). Antigenic mapping by Smith et al. [13] showed that 11 antigenic clusters of viruses emerged during the 35-year period following the introduction of the A/H3N2 virus in humans in 1968 and that major jumps (or \"cluster transitions\") occur between antigenically distinct clusters of viral sequences roughly every 3 years (antigenic shift) [13] .",

Fig 1 was created using ArcView GIS version 3.1 (http://arcview.software.informer.com [14, 15] ) Sentinel health centers and hospitals were selected based on sufficient overall patient volume and patients with upper respiratory infections (URI), geographical representativeness and ease of specimen transport to the study laboratory. Sites were established sequentially: Battambang in 2010 (2 sites), Oddar Meanchey and Pailin in 2011, and Banteay Meanchey in 2012. Due to the cross-sectional design of our study in a region for which no previous baseline respiratory surveillance existed, no minimal sample size was calculated. Nevertheless, and in accordance with national and World Health Organization influenza surveillance guidelines [16], we aimed to collect a cross-section of data distributed over time and space. For every site -and pending on local epidemiology and health facility workload, 5 to 10 ILI specimens were collected each week (Monday to Friday) for 52 weeks per year and largely from the first two subjects meeting the predefined inclusion criteria.",

The concentration of drug required to inhibit 50% of the NA activity (IC 50 ) was calculated using the non-linear curve-fitting function in the Graphpad Prism 4 package (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). The average IC 50 (nM) (\u00b1 standard deviation) of two independent determinations was calculated for each virus. Outliers of more than 2 standard deviations from the overall mean were retested twice. A subset of isolates were forwarded to WHOCC in Melbourne for confirmation of strain analysis by HA inhibition test and NA inhibitor susceptibility using an NA enzyme inhibition assay with a fluorescent substrate MUNANA [2'-(4-Methylumbelliferyl)-\u03b1-D-N-acetylneuraminic acid sodium salt hydrate]. The typical range of IC 50 was calculated as the mean IC 50 \u00b1 3 standard deviations using a panel of well-characterized reference strains kindly provided by the WHO Collaborative Center for Reference and Research on Influenza, Melbourne, Australia. Isolates with IC 50 values within or close to the typical IC 50 range were considered to be sensitive isolates. IC 50 values outside of the typical range and between 50 and 200 nM were isolates with mildly reduced sensitivity and IC 50 values well outside the typical range and greater than 200 nM were considered as isolates with highly reduced sensitivity.",

All of the 418 ILI specimens that tested negative for influenza A or B by rRT-PCR were sent for viral culture. Forty (10%) were culture positive; 24 adenovirus, 11 PIV1, 2 PIV2, 3 PIV3 were isolated (Figs 2 and 3B ). No RSV, HMPV or coronaviruses were identified. Pan-EV/RV and EV71 nested RT-PCR (S4 Table) detected 17 samples positive for enterovirus, which included coxsackievirus A (n = 10, 1 A4, 3 A6, 1 A8, 1 A9, 4 A12), echovirus (n = 5, 2 E6, 3 E9) and coxsackievirus B (n = 2, B3, B4). A single specimen was found to be negative during the first round of RT-PCR but positive by second round pan-EV/RV and EV71 nested RT-PCR. The 662 base pairs PCR product fragment obtained from pan-EV/RV nested RT-PCR was sequenced using the RV/EV inner primers. The 528 bases obtained from sequencing were found to be 99% identical to the Enterovirus A71/Homo sapiens/VNM/208/2011 strain (Accession: KJ686294). When the 227 bp PCR product obtained from EV71 nested RT-PCR was sequenced using the EV71 inner primers, 131 bases was obtained. This sequence was found to be 99% identical to Enterovirus A71/Cambodia: Banteay Meanchey 2012 strains (Accessions: KP308459, KP308453, KP308450, KP308448, KP308430, KP308427, KP308410, KP308406). Out of the 33 specimens positive with rhinoviruses, only 18 could be serotyped. Of these 18, most were rhinovirus A (n = 11), followed by rhinovirus B (n = 4) and rhinovirus C (n = 3) (Fig 4B) . Amplicons were sequenced and sequences were analyzed using Genbank's BLAST tool to identify the virus species.",

When compared to the A/California/7/2009 vaccine strain, all Cambodian viruses on average had 11 amino acid changes within the HA segment. Amino acid changes found in the HA gene can be found in Table 4 . No evidence for amino acid substitutions leading to changes in glycosylation was seen in the HA dataset; however, several changes among sequenced samples occurred in antigenic sites, polymorphic sites or had a recorded effect in in vitro analyses per the literature (S6 Table) . For the NA gene, several amino acid substitutions resulted in addition/loss of glycosylation sites, or Table) . For the MP gene, all samples contained the S31N mutation that may confer amantadine resistance as determined by the Genbank Influenza Viral Resource Annotation tool [32] . No features or changes of interest were seen within the NP or NS segment. The HA and NA segments contained the most amino acid substitutions when compared to the reference (A/California/7/2009) as well as to the yearly defined groups (2011 and 2012). The MP and NP segments showed the fewest substitutions (Table 4 ). There were no samples within the HA amino acid analysis that had unique substitutions relative to the global sequences. However, the NA gene had unique amino acid substitutions not found with the global references; the function of these substitutions is unknown (S7 Table) . Selection pressure was determined using the dN/dS statistic. Values of dN/dS > 1 are indicative of positive or adaptive selection, values <1 are indicative of purifying or negative selection and a value = 1 indicates neutral or no selection ongoing in the dataset. All samples were under purifying selection for all segments with exception to the NS segment of the 2011 Cambodian samples, which had a dN/dS value of 1.0 suggesting neutral selection (S8 Table) .",

Influenza subtypes varied by year with A/pH1N1(2009) being predominate in 2010, influenza B in 2011, and influenza A/H3N2 in 2012. We did not expect to detect any H5N1 in our laboratory surveillance system as most suspected H5N1 cases would have been screened out by the health centers based on reported exposure to dead or diseased poultry. The specimen of one patient with reported H5N1 exposure in 2011 was investigated in our laboratory and tested negative for H5N1. Table 5 . Changes in glycosylation, antigenic and polymorphic sites linked to amino acid (AA) substitutions and sub-antigenic/catalytic sites (epitopes) where AA substitutions were found for hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) segments of H3N2. [39] . Our data revealed that the influenza B did not match well with strains included in vaccine composition of trivalent vaccines; therefore, if vaccination is to be implemented, the quadrivalent influenza vaccine that contains the two influenza B lineages, rather than the trivalent vaccine, may be more suitable. Aside from a limited quantity of oseltamivir, stockpiled by the government for management of severe disease by pandemic or avian influenza [40] , use of antivirals for influenza is very low in Cambodia [40] . As a result, all strains we detected were susceptible to neuraminidase inhibitors (NIs) such as oseltamivir and zanamivir, which can be partially explained by the absence of these medications in Cambodia. Due to widespread adamantane resistance, we did not conduct susceptibility testing on this class of antiviral drugs; however, we did find the S31N mutation conferring adamantane resistance in all of our influenza isolates tested.",

However, it was also noted that amino acid changes were shared with the Thai references suggesting a possibility of mixing between Thai and Cambodian influenza as expected. Isolates from Battambang, being western Cambodia's major transportation hub, showed the highest diversity of amino acid changes. Analysis of sequence data from our influenza patients revealed a random or neutral mutation of the influenza genomes as expected. Koel et al. [41] discovered that periodic major antigenic change in influenza A/H3N2 virus was caused mainly by single amino acid substitutions, which occurred at only seven out of 131 possible amino acid positions in HA at antigenic sites immediately adjacent to the receptor binding site (RBS). These substitutions were located in antigenic sites A (position 145) and B (positions 155, 156, 158, 159, 189, and 193) , with none in sites C, D, or E.

However, it is possible that some of these mutations may constitute permissive or compensatory mutations that would be important in enabling co-mutations that could affect viral fitness, and as such, have an incentive to remain fixed under purifying selection. Permissive mutations have been described in the spread of oseltamivir resistant influenza A/H1N1 virus that carry the H274Y mutation and are increasingly being recognized as a major force in evolution [42, 43] .",

This is likely an underestimation of the true prevalence in this population since we excluded children less than one year of age, an age group more likely infected by enteroviruses at rates exceeding those of older children and adults by several fold [48] [49] [50] . The most common enteroviruses found among children under 5 years old in our population were coxsackieviruses (7.3%) and echoviruses (3%). Although we did not find coxsackievirus A16, the most common etiologic agent for hand-foot-mouth-disease (HFMD), we found other coxsackieviruses that can cause HFMD such as coxsackievirus A6 (n = 3) and A12 (n = 4). Coxsackievirus A6 is known to cause either an atypical rash resembling eczema herpeticum or chickenpox (United States 2011-2012 and in Europe since 2009) or nail loss one to two months after onset of symptoms (Finland 2009, Taiwan 2010, Japan 2011).

While we attempted to select surveillance sites representative of the nearby geographic locations, we had no accurate figures of the catchment populations or denominators at our respective sentinel sites. Our staggered method of adding sentinel sites suggests that not all sentinel sites enrolled patients evenly over 3 influenza seasons. Similarly, with a small sample size and limited number of sampling locations, no inferences could be made with regard to temporal or spatial flow of influenza strains in our phylogenetic analysis.
