A total of 383 patients were included, 277 (72.3%) of whom presented with pneumonia. 377 (98.4%) patients were positive for at least one microorganism, of which RSV was the most common virus (41.0%), with a peak observed between June and September, corresponding to the rainy season. Most RSV inpatients had pneumonia (84.1%), of whom 35% had severe pneumonia. Children <3-months old were a high-risk group for severe pneumonia, independently of RSV infection. Our study suggests that RSV infection is frequent in Laos and commonly associated with pneumonia in hospitalized young children. Further investigations are required to provide a better overall view of the Lao nationwide epidemiology and public health burden of RSV infection over time.",

The first influenza surveillance system established in Lao PDR with laboratory diagnosis included 526 patients of all ages, including 160 (30.4%) children <5 years old, with influenza-like illness from January 2007 to December 2008. At least one respiratory virus was detected in 54.6% of the samples; Influenzavirus A/B was the most common virus detected and only 9 (3.5%) patients were RSV-positive 12 . Between August 2009 and October 2010, samples from 292 patients of all ages admitted to two Lao hospitals (in Vientiane Capital and Northern Luang Prabang Province) with ALRI were collected for respiratory pathogen investigations 13 . Human rhinovirus and RSV were the most frequent viruses detected, in 35% and 26% of patients, respectively. RSV was found in all age groups but was more frequent in children under 5 years old. There is thus a crucial need to collect information to estimate the burden of RSV in Lao PDR to guide public health policy.",

Virocult vials were taken to the laboratory within 2 hours at ambient temperature. The swab was immediately unloaded by strongly squeezing the swab inside the medium, against the bottom of the tube for 30 seconds then outside of the medium against the inner wall of the tube, to release the maximum amount of liquid from the swab. Media were aliquoted and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C before performing the laboratory assays. 100 \u00b5L of nasal swab and 100 \u00b5L of throat swab media were pooled together for each patient and extracted using the Cador Pathogen 96 QIAcube HT kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions, with an elution of 90 \u00b5L. Extracts were tested for 33 pathogens using the FTD \u00ae respiratory pathogens 33 kit (Fast-track Diagnostics) which consists of multiplexed Taqman Statistical analysis. For patient descriptions, we compared RSV-positive with RSV-negative patients within two groups of patients: all ARI patients and ARI patients with pneumonia. For the assessment of predictive factors for severity, patients with severe outcomes were compared with patients with no severe outcome within 6 groups of patients: all ARI patients, RSV-positive ARI patients, RSV-negative ARI patients, and those same three Continued groups in patients less than 2-year old. Death, stay in ICU, oxygen use and severe pneumoniae were considered as indicators for severity. However, the mortality rate was too low to be analyzed and the analyses of ICU stay and oxygen use did not provide any added-value, so ultimately severe pneumonia alone was analyzed as an indicator of severe outcome. Data were double entered into an Access database (Microsoft Corporation 1) . Two hundred and seventy-seven (72.3%) patients had pneumonia. The age group with the highest proportion of pneumonia was that including those younger than one year (85.3%) (Fig. 1) . Among patients <2 years old, 143 (53.4%) had received PCV13. Vaccinated children were significantly more frequent in the less than 1-year-old age group (61.3%) than in the 1 to <2-year-old age group (42.5%, p = 0.002, Figure S1 ).

This finding is consistent with others studies performed in several countries in the region [15] [16] [17] . RSV outbreaks are known to vary from year to year and according to geographical patterns. A peak of RSV infection (84.7%) was observed from June to September (Fig. 2) , corresponding to the rainy season in Laos. This is consistent with the association of RSV infection with the rainy season reported in studies elsewhere in the tropics 15, 18, 19 . The explanation for this consistent association is unclear. It could be directly related to climatic factors, such as increased humidity, or reflect changes in social behaviour which may enhance transmission 8, 19 . Recently, Paynter reported that the wet conditions of the tropical rainy season may encourage contact transmission of this virus by increasing the amount of virus on surfaces and by increasing virus survival in droplets on surfaces 20 . However, other patterns of RSV seasonality in tropical areas have been described. There were peaks of RSV-associated hospitalization observed during cool periods from 2011 to 2014 in Bangladesh 21 . Substantial differences in geography and climate are present in Laos, especially between the south and the north of the country, and therefore additional data, collected over several years and from different areas, are required to fully describe the seasonality of RSV infection in Laos.",

            "text": "Among RSV-positive patients, 84.1% had pneumonia, of which 35% had severe pneumonia, with no significant differences between age groups. A similar finding was reported in two studies of hospitalized patients in Thailand, in which RSV was the viral pathogen most commonly associated with pneumonia in children under 5 years old 15, 16 . In Laos, pneumonia was less frequent in RSV-negative than in RSV-positive patients. However, severe pneumonia was more frequent in RSV-negative patients (40.7%) than in RSV-positive patients (29.3%), especially in the children <1 year old, in whom the proportion with severe pneumonia was significantly higher in RSV-negative patients (62.1%, p < 0.001). The majority (87.9%) of RSV-positive patients were less than 2 years old. This is similar to the pattern of RSV epidemiology in children worldwide [22] [23] [24] and makes this age group an important target for interventions such as vaccination, which might significantly reduce the incidence of pneumonia.",

We fitted a binary logistic regression model, including a stepwise selection procedure, to assess predictive factors for severity. The level of significance was set at p < 0.05.Ethics.
