We aimed to investigate risk factors associated with isolation of multidrug-resistant pathogens in bronchiectasis exacerbations. Methods: A prospective observational study was conducted in two tertiary-care hospitals, enrolling patients when first exacerbation appeared. Multidrug-resistance was determined according to European Centre of Diseases Prevention and Control classification. Results: Two hundred thirty three exacerbations were included and microorganisms were isolated in 159 episodes. Multidrug-resistant pathogens were found in 20.1% episodes: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (48.5%), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (18.2%) and Extended spectrum betalactamase + Enterobacteriaceae (6.1%), and they were more frequent in exacerbations requiring hospitalization (24.5% vs. 10.2%, p: 0.016). Three independent multidrugresistant risk factors were found: chronic renal disease (Odds ratio (OR), 7.60, 95% CI 1.92-30.09), hospitalization in the previous year (OR, 3.88 95% CI 1.37-11.02) and prior multidrug-resistant isolation (OR, 5.58, 95% CI 2.02-15.46). The proportion of multidrug-resistant in the 233 exacerbations was as follows: 3.9% in patients without risk factors, 12.6% in those with 1 factor and 53.6% if \u22652 risk factors. Conclusions: Hospitalization in the previous year, chronic renal disease, and prior multidrug-resistant isolation are risk factors for identification multidrug-resistant pathogens in exacerbations. This information may assist clinicians in choosing empirical antibiotics in daily clinical practice.",

Length of hospital stay was recorded in hospitalized patients and new exacerbations at 1 year of follow-up.

Sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage (11) were processed for Gram and Ziehl-Neelsen stains and for cultures of bacterial, fungal and mycobacterial pathogens. Sputum samples were considered acceptable if there were more than 25 leukocytes and fewer than 10 squamous cells per low-power microscope field. Invasive samples were obtained if requested by the attending physician. Microorganism identification was consider positive as in previous publications. [9] Briefly, bacterial identification was achieved by means of the MALDI-TOF MS (Biomerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France). Antimicrobial susceptibility was tested by the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion technique on Muller-Hinton or sheep blood agar, depending on the microorganism growth requirements; E-test and in-house PCR were used to assess unexpected resistance patterns.",

[15] In fact, MDR exacerbations occurred in elderly patients with a higher proportion of comorbid conditions, indicating associations with more debilitating diseases, requiring p value: the \u03c7 2 test was performed for categorical data and the Mann-Whitney U test was performed for continuous data more contacts with health resources. Our results showed that the use of prior inhaled antibiotics and long-term oxygen therapy was greater in patients with MDR pathogens.

[19] In our study, we found three independent MDR risk factors: renal disease, prior MDR isolation and hospitalization in the previous year. Chronic renal disease is a recognized MDR risk factor, as reported in pneumonia studies. [3] Shindo et al., [20] identified 6 independent MDR risk factors, regardless of whether the patient has health-care associated or community-acquired pneumonia, suggesting that risk factors relied more on host factors than on the setting of infection. Prior hospitalization is a fairly widely recognized independent MDR risk factor and specifically for MRSA, [21] and for Enterobacteriacea mainly related to exposure to III/IV generation of cephalosporins or broadspectrum penicillins. [22] Prior MDR isolation was independently associated with a higher risk of MDR exacerbation. In our cohort, approximately 50% of patients had chronic Pseudomonas infection, [23] reflecting the most severe patients seen in a specific BE clinic. Prior MDR colonization is a recognized risk factor for MRSA [24, 25] and for Pseudomonas [26] in COPD patients. We found that 40% of patients with MDR exacerbations had prior isolation with the same microorganism.",

In fact, the choice of initial treatment was microbiological suitable in 75% of cases, probably because physicians took into consideration prior MDR colonization, [27] a policy that is supported by our findings. Currently, factors considered in the antibiotic selection include extent of the disease, severity, local resistance patterns, and prior culture results. [28] A practical conclusion is that extended-spectrum antibiotics against MDR could be withdrawn in patients with no risk factors and indicated if 2 or more risk factors are present. Where 1 risk factor is present, an extendedspectrum antibiotic may be indicated until MDR pathogens have been ruled out; a microbiological work-up should therefore be implemented. [29] Nevertheless, these recommendations need to be validated in different populations or BE subsets [30] and knowledge of local resistance rates and colonization rates should be considered. This policy may contribute to containing broad-spectrum coverage for MDR in unnecessary episodes and this strategy may contribute to curbing the future emergence of resistant microorganisms in this population.",

This information may be useful for clinicians in guiding initial antibiotic therapy in exacerbations of BE. A further validation in different BE cohorts including distinct phenotypes and larger follow-up periods should be performed. MDR risk prediction in BE exacerbations is a new field that requires validation for clinical decision-making in selecting initial appropriate antibiotics and for safely avoiding anti-MDR coverage. ",
