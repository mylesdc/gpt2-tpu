Time-of-addition experiments and inactivation of enzymatic activities of the venoms were carried out to determine the characteristics of the anti-HCV activities. Results: S. maurus palmatus and A. australis venoms showed anti-HCV activities, with 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC 50 ) being 6.3 \u00b1 1.6 and 88.3 \u00b1 5.8 \u03bcg/ml, respectively. S. maurus palmatus venom (30 \u03bcg/ml) impaired HCV infectivity in culture medium, but not inside the cells, through virocidal effect. The anti-HCV activity of this venom was not inhibited by a metalloprotease inhibitor or heating at 60\u00b0C. The antiviral activity was directed preferentially against HCV.",

            "text": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major global health problem, with estimated more than 170 million infected individuals worldwide. HCV is an enveloped, positivestrand RNA virus that belongs to the Hepacivirus genus of the Flaviviridae family [1] [2] [3] . HCV infection is the serious cause of chronic hepatitis, hepatic steatosis, liver cirrhosis and eventually hepatocellular carcinoma after a few decades. There is no anti-HCV vaccine available and therapeutic options are still limited. The current standard therapy, which is based on pegylated interferon and ribavirin, is only partially effective, resulting in a sustained virological response (SVR) in about 50% of patients and has considerable side effects [1, 3] . Recently, HCV NS3 protease inhibitors and NS5A inhibitors have been approved for clinical use and SVR rates have improved to reach 70% or higher [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . However, these therapies are quite expensive and will probably not be accessible for all patients worldwide. For this reason, the development of new classes of safe and inexpensive antiviral compounds with improved efficacy is still needed for treatment of HCV infections.",

            "text": "Recently, natural antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are attracting more attention as therapeutic agents against a variety of microbes including antibiotics-resistant strains [9, 10] . Most AMPs share certain common features such as being small peptides of 10 to 50 amino acid residues, containing positive charge of 2 to 9 residues and an amphipathic structure [11] [12] [13] . These peptides exhibit a broad spectrum of antiviral and antibacterial activities, with direct or indirect microbicidal activities [12] . AMPs have been isolated from venomous animals including scorpions. Scorpion venoms consist of a cocktail of biologically active peptides that represent a tremendous potential for use in drug design and development [14] [15] [16] [17] . Most scorpion venom peptides are composed of 20 to 75 amino acid residues while certain proteins, enzymes, consist of 120 to 370 residues [17] . Scorpion venom peptides show a vast array of biochemical activities and pharmacological functions. They can be classified into two classes, i.e., disulfide-bridged and non-disulfide-bridged peptides [18] [19] [20] . AMPs found in scorpion venoms are paid more and more attention due to their unique biological activities that can potentially be used as broadspectrum antiviral agents [9, [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] . Scorpion venom AMPs are positively charged amphipathic peptides and can be divided into three structural categories: (i) cysteine containing peptides with disulfide bridges; (ii) peptides with an amphipathic \u03b1-helix but lacking cysteine residues and (iii) peptides rich in certain amino acids such as proline and glycine [29] .",

In brief, S. maurus palmatus crude venom (30 \u03bcg/ml) was added to the virus and/or cells at different time points relative to virus inoculation, as described in the Methods section: (i) pre-treatment of cells for 2 hr (\u22122 hr cells). This experiment examines whether there is any interaction between the venom and the cells. The result revealed that pre-treatment of virus for 2 hr (\u22122 hr virus) markedly suppressed production of HCV infectious particles in culture supernatants while pretreatment of cells for 2 hr (\u22122 hr cells) only marginally suppressed it (Figure 2A ). This suggested the possibility that S. maurus palmatus venom had direct virocidal activity. Also, treatment during post-inoculation for 46 hr (+2 hr) suppressed HCV infectivity in culture supernatants, though to a lesser extent compared to pre-treatment of virus for 2 hr (\u22122 hr virus). The result suggested that this treatment inhibited either HCV replication in the cell or HCV infectivity outside the cells (in culture supernatants). On the other hand, treatment during post-inoculation for 46 hr (+2 hr) did not significantly inhibit HCV NS3 protein accumulation while pre-treatment of virus for 2 hr (\u22122 hr virus) completely inhibited it at 1 and 2 days post-infection ( Figure 2B ). We further examined HCV RNA replication and virus infectivity inside the cells. The result revealed that the post-inoculation treatment (+2 hr) did not significantly inhibit HCV RNA replication in the cells ( Figure 2C ). Moreover, the venom treatment (+2 hr) did not reduce HCV infectivity inside the cells ( Figure 2D ). Taken together, these results suggest that the S. maurus palmatus venom acts directly on HCV particles in culture medium to impair the viral infectivity and that it does not exert its antiviral effect inside the cells.",

The results obtained revealed that the treated venom, either treated with heating at 60\u00b0C or the metalloproteinase inhibitor, or both at the same time, still markedly suppressed production of HCV infectious particles in the culture to the same extent compared to the untreated control ( Figure 3A ).

We S. maurus palmatus venom (30 \u03bcg/ml) was treated with a metalloproteinase inhibitor (1, 10-phenan-throline; 5 mM) at 4\u00b0C or 60\u00b0C for 20 min. The treated venom was mixed with HCV for 2 hr at 37\u00b0C and the mixture was inoculated to Huh7.5 cells for 2 hr at 37\u00b0C. The cells were cultivated in the absence of the venom for one day. The culture supernatants were titrated for virus infectivity (A) and the cells were subjected to immunoblot analysis using monoclonal antibody against the HCV NS3 protein (B). GAPDH served as an internal control to verify equal amounts of sample loading. Data represent means \u00b1 SEM of the data obtained from two independent experiments. 1,10 Ph., 1,10-phenanthroline; \u00a7, below the detection limit.",

If this was the case, the venom might inhibit other envelope viruses than HCV. To test this possibility, we used three different viruses, such as dengue virus type 2 [35, 36] , another member of the family Flaviviridae, and measles virus [37] and influenza virus [38] that belong to the family Paramyxoviridae and Orthomyxoviridae, respectively. The results obtained demonstrated that S. maurus palmatus venom exerted strong inhibition on dengue virus and only weak inhibition on measles virus ( Figure 4A ). On the other hand, the same venom did not inhibit but rather enhanced influenza virus infectivity ( Figure 4B ). These results exclude the possibility that S. maurus palmatus venom inhibits all the envelope viruses, suggesting that the venom preferentially inhibits HCV and dengue virus, both of which belong to the family Flaviviridae, but not other viruses, e.g., influenza virus.",

A variety of putative bioactive molecules have been identified, such as neurotoxins (NaScTxs and KScTxs), calcines, La1-like peptides, insecticidal toxins and other AMPs [40] . Some of the scorpion venom peptides showed antiviral activities against certain viruses, such as measles virus, SARS coronavirus, H5N1 influenza virus [27] , hepatitis B virus [49] , herpes simplex virus 1 [28] and human immunodeficiency virus [50] . As for anti-HCV peptides from scorpion venoms, Yan et al. [26] reported that Hp1090 screened from the venomous gland cDNA library of the scorpion Heterometrus petersii inhibited HCV infection by targeting the viral membrane, disrupting its structural integrity. Also, Hong et al. [43] identified another anti-HCV peptide Ctry2459 from the venom peptide library of the scorpion Chaerilus tryznai. These peptides exerted a virocidal effect on HCV and some other viruses. Consistent with those results, we observed that S. maurus palmatus venom inhibited infectivity of HCV particles, suggesting direct virocidal activity of the venom. Interestingly, the antiviral activity of S. maurus palmatus venom is likely to be preferentially directed to HCV and dengue virus, both of which are members of the family Flaviviridae. Further studies using bioactivity-guided fractionation and purification analyses are needed to identify an active compound(s) responsible for this antiviral activity.",
