            "text": "O ver the past 10 years, US health security has been threatened by a series of infectious disease events: the 2009 influenza outbreak, the emergence of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, and the rapid spread of Zika virus throughout the Americas. In each of these events, inadequate information has delayed initial detection of the outbreak, and a lack of understanding about the underlying epidemiology of the viruses hindered control efforts. As the ongoing US response to Zika illustrates, delays in detecting and responding to outbreaks can exacerbate their human and economic tolls. While the United States continues to struggle to understand how Zika virus can spread and cause serious disease, more than 37,000 cases have already been identified in the United States and its territories. 1 Each one of these cases must be investigated by health authorities to ensure that they do not spread their infection. In particular, pregnant women must be followed closely, as Zika can cause fetal death or severe birth defects. It is estimated that each baby who is born with Zika-related birth defects will cost families and the US healthcare system up to $10 million. 2 The continued challenge that the United States faces in detecting and knowing how best to respond to acute infectious disease threats like Zika should encourage a closer analysis of our current biosurveillance capabilities and spur action toward much-needed, sustainable improvements. Biosurveillance generally refers to the continued monitoring of information sources for the purposes of detecting and managing an outbreak or other public health event, whether naturally occurring or deliberate. Biosurveillance systems may gather and analyze data from a variety of human, animal, plant, and environmental health sources. The goal of this activity is to provide situational awareness-an understanding of what is going on-with respect to the occurrence of biological threats and to guide efforts to control them.",

However, national biosurveillance capabilities are threatened by shortfalls in state and local financial resources. Limits in state budgets make it difficult for agencies to maintain information systems and staff solely with local resources. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) public health emergency preparedness cooperative agreements have been essential sources of support for state and local health departments to enable them to develop and maintain basic biosurveillance capabilities. While federal preparedness investments have been an important first step, the level of federal funding for biosurveillance appropriated to date is not commensurate with the strategic national importance of these systems.

To complete this analysis, US agencies should work with states to define a minimum set of information that will be needed to manage a public health emergency and then map this information against existing biosurveillance systems. This analysis will likely identify deficits in the ability of existing surveillance systems to provide logistical information needed for mounting a response to a public health emergency. Experience in previous emergencies has shown that while most public health surveillance systems focus on data related to the number of infected patients, they often lack data pertaining to availability of hospital beds, pharmaceuticals, personal protective equipment, and other medical supplies that are necessary to make informed decisions about how best to respond to a public health emergency. The US government could bring these and other information needs to the private sector and identify potential ways to collect that data and create data-sharing provisions (eg, confidentiality agreements, de-identification steps, etc) needed to share this information with response agencies.",

Though the outbreak caught many political leaders and public health experts by surprise, existing wildlife data indicated that a human outbreak in the region was possible. 4 Despite known important linkages between animal and environmental health in determining the occurrence of events, like the Ebola epidemic, that threaten human health, there continue to be insufficient efforts to integrate knowledge and data from across these sectors. The US government should work to improve the integration of human, animal, and environmental data. An important first step will be to increase support for existing surveillance programs that have already demonstrated success, Health Security Memos to the New Administration and Congress such as ArboNET, which provides important data on the occurrence of Zika, West Nile, and other viruses. Additionally, the US government should give serious consideration to the recommendation, which was made by the bipartisan Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense, to create a Nationally Notifiable Animal Disease System. 5 Finally, the US government should improve the integration of the foodrelated surveillance initiatives that exist across the federal government. There are many different, separate national surveillance systems that, if integrated, could provide a better understanding of the occurrence and possible causes of foodborne illness outbreaks. Federal agencies should digitally connect and automate the comparisons of data from the food, animal, and human health surveillance programs that are operated by CDC, FDA, and USDA, which may provide an earlier indication of a link between human and animal infections. At the very least, there should be a way to directly compare isolated patterns that are in animal and human health surveillance programs. CDC's PulseNet and USDA's VetNet programs should be linked and equipped to automate analysis of these 2 data streams for evidence of similarities that may indicate a common exposure.",

It has been reported that because of laboratory backlogs, pregnant women in Florida have experienced delays in getting the results from tests to determine if they have been infected by Zika. Diagnostic delays such as these not only compromise care for women and their unborn children, but hinder our abilities to conduct epidemiologic investigations to determine whether and how the outbreak may be spreading. Increased support for public health and clinical laboratories is needed to ensure there is adequate surge capacity during crises. The current Zika crisis also underscores that new diagnostic technologies are needed. Currently, it is not easy to determine if someone has been infected with Zika unless they are within a small window of time after the onset of symptoms. The inability to determine with confidence whether someone was infected with Zika in the past makes it difficult to counsel patients and interrupt transmission. The US government should expand current support for efforts to develop new diagnostic technologies for Zika and other important public health threats.",

The United States should take advantage of the wisdom and talent of the crowds to improve the analysis and visualization of biosurveillance information by making anonymized surveillance data publicly available.

Without effective biosurveillance systems, political leaders will have little information to guide decisions about what measures should be taken to ensure that small outbreaks don't go on to become costly epidemics and what measures would be likely to exacerbate the toll of the event. Though important strides have been made toward development of these systems in the United States, critical gaps remain, and eroding financial support for biosurveillance threatens to undermine progress made to date.
