Therefore, the factors related to self-isolation (SI) should not be neglected, and it is important to investigate the factors leading the infected (or possibly infected) people to choose to self-isolate. In this paper, we tried to show that the theory of planned behavior provides a useful conceptual framework for SI when facing a pandemic risk, and a regression method with Chinese provincial (Guangdong Province) data was applied to investigate how attitude (ATT), subjective norms (SN), and perceived behavioral control (PBC) influence SI when facing a pandemic emergency. The results and the robustness tests confirm that ATT, SN, and PBC have a significant positive influence on SI when facing a pandemic emergency. ATT plays the most important role, followed by SN and then PBC. Based on the factors of SI, we found, through theoretical and empirical analyses, at least three important aspects that local governments need to consider to encourage citizens to self-isolate when facing a pandemic.",

The WHO reported that the next influenza pandemic \"is a matter of when, not if\" [2] , and the world must prepare for the next inevitable flu pandemic. What can we do when the pandemic comes? Outside pharmaceutical interventions, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) play an important role in delaying the first wave, reducing its peak and the spreading of new influenza cases across time [3, 4] because a pandemic vaccine will not be in place when a pandemic starts. NPIs include more actions than just self-isolation (SI), such as quarantining infected populations; the closing of borders, schools, and work places; hand-washing; the cleaning of surfaces; and so on [5] . The isolation of infected people has been applied to minimize the spread of pandemic diseases at least since the Old Testament period as an instrument for controlling and quelling the spread of viruses and contamination agents [6] . Hence, isolation is seen as a critical part of public health interventions, as it protects people by separating those who have been infected by communicable diseases from the general population [7] .",

SI means symptomatic individuals confine themselves to their homes [10] . Generally, isolation can take two forms: Mandatory and voluntary [11, 12] . Voluntary SI means that infected (or possibly infected) individuals choose to confine themselves to their homes; this intervention is generally considered capable of limiting the transmission of pandemic influenza [13, 14] and is recommended by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control [15] . The early initiation of voluntary SI can overcome the negative effects of a delay in antiviral drug distribution when enough symptomatic individuals comply with home confinement at symptom onset [14] . Overall, SI is of great importance for hampering the spread of pandemics and has been widely studied based on different methods. The effectiveness of voluntary SI largely depends on public adherence to this intervention measure [14] . Unfortunately, voluntary SI strategies may inconvenience individuals, lead to economic losses, or even contribute to moral conflicts; thus, voluntary SI remains a controversial strategy [15, 16] .",

            "text": "To date, many scholars have demonstrated the relationship between SI and the prevention of pandemics [8, 10, 12, 16] . However, the factors involved in SI should not be neglected, and it is important to investigate which factors will encourage infected (or possibly infected) people to choose self-isolation. Surveys conducted in the United States (US) and Australia during the 2009 pandemic showed that more than 80% of people were willing to stay home from work or school [17, 18] , while 53-76% of people were willing to self-isolate [17, 19] . According to the self-reported behavioral intention regarding the H1N1 influenza of university students in southwestern US, Mas et al. (2012) claimed that an array of issues may influence students' decision to self-isolate, including interpersonal, academic, environmental, and social factors [20] ; however, their analysis lacks an empirical basis. Risk perception has been widely established as a significant predictor of engagement in preventive health behaviors, including SI [21] ; those who report being unfamiliar with the term \"pandemic influenza,\" male respondents, and employed people who are not able to work from home have been found to be less willing to comply [22] . A survey in two counties in North Carolina showed that 50% of households with children under 18 and 65% of working adults reported the ability to comply with SI at home for 7-10 days if recommended to do so by the authorities [23] . Concomitantly, recent polls have shown that the willingness to comply with an SI period strongly depends on the social condition and literacy of the individual [24] . Therefore, we seek an answer to the fundamental question about what factors affect the willingness to self-isolate. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 develops a conceptual model to explain the behavior. The data description, empirical results, and regional heterogeneity test are presented in Sections 4 and 5. Finally, Section 6 presents our conclusions.",

            "text": "Several theories explain social behaviors [25] . One is the theory of planned behavior (TPB), which is widely applied to explain many types of behaviors. The TPB is a cognitive theory that provides a useful framework for predicting and identifying health-related behaviors, which are usually found to predict behavioral intentions with a high degree of accuracy. The TPB proposes that the individual is influenced by three factors (see Figure 1 ): Attitudes toward the behavior (ATT), subjective norms with respect to the behavior (SN), and perceived control over the behavior (PBC) [26, 27] . The TPB has been explored in relation to behaviors such as counterproductive work behaviors [28] , safe sexual behaviors among drug users [29] , consumption of a low-fat diet [30] , and healthy eating behaviors [31] . For all of these reasons, it is appropriate to apply the TPB to the study of SI intention when facing pandemic risk.",

ATT refers to the degree to which a person has a favorable or unfavorable evaluation or appraisal of the behavior in question [26] . The TPB is an extension of the theory of reasoned action [32, 33] , and the individual's intention is a central factor of performing a given behavior: When the intention to engage in a behavior is stronger, the behavior is more likely to be adopted [26] . Consequently, the effect of ATT on SI can be positive or negative. SN refers to the perceived social pressure to perform a behavior or not [26, 34] . People are sensitive to the conformity pressures associated with real and perceived social norms as related to risk behavior [35] . As many studies have noted, SN and ATT are suggested to exert their effects on behavior through intentions [27] . PBC refers to the perceived ease or difficulty of performing the behavior, and it is assumed to reflect past experience as well as anticipated obstacles [26] . PBC has been found to influence both behavioral intentions and actual behavior [36] . The resources and opportunities available to a person must, to some extent, dictate the likelihood of behavioral achievement [26] .",

This situation prompted us to explore the factors affecting the willingness of patients to self-isolate who may be infected in Guangdong Province. A market research company, LTD, which has a professional computerized database, was entrusted to carry out an online survey of pandemic prevention from 14 October to 3 November in 2018. The survey included the following steps. First, we determined the basic demographic characteristics such as gender, age, and education status of the respondents based on the 2017 Guangdong Internet Industry Development Report, which was published by the Guangdong Communications Administration. Second, a questionnaire was designed, which involved many aspects of SI. Third, 121 county-level units and 21 county-level city units were selected according to the statistical yearbook of Guangdong province 2018. Fourth, we transformed the designed questionnaire into a network questionnaire and sent it to the random sampling objects (2500 questionnaires) through a network link. Each interviewee was asked to provide a contact phone number.

Furthermore, government trust (GT) [49] [50] [51] , community resources (CRs) [52, 53] , and emergency services (ES) [49] are among the other variables affecting SI.",

This situation prompted us to explore the factors affecting the willingness of patients to self-isolate who may be infected in Guangdong Province. A market research company, LTD, which has a professional computerized database, was entrusted to carry out an online survey of pandemic prevention from 14 October to 3 November in 2018. The survey included the following steps. First, we determined the basic demographic characteristics such as gender, age, and education status of the respondents based on the 2017 Guangdong Internet Industry Development Report, which was published by the Guangdong Communications Administration. Second, a questionnaire was designed, which involved many aspects of SI. Third, 121 county-level units and 21 county-level city units were selected according to the statistical yearbook of Guangdong province 2018. Fourth, we transformed the designed questionnaire into a network questionnaire and sent it to the random sampling objects (2500 questionnaires) through a network link. Each interviewee was asked to provide a contact phone number. Finally, 2155 questionnaires were collected in Guangdong Province, which gives a gross response rate of 86.2% (2155/2500). After the survey, we made random checks of the respondents' URLs and contacted some interviewees to ensure that every respondent was unique. Finally, we cleaned the data and obtained 1925 respondents; some subjects were excluded due to missing values. The net response rate was thus 77% (1925/2500).",

Some researchers have explored the different influences of cancer risk [52] , enteroviruses [53] , epidemics [54] , and diabetes mellitus [55] , among other health issue, in these four parts. Therefore, we regressed on SI across different regions.",

In Eastern Guangdong, age, education, socioeconomic, trust in leadership, and families with children have important influences on SI. However, only trust in leadership and families with old people have significant effects on SI in Western Guangdong. Moreover, SI in Northern Guangdong is only affected by age.

Socioeconomic status also had a significant and positive effect on SI in models (1) and (2), which means people of high socioeconomic status may have a higher willingness to self-isolate. As for government trust, trust leadership and trust government had significant positive impacts on SI, indicating that a higher degree of government trust promotes people's willingness to self-isolate. Emergency services also had a significant positive influence on SI. Conversely, community resources are not useful for SI. One possible explanation is that if a community has more resources-such as money, food, and technology-the community will be more resilient, and people will be less willing to self-isolate because people believe that the community will address the risk of the infectious disease.",
