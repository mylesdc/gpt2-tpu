            "text": "Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is a key soluble effector of the innate immune system that recognizes pathogen-specific surface glycans. Surprisingly, low-producing MBL genetic variants that may predispose children and immunocompromised individuals to infectious diseases are more common than would be expected in human populations. Since certain immune defense molecules, such as immunoglobulins, can be exploited by invasive pathogens, we hypothesized that MBL might also enhance infections in some circumstances. Consequently, the low and intermediate MBL levels commonly found in human populations might be the result of balancing selection. Using model infection systems with pseudotyped and authentic glycosylated viruses, we demonstrated that MBL indeed enhances infection of Ebola, Hendra, Nipah and West Nile viruses in low complement conditions. Mechanistic studies with Ebola virus (EBOV) glycoprotein pseudotyped lentiviruses confirmed that MBL binds to N-linked glycan epitopes on viral surfaces in a specific manner via the MBL carbohydrate recognition domain, which is necessary for enhanced infection. MBL mediates lipid-raft-dependent macropinocytosis of EBOV via a pathway that appears to require less actin or early endosomal processing compared with the filovirus canonical endocytic pathway. Using a validated RNA interference screen, we identified C1QBP (gC1qR) as a candidate surface receptor that mediates MBL-dependent enhancement of EBOV infection. We also identified dectin-2 (CLEC6A) as a potentially novel candidate attachment factor for EBOV. Our findings support the concept of an innate immune haplotype that represents critical interactions between MBL and complement component C4 genes and that may modify susceptibility or resistance to certain glycosylated pathogens. Therefore, higher levels of native or exogenous MBL could be deleterious in the setting of relative hypocomplementemia which can occur genetically or because of immunodepletion during active infections. Our findings confirm our hypothesis that the pressure of infectious diseases may have contributed in part to evolutionary selection of MBL mutant haplotypes.

            "text": "Human mannose-binding lectin (MBL), a prototypic soluble calcium-dependent (C-type) lectin, is a key first line host defense molecule and immune regulator. MBL collaborates with a network of host defenses such as complement components and diverse cellular receptors such as C-type lectin, scavenger, and complement receptors, integrins, and Toll-like receptors (TLR) to prime long-lived adaptive immunity [3, 4] . MBL recognizes specific molecular patterns of oligosaccharides including D-mannose, Lfucose, glucose, and N-acetylglucosamine that decorate the surface of many viruses such as Ebola virus (EBOV), Hendra and Nipah viruses, HIV-1, HIV-2, influenza viruses, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [5, 6] . MBL oligomers form complexes with MBL-associated serine protease (MASP) dimers which activate the lectin complement pathway and enhance opsonophagocytosis of pathogens [5] . The average human MBL serum concentration is 1.5 mg/ml (range, 0 to .5 mg/ml) [7] but up to 30% of the human population has levels ,500 ng/ml, which may be associated with increased susceptibility to infections in young children and immunocompromised individuals [5] . Interindividual variability of MBL concentrations is caused by structural variant alleles (B, C, and D) in exon 1 of the MBL2 gene which disrupt assembly of MBL high-order oligomers and lead to reduced MBL concentrations and activity. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in the promoter region (H/L, X/Y), 59 untranslated region (P/Q) and other regulatory sites also modify serum concentrations. Together, these sequence variations define at least 7 common human MBL haplotypes that dictate MBL concentrations and complement-activating capacity. MBL variant alleles are present in approximately 20% to 50% of individuals. Higher rates occur in indigenous people from Africa and South America [8] . The reason for such high rates of sequence variations is an unresolved controversy [9, 10] . It has been postulated that a high-producing ancestral haplotype (A allele) evolved into multiple low MBL-producing haplotypes because of heterotic balanced selection in which individuals carrying structural and regulatory heterozygous polymorphisms had a survival advantage [11] . It is not known whether viral infections exerted such selective pressure over time.",

We previously demonstrated that recombinant human MBL (rhMBL) binds EBOV GP 1,2 (referred to as GP) lentiviral virion-like particles and wild-type-like EBOV in a specific and dose-dependent manner [6, 14] . Treatment of mice infected with 3,0006LD 50 native EBOV using supraphysiological dosages of rhMBL had a protective effect which required intact complement component 3 (C3) function [15] .

First, viruses bind to attachment factors and/ or cognate receptors which help concentrate the virus on the cell surface. Upon binding, receptors then promote endocytosis or trigger direct fusion of viral and host cell-membranes [16] . EBOV is internalized primarily by macropinocytosis [17] whereas certain other viruses enter cells via clathrin-coated pits, caveolar/lipid-raft structures, or clathrin2 and caveolin/raft-independent mecha-nisms [16] . In general, the specificity of receptor binding determines cell tropism, and the type of receptor engaged by the virus determines the choice of endocytic pathway. Notably, EBOV has very broad cell tropism, especially later in the course of infection, and it may bind to multiple attachment factors, notable among which are numerous lectins (DC-SIGN/L-SIGN, MGL [CLEC10A], LSECtin [CLEC4G]) and Niemann-Pick C1 endosomal membrane protein. In addition, Tyro3 family members (Axl, Dtk, Mer) and b1 integrins which are widely expressed have been implicated in Ebola-GP mediated cell entry [13, 18] . T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 1 (TIM-1) was recently proposed as an epithelial receptor that binds the EBOV GP 1 receptor binding region [19] but the cognate receptor(s) of monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells have yet to be identified.",

            "text": "MBL has been described as an ''ante-antibody'' which represents a primitive non-clonal form of humoral immunity and which evolutionarily predated antibodies [26] . Analogous to antibodies, MBL mediates opsonophagocytosis and it can bind to cellular receptors via its collagenous tail [27] . In addition, MBL has structural and functional homology with C1q which binds cognate cellular receptors and/or activates the complement pathway via actions of serine proteases [28] . Given the functional similarities between MBL and either antibodies or C1q, we considered that a novel MBL receptor-mediated mechanism for enhancing infection by EBOV and other viruses whose virions are highly glycosylated might explain some of the heterotic balanced selection that may contribute to the evolutionary divergence of human MBL haplotypes. Given our proposed model that lectins might enhance EBOV infection, we investigated the possibility that human MBL could enhance infection of human cells by EBOV GP-pseudotyped lentiviruses, wild-type-like EBOV and other glycosylated virions in low complement conditions. After initial confirmation of our model, we pursued mechanistic studies of the dynamics of MBLmediated endocytosis and identified candidate MBL and viral receptors using an RNA interference (RNAi) approach.",

Monocyte-derived macrophages were prepared and maintained as described above. The inoculum consisted of 1200 pg p24/100 ml for each viral construct unless indicated otherwise. 1200 pg HIV p24 corresponds approximately to 2610 7 HIV-EBOZ GP virion-like particles according to the formula: p24 mass 6 (1 mol/MW p24 [24,000 g/mol]) 6 (6.02610 23 molecules/1 mol) 6 (1 virion/2000 molecules).

Reagents were diluted in DMEM or Veronal-buffered saline (VBS, barbital 2.5 mM, sodium barbital 1.5 mM, NaCl 0.14 M) to achieve optimal rates of infection. The final CaCl 2 concentration was 5 mM unless indicated otherwise.

We previously demonstrated that rhMBL effectively inhibited infection of human cells by EBOV GP-pseudotyped lentiviral virions and wild typelike EBOV in the presence of active complement in serum [6, 15] . In the course of those experiments, we were not surprised to confirm that complement was essential for the inhibitory effects of rhMBL. In its absence, we found preliminary evidence suggesting a paradoxical rhMBL-dependent increase in EBOV infection in a variety of human cell lines including 293F cells, which produced highly reproducible results and which potentially bind the EBOV receptor binding region to a greater extent than 293 T cells [48] . Given the wealth of examples where viruses subvert immune defense molecules during virus entry and given the evidence for selective pressure against high-producing MBL haplotypes in human populations, we sought to define the mechanisms by which MBL might enhance infection of human cells by EBOV. We also evaluated the effects of MBL on infection by other glycosylated viruses in low complement states to determine whether this mechanism was relevant for glycosylated viruses in general.",

            "text": "Given that MBL and activation of the lectin complement pathway are required to block EBOV infection [6, 14, 15] , we questioned what effect inactivation of complement would have on MBL's capacity to enhance viral infection. MBL forms a complex with MBL-associated serine proteases (MASPs) and upon binding to pathogens, MBL-MASPs sequentially cleave complement components C4 and C2. The catalytic products of these complement components form the C4b2a complex which acts as the C3 convertase, a key enzyme in the lectin complement pathway. Cleavage and processing of C3 by the C3 convertase produces several C3-derived components (e.g. iC3b) that are potent activators of the immune system. iC3b binds complement receptor 3 (CR3) leading to enhanced phagocytosis by professional phagocytes and increased cytotoxicity by NK cells. Based on the fact that complement is heat labile, we showed that heat inactivation of serum reversed its inhibitory effect on viral infection at higher serum concentrations, which contained higher native MBL levels, albeit to varying extents ( Figure 1E ). To further define the critical contribution of complement, we compared the effects of human sera from which C2 was removed by immune precipitation and that contained or lacked native MBL ( Figure 1F) . Notably, C2-depleted MBL-replete serum enhanced infection maximally at a 50% dilution at which MBL's concentration was greatest, an effect that could be reversed by supplementation with were performed twice in quadruplicate. (D) We preincubated HIV-EBOV-GP virion-like particles with 5% serum from 35 ethnically diverse individuals. Shown are associations between level of infection and native MBL activity (mannan-binding or C4 cleavage) for each individual (r 2 = 0.83, serum C4 cleavage activity; r 2 = 0.85, serum MBL-mannan binding). Experiments were performed in quadruplicate. (E) We preincubated HIV-EBOV-GP virion-like particles with 5% heat-inactivated serum (56uC for 30 minutes) from three individuals with varying MBL levels before infection of cells. (F) We preincubated HIV-EBOV GP virion-like particles with media or sera (diluted to 1-50%) that were complement component 2 (C2)-replete or depleted, and that lacked or contained approximately equivalent MBL concentrations (535-650 ng/ml). In addition, C2 depleted serum was reconstituted with recombinant human C2 (6.5 mg/ml) for comparison. Experiments were performed twice in quadruplicate. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0060838.g001 recombinant human C2.

Unlike PNGase F, endo H leaves a single GlcNAc residue which is a potential binding site for MBL ( Figure 3A, B) . First, we confirmed that the endoglycosidases did in fact remove highmannose moieties from GP of endoglycosidase-treated HIV-EBOV viruses. We proved this with a western blot using biotinylated Hippeastrum hybrid (amaryllis) lectin to detect amannose residues (the hybrid lectin does not bind to a-glucosyl structures); high-mannose was present in substantial quantities only in untreated, non-deglycosylated virus ( Figure S3 ). We found that PNGase F inhibited infection in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of rhMBL ( Figure 3C ), whereas heat-inactivated PNGase F did not inhibit infection ( Figure 3D ). In contrast to this effect, neither active nor heat-inactivated endo H inhibited infection ( Figure 3C, D) .",

The amiloride analog, EIPA which is important for macropinosome formation [54] , inhibited infection of HEK293F cells both in the presence or absence of rhMBL indicating that macropinocytosis is the primary mechanism of entry ( Figure 4A ). Amiloride hydrochloride, which also inhibits macropinocytosis, produced similar results ( Figure S5) . The absence of a differential effect of methyl-b-cyclodextrin likewise suggested that lipid rafts were required for viral infection regardless of the presence of MBL ( Figure 4B ).

We then infected cells with HIV-EBOV GP in quadruplicate in the presence or absence of rhMBL.

The RNAi Consortium at the Broad Institute previously validated the specificity of all five cathepsin-L shRNAs with gene transcription assays (S. Silver, personal communication). We did not perform a western blot to validate reduced protein expression. We then proceeded to demonstrate that knockdown of MGL (CLEC10A) reduced infections by 47-88% ( Figure S6 ). We verified knockdown of MGL gene expression by measuring mRNA transcripts relative to non-targeting shRNA controls and demonstrated variable reductions of 15%, .95% and 55% for MGL shRNA constructs 2, 3 and 4, respectively ( Figure  S6 ; Methods S1). However, in our hands, there were no significant differences in protein expression compared with an empty pLK0.1 control vector (data not shown). We also found a 70% reduction in infection of cells treated with one TYRO3 shRNA which reduced gene expression by 62% but did not reduce protein expression (data not shown). These findings are not conclusive but do not conflict with the roles that these proteins have been reported by others to play in EBOV pathogenesis [43, 47] .",

Knockdown of protein expression was confirmed by western blots in which single clear bands were detected for CLEC6A ( Figure 6B ) and for C1QBP ( Figure 6D ). After adjusting for variations in protein loading relative to actin controls, we confirmed that protein expression of CLEC6A was reduced by 40% to 65% by each of four shRNAs ( Figure 6B ) and that of C1QBP was reduced by 48% to 68% by each of three shRNAs ( Figure 6D ) compared with that of the empty pLK0.1 control vector.

As seen for pseudotyped viruses, MBL-dependent enhanced infection was blocked by preincubating rhMBL with mannan ( Figure S7 ) or pretreatment of cells with tunicamycin in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure S7 ). To evaluate the generalizeability of our observations for other glycosylated viruses, we tested three additional native viral infection models. RhMBL enhanced native Nipah and Hendra viral infections in hypocomplementemic conditions by 20 to 35%, respectively ( Figure 7B ). In addition, rhMBL significantly enhanced West Nile virion-like particle transduction by 150 to 300% in low complement conditions but it had no effect on a glycosylation-deficient WNV N154Q mutant strain ( Figure 7C ).",

Since MBL deficiency was first discovered as a cause of a common opsonic defect in children [56] , a better understanding of its diverse functions has evolved [5] . MBL binds to invariant glycans on diverse microorganisms including EBOV [6, 14] , upregulates opsonophagocytosis, activates the lectin complement pathway, amplifies host responses in cooperation with TLR2/6, and differentially regulates cytokine production [4, 57, 58 ]. Yet, a cogent explanation for the evolutionary selection of low-producing MBL haplotypes, particularly in indigenous Africans and South Americans, is lacking [9, 10, 59] . We describe for the first time that MBL enhances EBOV, WNV infections, and to a lesser extent Hendra and Nipah viruses in low complement conditions. These findings suggest that certain infectious diseases may have negatively selected high-producing MBL genotypes and they provide new insights in EBOV pathogenesis.",

Based on the repertoire of MBL's typical ligands, we hypothesized that the targets were glycoproteins, which are critical for virus stability, cell tropism, immune evasion, and host cell invasion. EBOV, and other viruses such as Hendra and Nipah viruses, WNV, hepatitis C virus, HIV-1, HIV-2, influenza viruses, metapneumoviruses, and SARS-corona virus use host cell machinery to modify viral surface proteins by Nlinked glycosylation. This process involves attaching a highmannose core to the amide nitrogen of asparagines followed by trimming and remodeling of viral oligosaccharides in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus [60] . EBOV GPs are heavily glycosylated with Nand O-linked glycans that constitute more than one-third of their molecular mass [61] . The majority of N-linked glycans are concentrated in the GP1 glycan cap and mucin-like region, which are reminiscent of the glycan shields of HIV gp120 and Epstein-Barr virus gp350. Other investigators have speculated that glycans may help EBOV evade immune responses by masking the putative EBOV receptorbinding region [62, 63] . But viral glycans may also be recognized by C-type lectin receptors that are either membrane-associated (e.g. DC-SIGN [42] ) or soluble (e.g. MBL [6] ), and several viruses can hijack these type of molecules to enter cells and propagate [60] .",

Furthermore, MBLenhanced HIV-EBOV GP infection was significantly diminished after deglycosylation of virions using PNGase F [50, 64] but not endo H, which leaves an exposed N-acetylglucosamine residue on the polypeptide chain that may serve as a ligand for MBL ( Figure 3C,D) . These findings were confirmed by the fact that MBL-mediated enhancement of viral infection was abrogated by thermolysin-treated HIV-EBOV GP virions in a thermolysinconcentration dependent manner ( Figure S4) . MBL also had a significantly reduced capacity to enhance EBOV infection when the GP lacked a portion of the glycosylated mucin-rich region ( Figure 1B) . It is noteworthy, however, that infection levels of EBOV with mutated GP were higher than those of wild-type GP pseudotypes, likely because absence of the GP's mucin-rich region exposed the putative EBOV receptor binding region which facilitated infection of cells [33] . On the other hand, MBL did not enhance infection by VSV-G pseudotyped virions indicating to some extent MBL's selectivity.",

            "text": "These findings raised the question whether MBL can cross-link the virus to putative cell surface receptors. It is known that EBOV protects itself from host immunity by down-regulating host proteins including immune regulatory molecules and receptors such as MHC1 and b1 integrins via steric occlusion, referred to as the ''glycan umbrella'' effect [50, 65] . To circumvent this constraint on infection, we propose that EBOV may exploit putative MBL receptors to enter cells with or without engaging EBOV-specific receptors. Although the cognate receptor/s for MBL are not known with certainty, potential receptors for MBL include CD93 (C1qRp), CD35 (complement receptor 1, CR1), calreticulin (cC1qR), CD91, and the binding protein for the globular domain of C1q (gC1qBP/gC1qR/C1QBP) [4, 28] , all of which have proven and/or predicted N-linked glycopeptides [66, 67] . Therefore, we tested whether reduction of N-linked glycoprotein receptor expression [68] by chemical (tunicamycin) or genetic (HEK293S GnTI 2 cells) approaches could reduce MBL-mediated HIV-EBOV GP infection. Tunicamycin, which completely inhibits N-linked glycosylation, abrogated MBL-mediated pseudotyped EBOV infection to a greater extent than other downstream N-glycan-trimming agents such as deoxynojirimycin and swainsonine which leave residual mannose or GlcNAc residues ( Figure 3E ). Similarly, HEK293S N-linked glycosylationdeficient cells were resistant to MBL-mediated enhancement ( Figure 3F ). Taken together, these results showed that MBL interacts with N-linked glycoproteins trafficked via the ER and Golgi apparatus. This finding is corroborated by the fact that the collagenous stalk of MBL binds to calreticulin, a putative receptor [27] and lung collectins (surfactant proteins A and D) can also bind ligands via their collagenous tails [69] .",

            "text": "The mechanisms of EBOV attachment and internalization have been studied extensively [17, 19, 45, 47, 50, 53, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75] . EBOV attaches to various putative attachment factors on the cell surface [13] where they undergo either clathrin/caveolae/ dynamin-independent, actin/lipid raft-dependent macropinocytosis-like endocytosis [17, 70, 74] or clathrin/caveolae/dynamindependent endocytosis [75] depending on type of target cells involved. Virions are then trafficked through early and late endosomes where they undergo proteolysis in acidified endocytic vesicles by cathepsin L and/or B which remove the mucin-like region of GP leading to enhanced viral binding and infectivity [17, 19, 33, 45, 46, 47, 70] . Previous studies used replication-competent infectious EBOV, EBOV virion-like particles or pseudotyped lentiviruses. Findings from our infection assay using EBOV GP pseudotyped lentiviruses agreed with those of Saeed et al., who used wild type viruses, to the extent that EBOV undergoes macropinocytosis-like endocytosis ( Figure 4A ) in a lipid raftdependent ( Figure 4B ) and dynamin-independent ( Figure S5 ) manner [17, 74] . In addition, we found that MBL diminished the dependence on actin filaments (but not microtubules) and early endosomal acidification [70, 76] for infection ( Figure 4C -F, Figure  S5 ), suggesting that MBL may traffic viruses via a non-canonical pathway that resembles the clathrin/caveolin/dynamin/actinindependent, and microtubule-dependent endocytic pathway utilized by lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) and recombinant LCMV-Lassa virus GP infectious virions [77] . Further detailed mechanistic studies are required to confirm these findings.",

We conducted an RNAi screen using at least 4 unique shRNA-expressing vectors per gene to mitigate the impact of differential effectiveness and possibility of off-target effects of shRNAs [40] . We tested our assay by comparing levels of HIV-EBOV GP infection after knocking down CTSL1 ( Figure S6 ) [47] and the reduced infectivity was consistent with the known role of CTSL1 in mediating viral entry. Using the same techniques, we revealed that knock down of C1QBP by three shRNA constructs (confirmed by western blot, Figure 6D ) reduced HIV-EBOV GP infection to variable extents in two of the three shRNA treatments (variability of shRNAs is well described). Notably, knock down of C1QBP by both shRNAs was augmented in the presence of MBL but to a significantly greater extent for the most effective shRNA (65% to 90% reduction of infection, p,0.005) suggesting that MBL plays a supplementary role in mediating viral entry ( Figure 6C, D) . C1QBP is a tetrameric transmembrane surface protein expressed on human monocytes and a variety of other cells. It binds the globular heads of C1q via its amino terminus with high affinity and contains three potential N-glycosylation sites [78] . C1QBP has been implicated in innate and adaptive immunity. Viral ligands have been shown to activate C1QBP translocation which inhibits RIG-1, an RNA helicase, which in turn inhibits antiviral signaling by downregulating type I interferons [79] . Given that induction of RIG-1 inhibits EBOV replication [80] we speculate that EBOV-MBL complexes activate C1QBP which then negatively regulates RIG-1 inhibition of viral infection, thereby enhancing viral proliferation. However, it is not clear how C1QBP avoids binding to circulating MBL under normal physiological conditions. One hypothesis is that MBL undergoes a conformational change upon binding to viral and other targets [81] . This in turn could expose potential binding sites in MBL's collagenous stalk for engagement with C1QBP.",

Tobin et al. [87] identified mutations in zebrafish and human leukotriene A4 hydrolase genes that conferred heterozygous advantage against Mycobacterium marinum and tuberculosis, respectively. These results set a groundbreaking precedent in our understanding of how SNPs in a single human gene can dictate dichotomous inflammatory states: either inadequate or excessive immune responses can result in increased severity of TB meningitis in humans. Similarly, we speculate that under certain circumstances both high and low levels of MBL may predispose individuals to certain infectious diseases. Furthermore, our hypothesis that high levels of MBL may be deleterious is supported conceptually by a recent report that demonstrated a role for MBL in mediating immune pathology in a mouse model of Ross River virus (RRV) arthritis; high MBL levels in serum and synovial fluid of humans with RRV correlated with disease severity [88] . MBL has also been implicated in murine models of pandemic H1N1 influenza A and H9N2 avian influenza A as a risk factor for severe disease by upregulating inflammatory responses [89] . There is also evidence that inhibition of the lectin pathway confers considerable protection against non-infectious disorders such myocardial and gastrointestinal ischemia/reperfusion injury [90] . Therefore, it is possible that evolutionary selection of mutant MBL alleles conferred protection against a variety of pathogens and/or reduced the deleterious effects of complementmediated inflammation [8, 11, 83, 84, 85] . Other examples of preserved heterozygozity include sickle-cell trait which protects against malaria despite its disadvantage in healthy populations. Also, a persistent regulatory mutation in the Duffy antigen chemokine receptor confers resistance to malaria.",

            "text": "Wide variations in plasma concentrations of MBL and certain complement components occur naturally. These variations are due to diversity of genotypes of MBL and complement component C4, which is encoded by 2 to 8 copies of the C4 gene [91] , as well as other complement components. Partial C4 deficiency is one of the most common immune protein deficiencies in humans. It is caused by a complex pattern of differences in gene size, gene number, and nucleotide polymorphisms. Specifically, homoexpression or deletion of C4A or C4B is estimated to occur in 19-34% of normal Caucasians [92, 93] . Total C4A deficiency occurs in 1% and C4B deficiency in 10% of the Finnish population [94] . The mean C4 protein levels vary between 0.26 and 0.49 g/L in European Americans and Asian Indian populations [93, 95] . However, it is notable that total C4 protein levels span a 1-log range (approximately 0.1 to 1.0 g/L) with higher concentrations correlating with a larger number of gene copies [93, 95] . Although the prevalence of homozygous C2 deficiency in Caucasians is rare (approximately 1/20,000), partial C2 deficiency is estimated to affect about 1% of western Europeans [96] . In addition, certain infectious diseases may modulate complement levels e.g. acute malaria is a pervasive ancient infectious disease that can cause hypocomplementemia [97, 98] . Furthermore, complement may be reduced to varying extents by certain auto-immune conditions that drive immune complex formation, although these events are relatively rare. To investigate our hypothesis that relatively low levels of complement may permit MBL to enhance viral infection, we performed infection assays in serially diluted serum. We observed that serum containing higher concentrations of native MBL enhanced HIV-EBOV GP infection to the greatest extent when serum was diluted by at least 10-fold ( Figure 1C) . We then showed that the critical factor in serum (diluted only 2-fold) that abrogated MBL's capacity to enhance infection is complement (specifically C2; Figure 1F ). It is in this context that we modeled viral infections using high level rhMBL (10 mg/ml) in 5% serum (i.e. diluted 20-fold). However, such a high concentration of rhMBL is considered supraphysiological if adjusted for the 20-fold dilution factor of serum.",

            "text": "Although human MBL is produced primarily in the liver, extrahepatic MBL synthesis has been found in the gastrointestinal tract, middle ear fluid, and nasopharyngeal secretions. It is possible that MBL2 expression can be differentially induced in various compartments in response to different stimuli [99] . Similarly, extrahepatic complement synthesis and regulation may influence local concentrations of complement [100] . Furthermore, dysfunctional MASP-2 variants may attenuate its capacity to activate complement [101] . The frequency of deficient or non-functional MASP-2 ranges from 2% to 19% in different populations with the highest values in Africans [102] . We speculate that relative MBL excess in the setting of relatively low C4 levels or deficient MASP-2 may lead to MBL-mediated enhanced viral infections in clinical settings. Thus, we propose that MBL, C4 and MASP-2, among others contribute to a lattice of immune molecules that represent an individual's ''innate immune haplotype''. Individually, these effectors may not necessarily dictate the outcome of infections, but the aggregate immunological state may influence a person's susceptibility or resistance to infection.",

Therefore, the observed interactions between HIV-EBOV-GP and host attachment factors may be artificial. However, we showed a similar phenomenon with wild type-like EBOV and other glycosylated viruses. Furthermore, it has been shown that all the GPs of all the Ebolaviruses (EBOV and relatives) contain high-mannose and hybrid N-linked glycans independent of the cell line used for viral propagation [64] . Another limitation of our study was the lack of direct evidence from humans that complement components (specifically C4 or C2) are sufficiently low in vivo in certain circumstances to permit MBL to mediate enhanced uptake of glycosylated viruses. We used media supplemented with 5% human serum which is only half the concentration of fetal calf or fetal bovine serum typically used for EBOV infectivity assays [17, 18, 44, 45, 67] . Given that C4 gene copy number variations may lead to a proportionate reduction of circulating C4 [88] , we speculate that the experimental ratios of MBL:C4 used in this study are physiologically plausible. A recent clinical study by Kainulainen et al. [94] provided preliminary data which are consistent with our hypothesis that synergy between C4 deficiency and MBL excess may predispose children and adolescents to certain infections: 26% (n = 22) of Finnish patients with recurrent respiratory infections vs.14% (n = 10) of healthy controls (p = 0.048) had C4A deficiency. Not unexpectedly, 50% of the patients with C4A deficiency had MBL concentrations .1.5 mg/ml, the mean human MBL serum concentration but notably, more than one-third had very high MBL levels (.4 mg/ ml). Further clinical studies are required to investigate the significance of this apparent association.",

            "text": "In conclusion, this study reveals MBL's complex role in infections caused by EBOV and other glycosylated viruses. MBL, which is a key innate immune molecule, seemingly has paradoxical functions depending on the levels of complement [6, 15] . We demonstrate for the first time the phenomenon of MBL-dependent enhancement of infections caused by glycosylated virions in low complement conditions and discover roles for C1QBP and dectin-2 in EBOV pathogenesis. We postulate that an individual's innate immune haplotype is defined by the interactions between the genotypes of MBL, C4 and possibly others. Our findings highlight the possibility that administration of supraphys-iological doses of MBL products or blood products with high MBL concentrations to individuals in the setting of infectious diseases and relative hypocomplementemia may be deleterious under certain conditions. On the other hand, it is intriguing to consider that MBL might be used as an adjuvant to enhance delivery of glycosylated vaccine epitopes to effectors of the immune system. Finally, these findings suggest that the pressure of infectious diseases may have driven, in part, the evolutionary selection of MBL mutant haplotypes that encode low or intermediate MBL serum levels in the majority of humans. Figure S1 RhMBL enhances HIV-EBOV GP infection in a calcium-dependent manner. We preincubated HIV-EBOV-GP virion-like particles with rhMBL in 5% MBL-deficient serum and Veronal-buffered saline with or without calcium supplementation. *, ** and { p,0.05 (5 mM CaCl 2 versus 0 or 2 mM CaCl 2 at 0, 0.1 and 1 mg/ml rhMBL, respectively); { p,0.001 (all pairwise comparison at 10 mg/ml rhMBL). Experiments were performed twice in quadruplicate. (EPS) Figure S2 MBL activity in sera from a panel of healthy subjects. We measured native MBL concentrations (mannanbinding activity) and MBL C4 cleavage activity in sera from 35 healthy adult volunteers of Caucasian, Asian, Hispanic or African-American ancestry (females, n = 20). The sample had a 3.7 log 10 range of MBL concentrations (0-5,424 ng/mL) that were strongly correlated with the concordant MBL C4 cleavage values (0-7,468 U/mL; r 2 = 0.91). The sample included three individuals with homozygous MBL2 null alleles (B, C, D) who had no detectable MBL (lower limits of detection: MBL concentration, 0.6 ng/ml; C4 cleavage activity, 1.6 U/ml). As expected, significantly more individuals with wild-type MBL2 haplotypes (A/A) had MBL concentration .500 ng/ml (12/21 vs 2/14, p,0.03) and MBL C4 cleavage activity .500 U/mL (13/21 vs 1/ 14, p,0.005) compared with MBL2 O/O or O/A haplotypes (O refers to B,C or D alleles). (EPS) Figure S3 Endoglycosidases cleave N-linked glycans in HIV-EBOV GP. We preincubated HIV-EBOZ GP virion-like particles (12,000 pg/ml) with PNGase F or endo H (10,000 U/ml each) diluted in DMEM or with DMEM alone for 1 hour at 37uC. Viruses then underwent gel electrophoresis; products were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane and were detected by further incubation with biotinylated Hippeastrum Hybrid Lectin (1:500) followed by streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (HRP; 1:5000). Membranes were then incubated with Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent AP substrate and exposed to autoradiography film. High-mannose moieties were preserved only in untreated virus confirming that PNGase F and endo H effectively cleaved high-mannose residues on GPs of HIV-EBOV virion-like particles. (EPS) Figure S4 Thermolysin treatment of HIV-EBOV GP abrogates enhancement of infection by rhMBL in a thermolysin-concentration dependent manner. We preincubated HIV-EBOV GP virion-like particles (1200 pg p24/ 100 mL) without or with thermolysin (31.3, 62.5, 125, 250 mg/ ml) in buffer (40 mM HEPES, 40 mM MES, 50 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM CaCl 2 ) shaking for 30 minutes at 37uC. The reactions were then terminated with 0.1 mM EDTA. HEK293F cells were infected with thermolysin-treated virion-like particles mixed with MBL carbohydrate recognition domains (CRD) bind to highly glycosylated mucin-rich regions of EBOV GP and the MBL-virion complex is presented to the cell surface. Then MBL binds to cognate cellular receptors, such as C1QBP or calreticulin [6] via MBL collagenous stalks. In this manner, MBL concentrates virus at the cell surface and may facilitate cross-linking of EBOV to its cognate receptor or to other attachment factors such as dectin-2, which may facilitate subsequent membrane fusion and internalization. The relatively large size of EBOV particles (800 to 1,400 nm) is amenable to bulk fluid-phase uptake pathways such as macropinocytosis which is the canonical pathway for EBOV entry. Our data indicate that MBL also mediates internalization of virus via macropinocytosis but suggests that MBL-mediated uptake preferentially utilizes microtubules compared with the canonical EBOV pathway which is dependent on both microtubules and actin. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0060838.g008 MBL-deficient (,0.6 ng/ml) 5% human serum alone or with the same supplemented with 10 mg/ml rhMBL as described in Materials and Methods. Luciferase values were adjusted for cell viability using alamarBlue (resazurin reduction assay). Shown are average adjusted luciferase results from two experiments each with four replicates. The maximal reduction of viral infection was 17fold in the presence of rhMBL, whereas there was no inhibition of infection in the absence of MBL. (EPS) Figure S5 MBL-mediated macropinocytosis of HIV-EBOV GP may bypass early endosomes and is dynamin independent. We preincubated HEK293F cells with (A) amiloride hydrochloride, an inhibitor of Na + /H + exchanger activity, (B) bafilomycin A1, a specific and potent inhibitor of vacuolar H + ATPase in early endosomes, (C) monensin, an inhibitor of both endosomal acidification and receptor recycling, and (D) dynasore, a potent and specific dynamin inhibitor (which is involved in clathrin-and caveolin-mediated endocytosis) in 5% MBL-deficient serum in the absence or presence of rhMBL at 37uC for 1 hour. We then infected cells with HIV-EBOV-GP virion-like particles (1200 pg p24/100 ml). Percentages of infected cells are relative to DMSO controls (a methanol control was used for monensin). Luciferase values were adjusted for cell viability using alamarBlue (resazurin reduction assay). Significant differences are shown. Experiments were performed twice in quadruplicate. (EPS) Figure S6 shRNA knockdown of cathepsin-L (CTSL1) and MGL (CLEC10A). We performed RNA interference with a pLK0.1 vector encoding shRNAs that targeted (A) CTSL1 and (B) MGL (CLEC10A) as described for Figure 6 . Luciferase values were adjusted for cell viability. Percentage change in infection was normalized to an empty pLK0.1 control vector. (EPS) Figure S7 rhMBL targets N-linked glycans on surfaces of wild type-like EBOV and HEK293T cells. (A) We preincubated 5% MBL-deficient serum (with or without MBL supplementation) with media or mannan (1 mg/ml) at 37uC for 1 hour. Then we incubated wild type-like EBOV-eGFP (1976 Mayinga variant) with the above preparations at 37uC for 1 hour. Finally, we infected 4610 4 HEK293T cells with virions at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1. (B) We preincubated (i) HEK293T cells with varying concentrations of tunicamycin and (ii) wild typelike EBOV-eGFP with 5% MBL-deficient serum (with or without rhMBL supplementation) at 37uC for 1 hour. Then we infected 4610 4 HEK293T cells with virus at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1. Fluorescence was assayed 72 hours after infection. Significant differences are shown. Experiments were performed in triplicate. (EPS) ",

We used luciferase-encoding HIV-EBOV-GP virion-like particles to infect 5610 3 adherent HEK293F cells.

(A-D) We targeted 24 candidate lectin, scavenger and other putative receptors using pLKO.1 lentiviral vectors that expressed 4 or 5 unique short hairpin RNA (shRNA) constructs per gene. We transduced HEK293F cells in quadruplicate using 4.6610 8 viral particles (shRNA-expressing vectors or empty control vectors) with hexadimethrine bromide (6 mg/ml) at 37uC for 18 hours. We selected transduced cells with 5 mg/ml puromycin over 48 hours and determined cell viability with alamarBlue reagent (resazurin reduction assay). We then infected cells in quadruplicate with HIV-EBOV GP virion-like particles (1000 pg p24/100 ml) with or without rhMBL. After 48 hours we measured rates of single-round infection (luciferase assay) and adjusted results for cell viability.Percentage change in infection was normalized to the empty pLK0.1 control vector (CTRL). Shown are positive hits (A, C) which were defined as $66% reduction in infection by at least two shRNA constructs for any particular gene. Reductions in protein expression produced by shRNAs (western blots; B, D) relative to that produced by the empty pLK0.1 control vector are shown.
