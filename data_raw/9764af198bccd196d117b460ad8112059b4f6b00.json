While testing/removal and vaccination led to a decreased prevalence of FeLV, recently, this decrease has reportedly stagnated in some countries. This study aimed to prospectively determine the prevalence of FeLV viraemia in cats taken to veterinary facilities in 32 European countries. FeLV viral RNA was semiquantitatively detected in saliva, using RT-qPCR as a measure of viraemia. Risk and protective factors were assessed using an online questionnaire to report geographic, demographic, husbandry, FeLV vaccination, and clinical data. The overall prevalence of FeLV viraemia in cats visiting a veterinary facility, of which 10.4% were shelter and rescue cats, was 2.3% (141/6005; 95% CI: 2.0%-2.8%) with the highest prevalences in Portugal, Hungary, and Italy/Malta (5.7%-8.8%). Using multivariate analysis, seven risk factors (Southern Europe, male intact, 1-6 years of age, indoor and outdoor or outdoor-only living, living in a group of \u22655 cats, illness), and three protective factors (Northern Europe, Western Europe, pedigree cats) were identified. Using classification and regression tree (CART) analysis, the origin of cats in Europe, pedigree, and access to outdoors were important predictors of FeLV status. FeLV-infected sick cats shed more viral RNA than FeLV-infected healthy cats, and they suffered more frequently from anaemia, anorexia, and gingivitis/stomatitis than uninfected sick cats. Most cats had never been FeLV-vaccinated; vaccination rates were indirectly associated with the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. In conclusion, we identified countries where FeLV was undetectable, demonstrating that the infection can be eradicated and highlighting those regions where awareness and prevention should be increased. supervision, methodology, R.H.-L., M.L.M., and H.L.; project administration and resources, H.L. and R.H.-L.; funding acquisition, H.L.; project administration (communication with country representatives and local veterinarians), investigation, N.S. and E.G.; project administration (country representatives: local administration including translation, interaction with the local veterinarians, sample collection and returning):",

            "text": "Feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) is a gammaretrovirus that infects domestic cats and closely related wild felids worldwide. Since the first description of the virus in 1964 in feline lymphoma tissue [1] , increasing knowledge has been gained concerning the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of the infection [2, 3] . FeLV infection can lead to fatal diseases in cats with progressive infection [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Testing and eradication programs and the introduction of effective vaccines led to a decrease in FeLV prevalence in many countries in the last 30 years [7, [10] [11] [12] . However, more recently, the decrease of the FeLV prevalence has stagnated [13] [14] [15] . In other countries, such as Denmark, FeLV is rarely detected nowadays [16] . For the USA, Canada, and Australia, large prevalence studies have been published [10, 13, [17] [18] [19] . There have also been some recent studies on the prevalence of FeLV in single European countries [15, [20] [21] [22] . However, there has been no pan-European study determining the current FeLV prevalence in domestic cats. FeLV prevalence can vary considerably depending on the composition of the investigated cat population; feral or stray cats versus privately owned cats, cats in shelters or from breeders, clinically healthy cats or sick cats [17, [23] [24] [25] . In addition, preselection of the samples has an influence; e.g., if samples are obtained only from cats suspected of being infected with FeLV. A recent meta-analysis [26] suggested an indirect relation between FeLV prevalence and the yearly gross domestic product (GDP) per capita using purchasing power parity (PPP) [27] , i.e., the total value of all the goods and services produced by a country in a particular year, divided by the number of people living there and corrected for purchasing power using a \"basket of goods\". However, no FeLV prevalence data were available for many European countries, or the data were obtained several years ago.",

The study protocol included cats from 32 European countries in the survey. In order to avoid any preselection of the cats (apart from visiting a veterinary facility), 10 animals arriving consecutively at each facility were tested independently of the reason for the veterinary appointment. Risk and protective factors for FeLV infection were determined using the demographic, husbandry, clinical as well as FeLV vaccination history data from each cat. Furthermore, using our data, we tested the recently postulated hypothesis of a correlation between the FeLV prevalence and the GDP in European countries, and extended the analysis to test also for a potential correlation with FeLV vaccination rates. For minimally invasive sample collection and to avoid bias by requesting blood collection, saliva swabs were collected and analysed by RT-qPCR; the detection of viral RNA by RT-qPCR in saliva was shown to be an excellent measure of FeLV viraemia [28] .",

According to the policy coordinator of the European Union Commission (Directorate-General for Environment, Unit Chemicals), no animal testing permit was required for this study, mainly because of the non-invasive method of sample collection, sample collection occurring during regular visits to veterinary practices, and the handling of the cats by veterinary professionals. In Switzerland, the study was officially approved by the veterinary offices of the Swiss cantons (approval number: ZH 121/16, issued 11 August 2016) and conducted according to Swiss laws. Written informed consent was obtained from each cat owner by the participating veterinarians in all countries. The sample collection was conducted from September 2016 to March 2017. 1 Countries and country groups were classified according to the United Nations geoscheme [29] . As no samples were returned from Romania, it was excluded from prevalence calculations; in Greece, no veterinarians could be recruited, and so it was excluded from all calculations. 2 Only results from cats with data in the online questionnaire were included. 3 Percentages and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated only for country groups and not for single countries to avoid calculations based on small sample numbers. n.a., not applicable.",

Briefly, the 25-\u00b5L RT-qPCR reaction contained 12.5 \u00b5L 2\u00d7 RT-qPCR Buffer, 1 \u00b5L 25\u00d7 RT-qPCR Enzyme Mix (AgPath-IDTM One-Step RT-qPCR Reagents, Thermo Fisher Scientific), a final concentration of 900 nM of forward primer (FeLV_U3_exo_f; 5'AAC AGC AGA AGT TTC AAG GCC 3'; 21 bp), 300 nM of reverse primer (FeLV_U3_exo_r; 5'TTA TAG CAG AAA GCG CGC G3'; 19 bp), and 200 nM of fluorogenic probe (exoFeLV-U3-probe; 5'-FAM-CCA GCA GTC TCC AGG CTC CCC A-TAMRA 3'; 22 bp). All oligonucleotides were synthetized by Microsynth AG (Balgach, Switzerland). The temperature profile was 10 min at 45 \u2022 C, followed by 10 min at 95 \u2022 C and 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 \u2022 C, followed by 45 s at 60 \u2022 C. Each PCR run was performed together with positive (RNA standard template) [37] and negative controls (PBS). The pooling scheme allowed the identification of the individual samples that could have contributed to the positive pool results. From all these single samples, TNA was extracted from 50 \u00b5L of original liquid sample material, and FeLV real-time RT-qPCR was performed as described above. The FeLV input copy numbers in the single samples were determined by co-amplifying 10-fold serial dilutions of an RNA standard template as described [37] . All further analyses were conducted with the FeLV RT-qPCR results of the individual samples/cats.",

First, a univariate analysis was conducted and odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were attributed to each variable. Next, a multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed using variables with p-values < 0.20. In some cases, the use of the Firth logit method allowed an inference of ORs and CIs when complete separation (zero cells) occurred [42] . Backward stepwise logistic regression was used to exclude progressively variables having the highest p-value [43] . In that final model, all pairwise interactions between variables, if biologically relevant, were examined for significance. The goodness of fit was assessed through a multivariate logistic regression using the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test [43] . Statistical analyses were carried out in STATA/SE 14.2 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA). The limit of statistical significance of the tests performed was defined as 0.05. Classification and regression tree (CART) analysis [44, 45] had been evaluated previously in medical science [46, 47] . Further details and explanations of this CART analysis are available in previous veterinary articles, including a prevalence study of feline retroviruses [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] . Classification trees are trained by passing data down from a root node to leaves. The data is repeatedly split according to predictor variables so that child nodes are more \"pure\" (i.e., homogeneous) in terms of the outcome variable (i.e., FeLV status). In this study, a classification tree analysis was based on the subdivision of the data set into randomly selected and approximately equal parts, with each \"part\" containing a similar distribution of data from the populations of interest (i.e., positive versus negative results for FeLV). Then, the analysis used the first nine parts of the data, constructing the largest possible tree, and used the remaining 1/10th of the data to obtain initial estimates of the error rate of the selected subtree. The process was repeated, using different combinations of the nine remaining data subsets and a different 1/10th data subset to test the resulting tree. This process was repeated until each 1/10th data subset had been used to test a tree that had been grown using 9/10ths of the data. Then, the results of the 10 mini-tests were combined to calculate the error rates for trees of each possible size; these error rates were applied to prune the tree that had been grown using the entire data set. In order to test the diagnostic power of the final decision tree generated, a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used for both the data set that was used to build the tree (learning data set) and the data set that was used to test the adequacy of the tree to the data (testing data set). This complex process resulted in a set of fairly reliable estimates of the independent predictive accuracy of the tree [53] . Classification tree analysis was carried out in a Salford Predictive Modeler (Salford Systems, San Diego, CA, USA).",

At least one individual sample tested FeLV RT-qPCR positive in each set of samples that had contributed to a positive pool. The countries/country groups with the highest prevalence of FeLV viremia were Portugal (8.8%; 95% CI: 6.2-12.3%), Hungary (5.9%; 95% CI: 3.5-9.9%), and Italy and Malta (5.7%; Figure 2 . Age distribution of the cats: grey: FeLV-negative cats (left axis), black: FeLV-positive cats (right axis). Cats aged from one to six years were significantly more frequently FeLV-positive than younger or older cats (p F < 0.0001; see also Table 3 ). 35 were Norwegian Forest cats, and 30 were Birman cats; from the remaining breeds, fewer than 30 cats had been included. The large majority of the cats were kept in private homes (n = 5151; 85.9%); much less frequently sampled were rescue cats and cats from breeders or animal shelters ( Table 2 ). The information concerning group housing or being a single cat was known for 5753 cats, of which 3373 cats lived in multicat environments (56.2%), and 2380 were kept as single cats (39.6%; Table 2 ). Approximately half of the cats in multicat environments (n = 1670; 49.5%) had only one companion cat. Most cats had outdoor access (n = 3633; 60.5%; Table 2 ); these cats could be further divided into cats that lived indoors and had outdoor access (n = 3245; 54.0%) and cats that always lived outdoors (n = 388 cats; 6.5%). Finally, approximately one-third of all cats lived strictly indoors (n = 2193; 36.5%). Information concerning FeLV vaccination status and the timepoint of the most recent FeLV vaccination was available for 5400 cats (Table 2 and Figure 1b ).",

The investigation was conducted prospectively and at a pan-European level; it is the first study of its kind. The study aimed to include 32 countries, of which 30 successfully contributed samples. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study provides the first FeLV prevalence data for some European countries, i.e., Latvia, Lithuania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Croatia, and current data for some countries without recent information on FeLV prevalence, i.e., France, Finland, Czech Republic, and the Netherlands. By using saliva swabs rather than an invasive method such as blood collection, samples could be collected from all cats visiting the veterinarians, thereby reducing the bias of selecting only cats that were easy to handle or that were presented because of illness and required blood collection for routine diagnostics. Saliva samples collected using buccal swabs were analysed for FeLV viral RNA using RT-qPCR. There is an almost perfect agreement between the shedding of FeLV viral RNA in saliva and the presence of viraemia, as reported previously [28, 35] ; therefore, the results obtained were comparable with those of other studies measuring free FeLV p27 antigen in blood samples. FeLV antigenemia is in most-but not all-cats a measure for FeLV viraemia [54] . Discrepancies can be found, particularly in the early stages of FeLV infection and in cats with a focal FeLV infection [55] [56] [57] . The saliva swabs had to be transported in an RNA shield buffer to ensure biological safety during shipment, since rabies is encountered in some of the countries included in the study [30, 31] . At the same time, the buffer increased the stability of the FeLV viral RNA.",

In a large prevalence study conducted in the United States and Canada in 2010, the overall prevalence was somewhat higher, at 3.1% (95% CI: 3.0-3.3%), when testing for free FeLV p27 antigen [13] . However, the two surveys are difficult to compare. In the latter investigation, the samples were preselected; they had been collected by veterinarians and by staff at animal shelters with the intention of testing the cats for FeLV. In contrast, in the current study, all cats visiting European veterinary facilities were tested. Notably, the prevalence reported in the present study still might not reflect the overall FeLV prevalence in all cats within the countries included, although a number of stray and rescue cats had been tested also in the present study. Many cats, in particular those at risk of FeLV infection, might never visit a veterinary facility and thus would evade testing.",

The investigations revealed that cats in Northern and Western Europe were at a lower risk of being FeLV-infected, while cats living in Southern European countries were at a much greater risk. In some Northern European countries, FeLV was even undetectable, i.e., Denmark, Finland, Sweden, and Norway. Remarkably, FeLV is a reportable disease in Sweden, and infections are registered by the Board of Agriculture (Jorbruksverket). FeLV is an unusual infection: in Sweden, six and seven cases were reported in 2015 and 2016, respectively [58] . In Denmark, FeLV prevalence was already low in 2010 in two out of three groups of stray cats and client-owned cats (0.8%; 0-0.9%), and a decrease of FeLV prevalence was reported in the third group; however, no detailed information was provided on FeLV tests or testing criteria [16] . In Finland, FeLV prevalence was also shown to be very low (1.0%) in 1990 in the Helsinki area in 196 stray cats [59] . Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania are also Northern European countries [29] . Of these Baltic countries FeLV-positive cats were found only in Lithuania, the southernmost of these three countries (four positives of 143 cats tested; 2.8%). In Estonia, there has been one report from 173 shelter cats tested in 2014/2015, in which three cats tested positive for FeLV p27 antigen (1.7%) [60] ; currently, there is one Estonian clinical case under investigation that tested positive for FeLV antigen; FeLV infection was confirmed by both virus isolation and provirus PCR (personal communication MJH and Olga Sjatkovskaja). The FeLV prevalence in the UK was low in the present study, with just one viraemic cat amongst 119 returned samples in England and no positives in Scotland and Wales (overall 0.7%); however, the return rate of samples was the lowest in the present study for the UK and Ireland compared to the other countries. An earlier study in the UK reported a high prevalence of FeLV in sick cats suspected of having FeLV or feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) infections (18%) as well as in young healthy cats (5%) [24] , but two more recent studies reported also a decreased FeLV prevalence in the UK: 3.5% of 517 stray cats in the Birmingham area (1.4% of the healthy cats; 6.9% of the sick cats) in 1997 were FeLV-infected, and 2.3% of the cats tested positive in two rehoming centres in the midlands and Eastern part of England in 2011/12 [61, 62] .",

In contrast, 39.0% of the cats in Denmark were vaccinated against FeLV, which exceeds the European average (27.1%; Figure 3 ). Considering the very low FeLV infection risk for cats in Denmark, any vaccination strategy against FeLV might have to be reconsidered, taking into account the relative risk-to-benefit ratio for any subcutaneous injection [63] . The vaccination rate was even higher in the United Kingdom, where 81.5% of the cats in the present study had been FeLV vaccinated, and only 0.7% of the cats were FeLV-positive. Thus, veterinarians in the United Kingdom should be advised to vaccinate more selectively against FeLV by identifying those cats that might currently, or in the future, be at risk of FeLV infection.",

In 1974, the prevalence of FeLV in the Netherlands was 9%, but it decreased to 3% by 1986 [11] . This success was attributed to the \"test and removal program\" that identified cats that carried FeLV and prevented their contact with uninfected cats [11] . In the present study, only 8.1% of the tested cats were vaccinated against FeLV in the Netherlands; this is in accordance with previous reports. Nonetheless, none of the cats in the Netherlands tested FeLV-positive. This highlights the importance of testing for maintaining an infection-free status, even in the absence of vaccination. A significant decrease in FeLV prevalence had also been reported in Switzerland: in 1990, 13.0% of sick cats were FeLV-positive [32] and a decrease to 3.1% in 2003 was demonstrated in a similar population of cats, using similar FeLV detection methods [15] . However, thereafter in Switzerland, the decrease in the FeLV prevalence stagnated; the most recent data from 2013-2016 reported a prevalence of 2.0% [15] , which is similar to the prevalence found for Switzerland and Liechtenstein in the current study (2.7%). It is not clear why the FeLV prevalence did not decrease further in recent years; the FeLV vaccination rate reported in the present study was good, with 67.6% in Switzerland and Liechtenstein. However, not all cats at risk of FeLV infection appear to have been identified and FeLV vaccinated in time. In the other Western European countries-Germany, France, Austria, Belgium, and Luxemburg-the prevalence of FeLV (0.3-1.3%) was below the overall European prevalence (2.3%) and lower than that reported some years ago, e.g., in urban stray cats in the Belgic city of Ghent (1998-2000: 3.8%) [65] , or in blood samples submitted for FeLV testing from owned cats in Austria (1996-2011: 5.6%) [22] , but similar to a more recent study in Belgian stray cats sampled by veterinarians through a trap-neuter program (2010-2012: 0.7%) [52] . In Germany, the current data extends the decreasing trend observed between 1993 and 2002 [14] .",

This is in accordance with a report from Portugal, where FeLV prevalence in stray cats in Lisbon was 5.7% in 2013/2014 [66] . For Italy, the most recent information about FeLV prevalence comes from a nationwide survey about Leishmania infantum infection, where 2659 leftover feline blood samples were tested also for retroviral DNA, and FeLV proviral DNA was recorded in 4.8% of cats, but unfortunately no regional or clinical data is available for these cats [67] . The present study demonstrated FeLV infections particularly in some Northern areas and in the Apulia region ( Figure 1A) . In previous reports, 3.8% and 6.1%, respectively, of stray cats in urban and rural colonies in northern Italy, Lombardy, tested FeLV antigen-positive (2008-2010 and 2014, respectively) [68, 69] . Prior to that, a national study carried out in 1863 cats of Northern and Central Italy examined in clinical settings found an average prevalence of 15.3% with 12% of prevalence in Lombardy, and the highest positivity percentages in the northern-eastern area of the country (Friuli-Venezia Giulia 28.7%; Trentino-Alto Adige 21%) and in Tuscany (23.2%). The lowest percentages of positivity were reported in Lazio (7.5%) and Liguria (7.3%) [70] . However, in this study, the cats were tested for diagnostic purposes and most were symptomatic and/or free roaming; therefore, the sampled population was not representative of the feline population in those areas. Nevertheless, a wide distribution and the clinical relevance of FeLV infection were shown at that time in Northern and Central Italy. Older studies from Southern Italy found 7% positivity in Campania [71] . Around the same time and in the following years, no FeLV-positive samples were found in Sicily in studies including stray or outdoor cats [72] [73] [74] [75] [76] [77] , or about 2% positivity was reported in the Sicily [78, 79] and Calabria regions [72] . Regional differences in the prevalence of FeLV infection have likely existed for some time within Italy.",

In some Southern European countries, cats are not expected to be owned; they are regarded as natural co-habitants in settlements, and are considered useful for their hunting activity. They are considered not a domestic but a synanthropic species. In some areas, these cats are left unneutered to breed naturally and with limited veterinary support, with serious consequences for the animals and often high mortality of kittens from infectious diseases [80] . In Italy, free-living outdoor cats (gatti liberi) have been protected by law (no-kill no-moving policy) since 1991 [81] . There are registered cat caretakers and compulsory neutering of the cats by the Veterinary Services of the Local Health Unit. This has led to stable cat numbers in Rome [81] , but in other Italian regions and other countries, there remain concerns regarding free-roaming cats in general as well as concerning infectious diseases [82] . The no-kill and no-moving restriction has many benefits for the cats, but might be a disadvantage in terms of FeLV infection. Healthy FeLV-positive shedders might stay unrecognized, and so pose an infection risk to uninfected cats. Moreover, if cats are identified as FeLV-infected, they cannot be removed from the cat population.",

The prevalence was higher in Hungary and Poland (5.9% and 5.0%, respectively). The FeLV-positive cats from Poland were found in the middle and southeastern parts of the country (Figure 1a) ; a previous study from this region in 2006-2010 had also demonstrated a high FeLV prevalence of 6.4% in clinically healthy cats and cats suspected to have an infectious disease [84] , and an even higher prevalence of 14.2% was reported in a study investigating 741 mainly sick cats in the area of Warsaw [85] . Remarkably, none of the 90 tested cats from Bulgaria were FeLV-positive. This could be related to the small number of samples tested or, alternatively, the cats taken to veterinarians in Bulgaria might be well cared for. The FeLV prevalence in the Czech Republic and Slovakia was similar to the overall prevalence in Europe (2.0% and 2.2%) as well as to that reported in a previous study of stray and owned cats in Slovakia [86] .",

Tomcats are still considered to be mainly at risk of FIV infection, and male sex has also been described as a risk factor for FeLV infection in other studies [10, 14, 87, 88] . FeLV can no longer be considered only as infection of \"social cats\", although FeLV is easily transmitted through social interactions via infectious saliva. However, it is, of course, also spread via the saliva and blood of viraemic cats through aggression, which is a common male behaviour. It is possible that as more cat owners become aware of the fact that FeLV can be transmitted socially and aim to prevent this route of infection (e.g., within a household), the more the transmission by cat fights in cats with outdoor access becomes evident and important. This is supported by the findings that cats exhibiting aggressive behaviour have a higher risk of FeLV infection [14] , and cats taken to veterinarians for fighting injuries were frequently FeLV-positive [89] . It is also consistent with the observation here that the outdoor access of the cat was a risk factor for FeLV infection. Cats living outdoors, or having outdoor access at least sometimes, had a significantly higher risk of testing FeLV-positive than cats living indoors. Therefore, it is recommended that all cats with outdoor access should be vaccinated against FeLV in areas/countries where FeLV occurs [90] .",

While it was shown previously that young cats are more at risk of developing progressive FeLV infection [24, 91] , the risk of being FeLV infected in the present study was approximately twice as high in cats aged one to six years compared to younger and older cats. Accordingly, the median age of FeLV viraemic cats was 3 years in a recent study from Germany and 4.75 years in a recent study conducted in the UK. Moreover, in a large study of North American cats tested for FeLV at veterinary facilities and animal shelters, it was observed that adult cats, defined as cats older than 6 months, were more likely to be FeLV viraemic (odds ratio 2.5) than juveniles up to 6 months of age [10] . Thus, FeLV infection should be expected in adult cats and not only in kittens, although the latter have a higher risk of developing progressive infection [91] .",

There has been high awareness amongst cat breeders of the risks of FeLV infection for many years, and most cat-breeding facilities are kept FeLV-free; cats are tested as kittens and after every possible exposure risk, and pedigree cats usually have no, or very limited, outdoor access. This further demonstrates that appropriate measures, such as testing, separation, risk assessment/reduction, and if necessary, FeLV vaccination, can significantly reduce FeLV infection within a cat population.",

From an epidemiological standpoint, it is generally advisable to keep cats in stable groups that are as small as possible. Moreover, sick cats were more frequently FeLV infected than healthy cats in Europe, which has been described also in other studies [17, 32] , and has been demonstrated under experimental conditions [5, 95] . In contrast to the information on whether a cat was sick or healthy, which was required in the online questionnaire, information on clinical signs was optional and provided voluntarily and not systematically by the attending veterinarians; this represents a limitation of the study. Clinical signs that were associated with FeLV infection in the cats reported in the present study were primarily anaemia, but also anorexia and gingivitis/stomatitis. Anaemia in FeLV-infected cats has been reported previously [96] [97] [98] . FeLV infection can be associated with different types of anaemia. Pure-red cell aplasia is associated with the rare development of FeLV C within a cat [99] , while haemolytic regenerative anaemia is related to opportunistic infections or immune-mediated destruction of red blood cells [98] . However, recent consensus statements suggest that there is only low evidence that FeLV per se induces immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia [100] . FeLV infection is known to lead to anorexia, loss of body weight, and poor body condition [61] . Moreover, in cats with gingivitis/stomatitis, FeLV infection should be considered as an important underlying cause [3] .",

The FeLV prevalence did not correlate with the GDP at PPP in the 30 European countries included in our study. In the present analysis, the data were obtained using the same FeLV detection and cat recruitment method in all countries; in contrast, only limited and/or older data were available from European countries for the recently published meta-analysis, and FeLV prevalence was determined using different methods and heterogeneous study populations [26] . However, the number of countries included in the present study and the range in GDP were somewhat smaller than in the previous study [26] , which might have limited the statistical analysis to a degree. Interestingly, we observed a correlation between the FeLV vaccination rate and the GDP at PPP in the investigated European countries. Vaccination rates were higher in areas with higher income and lower in countries/country groups with lower income. This observation can easily be explained since vaccines are more affordable in countries with a higher GDP. A variable vaccination rate might have an indirect effect on the FeLV prevalence. It was noted in the current study that higher FeLV vaccination rates tended to be associated with lower FeLV prevalence rates. However, since this was only a tendency, additional factors other than the FeLV vaccination rate (and the GDP) appear to have an impact on the FeLV prevalence, e.g., the availability of information and awareness concerning FeLV for veterinarians and cat owners.",

The first terminal node 2 corresponds to cats living in Northern and Western Europe (i.e., the area considered at lower risk of FeLV) but living always outdoors (considered a high-risk behaviour). In this terminal node 2, only eight FeLV-positive cats were present within a total of 3511 cats living in Northern or Western Europe. The second terminal node 1 corresponds to cats living in Southern (i.e., area with high prevalence of FeLV) and Eastern Europe (i.e., area with intermediate prevalence of FeLV) but with no pedigree (pedigree cats usually have no or limited outdoor access). Proportionally more FeLV-positive cats were present in this terminal node (i.e., 109 of a total of 2494 cats originating from the southern or eastern parts of Europe), which was expected according to the high to intermediate prevalence of FeLV in these countries in combination with the absence of pedigree cats.",

            "text": "The low prevalence of FeLV viraemia in Northern Europe and in most of the Western European countries indicates that strict testing and separation programs and vaccination can decrease or even eliminate FeLV infections. A very low FeLV prevalence was generally demonstrated in pedigree cats; cat breeders are aware of FeLV and prevent infection using strict preventive measures. In contrast, in some regions in this study, particularly in Southern Europe, high FeLV prevalence rates were identified, and extra measures will be necessary to control or eliminate FeLV infection from these geographic regions. The present study included countries with significant populations of stray cats and various policies for controlling (or not) these cat populations. While some rescue and shelter cats were included in the study, it can be assumed that the prevalence of FeLV in stray and feral cats that do not attend any veterinary facilities might even be higher in many countries since the living environment is suboptimal, and these cats do not receive any preventive or therapeutic medical care. Moreover, risk factors for FeLV infection, including outdoor access and intact male sex that are commonly associated with aggressive behaviour and fighting, were identified. Thus, in countries where FeLV remains prevalent, cats with outdoor access should be vaccinated and-also for the welfare of the cats-neutered. Awareness of FeLV infection and vaccination should be intensified, particularly in countries with high FeLV prevalence or in countries with lower prevalence but suspected geographic pockets of FeLV-positive cats, e.g., Switzerland and Ireland. In these countries, all cats at risk of FeLV infection should be tested for FeLV. Subsequently, the separation of infected cats and vaccination of uninfected animals is recommended by the Advisory Board on Cat Diseases Europe (ABCD Europe).
