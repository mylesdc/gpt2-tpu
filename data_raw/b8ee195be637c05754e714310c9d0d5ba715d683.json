Timely dissemination would be a key to effective surveillance. Unfortunately in Japan, however, although disease notification triggered the local response, data reported under several notification mechanisms had not been appropriately fedback to medical society and the public for many years. This leads to a decline in the motivation to report disease. In the meantime, circumstances of infectious diseases have been changing dramatically. 1 Consequently, the infectious disease surveillance in Japan was no longer functioning as a tool for infectious disease control. In 1999, the Communicable Disease Prevention Law was completely revised, and the concept of \"surveillance\" was legally set forth and encouraged. In this paper, after historical review of infectious disease surveillance in Japan, the current surveillance system and data based on it are described to provide overview of the infectious disease surveillance system in Japan. Through these observations, the potential impact of the new surveillance system is discussed.",

Category Vb disease, which includes sentinel reporting diseases, should be reported by designated sentinel medical institutions weekly or monthly with the number of clinical cases aggregated by sex and age groups. All reports should be compatible with the reporting criteria which were documented in detail for each disease including clinical and laboratory case definitions for categories I-Va and Vb of hospital sentinel reporting disease, and only clinical case definitions for other Vb sentinel reporting diseases. 4 Local public health centers are expected to enter data into the nationwide electronic surveillance system, which enables data to be shared throughout the system. All reports are analyzed, interpreted and published by various forms of tabulations and graphs with commentary text weekly or monthly at intermediate and national level infectious disease surveillance centers, as stipulated by law. However, since category Vb diseases are reported by designated sentinel medical institutions, not by all physicians, data are displayed by weekly reported number per sentinel so as to provide understanding of the epidemic situation and disease trend. In order to be consistently representative, sentinels are expected to be selected as randomly as possible, and the numbers of sentinels per public health center coverage area are determined in proportion to the population of the area. 5",

According to the new law, the national and prefectural/municipal infectious disease surveillance centers have been organized so that these institutions can play a central role in implementing surveillance and information dissemination.

In addition to these regular reports, papers in the academic field serve to facilitate the effective feedback of information. 12, 13 The new law classifies target diseases by their health impact, and it appears to improve the overall surveillance performance as the purpose of surveillance becomes clearer, especially for disease perceived to be milder.
