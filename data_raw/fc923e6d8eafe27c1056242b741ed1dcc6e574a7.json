Developing cogent NTD policy requires a clear agenda and set of priorities. Policymakers in local, regional, national, and international settings can set agendas and priorities independently, or they can collaborate with multiple stakeholders to determine the best way to develop effective NTD policy. Lack of coordination may mean that no priorities are adequately resourced or some areas are overemphasized for non-scientifically valid political reasons. NTD scientists and physicians should acknowledge the need for priorities and participate in policy development alongside public health experts and community representatives to increase the likelihood that NTD policies will be effective, efficient, and sustainable. In this article, we highlight value judgments relevant at the agenda-setting stage of the NTD policy process and describe why NTD researchers and physicians ought to participate in this process. Table 1 summarizes the key considerations that must inform NTD agenda setting.",

Many questions need to be addressed as part of agenda setting and policy planning. At a broad level, we must ask: How does NTD policy development, as well as the overall goal of promoting well-being, fit within the broader social agenda setting including issues of democracy, human rights, security from violence, and economic progression? Which NTDs should be prioritized, and in what order? What factors, such as economic, geopolitical, and health impact, should be considered in setting priorities? How should efforts balance concern with short-term and long-term consequences? Should the focus be limited to emerging endemic or epidemic diseases? How much attention should be paid to monitoring diseases to detect mutations that might render current NTDs more serious in the future? Are there any cultural restrictions on the types of interventions that may be pursued to prevent or treat NTDs? Should efforts be focused on prevention, treatment, surveillance, or prediction of diseases? How should these questions be answered, and by whom?",

For instance, should United States efforts be more concerned about NTDs that are already present in the country or ones likely to affect US populations? Recently, US policy makers increased funding for research on Zika once it was seen as epidemic in the Americas and especially after it was detected within the US. Alternatively, should the US focus efforts to achieve important political or economic goals? This would mean focusing on places where they have strategic interests that can be advanced through health diplomacy, such as helping Gulf States create a vaccine for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). Instead, if the primary reason for combating NTDs is concern with inequity, then priority should be given to the places and people who are the worst off, such as regions in sub-Saharan Africa. These efforts could include disseminating existing treatments for NTDs in the region. Other ways of setting priorities include focusing on places where the greatest impact can be made quickly-perhaps working with populations in the US or other high-income countries where existing infrastructure might facilitate treatment and prevention efforts. Competing views about how to choose among worthy goals lead to different policy agendas. But if choices are not made and priorities are not set, then circumstances and politics will dictate the agenda.",

Government officials in Haiti rejected this plan because the small available supply of vaccine would not be nearly enough to vaccinate everyone who could benefit from vaccination. They worried unequal access might trigger social unrest [5] . Many public health experts believe that even limited vaccination could have reduced the number of cholera cases by over 10% [5] . This example highlights the way underlying values and priorities lead to different views about what ought to be done [5, 6] .",

Efforts should be made also to engage affected communities through collaborative partnerships with researchers, funders, local partners, and policy makers [8] . The extent to which different stakeholders are represented reflects views about whose perspectives are valuable and can influence the agenda. If some views are \"overrepresented\" by advocates while others receive little attention, will the imbalance be addressed and, if so, how? Furthermore, to be effective, NTD policy requires collaboration, coordination, and oversight among local, state, and the national government. This is even more complicated for international policy consensus, as different national interests must be aligned. This can be achieved by building on existing structures, such as the WHO. These collaborations are complicated and can be rife with conflict. Nevertheless, coordinating goals and efforts is vital to adopting effective, efficient, and sustainable plans toward eliminating NTDs.
