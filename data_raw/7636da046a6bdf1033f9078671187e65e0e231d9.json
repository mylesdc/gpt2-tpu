Methods: Observational cross-sectional study. Using a non-contact infrared thermometer, 3 consecutive measurements of body surface temperature were collected from 39 patients with central venous catheter on the following sites: nearby the catheter insertion area or totally implantable catheter reservoir, the equivalent contralateral region (without catheter), and forehead of the same subject. results: A total of 323 observations were collected. Respectively, both in male and female patients, disregarding the occurrence of infection, the mean temperature on the catheter area minus that on the contralateral region (mean \u00b1 standard deviation: -0.3\u00b10.6\u00b0C versus -0.2\u00b10.5\u00baC; p=0.36), and the mean temperature on the catheter area minus that on the forehead (mean \u00b1 standard deviation: -0.2\u00b10.5\u00b0C versus -0.1\u00b10.5\u00baC; p=0.3) resulted in negative values. Moreover, in infected patients, higher values were obtained on the catheter area (95%CI: 36.6-37.5\u00baC versus 36.3-36.5\u00baC; p<0.01) and by temperature subtractions: catheter area minus contralateral region (95%CI: -0.17 -+0.33\u00baC versus -0.33 --0.20\u00baC; p=0.02) and catheter area minus forehead (95%CI: -0.02 -+0.55\u00baC versus -0.22 --0.10\u00baC; p<0.01). conclusion: Using a non-contact infrared thermometer, patients with catheter-related bloodstream infections had higher temperature values both around catheter insertion area and in the subtraction of the temperatures on the contralateral and forehead regions from those on the catheter area.",

(1) These vascular accesses can be classified as short and long-term use. Short-term CVC are usually non-tunneled polyurethane catheters with single or multiple lumens and should be inserted only in hospitalized patients to use for days or weeks. (2) Examples of long-term CVC (>3 months) are the cuffed tunneled catheters (i.e., HICKMAN \u00ae or BROVIAC \u00ae ) and the totally implantable Port. The last one is preferred for patients who require intermittent vascular access. (3) Near 5 million CVC are inserted per year, in the United States, with a documented rate of related infections ranging between 3 to 26% per year. (4) (5) (6) (7) Considering only intensive care units, 80 thousand of catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI) occurred in a year. (8) The costs related to each case of CRBSI could reach US$56,000, (9) with an average increase in hospital stay of 6.5 days for critically ill patients. (10) In addition, CRBSI have been associated with up to 25% mortality, (8, 10) catheter replacement and interruption of intravenous therapy. (11, 12) Researchers had described a low sensibility to detection of local inflammation around CVC insertion area based on clinical findings (pain, erythema, swelling and purulence). (13) They also reported that vascular device colonization could happen even in the absence of infectious symptoms or signs. (14, 15) On the other hand, the body surface temperature, evaluated with a noncontact infrared thermometer (NCIT), could be altered nearby infectious processes. (16) Because of that, seems to be reasonable to hypothesize that the NCIT could be helpful to the earlier diagnosis of CRBSI.",

(21) (22) (23) Its principle is that heat emitted by the body can be detected in the infrared radiation spectrum through a remote sensor. (24) As far as it is known, this is the first study about infrared thermometry and catheter related infections. During data collection, six cases of CRBSI were confirmed in four patients, mainly in those with short bowel syndrome who received TPN and other medications or fluids through a totally implantable CVC. Two of the 15 observations related to positive blood cultures generated pronounced negative results (outliers) from the subtraction of temperatures of contralateral region from those of CVC area (-1.3\u00b0C and -1.4\u00b0C). When the two measurements were taken, nothing was being infused through the catheter, and the patient was receiving a lock therapy with 70% ethanol through it. (25) However, there is no guarantee of its relation with the results obtained. After exclusion of these two measurements, differences were observed between the subtractions of temperatures from CVC area minus those of contralateral region and forehead, comparing the data related and not with CRBS. The difference observed only around the CVC insertion area of infected patients indicates that, when CRBSI occurs, the body surface temperature, measured with a NCIT, around the CVC insertion area or its reservoir, becomes higher.",

The small number of observations related to blood cultures could be the explanation. (26) Recently, studies have highlighted diagnostic and prognostic uses of temperature measurements for infectious diseases. Abnormal patterns of body temperature, evaluated by common thermometers, were disclosed as predictive of sepsis. (27) Also, skin surface temperature measurements by a NCIT seem to be a promising indicator of severity or improvement of skin and soft tissue infection. (16) In general, even not considering the occurrence of infection, negative results were observed when the temperatures of contralateral and forehead regions were subtracted from those obtained on the catheter/ reservoir area. A lower temperature at the catheter area could be explained by the almost continuous infusion of fluids (i.e., parenteral nutrition and saline solution), which usually are kept bellow body temperature. An infusion of 2L of crystalloid in room temperature decreases body heat by one-third, in Celsius degrees. (28) However, this assumption should be tested in future studies.",

Thus, close to 41% of the observations were related to only 3 patients, while another 18 subjects contributed with less than 1% of all. In addition, changes in body heat caused by the temperature of the fluid infused at the moment of data collection were not investigated. Finally, this study did not evaluate severity of disease, environment temperature and hemodynamic stability influences on the results, as well if body surface temperature around specific areas is different for each type of vascular device.",
