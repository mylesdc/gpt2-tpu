Blood meal samples were collected from captured and morphologically identified hairy-legged vampire bats. One hairy-legged vampire bat OTU was identified by each of the markers. The 16s OTU only had a 96% match to Diphylla ecaudata in ncbi genbank, while the COI hairy-legged vampire bat OTU had matches to Diphylla ecaudata spanning from 92.88-99.35% indicating mitochondrial intraspecific diversity in the hairy-legged vampire bat. As only bird prey was detected, only the metazoan COI primer set could be used to identify prey. With the COI primer set, four vertebrate prey OTUs were identified of which three were found in one sample and two samples contained the same OTU (Table S2 ). The BOLD database (boldsystems.org) was used to identify the OTUs. Criteria for taxonomic assignments were as follows: i) Prey species assignment: 100% match to only one species. ii) Prey genus assignment: 100% matches to more than one species within the same genus. As the remaining OTUs had poor reference database coverage, comparisons were made against all barcode records in BOLD. iii) Prey family assignment: identity from 96.12 to 88.03 within the same family. In the sample where Tinamous sp. (Tinamoformes) were identified (Table S2) , an OTU with amount of sequences and low identity matches to the order Tinamiformes were also found. Therefore, this OTU was assumed to be an artefact. Nematode taxa assignment followed that of the common vampire bat. Hairy-legged vampire bat has been reported to rely solely on birds as prey (Greenhall et al. 1984 ) (although potential predation on humans have been reported (Ito et al. 2016) ). In agreement with this, we only detected birds in blood meal samples from three individual hairylegged vampire bats. Two of the bats had preyed on chicken (Gallus sp.), while the third bat had preyed on two wild birds, spix's guan (Penelope jacquacu) and tinamous (Tinamus sp.) (Table  S2) . To our knowledge, no other study has identified other birds than chicken in any vampire bat species' blood meal or faeces. The spix's guan is a large, fairly common arboreal bird weighing up to ca 1.4 kg and known to occur in rainforest in the area where the samples were collected (IUCN 2016; Del Hoyo et al. 2017) . Species in the tinamous genus are larger bird species weighing up to ca. 1.9 kg, they roost in trees, and the genus is known to occur in the area where the hairy-legged were caught (Khanna 2005; Del Hoyo et al. 2017) . Although based on just one sample from one individual, this gives the first evidence that the hairy-legged vampire bats can prey on spix's guan and tinamous and that these wild birds might offer them a reliable and accessible food source in the MDD134 site.
