The diagnosis was achieved by using a multiplex real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay and highlights the usefulness of these novel molecular diagnostic techniques in patients hospitalized with acute respiratory illness. We also performed a literature search for previously published cases and present a summary of the clinical, laboratory and radiological features of this condition. Case presentation: A 44-year-old immunocompetent Caucasian woman was admitted to our hospital with an acute febrile respiratory illness associated with a rash. Her blood tests were non-specifically abnormal, and tests for bacterial pathogens were negative. Her condition rapidly deteriorated while she was in our hospital and required mechanical ventilation and inotropic support. A multiplex real-time RT-PCR assay performed on respiratory specimens to detect respiratory viruses was negative for influenza but positive for adenovirus DNA. The patient recovered on supportive treatment, and antibiotics were stopped after 5 days. Conclusions: Community-acquired adenovirus pneumonia in immunocompetent adult civilians presents as a nonspecific acute febrile respiratory illness followed by the abrupt onset of respiratory failure, often requiring mechanical ventilation. Its laboratory and radiological features are typical of viral infections but also are nonspecific. Novel multiplex real-time RT-PCR testing for respiratory viruses enabled us to rapidly make the diagnosis in this case. The new technology could be used more widely in patients with acute respiratory illness and has potential utility for rationalization of the use of antibiotics and improving infection control measures.",

            "text": "Adenoviruses are double-stranded DNA viruses belonging to the family Adenoviridae. There are over 50 known serotypes of adenovirus, which are categorized into six subgenera (A to F). Adenoviruses are a common cause of acute febrile and respiratory infections in children and are generally self-limiting [1] . Severe infections, including pneumonia, can occur in neonates [2] and in adults with compromised immunity, such as those with hematopoietic stem cell transplants and in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection [3] . Outbreaks of acute respiratory illness, including pneumonia, caused by adenovirus serotypes 3, 4, 7, 14 and 21 are common among military recruits, and fatal outcomes have occasionally been reported [4] [5] [6] . Outbreaks of adenovirus infection in long-term nursing facilities and in hospital wards with associated cases of fatal pneumonia have also been described [7] . In contrast, community-acquired adenovirus pneumonia in immunocompetent adult civilians has rarely been described. We report the case of a previously healthy and immunocompetent woman with severe adenovirus pneumonia who developed rapidly progressive respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation and who made a successful recovery after being treated with supportive measures. We also summarize the demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiological features of community-acquired adenovirus pneumonia cases in immunocompetent adult civilians that have previously been reported in the literature.",

Common examination findings on presentation included abnormalities in chest auscultation (90%), pyrexia (89%) and hypoxia (66%). The presence of pharyngitis, conjunctivitis or rash was noted infrequently (19%, 19% and 5% respectively). The median white cell count on admission to the hospital was 7.7 \u00d7 10 9 (range, 3.9 \u00d7 10 9 to 28 \u00d7 10 9 ), although neutrophilia was relatively common (33%). Lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia were noted in 52% and 19% of patients, respectively. Other frequently noted laboratory abnormalities were mildly elevated transaminases and elevated levels of CPK.",

            "text": "The 21 cases we identified in the literature demonstrate that patients with adenovirus pneumonia usually present with several days' history of a non-specific febrile respiratory illness. These patients frequently have respiratory compromise with hypoxia at the time of presentation, while the classical features of adenoviral infection, such as pharyngitis, conjunctivitis, rash or diarrhea, are usually absent. The clinical condition of most patients deteriorates rapidly during admission and requires intubation and ventilation, a pattern commonly seen with primary influenza pneumonia [27] . Laboratory findings are also typical of viral infection, with a normal total white cell count, relative lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia and elevated transaminases and CPK being frequently observed. The most commonly seen radiological pattern on admission is widespread bilateral interstitial shadowing, which is consistent with the results reported in a case series describing the radiological appearance of adult patients with confirmed adenoviral pneumonia [28] . It is noteworthy that several patients, including our own case, had normal initial chest radiography results. Lobar consolidation, a pattern considered more suggestive of bacterial infection, was observed in around onefourth of patients with adenoviral pneumonia. All of these radiological patterns (including normal initial chest radiographs) have been described in patients with primary influenza pneumonia [29] [30] [31] . Although the overall mortality rate in this series [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] was 24%, only two patients who were reported on after 1979 have died, possibly representing improvement in supportive care over this time period. Our present case report of an immunocompetent adult civilian patient with sporadic adenoviral pneumonia is the first case to be reported in the literature in which molecular diagnostic methods were used. Nucleic acid detection has the advantages of increased sensitivity and rapid availability of results compared to the conventional diagnostic techniques of viral culture and antigen detection [32] . In addition, multiplex real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) assays are increasingly being used by diagnostic laboratories to detect a wide range of respiratory viruses in a single reaction. While it is well-recognized that influenza virus and adenovirus can cause pneumonia, there is increasing evidence that other respiratory viruses, such as RSV, human metapneumovirus, PIV, human rhinovirus and human coronavirus play an important role in the etiology of community-acquired pneumonia in adults [33] . The increasingly widespread use of multiplex real-time RT-PCR for the detection of respiratory viruses in clinical practice will allow us to accurately determine the burden of respiratory viral infection in patients with community-acquired pneumonia and may demonstrate that adenoviral pneumonia in immunocompetent adults is more common than previously thought.",
