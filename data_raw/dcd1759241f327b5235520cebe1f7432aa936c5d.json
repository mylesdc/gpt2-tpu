(B) Variants of pDluc PRRSV/wt were prepared with an in-frame stop codon (UAG) placed within the slippery sequence at the position that would likely be decoded in the peptidyl-(P) or aminoacyl-(A) site of the ribosome during encounter of the nsp1\u03b2/PCBP complex. Transcribed mRNAs were translated in RRL in the presence of nsp1\u03b2 alongside wild-type controls (wt). To align the stop codon with the outgoing -2 frame, a 3' base was deleted in each case (space underlined). In the configurations tested, no programmed readthrough event was detected. were transfected with siRNA pools targeting PCBP1, PCBP2, PCBP3, PCBP4 or hnRNP K/J. Knockdown of proteins targeted by siRNAs was assessed by Western blotting (note: a suitable antibody for PCBP3 was not available). Knockdown of PCBP3, PCBP4 and hnRNPK resulted in an increase in PCBP1 expression, which might be a compensatory mechanism. In RK-13 cells, knockdown of PCBP2 also induced knockdown of PCBP1, possibly through an siRNA off-target effect (one of the siRNA sequences had only a single nt mismatch with rabbit PCBP1 mRNA and two mismatches with African green monkey PCBP1 mRNA). expression system to generate both the polyprotein fragment nsp1\u03b2-2 (which self-cleaves to provide proteins nsp1\u03b2 and nsp2) and the encoding mRNA containing the PRRSV -2/-1 PRF signal. After metabolic labeling, expression products were immunoprecipitated with mAb \u03b1-EU-nsp2 that recognises the common N-terminal domain of nsp2, nsp2TF, and nsp2N. Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by 6% SDS-PAGE and visualised by autoradiography to assess frameshifting efficiencies. Knockdown of PCBP3 in MARC-145 cells resulted in accelerated cell death during infection with recombinant vaccinia virus vT7-3, resulting in lower band intensities for the three nsp2 products upon immunoprecipitation compared to the other conditions. (C & F) PRF efficiencies (%, y-axis) measured for each knockdown condition. Protein bands were quantified (triplicates) using ImageQuant TL software for MARC-145 cells (C) and RK-13 cells (F). The total intensity of all protein bands (nsp2, nsp2', nsp2TF, nsp2TF', nsp2N and nsp2N') was set as 100%. Frameshift efficiencies were calculated after normalisation for the methionine and cysteine content of each protein product. The products nsp2', nsp2TF' and nsp2N' are precursors. Note the baseline % FS differs in MARC-145 and RK-13 cells. Error bars represent SEM values (from triplicates).",

Proteins were visualised by Western blot analysis as described previously(Treffers et al. 2015)  using primary antibodies mAb-nsp2Eu58-46, mAb-nsp1\u03b2 Eu22-28 (Li et al., 2014), rabbit polyclonal anti-hnRNP E1 (C-terminal) (PCBP1) (Sigma-Aldrich), mouse monoclonal anti-PCBP2 (M07) (Abgent), rabbit polyclonal anti-human MGC10 (PCBP4) (PromoKine), mouse monoclonal anti-hnRNPK (Abcam), or mouse monoclonal antibody H68.4 against the transferrin receptor (Invitrogen) diluted in PBST containing 1% casein. Biotin-conjugated swine anti-rabbit (DAKO) or goat anti-mouse (DAKO), and Cy3-conjugated mouse anti-biotin (Jackson, Pennsylvania, USA) diluted in PBST containing 0.5% casein, were used for fluorescent detection with a Typhoon-9410 imager (GE Healthcare, UK). Lysates from [ 35 S]Met/Cys-labelled cells were used to immunoprecipitate nsp2, nsp2TF and nsp2N using mAb-nsp2Eu58-46 (Li et al. 2012) which recognizes the common N-terminal domain of the three products. Proteins were separated on a 6% SDS-PAGE gel and imaged as described previously(Li et al. 2014, as above)  .
