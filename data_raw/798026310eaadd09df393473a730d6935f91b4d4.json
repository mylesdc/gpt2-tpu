            "text": "Phenomenon of unequal use of synonymous codons in Mycobacterium tuberculosis is common. Codon usage bias not only plays an important regulatory role at the level of gene expression, but also helps in improving the accuracy and efficiency of translation. Meanwhile, codon usage pattern of Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome is important for interpreting evolutionary characteristics in species. In order to investigate the codon usage pattern of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome, 12 Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomes from different area are downloaded from the GeneBank. The correlations between G 3 , GC 12 , whole GC content, codon adaptation index, codon bias index, and so on of Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomes are calculated. The ENC-plot, relationship between A 3 /(A 3 + T 3 ) and G 3 /(G 3 + C 3 ), GC 12 versus GC 3 plot, and the RSCU of overall/separated genomes all show that the codon usage bias exists in all 12 Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomes. Lastly, relationship between CBI and the equalization of ENC shows a strong negative correlation between them. The relationship between protein length and GC content (GC 3 and GC 12 ) shows that more obvious differences in the GC content may be in shorter protein. These results show that codon usage bias existing in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomes could be used for further study on their evolutionary phenomenon.",

According to the WHO, in Oct, 2017, fact sheet pointed out that the TB is one of the top 10 causes of death worldwide [1] . It spreads from person to person through the air. One person may be infected by TB when only inhaling a few of TB germs. So, many scientists studied the characteristics including codon usage pattern [2] , promoter architecture of toxin-antitoxin systems [3] , drug-resistance [4] , molecular epidemiology [5] , protein function and immunogenicity [6] , and drugs for the treatment [7] of TB. Typically, Sheen et al. studied the multiple genomes of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and found out some specific novel genes and mutations associated with pyrazinamide resistance [8] . Sun et al. and Khrustalev et al. characterize the mutations in streptomycinresistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis [9, 10] . Recently, bioinformatics tools are widely used for analyzing the TB [11] .",

Many factors may affect the codon usage in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, such as mutation pressure [12] , gene length [13] , and natural selection [14] . Most previous studies deal with the relatively smaller set of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates [15, 16] or the isolates from one area [17, 18] . In this paper, genetic diversity of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from 12 areas is compared and analyzed. So, the objectives of this study aim to deal with the following issues: (1) correlation between codon preference parameters such as the codon usage index (CBI), the effective number of codons (ENC), the overall GC content, the codon adaptation index (CAI), and the Frequency of Optimal Codons (FOP); (2) mutation and evolution characteristics via the relationship between ENC and the GC 3 of the whole 12 Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomes; (3) phylogenetic analysis via RSCU values of the separated genomes for Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

The result shows that the distribution of most GC 12 rate is between 0.5 and 0.65 and most of the GC 3 rate is during 70%-90%. In addition, GC 3 is more than GC 12 in most of the genes. Meanwhile, the correlation analysis in Table 2 shows that there is a weak correlation with the value of \u22120.015. Form these data performance, it can be seen that the natural selection may be a greater impact factor on codon preference in Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomes. RSCU value, which is an important parameter for evaluating the bias of the synonymous codon, represents the ratio between the occurrence frequency of one codon and the expected usage frequency in a gene sample. Codons whose RSCU values are more than 1.0 would be regarded as having positive codon usage bias. On the contrary, those RSCU values less than 1.0 are defined as the less-abundant codons. (Figure 4) , to a certain degree, can reflect the characteristics of codon usage, but when it comes to the codon usage of individual sequence for a particular genome, it can be seen that there is a great difference of RSCU values from different genes even of one genome.

Although many scientists endeavor to study the Mycobacterium tuberculosis from the genetic perspective [32, 33] for its very important for defending tuberculosis [34] , its codon usage bias is not very clear until now. In this study, not only are traditional methods, such as ENC-plot, PR2 analysis, RSCU values, and phylogenetic analysis of 12 Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomes, studied, but also some new methods, CBI versus ENC and protein length versus GC 3S /GC 12 , are all explored; the former relationship describing the relationship between CBI and ENC could reveal their negative correlation characteristics. Relationship between protein length and GC content (GC 3S and GC 12 ) can reflect the changes of GC content within different coding sequences during the evolutionary process. Previous studies indicated that genetic diversity exists in Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolated from different tuberculosis [35] when the samples are from different areas. Many studies also revealed that the host is an important factor that can affect the codon usage characteristics [36] . Overall RSCU values of overall 12 Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomes ( Figure 4 ) and their separated genomes ( Figure 5 ) all reveal strong codon usage bias. All these results combined with the relationship between CBI and ENC, protein length, and GC content (GC 3 and GC 12 ) show that the natural selection pressure is a little more important than mutation pressure. There are only 12 genomes of Mycobacterium tuberculosis analyzed in this work; although Mycobacterium tuberculosis exists in almost all countries. We selected 12 geographically representative genomes in order to analyze their regional differences. Codon usage differences of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from broader range and even from one area are not mentioned in this work; it is necessary to expand the scope of the genomes in the further study.",

The codon usage pattern and its influencing factors, especially, were identified for 12 Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomes. It is observed that codon usage patterns in Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomes are influenced by GC3 bias. Correlation between codon bias index and GC3 (=0.618) shows that the GC3 bias of Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomes may also reflect its codon bias index.",

We performed the comparative analysis of codon usage bias in Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomes from different area. The results would help further elucidate the underlying dynamics of genetic evolution in Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomes. These results showed that codon usage bias exists in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomes. All this information is important for explaining the function of Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomes and helps in understanding the evolutionary process of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis.",

The overall RSCU values of 12 Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomes are calculated and the results are shown in Figure 4. The codon usage bias shows that the red bars in those RSCU values are more than 1.5, which could be regarded as the abundant codons; these codons are UUC, CUG, AUC, GUC, GUG, UCG, CCG, ACC, AAC, UGC, UGA, CGC, CGG, AGC, and GGC. Among them, CUG has the highest RSCU value of 3.12. The blue bars in Figure 4 are showing the opposite (RSCU values are less than 0.5) characteristics which could be called the lessabundant codons. Generally, RSCU values for the codons ending with the A or T are smaller than the RSCU value of the codons ending with G or C. There are three stop codons (UGA, UAA, and UAG), and no corresponding amino acid corresponding to stop codons. In Figure 4, RSCU values for terminal codons are UGA = 1.645, UAA = 0.45, and UAG = 0.905, and sum of them is 3 (there are 3 stop codons). On the other hand, the RSCU value 1.645 for UGA here denotes that 54.8% (1.645/3) of stop codons are UGA, which is more than the sum of UAA and UAG.The value of RSCU is usually used as a measurement of the codon usage bias.
