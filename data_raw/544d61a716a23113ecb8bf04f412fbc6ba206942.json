In this study, we illustrated the efficacy of nanoparticle-entrapped UV-killed virus vaccine against an economically important respiratory viral disease of pigs called porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). We entrapped PLGA [poly (lactideco-glycolides)] nanoparticles with killed PRRSV antigens (Nano-KAg) and detected its phagocytosis by pig alveolar macrophages. Single doses of Nano-KAg vaccine administered intranasally to pigs upregulated innate and PRRSV specific adaptive responses. In a virulent heterologous PRRSV challenge study, Nano-KAg vaccine significantly reduced the lung pathology and viremia, and the viral load in the lungs. Immunologically, enhanced innate and adaptive immune cell population and associated cytokines with decreased secretion of immunosuppressive mediators were observed at both mucosal sites and blood. In summary, we demonstrated the benefits of intranasal delivery of nanoparticle-based viral vaccine in eliciting cross-protective immune response in pigs, a potential large animal model.",

            "text": "Microencapsulation of vaccine agents and drugs in biodegradable polymer and its delivery in humans is an innovative approach to create more robust medications and vaccines in the 21 st century. The biocompatible and biodegradable polymer, PLGA [poly (lactide-co-glycolides)], is the US FDA approved material in the development of nanoparticle-based controlled release delivery system [1] . PLGA slowly degrades and releases the vaccine over a long-period of time, thus avoiding the need of a booster dose [2] . Being particulate in nature, the nanoparticle-mediated delivery promotes uptake of Ags by professional antigen presenting cells (APCs). Nanoparticle as a delivery vehicle to vaccines and drugs has been extensively evaluated in mouse models. However, there are limitations in the translation of novel rodent findings to improve human and food animal health [3] . Therefore, pig may serve as a useful large animal model for such research. Moreover, due to their physiological, anatomical, and immunological similarity to humans, pigs are already in use as an animal model system to study a few viral diseases [4] . Although, the current study is focused on a respiratory pathogen which infects pigs, and the vaccine evaluation strategy may help to consider pig as a model system.",

This translates into $1.8 million losses per day annually. PRRSV infects pigs of all ages and is caused by a highly mutating, positive sense, single stranded RNA virus belongs to the family Arteriviridae [6] . PRRS in growing pigs causes anorexia, fever, respiratory distress, and enhanced susceptibility to secondary microbial infections; while in pregnant sows it is characterized by reproductive dysfunction and abortions [7] . Primary PRRSV permissive cells are alveolar macrophages (Mws) [8] . PRRSV rapidly modulates the host innate immune response, such as dampens the NK cell cytotoxicity and reduces the IFN-a production, and upregulates immunosuppressive mediators from as early as two days postinfection [9] ; which lead to poor adaptive immune response and delayed/weak virus neutralizing antibody response, resulting in PRRSV persistence. Nevertheless, due to high degree of constant genetic and antigenic variations, control of PRRS remains a challenge to the swine industry worldwide.",

Like the field virus, PRRS-MLV also induces immunosuppression [17, 18] . Moreover, there are reports of reversion of vaccine virus into virulence leading to severe disease outbreaks [19, 20] . Although available killed PRRSV vaccines are safe, they are poorly immunogenic [21] . Thus, to control PRRS outbreaks innovative vaccine strategies are required.

Nanoparticles protect the entrapped proteins from protease-mediated degradation at mucosal surfaces, and also aid in slow sustained release of the vaccine [36] . PLGA nanoparticle induces activation and maturation of human DCs by upregulating the expression of costimulatory and MHC class II molecules, secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, and enhances the APCs allostimulatory property [37, 38] . Consistent with the inherent adjuvant property of PLGA, pig APCs treated with PLGA nanoparticle vaccine (Nano-KAg) had increased expression of a costimulatory molecule, CD80/86. In our study, we did not include a pig group with empty PGLA nanoparticles, as our primary goal was to augment the killed PRRSV vaccine induced anti-PRRSV cross-protective immunity with the help of PLGA, a well-known adjuvant and a delivery system to vaccines. Thus, at present we do not have the information on how much of post-vaccination T cell immunity detected in Nano-KAg vaccinated pigs was due to the adjuvant effect of the PGLA nanoparticles alone, which will be considered during our future investigations. However, a rapid uptake of Nano-KAg by lung APCs followed by translocation of viral Ags into endosomal compartment was observed. Suggesting that virus specific adaptive immune response could be elicited in the respiratory tract of pigs using PLGA nanoparticle-based killed PRRSV vaccine. Differential cell counts from BAL fluid harvested from healthy mice, humans, and pigs have indicated that greater than 90% of cells are alveolar Mws [39, 40] , suggesting that intranasally delivered Nano-KAg were phagocytosed by Mws.",

In our pre-challenge study, Nano-KAg vaccine significantly increased the frequency of CD8 + T cells, Th/ memory cells, with concomitant increase in the secretion of innate (IFN-a), proinflammatory (IL-6), and Th1 (IFN-c) cytokines. Immune potentiating ability of Chitosan nanoparticles is mediated by the action of innate immune cells, in addition to enhanced production of IL-6 and IFN-c [43] . Phagocytosis of polystyrene latex microspheres by Mws activate the signal transduction events in innate immune cells [44] . Once activated, the APCs present the antigen through MHC class I and II molecules to CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, respectively. In our post-challenge study using a virulent heterologous PRRSV, Nano-KAg induced superior innate immune response was observed. Studies have shown immune potentiating activity of nanoparticles in mice, pigs, and macaques; but the immune correlates were not evaluated in vaccinated virus challenged animals [45] . Immunologically, PRRSV modulates innate immune function of pigs by dampening the IFN-a production and NK cell frequency as well as its cytotoxicity, leading to weak/ delayed adaptive immune response [17, 34] . The NK cytotoxic function in Nano-KAg received pigs was partially rescued (not significant), suggesting the beginning of appearance of NK cell cytotoxic function with a complete rescue in their frequency (comparable to mock pigs). In pigs vaccinated with Nano-KAg, virus induced immunosuppressive responses were dampened along with a significant boost in both innate and virus specific adaptive immune response.",

In contrast, in Nano-KAg immunized pig lungs, TBLN, and blood significantly reduced Tregs frequency, associated with decreased IL-10 and TGF-b, and increased IFN-c secretion, compared to unvaccinated and K-Ag vaccinated virus challenged pigs was observed. In a pre-challenge study, at two-week post-vaccination increased secretion of proinflammatory cytokine, IL-6, in Nano-KAg vaccinated pigs appears to be involved in initiation of adaptive immune response. Diminished production of IL-6 in post-challenged pigs at six-week post-vaccination was associated with reduced inflammatory lung pathology.",

            "text": "Mucosal immunization elicits production of IgA antibodies and effector response at distant tissues [49] . The IgA antibody is protective against various viral infections and they possess significant virus neutralization activity at both mucosal surfaces and blood [50] . In Nano-KAg immunized pigs increased levels of PRRSV specific IgA, IgG in the lungs, blood, and nasal wash were observed. Although, these PRRSV specific antibodies did not significantly increase the neutralizing titers in the lungs, there was complete clearance of viremia at PC 15, which was associated with various other adaptive immune correlates. Whereas in the lungs, the reduced viral titer was not significant, but a significant reduction of PRRSV antigen by immunohistochemistry and reduced lung pathology implicates the presence of active anti-PRRSV mucosal immune response elicited by Nano-KAg vaccine in the lungs (Fig 3 & 4) . The most important finding from our study to swine farmers and researchers is that pigs vaccinated intranasally with Nano-KAg vaccine completely clear the PRRSV viremia of a virulent heterologous virus by two-week post-challenge. Further, in yet another Nano-KAg vaccine study we inoculated a booster dose of the vaccine and co-administered with a potent mucosal adjuvant, intranasally, showed the complete clearance of the replicating heterologous PRRSV from the lungs and clearance of viremia earlier than the current study (Binjawadagi et al., manuscript submitted). In conclusion, our study has suggested that innovative strategy of intranasal delivery of PRRSV Nano-KAg vaccine has the potential to control PRRS outbreaks, and it has the potential to reduce economic losses to swine producers. Considering pig a useful large animal model, our study may serve as a useful impetus to undertake intranasal PLGA nanoparticle-based vaccine trials against human respiratory viral infections. Each bar represents average values from three pigs 6 SEM. Asterisk represents the statistical significant difference (p,0.05) between Nano-KAg and K-Ag received pig groups and Q represents the statistical significant difference (p,0.05) between unvaccinated and Nano-KAg received pig groups. A similar trend in results was obtained in an independent second trial performed using same number of animals. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0051794.g006",
