Ascovirus-parasitoids wasp-noctuid insects constitute the dissemination system. Selection of suitable reference genes for the dissemination system could play an important role in elucidating the pathogenic molecular mechanisms of ascovirus. Unfortunately, such studies on potential reference genes in the dissemination system of ascoviruses are lacking. In the present study, we evaluated 11 candidate reference genes: \u03b2-actin1 (ACT1), \u03b2-actin2 (ACT2), elongation factor 1 (EF1), elongation factor 2 (EF2), ribosomal protein L10 (L10), ribosomal protein L17A (L17A), superoxide dismutase (SOD), 28S ribosome (28S), Tubulin (TUB) and 18S ribosome (18S). The samples were originally from various virus concentrations and points-in-time of experimental treatments using RefFinder and four algorithms. The results showed that EF1 was the most stable internal gene in S. exigua and M. similis and that EF2 was the most stable in the IOZCAS-Spex-II-A cell line, and the stability of reference genes were confirmed via the expression levels of two inhibitor of apoptosis-like (iap-like) genes from Heliothis virescens ascovirus 3 h (HvAV-3h). This study provides a crucial basis for future research that explores the molecular mechanisms of the pathogenesis of ascoviruses.",

Heliothis virescens ascovirus 3h genome length is 190, 519 bp and is a strain of the species Heliothis virescens ascovirus 3a 4, 5 . HvAV-3h has strong pathogenicity to S. exigua, Spodoptera litura and Helicoverpa armigera 6-8 . However, ascoviruses must be transmitted by parasitoid wasps in the field. A potential application value of ascoviruses for bio-control was predicted because of the dissemination system and acute pathogenic features of ascoviruses, which was different from other insect viruses, e.g., nucleopolyhedrovirus (NPV). Research on the pathogenic molecular mechanisms is relatively deficient for ascoviruses, and research on implementing a stabile reference gene for ascoviruses has not been performed. RT-qPCR is usually used in research on pathogenic molecular mechanisms. To achieve RNA quantitation and data normalization with different samples, we selected an optimal reference gene to correct the reliability and accuracy of quantitative results. Due to its simple operation, high sensitivity, low pollution and good repeatability, RT-qPCR is widely used in basic science research 9 . However, diverse samples have different RNA efficiencies of extraction, RNA quality, and reverse transcription efficiency of the product 10 . Therefore, it is important to ensure a high quality of RNA in RT-qPCR 11 . Generally, housekeeping genes are considered to be relatively stable expressed in all cell types and physiological states 12 . However, some studies have indicated that the expression quantity of housekeeping genes in different cell types, tissues, experimental conditions and under different physiological states is inconsistent 13, 14 . For example, ACT was unsuitable as a reference gene when human cell lines were infected by cytomegalovirus, human herpesvirus-6, camelpox virus, SARS coronavirus or yellow",

Application of the geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper tools was based on the Microsoft Excel program. When geNorm and NormFinder tools performed a stable analysis of the data, the cycle threshold (Ct) was converted into a linear scale (the highest relative quantity for each gene was set to 1). The geNorm algorithm calculated an expression stable value (M) for each gene and then compared the pair-wise variation Vn/Vn + 1. The gene with the lowest M value represented the most stable expression. A ratio of Vn/Vn + 1 below 0.15 indicated that the use of an additional reference gene would not significantly improve normalization 33 . NormFinder combined the interclass variance and intraclass variance to calculate a stable value. The assessment of the reference gene stability was dependent on the size of the stable value 34 . The raw data of cycle threshold (Ct) values (CP values) and PCR efficiency (E) of the reference genes were determined as the best fitted standards by BestKeeper. The cardinal principle for identification of stably expressed reference genes by Bestkeeper was that the expression levels of suitable reference genes should be highly correlated. Therefore, the correlation between each candidate gene and the index was calculated, describing the relation between the index and the contributing candidate reference gene by the highest R value, lowest SD and CV values (<1) and the P value 35 . We also used the online software RefFinder, which integrates the above-mentioned four algorithms (geNorm, Normfinder, BestKeeper, and the delta Ct method) to compare and rank the examined candidate reference genes. According to the results of RefFinder, candidate genes with the top rankings were considered to be the most stably expressed under the tested experimental conditions and thus could be selected as optimal reference genes. Every gene was sorted by the five different statistical approaches separately.",

According to the Geomean of Ranking value by Reffinder, the stability rankings from the most stable to the least stable gene in all ascovirus-infected S. exigua were EF1, L17A, EF2, ACT1, L10, SOD, TUB, ACT2, and 28S (Table 3) . Based on the geNorm algorithm (Fig. 3F) , the gene pair EF2/L17A was the most stably expressed in all samples.

HvAV-3h has been recently isolated from S. exigua 4 . Li found that the early instars of S. exigua were significantly easier to infect with HvAV-3h compared to the later instars, using 10-fold serial dilutions (0 to 7) of HvAV-3h-containing hemolymph to infect S. litura larvae. There were no significant differences in larval mortalities from 10 0 -to 10 3 -fold dilutions; however, significant declines were observed at the 10 4 -fold dilution and above 7 . Compared to the healthy larval population, the typical symptoms and survival times of the diseased larval population were considerably extended, food intake was significantly reduced, and the body weight remained fairly constant in the 3 rd and 4 th instar larvae, which happened after inoculation with the ascovirus. However, the corrected mortality rates for the 1 st through 5 th instar inoculated per os were very low 8 . Therefore, the ascovirus mode of dissemination, which relies on the parasitoid wasp M. similis, served as a vector when the female parasitoid wasp acquired the virus. The ovipositor with the virion viability was 4.1 \u00b1 1.4 days, and infected host larvae were still acceptable for egg laying by parasitoids. The parasitoids thereafter transmitted the virus to healthy hosts 26 . It follows that ascoviruses, with this dissemination system, have probably been regarded as significant for long-term pest control. Moreover, there are few studies that have elucidated the selection of reference genes for ascovirus infection dissemination systems. Therefore, stable expression of reference gene (s) is important for understanding the molecular mechanism of rapid pathogenesis and chronic death. RT-qPCR is now the most sensitive method to study low-abundance mRNA from various tissue samples and experimental conditions. Thus, it is necessary to precisely determine normalization strategies 38 . Previous studies demonstrated that when reference genes were selected, the geometric mean of multiples should be used to ensure more accurate results 33 .",

Thus, to gain a clear understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms, the screening of reference genes for S. exigua and different concentrations of ascovirus has provided a foundation for future research. At present, according to differences between physiological stages and different tissues in S. exigua, their suitability as reference genes was diverse with each treatment. In general, SOD, ACT2, ACT1, EF1 and GAPDH were stably expressed in all developmental stage sample sets. L10, EF2, L17A and EF1 were ranked highest in all tissue sample sets 30, 39 . The expression of these internal genes is considerably different in different experimental conditions. We therefore reassessed the stability before RT-qPCR testing. Our results indicated that EF1 ranked hi4ghest in all sample sets by RefFinder, Delta Ct and Normfinder, whereas the BestKeeper method ranked ACT1 as the best reference gene and EF1 ranked at the fifth position. The subtle differences in ranking among the top order reference genes could be imputed to differences in algorithms of the employed software programs and sensitivities towards the co-regulated reference genes.",

In most studies of Hymenoptera, 18S or ACT has been commonly employed as the reference gene [40] [41] [42] . At the same time, none of the studies contributed to a comprehensive selection of internal control genes for Hymenoptera (Braconidae). In our study, although 18S RNA had the highest expression of all the candidate reference genes, it was not the most stable.

However, HvAV-3e did not replicate in the Pieris rapae (Pieridae) cell line, which was non-noctuid 43 . This means that ascoviruses were likely to impact the IOZCAS-Spex-II-A cell line, which was derived from the fat body of S. exigua. Consequently, stable reference genes can be helpful in further research on the cytopathic effect of ascoviruses. This study showed that the IOZCAS-Spex-II-A cell line was susceptible to infection by ascoviruses. AcMNPV could also easily infect the IOZCAS-Spex-II-A cell line 16, 44 . It has been reported that with the selection of reference genes in the Sf21 cell line infected by ascoviruses, DNA-free RNA was used as a template with a combination of the Sf21 cell line 28S gene-specific reverse primer and the oligo-dT primer for first strand cDNA synthesis. The results indicated that the Ct values were significantly higher and more variable during the course of viral infection when only the oligo-dT primer was used in the cDNA synthesis step than when the 28S-R primer in conjunction with the oligo-dT primer was used 16 , although the stability of the reference genes was not analyzed by the geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and delta cycle threshold (Ct) method and Online software RefFinder. In our study, we applied the conventional synthesis method of cDNA using RefFinder, Delta Ct, geNorm, Normfinder and BestKeeper algorithms to analyze the Ct values. As a consequence, the results indicated that 28S was the least suitable gene in the IOZCAS-Spex-II-A cell line across all samples, while the EF2 gene was expressed most stably in comparison with 8 other candidate internal genes. Generally, the most stable reference gene of the IOZCAS-Spex-II-A cell line and S. exigua should provide the same results. We acquired EF2 and L17A, which were relatively stable in screening of the reference genes for S. exigua and the IOZCAS-Spex -II-A cell line. However, in S. exigua, EF1 was the top-ranked by RefFinder, Delta Ct and NormFinder but was in the fifth positon by BestKeeper and the third position by geNorm. This phenomenon was probably due to the virus being able to directly impact the cell line; however, virus attack of insects may be influenced by other factors such as pH values, environmental temperature and host larvae with different instars.",

The gene pairs EF2/L17A and EF1/L10 were considered the most suitable pairs of genes to normalize samples in S. exigua and the IOZCAS-Spex-II-A cell line, respectively, across all samples. However, conditions such as changes in M. similis would require normalization by three or more reference genes because the values of pairwise variations were above the cut-off range of 0.15. Thus, across all of the samples in S. exigua and the IOZCAS-Spex-II-A cell line, we advise the use of two reference genes under different experimental conditions.",

Based on the sequence similarity to known IAPs, the iap-like genes have been chosen as the target genes. In the genomes of HvAV-3h, IAP genes have evolved mechanisms to reduce formation of apoptosis to guarantee the propagation of HvAV in host cells 45 . When the most stable reference genes (EF1, L17A and EF2) were employed to calibrated the data of gene expression in the S. exigua and IOZCAS-Spex-II-A cell line, the expression levels of the two iap-like genes revealed no significant changes. However, using the least stable reference genes 28S, ACT1and ACT2 to analyze the expression levels of the two iap-like genes, the results showed significant variation between two calculations which used the least stable reference genes. Therefore, it is necessary to use an appropriate stable reference gene for calibration of gene expression.",

Hence, establishing a best reference gene for RT-qPCR in dissemination systems will benefit researchers in this research arena. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive report on the identification and validation of optimal candidate reference genes for accurate transcript normalization of gene expression in studies using RT-qPCR in the dissemination system of ascoviruses under various experimental conditions. We recommend the use of EF1 in S. exigua and M. similis and EF2 in the IOZCAS-Spex-II-A cell line. This study offers a way forward for the study of the pathogenic molecular mechanism of ascoviruses.",
