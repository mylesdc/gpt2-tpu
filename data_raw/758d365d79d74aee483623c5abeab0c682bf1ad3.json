Here we show that intrinsic signalling of CEACAM1 is essential for generating efficient B-cell responses. Although CEACAM1 exerts limited influence on the proliferation of B cells, expression of CEACAM1 induces survival of proliferating B cells via the BTK/Syk/NF-kB-axis. The absence of this signalling cascade in naive Ceacam1 \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice limits the survival of B cells. During systemic infection with cytopathic vesicular stomatitis virus, Ceacam1 \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice can barely induce neutralizing antibody responses and die early after infection. We find, therefore, that CEACAM1 is a crucial regulator of B-cell survival, influencing B-cell numbers and protective antiviral antibody responses.",

Their main functions are producing virus-specific antibodies, presenting antigen and participating in building the splenic architecture [1] [2] [3] [4] . Three subsets of B cells are important contributors to immune responses against pathogens: B1, marginal zone (MZ) and follicular B cells 5, 6 . B1 B cells usually seed the peritoneal and pleural cavities and develop T-cell-independent antibody responses against bacterial antigens 7 . B1 B cells are also responsible for generating the socalled natural antibodies that are detectable in na\u00efve mice that have not experienced antigen 7 . MZ B cells are located in the splenic MZ, where they have direct contact with blood-borne pathogens. Therefore, antigen-activated MZ B cells usually respond hours after infection and build the specific antibody response early after infection 5 . Antigen-activated follicular B cells move to germinal centres, where the antibody's affinity matures, and switch classes by recombining to mount long-lasting highaffinity immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody responses against pathogens 5 .",

            "text": "Once B cells leave the bone marrow, two important signals determine their fate. First, tonic signalling by the B-cell receptor (BCR) in the absence of antigen is essential for the further differentiation and survival of mature B cells 8 . Second, signalling via the B-cell-activating factor (BAFF) receptor strongly contributes to B-cell survival 9 . BCR activation of B cells leads to phosphorylation of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), a member of the Tec family of non-transmembrane protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) 10, 11 . BTK phosphorylation after BCR ligation leads to the activation of canonical nuclear factor-k light-chain enhancer of activated B (NF-kB) cell pathway, in addition to nuclear factor of activated T (NFAT) cells and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathways 12, 13 . Crosslinking of the BAFF receptor activates the NF-kB pathway non-canonically via NF-kB-inducing kinase (NIK) and inhibitor of NF-kB, IkB kinase 1 (ref. 14) . Although BAFF receptor signalling was first believed to be independent of BCR signalling, a recent report suggested that BAFF receptor signalling may also include the BCR signalling pathway components 15 . The NF-kB pathway substantially contributes to B-cell survival by inducing the expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-x L and Mcl-1 (ref. 13) .",

            "text": "The carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1), a member of the carcinoembryonic antigen and the immunoglobulin families, is engaged in intercellular binding interactions that affect various signal transduction pathways associated with cell proliferation and differentiation 16, 17 . CEACAM1 usually acts via intercellular adhesion through homophilic (CEACAM1-CEACAM1) or heterophilic (CEACAM1-CEACAM5, CEACAM1-CEACAM6 and CEACAM1-CEACAM8) interactions 17, 18 . In mice, there are at least four CEACAM1 isoforms: CEACAM1-4L, CEACAM1-4S, CEACAM1-2L and CEACAM1-2S. The CEACAM1 ectodomain is composed of four (CEACAM1-4) or two (CEACAM1-2) highly glycosylated Ig-like domains, which are highly flexible and participate in anti-parallel (trans) and parallel (cis) homophilic binding 19 . The isoform with the short cytoplasmic tail (CEACAM1-S) can bind calmodulin, tropomyosin, actin, annexin II and PDIP38, and is phosphorylated on Ser449 through protein kinase C [20] [21] [22] . The isoform with the long cytoplasmic tail (CEACAM1-L) contains two additional immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif-carrying segments 17, 23 . Within these immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif-carrying segments, phosphorylation at two tyrosines initiates signalling through CEACAM1-mediated signal transduction. Furthermore, trans-homophilic CEACAM1 binding induces cis-dimerization, and primarily dimeric but not monomeric CEACAM1-L recruits two specific Src homology region 2 domain-containing phosphatase-type phosphatases (PTPN6 and PTPN11) 19, [24] [25] [26] . Crosslinking of CEACAM1 as monomers and dimers induces binding of the SRC family of PTK members to CEACAM1, which typically causes cell activation 19,26 . CEACAM1 is expressed by a broad range of cell types, including angiogenically activated endothelia/lymphendothelia, various leukocyte subpopulations, normal epithelial cells and tumour cells 16 . Although Ceacam1 \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice do not exhibit this broad CEACAM1 expression, they develop normally and, in the absence of specific challenges, show no signs of disease 27 . CEACAM1 has been described primarily as a regulator of T cells in the gut 20, [28] [29] [30] . Expression of CEACAM1-L inhibits T-cell proliferation and therefore prevents inflammatory bowel disease 30 . Expression of CEACAM1-S is essential for the development of follicular T helper cell-driven IgA production by gut B cells 20 . CEACAM1 also acts as a co-stimulatory molecule for T-cell receptor and BCR signalling [31] [32] [33] . The role of CEACAM1 in B-cell homeostasis and in antiviral B-cell responses in vivo remains unknown.",

Erythrocytes stained negative for CEACAM1 ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). As previously reported [34] [35] [36] , high levels of CEACAM1 expression were detected on blood granulocytes (Ly6G \u00fe ) and monocytes (CD115 \u00fe ) with the anti-CEACAM1-specific monoclonal antibody (clone CC1, Fig. 1a ). Cells from Ceacam1 \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice stained negative for CEACAM1 (Fig. 1a) . Next, we analysed CEACAM1 expression on lymphoid cells in the blood. CD90.2 cells, representing primarily T cells, showed weak CEACAM1 expression by individual cells (Fig. 1b) , a finding suggesting that various T-cell subpopulations may differentially express CEACAM1. B cells in peripheral blood expressed CEACAM1 at high levels ( Fig. 1b) . Evaluation of precursor (B220 \u00fe CD43 \u00c0 IgM \u00fe IgD low ) and mature B cells (B220 \u00fe CD43 \u00c0 IgD high ) in the bone marrow revealed strong CEACAM1 expression in the B-cell lineage (Fig. 1c) .

Furthermore, quantitative RT-PCR analyses of expression of long and short isoforms of CEACAM1 showed that murine splenic B cells express more long than short isoforms (Fig. 1f ). In conclusion, strong CEACAM1 expression was detected in all B-cell subpopulations tested, a finding implying that CEACAM1 is functionally relevant in B cells.",

            "text": "Recently, expression of CEACAM1 in granulocytes was shown to lead to Syk phosphorylation 37 . In addition, expression of CEACAM1 participates in Btk phosphorylation 38 . In B cells, Syk and Btk are essential signalling molecules, which are phosphorylated after BCR or BAFFR crosslinkage and play an essential role in induction of survival signals 15, 39 . We thus focused on the influence of CEACAM1 on Syk activity during CEACAM1 and BCR crosslinkage. Indeed, in B-cell lymphoma immunoprecipitation of CEACAM1 pulled down Syk ( Supplementary Fig. 2) , which confirms the recently published interaction of Syk and CEACAM1 (ref. 37) . To get insights into the functional relevance of CEACAM1 in B cells, we isolated splenocytes from WT and Ceacam1 \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice and challenged them with anti-IgM, anti-CEACAM1 activating antibody (monoclonal antibody, CC1) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Ig-a, which associated with BCR, showed slight tyrosine-phosphorylation after IgM crosslinkage (Fig. 2a, left panel) . Neither anti-CEACAM1 monoclonal antibody challenge nor LPS treatment induced phosphorylation of Ig-a (Fig. 2a, right  panel) . We subsequently analysed Syk tyrosine phosphorylation in WT and Ceacam1 \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice. As expected BCR crosslinkage induced strong Syk phosphorylation. Absence of CEACAM1 strongly reduced Syk phosphorylation after BCR crosslinkage (Fig. 2b, left panel) . Challenge with anti-CEACAM1 monoclonal antibody also triggered phosphorylation of Syk, which was stronger than LPS-induced Syk phosphorylation (Fig. 2b, right  panel) . Therefore, we concluded that CEACAM1 enhances Syk phosphorylation not only directly, but also after BCR crosslinkage. Next we analysed the downstream target of Syk, Btk, another member of the Tec family of non-transmembrane PTKs. Flow cytometric analysis showed that Btk is transiently phosphorylated in B cells derived from WT but not in Ceacam1 \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice after challenge with anti-IgM (Fig. 2c ( Fig. 2c, lower panel) . We therefore conclude that CEACAM1 directly influences the phosphorylation of Syk and Btk, after BCR and CEACAM1 crosslinkage. To gain insight into downstream targets of CEACAM1 activation, we analysed specific Syk substrates. We observed that the CEACAM1 signal phosphorylate Erk1 (Erk-42) but not Erk2 (Erk-44) and, to a lesser extent, p-38. LPS could phosphorylate both Erk1/2 and p-38 (Fig. 2d,e) . Triggering with the anti-CEACAM1 monoclonal antibody induced degradation of IkBa and slight phosphorylation of p65, a finding suggesting that CEACAM1 signals activate the canonical NF-kB pathway (Fig. 2f ). Tonic BCR signalling followed by Syk phosphorylation induces several survival genes, which are essential for B cell survival 12 . To see whether lack of CEACAM1 influences expression of those genes, we cultured purified splenic B cells from WT and Ceacam1 \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice for 24 h without further stimulation and measured mRNA expression of various NF-kB-regulated genes. Indeed, lack of CEACAM1 led to reduced expression of Bcl6, Pax5, Bcl2a1 and Xiap (Fig. 2g ). In line with the known positive feedback loop of NF-kB, we found reduced expression of NF-kB p65, Rel-B, Nfatc1 and Nfatc2 in Ceacam1 \u00c0 / \u00c0 B cells (Fig. 2h,i) . c-Jun, c-Fos and Ap1 were not influenced by CEACAM1 expression (Fig. 2j) . Blimp1, which is another key regulator of plasma cell differentiation, was not affected by CEACAM1 expression (Fig. 2k) . Taken together, we found that CEACAM1 contributed to the Syk phosphorylation during BCR and/or CEACAM1 crosslinkage, leading to the enhanced expression of NF-kB, NFAT and survival genes.",

Challenge with anti-CEA-CAM1 (monoclonal antibody, CC1) induced some proliferation in WT but not in Ceacam1 \u00c0 / \u00c0 B cells (Fig. 3a) . Challenge with LPS (TLR4-ligand) or CD40/IL-4 induced proliferation that was comparable between WT and Ceacam1 \u00c0 / \u00c0 B cells (Fig. 3a) .

First, we quantified the total number of living B cells with diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining and fluorescenceactivated cell sorting (FACS) beads. Without any further challenge, WT B cells consistently died under our in vitro culture conditions (Fig. 3b) , a finding that agrees with that of a previous study 40 . Lack of CEACAM1 enhanced death of B cells (Fig. 3b ). When challenged with CD40/IL-4, the numbers of WT B cells were higher than those of non-activated B cells after 24 h (Fig. 3b) . The numbers of Ceacam1 \u00c0 / \u00c0 B cells 24 h after stimulation with CD40/IL-4 increased similarly to those of WT B cells, however, declined rapidly 24 h after challenge with CD40/ IL-4 ( Fig. 3b ). This rapid decrease was probably due to apoptosis and cell death, because Annexin-V staining was significantly enhanced in none activated and activated DAPI \u00c0 , B cells (Fig. 3c) . We postulate that defective survival of Ceacam1 \u00c0 / \u00c0 B cells was due to limited Syk and Btk phosphorylation. To test this hypothesis, we treated WT and Ceacam1 \u00c0 / \u00c0 B cells with the Btk inhibitor Ibrutinib 41 . We observed that inhibition of Btk in WT B cells led to the rapid death of B cells. This effect was less pronounced in Ceacam1 \u00c0 / \u00c0 B cells (Fig. 3d ). In conclusion, we found that lack of CEACAM1 signal limited survival of resting and activated B cells.",

To gauge the direct influence of CEACAM1 expressed on B cells, we made use of mixed bone marrow chimeras, where the irradiation of WT (CD45.2) mice was followed by reconstitution with bone marrow from WT (CD45.1) and WT (CD45.2, mixed 1:1) or WT (CD45.1) and Ceacam1 \u00c0 / \u00c0 (CD45.2, mixed 1:1) mice. Analysis of peripheral blood showed some, but not statistically significant differenc in blood B-cell levels between WT and Ceacam1 \u00c0 / \u00c0 cells (Fig. 4i) . In contrast, splenic MZ B cells were only derived from WT (CD45.1) mice (Fig. 4j) . FO B cells were also mainly from WT (CD45.1) origin (Fig. 4j ). This suggests that CEACAM1 B-cell intrinsic signals are essential for B-cell survival after B cells home to the spleen. Next, we analysed how the lack of CEACAM1 contributes to antibody production in unchallenged mice. Analysis of various immunoglobulin (Ig) subtypes in the serum of na\u00efve WT and Ceacam1 \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice showed a reduction in IgM, IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, IgG3, IgA and IgE in Ceacam1 \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice ( Supplementary Fig. 6 ).

In the absence of stimulation, Ceacam1 \u00c0 / \u00c0 \u00c2 Vi10 B cells were reduced as compared to WT \u00c2 Vi10 B cells (Fig. 5b) , a finding indicating that CEACAM1 provides an important survival signal in antigen-activated and non-activated B cells. In line with these data, Ceacam1 \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice displayed delayed induction of total VSV-neutralizing antibodies (Fig. 5c, left panel) . In agreement with this finding, Ceacam1 \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice failed to generate neutralizing IgG antibodies (Fig. 5c, right panel) . ELISA confirmed that VSV-specific IgG levels were significantly low in Ceacam1 \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice ( Supplementary Fig. 7, right panel) .",

To demonstrate that CEACAM1 expression by B cells is responsible for poor VSVneutralizing antibody responses, we adoptively transferred CEACAM1-competent VSV-specific B cells into WT and Ceacam1 \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice. This adoptive transfer of B cells rescued VSV-neutralizing antibody responses (Fig. 5e ). Detailed analysis showed that both MZ and FO B cells could rescue the VSVneutralizing antibody response in the Ceacam1 \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice ( Supplementary Fig. 8 ). Absence of early neutralizing antibodies can result in the spread of VSV to the nervous system 45 . To determine whether a reduction in the levels of neutralizing antibodies in Ceacam1 \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice affected the immune response of virus control, we analysed organ virus titres 8 days after systemic VSV infection. Indeed, Ceacam1 \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice exhibited VSV replication in the brain and spinal cord, whereas WT mice controlled VSV replication in all organs (Fig. 5f ). VSV replication in Ceacam1 \u00c0 / \u00c0 brains was associated with the death of mice (Fig. 5g) . To determine whether a diminished B-cell response contributed to mortality, we performed survival experiments. Ceacam1 \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice with adoptively transferred VSV-specific WT B cells survived VSV infection (Fig. 5h) . Therefore, B-cell intrinsic expression of CEACAM1 is essential for initiating a protective antiviral immune response after exposure to VSV.",
