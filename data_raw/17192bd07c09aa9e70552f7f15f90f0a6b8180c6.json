            "text": "Overlapping genes represent a fascinating evolutionary puzzle, since they encode two functionally unrelated proteins from the same DNA sequence. They originate by a mechanism of overprinting, in which point mutations in an existing frame allow the expression (the \"birth\") of a completely new protein from a second frame. In viruses, in which overlapping genes are abundant, these new proteins often play a critical role in infection, yet they are frequently overlooked during genome annotation. This results in erroneous interpretation of mutational studies and in a significant waste of resources. Therefore, overlapping genes need to be correctly detected, especially since they are now thought to be abundant also in eukaryotes. Developing better detection methods and conducting systematic evolutionary studies require a large, reliable benchmark dataset of known cases. We thus assembled a highquality dataset of 80 viral overlapping genes whose expression is experimentally proven. Many of them were not present in databases. We found that overall, overlapping genes differ significantly from non-overlapping genes in their nucleotide and amino acid composition. In particular, the proteins they encode are enriched in high-degeneracy amino acids and depleted in low-degeneracy ones, which may alleviate the evolutionary constraints acting on overlapping genes. Principal component analysis revealed that the vast majority of overlapping genes follow a similar composition bias, despite their heterogeneity in length and function. Six proven mammalian overlapping genes also followed this bias. We propose that this apparently near-universal composition bias may either favour the birth of overlapping genes, or/and result from selection pressure acting on them.",

First, they encode proteins originated de novo by overprinting [11, 12] , as opposed to origination by well-characterized processes such as gene duplication or horizontal gene transfer [13] . Overprinting is a process in which mutations in an ancestral reading frame allow the expression of a second reading frame (the de novo frame), while preserving the expression of the first frame. De novo proteins have been little studied but are known to play an important role in viral pathogenicity [14] , for instance by neutralizing the host interferon response [15, 16] , the RNA interference pathway [17, 18] or by inducing apoptosis in host cells [19, 20] . In addition, those characterized so far have previously unknown 3D structural folds [22, 23] and mechanisms of action [17, 21] .",

We found such genes in 894 genomes (each corresponding to a different species), corresponding to a total of 5322 overlaps. We excluded bacteriophages (174 species corresponding to 509 overlaps) and viruses with a genome longer than 30 kb (142 species corresponding to 3440 overlaps), since curation of large genomes proved too difficult [14] . Most of these genomes, indeed, have not been subject to individual review and thus are classified as \"provisional\" rather than \"reviewed\", unlike the majority of small virus genomes [42] .",

This number is probably an underestimate, since many proteins in the dataset have not been characterized in detail. In 3 overlaps, the interaction between proteins encoded by overlapping genes is critical for viral assembly. They are the VP2/capsid overlap of chicken anemia virus [69] , the VP1/AAP overlap of Adeno-associated 2 virus [70] , and the ORF3/capsid overlap of hepatitis E virus [70] .

We identified 20 critical composition differences (Fig 3, see also S4 Table) . On the one hand, overlapping genes are highly enriched in the nucleotide C, the dinucleotides CG and CC, the amino acids arginine, serine, and proline, the synonymous codons CGA, TCG, CCC, and CCG, and in amino acids with a high codon degeneracy (Fig 3) . On the other hand, overlapping genes are highly depleted in the nucleotides A and T, the dinucleotides AT, TA, and TT, the amino acids tyrosine and isoleucine, the synonymous codon TAT, and in amino acids with a low codon degeneracy (Fig 3) . We confirmed the relevance of the 20 critical composition differences with the Wilcoxon test for paired data. In all cases, we found a z score largely exceeding the cut-off of significance (z = -2.55; P <0.01) (S4 Table) .",

Here, by using a large and curated dataset, we reliably identified 20 composition features that are peculiar to overlapping genes (Fig 3) . This pattern remained very similar, even when we used a more conservative control, which included only the non-overlapping genes closest to the overlap, instead of all non-overlapping genes (data not shown). Therefore, the composition bias of overlapping genes can be considered robust. We can distinguish two main (non-exclusive) hypotheses that could explain this composition bias.",

An example is given by the long overlap between p69 and the replicase of Turnip yellow mosaic virus (TYMV). The viral genome has an unusually low proportion of TA dinucleotides (2.1%) including the portion of replicase that overlaps with p69 (our observations).

For instance, an enrichment in amino acids with a high codon degeneracy and a depletion in amino acids with a low codon degeneracy (Fig 3B) could have been selected because they minimize the constraints under which the two overlapping reading frames evolve. This bias with respect to codon degeneracy had been suggested before [14, 92] on much smaller datasets, but not reliably proven. An example is given by the overlap between P3N-PIPO and the polyprotein of Turnip mosaic virus. Compared to the non-overlapping coding regions of the genome, the overlapping region has a comparable proportion of TA dinucleotides, which would not have resulted in a decreased probability of occurrence of stop codons, unlike in hypothesis 1. However, the overlapping region has a strong enrichment in amino acids with a high codon degeneracy (34% vs. 21%), which might be a sign of selection having acted to minimize the constraints under which the two overlapping frames evolve (hypothesis 2).",

In contrast, we find a weak, albeit significant, negative correlation (r = -0.27), confirmed when using Spearman correlation coefficient (rho = -0.34). The discrepancy is due to the use of a normalization and of a logarithmic transformation in the calculations of Chirico and co-workers [42] . Indeed, they calculate the correlation between the length of the genome and the ratio of the length of overlaps to the length of the genome. Considering the same variable (the genome length) twice in a correlation test will necessary produce an artefactual correlation, since the data examined are not independent. In fact, we note that by using the untransformed pooled genomic subset (that is excluding bacteriophages and genomes >30 kb) from Chirico et al.

For instance, since the vast majority of overlaps have at least one homolog (data not shown), we could investigate their evolution through comparative analyses of homologous overlapping sequences. Second, we have identified 6 overlaps with an unusual sequence composition (see outliers in Figs 4 and 5) . Further studies need to identify whether this composition is linked to their function. Third, 8 viral overlapping genes, for which there is incomplete evidence need to be confirmed experimentally (S2 Table) .",
