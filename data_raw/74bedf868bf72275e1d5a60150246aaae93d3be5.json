            "text": "On the other hand, in recent years the interest in designing and synthetizing new antiparasitic molecules has been renewed, facilitated by the application of in silico docking; by using such techniques several research groups have investigated newly synthetized molecules as potential antiprotozoal compounds, reporting active molecules against E. histolytica and other protozoa 11, 12 . An example of these bioactive compounds are T-001, T-011, and T-016 (Table 1) , which are quinoxaline-7-carboxylate 1,4-di-N-oxide derivatives 11 , and were used in the present work to validate the model reported here. Although the aforementioned compounds possess in vitro activity against E. histolytica, tissue-acting drugs are required to treat invasive amoebiasis, which usually are evaluated in either in vitro and/or in vivo models. Although in vivo models have contributed significantly to the study of amoebiasis, there is no animal model that mimics the whole cycle of the human disease 13 . For most in vitro studies, axenic cultures of E. histolytica are used 14, 15 . However, it has been reported that long-term axenic cultivation has a profound effect on E. histolytica virulence and several virulence markers, and culture conditions induce a strong selective pressure on E. histolytica, since amoebic virulence can vary from zero to its highest grade, or vice versa 16 . Also, in vitro cultures lack complex interactions between stroma components and different cell types that contribute to amoeba pathogenesis in animals. Regarding the latter, ex vivo cultures of precision-cut intestinal and hepatic slices represent alternative 3D models that contain all of the cell types belonging to the tissue from which they were obtained, and are therefore considered as mini-organs. Slices have many advantages over in vitro and in vivo systems, i.e. they retain their metabolic and transport capacity among others 17 . In previous papers, our group reported that hamster liver slices infected with E. histolytica represent an ex vivo 3D model to study hepatic amoebiasis based on morphological and molecular characterization of the disease ex vivo 18, 19 . In these studies, we observed that morphologic characteristics in amoebae were conserved at the evaluated experimental times, as were eritophagocytic activity, immune response reaction, and virulence factors induction. Furthermore, Bansal et al. 20 reported human colon explants to analyze amoebic virulence factors and reproduce the intestinal invasion by E. histolytica as well as the tissue non-response to E. dispar, a non-pathogenic species. Similarly, Girard-Misguich et al. 21 utilized porcine colonic explants, derived from miniature histocompatible SLA d/d piglets, to co-culture with virulent (HM1:IMSS) and avirulent (Rahman) strains of E. histolytica. They were able to observe the tissue invasion by the trophozoites and the typical innate immune response, similarly to the report on human colon explants. Likewise, Ximenez et al. 22 evaluated genes related to the pathogenicity and E. histolytica survival, and genes linked to the immune response in precision cut liver slices from human tissue. The afore mentioned studies and the present work differ between them in the origin of the tissue employed (hamster, pig or human), explant preparation methodology (manual or semiautomatic), culture media, amoeba strains (virulent/avirulent), trophozoite inocula, and evaluated genes (host or parasite genes).",

Animal models also have been used for the study of amoebiasis, however they have the disadvantage that is not possible to induce both intestinal and hepatic lesions in the same animal host 13 . Since E. histolytica only infects humans and non-human primates, results obtained in in vivo studies with laboratory animals cannot always be translated directly to humans. The practical application of using in vivo tests for the investigation of new compounds or molecules with anti-amoebic activity is limited by both, the large number of animals that would be needed, and by the large amount of compounds required.",

Results using liver slices infected with amoebae in the currently study are identical to those obtained in our previous work 18, 19 . We also validated intestinal and hepatic slices as experimental infection models using compounds with known anti-amoebic activity. In the current study, intestinal slices were cultured up to 9 h in the presence of the amoebae (12 h of incubation in total). Other investigators have reported maintenance of intestinal slice viability during similar culture periods. For example, de Kanter et al. 43 , and van de Kerkhof et al. 44 reported maintenance of viability and metabolic activity up to 3 h of culturing. Two hours of incubation was used to analyze the interaction of xenobiotic agents with transporting proteins in the intestine 45 . Other authors have shown that small and large intestine slices remain viable for 8 and 24 h respectively when the intracellular ATP content was evaluated, while after 24 h most of the phase I and II enzymes implicated in metabolic transformation show significant changes depending on the origin of the tissue 46 . The incubation time over which tissue slices remain viable depends on the tissue, where 96 and 24 h are suitable for liver slices and intestinal slices respectively 47 . In general terms, we were able to observe the typical lesions of the amoebic disease during the ex vivo infection of both PCLS and PCIS. Incubation during longer times with the virulent strain of E. histolytica caused massive destruction of both tissues due to the amoebae infection.",

One of the compounds, T-011, showed in vitro cytotoxicity at a concentration of 5.86 \u00b5M, however to decrease the cytotoxic effect, the concentration of this compound may be reduced since the IC 50 value vs E. histolytica is 0.35 \u00b5M. www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ One of the main challenges in the ex vivo intestinal tissue culture is the maintenance of viability 50 . However, in the present study the intestine and liver slices were cultured for 12 and 24 h respectively for the infection assays, maintaining metabolic viability as evaluated by the Alamar blue assay (data no shown) and preserving the morphological structure without alterations. Our results are similar to those reported by van de Kerkhof et al. 51 , and by Bansal et al. 20 , who have maintained ex vivo tissue cultures during 3 h and 7 h, respectively.",

Even though tissue slices have a lack of bloodstream, the observed inflammatory process could be related to a specific pattern of endogenous chemoattractants and inflammatory chemokines produced by immune and cells present in the intestine tissue when tissues were collected, since it is known that the gastrointestinal mucosa is the largest reservoir of macrophages in the body 20,52 . In the same way, Bansal et al. 20 reported the presence of monocytes and T-lymphocytes within the lamina propria of colonic explants, as well as the recruitment and migration of neutrophils and other resident immune cells to the site of infection which contributed to the immune response in intestine explants.

In addition, intracryptic abscesses were observed at 9 h of incubation. These changes are similar to those reported by Houpt et al. 53 in C3H/Hej mice infected with E. histolytica; they also observed viable amoebae in areas of epithelial ulceration and severe inflammation as reflected by the presence of plasma cells, neutrophils, and mast cells. Likewise, E. histolytica trophozoites degraded the intestinal epithelium and penetrated the mucosa of human intestine explants after 7 h of incubation 54, 55 . In addition, Bansal et al. 20 reported that trophozoites reach the epithelial surface and remove the mucosa, detaching the enterocytes and migrating along the crypts. These results are similar to those obtained in the present work. Indeed, the same microscopic changes were described in both in vivo and ex vivo models since 1970 by Prathap and Gilman, and by Espinosa-Cantellano and Mart\u00ednez-Palomo for human amoebic ulcerative colitis 56 . Our results lead us to believe that the experimental model of intestinal and hepatic tissue slices can be a valuable tool to predict the effect of anti-amoebic compounds in the early stages of E. histolytica infection. Although tissue slices have been well accepted for xenobiotic toxicity and metabolism studies 57,58 , as well as models for ex vivo infection with viruses 59,60 , bacteria 39 , and parasites 20,61 , the present work represents the first report of the in situ effect of compounds with anti-amoebic properties on the progression of infection by www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ E. histolytica in organotypic culture of both, hepatic and intestinal tissues derived from the same animal. Therefore, a significant reduction of biological variability into the experimental repetitions due to the biological responses between animals and even within the same animal is possible 62 .",

Since hepatotoxicity is an adverse reaction that may be induced by novel compounds being studied, models capable of predicting hepatic toxicity are necessary. Given that ALT and AST enzymes are considered as sensitive biochemical indicators of cellular injury and metabolic disturbances 65 we determined both enzyme levels on the hepatic slices treated with the synthetic compounds and metronidazole. Increased levels of ALT and AST enzymes indicate a toxicological effect of the tested compounds 66 , therefore, their increase in tissues treated with T-011 confirm the cytotoxicity found on Vero cells (IC 50 = 5.86 \u00b5M) and their lower selectivity (SI 16.74) compared to tissues treated with T-001 and T-016, which are not toxic to Vero cells and exhibited higher selectivity (SI > 65). Also, T-011 Induced more pathological changes at histologic level. T-001 and T-016 induced less inflammation and necrosis, and raised one of the two hepatic enzymes.

For the cytotoxicity analysis, confluent logarithmic growth phase cultures were used after 10,000 cells/100 \u03bcL were seeded in each of the wells of Precision-cut hamster intestine slices preparation. The entire process was performed at 4 \u00b0C under sterile conditions, in the shortest time of surgical manipulation in order to minimize the autolysis of the intestinal tissue due to ischemia. Briefly: the hamsters received an intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (64 mg/ 100 g of weight). Once in deep anesthesia, the colonic portion of the large intestine was carefully removed and divided into fragments of three centimeters long. These fragments were placed into Krebs-Henseleit buffer (KB buffer) at 4 \u00b0C, and were washed with the same buffer to remove the intestinal content, and then the superficial adipose tissue was carefully removed. Afterwards, the intestinal fragments were tied using surgical thread at one end, while on the opposite side was filled with low melting point agarose at 37 \u00b0C and placed in KB buffer at 4 \u00b0C for the agarose solidification. The fragments of intestine filled with agarose were placed in the tissue embedding unit of the Krumdieck tissue slicer in order to prepare regular agarose cylinders. These cylinders were placed in the sample holder of the Krumdieck tissue slicer, and intestinal tissue slices with thickness of 300-400 \u03bcm were prepared, always under constant recirculation of KB buffer at 4 \u00b0C gassed with carbogen (95% O 2 /5% CO 2 ).

(a) After dissection, the intestinal content was washed with cold KB buffer and the colon was divided in 3 cm segments; clean fragments were placed into ice-cold KB buffer. (b) The adhering fatty tissue was carefully removed. (c) One side of the intestinal fragments were tied with surgical thread and filled with 3% low melting point agarose at 37 \u00b0C. (d) Agarose infiltrated fragments filled with agarose were transferred into ice-cold KB buffer to permit the agarose solidification. (e) The intestinal segments were collocated in the tissue embedding unit of the Krumdieck tissue slicer and a pin was placed in the solid agarose to help the filling with 2% low melting point agarose at 37 \u00b0C of the mold in order to form cylinders containing the colon segments. (f) Colon tissue slices (300-400 \u00b5m thickness) were prepared using the Krumdieck tissue slicer and were collected in ice-cold KB buffer and incubated in culture medium at 37 \u00b0C. The process to obtain liver slices (lower panel) is simpler than intestinal slices; the process was also performed under sterile conditions, and in the shortest possible time. (g) After the liver was removed, it was placed into ice-cold KB buffer and the hepatic lobes were separated with a scalpel. (h) The hepatic lobes were cored into 5 mm diameter cylinders. (i) The cores were then placed in oxygenated KB buffer (4 \u00b0C, 95:5 O 2 : CO 2 ). (j) Liver tissue slices with 250-300 \u00b5m thickness were prepared using the Krumdieck tissue slicer and were gently placed and incubated onto 24-well microplates with culture medium at 37 \u00b0C.",
