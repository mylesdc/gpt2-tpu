To investigate the epidemiological and genetic variation of HCoV in Guangzhou, south China, we collected totally 13048 throat and nasal swab specimens from adults and children with fever and acute upper respiratory infection symptoms in Gunazhou, south China between July 2010 and June 2015, and the epidemiological features of HCoV and its species were studied. Specimens were screened for HCoV by real-time RT-PCR, and 7 other common respiratory viruses were tested simultaneously by PCR or real-time PCR. HCoV was detected in 294 cases (2.25%) of the 13048 samples, with most of them inpatients (251 cases, 85.4% of HCoV positive cases) and young children not in nursery (53.06%, 156 out of 294 HCoV positive cases). Four HCoVs, as OC43, 229E, NL63 and HKU1 were detected prevalent during 2010-2015 in Guangzhou, and among the HCoV positive cases, 60.20% were OC43, 16.67% were 229E, 14.97% were NL63 and 7.82% were HKU1. The month distribution showed that totally HCoV was prevalent in winter, but differences existed in different species. The 5 year distribution of HCoV showed a peak-valley distribution trend, with the detection rate higher in 2011 and 2013 whereas lower in 2010, 2012 and 2014. The age distribution revealed that children (especially those <3 years old) and old people (>50 years) were both high risk groups to be infected by HCoV. Of the 294 HCoV positive patients, 34.69% (101 cases) were co-infected by other common respiratory viruses, and influenza virus was the most common co-infecting virus (30/101, 29.70%).

Among the patients, 38 .45% (5017) were infants and toddlers younger than 3 years of age (0-35 months). Specimens were only taken from individuals with 3 days of fever (temperature !37.5\u02daC), and with cough, sputum, throat sore, dyspnea and/or other acute respiratory tract infection symptoms. There were 7974 male (61.11%) and 5074 female (38.89%) patients. Male to female ratio of the patients was 1.57:1. Inpatient cases were 8518, and outpatient/ emergency cases were 4530 (see Table 1 ). Hospitalized to emergency ratio was 1.88:1. Demographic, epidemiology and clinical information including case history, symptoms, physical signs and clinical examination results were collected using a standardized questionnaire.

Totally 2524 nt of OC43 S gene were successfully amplified and sequenced. Bovine CoV (accession no. U00735) was used as outgroup sequence, which was not displayed in the figure. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the 15 strains could be divided into 2 clusters, and 12 strains of which were most related to the strain from France (GI: 721684923), and the remaining 3 strains were most related to the strains from Beijing (GI: 744516692) and France (GI: 721684917), as shown in Fig 6A. Because in the phylogenetic tree of S gene, these 12 strains formed a separate cluster, distant from the other 3 strains, we further analyzed the genotype of these 12 strains. Eighteen other S gene sequences of OC43 were used as reference strains, including ATCC-VR759 (AY585229, AY585228 and NC005147) as genotype A reference, BE-03 (AY903459) as genotype B reference, HK04-01 (JN129834) as genotype C reference, HK04-02 (JN129835) and OC43 BE-04 (AY903460) as genotype D reference, KF572812 as genotype E reference, and Malaysia strains KX538973 (MY-U868/12) and KX538970 (MY-U710/12) as genotype F and G reference, respectively. It was shown that these distinct 12 strains were more close to the novel genotype G (Fig 6B) , whereas the other 3 strains were close to genotype B.

Therefore, the surveillance of coronavirus in humans as well as in animals is very necessary and important for HCoV variation research and infection control. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is very limited report of HCoVs molecular epidemiology in Guangzhou and the variation report about HCoV is few.

Totally 39.29% of the patients were detected as positive for at least one of the 8 respiratory viruses. The detection rates, age and month distributions of Influenza, PIV, RSV, HMPV, HRV, AdV and HBoV were consistent with our previous studies and other reports (Figs 1 and 2) [14, 25, 29] . HCoV was detected in 2.25% (294 positive) patients with respiratory infection symptoms, with the detection rate as 2.95% of inpatients and 0.95% of outpatients. The detection rate was significantly higher in inpatient than outpatient (P<0.01), including adult and children (P<0.05), and the detection rate was especially higher in infant inpatients (Table 1) , and the odds of HCoV infection resulting in admission or severe disease were 3.17, showing that HCoV infection is dangerous especially for infants and toddlers. Real-time RT-PCR was used for HCoVs detection, to increase the sensitivity and avoid cross contamination and false positive. The higher sensitivity of real-time PCR method may contribute to the higher detection rate of HCoV in our study compared with Jinan and Hongkong that used traditional RT-PCR for HCoV screening [30] [31] [32] , and may be a better method in HCoV surveillance. Nevertheless, because HCoV detection rate varies in different regions and countries [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] , another reason for different detection rates may also lie in region distribution. Totally 4 HCoV species including HCoV-229E, OC43, NL63 and HKU1 were detected during 2010-2015 in Guangzhou, and no SARS and MERS-CoV was detected, confirming that the outbreak of highly pathogenic MERS-CoV in year 2015 in South Korea did not spread to Guangzhou. Of the locally epidemic HCoVs, OC43 was the most commonly detected, followed by 229E and NL63, and HKU1 detection rate was the lowest.",

            "text": "From the monthly distribution and year distribution, we found that HCoV-OC43 is the main prevalent HCoV in Guangzhou during 2010-2015. Different HCoVs showed different epidemic months and seasons (Fig 3 and S1 Fig). OC43 was prevalent throughout the year, whereas 229E was prevalent mainly in winter (especially in February). NL63 was most epidemic in summer and winter, whereas the peak of HKU1 appeared in winter (January and February) and disappeared in September to December. The 5 year distribution of HCoVs (Fig 4) . Similar phenomena could be found in the study of Dare RK et al [36] , but there was only 2 years of data in that study [36] . Therefore, data from continuous of surveillance is very important to reveal the pattern of HCoV epidemiology. Further analysis found that this trend mainly came from OC43 year distribution, and secondly, 229E distribution. However, in 2012 and 2014, when the detection rates of OC43 and 229E were relatively low, the infection rates of NL63 and HKU1 were high, and both of them showed a peak in 2012 (Fig 4) . From the 5 year distribution data, we can see that in Guangzhou the infection rate of HCoV was dramatically increased after 2010, and take on a peak-valley pattern (Fig 4 and Table 4 ). More years of surveillance are needed to confirm this HCoV epidemic pattern in Guangzhou. Similar to RSV, PIV, HMPV and HBoV, HCoVs tend to infect children (Fig 2) [14, 25, 29, [31] [32] [33] [34] . Our results showed that young children not in nursery had the highest risk of HCoV infection (53.06% of the HCoV positive patients). The reason may be that most children <3 years old in China are not in nursery, and they usually stay at home with their family guardians. Since HCoV infection is common in adults and elder people, we deduce that the most of sporadic infection should come from the guardians of those young children, and therefore protective measures for children guardians are very important for HCoV prevention and control. From the age distribution, we found that <15 year old children and >50 year elder people were both high risk groups of HCoV infection, and the risk was particularly higher in infants under 1 year old (Fig 2) , but there were differences between HCoVs. OC43 mainly infected <3 years infants and toddlers, whereas 229E more likely infected elder children of 7-15 years. NL63 more likely infected middle aged adults of 35-50 years, but HKU1 tended to infect elder people of 50-65 years. These epidemiological characteristics may help to understand the pathogenicity of HCoV and prevent HCoV infection.",

HCoV-OC43 belongs to\u03b2-genera of coronavirus, the same genera also includes high pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [1] [2] [11] [12] 37] . In this study, HCoV-OC43 was selected for variation analysis for the reason that it was the most prevalent HCoV in Guangzhou during 2010-2015, and it was most variable species among the 4 detected HCoVs [38] [39] [40] . In this study, 15 strains of OC43 from 2013-2014 were chosen for phylogenetic analysis of based on partial S gene sequences. It was shown that the 15 OC43 strains could be divided into 2 clusters, and 12 strains of which were most related to the strain from France (GI: 721684923), and the remaining 3 strains to Beijing (GI: 744516692) and France (GI: 721684917). Because these Epidemiology characteristics of HCoVs and phylogenetic analysis of OC43 during 2010-2015 in Guangzhou 12 strains formed a separate cluster, which was distant from the other 3 strains (Fig 6A) , we further analyzed the genotype of these 12 strains.",

In 2015, a new genotype E was identified which was reported to have arisen due to natural recombination [39] . Recently, 2 new genotypes of OC43 were reported as F and G genotypes in Malaysia [40] , indicating that OC43 were evolving continuously. However, due to the limited availability of HCoV-OC43 sequences, the variation of HCoV-OC43, especially its genotyping, remained to be further elucidated. Therefore, in this study, we analyzed the genotypes based on partial S gene sequences of 15 HCoV-OC43 strains from positive samples during 2013-2014 using PCR amplification and sequencing. We found that 3 strains were closer to genotype B, but the remaining 12 strains were more close to the newly defined genotype G in the phylogenetic trees (Fig 6B) . Recombinant analysis was also performed with negative results, indicating that genotype drift may be one of an important way for HCoV-OC43 to maintain its epidemic. This is for the first time that genotype G is reported to be epidemic as a dominant genotype during 2013-2014 in Guangzhou, south China. The epidemic of genotype G in Guangzhou may be a result of personnel exchange between China and Southeast Asia countries including Malaysia. Further complete genome sequencing will be needed to understand the phylogenic characteristics of these G genotype strains circulating in Guangzhou.",
