IRES elements have been applied as useful tools for bi-cistronic expression vectors. Current RNA structure prediction programs are unable to predict precisely the potential IRES element. We have designed a viral IRES prediction system (VIPS) to perform the IRES secondary structure prediction. In order to obtain better results for the IRES prediction, the VIPS can evaluate and predict for all four different groups of IRESs with a higher accuracy. RNA secondary structure prediction, comparison, and pseudoknot prediction programs were implemented to form the three-stage procedure for the VIPS. The backbone of VIPS includes: the RNAL fold program, aimed to predict local RNA secondary structures by minimum free energy method; the RNA Align program, intended to compare predicted structures; and pknotsRG program, used to calculate the pseudoknot structure. VIPS was evaluated by using UTR database, IRES database and Virus database, and the accuracy rate of VIPS was assessed as 98.53%, 90.80%, 82.36% and 80.41% for IRES groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. This advance useful search approach for IRES structures will facilitate IRES related studies. The VIPS on-line website service is available at http://140.135.61.250/ vips/.",

            "text": "Translation initiation can be described as a scanning model triggered by a cap-and 5' end-dependent mechanism, or can be mediated by a cap-and 5' end-independent manner through an RNA element termed as \"internal ribosomal entry site\" (IRES). The scanning machine recognizes and binds to the methylated 5'-end cap structure of a mRNA and scans linearly downstream until it reaches an AUG codon for the initiation of protein translation [1] . In contrast to the canonical translation initiation, the IRES directs the ribosomal translation due to form specific secondary and tertiary structures that interact directly with the translational machinery. IRES elements were first described in the 5' nontranslated region of mRNAs of the Picornaviridae, which lacks a methylated cap structure at the 5' end [2] . The IRES may have an important role as a virulence factor, in addition, the identification of IRES element of pathogenic viruses is also a key point for the treatment of the viruses-infected diseases. Moreover, the IRES element can be applied in the development of bi-cistronic expression vector, an important tool for the biotechnology. Thus, it is important to develop a bioinformatic tool for the prediction and identification of IRES element(s) in a virus's genome.",

The IRES element prediction might depend on RNA structure similarity because of the functional contraction. The ameliorative RNA structure prediction will therefore be useful to enhance the accuracy of secondary structure prediction of IRES elements. We have developed an IRES search system named IRSS that combined two RNA structure prediction models: comparative sequence analysis, and minimum free energy structure [7] . Comparative sequence analysis has a 97% accuracy of base pairs in ribosomal RNA secondary structures, and minimum free energy (MFE) structure prediction can predict the structure of a single RNA sequence with an average of 73% accuracy [8] . However, comparative sequence analysis is not useful to predict the mRNA regulatory motifs such as IRES [9, 10] .",

From cryo-electron microscopy structure information of HCV IRES, the pseudoknot element might bind to the initiation codon of the mRNA that has attached the binding cleft with the 40S ribosomal subunit [12, 13] . The intergenic region (IGR) IRES of Plautia stali intestine virus contains three pseudoknot structures; two located on 5\u2032-terminal 143 nucleotides for binding of the IGR IRES to the 40S ribosome, and one 3\u2032terminal pseudoknot involved in decoding of the non-AUG codon used for initiation [14] . Thus, the pseudoknot structure might be one of important parameters in determining the IRES elements and might be used to improve the accuracy of IRES prediction. The program, pknotsRG, adopted an algorithm to calculate the thermodynamic stability of pseudoknots, which can predict a restricted class of pseudoknots [15] .",

            "text": "For the RNA structure and sequence comparative tools, many pattern searching programs and web services have been developed, such as Rfam from the Sanger Institute [16] . Rfam adopted multiple RNA sequence alignments using covariance models to represent consensus primary sequences of noncoding RNA families. Moreover, there are twelve IRES models built upon consensus sequences in Rfam database. Unfortunately, the lower homology between different IRES groups will cause inaccuracy of prediction using primary sequences [9, 10] . The RNA structure prediction will therefore be useful to enhance the accuracy of de novo secondary structure prediction of IRES elements. To develop a new IRES search tool which is able to predict all four viral IRES groups, the viral IRES prediction system (VIPS) was constructed and based on secondary structure prediction, structure comparison and pseudoknot structure calculation. In contrast to Rfam, IRSS, the previous prediction system and VIPS will be more specific for IRES prediction [7] . VIPS will scan neighboring regions for structure prediction and avoid short consensus primary sequence problems to improve IRES structure predictions. The VIPS also added pknotsRG that will enhance the accuracy of predicting the IRES structures with regards to the function of pseudoknot binding with 40S ribosome. Previous IRES search system (IRSS) can provide up to 72.3% accuracy of secondary structure prediction for IRES group 2 [7] . The VIPS has higher accuracy than IRSS and is a useful search platform for IRES prediction due to more competent standard IRES elements and parameters of VIPS. The web searching service of VIPS provides a new IRES search tool which can assist in defining the IRES elements. In addition, the VIPS will also provide a useful source for IRES location before experimental study. The VIPS will be a public resource, and can facilitate the scientific community not only to as an analyzing tool, but also as means of communication by providing feedbacks.",

First, RNAL fold program functions to predict the RNA secondary structure using the minimum free energy method [17] . Next, the RNA secondary structure comparison matches the known IRES structures executed by RNA Align program [18] . Finally, the pknotsRG calculates the pseudoknot score from potential IRES structures [15] . In our designed VIPS, the primary RNA sequence input in the search flowchart (see Figure 1 ), with default length parameter (L=250, previous results [7] ), is transferred as a raw RNA sequences into RNAL fold input format by perl scripts (UTR2SQ.pl and utr_dp.pl) (Methods S1) [7] . The Start_analyze.pl is the major control batch program to link each stage of VIPS. In RNA align software, two factors are considered to evaluate the IRES elements that can be predicted by our VIPS, distance score (DIST) and alignment match length (ALEN). DIST represents the score of secondary structure in comparison with the default score of each RNA structure (base-deletion, base-mismatch, arc-mismatch, areremoving, arc-altering and arc-breaking) adopted in RNA align software. Because DIST value will increase concomitantly with longer alignment length, DIST score fails to specify the significance of matched structures from shorter and bigger alignment sequences. Therefore, DIST and ALEN are transformed into a ratio which is defined as R= ALEN/DIST [7] . The R values are collected from all predicted IRES elements including known IRES and potential candidate IRES elements. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) analyzes all R values to make a discriminant line that distinguishes candidate IRES group and non-IRES group. The error rate of VIPS is estimated in comparison of known IRES structures with candidate IRES elements. All parameters were succeeded from our previous IRSS setting [7] . The output data of RNAL fold program is retransformed into RNA Align format by B2RA.pl program (Methods S1). For RNA view, B2CT.pl (Methods S1) changes the predicted RNA secondary structure into \"connect file format\" (*.ct) which will read by RnaViz [19] to display in screen and print. Two output files, Aligned structure and Alignment score files, were generated by RNA Align software. 2 statistical programs, DIST.R and sort.R, were applied to select all predicted RNA structures with R scores higher than best cut-off value [7] . The perl script, run_pknotsRG.pl, re-formats all candidate RNA structure into input format of pknotsRG software (Methods S1). All of the output results of RNA Align and pknotsRG software were evaluated their value by statistic programs. The predicted figure of RNAL fold program and text results of RNA Align and pknotsRG software were showed as web page while their values are higher than cut-off value.",

The standard structures were fetched from four known groups of IRES elements based on Cricket paralysis virus (Group 1, accession number: AF218039), Hepatitis C virus (Group 2, accession number: AF177037), Encephalomyocarditis virus (Group 3, accession number: X74312.1) and Poliovirus (Group 4, accession number: V01148.1). Those standard IRES templates were applied into VIPS to calculate the appropriate individual R value and pseudoknot value from RNAL fold, RNA Align and pknotsRG programs. The R value of VIPS presents a score for match length (ALEN) divided distance score (DIST) that distributes into two separate groups, IRES-candidate group and negative group, when the cut-off value was determined [7] . For positive groups, all verified IRES elements (Table S1 ) of the four viral families (groups 1~4) fetched from NCBI GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and Rfam database (http:// www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Rfam/) were run through VIPS to calculate and classify into four IRES groups.

Current evidences showed that pseudoknots act a key structural role in bringing distant regions of single-stranded RNA together to form core helices that were composed with Watson-Crick base pairs [21] . Pseudoknot structures also regulate IRESs, because pseudoknots have been demonstrated to stimulate the efficiency of translational recoding events that include redefined stop codon and ribosomal frameshifting [22] . In addition, pseudoknot containing transfer-messenger RNA (tmRNA) can rescue stalled ribosomes that reached the 3\u2032 end of an mRNA lacking a termination codon during translation elongation [23] . In viruses, pseudoknots have been identified in a number of IRESs and their function has been proven in the flavivirus HCV and the dicistrovirus cricket paralysis virus (CrPV) [3, 24] . And, HCV IRES domains function synergistically to locate the AUG sequence into the ribosomal peptidyl (P) site that might couple the movement of the pseudoknot with HCV IRES domain 3d. With pseudoknot, false positive values of VIPS prediction are 2.94%, 0.00%, 0.00%, and 1.63%, and false negative values are 0.00%, 18.41%, 35.29%, and 37.56% both for IRES group 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively.",

The accuracy of cellular IRESs prediction is lower than viral IRESs. The results of VIPS analyzed from UTR database, positive group may contain 39 genes related to different catalogs which might have potential IRES elements. According to COG database [25] , those genes containing potential IRES elements can be classified into 18 catalogs. They are 1) translation, ribosomal structure (J, 4.65%); 2) transcription (K, 6.98%); 3) DNA replication, recombination and repair (L, 2.33%); 4) posttranslational modification, protein turnover, chaperones (O, 2.33%); 5) RNA In RNA structure prediction, Rfam provides pattern searching program and web service which was developed by Sanger Institute [16] . Rfam adopts covariance models to estimate consensus primary sequences of non-coding RNA families, thus, Rfam provides information not focus on IRESs. In contrast, VIPS was more specific for IRES study with combination of four well-defined viral RNA models. Thus, VIPS can predict IRESs by structure comparison including pseudoknot which contains neighboring regions for structure prediction to avoid short consensus primary sequence problems that are approached differently by Rfam.",

However, positive group may contain other viruses which might have potential IRES elements. For example, Human rhinovirus C (NC_009996) has high R value (1.74) in 423-626 nucleotides. The pseudoknot function will select more candidate IRES elements for group 4, such as Porcine enterovirus B (data not shown). For group 3, Foot-and-mouth disease virus (NC_004915) and Human cosavirus (NC_012802) are the major families of positive group with pseudoknot function. Without pseudoknot prediction, some of the virus families might lose in the current criteria of VIPS. HCV and Hepatitis GB virus B (NC_001655) occupy major percentage in the positive group of VIPS for IRES group 2. Another ssRNA positive strand virus, Dengue virus (NC_001477), has been discovered as potential IRES element with pseudoknots and has been proven by mutagenesis experiments [26] . Without pseudoknot structure, the sensitivity of VIPS is reduced for IRES group 2 due to HCV structure containing pseudoknot. For IRES group 1, Himetobi P virus (NC_003782) showed the highest percentage in the positive group by VIPS (1.93 with pseudoknot score). Moreover, Diaporthe ambigua RNA virus 1 (NC_001278), 3947-4111 nucleotides, has potential IRES element (R value is 1.60, without pseudoknot). In group 1 prediction, there is no significant difference with pseudoknot function or not. Recent researches suggest that the Dicistroviridae family might have intergenic IRES from bioinformatic evidence [27] which are matched our predictions. Our results demonstrate that VIPS does not only to predict RNA secondary structures, but also locates the IRES elements in the viral genome.",

However, pseudoknot parameter indicates stable pseudoknot structure or not and then is easy to locate short sub-structure. Therefore, pseudoknot parameter with an R-value prevents overestimation of the predicted IRES elements that can also be revealed as false positive results. After evaluation of pseudoknot parameter by four IRES standard elements of VIPS, pseudoknot parameters can cover known IRES structures and also avoid the disadvantages of minimum free energy method (data not showed). However, to improve sensitivity and specificity of cellular IRES elements in VIPS, new algorithms can be implemented to simulate real relationships and interactions between 40s rRNA and IRES elements in next version of our prediction system. The new bioinformatic tool plays a major role in creating databases and finding eukaryotic functional elements such as IRES, iron-responsive elements, splicing regulatory elements.. etc [28] . Therefore, VIPS will be a useful internet resource for IRES elements location before experimental studies. Moreover, it can facilitate the scientific community not only to study IRES using VIPS, but also as means of communication by providing some feedbacks.",
