            "text": "Porcine diarrhea disease in newborn and suckling piglets due to infection with porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a leading cause of economic loss in the pig industry globally. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism of the host innate immune response to PEDV infection. The expression dynamics of antiviral genes (e.g., RIG-1, PKR, OAS1, Mx1, and Mx2) and inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IFN-\u03b1, in porcine small intestinal epithelial (IPEC-J2) cells were analyzed following PEDV stimulation. The results showed that the expression of antiviral genes (e.g., PKR, OAS1, and Mx2) and inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IFN-\u03b1 and TNF-\u03b1) were significantly reduced within 0-4 h post-infection (P < 0.05). However, all antiviral genes and inflammatory cytokines were up-regulated from 12 to 24 h (P < 0.05), and cytopathic changes were observed during this time. The expression of RIG-1, PKR, OAS1, Mx1, and Mx2 were significantly and positively correlated to each other during the entire infection (P < 0.01). The results suggested that the RIG-1, PKR, OAS1, Mx1, and Mx2 genes may play an important role in PEDV infection in piglets. Initially, PEDV displayed cellular invasion by inhibiting IFN-\u03b1 transcription and interfering with the antiviral function of PKR, OAS1, and Mx2, ultimately induced an intense inflammatory response. The relationship between antiviral genes and inflammatory cytokines with PEDV infection at the cellular level provides a reference for studying the mechanism of resistance to PEDV infection in piglets.",

PED was first discovered in the United Kingdom in 1971 and successively erupted in Europe, Asia, America, and other regions within the next 40 years (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) . Moreover, PED has become an important epidemic that restricts the development of the pig industry, causing serious economic losses. Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is the causative agent of PED, which was discovered and termed, CV777, in 1978 (6) . PEDV invades the digestive system of pigs through the nose and mouth, targeting, and residing in the porcine small intestinal epithelial cells. PEDV subsequently destroys the mucosal immune barrier of the small intestine, finally causing watery diarrhea, dehydration, and vomiting in piglets. The morbidity and mortality of newborn and suckling piglets reach 100% (7) . Currently, the control measures for PED mainly include the vaccination of pregnant sows; however, neither attenuated nor inactivated vaccines have been significantly effective in practice (8, 9) .",

RIG-I activation induces the production of type I interferon (IFN-I) to regulate the expression of a series of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) that stimulate target cells to produce specific antiviral proteins (e.g., double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase [PKR], 2-5 \u2032 oligoadenylate synthase 1 [OAS1], and myxovirus resistance proteins [Mx]) (10) (11) (12) . Proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., tumor necrosis factor [TNF-\u03b1] and interleukin 6 [IL-6]) are also produced to mediate various inflammatory responses and exert antiviral effects (13) . Therefore, further exploration of the host innate immune response following PEDV infection can provide a theoretical basis for the study of piglet resistance to PEDV infection.",

A systematic understanding of the interaction between PEDV and innate immunity can provide us with new strategies for the preventive treatment of PED. PEDV is positive sense single-stranded RNA virus coated with a capsid for which the pathogenesis is associated with the binding of the S1 subunit region of the virus-encoded S protein to the receptor gene (APN) expressed on porcine small intestinal epithelial cells (15) . Then PEDV enters the host cell via membrane fusion, and begins to replicate and proliferate in the host cell, producing double-strained RNA (dsRNA) (16) . Studies have shown that RIG-1 is a receptor that recognizes viral dsRNA in the cytoplasm (17) . Moreover, RIG-1-like receptors (RLRs) bind to viral dsRNA by recognizing pathogen-related molecular patterns. In addition, the N-terminal CARD structure of RLRs can interact with the downstream adaptor protein, IPS-1, to activate the downstream TANK-binding kinases, TBK1 and IKK\u03b5, activate the transcription factor, NF-\u03baB, and IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) to induce type 1 IFN production (10, 11) . At present, substantial progress has been made in the study of PEDV-mediated antagonization of the natural innate immune response. There are two main viral escape mechanisms:",

            "text": "When IFN-I (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2) is secreted extracellularly through various methods, it binds to IFNAR1/2 and activates the Janus kinases/Signal transducers and activators of transcription (Jak/Stat) signaling pathway, which in turn induces transcriptional activation of ISGs. ISGs are effector molecules that mediate cellular innate immune responses to viral infections, including PKR, OAS1, Mx1, and Mx2. PKR is a serine/threonine protein kinase that can be activated by dsRNA produced by viral replication, which can inactive the eukaryotic translation initiation factor, eIF-2\u03b1, resulting in blocking the entry of viral or host mRNA into the ribosome to form the initiation complex (21) . OAS1 is an interferon-induced antiviral protease that can recognize dsRNA and activate endonuclease (RNaseL), to degrade both viral mRNA and cellular RNA (22) . Studies have shown that porcine OAS1 can effectively inhibit the infectious activity of Japanese encephalitis virus, pseudorabies virus, and porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus (23) . Mx protein is induced by IFN-I and IFN-II and is associated with intracellular vesicle transportation and intracellular homeostasis. Moreover, it exhibits extensive anti-RNA virus activity. Sun et al. successfully constructed an Mx1 or Mx2 over-expressing monkey kidney epithelial cell line, MARC-145, and found that both could effectively inhibit the replication of PEDV, albeit Mx2 displays a stronger anti-PEDV activity compared to Mx1 (24) . Our study found that the levels of PKR, OAS1, and Mx2 expression decreased at 0-4 h after the attack, indicating that PEDV may interfere with antiviral gene expression and inhibit the cellular innate immune response. The expression of PKR, OAS1, Mx1, and Mx2 peaked at 24 h. In addition, in IPEC-J2 cells infected with PEDV, the expressions of the RIG-1, PKR, OAS1, Mx1, and Mx2 genes were significantly and positively correlated to each other, likely because these genes are induced through the Jak/Stat signaling pathway, and their expression profiles are simulations similar in response to invasion of the same virus (25) . Thus, our findings suggested that these five antiviral genes interacted to regulate PEDV infection.",

Therefore, research based on proinflammatory cytokines is helpful for clarifying the pathogenesis of diseases and the associated host immune mechanisms against infection (26) . IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 have antiviral, antitumor, antiparasitic, and immune regulatory effects. TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-12 are important cytokines involved in the immune response and mediating the inflammatory response (13) . In this study, the levels of proinflammatory cytokine transcriptions were monitored and the cytopathic conditions were also observed to explore the immune status of the cells following viral infection. The results showed that no obvious lesions were observed in the cells at 4 h after infection, and there was no significant difference in the expressions of other inflammatory factors, except IL-12 at this time point. The expressions of IFN-\u03b1 and TNF-\u03b1 were also inhibited, indicating that the cellular inflammatory reaction was minor at this time point. At 12 h post-infection, the cells began to shrink and the lesions were evident. At 24 h, the cellular pathological changes were the most severe. In addition, the levels of inflammatory factor transcriptions increased continuously from 12 to 24 h after infection, and the expression levels peaked at 24 h, indicating that the inflammatory reaction of the cells was the most intense at this time point.",

In the present study, we found that the expression of antiviral genes (e.g., PKR, OAS1, and Mx2) and inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IFN-\u03b1 and TNF-\u03b1) were significantly reduced within 0-4 h post-infection. However, all antiviral genes and inflammatory cytokines were up-regulated from 12 to 24 h, and cytopathic changes were observed during this period. These results suggested that the expressions of the antiviral genes and inflammatory cytokines are positively correlated with the severity of the cytopathic effect following PEDV infection of IPEC-J2 cells. Activation of these genes might be a hallmark of PEDV infection.",

Our future research will involve constructing an antiviral gene overexpressing or knock-out IPEC-J2 cell line, and evaluating its resistance to PEDV.
