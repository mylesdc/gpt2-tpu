            "text": "It is now established that post-natal and adult lungs contain multiple progenitors or stem cell populations able to participate to organ homeostasis and repair [1] . The relative distribution of these populations varies between species [2, 3] and these cells are difficult to evidence as the consequence of the low turn-over of the respiratory epithelium [4] . The mouse system allowing the study of cell regeneration in response to chemical injury and more recently in vivo genetic lineage tracing [5, 6] has supplied a model to explore and describe epithelial lineages implicated in lung repair. Even so the murine pulmonary epithelium is rather different from the ones of the large mammals. In small mammals such as rodents, the proximal airways are composed of a layer comprising one or two cells thick that rests on a very sparse network of basal cells [7] [8] [9] [10] . In large mammals, this epithelium is characterized by pseudo-stratified columnar cells together with ciliated, secretory, and parabasal cells linked to a foundation of basal cells [11, 12] . Moreover club cells, formerly named Clara cells [13] [14] [15] are present throughout the mouse airways while confined to the most distal bronchiolar airways in humans. Regeneration of alveolar tissue is rapid and efficient in rodents, but takes longer and needs higher level of stimulation in large mammals [16] . Taking in account these observed differences on composition and temporal dynamics, the description of the resident progenitor populations is of importance in large mammals to better understand the building, maintenance and repair of the lung epithelium. Moreover, sheep have a long history as an experimental model to study respiratory diseases. These small ruminants have been proposed as good candidates for vaccine development as well as for comprehensive studies on asthma, bronchial obstruction or infant respiratory distress syndrome. It also provides a very useful model for respiratory infections and lung cancer.",

The bronchioloalveolar region has been extensively studied in normal and injured lungs of rats and mice in response to chemical treatments. Undifferentiated cells in the bronchioloalveolar duct junction have been histologically identified as different from the alveolar epithelial type II cells (AECII), the club cells (Clara) or the ciliated cells [17] . In mice, these bronchioloalveolar progenitors, referred as BASCs (BronchioloAlveolar Stem Cells), share phenotypic characteristics of both club cells and AECIIs, suggesting a niche of progenitors [2, [17] [18] [19] [20] . They express CCSP (Club Cell Secretory Protein) specific of the club cells, SP-C (Surfactant Protein C), a component of the pulmonary surfactant produced by the AECII as well as CD34, a surface antigen of the hematopoietic stem cells [18, 21] . Murine BASCs appear to be resistant to bronchiolar and alveolar damage in vivo, proliferate during epithelial repair and have the potential to give rise to club cells and AECIs or AECIIs [18, 21] . Whether analogous pulmonary epithelial progenitors are present and could differentiate into specialized bronchiolar or alveolar cells in large animals is currently unknown.",

AECIIs were easily detectable in most of the sections due to their high expression of SP-C ( Figure 1B ) and club cells expressing CCSP were detectable when bronchioli were present on the lung section. Interestingly, rare SP-C pos /CCSP pos cells were observed in some lung sections ( Figure 1B) , demonstrating the presence of bronchioloalveolar progenitors in newborn lambs. Among the 4 independent lungs and repeated immunostainings, the SP-C pos /CCSP pos cells remained rare and only present on few lung sections.

Based on the dot plot analysis from a representative lamb ( Figure 1C ) and the compiled data from 10 lambs ( Figure 1D ), the suspensions of lung cells repeatedly contained 40% (\u00b1 18.5) SP-C pos cells and 0.65% (\u00b1 0.60) CCSP pos cells ( Figure 1D ). Co-expression of SP-C/CCSP was then analyzed to quantify the bronchioloalveolar progenitors. An average of 0.33% (\u00b1 0.31) of the total cells co-expressed the two markers and presented an immunophenotype compatible with lung progenitors ( Figure 1D ). We noted the low percentage of club cells in the cell suspensions issued from tissue dissociation. This may be attributed to our tissue processing. In order to work mainly with the cell populations present into the lung parenchyma, we carefully have macro-dissected the lung tissues before enzymatic digestion in order to limit cells coming from the bronchi and bronchioli. Moreover, the number of club cells in the lung of large mammals is lower compared to rodents.",

However, the large proportion of SP-C pos /CD34 pos and CCSP pos /CD34 pos cells clearly demonstrated that most of the CD34 pos cells were SP-C pos /CCSP pos progenitors. The proportion of SP-C pos /CCSP pos cells among the CD34 pos population was similar in the 6 lambs analyzed independently ( Figure 4B ). Importantly, the proportion of CD34 neg / SP-C pos and CD34 neg /CCSP pos cells was very low to undetectable in the CD34-sorted cell suspension (1.0% \u00b1 1.7 and 1.1% \u00b1 1.8, respectively), confirming that the procedure efficiently purified CD34 pos cells and not AECIIs or club cells.

Interestingly, NANOG was almost absent from the unsorted population but was strongly expressed in the CD34 possorted cells ( Figure 4C ). Importantly, the expression of SP-C, CCSP and CD34 was maintained after CD34 selection ( Figure 4C ).

Indeed, using synthetic medium and adapted cell culture conditions, CD34 pos / SP-C pos /CCSP pos bronchioloalveolar progenitors had the potential to differentiate into either AECIIs or club cells. To induce the differentiation of SP-C pos /CCSP pos cells into AECIIs, CD34 pos cells were seeded onto plates coated with fibronectin and type I and IV collagens and cultured with \"complete Q286 medium\", culture conditions that we defined as \"AECII conditions\". Along 3 passages (approximately 45 days), we observed a noticeable increase of the proportion of cell expressing SP-C pos /CCSP neg ( Figure 5A and B), whereas the SP-C pos / CCSP pos population decreased over time ( Figure 5C ). Cultures from 6 independent animals showed the same modulation with an increasing proportion of SP-C pos / CCSP neg AECIIs (from < 5% to 58%; Figure 5C ). In contrast, the population of SP-C pos /CCSP pos progenitors rapidly decreased throughout the passages from over 90% to less than 30% ( Figure 5C ). Under these conditions, no CCSP pos cells emerged from the initial SP-C pos /CCSP pos population. Because we have previously shown that none to less than 1% (\u00b1 1.7) of the CD34 neg /SP-C pos AECII were present after CD34 positive selection, our findings strongly argue for the in vitro differentiation of bronchioloalveolar progenitors into AECIIs and not the mere proliferation of pre-existing AECIIs. Conversely, CD34 pos progenitors cultured in \"basic Q286 medium\" (without KGF and HGF) on fibronectin- coated plates, conditions that we defined as \"club cell conditions\" gave rise to colonies containing primarily SP-C neg /CCSP pos cells (53.6% \u00b1 13) after 15 days in culture ( Figure 5A , 5B and 5C). Concurrently, SP-C pos / CCSP pos bronchioloalveolar progenitors (24.9% \u00b1 14) rapidly decreased, while SP-C pos /CCSP neg AECIIs remained low to undetectable (5% \u00b1 8; Figure 5C ). Similarly to the AECII conditions, we have previously shown that none to less than 1.1 (\u00b1 1.8%) of the CD34 neg /CCSP pos club cells were present after CD34 positive selection from the 6 tested lambs, strongly suggesting the in vitro differentiation of bronchioloalveolar progenitors into club cells. Together with the low proliferation rate of CCSP pos cells in the cultures, our findings strongly argue for the differentiation of bronchioloalveolar progenitors into club cells rather than the proliferation of already existing club cells in the cultures.",

In the differentiation conditions that generated AECIIs or club cells, OCT4 expression was strongly reduced in 2 of the 3 lambs.

            "text": "In this study, we described the presence of SP-C pos / CCSP pos progenitors in the lung parenchyma of 0-3 month-old lambs. These rare cells (~0.3% of the pulmonary epithelial cells) have been isolated after tissue dissociation and they co-expressed CD34, SP-C and CCSP. The SP-C pos /CCSP pos cells were maintained in vitro for up to 2 or 3 passages (30-45 days). Pluripotent progenitors are defined by their ability to maintain and differentiate upon exposure to specific stimuli. To further characterize the ovine SP-C pos /CCSP pos cells, we first performed positive selection for CD34 expression, a surface protein widely described on various stem cells and present on ovine hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells [23] . A small population of cells (few thousand) was isolated and characterized as SP-C pos / CCSP pos cells. They expressed mRNAs for the NANOG, OCT4 and BMI1 genes which are molecular markers of stem cells/progenitors. They retained the expression of SP-C, CCSP and CD34 mRNAs over time. Importantly, the CD34 pos /SP-C pos /CCSP pos cells were able to maintain for up to 3 passages in vitro. The CD34 pos /SP-C pos /CCSP pos cell population retained the potential to differentiate at least into AECIIs or club cells in specific culture conditions. The CD34 pos /SP-C pos /CCSP pos cells, maintained in vitro, expressed OCT4 and BMI1 mRNAs, conferring them characteristics inherent to multipotent cells or progenitors. Bronchioloalveolar progenitors have been reported in mice in an anatomically well-defined location at the bronchioloalveolar junction where conducting and respiratory airways meet [18, 24, 25] . These cells were initially described by their expression of Sca-1 and CD34, and their co-expression of SP-C and CCSP. We succeeded in demonstrating the in vivo presence of rare ovine bronchioloalveolar progenitors in the lungs of newborn or young animals (less than 3 months old), while other groups have difficulties to identify bronchioloalveolar progenitors in sheep upon searching for these cells using CCSP and SP-C immunostaining on lung sections [26, 27] . Interestingly, two studies have reported rare to extremely rare SP-C pos /CCSP pos cells in virally-induced lung tumors in sheep [26, 28] . Taken together, these results are consistent with the presence of SP-C pos /CCSP pos cell population, extremely rare in vivo on frozen lung sections and representing a new progenitor population. The discrepancy between our study and previous studies [26, 27] may be explained by the low but clearly above background levels of SP-C and CCSP expression in double-positive cells compared to the expression of these markers in AECIIs and club cells, respectively. Moreover, a recent study on ovine lung sections, have shown that CCSP pos cells were not (preterm lung) or poorly (9 days old lung) detectable in prenatal and early postnatal lung compared to mature lung (91 days) in bronchi, terminal bronchioles and respiratory bronchiole [29] . These elements point the influence of the age of the lung studied, in the search for postnatal bronchioloalveolar CCSP pos /SP-C pos progenitors.",

In addition, bronchioloalveolar progenitors may be more easily identified in lungs from newborn lambs. Of note, we have previously reported the presence of SP-C pos /CCSP pos cells in the sheep lung while describing the ex vivo isolation of tumoral AECIIs from a virus-induced lepidic lung adenocarcinoma [22] . While culturing these cells in three-dimensional conditions, better adapted to these polarized and specialized cells, we repeatedly observed SP-C pos /CCSP pos doublepositive cells (data not shown). These results prompted us to go further into their characterization. SP-C pos /CCSP pos double-positive bronchioloalveolar progenitors are rare and represent less than 0.4% of the total epithelial cells from dissociated lungs. In comparison, a recent study has established that undifferentiated human stem cells identified by c-kit immunosorting are present at a frequency of 1 per 6,000 cells in the bronchioles and 1 per 30,000 cells in the alveoli in adults [30] . In fetal human lung tissue at 12-36 weeks of gestation, the frequency of stem cells varies from 1 per 11,000 to 1 per 600 cells, with an average of 1 per 4,100 cells [30] . Our CD34-positive selection procedure was crucial to isolate bronchioloalveolar progenitors from the lung even though the absolute number of CD34 pos / SP-C pos /CCSP pos cells was ultimately low (only a few thousands cells) and confirmed the existence of a rare population of SP-C pos /CCSP pos bronchioloalveolar progenitors. Importantly, all of the selection steps were performed ex vivo, without any cell culture steps and in the absence of fetal calf serum known to induce cell differentiation.",

BMI1 is a member of the PcG family of transcription repressors that play crucial roles in development, stem cell biology and cancer [31] . BMI1 is also highly expressed in tumors and regulates the cell fate of cancer cells and normal and tumoral stem cells [32, 33] . BMI1 participates in the maintenance of endogenous stem cells, partly by repressing genes involved in cell death and senescence [34] . In mice, BMI1 is necessary for bronchioloalveolar stem cells expansion [35] . Similarly to murine bronchioloalveolar stem cells, ovine bronchioloalveolar progenitors expressed BMI1 under maintenance/self-renewing conditions, and this expression was not modified by exposure to differentiation conditions. While OCT4, a member of the POU (Pit-Oct-Unc) transcription factor family, is essential for the maintenance of self-renewal capacities, NANOG (a downstream target of OCT4) contributes to the cell fate determination of pluripotent cells during embryogenesis [36, 37] . OCT4 and NANOG are among the few key factors that enable the reprogramming of adult somatic cells into pluripotent stem cells [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] . Interestingly, induced pluripotent cells (iPSCs) generated from sheep fibroblasts have recently been demonstrated to exhibit an embryonic stem cell-like morphology and to express OCT4 and NANOG among other intracellular and surface markers associated with undifferentiated cells, as previously demonstrated in humans and mice [43] . The level of OCT4 is critical for the state of a cell and its inactivation results in the loss of pluripotency and induces differentiation [44] . We could observe a loss or reduction of OCT4 gene expression in AECII and club cells compared to progenitors. OCT4 and NANOG are expressed in lung stem cells, and their co-expression may enhance malignancy by inducing cancer stem cell-like properties [45, 46] . Surprisingly, NANOG gene expression was higher in AECII and club cells than in progenitors in our in vitro culture conditions. NANOG expression is known to be regulated by a number of pluripotent transcription factors (FoxD3, SOX2, OCT4) [47] . It is likely that this complex regulation is also dependent of the in vitro context (growth factors, monolayer or 2D culture conditions) and others active signaling cascades [48] . With respect to the recently described human c-kit lung stem cell [30] , it would be interesting to study the expression of c-kit in lamb lung sections and in the SP-C pos /CCSP pos bronchioloalveolar progenitors population to better understand the hierarchical organization of these progenitors in this complex tissue.",

While extremely rare, these cells can be purified and enriched from the lungs of newborn lambs. These cells have a potential to maintain and differentiate in highly specialized epithelial cells. The SP-C pos /CCSP pos bronchioloalveolar progenitors express progenitor markers, such as the NANOG, BMI1 and OCT4 genes, in vivo and in vitro, indicating that newborn lung progenitors retain characteristics typical of progenitors residing in the developing organ. Although dealing with a limited number of cells, these data enable the study of the development of the bronchiolar and alveolar epithelia. Sheep, an alternative animal model closer to humans than mice, are already largely used to study lung physiology and pathology. In this context, ovine bronchioloalveolar progenitors may represent new tools to study lung regeneration or new therapeutic targets.",
