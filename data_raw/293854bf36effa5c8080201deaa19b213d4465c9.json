Primary care doctors were randomized to mask wearing and non mask wearing clinical consultations in public primary care clinics in Hong Kong.

The effects of face mask wearing were investigated using multilevel (hierarchical) modelling.",

A significant and negative effect was found in the patients' perception of the doctors' empathy (CARE score reduction \u22120.98, p-value = 0.04). In the more established doctor-patient relationship, the effect of doctors' mask wearing was more pronounced (CARE score reduction \u22125.67, p-value = 0.03). Conclusion: This study demonstrates that when doctors wearing a facemask during consultations, this has a significant negative impact on the patient's perceived empathy and diminish the positive effects of relational continuity. Consideration should be taken in planning appropriate use of facemasks in infectious disease policy for primary care and other healthcare professionals at a national, local or practice level.",

A facemask is a loose fitting disposable device covering the wearer's nose and mouth and acts as a physical barrier to potential contaminants in the immediate environment but can have limited effectiveness in blocking small particles. There is little proven benefit in the sole use of facemask (without hand washing) to prevent healthcare personnel from contracting infections in randomized control trials [1] [2] [3] , with research conducted during the SARS outbreak suggesting a potential negative impact of infection precaution measures including mask wearing, on the domain of doctors' empathy of a patient satisfaction questionnaire [4] .",

It has been shown that nonverbal communication is important for the therapeutic relationship [11] and is related to patients' adherence to medical advice and medication compliance, patient satisfaction and positive clinical outcomes [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . The importance of emotional perception, expression and reciprocity in non verbal communication was postulated to impact the outcome of the doctor-patient interaction [11] . Studies in non clinical contexts have shown that subliminal facial expressions can influence the viewer's emotional state, attitudes and subsequent behaviours [17, 18] . However, only a few studies have looked at the influence of facial expressions on patient health outcomes [14, 19] ; eye contact was a strong predictor of a positively rated doctor patient interaction [19] , whilst doctors' distancing behaviour, such as not smiling and looking away was perceived negatively by patients [14] . During hospital admissions, facial expressiveness (such as smiling, nodding, frowning) of physical therapists were associated with an improvement in ability to perform activities of daily living and also a decrease in confusion for elderly patients [14] .",

Studies have demonstrated the impact of doctors' empathy and patient centred care on patient enablement [22] and health outcomes [6, 23] in both chronic and acute conditions [24] [25] [26] [27] . In this study, a randomized control trial was conducted to explore the effects of facemask wearing among primary care doctors in Hong Kong on patients' perception of the doctors' empathy. We hypothesized that patients who consulted mask wearing doctors would report lower scores in doctors' empathy when compared to non mask wearing doctors, due to physical obstruction of facial expressions and the subsequent impact on the perceived empathic response. We also explored the effects of facemask wearing on patient enablement and patient satisfaction. In addition, we hypothesized that the effect of facemask wearing is minimal when the patient knows the doctor well and there is an established therapeutic rapport.",

[27] [28] [29] which has undergone extensive validation. The Chinese version of the CARE measure has been found to be a reliable and valid tool to assess patientrated empathy of doctors during consultation [30, 31] and have been shown to be able to effectively differentiate between doctors in terms of patient-rated empathy [30] . Patients rated the ten questions in the CARE measures with score of 1 for 'poor' and 5 for 'excellent' to the questions, such as 'How was the doctor at making you feel at ease (item 1)'. The total CARE is calculated as an average mean item score multiplied by 10 (and can range from 10 to 50) [31] . Secondary outcome measures were: 1) patient satisfaction, in which patients rated their overall satisfaction with the doctor-patient interaction on a 7-point likert scale (1 = worst, 7 = excellent); 2) patient enablement, by use of the six-item patient enablement instrument (PEI) which measured the impact of patient doctor encounter on the patient's ability to cope with and understand his/ her illness [32] of which the Chinese version has been shown to have good validity and reliability [33] . Rating is on a 3-point scale (same or less/better/much better) and scored as 0, 1, 2. Total PEI score is calculated by the average of the scores of the applicable items multiplied by six [31] . Cases that had more than three 'non applicable' items were excluded [33] . Thus total PEI score ranges from the lowest 0 score to the highest 12 score.",

The effect of facemask wearing among patients who did not know his/her doctor well was minor and did not reach significance (CARE score reduction \u22120.75, p-value = 0.08). However, the positive effect of \"knowing the doctor\" (+6.94) on CARE score estimate was greatly diminished when the doctor wore a facemask with a reduction in CARE score estimate of 5.67 (Total mask effect on CARE score = \u22120.76-4.91 = \u22125.67, p-value = 0.03). Thus the CARE score estimate of 42.58 when the patient knows the doctor well is reduced to 36.91 (13.3% drop) when the doctor wore a facemask. The random effect of doctors was assumed to be normally distributed with mean 0. The variances are estimated and presented in Table 3 . The variability of CARE score could only partly be explained by clustering effect of doctors: estimated variance component of the between doctor random effect were 5.86 with an intraclasscorrelation of 0.11. The model with the added interaction has approximate same estimates (variance component = 5.81, intraclass-correlation = 0.11).",

As patient expectations contributes greatly to the rating of patient satisfaction, facemask wearing appears to have neither a positive nor negative effect on patient satisfaction, which may reflect, in part cultural tolerance to mask wearing following the SARS epidemic in 2003 and the widespread use of facemasks in health care settings. Patient enablement was poor in both groups (PEI mean score 2.6, maximum 12) and similar to primary care patients in the UK (PEI mean score 3) [22] . Contrary to our hypothesis that established relational continuity and \"knowing the doctor well\" would be protective measures to the negative effects of mask wearing, it was in these groups of patients that the effects were more pronounced. \"Knowing the doctor well\" does have a marked positive effect on the CARE score, but this effect is almost mitigated when the doctors wore a facemask. The 5.67 drop in CARE score measure is likely to be clinically significant, as a 5 point drop in CARE score in the original study in the UK was able to differentiate between significantly below average doctors and significantly above average doctors [29] .",

In addition, further studies to look into the role of facial expressions and micro-expressions, and the effect of concealment of expressions in emotional exchange in communication, may be particularly relevant in some cultures requiring veiling of the face (e.g., burka in muslim women) or clinical situations where empathy is essential (e.g., palliative care).",

Meanwhile, a negative impact on the patient's perceived empathy and relational continuity can reduce potential therapeutic effects such as decreased depression, improved immune response, improved quality of life and improved health outcomes [36, 37] . In some countries and clinical institutions where facemask wearing has become mandatory and universal, review of current policies may be warranted in light of our current findings. For countries in which wearing facemasks is uncommon, care must be taken in conveying effective infection risk advice to healthcare professionals and caution in adopting guidelines regarding universal mask use (e.g., flu epidemics) particularly for medical physicians or other healthcare professionals where optimization of the therapeutic relationship is essential.",
