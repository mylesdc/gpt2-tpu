Macrophages, important cells of innate immunity, are directly involved in cellular interactions with pathogens, the release of cytokines activating other immune cells and antigen presentation to cells of the adaptive immune response. IFN\u03b3 is a potent activator of macrophages and increased production has been associated with disease resistance in several species. This study characterizes the molecular basis for dramatically different nitric oxide production and immune function between the B2 and the B19 haplotype chicken macrophages.A large-scale RNA sequencing approach was employed to sequence the RNA of purified macrophages from each haplotype group (B2 vs. B19) during differentiation and after stimulation. Our results demonstrate that a large number of genes exhibit divergent expression between B2 and B19 haplotype cells both prior and after stimulation. These differences in gene expression appear to be regulated by complex epigenetic mechanisms that need further investigation.

Cytokine production, specifically secretion of pro-inflammatory molecules, has also been associated with increased resistance against disease [3, 4] .",

B2 haplotype chickens are more resistant to avian coronavirus infection than B19 haplotypes and these differences in disease resistance were observed early after infection in our previous studies [10] . This suggests that innate immunity plays a major role with the macrophage being a key player in this enhanced immune response as evidenced by the B2 haplotype birds' greater capability to produce nitric oxide (NO) in response to IFN\u03b3 and Poly I:C [13] . In addition, B2 macrophages activated T cells more efficiently than macrophages derived from B19 haplotypes [14] .",

In addition, macrophages release cytokines activating other immune cells and antigen presentation to cells of the adaptive immune response [21] [22] [23] . It has become increasingly clear that dysregulation of macrophage function is involved in inflammatory disease processes such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and cancer [24] [25] [26] . Involved in these interactions are crucial molecules such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) that recognize invading microorganisms, resulting in communication with the adaptive immune system such as increased expression of MHC surface molecules, T cell receptors and secreted cytokines [21, 23] . Genetic differences in any of those molecules can potentially account for differences in immune competence and thus provide potential immunogenetic markers for disease resistance to various pathogens.",

The aligned reads generated by Bowtie produced gapped alignments on the reference genome which Tophat used to identify splice junctions flanking exons. The resulting aligned reads were analyzed by Cufflinks to construct transcripts corresponding to mRNA sequences. Next, Cufflinks was employed to estimate transcript specific expression levels across the transcripts and genes within the reference genome based on the number of sequence reads for each mRNA. The sequence read data was normalized using the fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads (FPKM) method to more accurately determine expression levels.

For visualization purposes, the heat maps were generated with maximum heat map color assigned to expression set lower than the absolute maximum expression value contained in the entire data set, subsequently all values of expression greater than or equal to the assigned expression threshold (for example, 1000) shared the same color on the heat map (regardless of whether the actual expression level  was 1000, 2000, 20,000 or 90,000) . This setting provided the optimal visualization of both high and low expressed genes in the heat maps.

The analysis was performed using comparisons of successive time points within the B2 haplotype data to identify sets of genes that were enriched (p-value < 0.05). The B2 haplotype represents the robust macrophage phenotype as characterized by nitric oxide production compared to the B19 haplotype. Subsequently, the gene enrichment was performed on the B2 data. Gene enrichment was determined using three distinct databases: gene ontology biological process, KEGG pathways, and reactome pathways corresponding to S2, S3 and S4 Tables respectively. Because a large number of enrichment annotation terms were produced, a subset of representative highlights from each of these three enrichment analyses was chosen for inclusion in the results.

Members of the TRIM (tripartite motif) family have been implicated in antiviral immune defense and several are ubiquitin ligases [47, 48] . TPN (Tapasin) is a co-factor for MHC I critical for antigen presentation to cytotoxic T-cells and chickens express the single MHCI locus termed BF-2 which is working with TPN in antigen presentation and it has been shown that there are differences in the selection of high affinity peptides in B19 vs B15 haplotypes [49] highlighting their critical role in immune competence. Additional genes within the B-locus display a similar pattern of pre-stimulatory differences in gene expression between the two different haplotypes, including genes involved in differentiation, cell growth and apoptosis such as PTPN2 (tyrosine protein phosphatase non-receptor2) and NFKB. Gene expression decreases to approximately baseline levels by time point t0 hours. A second distinction in the gene expression patterns between B19 and B2 cells is that B2 cells exhibited a fairly robust expression at 2 and 4 hours after interferon stimulation. Unlike the B2 haplotype, the B19 haplotype appears incapable of generating such a rapid, robust and coherent gene expression profile. In contrast, the B19 cells generate a delayed, weak and uncoordinated lower level of expression that extends up to 8 hours, and in some cases even 16 Distinct temporal gene expression patterns in B2 versus B19 monocytes/macrophages. B-locus haplotypes in chickens provide a mechanism for genetically perturbing the cluster of immunologically important genes on chromosome 16 and producing phenotypic variation affecting infectious disease susceptibility and resistance. The heat map allows visualization of gene expression between the two genetically distinct haplotypes. Each row represents a gene within the B-locus (listed on the right) and each column corresponds to a particular time point when cells were collected for RNA sequencing. Black pixels indicate zero gene expression for a particular gene at a specific point in time, and dark blue corresponds to very low expression, while brighter blue indicates the next higher levels. Dark purple represents higher expression levels than blue colors, and pink represents the highest levels of gene expression. Monocytes were obtained from each haplotype of chicken and allowed to differentiate into macrophages in vitro for seven, days beginning on day minus 6 (t-6). RNA was sampled on day t-6, day t-3, and again three days later which is denoted as 0 hours (t0), when IFN\u03b3 was initially added to the cultures. On t0, RNA was sampled immediately before stimulation with IFN\u03b3. Subsequent time points correspond to the time following interferon stimulation, in hours (1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 8 hours, 16 hours and 24 hours). As visible on the heat map, there are distinct differences in gene expression between the B2 and B19 cells. The most dramatic difference occurs on day t-6. B2 cells exhibit a rapid burst of gene expression, indicated as a single column of pink on the left most edge of the heat map. In contrast, the B19 cells appear to undergo a much slower and prolonged gene expression program that was not as rapidly down regulated as in genes in the B2 cells. Additional gene expression data for a number of proteins involved in cell growth and apoptosis, is shown in the bottom half of the figure to highlight a similar pattern in gene expression and kinetics. The green border indicates the B2 haplotype expression pattern and the red border corresponds to the B19 expression pattern. hours.

How do the two lineages of macrophages differ at the gene expression level? 3. What specific patterns of gene expression correlate with divergent macrophage differentiation, activation and function? 4. What is the underlying cause of the divergent gene expression patterns observed between B2 and B19 macrophages?",

            "text": "The answer to the question of why the IFN\u03b3 stimulated B2 haplotype cells produce more nitric oxide than the IFN\u03b3 stimulated B19 cells lies in the timing of macrophage differentiation and the phenotypic variation that is set up early prior to IFN\u03b3 stimulation, such as divergent expression of genes involved in differentiation and immune competence. At day t-6, after plating of monocytes without interferon stimulation, several genes relating to inflammation, interferon responses and differentiation are upregulated in the B2 haplotype. This is to be expected as adherence of the monocytes is actually an activation signal, but it is notable that this signal is not resulting in the same gene expression pattern in the B19 haplotype. This pattern can be observed for genes such as IL1\u03b2, PTSG2, IL6, which are mainly associated with the inflammatory M1 phenotype. On the other hand, Adenosine receptor A2B is also showing increased gene expression at this time in B2 cells, and this receptor plays an important role in differentiation, as well as in the inflammatory response. Expressions of these genes are consequently initially increased at the time of adherence, and then again after stimulation with interferon, in the B2 haplotype. Some, but not all of these genes are expressed after stimulation with interferon in the B19 haplotype, but not to the same extent as the B2 macrophages, which appears to relate to the initial lack of expression at t-6 days, the beginning of differentiation.",

            "text": "Another interesting observation was the differential expression of genes at day t-6 versus day t-3 in the two haplotypes, as a large number of genes is highly expressed in both haplotypes at day t-6, but then is completely shut down in B2 haplotypes while showing delayed expression until day t-3 in the B19 birds. This seems to indicate a lack of appropriate regulation in the B19 birds, consequently leading to less coherent initiation of gene expression when stimulated. Some of the genes showing this pattern are macrophage differentiation associated GATA2 and FADD, as well as macrophage podosome markers VCL and GSN. Taken together, these results appear to suggest that the regulation of B2 differentiation from monocyte to macrophage is very tightly regulated with many genes increasing in expression, quickly followed by shutting down this increased gene expression. In contrast, the regulation of B19 gene expression is not well regulated, appearing to \"linger\" with either delayed or extended gene expression. Consequently, we observed differences in expression of genes after stimulation with interferon. Specifically, genes that were strongly expressed at day t-6 and not expressed (or only weakly expressed) at day t-3 in the B2 birds, were robustly increased at 2 and 4 hours of stimulation. In contrast, the same genes showed weak and delayed expression in B19 birds after stimulation, emphasizing the importance of the regulation of gene expression during differentiation. This relates very well to the differences we previously reported in morphology of B2 and B19 macrophages during differentiation and after stimulation.",

Thousands of genes are up-regulated and then down-regulated in a 24-hour period following IFN\u03b3 stimulation. The coordinated activity of multiple regulatory and gene expression control mechanisms is required to effectively achieve the dramatic changes in internal cellular programing that occur. Although the B2 and B19 birds' haplotypes differ within the MHC locus, the functional consequences of this genetic difference extend well beyond the genes encoded within the B-locus, including macrophage differentiation, M1 and M2 macrophage markers, lysosomal factors involved in phagocytosis, podosome development, invadosome capabilities, chemotaxis potential and matrix degradation ability. Additionally, during the process of differentiation and activation, thousands of genes associated with basic cellular biology undergo rapid changes in expression in coordination with the expression of factors associated with cell renewal and proliferation such as cell cycle regulators, mitotic spindle components, factors involved in chromatin remodeling, molecules required for chromosome segregation and nuclear division.",

Even so, our PCR validation provides independent evidence that the pattern of gene expression we observed in the RNA sequence data, was consistent and reproducible which is also in line with our previous research detailing differences in macrophage activation and function [13] Conclusions We have tried to elucidate possible mechanisms involved in enhanced disease resistance and macrophage functions displayed by B2 haplotype chickens compared to B19.

It will be of great interest to further elucidate these mechanisms and their connection to enhanced immunity.

B-locus haplotypes in chickens provide a mechanism for genetically perturbing the cluster of immunologically important genes on chromosome 16 and producing phenotypic variation affecting infectious disease susceptibility and resistance. The heat map allows visualization of gene expression between the two genetically distinct haplotypes. Each row represents a gene within the B-locus (listed on the right) and each column corresponds to a particular time point when cells were collected for RNA sequencing. Black pixels indicate zero gene expression for a particular gene at a specific point in time, and dark blue corresponds to very low expression, while brighter blue indicates the next higher levels. Dark purple represents higher expression levels than blue colors, and pink represents the highest levels of gene expression. Monocytes were obtained from each haplotype of chicken and allowed to differentiate into macrophages in vitro for seven, days beginning on day minus 6 (t-6). RNA was sampled on day t-6, day t-3, and again three days later which is denoted as 0 hours (t0), when IFN\u03b3 was initially added to the cultures. On t0, RNA was sampled immediately before stimulation with IFN\u03b3. Subsequent time points correspond to the time following interferon stimulation, in hours (1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 8 hours, 16 hours and 24 hours). As visible on the heat map, there are distinct differences in gene expression between the B2 and B19 cells. The most dramatic difference occurs on day t-6. B2 cells exhibit a rapid burst of gene expression, indicated as a single column of pink on the left most edge of the heat map. In contrast, the B19 cells appear to undergo a much slower and prolonged gene expression program that was not as rapidly down regulated as in genes in the B2 cells. Additional gene expression data for a number of proteins involved in cell growth and apoptosis, is shown in the bottom half of the figure to highlight a similar pattern in gene expression and kinetics. The green border indicates the B2 haplotype expression pattern and the red border corresponds to the B19 expression pattern.",

Expression was measured at 0 hours, 2 hours and 4 hours. Expression for transcripts in B2 cells are shown in green and expression for transcripts are shown in red. Standard error is shown for each value. Values were considered statistically significant with p<0.05.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0179391.g004",

A subset of genes exhibiting divergent gene expression were identified and visualized in heat following hierarchical clustering of the genes (rows), but not the time points (columns). The genes cluster into four major clades (clade1, clade2, clade3, and clade4) with a singleton gene (labelled clade 5). Among these genes, represented in clade1 and clade2, are a number of miRNAs exhibiting strong expression in B2 cells (mir-147, mir-146b, mir-1618, mir-200a, mir-1649, and mir-1648a) compared to the B19 samples. Likewise, miRNAs contained in clade3 and clade4 exhibit greater expression in B19 cells (mir-1627, mir-222b, mir-1633, and mir-19a). Additionally, a number of small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) exhibit similarly dichotomous gene expression patterns (clade4) such that SNORd24, snoZ40, SNORD74, SNORA17, and SNORD12 exhibit substantially higher levels of expression in B19 cells on day -6 compared to B2 cells while B2 cells express such as snoU2_19 (clade2).",
