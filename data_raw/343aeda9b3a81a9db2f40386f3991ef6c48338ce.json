If \u2264 p p c , equation (14) has only the trivial solution Fig. 4) . If > p p c , there is a nontrivial solution for equation (14) and then equation (13) has a nonzero solution. In this case, it is not easy to get the exact nontrivial solution of equation (14) for it is a set of multivariable high-order equations. By employing fixed-point iteration, we get a numerical solution of equation (14) instead and then obtain the percolation probability from (13) . From the numerical solution (Fig. 4) , it can be seen that \u221e P p ( ) picks up abruptly at p c then increases rapidly with p increasing. We extend the result to At the beginning of emergence, because of the lack of understanding of SARS and the high mobility of the modern-social activities, SARS spread rapidly. Afterwards, when people found the high infectivity and death rate of SARS, they begun to limit social activity of the public and take strict isolated measure to prevent the spreading of disease then the disease was contained. Is this the proper infection control measure of SARS? Which kind of infectious diseases are suitable for this approach? In fact, the spreading of SARS is a percolation process. Considering the differences of physical resistibility or intimate contact with the infected individual, we divided people into two groups: the people with higher infection probability (e.g., infants and elderly or healthcare workers), named as susceptible persons; and the people with lower infection probability, named as common persons. Then this disease is modelled as inhomogeneous percolation on Bethe lattices with two occupied probabilities, i.e., \u2212 PBL Z S p Z S kp ( ; ( , ), ( , )). Here, Z is the average contact number of each person, S (of Z) denotes susceptible persons with infection probability p and Z-S (of Z) is common persons with infection probability kp \u2264 \u2264 k (0 1). The first case of SARS was confirmed on March 5 (in Beijing, 2003) and the government started reporting the cases from April 20. According to case-reporting data from April 20 to June 23 (in Beijing, 2003) (from the government bulletin) and the control activities of government, we find three other critical time points of SARS: May 1 (it is legal holidays from May 1 to May 7), May 14 (people generally panicked over SARS and limited their social activities), and May 30 (new cases of SARS considerably decreased). Correspondingly, the spreading process of SARS was divided into five stages. Then, by random simulation, we found that the spreading of SARS has a fifteen-day time delay. Therefore, we changed the five stages of the spreading process of SARS into: stage 1-from March 20 to May 4, stage 2-from May 5 to May 15, stage 3-from May 16 to May 28, stage 4-from May 29 to June 13, and stage 5-from June 14 to June 23.",

It is found that the inhomogeneous percolation on Bethe lattices serves as an appropriate model to describe the dynamic spreading behaviour of the infectious disease (SARS). The percolation model of SARS is not only in good agreement with the actual recorded data, but also can be used to predict the future trend of the disease and supply the missing data of the past. Moreover, it can provide quantitative results for government to make more proper disease-control strategies.",

Figure 6 (a) is the actual cumulative case-reporting data and simulative data. New cases of each day are displayed in Fig. 6 (b). We can find that the inhomogeneous percolation is in good fitting with the dynamic process of SARS spreading and time delay is the considerable feature of SARS. The relationship between cumulative confirmed cases and cases out of effective control displays in Fig. 6 (c). It can be seen that there will be many persons infected with SARS even if only a few cases of SARS are out of effective control. Sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity index is the ratio of the change in output to the change in input of parameters or variables 32 . Taking into account the characteristics of the model, we employ a one factor at a time (OAT) approach, which is more agile and easy to interpret. The popular sensitivity index of OAT approach isis introduced to normalize the index by removing the affects of units 33 .First, we get = \u2212from equation (3), and then derive that:Where, p c is the critical infection probability, one of the output of the SARS-percolation model; Z S k , , denote the average contact number of each patient, the number of susceptible persons of Z, the ratio of infection probabilities of susceptible person to common person (see page 12), respectively. They are all input parameters.Based on the Table 1 , the sensitivity indexes of p c to three input parameters at five critical time points are obtained, which are all negative scalars. These suggest that the decreasing of each input parameters correspond to the increasing of p c . Among them, the absolute value of SI p Z Fig. 7(a) for an illustration.By a similar analysis with a numerical approach, we obtain \u03c7 SI p p ( ( ), ) and \u221e SI P p p ( ( ), ). The sensitivity index \u03c7 SI p p ( ( ), ) is shown in Fig. 7(b) . It indicates that \u03c7 p ( ) is more sensitive near the p c . Since \u03c7 p ( ) is the average size ",
