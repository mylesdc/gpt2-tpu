The 'low-dose' corticosteroid is supposed to have a prophylactic effect on the incidence of the FES and arterial hypoxemia by reducing this inflammatory response. It is expected that inhaled corticosteroids (ciclesonide aerosol) may prevent the development of hypoxemia or fat embolism syndrome in high-risk patients by reducing this inflammatory response. Metereddose inhaler (MDI) steroid preparations can reach the lung parenchyma with minimal systemic effect. Sixty cases of polytrauma patients presenting within eight hours of injury were randomly allocated into one of the two groups. In Group 1 (n 1 =30) ciclesonide, 640 mcg, was given with a metered dose inhaler and repeated once again after 24 hours, whereas Group 2 (n 2 =30) was taken as control and observed for 72 hours for any episode of hypoxia. The outcome was assessed using Schonfeld's criteria for the eventual outcome of subclinical or clinical FES. Out of 30 patients in each group, six patients developed subclinical FES, whereas three from ciclesonide prophylaxis group and eight from controls developed clinical FES. There is no statistical significance found between the eventual outcomes of subclinical or clinical FES between the ciclesonide prophylaxis and control group. Although there was a trend seen in the possible preventive efficacy of inhalational steroid in the present study, it did not reach the statistically significant level. The prophylactic role of inhalational steroid in post-traumatic subclinical and clinical FES is statistically insignificant in the present study.",

The 'low-dose' corticosteroids given after the skeletal trauma have been seen to have a prophylactic effect on the incidence of the FES and arterial hypoxemia. They mostly act as an anti-inflammatory agent, reducing perivascular hemorrhage and edema resulting from pulmonary parenchymal injury in response to lipid metabolites. Corticosteroid use is primarily limited by the fear of systemic side effects associated with their usage, such as metabolic derangements, delayed wound healing, and increased risk of infection, which are more troublesome for the surgeons. Due to the apprehension of complications with the systemic use of steroids, their use in prophylaxis of FES is still limited.",

However, until a few years ago, the aerosol steroid therapy was effective only up to bronchial level. With the discovery of ciclesonide, which can reach up to the lung parenchyma, the effect can be achieved at the alveolar level. The efficacy of inhaled corticosteroids has already been clinically proved in chlorine gas-induced lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome due to sepsis [18] [19] . As FES is also primarily a lung parenchyma disorder, it was hypothesized in this study that ciclesonide aerosol given as prophylaxis may be able to stabilize the lung parenchyma and thus able to bear the effects of post-traumatic fat globulinemia. This could prevent the development of hypoxemia or fat embolism syndrome in patients at high risk for this complication. There are still no studies regarding the role of inhaled steroids in the prophylaxis of post-traumatic hypoxia and fat embolism syndrome in the literature.",

Out of the 30 patients studied in Group 1, three had a Schonfeld's score more than or equal to 5, indicating clinical fat embolism syndrome.

Although there is a biological plausibility that inhaled steroids may be useful, as shown by the study of intravenous steroids in the literature, as well as a trend seen in the possible preventive efficacy of inhalational steroid in the present study, it did not reach a statistically significant level in our study. The possible explanation could be a true inefficacy of the inhalational steroid, the small number of patients in our study, or the effect may be less pronounced than intravenous steroids that the study was not powered to detect. Therefore, larger study groups may be required to define precisely the role of inhalational steroids in the prophylaxis of posttraumatic subclinical and clinical FES. Moreover, as the etiology and pathogenesis of FES is still not certain, there may be other factors also contributing to the above results. Though the number of patients in the present study is small, it is observed that the prophylactic role of inhalational steroids, i.e. ciclesonide, in post-traumatic clinical and subclinical FES is statistically insignificant.",
