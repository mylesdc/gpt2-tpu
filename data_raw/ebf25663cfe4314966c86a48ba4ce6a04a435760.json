In rats with subtotal nephrectomy (STNx), adverse cardiac remodelling occurs despite elevated cardiac ACE2 activity. We hypothesised that diminazene aceturate (DIZE), which has been described as having an off-target effect to activate ACE2, would have beneficial cardiac effects in STNx rats. STNx led to hypertension, diastolic dysfunction, left ventricular hypertrophy, cardiac fibrosis, and increased cardiac ACE, ACE2, Ang II and Ang 1-7 levels. Cardiac gene expression of ADAM17 was also increased. In STNx, two-weeks of subcutaneous DIZE (15mg/kg/d) had no effect on blood pressure but improved diastolic dysfunction and cardiac fibrosis, reduced ADAM17 mRNA and shifted the cardiac RAS balance to a cardioprotective profile with reduced ACE and Ang II. There was no change in cardiac ACE2 activity or in cardiac Ang 1-7 levels with DIZE. In conclusion, our results suggest that DIZE exerts a protective effect on the heart under the pathological condition of kidney injury. This effect was not due to improved kidney function, a fall in blood pressure or a reduction in LVH but was associated with a reduction in cardiac ACE and cardiac Ang II levels. As in vitro studies showed no direct effect of DIZE on ACE2 or ACE activity, the precise mechanism of action of DIZE remains to be determined.",

In kidney disease secondary to subtotal nephrectomy (STNx), kidney ACE and Ang II are increased [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] and kidney ACE2 activity is decreased [12, 14] . These findings have led to strategies to replenish ACE2 using recombinant ACE2 or to activate ACE2 using compounds such as diminazene aceturate (DIZE) [15] . Both approaches have beneficial effects on the kidney in experimental kidney disease. Recombinant human ACE2 prevented Ang II induced kidney disease and tubulointerstitial fibrosis [16] and slowed the progression of diabetic nephropathy through a reduction in renal Ang II and increased Ang 1-7 levels [17] . DIZE had reno-protective effects after renal ischemia/reperfusion injury through enhancement of antioxidant activity [18] , and we reported that short-term DIZE decreased kidney cortical ACE activity and ameliorated the reduction in kidney ACE2 expression and activity in STNx rats [13] .",

Therefore, the focus of this paper was to investigate the effect of short-term DIZE on cardiac structure and function, cardiac ACE/ACE2 gene expression/activity and cardiac angiotensin peptide (Ang II/Ang 1-7) levels in STNx rats with an activated RAS and in Control rats with a balanced RAS. In addition, we assessed gene expression of cardiac ADAM17 [21] , a proteinase that is responsible for the cleavage or \"shedding\" of the catalytically active ectodomain of ACE2 from the cell membrane.",

All sections used for quantification were fixed, processed, sectioned and immunolabelled at the same time and under the same conditions to limit variability. Images were imported into the AIS Imaging program using a colour video camera and a standard light microscope (magnification \u00d720). The detection level threshold for positively stained areas (brown for 3,3-Diaminobenzidine staining) was set so that the processed image accurately reflected the positively stained areas as visualized by light microscopy on the unprocessed digital image. Myocyte ACE2 staining was determined by measuring the area of stained tissue within a given field, excluding vessels, artifacts, minor scars or incomplete tissue fields. Fifteen to 20 fields were analysed per animal.

The finding that DIZE was associated with down regulation of ADAM17 mRNA led us to speculate that DIZE may have indirect effects to maintain cardiac ACE2 activity levels and thus reduce cardiac Ang II, through reduced cleavage of ACE2 from cardiac cells. This hypothesis would be consistent with reports that cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of ADAM17 prevented shedding of ACE2, whilst exogenous infusion of Ang II increased myocardial ADAM17 expression and decreased myocardial ACE2 activity [33] .

Thus, by contrast to its effects in the pathological state of kidney failure, DIZE had no effect on cardiac ACE/ACE2 activity, cardiac Ang peptides or ADAM17 in Control rats with a balanced RAS and normal blood pressure and kidney function. We have previously shown that short-term DIZE significantly reduced kidney cortical ACE activity and ameliorated the reduction in cortical and medullary ACE2 activity in STNx rats with kidney RAS imbalance, but had no effect on kidney ACE2 expression or activity in Control rats with a balanced RAS [13] . Further support for this concept comes from studies of DIZE after myocardial infarction (MI) which is also associated with imbalance of the cardiac RAS [22] . A 4-week s.c infusion of DIZE in MI in rats improved cardiac remodelling, significantly increased cardiac ACE2 mRNA and activity and reduced cardiac ACE mRNA and activity-these effects were blocked by concurrent use of the ACE2 inhibitor, C16 [22] . In hypercholesterolemic mice on a wild-type or ACE2 deficient background with Ang II induced abdominal aortic aneurysms [34] , 4-weeks of intramuscular DIZE (30mg/kg) increased kidney ACE2 mRNA and activity in wild-type mice, and reduced the incidence and severity of Ang II-induced abdominal aortic aneurysms. However DIZE had no effect in ACE2-deficient mice which does suggest that it acts through an ACE2-dependent mechanism [34] .",

            "text": "The precise mechanism of action of DIZE remains unclear [35] and there is conflicting evidence with regard its effect on ACE2 activity [13, 15, 23, 35, 36] . Kulemina et al first reported the off target effects of DIZE to activate ACE2 [15] and described a biphasic dose-response curve; DIZE activated ACE2 at low concentrations and partially inhibited ACE2 at high concentrations. Incubation of human rACE2 with DIZE (100\u03bcM) increased ACE2 activity in some studies [23] , but others have shown that DIZE did not increase the enzymatic activity of mouse or human rACE2 [35] . We reported that DIZE had no effect ex vivo to alter kidney ACE2 activity, but was associated with increased kidney ACE2 activity in vivo in STNx rats [13] . The ex vivo studies in cardiac membranes of STNx and control rats in the current study showed no direct effect of DIZE to increase ACE2 activity. Taken together, the reported effects of DIZE on ACE2 activity vary according to whether the study was in vivo or ex vivo, and may depend on the underlying pathophysiology, route of administration or the tissue used to assess ACE2 activity. In order to delineate if the mechanism of action of DIZE is specifically related to ACE2 activation, future studies should examine the effect of co-administration of DIZE with specific ACE2 inhibitors such as MLN 4760 (C16) to help establish or exclude if the observed beneficial cardiac effects of DIZE are truly ACE2 dependent.",

The benefits of DIZE were associated with a shift in the cardiac RAS balance to a cardioprotective profile with reduced ACE and Ang II and no change in cardiac ACE2 activity. Cardiac Ang 1-7 levels were not changed with DIZE suggesting that its main effects are related to reduced Ang II. We have previously reported in STNx, that improved cardiac structure and function was associated with reduced cardiac ACE2 activity, and the finding that cardiac ACE2 remained unchanged with DIZE may reflect reduced cardiac ACE2 shedding secondary to downregulation of cardiac ADAM17. Further studies are now warranted to determine if the observed beneficial cardiac effects of DIZE Cardiac ACE2 activity is increased to counteract elevated cardiac ACE and is shed into the circulation. Correlation analysis shows increased left ventricular (LV) ACE2 activity is associated with increased LV ACE activity (A) and plasma ACE2 activity (B), with no correlation between LV tissue and plasma ACE. Control and subtotal nephrectomy (STNx) rats without active treatment were used for the correlation analysis. Open squares represent Control rats; closed squares represent STNx rats.",

Ex vivo DIZE had no effect on endogenous ACE2 (A) and ACE (B) activity in LV membrane preps (100\u03bcg per well) from Control (n = 4) and subtotal nephrectomy (STNx, n = 4) rats. The ACE inhibitor, ramiprilat caused a concentrationdependent displacement of specific 125 I-MK351A binding from rat LV ACE and DIZE had no effect on ACE binding (C). Studies are also needed to assess the long-term impact of DIZE on both cardiac and kidney function, and to investigate if combining DIZE with standard RAS blockade has incremental effects to improve the cardiac consequences of kidney disease or to prevent progression to chronic kidney disease. Although DIZE is used for the treatment of trypanosomiasis or sleeping sickness, side effects may preclude its widespread clinical use [37] [38] [39] and specific compounds that selectively amplify ACE2 activity will be needed if this approach is to find utility.",
