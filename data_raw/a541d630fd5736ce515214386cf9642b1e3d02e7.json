We used the databases Scopus and Web of Science to determine the most frequently cited papers. The most cited fifty papers in each database were identified. We then ranked the papers according to the highest citation count recorded from any of the two databases. The most frequently cited paper received 964 citations and was by DelVecchio VG et al. reporting the complete genomic sequencing of Brucella melitensis. The papers were published in 30 journals led by the \"Infection and Immunity\" journal and the \"Veterinary Microbiology\" journal (each had 7 papers). Citation classics in brucellosis were all in English except one in French and were mostly of basic science type. In addition, we noticed that 12 articles that were identified among the highest fifty articles in one database were missed by the other database and vice versa. Therefore, we suggest that searching in more than one database would detect additional citation classics.",

Am J Public Health Nations Health, 1939); (c) identifying Brucella outbreaks could be difficult: Brucella is difficult to detect and identify [38] ; and (d) Brucella species are genetically homogeneous, and thus, the typing of Brucella species for epidemiological purposes by conventional molecular typing methods has remained elusive [39] .",

For example, in the WOS, in the categories of \"agriculture, dairy, and animal sciences\" and \"food science and technology,\" the highest impact factor for a journal was 4.7 and 7.3, respectively. While in the category of \"medicine, general and internal\" and \"microbiology,\" the highest impact factor for a journal was 72 and 23.6, respectively. (b) The possible low productivity of research that is performed on Brucella as evidenced by the lower number of articles on Brucella in agricultural journals. For example, a combined search for the word \"brucell * \" and the journals \"Veterinary Research\" and \"Journal of Dairy Science\" yielded 20 and 25 papers, respectively, while the same search in the journals \"Clinical Infectious Diseases\" and \"Journal of Bacteriology\" yielded 52 and 237 papers, respectively. Furthermore, we doubt that our search missed important journals from the agricultural fields because the databases Scopus and WOS include large collection of agricultural journals.

We believe that our method is more accurate because relying on the mean for ranking might lower the rank of a given article. This is because the databases differ in reporting the citation count for a particular article. The variation in citation count between databases results from differences in journal coverage and quality [44] . Scopus includes a more expanded spectrum of journals than WOS, and its citation analysis is faster and includes more articles than the citation analysis of WOS [45] . However, Scopus tends to miss older citations which results in omission of studies before 1980 [46, 47] . Here, we identified 12 articles that were listed in the highest 50 articles in one database but were not identified within the highest 50 articles in the other database and vice versa.

These limitations include the presence of inherent problems in the citation process itself, for example, incomplete or inappropriate citations, biased citation [44, 45, 52, 53] ; changes in the list of citation classics with time making it a snapshot of the current state of research [54] ; absence of articles with languages other than English which is mostly because authors are more likely to cite articles in their own language, and English articles are more likely to be cited overall [20] ; and finally, missing of important studies because their findings became well known [55] . The latter point is relevant here because brucellosis was discovered in 1887 and it is possible that some important studies were not indexed in current database but their findings are now considered well known. Despite these limitations, the study provides a picture for the main cited articles in brucellosis research publications since the discovery of Brucella 130 years ago.",

The study led to description of two novel species: Brucella ceti and Brucella pinnipedialis. At position 52, Scholz et al. in 2008 described two strains of Brucella microti as novel species. The strains had been originally isolated from clinical specimens of diseased wild common voles (Microtus arvalis) during an epizootic in Czech Republic [24]. At position 54, in 2003, Sohn et al. published the first report of community acquired human infections with marine mammal-associated Brucella in two patients. Both patients were young men from Peru and the route of infection was not discovered [25].

At present, the BvrR/BvrS system is one of the best characterized two component systems. Two component systems allow the bacteria to sense their environment and subsequently modulate the expression of genes [35]. Three large case series appear in the list of classics: Colmenero et al.
