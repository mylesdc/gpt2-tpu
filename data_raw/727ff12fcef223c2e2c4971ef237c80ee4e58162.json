Infections may be introduced by staff, visitors or new or transferred residents, and outbreaks of influenza in such settings can have devastating consequences for individuals, as well as placing extra strain on health services. As the population ages over the coming decades, increased provision of such facilities seems likely. The need for robust infection prevention and control practices will therefore remain of paramount importance if the impact of outbreaks is to be minimised. In this review, we discuss the nature of the problem of influenza in long-term care facilities, and approaches to preventive and control measures, including vaccination of residents and staff, and the use of antiviral drugs for treatment and prophylaxis, based on currently available evidence.",

With the population in Europe aged 85 years and above projected to rise from 14 million currently to 19 million by 2020 and to 40 million by 2050, and the expectation that more than 30% of European citizens will be aged over 60 years by 2050, the proportion of the population in countries at all levels of development which requires long-term care is only set to increase dramatically over the coming decades. 2 Outbreaks of seasonal influenza in LTCFs are well recognised, as are the challenges of preventing and controlling influenza outbreaks in these settings. The development of universally applicable guidance on the prevention and control of influenza and other respiratory viruses in LTCFs is difficult due to the huge variation in the size of facilities, patient characteristics, the intensity of care provided and resources available. Although some countries have produced guidance on IPC for use specifically in LTCFs, [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] most have not.",

Nursing home residents are at greatest risk due to their overall frailty, close quarter living arrangements, shared caregivers, and opportunities for introduction of healthcare-associated infections and the spread of pathogens to other facilities through resident transfers and the movement of staff and visitors in and out of the home. 13, 14 Outbreaks of influenza caused by both influenza A and B viruses are well documented in LTCFs, and may be explosive, 15 with high mortality, highlighting the need for early recognition and prompt initiation of control measures. Accurate measurement of the burden of influenza is heavily influenced by circulating types and subtypes of virus and may vary between communities and between institutions so studies that attempt to estimate this burden require temporal, geographical and institutional breadth. 16 Older studies, relying on culture-based detection techniques, may have underestimated total burden. A review of 206 published infectious outbreaks in elderly care facilities across 19 countries over 40 years identified 37 different pathogens, but influenza viruses caused the largest number of outbreaks (23%). 17 In the 49 outbreaks caused by influenza, the median attack rate in residents was 33% (range 4-94%), and 23% (range 3-58%) among staff, with a median case-fatality rate for residents of 6.5% (range 0-55%). Over three consecutive 9-year time periods between 1980 and 2008, there was no observed decrease in attack rates or case-fatality rates; nevertheless, these data should be interpreted cautiously as antiviral use and the stringency of application of infection prevention and control (IPC) practices has changed over time. 19 Modelling studies suggest that the burden on the health services is particularly onerous for those aged 75 and above, with an estimated 36% of all influenza-attributable respiratory hospitalisations and 74% of all influenza-associated deaths occurring in this age group in the UK over 13 seasons, 20 and accounting for 52% of total hospital bed occupancy and 69% of excess bed days occupancy in England over a similar number of seasons. 21 ",

The relative importance of each of these routes in influenza transmission is unclear, and the contribution of aerosolised infectious droplet nuclei has been particularly contentious. [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] However, most influenza transmission is short-range, and when it has occurred over longer distances, contact transmission has generally not been ruled out. 32 Transmission studies often do not control for confounders such as vaccination status, handwashing practice, supershedders, amount of coughing, ward layout, surface contamination and ventilation, 33 and further studies which control for these are required in this area.",

Viral shedding has generally been considered to be a proxy for influenza infectiousness, 36-38 peaking 1 to 3 days after symptom onset with most healthy volunteers clearing virus by day 6 to day 7. 34 However, a recent study of household influenza transmission found at most only a weak association between viral load in nose and throat swabs and infectivity, possibly due to the weak correlation between virus concentration in exhaled breath and nose and throat samples, or due to the intensity of household transmission so that even those with low viral loads are still capable of infecting those around them. 39 Pre-symptomatic shedding may occur in up to one-third of cases, [40] [41] [42] [43] and prolonged viral shedding has been reported in children, 42, 44, 45 in patients hospitalised with severe influenza 46 and in immunocompromised patients, 47 in whom prolonged shedding may last weeks or even months. 48, 49 The transmission dynamics of influenza infections in residents of LTCFs have not been studied; age >65 years and the presence of major comorbidities were associated with prolonged shedding of virus and higher viral load in a prospective observational study of hospitalised influenza patients 46 ; these findings may raise the possibility of prolonged shedding in LTCF residents.",

[75] [76] [77] [78] [79] This has been somewhat refuted by a systematic review of four cluster-randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and one cohort study which suggested that offering vaccination to HCW caring for people aged over 60 in LTCFs may have little or no effect on laboratory-confirmed influenza (LCI) (Risk difference (RD) 0 (95% CI \u22120.03 to 0.03) and respiratory-related hospitalisation in residents (RD 0 (95% CI \u22120.02 to 0.02), although there may be a small decrease in lower respiratory infections from 6% to 4% in homes where [95% CI 56-67%]). 88 A systematic review specifically addressing the effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccination in HCWs found just one study reporting laboratory-confirmed influenza in this group with a reported IVE of 88% (95% CI 59% to 96%, P=.0005). 89 Although the currently available evidence may be weak for HCW vaccination to protect the frail and elderly, there is also generally no evidence against it. Therefore, it remains a biologically plausible intervention to provide individual protection to the HCW, act as a barrier against spread of infection and to help reduce the risk associated with influenza infection and prevent staff absenteeism. However, poor vaccine uptake by HCWs has been well documented. In Europe, coverage of HCWs (including those working in LTCFs) varies between countries and is generally much lower than for other vaccination targeted groups, ranging from 9.5% to 75% with a median vaccination coverage rate of 28.6%. 65 In the United States, vaccination rates of 50-70% have been reported for LTCF workers, 78, 90, 91 with coverage consistently lower than among staff working in hospital settings. 91 Reasons given for declining vaccination include fear of side effects, lack of concern or perception of risk, doubts about vaccine efficacy, lack of availability or inconvenient delivery of vaccine, avoidance of medications and dislike of injections. 92 Although mandatory vaccination is effective if it can be implemented, 93 ",

Furthermore, other underlying conditions may impair residents' abilities to verbalise their symptoms. This may impede the early implementation of control and treatment strategies. 99 The precise definition of ILI may vary from country to country; the WHO global surveillance case definition of ILI is an acute respiratory infection with measured fever \u226538\u00b0C and cough and onset within the last 10 days, 100 whereas that of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) definition is sudden onset of symptoms and at least one of four systematic symptoms (fever or feverishness, malaise, headache, myalgia) and at least one of three respiratory symptoms (cough, sore throat, shortness of breath). 3, 101 To confirm an outbreak, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction or viral culture are the preferred methods of laboratory testing.

The CDC recommends consideration of prophylaxis for unvaccinated HCWs caring for people at high risk of complications, and for all employees regardless of vaccination status if an outbreak is due to a strain which is poorly matched to the current vaccine strains. 3 To protect vulnerable people, ECDC also recommends consideration of prophylaxis for HCWs, particularly when low IVE is expected due to strain mismatch. 120 As IVE is lower in those who are elderly and frail than in younger healthy people, it would seem prudent to have a low threshold for offering prophylaxis to those caring for them, and particularly so if chains of transmission from a resident to staff are described; or from a resident to staff to resident.

Managers of LTCFs have an important role in ensuring that all staff have ongoing training on the importance and practice of IPC, and that the facilities are available for IPC measures to be implemented to a satisfactory level and with standard precautions being used at all times, regardless of the detection of a suspected outbreak. Written policies should be in place in every LTCF outlining: resident and staff influenza immunisation policy; a written outbreak management plan which includes outbreak recognition (definitions, thresholds for suspicion of an outbreak), identification of communication channels, operational measures including active surveillance, staff contingency plans, visitor restriction policies, and consideration of antiviral treatment and prophylaxis strategy; a policy for ill staff to remain off work; a policy for dealing with visitors with symptoms of an acute respiratory tract infection.During the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak, compliance with IPC measures was found to be associated with HCWs' perception that the facilities in which they worked had clear IPC policies and protocols, and that the management had a positive attitude towards occupational health and safety and provided training in IPC practices.62 Managers in LTCFs therefore have a pivotal role in creating a strong institutional climate in which staff feel valued, with continuous accessibility to the training resources, clear IPC policies and supplies and facilities required to promote compliance with IPC practices.",

A systematic review assessing the effectiveness of influenza vaccine in people 65 years or over, with separate analyses for those living in nursing homes and community dwelling older people,66 concluded that for elderly people living in closed communities vaccination may be slightly to moderately more effective than no vaccination at preventing influenza-like illness (ILI) (24% [95% CI 12-34%]), pneumonia (47% [95% CI 34-57%]), hospitalisation (49% [19-68%]), overall mortality (60% [95% CI 23-79%]) and mortality from influenza or pneumonia (54% [95% CI 37-67%]), although no significant protective effect against proven influenza was found. A later systematic review 67 also found that vaccination may have a small significant protective effect against pneumonia (37% [95% CI 18-53%]) and mortality from influenza and pneumonia (34%[95% CI 10-53%]), in institutionalised older adults \u226560 years; also a trend towards protection against ILI (21% [95% CI \u22123 to 39%]). The authors did not address the effectiveness of vaccination against allcause mortality and, due to an insufficient number of studies, were unable to perform meta-analyses for laboratory-confirmed influenza or hospitalisation. The quality of the evidence is very weak in both reviews and does not definitively answer the uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of influenza vaccination in older people living in LTCFs. In particular, selection bias may occur by targeting the frail for immunisation; conversely people who are particularly frail or close to death may not receive vaccine resulting in overestimation of the effectiveness of vaccine on mortality (healthy recipient effect). 68,69 Although there is some indirect evidence of influenza vaccine effectiveness (IVE) against hospitalisation, pneumonia and death from studies which have controlled for multiple confounders and compared summer and winter mortality in vaccinated and unvaccinated elderly people, 70,71 accurate proof of IVE requires adequatelypowered studies using laboratory-confirmed outcomes, in which confounders are controlled for and which comprehensively monitor morbidity and mortality.72",

Another systematic review 81 found a significant reduction in ILI and all-cause mortality in residents associated with vaccination of HCWs (42% and 29% reductions respectively), but no significant reductions for laboratory-confirmed influenza or all-cause hospitalisations. Overall the authors rated the quality of evidence as very low to moderate for the different outcomes, and concluded that HCW influenza vaccination can enhance patient safety. Protective effects of HCW vaccination against non-specific outcomes may be an indication of unaccounted cluster biases, such as differences in handwashing or other IPC precautions and warrants further investigation.82 Evidence from observational and modelling studies suggests a likely proportionate effect of HCW vaccination coverage on patient protection, although no clear threshold for HCW vaccine uptake above which the protective effect on residents increases substantially has been established.[83][84][85][86][87] Inactivated trivalent vaccines have been found to have a protective effect against proven influenza in healthy adults (overall protective effect in vaccine-matched and poorly matched seasons 62%",

Adapted from the Tailoring Immunization Programmes (TIP) approach, it is based on social and behavioural change models and provides tools to identify priority populations, determine barriers and enablers to vaccination, and to implement evidence-based interventions.

A balance may need striking between the strict enforcement of social isolation and visitor restrictions and psychological welfare in vulnerable populations. Other measures to control transmission will include closure of the facility to new admissions based on risk assessment, limitation of visitors,cohorting staff to avoid crossover of care for infected and asymptomatic residents, excluding staff with ILI symptoms, rostering vaccinated staff to care for infected residents, and preventing unvaccinated staff from working in other healthcare facilities during the outbreak. As influenza virus has been shown to survive on hands and inanimate surfaces from a few hours for up to several days, 111 regular and thorough hand hygiene and enhanced environmental cleaning may reduce contact transmission, and there is evidence that even simple, readily available, easy to handle products such as 1% bleach and detergents like 0.01% washing-up liquid are effective in killing influenza virus depending upon the material and situation and can be used even in low-resource settings.112",

Meta-analysis of observational studies indicated a potential effect of oseltamivir in reducing hospitalisation in the general population (all ages) compared with no antiviral (OR 0.75 [95% CI 0.66 to 0.89]), but no significant effect was found for inhaled zanamivir (OR 0.66 [95% CI 0.37 to 1.18]). 0.43]) but the quality of evidence was low, and related only to oseltamivir. 117Uncertainties remain about the effectiveness of treatment in highrisk populations such as LTCF residents as much of the available evidence relates to previously healthy younger adults.

With an increasingly elderly population, the demand for LTCFs is likely increase over the coming years. Many basic and clinical questions remain unanswered about the transmission, prevention and treatment of influenza in these institutions and further evidence is needed to determine which interventions, or combination of interventions and hygiene practices are most efficacious in these settings. Although vaccination for residents and staff forms the cornerstone of preventive influenza policy in LTCFs, and vaccine coverage is high among residents in some countries, currently available vaccines are less effective in older people and those with comorbidities. Vaccination coverage among HCWs caring for residents of LTCFs is generally much lower than for those in other priority groups and efforts are required to improve this to protect the vulnerable, the individual HCW and the workforce. Although further studies of the efficacy of antiviral treatment and prophylaxis in LTCF setting are required, available data suggest that antivirals should be used early during the course of infection for treatment of residents and considered for prophylaxis during suspected or confirmed influenza outbreaks to reduce secondary transmission. The prevention and control of influenza in LTCFs requires a multifaceted approach; vaccination and antiviral policies form an important part of this, but strong managerial leadership, outbreak planning, and a well-trained, educated and engaged workforce are pivotal to the successful implementation of IPC policies.
