Viruses typically encode a substantially lower fraction of TM proteins than archaea or bacteria, with the notable exception of viruses with virions containing a lipid component such as a lipid envelope, internal lipid core, or inner membrane vesicle. Compared to bacteriophages, archaeal viruses are substantially enriched in membrane proteins. However, this feature is not always stable throughout the evolution of a viral lineage; for example, TM proteins are not part of the common heritage shared between Lipothrixviridae and Rudiviridae. In contrast to bacteria and archaea, viruses almost completely lack proteins with complicated membrane topologies composed of more than 4 TM segments, with the few detected exceptions being obvious cases of relatively recent horizontal transfer from the host.",

Eukaryotic cells also possess an elaborate endomembrane system whereas archaea and bacteria, some notable exceptions notwithstanding, lack endomembranes. The integrity of the membrane is essential for the survival of the cell because the membrane maintains gradients of energy, ions and nutrients between the cell and the environment. The membranes of all cells are spanned by diverse integral membrane proteins including energy-dependent transporters, antiporters and channels that are responsible for transport of specific ions or small molecules, and receptors involved in the recognition of various environmental cues. The great majority of integral membrane proteins are anchored in the membrane by hydrophobic transmembrane (TM) helices. The number and orientation of the TM segments determines the topology of the protein in the membrane [1] . Structural characterization of TM proteins is technically challenging and lags far behind the structural analysis of soluble proteins [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . Conversely, however, computational prediction of TM helices from protein sequence is relatively straighforward, and several accurate and fast methods for this task have been developed. These methods have enabled detailed computational analyses of membrane proteomes once multiple complete genomes of diverse organisms have become available for comparative analysis [4, 7] .",

The fraction of membrane proteins in cellular proteomes is remarkably constant, roughly 20-25 %, for a broad spectrum of organisms-from bacteria and archaea to complex eukaryotic organisms [8] [9] [10] . In other words, the number of TM proteins scales linearly with the total number of genes (and, for bacteria and archaea, with the genome size) and thus fits together with metabolic enzymes in the framework of universal scaling laws of functional classes of genes [11] [12] [13] . These findings conform to the model of genome evolution that postulates coupling between the evolutionary trajectories of different gene classes [14] and more specifically imply that evolution of membranes is coupled with the evolution of metabolic networks.",

Notable exceptions to this rule include the 6 TM and 12 TM proteins that are over-represented in many multicellular organisms, and 7 TM proteins that are extremely abundant in animals [10] . Another general rule is that most TM proteins have both their N-and C-terminal ends facing inwards in the membrane (N in -C in )-a topology that appears to be strongly preferred in nearly all organisms, with the major exception being the C. elegans 7 TM receptors that prefer a N out -C in topology [16] -although several instances of proteins with dynamic topologies (temporal and evolutionary) have been described [1] .",

            "text": "All of the general conclusions on the abundance, distribution, and structures of TM proteins pertain to cellular life forms. However, the most abundant biological entities on earth are viruses not cells [17] . In a sharp contrast to cells, virus particles are not bounded by closed membranes capable of supporting electrical and chemical gradients. Nevertheless, membranes play important roles in viral reproduction including entrance into the host cells [18] [19] [20] , replication that often occurs within membranous viral \"factories\" [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] , and egress [27, 28] . Some of these interactions between viruses and membranes are facilitated by cellular TM proteins that are hijacked by viruses, but others are encoded in viral genomes. Despite their importance, the current knowledge of the viral membrane proteome is scarse [2, 3, 5, 6, 29] . The carefully annotated SwissProt database [30] contains information about approximately 3000 viral TM proteins, many of them with unknown function. Of these, only a small number of distinct viral proteins have an appreciable coverage of their TM portions by experimentally determined structures. Often, structural studies are instead performed at low resolution and reveal general trends, e.g. the conservation of secondary structure elements in different classes of holins [27] . To the best of our knowledge, no systematic genome-level analysis of viral TM proteins has been performed so far.",

Recently, the evolutionary conservation of protein-coding genes among bacterial and archaeal viruses has been captured in the collection of Prokaryotic virus Orthologous Groups (POGs) that currently includes >4500 gene families [35, 36] . The POGs include orthologous genes from DNA and RNA viruses that infect bacteria or archaea, although nearly 90 % of the genomes and 97 % of the conserved proteins are from the large double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viruses, which mostly represent the tailed bacteriophages of the order Caudovirales.

We find that viruses show the expected dependence between the number of TM proteins and the total number of genes (genome size), but typically encode a much smaller fraction of TM proteins than bacteria and archaea and also show a much greater variance of that fraction. Furthermore, viruses almost exclusively lack more complicated membrane topologies with more than 4 TM segments, with a few exceptions that appear to represent proteins recently acquired from their hosts.

The difference between the distribution of TM proteins among viruses compared to that among prokaryotes becomes more apparent when the fraction of TM proteins is plotted against the genome size (Fig. 2b ). In agreement with previous observations, the fractions of TM proteins in bacteria and archaea do not depend on the genome size and vary within the range from 15 to 30 %, with most genomes encoding between 20 and 25 % membrane proteins; the few outliers with TM proportion >30 % are highly degraded intracellular parasites that encode only several hundred proteins (Fig. 2b ). Among viruses, the variation in the fraction of TM proteins is much greater, with the majority being <10 % and thus well separated from bacteria and archaea, but a minority encoding a large fraction of TM proteins, within the microbial range and higher (Fig. 2b) . Noticeably, the high TM content was found only in viruses with small and moderate (below average) genome size, conceivably due to the large repertoires of non-TM proteins, such as regulators of host cell transcription, translation, and other metabolic activities, in viruses with larger genomes. Presumably, the typically low but widely varying TM content among viruses has to do with the removal of the functional constraints that dictate the nearly constant proportion of TM proteins in cellular life forms.",

With the sole exception of the archaeal virus family Lipothrixviridae, all viruses with a lipidassociated virion encompass higher fractions of TM proteins than viruses with a lipid-less virion (Fig. 5a) . Among viruses with lipid-containing virions, the fraction of TM proteins range from 24 % at the low end in Bacillus thuringiensis bacteriophage Bam35c (Tectiviridae) to 41 % in two Sulfolobus spindle-shaped viruses (Fuselloviridae). The lipid-less viruses have a proportion of TM proteins that is typically less than 10 %, with only 3 viruses having >20 %, up to a maximum of 23 % in Sulfolobus turreted icosahedral virus of Rudiviridae. The TM proportion of Globuloviridae (only tentatively assigned as \"lipid-associated\") falls in the same range as other lipid-associated viruses, and that of Bicaudaviridae (tentatively assigned as \"non-lipid-associated\") falls in the same range as other lipid-less viruses.",

For instance, Ampullaviridae, Fuselloviridae, Rudiviridae and the archaeal Siphoviridae viruses all share the characteristics of infecting an archaeal host and having a small genome size (<100 proteins). However, the former two families form lipid-associated virions and have a high proportion of TM proteins, whereas the latter two have lipid-less virions and a correspondingly low proportion of TM proteins (Fig. 5) . The sharp distinction between viruses with lipid-containing and those with lipid-less virions is even Thus, it appears possible that the lipid association of the Lipothrixviridae virion is a relatively recent innovation that evolved after the divergence from the common ancestor with Rudiviridae; alternatively, rudiviruses might have lost the membrane association. To explore these possibilities, we compared the genome organization between Lipothrixviridae and Rudiviridae. In agreement with previous reports, the definition of conserved genes based on shared POGs that was employed here indicate considerable conservation between the two virus families (Fig. 7) . Notably, however, the TM proteins are not part of this common heritage. Moreover, many of the genes encoding these largely uncharacterized proteins are not conserved even within their respective families Lipothrixviridae or Rudiviridae (less than a third of TM proteins in Lipothrixviridae are conserved in other virus genomes). Thus, it appears likely that the lipid-association of Lipothrixviridae virions is not a stable feature of this group, but rather is in evolutionary flux and is likely a recently acquired feature (a common feature in prokaryotes and certainly not unexpected in viruses [43] ).",

The majority of viruses posses less than 10 % TM proteins but a substantial minority are TM-rich, with over 40 % TM proteins in some. Furthermore, there is only weak scaling of the number of TM proteins with the genome size of viruses as opposed to the near perfect proportionality in bacteria and archaea.

In cellular life forms, the membranes perform a well-defined suite of essential functions that have to do with energy transformation, ion homeostasis, nutrient transport and signaling. This suite of essential, universal functions dictates the near constancy of the TM protein fraction in bacterial and archaeal genomes. Moreover, the nearly identical distributions of membrane proteins by the number of TM segments in bacteria and archaea imply even more detailed, universal functional constraints. None of these functions are relevant in most viruses, and on the few occasions when Fig. 7 Genes shared in viruses of Lipothrixviridae and Rudiviridae. Genes shared between Acidianus rod-shaped virus 1 (ARV1, Rudiviridae, with 10 % of its proteins containing TM segments), Sulfolobus islandicus rod-shaped virus 1 (SIRV1, Rudiviridae, with 8 % of TM proteins), Sulfolobus islandicus filamentous virus (SIFV, Lipothrixviridae, with 11 % of TM proteins), Acidianus filamentous virus 1 (AFV1, Lipothrixviridae, with 18 % of TM proteins), and Acidianus filamentous virus 6 (AFV6, Lipothrixviridae, with 10 % of TM proteins). Genes shared by multiple genomes within both Lipothrixviridae and Rudiviridae are colored red; or orange if only present in a single genome of either family; genes found in multiple representitives of the 8 genomes of Lipothrixviridae (available as of the last update of the POGs, although only 3 representatives shown here) colored yellow; or found in multiple representitives of the 4 genomes or Rudiviridae (although only 2 representatives shown here) colored blue; genes shared only with viruses from other families colored black; while genes not conserved in POGs colored white. Numbers above a gene represent the number of TM segments that it contains, with sequences containing a signal sequence designated by \"s\", and colored in the same way as the genes such activities are performed by viral proteins, they are involved in virus-host interaction rather than the central process of virus reproduction. Due to the lack of universal, essential membrane functions, viruses show a broad range in the fraction of TM proteins, with most viruses encoding only a few but some showing a greater proportion of TM protein than cellular life forms. A more general implication of these findings is that viruses do not typically obey the universal scaling laws for functional classes of genes that seem to apply in all cellular life forms [11] [12] [13] .",

Clearly, the TM proteins can contribute to virion structure only in those viruses that possess some form of lipid membranes. The observation that all viruses with high TM content also contain lipids in their particles indicates that the involvement of TM proteins in virion morphogenesis is indeed substantial in these cases. Most of the viral membrane proteins supporting virion structure have simple, single-TM architectures. A notable feature that became apparent in the course of this work is the higher prevalence of lipid-containing, TM-rich viruses in archaea compared to bacteria. Whether the greater involvement of membranes in virion structure of archaeal viruses is an adaptation to extreme conditions or reflects other aspects of their lifestyle remains to be determined. The roles of viral TM proteins in host membrane modification are poorly understood but generally fit within the paradigm of virus-host interaction. A well-characterized case are the cyanophages that carry TM proteins of photosystems that boost nutrient production in the infected cyanobacteria [44] .",

The status of Globuloviridae is indeterminate, but since it is considered to be presumably enveloped, was tentatively included along with lipid-associated virions. In a similar fashion, Bicaudaviridae was tentatively assigned to non-lipidassociated virions.",

Phobius is an accurate hidden Markov model-based predictor of TM topology (and signal peptides) that is well suited for high-throughput computational screening of complete proteomes due to its ability to distinguish between TM vs. non-TM proteins, its high speed, and lack of a requirement to first build a multiple sequence alignment. The latter is a particularly useful property among virus proteins that do not have many homologs available in the protein sequence databases. Although Phobius was primarily trained on cellular TM proteins, we did not observe a statistically significant difference in the amino acid composition of 13,117 and 43 experimentally confirmed \u03b1-helical TM regions from cellular and viral proteins, respectively, obtained from the TOPDB database [51] (data not shown), which demonstrates that the physicochemical properties of these proteins are similar.",

Unlike Phobius, MEMSAT3 does not predict whether a protein sequence belongs to a TM protein or a non-TM protein, but instead assumes a priori that every input protein contains at least one TM. Among TM-containing proteins, it may offer greater accuracy in predicting the exact number of TM regions that are present [7, 52] . MEMSAT3 also requires a multiple sequence alignment/profile to be constructed for every input sequence. Therefore, MEMSAT3 was run with default parameters on those proteins predicted by Phobius to contain at least one TM region, and the number of TM segments recorded. To build the multiple sequence alignment/profile used by MEMSAT3, the PSI-BLAST [53] search for homologs was performed with the database of all proteins found in completely sequenced genomes of the viruses that infect bacteria or archaea.",

The frequency of homologs appearing in easily-detected prophage regions (identified with the Phage_Finder program [48] ) was added to both the viral and cellular fractions. Thus, proteins with VQ = 1.0 are those only observed in lytic viruses, proteins with VQ higher than 0.5 represent predominantly phage-and prophagerelated proteins (having more homologs in viruses than in non-prophage regions of bacterial chromosomes), and proteins with VQ < 0.5 represent predominantly cellular proteins (with more homologs in cellular organisms than viruses).",

The nonparametric Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test confirms the independence of the lipid vs. non-lipid-associated populations with p < 0.005, and there is a strong positive correlation between the proportion of TM proteins and lipid association (correlation coefficient 0.776), compared to the weaker correlation of the TM protein proportion with host domain (bacteria vs. archaea) (0.467), and the weak negative correlation with genome size (number of proteins) (\u22120.18). The viruses of the family Lipothrixviridae are an exception to the simple rule under which the presence of lipids in virions dictates the content of TM proteins. Both the number and the proportion of TM proteins in the lipothrixvirus genomes are much lower than those of the other families of archaeal lipid-asscoiated viruses, Ampullaviridae and Fuselloviridae.
