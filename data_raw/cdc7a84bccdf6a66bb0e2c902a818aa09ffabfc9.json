            "text": "Background. Tanreqing injection (TRQ) is a commonly used herbal patent medicine for treating inflammatory airway diseases in view of its outstanding anti-inflammatory properties. In this study, we explored the signaling pathways involved in contributions of TRQ to LPS-induced airway inflammation in rats. Methods/Design. Adult male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats randomly divided into different groups received intratracheal instillation of LPS and/or intraperitoneal injection of TRQ. Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid (BALF) and lung samples were collected at 24 h, 48 h, and 96 h after TRQ administration. Protein and mRNA levels of tumor necrosis factor-(TNF-) , Interleukin-(IL-) 1 , IL-6, and IL-8 in BALF and lung homogenate were observed by ELISA and realtime PCR, respectively. Lung sections were stained for p38 MAPK and NF-B detection by immunohistochemistry. Phospho-p38 MAPK, phosphor-extracellular signal-regulated kinases ERK1/2, phospho-SAPK/JNK, phospho-NF-B p65, phospho-IKK / , and phospho-I B-were measured by western blot analysis. Results. The results showed that TRQ significantly counteracted LPSstimulated release of TNF-, IL-1 , IL-6, and IL-8, attenuated cells influx in BALF, mitigated mucus hypersecretion, suppressed phosphorylation of NF-B p65, I B-, \u0399KK / , ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 MAPK, and inhibited p38 MAPK and NF-B p65 expression in rat lungs. Conclusions. Results of the current research indicate that TRQ possesses potent exhibitory effects in LPS-induced airway inflammation by, at least partially, suppressing the MAPKs and NF-B signaling pathways, in a general dose-dependent manner.",

Targeting the pathways has been considered as an effective therapeutic approach to mitigate progression of numbers of inflammatory disorders, such as the classical neutrophil-predominant airway inflammation induced by Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) [17] . The involvement of the ubiquitous nuclear transcription factor NF-B in the pathogenesis of the LPS-induced inflammatory response has been well recognized [18] . LPS liberates and activates NF-B mostly through I B kinase-(IKK-) dependent phosphorylation and 2 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine subsequent degradation of I B- [19] . The liberated NF-B dimers are crucial for regulating transcription of diverse genes coding for cytokines including TNF-, IL-1 , IL-6, and IL-8 [20, 21] , which together contribute to the upregulation of inflammatory responses. Similar to IKK/I B-/NF-B pathway, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is also activated during an LPS-challenged inflammatory condition [22] . The three subfamilies, extracellular regulated kinases (ERK1/2), c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK), and p38 MAP kinases, have been implicated in the release of proinflammatory cytokines [23, 24] and the activation of NF-B [25] .",

Collectively, no efforts have been done to understand the pathways that are involved in its effect. Since MAPKs and NF-B pathway has been highlighted during the LPSinduced inflammatory disorders, we hypothesize that protective actions of TRQ are likely, at least partially, due to its regulations on the two pathways. In the present study, we attempted to elucidate the anti-inflammatory potential of TRQ on LPS-induced airway inflammation in rat models by investigating the pivotal molecular basis involved in the two classical signaling pathways.",

In addition, some blood vessels in affected regions also thickened with a mixed inflammatory infiltrate of main neutrophils and less monocytes and lymphocytes (Figures 1(d) -1(f)). Low dose TRQ treatment failed to contribute to a remarkable alleviation of extensive inflammation with alveolar air spaces flooded with fibrinous exudate admixed with numerous neutrophils at 24 h (Figure 1(g) ); however, high dose TRQ expressed noteworthy anti-inflammation property throughout the observing period (Figures 1(j)-1(l) ). In general, inflammatory lesion scores decreased over time and they were effectively decreased by TRQ administration in a dose-dependent way (Figure 1(m) ). Besides, a noticeable and conspicuous increase in numbers of mucous cells and amounts of mucosubstances was detected along the airway surface epithelium in LPS group (Figures 2(d) -2(f)), verifying the exact link between airway inflammation and mucus production [31] , while the goblet cell metaplasia and hyperplasia were rarely found in the main airways in control rats (Figures 2(a) -2(c)), with a faint positive AB/PAS staining area being detected.

Previous data showed that lymphocytes present in lung played a role in immunopathology of inflammatory process in both humans and mice [37, 38] . More specifically, study of Dushianthan and colleagues [39] revealed a rapid infiltration of different T cells, including regulatory T cells (Tregs), NKT, and NK cells in human lungs in response to LPS, accompanied by a significant elevation of IL-17, a potent recruiter of neutrophils to inflammatory sites.

Released IL-1 subsequently triggers further production of IL-1 and other cytokines/chemokines by infiltrating cells and accounts for the perpetuation of inflammation. This may partially explain why IL-1 keeps at high levels at 48 h after LPS instillation in our results. As a pleiotropic cytokine that possesses both pro-and anti-inflammation properties, IL-6 plays a key role in acute-phase of lung injury by affecting the release and functions of neutrophils and macrophages [48] . Time-course studies showed that induction of mRNA for IL-1 and TNF-occurred rapidly preceding that of IL-6 mRNA after LPS exposure [49] . Subsequently, depending on p38 MAPK and NF-B pathways, early produced IL-1 and TNF-induced IL-6 mRNA expression and more IL-6 production. This may explain the continued rise in IL-6 mRNA level till 48 h. Therefore, it is noteworthy that a large proportion of LPS-stimulated IL-6 is actually indirectly induced by TNF-and/or IL-1 [50] . Inversely, endotoxininduced IL-6 functions to downregulate its own inducers, TNF-and IL-1 on mRNA and protein levels [51, 52] , with a negative feedback mechanism. As a result, the acute neutrophil and macrophage exudation would be diminished [53] , realizing the protective role of IL-6 on endotoxininduced inflammation [54] . Although nonnegligible amount of IL-6 is induced by TNF-and IL-1 in this condition, TNF-and IL-1 are both produced in a very rapid burst in response to LPS; therefore, the decrease of IL-6 levels here was likely not due to a secondary effect exerted by decline of TNFand IL-1 levels, which should be ascribed to the effect from Control group LPS group 24 48 96",

The therapeutic action of TRQ, in some degree, benefited from its inhibitory effect on the expressions of p38 MAPK and NF-B p65 in lungs by reducing phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, ERK1/2, IKK / , I B-, and NF-B p65. All the present findings specified that the underlying mechanisms of the suppressive actions of TRQ on LPS-induced airway inflammation and mucus overproduction might be due to, at least in part, the suppression on MAPKs and NF-B signaling pathways.

One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to calculate the significance between groups. Pair-wise comparisons of four data sets were performed using Fisher LSD tests. The Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric ANOVA test was used for variables that do not follow a normal distribution when comparing multiple groups.
