A synergistic action of the innate and the adaptive immune system of the host is essential for mounting a durable protective immunity through vaccination. Therefore, the current study aimed to investigate the transcriptome profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to characterize the innate and the adaptive immune response to PRRS Virus (PRRSV) vaccination in Pietrain pigs. The Affymetrix gene chip porcine gene 1.0 ST array was used for the transcriptome profiling of PBMCs collected at immediately before (D0), at one (D1) and 28 days (D28) post PRRSV vaccination with three biological replications. With FDR <0.05 and log2 fold change \u00b11.5 as cutoff criteria, 295 and 115 transcripts were found to be differentially expressed in PBMCs during the stage of innate and adaptive response, respectively. The microarray expression results were technically validated by qRT-PCR. The gene ontology terms such as viral life cycle, regulation of lymphocyte activation, cytokine activity and inflammatory response were enriched during the innate immunity; cytolysis, T cell mediated cytotoxicity, immunoglobulin production were enriched during adaptive immunity to PRRSV vaccination. Significant enrichment of cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, signaling by interleukins, signaling by the B cell receptor (BCR), viral mRNA translation, IFN-gamma pathway and AP-1 transcription factor network pathways were indicating the involvement of altered genes in the antiviral defense. Network analysis revealed that four network modules were functionally involved with the transcriptional network of innate immunity, and five modules were linked to adaptive immunity in PBMCs. The innate immune transcriptional network was found to be regulated by LCK, STAT3, ATP5B, UBB and RSP17. While TGF\u00df1, IL7R, PLOS ONE |",

The PRRSV is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus having two distinct genotypes namely European and North American. In swine, the common symptoms to PRRSV infection has been characterized by prolonged viremia, a deficient induction of innate immunity along with weak and delayed development of neutralizing antibodies [2, 3] which are the major hurdle for control of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS). Therefore, elucidating the main genomic factors involved in developing protective immune response to PRRSV vaccination is of utmost importance.",

The MLV-PRRS vaccination can provide protection at least against reinfection with homologous PRRSV isolates and minimizes the clinical outbreaks [5] . However, the molecular pathways and functional networks involved during the acqusition of immunity to PRRSV via vaccination have not yet been entirely elucidated. It is conceivable that the host response may differ to vaccine antigen to some extend from that of virulent infectious virus. The PRRSV infection has a predilection for the cells of mononuclear phagocytic lineage, like pulmonary alveolar macrophages and blood monocytes [6] . The virulent PRRSV infection causes depletion of immune cells through cytophathic replication preferably within the alveolar macrophage. While the attenuated virus strain used as vaccine is likely unable to cause cytopathic effects, it is able to sensitize the blood macrophage in the same way as virulent virus and induces immune response afterwards [7, 8] . Moreover, the quality of immunity derived from natural PRRSV infection seemed not ideal for the implementation in the vaccine development programs [9] that provoked the molecular characterization of host-vaccine interaction.",

Innate immunity is the initial body defense against invading pathogen, typically occurs within hours to few days of exposure through recognition of conserved epitopes followed by triggering a proinflammatory response [11] . While the adaptive immunity represents the neutralizing antibody response usually developed at 2-4 weeks following antigenic stimulation in a pathogen-specific manner through generating the immunological memory [12] . Antibodies are the essential vaccine induced immune effectors produced by B lymphocytes, and are capable of binding specifically to a pathogen or antigen. Other potential effectors are cytotoxic CD8 + T lymphocytes (CTLs) that may limit the spread of infectious agents by recognizing and killing infected cells or secreting specific antiviral cytokines. The live attenuated viral vaccine elicits the recruitment of antigen specific CD4 + Th cells in the circulation which lead to induce both higher affinity antibody and immune memory, known as T dependent antibody responses [13] . The balanced host immunocompetence with cell-mediated (Th1) and humoral (Th2) immune responses is a proposed selection goal for general disease resistance [14] . Thus, identification of transcriptome signatures for the innate and the adaptive response to PRRSV vaccination might contribute to design a rationale husbandry and breeding scheme for sustainable PRRS control.",

Considering the sampling convenience, time entailed, and animal welfare issues, the peripheral blood samples are much preferred to respiratory tissues/cells for evaluating the host immune responses to PRRSV vaccination. Moreover, unlike the sampling of pulmonary alveolar macrophage, repeated blood sampling is possible from the same individual during the course of immune responses, which is especially useful in controlling the baseline variation [21] . Furthermore, blood based genomic biomarkers can significantly advance the herd health management for PRRS by, for example, allowing the rapid and early prediction of host immunocompetence developed from vaccination [22] . Among the fractions of whole blood, the white blood cells transcriptome profile assume to reflect the transcriptomes of other porcine immune cells, likely what has been demonstrated in case of human [23] .",

The porcine PBMCs have also been studied by some authors for the evaluation of immune response to PRRSV in pigs [8, 25, 26] . However, those studies were mostly focused on expression profiling of selected candidate genes using the in-vitro model. The current study employed an in-vivo PBMCs model to characterize the innate as well as the adaptive immune response to PRRSV vaccine through a global transcriptome approach. In a recent study, we observed that the highest transcriptional response of PRRSV vaccine during first three days occured at 24 h after vaccination; we also observed a plateaued plasma antibody response to PRRSV vaccine at 28 days after primary vaccination [27] . Therefore, we extended our aim herein to investigate the PBMCs transcriptome profiles at day 1, and day 28 post PRRSV vaccination to characterize functional networks associated with the innate and the adaptive immune response to PRRSV in Pietrain pig, respectively.",

            "text": "Transcriptome profiling of PBMCs is receiving more interest in evaluating host immune response to infectious diseases, since PBMCs play central role in immune system. PBMCs are a heterogeneous population of blood cells that include monocytes, lymphocytes (T cells, B cells and NK cells) and dendritic cells. These blood cells patrol through entire body systems and immediately respond to both internal and external stimuli. Researches have shown that porcine PBMCs can display gene expression patterns which are characteristics for certain pathogenic infection, for instance, classical swine fever [41] and tetanus toxoid [42] . In the current study, whole transcriptome profiling of PBMCs was performed in three individual piglets to characterize the gene expression changes associated with the innate as well as the adaptive immune response to PRRSV vaccine in Pietrain pigs. One of the limitations of this study is the use of low number of biological replicates, since a higher number of replicates in the microarray experiment would leads more statistical power, thereby more robust results. Nevertheless, several other groups like ours, have implemented three biological replications in global gene expression studies to characterize the host-PRRSV interactions ( [15, [18] [19] [20] ). We compared the global transcriptome profiles of PBMCs collected at day one (D1) and day 28 (D28) post PRRSV vaccination with that of before vaccination (D0) from the same pigs. In a similar design, transcriptome profiles of pre infected (0h) whole blood samples were compared with that of repeatedly collected post infected samples from the same individuals to characterize the immune responses to PRRSV [22] . The current study yielded a transcriptome dataset comprised of 411 differentially expressed genes in PBMCs after PRRSV vaccination. The robustness of this dataset was confirmed through measuring the expression levels of four selected differentially expressed genes in the same sample by RT-qPCR (Fig 10) . Differential gene expression analysis showed that significant changes in PBMCs transcriptome profiles occurred at day one post PRRSV vaccination in Pietrain pig. The proportion of down regulated genes was higher than the upregulated genes for both contrast pairs ( Table 2 ). The exact mechanism of this global down regulation is yet to be clarified, however, we speculated that this may be attributed by the host genetics. Because, host factors like age [25] and breed [19] in particular, have strong influence on the development of immunity against PRRSV. An aberrant host immune response characterized by the consistent down regulated genes was reported in the PRRSV infected alveolar macrophages of pigs [18] . In the same line, our recent RNA-seq analysis also revealed the global down regulation of altered transcripts in the PRRSV infected lung dendritic cells obtained from Pietrain pigs (Proll et al. 2016, unpublished) . Surprisingly, the gene ontology and pathway analysis revealed a central role in the early vaccine response for genes those are involved in pro-inflammatory responses via cytokine-cytokine receptor signaling pathway, CD28 dependent VAV1 pathway and signaling by interleukins. Over expression of IL8 and CCR7 indicated that PRRSV vaccine is able to induce a proinflammatory response in PBMCs. The development of anti-viral innate immunity launches through sensing the viral protein or nucleic acid by the so-called specific receptor, the pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs), expressed constitutively in the host immune cells [43] , which in turn induce the proinflammatory response [44] . After intramuscular vaccination, vaccine antigen can reach the blood circulation through bypassing the pulmonary alveolar macrophages, where the cytopathic replication takes place. Our results are in line with findings of a recent meta-analysis performed to characterize PRRSV specific immunity from published transcriptome studies [45] . The meta-analysis showed that the differential expression of a cell surface receptor involved in cytokine regulation, TREM1, along with inflammatory responses toll-like receptor genes TLR2, TLR4, cytokines including IL-1b, IL6 and IL18 and chemokine including CCL2 and CCL3 were involved with PRRSV specific host responses [43] . RNA-seq analyses of transcriptome profiles of PRRSV infected porcine tracheobronchial lymphnodes [46] and lung tissue [47] also revealed that PRRSV induces proinflammatory response.",

We observed an overexpression of IFNG at 28 days post vaccination but not at 1 day post vaccination, which signals a delayed induction of innate anti-viral immunity to PRRSV in PBMCs. This finding is in line with previous studies, where several microarray experiments reported a dampened expression of type I IFN response during PRRSV infection indicating an inadequate stimulation of the innate anti-viral immunity [19, 47, 48] . Similarly, a gradual development of the interferon-gamma response to PRRSV infection has been reported in pig [2] . In contrast, a strong elevation of IFN-\u00df at 9 h post infection but a slightly elevated expression of IFN\u03b1 was observed in alveolar macrophage infected with PRRSV [18] . However, Zhang and colleagues stated that PRRSV does not fail to induce IFN\u03b1 or IFN-\u00df mRNA expression in monocyte derived dendritic cells, but protein seems to be blocked post-transcriptionally [49] which demands the investigation of potential role of post transcriptional regulators like miRNAs in PRRSV induced IFN responses.",

In mammalian genome, genes are usually in a default \"off\" state and TFs serve mainly to turn gene expression \"on\" through recognizing specific cis-regulatory DNA sequences at the promoter regions of target genes [50] . The current analysis revealed the involvement of transcription factors including 120-kDa CRA-binding protein, E4F1, NF1, Tel-2a, HEB and NRF-2 with PRRSV vaccine mediated innate immunity; and ONECTU1, SMAD1 and MYC with adaptive immunity in PBMCs (Fig 6) . A total of 27 differentially expressed genes were under regulation of these seven transcription factors identified in PBMCs of PRRSV vaccinated pigs ( Table 4 ), many of altered genes have already been linked to host-PRRSV interaction [15, 17, 18] . Among the TFs identified in this study, MYC has been previously reported to be involved with the swine host response to PRRSV infection [45] . We identified ANGPT2, IFNG, PLAC8 and TGFB1 as potential target genes of MYC transcription factor. The MYC regulates the expression of two immune checkpoint proteins on the tumor cell surface, the innate immune regulator, CD47 (Cluster of Differentiation 47) and the adaptive immune checkpoint, PD-L1 (programmed death-ligand 1) [51] , thereby initiates and maintains the tumorigenesis. The involvement of some other transcription factots like interferon regulatory factors (IRF1, IRF3, IRF5 and IRF8), HMGB1, NFkB, EGR1, BCL3, PYCARD MYCN and NFE2L2 in the transcriptional mechanism of immune response to PRRSV in pig has been identified through a meta-analysis [45] . The actions of transcription factors regulate the unique expression of each gene in the different cell types during development process.",

The cell type enrichment analysis revealed that differentially expressed genes specifically expressed in CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, CD14+ and CD33+ monocytes during early stage; and lymphnode, thymus, BDCA4+ dendritic cells, CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells in later stage of vaccine immunity (Fig 7) . This could indicate that the expression patterns of the genes were not solely due to transcriptional changes but possibly also due to a difference in demographics of PBMCs subsets recruited into the blood. Shimizu et al. [52] observed a remarkable decrease in CD4+ T cells after 3 days PRRSV infection in pigs; this study also reported slight decreases in CD8+ T cells at 3 dpi, followed by substantially increased levels [52] , while at the same time, the ratios of CD4+/CD8+ T cells were significantly lower between day 3 and 28 post-inoculation compared with that of day 0 [52] . However, the proportion of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were found to be significantly decreased for a few days shortly after PRRSV infection, but returned to pre-infection levels on 8-10 days post infection [53] . Renukaradhya et al. [54] performed a comprehensive analysis of innate and adaptive immune responses in dual-virus infected pigs and reported that reduced innate NK-cells population along with increased frequencies of CD4+ T cell, CD8+ T cells and myeloid cells resulted from PRRSV infection in pigs. The PRRSV infection is reported to causes an increase in CD14 + expression throughout the early stage of infection, due to a rise in CD14+ monocytes that differentiate to macrophages and migrate to bronchoalveolar spaces [55] . Silva-Campa et al. [56] observed that PRRSV infection increases the frequency of T cell regulatory cells (Tregs) with the phenotype CD4+, CD8+, CD25+ and Foxp3 high . Therefore, this information on celltype specific gene expression patterns associated with PRRSV vaccine immunity could be an important add-on for the PRRS research.",

Among the hub genes of the network, the lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (LCK) gene was found to be one of the potential hubs of functional network (Fig 8) . LCK encodes p56 (LCK), a non receptor protein-tyrosine kinase of the SRC oncogene family that is involved in transduction of T-cell receptor (TCR)-mediated activation of T-cell. The signal transduction cascades are activated following antigen binding to the TCR and in concert with engagement of other co-receptors and their associated ligands (such as CD4 and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II, CD28, B7, CD8, and MHC I) [58] . Functional enrichment of the network module revealed that the innate immune transcripts are clustered in four modules participating in four major groups of biological functions. The ubiquitination was found to be a key cellular processes significantly upregulated with the transcriptome alteration in PBMCs at early after PRRSV vaccination. We observed the over expression of ubiquitin gene family such as UBC, UBB and UBL5 in PBMCs after vaccination. Moreover, UBC was found to be as one of the potential hubs of the functional network of PRRSV vaccine induced innate immune transcriptomes in PBMCs. The ubiquitination is a post-translational modification process that has been implicated in the regulation of a wide variety of cellular process. The genetic and biochemical evidence suggest that protein ubiquitination and deubiquitination are of fundamental importance in the regulation of the innate and adaptive immune system [59] . The over-expression of porcine ubiquitin specific protease 18 (USP18) is reported to reduce the in-vitro PRRSV replication by altering the cellular distribution of two subunits of NFkB heterodimers (p56 and p50); [60] which indicates the role of USP18 as a host restriction factor during innate immune response to PRRSV. In a subsequent study, the SNP G-1533A polymorphism in the promoter region of the porcine USP18 gene has been suggested as a potential DNA marker for the resistance to PRRSV [61] . Therefore, the ubiquitination process might influence the transcriptional network of PRRSV vaccine induced innate immune response in PBMCs.",

            "text": "The adaptive immunity is specific to the pathogen and the components of the adaptive immune system are also likely contributing to PRRS resistance in pigs. The sub-network analysis of the current microarray study showed the evidence of adaptive B and T cell immunity developed from PRRSV vaccination in pigs. Though adaptive immunity is likely to be predominated by B cell function, however, T lypmhocytes in parallel also have significant contribution in adaptive immunity [62] . The conjugation of viral antigen to a protein carrier (adjuvant) provides foreign peptide antigens that are presented to the immune system and thus recruit antigen-specific CD4+ Th cells which is referred to as T dependent antibody responses [13] . A hallmark of T-dependent responses of live attenuated viral vaccines, is to induce both higheraffinity antibodies and immune memory along with generation of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. Down regulation of immunosuppresive cytokine TGF\u00df1, and upregulation of interferon IFNG and chemokine CXCR2, VAV1, SMAD3, GYMA, GYM5 and transcription factor STAT1 were found to be among regulators of the transcriptional network of vaccine induced adaptive immunity. This is consistent with the hypothesis that there are possibilities for association of PRRS resistance genes with the cells of adaptive immunity, namely the T and B cells [63] . Major biological pathways involved were TGF-beta receptor signaling pathways, AP-1 transcription factor network, granzyme mediated apoptosis, NOTCH2 signaling and IL-12 mediated signaling. The perforin-mediated apoptosis is principally regulated by IL-10 secreted from cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) [62] . Type 1 PRRSV strains have been reported to induce IL-10 production in infected dendritic cells [64] .",

            "text": "Induction of neutralizing antibody (NAb) response is a potential indicator for the vaccinebased adaptive immunity. However, the specificity as well as the level of NAb titre may vary and are likely attributed to establishment of protective immunity. Previous studies suggested that a higher level of PRRSV-specific NAb titre (1:8 to 1:32) in blood is required to prevent the subsequent infection [65] . In this study, PRRSV vaccine induced neutralizing antibody titre (S/P ratio) rose around 1:12 at 28 days post vaccination and remain elevated over 42 days post vaccination (Fig 1) . This was supported by the findings of Meire et al. [2] and Yoon et al. [66] , who reported that serum antibodies with PRRSV-neutralizing activity appear only at periods equal or higher than 28 days post infection. The timing of peak response may vary with type of antibodies, for instance the PRRSV-specific IgM could be detected at 7 days post infection (PI), with titre peaking between 14 and 21 day PI and decreasing to undetectable levels around 40 days PI [67] . The earliest antibodies detected that are directed against the 15kDa N protein which seems to be unable to provide sufficient protection [65] . However, there is a positive correlation between the level of vaccine-induced serum NAb titre and the level of protection against PRRSV infection [68] . Overall, the anamnestic induction of plasma antibody response at day 28 post vaccination was suggestive for the development of adaptive immunity to PRRSV vaccine in the studied piglets. Therefore, it would imply that the gene expression changes in PBMCs at 28 days post primary vaccination may reflect the transcriptional activity associated with adaptive immune response to PRRSV vaccination in Pietrain pigs.",
