            "text": "Background: Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a major respiratory disease-causing agent in birds that leads to significant losses. Dendritic cells (DCs) are specialised cells responsible for sampling antigens and presenting them to T cells, which also play an essential role in recognising and neutralising viruses. Recent studies have suggested that non-coding RNAs may regulate the functional program of DCs. Expression of host non-coding RNAs changes markedly during infectious bronchitis virus infection, but their role in regulating host immune function has not been explored. Here, microarrays of mRNAs, miRNAs, and lncRNAs were globally performed to analyse how avian DCs respond to IBV. Results: First, we found that IBV stimulation did not enhance the maturation ability of avian DCs. Interestingly, inactivated IBV was better able than IBV to induce DC maturation and activate lymphocytes. We identified 1093 up-regulated and 845 down-regulated mRNAs in IBV-infected avian DCs. Gene Ontology analysis suggested that cellular macromolecule and protein location (GO-BP) and transcription factor binding (GO-MF) were abundant in IBV-stimulated avian DCs. Meanwhile, pathway analysis indicated that the oxidative phosphorylation and leukocyte transendothelial migration signalling pathways might be activated in the IBV group. Moreover, alteration of microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) was detected in IBV-stimulated avian DCs. In total, 19 significantly altered (7 up and 12 down) miRNAs and 101 (75 up and 26 down) lncRNAs were identified in the IBV-treated group. Further analysis showed that the actin cytoskeleton and MAPK signal pathway were related to the target genes of IBV-stimulated miRNAs. Finally, our study identified 2 TF-microRNA and 53 TF-microRNA-mRNA interactions involving 1 TF, 2 miRNAs, and 53 mRNAs in IBV-stimulated avian DCs. Conclusions: Our research suggests a new mechanism to explain why IBV actively blocks innate responses needed for inducing immune gene expression and also provides insight into the pathogenic mechanisms of avian IBV.",

            "text": "Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a member of the coronaviridiae family that targets both the meat-type and commercial egg-laying chickens. IBV mainly replicates in the epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, causing lower respiratory tract infections in chickens [1, 2] . The threat of IBV infection is global, as this respiratory virus can cause acute and contagious respiratory infections in poultry, resulting in serious economic losses [3, 4] . The strategy of reducing IBV infection through vaccination has been recognised as a viable option to control IBV and has been somewhat successful [5, 6] . The continuing prevalence of IBV might be attributable to divergent IBV subtypes. Despite efficient protection against genetically similar strains, vaccines may not be effective against all subtypes [7, 8] . Isolated IBV has been associated with proventriculus and kidney lesions [9] . IBV infections are difficult to control mainly due to poor cross-protection between different types of IBV [10, 11] . Thus, effective control of IBV infection is still a major challenge for poultry health management.",

Avian DCs have the unique ability to induce both innate and acquired immune responses and are mainly identified in the primary and secondary lymphoid organs [18, 19] .

Unsurprisingly, major changes in miRNA expression have been shown to be the underlying mechanism triggering the host immune response [24] . For example, miR29c was found to enhance the immune function of DCs, whereas miR375 was suggested to attenuate the antigen-presenting ability of mouse DCs [25, 26] . In addition to evoking an immune response, miR-NAs may also shape host-virus interactions and defend against viral infection [27, 28] . For example, miR674 can target host Mbnl3 to modulate antiviral responses inhibiting H9N2 avian influenza virus replication [29] . Meanwhile, lncRNAs play essential roles in regulating the defence process against viral infection [21] . To explore the potential roles of miRNAs and lncRNAs in IBV infection, we first evaluated the ability of IBV to induce chicken and mouse DC maturation and lymphocyte cell activation. Then, microarrays and bioinformatic analysis were performed to reveal the mechanism underlying the IBV response in avian DCs. Our results provide a better mechanism of the interaction between IBV and avian dendritic cells.",

We performed pathway analysis using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and BioCarta databases. KEGG analysis showed that genes are significantly differentially regulated in the presence of IBV compared with those in control cells; this is particularly pronounced for oxidative phosphorylation and the T cell receptor and B cell receptor signalling pathways.

As we know, miRNAs may function by directly silencing or indirectly reducing their target genes. We predicted the potential targets of DE miRNAs using the MicroRNA Target Prediction and Functional Study Database (miRDB) and TargetScan. We forecasted 124 target genes as DE miR-NAs based on the predictions of both programs (Additional file 4). To gain insight into their functions, GO annotation of these target genes was performed; it identified the intracellular signalling cascade and phosphorus metabolic processes in GO-BP categories, whereas GO-MF included GTPase regulator activity and small GTPase regulator activity (Fig. 3a) . Finally, KEGG pathway analysis based on the predicted target genes indicated that B cell receptors, regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, and MAPK signalling contributed to miRNA target genes with IBV stimulation (Fig. 3b and Additional file 5). Based on the BioCarta database, the primary pathways associated with IBV infection involved skeletal muscle hypertrophy regulated by AKT/mTOR and ALK in cardiac myocytes (Fig. 3c) .

Global lncRNA expression levels were evaluated in avian BMDCs stimulated with IBV, and 101 (26 down-regulated, 75 upregulated) DE lncRNAs were identified among a total of 3900 lncRNAs (Fig. 4a , b, and Additional file 5). Because lncRNAs function through cis-, trans-, or co-expression with target genes, we then predicted the potential cis, trans and co-expressed genes among the DE lncRNAs. We identified 30 cis and 3941 trans targets, as well as 203 co-expressed mRNAs (Additional file 6). The interactions among co-expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs were mapped and are presented in Fig. 4e . Further analyses of the GO categorisation and KEGG pathways were performed based on cis and trans target to illustrate the functions of lncRNAs associated with IBV infection. The results of GO-BP analysis showed positive regulation of coronary vasculature development, cardiac muscle development, and nuclear envelope reassembly ( Fig. 4c and Additional file 7). KEGG pathway analysis indicated the peroxisome, phenylalanine, and lysosome signal pathways were associated with IBV infection of avian BMDCs ( Fig. 4d and Additional file 7).",

            "text": "The strategy of controlling IBV through vaccination has been partially successful, but various subtypes of IBV still evade vaccines [40] . DCs change during the maintenance of immune responses, and their maturation is pivotal to the development of immunity against many viruses. The maturation of avian BMDCs is essential to the development of the immune system. Viruses, therefore, have evolved strategies to target this process [41, 42] . In our studies, IBV-stimulated DCs (including mouse and avian DCs) did not significantly increase their expression of the surface markers CD40 and CD86, indicating that IBV might escape recognition by avian DCs. This phenomenon might be attributed to failed activation of toll-like receptor (TLR) signalling, which is related to the recognition of various dangerous signals [43, 44] . Previous studies have suggested that the binding of IBV to epithelial cells initiates infection [45] . Recent studies suggest that the binding progress is sialic acid-dependent and that chicken homologues of the human receptors DC-SIGN and L-SIGN are part of an IBV receptor complex [46] [47] [48] . In our study, mRNA microarray results indicated that TLR7, TLR3, and TLR21 were all downregulated in IBV-stimulated avian DCs. The decreased expression of TLR3 suggested that IBV might be unsuccessfully replicated in avian DCs (Additional file 11). Receptors, such as TLR3 and TLR7, may initiate the local tracheal innate immune response upon IBV recognition [49, 50] . The accordance of TLR results with surface marker results suggest that IBV successfully escaped recognition by avian DCs. A key role of DCs is to process and present specific antigens to na\u00efve T cells [51] [52] [53] . Consistent with the surface marker results, cell proliferation studies found that both IBV-treated avian and mouse DCs failed to stimulate the proliferation of na\u00efve T cells in MLR [54, 55] . In contrast, inactivated IBV strongly activated the primary T cell, which was correlated with greater expression of the co-stimulatory molecules CD40 and CD86 by inactivated IBV-stimulated DCs. Recent study indicating that host shutoff by IBV plays an important role in antagonizing the host's innate immune response and demonstrate that 5b is a functional equivalent of nsp1, charge for the host shutoff. These results show that avian DCs react more strongly to inactivated IBV than to IBV in terms of enhanced maturation and ability to activate lymphocytes.",

Alteration of cellular microRNA expression levels during viral infection is a component of the host-virus interaction [56] . Viruses not only influence the expression of microRNAs in infected cells but also encode viral small RNAs that regulate the replication of viruses, as reported for PRRSV and Dengue virus [57, 58] . Host microRNAs, such as avian miRNAs, might enhance the immune response or be utilised by viruses to assist with their replication. For example, miR140 is a post-transcriptional regulator influencing the expression of SPP1, which plays important roles in the inflammatory response, calcification, organ development, and immune cell function [59, 60] . Cellular microRNAs (miR-323, miR-491, and miR-654) have also been found to regulate the replication of H1N1 influenza virus by targeting the PB1 gene [61] .",

Initially, 991 chicken microRNAs were investigated, and 19 differentially expressed microRNAs were identified in IBV-infected avian DCs. Among these miRNAs, gga-miR-135A, gga-miR-7471, gga-miR-7453, gga-miR-7443, gga-miR-1695, gga-miR-1772, and gga-miR-6669 were significantly up-regulated in IBV-infected avian BMDCs, Fig. 5 Results of the qPCR analysis of select mRNAs, miRNAs and lncRNAs following stimulation by IBV stimulation (All of the experiments were performed at least in triplicate. Significant differences between the treated and control groups are expressed as *P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01, respectively) a Expression levels of mRNAs involved in the leukocyte trans-endothelial migration signal pathway. b Expression levels of microRNAs qPCR results of the significantly up-regulated or down-regulated microRNAs in the IBV-stimulated group whereas 12 other gga-microRNAs were down-regulated. Among the microRNAs that decreased, miR-21 was associated with lymphoma development, which might be a possible mechanism of lymphocyte activation [62, 63] . Recent studies have reported the functions of many gga-miRNAs, including gga-miR-1454, gga-miR-215-5p, gga-miR-3538, gga-miR-2954, and gga-miR-1a-3p [20, 64, 65] . One of these studies suggested that gga-miR-215-5p exhibited significantly varied expression levels between H9N2-infected and non-infected chicken embryo fibroblasts [65] . Further bioinformatic analysis to identify the target genes of gga-microRNAs revealed that IBV infection not only impacted the TGF-beta and MAPK signalling pathways but also influenced the T cell receptor and B cell receptor signalling pathways (Fig. 3) . Previous research suggested that the complement system was important in T cell activation, as it triggers the antiviral state of neighbouring cells and an influx of T cells to the local tissue [66] . Several studies have shown that the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) influences susceptibility to IBV infection [67, 68] . Meanwhile, lncRNAs are involved in defending against viral infection. Transcriptional regulation by lncRNAs can occur in either a cisor transmanner. Of the down-regulated lncRNAs, MANBAL and POMT2 were correlated with mannose, which might be a receptor for viral entry [69, 70] . Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is involved in the protection of the host against viral infections, such as infections with influenza A virus, hepatitis C virus, and Ebola virus [71] [72] [73] . In chickens, MBL serum concentrations have also been associated with IBV infection [4] . Additionally, we found that cisand trans-targeting genes contribute to the peroxisome, phenylalanine, and lysosome signalling pathways.",

Our study identified two TF-microRNA networks in the IBV-stimulated group (CEBPA-gga-miR1772 and CEBPA-gga-miR21). CEBPA is a transcription factor involved in the differentiation of certain blood cells. The encoded protein can interact with CDK2 and CDK4, thereby inhibiting these kinases and causing arrest of growth in cultured cells. Additionally, CEBPA is essential for myeloid lineage commitment and is therefore required for both normal mature granulocyte formation and the development of abnormal acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) [74, 75] . On the other hand, gga-miR-21 was suggested to inhibit chicken pre-adipocyte proliferation by down-regulating Kruppel-like factor 5 [72] . This suggests that gga-miR-21 can be regulated as a defence mechanism to fight against viral infection in birds. To further explore the mechanisms involved, we construct TF-microRNA-mRNA networks, which provided insights into the interplays between microRNAs and TF and hinted at the mechanisms underlying the innate cellular response induced by IBV stimulation.",
