            "text": "Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), a herpesvirus, is a ubiquitously distributed pathogen that causes severe disease in immunosuppressed patients and infected newborns. Efforts are underway to prepare effective subunit vaccines and therapies including antiviral antibodies. However, current vaccine efforts are hampered by the lack of information on protective immune responses against HCMV. Characterizing the B-cell response in healthy infected individuals could aid in the design of optimal vaccines and therapeutic antibodies. To address this problem, we determined, for the first time, the Bcell repertoire against glycoprotein B (gB) of HCMV in different healthy HCMV seropositive individuals in an unbiased fashion. HCMV gB represents a dominant viral antigenic determinant for induction of neutralizing antibodies during infection and is also a component in several experimental HCMV vaccines currently being tested in humans. Our findings have revealed that the vast majority (.90%) of gB-specific antibodies secreted from B-cell clones do not have virus neutralizing activity. Most neutralizing antibodies were found to bind to epitopes not located within the previously characterized antigenic domains (AD) of gB. To map the target structures of these neutralizing antibodies, we generated a 3D model of HCMV gB and used it to identify surface exposed protein domains. Two protein domains were found to be targeted by the majority of neutralizing antibodies. Domain I, located between amino acids (aa) 133-343 of gB and domain II, a discontinuous domain, built from residues 121-132 and 344-438. Analysis of a larger panel of human sera from HCMV seropositive individuals revealed positivity rates of .50% against domain I and .90% against domain II, respectively. In accordance with previous nomenclature the domains were designated AD-4 (Dom II) and AD-5 (Dom I), respectively. Collectively, these data will contribute to optimal vaccine design and development of antibodies effective in passive immunization.",

Importantly, an effective anti-HCMV vaccine will need to protect the vaccine from HCMV infection/disease as well as in the case of pregnant women, the developing fetus. Transfer of protective maternal antibodies to the fetus will be critical in this respect and a study of passive transfer of immunoglobulins to pregnant mothers has supported a role of antibodies in reducing the risk for congenital infection [8, 9] . Also, naturally acquired maternal immunity contributes to prevention of congenital HCMV infection [10] . Although correlates of protection from HCMV infection are poorly understood, it can be predicted that humoral immune responses to the envelope glycoproteins will be particularly important since antibodies directed against these antigens can neutralize virus infectivity directly and/or induce immunoglobulin Fc-receptor mediated effector functions such as antibody dependent cytotoxicity and/or complement mediated effects which can lead to elimination of infected cells [11] .",

With respect to induction of neutralizing antibodies during natural infection, the glycoprotein (g) B dominates, but additional antigens such as the gM/gN complex and the gH/gL complex have also been identified as highly immunogenic [14] [15] [16] . Antibodies directed against gB can be detected in all naturally infected individuals [17] . Moreover, a major fraction of neutralizing antibodies in human sera seems to be directed against gB and the overall neutralizing capacity in sera from HCMV-seropositive donors correlates with anti-gB antibody titer [18] . In addition, anti-gB antibodies are effective in preventing cell-to-cell spread [19] . In the guinea pig CMV model, immunization with gB DNA vaccines confers protection from infection [20] . In a recent study protection from brain pathology in murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infected mice was accomplished by passive transfer of a gBspecific monoclonal antibody (mab) [21] . Thus, gB is an attractive antigen for inclusion in a human vaccine and has been part of a number of experimental vaccines [22, 23] . In fact, a recent phase 2 trial using recombinant gB as vaccine has shown significant protection from infection [24] . However, the spectrum of anti-gB antibodies developing during infection remains poorly defined.",

It has been shown to bind to a variety of cell surface molecules such as heparan sulfate proteoglycans, integrin heterodimers and platelet-derived growth factor-a receptor [25] [26] [27] . In addition, HCMV gB has been shown to mediate fusion of viral and cellular membranes [28] [29] [30] . The protein is essential for viral entry and cell-to-cell spread but not for virion attachment, assembly or egress [31] . Three antigenic domains (AD) have been described previously. AD-1 consists of approximately 80aa between positions 560 and 640 of gB of HCMV strain AD169 [32] . It is the immunodominant region of gB since nearly all sera from HCMV-infected individuals recognize AD-1 [33] . Antibodies that bind to AD-1 can have virus neutralizing capacity as indicated by the fact that a number of AD-1-specific human mabs have been isolated which show various degrees of neutralizing activity [34, 35] . Polyclonal AD-1-specific antibodies, purified from human serum, are incapable of completely neutralizing HCMV even at high concentration, indicating that AD-1 is bound by antibodies with widely differing neutralizing activity [36] . It has been suggested that the competitive binding of neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies to AD-1 may represent a mechanism to evade efficient neutralization of cell free virus [36] .",

Site I is common to all HCMV strains and induces neutralizing antibodies, whereas the aa sequence of site II differs between strains and is recognized by strain specific antibodies which are incapable of neutralization in vitro [37] . The overall immunogenicity of AD-2 is lower than that of AD-1 since only about 50% of human sera from HCMV-infected donors have antibodies against this determinant [17] . An additional linear aa sequence, AD-3, recognized by gB-specific antibodies in human sera includes epitopes at the intraluminal/intraviral part of the molecule [38, 39] . However, antibodies binding to these determinants are non-neutralizing as can be expected from the localization of AD-3 within the molecule. Additional protein domains which are bound by murine mabs have been identified, but whether these regions are relevant in the context of antibody response during natural infection is unknown [40] . The gB-specific human monoclonal antibodies for which the binding sites has been identified react with either AD-1 or AD-2 [35, 41] .",

Understanding the repertoire of antiviral antibodies induced during infection is a necessary prerequisite to defining the protective activities of an antiviral antibody response. The isolation of antigen specific memory B cells and subsequent stimulation to antibody producing cells provides a powerful tool to study the antibody repertoire in infected individuals. We have used this approach to analyze the antibody repertoire against glycoprotein B (gB) of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), a major antigen for the induction of antiviral antibodies during infection and a constituent of experimental vaccines in humans. We find in different infected individuals that the vast majority of gB-specific B cells produce antibodies that cannot neutralize free virus. Antibodies with antiviral capacity target two domains of gB that have not been previously identified. The identification of these new antigenic domains was possible with the aid of a 3D molecular model of HCMV gB. Our results will be useful for vaccine development since comparison of the immune response after natural infection with that induced by vaccination can be readily accomplished. Moreover, neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies could constitute powerful therapeutics to combat the infection in populations at risk for HCMV disease.",

The anti-gB antibody titer was comparable in this group (Fig. S2A ) while the neutralization titer varied significantly, which is not uncommon for HCMV-infected individuals (Fig. S2B ). From these 7 donors we were able to analyze a total of 888 clonal IgG gB-binding culture supernatants for epitope specificity towards the well-known antigenic domains AD-1 and AD-2 [45] as well as neutralizing capacity against HCMV AD169 on fibroblasts. With respect to binding of gB protein domains we found a high frequency of antibodies binding to the AD-1 epitope (mean 38.1%) in all individuals correlating with earlier findings that up to 50% of gBspecific IgG in sera might be directed against the AD-1 epitope (Table 1 ) [38] . Interestingly, only few of the AD-1-specific antibodies were able to neutralize HCMV in vitro (mean 2.0%, range 0-6%; Table 1 ). The frequency of clones producing AD-2specific IgG was low (Table 1 ) and in only 3 out of 7 individuals were we able to retrieve AD-2-specific memory B cells, correlating with earlier data that this specificity is found only in approximately 50% of HCMV infected individuals [17] . None of the rare AD-2specific antibodies was neutralizing in vitro. A high frequency of clones from all individuals did not react with either AD-1 or AD-2 (range 40-86%; Table 1 ). Importantly, among these antibodies a significant number was able to neutralize HCMV in vitro (17% out of 429 clones; Table 1 ). A summary of the neutralizing capacity of the gB-specific B-cell supernatants of 5 donors from which we were able to isolate B cells that secreted neutralizing antibodies is shown in Fig. S2C . We conclude from this analysis that the memory B-cell repertoire against gB is dominated by antibodies that do not neutralize the virus and that most neutralizing antibodies bind to a so far unknown antigenic site.",

According to the model, both the overall structure of the HCMV gB monomer and the organization of the subunits in the trimer were highly similar to that of HSV-1 gB, as expected from the degree of sequence similarity of gB between human herpesviruses (28% identity and 40% similarity between HSV-1 gB and HCMV strain AD169 gB). The individual domains I to V, which were previously defined based on the HSV-1 gB structure, can be clearly identified from the homology model of HCMV gB. With respect to potential antibody binding structures, the protein domains (Dom) I and II were of particular interest since they are located within aa 100-448 of gB. Dom I (Ile 133 to Thr 343 ) constitutes part of the trimer interface and is located proximal to the membrane, potentially containing the fusion domain [47] . The discontinuous Dom II is composed of two separate segments comprising residues Leu 121 to Asn 132 and Cys 344 to Ser 438 (Fig. 3) . Either domain contains a single disulfide bond which helps to stabilize the conformation of the respective protein domain [48] .",

In both cases the cloning strategy involved the attachment of a HA epitope tag at the amino terminus of the respective peptide in order to facilitate detection. Dom I comprised aa 133-343 of gB. The Dom IIspecific peptide consisted of the gB-specific residues 112-132 and 344-438 joined by a 5 aa (Ile-Ala-Gly-Ser-Gly) synthetic linker sequence. Following transient expression of the peptides in Cos7 cells, antibody binding was analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence. All four antibodies from Group A were reactive with the Dom I-specific peptide, whereas all Group B mabs recognized Dom II ( Fig. 4 and Table 2 ). The crystal structure of HSV-1 gB as well as the model of HCMV gB predict that for Dom I and Dom II discontinuous sequence stretches are essential for formation of either domain. Shorter protein fragments would be expected not to fold correctly. We tested this assumption by expressing a Dom II variant with five amino acids deleted at the carboxyl-terminus and observed complete loss of binding of all Group A-specific antibodies. Likewise, the continuous part of Dom I (residues 140-255) showed no antibody binding capacity (data not shown). Thus, further resolution of antibody epitopes will be possible only by generation of point mutants in Dom I and Dom II, respectively. Having identified Dom I and Dom II as new targets for neutralizing antibodies, we re-tested clonal antibody supernatants from 4 individuals to obtain information about the overall frequency of Dom I-and Dom II-specific antibodies in HCMV infected individuals. As shown in Table 1 , the frequency of Dom I and Dom II specific memory B cells was variable among different donors and in most cases considerably lower as compared to AD-1-specific B cells.",

Moreover, when a selected set (n = 10) of non-neutralizing antibodies directed against different antigenic domains of gB was tested in concentrations up to 5 mg/ml in the presence of complement we observed no significant increase in neutralization capacity which is in agreement with previous reports on gB-specific human mabs (data not shown) [35] .

We therefore analyzed at which stage of the infection the mabs exerted their action. To assay influence on attachment, virus/antibody mixtures were added to target cells at 4uC and the number of HCMV DNA copies attached to the cells was determined by quantitative real time PCR. Neither Dom I-nor Dom II-specific antibodies inhibited attachment of virions, indicating that the mabs did not block receptor binding of HCMV (Fig. 5A ). In accordance with previous reports, heparin almost completely prevented virus attachment, whereas the AD-2-specific antibody C23 had no effect on virus binding [27, 51] . The slight increase of bound virus in the presence of some antibodies as compared to control might reflect deposition of antibody/virus aggregates on the surface of cells. We also determined activity of the mabs towards virus that is already adsorbed to cells. To this end, virus was preadsorbed to cells for 1 h at 4uC before antibody was added. Both Dom I-and Dom IIspecific antibodies were capable of neutralizing HCMV at a postadsorption step, whereas non-neutralizing antibodies had no effect (Fig. 5B) . The higher antibody concentration that was required to completely neutralize adsorbed virus is explained by the need to block fusion of an already adsorbed virus particle.",

            "text": "Competitive binding of neutralizing and non-neutralizing human mabs has been described for gB [35] . We tested whether a similar phenomenon occurs for Dom I-or Dom II-specific neutralizing antibodies. A total of 14 non-neutralizing mabs, directed against different antigenic regions of gB was analyzed in neutralization assays for competition with Dom I-or Dom IIspecific mabs (SM10, 1G2, SM5-1). In no case did we observe a reduction in neutralizing capacity by addition of non-neutralizing mabs. The result of a representative analysis is shown in Fig. 6A . Although these data indicated that reduction of neutralizing activity by competing non-neutralizing mabs is not common for Dom I-and Dom II-specific antibodies, it is difficult to assess the relevance of this finding for the situation in human sera. For AD-1specific antibodies it has clearly been shown that the sum of antibodies, as present in human sera, is not capable of completely neutralizing infectious virus, indicating that non-neutralizing antibodies can constitute a significant fraction of the entire AD-1-specific IgG fraction [36] . To obtain more information on the neutralizing capacity of Dom II-specific antibodies in human sera, we purified Dom II as a GST fusion protein following expression in E. coli (Fig. S3A) . The bacterially derived peptide retained the capacity to bind all Group B mabs and the affinity of mab SM5-1 was similar for gB and Dom II (Fig. S3B ). Circular dichroism spectra indicated a homogeneous three-dimensional structure (Fig.  S3C ). Using this protein, polyclonal Dom II-specific antibodies were affinity-purified from pooled human sera (Fig. S4) . The affinity-purified IgG preparation was then tested in neutralization assays. 50% neutralization of input viral infectivity was achieved with an IgG concentration of approximately 0.2 mg/ml which is within the same concentration range as the Dom II-specific mabs (Fig. 6B) . In summary, these data provided evidence that gB Dom II not only represents an immunogenic domain on gB, but also that antibodies binding to it in general have potent neutralizing capacity. Similar experiments using Dom I could not be carried out since the Dom I domain does not fold correctly after prokaryotic expression and thus antigen for affinity purification of antibodies could not be generated.",

A total of 80 randomly selected sera from HCMV seropositive individuals, as determined by a commercially available ELISA test, was analyzed. Ten sera from HCMV negative donors served as controls.

Besides being irrelevant for the infection, non-neutralizing antibodies might have positive or negative effects. Effector functions mediated via the Fcportion of the antibodies such as ADCC and/or complement fixation may contribute to elimination of infected cells and thus could lead to enhanced clearance of these cells. That such mechanisms are operative in vivo has been shown in different viral systems, including herpesviruses, but not for HCMV [54, 55] . On the other hand, infection-enhancing effects could be contributed by mechanisms such as competition of non-neutralizing antibodies for binding to neutralizing epitopes or enhanced infection of Fcreceptor bearing cells such as monocytes, which is one of the major target cell population for HCMV infection in vivo [56] .",

These antibodies were negative for recognition of the bacterial fusion protein containing AD-1 (aa 484-650). Thus, the location of the antibody binding site(s) remains unknown. There is the possibility that residues 447-484 and 650-687 contain additional epitopes since they are not represented by the AD-1 fusion peptide. However, this seems unlikely. The more plausible explanation for our finding is that the region between aa 447-687 contains additional conformational epitopes that are not formed in the bacterial fusion protein. Our previous analyses have shown that AD-1 induces a multitude of antibodies with different binding characteristics, even when assayed as bacterial fusion proteins or synthetic peptides [33] . Thus, it would be not surprising that this region of gB contains additional epitopes which are present only on the native protein. The large fraction of antibodies falling in this category also supports this possibility. A corresponding protein region of HSV-1 gB was found to contain a ''pseudocontinuous'' epitope, further supporting our interpretation [57] . However, no matter what the underlying mechanism of this finding is, antibodies binding within the 447-687 region of gB were nonneutralizing.",

            "text": "Antibodies which show potent in vitro neutralizing activity were found to bind to two previously unknown protein domains, namely AD-4 and AD-5. Because this was demonstrated in most donors, it is unlikely a sampling artifact. The antigenicity of these domains is also indicated by the fact that in randomly selected serum samples from HCMV-seropositive donors we found positivity rates of .90% for AD-4 and .50% for AD-5, which identified both domains as strongly antigenic structures on gB. Comparable positivity rates among sera from HCMV infected individuals have been reported for AD-1 and AD-2, respectively, and were confirmed in the current analysis [17] . A distinct difference between AD-4/AD-5 and AD-1/AD-2 is the functional antiviral activity of the domain specific antibodies. AD-1 is bound by virus neutralizing and non-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies which can compete for binding to the domain [35, 58] . Affinity purified AD-1-specific IgG fractions from pooled human sera were shown to have neutralizing capacity not exceeding 50%, indicating that during natural infection a considerable proportion of competing non-neutralizing antibodies are induced [36] . The incomplete neutralizing capacity of polyclonal anti-AD-1 antibodies has been suggested to provide the virus with an effective mechanism to evade the humoral immune response. Likewise, AD-2 harbors two different antibody binding sites which are bound by neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies, respectively [37] . The situation seems to be different for AD-4 and AD-5 in that almost all human monoclonal antibodies that have been obtained so far have potent virus neutralizing activity. Moreover, the affinity-purified AD-4specific polyclonal human IgG fraction had a neutralizing titer that was comparable to the monoclonal antibodies with 50% neutralization in the low nanomolar range. Thus, it seems unlikely that AD-4 induces significant concentrations of non-neutralizing antibodies that compete with neutralizing antibodies for binding to the domain. Whether this correlation also holds true for AD-5 needs to be determined in further studies.",

In immunocompromised hosts, when the development of a de novo humoral immune response is impaired, reinfection with a different HCMV isolate might result in clinical symptoms, due to unrestricted replication of the 'new' virus strain [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] . However, we have no information on whether reinfection of seropositive individuals is inevitable upon contact with a different HCMV strain or whether some infected hosts develop an immune response which prevents reinfection. It will be important to analyze whether such ''absolute controllers'' exist and what the correlate of protection is. In the HIV field it has clearly been shown, that a small fraction of infected individuals can develop broadly neutralizing antibodies which control the viral mutants that develop during infection and prevent progression to disease [53, 66] . In the case of HCMV, it will be interesting to determine whether production of antibodies against the individual antigenic domains of gB or, for that matter additional envelope glycoproteins, correlates with reduced susceptibility to reinfection. Of note, the gB protein region harboring AD-4 and AD-5 is highly conserved between different HCMV isolates (Fig. S5) and is situated well outside the polymorphic protein segments that have been defined [67] .",

To express Dom II (AD-4), the nucleotide sequence coding for aa 112-132 and 344-438 was chemically synthesized by GeneArt, Germany. The two parts were joined by a nucleotide linker coding for the sequence Ile-Ala-Gly-Ser-Gly and inserted in pcUL132-sigHA to give rise to pcAD-4. To express Dom I (pcAD-5) the nucleotide sequence coding for aa 133-343 were inserted into pcUL132sigHA.

Two loop regions (Val 306 to Glu 317 and Leu 439 to His 468 of HCMV gB) were not resolved in the reference structure and could therefore not be modelled. All images were generated with Accelrys DS Visualizer v2.0.1. The quality of the model was validated using ProSA [74] and PROCHECK [75] . ProSA analysis reveals that the overall model quality (Z-score = 26.22) is quite similar to that of the template crystal structure (Z-score = 27.84). Both values are within the range of z-scores typically found for crystal structures of proteins of similar size. In addition, the residue energy profiles of template and target structure are very similar indicating that the modelling did not place amino acids in an unfavourable environment. In addition, analysis of the backbone geometry shows that that 87.5% of all residues of HCMV gB are located in the most favourable regions of the Ramachandran Plot. This value corresponds to a crystal structure with 2.0-2.5 \u00c5 resolution. The HCMV gB model will be made available by the authors upon request.",
