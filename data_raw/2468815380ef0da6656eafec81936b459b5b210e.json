            "text": "Mystery patient drills using simulated patients have been used in hospitals to assess emergency preparedness for infectious diseases, but these drills have seldom been reported in primary care settings. We conducted three rounds of mystery patient drills designed to simulate either influenza-like illness (ILI) or measles at 41 community health centers in New York City from April 2015 through December 2016. Among 50 drills conducted, 49 successfully screened the patient-actor (defined as provision of a mask or referral to the medical team given concern of infection requiring potential isolation), with 35 (70%) drills completing screening without any challenges. In 47 drills, the patient was subsequently isolated (defined as placement in a closed room to limit transmission), with 29 (58%) drills completing isolation without any challenges. Patient-actors simulating ILI were more likely to be masked than those simulating measles (93% vs. 59%, p = 0.007). Median time to screening was 2 min (interquartile range [IQR] 2-6 min) and subsequently to isolation was 1 min (IQR 0-2 min). Approximately 95% of participants reported the drill was realistic and prepared them to deal with the hazards addressed. Qualitative analysis revealed recurring themes for strengths (e.g., established protocols, effective communication) and areas for improvement (e.g., hand hygiene, explaining isolation rationale). We conclude that mystery patient drills are an effective and feasible longitudinal collaboration between health departments and primary care clinics to assess and inform emergency preparedness for infectious diseases.",

Several studies have used \"mystery patient drills\"-nonotice drills with patient-actors simulating diseases-for avian influenza [3] [4] [5] , smallpox [6] , inhalational anthrax [7] , Ebola virus disease [8, 9] , Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus [10] , and measles [10] . These studies enabled assessment of current emergency preparedness 1 3 protocols, evaluation of the effectiveness of specific procedures within protocols (e.g., use of electronic health record workflows to guide screening), and identification of strengths and areas for improvement. Activities that assess and improve emergency preparedness for infectious diseases in the primary care setting have been relatively underreported, with most published studies either highlighting this as an area of need [11] [12] [13] [14] or showing the willingness of primary care practitioners to help in emergency preparedness and response [11, 15] .",

Participating clinics that were designated Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs)-organizations receiving grants under United States' Health Center Program statutes (Section 330 of the Public Health Service Act) [17] -were also provided $1000 USD to purchase supplies or equipment related to emergency management, as an incentive to increase participation.

Time to isolation was measured from when patient was screened to when she or he was placed in a separate and closed room. As a baseline, both time to screening and time to isolation were considered appropriate if performed in under 10 min. The processes of screening and isolation were also graded qualitatively using adapted HSEEP criteria: performed without challenges (P), performed with some challenges (S), performed with major challenges (M), and unable to perform (U). The PCEPN controller concluded the drill when the health care provider began his or her medical evaluation (e.g., taking vital signs, asking the patient's permission to examine the reported rash). If the patient waited for 15 min without being seen, a trusted agent would inform triage staff to call the \"patient,\" without disclosing the drill, and proceed with screening to determine if isolation was needed, and, if needed, offer the patient a surgical mask and call a clinical staff member to receive the patient and place him or her in a designated isolation room or space for medical evaluation.",

While the median time to screening from entry was 2 min, about one in six drills took more than 10 min to screen the patient. Furthermore, 30% of drills had at least some challenges with screening. After the patient-actor was screened, median time to isolation was only 1 min, with no drill taking longer than 5 min to isolate the patient-actor. However, in terms of quality, 42% of drills had at least some challenges with isolation. Thus, while most clinics screened and isolated efficiently and effectively, there remains substantial room for improvement. In rounds 2 and 3, median time to screening was 2 min compared with 5 min in the first round, though this reduction was not statistically significant. Similarly, there was no statistically significant difference in terms of quality of screening; 65% of drills screened the patient-actor without any challenges in round 1, compared with 75% in round 3. Interestingly, median time to isolation increased in later rounds of the drill, from under 1 min in round 1 to 2 min in round 3 (p trend = 0.022). However, there was no statistically significant trend in terms of quality of isolation; 50% of drills isolated the patient-actor without any challenges in round 1, compared to 69% in round 3. There are multiple explanations for these findings. This study was likely underpowered to detect smaller but still clinically significant differences. While the increase in time to isolation may be due to random error, it may also be due to a clinically significant (but statistically nonsignificant) improvement in quality of isolation. Supporting evidence for the latter explanation is that clinics identified several areas for improvement regarding isolation (e.g., explaining to the patient the rationale for isolation, performing hand hygiene, using signage to indicate occupied rooms), which clinics may have incorporated in later rounds, thereby lengthening the time to isolation.",

Even among those who were masked, one in five were not masked at the first point of contact in the clinic. We also found that actors simulating ILI were much more likely to be masked than those simulating measles (93% vs. 59%, p = 0.007), a finding that persisted when restricting the analysis to only patients who were masked at the first point of contact (77% vs. 41%, p = 0.026). This association may reflect causation since clarifying indications for masking to include a measleslike case of fever and rash without respiratory symptoms was consistently identified as an area for improvement among drill participants. Furthermore, a greater proportion of cases were masked at the first point of contact in later rounds of the drill (47% in round 1 vs. 75% in round 3, p trend = 0.048), which may reflect improvement by round. However, it may also be due to confounding, as there was a marginally nonsignificant trend for drill scenario by round, with a greater proportion of drills being ILI in later rounds (58% in round 1 to 81% in round 3; p trend = 0.08). Nevertheless, these findings highlight the importance of ensuring masking indications also include potentially infectious patients without respiratory symptoms. For measles, this is especially important since it is highly contagious and has recently re-emerged in the face of declining immunization coverage [20] . Newly emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases (a recent notable example includes Ebola virus disease [21] ) may also present without respiratory symptoms.",
