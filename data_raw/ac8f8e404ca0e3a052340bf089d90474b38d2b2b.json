We generated monocytederived dendritic cells (MDDCs) from individuals with AA or AG genotype of rs4804803 to study the viral replication and immune responses for functional validation. A total of 574 DNA samples were genotyped, including 176 DF, 135 DHF, 143 other non-dengue febrile illnesses (OFI) and 120 population controls. A strong association between GG/AG genotypes of rs4804803 and risk of DHF was found when compared among DF, OFI and controls (p = 0.004, 3610 25 and 0.001, respectively). The AA genotype was associated with protection against dengue infection compared with OFI and controls (p = 0.002 and 0.020, respectively). Moreover, MDDCs from individuals with AG genotype with a higher cell surface DC-SIGN expression had a significantly higher TNFa, IL-12p40, and IP-10 production than those with AA genotype in response to dengue infection. However, the viral replication in MDDCs with AG genotype was significantly lower than those with AA genotype. With both genotypes, MDDCs revealed an increase in viral replication following the addition of anti-IP-10 neutralizing antibody.",

            "text": "Dengue viruses (DEN) are arthropod-borne flaviviruses that cause dengue fever (DF) with significant morbidity and mortality in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. There are four serotypes of dengue viruses (DEN types 1-4). Classic DF is a selflimited illness characterized by fever, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, and abdominal pain. Since the 1950s, a more severe form of the disease, dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), has been recognized worldwide [1] . Patients who develop DHF typically have initial symptoms similar to those in DF patients, but develop cytokinestorm-like plasma leakage manifested by hemoconcentration, thrombocytopenia, ascites, and pleural effusion near the defeverence stage [2] . DHF pathogenesis has been attributed to viral virulence versus immune enhancement; however, that has been the subject of debate for many years [2, 3] . The innate immune system is the first line of host defense against pathogens and is involved in early recognition and uptake of microbes by the host's professional phagocytes such as dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages, through germline-encoded recep-tors, known as pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) [4] . These PRRs recognize microbial antigens and initiate innate immune responses followed by adaptive immunity [5] . PRRs are involved in phagocytosis, antigen presentation, and they trigger intracellular signaling and cytokine secretion [5] . PRR polymorphisms may therefore affect virus entry, replication, and immunity.",

One of these SNPs represents a guanine (G) to adenine (A) transition at position 2336 within the CD209 gene promoter (rs4804803). This variant has been associated with an increased risk for parenteral acquisition of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection [15] , severity of dengue infection [16] , and confered high susceptibility to tuberculosis in a South African cohort [17] . Nevertheless, Vannberg et al. found that G variant allele of rs4804803 was associated with protection against tuberculosis in individuals from sub-Saharan Africa [18] . This variant affects CD209 promoter activity with multiple transcription factor binding sites for the Sp1/GATA1/CACCC-and CACbinding transcription factors in a transfection study [16] . As an in vitro study of promoter activity might not reflect an actual functional association, we aimed to test whether the rs4804803 SNP in the promoter region of CD209 was associated with the susceptibility to DF and/or DHF in Taiwanese, and whether monocyte-derived DCs from humans with various genotypes of rs4804803 would reveal differences in DC-SIGN membrane expression and implicate the viral replication and immune reactions after DEN infection.",

            "text": "Dengue fever (DF) is an arthropod-borne disease that is prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. DC-SIGN [dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3 (ICAM-3)-grabbing non-integrin] is a major receptor for dengue infection. DC-SIGN, also called CD209, expresses on dendritic cells (DCs) that bind to ICAM-3, which is expressed on T cells to facilitate the initial interaction between DCs and T cells. Variations in the CD209 promoter (2336 A/G; rs4804803) genotype are involved in the pathogenesis of human infectious diseases. Here we found that patients with dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) had a higher frequency of the AG or GG genotype of rs4804803 than DF or controls. Functional studies determined that monocyte-derived DCs (MDDCs) from individuals with AG genotype had significantly higher cell surface DC-SIGN expression, associated with higher TNFa, IL-12p40, and IP-10 production, but lower viral replication than those with AA genotype. An increase in DEN-2 replication in MDDCs was observed following the addition of anti-IP-10 neutralizing antibody. These findings highlight the fact that the rs4804803 SNP in the CD209 promoter is associated with DHF and correlated to DC-SIGN expression and immune augmentation.",

IP-10 has also been known to inhibit the binding ability of DEN in immortalized cells [28] . In our MDDC model, cells from individuals with AG genotype exhibited an augmented innate immune reaction, showing higher IP-10 production, post-infection ( Figure 3C ). Based on these results, we hypothesized that DENinfected MDDCs with AG genotype produced higher levels of IP-10, which might block viral entry or viral replication in MDDCs. We used an anti-IP-10 neutralizing mAb to block endogenous IP-10 production by MDDCs. With both genotypes, the viral replication 24 h post DEN infection increased significantly more in the presence of neutralizing antibody than in the absence of neutralizing antibody (p = 0.034 and 0.040, respectively; Fig. 4A ). IP-10 production by MDDCs from individuals with AG genotype significantly decreased (795.36368.1 pg/mL vs. 273.8687.8 pg/ mL; p = 0.037), but it did not decrease in MDDCs from individuals with AA genotype (329.86114.2 pg/mL vs. 201.8687.0 pg/mL; p = 0.091; Fig. 4B ).

The inconsistency between these studies regarding the protection for DHF or DF may result from two possibilities. First, the frequency of G allele in Chinese population is 3.8%; while in Thailand, it is 9.5-10.4% [16, 34] . Second, definition of DF and DHF might be also different. We defined DF and DHF according to WHO criteria, while in the study by Sakuntabhai et al., DF was defined by criteria of severe dengue fever syndrome with hemorrhage but no plasma leakage, excluding patients with flu-like symptoms or those having only fever. Moreover, the rs4804803 SNP was demonstrated to be in linkage disequilibrium with three other intronic polymorphisms in a Thai population, and these might also have contributed to the susceptibility of DHF [16] .",

The results are shown as mean 6 SEM from three independent experiments (n = 7 [35] . DC-SIGN is an endocytic receptor shown to induce endocytosis of several pathogens, including dengue [36] [37] [38] . The difference between these two studies might be due to different cell types and ex vivo culture systems. In our study, it was found that MDDCs from subjects with rs4804803 AG genotype had higher surface DC-SIGN expression with higher production of chemokines such as IP-10, which could limit DEN-2 replication (Fig. 4A) ; however, the higher surface DC-SIGN expression in subjects with AG genotype decreased remarkably 24 h post-infection ( Fig. 2A) . In the study by Loach et al., ectopic expression levels of DC-SIGN on Raji cells enhanced DEN-1 replication, which might be related to a higher quantity of receptors or lower production of IP-10 favoring DEN replication.

DEN replication was significantly lower in individuals with AG genotype. The addition of anti-IP-10 neutralizing antibody blocked the production of endogenous IP-10 and significantly enhanced the replication of DEN-2 (Fig. 4A ). This suggests that rs4804803 SNP was involved in the DC-SIGN expression associated with augmented immune response, such as the increase in the production of IP-10 that repressed the replication of DEN. This is supported by the fact that altered immune response, but not viral load, was observed in DHF patients [21, 39] . CLEC5A-mediated DEN infection in animals that was susceptible to DEN hemorrhagic infection also revealed augmented immune response [40] .",

The mechanism by which rs4804803 SNP influences DEN replication in MDDCs is currently unknown. Chan et al. showed that certain polymorphisms of L-SIGN, a DC-SIGN homologue, mediated more efficient viral degradation of SARS-CoV [41] . The clinical implications of screening genotypes to prevent DEN infection might be supported if different viral loads could be demonstrated among humans with various genotypes of rs4804803 in future outbreaks of DEN.",
