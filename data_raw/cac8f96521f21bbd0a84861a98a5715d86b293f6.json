However, the main purpose of epidemiological surveillance in the country is to detect the antigenic variations of influenza that are presented each season, which determine the changes in the vaccine composition. In 2013, the Instituto de Diagn\u00f3stico y Referencia Epidemiol\u00f3gicos (InDRE; Institute of Epidemiological Diagnosis and Reference) implemented a differential diagnosis of influenza that included 14 other respiratory viruses [15] . Due to this, at this moment Mexico does not have enough epidemiological information about the great diversity of viruses causing Acute Respiratory Infection. This lack of information, makes physicians search only for influenza, it is therefore the most requested confirmatory test in the laboratory during the whole year, even when we are out of influenza season (season comprises from October to May), leading to useless negative influenza results in most of the cases, without identifying the real causal agent of ARI in Mexico. This problem have direct implications for each patient, as the clinician does not know the causal agent, the patient does not receive the suitable treatment. It also has implications that affect the whole society, because the ignorance of the circulation patterns and incidence of other respiratory viruses limit preventive actions by health institutions. According to data from the Secretary of Health, approximately 80% of the samples from patients with ARIs that are received for confirmation of influenza virus infection outside of flu season are negative for the different strains of this virus and remain without a defined aetiology. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the viral aetiology of these infections and to analyse the behaviour of non-influenza respiratory viruses in the Mexican population.",

The influenza season is well known in Mexico and worldwide; however, the seasons of other respiratory viruses are not well known. According to our results, the highest prevalence of these viruses in Mexico appears to occur from October to March (autumn and winter), which coincides with the influenza season. Detection was significantly higher in November of 2014; during this month, there was a marked decrease in the national mean temperature from 23.3 to 18.3\u02daC. According to Cui et al. [61] , mean temperature is the key climatic parameter associated with the prevalence of many respiratory viruses because some viruses survive and/or replicate better at low temperatures [61] . On the other hand, Viegas et al [62] proposed that mucus release by cilia was reduced when the temperature of the respiratory tract was lowered; consequently, the local innate immune response (neutrophil and natural killer (NK) cell migration) was also reduced, thereby promoting viral infection.",

In this study, we identified 13 non-influenza respiratory viruses that occurred in any season of the year. This study provides evidence for the prevalence and seasonality of a wide range of respiratory viruses circulating in Mexico that constitute a risk for the population. Additionally, our data suggest that including these tests more widely in the diagnostic algorithm for influenza could reduce the use of unnecessary antibiotics, reduce the hospitalisation time, and enrich national epidemiological data regarding infections caused by these viruses.",
