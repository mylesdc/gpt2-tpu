Methods: A structured questionnaire on MERS was conducted among 214 medical students in China. Results: The average correction of the single question varied from 36.0% to 89.7%. There is a significant difference on MERS knowledge among different majors of medical students (p < 0.05). Management students scored significantly higher than students of other majors (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Chinese medical students had good knowledge of MERS. The MERS knowledge score varied among students of different majors. Education on disease control should be included in the school curriculum.",

            "text": "Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) is a new, emerging infectious disease that was first reported in 2012 and confirmed with human-to-human transmission in 2013 [1] . On 29 May 2015, the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC) of China confirmed the first MERS case in China, an imported case from South Korean. MERS is caused by a coronavirus from the same family as the one that triggered China's deadly outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003. Previous cases have shown that medical students, especially the pre-clinical year medical students, are at high risk of newly emerging diseases, including SARS [2] . While doctors and nurses played a crucial role in the prevention, detection, and containment of SARS [3] most documented \"super-spreading events\" of SARS occurred in hospitals. The underlying causes remain unclear [4] , but it has been suggested that lack of systematic training in emerging infectious diseases could be the cause. A similar case was reported with swine flu [5] In China, medical education is comprised of basic medical sciences courses in the first four years and an internship in the fifth year. Although courses regarding preventive medicine are provided to all students, there is no specific course that addresses new emergency infectious diseases. This is concerning because contact with newly emerging infectious diseases such as MERS, H7N9, andH1N1 is not rare in their practice. Chinese medical students' knowledge on emergency infectious diseases is low. For example, only 35.2% of medical students washed their hands before and 72.5% washed their hands after they physically examined patients in the wards in 2003 before SARS [6] A study from Saudi Arabia addressing the awareness of all procedures concerning prevention of and protection from MERSamong dental students suggested that more information needs to be provided by the authorities for the medical staff [7] . After the first case of MERS was found in China, we designed a study to assess the knowledge of a group of Chinese medical students regarding MERS.",

All students were divided into grades. Grades 3 and 4 were selected. Each of the above randomly selected grades was divided into multiple majors. The majors of nursing, clinical, management, and public health were randomly selected. Then, one to two classes from these majors were randomly selected to represent the population. Finally, 223 students were selected and 214 responded. The response rate was 95.6%. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Wannan Medical College and followed the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki.

The results also reflected the insufficient education on disease prevention and control in the medical school curriculum. The lack of related knowledge among the medical students raises a public concern since they should be prepared with knowledge to confront a potential epidemic and/or pandemic. Although MERS was a newly emergent infectious disease, which people were less familiar with, there are some common principles for dealing with it. The medical staff and public health agencies play a critical role in controlling new emergency infectious diseases. Therefore, it is crucial that healthcare professionals, as well as medical students, be provided with training in controlling infectious diseases [8] .",

For example, the difference of knowledge scores between students in different majors could be confounded by students' individual habits of accessing information from media.
