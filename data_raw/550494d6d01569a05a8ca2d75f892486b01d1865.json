This is even more important, as bats with their capability of long distance dispersal and complex social structures are unique in the way microbes could be spread by these mammalian species. Nevertheless, infection studies in bats are predominantly limited to the identification of specific pathogens presenting a potential health threat to humans. But the impact of infectious agents on the individual host and their importance on bat mortality is largely unknown and has been neglected in most studies published to date.",

Most animals represented individual cases that have been incidentally found close to roosting sites or near human habitation in urban and urban-like environments. The bat carcasses were subjected to a post-mortem examination and investigated histo-pathologically, bacteriologically and virologically. Trauma and disease represented the most important causes of death in these bats. Comparative analysis of pathological findings and microbiological results show that microbial agents indeed have an impact on bats succumbing to infectious diseases, with fatal bacterial, viral and parasitic infections found in at least 12% of the bats investigated.",

The clear seasonal and individual variations in disease prevalence and infection rates indicate that maternity colonies are more susceptible to infectious agents, underlining the possible important role of host physiology, immunity and roosting behavior as risk factors for infection of bats.",

Approximately 1230 chiropteran species are found on every continent except Antarctica and inhabit a multitude of diverse ecological niches [1] . Bats play essential roles in maintaining healthy ecosystems, as they act as plant pollinators, seed dispersers, and predators of populations of insects including harmful forest and agricultural pests [2] . Most bat species are listed in the IUCN Red list of endangered species and almost half of these are considered threatened or near-threatened [3] . To estimate and prevent further population declines, research has been primarily focused on bat biology, ecology and behavior, while disease aspects were largely neglected [4] .",

The bat carcasses originated from 6 different geographic regions in Germany, i.e. Berlin greater metropolitan area (n = 223), Bavaria (n = 165), Brandenburg (n = 38), Lower Saxony (n = 36), Thuringia (n = 21), and Baden-Wuerttemberg (n = 3), and were collected by bat researchers and bat rehabilitation centers. Most animals represented individual cases that were found dead, injured or moribund near human habitation. Thus, the species composition in this study predominately reflected the urban and suburban bat fauna, which is characterized by a disproportionate abundance of a few bat species (Fig. 1A , [27, 28] ). Two groups of 2 and 21 adult noctules (Nyctalus noctula), respectively, were collected from tree hibernacula destroyed during wood logging. A further group of 25 deceased adult N. noctula originated from a colony that was trapped in a rain pipe in December. Nine dead juvenile Pipistrellus pipistrellus were collected from a nursery roost.",

Trauma and disease represented the most important causes of mortality in deceased bats from Germany, which differ from results of previous studies [13] [14] [15] where disease-related mortality often played a subordinate role. Young bats and adult females were significantly more affected by disease, indicating that sex-and age-related disease prevalence in Table 3 . Pathological findings and bacterial, viral and parasitic infections specified for the general causes of mortality, trauma and disease. bats are strongly correlated with the maternal season. This assumption is further supported by the distinct increase of diseaserelated mortality from June to August, which corresponds to the maternity period of Central European bat species. Similar seasonal prevalence patterns in bats have also been described for parasitic (e.g. [42] [43] [44] [45] ) and viral infections (e.g. [19, 46, 47] ). In contrast, the increase of trauma-associated mortality cases from July to October resembles 4 major behavioral activity patterns of European bat species (i.e. weaning, mating, pre-hibernal fat storage, and migration) [48] and could therefore predispose bats to trauma. However, both seasonal peaks also coincide with time and locations where sick, injured or dead bats are more likely to be discovered as well as with the seasonal roosting behavior of bats adapted on urban habitats [27] . The additional seasonal peaks of disease-associated mortality corresponded to the post-hibernal and the early hibernal period of temperate zone bats. Currently, there is a lack of knowledge of bat immunology. It is known for other mammalian species that hibernation reduces the innate and adaptive immune response; likewise an increasing risk of infection could be assumed for hibernating bats [49] . With the start of the hibernation season, large aggregations of bats originating from various colonies might enhance the risk of spreading infectious agents similar to maternity colonies. Equally, the post-hibernal increase of disease-related mortality is suggestive for reduced immunity in association with prolonged fasting during hibernation.",

Some of the bacterial species (e.g. Burkholderia sp., Cedecea davisae and Clostridium sordellii) are newly described in bats.

This relation has been proven for P. multocida infections in European bat species [13, 14, 23, 26] . On the other hand, bats already debilitated by disease might easier fall prey to predators like cats. Consequently, bats may also act as vectors for zoonotic pathogens, as domestic cats could pass these infectious agents on to humans. Such cross-species transmission events from bats to domestic animals are well documented [9, 52] .",

Bat rabies is the only bat transmitted zoonosis in Europe that is known to have resulted in human cases [53] . Unlike in other mammals Table 4 . Result of the final model variables corresponding to 4 different analyses: (A) disease-vs. trauma-related mortality, and presence-absence of (B) bacterial, (C) ecto-and (D) endoparasitic infection. where lyssaviruses ultimately cause lethal rabies, in bats nonlethal lyssavirus infections may also lead to the development of immunity [47] . With the detection of EBLV-1 we confirm that this lyssavirus circulates among E. serotinus as previous studies showed [18] . In Germany, bat rabies is also caused by EBLV-2 and Bokeloh bat lyssavirus (BBLV) [54, 55] , but while the latter was recently isolated from M. nattereri, EBLV-2 is associated with M. daubentonii and M. dasycneme [56] . The apparent absence of EBLV-2 and BBLV in the sampled bats is likely due to the fact that lyssavirus infections have a very low incidence in bat populations [18] and that the sample size was too limited, especially concerning the relevant species. There is a high prevalence for herpesviruses in different insectivorous bat species in Germany (this study, [24] ). Most of the previously described bat herpesviruses have been detected in low numbers in more than one bat species [24] . Here, we observed a high species-specific prevalence among herpesvirusinfected bats, indicating that a certain type of European bat herpesvirus is primarily associated with a single bat species. This is supported by BatGHV6 and BatGHV7 that were again only identified in their initial hosts P. pipistrellus and P. auritus (both sedentary), respectively, underlining the typical strong speciesspecificity of mammalian herpesviruses. However, species' range overlap and close inter-species contacts in bat roosts may result in cross-species transmission and could explain the observed overcoming of the species barrier (this study BatGHV5, [24] ). Interspecies transmission have also been discussed for other mammalian herpesviruses, i.e. bovine and equine herpesviruses (e.g. [57, 58] ). Furthermore, for RNA viruses (i.e. rabies virus) phylogenetic distance between different host species and overlap in geographic range have recently been demonstrated as strong predictors of host shifts and cross-species transmission in bats [59] . Some of the bat species (i.e. N. noctula, P. pipistrellus, and P. nathusii) in this study appear to be more susceptible to herpesvirus infection. In N. noctula, 3 different gammaherpesviruses (BatGHV3, 4, 5) with significant prevalence differences were recognized. Such type-specific differences in prevalence between the phylogenetically distant viruses BatGHV3 (13.0%) and BatGHV4 (33.8%) within one bat species indicates co-evolutionary virus-regulated mechanisms.

Bats primarily roosting in trees or nest boxes were more frequently infested with ectoparasites like N. noctula (43%) and M. daubentonii (25%) compared to other species (range 5-12%) investigated in this study. High ectoparasite loads have generally been described in bats preferring enclosed roosts like burrows and cavities [61, 62] , suggesting that structural characteristics and the microclimate of roosting habitats influence ectoparasite survival and re-infection of bat hosts. This assumption is in accordance with results of Pearce and O'Shea [63] who found differences in ectoparasite prevalence and intensity in Eptesicus fuscus in relation to environmental factors (i.e. temperature and humidity) of different roost sites. In contrast to these results, the endoparasite prevalence in European vespertilionid bats seems to be correlated with the body size of the bat species [26] . Species-specific variations in diet and prey selection could possibly effect endoparasite prevalence in insectivorous bats [64] , as larger bats feed on insects of a wider size range including hard-bodied prey [65, 66] . This assumption is supported by the clear prevalence increase in subadult and adult bats compared to low endoparasite infection rates in juveniles primarily feeding on milk.",

Alongside to trauma-associated mortality and undefined mortality cases, disease aspects represented one third of mortality causes in 486 investigated bats of 19 European vespertilionid species. By comparing pathology and bacteriology results, we were able to detect 22 different bacterial species that were clearly associated with disease in bats. At least 12% of all bats had died due to bacterial, viral and parasitic infections. Finally, we found clear seasonal and individual variations in disease prevalence and infection rates, indicating an increased susceptibility to infectious agents in female bats and juveniles during the maternity season. Our data emphasize and provide the basis for disease related studies in bat species on population level to elucidate the complexity of the ecology of infectious agents and host species likewise.",
