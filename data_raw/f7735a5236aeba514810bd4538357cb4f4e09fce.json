The regulation of cellular gene expression by nsp11 was examined by RNA microarrays using MARC-nsp11 cells constitutively expressing nsp11. In these cells, the interferon-, interferon regulatory factor 3, and nuclear factor-B activities were suppressed compared to those of parental cells, suggesting that nsp11 might serve as a viral interferon antagonist. Differential cellular transcriptome was examined using Affymetrix exon chips representing 28,536 transcripts, and after statistical analyses 66 cellular genes were shown to be upregulated and 104 genes were downregulated by nsp11. These genes were grouped into 5 major signaling pathways according to their functional relations: histone-related, cell cycle and DNA replication, mitogen activated protein kinase signaling, complement, and ubiquitin-proteasome pathways. Of these, the modulation of cell cycle by nsp11 was further investigated since many of the regulated genes fell in this particular pathway. Flow cytometry showed that nsp11 caused the delay of cell cycle progression at the S phase and the BrdU staining confirmed the cell cycle arrest in nsp11-expressing cells. The study provides insights into the understanding of specific cellular responses to nsp11 during PRRSV infection.",

            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is one of the most significant infectious diseases for the pig industry worldwide and causes severe economic losses [1] . The etiological agent is PRRS virus (PRRSV), which belongs to the family Arteriviridae in the order Nidovirales [2] and possesses a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome of 15.4 kb in size [3] [4] [5] [6] . Two distinct genotypes have been reported for PRRSV: European (type I) and North American (type II) genotypes [7, 8] . The PRRSV genome contains 10 open reading frames (ORFs) including the newly identified ORF5a [9, 10] . ORF1a is translated to produce the PP1a polyproteins, but ORF1b is expressed as a fusion with ORF1a by ribosomal frameshifting and produces the PP1a/b fusion polyproteins. PP1a and PP1a/b are cotranslationally processed into 14 cleavage products. These products are nonstructural proteins (nsps) that are believed to participate in viral genome replication and subgenomic mRNA transcription [11] [12] [13] . Of these, nsp11 is a 223 amino acid protein and contains a nidovirus-specific domain, termed NendoU, in the Cterminal region. NendoU is known to contain an endoribonuclease activity and consists of two subdomains, A and B [4, [14] [15] [16] . Mutational studies using equine arteritis virus (EAV) nsp11, which is a homolog of PRRSV nsp11, show that three enzymatically catalytic sites reside in subdomain A, while two aspartic acids in subdomain B are responsible for the overall protein structure [16] . In EAV, nsp11 plays a key role in viral RNA synthesis and thus it may also be essential for PRRSV replication. Recently, PRRSV has been shown to modulate type I IFN response [17] and nsp11 has been suggested to participate in the modulation of IFN response [18] .",

The cells were resuspended in 12.5 mL of STE (5 mL of 1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mL of 0.5 M NaCl and 1 mL of 0.5 M EDTA, pH 8.0 in 500 mL) containing aprotinin (1-10 g/mL) and PMSF (1 mM) and pelleted again at 7700 \u00d7g for 10 min. The cells were resuspended again in 12.5 mL of 1X PBS, and DNase I (20 g/mL) and lysosome (200 g/mL) were added and treated for 1 h. Then, DTT was added to make a final concentration of 5 mM and incubate 5 min on ice. 20% of Sarkosyl solution was additionally added to a final concentration of 0.5%, followed by sonication to sheer the genomic DNA at the setting scale of 4 for 10 s at least three times (Soniprep 150; Sanyo Gallenkamp PLC, Leicester, UK). After sonication, the samples were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 30 min (J2-21; Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA), and supernatants and pellets were collected separately and subjected to SDS-PAGE individually to determine the presence of nsp11-K3779A protein for each fraction. Nsp11 was purified from the supernatants and concentrated to 1 mg/mL using the HisTrap column according to the manufacturer's instruction (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA). A total of 2 mg of nsp11 was used to immunize a rabbit 5 times at 2-week intervals, intramuscularly using Freund's incomplete and complete adjuvants, and an anti-PRRSV-nsp11 rabbit serum was generated (Immunological Research Center, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL, USA). The specificity of the antiserum was determined by immune-blot and immunofluorescence using PRRSV-infected MARC-145 cells.",

The RNA samples were then subjected to microarray using Human Gene 1.0 ST arrays (Affymetrix UK Ltd., High Wycombe, UK) at Keck Biotechnology Center (University of Illinois, Urbana, IL). The microarray was repeated twice in triplicate each. For data analyses, quality control assessments, data processing, and statistical analyses were conducted using the package from the Bioconductor project [22] as indicated below. The Affymetrix's Human Gene 1.0 ST array contained probes to interrogate 253,002 exons representing 28,536 annotated genes. Comparisons were made either on the exonlevel to investigate alternative splicing or on the whole genelevel to summarize all transcripts of the gene. The individual probe values were background-corrected, normalized, and summarized into one value at both the exon-and genelevels using the robust multiarray average (RMA) algorithm available from the oligo packages [23] . Testing for differential gene expressions between MARC-145 cells and MARC-nsp11 cells was conducted separately at the exon-and gene-levels by fitting a linear model including a term to account for the separate processing batches using the Linear Models for Microarray Data (Limma) package [24, 25] . The criteria for significance varied for the exon-and gene-levels. At the exonlevel, the criteria were at least a 2-fold change and a raw value <0.02, resulting in 8,693 significant exons. At the gene-level, the Limma model was fit and raw values were calculated using all genes on the array, but the correction for multiple hypothesis testing using the FDR (false discovery rate) method [26] was done for only the 9,241 genes that varied in expression across all the samples of at least a 1.5-fold change.

The suppressive activities in MARC-nsp11 were less markedly than those in gene-transfected cells and this was probably due to the lower level expression of nsp11 in MARC-nsp11 cells. The reporter activities of IFN-, IRF3, and NF-B were reduced by \u223c2, 2, and 2.5-fold, respectively ( < 0.05).

These chips contained 253,002 exons from 28,536 annotated genes. After microarray analyses, genes were filtered by fold changes greater than 1.5, and 9,241 genes were initially identified to have been altered, among which 66 and 104 cellular genes were upregulated and downregulated, respectively, under the criteria of a fold change of 2 or greater and a false discovery rate (FDR) of 10%. Based on the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID), 79 of the significantly regulated genes were placed into 17 categories, some of which shared the common function. According to their functional correlations, the functional groups were summarized into five major cellular pathways that were regulated by nsp11: histonerelated proteins, cell cycle and DNA replication pathways, MAPK signaling pathways, ubiquitin-proteasome pathways, and complementary pathways (Table 1) . For validation of the fold changes in the gene expression profiles, five genes (TNFSF10, DEPTOR, SH2, NOL6, and EGR1) were chosen according to their fold changes, and RT-qPCR was conducted. NOL6 and EGR1 were chosen to represent the group of upregulated genes, and TNFSF10 and DEPTOR were chosen to represent the group of downregulated genes, while SH2 was chosen as an unregulated gene. The results from RT-qPCR for these genes were in good agreement with their fold changes in the microarray and confirmed the fold change profiles for differential gene expression (Figure 3 ).",

BrdU is a nucleotide analog and thus can be incorporated into replicating DNA, whereas lamin proteins are major architectural proteins of the nuclear lining inside the nuclear membrane in cells. Thus, all cells are anticipated to be stained with an anti-lamin antibody, whereas only cells synthesizing new DNA in the S phase are presumed to be stained with an anti-BrdU antibody. A short pulse of 10 min or 20 min would detect BrdU incorporation in a single cell cycle, whereas a longer time incubation of 24 h would detect multiple cell cycles and thus the majority of normal cells would be positive for BrdU staining ( Figure 5(a) ). A total of 200 lamin-positive cells (in red) were randomly chosen for each slide, and BrdU positive cells (in green) out of the lamin-positive cells were counted to determine BrdU incorporation rates using the formula described in Materials and Methods. MARC-nsp11 cells exhibited less numbers of BrdU-positive cells after the 10 min and 20 min pulses compared to those of MARC-145 cells (Figure 5(a) ), and their BrdU incorporation rates dropped from 47.07% (white bar) to 38.07% (black bar) ( < 0.005) and from 57.8% (white bar) to 44% (black bar) ( < 0.005), respectively ( Figure 5(b) ).

The intensity of BrdU staining in MARC-nsp11 cells was also significantly reduced after the 24 h pulse compared to that of MARC-145 cells ( Figure 5 staining data indicate that nsp11 slows down the cell cycle progression through the S phase.",

The microarray studies identified 170 differentially regulated cellular genes with the threshold of 2. Of these, 104 genes were downregulated and 66 genes were upregulated, and many of these genes were able to be placed according to their functional relevance into 5 different pathways: histone-related proteins, cell cycle and DNA replication, MAPK signaling, ubiquitin-proteasome, and the complement system. Compared to previous studies [19, 20] , the genes identified in our study were fewer in number and less in diverse. This is probably because the regulated genes identified in our study were exclusively nsp11specific, whereas the genes in the previous studies were responders to the entire spectrum of viral proteins. Thus, nsp11-regulated genes were mostly included in the previously identified genes. Zhou et al. [20] also showed that the genes relevant to cell cycle and DNA replication were regulated by highly pathogenic (HP)-PRRSV in PAMs. Chromosome organizing proteins were also regulated by nsp11, and proteins regulating the complement system for tissue remolding and inflammation were also found in our study. c-Jun and c-Fos are two effectors of the MAPK signaling pathway, and they were specifically upregulated during PRRSV infection [19] . PRRSV-mediated activation of the MAPK signaling pathway and the increase of JNK and p38 phosphorylation have recently been demonstrated [40] , which is also in support of our findings.",

It appears that the cell cycle progression was delayed at the S phase in nsp11-expressing cells compared to MARC-145 cells. A similar observation was recently made for coronavirus in cells expressing nsp15, which is a coronavirus homolog of PRRSV nsp11 [41] . In that study, SARS-CoV nsp15 was shown to downregulate the retinoblastoma (Rb) activity which is responsible for cell proliferation. As a consequence, a higher percentage of cells was accumulating at the S phase when expressing nsp15, supporting our observation of slower cell cycle progression in nsp11-expressing cells. The S phase tardiness may be associated with an altered DNA replication, since several MCM proteins, which are components of DNA helicase, were upregulated (Table 1 ). It is possible that the increase of helicase proteins might have caused a malfunction of the replication fork and thus the inhibition of DNA synthesis in MARC-nsp11 cells.",

            "text": "Virus-mediated cell cycle regulation is not uncommon and can be beneficial to viruses. In particular, it is true for DNA viruses replicating in the nucleus such as SV40, herpes simplex virus, and adeno-associated virus, in which by arresting the cell cycle of infected cells, the cellular DNA replicative machinery may be captured and utilized for viral DNA replication [42] [43] [44] . For RNA viruses, influenza virus replication has been shown to be regulated by helicase and the MCM complex consisting of MCM2-7 [45] . The interaction between the influenza virus PA polymerase and MCM complex increases the stability of RNA polymerase. In our study, MCM2, MCM4, and MCM5 were upregulated by nsp11. Even though the PRRSV replicates in the cytoplasm, the cell cycle regulation may be considered beneficial for the virus, since an available pool of cellular machineries can be maximally utilized towards the production of progeny at an early stage of infection. For PRRSV, nucleocapsid (N) protein has also been suggested to regulate the cell cycle progression by modulating the ribosomal RNA synthesis in the nucleolus [46] . Thus, it is possible that N and nsp11 may both regulate the cell cycle progression and facilitate virus production by targeting different cellular components modulating the host cell cycle. The N protein is an RNA-binding protein which contains the nuclear localization signal (NLS) and thus localizes in the nucleus and nucleolus. By yeast 2-hybrid screening, the inhibitor of MyoD family a (I-mfa) domaincontaining protein was identified interacting with PRRSV N [47] . Since the I-mfa domain-containing protein interacts with cyclin T1 [48] , which participates in the control of the cell cycle, this interaction suggests a regulatory role of N for the cell cycle [17] . Different from N, nsp11 resides in the cytoplasm and contains an endoribonuclease activity. Nsp11 may alter the function or expression of cytoplasmic cellular components such as mRNA modification, which may then result in the regulation of the cell cycle. Indeed, modification of cellular mRNA by nsp11 has been suggested previously [49] . In summary, our data show that the PRRSV nsp11 protein is responsible for the delay of the S phase and thus, together with N, may regulate the cell cycle progression. N functions in the nucleus and nsp11 functions in the cytoplasm.",
