FilmArray RP2 testing. Approximately 300 l of specimen was subjected to FilmArray RP2 testing according to the manufacturer's instructions (9) . All sample processing occurred in a biosafety cabinet with operators wearing gloves and other appropriate personal protective equipment. One sample was processed at a time, and the cleaning of work areas was done in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions (9) . The FilmArray RP2 test consists of automated nucleic acid extraction, reverse transcription, nucleic acid amplification, and result analysis in approximately 45 min per run (i.e., per specimen). The FilmArray software performs automated result analysis, with each target in a valid run reported as \"detected\" or \"not detected.\" If either internal control fails, the software automatically provides a result of \"invalid\" for all panel analytes.

As noted, there were a significant number of detections by RP2 that were not found by RP (n \u03ed 224). The overall design goal for RP2 was to increase the sensitivity for all analytes relative to that of RP, and this may account for a significant number of the observed FP detections. This is supported by LoD studies reported in the product inserts (9, 14) and the discordant analysis performed in this study.

            "text": "Overall, there were relatively low numbers of bacterial detections with the FilmArray RP2 (n \u03ed 43). The reasons for this are likely due to true disease prevalence differences during the study period. Also, as seen in our data (Table S1 ), the codetection of bacteria and viruses is not common, particularly with B. pertussis, as has been previously reported (21, 22) . The target gene for B. pertussis in both the FilmArray RP and the FilmArray RP2 is the toxin promoter region. This single-copy gene is known to be more specific than the more commonly used insertion sequence 481 (IS481) gene that is a multicopy target present in several Bordetella species. While having greater specificity, the toxin gene target may be less sensitive, as has been reported previously (23) . The diagnosis of pertussis-like illness is improved with the inclusion of the insertion sequence element 1001 target for B. parapertussis in the FilmArray RP2. B. parapertussis is known to cause a pertussis-like illness and can cocirculate with other Bordetella species (24, 25) . The prevalence of B. parapertussis is uncertain, as it is not a reportable disease like B. pertussis and is not tested for as commonly (26, 27) . M. pneumoniae was the most common of the bacterial analytes, with 28 detections, more than with the FilmArray RP. However, it should be noted that use of an NPS specimen for the detection of M. pneumoniae may be suboptimal, particularly when diagnosing lower respiratory tract infection (28, 29) .",

Discrepancy analysis using FilmArray RP retests and PCR and bidirectional sequencing confirmed 114 of 224 FP (51%), which is strong evidence that the FilmArray RP2 has increased sensitivity compared to the FilmArray RP. There are some limitations of this study. This was a prospective study; however, some samples were frozen at \u03ea70\u00b0C or less prior to testing. However, data indicated that the frozen storage did not significantly affect performance (9) . The study period bridges one calendar year (2016) and includes only two partial respiratory seasons, so variations in circulating strains, particularly FluA, are limited. The comparator method for 20 of the targets was the FilmArray RP. Data concerning FilmArray RP2 performance compared to that of other amplified platforms or culture are not provided and will await other studies. Finally, the lack of detection of MERS-CoV and FluA H1 in the prospective study limited the data on the performance for these targets.",

This is an important step both for individual improvements in pathogen detection and as recognition by the manufacturer that continuous improvements in monitoring and inclusion of new or emerging strains or species are important. Both have been incorporated into the design of the FilmArray RP2, improving its performance for the detection of infectious agents that are involved in respiratory infections. These changes include new targets (MERS-CoV and B. parapertussis), improvements to existing targets, and a decreased time to result. These improvements, combined with the simplicity of the testing process and a shorter time to result, make the FilmArray RP2 a significant improvement in diagnostic testing.",
