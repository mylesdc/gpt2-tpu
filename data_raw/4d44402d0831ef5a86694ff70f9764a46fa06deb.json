The HERV envelope-coated, nonreplicable, baculovirus-based DNA vaccine, encoding HPV16L1, -18L1 and -58L1 (AcHERV-triHPV), was constructed and sublingually administered to mice without adjuvant. Following sublingual (SL) administration, AcHERV-triHPV was absorbed and distributed throughout the body. At 15 minutes and 1 day post-dose, the distribution of AcHERV-triHPV to the lung was higher than that to other tissues. At 30 days post-dose, the levels of AcHERV-triHPV had diminished throughout the body. Six weeks after the first of three doses, 1\u00d710 8 copies of SL AcHERV-triHPV induced HPV type-specific serum IgG and neutralizing antibodies to a degree comparable to that of IM immunization with 1\u00d710 9 copies. AcHERV-triHPV induced HPV type-specific vaginal IgA titers in a dose-dependent manner. SL immunization with 1\u00d710 10 copies of AcHERV-triHPV induced Th1 and Th2 cellular responses comparable to IM immunization with 1\u00d710 9 copies. Molecular imaging revealed that SL AcHERV-triHPV in mice provided complete protection against vaginal challenge with HPV16, HPV18, and HPV58 pseudoviruses. These results support the potential of SL immunization using multivalent DNA vaccine in baculovirus nanovector for induction of mucosal, systemic, and cellular immune responses.",

An ideal vaccine against an infectious pathogen should prime the host for induction of pathogen-specific memory immune responses at the appropriate mucosal compartment, thereby preventing the entry and/or replication of the invading pathogen at the site of infection [1] . Mucosal immunizations via nasal, buccal, or sublingual routes have recently emerged as alternatives to intramuscular (IM) vaccine administration. Non-parenteral, needlefree mucosal vaccination has several advantages, including reduced pain stresses, costs, and viral transmission associated with the injection [2, 3] .",

Spodoptera frugiperda 9 (Sf9) cells were from Invitrogen (Catalog No. 11496-015), and cultured at 28\u00b0C in Sf-900 II medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 100 units/ml of Gibco antibiotic-antimycotic (Invitrogen). AcHERV-triHPV was amplified by propagation in Sf9 cells and purified by first centrifuging at 2,000\u00d7g at 4\u00b0C for 10 minutes to remove virus-infected cell debris. Thereafter, supernatants were overlaid on a 30% sucrose cushion and centrifuged at 35,000 rpm at 4\u00b0C for 1.5 hour in a 50.2Ti rotor (Beckman Coulter Inc., CA, USA). The pellet was re-suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Invitrogen) and used for immunization. monitoring phase.

Mice were sublingually administered 1\u00d710 9 copies of AcHERV-triHPV using a previously reported procedure [13] . Mice were sacrificed by CO 2 inhalation at various time points, and tissues were collected. Total blood and tissue DNA was extracted using a DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA), as described by the manufacturer. For qRT-PCR, 10-fold serially diluted plasmids encoding HPV16L1, -18L1 and -58L1 (pFB-HERV-HPV16-58-18L1), encompassing a concentration range of 1\u00d710 2 to 1\u00d710 8 copies/\u03bcl, were used to construct a standard curve. The levels of the HPV16-58-18L1 gene in mouse samples were determined by qPCR amplification of a genomic DNA (gDNA) template (200 ng) using LightCycler FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I (Roche Diagnostics Gmbh, Mannheim, Germany). The amplification conditions consisted of an initial denaturation step at 94\u00b0C for 5 minutes, followed by 40 cycles of 30 seconds at 94\u00b0C, 20 seconds at 62\u00b0C, and 20 seconds at 72\u00b0C. The primers for HPV16L1 detection were 5 0 -CAG CGA GAC CAC CTA CAA GA-3 0 (forward primer) and 5 0 -GCT GTT CAT GCT GTG GAT GT-3 0 (reverse primer), generating a 139-bp product. Amplification of glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA was used to control for the efficiency of qRT-PCR among samples.",

SL immunization with AcHERV-triHPV Induction of HPV type-specific neutralizing antibodies following SL or IM immunization. Mice were administered AcHERV-triHPV or PBS (control) three times over a 2-week interval by the SL or IM route. Mice were sublingually immunized with three different doses of AcHERV-triHPV (1\u00d710 8 , 1\u00d710 9 , and 1\u00d710 10 copies per mouse) or immunized intramuscularly with 1\u00d710 9 copies per mouse. Antigen-specific neutralizing antibody titers against HPV16L1 (A), HPV18L1 (B), and HPV58L1 (C) were determined by SEAP assay. Neutralization assays were performed using serially diluted mouse sera and HPV16, -18, or -58 PVs. Data are expressed as geometric means (log) of reciprocal serum dilutions that yielded a 50% reduction in SEAP (n = 5). protected mice against challenge with HPV type-specific PVs. Moreover, sublingually administered AcHERV-triHPV showed a higher distribution to the lungs compared to other tissues at 15 minutes and 1 hour after administration, but did not persist in the lung for more than 24 hours. The higher levels of AcHERV-triHPV in the lung at early time points supports the interpretation that sublingually administered AcHERV-triHPV is directly absorbed into the lung, rather than being systemically absorbed in the blood and subsequently distributed to the lung. It is likely that the systemic absorption of AcHERV-triHPV involves both paracellular and transcellular pathways across sublingual epithelial cells. It has been reported that sublingually administered antigens are transported across ductal SL epithelial cells and reach ductal antigenpresenting cells in mice [20] . In addition, it is possible that sublingually administered Fig 6. Th1 and Th2 cytokine induction following SL or IM immunization. Mouse splenocytes were harvested 6 weeks after the first immunization. ELISPOT assays were used to determine the number of (A) IFN-\u03b3-producing HPV16-, HPV18-, or HPV58-specific CD8 + T cells, and (B) IL-4-producing HPV16-, HPV18-, or HPV58-specific CD4 + T cells. Values represent the number of spots per 10 6 splenocytes following stimulation with HPV16, -18 or -58 PVs (PV16, PV18, or PV58). AcHERV-triHPV reaches the lung in part through migration of SL dendritic cells that capture the antigen. Consistent with this possibility, a recent study reported that antigen-displaying dendritic cells in the SL mucosa were detected at distant lymph nodes and in the spleen [21] .",

Previous studies reported that sublingually administered viral vaccines did not migrate to the brain [22, 23] . Song et al. [22] reported that live influenza A/PR/8 virus was not detected in the olfactory bulb and brain tissues, one day after SL administration. Shim et al. [23] observed that sublingually administered recombinant adenovirus encoding acute respiratory syndrome- associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was not detected in the olfactory bulb, concluding no redirection of the virus to the brain. Given these previous reports, it is unlikely that AcHERV-triHPV directly migrated to the brain via olfactory bulb. Rather, there exists a possibility that systemically absorbed AcHERV-triHPV might distribute to the brain passing the blood-brain barrier. Indeed, we previously observed the brain distribution of AcHERV encoding HPV16L1 following intramuscular administration [24] . In the study, the distribution levels of intramuscularly administered AcHERV encoding HPV16L1 were similar among the brain, heart, and lung tissues. Similar to our previous report [24] , the brain distribution of porcine-derived adeno-associated virus was observed following intravenous injection to mice [25] .",

However, in this latter study, HPV16L1 alone was not effective in inducing immunogenicity and required co-administration of adjuvants, such as cholera toxin B, to induce prolonged and cellular immunogenicity. Although the interconnection of the mucosal and systemic immune system remains to be studied further, we can't exclude the possibility that the type of antigens or vaccine delivery systems may affect the efficiency of mucosal immunogenicity following systemic or mucosal administration. A previous study reported that vaginal IgA immune responses against bovine papillomavirus type 1 virus-like particles were comparable following intranasal and intramuscular administration [27] . In the case of chimeric bovine papillomavirus virus-like particles incorporating sequence from human immunodeficiency virus-1 gp120, the vaginal IgA induction was higher following IM administration as compared to intravaginal administration [28] . Intramuscular administration of integrase-defective lentiviral vector carrying ovalbumin gene followed by sublingual ovalbumin administration was reported to induce persistent vaginal IgA immune responses [29] . A recent study reported that SL immunization of female human volunteers with Gardasil induced 38-fold lower serum IgG levels and 2-fold lower cervical/vaginal IgG levels than IM immunization [30] , highlighting the importance of the delivery system for SL immunization.",

Plasmid DNA vaccines have been known to induce Th1 type-specific immune responses [31] . Our observation on both Th1 and Th2 immune responses might be explained by both Th1 and Th2-stimulating adjuvant activity of AcHERV baculoviral vectors. A previous study reported the role of viral vectors in activation of T cell subsets in immune responses [32] . They observed that an adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector expressing coagulation factor IX could activate CD4+ T helper cells primarily of the Th2 subset, whereas an adenoviral vector efficiently activated coagulation factor IX-specific CTLs and T helper cells of both Th1 and Th2 subsets [32] . Baculovirus was reported to induce both Th1 and Th2 immune responses in mice following intramuscular injection, by inducing baculovirus-specific INF-\u03b3 and IL4-expressing splenocytes [33] . Intranasal immunization of a recombinant baculovirus-based vaccine expressing H7N7-hemagglutinin was shown to induce both IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 responses in the splenocytes of the mice [34] . Thus, it is speculated that AcHERV baculoviral vector could stimulate the activation of both Th1 and Th2 cell subsets for expressed HPV antigens.",

SL administration of HPV virus-like particles were shown to induce serum-neutralizing antibodies and vaginal IgA. In the study, SL administration of HPV virus-like particles provided protection against genital challenge with HPV PVs [6] . A previous study reported that SL immunization with ovalbumin plus alpha-galactosylceramide protected mice from intravenous lung tumor challenge [35] .
