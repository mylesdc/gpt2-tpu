Because its prevalence is rising as populations age, multimorbidity is attracting increasing attention from the research community worldwide. 1 More than 2800 publications on multimorbidity appeared between 1900 and 2016, 80% of which were published after 2010. 2 As no universally agreed measure or list of diseases exists to define multimorbidity, numerous indices have been developed. These might be designed, for example, to quantify multimorbidity as a covariate in other analyses, for mortality prediction or for risk adjustment. Previous systematic reviews identified multiple indices, but no searches have been done of indices since 2009. 3 4 Multimorbidity research most often refers to a count of chronic conditions. 4 This method does not reflect patients' experience or the effects of different combinations or severity of diseases. 5 Some indices, however, combine disease counts with severity mea sures, physiological factors, or demographic items, thereby allowing a more holistic quantification of illness burden.",

We included a variety of terms for multimorbidity derived from previous systematic reviews on this topic 3 4 and other literature discussing terminology in this area of research. 7 We developed the search strategy iteratively with the support of an Academic Support Librarian. The final search terms are listed in the appendix (appendix eTable 1) and include multimorbidity, comorbidity, polypathology, polymorbidity, pluripathology, multicondition, and multiple chronic conditions. The search was restricted to adults older than 18 years and to English language publications. eligibility criteria We planned to summarise reports of novel indices and were primarily interested in the original report of each index. Therefore we excluded papers that either used existing indices or measured multimorbidity using only disease counts. In the initial screening process we included only the original form of each scale and not adaptations or updates; these were found later. Records that were not original research papers, such as conference abstracts, letters, and systematic reviews, were excluded. We defined multimorbidity as multiple cooccurring conditions without reference to a specific disease, so excluded papers were those that focused on comorbidities of an index disease or on comorbidities within one disease area (such as the coexistence of several psychiatric conditions). As most people with multimorbidity are adults living in the community and managed in primary care, we excluded articles about children, animals, or people admitted to hospital or living in residential care. We included studies of hospital inpatients when the primary focus was follow up after discharge (for example, mortality one year later). As resources were limited, we excluded papers when full texts were not available in English. study selection Two authors used Covidence software independently to screen titles against exclusion criteria and the subsequent abstracts against the same criteria. 8 We then extracted the full texts of relevant abstracts for further screening. Any disagreements at the title, abstract, and full text stages were resolved by discussion, and a third author mediated unresolved conflicts. We excluded papers that referred to an existing index, but listed the indices that were used when excluding them at the abstract stage. We found the original papers describing these indices and returned them to the title screening stage. Additional relevant titles were found by reviewing previous systematic reviews on this topic, searching the bibliographies of included full text papers, and tracking their citations using Google Scholar. Emerging relevant titles were added to the screening process.",

It focuses on risk of bias and applicability in prediction model studies. 10 As our search was not restricted to prediction models, it was not appropriate to apply this tool to every paper. We therefore developed our own list of criteria having referred to resources available for assessing clinical prediction indices. 1113 Our assessment aimed to deal with risk of selection, observer, and funding bias. The list contained 10 questions on the population tested, description of the index, statistical methods, validity, and funding. The assessment tool is available in the appendix (appendix eTable 2), including division into domains. We also included an overall impression of the papers' risk of bias based on the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network standard, which was scored separately to the criteria rather than in an additive fashion. 14 Two reviewers independently assessed each paper and resolved disagreements by discussion.",

Most of the original papers (27, 77%) contained sufficient information for readers to use the index, usually with lists of included conditions with or without weighting. Of the remainder, access to additional free resources was needed in four, 30 43 45 47 information from proprietary scales was needed in one, 51 and two were missing information that would allow the index to be applied. 18 31 One index was only available as proprietary software. 34 52 Some of the indices, although designed to measure multimorbidity, were developed in cohorts of people with a specific disease, and therefore this condition was not included in the list of comorbidities. 23 31 Most indices were based on diagnoses or drugs, but two indices required results of laboratory or other investigations. 21 47 The provenance of papers will affect their applicability to other settings. For example, the majority of papers came from the US where the predominant health system is commercial and healthcare costs are of interest to insurers. Some of the indices were designed with a particular population in mind, such as the questionnaire for Indian primary care. This included diseases that are less prevalent in other geographical areas, such as filariasis and tuberculosis, which might limit generalisability. 51 Other original indices have domains that might be outdated. One example is the Charlson comorbidity index. 35 This index assigns the maximum weight of 6 points to AIDS, but the life expectancy for HIV/AIDS in high income countries has changed considerably since the index's publication in 1987. 53 Although several papers mentioned outcomes as relevant to patient experience, only one clearly described involving patients in the study design, by developing their rating scale with focus groups. 37 summary of evidence Appendix eTables 3 to 6 summarise all included papers according to their index's original purpose, components and outcome variables, and information used. The data source, location, and demographics of the population used to derive or test the measure are listed as they are relevant for context. Our overall recommendations are also included. In appendix eTable 3, the index components are weighted condition counts, in appendix eTable 4, the index compo nents are conditions with additional parameters, in appen dix eTable 5 they are weighted drug counts, and appendix eTable 6 comprises the remain der, including diagnostic groups and physiological measures.

Where papers discussed specific findings relating to multimorbidity and mental health, we present their conclusions. risk of reporting bias within studies Using our quality assessment tool, we classified six papers as high quality with little or no risk of bias in reporting 22 24 27 32 37 49 and seven as low quality with moderate to high risk of bias. 23 28 34 35 36 41 42 The remaining 22 papers were of satisfactory quality. Of the five domains we assessed, the best reported were index description and funding source. Validity and statistical methods were the least well reported across all papers. Table 2 shows the scores for all papers across each domain. As we had agreed in advance to judge the overall impression without summing domain scores, the domain scores did not always lead to the same overall impression. For example, one study was given an overall impression of satisfactory with a total domain score of 6, 48 whereas another study scored 8 and was also deemed satisfactory. 51 risk of bias across studies It was not possible to quantify publication bias owing to the variety of methods and outcomes used. It is likely that more unpublished methods of measuring multimorbidity exist and are used in clinical practice, especially tailored to specific patient populations or available clinical information.",

The number of citations for each year since publication ranged from three 41 to 949, 35 with a median of 8.8 (interquartile range 5.3 16.2). This information is listed alongside measures of the indices' performance at predicting outcomes and validation in appendix eTables 9 (indices without external validation) and 10 (externally validated indices). Sixteen original papers described designing indices within a derivation cohort and testing their ability to predict specific outcomes within a separate validation set. 20 49 50 Fourteen original papers measured an index's performance at predicting outcomes 17 43 47 and three only measured ability to predict outcomes. 17 24 32 Among the indices that were externally validated, 11 were tested at predicting different or additional outcomes to those in the original index design. 20 24 26 3236 39 43 47 Some indices were tested against other indices that had been developed with different original outcomes-for example, the Charlson index where the outcome in question was admission to hospital 43 or health related quality of life. 20 updates and adaptations Thirteen (37%) of the indices had updates or adap tations published, by either original or separate research teams. These revised versions included updated comorbidities or weights, focused on specific patient groups, or mapped a clinical index to codes for administrative data. Two of the indices are risk adjustment methods undergoing regular review and updates. 26 34 The relevant indices are listed in appendix eTable 11 alongside a summary of their adaptations and updates and any reported performance metrics. The older and widely used indices such as Charlson, Chronic Disease Score, and Cumulative Illness Rating Scale have been adapted and updated many times; we include the most cited versions. Most updated indices are broadly based on the aim and outcome measures of the original, with some exceptions. 5760 Of the indices that were not updated, in some cases this was because the original index was unsuccessful at predicting specific outcomes 37 or was not designed for use outside of the original study. 30 ",

We chose to make this distinction because indices tend to include multi ple parameters to quantify different aspects of multimorbidity and use sophisticated models to predict outcomes. However, as disease counts are the most commonly used method of measuring multimorbidity, their exclusion is a limitation of our work. 4 The ease of applying disease counts means they are frequently used and they are comparable between studies as long as the list of candidate conditions is clear. 62 One paper in this review reported that a count of diagnosis clusters was a better predictor of healthcare expenditure than more complex indices. 23 Other research has drawn similar conclusions. 63 64 Reviewing the use of disease counts is outside the scope of this paper and has been discussed elsewhere. 6567 Simple counts of drugs have also been shown to predict healthcare use and mortality, 68 and using these or disease counts are more practical than indices in many settings. For example, they are used in clinical care, as they do not require calculations or particular software, or in large population studies where the impact of each condition on individuals is unknown. 6 As this review is aimed at those undertaking population or community research, we also exclu ded studies of people who had been admitted to hospital or live in residential care. This meant that several commonly used indices were not included in this review, such as the Elixhauser index. 69 We did include the Charlson, PROFUND, SelfAdministered Comorbidity Questionnaire, and HighRisk Diagno ses for the Elderly Scale indices as although the studies recruited hospital patients, they did so when the patients were discharged, and the main period of interest was later, in the community setting. 27 29 35 47 Some of the indices have been in use for many years and have several adaptations. The Charlson index is the most widely known and warranted its own systematic review within a medical specialty (critical care) 70 ; we have only briefly summarised its performance and the principal adaptations. More information is available in another systematic review on this topic. 71 Some of the indices were specifically designed for use with administrative data. These might have scored more poorly on quality assessment as our tool focused on reporting and clinical applicability. Our search also included papers that compared different measurements of multimorbidity but that were not intended for clinical use. 46 We included these papers for completeness when they met our inclusion criteria. We aimed to find measures of multimorbidity, and our exclusion criteria included studies of comorbidity with a specific index disease. However, in two of the papers studied the indices had been developed in populations with one condition only, either hypertension 23 or type 2 diabetes. 31 We referred to our protocol and included these studies because their aim was to study multimorbidity rather than comorbidities of those conditions as index diseases. These papers are, however, less generalisable to the general population.",

We included a variety of studies measuring multimorbidity from different perspectives, which is a strength over previous more specific reviews. 71 We generated overall impressions of the risk of reporting bias and recommendations for index use, to provide a guide for researchers when choosing an index. Samples in the included studies were, however, heterogeneous, and the indices had varied purposes and components. Therefore, our recommendations are subjective. Formally comparing the predictive ability of the indices is outside the scope of this work but has been comprehensively performed by other investigators. 68 7274 comparison with previous literature The two most recent similar systematic reviews to ours did not formally assess the quality of publications. 34 Fifteen (43%) of the indices we included were published after 2009 and therefore would not have been found by the searches in these previous reviews. This is out of proportion to the increase in multimorbidity publications since 2010, suggesting that many recent papers have used either older measures or disease counts. 2 A newer systematic review on this topic focused only on tools used on administrative data and conducted its search in 2012. 71 A systematic review of multimorbidity systematic reviews, published in 2018, focused on definitions and measurement. 5 However, it did not include a search for new indices, thereby also omitting the 15 papers published since 2010.",

We found no specific index for investigating the interplay between mental and physical multimorbidity, although this issue is dealt with in a variety of ways across the measures. The array of index components and outcomes means that a validated measure exists for many applications, including clinical, research, and cost prediction. It is important when choosing an index to consider its original purpose and the outcomes for which it is validated. Given the differing methodologies of multimorbidity research, it would not be appropriate to assume that a single index could definitively measure multimorbidity in all settings. However, with this research area at risk of saturation, we propose that anyone measuring multimorbidity should study existing indices before developing new ones.",
