            "text": "Respiratory diseases are a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in many tropical countries, including Lao PDR. However, little has been published regarding viral or bacterial pathogens that can contribute to influenza-like illness (ILI) in a community setting. We report on the results of a community-based surveillance that prospectively monitored the incidence of ILI and its causative pathogens in Vientiane capital in Lao PDR. A cohort of 995 households, including 4885 study participants, were followed-up between May 2015 and May 2016. Nasopharyngeal swabs, throat swabs, and sputum specimens were collected from ILI cases identified through active case-finding. Real-Time PCR was used to test nasopharyngeal swabs for 21 respiratory pathogens, while throat and sputum samples were subjected to bacterial culture. Generalized linear mixed models were used to assess potential risk factors for associations with ILI. In total, 548 episodes of ILI were reported among 476 (9.7%) of the study participants and 330 (33.2%) of the study households. The adjusted estimated incidence of ILI within the study area was 10.7 (95%CI: 9.4-11.9) episodes per 100 personyears. ILI was significantly associated with age group (p<0.001), sex (p<0.001), and number of bedrooms (p = 0.04) in multivariate analysis. In 548 nasopharyngeal swabs, the most commonly detected potential pathogens were Streptococcus pneumoniae (17.0%), Staphylococcus aureus (11.3%), influenza A (11.1%; mostly subtype H3N2), rhinovirus (7.5%), and influenza B (8.0%). Streptococci were isolated from 42 (8.6%) of 536 throat swabs, most (27) of which were Lancefield Group G. Co-infections were observed in 132 (24.1%) of the 548 ILI episodes. Our study generated valuable data on respiratory disease burden and patterns of etiologies associated with community-acquired acute respiratory illness Laos.",

Endemic, emerging, and re-emerging respiratory diseases may threaten both local and global populations, as has been highlighted with the emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 [1] , followed by outbreaks of the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 [2] . Among the 5,942 million deaths in children under 5 in 2015, 15.5% were due to pneumonia [3] . Southeast Asia is thought to play a particularly important role in the global circulation of respiratory pathogens such as seasonal influenza A/H3N2 [4] [5] [6] . However, epidemiological surveillance of respiratory pathogens in Southeast Asia has been limited compared with the western hemisphere [7] . Furthermore, the socio-economic, demographic and environmental factors that influence disease burden and transmission dynamics can vary substantially both within and between hemispheres [7, 8] . Thus, characterizing local epidemiology and burden of respiratory pathogens is crucial for appropriate public health decisions.",

Since 2006, the National Center for Laboratory and Epidemiology of Lao PDR (NCLE) has developed laboratory, surveillance, and epidemiological capacity and was designated as the World Health Organization (WHO) National Influenza Center in 2010 [10] . In 2009-2010, identification of the viral etiologies in 292 patients hospitalized for acute lower respiratory illness (ALRI) showed these were mainly due to rhinoviruses (35%), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV, 26%). Other etiologic agents were influenza (12%), parainfluenza viruses (9%), adenoviruses (6%), Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV),and corona viruses (4%), and Human Bocavirus (HboV) (3%) [11] . Streptococcus pneumoniae and Hempplilus influenza were the main bacterial pathogens causing ALRI in hospitalized children [12] .",

With the assistance of Gavi, the country introduced the conjugated pneumococcal vaccine PCV13 into its NIP in October 2013. The schedule was for PCV13 vaccination to be given to infants at 6, 10, 14 weeks. The results of two cross-sectional community carriage surveys pre-and two years post-PCV13 introduction showed a significant 23% reduction in carriage prevalence of PCV13-related strains in 12-23-month-old children [14] . The prevalence of carriage of PCV13 strains was also lower in 5-8-week-old infants, suggesting evidence of herd immunity in this age group [14] . Japanese encephalitis vaccine and inactivated polio vaccine were introduced in 2015; and a second dose of measles-rubella vaccine targeting children 12-18 months in 2017 [13] . Despite a clear increase in NIP vaccines, pockets of suboptimal vaccination delivery and utilization persist, mostly in ethnic minority groups and remote rural areas [13] . A seasonal influenza vaccination program with trivalent inactivated was launched in 2012 for high-risk adults including pregnant women [15] .",

However, the clinical significance of the bacteria was frequently difficult to establish. Co-detection was identified in 24.1% of ILI cases, with influenza (A and B) and Streptococcus pneumoniae being the most common combination. Recently, new evidence has emerged regarding an interaction between these two pathogens. Some authors believe that influenza induces susceptibility to secondary pneumococcal infections while others reject the unidirectional effect of the virus on Streptococcus pneumoniae by arguing that asymptomatic pneumococcal carriage may be an indicator of subsequent influenza virus infection ( [38] and references therein). It is also important to note that we did not detect a statistically significant association between Streptococcus pneumoniae and influenza; thus, the relatively high frequency of these co-infections does not necessarily support hypotheses for influenza-induced susceptibility to pneumococcal infection (or vice versa). We did, however, observe a significant association between Streptococcus pneumoniae and H. influenzae infection. A synergistic association between these agents has previously been observed in children [39] , and also in an experimental study on Chinchillas [40] , with the latter suggesting that H. influenzae co-infection promotes pneumococcal biofilm formation and persistence.",

In addition, self-reported date of symptom onset may not be an accurate proxy for identifying primary and secondary cases within household clusters.

As a consequence, the high rate detection of these bacteria in our study could reflect the carriage in the study population, independently of ILI. Also, while the community-based design is appropriate for identifying and estimating the incidence of circulating respiratory pathogens, hospital-based surveillance is better powered for identifying the causative agents in more severe clinical cases.",

The major strength of this study is that it considered a much more comprehensive range of pathogens, including both bacterial and viral agents, than is typically covered in ILI surveillance studies, particularly in developing country settings. The study could also have some direct benefits for the study population. For example, it may lead some participants to seek medical attention more often than they normally would, thus benefiting participants by increased medical attention. Second, public health interventions and measures may be influenced by the results of this study through a better understanding of the etiology of respiratory disease in this setting.",

Establishment of a surveillance strategy in Laos to monitor trends in the epidemiology and burden of acute respiratory infections, and for early detection of emerging pathogens, is required to minimize their impact on human health.",
