            "text": "Genome signatures are data vectors derived from the compositional statistics of DNA. The self-organizing map (SOM) is a neural network method for the conceptualisation of relationships within complex data, such as genome signatures. The various parameters of the SOM training phase are investigated for their effect on the accuracy of the resulting output map. It is concluded that larger SOMs, as well as taking longer to train, are less sensitive in phylogenetic classifi cation of unknown DNA sequences. However, where a classifi cation can be made, a larger SOM is more accurate. Increasing the number of iterations in the training phase of the SOM only slightly increases accuracy, without improving sensitivity. The optimal length of the DNA sequence k-mer from which the genome signature should be derived is 4 or 5, but shorter values are almost as effective. In general, these results indicate that small, rapidly trained SOMs are generally as good as larger, longer trained ones for the analysis of genome signatures. These results may also be more generally applicable to the use of SOMs for other complex data sets, such as microarray data.",

Construction of a phylogenetic tree under such circumstances becomes impossible. One method that has been suggested for the study of distant evolutionary relationships is that of genomic signatures or genome signatures \u2020 (Karlin and Ladunga, 1994; Karlin and Burge, 1995; Karlin and Mrazek, 1996) .

            "text": "As long DNA sequences began to be isolated and computers entered the biological laboratory, it became a simple matter to produce nearest-neighbour frequency tables. Indeed, for any DNA sequence of length N, it is theoretically possible to derive frequency tables for all k-mers ranging from 1 to N, within that sequence. The frequency table at k = 1 corresponds to the raw nucleotide content on one strand. On the assumption that DNA is double stranded under most circumstances in most species, the complementary bases are also scored. This reduces the raw count of the four bases to a single value, between zero and one, representing the GC content of that DNA sequence. Correspondingly, at k = 2, the raw count of 16 dinucleotide frequencies, can be reduced to a vector containing 10 values if the count for each dimer on the top strand is added to the count for its complement on the other strand. There are 10 values, not 8, in this vector since GC, CG, AT and TA are self-complementary. This process \u2020 Both genome signature and genomic signature are used interchangeably in the fi eld, including by their originators. However, the term genome signature is to be preferred, since genomic signature is used in the fi eld of molecular diagnostics to refer to a genotype correlated with medical symptoms or prognosis (e.g. Russo et al. 2005) is called symmetrization (Karlin and Ladunga, 1994) . The symmetrized values in the vector are then usually corrected for the frequencies of their component monomers, as follows:",

However, recent work has established that genome signatures within species may be stable over lengths as short as 10 kb (Deschavanne et al. 1999; Karlin, 2001; Abe et al. 2002) or less (Sandberg et al. 2001; Jernigan and Baran, 2002; Abe et al. 2003a; Sandberg et al. 2003; McHardy et al. 2007 ). This has led to their practical applica-tion in the detection of pathenogenicity islands (pIs) in pathogenic bacteria. These are sequences originating in horizontal transmission from one bacterium to another, converting a previously innocuous strain into a pathogenic one. Their foreign origin is often reflected in a genome signature closer to their species of origin than their current host genome (Karlin, 1998; Karlin, 2001; Dufraigne et al. 2005) .",

Coenye and Vandamme (2004) have shown that dinucleotide content is only a reliable indicator of relatedness for closely related organisms. To visualize genome signature relationships between species, a variety of other representational schemes have been used including histograms , partial ordering graphs , chaos games (Deschavanne et al. 1999; Edwards et al. 2002; Wang et al. 2005) , and self-organizing maps (Abe et al. 2003b) .",

            "text": "This paper uses self-organizing maps (SOMs) as a tool to explore genome signature variability at phylogenetic levels from superkingdom down to genus. The SOM is a neural network method which spreads multi-dimensional data onto a twodimensional surface (Kohonen, 1997) . Its endpoint is therefore similar to multi-dimensional scaling or principal components analysis, and like these other techniques has been extensively used in biology, principally for the analysis of microarray data but also to a lesser extent for sequence analysis (Arrigo et al. 1991; Giuliano et al. 1993; Andrade et al. 1997; Tamayo et al. 1999; Kanaya et al. 2001; Wang et al. 2001; Abe et al. 2002; Covell et al. 2003; Ressom et al. 2003; Xiao et al. 2003; Mahony et al. 2004; Oja et al. 2005; Abe et al. 2006; Samsonova et al. 2006 ). The resulting \"fl at\" representation may be a strong aid to intuitive understanding of the structure of complex multidimensional datasets. The SOM is not a clustering technique per se, but the surface may be divided up into zones that are then treated as clusters. Alternatively, cluster boundaries on the surface may be defi ned more objectively using additional algorithms (Ultsch, 1993) . The SOM is also not hierarchical (unlike UPGMA but like K-means clustering, two other commonly used techniques for the analysis of microarrays). This absence of hierarchy means that it is particularly suited to situations where the natural hierarchy of species relationships, refl ecting evolutionary descent, may have been violated, e.g. by horizontal gene transfer.",

New values of \u03b1,\u03c4 and \u211c are then calculated, and the second iteration can commence. It can be intuitively grasped that there is a great deal of \"churn\" in initial iterations of the SOM. When \u03b1 is close to 1, data vectors will effectively change their winning weight vector to copies of themselves. Only at the limits of the trained area R will the effect be subtler. However, as the number of iterations mounts, \u03b1 will decrease and each data vector will have a relatively weaker effect on its winning weight vector and even less on those weight vectors in its vicinity. Observation (data not shown) of distribution of a simple data set over a SOM through the iterative process shows that a relatively chaotic process dominates until approximately halfway through the nominated number of iterations, at which point structure rapidly builds in the SOM. The fi nal 10% or so of iterations consist mostly of fi ne-tuning of the fi nal weight vector values. Training SOMs can also be time consuming, especially for large data sets of high dimensionality vectors trained over large numbers of iterations. The longest run presented here (that in Fig. 2 ) took in excess of 3 weeks on a single 2.8 GHz Intel processor under a Linux operating system. One of the major motivations of this paper was to defi ne ways to reduce SOM training time without losing accuracy or sensitivity.",

A perfectly partitioned SOM will therefore have a ratio of infi nity, indicating no mixed cells, or more accurately no cells with greater than 5% mixture of the \"wrong\" family. Figure 5 demonstrates that family level taxonomy is better determined at higher GS in all fi ve families of herpesviruses. The ratio of high alpha-density (>95%, red) to medium alpha-density (5% to 95%, yellow) increases from 0.88 to 2.83 as the GS increases from 2 to 4. The corresponding increases for the beta and gamma families are from 0.52 to 2.33 and from 1.91 to 2.11 respectively. For the ostreid herpesviral sequences, perfect partition is reached at GS-4 and for the ictalurid viruses at GS-3.

However, longer k results in longer data vectors, increasing at order 4 k and therefore much slower training of the SOM. One way to speed training of the SOM is simply to reduce the number of training cycles. The effect of the number of iterations on density of each family is displayed in Figure 6 . Figure 6 shows that increasing the number of iterations has a mixed effect on the density of family sequences. The alpha herpesviral sequences increase in density from 0.92 to 1.35 as the number of iterations increases from 10 to 1000, and the beta herpesviruses from 0.52 to 0.83. The ostreid herpesviral sequences are also perfectly clustered at 100 iterations. However, the gamma and ictalurid sequences are more poorly partitioned at higher numbers of iterations.",

To provide a further more quantitative assessment of the parameters of the process, a jack-knifi ng analysis was carried out. All herpesviral sequences were divided randomly into two groups. Genome signatures and SOMs were constructed as appropriate using one half. Then the remaining half was applied to the SOM to predict their origin at the family and genus level. To make a prediction concerning the origin of a data vector, the Euclidean distances between that vector and all of the weight vectors of the preconstructed SOM, are calculated. The origin of the nearest weight vector is taken to be the classifi cation of the data vector being tested. Where a data vector falls into a cell on the SOM containing none of the original data vectors used to construct the SOM, its origin is deemed to be \"undecided\" (Fig. 7) .",

            "text": "Genome signatures provide a summary of the k-mer content of a genome, corrected for compositional bias. Various studies in a wide range of species have revealed that genome signatures are generally constant within genomes and similar in related genomes (Karlin and Ladunga, 1994; Karlin et al. 1998; Gentles and Karlin, 2001) . The extent to which this is a phenomenon of neutral drift or one of active conservation is unknown. It is intuitively obvious that two identical genomes will have identical genome signatures, and that as they diverge the genome signatures will also diverge. Indeed this is the basis of a least one bioinformatical tool that assesses sequence relatedness Li et al. 2002) . However, various suggestions have been made for conservative selection pressures which would act to maintain genome signature similarity in related organisms, including dinucleotide stacking energies, curvature, methylation, superhelicity, context-dependent mutation biases and effects deriving from related replication machinery (Karlin and Burge, 1995; Blaisdell et al. 1996) . If these factors are similar within a clade, they might act as a brake on genome signature divergence. The conservation of genome signatures within genomes (which is what originally gave rise to the term \"signature\" in this context) would tend to suggest that signatures do not drift neutrally, at least within genomes. Figure 1 demonstrates that at the phylum level within the three superkingdoms of cellular life, satisfactory partition of GS-2 can be obtained by the SOM. However, this is less true for eubacteria than it is for eukaryotes and archaea. At the family level in viruses the picture is considerably more confused, with only the Baculoviridae demonstrating anything like territorial coherence on the SOM at GS-2 ( Fig.  1 and 2 ). This may well be a refl ection of speed of substitution in viral genomes. However at the species level, the same coherence within genomes as found in cellular organisms may well be the norm. For instance, when the ostreid and ictalurid herpesvirus families are included in a SOM with the Alloherpesviridae, these two families, both represented by a single viral genome, have strongly discrete areas on the SOM (Fig. 3 and 4) .",
