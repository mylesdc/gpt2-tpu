We expressed the antiviral lectin griffithsin (GRFT), which shows potent neutralizing activity against HIV, in the endosperm of transgenic rice plants (Oryza sativa), to determine whether rice can be used to produce inexpensive GRFT as a microbicide ingredient. The yield of OS GRFT in the best-performing plants was 223 lg/g dry seed weight. We also established a onestep purification protocol, achieving a recovery of 74% and a purity of 80%, which potentially could be developed into a larger-scale process to facilitate inexpensive downstream processing. OS GRFT bound to HIV glycans with similar efficiency to GRFT produced in Escherichia coli. Wholecell assays using purified OS GRFT and infectivity assays using crude extracts of transgenic rice endosperm confirmed that both crude and pure OS GRFT showed potent activity against HIV and the crude extracts were not toxic towards human cell lines, suggesting they could be administered as a microbicide with only minimal processing. A freedom-to-operate analysis confirmed that GRFT produced in rice is suitable for commercial development, and an economic evaluation suggested that 1.8 kg/ha of pure GRFT could be produced from rice seeds. Our data therefore indicate that rice could be developed as an inexpensive production platform for GRFT as a microbicide component.",

The yield of recombinant GRFT in E. coli ( EC GRFT) was 819 mg per litre of culture medium but 33% of the protein accumulated as inclusion bodies and was therefore misfolded and nonfunctional . In contrast, the transient expression of GRFT in N. benthamiana using a vector based on tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) resulted in the production of up to 1 g of soluble GRFT per kg of fresh leaf weight (O'Keefe et al., 2009) . Even so, the transient expression of microbicides in leafy crops has several drawbacks, including the need to process the tissue immediately after harvest to prevent protein degradation, and the need for complete purification due to the presence of toxic metabolites in tobacco and endotoxins produced by the infiltrating bacteria (Arfi et al., 2015) .",

The final yield of OS GRFT after purification was 223 lg/g dry seed weight, which represents a recovery of 74%. The presence of OS GRFT in the crude extracts was confirmed by reducing sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, showing a visible band of~15 kDa, the anticipated molecular mass of His 6 -tagged GRFT (Figure 2a) . The presence of OS GRFT was confirmed by immunoblotting and detection using a primary rabbit anti-GRFT Figure 1 (a) GRFT accumulation in rice endosperm. An immunoglobulinspecific sandwich ELISA was used to screen the three best-performing independent events. The ELISA plate was coated with gp120, and GRFT protein assembly was confirmed using a primary rabbit anti-GRFT polyclonal antiserum and a secondary HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antiserum. Four serial dilutions per sample are shown (neat, 1/2, 1/4 and 1/ 8). WT, wild-type extracts; C \u00c0 , negative control (PBS); C + , GRFT purified from E. coli (500 ng/mL) as a positive control.

The expression cassette comprised the endosperm-specific maize zein promoter, the rice a-amylase 3A signal peptide sequence (SP), a His 6 tag, the GRFT coding region (grft) and the nos terminator (t-nos). (Figure 2b ). This revealed an intense band at 14.6 kDa, the correct size for His 6 -tagged GRFT, and another at 16-17 kDa probably representing the incomplete removal of the rice a-amylase (RAmy3D) signal peptide which is 25 residues in length and has a predicted molecular mass of 2.6 kDa. Alternatively, the additional band may reflect O-linked glycosylation at one of the multiple serine or threonine residues of GRFT. No degradation products were present, suggesting the protein remained stable in the rice endosperm tissue (Figure 2b ).",

Extracts from all three transgenic lines showed greater gp120-binding activity than the wildtype endosperm extracts as expected, which confirmed that the OS GRFT was functional and that endogenous plant lectins do not interfere with binding. Furthermore, crude endosperm extracts containing OS GRFT bound to gp120 in a concentration-dependent manner, with binding behaviour nearly identical to that of EC GRFT.

            "text": "We created transgenic rice plants expressing GRFT under the control of an endosperm-specific promoter and recovered 13 independent transgenic events, three of which were selected for further investigation because they produced T1 seeds in numbers sufficient for analysis. This is the first time that GRFT has been expressed in stably transformed plants and the first time it has been expressed in cereal seeds. Line 6 was selected for additional experiments because T1 seeds produced the highest yields of OS GRFT (301 lg/g dry seed weight). GRFT has been produced at higher levels by transient expression in N. benthamiana (1 mg/g after 12 days), but this was reduced to 300 lg/g after purification, which is only slightly higher than our yields of pure protein (223 lg/g dry seed weight) and similar to the yield of 350 lg/g reported for another lectin (CV-N) produced in transgenic soybean (O\u1fbdKeefe et al., 2015) . It is also likely that our T1 yields can be improved further by breeding line 6 to homozygosity, as demonstrated for other recombinant proteins produced in cereal seeds (Hood et al., 2012) . For example, the monoclonal antibody 2G12 was expressed in rice seeds with a yield of 37 lg/g in the T1 generation but this increased to 46 lg/g in the T3 generation after two rounds of self-pollination (Vamvaka et al., 2015) . Furthermore, 2G12 was expressed in maize seeds with a yield of 75 lg/g, which was increased to 100 lg/g by passaging the transgenic plants through a dedifferentiation-differentiation cycle (Ramessar et al., 2008b) . The number and nature of purification steps and the overall cost of processing are key issues that determine the commercial viability of recombinant proteins expressed in plants. Mori et al. (2005) purified the native GRFT from Griffithsia spp. by ammonium sulphate precipitation, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, anion-exchange chromatography, reversed-phase chromatography and size exclusion chromatography to yield a homogeneous, highly pure and biologically active protein. We found that ammonium sulphate precipitation did not work for OS GRFT even when combined with ethanol precipitation. However, protein extraction using a phosphate buffer combined with IMAC achieved 74% recovery and 80% purity. Giomarelli et al. (2006) purified soluble EC GRFT by IMAC using Ni-NTA resin and the dialysed protein was then applied to a TALON IMAC resin before stepwise elution using two buffers containing different amounts of imidazole, achieving 53% recovery. Ishag et al. (2013) used IMAC followed by elution in a buffer containing 250 mM imidazole before further purification by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 75 column. The resulting purified protein contained both the monomeric and dimeric forms of GRFT but the final purity and recovery were not reported. Finally, Xue et al. (2013) used a nickel-chelating column and eluted GRFT with 500 mM imidazole, refolding the protein by dropwise addition to a low-salt refolding buffer before final purification using C4 reversed-phase chromatography, but again no data were reported for purity and recovery. When GRFT was produced in N. benthamiana, the first purification step involved the removal of the TMV vector coat protein by filtration through a ceramic membrane, followed by ion-exchange chromatography over SP-Sepharose resin, ultrafiltration/diafiltration to concentrate the protein and elution with 100 mM NaCl, achieving >99.8% purity albeit with only 30% recovery as stated above (O'Keefe et al., 2009) . We used nondenaturing conditions to prepare the protein extract thus keeping GRFT in its native confirmation to avoid the need for a refolding step. The protein was captured on a Profinity IMAC column and eluted with 250 mM imidazole. This is the first one-step purification procedure reported for GRFT, and although the purity was lower than that reported by O'Keefe et al. (2009) , the use of rice as a production platform means that stringent purity is unnecessary because the plant matrix is safe for mucosal applications Xie et al., 2008) . The large-scale production and purification of GRFT could be facilitated by exploiting its stability, because it remains soluble and functional at temperatures up to~80\u00b0C, whereas most plant host cell proteins precipitate below this temperature (Moulaei et al., 2010; Zi o\u0142kowska et al., 2007b) . Fuqua et al. (2015) demonstrated that the purity of GRFT extracts can increase by 30%-40% at temperatures exceeding 50\u00b0C, and using this approach, they achieved a recovery rate of 88 AE 5% compared to the initial extract.",

Because the gel was run under denaturing conditions, the additional band is unlikely to represent a conformational isomer or the presence of a noncovalent binding partner. It is possible that GRFT undergoes partial post-translational modification and is therefore present in two forms, but the GRFT sequence does not contain an N-glycan acceptor site so only O-linked glycans would account for the difference in mobility (2-3 kDa). A more likely explanation is the incomplete removal of the rice a-amylase (RAmy3D) signal peptide, which is 25 residues in length and has a predicted molecular mass of 2.6 kDa.",

Our data confirmed that GRFT is deposited predominantly in the PSVs, like other recombinant proteins expressed in cereal endosperm bearing a signal peptide but no further targeting information. For example, a recombinant fungal phytase was directed to the PSVs in rice and wheat, and the HIV-neutralizing antibody 2G12 was deposited in the PSVs of maize and rice (Arcalis et al., 2004; Drakakaki et al., 2006; Peters et al., 2013; Vamvaka et al., 2015) . Furthermore, Drakakaki et al. (2006) described the presence of recombinant phytase in ER-derived protein bodies, and the expression of antibody 2G12 altered the morphology of zein bodies in maize and induced the formation of novel ER-derived protein bodies in rice (Peters et al., 2013; Vamvaka et al., 2015) . In contrast, we found that GRFT was localized almost exclusively in the PSVs and could easily be extracted with PBS even though most of the surrounding endogenous seed storage proteins are not soluble under these conditions. The ability of GRFT to retain its independent solubility suggests that it does not interact with the storage proteins, for example by the formation of disulphide bonds (Peters et al., 2013) .",

GRFT interacts with a number of viruses, but shows particular potency against HIV because it can bind to multiple sites on gp120 . We therefore compared the biological activity of purified OS GRFT, crude extracts containing OS GRFT and purified EC GRFT, by testing their ability to bind gp120-IIIB in vitro. We found that OS GRFT and EC GRFT bound to gp120 with near identical binding characteristics and that the crude extracts showed similar binding activity to the pure proteins once the concentration of GRFT in the extracts was taken into account. Similarly, O'Keefe et al. (2009) showed that N. benthamiana GRFT had similar or even better gp120-binding activity than EC GRFT, which in turn retained the gp120-binding activity of the native GRFT protein (Giomarelli et al., 2002) .",

However, O'Keefe et al. (2009) reported an EC 50 value of 0.054 nM for native GRFT and 0.156 nM for tobaccoderived GRFT. These discrepancies reflect the inherent variability of the syncytium inhibition assay, which is suitable for comparisons within an experiment (where 2-to threefold differences are not regarded as significant) but not across studies in different laboratories, particularly when different HIV strains and assay protocols are used (Forthal et al., 2010; Rademacher et al., 2008) .",

We found that OS GRFT did not stimulate the proliferation of the CEM-SS T-lymphocytic cell line used in the cytotoxicity assays (Figure 5a ) which at this stage provides confidence that the product does not cause immune cell activation, although further more detailed studies involving the analysis of cytokine levels would be required during preclinical development.",

We carried out infectivity assays using TZM-bl cells, which confirmed the potent activity of rice crude extracts containing OS GRFT against HIV-1 and achieved almost 100% prevention of infection. In terms of safety, cellular models are used to assess the potential cytotoxicity of microbicides, often by measuring the cleavage of a tetrazolium salt (MTT) into a bluecoloured product (formazan) in viable cells (Slater et al., 1963) . We found that crude rice endosperm extracts at dilutions of 1/4 and higher showed no significant cytotoxicity against the TZM-bl HeLa cervical epithelium cell line, suggesting that microbicides based on crude rice endosperm extracts are unlikely to cause cytotoxic effects when applied to mucosal surfaces. This result confirms earlier studies with N. benthamiana-produced GRFT, which confirmed its excellent safety profile (Kouokam et al., 2011) .",

Where high purity is not a major requirement (i.e. when using crude extracts for topical application), then the overall productivity of a rice production platform can be calculated based on the techno-economic evaluation presented by Nandi et al. (2002) . Assuming grain yields of up to 8 ton/ha, at least 1.8 kg of OS GRFT could be harvested per hectare, which is 4.5-fold higher than the~0.4 kg/ha of GRFT possible in N. benthamiana (O'Keefe et al., 2009 ) but lower than 6.6 kg/ha of pure CV-N produced in soybean seeds (O\u1fbdKeefe et al., 2015) . Kaufman and Kalaitzandonakes (2011) have shown that in order to scale up production to meet a demand of 1000 kg of purified recombinant protein per year, at least 550 ha would be required assuming no losses, and nearly 950 ha would be required to accommodate production risks of 20% and an anticipated recovery rate of 75%.",

The functionality of the crude and purified protein together with the absence of cytotoxicity shows that rice could be developed as a cost-effective production platform with minimal processing or one-step purification strategies, thus offering the prospect of inexpensive microbicides suitable for deployment in HIV-endemic areas.

The reaction was heated to 94\u00b0C for 3 min followed by 35 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 45 s, 60\u00b0C for 45 s and 72\u00b0C for 3 min, followed by a final extension step at 72\u00b0C for 10 min. The products were transferred to the shuttle vector pGEM-T Easy (Promega) and introduced into competent E. coli cells, which were incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C under ampicillin selection. The integrity of the plasmid DNA was confirmed by sequencing (Universidad Aut onoma de Barcelona, Spain) before digestion with SphI and SacI to release the expression cassette, which was then inserted into vector pgZ63 containing the endosperm-specific maize zein promoter (Naqvi et al., 2009) , the rice a-amylase 3A signal peptide sequence (GenBank CAA39776) and a sequence encoding a N-terminal His 6 affinity tag (Figure 1b) .",

The HIV-neutralizing activities of EC GRFT and OS GRFT were compared in CEM-SS cells challenged with HIV-1 RF (Gulakowski et al., 1991) . XTT was provided by the Drug Synthesis and Chemistry Branch, Developmental Therapeutics Program, Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis, National Cancer Institute. CEM-SS cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium without phenol red and supplemented with 5% foetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-glutamine and 50 lg/mL gentamicin (BioWhittaker). Exponentially growing cells were washed and resuspended in complete medium, and a 50-lL aliquot containing 5 9 10 3 cells was added to individual wells of a 96-well round-bottomed microtiter plate containing serial dilutions of EC GRFT or OS GRFT in 100 lL medium. Stock supernatants of HIV-1 RF were diluted in complete medium to yield sufficient cytopathicity (80%-90% cell death in 6 days), and a 50-lL aliquot was added to the appropriate wells. Additional control wells did not receive viral challenge so as to measure any compound-induced effect on cell growth. Plates were incubated for 6 days at 37\u00b0C and then stained with XTT to detect viable cells. The resulting data display both the protection of cells from the cytopathic effects of HIV-1 and any direct cytotoxic effects of the test compounds on CEM-SS cells. All experiments were carried out in triplicate. Cell and virus culture TZM-bl cells (NIH AIDS Reagent Program), a HeLa cell line expressing CD4, CCR5 and luciferase (Platt et al., 2009) , were grown in continual culture in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% foetal calf serum, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 lg/mL streptomycin and 2 mM L-glutamine.
