Spinal cord demyelination is also induced following intranasal inoculation with neurotropic MHV strains, however much higher viral doses are required as compared to intracranial inoculation. Recently, it was shown that intranasal administration of low concentrations of proteins leads to significant, rapid accumulation of protein in the optic nerve and in the eye, with only low levels reaching spinal cord and other brain regions. Thus, we examined whether intranasal inoculation with MHV at doses equivalent to those given intracranially could induce optic neuritis-inflammation, demyelination and loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in the optic nerve with or without inducing spinal cord demyelination. Four week old male C57BL/6J mice were inoculated intracranially with the recombinant demyelinating strain RSA59, or intranasally with RSA59 or the non-demyelinating strain RSMHV2 as control. One month post-inoculation, mice inoculated intracranially with RSA59 had significant myelin loss in both spinal cord and optic nerves, with significant loss of RGCs as well, consistent with prior studies. As expected, intranasal inoculation with RSA59 failed to induce demyelination in spinal cord; however, it also did not induce optic nerve demyelination. No acute inflammation was found, and no viral antigen was detected, in the optic nerve or retina 1 day after inoculation. Results confirm the neurotropic effects of RSA59 following intracranial inoculation, and suggest that direct infection with axonal transport of virus from brain to spinal cord and optic nerve is required to induce demyelinating disease. These studies suggest that MHV does not selectively concentrate in optic nerve and retina to sufficient levels to induce demyelination following intranasal inoculation. Intracranial inoculation should continue to be considered a preferred method for studies of MHV-induced optic neuritis and central nervous system (CNS) demyelinating disease.",

Inoculation with experimental neurotropic strains JHM and MHV-A59 induces a biphasic disease with acute meningoencephalitis (in first 10-14 days post inoculation) followed by subacute and chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease (Stohlman and Weiner, 1981; Lavi et al., 1984; Das Sarma et al., 2000) . Both JHM and MHV-A59 strains of MHV cause some subacute and chronic inflammatory demyelination in the brain, but a much larger disease burden in the spinal cord.

With intracranial inoculation, the inflammation is not limited to brain and spinal cord. MHV-A59 and recombinant strain RSA59 cause inflammation in optic nerve with subsequent demyelination of optic nerve and RGC loss (Shindler et al., 2008 (Shindler et al., , 2011 . Studies of isogenic recombinant strains RSA59 and RSMHV2 of demyelinating strain (MHV-A59) and non-demyelinating strain (MHV2), respectively, containing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) have elaborated the mechanisms of demyelination and axonal loss and have helped in tracking and tracing of virus in vitro as well as in vivo (Das Sarma et al., 2009) .

Endocytosis into olfactory sensory neurons followed by intraneuronal transport to the olfactory bulb, or transcellular transport to the lamina propria via sustentacular cells, have been suggested as potential intracellular pathways (Kristensson and Olsson, 1971; Broadwell and Balin, 1985; Thorne et al., 1995; Doty, 2008; Kristensson, 2011) . Delivery of large molecular weight biological therapies (e.g., stem cells, gene therapy vectors, and large proteins) to the CNS via intranasal administration has been explored as a potential method to treat multiple CNS diseases/disorders including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, multiple sclerosis, seizures, strokes, and psychiatric disorders (Costantino et al., 2007; Neuwelt et al., 2008; Dhuria et al., 2010) . Spread of smaller peptides through rodent brain following intranasal administration occurs rapidly, with diffuse brain distribution and greatest levels found in olfactory bulbs and trigeminal nerves, just 1 h after treatment. IGF-1 (MW = 7.65 kDa) is one of the most studied proteins using intranasal delivery to the CNS (Thorne et al., 2004) . Even entry of some high molecular weight proteins such as VEGF (MW = 38.2 kDa) to the CNS has been shown following intranasal administration (Yang et al., 2009) . Recently, it has been shown that proteins in a complex biologic therapy, ST266, administered via the intranasal route in rats reached the CNS within 30 min, and ST266 proteins were detected in the vitreous and the optic nerve at markedly higher concentrations than in the brain (Khan et al., 2017) , suggesting a rapid, direct nose-to-optic nerve delivery method for proteins. Whether viruses can follow similar pathways to preferentially spread to optic nerve at low inoculation titers has not been reported, but if such pathways are present, the rapid spread of virus could provide an additional mechanism for immune evasion and therefore promote viral infection at lower inoculation titers.",

Mice inoculated intranasally with RSA59 (C) or RSMHV2 did not show RGC loss (D) (scale bar = 50 \u00b5m). The total number of labeled RGCs present in 12 standardized retinal fields was counted. The average number of surviving RGCs/eye (n = 6/group) shows intracranial RSA59 induced a significant decrease in RGC numbers compared to control mice (**p < 0.01). Neither RSA59 nor RSMHV2 induced RGC loss compared to control mice when administered intranasally. RGC numbers in RSMHV2-infected mice were significantly higher than in mice intracranially inoculated with RSA59 (*p < 0.05) (E). Data comparisons were done by one-way ANOVA and Tukey's Multiple Comparison post-hoc testing with GraphPad Prism 6.0 software. inoculation rapidly induces similar optic nerve inflammation, optic nerve sections were stained with anti-Iba1 antibody. Sections from mock-infected mice were used to demonstrate resting levels of microglial staining. Iba-1 staining did not reveal any increased numbers of microglia/macrophages in optic nerve sections following intranasal viral inoculation as compared to mock-infected (Figure 4) . To confirm that lack of viral antigen detection in the optic nerve represents a failure of the virus to spread to optic nerve and retina, and not a failure to detect viral antigen, viral antigen was also examined in olfactory bulb sections from the same mice by autofluoresence of EGFP (Figures 4 J,K) as well as immunostaining with anti-viral nucleocapsid antisera (Figures 4 L,M) .",

Results suggest intracranial inoculation is the best method to induce neuroinflammation. In the current study, intracranial infection of RSA59 lead to chronic stage inflammation and demyelination in both the optic nerve and spinal cord. This result is consistent with earlier studies where intracranial inoculation of RSA59 or its parental strain MHV-A59 led to demyelination and axonal loss in spinal cord ) and optic nerve (Shindler et al., 2008 (Shindler et al., , 2011 . Induction of optic neuritis by intracranial inoculation of RSA59 is dependent on retrograde transport of viral antigen along RGC axons that occurs over several days and results in late stage demyelination (Shindler et al., 2011) as seen again in the current study. Together, spinal cord and optic nerve pathology observed after intracranial inoculation of RSA59 in the current study confirm that the viral titer used retains its previously identified ability to induce CNS demyelinating disease.",

In the current study, intranasal infection by RSA59 at the same dose used for intracranial inoculation was not able to induce any neuropathogenesis, either in optic nerve or spinal cord. Earlier studies with several other strains showed that intranasal inoculation of MHV can cause CNS disease, but much higher concentrations of virus were used than in intracranial inoculation studies. MHV-JHM enters the central nervous system (CNS) via the olfactory after intranasal inoculation . The intranasal inoculation of JHM strain can lead to encephalitis and demyelination. The OBLV strain of MHV can infect the main olfactory bulb (Schwob et al., 2001) . Intranasal inoculation of MHV-A59 can lead to hepatitis with measurable viral load in brain as well (Hemmila et al., 2004) . These studies did not report optic nerve pathogenesis following intranasal inoculation although it is not known if that was examined. There are several possible reasons that we did not see retinal infection or optic nerve inflammation and demyelination lesions after intranasal inoculation. Most likely, the dose of virus may have been too low to cause the pathogenesis. This finding was not unexpected in the spinal cord, where previous studies showed higher doses were necessary. However, based on the high levels of protein accumulation in optic nerve and eye following intranasal inoculation (Khan et al., 2017) , it was anticipated that RSA59 would also preferentially accumulate in the eye, but results suggest that higher doses are likely required. Alternatively, the intranasal inoculation may be less effective for inducing optic neuritis and retinal lesions than the intracerebral route because of the longer distance required for the virus to travel to the eye if it travels via axonal transport and neuronneuron spread similar to what has been observed following intracranial inoculation (Das Sarma et al., 2009; Shindler et al., 2011) .",

            "text": "The precise mechanisms mediating spread of a virus or a drug from the nose to various CNS regions are not fully elucidated. At least three steps are necessary following intranasal administration (1) crossing the epithelial barrier in the nasal cavity, (2) transport from nasal mucosa to site of brain entry, likely across the cribiform plate, (3) transport from the site of brain entry to other anatomical regions. Alternatively, they may be absorbed into the systemic circulation and gain secondary access to the CNS through the blood brain barrier. The speed at which proteins were reported to reach the eye and optic nerve, 30 min after intranasal administration (Khan et al., 2017) , suggests hematogenous spread is very unlikely, and that intraaxonal transport is even more unlikely. It was hypothesized that perhaps some pathway of local diffusion or lymphatic pathway may allow rapid protein diffusion over the relatively short distance from absorption through the cribiform plate to optic nerve (Khan et al., 2017) . For RSA59, prior intracranial studies demonstrate that the virus can use axonal transport machinery to spread intraneuronally (Das Sarma et al., 2009) , thus it is likely that a similar mechanism would be used after intranasal administration and entry into the olfactory nerve. The path from there to optic nerve is not direct, and thus may require much higher titers of virus to occur at a pathologic level, or may not be possible at all. These hypothesized mechanisms may explain why we were not able to see viral staining day 1 post infection whereas the drug ST266 and other small molecules can be found in optic nerve as early as 30 min post intranasal inoculation (Dhuria et al., 2010; Khan et al., 2017) .",

Interestingly, complex mixtures containing physiologic concentrations of multiple proteins show that protein can rapidly accumulate in the eye and optic nerve following intranasal delivery, suggesting a direct nose to eye diffusion pathway that remains to be fully elucidated (Khan et al., 2017) . The current results show that RSA59 does not follow a similar pattern of accumulation in the optic nerve, suggesting that viral particle may be too large or complex to follow the same pathway, or may actively enter neurons locally and restrict their movement to intraneuronal axonal transport. Nonetheless, the ability of neurotropic MHV viruses to infect different cells, translocate throughout the CNS, and induce inflammatory demyelination, continues to provide a reproducible model to study optic nerve and spinal cord demyelinating disease following intracranial inoculation. Thus, intracranial inoculation should continue to be considered a preferred method for studies of MHV-induced optic neuritis and CNS demyelinating disease.",

Representative 5 \u00b5m thick sections of retina (upper left column) optic nerve (upper center and right columns) and olfactory bulb (lower panel) 1 day p.i. are shown from mock-infected mice (A-C,J,L) and mice intranasally-infected with RSA59 (D-F,K,M) and RSMHV2 (G-I) (scale bar = 50 \u00b5m). Retina sections 6 days p.i. from intracranially-infected RSA59 (N) and RSMHV2 (O) mice are also shown. Sections immunostained using anti-viral nucleocapsid antisera show no detectable viral antigen in retina or optic nerve on day 1 p.i. (A,B,D,E,G,H), with some patchy brown stain in the olfactory bulb after intranasal viral inoculation with RSA59 (M). EGFP fluorescence detected for virus presence in olfactory bulb sections shows high background in mock-infection mice (J) which prevented this from being quantified, but demonstrates some positive cells and clusters of cells in an RSA59 infected mouse (K). Optic nerve sections stained with anti-Iba-1 antibody show the resting number and morphology of Iba-1 positive cells in mock-infected mice (C), and similar resting microglial morphology across sections from RSA59 (F) and RSMHV2 (I) infected mice. Six days p.i., anti-viral nucleocapsid positive cells are present in the RGC layer (top arrow) and inner nuclear layer (bottom arrow) of the retina from a mouse intracranially-inoculated with RSA59 (N), but not mice inoculated with RSMHV2 (O).",
