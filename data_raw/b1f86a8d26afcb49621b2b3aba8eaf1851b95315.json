An association between viral upper-respiratory infections (URIs) and exacerbations of asthma has been reported [3, 4] . The most commonly identified viruses in these studies include rhinovirus, coronavirus, influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [5] . RSV is the predominant cause of URIs in infants below 2 years of age and infection may result in bronchiolitis, which is a risk factor for asthma [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . RSV may constitute the earliest trigger for the development of a T-helper type 2 (Th2)dominant immune response, which is the hallmark of immunopathology in allergic subjects including asthmatics, and also in rodent models [13] . URIs cause a decrease in peak flow that lags behind upper airway symptoms by 1-2 days, with 46% of subjects in one study reporting a two day lag in peak flow reduction [14] .",

The combination is also significantly more effective than montelukast plus FP or monotherapy with inhaled budesonide [18] . The increased effectiveness of FPS has been attributed to increased activation and translocation to the nucleus of glucocorticoid receptors [19, 20] .

This hypothesis was tested in a mouse model of allergen sensitization and RSV infection using OVA as the allergen [1] . Mice with chronic or acute sensitization to OVA were RSV infected and then treated with FP or Sal or the two together (FPS). Airway hyperreactivity (AHR) and pulmonary inflammation were measured five days after infection. The results show that the combination of FP and Sal provides significant protection in terms of both airway hyperreactivity and pulmonary inflammation compared to either of them alone.",

FP increased the number of cells producing IL-10 and Sal increased cells producing IL-4, whereas FPS decreased the number of cells producing IL-10, IL-4 and IFN-\u03b3.

            "text": "One important finding of this study is that irrespective of the frequency of RSV infection, the FPS combination therapy was effective and significantly decreased AHR as measured by % Penh. Also, in studies in which mice were infected twice with RSV, FPS decreased AHR more than FP alone. These results are in agreement with previous reports, where steroid or \u03b22-agonists alone was found to be partially effective in RSV infection and viral induced asthma [24] [25] [26] . Consistent with the AHR data, there was a substantial reduction in pulmonary inflammation irrespective of the frequency of RSV infection. Of note is that in experiments where mice sensitized with OVA received one RSV infection, there was a decrease in eosinophils but an increase in lymphocytes. In contrast, OVA-sensitized mice that had two RSV infections before FP showed an increase in neutrophils. This is probably due to the resistance of neutrophils to corticosteroids and to the generation of a greater number of infiltrating neutrophils by the repeated RSV infection. The former possibility is consistent with the findings that neutrophilic asthma is resistant to treatment by FP [27] . This suggests that addition of the long-acting beta agonist is the agent primarily affecting recruitment of neutrophils in the combination. mice has been shown to increase a variety of cytokines and chemokines including TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, IL-6, IL-4, IL-10, RANTES, macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha, and eotaxin [28] . Mice with a single infection showed an increased percentage of IL-10-producing cells perhaps indicative of greater stimulation of the innate immune system [29] . Treatment with salmeterol alone resulted in a significantly higher percentage of IL-4-producing cells characteristic of the Th2-type response observed in human infants suffering from acute RSV bronchiolitis [30] while FPS decreased both IL-10 and IL-4. The numbers of cytokine-producing cells in splenocyte cultures are in agreement with the increased number of Th2-like cells seen in lung sections from salmeterol-treated mice. In mice infected twice with RSV, FPS reduced IL-10 but not IL-4 compared to FP or salmeterol alone-. This is consistent with our previous finding that allergic mice with two RSV infections had an increase in the number of cells producing IL-4 and IL-13 [1] . Increased IL-10 production has been associated with recurrent wheezing in children hospitalized for RSV bronchiolitis [31, 32] .",

FP treatment caused an increase in ICAM-1 expression whereas Sal showed a small decrease. Treatment with the combination resulted in a decrease of ICAM-1 expression. This observation is consistent with previous reports which showed that FPS combination decreased ICAM-1 expression in human lung fibroblast cells [33, 34] . The expression of MUC-5A, which is a marker for mucus production, was also decreased by combined FPS treatment, but not significantly by either FP or Sal alone. Staining for the Th2-specific marker, T1/ST2 demonstrated the RSV-induced infiltration of Th2 cells. While treatment with FP increased ICAM-1 and MUC-5 expression, Th2 infiltration in lungs of FP-treated mice was decreased. In contrast, treatment with Sal did not inhibit Th2 infiltration. The combination FPS treatment decreased Th2 infiltration compared with Sal indicating that steroids and \u03b2 2 -agonists differentially affect inflammatory parameters, but that the two in combination can effectively reduce RSV-induced lung inflammation.",

Our results indicated that compared to lungs of mice sensitized with OVA in the presence or absence of RSV infection, lungs of mice treated with either FP or Sal and the combination FPS showed a decreased number of apoptotic cells. The FPS combination shows even fewer apoptotic cells compared to FP or Sal alone suggesting the greater effectiveness of the combination treatment. The reason for this is unclear, but it may be due to the fact that treatment with FP or Sal decreases infiltration of inflammatory cells to the lungs. This idea is consistent with the report that FPS increases apoptosis of peripheral blood T cells [36] . ",

Our results suggest that the use of a combination therapy can be very effective in reducing virally-induced asthma exacerbations. FPS reduction in RSV titer correlates with increased IFN-\u03b3 production Figure 6 FPS reduction in RSV titer correlates with increased IFN-\u03b3 production. Two groups of mice were sensitized with OVA, and then prophylactically treated with FP, Sal or FPS prior to infection with RSV. Three days after infection, they were sacrificed. Homogenates of lungs from one group of mice were assayed for RSV titer, and BAL fluid from the second group was assayed for IFN-\u03b3. Results are from one representative experiment of two. ",
