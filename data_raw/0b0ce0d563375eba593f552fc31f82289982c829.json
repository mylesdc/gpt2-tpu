The pandemic also highlighted the importance of having surveillance on the US-Mexico border, as the first cases of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection were detected in southern California. 2, 3 The Arizona Department of Health Services (ADHS) has conducted statewide influenza surveillance since 1997. Surveillance indicators include monitoring ILI among ambulatory patients, tracking laboratory-confirmed cases, monitoring ILI in schools, and testing and subtyping influenza viruses in specimens submitted to the Arizona State Public Health Laboratory. Laboratory-confirmed cases of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections are also monitored. However, epidemiological data on influenza hospitalizations has been limited, and there is no established statewide surveillance for respiratory viral infections beyond influenza and RSV. In 2010, Arizona began conducting SARI surveillance as part of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Binational Border Infectious Disease Surveillance (BIDS) program with the aim of describing the patterns of disease in a highly fluid border region. Here, we report SARI surveillance data in Arizona from 2010 to 2014.",

Specimens were taken an average of 8 days after illness onset (range: 1-90 days). Patients whose specimens were collected within 7 days of the onset of symptoms were more likely to have a viral pathogen detected than those whose specimens were collected later (68% versus 32%, P = 0\u00c1038). There were no differences in the clinical presentation of patients who tested positive for viral pathogens and those who tested negative except that the latter were more likely to be admitted to an ICU (Table S2) . Of the 233 patients with information on influenza vaccination and laboratory testing, 132 (57%) were vaccinated. Of these 132 patients, 76 (58%) tested negative for a virus. Among the 49 influenza-positive specimens, 76% were influenza A and 24% influenza B. While influenza A was more commonly detected in the beginning of the season (December to March), influenza B was detected throughout the season and was the only influenza virus identified between April and July ( Figure 1 The monthly distribution of non-influenza respiratory viruses is shown in Figure 2 . Their monthly distribution was similar to that of influenza viruses. Overall, 89% (n = 86) of respiratory viruses were identified between October and May. February had the highest number of viruses detected, especially for coronavirus (10/18, 56%) and HMPV (11/24, 46%). Over the four seasons, HMPV was the second most frequently detected virus circulating and the highest annual proportion of all HMPVs (71%) was seen in the 2013-2014 season. All four parainfluenza virus types were detected, but type 3 (50%) dominated.",

As seen elsewhere, influenza viruses were a major contributor (16%) to viral respiratory infections associated with SARI. [8] [9] [10] Additionally, this surveillance identified and highlighted the importance of other, often neglected, viral respiratory pathogens including PIV, coronaviruses, and HMPV. Although children <5 years of age accounted for only a small proportion of our population (5\u00c15%), they were more likely to test positive for viral infections than other age groups, and most of their infections were due to RSV, which is the most common cause of acute respiratory infections in children globally. 11 Few SARI surveillance systems in other countries tested for viral pathogens other than influenza, and those that do often focused on children <5 years old. [12] [13] [14] The overall detection rate of viral pathogens among hospitalized SARI cases aged <5 years in our surveillance (82%) was lower than in China (94% in <72 months) 14 and higher than in Kenya (71%) or in Bangladesh (52%). 11, 12 The proportion of SARI cases that were positive for RSV in children <5 years in our surveillance (31%) was similar to surveillance data in Bangladesh (37%) and slightly higher than in Kenya (21%). Some differences in case definitions or surveillance design (population-based or hospital-based) may explain differences observed in the results. The proportion of SARI cases <5 years that were positive for an influenza virus (11%) was also similar to that found in Thailand (13%) and 15 countries across Africa (10%). 8, 15 Besides RSV and influenza viruses, our results also showed that parainfluenza, HMPV, coxsackievirus, and echovirus are important etiologies of SARI in young children, a finding consistent with other studies. [12] [13] [14] The finding that 57% of SARI cases had no pathogen detected suggests that other causes (e.g., bacteria) may play an important role in SARI; alternatively, poor or late specimen collection may have contributed to a lower yield in the viruses being detected.",

All influenza virus subtypes detected were known to be in circulation in Arizona, the United States and Sonora, Mexico (Personal Communication Sonora Health Ministry). 21 This surveillance system has several limitations. First, our selection of large, referral hospitals likely biased our sample to more severe cases presenting later in the course of illness. Further, two of the six hospitals in Southern Arizona that were not included may be more likely to see mobile populations as they are physically closer to border. Although the surveillance was intended to be comprehensive within the selected hospitals, it might not have captured all SARI cases that presented at the hospital. Some cases may have not been enrolled due to doctors' omission or patients' admission without passing through the emergency ward. Additionally, few children <5 years were enrolled as our sites are not major providers of pediatric care in Southern Arizona. This population might not be representative of the population of Southern Arizona, and its age distribution may underestimate the burden of SARI, especially among children. Also, because we collected information on mortality at the hospital, deaths that occurred in patients discharged to hospices or nursing homes for terminal care were not included. However, we are in the process of analyzing death certificate data to identify deaths associated with the hospitalization in order to get a better understanding of the predictors of mortality and the mortality burden associated with SARI in Southern Arizona. Self-reported characteristics such as vaccination, travel information, and symptoms may be subject to poor recall, but we reduced recall bias by verifying information through medical records review for the two major sites with accessible medical records. Finally, a few of the viral targets were only tested for two of the four years of the surveillance, so the proportion positive may be underestimated.",
