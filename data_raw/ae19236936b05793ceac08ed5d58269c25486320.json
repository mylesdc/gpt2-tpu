We have previously described [1] the general design of the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (IEDB), a broad program recently initiated by National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). The overall goal of the IEDB is to catalog and organize a large body of information regarding antibody and T cell epitopes from infectious pathogens and other sources [2] . Priority will be placed on NIAID Category A-C pathogens (http://www2.niaid.nih.gov/Biodefense/ bandc_priority.htm) and emerging/re-emerging infectious diseases. Epitopes of human and non-human primates, rodents, and other species for which detailed information is available will be included. It is envisioned that this new effort will catalyze the development of new methods to predict and model immune responses, will aid in the discovery and development of new vaccines and diagnostics, and will assist in basic immunological investigations.",

Intrinsic features of an epitope are those characteristics that can be unequivocally defined and are specified within the epitope sequence/structure itself. Examples of intrinsic features are the epitope's sequence, structural features, and binding interactions with other immune system molecules. To describe an immune response associated with a specific epitope, context information also needs to be taken into account. Contextual information includes, for example, the species of the host, the route and dose of immunization, the health status and genetic makeup of the host, and the presence of adjuvants. In this respect, the IEDB project transcends the strict boundaries of database development and reaches into a systems biology application, attempting for the first time to integrate structural information about epitopes with comprehensive details describing their complex interaction with the immune system of the host, be it an infected organism or a vaccine recipient [1] [2] [3] .",

Such a framework was key to sharing information and ideas among developers, scientists, and potential users, and to allowing the design of an effective logical structure of the database itself. Accordingly, we decided to develop a formal ontology. Over the years, the term \"ontology\" has been defined and utilized in many ways by the knowledge engineering community [4] . We will adopt the definition of \"ontology\" as \"the explicit formal specifications of the terms in a domain and the relationships among them\" [5] . According to Noy and McGuinness [6] , \"ontology defines a common vocabulary for researchers who need to share information in a domain and helps separate domain knowledge from operational knowledge\". Thus, availability of a formal ontology is relevant in designing a database, in cataloging the information, in communicating the database structure to researchers, developers and users, and in integrating multiple database schema designs and applications.",

            "text": "The ontology developed for IEDB and described herein complements two explicit ontologies that are presently available: the IMGT-Ontology and the Gene Ontology (GO). The IMGT-Ontology [15] was created for the international ImMunoGeneTics Database (IMGT), which is an integrated database specializing in antigen receptors (immunoglobulin and T Cell receptors) and MHC molecules of all vertebrate species. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first ontology in the domain of immunogenetics and immunoinformatics. The GO project [16] provides structured, controlled vocabularies that cover several domains of molecular and cellular biology. GO provides an excellent framework for genes, gene products, and their sequences, but it does not address the specific epitope substructure of the gene products. The IMGT provides an excellent ontological framework for the immune receptors but lacks information relating to the epitopes themselves. Therefore it was necessary to expand the available ontologies and to create an ontology specifically designed to represent the information of immune receptor interaction with immune epitopes. Wherever possible, the IEDB ontology conforms to standard vocabularies for capturing values for certain fields. For capturing disease names, IEDB uses the International Classification for Diseases (ICD-10) [17]. The NCBI Taxonomy database nomenclature [18, 19] is used to capture species and strain names, and HLA Allele names are consistent with the HLA nomenclature reports [20] .",

More information relating to various aspects of the project can be accessed at http://www.immuneepitope.org/. Herein, we report a detailed description of the novel aspects of the IEDB ontology. In designing our application architecture, we have followed the common system engineering practice of first determining the scope and nature of the data involved. A first essential step is to understand the semantics of the domain and to capture that knowledge in an agreed-upon format. Arranging the domain concepts in a taxonomy is one of the initial organizing steps in the ontology design process. The class hierarchy represents the generalization and specialization relationships between the various classes of objects in a domain [6] . Briefly, classes describe concepts in the domain. Subclasses represent concepts (classes) that are more specific than the superclass and these subclasses can have their own unique properties. Slots represent properties of the classes. For example, in Figure 1 , we see that there is a class named Reference and three more specific subclasses of Reference: Journal Article, Patent Application, and Direct Submission. Figure 1 also shows that the class Epitope has a number of properties (slots) associated with it such as \"has Epitope Structure\" and \"has Epitope Source\".",

An ontology, which is an explicit formal specification of the terms in the domain and relationships among them, is an effective way to share the knowledge contained in that domain. Accordingly, since the IEDB's domain is epitope-related data, we have created an ontology that captures detailed conceptual structure related to these data.",

Our ontology design defines individual concepts as separate classes and then defined relationships between these classes and other objects in the domain. These classes serve to restrict the values that will describe properties of objects in the database. For example, the species is a separate concept defined in its own class. Depending on the context, this can refer to an immunized species or the species from which antigen presenting cells are derived. Similarly MHC Molecules is defined as a separate class, and it is used as a value restriction by concepts like MHC Binding and Antigen Presenting Cells. Defining concepts as separate classes and using them to restrict the values of properties in other classes facilitates the expansion and modification of our ontology. Adding properties (slots) to concepts is a task easily accomplished when there are well-defined class descriptions that may serve as value restrictions on the properties, and providing that High-level classification of Immunization (A), Antigen (B), and Antigen Presenting Cells (C) class these class descriptions are general enough to apply in all instances. We have ensured in our design that each concept is atomic and that it can be re-used by various classes.",

In our initial analysis, we confirmed that there were no explicit ontologies that efficiently captured epitope details as per the scope of the IEDB program. As mentioned above, we have utilized, as much as possible, inferred ontologies from existing epitope databases. Among the ontologies that we analyzed, IMGT-Ontology and Gene Ontology were the only two formal ontologies that were related to the epitope domain. The IMGT-Ontology was designed for the ImMunoGeneTics database. IMGT is an integrated database specializing in antigen receptors (immunoglobulins and T-cell receptors) and the major histocompatibility complex of all vertebrate species. The ontology developed for this database has specific immunological content, describing the classification and specification of terms needed for immunogenetics. The IEDB does conform to IMGT's standards about receptors and MHC molecule chains in the sense that all the chain names follow IMGT's controlled vocabulary.",

We anticipate that the development of this type of ontology and associated databases might lead to completely new methods for describing and modeling immune responses.
