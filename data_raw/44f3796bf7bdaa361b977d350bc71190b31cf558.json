So far selection and design rationale for such peptides is usually driven by T-cell epitope prediction, available experimental and modelled 3D structure, B-cell epitope predictions such as hydrophilicity plots or experience. If no structure is available the rational selection of peptides for the production of functionally altering or neutralizing antibodies is practically impossible. Specifically if many alternative antigens are available the reduction of required synthesized peptides until one successful candidate is found is of central technical interest. We have investigated the integration of B-cell epitope prediction with the variability of antigen and the conservation of patterns for post-translational modification (PTM) prediction to improve over state of the art in the field. In particular the application of machine-learning methods shows promising results.",

Furthermore the concept to maximize antigenicity, minimize variability and minimize the likelihood of post-translational modification for the identification of relevant sites leads to biologically interesting observations. Primarily, for about 50% of antigen the approach works well with individual area under the ROC curve (AROC) values of at least 0.65. On the other hand a significant portion reveals equivalently low AROC values of < = 0.35 indicating an overall non-Gaussian distribution. While about a third of 57 antigens are seemingly intangible by our approach our results suggest the existence of at least two distinct classes of bioinformatically detectable epitopes which should be predicted separately. As a side effect of our study we present a hand curated dataset for the validation of protectivity classification. Based on this dataset machine-learning methods further improve predictive power to a class separation in an equilibrated dataset of up to 83%.",

Probably more important, we find that for about 50% of antigen the approach works substantially better than for the overall dataset of 57 proteins. Essentially as a side effect our method optimizes for presumably best applicable peptides as they tend to be likely unmodified and as invariable as possible which is answering needs in diagnosis and treatment of pathogen infection.

Although historically disfavored the application of peptides in vaccine design is currently experiencing a renaissance [1] . While the focus is often on Tcell responses especially the generation of B-cell responses is of relevance against certain pathogens such as HIV to prevent initial infection [2] . It is thus not surprising that since the early days of computational biology scientists have attempted to predict the relevance of protein domains and peptides in several areas of application. Initial hallmarks of the field are represented, among many others, by work of Hopp and Woods [3, 4] . During the following and more recent years various methods and problems concerning the prediction of continuous B-cell epitopes have been proposed [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . Recently the usability of amino acid scales for the prediction of B-cell epitopes has been profoundly questioned [13] and common standards regarding the validation of epitope predictions have been discussed [14] .",

In addition, continuous epitopes make up an undefined but presumably small part of the complete \"epitope space\" of an antigen.

One of the questions we ask is whether these principles or constraints lead to signals which can be used for predicting or rather detecting candidate epitopes. We assume that an antibody (and hence it's epitope) is protective because the function of the antigen (target protein) is inhibited and the activity of the organism is thus reduced. Or alternatively because immunological processes are activated leading to the destruction of the organism. The prior (protectivity class I) might most likely be expected in adhesion molecules or pathogenicity factors like matrix degrading proteases and toxins.",

It can be considered likely that the two mechanisms would often lead to differently characterized epitopes. Consequently as different functional constraints can be expected separate strategies for detecting them may be required. Basically any protein of high expression and density on the surface with at least one good epitope can be the target of class II protectivity. We define a \"good\" epitope as a surface area of high interaction potential, shape complementarity to the basic layout of an antibody [15] and dissimilar to self. Predicting that class therefore also requires to assess (or estimate) the density of a protein on the cell during pathogenesis, optimally experimentally or by inference from related organisms. A practically applicable continuous epitope could then be any exposed, possibly evolutionarily highly variable loop with an amenable antigenicity and solvent-accessibility profile. Class II protectivity may often be comparably straightforward to predict as soon as a target protein has been identified because selection of high scoring B-cell epitope scores often seems to be relatively straightforward and selection routines primarily falter in the domain of suboptimal scores as has been indicated by Sollner and Mayer [9] . However, immunologically subdominant or even cryptic B-cell epitopes can be of special interest regarding protectivity and inter-strain cross-reactivity [16] and are sometimes consistently immuno-silent during natural infection [17, 18] . As a consequence we focus on conserved and therefore presumably functionally constrained epitopes without post-translational modifications which still exhibit amenable antigenicity scores. Regarding the previous definition these epitopes may often fall into class I of protective continuous epitopes.",

We chose this size to use an intermediate between common assumptions about sizes of continuous epitopes (usually between 7 and 15 amino-acids).

In other words, for the prior two the 10-mer values are calculated as the averages over the averages calculated from individual alignment columns.

The table shows that each parameter contributes significantly and the best model comprises all three attributes as well as the sum-score as a fourth attribute.

Interestingly PTM alone yields no improvement over random classification while the combination with the remaining features significantly boots its impact.

Hence, the resulting property matrix is of rank 19 as well, corresponding to 19 linearly independent vectors. From this only 19 coefficients plus the intercept can be estimated in regression models. Therefore Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was employed to transform the propensity scales from the 505-dimensional space to a 19-dimenstional subspace spanned by all 19 principal components with non-zero Eigenvalues, comparable to how parameter reduction has been done before [34, 35] . The 20 \u00d7 505 descriptor matrix was centered and scaled to unity variance before the application of PCA. The full information contained in the original 20 \u00d7 505 descriptor matrix is retained, because no component is omitted. From this PCA-transformation, a new 20 \u00d7 19 descriptor matrix was built. These 19 PCA-derived propensity scales were used in turn to calculate sequence characteristics for the data set. The values were averaged over a sliding window of nine amino acids. Logistic regression employing the logit function was used to build models for the classification of single amino acid residues as epitopic or non epitopic.",

This constraint is essentially the difference between the standard Shannon entropy and the entropy after reducing the amino acid alphabet according to the same substitution matrix as above. Briefly, amino acid identities were grouped as follows: E < = E, D, Q, K, R ; I < = I, L, M, V; Y < = Y, W, F, H; S < = S, T, A. Other amino-acids remained ungrouped. The ECI is primarily discussed when parameter correlations are analyzed.",

All sequences in the previously created multiple alignments were searched for the occurrence of these patterns. For each hit the amino acid putatively carrying the modification was marked and for each column in the alignment the ratio m of modified amino-acids was calculated. As for sequence variability the value used for protectivity scoring is 1-m. The advantage of using motif predictions on aligned sequences is the possibility to derive the degree of conservation of the motif. Combined with the assumption that conserved motifs of post-translational modification are more reliable and do otherwise carry a high false positive rate this increases the weight of the prediction.",
