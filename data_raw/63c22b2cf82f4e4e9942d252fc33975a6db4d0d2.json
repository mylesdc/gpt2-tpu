However, the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation remain poorly characterized. To dissect the function of HBc, a yeast two-hybrid was performed to identify HBc-binding proteins, and the C-terminal of BRG1/hBRM-associated factors 200 (BAF200C) was identified. Then, the existence of HBc interactions with BAF200C and full-length BAF200 was confirmed via co-immunoprecipitation assays in 293T, HepG2 and HepG2-NTCP cells. Furthermore, we show that the binding between HBc and BAF200 was of vital importance to HBc mediated downregulation of interferon-induced transmembrane protein 1 (IFITM1) expression, and the mechanisms for the downregulation were disclosed as follows. Basal level of IFITM1 expression depends on BAF200, rather than the JAK-STAT1 pathway. The interaction of HBc with BAF200 disturbs the stability of the polybromo-associated BAF (PBAF) complex and results in the suppression of IFTM1 transcription. Finally, the antiviral effects of IFITM1 on cell proliferation and HBV replication were found to be partially restored when HBc was co-transfected with BAF200. Collectively, our findings indicate that HBc plays a role in HBV resistance against the antiviral activities of IFN\u03b1, providing details about HBV evasion of host innate immunity.",

HBV infection could cause acute and chronic Hepatitis B (CHB), which can progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, leading to high mortality rates worldwide. Antiviral therapy with interferon aims to induce permanent immune control of HBV infection through stimulation of the hosts' innate immune response. Nevertheless, experimental data from HBV infected chimpanzees and urokinase-type plasminogen activator/severe combined immunodeficiency (uPA-SCID) mice have shown that HBV infection does not induce an intrahepatic innate immune response that can be detected [2, 3] . This is because early in infection it acts like a stealth virus, remaining undetected and spreading until the onset of the adaptive immune response several weeks later [4] . Besides acting as a stealth pathogen, recent developments have shown that HBV can avoid recognition by the host innate immune system. However, the precise mechanisms are largely unknown.",

SWI/SNF complexes are critical for proliferation, differentiation, tumorigenesis, and DNA repair [12] . There are two forms of SWI/SNF complexes: BRG1/hBRM-associated factors (BAF) and polybromo-associated BAF (PBAF). Only PBAF can facilitate the ligand-dependent transcriptional activation by interacting with the nuclear receptors [13] . BAF and PBAF complexes share most of their subunits and are distinguished by the presence of two specific subunits-BAF180 and BAF200-both of which only exist in PBAF [14] . Furthermore, BAF200, but not BAF180, is essential for the stability of PBAF, and the depletion of BAF200 leads to the complete inactivation of PBAF [13] . BAF200 is encoded by ARID2. Besides the N-terminal AT-rich interactive domain (ARID), BAF200 contains multiple LXXLL motifs, which have been shown to participate in the regulation of protein-protein interaction [15] . Additionally, BAF200 has been reported to be a potential tumor suppressor and involved in the IFN signal pathway [16] .",

            "text": "IFNs are essential components of the innate immune response and act as the first line of defense against invading microorganisms or pathogens. Interestingly, HBV escapes the host innate immune response merely by preventing the induction of IFNs [17] . IFNs modulate host defenses against microbial infection through the induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) by the Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathway. Among these ISGs, interferon-induced transmembrane protein (IFITM) 1, 2, and 3, which are a cluster of genes encoding membrane proteins, exhibit antiviral capabilities mainly through the inhibition of virus entry [18] . IFITM1 restricts the infection of various viruses, including type 1 human immunodeficiency virus [19] , hepatitis C virus [20] , severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus [21] , and influenza A virus [21, 22] . However, whether IFITMs inhibit HBV infection has not been reported. In this study, we start with the discovery that HBc can interact with BAF200. Then, we focus on functions of the interaction and disclose that overexpressed HBc downregulates the BAF200-dependent expression of IFITM1 via disruption of PBAF complex stability. Finally, our data demonstrates that the antiviral effects of IFITM1 on cellular proliferation and HBV replication are partially restored when HBc is co-expressed with BAF200 in HBV-infected cells. These findings enrich details about how HBV counteracts human natural immunity, revealing a potential target for novel therapeutic strategies of HBV infection.",

            "text": "It has been shown that BAF200 is essential for the stability of PBAF, and the depletion of BAF200 leads to the complete inactivation of PBAF [13] . Hence, we predicted that the interaction of HBc with BAF200 would interrupt the stability of PBAF complexes, leading to potential BAF200-dependent IFITM1 expression. To verify this hypothesis, co-IP assays were carried out to analyze the effect of HB on BAF180-BAF200 immuno-complexes in HepG2 cells (Figure 3b) . IP was performed against Flag-BAF200 and the co-precipitation of BAF180 was probed. It demonstrated that HBc co-transfection along with BAF200 profoundly reduced the co-precipitation of BAF180-BAF200 immuno-complexes when compared with the BAF200 transfected alone condition. Endogenous BAF180-BAF200 interaction was further assessed in HBV infected HepG2-NTCP cells (Figure 3e) . The co-IP assay showed that the concentration of BAF180-BAF200 complexes was reduced more than 50-fold compared to the non-infected mock control. These results imply that HBc de-stabilizes the PBAF complex by preventing the BAF180-BAF200 interaction, probably by competitive binding to BAF200. We next determined whether overexpression of HBc regulated IFITM1 transcription in vitro. Flag-BAF200 was transfected with or without HA-HBc into HepG2 cells. Cells were later treated with IFN\u03b1 (500 U/mL) and total mRNA was extracted to detect transcription levels of IFITM1, 2, and 3 by RT-qPCR. The data indicates that, upon IFN\u03b1 stimulation, the suppression of IFITM1 expression by HBc is specific (Figure 3c ) and statistically significant (Figure 3d ) in vitro. Collectively, the data demonstrates that HBc interacts with BAF200, and the HBc-BAF200 interaction prevents the BAF180-BAF200 interactions that might abolish PBAF complex stability, which in turn regulates the suppression of IFITM1 transcription. The pCMV-Flag vector and pCMV-Flag-BAF200 were transfected into HepG2 cells, with or without IFN\u03b1 (500 U/mL) treatment for 24 h. Phosphorylation of STAT1 was detected via western blot using antibodies against phosphorylated STAT1 (pSTAT1).

Co-IP assays were performed with anti-Flag antibody, then BAF200-BAF180 immuno-complexes were detected by western blot assays using anti-BAF180 antibody or anti-Flag antibodies (control). Input control assays were performed in WCL using anti-HA or anti-BAF180 antibodies. Meanwhile, total mRNA was extracted to examine the effect of BAF200 and HBc combination on IFITM1, 2, 3 transcriptions by RT-PCR (c). \u03b2-actin was detected as control.

In HepG2.2.15 cells, which contain a stably integrated HBV genome and produce endogenous HBc, overexpression of BAF200 promoted the inhibition of IFN\u03b1 (Figure 4d ), however when HBc was silenced by siHBc, cell viability was reduced substantially (Figure 4e) .

In contrast to the control, when BAF200 was overexpressed, the concentration of HBsAg and HBeAg in the supernatant was reduced about one-fold, and HBV DNA copies were also suppressed up to five-fold.

The use of cccDNA as a transcriptional template in the nucleus likely contributes to HBV's capacity to limit detection in hepatocytes [37] . In addition, HBV evades the host response through a complex combination of processes that include signaling interference, effector modulation, and continual viral genetic variation [37] . Reports have shown that HBV polymerase and HBx protein directly inhibit the cellular machinery that detects replication intermediates [29, 33] . Here, our study provides novel evidence that HBV counteracts IFN\u03b1 antiviral activities through effector modulation, i.e., the downregulation of IFITM1 expression by HBc. The mechanism of the downregulation is illustrated as follows. Under normal conditions, IFN\u03b1 induction activates PBAF complexes, which consist of BAF200, BAF180, and other subunits. The activation of the PBAF complex triggers histone sliding on chromatin DNA, leading to the exposure of interferon-stimulated response elements (ISRE). In this way, PBAF complexes facilitate the initiation of IFITM1 transcription (Figure 5a) . Actually, BAF200 is essential for the stability of the PBAF complex. Under HBV-infected condition, the interaction of HBc with BAF200 competes against the binding between BAF180 and BAF200, resulting in the loss in PBAF complex stability. Thus, the efficient process of the PBAF complex is interrupted, leading to the suppression of IFITM1 transcription (Figure 5b ). It provides details for the mechanism of HBV escape from IFN\u03b1-induced immune elimination. Moreover, our future work will continue to explore the intrahepatic effect of HBc on HBV replication using HBV-transgenic mice.",

Here, our study shows that HBc inhibits the IFN\u03b1induced IFITM1 transcription through disturbing the stability of PBAF complex in vitro, independent of the JAK-STAT1 pathway (Figure 4a) . Moreover, HBc exhibits anti-apoptosis activity by inhibiting TRAIL-induced expression of the pathway-related death receptor in hepatocytes [34] . HBc acts as a tumor suppressor as well, by blocking the transcription of the human tumorigenesis-associated genes, IFN\u03b2 and p53 [11, 35] . Taken together, our data demonstrate that HBc downregulates IFITM1 expression through interactions with BAF200, rather than the JAK-STAT1 pathway. The results also show that HBc partially restores IFITM1 antiviral effects on cell proliferation and HBV replication in infected cells in vitro by disturbing the stability of PBAF. It enriches the mechanism that HBV counteracts the innate immunity of IFN\u03b1, revealing a potential target for novel therapeutic strategies of HBV infection. ",
