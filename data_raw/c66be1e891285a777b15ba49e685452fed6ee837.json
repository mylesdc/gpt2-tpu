A characteristic feature of IBV is the occurrence of many different strains belonging to different serotypes, which makes a complete control of the disease by vaccinations a challenging task. Reasons for differences in the tissue tropism and pathogenicity between IBV strains, e.g. a predilection for the kidneys or the oviduct are still an open question. Strains of the QX genotype have been major pathogens in poultry flocks in Asia, Europe and other parts of the world. They are the cause of severe problems with kidney disease and reproductive tract disorders. We analysed infectivity and binding properties of the QX strain and compared them with those of the nephropathogenic strain B1648. As most IBV strains do not infect permanent cell lines and show infection only in primary chicken cells of the target organs, we developed a culture system for chicken oviduct explants. The epithelial cells of the oviduct showed a high susceptibility to infection by the QX strain and were almost resistant to infection by the nephropathogenic B1648 strain. Binding tests with isolated primary oviduct epithelial cells and soluble S1 proteins revealed that S1 proteins of two IBV strains bound with the same efficiency to oviduct epithelial cells. This attachment was sialic acid dependent, indicating that the sugar binding property of IBV spike proteins is not the limiting factor for differences in infection efficiency for the oviduct of the corresponding viruses.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses are pathogens of birds and mammals including humans. The avian coronavirus (AvCoV) infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) as a representative of the Gamma-coronavirus genus infects mainly chickens and other galliforme birds. Within the species AvCoV, there are many strains belonging to different serotypes, genotypes and/or different pathotypes. Some of these strains cause only respiratory disease whereas other strains can spread to other organs like the kidneys and the reproductive tract (reviewed in [1] ). The clinical manifestations of IBV in the kidney and the oviduct are of high economic importance in the poultry business. When the kidneys of young broilers are affected, mortality rates may be as high as 60% [2] . An infection of the reproductive tract may have severe implications comprising a drop in egg production, bad egg quality and the occurrence of so-called false layers. Viruses of the QX genotype have been related to problems in layer flocks causing cystic oviducts and inducing false layers [3, 4] . The chicken oviduct is a large organ, where secretion of egg white and the egg shell development takes place. It is divided into four different functional parts, including the infundibulum, the magnum, the isthmus and the uterus. In all four parts, a sheet of epithelial cells forms the outer cell layer facing the lumen of the oviduct. Whether epithelial cells of the different segments of the oviduct differ in their susceptibility to infection by IBV or whether IBV strains differ in the ability to infect oviduct epithelial cells is not known. Recent publications discuss a high nephropathogenic potential of the QX strain [5] , indicating that this strain has a broad tissue tropism in the bird, which may-at least in part-explain the high pathogenicity. The B1648 strain has a predilection for the kidneys and has been shown to reproducibly induce kidney disease [6] . An involvement of the reproductive organs in a B1648 infection has not been described.",

As the binding to susceptible host cells is the first important step in a virus life cycle, this would partly explain why some strains are able to spread to kidneys and/or to the oviduct of chickens. For several coronaviruses, the receptors have been identified. For IBV no cellular protein is known to function as a cellular receptor, but alpha 2,3-linked sialic acids serve as receptor determinants for this virus [9] . The importance of sialic acids for the infection of chicken host cells was shown for both, the QX strain and the B1648 strain [10, 11] . We analysed in this study whether the differences in the ability of the two viruses to infect oviduct epithelial cells were related to differences in binding properties of their spike proteins.",

Binding of S1-Fc was detected on all four parts of the oviduct, but staining was most intense in the isthmus whereas in the uterus fluorescent signals were restricted to single cells. This variation was observed irrespective of the source of the S1-protein, i.e. S1-Fc from strain QX showed a similar binding profile compared to the S1 from B1648. Binding of both proteins was dependent on the presence of sialic acid on the surface of the oviduct epithelium because detection of fluorescent signals was largely abolished after neuraminidase treatment ( Figure 5 ). To analyse whether the observed binding of the soluble S1 proteins is comparable to that of trimerized spike proteins of virus particles, we performed a binding test with virions on oviduct epithelial cells. Both, QX and B1648 viruses could bind to epithelial cells, indicating that the soluble spike constructs have similar binding properties as the viruses (Figure 6 ).",

Our system has the advantage that it displays the immature organ, which differs in the epithelial composition from the mature organ [18] . In contrast to other studies we did not use hormones to achieve an artificial maturation of the oviduct.

            "text": "Binding to the host cell is the first important step in a virus life cycle. It is well accepted, that the affinity to certain receptors is a crucial point in determining the organ and/or species tropism. The IBV strains of different serotypes show a pronounced variation in the amino acid sequence (about 20-25%) of their S1 proteins (reviewed in [1] ). As the spike protein is the major antigen it is not surprising, that viral evolution in large poultry flocks drives the emergence of new variants with modified spike genes. The spike protein is the attachment protein and the binding domain is located within in S1 subunit. Due to the high variance in the S1 sequences of different IBV strains-we asked the question if theses sequence variations are related with different binding properties of the spike protein and therefore may give some explanations for the different organ tropism of the strains. In former studies we already observed, that the binding to alpha 2,3-linked sialic acids expressed on host cells is important for initiating an infection. In the present study, we analysed the sensitivity of primary chicken oviduct epithelial cells to infection of the strains B1648 and QX. The observed differences correspond to results in former studies. The QX strain shows also in other primary cell cultures systems a high infectivity rate. In the bronchial epithelium it infected the cells with a higher efficiency than the IBV strains Beaudette, 4/91 and Italy02 [12] . In the oviduct explant cultures infection with Figure 2 Sialic acid dependent infection of oviduct explants with the QX strain. Explants were treated with neuraminidase to remove the sialic acids. After infection with the QX strain 12 hpi antigen could only be detected in mock treated explants. The nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue). T the infection was detected with a monoclonal antibody against the N-protein and a FITC-labeled secondary antibody (green). the nephropathogenic B1648 strain was only inconstantly observed in the infundibulum part. The results obtained with in vitro explant cultures reflect the situation in vivo to some extent. While QX has been reported to affect the chicken oviduct during infection, with the B1648 strain no reproductive disorders are described. When we compared the binding of the two S1 proteins from both strains on the oviduct cells by using soluble S1 subunits, we found both spike proteins binding to the oviduct epithelial cells of all parts of the oviduct, indicating that the attachment might not be the limiting factor for B1648 to infect oviduct epithelial cells. This binding of the spike proteins was with both strains and in all segments of the oviduct dependent on sialylated glycans expressed on the cells. A treatment with a neuraminidase to cleave off sialic acids resulted in clearly reduced binding of the soluble spike proteins. Lectin staining with MAAII of ",

As virus particles of the QX and the B1648 strain are also able to bind to oviduct epithelial cells, the observed binding of the soluble spike proteins resembles the binding of virions.

It has been demonstrated for several alpha and beta coronaviruses as well as for the IBV Beaudette strain that an additional binding property to heparan sulphate may help to broaden the tropism to new hosts [20] [21] [22] . So it could be that we observe only the first (initial) binding to the sialic acids with the soluble spike constructs, and could not detect or distinguish any later binding step necessary for infection. This binding may also be conformation dependent and may therefore depend on correctly folded spike proteins or the presence of the S2 subunit. Promkuntod et al. [19] have shown, that the presence of the S2 subunit in soluble spike protein constructs could improve the binding. Another explanation could be that a post binding step in the virus life cycle e.g. the fusion process in the oviduct epithelial cells is not mediated by all spike proteins to the same efficiency. The presence of certain proteases to activate the fusionability of the spike proteins may play a role. As IBV strains differ in their sequences within the cleavage sites of their spike proteins this could have an impact on the proteolytic activation by host proteases.",

It cannot be ruled out that a different -strain specific-efficiency to reach the oviduct may influence the organ tropism.
