In particular, ncRNAprotein interactions play an important role in posttranscriptional gene regulation like mRNA localization, mRNA stabilization, poly-adenylation, splicing and translation. The experimental methods to solve RNA-protein interaction prediction problem remain expensive and time-consuming. Here, we present the RPI-Pred (RNA-protein interaction predictor), a new support-vector machine-based method, to predict protein-RNA interaction pairs, based on both the sequences and structures. The results show that RPI-Pred can correctly predict RNA-protein interaction pairs with \u223c94% prediction accuracy when using sequence and experimentally determined protein and RNA structures, and with \u223c83% when using sequences and predicted protein and RNA structures. Further, our proposed method RPI-Pred was superior to other existing ones by predicting more experimentally validated ncRNA-protein interaction pairs from different organisms. Motivated by the improved performance of RPI-Pred, we further applied our method for reliable construction of ncRNA-protein interaction networks. The RPI-Pred is publicly available at: http://ctsb.is.wfubmc.edu/projects/rpi-pred.",

            "text": "RNA-protein interactions (RPI) play a crucial role in fundamental cellular processes, such as human diseases (1), viral replication and transcription (2, 3) and pathogen resistance in plants (4) (5) (6) . Recent high-throughput techniques produce remarkable evidences to prove that protein can interact with RNA to mediate different kinds of cellular functions. During the post-transcriptional regulation pro-cess, RPI complex interacts with targeted mRNAs and/or non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) to regulate cellular functions, such as RNA splicing, RNA transport, RNA stability and RNA translation (7) (8) (9) . Experimental studies on RPI reveal that many functional ncRNAs play pivotal roles in gene expression and regulation (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) . Although a few individual ncRNAs have been well studied, e.g. HOTAIR (17) , MALAT-1 (18) and Xist (19) , the majority are still not well understood. Over 30 000 ncRNAs have been identified and this number is expected to increase every year (14, 15, 20) . Currently, NPInter (21) is the only database, which provides the functional information for all the experimentally validated ncRNA-protein interactions (ncRPI). The experimental techniques are generally time-consuming and expensive. Our understanding of function of individual ncRNAs is far outpaced by the sheer volume and diversity of the available data. Furthermore, our understanding of ncRPI in gene regulatory networks is very limited, especially when compared to the regulatory roles of proteinprotein and DNA-protein complexes. This is because the advances in genomics and proteomics techniques have resulted in tremendous amounts of data on protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions (22) (23) (24) ; however, much less information is available on ncRPI.",

            "text": "In despite of the increasing amount (\u223c400) of successfully identified RNA binding proteins (RBP) in the human genome (25, 26) , we still lack a complete understanding of RPI complexes and their roles in post-transcriptional regulatory networks (7, 27) . Although the sequence-homologybased approaches, such as Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (28) (29) (30) and PFAM (31) (32) (33) , helped in detecting the functional regions (binding domains) of proteins and therefore the possible functions, these approaches lack the ability to identify the interacting partners (RNAs) for a given protein, or determine whether a given pair of protein and RNA can form interaction or not. To our knowledge, currently very few computational approaches are available to predict RPIs. One of the first computational methods for predicting ncRPI was reported in 2011 by Pancaldi and B\u00e4hler (34) . They trained random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers using more than 100 features extracted from protein secondary structure and localization, protein and gene physical properties and untranslated regions (UTRs). Thereafter, catRAPID (35) was developed by exploiting the physicochemical properties including secondary structure, hydrogen bonding and van der Waals propensities. Next, Muppirala et al. (36) introduced a method called RPISeq, which was constructed by using the features derived from protein and RNA sequences. They also trained RF and SVM classifiers using 3-mer and 4mer conjoint triad features for amino acid and nucleotide sequences, respectively (37) . Wang et al. (38) proposed an approach based on Na\u00efve Bayes (NB) and Extended NB (ENB) classifiers using the same data sets and similar triad features reported in Muppirala et al.'s work. More recently, Lu et al. (39) proposed a method called 'lncPro' for predicting ncRNA-protein associations, using Fisher linear discriminant approach. His training features were three types of classical protein secondary structures, hydrogen-bond and Van der Waals propensities, as well as six types of RNA secondary structures (RSS).",

In addition to sequence features, we combine the high-order structures of both proteins and RNAs, for a comprehensive understanding of RPI interactions. We consider the protein structures in terms of 16 structural fragments called protein blocks (PBs) (41) . The PBs provide a more accurate representation of known protein structures than classical three state protein secondary structures (\u2423-helix, \u2424-sheet and coil), and have been applied in many protein structure-based analysis (42, 43) . For the RNA highorder structure, we considered five classes of RSS, namely, stem, hairpin, loop, bulges and internal loop. These PB and RSS were combined with their corresponding amino acid and nucleotide sequences. Using these features, we developed a SVM-based machine learning approach, RPI-Pred, to predict protein-RNA interactions. Our training database was constructed using sequence and experimentally validated structures of proteins and RNAs from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (44) . We also used sequence and predicted structures to test our RPI-Pred on different data sets, such as RPI369 and RPI2241, and ncRPI data sets, such as RPI367, RPI13243 and NPInter10412 (21) . We extended our analysis to construct an in silico network to study potential interactions between proteins and ncRNAs, which can help us in further understanding of ncRNA's functions. Finally, a web server for this proposed method was also developed and freely accessed at http://ctsb.is.wfubmc.edu/ projects/rpi-pred. Step-wise work flow for the proposed RPI-Pred method. Figure 1 shows the work flow for the development of RPI-Pred method. The proposed method includes three steps: (1) extraction of sequence and structure features for protein and RNA to develop the RPI-Pred prediction method, (2) prediction of ncRPI and (3) construction of the in silicobased biological network on the predicted results in step 2.",

A total of 1560 RPI complexes available in NDB (as of 1 February 2014) were used in this study. We extracted the atomic and chain interfaces for 1336 complexes from PRIDB, resulting in 13 163 protein and 2715 RNA chains.

For instance, the RPI complex with the PDB id '1a9n' has four protein chains (A, B, C, D) and two RNA chains (Q, R), respectively. We obtained the possible interaction pairs from PRIDB as A-Q, B-Q, C-R and D-R. Then the homologous RNA-protein pairs (i.e. similar protein chains interacting with similar RNA chains) were removed by searching the sequence similarity between protein (RNA) sequences. In this study, we used EMBOSS needle program (46) with the standard sequence identity cut-off \u226530% to remove proteins (and RNA chains) with a high sequence similarity. In the current example with '1a9n', the protein chains A&C, B&D and RNA chains Q&R are 100% sequence-similar, therefore, we removed the redundant protein pairs. Finally, A-Q and B-Q were identified as non-redundant RNA-protein pairs.",

This distance threshold helped to strengthen positive pairs in the training data set by including only strongly interacting RPI pairs. Different thresholds have been used to distinguish the binding RNA-protein pairs from nonbinding ones (35, 36, 38, 39, 47) . We used the threshold 3.40 A (47). The threshold 3.4\u00c5 is reasonable and sufficient to cover 'strong' and 'moderate' hydrogen bonds and energyrich van der Waals contacts (48) . Therefore, we set the threshold (3.4\u00c5) to distinguish the strongly interacting protein-RNA pairs (positive pairs) and weakly interacting protein-RNA pairs (negative pairs). In the above given example, the pair B-Q, which had at least two atoms, one from protein and another from RNA, with distance \u22643.40\u00c5, was considered as a positive pair. The pair A-Q, which had no atom-atom distance within the threshold, was considered as a negative pair. This procedure was applied to all 1336 RNA-protein complexes to identify the positive and negative pairs. Further, the peptides (protein with sequence length <25 amino acids) and small RNA (with sequence lengths <15 nucleotides) were excluded from these positive and negative data sets.",

Slightly lower prediction accuracy was observed for the RPI2241 data set, which contained more ribosomal RNAs paired with proteins. Ribosomal RNA structures are more likely to contain pseudoknot structures (40, (65) (66) (67) . However, the RNA-fold which was used in this work does not have the ability to predict such structures, and thus the proposed RPI-Pred cannot consider pseudo-knot structures. This may affect the correct prediction of ribosomal RNAs interacting with proteins. Further, Muppirala et al. (36) used 3-mer sequence features while our RPI-Pred uses 1-mer features of sequence and structure to perform RPI prediction. This leads to an increased dimensionality in feature space, which could lead to an improved prediction.

This experiment was necessary due to the lack of experimentally validated structures for many RNAs, especially ncRNAs and proteins. The objective was to understand to what extent RPI-Pred performance might be affected by using predicted (rather than known) structures. To perform this analysis, we used the RPI-model constructed based on the RPI1807 data set and tested within the same data set. We observed a prediction accuracy of \u223c83%. For the remaining measurements AUC, PRE, REC and FSC, the performance was 0.89, 0.79, 0.94 and 0.86, respectively. Compare with the results obtained using known structures as reported earlier (0.97, 0.94, 0.95 and 0.95 for AUC, PRE, REC and FSC, respectively). In particular, the prediction accuracy (ACC) decreased by nearly 10% compared with the performance of RPI-Pred on RPI1807 data set with known structures. We can observe similar decreases in the other performance measures. Expectedly, precision was significantly reduced when using predicted structures, while there was little or no impact on precision. Since, there is no experimental structural features were available for the rest of our test data sets (i.e. RPI367, RPI13243 and NPIn-ter10412) we used the predicted PBs and RSS in order to perform the RPI prediction.",

Therefore, studying ncRPI can reveal the importance of ncRNA in the posttranscriptional regulatory process. Very few computational studies (34) (35) (36) (37) (38) (39) have been developed to predict the binding partner either for protein or ncRNA using both sequence and structural information.

Nacher and Araki (68) were among the first to study computational construction of ncRPI networks. They built interaction networks based on ncRPI of various model organisms, available in NPInter databases. Following the approach, Muppirala et al. (36) also used results from their proposed RPISeq method for the construction of ncRPI networks. Here, we extended our RPI-Pred approach to construct the the ncRPI networks to further study the important functions of ncRNAs. We evaluated our performance in predicting ncRPI in the NPInter database.",

The ncRPI of D. melanogaster contain both protein hubs (one protein interacting with multiple RNAs), and RNA hubs (one RNA interacting with multiple proteins). The in silico-based network construction helps to understand how many interactions were correctly predicted by our RPI-Pred method in the same protein or RNA hubs, and the reliability of our model in deriving new ncRPI and constructing new biological networks.",

In the recent years, the high-throughput sequencing methods have led to the discovery of enormous amount of ncRNAs, which also interact with protein and regulate gene expression. Hence, it is very important to understand their function by studying the correct interaction partners. However, the experimental methods to determine correct interacting partner(s) for ncRNA are expensive and labor-intensive. In this case, computational approaches were highly relied to predict the interacting partner for ncRNA molecules. To our knowledge, very few studies have been reported for RPI prediction and none of the methods was considered the high-order protein and RNA structures, which are known to be vital to their functions.",

We tested the RPI-Pred method with a set of (nc)RPI data sets, and the results indicated that the proposed RPI-Pred was able to identify (nc)RPI with higher accuracy, when compared with other existing approaches. Therefore, our method is reliable to be applied to identify the binding partner(s) either for a protein or RNA. We further applied the method to in silico construction of ncRNA-protein networks. In addition, the proposed RPI-Pred method can also be extended to determine the binding partners (RNAs) for other types of proteins, such as transcription factors, which are able to interact with both DNA and RNA (69) .

Then, we combined these 7-letter sequence features with the 16-letter PB structure representations, resulting in 112 (7 \u00d7 16) possible combinations. The normalized frequencies of 112 combinations formed the 112 protein vectors. Similarly, RNA sequence and RSS representations resulted in 4 \u00d7 5 possible combinations (4 for the nucleotide types; A, U, C and G and 5 for the RSS), and normalized frequencies of these 20 combinations resulted in 20 RNA vectors. The labels of sequence and structural features obtained from the proteins and RNA are given in SupplementaryTable S2. In summary, to construct the RPI-Pred Nucleic AcidsResearch, 2015, Vol. 43, No. 3 1373 method, we used the sequence and structure features of 132 vectors, in which the first 112 vectors represented proteins and the remaining 20 vectors represented RNAs.",
