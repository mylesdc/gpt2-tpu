The Center for Disease Control and Prevention has issued guidelines reminding healthcare workers about the importance of taking steps to prevent the spread of Zika virus, how to test and isolate patients suspected of carrying the Zika virus, and how to protect themselves from infection. Therefore, it is of utmost importance for healthcare professionals to be fully aware of Zika virus preparedness, and response measures should an outbreak occur in Malaysia in order to quickly and efficiently contain the outbreak, ensure the safety of individual or healthcare personnel safety, as well as to prevent further spreading of the disease. This research aims to show how prepared Malaysian healthcare professionals are against Zika virus and how well can they respond during an outbreak. In total, 504 healthcare professionals (128 general practitioners, 215 community pharmacists, 161 nurses) from private health clinics were the target population of the four states of Malaysia where Zika cases suspected. The sample size of each category was calculated by using a formula for estimating the population proportion. An additional 10% of the calculated sample size was added to compensate the non-response rate. The Center For Disease Control and Prevention and World Health Organisation provided a checklist to assess how prepared healthcare professionals are for an Zika outbreak. This checklist was modified to a questionnaire in order to assess health care professionals' preparedness and response to the Zika outbreak. Community pharmacists are still lacking in their preparedness and perceived response to the Zika outbreak compared to the general practitioners in the private sector. Hence community pharmacists should attend training given by the Ministry of Health Malaysia as a continuing education, which may help them to respond during a Zika outbreak.",

Suspected Zika cases have been reported in four states (Johor, Penang, Sarawak, and Selangor) in Malaysia and hence it is important to focus on the preparedness of healthcare professionals of Malaysia. With help from WHO Western Pacific Regional Office, Malaysia has developed its own Zika virus infection task forces, emergency operation centres, and regional responses [11] , including Zika virus simulation exercises [2] [3] [4] [5] . With the propensity of such activities, healthcare professionals have been provided information on Zika. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess health care professionals' preparedness and response towards Zika outbreak to understand how Malaysian healthcare professionals are prepared against the infection and how well can they respond in case of an outbreak.",

Among the private Malaysian healthcare professionals, three categories (general practitioners in clinical, community pharmacists, and nurses in clinics) were considered in the study as these are the professionals in the Zika virus front-line. The samples were from four states (Johor, Penang, Sarawak, Selangor) in Malaysia, where the suspected cases of Zika virus infection were reported [27] . In total, 504 private healthcare professionals (128 general practitioners, 215 community pharmacists, 161 nurses) were after the sample size calculated from those four states. The sample size of each category was calculated by using a formula for estimation of unknown population proportion [28] . Ten percent of the calculated sample size was added to compensate for the non-response rate [29] . Therefore, the minimum sample size required for each category was 78 general practitioners, 172 community pharmacists, and 145 nurses. A convenient sampling method was used to select the sample. Participants who were willing to give their informed consent to participate and those who have been in practice for more than 6 months during the study period were included. Foreign health care professionals, public, healthcare professionals of Malaysia, and those who were unable to communicate were excluded. A total of 445 healthcare professionals (100 general practitioners, 193 community pharmacists, 152 nurses) from four states was approached in this study.",

Prior to the study, this questionnaire was piloted on 20 private healthcare professionals from four states (five from each state mentioned above) in Malaysia. No modifications were required following the evaluation. The Cronbach's alpha was 0.78 for preparedness and 0.74 for perceived response. The overall Cronbach's alpha was 0.76; indicating that all of the items included make a valid contribution. The questionnaire was a 'Yes' or 'No' type comprised of 30 questions. The statistical computer package, IBM SPSS, Version 22 was used to perform quantitative analysis on the collected data. In order to perform analysis of data, it was necessary to code the response variables, i.e., yes = 1, no = 0. Data cleaning was carried out throughout the data entry process. The analysis of the data was performed through descriptive statistics, such as frequencies for each of the variables. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine the significant differences of each variable between the groups, followed by Tukey's post hoc test to determine the differences of each variable within the groups.

The majority of the respondents were in the age range between 31 and 40 years. In terms of experience, 50.23% of the respondents had at least 10 years during the study period. As a multi-ethnic country, the respondents' ethnicity was comprised of 33% Malay, 39% Chinese, and 26% Indians. Table 1 shows the statistical summary of the demographic details of the respondents. The mean scores presented in Tables 2 and 3 were obtained by calculating the total response for each item in the questionnaire and the total sample participated in each category. Table 2 presented the health care professionals' preparedness for a Zika outbreak. The data revealed that most of the respondents were prepared for the Zika outbreak. Yet, there were significant differences between healthcare professionals on some of the items asked in the questionnaire. The nurses found it difficult to access the research literature on Zika virus management, with a low mean score for this statement (0.31 \u00b1 0.34), while general practitioners found it easy to access the literature with the highest mean score among the other groups (0.69 \u00b1 0.31), with the significant value p = 0.03. Community Pharmacists felt that they have not participated in educational activities related to Zika virus preparedness on a consistent basis (continuing professional development, education classes, seminars, or conferences) with a low mean score (0.36 \u00b1 0.31), whereas the general practitioners (0.61 \u00b1 0.35) had the highest mean scores and felt they have participated in such activities on a regular basis p = 0.002. Community Pharmacists considered themselves, not prepared for the management of Zika virus, with a low mean score (0.35 \u00b1 0.27), whereas the general practitioners in this study considered themselves prepared for the management of Zika virus with the highest mean score (0.72 \u00b1 0.27) p = 0.002. Table 3 presents the health care professionals' perceived responses to the Zika outbreak. The data revealed that most of the respondents perceived postive responses towards theie preparedness for the Zika outbreak. Yet, there were significant differences found between health care professionals' perceived response towards Zika outbreak on some of the items asked in the questionnaire. Community pharmacists were not confident in identifying the signs and symptoms of Zika virus (0.46 \u00b1 0.44) and providing patient education on the Zika virus (0.71 \u00b1 0.48), with low mean scores for these statements p = 0.05. However, the general practitioners had highest mean scores for these statements. Sub-group one-way analysis of variance tests (Table 4 ) did not reveal any significant differences in mean scores for preparedness among the health care professionals regarding age, gender, profession, and ethnicity. However, there was a significant difference in mean scores for preparedness by level of experience among healthcare professionals. Tukey's post hoc test revealed that among the experience level of >5 to 10 years, the general practitioners mean score 14.52 \u00b1 3.12 was significantly higher than those of the other healthcare professionals; nurses 14.21 \u00b1 3.63 (p = 0.04) and pharmacists 13.87 \u00b1 3.42 (p = 0.03).

Community pharmacists' lack of participation in continuing education programs reduced their score in terms of Zika virus infection preparedness. Community pharmacists should be strongly encouraged to attend compulsory continuing education similar to nurses in Malaysia. The reason community pharmacists consider themselves not prepared for the management of Zika virus infection, may be due to the same reasons discussed, that they are busy dispensing medications on the counter. Attending mandatory continuing education may resolve this problem. Government agencies have spent a significant amount and resources to educate medical staff and to make information about the Zika virus infection epidemic publicly available [36] . However, the resources have mainly targeted primary care staff in government services. The down flow of information about the Zika virus infection might have not been disseminated to all the private departments.

This indicates that, although nurses are busy with their daily activities, they participate in continual education whenever there is an emergency outbreak in the country, whereas, the community pharmacists do not. Experience also played an important role in the health care professionals' perceived responses towards the Zika virus. General practitioners who had less than five years experience perceived that they can respond better than community pharmacists with the same years of experience. This may be, because as recent graduates, the training and simulation exercise were fresh in the minds of general practitioners. But the community pharmacists again proved that, the lack of training and simulation exercise regarding Zika virus infection had caused their response towards Zika virus not in parity with other healthcare professionals.",

However, community pharmacists in the private sector still lack in preparedness and perceived response to Zika virus infection.
