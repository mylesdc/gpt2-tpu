The emergence of new virus strains coincides with a higher level of influenza-like illness (ILI), which is seen as a peak of a normal season. Monitoring the spread of an epidemic influenza in populations is a difficult and important task. Twitter is a free social networking service whose messages can improve the accuracy of forecasting models by providing early warnings of influenza outbreaks. In this study, we have examined the use of information embedded in the Hangeul Twitter stream to detect rapidly evolving public awareness or concern with respect to influenza transmission and developed regression models that can track levels of actual disease activity and predict influenza epidemics in the real world. Our prediction model using a delay mode provides not only a real-time assessment of the current influenza epidemic activity but also a significant improvement in prediction performance at the initial phase of ILI peak when prediction is of most importance.

            "text": "Influenza is an important respiratory infectious disease causing seasonal epidemics or occasional pandemics across the world with considerable morbidity and mortality. Much of the observed wintertime increase of mortality in temperate regions is attributed to seasonality of influenza which is easily spread by airborne droplets made when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks. Surveillance has become important to detect clusters of influenza cases and to focus public health resources on mitigating the spread and impact of the outbreaks. However, tracking the spread of an epidemic influenza in populations is a difficult task. Information on surveillance systems used to routinely monitor influenza activity such as influenza-like illness (ILI) has been collected to estimate the relative severity of influenza seasons [1] . Although ILI surveillance provides a valuable picture of influenza activity, ILI reports come directly from doctors and other health service professionals by in vitro identification of influenza viruses, typically with a delay of up to one to two weeks. Since Google search engine query data were detected to be closely associated with seasonal influenza activity [2] , there has been growing interest in monitoring influenza outbreaks using other digital media [3, 4] .",

Useful information for tracking or even forecasting behavior when extracted in an appropriate manner lies embedded in the Twitter stream. Twitter has been used for a variety of purposes in many fields of human activity. It was shown that monitoring the contents of the Twitter messages can improve the accuracy of detecting models by providing early warnings of influenza outbreaks [5] . While Google tracking was found highly correlated with ILI statistics over a long time period [2] , Twitter messages can provide more descriptive information than search engine query data, and estimates of ILI derived from the media can accurately track influenza activity [3, 4] . Twitter has over 500 million active users as of 2012, generating over 340 million tweets daily and handling over 1.6 billion search queries per day [6] . Although Twitter appears to be targeted to a young generation, it has attracted a diverse set of users in terms of age. The majority of Twitter's nearly 10 million visitors in February 2009 were 35 years or older, and a nearly equal percentage of users were between ages 55 and 64 as were between 18 and 24 [7] . In August 2012, the demographic breakdown on the social network still reveals that most users in Twitter and Facebook are 35 or older, and the average Twitter and Facebook users are 37.3 and 40.5 years old, respectively [8] .",

Collection of tweets were expanded via FilterQuery beginning October 2011. We developed JAVA-based Twitter timeline collector and the filtered Twitter stream constituted a subset of the entire stream [3] . To preserve the integrity of the collected tweets, we included tweets containing Hangeul characters only.

The ILI activity was calculated by the number of ILI over the total number of inpatients (per thousand). For use of stationary estimation, the unreported ILI activities were filled by linear interpolation of the previous and next ILI activities to better express a weekly tendency in the ILI data, since KCDC's daily ILI report is not available on Sundays or holidays. Baseline level of ILI activities in daily surveillance influenza outbreak was found to exhibit a threshold of 0.5 persons out of 100. In addition, the missing data in marker frequency matrix were also estimated by the same procedure, in order to remove the effect of spurious noise and periodic components, probably introduced by the weekly work pattern. The resulting marker frequency is further processed by applying a 7-point moving average on each column of the frequency matrix X~fx ij g.

However, the present data we have is limited to only one influenza season. We, therefore, duplicated the avaiable data and used it as if it were the data of the previous influenza season. In computing the regression coefficients, we excluded the data corresponding to not only D days of reporting delay but alsoD D days after the post blackout period as shown in Figure 1 .

However, the use of this algorithm resulted in a significant estimation error during the beginning of winter seasonal peak, whereas this gave a fairly good prediction during the middle and latter part of the influenza season ( Figure 5A ). The comparison of the predicted values and the KCDC's ILI for three different values of KCDC's report delay, D~7,11, and 15, demonstrated the inability of the prediction to follow the initial rise of the ILI data.

This figure showed that computation ofb b j 's based on data on the set of days I E~f 1,2, \u00c1 \u00c1 \u00c1 , i{D{1g gives considerably different value when 'i' (index representing day of the season) is less than 100. However, as 'i' increasesd, the discrepancy between these two became less pronounced. In Figure 6 , we compared the predicted values of Twitter data obtained using PA2 with those reported by the KCDC for D~7,11,15 andD D~11,21,31. For comparison, we duplicated the results obatined using PA1. It was shown that the modified algorithm, PA2, gave a considerably better prediction for y than PA1 with the parameter values considered. The improvement was paricularly significant during the initial period of ILI rise when PA1 had difficulty in predicting. The prediction error, however, increased somewhat as the post blackout periodD D increased. Taken together, even during the beginning of winter seasonal peak, predictive regression algorithms in our model obtained a reasonably reliable prediction of the ILI data.",

Seasons with higher influenza mortality are associated with higher disease transmission and more rapid spread than are mild ones. Although influenza reoccurs each season in regular cycles, efforts to produce reliable and timely estimates of influenza activity are complicated. Various forecasting methods for ILI, using telephone triage calls [15] , over-the-counter medications for respiratory diseases [16] [17] [18] [19] , school absenteeism [20] , and digital media [2] [3] [4] have yielded information about future influenza activity for days to weeks in advance of ILI surveillance. Twitter data can monitor the disease activity faster than current practice allows. Our results demonstrate that Twitter data can be used to track and estimate users' concerns related to influenza disease activity in real time.",

Our results revealed important features that make a significant contribution to the goodness-of-fit of the regression models. First, the LASSO method was chosen to select a subset of markers and their weights to maximize the correlation with the ILI data. Although the more marker terms were included the better performance was achieved in terms of correlation coefficients, there was a strong inter-dependence among the marker frequencies. Optimization of the number of markers was necessary and subsequent automatic marker selection generated a set of 40 markers (Table 1 ) [21] . Linear regression revealed large positive coefficients assigned to markers like 'novel flu' (+4.743), 'lightly' (+2.668), 'flu' (+2.277), and so on. There were also markers with large negative coefficients like 'surely' ({2:769), 'winter' ({2:571), 'concert' ({1:847) and so on. While our model from a large set of markers can overfit, about 40 selected markers were found to be sufficient to obtain reliable results.",

            "text": "Second, linear regression was implemented to examine the prediction performance of our model. Computation of the coefficients depended largely on KCDC s ILI data when its value was fully available. However, since ILI surveillance reports come via identification of influenza viruses with a delay of up to 1-2 weeks, direct comparison of the predicted values with the ILI data was not straightforward. In the absence of KCDC's most recent ILI data, prediction resulted in a significant error at the beginning of the influenza season. This is due to insufficient training data set at the beginning of the current influenza season if only the current season's data were used. This is understandable because computation of the regression coefficients using equations of (9) was based on data collected during the time when ILI is near baseline value. If the previous influenza seasonal data are available, we can use them to improve the accuracy of prediction especially during the period when our algorithm suffers from significant errors. We noted that there are clear seasonal variations in the occurrence of influenza, with a marked peak at wintertime in temperate regions. Therefore, the problem can be circumvented by using data accumulated during the previous influenza season. In order to ensure the fitting algorithm converging despite this problem, we assumed that previous year's seasonal data are very similar to the present year's with regard to the seasonal patterns and applied the same algorithm. However, we avoided using the data in the neighbourhood of the i th day by introducing a post blackout periodD D in addition to the report delay D. Our experiment with duplicated data demonstrated considerable improvement of prediction accuracy.",

Influenza activity recently tends to reach two peaks a year in East Asia. Regardless of the peak time of influenza activity, however, when the KCDC's ILI data of the previous season is available, our algorithm is expected to lead to a considerably more accurate prediction for seasonal influenza activity than when the previous seasonal ILI data is absent. This is a significant improvement in prediction performance, since it is achieved at the initial phase of ILI peak, when prediction is of most importance and enough data of the present season are not yet available to accurately perform the prediction. Moreover, by calculating the regression coefficients by using the most recent set of data, our algorithm can easily adapt to time-varying environment, albeit, slowly. Nevertheless, our algorithm has a few limitations at present. Our data analysis has been restricted to a single season of epidemic influenza in a single location. It was recently found that Google tracking may not work well for diseases with considerable media exposure, in particular, emerging diseases such as 2009 pandemic H1N1 or severe acute respiratory syndrome [22] .",
