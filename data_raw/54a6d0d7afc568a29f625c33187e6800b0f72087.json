            "text": "Macrodomain (MD), a highly conserved protein fold present in a subset of plus-strand RNA viruses, binds to and hydrolyzes ADP-ribose (ADPr) from ADPribosylated proteins. ADPr-binding by the alphavirus nonstructural protein 3 (nsP3) MD is necessary for the initiation of virus replication in neural cells, whereas hydrolase activity facilitates replication complex amplification. To determine the importance of these activities for pathogenesis of alphavirus encephalomyelitis, mutations were introduced into the nsP3 MD of Sindbis virus (SINV), and the effects on ADPr binding and hydrolase activities, virus replication, immune responses, and disease were assessed. Elimination of ADPr-binding and hydrolase activities (G32E) severely impaired in vitro replication of SINV in neural cells and in vivo replication in the central nervous systems of 2-week-old mice with reversion to wild type (WT) (G) or selection of a less compromising change (S) during replication. SINVs with decreased binding and hydrolase activities (G32S and G32A) or with hydrolase deficiency combined with better ADPr-binding (Y114A) were less virulent than WT virus. Compared to the WT, the G32S virus replicated less well in both the brain and spinal cord, induced similar innate responses, and caused less severe disease with full recovery of survivors, whereas the Y114A virus replicated well, induced higher expression of interferon-stimulated and NF-B-induced genes, and was cleared more slowly from the spinal cord with persistent paralysis in survivors. Therefore, MD function was important for neural cell replication both in vitro and in vivo and determined the outcome from alphavirus encephalomyelitis in mice. IMPORTANCE Viral encephalomyelitis is an important cause of long-term disability, as well as acute fatal disease. Identifying viral determinants of outcome helps in assessing disease severity and developing new treatments. Mosquito-borne alphaviruses infect neurons and cause fatal disease in mice. The highly conserved macrodomain of nonstructural protein 3 binds and can remove ADP-ribose (ADPr) from ADPribosylated proteins. To determine the importance of these functions for virulence, recombinant mutant viruses were produced. If macrodomain mutations eliminated ADPr-binding or hydrolase activity, viruses did not grow. If the binding and hydrolase activities were impaired, the viruses grew less well than the wild-type virus, induced similar innate responses, and caused less severe disease, and most of the infected mice recovered. If binding was improved, but hydrolase activity was decreased, the virus replicated well and induced greater innate responses than did the WT, but clearance from the nervous system was impaired, and mice remained paralyzed. Therefore, macrodomain function determined the outcome of alphavirus encephalomyelitis. Citation Abraham R, McPherson RL, Dasovich M, Badiee M, Leung AKL, Griffin DE. 2020.

The hypervariable domain interacts with multiple cellular proteins important for virus replication (13-18), and the zinc-binding domain has a role in the synthesis of viral RNA (19-22). The highly conserved MD consists of a central beta sheet surrounded by four to six helices, a protein fold that exists in all kingdoms of life, including a few families of plus-strand RNA viruses (23-27). MDs bind ADP-ribose (ADPr) on proteins posttranslationally modified by either monomers or polymers of ADPr, a modification known as ADP-ribosylation. ADP-ribosylation is catalyzed by enzymes of the ADP-ribosyltransferase diphtheria toxin-like family of proteins commonly known as poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) that transfer ADPr from NAD \u03e9 to specific residues on target proteins (28-34).",

Viral MDs are of the Macro D subclass that also has ADPribosylhydrolase activity and therefore can remove ADP-ribosylation from modified proteins (26, (41) (42) (43) (44) (45) . Because several PARPs are regulated by interferon (IFN), have antiviral properties, and are under evolutionary diversifying selection (46-49), it has been postulated that the primary function of viral MDs is to counter the host response to infection by removing ADPr from modified host proteins (50, 51). However, chikungunya virus (CHIKV) with nsP3 MD mutations resulting in little or no hydrolase or binding activity is not viable in either mammalian or insect cells, indicating an important role for the alphavirus MD in virus replication (43). CHIKV with mutations that reduced, but did not eliminate, ADPr-binding or hydrolase activity were viable, but replication in neural cells and virulence for newborn mice were impaired. Further in vitro studies showed that ADPr-binding is necessary for initiation of replication in neural cells, whereas hydrolase activity facilitates the amplification of replication complexes (37). However, the effects on neurovirulence have received limited attention.",

Therefore, we reasoned that a free PAR chain labeled at the 1\u0409 terminus with a fluorescent probe could serve as a substrate for determining the binding affinity of the SINV nsP3 MDs for ADP-ribosylated substrates using fluorescence-based biophysical methods such as microscale thermophoresis (MST) (62) . To generate a defined PAR chain fluorescently labeled at the 1\u0409 terminus, we used enzymatically made PAR and cleaved it from modified proteins with alkaline hydrolysis that results in loss of the terminal phosphoribose moiety, generating a 5=-phosphate (63) . After purifying PAR to defined length with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), 1-ethyl-3-(N,N-dimethylamino)isopropyl carbodiimide (EDC) coupling was used to introduce an alkyne at the 1\u0409 terminus of (ADPr) 18 . Cy5-azide was then conjugated to alkyne-(ADPr) 18 via Cu(I)-catalyzed cycloaddition. Cy5-(ADPr) 18 was incubated with 2-fold serial dilutions of SINV WT and mutant MDs, followed by MST analyses. From these assays, we determined that the nsP3 MD WT binds to Cy5-(ADPr) 18 with a K D of 44.49 \u03ee 2.46 M (Fig. 1C) , a value comparable to the affinity of the homologous CHIKV nsP3 MD for free ADPr (27, 43) . The affinities of SINV nsP3 MD mutants for Cy5-(ADPr) 18 , were higher for Y114A (34.81 Effects of nsP3 MD mutations on SINV replication in mouse neuronal cells. The nsP3 MD mutations were introduced into clones of the TE strain of SINV (5, 6), full-length viral RNA was transcribed and viruses recovered after transfection of RNA into BHK cells. All viruses could be rescued. To assess the effects of MD mutations on replication efficiency in mouse neuronal cells, NSC34 cells were infected (multiplicity of infection [MOI] of 10) with WT SINV and SINV with each of the nsP3 MD single mutations (N24A, G32A, G32E, G32S, and Y114A) or set of mutations (G32E/I113R/ Y114N; TM) ( Fig. 2) . Peak virus production was at 24 h for all viruses ( Fig. 2A) . At 12 h, the amount of infectious virus released was similar to WT for G32S, G32A, and N24A, whereas G32E, Y114A, and TM had produced less virus. Infectious virus production by TM was most impaired ( Fig. 2A) , and sequencing of virus from 12 and 24 h showed mutation of G32E to G32S and reversion of position 113 from R to I and position 114 from N to Y. Cells infected with G32E showed less cell death compared to cells infected with other viruses at 24 and 48 h (Fig. 2B ). Sequencing of viruses recovered at 12 and 24 h revealed that, in addition to the TM changes, G32E had reverted from E to WT G. Thus, altered MD function associated with mutation of G32 to E that eliminates hydrolase activity and ADPr-binding ( Fig. 1 ) resulted in selection for reversion to WT G or to the less impaired mutant S (Fig. 1 ) during growth in NSC34 cells. The other mutations (N24A, G32S, G32A, and Y114A) were retained during replication in neural cells.",

As observed during replication in NSC34 cells, G32E reverted to WT G and TM mutated to G32S and reverted to 113I and 114Y, while N24A retained this mutation. Thus, the two viruses with the G32E MD mutation were rapidly selected against during growth in neural cells both in vitro and in vivo. For G32E, reversion to G conferred WT virulence in mice, while selection of G32S in TM, along with reversion of position 113 to I and position 114 to Y led to virulence similar to single mutant G32S (Fig. 3A) . Viruses with other MD mutations were less neurovirulent than WT but differed in whether survivors recovered neurologic function. Because G32E and TM reverted, N24A had been studied previously (55) , and G32S and G32A had similar phenotypes, subsequent studies focused on comparisons between WT, G32S (decreased binding and hydrolase) and Y114A (increased binding and decreased hydrolase).",

Several PARPs are under diversifying evolutionary pressure, are induced by IFN, and/or have demonstrated antiviral activity, suggesting that MD function may be important for countering the antiviral effects of ADP-ribosylated proteins (46, 50, 51, 64, 65) . In addition, although Parp mRNAs are not induced by infection of NSC34 cells, PARPs are activated for ADP-ribosylation and facilitate CHIKV replication (37) . To determine whether Parp mRNA expression was induced by CNS infection, we measured changes in levels of selected Parp mRNAs in brain and spinal cord by qRT-PCR ( Fig. 5A and B) . Expression of Parp1 mRNA changed little, but mRNAs for Parp9, -10, -12, -13, and -14 were increased by infection. At 2 days after infection, the brain levels of Parp9, -10, -12, -13, and -14 mRNAs and the spinal cord levels of Parp14 mRNA were higher in Y114A-infected mice than in either WT or G32S-infected mice. To determine whether PARP14 protein levels were increased after infection, brain and spinal cord homogenates were probed by immunoblotting ( Fig. 5C and D). PARP14 protein levels increased in the CNS after infection with all three viruses with higher levels at 4 days (P \u03fd 0.0001 versus WT/G32S) and lower levels at 6 days (P \u03fd 0.05 versus WT, P \u03fd 0.0001 versus G32S) in the brains of Y114A-infected mice. Therefore, a subset of Parp mRNAs was increased after infection with generally higher levels induced by Y114A than WT or G32S infection.",

Serum levels of SINV-specific IgM were lower for Y114A (P \u03fd 0.01 days 4 and 6) than G32S and WT (Fig. 9A) , whereas levels of IgG were lower in mice infected with G32S (P \u03fd 0.01, days 4 and 6) (Fig. 9A) . Because the antibody levels in the CNS reflect entry of antibody-secreting cells into the brain and spinal cord and are most important for virus clearance and recovery (73, 74) , we also measured SINV-specific antibodies in CNS tissue homogenates. In both the brain (Fig. 9B ) and the spinal cord (Fig. 9C ) the IgM and IgG levels were similar. These data suggest that MD mutations had little effect on induction of the antibody response to SINV. Because CD4 and CD8 T cells also play an important role in adaptive immune responses, we assessed changes in the CNS levels of Cd4, Cd8a, and Cd8b mRNAs after infection as indicators of T cell infiltration and retention (Fig. 10A) . Expression of Cd4 mRNA steadily increased, while Cd8a and Cd8b increased for 6 days and then decreased at 8 days in surviving G32S-and Y114A-infected mice. The levels of Cd4, Cd8a, and Cd8b mRNAs in the brain were similar in the three groups, but in the spinal cord at 6 days the mRNA levels of Cd4 (P \u03fd 0.0001), CD8a (P \u03fd 0.0001), and CD8b (P \u03fd 0.001) were lowest in WT-infected mice (Fig. 10A) .",

Previous studies of CHIKV nsP3 MD mutants showed that these activities are critical for different aspects of alphavirus replication in neuronal cells (37, 43, 55) . If both functions are impaired, initiation of infection is inefficient, and little if any virus is produced. If there is better binding but diminished hydrolase activity, replication is initiated more quickly, but the amplification of replication complexes is impaired (37) . To determine how altered MD functions affect the pathogenesis of encephalomyelitis, we introduced mutations similar to those studied in CHIKV into SINV, a better model system for analysis of CNS alphavirus infection in mice, and showed that the effects on ADPr-binding and hydrolase activities were similar to those observed for CHIKV.",

The amino acid at 114 is more variable in alphaviruses than the other residues studied with a Y in EEEV and WEEV, as well as SINV and CHIKV, but F in VEEV. The Y114A substitution in SINV increases binding while decreasing hydrolase activity ( Fig. 1) (43) and thus provides an opportunity to independently examine the role of MD hydrolase activity in pathogenesis. As for CHIKV (37, 43) , SINV Y114A grew more slowly in NSC34 cells (Fig. 2) and was less virulent in mice (Fig. 3) . However, Y114A replicated as well or better than WT SINV in the CNS, was cleared more slowly from both brain and spinal cord, and resulted in permanent neurologic damage in survivors (Fig. 4) . Initial control of SINV replication in the CNS is dependent on the innate immune response, particularly local production of type I IFN (77) (78) (79) . Because viral MDs can influence both the induction of and the response to innate immune effectors (40, 65, 80, 81) , we assessed multiple parameters of the immune response to SINV in the CNSs of infected mice. Mice infected with Y114A in general had similar CNS levels of IFN-\u2423 and IFN-\u2424 and greater induction of ISGs Parp9, -10, -12, -13, and -14; Ifit1 and -2; and Isg15 ( Fig. 5 and 7) and innate response genes Tlr3, Il1\u2424, Il6, Tnf, Ccl2, Ccl5, and Cxcl10 (Fig. 8 ) compared to WT-infected mice. Because these same parameters tended to be lower in G32S-infected mice where viral RNA loads were also lower than WT, we postulate that MD-determined levels of virus replication in the CNS have a more important role in regulating innate responses than direct MD regulation of these responses.",

SINV clearance is mediated by the adaptive immune response with the combined effects of antibody and IFN-\u2425 (74, 75, 82, 83) . Although production of serum IgM was decreased in Y114Ainfected animals compared to WT and G32S-infected mice, levels of SINV-specific IgM and IgG, as well as Ifn\u2425 mRNA, in the brains and spinal cords were similar or higher ( Fig. 9 and 10) . Therefore, defects in clearance could not be ascribed to failure to induce an adaptive immune response. Because the mechanisms of antibody-mediated and IFN-\u2425-mediated clearance of virus from neurons are not known and MD hydrolase activity affects amplification of replication complexes, shutoff of host protein synthesis and translation of structural proteins (37) , it is possible that MD interactions with intracellular mechanisms of virus clearance are affected by the mutations studied.",

            "text": "Cell culture and quantification of infectious virus. NSC34 mouse neuronal cells (87, 88) and BHK-21 cells were grown in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), L-glutamine (2 mM), penicillin (100 U/ml), and streptomycin (100 g/ml) (Gibco/Life Technologies) at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO 2 incubator. NSC34 cells were infected at an MOI of 10 in DMEM with 1% FBS, followed by incubation at 37\u00b0C. Virus production was measured by plaque assay on BHK-21 cells. Cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion.Animals and infection. Female CD-1 mice with 10-day-old litters were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA) and housed in a specific-pathogen-free animal facility at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. At 14 days of age, mice were lightly anesthetized with isoflurane and infected intracranially with 10 3 PFU of virus diluted in 10 l of PBS. All pups within a litter were infected with the same virus. Mice were weighed and monitored for signs of disease twice daily for 14 days. The following clinical number scoring system was used: 0, clinically normal; 1, ataxia and abnormal gait and tail posture; 2, hunched posture with occasional hind limb rearing (abnormal gait but normal locomotor activity); 3, severe hunched posture with limited to no locomotor activity (hind limb paralysis); and 4, death. For tissue collections, mice were anesthetized with an overdose of isoflurane, bled via cardiac puncture, and perfused with ice-cold PBS. Brains and spinal cords were collected and used fresh or snap-frozen and stored at -80\u00b0C.To assess the virus replication in the CNS, left brain hemispheres (20% [wt/vol]) or whole spinal cords (10% [wt/vol]) from infected mice were homogenized in Lysing Matrix A tubes at 6.0 M/s for 40 s using a FastPrep-24 homogenizer (MP Biomedicals) and clarified by centrifugation at 13,200 rpm for 15 min at 4\u00b0C. The amount of infectious virus in clarified homogenates was determined by plaque formation on BHK-21 cells. The data are plotted as mean log 10 values of PFU per g of tissue, and samples with no detectable plaques at the lowest dilution tested were assigned a value of half the limit of detection.All experiments were performed according to protocols approved by the Johns Hopkins University Animal Care and Use Committee and carried out with strict adherence to the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the U.S. Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.RNA isolation from tissue homogenates and quantification by qRT-PCR. Right brain hemispheres or whole spinal cords from eight animals per group per time point (from two independent experiments) were homogenized in 1 ml of Qiazol reagent in lysing matrix D tubes at 6.0 M/s for 40 s using a FastPrep-24 homogenizer (MP Biomedicals), and RNA was isolated using an RNeasy Lipid Mini RNA isolation kit (Qiagen). Briefly, cDNA was synthesized with random primers using a high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Life Technologies), and qRT-PCR was performed using TaqMan gene expression arrays (Integrated DNA Technologies), and Universal PCR Master mix (Applied Biosystems). The TaqMan gene expression arrays used were: Cd4, Cd8a, Cd8b, Ifn\u2425, Il1\u2424, Il6, Tnf, Ccl2, Ccl5, Cxcl10, Tlr3, Tlr7, Tlr8, Tlr9, Rig-I, Mda5, Gbp1, Gbp2, Ifit1, Ifit2, Isg15, Parp1, Parp9, Parp10, Parp12, Parp13, and Parp14. The \u0394\u0394C T method was used to determine relative gene expression using day 0 samples and rodent Gapdh for normalization.SINV subgenomic plus genomic RNA was quantified by qRT-PCR using TaqMan probe (SINV E2 8760 5=-6-carboxyfluorescein [FAM]-CGCATACAGACTTCCGCCCAGT-6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine [TAMRA]-3=(Applied Biosystems) and primers to the SINV E2 gene (SV 8732F-5=-TGGGACGAAGCGGACGATAA-3=; SV 8805R-5=-CTGCTCCGCTTTGGTCGTAT-3=). SINV genomic RNA was quantified using TaqMan probe (SINV nsP 3317 5=-6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM)-CCATTGCCGCCGAACTCTCCC-6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine [TAMRA]-3=) and primers to the SINV nsp2 gene (SV 3374F 5=-CCGCAAGTATGGGTACGATCA-3=; SV 3454R 5=-GTGCCCTTCCCAGCTAGCT-3=). Numbers of RNA copies were determined using a standard curve made from 10-fold dilutions of a pCRII-TOPO plasmid containing the SINV genomic or subgenomic region and normalized to endogenous rodent Gapdh. The data are plotted as SINV RNA copies/10 6 copies of Gapdh.Enzyme immunoassays. SINV-specific antibody in serum and 10% (wt/vol) brain and spinal cord homogenates was measured using an in-house EIA (89) . Maxisorp 96-well plates (Thermo Scientific Nunc) were coated with 10 6 PFU/well of SINV strain TE in 50 mM NaHCO 3 (pH 9.6) at 4\u00b0C overnight. The wells were blocked with 10% FBS in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. Samples diluted (1:100 for serum and 1:2 for homogenates) in blocking buffer were added, followed by incubation overnight at 4\u00b0C. Bound antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM or IgG (Southern Biotech) diluted 1:1,000 in PBST plus 10% FBS for 2 h at room temperature and developed using a BD OptEIA TMB substrate reagent kit with 2 M H 2 SO 4 as the stop solution. Plates were read at 450 nm, and the optical density (OD) values from control wells were subtracted from the OD values for infected mice.IFN-\u2423, IFN-\u2424, and TNF-\u2423 levels in brain and spinal cord homogenates (10% wt/vol) were measured using commercial ELISA kits (PBL Assay Science; Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Samples from four mice per group per time point were tested in duplicate, and data are presented as pg per ml. The assay range was 12.5 to 400 pg/ml for IFN-\u2423, 15.6 to 1,000 pg/ml for IFN-\u2424, and 8 to 1,000 pg/ml for TNF-\u2423.Immunoblot analyses. Total protein in 10% (wt/vol) brain and spinal cord homogenates was quantified with the DC assay (Bio-Rad), and 20 g was used for SDS-PAGE on a 10% polyacrylamide gel. The samples were electrophoresed and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with antibodies to STAT1, phospho-STAT1 (Cell Signaling Technology), PARP14 (kindly provided by Mark Boothby, Vanderbilt University) (90) and \u2424-actin (Millipore) diluted in 5% BSA. The secondary antibodies were HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (Cell Signaling) diluted 1:10,000 in 2% nonfat dry milk and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were",
