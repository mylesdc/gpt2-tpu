            "text": "Background: Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a highly contagious virus infecting pigs of all ages with high morbidity and mortality among newborn piglets. Currently, there is no effective vaccine available to protect the pigs from PEDV. The N-terminal subunit of spike protein (S1) is responsible for virus binding to the cellular receptor and contains a number of neutralizing antibody epitopes. Thus, we expressed and produced recombinant S1 protein to protect newborn piglets by immunization of sows. Methods: Affinity tagged PEDV S1 protein was expressed in a secretory form in yeast, insect and mammalian cells to identify the most suitable production system. Purified recombinant protein was analysed by SDS-PAGE, Western blot and deglycosylation assay. A pregnant sow was intramuscularly immunized three times with adjuvanted recombinant protein prior to farrowing. PEDV-specific immune responses in sera and colostrum of the sow and piglets were assayed by ELISA and virus neutralization assays. Piglets were challenged orally with PEDV, and clinical parameters were monitored for 6 days post-challenge. Results and conclusion: Of three eukaryotic expression systems tested (yeast, insect-cell, and mammalian), expression by HEK-293 T cells gave the highest yield of protein that was N-glycosylated and was the most appropriate candidate for vaccination. Administration of the subunit vaccine in a sow resulted in induction of S1-specific IgG and IgA that were passively transferred to the suckling piglets. Also, high virus neutralization titres were observed in the serum of the vaccinated sow and its piglets. After PEDV challenge, piglets born to the vaccinated sow exhibited less severe signs of disease and significantly lower mortality compared to the piglets of a control sow. However, there were no significant differences in diarrhea, body weight and virus shedding. Thus, vaccination with S1 subunit vaccine failed to provide complete protection to suckling piglets after challenge exposure, and further improvements are needed for the development of a subunit vaccine that fully protects against PEDV infection.",

Subsequently, PED has become an endemic disease in Asian pig farming countries. Severe PED outbreaks were reported in China in 2010-2012 [7, 8] . From April 2013 to the present, major PEDV outbreaks have been reported in the USA [9] , Canada [10] , Taiwan [11] and Europian countries [12, 13] . The PED is characterized by the presence of watery diarrhea in the infected piglets in first few weeks of their life, dehydration, vomiting and anorexia resulting in high morbidity and mortality [14] . PEDV infection of older pigs results in considerably lower morbidity and mortality. The symptoms of the disease are similar to transmissible gastroenteritis of pigs and hence only laboratory tests can aid in differencial diagnosis [15] . Although, some efforts have been made to create the vaccine against PEDV with varied success, no effective vaccine is available in the market to protect the newborn piglets [14, 15] .",

The S protein is present at the outer surface of the virion and is 1386 amino acid long [16] . The spike protein of coronaviruses forms trimers and plays an important role in the virus attachment and in virus-cell membrane fusion [17] . Porcine aminopeptidase N has been demonstrated to be a functional receptor for the PEDV coronavirus [18] . The S protein of PEDV is a class I membrane glycoprotein consisting of two subunits: the N-terminal S1 and the C-terminal S2. Cleavage of spike protein into S1 and S2 is an essential event in the cellular entry for wild-type PEDV virus but not for cell culture adapted PEDV [19] . Proteolytic cleavage of spike protein in PEDV needs trypsin [19, 20] . Several neutralizing epitopes have been identified on the S protein sequence [21] [22] [23] , and the recombinant S1 protein was previously shown to have protective activity in piglets [24] .",

Initially, the time course was performed for the expression of the S1 protein in the yeast cells over the period of 4 days. Western blot analysis of the cell culture medium of transformed yeast cells resulted in the detection of a specific 35-40 kDa band when probed with anti-his antibody (Fig. 1a) . The observed protein molecular weight was less than the expected 80.9 kDa molecular weight of un-glycosylated S1. This may be due to the cleavage of the protein by yeast protease. The purified protein was detected in SDS-PAGE as a smearing band in a range of 40-70 kDa (Fig. 1b) . The band pattern may be the result of glycosylation of multiple sites in the S1 protein by the yeast cells. The yield of the purified protein from one liter of yeast culture was found to be 180 \u03bcg.",

The S1 protein was detected as a single 130 kDa band for both cells expressing S1 with native signal peptide and cells expressing S1 with TPA (Fig. 3a) .

Affinity purified S1 protein was analysed on SDS-PAGE by Coomassie blue staining and found to be of the expected size (Fig. 3b) . The yield of the S1 protein from HEK 293 T cell culture medium was found to be 30 mg/L, which was 10 and 100-fold higher than the yields obtained from insect cells or yeast cells respectively.",

A sow vaccinated three times with the S1 subunit vaccine had high IgG titres and high virus neutralization titres in the serum as compared to the control sow. Also, high levels of IgG and IgA titers were found in the colostrum of the vaccinated sow. Furthermore, maternal transfer of antibody was demonstrated as only the serum of suckling piglets had high titres of S1 specific IgG and viral-neutralizing antibody. There was higher survival rate among of piglets of vaccinated sow (87.5 %) than in the piglets of control sow (42.9 %) after oral PEDV challenge (P = 0.0002). These survival rates suggest the potential of the S1 protein subunit vaccine in preventing piglet mortality. The vaccinated sow's piglets exhibited lower clinical signs of disease except diarrhea throughout the six day post-challenge period than control piglets.
