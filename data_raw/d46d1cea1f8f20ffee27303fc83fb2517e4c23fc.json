Blocking MERS-CoV zoonotic transmission from dromedary camels, the animal reservoir, could potentially reduce the number of primary human cases. Here we report MERS-CoV transmission from experimentally infected llamas to na\u00efve animals. Directly inoculated llamas shed virus for at least 6 days and could infect all in-contact na\u00efve animals 4-5 days after exposure. With the aim to block virus transmission, we examined the efficacy of a recombinant spike S1-protein vaccine. In contrast to na\u00efve animals, in-contact vaccinated llamas did not shed infectious virus upon exposure to directly inoculated llamas, consistent with the induction of strong virus neutralizing antibody responses. Our data provide further evidence that vaccination of the reservoir host may impede MERS-CoV zoonotic transmission to humans.",

Recently, we reported that although most NAbs target the S1 B domain, antibodies targeting the S1 sialic acid binding domain (S1 A domain) can also provide protection against lethal MERS-CoV challenge in a mouse model [17] .",

Due to reticence in applying live genetically modified organisms, protein recombinant subunit or DNA vaccines mainly based on the S1 protein or gene, respectively, are also under study. A DNAbased vaccine expressing the full-length S protein was shown to induce MERS-CoV specific NAbs and confer protection in rhesus macaques [27] . In addition, MERS-CoV protein-based vaccines using the fulllength or fragments of the S protein were produced in the form of virus-like particles, nanoparticles, peptides, or recombinant protein. Partial protection efficacy for some candidates has been demonstrated in non-human primates (NHP) [28, 29] and hDPP4 transgenic mice [30-36.] A more recent study demonstrated that an S protein subunit vaccine conferred protection to MERS-CoV (EMC/2012 strain) in an alpaca model, although in dromedary camels the vaccine was only able to reduce and delay viral shedding [37] . However, there is no evidence that any of the MERS-CoV vaccine candidates developed so far are able to block MERS-CoV transmission in camelids when tested in a direct-contact virus transmission setting, mimicking natural transmission in the field. Vaccinating the MERS-CoV animal reservoirs can potentially reduce transmission to humans and provide a simple and economical solution to avoid expansion of this threatening disease.",

The cDNA was then used as a template to PCR amplify the MERS-CoV spike S1 encoding region (nucleotides positions 21,304-25,660, GenBank Accession JX869059) using the PfuUltra II Fusion HS DNA polymerase (Aligent Technologies). The PCR was carried out as follows: 95\u00b0C for 5 min, 39 cycles of 20 sec at 95\u00b0C, 20 sec at 48\u00b0C, and 45 sec at 72\u00b0C, and a final extension at 72\u00b0C for 1 min. The amplicons were sequenced bidirectionally using the BigDye Terminator v3.1 cycle sequencing kit on an ABI PRISM 3130XL Genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems).",

Regarding the transmission study, all directly inoculated and in-contact na\u00efve llamas seroconverted to MERS-CoV as detected by MERS-CoV S1 ELISA (Figure 3a ) and virus neutralization ( Figure  3b ). In contrast, only three of those, two directly inoculated and one in-contact, also developed anti-N antibody responses (see Supplementary Fig. S6a ). Antibodies against the S1 A sialic acid binding domain were detected in one of the directly inoculated and four in-contact na\u00efve animals using a HI assay ( Figure  3c ). Receptor-binding blocking (mainly RBD-directed) antibodies were detected in the sera of all directly inoculated animals and in four out of the five in-contact na\u00efve llama sera using a competitive RBI ELISA (Figure 3d ). Following MERS-CoV S1 vaccination, all vaccinated animals (Figure 4a-d, red) developed high titres of serum S1-reactive antibodies (Figure 4a ) and virus neutralizing antibodies against both clade B Qatar15/2015 and a clade A EMC/2102 isolates as detected by PRNT (Figure 4b, Supplementary Fig. S4b ). In particular, the vaccination induced antibodies against the two functional domains of S1, the S1 A binding N-terminal domain as detected by HI assay (Figure 4c ) and the RBD as detected by a competitive RBI ELISA ( Figure  4d) . Additionally, only one directly inoculated but none of the vaccinated animals developed antibodies against the N protein ( Supplementary Fig. S6b ). Aiming to assess mucosal immunity elicited upon vaccination, we evaluated the presence of antibodies in the nasal cavity. Remarkably, we detected low levels of both MERS-CoV S1-directed and neutralizing antibodies in the nasal swabs of three out of the five vaccinated animals (Figure 4e , f).",

Consistent with previous studies [10] , all MERS-CoV inoculated llamas got infected, shed infectious virus and were able to transmit the virus to all naive contact animals as assessed by MERS-CoV RNA and viral titration of the nasal swabs. We confirmed that 3 infected llamas were able to transmit MERS-CoV to at least 5 na\u00efve animals; nonetheless, further studies are needed to determine the basic reproduction ratio of this virus transmission in camelids. Interestingly, the three contact llamas shedding infectious MERS-CoV showed the highest viral RNA loads, while the remaining two had higher Cq values and no infectious virus was isolated. Altogether, taking into account that (i) viral genomic replication was observed in all in-contact na\u00efve llamas for an extended period, (ii) 3 out of 5 in-contact animals shed detectable infectious virus and (iii) one of them exhibited nasal discharges, this in-contact model of virus transmission is valuable to test vaccine efficacy. However, before stating that llamas can be surrogates of dromedaries for vaccine testing in an in-contact model, it would be important to assess whether infectious viral pressure elicited by the experimental challenge are similar between these two animal species. In that respect, in a previous report, [19] , similar to what we found in the present study in llamas infected intranasally with the MERS-CoV Qatar15/2015 strain.",

Thus, the efficacy of an S1 recombinant protein emulsified with the adjuvant Montanide\u2122 ISA 206 VG was evaluated as a potential vaccine candidate. We showed that immunized llamas were efficiently protected against MERS-CoV infection; no infectious virus was detected in the nose of any of the vaccinated animals and viral RNA shedding remained low (Cq \u2265 34), with the exception of one llama (No. 15). Viral mRNA was also detected in the nasal cavity of this llama, which might be from intracellular viral mRNA from cells harvested in the nasal swabs; nonetheless, we could not detect any infectious virus. Neutralization of the virus by antibodies at mucosal level may have inhibited infectious viral particle production. The lack of detectable infectious virus in the vaccinated llamas despite being infected, renders these animals unlikely to transmit the virus further to other animals and thus blocking the transmission chain. In addition, our studies revealed a mutation (S465F) in the spike protein encoded by this viral RNA, which may suggest a potential escape variant being produced. However, the emergence of the same mutation in another vaccinated llama, in one na\u00efve in-contact animal and in other three directly inoculated llamas was revealed. In addition, the capacity of vaccinated animals to induce NAbs against this variant when isolated, indicate that it is unlikely an escape variant induced under antibody pressure. Mutation at this site (S465F) is not directly involved in receptor binding but has been previously reported to occur as a result of virus adaptation to its host receptor [46] . Overall, this indicates a probable adaptive mutation rather than a vaccine escape mutation.",

These latter antibodies may be important in blocking virus attachment to sialic acid present in camelids, as it has been demonstrated in the dromedary camel upper respiratory tract [45] . Importantly, serum NAbs were generated in all vaccinated animals after the boosting immunization and were maintained during challenge. Therefore, a correlation of NAb levels in serum upon vaccination and protection occurred, as previously described in another vaccination study in camelids [37] . Notably, we detected mucosal NAb in the nasal cavity of 3 out of 5 vaccinated llamas, as also reported in dromedary camels immunized with an MVA-based candidate [19] . In addition, we demonstrate that vaccination of llamas with a spike protein from a clade A MERS-CoV (EMC/2012 isolate) provides protection against a challenge with a clade B virus (Qatar15/ 2015 islolate). Since evidence of MERS-CoV reinfection has been reported in camels in the field [47] , further studies to determine whether intramuscular administration of the subunit vaccine can boost mucosal immunity in the upper respiratory tract of animals that have been previously exposed to MERS-CoV are needed.",

Here we used the Montanide\u2122 ISA 206 VG adjuvant, which was shown to induce long-term protective immunity in large animal species by stimulating both cell-mediated and humoral immune responses [48] . Further studies should be conducted in target species in order to determine the optimal antigen dose and the persistence of NAb following S1 recombinant vaccination. In fact, here, two doses of 35 and 50 \u00b5g were enough to induce protection, as opposed to a recent study which used 3 doses of 400 \u00b5g of the S1 antigen with a combination of adjuvants [37] . Unlike vector-based vaccines, proteinbased vaccines do not require safety testing in high containment facilities and field studies could be directly conducted; thus, reducing the cost of the proposed vaccine. The registered adjuvant used in this study, Mon-tanide\u2122 ISA 206 VG, offers economical and practical use for field applications. Therefore, the S1 recombinant vaccine tested in this study appears as a good candidate to prevent animal-to-animal and, eventually, animal-to-human transmission.",
