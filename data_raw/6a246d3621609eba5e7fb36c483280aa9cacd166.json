Most vaccination protocols adapt two or three doses to induce long-term lasting immunity. Our previous study showed that the naked DNA encoding the triple-antigen fusion TFP846 (Rv3615c-Mtb10.4-Rv2660c) induced robust T cellular immune responses accompanying four inoculations against mycobacteria infection. However, a number of compliance issues exist in some areas lacking the appropriate medical infrastructure with multiple administrations. In this study, a novel vesicular stomatitis virus expressing TFP846 (VSV-846) was developed and the immune responses elicited by VSV-846 were evaluated. We observed that intranasal delivery of VSV-846 induced a potent antigen-specific T cell response following a single dose and VSV-846 efficiently controlled bacterial growth to levels \u223c10-fold lower than that observed in the mock group 6 weeks post-infection in BCG-infected mice. Importantly, mice immunized with VSV-846 provided long-term protection against mycobacteria infection compared with those receiving p846 or BCG immunization. Increased memory T cells were also observed in the spleens of VSV-846-vaccinated mice, which could be a potential mechanism associated with long-term protective immune response. These findings supported the use of VSV as an antigen delivery vector with the potential for TB vaccine development.",

Considering that there are many issues in some areas lacking the medical infrastructure to support multiple injections (Fachado et al., 2003) , vaccination with a needle-free single dose should be considered as an important goal for vaccine development. Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), a negative-stranded RNA virus, has been proved to be a favorite viral vector for delivery of foreign vaccine antigens (Rose et al., 2001; Haglund et al., 2002; Clarke et al., 2007; Braxton et al., 2010) . VSV has three major advantages as a potential delivery platform against TB. First, we and other groups demonstrated that VSV can be vaccinated through mucosa (Tan et al., 2005; Wu et al., 2014) . It is believed that it is superior to elicit protective immune responses against infectious diseases at the site of infection (Davis, 2001) . Second, with the help of the VSV reverse genetic system, additional genes can be easily inserted into the viral genome, and the recombinant VSV (rVSV) expressing foreign antigens can be grown to high titers in mammalian cell lines (Goonetilleke et al., 2003) . Third, rVSV could stimulate potent humoral and cellmediated immune responses in a needle-free single dose in animal models (Johnson et al., 1997; Faber et al., 2005; Cobleigh et al., 2010) . Additionally, the prevalence of anti-VSV antibodies in the general population is extremely low. Therefore, few people carry pre-existing antibodies to counteract the VSV-based vaccines (Lichty et al., 2004) . Previously, a VSV based TB vaccine VSVAg85A expressing the highly immunogenic antigen Ag85A was shown to be protective upon pulmonary M.tb challenge when administrated to mice intranasally (Roediger et al., 2008) . However, this protection manifested at an early time-point as detected 2 weeks following immunization and was not sustained.",

The PCR product was cleaved with XhoI and NheI and cloned into the fifth position of the pVSV-XN2 plasmid (Cobleigh et al., 2010) , generating pVSV-XN 2 -846. The recombinant VSV-846 virus was generated by the following procedure: In brief, baby hamster kidney cells BHK-21 (ATCC number:CCL-10) grown to 60% confluence were infected with recombinant vaccinia virus expressing T7 RNA polymerase (Fuerst et al., 1986) and incubated for 1 h in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM). Vaccinia virus-infected cells were then co-transfected with the plasmids pVSV-XN 2 -846 and the other plasmids for the expression of VSV N, P, and L (Ritz et al., 2012) . Supernatants were collected 48 h post transfection, filtered through a 0.2 \u00b5m pore filter to remove vaccinia virus, and passaged onto fresh BHK-21 cells. The medium was collected immediately and filtered through a 0.2 \u00b5m pore filter after cytopathic effects were observed 2 days later. Recombinant VSV was then plaque purified and expanded. The titer was determined, and the VSV-846 was stored at \u221280 \u2022 C until use.",

VSV vectors shared certain advantages for use in vaccine delivery. Specifically, they can induce robust humoral and cell-mediated Th1 immunity following a single dose in the absence of an additional adjuvant (Publicover et al., 2005) . So far, traditional vaccinations require repeated doses to induce long-lasting immunity and specific adjuvant are often needed. For example, the two-dose HeVsG vaccine requires the action of two adjuvants, all hydrogels, and the CpG oligo deoxynucleotide (Bossart et al., 2012) to generate a Th1 immune response. However, hydrogels alone typically induce a Th2 response that is not appropriate against viral infections (Coffman et al., 2010; Steinhagen et al., 2011) .",

Both Rv3615c and M.tb10.4 cover high density of T cell epitopes that promote strong T cell immune response, including functional T cell subsets secreting both IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 (Millington et al., 2011) . Rv2660c is stably expressed in the early and late stages of M.tb infection, and significantly enhances protective immunity characterized by a high proportion of multifunctional CD4+ T cells against M.tb infection in mice and cynomolgus macaques (Aagaard et al., 2011; Lin et al., 2012) .
