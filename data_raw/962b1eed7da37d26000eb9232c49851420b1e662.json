Some candidates for genetic markers capable of differentiating these two pathotypes of a unique virus (feline coronavirus) have been proposed by several studies. In the present survey, in order to search for markers that can differentiate FECV and FIPV, several clones of the 3a-c, E, and M genes were sequenced from samples obtained from cats with or without FIP. All genes showed genetic diversity and suggested the presence of FCoV mutant spectrum capable of producing a virulent pathotype in an individualspecific way. In addition, all the feline coronavirus FIPV strains demonstrated a truncated 3c protein, and the 3c gene was the only observed pathotypic marker for FCoVs, showing that 3c gene is a candidate marker for the distinction between the two pathotypes when the mutant spectrum is taken into account.",

Animals and Samples. From 2010 to 2013, tissue (eye, cerebrum, cerebellum, lung , heart muscle, thoracic lymph node, thymus, liver, spleen, stomach, mesenteric lymph node, peripancreatic lymph node, kidneys, large and small intestines, and urinary bladder), abdominal, thoracic, and pericardial effusions, aqueous humor, and faecal samples were collected during the necropsies of 6 cats with clinical manifestations and histopathological changes consistent with FIP, such as localized inflammation with macrophages, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and plasma cells. Vascular lesions were found surrounded by a proliferation of inflammatory cells in heart, lung, omentum, kidneys, cerebrum, and cerebellum. Focal accumulations of inflammatory cells and necroticproliferative lesions were observed in granulomatous lesions. Intestinal samples were collected including mucosa, submucosa, muscular layer, and serosa. Only 2 animals (USP6, and USP7) showed signs of dry-form FIP (neurological changes), while the remaining 4 (USP8, USP16, USP17, and USP18) showed an accumulation of effusion in body cavities (effusive FIP).",

Also, after an experimental inoculation of cats with truncated and complete 3abc, the role of the truncation in this region on FIP pathogenesis could not be clearly determined, despite it led to lower viral replication in the gut [24] . However, in the present study, the sample from the large intestine of the cat USP17 (FIP+), from which the studied clones originated and which demonstrated a truncated 3c gene, was positive for FCoV mRNA. This result indicated the presence of viral replication in that sample.",

The M protein of FCoVs is the most abundant structural protein [25] . The presence of a premature stop codon in a constitutive gene such as the M gene is incompatible with the functionality of the virion. However, this defective virus is no less important than the others, as it provides genetic background for recombination with other FCoVs, resulting in greater genetic diversity and possibly increased virulence of some viral quasispecies. Recent studies suggest that the 3c gene, which encodes a small protein (238aa) of unknown function, is associated with most FIPV isolates when present in truncated form, although not all FCoV strains in FIP+ samples present this 3c form [13, 14, 20] . In the present study, the 3c truncated protein was observed in all clones obtained 7 Table 3 : Mean, maximum, and minimum nucleotide identities of 3a-c, E, and M FCoV genes from different clones. It is essential to note that if the predominant viral population in the present study had been assessed by direct amplicon sequencing only, as in studies conducted by other authors [13-15, 19, 20] , without using the previous cloning step, the truncated 3c gene could have been undetected as it was only present in a minority of the sequences observed in the cerebrum of the cat USP16 (FIP+).",
