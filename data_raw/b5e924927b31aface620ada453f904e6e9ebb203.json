            "text": "Reovirus infection leads to apoptosis in both cultured cells and the murine central nervous system (CNS). NF-kB-driven transcription of proapoptotic cellular genes is required for the effector phase of the apoptotic response. Although both extrinsic death-receptor signaling pathways and intrinsic pathways involving mitochondrial injury are implicated in reovirusinduced apoptosis, mechanisms by which either of these pathways are activated and their relationship to NF-kB signaling following reovirus infection are unknown. The proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member, Bid, is activated by proteolytic cleavage following reovirus infection. To understand how reovirus integrates host signaling circuits to induce apoptosis, we examined proapoptotic signaling following infection of Bid-deficient cells. Although reovirus growth was not affected by the absence of Bid, cells lacking Bid failed to undergo apoptosis. Furthermore, we found that NF-kB activation is required for Bid cleavage and subsequent proapoptotic signaling. To examine the functional significance of Bid-dependent apoptosis in reovirus disease, we monitored fatal encephalitis caused by reovirus in the presence and absence of Bid. Survival of Biddeficient mice was significantly enhanced in comparison to wild-type mice following either peroral or intracranial inoculation of reovirus. Decreased reovirus virulence in Bid-null mice was accompanied by a reduction in viral yield. These findings define a role for NF-kB-dependent cleavage of Bid in the cell death program initiated by viral infection and link Bid to viral virulence.",

Multiple studies using animal models of viral disease demonstrate a correlation between apoptotic potential and disease severity [1, 2, 3, 4] . These observations highlight proapoptotic signaling following virus infection as an attractive target for antiviral therapy. However, despite its central importance in viral pathogenesis, gaps in knowledge about the identity of death signaling pathways that modulate virus-induced apoptosis in vivo, along with an incomplete understanding of how these signaling cascades are activated during virus infection, have hampered the deployment of this strategy for treatment of viral disease.",

As such, studies of these viruses have contributed to an understanding of how virus infection culminates in apoptotic cell death. Unlike other viruses in which virulence correlates with cell-death capacity, the identity of viral and cellular factors that regulate reovirus-induced apoptosis in cell culture are for the most part known [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] . Moreover, many of these intermediaries also modulate reovirus-induced apoptosis in vivo [4, 7, 11, 12] . Studies using reassortant reoviruses [5, 6] , ectopically expressed proteins [13] , and genetically engineered reovirus mutants [4, 7] highlight a critical role for reovirus outer-capsid protein m1 in apoptosis induction. Collectively, these studies indicate that prodeath signaling evoked by m1 occurs subsequent to membrane penetration but prior to synthesis of viral RNA or protein [4, 7, 14, 15] .",

Blockade of NF-kB signaling using chemical inhibitors or cell lines genetically deficient in NF-kB p50, NF-kB p65/RelA, IkB kinase (IKK)-a, or IKK adaptor IKKc/NEMO significantly diminishes reovirus-induced apoptosis [8, 28] .

Hence, blockade of apoptosis may serve as a useful strategy to dampen the severity of viral disease. However, deployment of such a strategy requires identification of host signaling networks that control cell death and a detailed molecular blueprint of how these pathways are activated by a virus. In this study, we used mammalian reovirus, an important experimental model for studies of viral encephalitis, to elucidate how cell death pathways are activated following viral infection and whether these signaling cascades influence the capacity of a virus to produce lethal CNS disease. We found that Bid, a host regulator of cell death, influences apoptosis induction by reovirus. Moreover, Bid is required for efficient reovirus replication in the CNS and modulates reovirus neurological disease. These findings highlight Bid as a critical regulator of viral pathogenesis and illuminate a potential new target for development of antiviral therapeutics.

Based on these data, we hypothesized that caspase-8 activity as a consequence of extrinsic prodeath signaling, is required for cleavage and activation of Bid. To test this hypothesis, we assessed the capacity of reovirus to mediate Bid cleavage in L929 cells treated with caspase-8 inhibitor Z-IETD-FMK ( Figure 1B ). As anticipated, Bid cleavage was not observed in mock-infected cells or mock-infected cells treated with Z-IETD-FMK (data not shown). Although tBid was generated at 36-48 h following reovirus infection of vehicle-treated cells, reovirus failed to efficiently induce activation of Bid in Z-IETD-FMK-treated cells until 48 h post-infection, providing evidence that reovirus evokes cleavage of Bid via caspase-8. In response to a variety of death agonists, Bid amplifies death signaling by linking the extrinsic (caspase-8) and intrinsic (caspase-9) apoptotic pathways [30] . Since our findings with reovirus parallel this pattern, our results suggest that Bid functions similarly following reovirus infection by linking the death-receptor and mitochondrial apoptotic pathways.",

This observation, along with the dependence of mitochondrial apoptotic signaling on cleavage of Bid, suggests that Bid serves an essential function in reovirusinduced apoptosis. To directly test whether Bid is required for apoptosis induction following reovirus infection, we compared reovirus-induced apoptosis in wild-type and Bid-deficient MEFs. For these experiments, MEFs were infected with T3D, and apoptosis was assessed by chemiluminescent measurement of the activity of caspase-3 and caspase-7, which serve as effector caspases for both the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways ( Figure 2A ). In comparison to mock-infected cells, infection of wild-type cells resulted in a significant increase in caspase-3/7 activity at 24 h post-infection. Since MEFs are poorly permissive for reovirus infection [41] , staining of infected cells by indirect immunofluorescence indicated that adsorption with 100 PFU/cell of T3D resulted in infection of only ,8% of cells at 20 h post infection (data not shown). Despite a low frequency of infection, this MOI resulted in an ,3-fold increase in caspase-3/7 activity. When infection was initiated at 1000 PFU/cell, ,20% cells were infected (data not shown), and caspase-3/7 activity increased ,5fold. In contrast, infection of Bid-deficient cells resulted in minimal caspase-3/7 activity following infection at either MOI. Increase in caspase-3/7 activity following treatment of each cell type with a broad-spectrum protein kinase inhibitor, staurosporine, was equivalent (,5-fold), demonstrating that although Bid-deficient cells possess functional death-signaling pathways, they resist apoptosis induction by reovirus.",

Wild-type and Bid-deficient MEFs were transfected with an NF-kB-luciferase reporter plasmid and infected with reovirus.

Treatment of both wild-type and p65/RelA-deficient MEFs with apoptotic agonists TNFa and cycloheximide resulted in efficient cleavage of Bid, indicating that cell-death pathways leading to Bid cleavage are intact in both cell types. These findings suggest that cleavage and activation of Bid following reovirus infection requires NF-kB and place Bid cleavage subsequent to NF-kB signaling in response to reovirus infection.

However, it is not known which of these pathways mediates cleavage-induced activation of Bid. It is also not understood whether NF-kB regulates the activation of these pathways. Since upregulation of Fas following reovirus infection is dependent on prodeath signaling via c-Jun N terminal kinase (JNK) [43] , and because JNK is activated via a mechanism distinct from NF-kB following reovirus infection [44] , we focused our efforts on assessing the regulation and function of death-receptor signaling via TRAIL following reovirus infection. For these studies, we assessed the capacity of reovirus to induce apoptosis in MEFs lacking TRAIL-R, the only known receptor for TRAIL on murine cells [45, 46, 47] (Figure 4 ). In comparison to mock infection, T3D infection of wild-type cells resulted in an MOI-dependent ,5-to 20-fold increase in caspase-3/7 activity at 24 h post-infection ( Figure 4A ). Although T3D infection of TRAIL-R-deficient cells also resulted in an increase in caspase-3/7 activity in comparison to mock-infection, the magnitude of this increase was only ,2-to 6-fold. Assessment of apoptosis in wild-type and TRAIL-Rdeficient MEFs using AO staining also showed an increase in apoptosis both in wild-type and TRAIL-R-deficient cells in comparison to mock-infected cells ( Figure 4B ). However, a substantially greater fraction of wild-type cells showed morphologic features of apoptosis in comparison to TRAIL-R-deficient cells infected at equivalent MOI, suggesting that efficient induction of apoptosis by reovirus requires TRAIL-R. T3D displayed comparable replication kinetics and produced equivalent yields in wild-type and TRAIL-R-deficient cells ( Figure 4C ). Thus, Figure 2 . Bid is required for apoptosis induction following reovirus infection. (A) Wild-type or Bid-deficient MEFs were adsorbed with T3D at the MOIs shown. After incubation at 37uC for 24 h, caspase-3/7 activity in cell lysates was determined. Results are expressed as the mean ratio of caspase-3/7 activity from infected cell lysates to that from mock-infected cells for triplicate samples. Error bars indicate SD. *, P,0.05 as determined by Student's t-test relative to wild-type MEFs infected at an equivalent MOI. Cells were treated with 10 mM staurosporine (Sts) for 24 h as a control.

Reovirus-infected cells were quantified by counting fluorescent cells. Results are expressed as mean fluorescent focus units (FFU) per field for triplicate samples. Error bars indicate SD.

We thought it possible that this difference in viral load might contribute to the dramatic difference in the requirement for Bid in the pathogenesis of reovirus-induced CNS disease following PO and IC inoculation. To test this hypothesis, we inoculated wild-type and Bid-deficient animals intracranially with a considerably lower but still lethal dose of T3SA+, 5 PFU, and monitored infected animals for signs of reovirus encephalitis ( Figure 6C ). In comparison to wild-type mice in which ,95% succumbed to disease, ,70% of Bid-deficient mice developed lethal encephalitis. Moreover, the median survival time of wildtype mice infected with T3SA+ was significantly less (13 days) than that of Bid-deficient mice (15 days). To determine whether this difference in survival correlates with the efficiency of reovirus replication in the CNS, we compared titers of reovirus in brains resected from infected mice at 4, 8, and 12 d post-inoculation ( Figure 6D ).

This time point was chosen to coincide with the presence of maximal viral titers following inoculation by this route. Since the inoculum used for these experiments was at least ,10-fold lower than that used for most other studies of reovirus CNS pathogenesis [4, 7, 11, 12, 43, 48, 51] , the extent of injury following infection of wild-type mice was not as extensive. Nonetheless, inoculation of wild-type mice with T3SA+ resulted in neuronal death in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, and hypothalamus, consistent with previous reports [4, 7, 11, 12, 43, 48, 51] . While the majority of infected wild-type mouse brains showed signs of injury, tissue damage was minimal in all of the brains examined from similarly infected Bid-deficient animals. Examination of the hippocampal region of a representative wild-type mouse brain at higher magnification showed damage to the CA3 region, with the pyramidal cells showing condensed nuclei characteristic of apoptosis ( Figure 7B ). In contrast, little damage was detected in an equivalent region of a Bid-deficient mouse brain ( Figure 7B ).

We found that although Bid is dispensable for reovirus replication in cell culture, it is required for the induction of apoptotic cell death following reovirus infection. In this context, Bid is converted to its active, proapoptotic form, tBid, in an NF-kB-dependent manner. Generation of tBid in reovirus-infected cells requires signaling via TRAIL-R and caspase-8. These findings indicate that NF-kB signaling following reovirus infection results in activation of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.

            "text": "Many viruses induce apoptosis via activation of host-encoded apoptosis-regulating factors. For example, the VSV M protein induces apoptosis by inhibiting the transcription of antiapoptotic factors such as Bcl-xl [52] . In other cases, virus-encoded polypeptides insert into mitochondrial membranes and trigger cytochrome c release, leading to activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. For example, influenza A virus PB1-F2 is thought to directly activate proapoptotic signaling by interaction with the mitochondrial membrane-associated factors ANT3 and VDAC1 [53] . Although one model for apoptosis induction by reovirus suggests that the w fragment of reovirus m1 protein induces apoptosis by directly targeting mitochondria analogous to PB1-F2 [13] , our studies using apoptosis-defective reovirus mutants [4, 7] , coupled with data presented here, support the idea that w-mediated NF-kB signaling activates the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway indirectly via death-receptor signaling and Bid cleavage. This indirect mechanism of mitochondrial pathway activation by a proximal signal transducer also explains the timing of prodeath signaling in the reovirus replication cycle. We think that events associated with viral entry into cells, which are mediated by the m1 w fragment subsequent to membrane penetration, activate NF-kB within 1 h of infection [7, 28] . Unlike other NF-kB agonists such as TNFa which rapidly and transiently activate NF-kB, activation of NF-kB following reovirus infection is gradual and sustained and occurs maximally at 6-8 h post infection [28] . Activated NF-kB complexes lead to expression of genes that promote cleavage-induced activation of Bid at 24-36 h post infection and elicit characteristic features of apoptosis, including effector caspase activation and DNA fragmentation. These changes occur subsequent to completion of viral replication, and, therefore, apoptosis appears to have little detectable effect on viral growth in cell culture [4, 7, 8, 28] . Although unusual, NF-kBdependent apoptotic pathways are also utilized by other viruses such as Dengue virus [54] , HIV [55] , infectious bursal disease virus [56] , and Sindbis virus [57] . Thus, our studies may have uncovered a potentially conserved signaling pathway utilized by viruses to induce apoptosis via NF-kB.",

            "text": "It is not known how activation of NF-kB by reovirus culminates in cell death. Three previous studies have attempted to identify proapoptotic host genes that serve as effectors of the death response following reovirus infection. In the first, gene-expression profiles following infection with reovirus strains type 1 Lang (T1L) and type 3 Abney (T3A), which differ in the capacity to induce apoptosis [58] , were compared by microarray analysis [59] . These experiments did not demonstrate differences in expression of death ligands or their respective receptors following infection by either strain. Thus, it was concluded that expression of these death mediators by reovirus is unlikely to contribute to apoptosis induction by reovirus. However, some differences were observed in expression of regulators of death-receptor signaling [59] . But since T1L and T3A display significant genetic diversity and vary in the modulation of multiple signaling pathways [9, 60] , the contribution of NF-kB to the expression of prodeath genes could not be established. In the second study, gene-expression profiles following T3D infection in the presence and absence of functional NF-kB were compared [61] . Although this study identified several NF-kB-dependent genes that coordinate the cellular antiviral immune response, including numerous interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), no classical components of death receptor-mediated signaling pathways or proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members were significantly upregulated in response to reovirus infection. In the third study, gene-expression profiles of reovirus strains that differ in the capacity to elicit translational shutoff were compared [62] . This study also demonstrated an increase in ISG expression but did not identify obvious NF-kB-dependent candidates that could serve to activate death receptor signaling.",

Third, NF-kB activation following reovirus infection may regulate death signaling at a post-transcriptional level by an as yet unknown mechanism. In support of this idea, levels of DR5 protein increase following reovirus infection [17] but not its mRNA [59] .

In some cell types, known as type I cells, caspase-8 activation results in direct, Bidindependent activation of the apoptosis effectors, caspase-3 and caspase-7 [29] . In others, known as type II cells, apoptosis requires amplification of death signals through stimulation of the mitochondrial pathway. In these cases, Bid serves to link the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways [30] . Since the requirement for Bid in reovirus virulence is dependent on viral dose, we think that the role of Bid as an apoptosis regulator contributes to viral replication and consequent neurovirulence. Thus, we hypothesize that neurons function like type I cells when infected at a higher dose of virus and do not require the amplification of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway via Bid to undergo apoptotic cell death. However, at lower infectious doses, neurons function like type II cells and require Bid-driven activation of the intrinsic mitochondrial apoptotic cascade to elicit cell death. This model also may explain why primary neuronal cultures infected with reovirus at a high MOI do not appear to require cytochrome c release and caspase-9 activation for apoptosis induction [42] .",

One possibility is that Bid-regulated apoptosis is required for efficient release of virus from neurons. Therefore, cell-to-cell spread of reovirus within the CNS may be inefficient in the absence of Bid. As an extension of this idea, blockade of apoptosis by other means also should cause a delay in reovirus replication. However, although symptoms of encephalitis are alleviated in NF-kB p50-deficient mice or in wild-type mice treated with a JNK inhibitor due to a reduction in virus-induced neuronal apoptosis, reovirus replication kinetics are not substantially diminished [11, 12] . Consistent with these findings, diminished virulence of apoptosis-defective reovirus mutants is not accompanied by significant decreases in reovirus replication efficiency in the CNS [4, 7] . Apoptosis following reovirus infection can occur in absence of p50, albeit at low efficiency [8] . Similarly, apoptosisdefective reovirus mutants retain some capacity to induce apoptotic cell death [4, 7] . Therefore, it is possible that in comparison to reovirus infection of Bid-deficient mice, CNS apoptosis was incompletely blocked in these other studies. Such a difference in the efficiency of apoptosis inhibition could explain the observed discrepancy in the requirement for Bid and other host or viral modulators of apoptosis for efficient replication of reovirus. A second possibility is that a Bid function not related to its capacity to regulate apoptosis contributes to reovirus replication in the CNS.",

However, prior to our study, it was not known whether Bid modulates the pathogenesis of viral disease. The function of Bid in viral pathogenesis has been examined in a previous study, which found that the BH3-only protein, Puma, but not Bid, contributes to apoptosis-mediated elimination of antigen-specific T cells following acute infection with herpes simplex virus-1 [80] . Here, we demonstrate a pathogenic function for Bid in viral infection. Should Bid similarly modulate disease outcomes following infection by other virulent viruses, antiapoptotic compounds targeting Bid [81, 82, 83] may serve as useful antiviral therapeutics.",

Two-day-old mice were inoculated either perorally or intracranially with purified virus diluted in PBS. PO inoculations were delivered in a volume of 50 ml by passage of a polyethylene catheter 0.61 mm in diameter (BD) through the esophagus and into the stomach [90] . The inoculum contained 0.3% (vol/vol) green food coloring to allow the accuracy of delivery to be judged. IC inoculations were delivered to the left cerebral hemisphere in a volume of 5 ml using a Hamilton syringe and a 30-gauge needle (BD Biosciences) [91] . For analysis of viral virulence, mice were monitored for weight loss and symptoms of disease for 21 days. For survival experiments, mice were euthanized when found to be moribund (defined by rapid or shallow breathing, lethargy, or paralysis). For determination of viral titer and immunohistochemical staining, mice were euthanized at various intervals following inoculation and organs were resected. For analysis of virus growth, organs were collected into 1 ml of PBS and homogenized by freezing, thawing, and sonication. Viral titers in organ homogenates were determined by plaque assay using L929 cells [89] . For immunohistochemical staining, organs were fixed overnight in 10% formalin, followed by incubation in 70% ethanol. Fixed organs were embedded in paraffin, and 5-mm histological sections were prepared. Consecutive sections were stained with H&E for evaluation of histopathologic changes or processed for immunohistochemical detection of reovirus antigens or activated caspase-3 [11] .
