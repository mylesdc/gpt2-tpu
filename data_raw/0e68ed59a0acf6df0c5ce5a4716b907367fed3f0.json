The rat PSG family appears to have undergone less expansion than the mouse, exhibits lower divergence rates and increased sequence homogenisation in the CFG face of the N1 domain. In contrast to most primate PSG N domains, rodent PSG N1 domains do not contain an RGD tri-peptide motif, but do contain RGD-like sequences, which are not conserved in rodent N2 and N3 domains.",

Human PSG gene family expansion and homogenisation suggests that evolution occurred in a concerted manner that maintains similar functions of PSGs, whilst increasing gene dosage of the family as a whole. In the mouse, gene family expansion, coupled with local diversification of the CFG face, suggests selection both for increased gene dosage and diversification of function. Partial conservation of RGD and RGD-like tri-peptides in primate and rodent N and N1 domains, respectively, supports a role for these motifs in PSG function.",

Classical examples include the histone and ribosomal RNA genes. In such cases the expansion of gene families is driven by selection for high expression [2] . Concerted evolution is generally maintained by unequal crossover, intergenic gene conversion or other illegitimate recombination mechanisms [1, 2] . Conversely, there are multigene families whose members encode diverse functions e.g. genes encoding immunoglobulin (Ig), T cell receptor (TCR) and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins [1] . Such diversity occurs when there is less homogenisation than mutation, due to the evolution of specific programmed mutational mechanisms [3] . In addition, more complex modes exist; for example, the immunoglobulin heavy-chain variableregion (V H ) genes encode proteins with identical functions, but exhibit little concerted evolution [4] . Instead, their evolution is governed by divergence and a birth-anddeath process of gene duplication and dysfunctioning mutations [2] .",

            "text": "Similar to other families of highly expressed trophoblastspecific genes such as the pregnancy-associated glycoproteins (PAG) [5] , the pregnancy-specific glycoproteins, which are the most abundant foetal proteins in the maternal bloodstream during human late pregnancy, are encoded by multiple tandemly arrayed genes [6, 7] . The PSG family of glycoproteins, with the related CEA-related cell adhesion molecule (CEACAM) proteins, are part of the immunoglobulin superfamily [8] . The Ig domain structure of the human and mouse PSGs differs, as follows: Human PSGs contain one V-like Ig domain (N), C2like Ig domains (A and B) and relatively hydrophilic tails (C), with domain arrangements classified as type I (N-A1-A2-B2-C), type IIa (N-A1-B2-C), type IIb (N-A2-B2-C), type III (N-B2-C) and type IV (A1-B2-C) [9] . In contrast, mouse PSGs typically have three or more N domains followed by a single A domain [7, 10] . The common ancestor of rodent and primate PSGs and CEACAMs was probably similar to CEACAM1, which is the only CEA family member with an identical gene structure in the human, rat and mouse that encodes all types of extracellular domains present in CEACAM and PSG proteins. The time of initial gene duplication is estimated at 90 Myr [11] , approximately the time of rodent-primate divergence. The independent expansion of human and mouse PSG gene families occurred through further gene duplication and exon shuffling events [7, 12, 13] .",

These events can be interpreted in the context of evolutionary theories of parent-offspring and inter-sibling conflicts that promote transcriptional 'arms races' leading to high expression of trophoblast-specific genes that influence maternal investment in offspring [14, 15] . In one scenario, duplicated PSG genes are selected because they increase effective PSG dosage, thereby enhancing an effect on maternal investment in offspring. In this context, it is noteworthy that human PSG N domains contain putative integrin-binding 'RGD' motifs that are proposed to mediate cell interactions with the extracellular matrix [16, 17] and immune cells [18] . Such PSG-mediated functions could potentially influence trophoblast invasion or maternal immune cell function. However, not all human, and none of the mouse, PSGs contain an RGD motif [7] , suggesting that, if human RGD motifs are functionally significant, there has been diversification of function of some human, and all mouse, PSGs, relative to a putative RGD-containing ancestor. In the context of parent-offspring conflict, such divergence might reflect co-evolution of PSGs and their receptors, similar to the co-evolution of ligand / receptor pairs observed in host-pathogen interactions [19, 20] .",

Indeed, this domain is shared by all members of the extended CEA family, suggesting that it may contain important functional motifs. We sought to test this hypothesis with respect to PSG function, by analysing both full-length PSG sequences and selected domains of possible functional importance. Alignments of full-length 4-domain human and mouse PSG protein sequences were generated with ClustalX, followed by pairwise comparisons of all mouse sequences with all human sequences. Mean Dayhoff PAM250 log scores were calculated for each alignment position and grouped by domain. The scores within each of the four domains were then visualised using box and whisker plots (which show the median value, upper and lower quartiles plus range) (Fig. 1) . The N domains exhibited significantly higher scores (p < 0.001) than the other three domains, with positive scores indicating conservation. There was no evidence of interspecies conservation of the other domains, which is unsurprising given the known lack of orthology between human A1 / mouse N2, human A2 / mouse N3, and human B2 / mouse A domain pairs.",

Both BLAST and pattern matching methods retrieved the same rat PSG genes from different databases; therefore we considered our search to be exhaustive. All rat PSG genes were found to reside on contig NW_047556 and this was used for the prediction of remaining exons for each PSG gene based on BLAST generated alignments with mouse Psg gene sequences ( Table 1 ).

However, using split decomposition analysis, McLenachan et al. [22] , in their study of a subset of human PSGs, concluded that it is not possible to accurately determine branch points in an evolutionary tree of human PSGs. Split decomposition analysis identifies contradictory relationships within alignment data; for example, there may be a pattern grouping PSGX and PSGY together, and another pattern grouping PSGY and PSGZ together [23] . This information is normally approximated when drawing evolutionary trees, however split decomposition is a non-approximation method that permits the building of trees with support indicated for relationships based on all patterns in the data. Such analysis can therefore predict to a limited extent the occurrence of sequence homogenisation e.g. by gene conversion or positive selection.",

The human and baboon N sequences formed one distinct cluster, the mouse and rat N1 sequences formed a second, the mouse N2 domains formed a third and the mouse N3 domains formed a fourth. Of particular interest was the split between the ancestral N-type domain and the common ancestor of the N2 and N3 domains. The confidence of this split was 93% and demonstrates that the mouse N1 domains are more closely related to primate N domains than to the mouse N2 and N3 domains. A similar comparison of the entire set of mouse and human PSG domains confirmed that the interspecific N domain clustering is unique because the human PSG A1 and A2 domains segregated into distinct branches (sharing a common ancestor with the mouse A domains) and the B2 domains cluster on a distinct branch (Fig. 5 ).",

The CFG face of CEACAM N domains has been shown to interact with pathogens and mammalian proteins (Fig. 7B ). Within Box 1 and Box 2, there is considerable variation between mouse N1 domains, which is illustrated quantitatively using Dayhoff charts (Figs. 8 -10). Positive Dayhoff scores and generally low standard deviations indicate good conservation of mouse PSG N1 domains (Fig. 8) , and even stronger conservation of human PSG N domains (Fig. 9 ). The latter may be explained by homogenisation of human PSG gene sequences [22] . Dayhoff score analysis using comparisons of all mouse N1 domain versus all human N domain ClustalX aligned sequences gives an indication, at the amino acid level, of the general pattern of evolution of these domains since the rodent / primate divergence (Fig.  10) . Again, the majority of residues exhibit good conservation, and relatively little variability is observed between pair-wise comparisons particularly with regard to residues that are involved in protein folding.

The higher values for median d n /d s in the mN1 vs rN1 comparison appear to be the result of a tighter d s distribution as observed in Fig. 11A , with values not exceeding one substitution per synonymous site in any pairwise comparison.",

Nucleotide sequence alignments were generated using all mouse Psg N1 domain exons (based on protein alignments), and the nucleotides present in the three sections comprising the CFG face (Boxes 1, 2 & 3; Fig. 7A ) were separated from those comprising the ABED face. The two new sets of data were analysed individually to determine mean d n and d s values from pairwise comparisons of all sequences within each dataset (Fig. 12) . A plot of d n vs d s for the ABED face of the mouse N1, N2 and N3 domains (Fig. 12A ) demonstrates a distribution of pairwise-alignment data points which overwhelmingly lie below the line of equivalence. However, a similar plot generated from analysis of the CFG face has data points distributed approximately equally on both sides of the line of equivalence (Fig. 12B ). This is due predominately to a higher number of non-synonymous substitutions.

For comparative purposes, tri-groups were determined for tri-peptide motifs at fifty random positions within the alignment. The number of most commonly represented tri-groups at each position was expressed as a percentage of the number of aligned sequences, and the mean and standard deviation was determined to indicate the mean maximal tri-group representation for the 50 random alignment positions. The control value obtained was 67.6 \u00b1 22.9%; the value of 53% of 5-1-4 tri-groups at the RGD site therefore lies within the control range, albeit 14.6% below the mean Dayhoff PAM250 plot for ClustalX-aligned mouse N1 domain amino acid sequence comparisons value. However, a more revealing statistic is derived from aligning the mouse N1 domains with the mouse N2 and N3 domains (see additional file 2), compared to aligning the mouse N1 domains with the human N domains. In the former comparison (mouse N1 vs N2 and N3 domains) the most commonly represented tri-group is 4-2-5, with 27% representation.

However, inspection of mouse PSG N1 domain alignments, and scrutiny of corresponding Dayhoff scores, revealed regions of apparently poor conservation. These regions correspond to the CFG face within the N1 domain of CEACAM1. In the CEACAM family, the CFG face interacts with pathogens and mammalian proteins. Comparisons of d n /d s values obtained from the CFG and ABED faces of mouse N1, N2 and N3 domains confirmed that the CFG face has evolved more rapidly than the ABED face in all three domains. The greatest effect was observed in the N1 domain exon with a doubling of the d n /d s ratio in the CFG face compared with the ABED face. The d n /d s ratio of 1.1 suggests weak positive selection on the CFG face of the N1 domain. The increase in the d n /d s ratio appears to be mainly due to an increase in the d n value, indicative of diversification. The high d n /d s values for the CFG face in the N2 and N3 domains, which are not known to interact with ligands, could be due to a low contribution of these sequences to the structural integrity of the IgV-like domain.",

This observation, combined with the relatively smaller number of PSG genes identified in the rat (eight to date, compared to seventeen in the mouse) and the higher level of gene homogenisation implied by split decomposition analysis suggests that the rat PSG gene family has not expanded or diversified as extensively as the mouse. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that further rat PSG genes may yet be identified because there may be under-representation in the WGS database [26] . Notwithstanding this possibility, there has clearly been ongoing turnover of the PSG gene family in all of the lineages analysed, as there are no known human orthologues of rat and mouse PSGs, and only four potential orthologous relationships between known rat and mouse PSGs.",

Rodent PSG N1 domains do not have an RGD motif, but have a high frequency of the RGD-like motifs RGE, HGE and HAE on the CFG face. Under the null hypothesis that these motifs are unlikely to underpin structural integrity of the N1 domain and are therefore free of constraint, our analysis reveals evidence of unexpected conservation of RGD-like motifs in the N1 domain, which have been lost in the N2 and N3 domains. Given the high transition and transversion rates in the N1 domain and the fact that the mouse N1, N2 and N3 domains share a common ancestor after the divergence of the rodent / primate lineages, the conservation of RGD-like motifs exclusively in the N1 domain may have functional significance. We note that the RGE motif in the context of the POEM protein induced apoptosis of MC3T3-E1 cells in vitro [29] . We speculate that certain RGE or RGE-like motifs may elicit weak cell attachment, followed by apoptosis -a combination of properties, reminiscent of snake venom disintegrins [30, 31] , that could have important functional implications in the context of the extensive tissue remodelling that occurs during placentation [32] .",

In the context of parent-offspring conflict, the homogenisation of human PSG sequences is consistent with the theory that placental hormones encoded by multigene families are monofunctional and selected for high expression, possibly due to coevolution with physiologically conflicting maternal mechanisms [15] . However, the evidence for positive selection on the CFG face of the N1 domain implies divergent evolution of rodent PSGs. Allied to the evidence for functionality of putative integrin-interacting RGD-like motifs in rodents, a scenario can be envisaged whereby the different RGD-like motifs observed in human and baboon PSGs also suggest some degree of functional divergence in these species.",

Additionally, a search pattern was developed and used to interrogate the Rattus_norvegicus.RGSC3.1.nov.dna_rm.contig.fa.gz archive obtained from the Ensembl FTP resource [36] . The search pattern was derived manually from alignments of amino acid sequences from the N domain exon of all known mouse and rat PSGs (mouse PSG16-PSG32 and rat PSG36-PSG40) generated using the ClustalX 1.81 windows interface [37] . In PROSITE format [38] the search pattern used was S-x-R-E-x(5)-G-x(3)-[IL]-x(3)-T-x(2)Dx(3)-Y-x(17,18)-L-x-V. Analysis was performed essentially as described [39] , with the program modified to search for the selected pattern in peptides of fifty amino acids or greater derived from genomic DNA sequences translated in all six open reading frames. ClustalX alignments were produced using the complete open reading frames returned by the program combined with the N1 domains of rat PSG36-PSG40. The alignments were trimmed to include only N1 domain exon sequence and a Neighbour-Joining tree was generated using MEGA version 2.1 software [40] to aid the identification of the new sequences.",

To generate protein alignments for examination by eye, a Web based ClustalW utility was used [44] , otherwise protein sequences were aligned with the ClustalX using the default parameters. Nucleotide alignments were generated based on ClustalX protein alignments, such that where a single dash was placed in the amino acid alignment, three dashes were placed in the equivalent codon position in the nucleotide alignment. The nucleotide alignments were then analysed using Split-sTree version 4b [24] and software and NJ trees were generated from the data (with bootstrapping 1000 times to test the reliability of branches). Individual domains of the mouse PSGs were also analysed by the split decomposition method using the same software. During NJ or Splitstree tree-building, the Jukes-Cantor [45] correction for multiple hits was applied and positions with gaps were ignored.",

Conversely, tri-group 5-1-4 is 'RGD-like' in terms of the biochemical properties of the constituent amino acids. The number of sequences in the alignment containing each group code at a given position was determined. The most highly represented group code in the alignment at that position was used in the analysis.
