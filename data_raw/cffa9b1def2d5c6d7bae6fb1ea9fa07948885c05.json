We previously identified a fusion inhibitory peptide (HR2P-M2) targeting the MERS-CoV S2 protein HR1 domain and a highly potent neutralizing monoclonal antibody (m336) specific to the S1 spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD). However, m336 was found to have reduced efficacy against MERS-CoV strains with mutations in RBD, and HR2P-M2 showed low potency, thus limiting the clinical application of each when administered separately. However, we herein report that the combination of m336 and HR2P-M2 exhibited potent synergism in inhibiting MERS-CoV S protein-mediated cell-cell fusion and infection by MERS-CoV pseudoviruses with or without mutations in the RBD, resulting in the enhancement of antiviral activity in contrast to either one administered alone. Thus, this combinatorial strategy could be used in clinics for the urgent treatment of MERS-CoV-infected patients.",

By replacing amino acid residues at the i to i + 4 positions with a negatively charged amino acid (e.g., E) and a positively charged amino acid (e.g., K) in HR2P for introduction of intramolecular salt-bridges, the resultant peptide HR2P-M2 exhibited improved solubility, stability, and anti-MERS-CoV activity [5, 9] .

However, the future clinical application of m336 could be limited by its inability to neutralize MERS-CoV strains with mutations in RBD, like the mouse neutralizing mAb Mersmab1 with similar weakness [15, 16] .",

We found that these strains with mutations in RBD were significantly less sensitive than the wild-type strain to the neutralizing activity of m336, while the pseudoviruses with or without mutations showed equal sensitivity to the fusion inhibitory activity of HR2P-M2. Interestingly, when m336 was combined with HR2P-M2, a strong synergism emerged against MERS-CoV S-mediated cell-cell fusion and infection by pseudotyped MERS-CoV strains with or without mutations in RBD, suggesting that this combinational therapy could be further developed for clinical use to treat patients infected by the MERS-CoV strains with or without mutations in RBD.",

In the present study, the sensitivity of pseudotyped MERS-CoV strains with key mutations in RBD, as identified in some MERS-CoV mutants isolated during the 2012-2015 outbreaks [17] , including D509G, D510G, Q522H, and I529T, along with wild-type MERS-CoV, was compared between the inhibitory activity of HR2P-M2 peptide alone and m336 neutralizing mAb alone. As shown in Table 3 , the resistance of MERS-CoV mutants to the neutralizing activity of m336 is about 2-to 8-fold, whereas the pseudoviruses with or without mutations were equally sensitive to fusion inhibitory activity of HR2P-M2. This result suggested that use of mAb m336 alone is unable to control the infection by MERS-CoV strains with mutations in RBD. Table 3 .

We then tested their sensitivity to the inhibition of HR2P-M2 alone, m336 alone, and the HR2P-M2/m336 combination. As shown in Table 4 , combining m336 with HR2P-M2 exhibited strong synergism against infection by pseudotyped MERS-CoV strains with or without mutations in the RBD or HR1 domain with CI value less than 0.3 and potency enhancement in the range of 6-to 25-fold, suggesting that this combinational therapy has potential to be further developed for treatment of patients infected by different MERS-CoV strains, including those with resistance to RBD-specific neutralizing antibodies. Table 4 . Combination index and fold of enhancement for inhibiting MERS-CoV pseudoviruses with or without mutations in RBD in S1 subunit and HR1 in S2 subunit of MERS-CoV S protein by HR2P-M2 and m336. To determine whether the HR2P-M2/m336 combination could sustain its efficacy in vivo compared to HR2P-M2 or m336 alone, we tested the anti-MERS-CoV pseudovirus activity of the inhibitors in sera of mice treated with i.p. injection of HR2P-M2, m336, and the HR2P-M2/m336 combination, respectively. As shown in Figure 4 , the inhibitory activity detected in sera from mice treated with HR2P-M2 or m336 alone was significantly higher than that detected in sera from mice before inhibition of any inhibitor. On the other hand, the anti-MERS-CoV activity detected in sera from mice treated with the HR2P-M2/m336 combination was significantly more potent than that detected in sera of mice administered with HR2P-M2 or m336 alone. This result confirms that combining HR2P-M2 with m336 affords synergism against MERS-CoV S infection, both in vitro and in vivo. Note: The molar concentration ratio of HR2P-M2 and m336 in combination against wildtype virus, viruses with mutations in RBD, and those in HR1 is 10,000:1, 4500:1, and 10,000:1, respectively.",

            "text": "In this study, we compared the anti-MERS-CoV activity of HR2P-M2 alone and m336 alone with that of HR2P-M2/m336 in combination and found that the inhibitory activity of the HR2P-M2/m336 combination was significantly more potent than either one administered alone against MERS-CoV S protein-mediated cell-cell fusion and MERS-CoV pseudovirus infection, suggesting synergistic activity based on the dual mechanisms of action whereby HR2P-M2 targets the S2 subunit HR1 domain for inhibiting S2-mediated virus-cell or cell-cell fusion [5] and m336 targets the S1 subunit RBD for inhibiting virus-cell binding or virus attachment [10] . It has been well known that drug synergism can be expected when drugs that act by different mechanisms of action are mixed together [22] . While MERS-CoV pseudoviruses with mutations in RBD were resistant to the RBD-specific mAb m336, they were equally sensitive to HR1-targeting peptide HR2P-M2. Notably, however, the HR2P-M2/m336 combination exhibited strong synergistic antiviral activity against all pseudotyped MERS-CoV strains, including those with mutations in RBD of S protein, which are even resistant to an RBD-specific mouse mAb Mersmab1 [16] . We also demonstrated that sera from mice treated with the HR2P-M2/m336 combination revealed significant efficacy in inhibiting MERS-CoV pseudovirus infection compared to HR2P-M2 or m336 alone. Collectively, these results suggest that the combinatorial strategy overcomes the weaknesses of HR2P-M2 peptide and m336 mAb, while, at the same time, takes advantage of the unique mechanism of action of each to provide, by the sum of both, much more effective inhibitory activity against MERS-CoV infection than either peptide or mAb used alone. The strong synergy of the combination is expected to reduce the dosage of the individual inhibitor in such combinational therapy, resulting in decreased cost and toxicity, thus making the final product more affordable and safer. Therefore, this combinational therapy shows promise for further clinical development. ",
