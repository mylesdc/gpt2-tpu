Its nonstructural protein 11 (nsp11), with the nidoviral uridylate-specific endoribonuclease (NendoU) domain, is essential for PRRSV genome replication and it also contributes to host innate immunity suppression. However, the immunogenicity and immune structure of PRRSV nsp11 have not been well investigated yet. In this study, a monoclonal antibody (mAb), designated 3F9, that against nsp11 was generated. Subsequently, a series of partially overlapped fragments, covered the nsp11 40-223aa , were expressed to test the reactivity with mAb 3F9, and the 111 DCREY 115 was found to be the core unit of the B-cell epitope recognized by mAb 3F9. Further investigation indicated that both genotype 1 and genotype 2 PRRSV can be recognized by mAb 3F9, due to the 111 DCREY 115 is conserved in both genotype virus. Meanwhile, this epitope, localized at the surface of nsp11 in 3D structure, is confirmed to be able to induce humoral immune response in PRRSV infected pigs. These findings do not only provide an mAb tool to further investigate the function of nsp11, they also indicate the diagnostic potential for this epitope. et al.

            "text": "Nsp11 protein contains a highly conserved nidoviral uridylate-specific endoribonuclease (NendoU) domain unique for viruses in the order Nidovirales [17] . This domain resides in the C-terminal region of nsp11, showing a distant relationship with the XendoU family from Xenopus laevis [18] [19] [20] . The newly identified crystal structure suggests that the PRRSV nsp11 exists as an asymmetric dimmer [21] , which differs from the hexametric structure of coronaviruses nsp15 [22, 23] . Based on previous mutation analysis study on EAV, the NendoU should be required for genome replication and particularly on sgRNA synthesis [18] . As well, nsp11 plays an important role associated with the suppression of type I IFN induction [24] , the RNAi innate immune response [25] and the NLR family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3)-mediated productions of IL-1\u03b2 [26] . Together with nsp1\u03b2, nsp11 is also responsible for different expression level of TNF-\u03b1, induced by PRRSV strains with different pathogenicity [27] . However, the characterization of nsp11 immunogenicity remains unclear. Whether the nsp11 could induce humoral immune response in PRRSV infected pigs, or if there is any B-cell epitope on nsp11, are worth to investigate.",

This novel epitope was found to be conserved in both genotype strains, but not among other Arterivirus. The localization of this epitope on the surface of nsp11 makes it easy to induce immune responds during PRRSV infection. Therefore, B-cell epitope identification and characterizing the immunogenicity of PRRSV nsp11 does not only extend our understanding of the structure-function relationships and nonstructural protein induced immune response, it also indicates the potential possibility of applying nsp11 specific mAb for viral-host protein interaction research and diagnostic testing.
