Here, we investigated the efficacy of ChAdOx1 NiV B , a simian adenovirus-based vaccine encoding NiV glycoprotein (G) Bangladesh, in Syrian hamsters. Prime-only as well as prime-boost vaccination resulted in uniform protection against a lethal challenge with NiV Bangladesh: all animals survived challenge and we were unable to find infectious virus either in oral swabs, lung or brain tissue. Furthermore, no pathological lung damage was observed. A singledose of ChAdOx1 NiV B also prevented disease and lethality from heterologous challenge with NiV Malaysia. While we were unable to detect infectious virus in swabs or tissue of animals challenged with the heterologous strain, a very limited amount of viral RNA could be found in lung tissue by in situ hybridization. A single dose of ChAdOx1 NiV B also provided partial protection against Hendra virus and passive transfer of antibodies elicited by ChAd-Ox1 NiV B vaccination partially protected Syrian hamsters against NiV Bangladesh. From these data, we conclude that ChAdOx1 NiV B is a suitable candidate for further NiV vaccine pre-clinical development.",

The ChAdOx1 vector is a replication-deficient simian adenovirus vector which has been used to produce several vaccines which are now in clinical development. A common feature of these vaccines is their low reactogenicity, strong immunogenicity, and the absence of vector replication after immunization, an important safety feature. In pre-clinical studies a single dose of ChAdOx1 vectored vaccines has been shown to be protective against infection with Rift Valley Fever Virus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Zika virus [18] [19] [20] [21] . Large scale manufacturing has been performed for replicationdeficient adenoviral vectored vaccines for Ebola, with one vaccine now licensed and another in advanced clinical development [22, 23] . Further, a simple thermostabilization process allows for vaccine storage at ambient temperatures [24] , removing the need for a cold chain for storage and shipping. We now report on pre-clinical immunogenicity and efficacy testing of ChAd-Ox1 NiV B .",

The resulting expression cassette was inserted into the E1 locus of a genomic clone of ChAdOx1 using site-specific recombination [25] . The virus was rescued and propagated in T-REx-293 cells (Invitrogen). Purification was by CsCl gradient ultracentrifugation, and the virus was titered as previously described [26] .

Animals were challenged with a lethal dose of NiV Bangladesh (1000 LD 50 ) one day post passive transfer ( Fig 5A) . We were unable to detect neutralizing antibodies in serum obtained at D5 from four hamsters from each group. However, serum from animals treated with NiV antibodies was positive by ELISA against NiV G protein, albeit with a lower reciprocal titer than antibodies in serum obtained from single-dose vaccinated animals (Fig 5B) . One out of six animals treated with NiV antibodies succumbed to disease on D11. No weight loss was observed, however the animal showed severe neurological signs. None of the other NiV antibody-treated animals experienced weight loss or signs of disease. Four out of six animals treated with GFP antibodies succumbed to disease between D6 and D8. These animals showed weight loss and respiratory or neurological signs. The two surviving animals did not show any signs of disease throughout the experiment. One of these animals did not seroconvert as measured by ELISA against NiV F and G protein, and it was suspected this animal was not infected.

Having one vaccine that protects against both lineages of NiV virus would be the easiest and cheapest countermeasure. A singledose vaccination with ChAdOx1 NiV B , which is based on NiV Bangladesh, fully protected Syrian hamsters against lethal disease caused by NiV Malaysia. The G proteins of the NiV strains used in this study are 95.5% pairwise identical on the amino acid level, with 27 amino acid differences scattered throughout the protein.

Likewise, high levels of crossprotective antibodies were found in sera from HeV-infected individuals, whereas cross-protective antibodies were limited in NiV-infected individuals [48] . This might be caused by induction of a more robust and cross-reactive immune response by native HeV protein compared to NiV protein, as suggested by Bossart et al. [48] .",

It is therefore likely that prevention of HeV in horses will completely prevent human cases. Currently, a HeV vaccine (Equivac) is available for horses and fully protects against HeV [50] . Furthermore, the total number of human cases that contracted HeV is relatively low at 7 [13] . Thus, the requirement of a human vaccine for HeV is therefore less urgent than that of a NiV vaccine.",

Likewise, administration of a human neutralizing monoclonal antibody (m102.4) provided full protection against both HeV and NiV in multiple animal models [51, 52] . Administration of purified IgG obtained from ChAdOx1 NiV B vaccinated hamsters provided partial protection against NiV challenge. Furthermore, infectious virus could only be detected in the lungs of control animals and not in the lungs of vaccinated animals, and thus as in previous studies, ChAdOx1 NiV Belicited antibodies are able to provide protection against a lethal challenge with NiV. Although we were able to detect NiV G protein-specific antibodies in serum obtained from NiV antibody-treated animals, the reciprocal titer was much lower than that detected in serum from Syrian hamsters after a single dose of ChAdOx1 NiV B . It is possible that administering a higher dose of IgG would have led to uniform protection.",
