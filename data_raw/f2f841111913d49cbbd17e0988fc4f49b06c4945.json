We used [ 18 F]-FDG-PET/CT to investigate the host response developing in nonhuman primates after MERS-CoV exposure and applied kinetic modeling to monitor the influx rate constant (K i ) in responsive lymphoid tissue. Methods: Multiple [ 18 F]-FDG-PET and CT images were acquired on a PET/CT clinical scanner modified to operate in a biosafety level 4 environment prior to and up to 29 days after MERS-CoV aerosol exposure. Time activity curves of various lymphoid tissues were reconstructed to follow the [ 18 F]-FDG uptake for approximately 60 min (3,600 s). Image-derived input function was used to calculate K i for lymphoid tissues by Patlak plot. Results: Two-way repeated measures analysis of variance revealed alterations in K i that was associated with the time point (p < 0.001) after virus exposure and the location of lymphoid tissue (p = 0.0004). As revealed by a statistically significant interaction (p < 0.0001) between these two factors, the pattern of K i changes over time differed between three locations but not between subjects. A distinguished pattern of statistically significant elevation in K i was observed in mediastinal lymph nodes (LNs) that correlated to K i changes in axillary LNs. Changes in LNs K i were concurrent with elevations of monocytes in peripheral blood. Conclusions: [ 18 F]-FDG-PET is able to detect subtle changes in host immune response to contain a subclinical virus infection. Full quantitative analysis is the preferred approach rather than semiquantitative analysis using standardized uptake value for detection of the immune response to the virus.",

Nonhuman primates (NHPs), such as rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) or common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) inoculated with MERS-CoV via combined intratracheal, intranasal, oral, and ocular routes, develop transient respiratory disease with little or no viremia although lethal disease was observed in a small number of marmosets [1] [2] [3] [4] . 18 F-Fluorodeoxyglucose ([ 18 F]-FDG) PET/CT as a real-time noninvasive approach can be beneficial in providing biomarkers for host immune response and disease progression. [ 18 F]-FDG-PET/CT has been used to track host immune response during monkeypox virus and human immunodeficiency virus-1 infections [5] [6] [7] . As [ 18 F]-FDG uptake is increased in activated macrophages, lymphocytes, and granulocytes during inflammation, the immune response can be localized by PET imaging [8] . Tracking the host response noninvasively is especially useful when animal species studied is limited and/or expensive to obtain or when animals do not develop overt clinical signs of disease.",

Post hoc analysis by Bonferroni's multiple comparison test specified a statistically significant increase in K i in mediastinal LNs up to days +15 or +16 post-exposure compared with the K i values prior to virus challenge (adjusted p = 0.0152 on day +3 or +4, p < 0.0001 on days +5 or +6, +7 or +8, and +9 or +10, respectively, and p = 0.0004 on day +15 or +16). c, d Pearson product moment correlation between elevation in [ 18 F]-FDG uptake in mediastinal (c) and axillary (d) LNs and changes in blood monocyte fraction.

Systemic factors such as viral proteins or cytokines could be engaged in lymphoid tissue response [7, 18] . As monocytes are part of the immune response to virus infection (e.g., cytokine release, phagocytosis), correlation between an increase in monocyte fraction and [ 18 F]-FDG uptake in the LNs is not surprising.",

By definition, SUV represents the radioactivity concentration in the region of interest adjusted for the injected dose and the body weight. Therefore, the SUV is influenced by several parameters such as (1) body composition, (2) blood glucose concentration, and (3) time interval from [ 18 F]-FDG injection to image acquisition. As noted in TACs of bone marrow throughout the study and of mediastinal LNs on days 5-9 post-exposure, SUVs did not reach a plateau within 60 min (3600 s) after [ 18 F]-FDG injection. Thus, high metabolic activity of proliferating cells in bone marrow requires longer time for [ 18 F]-FDG to reach steady state in this tissue even under physiological conditions. As the LN biopsies have not been performed in the current study, future studies sampling the tissue from mediastinal LNs at peak response will be able to identify the specific cell type associated with increase in [ 18 F]-FDG uptake in the LNs. Notably, by applying kinetic modeling analysis, we were able to determine a steady state parameter that characterizes the system based on two processes: [ 18 F]-FDG delivery from the blood to the tissue of interest and the state of cell metabolic activity. As multiple time points from PET-acquired data are used in the kinetic modeling analysis, the accuracy of K i computation for small regions of interest is higher compared with SUVs even in the presence of high noise [16] . In this study, kinetic modeling increases the signal-to-noise ratio resulting in an improvement of the accuracy of measurement and method sensitivity over analysis with SUV. If the effect is mild, then a semiquantitative analysis by SUV will not be able to detect it.",

Doses given in previous studies were expressed as tissue culture infectious dose 50 % (TCID 50 ) and was given by a combination of intratracheal, ocular, oral, and intranasal routes [2, 3] or by intratracheal route only [4] . Nevertheless, as [ 18 F]-FDG-PET quantitated the host response to virus challenge while CT revealed no pathology on the images, the sensitivity of CT for detection of host response is lower than [ 18 F]-FDG-PET [20] . Similarly, results from a MERS-CoV exposure in rabbits demonstrated that MERS-CoV replicates in the lung tissue without the development of overt clinical signs [21] . As subclinical MERS-CoV infection has been reported more often in patients without comorbidities than in patients with comorbidities [22] [23] [24] , this animal model can be used to study the host response to MERS-CoV and to test the intervention strategies aimed at inhibition of MERS-CoV replication [21] . However, suppression of immune responses to MERS-CoV exposure in these animals may be needed to reflect the severity of MERS observed in the majority of patients.",
