They are able to infect humans as well as other animals, including cows, pigs, mice, and chickens, they generally cause respiratory infection, gastrointestinal, and neurological disorders of varying severity. Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) was the first coronavirus to be discovered, and is classed among the Gamma coronaviruses on the basis of antigenic and genetic relatedness [1] . It is a major poultry pathogen and is probably endemic in all chicken-raising regions; it has a severe impact on poultry production, causing heavy economic losses. All strains of IBV are capable of infecting a large range of epithelial surfaces of chickens, such as those of the trachea, kidney, oviduct and proventriculus [2] .",

Coronavirus infection may also cause inflammation, alter the immune and stress responses, and modify the coagulation pathways [3] . Such profound functional and morphological changes in host cells are associated with significant changes in the patterns of expression of host cell genes. Several studies have described changes in host gene expression associated with coronavirus infection, as documented by microarray technologies [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . But ultimately, protein expression and post-translational modification (PTM) determine virus replication. Furthermore, transcriptome analyses only provide a snapshot of gene expression patterns; they also suffer from several limitations, including inconsistencies with the levels of expression of the corresponding proteins as well as lacking the ability to provide information on PTM. Approaches that use proteomics are promising because they can circumvent some of the issues associated with transcriptomics approaches [10] . More recently, comparative proteomics analysis has emerged as a valuable tool for the establishment of the global host protein profile in response to virus infection. It has been used to study enveloped RNA viruses such as influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus (PIV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), SARS-CoV, and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . It provides invaluable information on the cellular signaling pathways involved in either the cellular response to viral infections, or the viral manipulation of cellular machinery to ensure their own survival. For IBV, to the best of our knowledge, only some recent studies have investigated the changes in the expression of cellular proteins during IBV infection in ex vivo or in ovo [19] [20] [21] . However, the in vivo infection model could yield more biologically relevant insights into pathogenesis.",

In addition, the dynamic transcriptional alterations of 12 selected proteins were analyzed by the real-time RT-PCR method. Simultaneously, western blot analysis confirmed the change in abundance of the heat shock proteins (HSP) beta-1, annexin A2, and annexin A5. The potential roles of some of these identified proteins are discussed in order to characterize their potential functional roles during IBV infection in vivo.

Furthermore, this difference in the pattern of change was induced predominantly in the early stages of the infection cycle, which suggests that critical events early in infection are likely to be of key importance in determining the fate of the host.

Determination, using genomics and proteomics, of the extent to which virus-host interaction is coronavirus-specific and organ-specific, will be of importance [14, 27] . Our previous study on the global profile of host protein alterations in response to IBV infection was focused on an in ovo infection model system [21] . In this study, we applied a comparative proteomics technical platform for the first time to explore the abundance changed protein in trachea and kidney tissues from chicken infected in vivo with the highly virulent ck/CH/LDL/97I P 5 strain of IBV and the embryo-passaged, attenuated ck/CH/ LDL/97I P 115 strain of IBV. Some identified proteins are likely to be important in the host response to virus infection, including cytoskeletal proteins, stress response proteins, and anti-oxidative proteins. Interestingly, the abundance of these proteins showed different change patterns with IBV strains differ in virulence, suggesting that some of these differences might be responsible for virulence, and consistent with our previous study which demonstrated the differences in pathology and virulence for these two different viruses [22, 28] . These results provide an overview of the proteome profile of the host in response to different virulent IBV infection in vivo.",

Some host cytoskeletal proteins have been reported as differentially altered by virus infection in quantitative proteomic studies [16] [17] [18] . Recently, study has revealed that several different cellular proteins involved in cell morphology and the cytoskeleton changed in abundance in IBV infected cells [19, 20] . IBV infection resulted in a number of changes to the nucleolus both in terms of gross morphology and protein content [29] . Our results presented a tendency that the abundance of several cytoskeletal proteins showed increased with the degree of virulence getting strong, which is possibly due to the collapse and dispersal of the cytoskeleton in the IBVinfected cells, as demonstrated by other viruses [30] . Vimentin is a major component of type III intermediate filaments that has been reported to be redistributed in cells around sites of virus replication and assembly during virus infection. For instance, infection with African swine fever virus (ASFV) can lead to the rearrangement of vimentin into a cage surrounding a virus factory, which may prevent movement of viral components into the cytoplasm and concentrate late structural proteins at sites of virus assembly [31] . Specifically, vimentin was observed to be increased in abundance in the cytoplasmic proteome of IBV-infected cells [19, 20] . In our study, the abundance of vimentin was increased more strongly in the highly virulent P 5 strain infected group, compared with the attenuated P 115 strain infected group at 21 dpi. Given that vimentin can confer rigidity to domains of the cytoplasm, the vimentin cage may provide a physical scaffold to facilitate the construction of the virus factory. The stronger induction of vimentin could be a result of the large replication capacity of the highly virulent IBV strain. Tropomyosin belongs to the family of actin-binding proteins that serve important functions in microfilament stabilization, regulation of microfilament branching, actin polymerization, and intracellular transport. The abundance of alpha-tropomyosin was found increased in IBV-infected cell [19, 20] . In our study, the abundance of alpha-tropomyosin was increased much more strongly with highly virulent IBV ck/CH/LDL/97I P 5 infection than with the attenuated P 115 strain, it is likely that it help to orchestrate virus assembly, release and efficient cell-to-cell spread, also may due to the different virulence between IBV ck/CH/ LDL/97I P 5 and P 115 strain. In addition, in our previous in ovo infection model [21] , the abundance of some cytoskeletal including alpha-tropomyosin was decreased in the IBV-infected embryonic tissues, this difference need to be further investigated.",

            "text": "In both our previous [21] and current study, the abundance of annexin A2 and annexin A5 were found to be changed upon IBV infection. Annexins are a family of conserved proteins characterized by their ability to bind and order charged phospholipids in membranes, often in response to elevated intracellular calcium. These family members are involved specifically in a diverse range of cellular functions both inside the cell and extracellularly [32] . Annexin A2 (ANXA2) can associate with actin filaments and mediates membrane trafficking and membrane-cytoskeletal interactions. It has been identified as an important host factor for several viruses and at different stages of their life cycle. ANXA2 is incorporated into cytomegalovirus and influenza virus particles, promotes the entry of virus, and plays a role in Human immunodeficiency virus -1 (HIV-1) assembly, Bluetongue virus (BTV) release, and hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] . Annexin A5 (ANXA5) is involved in various intra-and extracellular processes including signal transduction, anti-inflammatory processes, membrane trafficking, and ion channel activity [41] , it also acts to regulate blood coagulation, binding to and shielding exposed phospholipids and masking their pro-thrombotic properties [42] . The expression of ANXA2 and ANXA5 has been found to be altered during other IBV infection system [19, 20] . In this study, the abundance of ANXA2 showed weaker increase at early stages of infection with the highly virulent IBV ck/CH/ LDL/97I P 5 strain than with the attenuated P 115 strain. For ANXA5, the level of expression induced at 7 dpi with the highly virulent P 5 strain of IBV was greater than that induced by the attenuated P 115 strain. These trends were also validated by western blot analysis. Whether this difference between P 5 and P 115 infectioned groups is related with the virulence of IBV or various responses of the host cell deserves further study.",

Studies have reported that viral infections cause oxidative stress, which is associated with the activation of phagocytes and an increase in the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that play a positive modulatory role in immune activation, the inflammatory response, eradication of viral infections and immunity-induced cellular injury [44] . The expression of MnSOD was altered during infection with some viruses, such as porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, influenza A virus, and SARS-CoV [45] [46] [47] . The abundance of the anti-oxidative protein MnSOD was increased much significantly in highly virulent IBV ck/CH/LDL/97I P 5 infected group than the attenuated P 115 strain infected group. The much amplitude increased production of MnSOD during highly virulent strain infection can affect the host cell pro-/anti-oxidant balance, which probably results in more significant immune activation and a stress response induced by reactive oxygen species. It is important in the eradication of viral infections and immune-induced cellular injury.",

Western blot and real-time RT-PCR further confirmed this alteration. HSPB1 has different cytoprotective roles, including acting as a molecular chaperone, maintaining the normal function of cells through interaction with and stabilization of the cytoskeleton, regulation of translational initiation, modulation of inflammation, inhibition of apoptosis, stimulation of innate and adaptive immune responses, and responding to a wide variety of stressful stimuli [48] [49] [50] . It is probably involved in all phases of the viral life cycle, including cell entry, virion disassembly, viral genome transcription, replication and morphogenesis. The abundance of HSPB1 was observed to be increased in IBVinfected Vero cells using stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) [20] . IBV infection induces cell cycle arrest at both S and G2/M phases and caspase-dependent apoptosis at late stages of the viral infection cycle [51] [52] [53] . Results presented in our study were probably due to the highly virulent virus triggering a markedly more robust inflammation and stress response. It also suggests that many important, and probably different events in IBV pathogenesis and immunology, such as the stress response, inflammation, and apoptosis, occur early in infection, and that these events may contribute to development of an appropriate immune response and the outcome of viral infection. In our previous study [21] , the abundance of HSPB1 was found to be decreased after IBV infection in ovo. This difference in different infection model need to be further examined.",

Some proteins involved in cytoskeleton organization, stress response, and anti-oxidative stress, showed different change in abundance with IBV strains differing in virulence. While the roles of some identified alterations could be related to host antiviral response or pathogenic mechanisms, functional significance of other altered proteins remains unclear and needs further investigation. However, our findings provide proteome-related information on a large scale that should be useful in increasing our understanding of the pathogenic and immune mechanisms of IBV infection. In addition, they will also provide reference for similar research into other coronaviruses.",

Information on the primers is listed in Additional file 9. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Two micrograms of total RNA was reverse transcribed with 200 U M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and 500 ng Oligo(dT) 18 as the first strand primer in 20 \u03bcl reaction solution. Real-time RT-PCR was carried out using SYBR \u00ae Premix Ex Taq\u2122 II kit (Takara) on the LightCycler \u00ae 480 real-time PCR system (Roche) according to the following steps: 30 s at 95\u00b0C, 40 cycles of denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 10 s, and annealing and extension at 55\u00b0C for 45 s. Each sample was amplified in triplicate. Quantitative analysis of the data was performed using the 2 -\u0394\u0394Ct method [61] ; samples from the control group at 4 dpi were used as the calibrator (relative expression = 1), and the 18S ribosomal RNA gene was used as an internal reference gene.",
