            "text": "Pet owners frequently administer antimicrobials to their pets and therefore have an important role to play in promoting antimicrobial stewardship in veterinary medicine. However, best methods of educating pet owners about antimicrobial stewardship have yet to be defined. While visual materials such as brochures and posters are often used in health promotion campaigns, their effectiveness in veterinary medicine is unknown. The objective of this study was to determine whether pet owners noticed and retained the message of a poster with an antimicrobial stewardship message placed in veterinary clinic exam rooms. A total of 111 pet owners from five veterinary clinics (three general practices, two low-cost clinics) in the greater Philadelphia area participated in the study. Participants completed a survey asking whether they noticed the poster and if they could paraphrase its message. In a follow-up survey, an antibiotic knowledge score was calculated from answers to questions assessing their knowledge of the poster message. Baseline knowledge was assessed by asking participants to define antibiotic resistance. At the end of the study, veterinarians at participating clinics were interviewed about their experiences with the poster. Only 51 (46.4%) participants noticed the poster, and only 11 (9.9%) could partially or completely reproduce its message. No demographic or clinic-level factors were significantly associated with noticing the poster or recalling its message. Antibiotic knowledge scores were highly correlated (\u03c1 = 0.87, p < 0.001) with baseline knowledge and not affected by viewing the poster (p = 0.955). Veterinarians expressed skepticism that the poster was effective in conveying a message of judicious antibiotic use to clients and noted no difference in the frequency with which they discussed antibiotic resistance or felt pressured to prescribe antibiotics by their clients. Posters alone will likely have limited impact in conveying a message of judicious antibiotic use to pet owners. However, they might be useful as part of an active, multi-modal education strategy, especially if complemented by veterinarian actions.",

A tertiary care referral hospital was approached but declined to participate. A poster with an antimicrobial stewardship message related to upper respiratory infections in dogs and cats produced by the American Veterinary Medical Association was placed in every exam room of the clinics (16) . Specifically, the poster stated: \"Cough. Snort. Sniffle. Sneeze. Careful with antibiotics, please. You want your pet to feel better. Antibiotics may or may not be the answer. Antibiotics don't fight viruses, the most common cause of flu-like signs. What will? Good supportive care while your pet's immune system does its job. Find out when antibiotics work-and when they don't. Talk with your veterinarian.\" Veterinarians from the clinics were told that they could discuss the topic with pet owners if they brought it up, but that they did not otherwise need to do anything specific related to the poster. Upon checking out of their appointment (i.e., they no longer had access to the exam room), pet owners were provided with a postcard inviting them to participate in a study with a link and a QR code leading to an online survey. Amazon gift cards ($10 for the first 50 participants, $5 for subsequent participants) were offered as incentives for participating in the study. The posters remained in the clinics for a 6-month period (March-August). The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Pennsylvania.",

This second survey presented the participant with a series of questions related to statements from the poster (\"Antibiotics are only needed for treating infections in your pet caused by bacteria, \" \"Some bacterial infections in dogs and cats get better on their own, without antibiotics, \" and \"When antibiotics aren't needed, they won't help your pet, and the side effects could cause harm, \" Supplemental Document 1). Participants could answer \"True, \" \"False, \" or \"Don't know\" for these statements. A knowledge score was generated from these questions. One point was assigned for each correct true/false statement (i.e., an answer of \"True\"). To assess pet owners' background knowledge of antimicrobial resistance, the second survey also asked participants to define antibiotic resistance in their own words. A definition score was generated for the following components of the definition: (a) bacteria mentioned as the offending agents (1 point); (b) the drug is no longer effective in treating disease (1 point); (c) resistance is associated with antibiotic use (1 point), for a total possible of 3 points. Scores for the open-ended questions (e.g., paraphrasing of the message of the poster and definition of antibiotic resistance) were assigned by both authors independently. If there was disagreement between the authors, the average of the two scores was assigned. Kappa values were calculated to assess agreement between the two scorers. A Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated to determine the agreement between the knowledge score and the definition score.",

The stated goal of the AVMA posters was to \"help explain why your clients' animals don't need antibiotics for most ailments\" (16) . A presumed desired outcome of this poster and other posters with a similar message is to decrease the incidence of clients requesting antibiotics or increase pet owners' acceptance of a veterinarian's decision not to prescribe antibiotics when they are not necessary. The assumptions underlying such objectives are that clients do in fact pressure veterinarians to prescribe antibiotics, that they will see a poster and retain its message, and that this newly acquired information will change their behavior. However, it is very difficult to measure such an outcome. We did not have access to information on the number of antimicrobial prescriptions in participating clinics and we could not assess pet owners' propensity to request antibiotics. We therefore measured the actions that would occur \"upstream\" of a poster-induced change in behavior with regards to antibiotic prescribing-actual viewing of the poster and retention of its message. We also sought to determine whether people who noticed the poster were more likely to be able to correctly answer questions relating to its content. While we could not assess pet owners' baseline knowledge of or expectations for antibiotics prior to the first survey without alerting them to the message of the poster, we did use a proxy measure of baseline knowledge by asking them to define antibiotic resistance in their own words. Finally, we assessed whether veterinarians perceived a change in how frequently they discussed the topic of antimicrobial resistance with clients or felt pressured to prescribe antibiotics while the poster was up.",

The significant association between antibiotic knowledge and education on univariable analysis but not on multivariable analysis is likely due to the fact that we were underpowered to detect the true adjusted effect: because only 83 participants completed both surveys and provided a definition of antibiotic resistance, the sample size for the multivariable analysis was smaller than the sample size for the univariable analysis.",

Moreover, it is still questionable how widespread the undesirable behavior that the poster is presumably intended to address (pressuring veterinarians for antibiotics) is. In contrast to what was anecdotally reported by veterinarians in this study (i.e., that they are often pressured to prescribe antibiotics), other studies suggest that pressuring of veterinarians for antibiotics by pet owners occurs infrequently (3, 5) and that there is a dissonance between perceptions of veterinarians and pet owners with regard to expectations for antibiotics (5) , similar to that documented in pediatrics (8, 22) . Nevertheless, a poster could be useful in providing an inexpensive and simple vehicle for the passive absorption of a message of judicious antibiotic use, even if it only reaches 9% of pet owners. Moreover, one of the veterinarians reported finding the poster useful as a reminder to discuss the issue of judicious antibiotic use more frequently with her clients. Such visual material could therefore be useful under certain circumstances. However, because antimicrobial resistance tends to be a nebulous and future threat that is often discounted in the face of more immediate concerns (23), pet owners may not pay heed to such a message when concerned about their pets' health, and veterinarians might be reticent to cede valuable exam room wall \"real estate\" to such a poster. The skepticism expressed by all of the veterinary personnel in this study that the poster was effective underscores this possibility. Future studies are needed to investigate the best practices for veterinarians to initiate conversations with clients about antimicrobial resistance.",

The recommendations suggest that education is best combined with other approaches such as prospective audit and feedback of providers. Several studies have shown that multimodal approaches to patient/pet owner and clinician education can decrease antimicrobial prescribing (26) (27) (28) and improve patient (29) and pet owner (30) satisfaction.

            "text": "There were some limitations to the study. First, only a small number of participants from each clinic enrolled, despite the monetary incentive for participation, the simplicity of participation, and the lengthy time period during which the poster was in place. We do not know what proportion of pet owners visiting the clinics our numbers represent, as the participating clinics were either unable or unwilling to provide us with the total number of pet owners who visited their clinics during the study. We therefore do not know how representative the sample of study participants was. However, it is likely that the small sample size limits the generalizability of the results of the study, might have introduced selection bias, and might not accurately reflect the true number of people who saw the poster and retained its message. Second, we do not know the reasons why pet owners were at the clinic (e.g., sick visits vs. preventive care) or whether they were prescribed antibiotics during their visit, and pet owners may have been more or less likely to view the poster and retain its message based on these factors. Third, the use of true/false questions to assess a participant's knowledge of antibiotics after viewing the poster could result in artificially high scores if people guessed the answers correctly. Fourth, a participant's definition of antibiotic resistance might not be an accurate reflection of their \"background\" knowledge, especially if a person looked up the definition prior to answering the question. Fifth, the posters were up during the spring and summer (March-August), whereas respiratory disease in dogs and cats tends to occur in the fall and winter (31, 32) . Owners may therefore not have perceived the message of the poster as relevant and might have been less likely to remember it. Finally, we did not know how long pet owners waited to complete the survey after their visit. If the interval between the visit and completion of the survey was large, recall of the poster's message could have been affected. Future studies are needed to investigate other methods of presenting antimicrobial stewardship material to pet owners and to evaluate whether they can effect change in behavior.",

We suggest that posters might have some utility if they are a part of an active, multi-modal education campaign that could also involve, as suggested by the veterinarians in this study, brochures, educational stories, and video material (12, 34, 35) . Such a strategy is even more likely to be successful if it is coupled with stewardship actions conducted by the veterinarian (35) .",
