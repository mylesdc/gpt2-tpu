            "text": "Human papillomavirus (HPV) infections are particularly problematic for HIV + and solid organ transplant patients with compromised CD4+ T cell-dependent immunity as they produce more severe and progressive disease compared to healthy individuals. There are no specific treatments for chronic HPV infection, resulting in an urgent unmet need for a modality that is safe and effective for both immunocompromised and otherwise normal patients with recalcitrant disease. DNA vaccination is attractive because it avoids the risks of administration of live vectors to immunocompromised patients, and can induce potent HPV-specific cytotoxic T cell responses. We have developed a DNA vaccine (pNGVL4a-hCRTE6E7L2) encoding calreticulin (CRT) fused to E6, E7 and L2 proteins of HPV-16, the genotype associated with approximately 90% vaginal, vulvar, anal, penile and oropharyngeal HPV-associated cancers and the majority of cervical cancers. Administration of the DNA vaccine by intramuscular (IM) injection followed by electroporation induced significantly greater HPV-specific immune responses compared to IM injection alone or mixed with alum. Furthermore, pNGVL4a-hCRTE6E7L2 DNA vaccination via electroporation of mice carrying an intravaginal HPV-16 E6/E7-expressing syngeneic tumor demonstrated more potent therapeutic effects than IM vaccination alone. Of note, administration of the DNA vaccine by IM injection followed by electroporation elicited potent E6 and E7-specific CD8+ T cell responses and antitumor effects despite CD4+ T cell-depletion, although no antibody response was detected. While CD4+ T cell-depletion did reduce the E6 and E7-specific CD8+ T cell response, it remained sufficient to prevent subcutaneous tumor growth and to eliminate circulating tumor cells in a model of metastatic HPV-16+ cancer. Thus, the antibody response was CD4-dependent, whereas CD4+ T cell help enhanced the E6/E7-specific CD8+ T cell immunity, but was not required. Taken together, our data suggest that pNGVL4a-hCRTE6E7L2 DNA vaccination via electroporation warrants testing in otherwise healthy patients and those with compromised CD4+ T cell immunity to treat HPV-16-associated anogenital disease and cancer.",

            "text": "Of the over one hundred known Human papillomaviruses (HPVs), a dozen high risk types are associated with cancer. These oncogenic types infect the genital mucosa and are sexually transmitted. The oncogenic HPVs are the primary etiologic agents of cervical cancer and are also known to cause a subset of head and neck, vaginal, vulvar, anal and penile cancers [1] [2] [3] . HPV-16 is the most problematic type as it causes at least half of all cervical cancers and the great majority (approximately 90%) of the HPV-associated cancers at the other anogenital sites and oral cavity. HPV-associated diseases are a significant problem for HIV+ and otherwise immunocompromised patients who are less able to clear their HPV infections than healthy individuals. HPV-associated cancer incidence is significantly elevated at multiple sites in HIV + patients, notably cervical cancer, which has been designated an HIV-associated malignancy [4] , and anal cancer that is predominantly driven by HPV-16 [5] . In addition, HIV + patients more frequently acquire multi-type infections; many of which are infrequently seen in healthy individuals, and consequently are not targeted by the current HPV vaccines [6] . Furthermore, benign HPV disease is also more severe and intractable in HIV + and solid organ transplant patients [4] . There are no specific treatments for chronic HPV infection, and warts are typically treated with limited success by surgery, ablation via cryotherapy or non-specific immune modulators. Therefore, there remains an urgent need for a therapy to effectively treat chronic oncogenic HPV infection, particularly HPV-16, and associated diseases using an approach that is safe and effective even for immunocompromised patients [7] .",

DNA vaccines elicit cell-mediated and/or humoral immune responses and are considered safe even for immunocompromised individuals because they do not contain live pathogen [8] . Although intramuscular (IM) DNA injection has a low efficiency of host cell transduction and encoded antigen expression on its own, delivery is greatly enhanced with immediate electroporation at the injection site [9] . We have previously generated various therapeutic HPV DNA vaccines encoding HPV antigens and including various enhancement strategies such as targeting the antigen to the endosomal/lysosomal compartment [10] , as well as linkage to HSP70 [11] , to the extracellular domain of Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3-ligand [12] and to the translocation domain of a bacterial toxin [13] . In particular, we have found that linkage to the heat shock protein calreticulin (CRT) in DNA vaccines potently enhances the immune response to heterologous antigens [14] [15] [16] . Indeed, one of these DNA vaccines encoding CRT linked to HPV-16 E7 antigen (CRT/E7(detox)) has advanced to clinical trials. The CRT/E7(detox) DNA vaccine is currently being tested in Phase I clinical trials in patients with HPV-16+ head and neck cancer (NCT01493154) and in a trial in HPV-16+ grade 2/3 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (NCT00988559).",

            "text": "Although the clinical grade CRT/E7 (detox) DNA vaccine has been used in the clinic, it could be potentially improved by the fusion of additional HPV antigens. It has been shown that T cell-mediated immune responses against HPV E6 antigen are associated with a favorable clinical outcome, and may be immunodominant in some patients [17, 18] . Furthermore, humoral immune responses against the L2 capsid protein have been shown to provide broad protection against infection by a wide spectrum of HPV subtypes in animal models [19, 20] . Therefore, we developed a preventive and therapeutic HPV DNA vaccine encoding CRT linked to HPV-16 E6, E7 and L2 proteins (pNGVL4a-hCRTE6E7L2) [21] . The cross-protective effects of L2-specific neutralizing antibody have the potential to prevent the unusual HPV types and multi-type HPV infections seen in the HIV + population. Indeed, we previously found that vaccination with pNGVL4a-hCRTE6E7L2 DNA vaccine was capable of generating HPV neutralizing antibodies as well as control of HPV-16 E6/E7-expressing tumors in a preclinical model [21] . In contrast to patients, E6 is poorly immunogenic in the C57/BL6 mouse, but immunization with a DNA vaccine expressing E6 fused to CRT elicits therapeutic responses [15] . Taken together, the pNGVL4a-hCRTE6E7L2 DNA vaccine has promise for the treatment of HPV16-associated lesions as well as to generate a pan-HPV protective effect against new or re-infection. However, it is unclear whether the vaccine will be active in patients with compromised CD4+ T cell-dependent immunity who so urgently need such a treatment. In the current study, we test the immunogenicity and therapeutic effects of the pNGVL4a-hCRTE6E7L2 DNA vaccine against an E6/E7-expressing murine model of anogenital HPV-16+ cancer in both immunocompetent and immunosuppressed settings.",

C57BL/6 mice were vaccinated three times at two-week intervals with CRTE6E7L2 DNA at doses of 2 \u03bcg or 20 \u03bcg and either with or without alum ( Figure 1A ). The vaccines were administered intramuscularly with or without electroporation. Two weeks after the last vaccination, splenocytes and serum were collected from treated mice and analyzed by CD8+ T cell intracellular cytokine expression and HPV-16 fcPsV neutralization assays, respectively. As shown in Figure 1B and C, in general, IM administration of the CRTE6E7L2 DNA vaccine with electroporation was significantly better for generating HPV antigen-specific CD8+ T cells compared to IM administration of the DNA without electroporation. This was true for both E6 and E7, and was generally consistent between the low and high dose DNA vaccine groups. Furthermore, we observed that alum did not further enhance the generation of antigenspecific T cells elicited by IM injection of CRTE6E7L2 DNA vaccine with electroporation ( Figure 1B and C). In addition, as shown in Figure 1D , at a dose of 20 \u03bcg, vaccination with CRTE6E7L2 DNA with either alum or electroporation generates similar levels of HPV-specific antibodies, and CRTE6E7L2 DNA vaccine administration with the combination of alum and electroporation only generates a minimal increase in antibody levels compared to vaccination with either DNA with alum or DNA with electroporation. Overall, these data suggest that DNA vaccination followed by electroporation generates a superior HPV-specific immune response compared to IM injection alone or with alum.",

C57BL/6 mice were (6-12 mice/group) were challenged intravaginally with 2x10 4 TC-1 Luc cells. From day 7, mice were either left untreated or immunized with 10 \u03bcg/mouse of CRT/E6E7L2 DNA vaccine by intramuscular injection only or followed by electroporation. The mice were boosted twice with 3-day interval with the same regimen. (B) Tumor growth was followed every week by bioluminescence measurement (photons/sec/cm 2 ). (C) Survival of the mice was monitored every other day. even in mice depleted for CD4+ T cells, suggesting that this vaccine may still be active even in CD4-depleted/HIV+ hosts (Additional file 1: Figure S1 ). Given our intent to also target E6 and L2, we further examined whether the CRTE6E7L2 DNA vaccine was effective in the generation of HPV antigen-specific T cell-mediated immune response as well as antitumor effects against E6/E7-expressing tumors under conditions of CD4+ T cell depletion. Mice were depleted of CD4+ T cells by administration of anti-mouse CD4 antibody on the schedule shown in Figure 4A , including prior to administration of CRTE6E7L2 DNA vaccine. The efficiency of CD4+ T cell depletion was verified by peripheral blood CD4 staining followed by flow cytometry analysis. As shown in Figure 4B , CD4+ T cells were completely depleted by day 6 after the initiation of antibody depletion. We first characterized the generation of HPV antigen-specific immune response by CRTE6E7L2 DNA vaccine with or without CD4 depletion using ELISA. We found that CD4 depleted mice treated with CRTE6E7L2 DNA vaccine had essentially no E7-specific antibody responses compared to non-depleted mice ( Figure 4C ), further suggesting successful ongoing CD4+ T cell depletion. In contrast, as shown in Figure 4D , CD4-depleted mice treated with CRTE6E7L2 DNA vaccine generated significantly greater E7-specific CD8 + T cells among total CD8+ T cells compared to na\u00efve mice, although levels of E7-specific CD8+ T cells were lower than those in non-depleted mice. Nevertheless, the CRTE6E7L2 DNA vaccine conferred 100% protection against subcutaneous TC-1 tumor challenge in both CD4-depleted mice and non-depleted mice ( Figure 4E ). These data indicate that vaccination with CRTE6E7L2 DNA generated a potent HPV antigen-specific CD8+ T cell-mediated immune response, which translated into a protective antitumor effect in the absence of CD4+ T cells.",

Although the use of alum enhanced the HPV neutralizing antibody titers, it was no more effective than electroporation alone, and the combination did not yield a clear advantage. In addition, the use of alum failed to enhance the HPV-specific cellular immune responses elicited by IM vaccination. IM injection of CRTE6E7L2 week old female C57BL/6 mice (5 mice/group) were treated with 100 \u03bcg/mouse of anti-mouse CD4 deletion antibody (clone GK1.5) or PBS via intraperitoneal injection for 3 days and the depletion was maintained by weekly injection of the depletion antibody (100 \u03bcg/mouse). 5 days after the initiation of the depletion, mice were injected with 1 \u00d7 10 5 TC-1 cells intravenously. 3 days after TC-1 cell injection, mice were vaccinated with 20 \u03bcg/mouse of 4a-CRT/E6E7L2 DNA vaccine via intramuscular injection followed by electroporation.

Notably, we also observed these potent cell-mediated immune responses and antitumor effects in CD4-depleted tumorbearing mice.

We have previously shown that DNA vaccines encoding CRT linked to the target antigen are capable of generating high levels of antigenspecific CD8 + T cell responses as well as significant antitumor immunity [14, 15] [21] . CRT is a heat shock protein that associates with peptides delivered into the ER [22] as well as with MHC class I-\u03b22 microglobulin molecules to aid in antigen presentation [23] . Furthermore, CRT has been shown to bind with CD91 (also known as \u03b1 2 -macroglobulin receptor or low density lipoprotein-related protein), a cell surface receptor on antigen presenting cells [24] . Thus, CRT may be able to deliver the linked antigens to dendritic cells through their specific binding with CD91 to facilitate cross priming activities. Furthermore, CRT has been shown to activate dendritic cells (DCs) [25] .",

This is essential for the clinical translation of the CRTE6E7L2 DNA vaccine. Previously, it has been shown that mutation of E7 at position 24 and/or 26 disrupts the Rb binding site of E7 thus alleviating the concerns for the oncogenicity of E7 [26] and that mutation at position 91 destroys the single zinc finger in E7 [26] . This construct is being used in ongoing clinical studies. Additionally, mutation of E6 in positions that have been shown to destroy several key oncogenic functions, including the ability to bind p53, which prevent the E6 (detox) protein from immortalizing human epithelial cells [27, 28] , were included. We further deleted the PDZ protein-binding domain at the C-terminus of E6 (aa146-151) [29] as this is also critical for transformation. The DNA construct used in the current study includes HPV-16 E6 and E7 genes that contain the mutations described above, thus minimizing safety concerns for clinical translation.",

The gene gun enables delivered DNA to directly transfect keratinocytes and epidermal Langerhans cells (immature DCs). This stimulates DC maturation and migration to the local lymphoid tissue, where DCs prime T cells for HPV antigen-specific immune responses. DNA vaccine administration with electroporation increases the number of HPV DNAtransfected cells and enhances the magnitude of gene expression, while requiring less time to reach a maximal immune response compared to conventional intramuscular vaccine injection. The use of an electroporation device may be even more important in non-human primates and humans than mice [34] . Recent reports from clinical trials indicated that delivery of naked DNA vaccines with electroporation was capable of generating potent cellular as well as humoral immune responses against encoded HPV antigens [35] . Additionally, the CRT/E7 (detox) DNA vaccine, administered by IM injection and electroporation, is being tested in HPV-16-associated head and neck cancer patients (NCT01493154), as well as via intracervical injection or a gene gun like device (PMED) (NCT00988559).",
