[1] , [2] The importance of viral co-infections in the pathogenesis, severity or course of respiratory infections is not well established. The high sensitivity of molecular techniques raises questions about the clinical relevance of positive test results. The presence of a virus does not necessarily indicate causation of clinical symptoms or disease [3] . On the contrary, bacterial co-infection is usually associated with a more severe diseases course and worse prognosis, despite the precise interaction between bacteria and viruses is not always clear.",

Supplemental oxygen and / or mechanical ventilation requirement during admission were also recorded. Bacterial superinfection diagnosis was established according to the referring physician criteria, based on clinical data, inflammatory markers, and radiological findings, and/or appropriate cultures in sterile sites (e.g blood or cerebrospinal fluid).

We performed all the analysis using the R Software, Version 3.0.2 (www.rproject.org). General data were presented as means with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Different statistical models were used to assess the bivariate association between the variables depending on the dependent variable. The relationship between demographic and clinical variables with mono-infection and co-infection was analysed using simple logistic regression. A binary logistic model was used for the binary variables (co-infection status, oxygen requirements, respiratory support needed and PICU admission), linear model for continuous variables (Wood-Downes Score and GENVIP Score), negative binomial regression model for counted data (hospital stay length) and logistic multinomial model for the multinomial variable (respiratory distress status). Multiple regression models were considered using the significant risk factors obtained in the bivariate analysis and sex and age variables. In order to reduce the likelihood of false significant results due to too many statistical comparisons, the Bonferroni multiple test correction were considered. A \u03c72 test was performed to evaluate the correlation between bacterial superinfection and pneumococcal vaccine. Level of statistical significance was set at 0.05.",

PICU admission, disease severity according to different scales, need for respiratory support, and length of hospital stay followed a similar pattern in viral mono-versus co-infected children. Contrariwise, bacterial superinfection increased the severity of the disease course, while pneumococcal vaccination played a protective role. The detection of multiple coincident viruses in clinical settings is becoming more common since the introduction of molecular based multiplex tests, but the clinical significance of these findings remains unclear and seems to have no impact in disease severity [5] . Both an increase in disease severity in relation to dual infections [6] [7] [8] [9] and the absence of this association [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] have been reported. Richard et al. [8] found that co-infected children were almost three times more likely to be admitted to the PICU than those with single viral infections. Compared to our study Richard et al. developed a retrospective and monocentric study in which they only considered dual infections, infants and bronchiolitis.",

Common respiratory viral infections, such as influenza or respiratory syncytial virus have been linked to seasonal increases in Streptococcus pneumoniae disease [31] . The relationship between bacterial and viral infection is clouded by the low sensitivity of bacterial detection in sterile-site samples by traditional culture methods, and the reliance on non-specific clinical data for the for diagnosis of bacterial co-infection, including inflammatory markers, radiological findings and / or appropriate cultures, resulting in 30% of the cases in the GENDRES cohort and 55% in the UK cohort.

A reduced incidence of viral alveolar pneumonia has been previously reported after pneumococcal vaccination [31, 32] , although there was no demonstrable reduction in the number of confirmed pneumococcal infections. This is likely to reflect the limited sensitivity of culture-proven pneumococcal disease in pneumonia. The protective effect of pneumococcal vaccines found in our study might reinforce the importance of the paradigm of viral-penumococci interaction at nasopharynx level in the pathogenesis and clinical course of the disease [33] Current pneumococcal conjugate vaccines significantly decrease nasopharyngeal carriage of pneumococci [34] and thus reduces the possibility of this viral-pneumococci direct interaction.",
