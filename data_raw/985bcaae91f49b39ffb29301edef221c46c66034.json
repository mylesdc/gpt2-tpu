            "text": "The RIG-I like receptor pathway is stimulated during RNA virus infection by interaction between cytosolic RIG-I and viral RNA structures that contain short hairpin dsRNA and 59 triphosphate (59ppp) terminal structure. In the present study, an RNA agonist of RIG-I was synthesized in vitro and shown to stimulate RIG-I-dependent antiviral responses at concentrations in the picomolar range. In human lung epithelial A549 cells, 59pppRNA specifically stimulated multiple parameters of the innate antiviral response, including IRF3, IRF7 and STAT1 activation, and induction of inflammatory and interferon stimulated genes -hallmarks of a fully functional antiviral response. Evaluation of the magnitude and duration of gene expression by transcriptional profiling identified a robust, sustained and diversified antiviral and inflammatory response characterized by enhanced pathogen recognition and interferon (IFN) signaling. Bioinformatics analysis further identified a transcriptional signature uniquely induced by 59pppRNA, and not by IFNa-2b, that included a constellation of IRF7 and NF-kB target genes capable of mobilizing multiple arms of the innate and adaptive immune response. Treatment of primary PBMCs or lung epithelial A549 cells with 59pppRNA provided significant protection against a spectrum of RNA and DNA viruses. In C57Bl/6 mice, intravenous administration of 59pppRNA protected animals from a lethal challenge with H1N1 Influenza, reduced virus titers in mouse lungs and protected animals from virus-induced pneumonia. Strikingly, the RIG-I-specific transcriptional response afforded partial protection from influenza challenge, even in the absence of type I interferon signaling. This systems approach provides transcriptional, biochemical, and in vivo analysis of the antiviral efficacy of 59pppRNA and highlights the therapeutic potential associated with the use of RIG-I agonists as broad spectrum antiviral agents.",

Viruses are sensed by a subset of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that recognize evolutionarily conserved structures known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Classically, viral nucleic acids are the predominant PAMPs detected by these receptors during infection. These sensing steps contribute to the activation of signaling cascades that culminate in the early production of antiviral effector molecules, cytokines and chemokines responsible for the inhibition of viral replication and the induction of adaptive immune responses [2, [5] [6] [7] . In addition to the nucleic acid sensing by a subset of endosome-associated Toll-like receptors (TLR), viral RNA structures within the cytoplasm are recognized by members of the retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) family, including the three DExD/H box RNA helicases RIG-I, Mda5 and LGP-2 [2, 3, 5, [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] .",

In addition to its RNA sensing domain, RIG-I also possesses an effector caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD) that interacts with the mitochondrial adaptor MAVS, also known as VISA, IPS-1, Cardif [15, 16] . Viral RNA binding alters RIG-I conformation from an auto-inhibitory state to an open conformation exposing the CARD domain, resulting in the generation of an activated state characterized by ATP hydrolysis and ATP-driven translocation on RNA [17] [18] [19] . Activation of RIG-I also allows ubiquitination and/or binding to polyubiquitin. In recent studies, polyubiquitin binding has been shown to induce formation of RIG-I tetramers that activate downstream signaling by inducing the formation of prion-like fibrils composed of the MAVS adaptor [20] . MAVS then triggers the activation of IRF3 and NF-kB transcription proteins through the IKK-related serine kinases TBK1 and IKKe [10, [21] [22] [23] , leading to the primary activation of the antiviral program, involving production of type I interferons (IFNb and IFNa), as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines and antiviral factors [5, 24, 25] . A secondary response involving the induction of IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) is induced by the binding of IFN to its cognate receptor (IFNa/ bR), which triggers the JAK-STAT pathway to amplify the antiviral immune response [6, [26] [27] [28] [29] .",

            "text": "The nature of the ligand recognized by RIG-I has been the subject of intense study given that these PAMPs are the initial triggers of the antiviral immune response. In vitro synthesized RNA carrying an exposed 59 terminal triphosphate (59ppp) moiety was first identified as RIG-I agonists [30] [31] [32] . The 59ppp moiety is present at the end of viral and self RNA molecules generated by RNA polymerization; however, in eukaryotic cells, RNA processing in the nucleus cleaves the 59ppp end and the RNA is capped prior to release into the cytoplasm. This mechanism distinguishes viral 'non-self' 59pppRNA from cellular 'self' RNA, and renders it recognizable to the innate RIG-I sensor [30, 31, 33] . Further characterization of the RNA structure demonstrated that blunt base pairing at the 59 end of the RNA, with a minimum double strand (ds) length of 20 nucleotides was also important for RIG-I signaling [17, 33, 34] . Furthermore, short dsRNA (,300 bp) triggered RIG-I, whereas long dsRNA (.2000 bp) such as poly I:C and lacking 59ppp failed to trigger RIG-I, but was recognized by Mda5 [35] .",

Activation of natural host defense using interferon (IFN) therapy has proven an effective treatment of certain viral infections. As a distinct variation on this concept, we analyzed the capacity of small RNA molecules that mimic viral components to trigger the host antiviral response and to inhibit the replication of several pathogenic human viruses. Using gene expression profiling, we identified robust antiviral and inflammatory gene signatures after treatment with a 59-triphosphate containing RNA (59pppRNA), including an integrated set of genes that is not regulated by IFN treatment. Delivery of 59pppRNA into lung epithelial cells in vitro stimulated a strong antiviral immune response that inhibited the multiplication of several viruses. In a murine model of influenza infection, inoculation of the agonist protected animals from a lethal challenge of H1N1 influenza and inhibited virus replication in mouse lungs during the first 24-48 h after infection. This report highlights the therapeutic potential of naturally derived RIG-I agonists as potent stimulators of the innate antiviral response, with the capacity to block the replication of diverse human pathogenic viruses. 4 th and 10 th panel) was induced between 6 h and 8 h after agonist treatment. IFNb was detectable in cell culture supernatant as early as 6 h after 59pppRNA treatment with a substantial release (4000 pg/ml) that peaked at 12-24 h (Fig. 1D, top panel) . IFNa release was detected later at 12 h, and remained high thereafter (400 pg/ml) ( Figure 1D ). Thus 59pppRNA triggers a full antiviral response as demonstrated by the activation of transcription factors IRF3, IRF7 and NF-kB, release of interferons, JAK/STAT pathway activation and induction of ISGs. 59pppRNA induction of the antiviral response requires an intact RIG-I pathway To address whether 59pppRNA exclusively activated the RIG-I sensor, wild type mouse embryonic fibroblasts (wt MEF) and RIG-I2/2 MEF were co-transfected with 59pppRNA and type 1 IFN reporter constructs to measure promoter activity. 59pppRNA activated the IFNb promoter 60-fold and the IFNa promoter 450fold in wt MEF; promoter activity was dependent on RIG-I since these promoters were not stimulated in RIG-I2/2 MEF. As Figure 1 . 59pppRNA stimulates an antiviral and inflammatory response in lung epithelial A549 cells. (A) Schematic representation of VSV-derived 59pppRNA and gel analysis. The 59ppp-containing 67-mer RNA oligonucleotide is derived from the untranslated regions (UTRs) of VSV and the product of in vitro transcription runs as a single product degraded by RNase I. (B) 59pppRNA or a homologous control RNA lacking a 59triphosphate end was mixed with Lipofectamine RNAiMax and transfected at different RNA concentrations (0.1-500 ng/ml) into A549 cells. At 8 h post treatment, whole cell extracts (WCEs) were prepared, resolved by SDS-page and analyzed by immunoblotting for IRF3 pSer396, IRF3, ISG56, NOXA, cleaved caspase 3, PARP and b-actin. Results are from a representative experiment; all immunoblots are from the same samples. (C) A549 cells were transfected with 10 ng/ml 59pppRNA and WCEs were prepared at different times after transfection (0-48 h), subjected to SDS-PAGE and probed with antibodies for IRF3 pSer-396, IRF3, IRF7, STAT1 pTyr-701, STAT1, ISG56, RIG-I, IkBa pSer-32, IkBa and b-actin; all immunoblots are from the same samples. To detect IRF3 dimerization, WCEs were resolved by native-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting for IRF3.

Furthermore, induction of the IFN response was exclusively dependent on intact RIG-I signaling, since IFNb promoter activity was not decreased in Mda52/2, TLR32/2 or TLR72/2 MEFs ( Figure 2B ).

            "text": "To evaluate the breadth of the host intrinsic response resulting from RNA agonist stimulation of RIG-I, modulation of the transcriptome of A549 cells stimulated with 59pppRNA from 1 to 48 h was analysed by gene array using the Illumina platform. Figure 3A shows a waterfall plot of differentially expressed genes (DEG; selected based on fold change $62, p-value #0.001) after 59pppRNA stimulation. The number of genes up-regulated by 59pppRNA administration steadily increased with time, while the majority of down-regulation occurred at 24-48 h (Fig. 3A) . The heatmap presents DEG with emphasis on the most highly deregulated genes over time (Fig. 3B ). Canonical pathway analysis using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software identified IFN signaling, activation of IRFs by cytosolic PRRs, TNFR2 signaling and antigen presentation as the main up-regulated functional categories, while functions related to cell metabolism and cell cycle were down-regulated by RIG-I agonist treatment (Fig. 3C) . Subsequent kinetic analysis revealed that RIG-I agonist induced distinct temporal patterns of gene expression (Fig. 3D , S1 and S2A). For example, some genes were highly expressed early at 6-12 h, including IFNB1 and the IFNl family (IL29, IL-28A, IL28B), but the expression of these genes was not sustained throughout the time course and decreased at 24-48 h ( Fig. 3D ; lest panel). A second subset of genes associated with the antiviral response were induced early at 6-8 h, but expression was sustained and markedly augmented at 24-48 h, as exemplified by IFI family members, IRF7, and other ISGs ( Fig. 3D; middle panel) . A third subset of genes was induced primarily at later time points, as part of the secondary response to 59pppRNA treatment, and included HLA and CCL3 families ( Fig. 3D ; right panel). Representative genes from different subsets were validated by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (Fig. S1 ). Overall, 59pppRNA induced a robust bi-phasic transcriptional response, characterized by strong activation of antiviral and inflammatory gene signatures; the kinetics of the transcriptional profile mirrored the biochemical activation events detected in Figures 1.",

As expected, at 6 h ( Fig. 4A) , induction of antiviral and inflammatory response programs downstream of IRF, NF-kB, STAT signaling were identified ( Fig. 4A and S2B) ; expression of several cytokine and chemokine genes were also up-regulated. Concomitantly, genes related to Fos and TGF-b signaling, as well as hypoxic signaling via HIF-1a were down-regulated. At 24 h (Fig. 4B ), genes associated with pathogen recognition receptor signaling, the ubiquitin pathway, inflammation and apoptosis were also induced by RIG-I activation; interestingly, profiling of down-regulated genes identified functional clusters involved in cell cycle regulation, MYC signaling, and the heat shock response.",

To define gene uniquely induced by 59pppRNA, gene expression profiles of A549 cells stimulated with 59pppRNA or with IFNa-2b for 6 and 24 h were compared. The heatmap in Figure 5A displays the expression profile of genes differentially up-and down-regulated (fold change $2; p-value #0.001) by 59pppRNA and IFN (black and blue genes) or exclusively by 59pppRNA (red and green genes). Interestingly, 59pppRNA induced a significantly broader gene expression program compared to IFNa-2b, especially at 24 h. To determine whether differences in gene expression observed between 59pppRNA and IFNa-2b were due to suboptimal stimulation by IFNa-2b, higher concentrations of IFNa-2b within the range reported for in vitro applications were tested. Treatment with 59pppRNA at 10 ng/ml was equivalent to treatment with IFNa-2b at 100 IU/ml in terms of IFNa levels released into cell culture supernatant. Increasing the concentration of IFNa-2b to 1000 IU/ml corresponded to levels of IFNa that were 8-times greater than physiological secretion following 10 ng/ ml 59pppRNA treatment (2500 pg/ml vs 480 pg/ml; Fig. 5B ). Regardless of the amount of IFNa-2b used to activate cells, gene expression levels remained relatively unchanged ( Fig. 5A ; IFNa-2b 100 IU/ml vs 1000 IU/ml), indicating that IFNa-2b treatment was saturating.",

Some of the genes characteristically activated as part of the IFN signature and maximally induced by 59pppRNA are MX1, IFIT1, ISG15 (Fig. 5A , black portion). This comparison also highlighted the fact that a surprisingly large number of genes are uniquely regulated by 59pppRNA -38 genes at 6 h and 730 genes at 24 h (Fig. 5C ). Most notably, IFNB1 and all three members of the IFNl family, as well as the cytokines CCL5, CXCL10, IL-6, and CCL3, were highly induced by 59pppRNA but not IFNa-2b treatment ( Fig. 5A ; red genes). While IFN signaling was highly induced by both treatments, IFNa-2b strongly activated antigen presentation machinery, and 59pppRNA preferentially stimulated dendritic cell maturation and crosstalk, linking innate and adaptive immunity as well as induction of a wider range of signaling pathways (Fig. 5D ). Significantly, 59pppRNA preferentially stimulated a more extensive induction of IRF7 and NF-kB signaling nodes compared to IFNa-2b treatment (Fig. S2C) . Thus, 59pppRNA treatment, besides inducing a complete IFN response, additionally stimulated the transcription of a large and unique set of inflammatory and antiviral genes.",

All viruses established infection in untreated cells as assessed by flow cytometry (60%, 20% and 80%, respectively) but in 59pppRNA-treated cells, VSV and DENV infectivity was reduced to ,0.5%, while infection with vaccinia was reduced to 10% (Fig. 6A ). Release of infectious VSV and DENV virus was completely blocked by 59pppRNA treatment (1.7610 9 and 4.3610 6 PFU/mL in untreated cells, respectively vs. undetectable in treated cells; Fig. S3 ). Similarly, in primary human CD14+ monocytes, DENV infection decreased from 53.7% to 2.6% in the presence of 59pppRNA; in the CD142 fraction, DENV infectivity was lower (3%), but was likewise inhibited by RNA agonist treatment (0.4%; Fig. 6B ). To demonstrate the requirement for intracellular delivery of 59pppRNA, primary CD14+ cells from three patients were treated with 59pppRNA alone, transfection reagent alone or the combination; DENV infectivity was reduced from ,30% to ,0.5% only upon transfection of the RNA agonist (Fig. 6C) . To evaluate the antiviral effect of 59pppRNA against HIV infection, activated CD4+ T cells were pre-treated with supernatant isolated from 59pppRNA-treated monocytes and then infected with HIV-GFP. In the absence of treatment, 24% of the activated CD4+ T cells were actively infected by HIV as determined by GFP expression by flow cytometry, whereas infection of CD4+ T cells treated with 59pppRNA supernatants was reduced to 11% (Fig. 6D) . 59pppRNA also had an antiviral effect against HCV in hepatocellular carcinoma cell line Huh7; HCV NS3 expression was inhibited by 59pppRNA treatment (Fig. 6E ; lane 4 vs. 2 and 6). The antiviral effect was fully dependent on RIG-I, as demonstrated in Huh7.5 cells (that express a mutated inactive RIG-I) by the absence of IFIT1 up-regulation following 59pppRNA treatment ( Fig. 6E ; lane 9) and NS3 expression comparable to untreated HCV-infected cells (Fig. 6E ; lane 10 vs. 8 and 12). Thus, 59pppRNA is a broad-spectrum antiviral agent able to trigger an efficient innate immune response in different cell types and prevent infection by RNA and DNA viruses.",

Whereas all untreated, infected mice succumbed to infection by day 11, all 59pppRNA-treated mice fully recovered (100% survival) (Fig. 8A) . Overall, weight loss was similar between the two groups (Fig. 8B) , although a noticeable delay of 2-3 days in the onset of weight loss was observed in 59pppRNA-treated animals; treated mice then fully recovered within 12-14 days (Fig. 8B) . Influenza replication in the lungs was monitored by plaque assay over the course of infection with virus titers in the lungs of untreated mice reaching a maximum at day 3 post-infection (Fig. 8C) . A decrease in virus titer was noted by day 9 post-infection, possibly correlating with the onset of adaptive immunity, and all animals succumbed to influenza infection by day 11 (Fig. 8A) . Interestingly, 59pppRNA treatment inhibited influenza virus replication in the lungs early after infection, within the first 24-48 h (Fig. 8C; Day 1) ; by day 3, virus titers in the lung had increased, although influenza titers were still ,10-fold lower compared to titers in untreated mice ( Fig. 8C; Day 3) . By day 9, the 59pppRNA-treated animals had controlled the infection, as demonstrated by the decrease in viral titers. Continuous administration of 59pppRNA at 24 h intervals post-infection had an additive therapeutic effect that further delayed viral replication ( Fig. 8D; 3 versus 2 doses of 59pppRNA) , indicating that antiviral immunity may be sustained with repetitive administration of 59pppRNA. Furthermore, therapeutic administration of 59pppRNA also controlled influenza viral replication; although prophylactic treatment was most effective at blocking influenza dissemination in the lung, administration of the RNA agonist on day 1 and day 2 after influenza infection also reduced viral lung titers by ,10-fold (Fig. 8E) .",

In agreement, MAVS2/2 mice treated with 59pppRNA did not control influenza lung titers (5-fold increase vs. wt mice) and the titer was comparable to untreated wt mice (Fig. 8G) . To determine whether 59pppRNA treatment was sufficient to protect against influenza in the absence of IFN signaling, IFNa/bR2/2 mice were treated or not with 59pppRNA and challenged with influenza H1N1 virus. While untreated IFNa/bR2/2 animals succumbed to infection, 40% of the animals that received 59pppRNA treatment survived, suggesting that an IFN-independent effect of 59pppRNA functioned in the absence of the IFN response.

Influenza virus infection induced severe and extensive inflammation and oedema in the perivascular space and the bronchial lumen at day 3 post-infection. In animals receiving the RNA agonist, influenza triggered a mild and infrequent inflammation that did not extend to the bronchial lumen at day 3 post-infection. Epithelial degeneration and loss of tissue integrity were more severe in the lungs of untreated, infected animals and correlated with epithelial hyperplasia observed at later times, compared to the lungs of animals treated with 59pppRNA. Inflammation and epithelial damage progressed in untreated mice by day 8 (Fig. 9E) , and correlated with increased virus titer in the lungs (Fig. 8C) ; inflammation and epithelial damage was consistently less apparent in agonist-treated mice. Strikingly, the surface area of the lungs affected by pneumonia was significantly reduced in 59pppRNAtreated mice compared to non-treated mice -on day 3, 16% vs 35%; day 8, 41% vs 73% (Fig. 9C; bottom panel) . Overall, influenza-mediated pneumonia was less severe in animals administered 59pppRNA before influenza challenge, demonstrating that 59pppRNA possesses an antiviral effect in vivo that limits influenza replication in the lung, limits lung damage and prevents influenzamediated pneumonia and mortality.",

Intravenous administration of the 59pppRNA agonist in mice stimulated an antiviral state in vivo that protected animals from lethal influenza virus challenge and controlled influenza virusmediated pneumonia. Analysis of the dynamics of the host transcriptome following 59pppRNA stimulation was characterized by antiviral and inflammation related gene expression patterns with transcriptional nodes of genes regulated by IRF, NF-kB, and STAT families. Virtually all of the genes activated by IFNa-2b were encompassed within the 59pppRNA transcriptome; bioinformatics analysis also identified distinct gene patterns and functional processes that were uniquely induced or inhibited by 59pppRNA. Because of its potency both in vitro and in vivo, 59pppRNA represents a specific and powerful trigger of innate immunity and a novel approach to antiviral therapy.",

In parallel, we also observed an inhibition of genes involved in TGF-b signaling. Because of the immunosuppressive nature of the TGF-b pathway [42] , inhibition of this transcriptional node could further potentiate immune activation in response to 59pppRNA agonist.

The importance of genes uniquely induced by 59pppRNA is highlighted by the antiviral response that limited influenza infection in vitro and in vivo, even in the absence of functional type I IFN signaling. We speculate that the extended range of genes induced by 59pppRNA, compared to IFNa-2b, reflect the activation of multiple signaling pathways downstream of RIG-I/MAVS [10] , versus the morelimited transactivation potential of the IFN-regulated JAK-STAT axis [26] .",

IFNls have been increasingly implicated in antiviral therapies: 1) IFNl administration in mice stimulated expression of Mx1 and protected IFNaR2/2 mice from lethal influenza challenge [55] ; 2) IL29 blocked HIV-1 replication by inhibiting virus integration and posttranscriptional events [56] ; and 3) the combination of IL29 and IFNa or IL29 and IFNc enhanced the induction of antiviral genes and effectively inhibited HCV and VSV replication [57] . In addition, polymorphism in or near IFNl3 gene correlated with spontaneous or treatment-induced clearance of Hepatitis C infection and IFNl therapy is now actively investigated for the treatment of HCV [58] . Altogether these results indicate that specific induction of IFNl by 59pppRNA may contribute to immunity at the site of viral infection.",

This observation suggests that targeting an upstream viral sensor may provide activation as well as negative feed-back regulation to terminate the immune response and prevent uncontrolled inflammation; as such, this approach may offer an advantage over IFN therapy in terms of limiting potential toxic side-effects.",

Influenza infection generates a complex pathogenesis mediated in part by viral-and immune-mediated damage [63] ; therefore, the activation and recruitment of limited numbers of specific immune cell types, such as neutrophils, alveolar macrophages and dendritic cells may generate a beneficial antiviral microenvironment that additionally favor the initiation of adaptive immune response, which would eventually contribute to the in vivo efficacy of the agonist.",

Recently, a short RNA molecule with dual functionality was developed -a siRNA against influenza NP gene and an agonist of the RIG-I pathway [66] . This 59pppRNA inhibited influenza infection in vitro and in vivo, but the contribution of RIG-I activation to the inhibition of influenza was not demonstrated. The defective interfering RNA produced during Sendai virus life cycle is the best characterized natural RIG-I ligand and is known to induce strong inflammatory response [67] .

Interferon therapy has been used in the clinic for over two decades and has proven effective in the treatment of certain viral infections, mainly Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C [58] , as well as malignancies and autoimmune diseases [68, 69] . However, IFN therapy is also associated with significant side effects that limit its use [70] . PolyI:C, another dsRNA immune modulator, is also being tested in vitro and in vivo and has demonstrated efficacy against respiratory infections [71] [72] [73] . Along with antiviral drugs, vaccination is the primary approach to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with viral infection. Increasing the immunogenicity of vaccines with molecular adjuvants eliciting cytokines, co-stimulatory molecules, or immunomodulatory factors enhance the vaccineelicited immune responses. 59pppRNA has the advantage of mimicking viral recognition to trigger an immune response analogous to natural viral infection. Furthermore, the response stimulated by 59pppRNA was reminiscent of the integrated and multipotent response elicited early following immunization by the most protective vaccine identified so far, the yellow fever YD17 vaccine [74] . Therefore, an immune modulator such as a RIG-I agonist may not only function as an antiviral therapeutic, but may also serve as a vaccine adjuvant to increase the magnitude of the antiviral immune response elicited by vaccine epitopes. Thus, the present study not only demonstrated the prophylactic and therapeutic antiviral potential of 59pppRNA, but also opens the door to further investigation of the potential of RIG-I agonists as vaccine adjuvants.",

Briefly, 293T cells were transfected with 22.5 mg of pBR43IeG-nef+ plasmid by polyethylenimine precipitation. Media was replaced 14-16 h post-transfection, and viral supernatants were harvested 48 hrs later, cleared by low-speed centrifugation and filtered through a 0.45 mm low binding protein filter. High-titer viral stocks were prepared by concentrating viral supernatants 100-fold through filtration columns (Amicon), then aliquoted and stored at 280uC. Viral titers were determined by p24 level (ELISA) and TCID50; briefly, 10-fold serial dilutions of concentrated viral supernatants were used to infect PBMCs from two donors preactivated for 3 days with 10 mg/ml of PHA. Half of the media was replaced on day 4, and 7 days after infection, supernatants were harvested and processed for p24 by ELISA. The Reed-Muench method was used to calculate the TCID50.

Cells were collected and lysed for RNA extraction (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). Reverse transcription reactions were performed to obtain cDNAs which were hybridized to the Illumina Human HT-12 version 4 Expression BeadChip according to the manufacturer's instruction, and quantified using an Illumina iScan System. The data were collected with Illumina GenomeStudio software. First, arrays displaying unusually low median intensity, low variability, or low correlation relative to the bulk of the arrays were discarded from the rest of the analysis. Quantile normalization, followed by a log2 transformation using the Bioconductor package LIMMA was applied to process microarrays. To account for variability between batches, the data were adjusted using the ComBat procedure (http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxj037). Missing values were imputed with the R package (http://cran.r-project.org/web/ packages/impute/index.html). In order to identify differentially expressed genes between treated and controls (untreated) samples, the LIMMA package [86] from Bioconductor was used. For data mining and functional analyses, genes that satisfied a p-value (,0.001) with $2 fold change (up or down) were selected. Probes that do not map to annotated RefSeq genes and control probes were removed. The expected proportions of false positives (FDR) were estimated from the unadjusted p-value using the Benjamini and Hochberg method [87] . All network analysis was done with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA: Ingenuity systems, Redwood City, CA). The differentially expressed genes selected based on above criteria were mapped to the ingenuity pathway knowledge base with different colors (red: up-regulated; green: downregulated). The significance of the association between the dataset and the canonical pathway was measured in two ways: (1) A ratio of the number of genes from the dataset that map to the pathway divided by the total number of genes that map to the canonical pathway was displayed; (2) by over-representation analysis Fisher's exact test was used to calculate a p-value determining the probability that the association between the genes in the dataset and the canonical pathway is explained by chance alone. The pathways were ranked with 2log p-values. Microarray data have been deposited in the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus.",
