We aimed to decipher its function by infecting IL-33-deficient mice (IL-33 KO) and their wild-type (WT) littermates with pathogenic mouse hepatitis virus (L2-MHV3). The IL-33 KO mice were more sensitive to L2-MHV3 infection exhibiting higher levels of AST/ALT, higher tissue damage, significant weight loss, and earlier death. An increased depletion of B and T lymphocytes, NKT cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages was observed 48 h postinfection (PI) in IL-33 KO mice than that in WT mice. In contrast, a massive influx of neutrophils was observed in IL-33 KO mice at 48 h PI. A transcriptomic study of inflammatory and cell-signaling genes revealed the overexpression of IL-6, TNF\u03b1, and several chemokines involved in recruitment/activation of neutrophils (CXCL2, CXCL5, CCL2, and CCL6) at 72 h PI in IL-33 KO mice. However, the IFN\u03b3 was strongly induced in WT mice with less profound expression in IL-33 KO mice demonstrating that endogenous IL-33 regulated IFN\u03b3 expression during L2-MHV3 hepatitis.",

It is now described as a DAMP (damage-associated molecular patterns) or \"alarmin\" molecule that is normally restrained to the nuclear compartment where it could act as a nuclear factor-regulating gene expression [1] but is released in case of pathogen aggression or injury to alert the immune system [2, 3] . Once released from the cells, IL-33 mediates its function through interaction with its specific receptor a dimer of ST2 (IL-1 receptor-like 1) and IL-1RacP (IL-1 receptor accessory protein) [4] . IL-33 has been described to be constitutively expressed in cell-lining tissues like endothelial cells, epithelial cells, keratinocytes, and fibroblasts but could also be induced in other cells like hepatocytes [5] . IL-33 released into the extracellular space after cell damage could be active as a full-length form (~33 kDa), but proteases have been shown to regulate IL-33 activity. For instance, in case of apoptosis, caspases 3 and 7 cleaved IL-33 generating two biologically inactive form of IL-33 [6] , whereas during inflammation, neutrophil serine proteases, cathepsin G, and elastase were found to process IL-33 into mature forms of~20 kDa with increased biological activity (by 10-fold) [7] . The ST2 receptor is expressed in both innate and adaptive immune cells and is predominantly associated with type 2 immune response [4] . The ST2expressing cells, a target of IL-33, are macrophages, dendritic cells, mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, recently described nuocytes, or innate lymphoid cells such as ILC2 [8] , Th2 cells, but could also be transient on the surface of Th1 cells [9] and antiviral CD8 + T cells [10] .",

            "text": "The IL-33/ST2 axis has been described in various pathologies and affected organs, and it induced deleterious or protective effects [11, 12] depending upon the immune mediators and inflammatory milieu. In liver pathology, we and others reported increased level of serum IL-33 and ST2 not only in acute and chronic hepatic failure in humans but also in patients chronically affected with hepatitis C and hepatitis B viruses (HCV and HBV) in correlation with liver damage [13] [14] [15] [16] . Upregulated expression of IL-33 was reported in a murine model of T cell-mediated hepatitis mice infected with hepatotropic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) [10, 17] . In LCMV hepatitis, IL-33 induced hepatoprotective by promoting innate IFN\u03b3 production and modulating dendritic cells response, driving an antiviral CD8 + T cell response [10, 17] . In another mouse model of adenoviral hepatitis, the expression of IL-33 and ST2 was observed in the liver in the first week of infection, and it attenuated liver injury via an increase in a number of regulatory T cells (Treg) and decrease in a number of macrophages, dendritic cells, and NK cells in the liver [18] . However, there is a paucity of data regarding endogenous IL-33 deficiency on immunomodulatory effect in viral hepatitis. The present study investigated the role of IL-33 in the natural model of acute hepatitis in mice induced by specific mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV3). The hepatotropic and pathogenic MHV3 strain (L2-MHV3) induced severe fulminant hepatitis in mice and their death within 3-5 days postinfection [19] , mimicking a human viral hepatitis. We previously demonstrated L2-MHV3-induced overexpression of IL-33 in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, vascular endothelial cells, and hepatocytes [20] . Here, infecting wild-type (WT) and IL-33-deficient mice (IL-33 KO) with L2-MHV3, we showed that the alarmin IL-33 ameliorated the L2-MHV3-mediated liver injury through the regulation of IFN\u03b3 expression, survival effect on immune cells, and neutrophil infiltration in viral hepatitis.",

At basal level, the mRNA expression of CEA-CAM-1, the specific MHV3 attachment receptor in the liver, revealed that IL-33 KO control mice presented nonsignificantly decreased transcript level of CEACAM-1 compared to WT mice (Figure 3(b) ). The mRNA expression of innate immune receptors, that is, TLR2 and TLR3, the two TLRs described to sense the MHV3 in the liver, exhibited a significantly increased expression at 48 h PI and 72 h PI compared to PBS control in WT and IL-33 KO mice without any significant difference between them (Figures 3(b) and 3(c) ). Similarly, the transcript level of antiviral IFN-beta (IFN-\u03b2) increased exponentially following L2-MHV3-induced acute hepatitis (48 h and 72 h PI) compared to PBS control with a comparable expression in WT and IL-33 KO mice (Figure 3(e) ).

To delineate the role of IL-33 in the regulation of infiltrated cells during L2-MHV3 infection, we investigated the effect of IL-33 ablation on resident immune cells infiltration in the liver following L2-MHV3 infection by flow cytometry. The isolated infiltrate cells were gated to select single and complete cells; the live cells were then discriminated according to orange live-dead staining (Figure 4(a) ). After 72 h PI in WT mice or IL-33 KO mice liver, a large number of dead cells were observed (Figure 4 (a) right panel). The total number of infiltrate cells in the liver was not varied between WT and IL-33 KO control mice (Figure 4(b) , black spot for WT and empty plot for IL-33 KO). The total number of infiltrated cells in WT and IL-33 KO mice at 48 h and 72 h of L2-MHV3 PI was reduced compared to that in control mice (Figure 4(b) ). A significant decrease in a total number of infiltrating cells at 48 h PI was observed in IL-33 KO only with a recolonization of cells at 72 h PI (Figure 4(b) ). The deficiency of IL-33 led to decrease in number of liver-infiltrated B lymphocytes (CD19 + CD8 \u2212 ) (Figure 4 c)). An increased number of infiltrated neutrophils (CD11b + , GR1 + ) at 48 h PI were observed in an exacerbated and significant manner in IL-33 KO mice compared to WT mice ( Figure 5(a) ). This massive influx of neutrophils was confirmed by a strong Ly6G staining of accumulated infiltrated cells in the liver of IL-33 KO mice by immunohistochemistry (Figures 5(d) and 5(e) ).",

Here, we demonstrated the effect of endogenous IL-33 during L2-MHV3 infection in mice by using IL-33-deficient mice (IL-33 KO). We observed the protective effect of IL-33 in this acute hepatitis model demonstrated by increased liver injury, weight loss, and the earlier death of the IL-33 KO mice. These could not be explained by higher sensibility of the IL-33 KO mouse strain as the expression of the basic receptors described to be involved in the infectivity such as CEA-CAM [27] , TLR2 [22, 28] , and TLR3 [29] receptors were expressed at a comparable level in WT and IL-33 KO mice. A global decrease in liver infiltrate cell number was observed, especially for the immune cell populations of B lymphocytes, T lymphocytes, NKT cells, and macrophages in the WT mice but more importantly in the IL-33 KO mice following L2-MHV3 infection. This decreased immune cell infiltration could be explained by direct virus targeting (i.e., for B and T lymphocytes [30] or macrophages [19] ) either by the AICD (activation-induced cell death) for NKT cells or by the lack of survival/proliferation signal as shown for NKT cells which can be directly targeted by IL-33 to increase their number [31] . Interestingly, we observed a dramatic decrease in dendritic cell population at 48 h PI only in the IL-33 KO mice while their number remained stable in the WT mice. It is plausible that IL-33 is critical for dendritic cell proliferation as shown in a model of LCMV-induced hepatitis [17] .",

            "text": "In contrast, an increase in the number of neutrophils was observed in IL-33 KO mice after L2-MHV3 hepatitis. It was surprising as it has been shown that IL-33 can drive the priming and the migration of neutrophils in different models in vivo [32, 33] . These authors demonstrated that IL-33 could have, indeed, not only a direct effect on neutrophil recruitment but also an indirect effect by creating an in vivo Statistical analyses were done according to the Mann-Whitney U test. # represents significant difference with WT PBS condition, * represents significant difference between WT and IL-33 KO conditions, and $ represents significant difference between two conditions in the same background mice. # p < 0 05; ## p < 0 01; and ### p < 0 001. The mean expression of the WT PBS mice was used as a control and arbitrarily considered as 1 AU (arbitrary unit) which served as a reference for fold change in other conditions. Statistical analyses were done according to the Mann-Whitney U test. # represents significant difference with WT PBS mice, * represents significant difference between WT and IL-33 KO mice, and $ represents significant difference between two conditions in the same background mice. # p < 0 05; ## p < 0 01; and ### p < 0 001. inflammatory microenvironment that promotes neutrophil priming and recruitment. This was related particularly to the induction of TNF\u03b1, CXCL1, and CXCL2 expressions in in situ macrophages, fibroblast-like cells, or vessel endothelial cells. Despite the absence of IL-33 and macrophages, these cytokines were over induced by an alternative mechanism in L2-MHV3-infected IL-33 KO mice, in association with other neutrophil-related chemokines such as CXCL5, CCL2, and CCL6, which could be responsible for massive recruitment of neutrophils as observed at 48 h PI. At 72 h PI, we observed a complete disappearance of neutrophils in the liver whereas an enhanced expression of the neutrophilrelated chemokines was measured at RNA level in IL-33 KO mice. The fall in neutrophil number could be explained by the short lifespan of the neutrophils after their activation in vivo [34] . The over induction of CXC chemokines could be due to the absence of a negative feedback mechanism driven by CXCR2 expressed on myeloid cells, involved in the regulation of these chemokines' expression as it has been shown in a model of I/R or in CXCR2 KO mice [35, 36] . The ELR-positive CXC chemokines are the key to the pathophysiology of I/R injury, serving as primary chemoattractants that mediate neutrophil recruitment, resulting in subsequent neutrophil-dependent liver injury. In order to demonstrate the direct deleterious effect of this massive neutrophil recruitment in L2-MHV3-infected IL-33 KO mice, it would be interesting to test in vivo neutrophil depletion in this context. The transcriptomic profile of 284 genes involved in inflammation, cell signaling, and remodeling showed that the expression of IL-1 family members, IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-18, was not varied between WT and IL-33 KO mice following L2-MHV3 hepatitis. No difference was observed between the two mouse strains in the ability to drive rather a TH1 or TH2 immune response as the classical cytokines to do so (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, or IL-2) were not significantly induced at any time of infection. In the liver, IL-6 and TNF\u03b1 are pleiotropic cytokines having the ability to induce cellular responses such as proliferation, inducing hepatocyte multiplication, and liver regeneration but, on the other hand, mediate inflammatory and acute phase liver cell death responses [37, 38] . Here, we found enhanced expression of these cytokines in IL-33-deficient mice compared to those in WT mice. These findings suggest that the increased liver injury in IL-33 KO mice was related with higher expression of IL-6 and TNF\u03b1. These proinflammatory cytokines were previously described to be induced by MHV3 through TLR2 on macrophages [22] . As the number of liverinfiltrated macrophages was significantly decreased in IL-33 KO mice but in parallel upregulated TLR2 expression was found, it can be explained that the main source of these cytokines might not be macrophages but rather other immune cell population like T lymphocytes or neutrophils. The expression of IFN\u03b3 increased after the L2-MHV3 infection in WT mice, whereas less profound induction was observed in IL-33 KO mice. In concomitance, the direct link between IL-33 and IFN\u03b3 upregulation was demonstrated in vivo in viral liver injury model or in vitro studies [17, 31] . These previous studies pointed that IL-33 induced IFN\u03b3 production not only via iNKT/NK cells but also by \u03b3\u03b4T cells. The absence of IFN\u03b3 induction in IL-33 KO mice could be explained partially by the reduction of these cells in IL-33 KO mice during early infection at 48 h PI and reconstitution Statistical analyses were done according to the Mann-Whitney U test. # represents significant difference with WT PBS mice, * represents significant difference between WT and IL-33 KO mice, and $ represents significant difference between two conditions in the same background mice. # p < 0 05; ## p < 0 01; and ### p < 0 001.",

Nonetheless, the absence of IFN\u03b3 induction in IL-33 KO and the expressions of CXCL10 and CXCL11 were strongly upregulated during L2-MHV3 infection especially in IL-33 KO background at 72 h PI. We postulate therefore that the induction of these chemokines could be dependent on IFN\u03b2 in combination with TNF\u03b1 as it has been recently demonstrated in vitro [39] . The CXCL9, as the third member of this family, did not exhibit the same profile expression since it was significantly induced at 48 h PI in WT and IL-33 KO mice by a significant decrease in its expression at 72 h PI in IL-33 KO mice. This suggests that its expression might be more dependent on IFN\u03b3 than CXCL10 and CXCL11. The CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 exert their biological function by binding to their specific receptor CXCR3 present on activated T lymphocytes. The observation of decreased CXCR3 expression combined with the fall of lymphocyte number in the liver during hepatitis may explain that despite their induction in IL-33 KO context, these chemokines would not be able to interact with their target cells.",
