Two weeks after induction, bone marrow was harvested for evaluating the ability of adipogenic differentiation of marrow MSCs at both cellular and mRNA level involving adipogenesis-related gene peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma2 (PPAR\u03b32). The bilateral femora were dissected for examining marrow lipid deposition by quantifying fat cell number, fat cell size, lipid deposition area and ON lesions. For investigating association among adipogenesis, lipid deposition and perfusion function with regard to ON occurrence, the rabbits were divided into ON + (with at least one ON lesion) group and ON -(without ON lesion) group. For investigating association among adipogenesis, lipid deposition and perfusion function with regard to ON extension, the ON + rabbits were further divided into sub-single-lesion group (SON group: with one ON lesion) and sub-multiple-lesion group (MON group: with more than one ON lesion).",

However, there is a high failure rate in steroid-associated ON patients [4] . Prevention of ON is a very important strategy.

One of them is the theory of lipid deposition, i.e. the deposited marrow fat would compress on blood sinusoids to ischemia in compartmental bone: such as increased size of marrow fat cells, fat emboli and accumulation of lipid within the osteocytes [5, 6] . However, the relationship between above observation and the increase in lipid deposition remains unexplained. One possibility is that marrow lipid was a consequence of the adipogenesis of marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) [7] . Results of a previous study showed increased number of small size fat cells in the early steroid-associated ON, that might be derived from the adipogenic differentiation of MSCs [8] . The in vitro studies also showed elevated adipogenic differentiation ability of MSCs after steroid treatment [9, 10] . However, the relationship between the adipogenesis of marrow MSCs and steroid-associated ON remains unclear. The present study was designed specifically to compare the adipogenesis of MSCs between rabbits with ON and rabbits without ON, rabbits with single ON lesion and rabbits with multiple ON lesions using our established experimental model [11] .",

Briefly, rabbits were placed and fixed in supine position after anesthesia. Preliminary sagittal and oblique axial images were obtained to define the local longitudinal axis. The contrast-enhanced dynamic MR pulse sequence used previously established ultrafast T1weighted gradient-echo sequences (turbo-field echo; Philips). A total of 200 dynamic images were obtained in 90s. A bolus of dimeglumin gadopentetate (Magnevist; Schering, Berlin, Germany) (0.8 mmol/kg/body weight) was rapidly administered automatically via the right ear vein, immediately followed by normal saline flush. Signal intensity (SI) was then measured in the regions of interest (ROIs) over the target site beneath the joint space in the mid-coronal T1-weighted images. The signal intensity values derived from the ROIs were plotted against time as time-intensity curve (TIC) using the Gyroview software system (Philips). The baseline value (SIbase) of the SI in a TIC was calculated as the mean SI value in the first three images. The maximum SI (SImax) was defined as the peak enhancement value at a given time interval of 90s after contrast injection. Perfusion parameter was calculated namely: \"Maximum enhancement\". \"Maximum enhancement\" was defined as the maximum percentage increase (SImax-SIbase) in SI from baseline (SIbase). The perfusion parameter was calculated according to the following equation:",

The adipogenesis of MSCs, including the colony-forming unit of adipocytes was not compared between before and after steroid administration in this study. As clinical study showed core decompression would relieve ON development, marrow aspiration before steroid administration might affect ON development in the rabbit model.
