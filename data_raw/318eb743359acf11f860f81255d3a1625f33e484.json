New therapeutic strategies are therefore urgently needed. Cysteine proteases of P. falciparum represent attractive antiplasmodial drug targets due to their essential functions for the parasite erythrocytic cycle [4, 5, 6] . Among them are falcipain-2 and falcipain-3, which are located in the acidic food vacuole of the parasite, play a pivotal role in hemoglobin hydrolysis, and may also participate in erythrocyte rupture [5, 7] . Disruption of the hemoglobin degradation pathway is lethal for the parasite. Development of compounds targeting falcipain-2 and falcipain-3 is therefore currently a focus of research. A recent study has further shown that individual cysteine protease inhibitors significantly reduce microgametogenesis in P. falciparum, pointing to a potential role of these inhibitors for transmission blocking strategies [8] . So far several peptidic and peptidomimetic as well as non-peptidic cysteine protease inhibitors have been synthesized and tested against malaria parasites [9] [10] [11] [12] . In the present work a set of non-peptidic cysteine protease inhibitors derived from the loop diuretic etacrynic acid as a lead compound were evaluated for their potency to inhibit recombinantly expressed falcipain-2 and falcipain-3 [13] [14] [15] . Furthermore, activities against chloroquine-sensitive P. falciparum strain 3D7 and the chloroquine-resistant strain W2 were investigated. Several of these compounds have initially been tested against papain, the prototype cysteine protease of the CAC1 family, and against the SARS coronavirus main protease M pro , as described elsewhere [16, 17] .",

Further alkylation of the phenolic hydroxyl functions yielded amides 28, 30 -32, and esters 1, 9 and 29. Introduction of the double bond was performed either by Mannich reaction with TMDM ( 3, 6, 7) or by aldol condensation with formaldehyde ( 4, 8). The latter yielded the free acids 4 and 8 due to concurrent hydrolysis of the ester function. The free acids were coupled to various amides to give the amides 5, 10 -24. Amides 26 and 27 without activated double bond were also synthesized by standard amide coupling methods. ",

In addition, the high IC 50 value of >160 \u03bcM for compound 23 obtained from cytotoxicity assays using the human kidney epithelium cell-line 293T indicates selectivity against the parasite. These results provide basic information for the development of further non-peptidic irreversible cysteine protease inhibitors with etacrynic acid amides as lead compounds.

As a positive control the well-known cysteine protease inhibitor E-64 [7, 25, 26] and as a negative control the solvent (DMSO) was used. Dose-dependent effects of compounds on parasite development (P. falciparum strain W2) were quantified by flow cytometry according to a previously published method [27] . First, a screening with inhibitor concentrations of 100, 10 and 1 mM was performed and the percentage activity of infected red blood cells (RBCs) relative to the negative control was determined. Compounds showing concentration dependent inhibition in these assays were selected for determination of IC 50 values (Table 1) . Chloroquine [20] and E-64 were used as positive controls, and the solvent DMSO was used as a negative control. For selected compounds assays with the P. falciparum strain 3D7 were performed using a fluorometric assay with Hoechst-33258 [28] , or the microculture tetrazolium test measuring parasite lactate dehydrogenase activity [12, 29] . The parasites were cultivated in vitro as described previously [30] . Compounds were screened at concentrations between 1 nM and 100 \u03bcM. Synchronized ring stages were plated in 96-well plates at a parasitemia of 1%, in the presence of the compounds (dissolved in DMSO). Incubation of parasites with DMSO alone at a concentration of 0.5% v/v was used as a negative control. IC 50 values were calculated by non-linear regression analyses using the programs GaphPad \u00ae Prism 4 and GraFit \u00ae [31, 32] .",
