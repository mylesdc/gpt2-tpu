In its simplest form R 0 can be understood as the product of the infectious period, the number of infectious contacts and the per-contact transmission probability, which in the case of vectortransmitted diseases necessarily extend to the vector stages. As vectors do not usually recover from infection, they remain infectious for life, which places high significance on the vector's life expectancy. Current methods for estimating the R 0 for a vector-borne disease are mostly derived from compartmental modelling frameworks assuming constant vector mortality rates. We hypothesised that some of the assumptions underlying these models can lead to unrealistic high vector life expectancies with important repercussions for R 0 estimates.",

Control effort required to curb their continued spread or even prevent their establishment in the first place are partially determined by the disease's basic reproduction number, R 0 . Of particular importance for estimating R 0 is the duration at which the vector can transmit the disease, which is limited by its life expectancy. Many R 0 estimation methods are based on mathematical frameworks that assume constant vector mortality rates. Here we demonstrate how the resulting exponential distribution in life-expectancy can lead to significant over-estimations. By means of an individual-based model we elucidate the effect of vector mortality on R 0 estimates and derive a correction factor that alleviates some of the discrepancies due to erroneous vector age distributions. Our results clearly demonstrate the need to obtain more realistic, i.e. field-relevant vector mortality rates in order to generate robust estimates of a disease's reproduction number and provide guidance for setting-specific disease control.",

            "text": "Over the last few decades there has been a global rise in the emergence and re-emergence of vector-borne infectious diseases [1] . The continuing threat of Plasmodium falciparum malaria [2, 3] and dengue [4] , the rapid, near pandemic spread of Zika virus [5] or the recent epizootic outbreak of Yersinia pestis (plague) in Madagascar [6] are just some examples of pathogens transmitted by insect vectors that pose a major threat to global public health. Their dependence on insects for transmission between vertebrate hosts has a number of important implications. First, they are frequently subject to strong spatial and temporal fluctuations due to environmental and climatic variations, such as seasonality in rainfall or temperature. Second, these pathogens should be amenable to vector control. That is, disease transmission can, at least in theory, be interrupted simply by removing the insect vector (e.g. use of insecticides) or by preventing contact between the vector and the host (e.g. use of bednets). Furthermore, it has been suggested that only a fraction of insects need to be removed or vector-host contacts to be prevented for the disease to die out. This concept is largely based on mathematical theory that can be traced back to the first formal description and mathematical treatment of the malaria life-cycle by Ross [7] . Unfortunately, translating theoretical predictions to practical applications, especially with regards to disease elimination through vector control, has only resulted in partial success. The epidemiological reasoning behind the theory relies on a particular threshold condition involving the so-called basic reproduction number, R 0 , which denotes the expected number of secondary cases arising from a single infection in a totally susceptible population [8] . To date, R 0 is frequently used either to predict the extent of an epidemic outbreak or to derive the necessary conditions to prevent this outbreak from happening, e.g. by means of vaccination. The crux of the problem is how to robustly derive or estimate this number in the first place. Compartmentalised systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) have been in use for decades to understand infectious diseases at the population level and provide the backbone for most formulas for R 0 [9] . These allow the reproduction number to be computed either exclusively using empirically informed parameter estimates or from the initial growth rate of an outbreak [10] . Although the latter is the more common approximation method for directly-transmitted disease [11] [12] [13] [14] , it has equally been applied to vector-borne pathogens [15] [16] [17] .",

For example, reported R 0 estimates for the complete transmission cycle of Plasmodium falciparum in Africa range from 1 to more than 3,000 [18, 19] . Based on nine epidemics in Brazil between 1996 and 2003, the reproduction number for dengue has been estimated to be somewhere between 2 to 103 [20] , and median estimates for Zika range between 2.6-4.8 in French Polynesia [21] and 4-9 in Rio de Janiero [22] . The reasons for such wide variations are manifold. As mentioned earlier, the dependence on insect vectors for transmission can naturally introduce large spatio-temporal heterogeneities. That is, a disease introduced during the dry season will behave very differently to the same disease being introduced during the rainy seasons. Equally, an outbreak in a densely populated urban area will likely take a different course than an outbreak in a sparsely populated rural area. Here we argue that in addition to these natural variations and potential differences in data collection and analyses, the actual methodologies used to derive R 0 estimates can also introduce substantial discrepancies.",

As infectious vectors are assumed to continue to transmit the disease until death, the VHTP is determined both by the life expectancy of the vector and the extrinsic incubation period of the pathogen. For mathematical simplicity, most epidemiological models of vector-borne diseases assume that vectors have a constant (daily) mortality rate. However, this assumption is in stark contrast to findings from lab-based and field mark-andrecapture studies. For example, survival probabilities of the dengue mosquito vector Aedes aegypti and the principal malaria vectors Anopheles stephensi and An. gambia have been shown to be strongly age-dependent [24] [25] [26] [27] . Although it should be clear that current lab and field-based studies of vector survivorship come with their own set of limitations and uncertainties, constant, i.e. age-independent mortality rates are biologically less likely than assuming a general decrease in the survival probability with age.",

Here we compared a commonly used R 0 formula based on continuous-time differential equation model using constant mortality rates to an R 0 estimate derived from first principles under relaxed assumptions about vector mortality. Using a stochastic, individual-based simulation model (IBM), which permits the direct measurement of the average number of secondary cases, we demonstrate how the underlying assumptions of vector survivorship can significantly inflate R 0 estimates.

We employed a spatially-explicit IBM (motivated by the one previously proposed by [29] ), which, similarly to the ODE approach, assumes that individual hosts are either susceptible (S H ), exposed (E H ), infectious (I H ), or recovered (R H ). Individual vectors are equally set to be either susceptible (S V ), exposed (E V ) or infectious (I V ), in which state they remain until death.

The small discrepancy between the two models is due to the ODE model's assumption of an exponentially distributed extrinsic incubation period, whereas the IBM assumes this to be a fixed length of time. Using the IBM approach to track individual mosquitoes and infection events we also find that under this assumption the mean age at which vectors become infected is 20 days and infectious at an age of 25 days, i.e. days beyond their average life-expectancy. Furthermore, those vectors that have become infectious live for an average of 46 days, which means that their infectious period is 21 days (equal to the life expectancy of all vectors). This clearly highlights the discrepancy between model outputs based on constant mortality rates and biological reality. In contrast, assuming age-dependent mortality rates (Weibull shape parameter, c V = 4) results in biologically more reasonable infectious periods of 11 days (Table 2 ) and R 0 estimates that are less than half of those based on a model with constant mortality.",

One of the most important factors influencing R 0 is the length at which an individual remains infectious. For vector-transmitted diseases this places huge significance on vector mortality rates as vectors usually do not clear an infection and instead remain infectious for life. Many formulas to estimate R 0 are based on systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which commonly assume that vector mortality is constant, i.e. independent of age. As we have demonstrated here, the resulting exponential distribution and the effective resetting of life expectancies as individuals transition through the infection stages permit some vectors to live for an extraordinary length of time. As a result, vectors are potentially able to transmit the disease multiple times that of what should biologically be possible, leading to significantly inflated R 0 estimates.",

Because individual infection events can easily be tracked within an IBM, the basic reproduction number can essentially be measured simply by counting the number of secondary infections arising from a single index case.

Importantly, it is not so much that the formulas commonly used to estimate R 0 are inherently wrong but rather that the underlying assumption of the models from which they are derived are not necessarily aligned with biological reality. We found that one of the most robust methods to estimate a pathogen's R 0 is based on the proportion of susceptible individuals at endemic equilibrium, as this is entirely parameter free and does not require any assumption about vector death rates. Unfortunately, this only works for diseases that are well established in a population, and its reliability is strongly dependent on the stochasticity of the underlying endemic equilibrium, i.e. the (multi-annual) variations around the mean. For emerging diseases this is obviously not practical and estimation methods in those cases usually make use of epidemic growth curves instead. However, these also implicitly assume exponential vector age profiles and are therefore subject to inflation. In order to account for this we have here derived a correction factor that can be applied to classical R 0 estimation formulas and which adjusts for most of the discrepancy between the vector-to-human transmission period (VHTP) of the biological system and the assumed system with constant vector mortality.",

However, these methods can still suffer from the same issues as simpler ODE models, where transition rates between life and infection stages are usually exponentially distributed and where information about individual ages is lost at every transition stage. The ease at which different distributions that govern host and vector mortality, infection recovery and other epidemiological factors can be incorporated, make IBM frameworks the natural choice to examine the influence of vector mortality or other such factors on R 0 estimations. Here we only concentrated on the effect of vector mortality, whereas similar arguments are equally valid for the distribution underlying the extrinsic incubation period [34] , for example.

That is, in around a third of the simulations we observed no secondary case at all despite starting off with the same initial conditions. This then begs the question whether these events should be counted towards the estimated R 0 or not, as in reality we never observe such failed introductions. Comparing the expected with the observed R 0 value would suggest that zero cases should be counted, which on the other hand implies that even high values of the reproduction number are by no means a guarantee that an outbreak should ensue if a disease gets introduced in a fully susceptible population (sufficient conditions to prevent stochastic fade-out at the start of an epidemic have been previously discussed [35] ). The high variation also suggests that control strategies based on R 0 estimates generated from initial growth rates should be treated with caution and that estimations based on one particular setting might not be adequate to generalize and predict pathogen behaviour across all other spatial contexts [36] .",

The original Ross-MacDonald model for the spread of Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax malaria assumed constant vector mortality as laboratory and field studies seemed to suggest that death rates were age independent [42] . However, re-analysis of laboratory data showed that mosquito mortality is in fact age-dependent for several Anopholes species [43] . More recent studies also confirmed that mosquito mortality is dependent on age for Anopheles mosquitoes [27] and Aedes aegypti [24, 25] . What is clear is that more work needs to be done to fully elucidate realistic, i.e. field-relevant vector mortality rates, perhaps with more accurate spectroscopic methods [44] , as well as their environmental drivers. That is, seasonal variations in temperature and rainfall have been shown to affect the birth and death rate of vectors [45] [46] [47] [48] , the vectorial competence [49] as well as the extrinsic incubation period [50] [51] [52] [53] . It has also been emphasized that other spatio-temporal heterogeneities, such as community structures and host and vector movement, should be considered when assessing R 0 [54, 55] . All this needs to be factored in if we are to develop better models to understand the epidemiological and ecological determinants of vector-borne diseases, guide outbreak prevention strategies or monitor ongoing intervention measures. Vector mortality shape parameter c V . Increasing the shape of the vector mortality distribution from constant to age-dependent survival rates shows that traditional theoretical approaches to R 0 significantly overestimate the reproduction number R IBM 0 . Both estimates from the endemic equilibrium and post-correction initial growth rate continue to be robust over this range of shape parameters. (B) Vector mortality scale parameter d V . Both theoretical calculations scale linearly with the vector mortality scaling parameter, as this directly influences vector life expectancy and thus the vector-tohuman transmission period (VHTP). Across all tested parameters, both estimates from the endemic equilibrium and post-correction initial growth rate continue to be reliable for R 0 > 1. (C) Number of communities in the lattice |C|. The theoretical calculations of R 0 presented do not explicitly contain any spatial dynamics. Increasing the number of communities (starting with a homogeneous mixing model) does not affect the robustness of R 0 estimates. (D) External infection rate \u03b9. The theoretical calculations of R 0 presented do not explicitly contain the external infection rate. Increasing the external infection rate, does not influence the robustness of R 0 estimates from the initial growth rate unless external infection rates are high enough to start driving the epidemiological dynamics. Furthermore, R 0 estimates from the endemic equilibrium continue to be reliable until re-introduction of the disease into the system is too low for disease persistence. For each parameter value tested, 50 stochastic simulations were executed and R 0 estimated for each simulation. The dashed vertical lines represents the baseline values selected. (TIFF)",
