These oscillations, known as heart rate variability (HRV), are mainly mediated by the autonomic nervous system via parasympathetic and sympathetic innervations. Analysis of HRV has been suggested to reveal subtle patterns of heart rate dynamics that are relevant to the underlying physiological state and autonomic nervous system function [1] . Prior studies have shown that HRV measures are highly heritable traits that can be used to support genetic association and linkage studies [2, 3, 4, 5] . Family and twin studies have shown a significant genetic influence on a variety of HRV measures [6, 7] . Genetic polymorphisms related to cardiovascular functions have been associated with altered HRV [8, 9, 10, 11] . Recently, we have also made progress in identifying variations in two genes related to neuropsychiatric function that are associated with altered heart rate dynamics in samples of healthy adult and elderly subjects: those encoding brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) [12] and apolipoprotein E [13] , respectively.",

Specifically, heart rate dynamics is a phenotypic ''expression'' of the autonomic nervous system, so comparing similar heart rate oscillation phenotypes among individuals may reveal a global profile of autonomic function relevant to genetic variants. With these considerations in mind, in the present study, we introduce a bottom-up genotype-phenotype analysis to investigate the association between genetic polymorphisms and autonomic control of heart rate dynamics, using three common polymorphisms in genes encoding b-adrenergic receptor (b-AR) as an example.",

Activation of b 1 -AR provides strong stimulus to increase the frequency and contractility of the heart, whereas the activation of b 2 -AR results in smooth muscle relaxation and increased cardiac output with less extent compared to b 1 -AR. Thus, the connection between b-AR and HRV is plausible and warrants evaluations. Limited evidences suggest that variations in genes coding subtypes of b-AR may be associated with heart rate or HRV. For example, Ser49Gly polymorphism in b 1 -AR gene has been found to be associated with resting heart rate [14, 15] , and an association of b 2 -AR gene polymorphisms with spectral components of HRV measures has been reported in a relatively small healthy adult male sample [11] .",

Because stimulus of b-AR results in acceleration of heart rate, the functional changes in genetic polymorphisms of b-AR may affect acceleration/deceleration patterns of heart rate, which can be detected by the IBS method. The analyses of the present study were two-fold: 1) a nonrandomness index [17] derived from the IBS method was applied to quantify the nonlinear aspect of HRV according to b-AR genotype and to test the correlation of this index with standard HRV indices; and 2) using agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis, we unsupervisedly categorized these subjects into clusters based on pairwise dissimilarity among heart rate dynamics, and then we investigated the association of these clustering patterns with b-AR gene polymorphisms. We show that this bottom-up, categorization approach combining the IBS method and hierarchical cluster analysis can detect subgroups of subjects based on phenotypes that are associated with b-AR gene polymorphisms.",

The genotypes of rs1042713 were determined using polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Briefly, primers and probes were designed with SpectroDESIGNER software (Sequenom, San Diego, CA, USA). PCR was then performed, and unincorporated double-stranded nucleotide triphosphate bases (dNTPs) were dephosphorylated with shrimp alkaline phosphatase (Hoffman-LaRoche, Basel, Switzerland) followed by primer extension. The purified primer extension reaction product was spotted on to a 384-element silicon chip (SpectroCHIP, Sequenom) and analyzed in a Bruker Biflex III MALDI-TOF Spectro-READER mass spectrometer (Sequenom). The resulting spectra were then processed with SpectroTYPER (Sequenom). All samples were genotyped for eight unrelated SNPs for DNA quality examination. The samples were diluted onto 96-well plates, and only the plates on which each of the eight unrelated SNPs had a successful genotyping rate greater than 95% were used for further study. All experiments were performed by investigators who were blind to phenotype. Failure in genotyping for rs1801252 polymorphism was noted in 6 cases.",

Briefly, time domain measures of HRV include the mean heart rate and standard deviation of the normal interbeat intervals (SDNN), the root mean square successive difference between adjacent normal interbeat intervals (RMSSD), and the percentage of adjacent intervals that varied by greater than 50 ms (pNN50) [20] . The SDNN assesses the overall variability of interbeat intervals. The RMSSD and pNN50 measure the short-term variation of interbeat intervals, which is mainly modulated by parasympathetic innervation [21] . Standard spectral HRV measures [19] include high-frequency power (HF; 0.15-0.40 Hz), low-frequency power (LF; 0.04-0.15 Hz), and very low-frequency power (VLF; 0.003-0.04 Hz). LF power is suggested to be modulated by both sympathetic and parasympathetic activities, whereas HF power is mainly modulated by parasympathetic activity [22, 23] . The LF/HF ratio is considered a measure of the shift of sympathovagal balance toward sympathetic activity [19, 24] . The physiological mechanism underlying VLF power is disputed but has been suggested to be mediated partly by the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system or parasympathetic modulation [19, 25, 26] .",

The non-randomness index is independent of conventional entropic measures (i.e., sample entropy or approximate entropy) and has been evaluated in other studies [17, 45, 46, 47] . The calculation of the non-randomness index is based on estimating the average n-tuple distance between raw interbeat interval time series and its randomly shuffled surrogates using the IBS method, where the number of surrogates was 100 in the present study. The averaged non-randomness index derived from each n-tuple non-randomness index (n = 2-10) was then used in this study for comparisons among b-AR genotypes.",

First, our method enables us to cluster heart rate dynamics by an IBS method based on their acceleration/deceleration patterns of heartbeat sequence. The IBS method was not exclusively developed for the analysis of heartbeat sequence but also for other generic datasets consisting of repetitive elements [42, 43] . With an appropriate mapping rule that is meaningful to a target dataset, the IBS method can be applied to other types of phenotypic data derived from the time series [16] . Second, we employed a visually aided hierarchical analysis by a software tool called a generalized association map, which enables a bottom-up approach to unsupervisedly identify heart rate clusters to study genotype-phenotype associations. This bottom-up approach may help reduce the false-positivity commonly seen in conventional association studies. b 1 -AR is the predominant b-AR subtype in the heart. Compared to activation of b 2 -AR, stimulation in b 1 -AR can result in more Figure 2 .

Although substantial efforts have been made to link b 1 -AR polymorphisms with cardiovascular function, studies have been mixed in this regard. For example, b 1 -AR Ser49Gly polymorphism was found to be associated with increased blood pressure and heart rate [14, 15] but data are inconsistent in our findings and other reports [48, 49] . Because we studied only one polymorphism in b 1 -AR, further research is needed to identify other possible b 1 -AR polymorphisms associated with HRV.",

            "text": "This study found that b 2 -AR Arg16Gly genotype was associated with clusters based on acceleration/deceleration patterns of heart rate. Although b 2 -AR is expressed in the heart at lower concentrations than is the b 1 -AR subtype, it also expresses on the presynaptic sympathetic nerve terminals and expresses abundantly in vascular and bronchial smooth muscle. Therefore, changes in b 2 -AR function may not only alter sympathetic activity [50] , but also respiration and vascular responses [51, 52] . It can be reasonable to speculate that these factors have influences in HRV. Of note, the association between b 2 -AR Arg16Gly polymorphism and heart rate fluctuation patterns may simply reflect a functional genetic component nearby due to linkage disequilibrium and warrants future genetic research targeting on this region.",

Though the nonrandomness index was weakly associated with HRV indices (rsquare,0.1; Table S3 ), it did correlate negatively with HF power and positively with the LF/HF ratio, suggesting that the non-randomness index is a marker related to sympathovagal balance. Our findings of lower non-randomness index and LF% seen in homozygous b 2 -AR Arg16 carriers are in line with prior studies showing that the b 2 -AR Arg16 polymorphism is associated with lower sympathetic activity, manifested as lower blood pressure [53, 54] , lower plasma norepinephrine [54, 55] , and enhanced agonist-mediated desensitization in the vasculature [56] .",

Several limitations influence the interpretation of the findings presented in this study. First, we are unable to repeat findings of spectral HRV indices seen in a smaller male sample [11] . This may be due to different gender distributions [57] and means of ECG recording. Twenty-four hour Holter recording could validate and reinforce the association of b-AR genetic polymorphism with HRV seen in this study. Second, we were unable to evaluate the correlation of the non-randomness index with other commonly used sympathetic indicators, such as blood pressure or plasma catecholamine levels. Third, our findings are based on a healthy population and may not be generalizable to medically ill patients, such as those with cardiovascular diseases. The cross-sectional nature of our study also limited us examining the age modification of the effect of b-AR receptor polymorphism on autonomic function.",
