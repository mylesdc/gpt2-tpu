Meta-analysis offers the opportunity to confirm and expand our knowledge by combining and studying at one time a vast set of independent studies creating large datasets with increased statistical power. In this study, we performed two metaanalyses of porcine transcriptomic data: i) scrutinized the global immune response to different challenges, and ii) determined the specific response to Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV) infection. To gain an in-depth knowledge of the pig response to PRRSV infection, we used an original approach comparing and eliminating the common genes from both meta-analyses in order to identify genes and pathways specifically involved in the PRRSV immune response. The software Pointillist was used to cope with the highly disparate data, circumventing the biases generated by the specific responses linked to single studies. Next, we used the Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) software to survey the canonical pathways, biological functions and transcription factors found to be significantly involved in the pig immune response. We used 779 chips corresponding to 29 datasets for the pig global immune response and 279 chips obtained from 6 datasets for the pig response to PRRSV infection, respectively.",

Biological functions revealed in this meta-analysis were centred around translation regulation, which included protein synthesis, RNA-post transcriptional gene expression and cellular growth and proliferation. Furthermore, the oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondria dysfunctions, associated with stress signalling, were highly regulated. Transcription factors such as MYCN, MYC and NFE2L2 were found in this analysis to be potentially involved in the regulation of the immune response. The host specific response to PRRSV infection engendered the activation of well-defined canonical pathways in response to pathogen challenge such as TREM1, toll-like receptor and hyper-cytokinemia/ hyper-chemokinemia signalling. Furthermore, this analysis brought forth the central role of the crosstalk between innate and adaptive immune response and the regulation of anti-inflammatory response. The most significant transcription factor potentially involved in this analysis was HMGB1, which is required for the innate recognition of viral nucleic acids. Other transcription factors like interferon regulatory factors IRF1, IRF3, IRF5 and IRF8 were also involved in the pig specific response to PRRSV infection. ( ",

The aforementioned individual studies (Additional file 1: Table S1 ), as well as others, have contributed substantially to the understanding of the pig immune response [15] .

The activation of an immune response to PRRSV occurs when porcine cells, mainly pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAMs) and intravascular macrophages of the placenta and umbilical cord, interact with the virus [23] [24] [25] . It has been reported that PRRSV infection stimulated much less IFN-\u03b1 production than did porcine coronavirus or swine influenza virus in the lungs [26] , which probably leads to inadequate stimulation of antiviral immune responses and results in persistent viral infection. Furthermore, different isolates of PRRSV are dissimilar in their ability to induce IFN-\u03b1, IL-10 and IL-12 in lung or PAMs. This weakened IFN response plus increased IL-10 expression may contribute to immune modulation by some viral isolates [27, 28] .

A new meta-analysis approach was used to assess and to confront results from diverse studies, but, most importantly, to identify particular mechanisms operating under PRRSV infection. First, all publically available datasets from immune response experiments using many different microarray platforms and pathogens (Additional file 1: Table S1 ), including the ones for the response to PRRSV, were considered for the first global meta-analysis. It is important to stress that the scope of this global metaanalysis was to identify commonalities among pig immune response datasets that were characterized by heterogeneity at many levels (challenge system, tissues, pathogens, etc.). Accordingly, the results of this first study determined the most common mechanisms of the pig immune response using very heterogeneous datasets and the shared mechanisms will be referred to as the pig global immune response in this report. Secondly, we performed a meta-analysis considering only the PRRS studies. Finally, we performed a functional analysis considering the genes found only in response to PRRSV and eliminating genes in common with the first global metaanalysis in order to identify particular genes and mechanisms of immunity unique to the response to PRRSV. This study elucidated possible general host-response mechanisms and specific mechanisms in response to PRRSV, confirmed previous results and highlighted new host-pathogen interaction mechanisms.",

The evidences in this metaanalysis are the p-values of each addressed element, which in our case represents the gene expression that corresponds to the probes (elements) on each microarray chip. Consequently, as a first step, we determined the p-value of each microarray clone using a Pointillist significance calculator approach that can analyse the probability distribution of a set of observations and compute the statistical significance of each observation on the basis of that distribution. This probability corresponds to the likelihood that a given observation could happen by chance given the global distribution for all the observations. Accordingly, we employed the cumulative density function of a nonparametric distribution with a Gaussian kernel density [34, 35] to calculate the significance of the observations.",

Pointillist analysis identified 1982 unique significant probes (FDR < 0.05). Interestingly, 96% (1411 out the 1464) of the probes identified previously as significant for the pig global immune response were always significant in this analysis even without the PRRS datasets (Figure 1.I) .

This response mechanism was highly corroborated in our findings. Therefore, the UPR pathway was significantly enriched (p = 0.017) in this analysis, although it was not among the top pathways and involved four genes, XBP1, ATF4, EIF2S1 and HSPA5. Moreover, the transcription factor X-box-binding protein-1 (XBP-1) that plays a central role in activating the UPR [46] was altered in this study. As well, using the transcription factor estimation of IPA, the XBP-1 transcription factor was significant (4.06E-09) and connected to forty differentially expressed gene targets (Figure 2A ).

These differences could be the consequence of different methods used in the two studies. While Jenner and Young used the magnitude of gene expression profiles among experiments as a key factor for clustering the genes with subsequent annotation using biological ontologies, we used a robust methodology based on an optimization algorithm that minimizes the numbers of false positives and false negatives. Furthermore, in this study we included noninfectious perturbations, which might hinder the identification of infectious specific response. Another very plausible explanation to those differences is that the general signature highlighted during the pig global immune response might be due to the sampling process. Therefore, the sampling process might induce a stress response independent of whatever previous perturbation is under investigation. In individual studies it is impossible to distinguish this sampling damage response from other responses but maybe the biggest strength of the meta analysis here is the capability to detect these inadvertent responses.",

This approach might shed light on specific and particular biological pathways to PRRSV that could be masked by more general and abundant pathways of the immune response. First, we performed metaanalysis using all the experiments when PRRSV infection occurred. The total dataset corresponded to 31353 probes in 278 chips from 6 datasets. Of the 1906 (Additional file 9: Table S7 -A) probes identified by Pointillist as significantly affected by PRRSV infection, 1612 (Additional file 9: Table S7 -B) were mapped to NCBI and 1442 recognised by IPA (Additional file 7: Table S7 -C). To take in consideration only the genes specific to PRRSV infection, we removed from this list of 1442 IPArecognized genes those genes present on the list of pig global immune response (905 genes) resulting in a final list of 537 genes (Figure 1 .II, Additional file 10: Table S8-A) .",

Furthermore, the top five molecular and cellular functions in this analysis were: Cellular movement, Cell-To-cell signalling and interaction, Cellular growth and proliferation, Cell morphology and molecular transport (Additional file 4: Table S4B ). TREM-1 are abundant receptors, distributed on myeloid cells including neutrophils, CD14 high monocytes/macrophages and lung alveolar macrophages [51] . Stimulation of TREM by its unknown ligand or of toll like receptor (TLR) by lipopolysacharide can provoke the association of TREM1 and TLR, activating interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1), NF-\u03baB, and the pro-inflammatory response [51, 52] . In this study, the modulation of TREM-1 was associated with changes in expression of chemokines (e. g. CCL2, CCL3), interleukins (IL-6, IL-18, I1-beta), and toll like receptors (TLR2, TLR4) and others molecules such as a transmembrane receptor (CD86), the molecule CD88 and the growth factor receptor bound-2 (GRB2). TREM-1 has been implicated in the amplification of septic shock by enhancing the (TLR)-mediated production of proinflammatory cytokines [53, 54] in response to viruses like Marburg virus (MARV) and Ebola virus (EBOV) in humans [55] . If the involvement of TREM-1 and the role of neutrophils are confirmed during PRRSV infection by further investigations, it might be possible to improve the potency of anti-PRRSV vaccines by regulating the recruitment of myeloid cells, especially neutrophils to the site of antigen delivery.",

In addition, NFkB, EGR1, BCL3 and PYCARD were among the top transcription factors involved in pig immune response to PRRSV infection. NFkB was up-regulated during pulmonary infection by PRRSV [72] .

In addition, most of the biological functions highlighted during this analysis corresponded to multiple aspects of translation, response to stress, as well as cell death. Specifically, during this meta-analysis we highlighted a significant alteration of the host cell homeostasis, which enhances the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to send signals of stress. This might occur among other transcription factors via XBP-1 signalling. For the first time, we identified some transcription factors (MYCN, MYC and NFE2L2) that have been revealed to be highly significant in this analysis and their effect could be investigated in more detail.",

The implication of TREM1 during the PRRSV infection warrants specific attention, as other RNA viruses have been reported to act via this pathway. The potential involvement of the HMGB1 transcription factor in the innate recognition of PRRSV nucleic acids has been reported herein and potential implications discussed. Furthermore, interferon regulatory factors, IRF1, IRF3, IRF5 and IRF8 were all involved in pig specific response to PRRSV infection.",
