            "text": "The activation of astrocytes and microglia is often associated with diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). Understanding how activation alters the transcriptome of these cells may offer valuable insight regarding how activation of these cells mediate neurological damage. Furthermore, identifying common and unique pathways of gene expression during activation may provide new insight into the distinct roles these cells have in the CNS during infection and inflammation. Since recent studies indicate that TLR7 recognizes not only viral RNA but also microRNAs that are released by damaged neurons and elevated during neurological diseases, we first examined the response of glial cells to TLR7 stimulation using microarray analysis. Microglia were found to generate a much stronger response to TLR7 activation than astrocytes, both in the number of genes induced as well as fold induction. Although the primary pathways induced by both cell types were directly linked to immune responses, microglia also induced pathways associated with cellular proliferation, while astrocytes did not. Targeted analysis of a subset of the upregulated genes identified unique mRNA, including Ifi202b which was only upregulated by microglia and was found to be induced during both retroviral and bunyavirus infections in the CNS. In addition, other genes including Birc3 and Gpr84 as well as two expressed sequences AW112010 and BC023105 were found to be induced in both microglia and astrocytes and were upregulated in the CNS following virus infection. Thus, expression of these genes may a useful measurement of glial activation during insult or injury to the CNS.",

The initiation of these neuroinflammatory responses are often mediated by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), such as membrane bound toll-like receptors (TLRs) as well as cytoplasmic RNA and DNA sensors [1, 6, 7] . These PRRs are stimulated during infections of the CNS by pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs); structural motifs in nucleic acids, lipids or proteins from pathogens that are not commonly found in a eukaryotic cell [8] [9] [10] . Damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), such as nucleic acids from apoptotic cells or secreted micro-RNAs, have also been associated with neurological disease or damage and can also stimulate PRRs, particularly endosomal toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) and TLR9 [11] [12] [13] . Examining how stimulation of these receptors mediates neuroinflammatory responses is important in determining the mechanisms of pathogenesis for diseases of the CNS.",

Microglia are derived early during development from immature progenitors in the yolk sac and have an important role in synaptic pruning of neurons in the developing brain [15] . These cells then populate the CNS and persist for the entire life of the organism with only limited turnover from bone-marrow derived monocytes. In the mature CNS, microglia have a ramified morphology and only become amoeboid in shape upon activation. They actively respond to infection or damage in the CNS, phagocytizing microorganisms, dying cells and cellular debris as well as producing inflammatory mediators [8, 9, 15] . In contrast to microglia, astrocytes are neuroectodermal in origin and are responsible for a wide variety of functions in the CNS [2] . For example, they regulate transendothelial cell migration across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and contribute to regulation of synaptic activity throughout the brain. Upon activation, astrocytes upregulate expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and undergo process extension and interdigitation. Excessive activation of astrocytes during infection or inflammation can result in astrocyte scarring, leading to long term tissue damage [2, 10, [16] [17] [18] .",

However, both microglia and astrocytes are capable of recognizing multiple viral and bacterial infections [10, 20, 21] and secrete high levels of cytokines following activation [5, 20, 22] . Indeed, our previous studies showed similar induction of cytokines following TLR stimulation of astrocytes or microglia [20] .

Real-time PCR analysis confirmed the higher ratio of gene expression by microglia, although it did detect gene expression in astrocytes that was not detectable by microarray. Comparison of TLR7 to another endosomal TLR, TLR9, indicated that the increased response by microglia was consistent for both receptors. Analysis of several of the upregulated genes in both cell types revealed potential markers for both microglia and astrocyte activation during viral activation. The findings from these studies provide a better understanding in how TLR activation alters the function of both astrocytes and microglia as well as identifying genes that may be potential markers for glial activation in vivo and in vitro.",

Six hours was chosen as the optimal time point for analysis based on previous PCR array data that showed optimal induction of immune response genes at this time point post stimulation [20] . Analysis of microarray data indicated a total of 293 genes with altered mRNA expression in microglia and/or astrocytes following TLR7 stimulation, with 169 genes significantly upregulated by at least two-fold and 60 genes that were down-regulated (Fig 1) . Surprisingly, only 49 of the 293 genes were common to both microglia and astrocytes (Figs 1-2 ). Of the common upregulated genes, 10 of the top 20 were proinflammatory cytokines (Fig 2, shaded gray genes) correlating with the strong cytokine production associated with both cell types following TLR activation [20] . Only five genes had mRNA expression down-regulated in both astrocytes and microglia following TLR7 stimulation, including Rasgrp3, whose protein functions to inhibit TLR responses in macrophages [34] .",

Of the genes with upregulated mRNA expression, 28 were increased at least 4 fold indicating that TLR7 had a substantial impact on the transcriptome of microglia. Several of the genes with increased mRNA expression are well known activation markers of microglia including Marco and Nos2 [35, 36] . However, other genes including Saa3, which to our knowledge had not been previously associated with microglia activation, were also upregulated and may provide additional markers for microglia responses in the CNS. Analysis of the changes in gene expression following TLR7 of microglia by IPA identified pathways linked to the activation of immune cells with the highest Z scores, followed by pathways associated with the recruitment and migration of cells (Table 1) . These results are consistent with the role of microglia as the \"immune cell of the CNS\" and the ability of microglia to respond to sites of insult or injury in the CNS.",

TLR9-induced activation of microglia and astrocytes induced a very similar response to TLR7-induced activation (Fig 5,  Table 3 ).

We next determined if any of these identified genes were induced in vivo following virus infection of the CNS. We utilized two different mouse models of virus infection: a retrovirus (MuLV) infection model, where the primary cells infected are microglia and macrophages and the level of CNS inflammation is minimal, and La Crosse virus (LACV) infection, which results in substantial neuronal cell death and inflammatory infiltrate in the CNS. In both model systems, gliosis is associated with pathogenesis [41, 42] . We analyzed nine genes that were upregulated by TLR stimulation of either microglia and/or astrocytes in both systems. Interestingly, the two genes whose mRNAs were consistently only upregulated in astrocytes, Elovl7 and Rapgef5, were not elevated in brain tissue following either virus infection (Fig 6) . Only Ifi202b mRNA was significantly induced in brain tissue from MuLV-infected mice, which correlated with the lower level of inflammation in this model (Fig 6) . However, several additional genes including Traf1, AW11202010, Birc3, Gpr84 and BC023105 were upregulated following LACV infection. The upregulation of these genes by TLR stimulation of glial cells in vitro and virus infection in vivo suggests that mRNA expression of these genes may be useful for measuring glial activation in the CNS during virus infections. bars indicate the relative decrease compared to mock over the range of all upregulated genes with a high value of 52.6 (interleukin 6) and a low value of -8.58 (Rasgrp3).

However, some of this difference is likely to be due to the lower basal mRNA expression of many of these genes in astrocytes. Additionally, TLR7 and TLR9 are expressed at higher levels in microglia than in astrocytes [20] , which could account for more stimulation in microglial cells and thus the higher overall number of genes induced by TLR stimulation.",

            "text": "The difference in detection of upregulated genes by real-time PCR in both astrocytes and microglia is most likely due to the amplification steps in PCR that allow detection of differences between lower copy numbers of mRNA transcripts that might not be detected by direct binding studies with microarray analysis [40] . Importantly, all of the genes found to be upregulated in a specific cell type by microarray were also upregulated by real-time PCR (Table 2) , although not necessarily with the same fold increase between the two cell types. This indicates that although the level of detection and fold-increase may vary between the two methods, the genes that were detected as upregulated by microarray analysis could be confirmed by real-time PCR analysis. The fold change in cytokine mRNA expression is also highly dependent on the initial transcript level, particularly in the case of real-time PCR. Therefore, the relative fold-change per cell type may vary significantly between detection by real-time PCR versus that observed with microarray analysis [40] . This may also explain why the relative fold-change in cytokine mRNA expression is not consistent with protein expression. The microarray and real-time PCR analysis of cytokine genes in the current study indicate substantial differences in cytokine expression between microglia and astrocytes following TLR7 stimulation, including Il-6, Il1a and Il-12. However, protein analysis of these same cytokines showed similar levels in culture Genes with expression change only in microglia and not astrocytes.

For example, Ifi202b, an interferon stimulatory gene (ISG) that is most known for its role as a lupus susceptibility gene in mice [43] , was consistently only induced in microglia and not in astrocyte as measured by both microarray and real-time PCR (Fig 3, Table 2 ). Thus, Ifi202b may be a unique transcript that is upregulated primarily by microglia in response to TLR activation. Ifi202b mRNA was induced in the brain following MuLV and LACV infection (Fig 6) and was recently found to be induced in the CNS following Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infection [44] . IFI202b is a transcriptional regulator which has been shown to down-regulate AIM2 inflammasome signaling and regulate interferon (IFN) stimulated gene (ISG) expression Real-time PCR analysis of mRNA expression in microglia and/or astrocytes following TLR7 or TLR9 stimulation. RNA samples from mock, TLR7 or TLR9-stimulated microglia or astrocytes were analyzed at 6 hps for mRNA expression of genes that were found by microarray to be (A-D) induced in microglia only, (E-H) induced in both microglia and astrocytes, or (I-L) induced in astrocytes only. Data are shown as the fold induction relative to mockstimulated controls for each cell type (average of 6 mock-stimulated samples). Data are the mean +/-SEM for 3-6 samples per group and are representative of two separate experiments.

Interestingly, the Ifi202b gene is truncated by a microdeletion in the 5' flanking region and first exon in C57BL/6 mice, which affects the transcriptional expression in most, but not all, tissues [46] . Our current study indicates that Ifi202b mRNA is expressed in brain tissue Real-time PCR analysis of mRNA expression of selected genes in brain tissue of mice with viral encephalitis. Brain tissue from mice with signs of neurological disease following infection with MuLV or LACV was processed for RNA. Age-matched and strain-matched controls for each virus infection were processed at the same time as viral infection and are shown as controls for the respective viruses. RNA was then analyzed for expression of mRNAs of genes identified as being induced following TLR activation of microglia and/or astrocytes. Data are the mean +/-SEM of 3-6 mice per group and are shown as the fold change relative to the average mock sample for each group. Statistical analysis was completed by unpaired t test between the virus-infected brain tissue and the appropriate mock-infected control.

SAA3 protein is involved in the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome [47] . The NLRP3 inflammasome cleaves pro-IL1\u03b2 to IL-1\u03b2, which can mediate cellular damage in the brain by causing pyroptosis [48] . SAA3 can prime glial cells to produce IL-1 at comparable levels to that observed by LPS stimulation [49] .

Increased transcription of these two genes may be essential for microglia and/or astrocytes to respond to subsequent immune stimuli. Another upregulated transcript, Gpr84, produces a protein that is expressed primarily on myeloid cells, recognizes medium chain fatty acids and is involved in immune regulation. Interestingly, a two base pair frameshift deletion in Gpr84 has been identified in several mouse strains including DBA/1, FVB/NJ, NOD and SJL/J [51] .

However, one explanation for this difference may be due to the sensitivity of microarray analysis, since real-time PCR detected transcriptional changes of the same genes in astrocytes, although not to the same fold-increase as microglia. Analysis of a subset of these genes identified at least one gene, Ifi202b, which was specific to microglia and was upregulated not only in vitro, but also induced by virus infection, in vivo.
