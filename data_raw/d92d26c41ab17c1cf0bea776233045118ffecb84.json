            "text": "Between January 2012 and March 2012, the infection rates of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) increased substantially in vaccinated swine herds in many porcine farms in Gansu Province, China. The spike (S) glycoprotein is an important determinant for PEDV biological properties. To determine the distribution profile of PEDV outbreak strains, we sequenced the full-length S gene of five samples from two farms where animals exhibited severe diarrhea and high mortality rates. Five new PEDV variants were identified, and the molecular diversity, phylogenetic relationships, and antigenicity analysis of Gansu field samples with other PEDV reference strains were investigated. A series of insertions, deletions, and mutations in the S gene was found in five PEDV variants compared with classical and vaccine strains. These mutations may provide stronger pathogenicity and antigenicity to the new PEDV variants that influenced the effectiveness of the CV777-based vaccine. Our results suggest that these new PEDV variant strains in Gansu Province might be from South Korean or South China, and the effectiveness of the CV777-based vaccine",

The S protein of JY5C, JY6C, JY7C, and YJ3F contained 28 Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr sequons and 22 asparagines predicted to be N-glycosylated ( Figure 1A,B) . The S protein of the YJ7C strain contained 29 Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr sequons and 23 asparagines predicted to be N-glycosylated ( Figure 1C ). However, the S protein of the CV777 vaccine strain contained 29 Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr sequons and 22 asparagines predicted to be N-glycosylated ( Figure 1D ). For JY5C, JY6C, JY7C, and YJ3F, four (from N to V at 57, from N to I at 127, from T to I at 232, and from N to S at 719) of the changes in the predicted amino acid sequence destroyed N-linked glycosylation sites, whereas another three changes (from S to N at 58, from I to T at 116, and from T to N at 1193) created three new glycosylation sites compared with the vaccine strain CV777 (Figure 2 ). For the YJ7C strain, three amino acid changes (from N to V at 57, from N to I at 127, and from T to I at 232) destroyed N-linked glycosylation sites and another three changes (from S to N at 58, from I to T at 116, and from T to N at 1193) created three new glycosylation sites compared with the vaccine strain CV777 (Figure 2 ). The changes in the N-linked glycosylation sites between the Gansu PEDV strains from our study and the vaccine strain may influence their pathogenicity and antigenicity and should be researched in the future.",

However, the nucleotide sequence of our PEDV strains had only 93.8% to 93.9% identity to the CV777 vaccine strain, and their deduced amino acids had 93.6% to 93.7% identity to the CV777 vaccine strain. The nucleotide sequence of our PEDV strains had lower identity (93.3% to 95.7%) to the previous domestic strains (DX, LZC, LJB-03, JS-2004-2, and CHS) and their deduced amino acids had 92.6% to 95.7% identity to the previous domestic strains (DX, LZC, LJB-03, JS-2004-2, and CHS). The nucleotide sequence of our PEDV strains also had low identity (93.2% to 94.6% and 93.7% to 93.8%) to the Japanese strains (MK, NK, and KH) and the European strain (Br1-87), respectively, and their deduced amino acids had 93.1% to 94.2% and 93.4% to 93.6% identities to the Japanese strains (MK, NK, and KH) and the Europe strain (Br1-87), respectively. The nucleotide sequence of our PEDV strains had higher identity (94.7% to 97.1%) to seven South Korean strains (KNU-0801, KNU-0802, KNU-0901, KNU-0902, KNU-0903, KNU-0904, and KNU-0905), and their deduced amino acids had 94.1% to 96.8% identity.

Similar to other coronavirus S proteins, the PEDV S protein is a glycoprotein peplomer (surface antigen) on the viral surface, with a pivotal function in stimulating induction of neutralizing antibodies in the natural host. Thus, the S glycoprotein is a primary target for the development of effective vaccines against PEDV. Further research is needed to determine whether the amino acid changes in the Gansu strains from our study result in any antigenicity changes. ",

The sequence insertions and deletions in the S gene and mutations in the antigenic regions found in variant strains possibly provided stronger pathogenicity and antigenicity to the new PEDV variants that influenced the effectiveness of the CV777-based vaccine, ultimately causing the 2012 outbreak of severe diarrhea in the porcine farms of Gansu Province, China.
