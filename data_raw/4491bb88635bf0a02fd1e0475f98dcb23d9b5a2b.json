            "text": "Severe fever with thromocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is a severe infectious disease caused by the SFTSV virus. In some areas oft he world, the diesease is associated with a 10-30% frequency of fatality. The reasons why most patients survive, but 10-30% succumb to the disease is poorly understood. Previous studies mainly focussed on innate immune cells. In the present manuscript, it is shown that there is a striking lack of an anti-virus IgM and IgG response in all deceased patients (except a transient anti-Gn IgM antibody response in some deceased patients), whereas all patients who survived showed strong IgM and IgG responses against viral proteins. This is associated with a number of other immunological differences between patients who resolved the infection or died, namely i) persistent high virus titres in deceased patients compared to virus clearance in surviving patients, ii) strongly reduced frequencies of naive B cells, iii) increased frequencies of plasmablasts in the deceased patient group, iv) increased apoptosis of monocytes in the deceased patient group, v) decreased expression of MHC class II and costimulatory receptors on B cells from deceased patients, vi) alterations in TFH cells in the peripheral blood between the patient groups, and vii) alterations in cytokine levels betwen the patient groups.",

For example, is there really a dramatic loss of naive B cells in the deceased patients, or is the lower frequency only due to higher number of other B cells, with total number sof naive B cells actually unchanged? Thus, the total numbers of B cells should also be presented.",

            "text": "2) At first glance it is unexpected and may appear even contradictory that the deceased patients have no specific antibody response, but higher frequencies of plasmablasts. This many perhaps be explained by a general B cell activation towards plasmablast differentiation in the absence of a functional specific response. However, as this is a central issue, the plasmablasts need to be better characterized. It is strange that in the deceased patients about 70% and in the surviving patients 30% of plasmablasts are IgM-IgG-. A plasmablast without strong Ig expression is highly questionable. Perhaps, there is an induction of specific class-switching to IgA? There are also socalled IgD-only B cells and plasmablasts/plasma cells in the human that produce IgD in the complete absence of IgM. Can they play a role here? Moreover, the definition of the cells as plasmablasts relies only on the staining pattern CD27-high, CD38-high. Perhaps, in the acute viral infection some activated B cells transiently upregulate CD27 and CD38 without being plasmablasts? Thus, it is recommended that the CD27++CD38++ cells are also stained for IgA and IgD, and that the cells are analyzed for key plasmablast/plasma cell markers (upregulation of transcription factors BLIMP1, IRF4, XBP1) by FACS or RT-PCR.",

In healthy individuals, it is well known that these are primarily IgG+CD27-B cells, which account for 10-20% of all IgG memory B cells. However, because of the massive B cell compartment alterations present in the patients with acute virus infection, it remains uncertain what the cells defined by lack of CD27 and IgD really are. Are they indeed IgG+ memory B cells? Can it be excluded that they are, for example, immature B cells (IgM+IgD-CD27-), released from the bone marrow, or that they are polyclonally activated naive B cells that downregulated IgD upon stimulation? It would likely be sufficient to perform flow cytometric analysis in a few patients and healthy controls to stain the IgD-CD27-B cells also for IgG and IgM to clarify their identity better. CD21 could be included to distinguish immature from unusual mature B cells, in case many of them are IgM+.",

Please explain. d) In figure 5 , necrotic cells are defined as PI+ cells, and apoptotic cells as annexin V+ cells. However, one typically sees annexin V+PI-and annexin V+PI+ cells. How were the double positive cells grouped? As necrotic or as apoptotic? This needs to be better described. e) At least in the pdf file available for review, the immunofluorescence pictures in figure 5A are very dark and hardly interpretable.

The authors attributed this phenomenon as the causative reason for disease aggravation and mortality, and attempted to define a mechanism that suggest a disruption of affinity maturation involving TfH, B cells and myeloid DC (mDC) activity in the lymph node or spleen. While the phenomenon of virus specific antibodies suppression is convincing, the experiments conducted to link this to dysfunctional TfH, mDC and B cells were loosely connected. Furthermore, the complex pathway that occurs within the secondary lymphoid organs and not the blood proposed in this study would require more than the surveillance of immune markers on the cells. These data should be supplemented by more conclusive functional in vitro assays or in vivo models. Comments 1. The introduction contains too much irrelevant information and could be shortened.",

To confirm that antibodies in the survive patients play a role in the clearance of virus and protection, functional neutralization assays with the patients' serum samples should be performed. Otherwise this remains an association and its impact should not be over claimed. b. Fig 1, the profiling of NP specific antibody (Ab) is by ELISA and profiling of Gn specific Ab is by western blot. Data of Gn by ELISA is left as unpublished data. To provide better consistency, it would be better to present the ELISA data of Gn together with ELISA data of NP in the main figure and shift the data of Gn western blot to the supplementary with the data from Supp Fig 1. c. Authors should perform clustering of the data in color chart of the ELISA data. As it stands, the current figure makes it very difficult to read the data. d. Fig 2B, It is not clear how the authors selected the data to generate the correlation curve. It  would be more meaningful to convert all the data points collected in Fig 2B into the correlation plot  with just the viral load versus the Ab titre. 4. The following points should be addressed for data presented in Fig 3 and Fig 4: a. It is possible that the disease could induce leukopenia in patients and diminish the overall B cells numbers in the blood. Authors should provide data of blood counts that includes leucocytes and granulocytes. In addition, the numbers of total B cells should be compared between groups. Without this information, data in Fig 3C is not meaningful, as it is possible that while the % of a specific subset relative to total B cells is the same between survived and deceased groups, the actual numbers could be vastly different due to overall reduction of B cells. b. The rationale of having 2 different gating strategies for PB and MB was not clearly explained. Authors should consider including the CD38 marker into the analysis presented in Fig 3. In this way, the analysis of B cells subset definition could be standardized. c. Fig 4, the ELISPOT was done using total B cells. Authors should consider doing the ELISPOT with sorted PB to demonstrate the lack of virus specific Ab secreting PB cells. d. In lines 235 -239, authors concluded that the observation of increase proportion of IgM-IgG-in the deceased group meant this subset is responsible for abrogated serological response. This is similar to saying that this subset of cells is immunosuppressive, which is not true. In addition, the comparison of this subset was done in % relative to total B cells. Data of % relative to total leucocytes would be more meaningful.",

Author presented 2 effects to the mDCs: apoptosis/necrosis and the suppression of costimulatory molecules that could suppress Ag presentation. The manuscript would flow better if the text from lines 258 -283 is separated into 2 sub-sections based on these 2 effects. b. Regarding the apoptosis assay, authors allowed the PBMCs to adhere and subsequently performed staining on all adherent cells with the assumption they are monocytes. This is incorrect. The authors would need to either proof that this method produces homogenous monocytes in the adherent cells or add in markers to confirm the identity of the cells undergoing apoptosis. A more direct alternative method would be to track apoptosis using a annexin V kit by flow cytometry using the same gating strategy used for the mDCs. c. In the second part, authors profiles the co-stimulatory molecules and proposed that the Ag presentation of mDCs is impaired. This is inadequate and more direct function assays would be required to drive this point. Particularly, authors should sort out mDCs from the 2 groups of patients, and assess their ability to present Ag to T cells either by CFSE tagging to the T cells or by ELISOT assay. d. Lastly, an important fundamental concept must be addressed. Myeloid DC (also known as conventional DC) is derived from CDP and not monocytes. 6. Fig 6, authors proposed that B cells Ag presentation to TfH is vital for TfH expansion and the alteration of CD80 and HLA-DR disrupted this process. This unique process happens exclusively in the lymph nodes and spleen in a small percentage of B cells within the interfollicular zone2. It is questionable if the profiling of co-stimulatory molecules in the peripheral B cells would be sufficient to drive this conclusion. Direct immunofluorescent staining of B cells and TfH co-localization in the interfollicular zone would be required to show the abrogation of this interaction. 7. Fig 7, where authors argued the loss of function TfH in deceased patients would need to be further addressed: a. Representative pseudoplot provided highlighted only 2 IL-21 positive staining events. This is too low to be conclusive if we consider the noise to actual signal ratio of a generic flow cytometry machine. In view of this, authors should consider using IL-21 gene expression from sorted pTfH cells. b. Following the reference cited by the authors, functional role of pTfH in patients was shown by their ability to induce phenotypic changes in na\u00efve B cells through co-culture system. They should consider using a similar system to assign a function difference to the pTfH beyond the profiling if IL21.",

Additionally, they characterized severe apoptosis of peripheral monocytes in patients with the fatal outcome when compared to surviving patients or healthy controls. Finally, they performed cytokine profiling of all patients and found a correlation in severity with increased levels of serum IFN-\u03b3, IL-10, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1.

According to a previous study, there are about 80% human peripheral CD19 + B cells expressing B220 [5] . Actually, although a small part of B cells expresses low level of CD11c, its frequency in periphery blood is very small and this small subset of CD11c + B cells is located in T /B cell border in spleen [6] . Another reason we chose B220 was that, besides CD11c + MHC\u2161 + B cells which need to be excluded from our gating strategy of CD11c + mDCs, recent study demonstrated that thymus-derived \u03b1\u03b2 TCR + cells could also express CD11c and MHC class II molecules [7] . Furthermore, earlier evidence has revealed that during acute virus infection, such as Ebola virus, large proportion of T cells were activated [8] . Meanwhile, another study by Bleesing et al found that activated human T cells also up-regulated the expression of B220 [9] . Therefore, using B220 marker, we can exclude most of the B cells and activated T cells. Taken together, we make a brief gating strategy of mDC by B220 marker.",

We then further defined the plasmablasts as CD19 + CD27 ++ IgDin the CD19 + CD27 + IgDgroup, since a previous study by Avery et al reported that increased expression of CD27 on human memory B cell correlated with their commitment to plasma cell lineage [5] . Due to the limitation of our FACS machinery (BD Aira II with six channels), CD38 was left to the second step gating.

For example, is there really a dramatic loss of naive B cells in the deceased patients, or is the lower frequency only due to higher number of other B cells, with total number of naive B cells actually unchanged? Thus, the total numbers of B cells should also be presented.Response:To address the reviewer's suggestion, we calculated the data and presented various B cell subsets as the percentage of total B cells as well as the ratio of total B cell in total lymphocytes inFigure 3C-G (the lower panel). The formula for the calculation of the numbers of the various B cell subsets was: the ratio of B cell subset/total B cells multiplied by the ratio of total B cells/total lymphocytes, then multiplied by the amount of the lymphocytes which were provided by the clinical tests at the same day point when the blood samples for flow cytometry analysis were collected. The results between the frequencies and the numbers of the various B cell subsets displayed high consistency as we estimated. Actually, based on the data we previously published, we had found that the count of leukocytes and lymphocytes manifested no significant difference among the patients' groups with different severity in the acute phase of SFTS [1, 2]. We also compared the data of lymphocyte subset analysis of partial patients in clinical detection, and the result demonstrated that the proportion of CD19 + B cells in total lymphocytes between survived and deceased group showed no significant differences either (listed in the",

We conducted the flow cytometry analysis using panel E(CD3, CD19, CD27, CD38, IgA, IgD), and CD27 high CD38 high B cells were sorted for gene expression analysis of the key cell markers, including BLIMP1, IRF4 and XBP1 by RT-PCR. The phenotypic analysis revealed that only low levels of IgD + and IgA + fractions were detected in the PBs and they showed no significant difference between the two patient groups(Figure 4C-4D).Strikingly, the expression of BLIMP1, IRF4 and XBP1 of CD27 high CD38 high B cells in survived patients were up-modulated simultaneously as compared with their expression in healthy donors. However, all three key transcription factors involved in the maturation of plasmablasts were all dramatically inhibited in deceased patients (Figure 4Fand 4G). The results were discussed in the text of the revised manuscript.3) One of the peripheral blood B cell subsets that showed a significant difference between the two patient groups are CD19+CD27-IgD-B cells. In healthy individuals, it is well known that these are primarily IgG+CD27-B cells, which account for 10-20% of all IgG memory B cells. However,because of the massive B cell compartment alterations present in the patients with acute virus infection, it remains uncertain what the cells defined by lack of CD27 and IgD really are. Are they indeed IgG+ memory B cells? Can it be excluded that they are, for example, immature B cells (IgM+IgD-CD27-), released from the bone marrow, or that they are polyclonally activated naive B cells that downregulated IgD upon stimulation? It would likely be sufficient to perform flow cytometric analysis in a few patients and healthy controls to stain the IgD-CD27-B cells also for IgG and IgM to clarify their identity better. CD21 could be included to distinguish immature from unusual mature B cells, in case many of them are IgM+.Response: To address the reviewer's questions, we performed analyses as suggested to investigate the compartment of CD19 + CD27 -IgD -B cells in the peripheral blood, which showed a significant difference between the two patient groups during acute phase of SFTSV infection. We performed the flow cytometry analysis using panel F (CD19, CD27, IgD, IgM, IgG, CD21), and the results were presented inFigure 3H-3I. We found that the fraction of IgM + cells in the CD27 -IgD -B cells in the deceased, survived and healthy control group was 26.8%, 19.6% and 31.0% respectively. Meanwhile, the fraction of IgG + cells in the CD27 -IgD -B cells, representing 4.9%, 3.5% and 1.3% in the respective groups, were significantly lower than the corresponding fraction of IgM + cells. However, both the fraction of IgG + cells and IgM + cells in the CD27 -IgD -B cells had no significant differences among three groups. Furthermore, according to the reviewer's advice, we measured the CD21 expression in IgM + IgD -CD27 -B cells. Strikingly, the proportion of CD21cells in IgM + IgD -CD27 -B cells was 89.9% in the deceased patients, significantly higher than 60.9% and 49.3% in the survived and healthy control groups, respectively. Previous study revealed that during B cell ontogeny, bone marrow B cell precursors expressed surface IgM at the early stage, and acquired phenotypical characterization of IgM + IgD -CD27 -. In the maturation of na\u00efve B cells, IgM switched to IgD or co-expressed with IgD, leading to na\u00efve B cells displaying two different phenotypes of IgM -IgD + CD27or IgM + IgD + CD27 -[3,4]. Suryani et al have proved that CD21 serves as a good marker which could reflect the extent of maturation of B cells[4].Therefore, we inferred that IgM + IgD -CD27immature B cells would be the major compartment of CD27 -IgD -B cells. Extremely high frequency of CD21 negative IgM + IgD -CD27 -B cells in the deceased patients might reflect the dysfunction of B cell maturation, and partially explained the significant loss of IgD + CD27na\u00efve B cells during the fatal infection of SFTS virus.",

Based on the data we previously published, although SFTS virus infection could induce leukopenia in nearly all patients, the number of leukocytes and lymphocytes manifested no significant difference among the patients' groups with different severity in the acute phase of SFTS [1, 2]. Additionally, according to the data of lymphocyte subset analysis in clinical samples, we found that the fraction of peripheral CD19 + B cells in total lymphocytes also showed no significant difference between survived and deceased group (listed in the table below). In order to make the figure more reflective, we re-calculated the numbers of B cell subsets and presented them in Figure 3C-G (the lower panel) in the revised manuscript. The formula for the calculation of the numbers of the various B cell subsets is: the ratio of B cell subset/total B cells multiplied by the ratio of total B cells/total lymphocytes, then multiplied by the amount of the lymphocytes which were provided by the clinical tests at the same day point when the blood samples for flow cytometry analysis were collected. lymphocyte subsets of partial patients from clinical detection b.

In view of this, authors should consider using IL-21 gene expression from sorted pTfH cells.

They should consider using a similar system to assign a function difference to the pTfH beyond the profiling if IL21. Response: Taking the reviewer's suggestion, we sorted na\u00efve B cells and pTfH cells from peripheral blood of patients by flow cytometry. pTfH cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS and stimulated with 1ul Leukocyte Activation Cocktail at 37 o C for 3h.

At first glance it is unexpected and may appear even contradictory that the deceased patients have no specific antibody response, but higher frequencies of plasmablasts. This many perhaps be explained by a general B cell activation towards plasmablast differentiation in the absence of a functional specific response. However, as this is a central issue, the plasmablasts need to be better characterized. It is strange that in the deceased patients about 70% and in the surviving patients 30% of plasmablasts are IgM-IgG-. A plasmablast without strong Ig expression is highly questionable. Perhaps, there is an induction of specific class-switching to IgA? There are also so-called IgD-only B cells and plasmablasts/plasma cells in the human that produce IgD in the complete absence of IgM. Can they play a role here? Moreover, the definition of the cells as plasmablasts relies only on the staining pattern CD27-high, CD38-high. Perhaps, in the acute viral infection, some activated B cells transiently upregulate CD27 and CD38 without being plasmablasts? Thus, it is recommended that the",

Direct immunofluorescent staining of B cells and TfH co-localization in the interfollicular zone would be required to show the abrogation of this interaction.Response: The reviewer's points are well taken. However, since most SFTS patients suffered from dysfunction of coagulation to varying extents [1], the biopsy of LN or SP would likely run the risk of hemorrhage on SFTS patients, especially on severe individuals. In addition, patients died of infectious diseases are rarely allowed for biopsy. Therefore, we haven't been able to do direct immunofluorescent staining of B cells and TfH co-localization assay on patient's lymph nodes.
