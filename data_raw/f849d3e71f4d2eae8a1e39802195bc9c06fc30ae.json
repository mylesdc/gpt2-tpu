            "text": "Background: Viral respiratory infection (VRI) is a common contraindication to elective surgery. Asymptomatic shedding among pediatric surgery patients (PSPs) could potentially lead to progression of symptomatic diseases and cause outbreaks of respiratory diseases. The aim of this study is to investigate the incidence of infection among mild symptomatic PSP group and asymptomatic PSP group after surgical procedure. Methods: We collected the induced sputum from enrolled 1629 children (under 18 years of age) with no respiratory symptom prior to pediatric surgery between March 2017 and February 2019. We tested 16 different respiratory virus infections in post-surgery mild symptomatic PSP group and asymptomatic PSP group using a quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay panel. We analyzed symptom data and quantitative viral load to investigate the association between viruses, symptoms and viral quantity in qRT-PCR-positive PSPs. Results: Out of 1629 children enrolled, a total of 204 respiratory viruses were present in 171 (10.50%) PSPs including 47 patients with mild symptoms and 124 with no symptoms after surgery. Commonly detected viruses were human rhino/enterovirus (HRV/EV, 42.19%), parainfluenza virus 3 (PIV3, 24.48%), coronavirus (CoV NL63, OC43, HKU1, 11.46%), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV, 9.9%). PIV3 infection with a higher viral load was frequently found in PSPs presenting with mild symptoms, progressing to pneumonia with radiographic evidence after surgery. HRV/EV were the most commonly detected pathogens in both asymptomatic and mild symptomatic PSPs. CoV (OC43, HKU1) infections with a higher viral load were mostly observed in asymptomatic PSPs progressing to alveolar or interstitial infiltration. Conclusions: Our study suggested that PIV3 is a new risk factor for VRI in PSPs. Employing a more comprehensive, sensitive and quantitative method should be considered for preoperative testing of respiratory viruses in order to guide optimal surgical timing.",

As VRIs can often be mild or asymptomatic and typically go undocumented, individuals may not seek medical care because either the infection is mild or it elicits symptoms not severe enough to warrant contacting a medical professional [10] . Asymptomatic viral shedding in the nasopharynx in asymptomatic populations and immunocompetent hosts is relatively common [11] [12] [13] . Asymptomatic shedding among pediatric surgery patients (PSPs) could potentially play an key role in propagating outbreaks of respiratory diseases if subclinical VRI is transmissible and leads to progression of symptomatic disease [13] . However, the infections reported by the surveillance showed only the symptomatic fraction of the total infected population [14] . The role of asymptomatic infection in respiratory virus transmission is still largely unknown and the rates of asymptomatic shedding are not well studied.",

If children with VRI presented with obvious symptoms (fever, cough), it would be an easy decision for the surgeon or anesthesiologist to delay surgery if appropriate. In cases of children with mild or no symptoms, it becomes very difficult for doctors to make the right decision. A few studies have investigated VRI associated with a limited number of respiratory viruses and have demonstrated an increased length of stay (LOS) and increased postoperative complication rates in pediatric cardiac surgical patients [15, 16] . The data for VRI among the PSPs is not performed systematically recorded and thus detailed etiologic data are lacking. To better estimate the current state of VRI in PSPs and to improve clinical management, this study aims to investigate the incidence of VRI in the mild symptomatic and asymptomatic pediatric surgery population after surgical procedures and to evaluate the impact of VRI on postoperative outcomes. We analyzed detailed symptom data using a standardized symptom survey and quantitative viral load using multiple qRT-PCR to determine the associations between viruses, symptoms and viral quantity.",

Children (age < 18 year) undergoing a surgical procedure between March 2017 and February 2019 were eligible for enrollment. We obtained induced sputum specimens from hospitalized patients within 48 h of admission regardless of the presence of respiratory symptoms, as part of standard care in the hospital. If pediatric patients had serious symptoms suggestive of respiratory infections before surgery and must delay surgery, these patients were excluded from analysis. The PSPs who had no respiratory symptom prior to elective or emergency surgery were included in the study. After surgery, study subjects completed a baseline information form and a standardized symptom survey that included six symptoms (fever [17] , wheezing, sputum, shortness of breath, soar throat and cough) and radiographic findings (alveolar or interstitial infiltrate and pleural effusion). Fever was defined as a body temperature \u2265 38.0\u00b0C. Mild symptoms refer to the subjects who had at least one of the above respiratory symptoms that were not severe. A clinical chart review was performed for subjects to determine whether symptoms occurred outside of the study visit. Data on management and outcome of the cases were collected from the medical records. The study was approved by the institutional ethics review board at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of Zhejiang, including a waiver of informed consent.",

These viruses were detected in both asymptomatic patients and patients with mild symptoms (Table 2 ). Other viruses were not analyzed because of small numbers of positivity. Overall, CoV and HRV/EV were associated with lower proportion of symptoms and PIV3, IV and RSV were associated with higher proportion of symptoms (Fig. 3) . RSVpositive surgical patients had more respiratory symptoms than other viruses had, though RSV was also identified in 3 patients without symptom. The proportion of symptoms presenting in the PSPs were lower in samples that tested positive for PIV3 than for IV, probably because of the inclusion of some asymptomatic patients with 29 of PIV3 infection. However, alveolar or interstitial infiltration was most frequently observed in PIV 3positive patients. The proportion of symptoms was lower for CoV infection than other viruses due to the presence of asymptomatic patients with 11 of CoV infection. A lower proportion of symptoms but higher rate of radiographic findings (alveolar or interstitial infiltration and pleural effusion) were found in HRV/EV-positive patients, though 70 of HRV/EV infections were identified in asymptomatic patients.",

PIV3 infection with a higher viral load was frequently found in PSPs presenting with mild symptoms, progressing to pneumonia with radiographic evidence after surgery. In the case of CoV (HKU1, OC43)-positive PSPs, the Ct values were significantly lower than for RSV and IV in patients with severe clinical symptoms supported by radiographic evidence (Mann-Whitney U test, p < 0.05, Fig. 4 ). CoV (OC43, HKU1) infections with a higher viral load were also observed in asymptomatic PSPs progressing to alveolar or interstitial infiltration. [15, 16] . These reported studies were limited to RSV, HRV/EV, and IV, possibly missing the other majority of respiratory viruses. In addition, these studies lacked quantitative analysis of viral pathogens in the PSPs. Though the frequency of symptomatic VRI was low, presence of VRI significantly prolonged postoperative recovery in children following surgery, as evidenced by longer LOS periods in hospitalization. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the infection rates and outcomes of both asymptomatic and symptomatic PSPs leading to VRI after surgery using qRT-PCR. As samples were taken not only from patients with symptoms of infection, but also from asymptomatic patients in this study, we were therefore able to explore the impact of viral testing in asymptomatic patients, which could help improve estimates of VRI in PSPs and further study of disease transmission modeling and forecasting. A total of 171 out of 1629 children (10.50%) were confirmed to have VRI with laboratory results, which is a considerably higher proportion than previous studies have identified. HRV/EV was the most common pathogen detected in 42.19% of PSPs, who had either mild symptoms or were asymptomatic, compared to previously reported 17% of asymptomatic controls and 22% of children with pneumonia enrolled at the same study sites during the same time period [19] . This might be owing to the high sensitivity of the proposed qRT-PCR assays identifying more viral pathogens. In this study, we also observed that HRV/EV were associated with prolonged shedding and the most commonly found coinfections were PIV3 and HRV/EV. These results are consistent with previous findings that HRV/EV co-infection or different HRV species co-infection were associated with acute respiratory illness hospitalization and that prolonged viral shedding over the course of 30 days was more commonly associated with respiratory viruses [9, [20] [21] [22] [23] . Because shedding of HRV can occur more than two weeks after infection [19] , it could be interpreted that HRV was the most commonly found co-infection pathogen in this study.",
