Since then, PDCoV has been identified in a number of U.S. states and linked with clinical disease including acute diarrhea and vomiting in the absence of other identifiable pathogens. Since PDCoV was just recently linked with clinical disease, few specific antibody-based reagents were available to assist in diagnosis of PDCoV and limited serological capabilities were available to detect an antibody response to this virus. Therefore, the overall objective of this project was to develop and validate selected diagnostic reagents and assays for PDCoV antigen and antibody detection. Results: The nucleoprotein of PDCoV was expressed as a recombinant protein and purified for use as an antigen to immunize mice for polyclonal, hyperimmune sera and monoclonal antibody (mAb) production. The resulting mAbs were evaluated for use in fluorescent antibody staining methods to detect PDCoV infected cells following virus isolation attempts and for immunohistochemistry staining of intestinal tissues of infected pigs. The same antigen was used to develop serological tests to detect the antibody response to PDCoV in pigs following infection. Serum samples from swine herds with recent documentation of PDCoV infection and samples from expected na\u00efve herds were used for initial assay optimization. The tests were optimized in a checkerboard fashion to reduce signal to noise ratios using samples of known status. Statistical analysis was performed to establish assay cutoff values and assess diagnostic sensitivities and specificities. At least 629 known negative serum samples and 311 known positive samples were evaluated for each assay. The enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed diagnostic sensitivity (DSe) of 96.1 % and diagnostic specificity (DSp) of 96.2 %. The fluorescent microsphere immunoassay (FMIA) showed a DSe of 95.8 % and DSp of 98.1 %. Both ELISA and FMIA detected seroconversion of challenged pigs between 8-14 days post-infection (DPI). An indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) test was also developed using cell culture adapted PDCoV for comparative purposes.",

A novel porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) was reported in China in 2012 and designated HKU15 [1] . Other important porcine coronaviruses include porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV); and are members of the genus Alphacoronavirus [2] . In February 2014, the Ohio Department of Agriculture announced the identification of PDCoV in swine feces at five farms in Ohio and associated with enteric disease similar to PEDV in the U.S. [3] . Since then, PDCoV has been identified in numerous U.S. states and Canada, linked with apparent clinical disease including acute diarrhea and vomiting in the absence of other identifiable pathogens. According to field observations in the U.S., PDCoV infections cause less severe clinical disease than PEDV, but analysis of the field data is complicated since co-infections with PEDV or other pathogens are common. PDCoV is currently diagnosed by real time PCR and clinical symptoms [1, 4] .",

Thachil et al. [8] developed an indirect anti-PDCoV IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on the S1 portion of the spike protein. Although this assay was shown to be a highly sensitive (91 %) and specific test (95 %), there is need for other ELISAs utilizing alternative antigen targets, such as the nucleoprotein of PDCoV, to serve as primary serological surveillance or confirmatory assays. As noted in Thachil's research, several serum samples collected in 2010 were found positive for PDCoV antibody by their ELISA, but all those collected in 2011 and 2012 tested negative by that assay. This finding is interesting since PDCoV was not thought to be circulating in North America prior to late 2013 [7, 9] . Therefore, availability of several serological assay formats targeting different viral antigens can be valuable as confirmatory assays in the investigation of unexpected laboratory findings.",

Prior to performing large scale coupling reactions for test validation, the optimization of the amount of antigen used was obtained by performing a checkerboard titration of antigen-coupled microspheres against a two-fold titration of swine serum. It was found that initiating a coupling reaction having 12.5ug of purified protein per 3.125 \u00d7 10 6 microspheres was optimal in obtaining the highest signal-to-noise fluorescence ratio. The performance of the FMIA test was described in detail previously by Okda et al. [11] . In the initial optimization of the FMIA test, we performed two-fold serial dilutions of swine serum and concluded that a dilution of 1:50 provided the highest signal-tonoise ratio. For the generation of sample fluorescence, antigen-coupled microsphere/antibody complexes were analyzed through a dual-laser Bio-Rad Bio-Plex 200 instrument. The median fluorescent intensity (MFI) for 100 microspheres corresponding to each individual bead analyte was recorded for each well. All reported MFI measurements were normalized by calculating individual S/P values using the following formula: S/P = MFI of sample -MFI of buffer control/MFI of high positive control -MFI of buffer control. The buffer control equated to the background signal determined from the fluorescence measurement of antigen-coated beads. Lastly, a single lot of pooled convalescent serum from PDCoV infected pigs was used to generate quality control standards that gave high, medium and low S/P values. The negative, low and medium samples served as internal quality standards while the high standard served as a serum constant to mathematically calculate S/P values of individual unknowns. For the FMIA, a high positive S/P = 0.8-1.0; medium S/P = 0.6-0.8; low S/P = 0.4-0.6; and negative S/P < 0.2, is consistent with the data of the ELISA standards.",

Antigen purity was then evaluated using SDS-PAGE in which the Histagged recombinant NP migrated through the gel according to its predicted molecular mass of 41 kDa upon staining with Coomassie brilliant blue R250 (Fig. 1a) . The recombinant protein was expressed in the form of insoluble inclusion bodies. It was purified by Nickel-NTA affinity column chromatography and yielded a calculated concentration of approximately 10 mg PDCoV-NP/liter of 2XYT medium and having a purity greater than 95 % as measured by the Lowry protein assay. The protein was subsequently refolded back to its soluble, conformational structure and its specificity was tested via Western blotting (Fig. 1b) . The figure illustrates the migration pattern and antigen specificity of the refolded PDCoV-NP/polyhistidine fusion protein as compared to the adjacent lane loaded with semi-purified, concentrated PDCoV. Both the rPDCoV-NP and native virus are recognized with equal intensity by a PDCoV-NP-specific monoclonal antibody (SD55-197) developed in our laboratory. Also, the recombinant nucleocapsid protein is shown to have a higher molecular mass than the native virus nucleocapsid due to its dual amino and carboxy terminus polyhistidine tags. Experiments were conducted to assess the immunoreactivity of refolded vs non-refolded PDCoV-NP antigen used for both tests. Specifically, an antibody capture titration ELISA was employed to compare the ability of a refolded and non-refolded version of the antigen to capture antibodies within swine serum. The immunoreactivity of antigen was determined by end-point titration and relative absorbance values as we observed differences in immunoreactivity based upon the conformational state of antigen tested. Figure 2 demonstrates in a dosedependent fashion, that as the concentration of each antigen coated well decreases, the refolded antigen imparts a greater degree of antibody capture efficacy of swine antibodies than the non-refolded version. Specifically, a 27 fold difference was calculated at the end of the linear portion of the curve indicating that the refolded protein maintained a marked enhancement of immunoreactivity resulting in a greater dynamic range of the assay.",

Specific antibodybased reagents and serological tests are essential for the further study and control of PDCoV, as well as the differentiation of PDCoV infection from other related coronaviruses such as PEDV or TGEV. Therefore, the primary objective of this study was to develop an initial generation of antibody-based diagnostic reagents and serological assays for the further study of PDCoV, including NP-based indirect ELISA and FMIA tests that were developed and validated for diagnostic applications. Specific antibody-based reagents were also not yet available for PDCoV so monoclonal antibodies against selected PDCoV structural proteins were developed.

Through extensive testing via ELISA (over 364 samples) and Western blot analysis, we were not able to demonstrate any cross-reactivity with other major swine coronaviruses including PEDV, PRCV and TGEV.

            "text": "Antibody responses to the nucleoprotein of coronaviruses are very robust and have been reported to appear as soon as 7-9 days post infection. We originally hypothesized that antibody reactivity to PDCoV may be conformationally dependent so we designed an experiment to determine whether NP specific immunodominant epitopes tend to be present in greater abundance on conformationally or linearly expressed antigen. A refolded version of the NP was used as an antigen in both assays as it was shown to impart a higher degree of immunoreactivity than its unfolded, linear counterpart. This phenomenon was also observed by Johnson et al. [20] whereby the authors compared reactivity differences among single point serum titrations to provide a surrogate measure of antibody titer. They showed that the enhancement of immunoreactivity of PRRSV-N and nsp1 was completely dependent on refolding, and the reactivity of nsp2P was enhanced by twofold. Furthermore we confirmed their observations that there is a loss of immunoreactivity when the linear protein (solubilized in 8 M urea) was dialyzed in PBS prior to coating on microtiter plates or used for coupling to FMIA microspheres. This may indicate that using an antigen in its more native conformational state may present a higher number of immunoreactive epitopes that are able to capture a larger percentage of PDCoV-NP antibodies. Therefore, the production of a well purified, refolded recombinant protein maintained in a near-native conformation was required for the production of an efficacious assay. Both assays provide the capability of high-throughput testing with reasonable DSe and DSp. ROC analysis was performed for both assays demonstrating DSe of greater than 95 %. The FMIA demonstrated good DSp of 98.1 % while the ELISA showed a slightly lower DSp of 96.2 %. Inter-rater (kappa) agreement, a statistical measure of test agreement demonstrated a significant level of agreement among the IFA, ELISA and FMIA. Furthermore, each of the antibody-capture assays was validated using a large number of well characterized serum samples (n = 940) based upon the suggested 5-stage validation methods of Jacobson, which is supported by the office International des Epizooties [21] .",

By following the methodology outlined by Jacobson [21] in which he recommends the inclusion of these initial ROC cut-off values from experimentally infected pigs, we demonstrated similar assay characteristics on chosen field samples which substantiated our final cut-off value of the assay. These sample sets were collected at approximately 3 weeks after initial diagnosis of PDCoV by PCR. It is possible that PDCoV may not move through a herd at the very rapid rate seen with PEDV. Therefore, some animals in some herds may not have been infected until a week or more after initial detection in the population, resulting in delayed seroconversion in a percentage of the presumed positive population. Likewise, since the initial origination and distribution of PDCoV in the U.S. is not fully understood at this time, it is possible that a small percentage of our presumed seronegative population may have been subject to prior exposure. Many of the samples in our presumed negative population were archived samples collected prior to 2009. However, some originated from recent field submissions from high health, biosecure herds with no clinical or PCR evidence of prior PDCoV or PEDV exposure. The observed DSp values of approximately 98 % for FMIA and 96 % for indirect ELISA are within the expected range for first generation assays using these test formats. Apparent false positive reactions could also be due to an epitope on the expressed antigen having commonality with another low prevalence infectious agent or due to low levels of residual E. coli protein contaminants in the purified antigen preparations.",

Although it is a reasonably sensitive (91 %) and specific (95 %) test, there is room for other ELI-SAs utilizing other target antigens, such as the NP of PDCoV, to serve as primary serological surveillance or confirmatory assays. As noted in Thachil's research, serum samples collected in 2010 were found positive for PDCoV antibody by their ELISA, but not those collected in 2011 and 2012. This was controversial because PDCoV was not thought to be circulating in North America in pigs before its identification in late 2013 [9] . It will be very beneficial to have confirmatory assays to validate this finding. Additional screening of archived historical swine serum samples using multiple serological assays may provide further insight into the origin and epidemiology of PDCoV in North America.",
