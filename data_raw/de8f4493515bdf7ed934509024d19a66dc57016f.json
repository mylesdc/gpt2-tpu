Fifteen patients (60.0 %) developed moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and 14 (56 %) died of the ARDS or multiorgan failure. Patients with longer delay between onset of illness and initiation of oseltamivir treatment were more likely to develop ARDS. Elevated C-creative protein, aspartate aminotransferase, creatine kinase, and lymphocytopenia predicted a higher risk of developing ARDS. Conclusions: The presence of underlying diseases and clinical complications predicted poor clinical outcome. Early oseltamivir treatment was associated with a reduced risk of developing ARDS.",

Several studies have suggested that the clinical outcomes for A (H7N9) patients correlate with severity of their symptoms, laboratory data, or important medical timelines. For example, severely affected patients showed a significantly longer interval from the onset of illness to antiviral treatment and to the negative conversion of A (H7N9) [4] . Patients who died tended to display elevated average levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) [5] . Chen and Shen have also reported that higher serum creatinine levels predicted poorer outcomes in patients infected with A (H7N9) [6, 7] . In a clinical study of 18 A (H7N9) patients, Lu et al. found that elevated C-creative protein (CRP) predicted patient mortality [8] . A negative correlation has also been observed between the severity of H7N9 infection and the percentage of lymphocytes [4] .",

This is of particular concern, as Guangzhou is a highly developed city in China with an advanced medical infrastructure, and the HA and NA sequences of the H7N9 viral isolates from Guangzhou patients are identical to those of H7N9 virus strains recently isolated from human patients in other areas (A/Anhui/1/2013, A/Shanghai/1/2013).

            "text": "This was a retrospective study focusing on the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients infected with A (H7N9) in Guangzhou. The clinical outcomes correlated strongly with the timing of oseltamivir treatment and with clinical and biochemical abnormalities. The fatality rate reported here was higher than that in the first epidemic wave in other parts of China (56 % vs. 34 %, respectively) [12] . This may be because 84 % of patients were identified with a surveillance of pneumonia of unknown etiology, which can have a substantially higher risk of mortality than mild cases identified with sentinel influenza-like illness or contract tracing surveillance [13] . The targeted surveillance of A (H7N9) patients is shown in (Fig. 2 ). An older median age and a high rate of underlying disease might have contributed to the high fatality rate in Guangzhou (Table 3 ). It is noteworthy that this explanation of the differences in the fatality rate is based on city-collected data. A nationwide database should be established to compare the characteristics of patients from different regions, to explore the possible factors contributing to the discrepancies in fatality rates from A (H7N9) infection.",

            "text": "Our A (H7N9) patients tended to have a high median age and were predominantly males (64 % male vs 36 % females). This pattern is consistent with the results of other studies [14] [15] [16] , but differs markedly from that of hospitalized A(H5N1) patients. According to a study by Liem et al., the median age of 67 patients with confirmed A(H5N1) viral infection was 25 years (range, [17] . The reasons for these different age distributions of patients with A(H5N1) and A (H7N9) are unclear. Several studies have suggested that heterosubtypic crossimmunity could partly explain the different age patterns [18, 19] . A(H5N1) shares the same neuraminidase subtype with A(H1N1) whereas A (H7N9) does not, so elderly people may have been exposed to the A(H1N1) virus during their lives and developed antibodies that cross-react with the A(H5N1), providing some protection against A(H5N1) infection [20] . Elderly patients may become infected with A (H7N9) because they are more likely than younger people to be exposed to live poultry and are more susceptible to the severe form of the disease [21] . The swab samples collected through the surveillance systems for A (H7N9) patients in Guangzhou were primarily from older patients, so it is also possible that younger patients were underreported. Our results show a detectably but insignificantly higher proportion of deaths among elderly patients with A (H7N9) in Guangzhou. The lack of significance might be attributable to the small sample size rather than to a lack of differences between the groups. A high proportion of patients reported concurrent medical conditions, which is consistent with the results of previous studies. Gao et al. analyzed 111 confirmed cases of A (H7N9) viral infection in patients with comorbidities in parallel with subjects with no underlying medical conditions and found that the presence of a comorbidity was associated with a greater risk of hospitalization with A (H7N9) infection (OR = 3.42, 95 % CI, 1.21-9.70) [21] . Several previous studies have shown that coexisting medical conditions can impair the host's response to A (H7N9) infection [22, 23] . Moreover, a reduced immune function can allow the survival of less-fit influenza strains, as reported by Nu\u00f1o et al. [24] . Although a higher proportion of patients with an underlying disease were detected in the group of patients who died than in the nonfatal group, the association between underlying disease and death was not statistically significant. However, patients who had any chronic cardiovascular disease were at higher risk of developing ARDS. Similar patterns have also beenc observed in patients with human influenza infection [25] .",

Two elderly patients were hospitalized due to neurological syndromes. The symptoms of A (H7N9) virus infection were covered up by the neurological syndromes which cause the delay for treatment. Given the high case fatality and features of patients in Guangzhou, it is important to remain on alert for those high risk people. Prior studies have suggested that the time of onset of symptoms may be associated with the fatal clinical outcomes. For example, Shinde reported fever, sore throat, and vomiting to be more common in fatal A(H5N1) cases than in nonfatal cases [28] . In the current case series, the clinical presentation at hospital admission in the fatal, nonfatal, ARDS, and NARDS groups were similar.",

A randomized placebo-controlled trial found the duration of influenza illness symptoms to be shorter in the oseltamivir group (median,3 days, IQR 1-5 days) than in placebo group (median, 4 days, IQR 1-6 days; P = 0.01) [33] .

Liu et al. collected information on 40 patients infected with A (H7N9) and found that elevated AST was significantly closely associated with their prognosis [5] . Hen reported that the AST levels of patients who died from A(H5N1) infection were significantly higher than those of survivors [36] . However, there was no relationship between elevated ALT and clinical outcome. This is because most patients (53.3 %) with normal ALT levels in our study displayed elevated AST. AST is a more sensitive index than ALT in assessing liver injury, and indicated the severe impairment of liver function among the patients with ARDS. Therefore, the negative results do not exclude a relationship between impaired liver function and poor clinical outcome. The laboratory data for humans infected with the A(H1N1) and A(H5N1) viruses shows visibly elevated CK, which predicts a severe, negative clinical outcome. This is consistent with the current results for A (H7N9) patients. In our case series, 60 % of patients showed elevated CK levels, and high CK levels strongly predicted the development of ARDS.",

A patient database that includes cross-regional data should be created. Furthermore, clinical information regarding oseltamivir treatment, such as the treatment schedule, is not given here in detail, and no information on the serum levels of inflammatory cytokines was available in our study because they were not routinely tested in the hospital. The host immunological response plays an important role in disease progression, especially in those who develop severe symptoms. Prospective studies are required to examine the relationship between serum inflammatory cytokine levels and the clinical outcomes of patients with A (H7N9). This case series may have been skewed toward more severe cases because only a small number of patients with mild cases that did not progress to ARDS were included. Therefore, a serological study is required to describe the spectrum of A (H7N9) infection in Guangzhou.",
