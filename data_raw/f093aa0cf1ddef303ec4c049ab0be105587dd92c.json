Differences in geographic, ecological, demographic, and socio economic conditions affect the region's differences in vulnerability to changing environ mental and climatic conditions. Projections of annual average temperature and mean precipitation predict significant changes overall, with disproportionally warmer winters in the north and warmer summers in the south (Giorgi et al. 2004) . Ambient temperature and precipitation patterns influence foodand water-borne diseases through effects on environ mental exposure pathways (Semenza et al. 2011a (Semenza et al. , 2011b . In addition, changes in seasonal precipitation and temperature influence vector-borne diseases through a) effects on vector survival, reproduction rates, habitat suitability, distribution, and abundance; b) the intensity and temporal pattern of vector activity (particularly biting rates); and c) rates of pathogen development, survival, and reproduction within vectors (Semenza and Menne 2009) . Thus, projected climate changes may shift the distributional ranges of vector-borne diseases.",

Moreover, complex transmission pathways interact with climatic and environmental factors and are thus often insufficiently understood (McMichael et al. 2006; Patz et al. 2005) . It is unlikely that the effect of climate change on a specific pathogen will be idio syncratic; rather, a multi tude of effects are likely to occur because pathogen dispersion, transport, fate, and environmental exposure pathways can all be altered by local climate and weather conditions (Boxall et al. 2009 ). Although infectious disease outbreaks have been linked to individual weather events, there have been few attempts to detect and attribute temporal trends in infectious diseases to climate change (Semenza et al. 2011b ). Many studies have projected future levels of disease spread in response to climate change, but there are currently no means for verifying the accuracy of these models.",

Data are based on the following survey question: \"Have you observed general changes of insect, tick, or rodentborne disease in your country over the last 10 years?\" Responses were recorded on a scale with five response options: strong increase; increase; no change; decrease; strong decrease. The first two responses (strong increase and increase) were grouped to reflect a positive response and the last two responses (decrease and strong decrease) were grouped to reflect a negative response. Both range expansion and contraction were documented for leishmaniasis in Portugal. Data were not available for 2007. .

In particular, respondents from northern countries, compared with those from southern countries, considered the edge of the geographic distribution limits of vectorborne diseases, such as Lyme borreliosis and TBE, to be susceptible to the effects of climate change ( Figure 1A,B) . This appraisal is consistent with findings from the peer-reviewed literature; for example, the main European tick vector, Ixodes ricinus, lives for several years and has been observed to have markedly changed its latitude distribution (northern Sweden) and altitude distribution (the Czech mountains) over the last 30 years (Daniel et al. 2009; Talleklint and Jaenson 1998) . These distribution changes have been reported to be correlated with changes in the length of seasons (Jaenson and Lindgren 2011) , climatic variations (Materna et al. 2005) , and the number of degree-days in different seasons with (Lindgren et al. 2000) . The experts who participated in the survey stated that with climate change, Lyme borreliosis is expected to change its altitude and latitude distribution ( Figure 1A ). This is in accordance with the literature regarding both observed relationships between climate variations and tick-borne disease incidence over the last four to five decades (Daniel et al. 2009; Kaiser 1995; Lindgren and Gustafson 2001) and projected changes (Jaenson and Lindgren 2011) , which estimate Lyme borreliosis becoming more prevalent in northern and central Europe and expanding to higher latitudes and altitudes. However, contributing factors other than climate, such as socio economic changes, may play important roles as well, particularly in central and eastern regions of Europe (Randolph 2008) .",

Respondents from northern European countries reported a potential increase in climate change risk, as opposed to those from southern European countries, where projected decreases in precipi ta tion could reduce these risks ( Figure 3B ). However, these observations also reflect reporting bias; those countries with better EU Cryptosporidium notifications reported a climate change risk, whereas those countries with incomplete (or no) Cryptosporidium notifications considered the risk to be low (Semenza and Nichols 2007) . In this expert survey, outbreaks of waterborne diseases were considered less likely to be affected by climate change than food-or vector-borne diseases. A total of 23 countries reported one or more water-borne disease outbreaks due to drinking water contamination in the last decade, with 12 reporting five or more outbreaks. For most countries, these numbers amounted to less than one outbreak every few years. No respondents thought that past waterborne disease outbreaks due to contaminated drinking water were attributable to actual climate change; however, extreme weather events due to climate variability could be implicated. Low numbers of outbreaks of water-borne diseases are a testament to high-quality water treatment in Europe, but this might also be due to under reporting because diarrheal symptoms are reported to health care providers only if they are severe.",

In our analysis we attempted to capture some of these planning and preparedness activities. The majority of experts (17 of 29) acknowledged research on climate-sensitive infectious diseases in their countries; however, few institutions are in place to monitor climatesensitive infectious diseases (14 of 29), and the majority of these institutions need improvement. Respondents from only seven countries indicated that their country had conducted a national climate change assessment that covered infectious diseases extensively or adequately, but one-third of the countries with a response plan were anticipating the need for increasing human and material resources to address risks from climate change ( Figure 4 and Table 3 ).",

Surveillance of potential new risk regions where climate-sensitive pathogens or disease vectors may become introduced and established is also of considerable importance, such as for dengue fever surveillance in the Mediterranean region.

However, no independent assessment of their professional or academic expertise was conducted. The data collected were not subjected to third-party verification and might thus contain inaccuracies and misconstructions. Nevertheless, we compared the different survey results with data from the peer-reviewed literature and the national reports sent to the UNFCCC (2010). The survey result was remarkably consistent with the other sources we examined, with the exception of foodborne diseases, which highlights potential food security issues (food safety, food production, etc.) related to climate change. This expert assessment of national representatives likely corresponds with the government opinion on this topic. Although the data represent perceived impacts, our expert analysis can also shed light on the extent of scientific consensus and thus inform public policy (Van Rij 2010).",

National expert opinion concerning risks of vectorand water-borne diseases from climate change matched well with data from the peer-reviewed literature, but less well for food-borne diseases where the causal link has a range of potential confounders. National climate change assessments were reported mainly from Western Europe, and a number of institutional weaknesses were identified, such as research on and control of climate-sensitive infectious diseases. Most noticeable, however, was the need to improve current surveillance of infectious diseases. Current deficiencies are of particular concern given budgetary shortfalls for infectious disease programs during economic crises, as we documented recently (Rechel et al. 2011; Suhrcke et al. 2011) . The ECDC developed a handbook for climate change impact, vulnerability, and adaptation assessment to assist member states with this process (ECDC 2010b). Ultimately, vigilant surveillance, the cornerstone of public health practice, will likely be ever more important for addressing climate change threats. , as to the effectiveness of institutions, health services, and surveillance pro grams for vector, water, and foodborne diseases by EEA countries.
