This study intended to clarify whether DV infection could induce autophagy in vivo. Furthermore, the effect of DV induced autophagy on viral replication and DV-related pathogenesis was investigated. Results and conclusions: The physiopathological parameters were evaluated after DV2 was intracranially injected into 6-day-old ICR suckling mice. Autophagy-related markers were monitored by immunohistochemical/ immunofluorescent staining and Western blotting. Double-membrane autophagic vesicles were investigated by transmission-electron-microscopy. DV non-structural-protein-1 (NS1) expression (indicating DV infection) was detected in the cerebrum, medulla and midbrain of the infected mice. In these infected tissues, increased LC3 puncta formation, LC3-II expression, double-membrane autophagosome-like vesicles (autophagosome), amphisome, and decreased p62 accumulation were observed, indicating that DV2 induces the autophagic progression in vivo. Amphisome formation was demonstrated by colocalization of DV2-NS1 protein or LC3 puncta and mannose-6 -phosphate receptor (MPR, endosome marker) in DV2-infected brain tissues. We further manipulated DV-induced autophagy by the inducer rapamycin and the inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3MA), which accordingly promoted or suppressed the disease symptoms and virus load in the brain of the infected mice. We demonstrated that DV2 infection of the suckling mice induces autophagy, which plays a promoting role in DV replication and pathogenesis.",

It is transmitted to vertebrate hosts via the mosquito vector Aedes aegypti and A. albopictus. DV causes over 390 million infections every year, and is one of the most important arboviruses causing human diseases [1] . The symptoms of DV infection range from mild dengue fever (DF) to life-threatening dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Generally speaking, DF is self-limited, but in a small proportion of people the disease may proceed to severe DHF/DSS. Diverse hypotheses have been proposed to explain the pathologic mechanism of DHF/DSS, but the findings remain contradictory.",

Autophagy is characterized by a double-membrane vesicle known as an autophagosome, which recruits cytoplasmic materials and fuses with lysosome for protein degradation [2] . Autophagy is classified as macroautophagy, microautophagy, and chaperon-mediated autophagy, depending on how it delivers the cargo to lysosome and its physiological function [3] . Aberrant autophagic activities lead to the pathogenesis of various diseases, including diabetes, neurodegeneration, heart disease, and cancers. Tian et al., reported that autophagy was detected in brain sections of a GFP-LC3 transgenic mouse model after transient cerebral ischemia and demonstrated a relationship between autophagy and apoptosis [4, 5] . Dengue virus infection induces apoptosis in various cell lines and clinical patient specimens [6] . However, dengue virus-induced apoptosis and its relationship with autophagy remain to be determined.",

During vesicle elongation, two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems are activated. First, Atg12 is covalently conjugated with Atg5 by E1-like enzyme Atg7 and E2-like enzyme Atg10. Second, Atg5 binds to Atg16L1, a coiled-coil domain-containing protein, to form a heterotrimeric complex, Atg5-Atg12-Atg16L1. This complex is responsible for the expansion of the phagophore and is dissociated from the membrane when autophagosome formation is completed. Microtubuleassociated protein 1A/1B light chain 3 (LC3) (mammalian homologue of yeast Atg8) is initially cleaved by Atg4, a cysteine protease, followed by phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) modification on the carboxyl terminus of the cleaved LC3 [11] . The lipidated LC3 located on the membrane facilitates autophagosome maturation. The autophagosome may fuse with the endosome to form the amphisome or with the lysosome to form the autophagolysosome [12] [13] [14] .",

Autophagy acts as an anti-viral component of the innate immune system and is induced by the ligands of the toll-like receptors [16] . Furthermore, autophagy enhances the presentation of viral antigens by dendritic cells during the infection of Sendai and vesicular stomatitis viruses [17] . Autophagy can also function in the adaptive immune response by enhancing the presentation of antigen onto MHC class II molecules [18] [19] [20] . Autophagy not only plays an antiviral role, but also shows pro-viral functions [21, 22] . Poliovirus, coxsackievirus B3, hepatitis C virus (HCV), coronavirus, enterovirus 71 and DV activate autophagy to elevate viral replication [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] . HCV uses autophagy for the early protein translation and suppresses the innate antiviral immunity [23, 29] . The double membrane of the autophagosome may support poliovirus replication [30] , and the autophagic machinery is utilized for the replication of coronaviruses [25, 31] . DV infection increases autophagic activity to enhance viral replication, indicating the use of autophagosome as the docking site for viral replication complex or as the organelle for lipid metabolism to provide ATP energy for DV replication [25, [32] [33] [34] [35] . Autophagy induction by NS4A protein of DV prevents the infected cell from death and enhances viral replication [35] . While it is known that autophagy plays an important role in DV replication in vitro, the role of autophagy in vivo has not been reported. This study focused on autophagic activity, virus titer and pathogenesis in DV2 infection of the suckling mice.",

In order to establish the role of DV2 infection in the induction of autophagy as well as its roles in DV replication and DV-related pathogenesis in vivo, DV2 or UV-inactivated DV2 (iDV2) (2.5\u00d710 5 pfu/mouse) was intracranially injected into six-day-old ICR suckling mice. The body weight, clinical score, and survival rate of the infected mice were measured daily for seven days. The body weight of DV2-infected mice was greatly decreased from day 5 to day 7 post infection (p.i) as compared to the mockinfected and iDV2-infected groups ( Figure 1A ). The disease symptoms progressed from mild sickness (losing weight and ruffled hair) at days 2 and 3 to severe paralysis and mortally ill at day 5 p.i., and mice started to die in the DV2-infected group, whereas no deaths were noted in the mock-and iDV2-treated groups at day 6 p.i. (Figure 1B) . The survival rate in the DV2-infected mice was 40% at day 6 p.i and all of the mice died at day 7 p.i., but no mice died in the other two groups ( Figure 1C ). To verify that the abovementioned disease symptoms were indeed caused by dengue virus infection, NS1 protein, an indicator of DV infection, was detected by anti-NS1 antibody in the brain tissues, including the cerebrum, medulla and midbrain of the infected mice, but no NS1 antigen was seen in the cerebellum and pons ( Figure 1D , arrow). Altogether, DV2 was shown to be capable of infecting the brain tissue of the ICR mice, and of causing severe disease symptoms leading to death.",

In order to establish that autophagy was induced in these DV2-infected mice, aggregation (puncta formation) of endogenous LC3 protein (a marker of autophagy) and DV2 NS1 expression in the brain tissue were assessed. The increased green fluorescent LC3 puncta, representing autophagosome formation, and the increased red fluorescent, representing DV-NS1 expression, were detected in the DV2-infected mice brain as compared to levels found in the mock-infected mice (Figure 2A , lower panels). Furthermore, colocalization of green LC3 puncta and red DV2-NS1 was seen in the brain sections of the infected mice (Figure 2A, arrow) , suggesting that autophagosome formation was induced and that NS1, as a component of the replication complex working in concert with autophagosomes, may participate in DV replication. The expression levels of DV2 NS1 and LC3 II protein (a marker of autophagosome formation) in the brain were increased only in DV2-infected mice at days 5 and 6 p.i. compared with mock-and iDV2-infected mice.

This finding indicates that autophagy induction requires active DV infection and/or replication. Beclin 1, a coiled-coil protein, interacts with Bcl-2 and plays a critical role during autophagy progression [37] . However, in this in vivo study, Beclin 1 expression was not changed either in infected or in mock-infected mice brains by Western blotting at days 3, 5 and 6 p.i. and IHC assay at day 5 p.i. (Additional file 1: A and B, arrow) . In summary, the role of Beclin 1 in DV2-induced autophagy requires further confirmation. The double-membrane autophagosome-like vesicles (V) were detected in the brain tissue of DV2infected mice ( Figure 3C , 3D and 3E, arrow), but not in the mock-infected group (Mock) (Figure 3A and 3B) under transmission electron microscopy. This doublemembrane ultrastructure further supports the result showing that DV induces autophagy in vivo. We further detected the colocalization of green LC3 puncta and red MPR in the brain tissue of DV2-infected mice, indicating fusion of endosome with autophagosome to form amphisome ( Figure 4A , arrow). We also observed the colocalization of DV2 NS1 (red) and MPR (green fluorescence, a marker of endosome) protein in brain sections under fluorescent microscopy, indicating that DV2 existed in the endosome ( Figure 4B, arrow) , which is consistent with an in vitro investigation by Panyasrivanit et al. that showed dengue virus was recruited into the endosome, which was then fused with the autophagosome to form amphisomes [36] . The data described above demonstrate that DV2 infection in vivo can induce autophagy and amphisome formation.",

The degradation of p62 has been used as an indicator of autophagic progression from autophagosome to autophagolysosome. To further confirm that DV2 infection indeed induces autophagic progression in vivo, the kinetics of LC3, p62, and NS1 expression level in two representative mice were evaluated at days 3 and day 5 p.i. by Western blotting. When the expression level of LC3II was induced at days 3 and 5 p.i., Figure 2 Dengue-2 virus infection induces LC3 puncta formation and increases LC3 II expression in the mouse brain tissue. As in Figure 1 , DV2 was injected into the six-day-old suckling mice. (A) At day 5 p.i., the brain tissues were sectioned and the expression of DV2-NS1 and LC3 in the mouse brain tissue was determined with anti-DV NS1 and anti-LC3 antibodies by IFA staining under the confocal microscope (Olympus FluoView 1000). DAPI was used to stain the nucleus of the cell. Arrow points indicate the colocalization of NS1 and LC3. (B) The brain tissues of the mice used in (A) were harvested and total protein lysate was collected at various times p.i. and analyzed by Western blotting to measure the expression of DV2-NS1 and LC3 with the anti-DV NS1 and anti-LC3 antibodies. The numbers under each band are the quantification of LC3II band intensity after normalization with \u03b2-actin. the expression of p62 was decreased in the DV2-infected group compared to that of the mock-infected group ( Figure 5 , 0.59 vs. 0.94 and 0.70 vs. 0.83, respectively). Furthermore, 3-MA was used to block DV2-induced autophagy, and the degradation level of p62 was reversed in the DV2 infection group at days 3 and day 5 p.i. (Figure 5 , 0.73 vs. 0.59 at day 3, and 1.00 vs. 0.7 at day 5). These data indicate that an autophagic flux was induced during DV2 infection in vivo. Taken together, these findings demonstrate formation of amphisome and autophagosome, as well as the autophagic flux were induced in the DV2-infected brain tissues of the mice.",

To further investigate the effect of autophagy on DV2-related pathogenesis, mice were pretreated with 3-MA (80\u03bcg/g), rapamycin (0.15\u03bcg/g), or PBS (Mock) by intracranial injection two hours before DV2 infection. The expression of LC3-II protein was suppressed by about 18% at days 3 and 5 p.i. in the 3-MA treated group (DV2+3MA) as compared to that of the DV2-infected group ( Figure 5) . The viral titer in the brain of the mice pre-treated with 3-MA was not significantly decreased at days 3 and 5 p.i. ( Figure 6A ). However, in the group treated with autophagy inducer rapamycin (DV2+Rapa), the viral titer was significantly elevated as compared to that of the DV infection group at day 5 p.i. (Figure 6B ). Furthermore, with the addition of 3-MA to block autophagy, the clinical scores were decreased at days 5 and day 6 p.i. in the DV2-infected mice (DV2+3MA) as compared to that of the DV2 infection and mock infection groups ( Figure 7A ). Accordingly, in the presence of the autophagy inducer rapamycin, the clinical scores of DV2 infection group (DV2+Rapa) were significantly increased at day 5 p.i. compared to those of the DV2 infection and mock infection groups ( Figure 7B ). The survival rate of DV2-infected mice that received 3-MA treatment was increased to 40% as compared to 20% in the DV2 infection group at day 6 p.i. (Figure 7C ). In contrast, the survival rate of the rapamycin-treated group (DV2+Rapa) dropped to 40% as compared to 71% in the DV2 infection group at day 5 p.i. ( Figure 7D ). Both 3-MA and rapamycin showed no effect on DV2 infection-related loss of body weight in the mice (Additional file 2: A and B). In summary, regulation of autophagy in vivo during dengue virus infection could influence physiopathological parameters, including disease symptoms, survival rate, and viral titer.",

The latter can occur with the inhibition of their maturation to amphisomes or autolysosomes, which happens if there are defects in the fusion with endosomes or lysosomes, respectively, or following inefficient degradation of the cargo once fusion has occurred [44] .

Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) induces the formation of autophagosomes without promoting lysosome-mediated protein degradation [27, 45] . In contrast, HIV-1, Influenza A virus, and HCV infection impair autophagic flux [45] . HCV does not eliminate long-lived protein through autophagic degradation [45, 46] . We have demonstrated that DV2 infection triggers autophagic flux and DV2-induced autophagosome is favorable for viral replication in hepatoma cells [25] . Panyasrivanit et al. further showed that DV2 titer is increased by blocking autophagic flux using fusion blocker L-asparagine, suggesting that the autophagic flux process decreases DV2 titer [36] .",

This result is consistent with the finding of our previous in vitro study [25] . Nevertheless, whether Beclin 1 participates in DV-mediated autophagy needs further investigation. We further demonstrated that manipulation of autophagy affects DV2 infection-related pathogenesis, including disease symptoms, survival rate, and virus titer by the autophagy inhibitor, 3-MA, which suppresses the PI3K class III signaling pathway and autophagic activity, and the autophagy inducer rapamycin, which blocks the mTOR signaling pathway. Although encephalitis and neuronal involvement in dengue virus infection are rare, this suckling mice model provides a unique system to clarify dengue-mediated autophagy in vivo. While the autophagy inhibitor 3-MA suppressed LC3II expression, it could not significantly suppress virus titer at days 3 and day 5 p.i. in vivo (Figures 5 and 6A) . It is known that 3-MA plays dual roles in autophagy [49] . Under starvation conditions, 3-MA suppresses PI3K class III and inhibits autophagy; however, under normal conditions, 3-MA promotes autophagic flux. Therefore, the treatment conditions of 3-MA needed to be further optimized to increase its inhibitory effect on autophagy. In summary, manipulation of autophagy by 3-MA and rapamycin affects clinical scores, survival rate, as well as DV2 titer in vivo. A recent report demonstrated that DV-NS4A expression induces autophagosome formation during dengue virus infection, and promotes the infected cells to avoid apoptotic cell death, which thus contributes to viral replication [35] . Therefore, whether suppression of DV-mediated autophagy by 3-MA induces infection-mediated apoptosis and further reduces the replication of dengue virus requires further confirmation.",
