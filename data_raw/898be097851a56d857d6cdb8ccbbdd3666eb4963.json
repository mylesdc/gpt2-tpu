Likewise, KineFold is an elaborate local folding model that handles sequential 5' to 3' folding [8, 9] . Notable in these latter two methods is that realistic considerations about the three dimensional (3D) structure of a pseudoknot and polymer dynamics are seriously considered in the models. However, convergence for all these folding algorithms is typically slow and except for Cao et al. (which is 6 N ), not necessarily guaranteed. Other techniques consist of alignment of sequence or structure. One of the earlier systematic approaches employed maximum weight matching (MWM) for sequence alignment including pseudoknots [10]. More recently, dynamic MWM [11] has also been proposed. These can run rather fast, but suffer some loss of accuracy. A hybrid method of loop matching with thermodynamics and sequence alignment known as iterative loop matching (ILM) is a significant extension of the original MWM approach [12]. PSTAG is a structure alignment technique using pair stochastic tree adjoining grammars [13]; an approach that has its origins in studies in language processing [14]. A language processing strategy is potentially powerful [14,15]; however, they are rather costly in time complexity ( 5 N ) and memory ( 4 N ) [13]. A simplified approach that applies only the parsing part of this procedure was also developed with some success [16]. Of these alignment strategies, ILM claims the smallest time complexity ( 4 N ) and memory ( 3 N ). Recently, a hybrid method has been developed that employs other methods to gain a consensus for H-type pseudoknots [17]. The last two groups involve exact thermodynamic models that follow in the tradition of the secondary structure calculations. Of these, the first group finds only the mFE with no suboptimal structures. The most precise model, PKNOTS, that guarantees the minimum free energy is computationally costly in time ( 6 N ) and memory ( 4 N ) [18]. Recently, a simplified approach has been developed that sacrifices some detail by applying canonical rules but only requires a time of 4 N and memory 2 N [19]. Knowledge of the structural features of typical pseudoknots is used in this approach to help in the search and reduce the search space [19]. The final strategy follows in the traditions of partition functions for secondary structure [20] and therefore provides the possibility of suboptimal structure prediction [21].This approach sacrifices some detail and has a costly time complexity ( 6 N ).",

Because such recursive optimizations are done every time (even though past successful solutions are already known), it is currently a major design inefficiency. An ameliorating factor is that this search is limited to a finite number of recursive hops. Theoretically, reusing these solutions reduces the time complexity to as small as [28] .

With the ePK, a pair of blue stems would form first and these would then fuse together. With a cPK, linkage would be added successively to the structure. Generally, in this model, a stand-alone linkage stem requires independent stability of whatever internal structure is inside.

Presently, vsfold5 does not look inside of its own pseudoknots for more pseudoknots. It is assumed that pseudoknots build up modularly inside of one another, if they build up at all in this way, and we need not concern ourselves with modules deep inside the superstructure until we need to unwrap them. Moreover, the types of structures likely to satisfy even this are small because of steric hindrance of jamming two stems in a loop and folding such a structure. This would only be more problematical for joining d 1 and d n (Fig. S13 ) together. Perhaps with sufficient length, a circle could be made that would satisfy all the physical requirements. To handle this prediction problem, we would need to add exit tags for domains in the lookup table and apply them in the same way as the neck-exit-tags. Currently, aside from the aspect of theoretical curiosity, such matters, though in principle doable, have not been opened in the current architecture of the program. For Figure S15e , for the pattern ABCADBECDE [24] , currently vsfold5 can chose either B or C, but not both from the general pathway of folding domain 1 and 2 first. Estimating from the general tendency of the free energy rules, stem C is probably more likely. In short, we don't currently ask PKs to examine themselves. Nevertheless, there is an alternative pathway shown in Fig.   S16 that can succeed with this structure. Hence, the order is a crucial factor in this model. Even this can be remedied with little additional cost in time complexity, were this deemed critical in prediction problems.",

First the free strand (orange) connecting the linkage stem (red) is rather short to accommodate the large rigid structure that is being forced on the space. Worse is that the root stem (blue) is filled up with the linkage stem. Neither can the root domain make up the difference because it is already bending under the strain of a tight loop. Second, the loop regions on both halves are short, so there is no flexible free play between the forming strands. Over 5 bps, the twist in the stem is roughly 180 o , and when this must be coupled with such a short loop, there is no room to accommodate either part well. Finally, nucleic acids have negatively charged phosphates that must be compensated by divalent cations in tight configurations, yet there is hardly any surface area where such divalent cations can rest long enough to have much impact on the stability.

A partition function calculation tells us the distribution of states. We have shown that the distribution of similar structures is sorted far better using the same strategy used by vsfold4 and 5 (see Refs. [41, 42] ). That study included rRNA (1534 nt). From these studies, we saw not only that we could obtain a better selection of the right structure from the solution set; we saw that all similar structures tended to group together with that structure.",

By this we mean that when the domain size exceeds a certain limit (a function of the Kuhn length), there is no further change in the predicted structure [41, 42] . This does not mean that vsfold5 picks the correct structures in that domain; rather, beyond a certain length, it does not corrupt whatever structure was predicted. In general, this means that a user who selects a poor (5' to 3') sequence fragment to study and a poor Kuhn length can still obtain some useful information from vsfold5; though the utility of the calculation is often greatly diminished. This stability is a feature that no other approach can claim. Therefore, we have managed to address part of the major issue raised in Ref. [22] . Because we have achieved stability, we can now begin to address the other major problems.",
