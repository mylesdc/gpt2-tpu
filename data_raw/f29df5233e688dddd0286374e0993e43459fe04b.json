            "text": "Background: In diabetes mellitus the morbidity and mortality of cardiovascular disease is increased and represents an important independent mechanism by which heart disease is exacerbated. The pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy involves the enhanced activation of PPAR transcription factors, including PPAR\u03b1, and to a lesser degree PPAR\u03b2 and PPAR\u03b31. How these transcription factors are regulated in the heart is largely unknown. Recent studies have described post-translational ubiquitination of PPARs as ways in which PPAR activity is inhibited in cancer. However, specific mechanisms in the heart have not previously been described. Recent studies have implicated the musclespecific ubiquitin ligase muscle ring finger-2 (MuRF2) in inhibiting the nuclear transcription factor SRF. Initial studies of MuRF2\u2212/\u2212 hearts revealed enhanced PPAR activity, leading to the hypothesis that MuRF2 regulates PPAR activity by post-translational ubiquitination.",

            "text": "The leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide is cardiovascular disease [1] , frequently accompanied by the dysregulation of fatty acid metabolism associated with diabetes mellitus (DM). In the presence of DM, the morbidity and mortality of cardiovascular disease is increased and represents an important independent mechanism by which heart disease is exacerbated [2, 3] . The characteristic disturbances in myocardial energy and fatty acid homeostasis found in DM are mediated primarily by a network of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) transcription factors that direct the energy substrates and determine the myocardial homeostasis [4, 5] . Chronic activation of PPARs in DM leads to an increase in free fatty acid uptake/oxidation corresponding to the level of insulin resistance in cardiomyocytes [6] . The increased reliance on fatty acid metabolism decreases the efficiency of the heart by increasing the amount of oxygen needed to create the needed energy, resulting in lipotoxicity [7] . The ligand (fatty acid)-driven activation of PPAR transcription factors regulate the expression of target genes, which control the uptake, utilization, oxidation, and storage of fatty acids [8] . In the heart, all three PPAR receptors have been identified (PPAR\u03b1, PPAR\u03b4/\u03b2, and PPAR\u03b3) and implicated in cardiovascular disease [9] .",

High systemic fatty acid uptake also inhibits Akt signaling, resulting in the downregulation of forkhead box O (FOXO) transcription factors [16, 17] , while the increased ROS activate nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) [18] , both of which contribute to the development of cardiac hypertrophy [12, 19] .",

This family of proteins is found in striated muscle, including skeletal and cardiac myocytes and was originally found to be a critical regulator of microtubule assembly during models of skeletal muscle development [21, 22] . Recent studies have detailed the importance of MuRF2 in the earliest stages of skeletal muscle differentiation and myofibrillogenesis in vivo [23] . In the present study, we identify that endogenous cardiomyocyte MuRF2 inhibits multiple PPAR isoforms, primarily PPAR\u03b3 (but to a lesser extent PPAR\u03b4/\u03b2 and PPAR\u03b1). Given the relative importance of PPARs in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy and the downstream pathophysiology, we challenged MuRF2\u2212/\u2212 mice to a 60% fat diet-induced cardiomyopathy recently described [24, 25] . With PPAR signaling at the center of regulating fatty acid oxidation and mediating the pathogenesis of type 2 DM induced cardiomyopathy, we hypothesized that if MuRF2\u2212/\u2212 hearts had enhanced PPAR signaling, they would undergo an accelerated cardiomyopathy due to MuRF2's direct regulation of PPAR activity. We identified that MuRF2\u2212/\u2212 hearts undergo an exaggerated diabetic cardiomyopathy, resulting from MuRF2's multi-ubiquitination of PPAR\u03b1 and PPAR\u03b31 in a proteasome-independent (non-degradatory) mechanism. These studies identify the first ubiquitin ligase to regulate PPAR via post-translational ubiquitination.",

Values are expressed as mean \u00b1 SE. Statistical analysis on metabolomics data was performed as previously described [36, 37] . Metaboanalyst (v2.0) run on the statistical package R (v2.14.0) used metabolite peaks areas (as representative of concentration) [38, 39] . These data were first analyzed by an unsupervised principal component analysis (PCA), which identified the presence of the MuRF2\u2212/\u2212 after 26 weeks high fat diet as the principal source of variance. To sharpen the separation between our three groups, data were next analyzed using a partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) to further determine which metabolites were responsible for separating these two groups. The specific metabolites contributing most significantly to the differences identified by PLS-DA between MuRF2\u2212/\u2212 and wildtype control group hearts were determined using the variable importance in projection (VIP) analysis in the Metaboanalyst 2.0 environment. The metabolites that best differentiated the groups were then individually tested using the Student's t-test (Microsoft Excel 2011, Seattle, WA, USA). The VIP and t test significant metabolites were matched to metabolomics pathways using the Pathway Analysis feature in Metaboanalyst 2.0. Heat maps of the metabolite data (individual and grouped) were generated using the GENE E software (http://www.broadinstitute. org/cancer/software/GENE-E/index.html).",

            "text": "We have recently identified that MuRF2, a muscle-specific ubiquitin ligase, is a critical factor that regulates cardiomyocyte size during development in concert with MuRF1 [40] . MuRF2 has also been described as the effector protein in the Titin-nbr1-p62 complex that responds to mechanical changes in the sarcomere to inhibit transactivation of the nuclear transcription factor serum response factor (SRF) [41] . MuRF2's regulation of the nuclear specific SRF was the first indication that MuRF2, found primarily in the cytoplasm, could regulate the activity of nuclear receptors, presumably through direct interaction, ubiquitination, and apparent nuclear export [41] . These findings led us to hypothesize that MuRF2 similarly regulates other nuclear receptors critical to cardiomyocytes. To test this, we used MuRF2\u2212/\u2212 mice previously characterized without a cardiac or skeletal muscle phenotype [26] . However, we recently identified that MuRF2\u2212/\u2212 hearts exhibited changes in metabolomics signatures, indicating that changes in metabolism are present despite any functional effect at baseline [37] . We initially assayed isolated nuclei from MuRF2\u2212/\u2212 hearts for their DNA-binding activity contributed by PPAR\u03b1, PPAR\u03b2, and PPAR\u03b3 as the PPARs have been best described in altering cardiac metabolism [42] and have been reported to be regulated by ubiquitination [43] . To our surprise, we found that MuRF2\u2212/\u2212 hearts had significantly increased PPAR activities, with increases in PPAR\u03b1 (+twofold), PPAR\u03b2 (~1.6 fold), and PPAR\u03b3 (over +fourfold) activities compared with sibling MuRF2+/+ control mice (Fig. 1a) . These findings suggested that endogenous MuRF2 attenuated the activity of all three PPAR transcription factors found in cardiomyocytes. Since MuRF2 is an ubiquitin ligase and PPAR transcription factors have been described with post-translational modification by ubiquitin, we hypothesized that MuRF2 may regulate these PPAR transcription factors in a ubiquitination-dependent manner.",

            "text": "Echocardiographic analysis of MuRF2\u2212/\u2212 hearts at baseline found no deficits in function or differences in measurements ( Fig. 2a ; Table 1 ) as previously described [40, 46] . Significant deficits in heart function were identified in the MuRF2\u2212/\u2212 hearts in as little as 6 weeks after the initiation of high fat diet ( Fig. 2b, d) . Both MuRF2\u2212/\u2212 and wildtype mice experienced an equal progressive dilation over time on a high fat diet, evidenced by increases in LVESD (Fig. 2a, far right panel) . MuRF2\u2212/\u2212 hearts exhibited significant dysfunction as early as 6 weeks of HFD compared to MuRF2+/+ hearts (Fig. 2b) . MuRF2\u2212/\u2212 hearts were significantly larger than MuRF2+/+ hearts after 26 weeks high fat diet (Fig. 2b-d) . Diabetic cardiomyocyte-related changes in myosin heavy chain gene expression were next investigated to determine differences between groups. Comparable increases in \u03b2MHC were seen in MuRF2\u2212/\u2212 and wildtype hearts (Fig. 2e) , consistent with previous studies identifying these increases [47] . MuRF2\u2212/\u2212 cardiac expression of skeletal muscle \u03b1-actin and \u03b1MHC were increased in chow control hearts compared to wild type mice, and MuRF2\u2212/\u2212 skeletal muscle \u03b1-actin was significantly increased as compared to wild type mice after 26 weeks high fat diet (Fig. 2e) . No difference existed in \u03b1MHC after 26 weeks of high fat diet in either MuRF2\u2212/\u2212 or MuRF2 +/+ mice (Fig. 2e) , although this is reported in other models of diabetic cardiomyopathy [48, 49] . Brain natriuretic protein (BNP) mRNA was decreased in both MuRF2\u2212/\u2212 and controls after 26 weeks high fat diet feeding (Fig. 2e) . Taken together, these studies identified that MuRF2\u2212/\u2212 hearts failed sooner than MuRF2+/+ hearts, resulting in larger hearts, including LV wall thickness and heart weights after 26 weeks high fat diet challenge. LV remodeling is a distinctive finding in the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy. These changes include the development of fibrosis, resulting from the accumulation of extracellular collagen [50, 51] . Reduced MMP2 activity [52] and O-GlcNAcylation stimulated cardiac fibroblast collagen synthesis has been reported [53] . In this particular model, less than 2% fibrosis was identified throughout the heart in MuRF2\u2212/\u2212 and wildtype controls (Fig. 3a) . However, MuRF2\u2212/\u2212 hearts revealed a parallel reduction in vimentin-positive fibroblasts (Fig. 3b) at 21 weeks of high fat diet. This wildtype mouse, interestingly, revealed almost 4% fibrosis (Additional file 2: Figure S2c ) with amorphous waxy infiltrates and leukocyte infiltrates (Additional file 2: Figure S2b ) not seen in either MuRF2\u2212/\u2212 or wildtype hearts after 26 weeks high fat diet (Additional file 2: Figure S2a ). Overall, while MuRF2\u2212/\u2212 hearts have significant increases in fibrosis, the total fibrosis is minimal and does not account for the large changes in cardiac size, dysfunction, and suggests other non-structural signaling pathways likely are involved in the MuRF2\u2212/\u2212 exaggerated cardiac dysfunction in diabetic cardiomyopathy.",

Like the PPAR isoform activities assays of the MuRF2\u2212/\u2212 heart nuclei demonstrated, MuRF2\u2212/\u2212 hearts exhibited enhanced PPAR activities. At the mRNA level, MuRF2\u2212/\u2212 hearts exhibited significant increases in PPAR\u03b1 compared with wildtype mice, but no differences in PPAR\u03b2 or PPAR\u03b31 (Additional file 3: Figure S3 ). Fatty acids are the primary fuel of the heart in addition to being ligands for the PPAR transcription factors. High fat diets have been reported to increase cardiac triglyceride content [57] . The increased storage fat (as myocardial triglyceride) that occurs in the development of type 2 diabetic cardiomyopathy has been hypothesized as one mechanism that free fatty acids are toxic to the heart [58] [59] [60] . The mishandling of cardiac glycogen is also a frequent manifestation of diabetic cardiomyopathy [61] . We hypothesized that increased levels of fatty acid in the MuRF2\u2212/\u2212 hearts could contribute to the enhanced heart failure they demonstrated in diabetic cardiomyopathy. Since MuRF2 has been reported in the heart and skeletal muscle, in addition to the liver, we measured cardiac triglycerides and glycogen after 26 weeks of high fat diet to determine if alterations in these storage forms of fat and glucose could be contributing to the increased heart weight or dysfunction in the MuRF2\u2212/\u2212 hearts (Fig. 5 ). Compared to the control feeding, both MuRF2\u2212/\u2212 and MuRF2+/+ hearts had increased cardiac triglyceride levels (Fig. 5a) . However, MuRF2\u2212/\u2212 hearts did not have significantly different triglyceride levels compared with wildtype after 26 weeks high fat diet feeding. MuRF2\u2212/\u2212 liver and skeletal muscle after 26 weeks high fat diet feeding was similarly not significantly different from wildtype controls (Fig. 5a) . MuRF2\u2212/\u2212 hearts from dietary controls (chow) had significantly decreased cardiac glycogen compared with wildtype hearts (Fig. 5b) . While MuRF2\u2212/\u2212 hearts accumulated significantly increased glycogen after 26 weeks high fat diet, the increases MuRF2\u2212/\u2212 liver and skeletal muscle accumulated did not reach significance (Fig. 5b) . Together, these studies illustrate that the MuRF2\u2212/\u2212 hearts are able to store fat (as triglyceride), but have alterations in glycogen storage capacity both at steady state (baseline) conditions and after high fat diet challenges. Akt and glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3\u03b2 are reported to be decreased in diabetic cardiomyopathy, along with increases in fibrosis and inflammation [48, 62] .",

In one study, treatment with rosiglitazone in mouse models of diabetes was shown to promote increases in cardiac size and enhanced fat volume [63] . Similarly, rosiglitazone side effects in patients have revealed increasing fat gain [64] . At baseline, MuRF2\u2212/\u2212 mice had comparable fat and lean body mass as wildtype controls (Fig. 5c) . However, during the development of insulin resistance, MuRF2\u2212/\u2212 mice demonstrated significantly more fat mass at 6 and 12 weeks of high fat diet, but no changes in lean body mass (Fig. 5c) . While the specific mechanisms by which rosiglitazone regulates fat mass is not completely clear, the enhanced PPAR activities seen in MuRF2\u2212/\u2212 mice may be one contributing factor to the accumulation of fat mass during which cardiac function is significantly worse than wildtype mice challenged in parallel with a high fat diet.",

O-GlcNAc, in concert with ubiquitin, mediates several aspects of diabetic cardiomyopathy [53, [65] [66] [67] [68] . O-GlcNAc modified proteins impair cardiomyocyte calcium cycling via its direct effects on phospholamban [68, 69] . O-GlcNAcylation also blunts autophagy, down regulates Nkx2.5 expression, and stimulates cardiac fibroblast collagen synthesis to mediate cardiac dysfunction [53, 65, 66] . Therefore, we measured the amount of O-Glc-NAc proteins in MuRF2\u2212/\u2212 heart, hypothesizing that the loss of MuRF2 cleared fewer O-GlcNAc-modified proteins, to mediate the enhanced cardiomyopathy seen in vivo. Immunoblot analysis of O-GlcNAc-modified proteins in MuRF2\u2212/\u2212 hearts demonstrated no differences from wildtype hearts when mice were fed a chow diet or 26 weeks of high fat diet (Additional file 4: Figure S4 ). While modest increases in O-GlcNAc levels were identified after 26 weeks of high fat diet, as expected with the observed hyperglycemia, differences in O-GlcNAc could did not appear to contribute to the exaggerated MuRF2\u2212/\u2212 cardiac dysfunction.",

            "text": "Evidence from a variety of cell culture studies have implicated ubiquitin as a post-translational modifier of PPAR transcription factors and their coreceptors/coactivators [43] . These have been in liver, lung, fibroblast, adipocytes, and macrophage (as recently reviewed [43] ). These studies have found that the ubiquitin-mediated inhibition of PPAR isoforms PPAR\u03b1, PPAR\u03b2, and PPAR\u03b3 are: 1) ligand-dependent (ligand is required for ubiquitination and/or degradation to occur); and 2) the ratio of ubiquitin ligase (e.g. MDM2 [73] ) determines activation (e.g. MDM2:PPAR\u03b1 ratio < 1) or inhibition (e.g. MDM2:PPAR\u03b1 > 1 [73] ). Since considerable evidence shows that MuRF2\u2212/\u2212 hearts enhance PPAR-activity suggesting that endogenous cardiac MuRF2 inhibits PPAR activities by nuclear PPRE-binding (Fig. 1a) and PPARregulated gene expression (Fig. 4) , we next focused on how the muscle-specific ubiquitin ligase MuRF2 might exert its inhibitory effects based on our current knowledge of how ubiquitin regulates PPAR in cancer cells. Like other ubiquitin ligases, MuRF2 interacts with a number of protein substrates. Notably, MuRF2 and MuRF1 redundantly interact with roponin-I (TnI), TnT, myosin light chain 2, and T-cap (telethonin) in yeast twohybrid studies [74] . Unlike MuRF1, MuRF2 has not been shown to degrade any of these substrates (as recently reviewed [75] ). But critical regulation of microtubule, intermediate filament, and sarcomeric M-line stability during striated muscle development [22] and regulation of E2F activity [40] . Understanding that high fat diet induced MuRF2 expression, we next identified PPAR\u03b1, PPAR\u03b2, and PPAR\u03b31 (as the PPAR\u03b32 isoform is restricted to adipocytes) (Fig. 6a) . Interestingly, in steady state conditions, cardiac PPAR\u03b1 and PPAR\u03b1 protein levels in MuRF2\u2212/\u2212 mice did not differ compared with wildtype controls. However, PPAR\u03b31 levels were slightly (and significantly) increased at baseline (Fig. 6a, far right) . After challenge with PPAR ligands (free fatty acids from high fat diet) for 26 weeks, no differences in MuRF2\u2212/\u2212 cardiac PPAR\u03b1 and PPAR\u03b31 were identified by immunoblot analysis, but a significant increase in PPAR\u03b2 protein expression was identified (Fig. 6a) . Taken together, these studies illustrate that the steady state levels of cardiac PPAR\u03b1 and PPAR\u03b31 isoforms are not affected by the presence of MuRF2 or its increase (Fig. 1c) after high fat diet challenge. Moreover, these results suggest that MuRF2's changes in PPAR\u03b1 and PPAR\u03b31 activities could be due to one of the multiple non-canonical post-translational modifications by ubiquitin (e.g. mono-ubiquitination) that are not associated with proteasome dependent and degradation. How MuRF2 is regulating PPAR\u03b2 without being able to ubiquitinate it directly (Fig. 6f ) is unclear. But the mechanism would be indirect include the possibility that MuRF2 it targeting the inhibition of a yet to be determined ubiquitin ligase(s) that normally degrades PPAR\u03b2. For example, PPAR\u03b2 in cancer cells (HEK293 and NIH3T3) is ubiquitinated and degraded in a ligand (GW501516)-dependent manner [76] . While the identification of the ubiquitin ligase targeting PPAR\u03b2 is not known at this time, ubiquitin ligases degrading other isoforms (e.g. PPAR\u03b3) have been reported in adipocytes (MKRN1) [77] . Conversely, MuRF2 ubiquitination could be enhancing a de-ubiquitinase (DUB) that prevents proteasome-mediated degradation by this unidentified E3(s).",

Based in the limited work performed on PPAR ubiquitination (as recently reviewed [43] ), we hypothesized that the ratio of MuRF2 to the substrate may regulate whether the protein was degraded in a proteasome-dependent manner, as previously reported in cancer with MDM2:PPAR\u03b1 ratios [73] . Increasing the MuRF2:PPAR\u03b31 ratios resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in steady state protein levels, consistent with poly-ubiquitination and subsequent degradation (Fig. 6b) . To determine the role of the proteasome in this process, we next repeated these experiments and found that the MuRF2-mediated decrease in PPAR\u03b31 could be prevented by adding the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Fig. 6d) . Since previous studies have reported that ubiquitin ligase mediated proteasome degradation of PPARs is ligand dependent (as recently reviewed [43] ), we next repeated these studies in the presence and absence of PPAR\u03b3 ligand rosiglitazone, demonstrating that MuRF2's dose-dependent degradation of PPAR\u03b31 was ligand dependent (Fig. 6d) . To establish that MuRF2 interacts with PPAR\u03b31, we performed immunoprecipitation studies by co-transfecting cells with HA-MuRF2 or HA-MuRF2\u0394Ring (lacking the ubiquitin ligase region) and FLAG-PPAR\u03b31 (Fig. 6c) . Immunoprecipitating PPAR\u03b31, we identified that MuRF2 bound PPAR\u03b31 by immunoblots (Fig. 6c) . Unexpectedly, MuRF2\u0394Ring did not bind PPAR\u03b31 in parallel studies suggesting MuRF2's Ring Finger domain has structural importance in the interaction with PPAR\u03b31.",

With no evidence that cardiac MuRF2 affected steady state PPAR\u03b31 isoform protein levels yet inhibited PPAR\u03b31 activity in vivo (MuRF2\u2212/\u2212 hearts had enhanced PPAR\u03b31 activities), we next tested how MuRF2 may be inhibiting PPAR\u03b31 mechanistically. Specifically, we wanted to determine why the physiological relevance of MuRF2-mediated degradation (with MuRF2:PPARg1 at levels 10:1) in vivo did not appear relevant in the context of diabetic cardiomyopathy. The experimental studies indicating that high MuRF2:PPAR\u03b31 ratios resulted in ligand-dependent proteasome degradation may be relevant in other , PPAR\u03b2 (f), and PPAR\u03b31 (g), with all lanes having Ub, E1, E2, MuRF2, and PPAR (=full reaction), unless otherwise indicated.

However, such a disease process has not been described to date. Therefore, we focused our studies of MuRF2-mediated ubiquitination of PPAR isoforms using ratios of 2:1 (Fig. 6e-g) . Whereas, MuRF2 did not appear to add poly-ubiquitination leading to degradation, MuRF2 drove multi-mono-ubiquitination on PPAR\u03b1 and PPAR\u03b31. Specifically, MuRF2 di-monoubiquitinated PPAR\u03b1, while adding ~four ubiquitin moieties to PPAR\u03b31 (Fig. 6e, g, respectively) . PPAR\u03b2, however, was unexpectedly not modified by ubiquitin at all in vitro. These studies add perspective to our initial findings that endogenous cardiac MuRF2 had the greatest regulation of PPAR\u03b3, with MuRF2\u2212/\u2212 hearts exhibiting 400%+ PPAR\u03b3 activity found in the sibling wildtype hearts (Fig. 1a , far right). Endogenous MuRF2 similarly had the next most inhibition of PPAR\u03b1, with MuRF2\u2212/\u2212 hearts exhibiting ~250% PPAR\u03b1 activity found in sibling wildtype hearts (Fig. 1a, far left) . Quite surprising was the finding that MuRF2 did not ubiquitinate PPAR\u03b2 (Fig. 6f ) , despite MuRF2 hearts exhibiting 80% more activity than wildtype controls (Fig. 1a, middle) .",

In control cells, we found that PPAR\u03b31 could be found in both the nucleus and cytosol, with most cells having primarily nuclear localization (81%) (Fig. 7a) . Increasing MuRF2 (2:1 ratio of PPAR\u03b31 transfected) interestingly resulted in an increase in the \"perinuclear\" localization of PPAR\u03b31 (Fig. 7b) . Notably, MuRF2 co-localized to these perinuclear regions (Fig. 7b) . Parallel studies using the MuRF2 without its ubiquitin ligase activity (\u0394RING-MuRF2) abrogated the perinuclear targeting of PPAR\u03b3 and colocalization with MuRF2 (Fig. 7c) . Since we demonstrated that MuRF2, but not MuRF2\u0394Ring, bound to PPAR\u03b31 (Fig. 6c) , these studies indicates that MuRF2 regulation of PPAR\u03b31 location may lie in its ubiquitin ligase activity and/or through some structural role required for interaction since MuRF2's Ring Finger domain is required to bind PPAR\u03b31 (Fig. 6c) . Taken together, these studies suggested that MuRF2 targets an ubiquitin-mediated regulation of PPAR\u03b31 activity by altering its localization within the nucleus, paralleling recent studies demonstrating autophagic sequestration of receptors in the endoplasmic reticulum and nucleus [78] .",

            "text": "While the present study demonstrates a role for the muscle specific ubiquitin ligase in regulating PPAR transcription factors in the context of diabetes, the clinical implications of these findings are broader. Recent studies have identified reductions in MuRF2 in patients with diabetic ischemic heart failure (GEO ID: 87403976, http:// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geoprofiles?term=87403976). Rare MuRF2 mutations in patients with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy have also been identified that are associated with a greater LV wall thickness than those without MuRF2 mutations [79] . Genome wide identification of SARS-CoV susceptibility loci using the collaborative cross has identified MuRF2 as a susceptibility factor to SARS infection, including evidence that MuRF2\u2212/\u2212 mice are more susceptible (R.S. Baric, personal communication and GEO accession no. GSE64660, http://www. ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE64660). Taken together, these studies suggest a role for MuRF2 in an increased susceptibility to disease. Given the growing evidence that PPARs have anti-inflammatory activity by competitively inhibiting NF-\u03baB and AP1 (cJun/cFos) experimentally (recently reviewed by Lockyer et al. [80] ), it is possible that reduced (or ablated) MuRF2 in patients may increase their susceptibility to infection in addition to diabetes as we demonstrate in the present study.",

            "text": "The dynamic regulation of PPAR transcription factor activity reflects the complexity found routinely in biology. PPAR family transcription factors routinely partner with RXR to regulate transcription of target genes, but cofactors such as PGC-1a enhance PPAR activity (induced by exercise) and mitochondrial biogenesis, which nuclear receptor corepressor 1 (NCOR1) antagonizes these activity (as recently reviewed by Fan and Evans) [81] . PPAR activity is also regulated by ligands which bind the ligand binding domain and include endogenously free fatty acids, eicosinoids, and environmental compounds [82] . In addition to the various co-complex partners that regulate PPARs, there are other transcription factors that compete with PPARs to regulate their activity, notably NF-\u03baB, making enhanced PPAR activity an anti-inflammatory state [80] . It is on top of this complexity that post-translational modification by ubiquitin and SUMO has been reported primarily in cancer cells, and recently by our group in cardiomyocytes for the first time [83] . In our recent review on this topic, few ubiquitin ligases have been described, but ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation of PPAR as well as SUMOylation has been reported in PPAR\u03b1, PPAR\u03b2, and PPAR\u03b31 in primarily non-physiological cultured conditions. The report here of the first ubiquitin ligase regulating PPAR\u03b31 by ubiquitination in a physiological process and cardiac pathophysiological process (diabetes) adds detail to a dimension of regulation we've just begun to understand.",

While our initial studies revealed that MuRF2\u2212/\u2212 hearts had enhanced PPAR\u03b1, PPAR\u03b2, and PPAR\u03b31 (most prominently PPAR\u03b31) activity measured by binding of PPRE DNA (Fig. 1a) . However, these enhanced activities were clearly not due to increased total protein levels of PPAR\u03b1 and PPAR\u03b31 (Fig. 6a) . Similarly, PPAR\u03b1 and PPAR\u03b31 were multi-mono-ubiquitinated as a mechanism to explain their inhibition (Fig. 6e, g) , while PPAR\u03b2 was not ubiquitinated by MuRF2 (Fig. 6f) . Like previous studies from our laboratory, the nuclear localization after MuRF protein post-translational ubiquitination may be regulating this process with PPAR\u03b31 ( Fig. 7 ) [83] . However, the indirect regulation of PPAR\u03b2 protein levels (enhanced in MuRF2\u2212/\u2212 hearts) is complex. The increase in PPAR\u03b2 protein levels is not transcriptionally regulated (Additional file 3: Figure S3b ), leading to our hypothesis that MuRF2 regulates PPAR\u03b2 through complex post-translational mechanism(s) as described above (e.g. MuRF2 degradation of E3(s) targeting PPAR\u03b2 or MuRF2 enhancing DUBs targeting PPAR\u03b2). Similarly complexity may lie with MuRF2's regulation of PPAR\u03b1 as PPAR\u03b1 mRNA levels are enhanced in MuRF2\u2212/\u2212 hearts throughout this study (Fig. 3a) . The regulatory elements in the promoter region of PPAR include activator protein-1 (AP-1) and how MuRF2 may inhibit these proteins is not clear [84, 85] . MuRF2\u2212/\u2212 mice have equivalent PPAR\u03b31 protein (Fig. 6a) and PPAR\u03b31 mRNA (Additional file 3: Figure S3c ). However, MuRF2\u2212/\u2212 hearts also have the most highly activated PPAR\u03b31 activity by several measures (Figs. 1a, 4d) , indicating that the strong post-translational multi-monoubiquitination in vitro (Fig. 6g ) may be MuRF2's primary mechanism of regulating PPAR\u03b31 in vivo.",

Initial studies investigating the role of MuRF2 in differentiated myocytes identified that MuRF2 binds critical signaling regions of the giant protein titin (via titin kinase region), to interact and regulate the activity and localization of the nuclear transcription factor SRF [41] . However, cardiac MuRF2 did not appear to regulate SRF activity in vivo, when stimulated by known SRF activating pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy [26] , suggesting this regulation is disease context specific. Subsequently, MuRF2 has been implicated in redundantly regulating (with MuRF1) other nuclear transcription factors implicated in developmental physiological hypertrophy [40] . In both cases, no evidence of MuRF2-mediated degradation was identified, consistent with the degradation-independent regulation of PPAR isoforms in the present study. The most commonly reported regulation of PPAR isoforms from the cancer literature has identified that post-translational modification with ubiquitin and SUMO appears to regulate PPAR most commonly to inhibit their regulation.",

In these series of elegant studies, investigators identified that low levels of MDM2 induced mono-ubiquitination and nuclear export of p53, whereas high levels of MDM2 promoted poly-ubiquitination and nuclear degradation of p53 [90] . In the context of stress, Li et al. endorsed the notion that non-stressed cells regulated p53 by mono-ubiquitination to circumvent the more extensive investment in energy the poly-ubiquitination and degradation require [89] . Conceptually, this increased energy expenditure may be worthwhile during stress considering that the bigger degradation response leads to apoptosis, whereas mono-ubiquitnation does not [89] . These studies also highlight the highly dynamic process of transcription factor regulation at the post-translational level [87] . Subsequent studies identified that SUMOylation, a process paralleling ubiquitination, can regulate the strength of the MDM2-p53 interaction and participates in the nuclear export [88] . This process appears to involve the stepwise interplay between SUMOylation and ubiquitination of p53 [86] . Very much like p53, all three PPAR isoforms are both SUMOylated and ubiquitinated, so future studies investigating the possible role of MuRF2regulation of PPAR isoform ubiquitination may take this into consideration. The requirement of SUMOylation for ubiquitination to occur may also explain MuRF2's apparent regulation of PPAR\u03b2 activity (Fig. 1a , middle frame) in vivo, but absence of PPAR\u03b2 ubiquitination in vitro ( Fig. 6f ) with demonstrable MuRF2 activity but lack of SUMO and/or other interacting proteins.",

Like previous reports of multi-ubiquitinated (e.g. mono-and di-ubiquitination) substrates [92] [93] [94] , di-or tri-ubiquitination of PPAR does not lead to its degradation in the physiological conditions. Interestingly, 14ARF induces p53-dependent SUMOylation in its target substrates, including MDM2 and NPM, in addition to ubiquitinating the protein [91] .

In the present study, we expanded these findings in MuRF2\u2212/\u2212 hearts after 26 weeks high fat diet to illustrate that differences in taurine, sucrose, glyceric acid, 3-hydroxyflavone, pantothenic acid, and glutamic acid (Fig. 8b) . Alternations in taurine and hypotaurine metabolite sets (Fig. 8d) in the MuRF2\u2212/\u2212 hearts are interesting given the emerging role of taurine on chronic heart failure. Taurine is an abundant amino acid that influences the heart's response to stress. It is one of the most abundant amino acids in the left ventricle, acting as an osmoregulator to trigger osmotic preconditioning, a process that activates Akt-dependent cytoprotective signaling [95] . The loss of taurine can depress protein synthesis and reduce energy reserves after cardiac surgery and has been found to be preserved [96] . Specifically, taurine has been shown to attenuate oxidative stress and alleviate heart failure in diabetic rates [97] . Supplementation of taurine in patients with heart failure has been used clinically [98, 99] . Our understanding of cardiac taurine biology is limited, but regulation of taurine by the taurine/ Na+ symport is believed to play an important functional role in heart failure and replacement an emerging practice in Japan. It's role in diabetic cardiomyopathy, in particular, has been found to reduce AGE, oxidized LDL by scavenging malondialdehyde, and hypochlorous acid and downstream HClO-dependent NO reduction [100] .",

With the growing appreciation of E3s in regulating autophagy and MuRF2's interactions with the autophagy-related Nbr1, p62, and LC3 proteins during cardiac myofibril assembly and turnover [41, 102] , it was surprising that MuRF2\u2212/\u2212 cardiac autophagy was not affected differentially after the high fat diet challenge (Additional file 5: Figure S5b ). Despite these provocative parallels, no previous studies of MuRF2's regulation of autophagic flux have been described, and in the present studies, the lack of endogenous MuRF2 did not affect autophagic flux after high fat diet challenge (Additional file 5: Figure S5b) . Similarly, steady state cardiac p62 protein levels were unaffected by the lack of endogenous MuRF2 (Additional file 5: Figure S5b ), indicating that cardiac MuRF2 may not have a role in cardiac autophagy or that other MuRF family proteins, such as MuRF1 which has been described in multiple processes [37, 40] , are functionally redundant and is compensating in the MuRF2\u2212/\u2212 model. As emerging evidence that autophagy plays a role in the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy by clearing post-translationally modified proteins, such as advanced glycation end products and the severity of disease [19] , targeting autophagy may offer one therapeutic pathway [103] . In the present study, we did not identify that endogenous MuRF2 was protective via this pathway, however.",

The MuRF family ubiquitin ligases, including MuRF1 and MuRF2 have shown to be critical regulators of cardiomyocyte growth and atrophy. Specifically, both physiological and pathological growth has been attributed to MuRF1 and MuRF2 in the heart [40, 46, 105] and skeletal muscle [106] , while MuRF1 regulation of cardiac [106] and skeletal muscle atrophy [107, 108] . While the changes seen in diabetic cardiomyopathy are vast, including alternations in metabolism, structural proteins, signal transduction, and ion channels [109] , the crucial role of enhanced PPAR signaling has been central to the pathogenesis of this disease downstream of altered insulin resistance [12, 44] . Regulation of PPAR activity, including post-translational modification-mediated regulation, is a process little understood in any cell type, including the cardiomyocyte. The findings of the current study implicate the first cardiac specific ubiquitin ligase that functionally regulates PPAR isoform signaling, by ubiquitination, inhibiting a central pathway in the pathogenesis of disease. Since the regulation of PPARs are dynamic during the course of diabetic cardiomyopathy [110] [111] [112] [113] , these studies identify the role of MuRF2 in the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy and its regulation of PPAR isoforms, including the post-translational inhibition of PPAR\u03b31 that is cardioprotective in vivo.",

We identified that MuRF2 protein levels increase ~20% during the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy induced by high fat diet. Compared to littermate wildtype hearts, MuRF2\u2212/\u2212 hearts exhibit an exaggerated diabetic cardiomyopathy, characterized by an early onset systolic dysfunction, larger left ventricular mass, and higher heart weight. MuRF2\u2212/\u2212 hearts had significantly increased PPAR\u03b1-and PPAR\u03b31-regulated gene expression by RT-qPCR, consistent with MuRF2's regulation of these transcription factors in vivo. Recent studies have described MuRF2 mutations to contribute to the severity of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The present study suggests that the lack of MuRF2 activity, as found in these patients, can result in an exaggerated diabetic cardiomyopathy. These present studies also identify MuRF2 as the first ubiquitin ligase to regulate cardiac PPAR\u03b1 and PPAR\u03b31 activities in vivo via post-translational modification without degradation and may represent a novel potential therapeutic target against heart failure in diabetes.",
