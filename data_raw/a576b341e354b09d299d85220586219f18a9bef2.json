This domain is intrinsically disordered and lacks stable structures. The disorder-to-order transition is induced by tRNA binding and has implications on folding and subsequent assembly into multi-tRNA synthetase complexes. Here, we expressed and purified RID from human LysRS (hRID) in Escherichia coli and performed a detailed mutagenesis of the appended domain. hRID was co-purified with nucleic acids during Ni-affinity purification, and cumulative mutations on critical amino acid residues abolished RNA binding. Furthermore, we identified a structural ensemble between disordered and helical structures in non-RNA-binding mutants and an equilibrium shift for wild-type into the helical conformation upon RNA binding. Since mutations that disrupted RNA binding led to an increase in non-functional soluble aggregates, a stabilized RNA-mediated structural transition of the N-terminal appended domain may have implications on the functional organization of human LysRS and multi-tRNA synthetase complexes in vivo.",

The structure of the domains is usually disordered, but adopts a helical structure upon polyphosphate binding [8, 10] . This is based on the charge-charge interactions between the negatively charged phosphate backbone and a cluster of positively charged amino acids. However, previous studies have been based on binding to tRNAs and studies about binding with non-specific nucleic acids (NAs) have not been reported. The disordered structure of the extensions without polyphosphate may be induced by the repulsive force exerted by the positively charged cluster, but this has yet to be elucidated.",

The chaperoning function for all three RIDs-human, rabbit, or mouse (hRID, rRID, or mRID, respectively)-was found to enhance the folding and assembly of down-stream target proteins, while fusion of the mutant hRIDs increased soluble aggregates. The fusion protein was easily purified by a one-step affinity chromatography and treated with a site-specific protease to convert the target protein to its functional form [11, 13, 14] . Previously, we showed that RNA-binding domains (RBDs) could be used as fusion partners for promoting the solubility and biological activities of target proteins [15] . The results were interpreted as the chaperonic function of RNAs (chaperna; chaperone + RNA) that had been recruited in the vicinity of folding intermediates [16] [17] [18] [19] .",

We detected co-purified NAs during the Ni-affinity purification and confirmed that cumulative mutations on critical amino acid residues abolished RNA binding. Due to its unique property of lacking absorbance at 280 nm, we were able to analyze its RNA-binding affinity. We also identified non-specific binding with NAs. Here, we analyzed the secondary structures of the purified proteins, and proved that the repulsive forces in the positively charged cluster destabilized the helical structure and induced a disordered structure. We identified a structural ensemble between the disordered and helical structures for mutants that do not bind RNA, and an equilibrium shift to the helical conformation upon RNA binding. The potential relationships between soluble aggregates and the disordered structure at the N-terminal appended domain may have implications in the functional organization of human LysRS and MSCs in vivo.",

            "text": "A previous study reported that nine specific positions (K19, K23, R24, K27, K30, K31, K35, K38, and K40) were found to be more important for tRNA binding than the other positions tested [8] . However, the previous study was based on a single-point mutagenesis study of the whole LysRS protein, which have another tRNA-binding domain, so the binding affinity of the mutant hRID alone is unclear. Thus, wild-type hRID (WT) and its mutants (K23A, K27A, K31A, K23A/K27A, and K23/K31A) were expressed in E. coli and purified using nickel-charged affinity resin (Ni-NTA) to investigate the binding affinities of hRID and mutant hRIDs. A translational enhancer tag of seven amino acids (MSEQHAQ) was added to the N-termini of the hRID constructs to increase their expression levels ( Figure 1A ). We found that all proteins could be expressed and well-purified by Ni-chromatography ( Figure 1B) , and that WT, K23A, K27A, and K31A co-purified with NAs ( Figure 1C ). However, the amount of co-purified NAs with K23A/K27A and K23A/K31A was decreased, with K23A/K27A having less NAs of the two. The A 260 /A 280 ratios of the purified NAs were >2.0 ( Figure 1D ), indicating that most of the bound NAs were RNAs rather than DNAs, because the ratio of pure RNA is 2.0-2.2 and that of pure DNA is 1.6-1.8 [21] . It should be noted that hRID is devoid of the amino acids that are responsible for absorbance at 260 and 280 nm such as Phe, Tyr, Trp, and Cys (Table S1 ); therefore, it does not interfere with calculating the A 260 /A 280 scores for determining NA content. As proof of this, the purified double-mutant protein, K23A/K27A, which did not have any co-purified NAs, failed to exhibit UV absorbance at 280 nm ( Figure 1D ). We also further confirmed that the band was not DNA by examining its heat instability and RNaseA sensitivity ( Figure 1E) . A greater mobility of tRNA was observed with the single amino acid mutant hRIDs when compared to WT, reflecting reduced affinity ( Figure 1C ). As proof of this, while WT hRIDs were colocalized with RNAs, dissociation between the mutant proteins and RNAs was evident by agarose gel electrophoresis ( Figure 1F ). The hRID mutant proteins, K23A and K27A, were mostly localized at the top of the gel, indicating that the mobility was unaffected by the electric field and reflected the neutral net charge of the protein when compared with the negatively charged RNAs. With this data, we concluded that the mutants had a decreased RNA binding ability. The similar levels of co-purified RNA between WT, K23A, K27A, and K31A ( Figure 1C ,D) were due to excess RNAs in the lysate even though the single point mutants had a lower binding affinity than WT hRID ( Figure 1C ,F). Interestingly, the apparent molecular weight (MW) of hRID in the gel was two-fold higher than the calculated MW (8.3 kDa). This phenomenon might result from the intrinsic disorder of the hRID structure [22] . Next, we expressed WT, K23A, K27A, and K23A/27A in 400 mL cultures and purified them by automated Ni-chromatography.",

Although absorbance is usually measured at 280 nm to detect purified protein, hRID does absorb 280 nm light (Table S1 ). Thus, the purified proteins were analyzed on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and their absorbances at 280 nm were used to detect the co-purified NAs. We found that all proteins were well-purified. Furthermore, hRID and K27A co-purified with RNAs, while hRID(6m) and hRID(9m) did not (Figure 2A,B) . We also detected a small amount of co-purified NAs with K23A and K23A/K27A (henceforth called hRID(2m)) ( Figure 2A ). Co-purified RNAs were confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis with EtBr staining ( Figure 2C ). Even though K23A and K23A/K27A co-purified with NAs, their concentration was too low to be detected by EtBr staining ( Figure 2C ). Unlike the results obtained by manual purification (Figure 1B) , the amount of RNA that co-purified with K23A and K27A by automated chromatography was lower than that of WT hRID due to the flow-wash of the automated system.

Since RNA-free hRID was needed, and RNase could not be used, we separated the hRID protein and co-purified RNA using a concentrator kit with 10K and 30K cut-off filters ( Figure 3A ). Macromolecules bigger than the filter pore size did not penetrate the filter, while those smaller than the pores did. hRID protein is quite small-approximately 9 kDa-and we hypothesized that the co-purified RNAs were larger than the hRID protein (a 27 nt RNA =~9 kDa). When using the 10K cut-off filter, both the protein and RNA were unable to pass. Even though free hRID is smaller than 10K, it could not penetrate the filter. This may be because hRID has a disordered structure, so it acts like a larger protein. However, using the 30K cut-off filter, we were able to obtain pure protein without RNA, since only the protein passed through the filter. The absence of NAs was confirmed by the absence of absorbance at 260 and 280 nm, and the presence of protein was confirmed by the absorbance at 230 nm, an indicator of peptide bonds ( Figure 3B ). The high absorbances at 230 nm of the concentrated samples was due to the presence of NAs as they also absorb at 230 nm. After RNA elimination, the protein was concentrated using a 10K Centriprep ( Figure 3C ). We further confirmed the oligomeric state of the purified hRID by size-exclusion chromatography ( Figure S1 ). The apparent MW of unbound hRID was 27.64 kDa, which may suggest that hRID is a trimer. However, a previous study of purified hRID found that it was monomeric, and that the higher MW was due to its disordered structure [7] . ",

As a result, we predicted that hRID could also bind to the backbone of RNA or DNA. Previous reports have described that the N-terminal appended domains of other tRNA synthetases such as yeast AspRS can interact non-specifically with NAs [10, 23] . However, there have only been reports on hRID to tRNAs and not to other NAs [7, 8, 11, 13] . Here, we examined the binding between hRID and DNA (pGE hRID plasmid) or poly(A/U) RNA. We initially failed to observe a mobility shift with NAs, probably due to the relatively small effects that large NAs have on retardation (data not shown). Thus, DNA and RNA were fragmented by sonication before EMSA. As previously reported [24] , the fragments retained a lower size-limit after prolonged sonication. After sonication, however, the mobility shift was markedly enhanced ( Figure 4E ). The fragmented, purified total DNAs and RNAs from calf thymus and yeast, respectively, were also retarded by hRID ( Figure 4F ). The K d values of WT and K27A with sonicated calf thymus DNA were quite similar to those with tRNA ( Figure 4G,H) . Taken together, these results clearly show that hRID can interact with a variety of NAs including tRNAs with tertiary structure, homopolymeric poly(A/U), and DNA. However, the co-purified NAs with hRID were biased towards being RNAs ( Figure 1E ), probably due to there being a higher (~10-fold) concentration of RNAs than DNAs in the growing E. coli cells [25] as well as the higher structural constraints imposed on genomic DNA.",

Next, we examined the secondary structure of WT and mutant hRIDs by circular dichroism (Figure 5C-H) . We used polyphosphate (polyP) rather than RNA or DNA as purines and pyrimidines (A, T, G, C, and U) result in high noise during circular dichroism. We found that the structures of WT, K23A, and K27A changed upon polyP addition ( Figure 5C-E) . Upon polyP addition, the circular dichroism (CD) score at 225 nm was decreased, and the CD score at 190 nm was increased, indicating that helical content increased. However, no significant changes were observed in the structures of hRID(2m), hRID(6m), or hRID(9m) after polyP addition ( Figure 5F-H) .

Here, we performed a detailed mutagenesis analysis on hRID, focusing on the pivotal residues associated with tRNA binding. The affinity to tRNAs was greatly reduced by the single point mutations, K23A and K27A, with a 30-fold and 6-fold increase in their dissociation constants, respectively. The combinations of mutations-double, six, or nine-point mutants-further increased the dissociation constant by more than 60-fold ( Figure 4) . While K23A/K27A still had a weak, but detectable NA binding ability (Figure 2A) , all of the multiple mutants-hRID(6m) and hRID(9m)-failed to exhibit affinities to RNAs (Figures 2A and 4D ). We developed a simple method to separate the hRID protein from co-purified RNAs (Figure 3) . Here, we confirmed that hRID could non-specifically bind to any NA ( Figure 4) and was not restricted to tRNAs. The non-specific nature of the binding is most likely mediated by the positively charged amino acids of hRID and the negatively charged phosphate backbone of the NAs. The secondary structure examined by CD in the presence of polyphosphates suggests that the positively charged amino acids in hRID are involved in the conformational change from disorder to an alpha helix in the presence of NAs (Figures 5 and 6) . Importantly, further extending previous observations [10] , we identified a structural ensemble between the disordered and helical structures in the mutants. For the WT construct, however, the equilibrium shifted in favor of the helical conformation in the presence of polyphosphates.",

As such, the N-terminal domains of multidomain proteins of E. coli origin such as LysRS are potent solubility enhancers for various C-terminal heterologous proteins [28] . Importantly, tRNA increased the refolding yield of prokaryotic LysRS in vitro [15] , and is direct proof of tRNA-dependent chaperone activity. Likewise, the hRID, at the extreme N-terminal appendage of human LysRS, which is absent in the E. coli counterpart, may serve as a cis-acting chaperone for the folding of downstream structural domains of human LysRS. Notably, when hRID is fused to the N-termini of target antigen proteins, RNA binding to hRID potently stimulates the folding and assembly of antigens into immunologically relevant multimers, virus-like particles (VLPs), or nanoparticles [13, 14] .",

            "text": "The use of mutant hRID constructs verified that NAs function as trans-acting factors, which, by binding to hRID, harness hRID as a solubility enhancer for the downstream domains [13, 14] . When fused to aggregation-prone proteins, the non-RNA-binding mutant fusions were present predominantly as inactive soluble aggregates of ill-defined structures, whereas WT fusion forms were present as regular assemblages [13, 14] . Consistent with the role of disordered domains as high solubility enhancers [29, 30] , the non-RNA-binding mutants with disordered structures had increased solubility. However, this represents an increase in soluble aggregates rather than proper folding, confirming that RNA-binding is crucial for its folding into a biologically relevant conformation. These results suggest that NA binding is important for the structural stabilization of the N-terminal appendage, and the disorder-to-order transition at the N-terminal domain may be required for the structural maintenance of LysRS so that it can serve its canonical function in aminoacylation as well as its non-canonical, moonlighting activities [6, [31] [32] [33] . These results are consistent with the chaperoning role of the N-terminal domains of native multidomain proteins in assisting de novo folding of their downstream domains in vivo [28, 34] . It should be emphasized, however, that here, the chaperoning role of N-terminal domains is exerted in concert with the bound RNAs [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] 24, 35, 36] .",

Considering that the proper folding of LysRS is a prerequisite for its assembly into MSCs [20] , it is tempting to suggest that tRNA binding to de novo synthesized N-terminal domains controls the folding and assembly pathways of MSCs. This interpretation is consistent with the observation that tRNA binding to hRID induces the folding and assembly of fused proteins [13, 14] . A recent paper also showed that the folding and assembly of cellular macromolecules are controlled cotranslationally by binding to some subunits of the complex during translation [37] , supporting the idea that RNA binding to hRID facilitates the folding of hLysRS and assembly of MSCs.",

In our bacterial expression system, the majority of NAs that co-purified with hRID were RNAs ( Figure 1C ,E); although, hRID was also able to bind to DNA (Figure 4) . Preferential binding to RNA might be due to the higher molar concentration of RNAs in growing E. coli cells [25] , but whether DNA binding represents in vitro artifacts or has biological significance remains to be further studied. In the eukaryotic cytosol, hRID has little chance to interact with DNA, which is enclosed in the nucleus. It should be noted, however, that hLysRS can relocate to the nucleus [39] , and due to the high DNA concentration in nucleus, the hRID of hLysRS may be involved in DNA binding. Whether this activity is associated with the activation of transcriptional factors by hLysRS subsequent to its nuclear translocation requires further investigation [40] . hLysRS also functions, as part of the innate immune system as a cytokine to trigger proinflammatory responses [38, 41] . Accumulating evidence suggests that the structures and functions of disordered proteins are largely influenced by the physicochemical properties of their cellular environments [42] . Whether RNA-dependent structural modulation of hLysRS is involved in its non-canonical functions in various intracellular organelles, the secretion process, or after secretion into the NA-devoid extracellular environment merits further investigation.",

Then, 1 mM IPTG was added, and the cells were grown at 37 \u2022 C. After 3 h of incubation, the cells were harvested, suspended in PBS, sonicated, and fractionated into soluble proteins (S) and insoluble proteins (P, pellet) by centrifugation. For experiments requiring pure protein, target proteins in the soluble fraction were purified using HisPur\u2122 Ni-NTA Resin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA; Cat. No. 88221) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Each fraction (total lysate (T), S, P, and the elution (E)) was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The amount of target protein was estimated by densitometry analysis of the stained gel using Bio1D (VILBER). Nucleic acids (NAs) that copurified with hRID in the eluted samples were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis in pH 8.3 TAE buffer (Biosesang, Seongnam, Korea; Cat.
