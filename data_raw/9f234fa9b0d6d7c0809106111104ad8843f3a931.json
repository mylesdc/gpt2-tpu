For the latter, events such as increases in hospital traffic could serve as early indicators of social disruption resulting from disease. In this study, we evaluate the feasibility of using hospital parking lot traffic data extracted from high-resolution satellite imagery to augment public health disease surveillance in Chile, Argentina and Mexico. We used archived satellite imagery collected from January 2010 to May 2013 and data on the incidence of respiratory virus illnesses from the Pan American Health Organization as a reference. We developed dynamical Elastic Net multivariable linear regression models to estimate the incidence of respiratory virus illnesses using hospital traffic and assessed how to minimize the effects of noise on the models. We noted that predictions based on models fitted using a sample of observations were better. The results were consistent across countries with selected models having reasonably low normalized root-mean-squared errors and high correlations for both the fits and predictions. The observations from this study suggest that if properly procured and combined with other information, this data source could be useful for monitoring disease trends.",

These studies have exemplified that if properly analyzed, high-resolution satellite imagery data can be extremely useful for understanding disease spread and implementation of control activities. Remote sensing using satellites has existed as far back as the 1960s and 70s. In contrast, in the last ten to twenty years, numerous studies have advanced several nontraditional data streams as tools to supplement public health surveillance systems. These non-traditional data sources (e.g., social media, micro-blogs, online news reports, and web searches and reservations) [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] appear to be most suitable for surveillance of diseases with seasonal trends (e.g., influenza, dengue and foodborne diseases) and short incubation periods 20 . However, most surveillance systems based on these data streams depend on the existence of disease reports, mentions of disease-related terms or access to digital diseaserelated documents. In the case of an emerging infectious disease, the disease signal available through some of these channels might be relatively low due to limitations in public health infrastructure and access to the Internet, thereby limiting (external) real-time monitoring efforts. Other indicators of social disruption such as the number of patients at a hospital with an undiagnosed infection could serve as proxies for early detection of emerging disease outbreaks. Unfortunately, such data are not easily accessible due to bureaucratic, privacy, security and infrastructural reasons.",

In this study, we evaluate the feasibility of using hospital traffic as a possible proxy for detecting influenza and other respiratory illnesses (hereafter referred to as influenza-like illness (ILI)) in Latin American countries. Similar approaches have been used to study and predict hospital admissions due to seasonal diseases 25 , predict hospital occupancy 26 and to study patterns of hospital use 27 . We estimate hospital traffic based on the number of cars at a hospital parking lot and non-parking lot spaces relative to parking lot size. Data from the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) is used as a reference for ILI activity. Similar to influenza (and other seasonal respiratory virus) surveillance systems in the United States and several other countries, the release of ILI data to PAHO can be delayed by weeks 28 . The data is also usually updated several weeks after the initial release. This implies that public dissemination of the number of cases due to an emerging outbreak can be delayed by several weeks (or even months) due to delays in reporting, and retrospective updating of case information. The purpose of this study is therefore to present an initial assessment of the use of hospital traffic data in these countries for estimating and predicting disease activity. There are two aims in this study: (1) introduce a new data resource (i.e. high-resolution satellite imagery of hospital traffic) for disease surveillance and (2) evaluate the impact of recency (defined as the most recent data observations) in dynamical multivariable linear models for modeling and predicting ILI data from PAHO based on estimates of hospital parking lot occupancy.",

In contrast, hospital peak occupancy months were August, March and May respectively. Similarly, for Mexico, hospital peak occupancy was observed in September, May and February, while ILI activity peaked in August, December and January. The trends observed for Argentina were not as consistent. Note that the influenza season typically runs from May to October, and October to May in the Southern and Northern hemispheres respectively.

Based on the recency values considered, high correlations between the ILI and fitted/predicted data corresponded to low RMSE values. In addition, smaller recency values appeared to achieve the best fits and predictions based on the correlation and normalized RMSE. The highest correlation and lowest RMSE value pair for the model fits was observed separately at recency values of 4, (4 and 5) and (4 and 5) for Chile, Mexico and Argentina. Note, the model fitted using all the observed data from the initial to the current week ( Figure 3 ) had the lowest correlation and the highest normalized RMSE for the fitted models. The model fitted with a recency value of 4 ( Figure 4 ) had a better fit compared to the model shown in Figure 3 . This was consistent across all countries. The fitted models with fewer data points captured the peaks and ILI trend better than the model based on all observations. The correlations and normalized RMSE appeared to depreciate with long-term predictions. number of hospitals, suggesting there was more data available. However, although Chile had the least number of hospitals, the RMSE and correlations were sometimes better than that for Mexico. This suggests that the performance of the models could partially be explained by the quality of the data and differences in trends across countries rather than the number of observations/images used. Similar observations were made for recency values less than 10.",

The number of cars in the parking lot appeared to be the dominant variable (i.e. most significant model coefficient) across all countries. For example, the number of cars in the parking lot of a general care hospital located in the Arica and Parinacota Region had the most significant coefficient for Chile for most weeks when the entire set of observations ( Figure 3 ) and also when the most recent set of observations were used in fitting (as shown in Figure 4 ). The second most significant coefficient for most weeks was the fill rate of a hospital located in the Metropolitan Region of Chile. The fill rate was also the second most significant variable for the models developed for Mexico and Argentina. Similar to Chile, the hospitals with significant coefficients were located in urban regions specifically, Mexico City for Mexico and Buenos Aires, Ushuaia, and Mendoza for Argentina. The location of the most dominant hospitals in urban areas could be partially explained by the increased likelihood of owning a car in an urban/metropolitan region compared to a rural region. For all three situations, there was no statistical significant evidence (P 5 0.391 to 0.9141) to suggest that hospital parking lot usage was different during and after these disasters.",

We used a dynamical Elastic Net approach, which implies that models were fit at each week enabling a dynamical estimation of coefficients and selection of hospital variables that best capture current ILI trends. The models were compared to percent ILI data from PAHO. Ministries of Health and National Influenza Centers of PAHO member states provide the data. The data release is sometimes delayed by a few weeks and data is also retrospectively updated. Therefore, information on current respiratory viruses activity can be delayed by several weeks. Alternative data sources that could serve as early proxies for disease activity are especially useful for monitoring emerging infectious disease outbreaks 29 . For instance, information extracted from satellite images can be processed and available within a few days. The multivariable models for percent ILI from PAHO based on hospital traffic appear to capture the overall trend and peaks in most instances. However, this seems to depend on the number of recent observations used in developing the models since in most cases, using all observations from the initial to the current week results in spuri-ous peaks and troughs, which leads to higher error rates in both the fits and prediction. One possible reason for these artificial peaks and troughs is that data for each hospital were available at irregular intervals due to the fact that the data was archived and some observations were lost because of factors such as tree cover, building shadow, and construction. Real-time surveillance that involves tasking satellites to take images at particular times of the day would eliminate some of the inconsistency in the data. Images can be taken at multiple times of the day for specific hospitals that best capture disease trends in each country.",

            "text": "In addition, there are expected discrepancies in vehicle ownership when comparing rural versus urban dwellers. So estimating hospital traffic based on the number of cars in the parking lot might not be suitable for rural regions. In addition, parking lots for hospitals in rural areas might be more exposed compared to lots for hospitals in metropolitan regions which might have multiple levels, with only the top level revealed. This could lead to a disproportionate sample of hospitals from urban areas. There are also limitations in the surveillance data used as a reference for ILI activity. Although estimated percent ILI was given for each week, the data available from PAHO has missing values for some viruses. In addition, we also fail to account for other factors that could impact hospital occupancy such as natural disasters (e.g. hurricanes), and social unrest (e.g., riots), and the hospital's distance from a metropolitan region due to lack of data. Although there were some significant correlations between the hospital traffic data and social unrest, defining the duration and scope of impact is challenging. While many projects seek to identify or predict those events through the use of social media or news reports, finding a comprehensive list that can be matched to hospital locations was beyond the scope of this project. Including a flawed list in the model would likely result in extensive misclassification of a binary variable, with the primary concern being false negative values. However, these are variables that ought to be carefully considered in future studies. Additionally, comparing the fits and predictions, the recency values for the best correlation and RMSE pairs are different. More work is needed to procure satellite data that could best capture the data trends. As with most studies using non-traditional sources of data for disease modeling or predictions, a measure of noise is present. Hence the recency approach might be suitable for developing models in such situations. Recency allows the model to focus on the most recent observations for fitting and predictions. Recent observations of disease incidence are expected to provide the most precise indication of future disease activity/trends. In addition, the most recent observations of the hospital occupancy rates are expected to have the most significant correlation with current disease activity. If satellites are targeted and values recorded more frequently, the sample size would be larger and fewer images would be eliminated during processing.",

While the RMSE and correlation between the predicted values and the PAHO ILI data were (RMSE 5 0.119; r 5 89.9%), (RMSE 5 0.127; r 5 85.6%), and (RMSE 5 0.109; r 5 93.0), for Chile, Mexico and Argentina, respectively. The fitted and predicted RMSE and correlation are slightly higher when compared to the outcomes from the model solely based on hospital parking lot occupancy data. Absolute humidity was significant at multiple weeks in all three models. The coefficients for precipitation were negative and significant for several weeks in the model for Argentina. In contrast, there were significant negative and positive precipitation coefficients in the models for Chile. Temperature was mildly significant in the Chile model but not significant in the other models.Social Unrest. Civil unrest data was available from November 2012 to May 2013. Both negative and positive correlations were observed between reports of civil unrest and hospital traffic, as expected.
