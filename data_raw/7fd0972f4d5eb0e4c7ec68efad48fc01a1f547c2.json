Upon infecting host cells, coronaviruses assemble a multi-subunit RNA-synthesis complex of viral non-structural proteins (nsp) responsible for the replication and transcription of the viral genome. Here, we present the 3.1 \u00c5 resolution structure of the SARS-CoV nsp12 polymerase bound to its essential co-factors, nsp7 and nsp8, using single particle cryo-electron microscopy. nsp12 possesses an architecture common to all viral polymerases as well as a large N-terminal extension containing a kinase-like fold and is bound by two nsp8 co-factors. This structure illuminates the assembly of the coronavirus core RNA-synthesis machinery, provides key insights into nsp12 polymerase catalysis and fidelity and acts as a template for the design of novel antiviral therapeutics.",

Though there are several human CoV responsible for a mild respiratory disease 1 , most notable are the highly pathogenic human CoVs: SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV capable of causing a severe respiratory disease. The zoonotic SARS-CoV emerged into human populations in 2002, spreading to 26 countries during its brief 9-month circulation in humans 2 . This epidemic resulted in >8000 infections with a~10% case fatality rate and was eventually contained through public health measures, as there are no specific treatments approved for human CoV infections. With the exception of a smaller second SARS-CoV outbreak in 2004 3 , SARS-CoV has been absent from human circulation since the initial outbreak ended. Despite the lack of recent human infections, SARS-CoV-like viruses continue to circulate in bat reservoirs 4 . Outbreaks of highly pathogenic human CoVs remain an emerging threat to global health security and are likely to continue to occur.",

            "text": "The threat of a novel emerging virus from the diverse CoV family necessitates antiviral strategies targeting conserved elements of the viral life cycle such as the viral machinery responsible for the replication and transcription of the positive-strand viral RNA genome. The multi-subunit CoV RNA synthesis machinery is a complex of non-structural proteins (nsp) produced as cleavage products of the ORF1a and ORF1ab viral polyproteins 5 . The nsp12 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase possesses some minimal activity on its own 6 , but the addition of the nsp7 and nsp8 co-factors greatly stimulates polymerase activity 7 . Though additional viral nsp subunits are likely necessary to carry out the full repertoire of replication and transcription activities, the nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 complex so far represents the minimal complex required for nucleotide polymerization. In addition, many other CoV nsps possess enzyme activities related to RNA modification 8,9 . After the emergence of SARS-CoV, there was an intense effort to structurally characterize the replication complexes of CoVs. This resulted in high-resolution structure determination for many of the SARS-CoV nsps in isolation using X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance 10, 11 . In addition, complexes of nsp7-nsp8, nsp10-nsp14 and nsp10-nsp16 were also determined [12] [13] [14] . One notable gap in our structural knowledge of the CoV RNA synthesis complex was a structure of the nsp12 RNA polymerase. This structural gap included information regarding the unique N-terminal extension of nidovirus polymerases, which has been proposed to contain a nucleotidyltransferase activity (nidovirus RdRp-associated nucleotidyltransferase (NiRAN)) 9 . It had also been unclear what the role of nsp8 and the nsp7-nsp8 complex within the viral RNA synthesis complex play, with proposed functions ranging from acting as processivity factors 14 to possessing RNA primase activity 15, 16 .",

All eight of these metal-coordinating a.a. are highly conserved across the CoV family ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ). Both of these metal-binding sites are distal to known active sites as well as protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions. Thus these ions are expected to be structural components of the folded protein rather than directly involved in enzymatic activity. The presence of structural zinc ions in nsp12 is reminiscent of bound zinc atoms in coronavirus nsp3, nsp10, nsp13, and nsp14 10, 13, 18, 19 and points to an extensive utilization of zinc ions for folding proteins of the viral replication complex.",

While the C-terminal region of nsp12 contains the RNA polymerase domain, the large N-terminal nidovirus-unique extension has long remained enigmatic. Sequence analysis of polymerase subunits across the Nidovirales order, which includes CoVs, revealed three conserved sequence motifs within this region: A N (SARS-CoV a.a. 69-89), B N (a.a. 112-130), and C N (a.a. 202-222) 9 ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ). Further experimentation revealed that the equine arterivirus polymerase subunit could be covalently modified with GTP or UTP and that mutations within the identified conserved motifs had negative impacts on this activity as well as viral growth and recovery, the proposed active site being a lysine residue in A N (SARS-CoV Lys73) 9 . The conserved regions of the polymerase harboring this nucleotidyltransferase activity were termed NiRAN 9 . However, the role and mechanisms of this nucleotidyltransferase activity remain to be elucidated.",

Mutagenesis has suggested that this primase activity lies in the N-terminal region of nsp8 and requires the formation of large oligomeric complexes to bring the active site residues into proximity 15, 16 .

However, in addition to missing the nsp7-nsp8 heterodimer, this structure also displays a significant amount of disorder in the fingers domain index and ring loops, which play a role in template and NTP binding (Fig. 5) . We hypothesize that the binding of the nsp7-nsp8 heterodimer to the index finger loop stabilizes the polymerase domain to permit template recognition. This hypothesis is consistent with the observation that, while nsp12, nsp7, and nsp8 all individually recognize RNA with no or poor affinity, the complex of nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 is significantly more capable of binding RNA 7 .",

The NiRAN domain of nsp12 presents a conserved face for interaction with the Nterminal disordered domain. Structural homology of nsp12 to the polymerases of the picornavirus family suggests residues involved in template recognition and catalysis. The role of nsp7 and nsp8 heterodimers appears to be the stabilization of nsp12 regions involved in RNA binding while a second subunit of nsp8 also plays a crucial role in polymerase activity possibly by extending the template RNA-binding surface.",

Structurally, the SARS-CoV nsp12 most closely resembles the polymerases of picornaviruses, such as poliovirus, norovirus, and rhinovirus 24, 25 . Picornaviruses use a protein primer called VPg to prime RNA synthesis and serve as a 5\u2032 cap. However, CoVs cap their RNAs with a 5\u2032 GTP resembling host RNAs 33 and hence are likely to use a distinct mechanism for RNA initiation. Biochemical evidence has shown that the nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 complex possesses de novo initiation activity that is dependent on the nsp12 polymerase-active site 7 similar to NS5 and NS5B polymerases of the Flaviviridae family such as dengue virus and hepatitis C virus, which use protein elements within the thumb domain to position a priming nucleotide in the \u22121 primer position 34 . However, the SARS-CoV nsp12 double-stranded RNA exit tunnel has no obstructions to act as a platform for priming nucleotides. Hence, the mechanism by which CoV polymerases carry out de novo RNA initiation is likely to be distinct from either the picornaviruses or flaviviruses, but the nature of this mechanism remains unclear.",

The homologous region spans the C-terminal large kinase domain, with the closest structural homology residing in the kinase nucleotide-binding site. Though kinase activity has not been demonstrated for nsp12, there are several shared kinase catalytic residues visible in the SARS-CoV nsp12 NiRAN structure including Asn209 and the nidovirusconserved Asp218 and Phe219. As the nsp12 N-terminus is disordered, we are unable to determine whether this region of nsp12 resembles the small kinase domain. However, the shared residue identities with the large kinase domain do suggest a potential nucleotide-binding site within the nsp12 NiRAN domain. How such a kinase-like domain carries out the previously reported nucleotidyltransfer 9 remains a subject for further study. One possibility is a mechanism similar to that of the pseudokinase SelO, which binds ATP in an alternate configuration and possesses AMPylation activity 36, 37 .",

The interface domain (a.a. 251-398) acts as a protein-interaction junction, contacting the NiRAN domain, the fingers domain, and the second subunit of nsp8.The observed NiRAN domain contains the majority of motif B N as well as motif C N . This region interacts with the base of the polymerase palm and fingers domains. It is interesting that the observed ordered region in the structure begins within the conserved sequence motif B N and implies a functional role for this linker region between the N-terminal disordered domain and Structure of SARS-CoV nsp12 bound to nsp7 and nsp8 co-factors. a Diagram of the SARS-CoV nsp7, nsp8, and nsp12 proteins indicating domains, conserved motifs, and the protein regions observed in the structure (black bars) (Supplementary Fig. 3). b SARS-CoV nsp12 contains a large N-terminal extension composed of the NiRAN domain (dark red) and an interface domain (purple) adjacent to the polymerase domain (orange). nsp12 binds to a heterodimer of nsp7 (blue) and nsp8 (green) as well as to a second subunit of nsp8. c-e Comparison of SARS-CoV nsp12 to the polymerase proteins of poliovirus24 (3OL6.pdb) [10.2210/pdb3OL6/pdb] and dengue virus 55 (4V0R.pdb) [10.2210/pdb4V0R/pdb].
