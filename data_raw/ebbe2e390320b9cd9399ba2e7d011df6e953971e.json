Similar to other CoVs,TGEV has a diameter ranging from 100 to 150 nm, including the surface projections. TGEV infects newborn piglets with mortality rates reaching 100%, resulting in significant losses in the swine industry. The CoV spike protein binds to a cellular receptor and then mediates membrane fusion at the plasma membrane or by endosomal uptake. TGEV, Human coronavirus (HCoV-229E), serotype 2 Feline Coronavirus (FCoV), and Canine Coronavirus (CCoV) all use the aminopeptidase N (APN) protein as the receptor [1] . TGEV infects epithelial cells through the small intestine and the respiratory tract. The virus enters epithelial cells from the apical or basolateral side, and is released from the apical plasma membrane into the gut lumen, where it propagates efficiently by cell-to-cell spreading [2] . Porcine intestinal columnar epithelial cells (IPEC-J2) offer a practical model for studying porcine enteric pathogens [3] . However, the precise molecular mechanisms responsible for TGEV entry are largely unknown, and limited informations are available on the cell signaling pathways involved in coronavirus entry via the actin cytoskeleton.",

            "text": "Located beneath the plasma membrane, cortical actin is composed of a loosely organized network of actin cytoskeleton that is highly dynamic and is involved in many cellular processes. Many pathogens facilitate cell entry and/or trafficking by stimulating actin remodeling [4, 5] . Cofilin plays an important role in actin polymerization and depolymerization [6] . LIM-kinases (LIMKs) inhibit the activity of cofilin by phosphorylating the serine residue at position 3 (Ser-3). LIMKs are activated by Rho-associated kinase (ROCK), p21-activated protein kinases (PAKs), which are downstream kinases of the Rho family GTPases, RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 [7] . Rho GTPases regulate actin polymerization, induce plasma membrane protrusion and control vesicle trafficking [8] . The phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) pathway is activated by a variety of extracellular stimuli and regulates a wide range of cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, cell growth, cell motility, cell adhesion and vesicular trafficking [9, 10] . The serine/threonine kinase (Akt) is a central node in cell signaling downstream of growth factors, cytokines, and other cellular stimuli [11] . Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) play an important role in transforming extracellular intracellular signals and activate PI3K as well as extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 [12] . The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) belongs to the RTK family, and is activated by a family of growth factors including epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor-\u03b1 (TGF-\u03b1), and the neuregulins. It also interacts with three homologous transmembrane proteins ErbB2, ErbB3 and ErbB4 [13, 14] . The binding of EGF to its cell surface receptor activates the receptor's intrinsic tyrosine kinase and phosphorylates the tyrosine at its C-terminus. Phosphorylated EGFR is essential for the activation of Ras GTPase and ERK [15] . EGFR can be activated by many viruses, including influenza A, hepatitis C (HCV), Herpes simplex type 1(HSV-1), and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) [16] [17] [18] [19] .",

In uninfected cells, the level of p-cofilin was low from 1mpi to 60 mpi and increased at 120 mpi, but the level of cofilin maintained a high expression level from 5mpi to 60 mpi.

            "text": "To examine the role of cofilin more closely, we conducted series of experiments in which cofilin distribution and function were assessed in uninfected and TGEV-infected cells. Most p-cofilin was found in the nucleus of uninfected cells (Figure 2A ). In contrast, early in TGEV infection, p-cofilin redistributed to the cytoplasm and was less abundant in the nucleus. However, at 60 mpi, p-cofilin appeared to shift from the cytoplasm back to the nucleus (Figure 2A ). When the distribution of p-cofilin and F-actin were observed early in infection, we found most p-cofilin did not colocalize with F-actin, and multiple protrusions were noted around the cell membrance ( Figure 2B ). We knocked cofilin down in normal IPEC-J2 cells, and found that the actin stress fibers were also in the cytoplasm. Usually underneath the cell membrane are the loosely organized network of F-actin filaments that are termed cortical actin [4] , but the cortical actin underneath the cell membrane gathered together, the cell surface was smooth and couldn't form protrusions. In cofilin knockdown cells, early in TGEV-infection, some actin stress fibers were also found in the cytoplasm, the protrusions in the cell membrance reduced significantly. The transient increased in p-cofilin level in the cytoplasm from 1 mpi to 30 mpi correlated with the F-actin filaments around the cell membrane and the formation of multiple TGEV particles were labeled with fluorescent probe Dylight 594, IPEC-J2 cells were incubated with DyLight 594 labeled TGEV at 4 \u00b0C for 1 h, then shifted to 37 \u00b0C, fixed at 30 mpi and 60 mpi, F-actin stained with phalloidin (Green).

Cells were transfected with cofilin targeting shRNAs, the cofilin expression level was decreased significantly ( Figure  2C) , and TGEV entry level was decreased ( Figure 2D ). Cells were also transfected with vectors expressing WT cofilin, constitutively non-phosphorylated mutant cofilin (activated, S3A), or constitutively-phosphorylated mutant cofilin (inactivated, S3E) [21, 22] . The expression of WT or constitutively inactivated cofilin S3E significantly increased the expression of p-cofilin ( Figure 2E ). All three constructs inhibited TGEV entry ( Figure 2F ). Examination using confocal fluorescence microscopy showed that in uninfected cells, the F-actin partially depolymerized in WT cofilin-expressing cells and in constitutively activated cofilinS3A-expressing cells, while the F-actin in constitutively inactivated cofilinS3E-expressing cells, polymerized around the cell membrane ( Figure S2 ).

In this study, we found that TGEV infection induced the activity of ERK1/2 at 5 mpi and increased it thereafter ( Figure 4D ). U0126, a specific inhibitor of MEK1/2, inhibited TGEV entry in a dose dependent manner but did not affect the ability of the virus to bind to cells ( Figure 4E ). U0126 also inhibited the destruction of F-actin by TGEV infection, as observed when cells were examined by confocal fluorescence microscopy ( Figure 4C ). The phosphorylation of Akt, LIMK and cofilin were inhibited when cells were treated with PI3K inhibitor LY294002 ( Figure 4F) , suggesting that the PI3K/Akt pathway is involved in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton by cofilin. ERK1/2, LIMK and cofilin phosphorylation were inhibited when cells were treated with MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126, but the activation of ERK1/2 was not inhibited by LY294002. These results indicate that the MEK/ERK pathway also involve in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton by cofilin, but it is not activated by PI3K/Akt pathway.

Although EGFR specific inhibitor AG1478 had no inhibition effect on the adhesion of TGEV ( Figure 6C ), when IPEC-J2 cells were pretreated with AG1478 for 1h at 37 \u00b0C, TGEV entry was significantly decreased ( Figure 6D ).

When serum-starved cells were pretreated with low concentration of EGF at 37 \u00b0C for 1h, EGFR was activated and TGEV entry was increased significantly ( Figure 6E ). When serum-starved cells were pretreated with high concentration of EGF at 37 \u00b0C for 1h, most of EGFR internalized into the cytoplasm and TGEV entry was decreased significantly ( Figure 6F ). EGFR targeting shRNAs significantly decreased TGEV entry ( Figure  6G ). The interaction between TGEV S1 and EGFR were confirmed in HEK293T cells that were co-transfected with plasmids expressing TGEV S1-HA and EGFR ( Figure  6H ), providing further support that TGEV S1 directly combined with EGFR. Most of EGFR occured in the cell membrane in normal cells, part of EGFR internalized into the cytoplasm upon low concentration EGF (100ng/ml) stimulation, most of EGFR internalized into the cytoplasm upon high concentration EGF(10ug/ml) stimulation, both TGEV particles and EGFR internalized into the cytoplasm upon TGEV infection ( Figure S3 ).

            "text": "Cofilin has a central role in controlling actin dynamics by regulating actin polymerization and depolymerization through its severing activity, as well as by inducing dendritic nucleation [6] . The regulation of cofilin activity is a component of pathogen-mediated actin remodeling [30, 31] . We conclude that phosphorylation of cofilin is critical for TGEV entry. Cofilin can be found in multiple cellular compartments, including the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm [32, 33] . A nuclear localization signal (amino acid residues 30-34) with high homology to the consensus nuclear localization signal sequence of SV40 large T-antigen is found in the cofilin sequence [34] . The nuclear translocation of cofilin is regulated by reversible phosphorylation of Ser-3 [35] . The phosphorylation of cofilin inhibits its F-actin severing activity. We found that p-cofilin was distributed mainly in the nucleus of normal IPEC-J2 cells, however, early after TGEV infection, most p-cofilin was found in the plasma membrane, derived both from the phosphorylation of cofilin and the migration of p-cofilin from the nucleus. Late in infection, a portion of the p-cofilin was dephosphorylated, while the remaining p-cofilin returned to the nucleus. Cofilin supports ARP2/3 complex-mediated actin branching by creating new actin filaments through its F-actin severing activity, making the actin filaments more stable at the cell membrane [36] . Cofilin is required for the early polymerization response to growth factor stimulation and the formation of protrusions, although the ARP2/3 complex is not involved in this process [37, 38] . The inhibition of ARP2/3 caused the actin filaments to bind together more loosely, resulting in increased entry of TGEV. We conclude that the structure of the cortical actin filaments, which underline the cell membrane, plays an important role in TGEV early infection. The regulation of cofilin activity acts as a molecular switch to provide a functional link between actin cytoskeleton rearrangement and the TGEV entry process.",

This study shows that the PI3K/Akt pathway is involved in the cellular entry of TGEV, and is activated by EGFR. Our previous studies indicate that MAPK pathways are activated early in TGEV infection (for example, the Ras-mediated activation of the Raf/ MEK/ERK cascade). MAPK pathways can also be activated by the EGFR-PI3K-RhoGTPases signaling pathway [43, 44] .

The primary signaling pathways activated by RTKs include PI3K/Akt, Ras/ www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget Raf/ERK1/2, and signal transduction and activator of transcription (STAT) pathways. Our data provides evidence that EGFR acts as a signaling-promoter that is involved in the regulation of actin and TGEV internalization. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection induces filopodia formation and the dissolution of stress fibers by 10 mpi, and HPV entry is also blocked by RTK and PI3K inhibitors [45] . We find that the EGFR specific inhibitor AG1478 and PI3K specific inhibitor Y27632 block stress fiber dissolution, suggesting that the EGFR and PI3K are involved in the signaling pathway that regulates the assembly of F-actin. Our results indicate that EGFR is activated by TGEV binding and promotes TGEV uptake into host cells. It has been reported that a 200-kDa protein in ST cells and in villous enterocytes in newborn pigs may be a second receptor for TGEV and contribute to the age sensitivity of these animals to the virus [46] , but the identity of this 200-kDa receptor has not been determined. Although EGFR is a 170-kDa transmembrane protein, we have found that it interacted with TGEV S1 protein, and therefore should be considered as a factor in determining the high level of susceptibility of newborn pigs to TGEV.",

The integrity of lipid rafts is essential for the activation of Src kinase and the PI3K/ Akt pathway [48] .
