            "text": "CD147 is an activation induced glycoprotein that promotes the secretion and activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and is upregulated during the differentiation of macrophages. Interestingly, some of the molecular functions of CD147 rely on its glycosylation status: the highly glycosylated forms of CD147 induce MMPs whereas the lowly glycosylated forms inhibit MMP activation. Statins are hydroxy-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors that block the synthesis of mevalonate, thereby inhibiting all mevalonatedependent pathways, including isoprenylation, N-glycosylation and cholesterol synthesis. In this study, we investigated the role of statins in the inhibition of macrophage differentiation and the associated process of MMP secretion through modulation of CD147. We observed that differentiation of the human monocytic cell line THP-1 to a macrophage phenotype led to upregulation of CD147 and CD14 and that this effect was inhibited by statins. At the molecular level, statins altered CD147 expression, structure and function by inhibiting isoprenylation and N-glycosylation. In addition, statins induced a shift of CD147 from its highly glycosylated form to its lowly glycosylated form. This shift in N-glycosylation status was accompanied by a decrease in the production and functional activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9. In conclusion, these findings describe a novel molecular mechanism of immune regulation by statins, making them interesting candidates for autoimmune disease therapy.

In contrast, treatment with various statins (pravastatin, atorvastatin, and fluvastatin) followed by differentiation with PMA resulted in a cellular morphology similar to that of undifferentiated THP-1 cells; pravastatin treatment also resulted in the formation of bunched clusters of cells (Fig 2C-2E ). Next, rescue experiments were performed to reverse the effects of statins. Treatment with mevalonate, the product of HMG-CoA reductase, reversed the effect of fluvastatin and resulted in a differentiated cellular morphology ( Fig 2F) .

HG CD147 forms homo-oligomers and induces MMP secretion and activation, whereas LG CD147 inhibits MMP secretion. Experimentally induced changes in CD147 N-glycosylation are illustrated in Fig 6A and 6B . Treatment of THP-1 cells with fluvastatin induced LG CD147 expression in a dose-dependent manner. Rescue with mevalonate, squalene, or cholesterol was able to reduce the fluvastatin-induced increase in expression of LG CD147. Inhibition of isoprenylation by FTI-277, GGTI-298 or FPT1 (a combined inhibitor of farnesylation and geranylgeranylation) increased LG CD147. Consistently, treatment with AP-9, a specific peptide antagonist of CD147, increased LG CD147. Treatment of THP-1 cells with tunicamycin affected the levels of both LG and HG CD147: the expression of LG CD147 (33 kDa) and HG CD147 (51 kDa) was greatly diminished. The molecular weight of the form that appeared upon tunicamycin treatment (27 kDa) is consistent with that of the non-glycosylated core protein. The small amount of 51 kDa HG CD147 remaining was likely synthesized before tunicamycin treatment (Fig 6A) .",

Cell surface levels of HG-CD147 were markedly downregulated after treatment with any of the three statins. The control substance tunicamycin decreased the translocation of CD147 to the cell surface ( Fig  7A and 7C) to a greater degree than the statins. Consistently, the biotinylated (cell surface) form of the core protein could not be detected by western blot; both HG-CD147 and LG-CD147 were detected in the cell lysate (Fig 7B and 7C) .

Gelatin zymography is able to measure the activities of all of these forms of MMP-9. PMA-induced differentiation of THP-1 cells promoted the activation of MMP-9, as indicated by the emergence of the active form of MMP-9. Treatment with fluvastatin resulted in a decrease in the levels of active MMP-9, whereas pravastatin and atorvastatin failed to do so. To rescue the effects of fluvastatin, we added mevalonate, FPP, GGPP, or dolichol. Both mevalonate and dolichol were able to increase the levels of activated MMP-9, whereas FPP and GGPP were not.

The pivotal role of CD147 in monocyte differentiation has been confirmed by the fact that AP-9, a specific peptide antagonist of CD147, prevents monocyte differentiation [46] . Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that AP-9 significantly inhibits the secretion and activation of MMP-2 and MMP-9 by THP-1 cells, thus emphasizing the role of CD147 in regulating MMPs [11] . CD147 interacts with adhesion markers such as CD29 (\u03b21-integrin) and CD98 (large neutral amino acid transporter 1) [47] and participates in integrin-mediated adhesion, cellular differentiation and apoptosis [48] . Inhibition of CD147 has also been shown to impair the translocation of monocarboxylate transporter (MCT)-1 to the cell surface, disrupting the cellular lactate acid shuttle; this leads to intracellular acidification and metabolic starvation. Both of these effects lead to inhibition of monocytic differentiation [49] .",

CD147 exists in two different glycosylation states: a HG (highly glycosylated) and a LG (lowly glycosylated) form. MMP induction is promoted by HG CD147 via homo-oligomerization, whereas LG CD147 acts as an inhibitor of MMP-2 and MMP-9, probably through its affinity for caveolin [9, 19] . Thus, the glycosylation status of CD147 acts as a molecular switch for the activation of MMPs [8, 54] . Our results show that fluvastatin treatment increases the expression of LG CD147, confirming the role of CD147 in mediating statin-associated MMP inhibition.",

However, the same isoprenylation inhibitors did induce the expression of LG forms of CD147. We speculate that this discrepancy is due to a potential effect of statins on caveolin-1 itself (mediated by isoprenylation) because upregulation of caveolin-1 also promotes LG CD147 forms and subsequently decreases self-association of CD147 on the cell surface [18] . Thus, statins act on isoprenylation pathways to impair trafficking of CD147 to the cell surface. Tunicamycin specifically inhibits the N-glycosylation of newly synthesized proteins [56] . In our experiments, tunicamycin drastically reduced de novo N-glycosylation of CD147, resulting in greatly increased expression of the non-glycosylated core protein. Taken together, these data suggest that statins regulate CD147 on multiple levels, particularly through isoprenylation and N-glycosylation.",

Like CD147, insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 receptor is a membrane-targeted molecule that requires N-glycosylation for its proper function; reduced glycosylation activity causes proreceptor retention within the endoplasmic reticulum [32] . Consistent with our findings for CD147, two other groups have described downregulation of IGF-1 receptor by statin treatment and demonstrated that this inhibitory effect is via the isoprenylation and N-glycosylation pathways, which act synergistically to promote IGF-1 receptor activity [32, 57] .",

By reducing cholesterol levels, statins are able to disrupt the lipid rafts, causing subsequent dissociation of the raft-associated molecules and ultimately inhibiting their interactions [37,38]; 4. statins have been observed to directly inhibit leukocyte function antigen (LFA)-1 [39], a cellular adhesion molecule that plays key roles in T-cell activation and migration [40].",
