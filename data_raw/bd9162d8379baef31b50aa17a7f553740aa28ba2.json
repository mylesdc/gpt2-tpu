The current release (2.0) includes data for twenty-five families with broad host range as against eight in the first release. The taxonomic description of viruses in VirGen is in accordance with the ICTV nomenclature. A wellcharacterised strain is identified as a 'representative entry' for every viral species. This non-redundant dataset is used for subsequent annotation and analyses using sequenced-based Bioinformatics approaches. VirGen archives precomputed data on genome and proteome comparisons. A new data module that provides structures of viral proteins available in PDB has been incorporated recently. One of the unique features of VirGen is predicted conformational and sequential epitopes of known antigenic proteins using in-house developed algorithms, a step towards reverse vaccinology.",

            "text": "The emergence of high throughput technologies for genome sequencing, microarrays and proteomics transformed biology into a data-rich information science. Sequencing the complete genome of an organism is the first step in generating the 'parts list' of life. One of the first efforts involved sequencing of Haemophilus influenzae in 1995 [1] . As of July 2006, more than 403 organisms have been sequenced completely. Furthermore, the genome sequencing projects of ~932 prokaryotic and ~608 eukaryotic species have been launched [2] . Enormous data generated by the genome sequencing projects is archived in both dedicated genomic resources and public domain databases. While the complete genome sequencing of the model organisms and microbes are taking the centerstage, viral genome sequencing continue to be individual efforts [3] . Viruses are a diverse group of organisms and are most abundant [4, 5] . The genome size of viruses varies from a few hundreds to millions of bases [6, 7] . SV-40 was the first virus for which the complete genome (5,224 bp) sequence was obtained in late 70s [8] . About ~4000 viruses have been sequenced so far by virologists all over the world with an objective to study antigenic variation, geographic distribution, spread and evolution. These independent efforts enabled viruses to attain the status of 'best-represented taxa' with the highest number of whole genomes sequenced. However, due to lack of concerted efforts, viral genomic sequences only added to the entries in the public repositories until recently. The GOLD (Genome OnLine Database) is a tracking system for genome sequencing and provides the update of various genome-sequencing projects [2] but does not have any mechanism to specifically monitor viral genome sequencing initiatives.",

The complete genome sequences of two large viral genomes viz., Mimivirus [7] and Polydnavirus [10] substantiate this fact. Varying coding density and the occurrence of genes associated with metabolic pathways in these DNA viruses offers interesting opportunities in viral genomics in general and in understanding evolution of viruses in particular [11] . However, it is known that in the absence of curation and functional annotation of the genomic data, the utility of the sequence data is minimal and the sequence merely remains as an entry in the database. Bioinformatics provides large number of databases, tools and approaches for mining huge sequence data. Although there exist numerous genome databases for the model organisms and microbes, there are a few databases, which archive viral genomic data [12, 13] . Most of these databases are synthesis of experimental work carried out in the respective laboratories. As a result, these compilations are highly specialized [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] .",

Hepatitis C virus is a member of family Flaviviridae, genus Hepacivirus and is a major causative Home page of VirGen: a genome annotation and comparative genomics platform for viruses agent of liver diseases. The assignment of Hepatitis C virus genotypes is essential as molecular epidemiology differs from subtype to subtype. Also, due to the absence of significant cross-protection among different HCV subtypes, the exact subtype identification becomes a prerequisite in determining the suitability of present antiviral therapy as well as designing new antiviral compounds and vaccines [22] . Isolation of HCV by standard immunological and virological techniques [23] is rather difficult. Efforts to classify HCV at type and subtype level are based on molecular phylogeny using 5'UTR and core, NS3, NS4 & NS5 respectively [24] . However, absence of significant sequence variation in 5'UTR limits its usage for classification only up to genotype level [25] . Furthermore, intratypic crossing over events have been reported in some of the HCV genotypes [26] . Given this scenario, use of a single gene or genomic region may lead to inaccuracies in genotype assignment of HCV. During the process of curation of HCV genomic sequences for incorporation into VirGen, it was found that a majority of the genomic records in the public domain repositories lacked the information on genotype. An approach based on whole genome phylogeny was used to assign the genotypes. These assignments were further substantiated through literature search. More than 130 records of HCV were annotated and added to VirGen using this process.",

Curation and MSA of Egp sequences from additional 88 JEV strains revealed that IGD also occurs in place of RGD. All tripeptides except MGD and RGN are naturally occurring. MGD was observed in the attenuated strain (GenPept Accession: 6970068) [42] . Similarly RGN was observed in a strain, which was passaged in Neuro-2a cells (GenPept Accession: 34495383).

The major steps involve identification of at least three consecutive accessible residues to delineate antigenic determinants, extension of the same towards N and C terminii and prediction of conformational epitopes by collapsing antigenic determinants that are within the spatial proximity of 6\u00c5. Accuracy of the algorithm is 75% when calculated using cocrystal structure data of antigen-antibody complexes from PDB.

The epitope predictions using the CEP algorithm are limited by the availability of three-dimensional structures of viral proteins.

NS3 has two domains, 178 residues at N' contains serine protease activity and ~450 residues at C' has helicase activity. The dual activity of NS3 increases its potential as a target for antiviral therapy. This viral protease is known to be highly efficient when associated with a hydrophobic stretch of NS2B [61, 62] . The two-component protease is required for the cis cleavage of NS2A/ NS2B and NS2B/NS3 as well as trans cleavage of NS3/ NS4A and NS4B/NS5 [63, 64] . Molecular mechanism of cleavage by NS3 has been studied in detail in Flaviviruses such as Dengue type II comparative modeling approach was used to predict its structure. Since the functional protease is a two-component system, the structure of its cofactor, NS2B was predicted using molecular dynamics and its interactions were studied using docking simulations. Ternary complex of NS3-NS2B-substrate was then modeled to understand the underlying mechanism.",
