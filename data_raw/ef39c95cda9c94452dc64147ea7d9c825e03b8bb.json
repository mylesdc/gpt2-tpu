            "text": "A wide array of wildlife species, including many animals, are used in traditional medicines across many medicinal systems, including in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). Due to over-exploitation and habitat loss, the populations of many animals commonly used in TCM have declined and are unable to meet market demand. A number of measures have been taken to try to reduce the impact that this large and growing market for TCM may have on wild animal species. Consumer preferences and behavior are known to play an important role in the consumption and protection of wild animals used in traditional medicine, and thus are likely to be an important factor in the success of many of these mechanisms-particularly given the significant percentage of TCMs that are over-the-counter products (access to which is not mediated by practitioners). In this study we conducted questionnaires and designed stated preference experiments embodying different simulation scenarios using a random sample of the population in Beijing to elicit individuals' knowledge, perceptions and preferences toward wild or farmed animal materials and their substitutes used in traditional Chinese medicine. We found that respondents had a stated preference for wild materials over farm-raised and other alternatives because they believe that the effectiveness of wildsourced materials is more credible than that of other sources. However, we also found that, although respondents used TCM products, they had a poor understanding of the function or composition of either traditional Chinese medicines or proprietary Chinese medicines (PCM), and paid little attention to the composition of products when making purchasing decisions. Furthermore, awareness of the need for species protection, or \"conservation consciousness\" was found to play an important role in willingness to accept substitutions for wild animal materials, while traditional animal medicinal materials (TAMs) derived from wellknown endangered species, such as bear bile and tiger bone, show relatively higher substitutability. These results suggest that there is still hope for conservation measures which PLOS ONE | seek to promote a transition to farmed animal, plant and synthetic ingredients and provide clear directions for future social marketing, education and engagement efforts.",

In addition, captive breeding programs and research on synthetic sources of medicinal materials have been conducted in China since the 1950s in an attempt to reduce the impact of TCM on wild populations [6] . Social marketing campaigns as strategies for changing public behavior [10] have also been instituted by a number of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and conservationists recently, with the primary aim of influencing and changing consumer attitudes and behaviors [11] [12] [13] [14] , and some studies also directed attention towards the possibility of farmed animals or other alternatives as substitutes for wild ones, such as tiger bone and bear bile [3, [15] [16] .",

Furthermore, consumer preferences are known to play an important role in consumer buying behaviors in the wildlife trade [3, 15, [17] [18] , and thus are likely to be a significant factor in the success of many of these mechanisms-particularly given the significant percentage of TCMs that are over-the-counter products (access to which is not mediated by practitioners).",

For example, existing research suggests that people may prefer products produced from wild animals because they believe that wild materials are more potent than farm-raised ones [3, 16] . Accordingly, some researchers have argued that the ability of farmed animal-based products, such as bear bile, to reduce demand for wild animal products is at best limited [15] . Furthermore, while the price of TCM materials, particularly those derived from animals, is increasing [22] and this might generally be thought to increase the demand for substitutes [3, 23] , the ongoing and pervasive influence of ancient tenets of TCM may mean consumers are in fact willing to pay a higher price for wild products rather than buy cheaper farmed products or substitutes [15, [17] [18] . Thus if current conservation mechanisms including substitution and captive breeding programs are to be successful and social marketing efforts appropriate designed and targeted [11] [12] 20] , a more in depth understanding of consumer preferences and beliefs will be an important first step toward preventing unsustainable wildlife consumption [19, 24] .",

We then asked whether respondents had heard of and used TAMs and inquired about their perception of the curative effects of TAMs and their willingness to use these materials. Respondents were then asked to identify the correct function of each TAM by choosing the correct answer from a prepared list of functions quoted from the Chinese Pharmacopoeia [5] . We also inquired how well the respondents knew the indications and compositions of PCMs. A seven-point Likert scale was employed as a data collection instrument for attitude questions.",

In order to elicit estimates respondent's preferences and willingness to choose medicines, the stated preference investigation had two parts. The first encouraged respondents to recall their experiences and knowledge of TCMs; the second elicited their preferences using a choice experiment and then respondents were debriefed to gain insight into the reasoning behind their choices [15] . We asked respondents to recall their experiences with purchasing or taking non-prescription TCMs, an illness scenario was described and participants were then instructed to imagine the following 3 scenarios before entering choice experiments: \"I am suffering from a disease and feeling a discomfort, and I need to purchase non-prescription TCMs for treatment.\" Respondents were then offered choice experiments in which a series of questions and corresponding sets of options from which participants could choose [15, 19] . The 3 scenarios were as follows: Scenario 1. The respondent was required to purchase 9 TCM products, including 3 types of TAMs, 2 TCM prescriptions, 2 PCMs, and 2 TCM health care products. Each TCM product contained TAMs from a wild animal, farmed animal, or substitute. It was explained that in this scenario these materials all had the same or very similar curative effects, and their prices were all affordable. To estimate consumer preferences, the respondent was asked to select their preference from 4 options: \"wild\", \"farmed\", \"substitute\", or \"whatever\" materials. If \"substitute\" or \"whatever\" were selected, the respondent then selected among 5 types of substitute materials, including \"wild animal\", \"farmed animal\", \"wild plant\", \"farmed plant\", \"synthetic\", or \"whatever\". After making a choice, the respondent was then asked to explain their choice. Scenario 2. The respondent was required to choose their preferred TAM from either \"wild\", \"farmed\", \"other animal materials\" as a substitute, \"plant material\" as a substitute, \"synthetic\" or \"whatever\" material under the following sets of conditions: (i) both the curative effects and prices of the TAMs were identical; (ii) the TAMs had identical curative effects but prices that decreased in the order presented above; and (iii) the TAMs had identical prices but curative effects that increased in the order presented above. These sets of conditions were then revisited in the context of purchasing 3 specific animal materials-musk, deer antler velvet, and bear bile. Scenario 3. The overall setup of this scenario remained the same as in Scenario 1, except that respondents were asked beforehand which TAMs should be protected. The proportion of respondents who believed that a certain TAM must be protected was used as an indicator of the \"conservation consciousness\" of that respondent.",

This is consistent with existing research indicating that consumers of TCM prefer products made from wild sources and believe such products are more potent [3, 16] .

Our results did suggest that conservation consciousness and a desire to protect endangered animals were significant factors in the choice to adopt substitutes to wild sourced TAMs. As their conservation consciousness increased, the respondents were more likely to choose substitutes and less likely to choose wild-source TAMs (Fig 5) . Thus, emphasizing conservation concerns has great potential for increasing the substitution of TAMs derived from wild sources (Fig 6) . This indicates that there may indeed be a place for conservation awareness raising efforts to impact on consumer consumption of wildlife products [13, 40] .

However, contrary to the predictions of supply-side conservation [3] , previous research has demonstrated that TCM consumers are willing to pay high prices to buy wild-sourced TAMs because they believe those products are more potent [15] [16] 35] . We observed that respondents were in fact price-conscious and more likely to choose the cheapest option available, i.e., synthetic materials. As the prices of wild-sourced TAMs increase, consumers tend to choose alternatives [18, 23, 41] . However, importantly, curative effects had an even more powerful, positive impact on consumer choice, which overrode price-consciousness for some respondents.",

Our study confirms the results of previous research that has documented a preference among TCM consumers for wild sourced ingredients. However, while other researchers have taken this as evidence of the fruitlessness of substitution strategies, by placing this preference within the context of more in depth data regarding consumers' knowledge, beliefs and stated preferences, our results reveal that significant potential for substitution remains. If future research confirms our finding that whilst consumers express a preference for wild products on the basis of a belief in the increased efficacy of such products, they in fact have little knowledge of and pay scant attention to the composition of the products they buy, this would suggest that there is considerable room for a transition to farmed animal, plant and synthetic ingredients in many of these products. Furthermore, the significant role that conservation consciousness played in the willingness of respondents to accept substitutes for wild animals, the greater willingness to accept substitutes for highly visible endangered species such as rhinoceros and tiger, and the role of the belief in the increased efficacy of wild ingredients, provide clear directions for future social marketing, education and engagement efforts.",
