Minor glycoproteins of Arteriviruses are responsible for virus entry and cellular tropism. The experimental methods for studying minor Arterivirus proteins are limited because of the lack of antibodies and nested open reading frames (ORFs). In this study, we generated recombinant EAV with separated ORFs 3 and 4, and Gp3 carrying HA-tag (Gp3-HA). The recombinant viruses were stable on passaging and replicated in titers similar to the wild-type EAV. Gp3-HA was incorporated into the virion particles as monomers and as a Gp2/Gp3-HA/Gp4 trimer. Gp3-HA localized in ER and, to a lesser extent, in the Golgi, it also co-localized with the E protein but not with the N protein. The co-localization of Gp3-HA and the E protein with ERGIC was reduced. Moreover, EAV with Gp3-HA could become a valuable research tool for identifying host cell factors during infection and the role of Gp3 in virus attachment and entry.",

Newly constructed plasmids were propagated in competent Escherichia coli strain DH5alpha (Thermo Scientific, Warszawa, Poland). Cloning vector pEAV211, which is a derivate of the pEAV030 (Genbank Y07862.2) and described in reference [17] , was used to generate mutant EAVs. We generated specific DNA fragments by overlap extension PCR and purified them from the gel with the aid of the Gel-out kit (A&A Biotechnology, Gdansk, Poland). RGEAVBamHI and RGEAVEcoRI were used as an external primers. First, the translation initiation codon of the EAV ORF4 was mutated (ATG > ACG) with primers Gp4KOFor and Gp4KORev, and the 2.345 bp fragment cloned back to pEAV211 with the restriction enzymes BamHI and EcoRI (Thermo Scientific, Poland) to generate pEAV211Gp4KO. In the second step, the AscI site was added after the stop codon of the ORF3 with primers EAV211AscIFor and EAV211AscIRev to generate the plasmid pEAV211Gp4KOAscI. The separation of the ORF3 and ORF4 was achieved by the overlap extension PCR with primers ReconAscGp4For and RGEAVEcoRI on the pEAV211 template and cloned to pEAV2114KOAscI with the AscI and EcoRI restriction enzymes to generate pEAV211s3/4. As the last step, the HA tag was added directly to ORF3's 3'-end with the use of primers RGEAVBamHIIFor and EAVGp3HARev and pEAV211s3/4 as a DNA template. The ligation after BamHI and AscI restriction enzyme digestion of the 1657 bp product produced the pEAV211Gp3-HA vector. All of the generated plasmids were sequenced with the RGEAVEcoRIRev primer (Genomed, Warszawa, Poland). Table 1 shows the list of used primers, while Figure 1 shows the cloning schematics.

The ORF4 3'-end overlaps with two ORFs coding Gp5 and ORF5a proteins. Moreover, joining the HA-tag directly with the Gp3 did not abolish the expression of Gp3 [20] , while the direct tagging of Gp2 with FLAG-tag made its expression impossible [21] . The cloning procedure is shown in Figure 1A . First, the start codon of Gp4 was mutated to produce the Gp4 knock-out virus, and then the restriction site AscI was generated to allow the separation of ORF3 and ORF4 by duplicating the missing ORF4 98 nt long sequence. Finally, the HA-tag sequence was directly inserted to the end of ORF3. All these mutations were generated using PCR methods. Subsequently, the in vitro-transcribed full-length viral RNAs from the XhoI-linearized plasmids pEAV211, pEAV211s3/4, and pEAV211Gp3-HA were introduced into the BHK-21 cells using electroporation. After 48 h, the cells were harvested and examined by western blotting analysis using antibodies that are specific to the N protein and HA-tag. The expression of Gp3-HA was only observed in cells transfected with in vitro-transcribed RNA produced from pEAV211Gp3-HA; however, it was not observed in pEAV211 (wt), pEAV211s3/4, or mock-transfected cells. Note that the size of the Gp3-HA was~35 kDa ( Figure 1B ). As shown in Figure 1B , which shows the successful replication of the EAV, the expression of the N protein was observed in cells transfected with in vitro-transcribed RNA produced from pEAV211 (wt), pEAV211s3/4, and pEAV211Gp3-HA, but not in the mock-transfected cells.",

The expression of Gp3-HA was analyzed by IF using cells infected with P7, P10, P15, and P19 ( Figure 2B ). The levels of N and Gp3-HA protein expression was stable up to P15; however, in cells infected with P19, the number of cells expressing Gp3-HA and fluorescence intensity were reduced. To determine whether these results were caused by the emergence of viruses containing mutations, the intracellular RNA was isolated after infection with P7, P10, P15, and P19 EAVGp3-HA virus and subjected to RT-PCR, followed by sequence analysis (Figure 2C ). Note that the consensus sequence was still present in P19; however, the chromatogram of the nt sequence of the HA-tag and the neighboring sequence showed the presence of mutated nucleotides, which may indicate the rise of the quasispecies viruses with accumulated mutations within the HA-tag sequence. Such quasispecies of viruses, which are present in the supernatant along with the original recombinant virus, can lead to diminished fluorescence intensity and loss of fluorescence from the HA-tag in certain infected cells. To summarize, this data indicate that the separation of ORF3 and ORF4 and introduction of Gp3-tag can be stably accommodated within the EAV genome and that the HA-tag added to C-terminus of Gp3 is expressed at least up to P15.",

Cell lysates were subjected to both non-reducing and reducing SDS-PAGE, followed by western blotting with anti-HA antibodies. In the non-reducing conditions, most of the Gp3-HA protein was present at the band of~35 kDa, and only a small fraction migrated to two faint bands of~50 kDa ( Figure 3A ). This indicates that the Gp3-HA in infected cells is present mostly in the monomeric form; however, some of it forms a multimeric structure that might correspond to the Gp3-HA dimer or the Gp3-HA associated with other viral or cellular proteins. In reducing conditions, the Gp3-HA displays a characteristic double-band pattern, which is caused by the heterologous glycosylation of the overlapping NNTT sequon, indicating that certain Gp3-HA molecules have 5 and some have 6 N-glycans [20] . To confirm that Gp3-HA in infected cells is indeed N-glycosylated, the cell lysates were digested with peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) (cleaves of all types of N-linked carbohydrates) or endo-\u03b2-N-acetyl-glucosaminidase (Endo H; cleaves only the high-mannose-type carbohydrates) prior to SDS-PAGE ( Figure 3A ). The carbohydrate chains from the intracellular Gp3 were completely cleaved by both these enzymes, confirming that Gp3-HA is retained in ER or a cis-Golgi compartment, as Endo H cannot cleave the N-glycans with additional modifications occurring in the medial or trans-Golgi. Therefore, the Gp3-HA expressed in infected cells exhibits the same behavior as in previously published data for the wild-type Gp3 [13, 20, 22] . ",

The expression of Gp3-HA was analyzed by IF using cells infected with P7, P10, P15, and P19 ( Figure 2B ). The levels of N and Gp3-HA protein expression was stable up to P15; however, in cells infected with P19, the number of cells expressing Gp3-HA and fluorescence intensity were reduced. To determine whether these results were caused by the emergence of viruses containing mutations, the intracellular RNA was isolated after infection with P7, P10, P15, and P19 EAVGp3-HA virus and subjected to RT-PCR, followed by sequence analysis ( Figure 2C ). Note that the consensus sequence was still present in P19; however, the chromatogram of the nt sequence of the HA-tag and the neighboring sequence showed the presence of mutated nucleotides, which may indicate the rise of the quasispecies viruses with accumulated mutations within the HA-tag sequence. Such quasispecies of viruses, which are present in the supernatant along with the original recombinant virus, can lead to diminished fluorescence intensity and loss of fluorescence from the HA-tag in certain infected cells. To summarize, this data indicate that the separation of ORF3 and ORF4 and introduction of Gp3-tag can be stably accommodated within the EAV genome and that the HA-tag added to C-terminus of Gp3 is expressed at least up to P15.",

Cell lysates were subjected to both non-reducing and reducing SDS-PAGE, followed by western blotting with anti-HA antibodies. In the non-reducing conditions, most of the Gp3-HA protein was present at the band of ~35 kDa, and only a small fraction migrated to two faint bands of ~50 kDa ( Figure 3A ). This indicates that the Gp3-HA in infected cells is present mostly in the monomeric form; however, some of it forms a multimeric structure that might correspond to the Gp3-HA dimer or the Gp3-HA associated with other viral or cellular proteins. In reducing conditions, the Gp3-HA displays a characteristic double-band pattern, which is caused by the heterologous glycosylation of the overlapping NNTT sequon, indicating that certain Gp3-HA molecules have 5 and some have 6 N-glycans [20] . To confirm that Gp3-HA in infected cells is indeed N-glycosylated, the cell lysates were digested with peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) (cleaves of all types of N-linked carbohydrates) or endo-\u03b2-N-acetyl-glucosaminidase (Endo H; cleaves only the high-mannose-type carbohydrates) prior to SDS-PAGE ( Figure 3A ). The carbohydrate chains from the intracellular Gp3 were completely cleaved by both these enzymes, confirming that Gp3-HA is retained in ER or a cis-Golgi compartment, as Endo H cannot cleave the N-glycans with additional modifications occurring in the medial or trans-Golgi. Therefore, the Gp3-HA expressed in infected cells exhibits the same behavior as in previously published data for the wild-type Gp3 [13, 20, 22] . ",

If the budding occurs where the Gp5/M is localized, this could be the mechanism of lower incorporation into the virions of minor proteins, i.e., they are not abundant at the assembly site. In this study, we have shown that the Gp3-HA and E localized mainly in the ER. However, the mechanism of lower incorporation of the E and minor glycoproteins in Arteriviruses might be different, and not dependent on the localization of the proteins. In coronaviruses the E protein, which is essential for virion formation, remains at the budding site, but is incorporated into virions in small amounts, by unknown mechanism [36] . In the influenza A virus the M2 protein is excluded from the budozone, presumably because it localizes at the edges of the lipid rafts at plasma membrane, the site of Infuenza A budding [37, 38] . Further experiments are needed to explain lower incorporation of the minor proteins into EAV virions.",
