Here, we use highly multiplexed proteomics to quantify $9,000 cellular proteins and $80% of viral proteins at seven time points throughout VACV infection. A total of 265 cellular proteins are downregulated >2-fold by VACV, including putative natural killer cell ligands and IFN-stimulated genes. Two-thirds of these viral targets, including class II histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5), are degraded proteolytically during infection. In follow-up analysis, we demonstrate that HDAC5 restricts replication of both VACV and herpes simplex virus type 1. By generating a proteinbased temporal classification of VACV gene expression, we identify protein C6, a multifunctional IFN antagonist, as being necessary and sufficient for proteasomal degradation of HDAC5. Our approach thus identifies both a host antiviral factor and a viral mechanism of innate immune evasion.",

            "text": ". The antigenic relatedness between orthopoxviruses leads to cross-protection to heterologous infections and explains why VACV was an effective live vaccine against smallpox, which culminated in the eradication of this disease in 1980 (Fenner et al., 1988 . Following the eradication of smallpox, research with VACV has continued because it is an excellent model for studying virus-host interactions, and because VACV is being developed as a vector for live vaccines against other infectious diseases and as an oncolytic agent. To improve the safety of VACV as a vaccine and to optimize its immunogenicity, there is a need to have a comprehensive understanding of the biology of VACV and its interactions with the host cell. VACV gene expression is conventionally divided into early, intermediate, and late phases (Moss, 2013) . Early genes encode multiple proteins that suppress innate and adaptive host immunity, in addition to factors that initiate DNA replication and regulate intermediate class gene expression (Hruby and Ball, 1982; Jones and Moss, 1984; Sanz and Moss, 1999; Smith et al., 1989a Smith et al., , 1989b Smith et al., 2013) . Intermediate genes chiefly encode transcription factors that regulate late gene expression. Late genes encode structural proteins, as well as other proteins incorporated into progeny virions including viral RNA transcription machinery and early gene transcription factors (Broyles and Fesler, 1990; Kane and Shuman, 1992; Rosel and Moss, 1985; Yang et al., 2011a) . Intermediate and late genes are expressed after the onset of genome replication and are collectively termed post-replicative genes (Keck et al., 1990; Vos and Stunnenberg, 1988) .",

In addition to encoding multiple proteins that inhibit the interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) and nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) signaling that would lead to expression of IFN-b (Smith et al., 2018) , VACV encodes at least three proteins to directly evade type I IFN. Protein B18 is secreted from infected cells and binds to type I IFNs extracellularly, preventing their engagement with IFN receptors (Colamonici et al., 1995; Symons et al., 1995) .

Furthermore, an unbiased analysis of proteins targeted by viruses for proteasomal degradation can predict antiviral factors (Nightingale et al., 2018) . Using multiplexed tandem-mass tag (TMT)-based proteomics we measured $9,000 host proteins and $80% of VACV proteins over seven time points throughout infection, providing a comprehensive temporal view of the host proteome and VACV virome. Our analysis revealed that VACV downregulates 265 proteins, including multiple cell surface collagens and protocadherins, which may act as natural killer (NK) cell ligands. Other insights included the downregulation of multiple ISGs including all canonical IFN-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFITs). Studying infection in the presence or absence of the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 showed that 69% of downregulated proteins were targeted for proteasomal degradation, including histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5). By generating a temporal system of classification of VACV protein expression, we predicted that the early viral protein C6 targets HDAC5 for degradation, which was confirmed using a mutant virus lacking C6 and a cell line expressing C6. Data presented define HDAC5 as a restriction factor that inhibits the replication of different families of DNA viruses.",

Flow cytometry confirmed that >95% of cells were infected ( Figure S1A ). Eleven-plex TMT and triple-stage mass spectrometry (MS3) were used to quantify changes in protein expression over seven time points ( Figure 1A ; Table S1 ). This quantified 8,991 human proteins and 172/216 viral proteins, providing a global view of changes in protein expression during infection ( Figure S1B ). Mock and early infection samples clustered separately from intermediate and late infection time points, with changes of the greatest magnitude occurring mostly late during infection (Figure 1B) .

However, there has been no systematic analysis of how VACV modulates NK or T cell recognition, in particular which ligands may be regulated in the infected cell. Therefore, these data were analyzed to determine which known NK and T cell ligands are down-or upregulated during infection. This revealed previously unrecognized modulation of multiple proteins. HLA-A, -B, and -C molecules were all downregulated during infection, in addition to nectin2, the ligand for activating NK receptor DNAM-1, and ULBP2, the ligand for activating NK receptor MHC class I polypeptide-related sequence A (MICA). The tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily member TNFRSF1A was also strongly downregulated ( Figure S2A ).",

This showed that 37 proteins had a relevant InterPro annotation and were at least 2-fold downregulated compared to mock infection. Twelve collagens and four protocadherins were downregulated, in addition to the tyrosine protein kinase receptor AXL, endosialin (CD248), and numerous other molecules involved in adhesion, signaling, and immunity (Figures 2A-2C and S2B-S2D;  Table S3 ).",

To identify proteins jointly downregulated by VACV and an unrelated double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) virus, these data were combined with our previous quantitative temporal analysis of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection ( Figure 3A ; Table S4A ). The DAVID software suggested that proteins downregulated by both viruses were also enriched in cell surface receptors ( Figure 3B ; Tables S4B   and S4C ). Previously, we identified HCMV-induced downregulation of multiple protocadherins and provided initial evidence that members of this family are activating NK cell ligands (Weekes et al., 2014) . Protocadherin gB5 was also downregulated during VACV infection, suggesting that this molecule might have a (A) Schematic of experimental workflow for each of three biological replicates. Cells were infected at MOI of 5 or mock infected ( Figure S1A ). Additionally, one mock and one infected sample were treated for 6 h with the viral DNA replication inhibitor cytosine arabinoside (AraC). (B) Hierarchical cluster analysis of all proteins quantified. An enlargement of three subclusters is shown (right panel), including multiple proteins that were substantially up-or downregulated. (C) Scatterplot of all proteins quantified at 18 h of infection. For all analyses in this manuscript, a mean fold change at each time point was calculated by averaging fold changes from each of the biological replicates in which the protein was quantified. For the purposes of comparison, the 18-h mock sample from each replicate was used, because the 0-, 6-, and 18-h mock samples behaved extremely similarly ( Figure S1E ). To perform a comprehensive analysis, ''sensitive'' criteria were employed, examining proteins down-or upregulated >2-fold on average across all replicates in which the protein was quantified (Table S2A) . Sensitive criteria were used in each analysis apart from where indicated. Data from ''stringent'' criteria that examined only proteins quantified in all three replicates with an average fold change > 2 and p < 0.05 are shown in Table S2C . For proteins quantified in all three replicates, a Benjamini-Hochberg-corrected two-tailed t test was used to estimate p values. Only proteins quantified in all three replicates are shown in this scatterplot. (D) Example of a previously unreported target of VACV infection. Data are represented as mean \u00b1 SEM; *p < 0.05 (see STAR Methods). Immunoblot of HFFF-TERTs infected with VACV (MOI = 5) confirmed rapid HDAC5 downregulation. particularly important role in innate immunity ( Figure 3C ). Eleven collagens were downregulated by both viruses, and for two of these this was confirmed by immunoblot ( Figure 2C ). Certain collagens may be ligands for the inhibitory leukocyte-associated Ig-like receptor-1 (LAIR-1) (Lebbink et al., 2008) , suggesting that their downregulation may be consistent with an appropriate response to intracellular infection. Given that certain NK ligands can have distinct roles depending on which receptor they bind (Vivier et al., 2008) , such broad collagen downregulation might equally be specifically triggered by VACV to engender immune evasion.",

Viral proteins D8 and C6 were representative of late and early gene expression, respectively. species, and play key roles in restricting a diversity of RNA viruses including Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), and influenza A (Vladimer et al., 2014) . The canonical mechanism of IFIT restriction is thought to be recognition of RNA modified via 5 0 triphosphorylation, or lacking methylation at the 2 0 -O of the 5 0 guanosine. Direct inhibition of RNA viral translation has also been reported (Daffis et al., 2010; Pichlmair et al., 2011) . Our observation that both VACV and HCMV downregulate IFITs ( Figure 3C ; Table S4C ) suggests that this whole class of proteins may have an as yet unrecognized mechanism of restricting DNA viruses in addition to RNA viruses. We quantified 29 tripartite motif containing proteins (TRIMs), of which TRIM 5, 13, 25, 26, and 56 were downregulated during infection. TRIM5 was also targeted by HCMV ( Figure 3C ; Tables S2A and S2B). TRIM5 can restrict retroviruses, and TRIM56 inhibits diverse RNA viruses including influenza, dengue, and yellow fever virus (Liu et al., 2014 (Liu et al., , 2016 Rahm and Telenti, 2012) . Interestingly, TRIM56 has recently also been shown to monoubiquitylate the cytosolic sensor cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS), resulting in a marked increase in cGAMP production. Mice deficient in TRIM56 exhibited increased susceptibility to lethal infection by herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) (Seo et al., 2018) . It is therefore possible that downregulation of TRIM56 by VACV represents another mechanism of viral evasion of DNA sensing pathways, and suggests that further examination of the IFITs, IFITMs, and TRIMs may identify DNA viral restriction factors, or components of antiviral pathways.",

We quantified $80% of all predicted VACV proteins.

Proteins that were not apparently inhibited by AraC in The k-means approach was used with 1-15 classes to cluster viral proteins, and the summed distance of each protein from its cluster centroid was calculated. Although this summed distance necessarily becomes smaller as more clusters are added, the rate of decline decreases with each added group, eventually settling at a fairly constant rate of decline that reflects overfitting; clusters added prior to this point reflect the underlying structure in the temporal protein data, whereas clusters subsequently added through overfitting are not informative.

Table S5. the latest class may simply reflect the stringent threshold employed, or the time point of harvesting of AraC-treated samples. We next compared our protein-level data with an RNA-seqbased definition of transcriptional classes from the manuscripts of Yang et al. (2010 Yang et al. ( , 2011b . Comparison to the protein data was striking: 18/18 Tp1 proteins were E1.1 or E1.2 class transcripts, and 60/69 Tp4 proteins were I or L transcripts (p < 0.0001, Fisher's exact test). The Tp2 class of proteins was additionally enriched in E1.2 transcripts (Figures 4F and S4A; Table S5 ). Such correspondence between different studies targeting distinct classes of biomolecules suggests that the temporal classes of VACV protein expression defined here are likely to be biologically relevant, and suggests that the temporal regulation of VACV gene expression is chiefly exerted at the transcriptional level. The comparison also highlights some interesting differences. For example, certain transcripts produced early during infection were not expressed maximally until later as Tp3-class proteins, including DNA-dependent RNA polymerase subunits E4 and G5.5, and G2, which has roles in post-replicative transcription elongation ( Figure S4A , cluster 3). This suggests that additional mechanisms for temporal regulation of virus gene expression might operate during infection. Additionally, our data were compared to 47 viral proteins that were assigned the same temporal class in each of two time courses by Croft et al. (2015) . These proteins exhibited similar classifications between both studies: 4/5 Tp1 proteins were Croft et al. temporal class 1 and 19/20 Tp4 proteins were Croft et al. temporal classes 3 or 4 ( Figure S4B ; Table S5 ).",

This approach was adapted to determine which of the proteins that are downregulated by VACV are also proteasomally degraded. MG132 or DMSO was added 2 h after VACV or mock infection to enable virus uncoating in the host cells prior to inhibition of the proteasome. An MG132 ''rescue ratio'' for each of 8,263 quantified proteins was obtained by comparing protein abundance during VACV infection \u00b1 inhibitor with protein abundance during mock infection \u00b1 inhibitor. This ratio enabled identification of proteins that exhibited increased degradation during VACV infection, as opposed to those having a high baseline turnover in mock-infected cells. Of the proteins downregulated >2-fold, 69% had a rescue ratio >1.5 with p < 0.05, suggesting that one of the predominant mechanisms VACV employs to downregulate proteins is proteasomal degradation ( Figure 5A ). All IFITs, TRIMs, and Ephrin receptors downregulated >2-fold were rescued by MG132. By contrast, only COL6A2 proteins (isoforms 1 and 2) were rescued; six other downregulated collagens did not meet the criteria for rescue, suggesting an alternative mechanism of downregulation (Figures 5A and 5B; Table S6A ).",

Furthermore, dividing viral proteins into temporal classes revealed that most Tp1 and some Tp2 proteins were upregulated by MG132; Tp3 class proteins were largely unaffected, and Tp4-class proteins were inhibited ( Figure 5C ). This suggests that many of the earliest-expressed VACV proteins may be proteasomally degraded. Given that Tp1 and Tp2 class proteins are enriched in ''host interaction'' functions ( Figure 4G ), this may partly be explained by co-degradation of some of these viral proteins with their host targets. Otherwise, the upregulation of some Tp1 and Tp2 proteins might be a consequence of the inhibition of viral DNA replication and post-replicative gene expression by MG132, leading to a prolonged accumulation of early viral mRNAs and their protein products (Baldick and Moss, 1993; Parrish and Moss, 2006) Identification of Candidate Viral-Host Interactions VACV has a dsDNA genome of 191 kbp and is predicted to encode >200 proteins (Goebel et al., 1990) . Identification of which viral protein targets a given cellular factor can therefore be a challenging task. We recently described an approach that makes direct comparison between viral and cellular protein profiles (Weekes et al., 2014) . HDAC5 was rapidly degraded during infection ( Figure 1D ), was one of the proteins most substantially rescued by MG132 ( Figures 5A and 6A) , and was also downregulated by HCMV, suggesting that this molecule might be particularly important in the life cycle of diverse viruses (Tables S2A and  S4B ). To determine which class of viral protein targets HDAC5, we compared the four protein class centroid profiles ( Figure 4B ) to an inverted profile of HDAC5. This most closely matched Tp2 class proteins ( Figure 6B ), suggesting that one of the 38 proteins in this class may target HDAC5.",

Further, in four independently derived CRISPR/Cas9 knockout clones (in HeLa and HEK293T cells), the replication of both viruses was enhanced compared to control (Figures 7C-7H ). Re-introduction of HDAC5 restored restriction of these viruses ( Figure 7E ).

Until now there have been only two proteomic analyses of host and viral proteins during VACV infection, both limited by the technology available to the investigators at the time. In the first, only 24 human and 3 viral proteins were quantified due to the use of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis to pick individual protein spots for analysis (Bartel et al., 2011) . In the second, a total of $3,400 proteins were quantified at a single late time after infection. However, nearly all of the proteins that changed in response to infection were viral gene products, with very little modulation of the host proteome observed (Chou et al., 2012) . In this study, we applied quantitative temporal viromics (Weekes et al., 2014) to take a comprehensive view of the changes in the viral and cellular proteomes throughout VACV infection. We labeled peptides with TMT tags and measured proteins using MS3 on an Orbitrap Lumos, which can provide a uniquely precise quantitative measurement of protein abundances on a near-global proteomic scale (Ting et al., 2011) . Our data thus provide a valuable resource for future studies of poxvirus infection.",

This is in contrast to our previous study of HCMV infection (which does not cause host shutoff), in which 1,740/7,491 proteins were downregulated >2-fold (Weekes et al., 2014) . HCMV and VACV have a broadly similar number of canonical genes. The differential regulation of the host observed might therefore reflect differences in viral biology. We have shown that certain individual herpesviral proteins can regulate multiple host targets. For example, HCMV US2 can alone regulate R 21 proteins including MHC mole-cules and integrins, and a single Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus protein, K5, can regulate 83 cell surface proteins (Hsu et al., 2015; Timms et al., 2013) . It is possible that VACV proteins each individually have a paucity of discrete functions; thus, the summed effect of $200 viral genes is relatively modest. Nevertheless, C6 had at least 3 targets including E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF114 and Cerebellar degeneration-related protein 2 (CDR2) ( Figure 6D ). Alternatively, the degree of regulation of the host by VACV may be small in comparison to HCMV. Since all herpesviruses exhibit latent as well as lytic infection, and must enter and exit the nucleus during lytic replication, such increased complexity to the viral life cycle may also require increased regulation of the infected cell. The scatterplot shows all proteins quantified. A Benjamini-Hochberg-corrected two-tailed t test was used to estimate p values.

            "text": "One benefit of quantifying common protein changes induced by distinct classes of viruses is the prediction of molecules of particular importance in immunity. The finding that HDAC5 is downregulated by both HCMV and VACV suggested that this molecule might play an important role during infection, such as in antiviral restriction. We demonstrate that HDAC5 indeed restricts both VACV and HSV-1. Previously, HDAC5 was reported to interact with proteins from other viruses, although had not hitherto been identified as a restriction factor, or shown to be downregulated during infection. The HSV-1 immediate protein ICP0 interacted with HDAC5 and inhibited its repression of the cellular myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) promoter (Lomonte et al., 2004) . HDAC5 could repress activation of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) promoter by the EBV protein EBNA2. Repression was overcome by the co-activator EBNA-LP (Portal et al., 2006) . Potential mechanisms that could explain restriction by HDAC5 of viruses replicating in distinct cellular niches therefore include inhibition of viral promoters (via HDAC5 nucleocytoplasmic shuttling) or, possibly, modulation of the IFN pathway or other innate immune signaling pathways. This is under investigation in our laboratory. The VACV C6 protein regulates both IRF-3 and type I IFN signaling and co-precipitates with the TBK1 adaptor proteins SINTBAD, NAP1, and TANK , and with STAT2 via the transactivation domain (TAD) (Stuart et al., 2016) . HDAC5 is also known to co-precipitate with STAT2 (Nusinzon and Horvath, 2003) . Future studies will address if and how HDAC5 is ubiquitinated, and how C6 interacts with HDAC5, E2, and E3 ligases and any other required accessory proteins.",

Restriction of VACV by IFITs and TRIMs would highlight additional viral strategies to usurp IFN-mediated antiviral effectors. Candidate viral effectors include the Tp2-class C9 protein, which was recently mapped as an antagonist of IFN action and shown to co-precipitate with components of the SCF (SKP, cullin-1, F-box) E3 ligase complex (Liu and Moss, 2018) . Host targets that may be degraded by C9 are not yet described; however, of note is that C9 itself was significantly upregulated by MG132 (Table S1 ), which may suggest it is codegraded (Nightingale et al., 2018) . In addition to viral uncoating, the proteasome has been shown to be required for VACV DNA replication; however, it had hitherto been unclear why (Mercer et al., 2012; Satheshkumar et al., 2009; Teale et al., 2009) . A possible explanation may be to overcome HDAC5 restriction and to permit virus infection to progress beyond genome replication.

Understanding of VACV gene expression had hitherto mainly been at the transcript level. We now provide a temporal system of classification of VACV protein expression complementary to and consistent with the transcriptionally based E1.1/E1.2/I/L nomenclature. A particular use of these temporal protein profiles is the ability to correlate viral and host protein expression, which can predict the class of viral proteins responsible for modulation of each host protein. With additional functional information, such as a knowledge of which proteins in each class can modulate IFN, the individual viral gene required can readily be identified, as shown here for the degradation of HDAC5 by C6.",

A minimum one unique or shared peptide per protein was used for quantitation. Briefly, a 0.003 Th window around the theoretical m/z of each reporter ion (126, 127n, 127c, 128n, 128c, 129n, 129c, 130n, 130c, 131n, 131c) was scanned for ions, and the maximum intensity nearest to the theoretical m/z was used. The primary determinant of quantitation quality is the number of TMT reporter ions detected in each MS3 spectrum, which is directly proportional to the signal-tonoise (S:N) ratio observed for each ion (Makarov and Denisov, 2009) . Conservatively, every individual peptide used for quantitation was required to contribute sufficient TMT reporter ions (minimum of $1250 per spectrum) so that each on its own could be expected to provide a representative picture of relative protein abundance (McAlister et al., 2012) . Additionally, an isolation specificity filter was employed to minimize peptide co-isolation (Ting et al., 2011) . Peptide-spectral matches with poor quality MS3 spectra (more than 9 TMT channels missing and/or a combined S:N ratio of less than 250 across all TMT reporter ions) or no MS3 spectra at all were excluded from quantitation. Peptides meeting the stated criteria for reliable quantitation were then summed by parent protein, in effect weighting the contributions of individual peptides to the total protein signal based on their individual TMT reporter ion yields. Protein quantitation values were exported for further analysis in Excel.",

Technical aspects of the expreiments. related to (A) Flow cytometry of HFFF-TERTs 12 h post infection using a mAb against late protein D8 (Parkinson and Smith, 1994) confirmed > 95% of cells were infected. A total 10,000 events were recorded, followed by sequential gating of HFFF-TERTs and single-cell populations. Isotype antibody staining of infected cells and D8 staining of non-infected cells were used to define the boundaries between \"D8-positive\" and \"D8negative\" cells. Data shown are from experiment 1, and are representative of all three replicates. (B) Peptides and proteins quantified in each experiment in this manuscript. (C) Number of proteins that changed by sensitive or stringent criteria (see Figure 1C for definition of these criteria). (D) Validation of down-or up-regulation of proteins already reported to be modulated by VACV. Data are represented as mean \u00b1 SEM; *p<0.05, *p<0.01 (see STAR Methods). Error bars and statistics are not included on the plot for Fos as this protein was not quantified in all three replicates; full data is shown in Table S1 . (E) Correspondence between mock samples. Each graph shows log 2 (normalised signal:noise) for every protein assessed in all three biological replicates. plots for HLA-C, TNFRSF10B, ULBP2, COL10A1, COL15A1, CELSR3, FAT3, PCDHB8, PCDHGA6, PCDHGA10, PCDHGB4 as these proteins were not quantified in all three replicates; full data is shown in Table S1 . (A) Comparison between temporal protein profiles (this study) and transcript expression profiles (Yang et al., 2015) , grouped according to protein class. For each protein or transcript, expression was normalised to the maximum across the measured time points. (B) Comparison of viral protein classes between this study and (Croft et al., 2015) .
