We compared the results of these assays with the pulmonary pathologies and the clinical course of illness for each patient. SARS-CoV nucleoprotein and RNA were detected by immunohistochemistry and ISH, respectively, primarily in alveolar pneumocytes and, less frequently, in macrophages. Such localization was detected in four of the seven patients who died within two weeks of illness onset, and in none of the 25 patients who died later than two weeks after symptom onset.",

It had an alarming tendency to spread to health care workers, and unlike most respiratory viral infections, predominantly involved the lower respiratory tract. The disease was associated with an unusually high morbidity and mortality; 20%-30% of patients developed severe respiratory symptoms requiring intensive care support [2, 3, 5] . Worldwide, the average case mortality rate was 10.0%, but in Hong Kong and Toronto, the case mortality rate was 17.0%, with older patients and those with chronic illnesses having a worse outcome [1, 2, 5] .",

In a primate model system, experimental infection of cynomolgus macaques with SARS-CoV alone was sufficient to cause a disease complex similar to that observed in humans [9, 10] . Genetically, the coronavirus species closest to SARS-CoV are those isolated from small animals traded for culinary purposes, such as the Himalayan palm civet and raccoon-dog, which show 99.8% sequence homology but differ by the insertion of a 29-nucleotide fragment [11] . It is postulated that both coronaviruses have probably arisen from a common natural reservoir, with facilitated interspecies transmission and possibly genetic alteration to SARS-CoV during the close handling and trading of the animals in the same environment.",

Multiple blocks were extensively sampled from all lobes of the lungs for HK cases 1, 6, 7, and 9-13; limited representative blocks were sampled from HK cases 2-5 and 8. For all Toronto cases, approximately half of each lung lobe was removed at autopsy, and a portion was snap-frozen for molecular studies. Multiple blocks of tissue were processed from each lobe for light microscopic examination. Stains for microorganisms and for collagen, and immunohistochemical stains for microorganisms, were performed as necessary. The clinical profiles were retrieved from the patients' records. HK case 1 was a patient who died in the quarantine period for SARS exposure during hospitalization for congestive heart failure. PCR of a throat swab was positive on the fifth day after symptom onset, and she developed fever and respiratory symptoms thereafter. HK case 13 was a patient who died unexpectedly during convalescence from SARS. All other patients died of SARS with progressive deterioration in lung function. All HK patients except cases 1 and 13 had received ventilatory support during life. The pulmonary histopathological features of six of the HK cases (2-6 and 8) have been previously reported [12] . In addition to the autopsy tissue from all HK cases, HK case 5 also had an open lung biopsy, which was also included in this study. Descriptions of the procurement and clinical courses of the TO cases have been described in previous reports [14, 16] .",

In two of the cases that were positive for IHC in the lung, other organs were examined for IHC. In HK case 1, when there was strong positive IHC and ISH staining of the lung identified, no IHC-or ISH-positive cells were identified in other organs examined (adrenal gland, kidney, spleen, liver, and heart). In TO case 4, which also showed positive lung staining, no other organs were positive by IHC or ISH (liver, spleen, and kidney). Examination of three other TO cases that stained negative in the lung also showed no positive extrapulmonary staining.",

SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein and RNA were also detected in an open lung biopsy from a patient on day 5 after symptom onset (before death), but not in the same patient's autopsy lung specimen collected on day 20 after symptom onset. Among those lung samples staining positive by ISH or IHC, the signals localized mainly to the alveolar epithelial cells, with lower intensity in alveolar macrophages, indicating that the former are the chief target cells of the virus. Only scattered positive cells were identified in the bronchiolar epithelium, and no significant staining of the bronchial epithelium was observed. No distinctive spread to regional lymph nodes was seen, and we were not able to determine colocalization with DC-SIGN-positive cells. Using an oligonucleotide probe with signal amplification, Nakajima et al. demonstrated SARS-CoV genomes in the alveolar epithelium and macrophages of a 46-year-old woman with SARS, but details of the clinical course of the disease were not stated [19] . The preferential localization of the virus to alveolar cell components relative to the bronchial epithelium seen at the time of death suggests that the alveolar environment might be more permissive to viral replication, and could also account for the high incidence of lower respiratory tract involvement. It should be noted, however, that there are no studies of SARS in humans in which bronchial or tracheal biopsy material from nonfatal cases has been examined. Therefore, whether there is SARS-CoV replication in these parts of the respiratory tract, as is the case in nonhuman primates [10] , remains unanswered.",

It has also been noted that viral loads detected by RT-PCR or viral culture from nasopharyngeal aspirates, urine, and stool samples start to decrease 10-15 d after symptom onset, correlating with the time taken for the development of specific anti-SARS antibodies, which starts approximately 10 d from disease onset [5, 20] .",

To et al., using ISH combined with IHC, found dual labeling of only epithelial cells using AE1/AE3 and negative staining for macrophages (antibody CD68) [21] . In contrast, Chen and Hsiao, using ISH, demonstrated a positive signal in carboncontaining macrophages and also within vascular lumina [22] . A later report, also from Taiwan and using ISH, demonstrated positive signal in pneumocytes and not in macrophages, but it is not clear if the same patient material (from a 36-year-old woman) was used in these last two publications [23] . The discrepancies between these findings may be partially explained by three factors: the choice of probes, the age of the patient, and the disease progression. To et al. [21] used the membrane (M) gene, whilst Chow et al. [23] used a mixture of probes (N, M, and replicase [REP]) and found the greatest intensity with the N and M gene and minimal staining with the REP. Our findings support those of both To et al. and Chow et al., in that there was mainly epithelial staining but also definite macrophage (CD68) dual staining, suggesting that, although epithelial cells are the main target of SARS-CoV, the presence of viral RNA in macrophages represents either phagocytosis or low-level replication in these cells. None of these previous ISH-based studies have demonstrated ISH-positive lymphocytes, as reported by Gu et al. [24] .",

It is possible that the material used for the To et al. study came from early cases. Shieh et al. describe finding type 2 pneumocytes positive for SARS-CoV in one patient [15] . However, in this study, staining appeared to be restricted to morphological type 1 pneumocytes, in keeping with the findings of Haagmans et al. [25] . However, Haagmans et al. were unable to demonstrate macrophage uptake of SARS-CoV [25] . We also found occasional bronchiolar epithelial cells that were positive for SARS-CoV by ISH, IHC, and electron microscopy, which has not been noted in other studies. To this extent, the immunohistochemical findings are similar to those seen with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections, in which there is staining of bronchial epithelial cells, pneumocytes, and macrophages [26] . The age of the patient is also important, as SARS has been associated with greater mortality in the elderly than in the younger age group, and laboratory studies have shown that ''aged'' mice infected with SARS-CoV had more severe disease and greater cytokine production than younger mice [27] . Thus, differences in age may also be responsible for some of the differences noted between published results.",

As giant cells were seen mainly in patients after 14 d of disease duration, whether they have the same mechanism of formation as seen in animal models needs further investigation. Interestingly, multinucleated epithelial cells have been noted in lung infections due to other viruses such as measles, parainfluenza, and respiratory syncytial viruses. In fact, none of the changes observed in the present cases is unique for SARS-CoV infection. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying DAD and subsequent pulmonary fibrosis have been investigated in clinical and experimental models [28, 29] . It has been shown that proinflammatory and fibrogenic cytokine pathways are activated within the first 24-48 h following pulmonary insult [30, 31] . High initial levels of these activities are associated with persistent pulmonary damage and increased risks of subsequent pulmonary fibrosis and poor outcome in DAD [32] [33] [34] .",

This quantitative PCR method has been shown to be of value in determining viral load of viruses in peripheral blood, such as Epstein-Barr virus; but unlike blood, lung tissue is not homogeneous and, in an assessment of viral copies per gram of tissue, whether the tissue sample contains bronchus, scar tissue, edema fluid, or exudates is crucial. In addition, blood in tissues may lead to false-positive PCR results due to viremia rather than viral replication in the tissue. In this study, persons with high SARS-CoV viral loads in their lung tissue had good correlation with the IHC and ISH results [18] , but lower lung and organ tissue viral loads showed negative results. These lower viral loads may reflect a small amount of residual genome from a previous infection comparable to RSV infections reported in both stable as well as acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients [35] . This is a possible explanation for the low level of RT-PCR positivity in the lung tissues and in other tissues in SARS patients in which we could not detect SARS-CoV by IHC or ISH. Furthermore, in the fatal cases of SARS most patients had seroconverted at the time of death (unpublished data). However, we cannot exclude the possibility of low-level replication in these tissues that was not detectable by IHC and ISH, due to possible limitations of the sensitivity of these assays.",

The predominant infiltrating cell in the lungs were macrophages, and this agrees with finding of high levels of macrophage-trophic chemokines in vivo, and in response to SARS-CoV infection in vitro [36] . However, the relative contributions of direct viral damage versus immunopathology in the pathogenesis of SARS remains unclear. Detectable levels of intracellular viral RNA and proteins in lung tissue are present in only the earliest phase of the disease, and they disappear by 2 wk after the onset of symptoms. Although we found only four positive cases by ISH and IHC, and all these were in patients who died within the first 2-wk period, it is likely that many of the negative postmortem cases would have been positive had a lung biopsy been performed earlier. Lack of IHC and ISH staining of extrapulmonary tissues in fatal cases of early SARS suggest that viral involvement of major organs may not be as widespread as data based on RT-PCR results have previously suggested. Our findings have important implications on the clinical and therapeutic management of SARS should it return in the future, in that if antiviral therapy is to be instituted, there may be a broader window of opportunity for intervention with antiviral therapy than there is, for example, with influenza, in which treatment within 48 h is required for discernible clinical impact. clinical chart reviews.

            "text": "Background. The first SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) outbreak started in November 2002 in China, and over the next five months spread to a number of other cities around the world. During that time, 20%-30% of the infected people became seriously ill, and 10% died. SARS is caused by the SARS-CoV, which infects the lungs of patients and leads to breathing problems. Since the outbreak, scientists around the world have been working hard to understand the SARS virus and how it causes disease, and to develop drug treatments and vaccines.Why Was This Study Done? For this study, researchers from Hong Kong and Toronto (both cities hit by the SARS outbreak) joined forces for a large and detailed study of the bodies of patients who had died from SARS. They hoped that this would help them to understand how the virus had killed the patients, and when and how certain treatments might be most effective. The researchers wanted to see whether there were differences between individuals who died from SARS at different times after they first fell ill. They were also interested in the distribution of SARS-infected cells in the lungs of these patients, and whether they could detect the SARS virus outside of the lung in other parts of the body.What Did the Researchers Do and Find? They studied the organs of 32 patients who had died from SARS. The researchers had detailed clinical information on each of them. Some had died less than a week after they became ill, and others had died after more than a month. The researchers used a variety of modern scientific tools to visualize exactly where in the bodies the SARS virus had reached. They detected the virus in the lungs of most patients who died within two weeks of falling ill, but not in the lungs of any of the patients who died after more than two weeks of illness. Where detectable, the virus was mostly found in an area of the lung called the alveolar epithelium. Each of your lungs is made up of a network of breathing tubes, and each tube ends in a tiny pouch called an alveolus, which is surrounded by blood vessels. When you breathe in oxygen, it eventually passes into your bloodstream across the lining of these pouches, and this lining is the alveolar epithelium. The researchers also examined other organs (including heart, kidney, and liver) from two of the patients whose lungs had tested positive for the virus and three others who had shown no sign of virus in the lungs. They did not detect the virus in any of these samples.What Does This Mean? These results suggest that the SARS virus causes illness and death by attacking cells in the alveolar epithelium. The virus multiplies mostly within this group of cells, and only for a limited time after infection. Antiviral drugs are likely to be only useful during this initial time window after infection. After less than two weeks, the body's immune system seems to be able to fight back and prevent the virus from further multiplying, but this does not lead to recovery in all patients. In fact, most of the patients in this study (25 out of 32) died more than two weeks after they became ill and without signs that the SARS virus was still multiplying in their body. This suggests that in patients who die, the initial damage to the lungs is so severe that they cannot recover, and this is not dependent on continued virus replication. The study also suggests that death from SARS is not due to the virus multiplying outside of the lungs. ",
