Intrinsically disordered proteins are less complex and are dominated by certain residues (E, K, R, G, Q, S, P, A) [1, 2, 3, 4] . Mutational pressure has been the dominant evolution driving force in determining the different codon usage preferences in ssRNA viruses [5] . For example, coding sequences of all negative-stranded RNA viruses are biased toward high A in the coding sequences and high T in genomes suggesting that RNA viruses with different genome polarity are under different mutational pressure [6] .",

A number of viral proteins with an appreciable extent of disorder have been structurally investigated. We investigated 17 viral proteins from the DISPROT [7] database of disordered proteins of known structure (Table S6) . We anticipated that there would be a higher GC content among those viral proteins for which a greater proportion of the residues are observed to be disordered. We noted that IUPred strongly underpredicted the extent of disorder in the shorter proteins (Table S3) . Among the longer proteins, the one Pushker et al supporting information whose gene had the highest GC content (HHV2 alpha trans-inducing protein), had an IUPred prediction that matched the DISPROT observation exactly, suggesting that GC content does not necessarily bias IUPred predictions upwards. Selecting the nine proteins that are more than 250 residues long, there is a positive correlation between observed disorder and GC content (Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.38), but the sample size is too small to draw any general inference. However, we note that this correlation is similar to that seen for predicted disorder. Thus, we have no reason to believe that IUPred is overpredicting disorder in GC rich proteins, since the observed disorder in this small dataset of larger proteins shows a similar level of correlation.",

There was a reasonable correlation of predictions using an alternative method, E-spritz [10] , which is a machine learning predictor trained on known datasets, in contrast to the biophysical prediction of IUPRED ( Supplementary Fig. S13) While we focused on predictions for individual residues, it must be noted that disorder predictions are strongly correlated with the predictions for adjacent residues, so that much of these residues fall into regions of more extended disorder. Supplementary Table S4 indicates that estimating a viral proteome's disorder propensity based on regions rather than on residues generated results that were broadly correlated. We opted to focus on residue predictions, to avoid the increase in sampling variance created by surveying the presence or absence of larger regions across very short proteins and smaller proteomes.",

This viral protein was identified in this marmoset virus, but displayed no sequence homology to previously identified proteins [11] . This is not unusual for disordered proteins, which often evolve much faster than ordered proteins. It does present a particular challenge in elucidating the role of these proteins in viruses, since homology to ordered domains often gives insights into their functional roles. The Porcine adenovirus A protein 22K (DUF2890) has homologues across many adenoviruses, but the role of this disordered protein has not been established. While the herpesvirus protein with 100% predicted disorder is clearly high, the average disorder for Herpesviridae (Table 2) is also relatively high, at 17.9%. The observation that another protein (CPXV136) from the large Cowpox virus is 73% disordered is particularly striking, in the context that the mean disorder for this genome is only 5.6% (Table 2 ). It will be very interesting to determine whether this protein interacts with host components.",
