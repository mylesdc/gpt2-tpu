            "text": "Lassa virus (LASV) is the causative agent of a fatal hemorrhagic fever in humans. The glycoprotein (GP) of LASV mediates viral entry into host cells, and correct processing and modification of GP by host factors is a prerequisite for virus replication. Here, using an affinity purification-coupled mass spectrometry (AP-MS) strategy, 591 host proteins were identified as interactors of LASV GP. Gene ontology analysis was performed to functionally annotate these proteins, and the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex was highly enriched. Functional studies conducted by using CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockouts showed that STT3A and STT3B, the two catalytically active isoforms of the OST complex, are essential for the propagation of the recombinant arenavirus rLCMV/LASV glycoprotein precursor, mainly via affecting virus infectivity. Knockout of STT3B, but not STT3A, caused hypoglycosylation of LASV GP, indicating a preferential requirement of LASV for the STT3B-OST isoform. Furthermore, double knockout of magnesium transporter 1 (MAGT1) and tumor suppressor candidate 3 (TUSC3), two specific subunits of STT3B-OST, also caused hypoglycosylation of LASV GP and affected virus propagation. Site-directed mutagenesis analysis revealed that the oxidoreductase CXXC active-site motif of MAGT1 or TUSC3 is essential for the glycosylation of LASV GP. NGI-1, a small-molecule OST inhibitor, can effectively reduce virus infectivity without affecting cell viability. The STT3Bdependent N-glycosylation of GP is conserved among other arenaviruses, including both the Old World and New World groups. Our study provided a systematic view of LASV GP-host interactions and revealed the preferential requirement of STT3B for LASV GP N-glycosylation. IMPORTANCE Glycoproteins play vital roles in the arenavirus life cycle by facilitating virus entry and participating in the virus budding process. N-glycosylation of GPs is responsible for their proper functioning; however, little is known about the host factors on which the virus depends for this process. In this study, a comprehensive LASV GP interactome was characterized, and further study revealed that STT3Bdependent N-glycosylation was preferentially required by arenavirus GPs and critical for virus infectivity. The two specific thioredoxin subunits of STT3B-OST MAGT1 and TUSC3 were found to be essential for the N-glycosylation of viral GP. NGI-1, a smallmolecule inhibitor of OST, also showed a robust inhibitory effect on arenavirus. Our study provides new insights into LASV GP-host interactions and extends the potential targets for the development of novel therapeutics against Lassa fever in the future.",

GPs of NW arenaviruses, such as JUNV and MACV, bind to transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) to facilitate entry (22) , while OW arenaviruses use alpha-dystroglycan (\u2423-DG) or neuropilin-2 (NRP2) as their cell surface receptors (23, 24) . Upon delivery to the late endosome, the GP of LASV undergoes an acidic pH-induced receptor switch to the intracellular receptor LAMP1, thereby facilitating membrane fusion to release the viral ribonucleoprotein complex into the cytosol (25) . Arenavirus GPs also play an important role in the budding of virus progeny by interacting with Z protein, which provides the driving force of budding (26) . By recruiting the matrix protein Z and the assembled nucleocapsid to virus budding sites, GP determines the apical release of nascent LASV from polarized epithelial cells (27) .",

Despite the lack of cleavage in these latter glycosylation mutants, transport of a single glycosylation site-mutated GPC to the cell surface is not impaired, indicating that a single N-glycosylation site and proteolytic cleavage are not necessary for its intracellular trafficking (33) . N-glycans in LASV GP also promote immune evasion in humans by shielding the virus from host neutralizing antibodies (34) . This finding is in line with historical reports that passive serum therapy provided to cynomolgus monkeys or patients generated only limited protection efficacy (35, 36) .",

            "text": "Novel therapeutic strategies to control arenavirus-induced diseases require a thorough understanding of virus-host interactions. However, little is known about the comprehensive host interactome of LASV GP. In this study, an affinity purificationcoupled mass spectrometry (AP-MS) strategy was used to identify host proteins interacting with LASV GP, and the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex was highlighted. The OST complex is responsible for the N-glycosylation process in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen, where it catalytically transfers a preassembled oligosaccharide to the amide group of an asparagine residue within the consensus N-X-T/S motif of a nascent polypeptide (37) . Multiple subunits of the mammalian OST complex have been reported, including defender against cell death 1 (DAD1), OST48, OST4, OSTC, ribophorin I (RPN1), ribophorin II (RPN2), TUSC3, MAGT1, STT3A, and STT3B (38) (39) (40) . The STT3 protein is the central enzyme of the OST complex, and two isoforms exist in mammalian cells: STT3A and STT3B (37) . MAGT1 and TUSC3 are specific subunits of STT3B with overlapping functions. Either MAGT1 or TUSC3 is incorporated into STT3B complexes and endows STT3B with the capability to posttranslationally glycosylate cysteine-proximal acceptor sites via their oxidoreductase activity (41) . Functional studies showed that STT3A and STT3B are essential for the propagation of a recombinant arenavirus rLCMV/LASV GPC. Although most glycoproteins in host cells are efficiently modified by STT3A in a cotranslational manner (42) , our study indicated that LASV GP was preferentially modified by the STT3B-OST isoform. Our study provides new insights into the host interactome of LASV GP and extends the potential targets for the development of novel therapeutics in the future.",

To identify the host proteins interacting with LASV GP, we adopted a strategy to tag its C terminus with a Twin-Strep-tag, which is advantageous for the one-step purification of protein complexes from cell lysates (43) (44) (45) . No significant changes of the proteolytic cleavage, glycosylation, or cell surface transport were observed between the tagged and untagged LASV GPs (Fig. 1A) . Then, plasmids encoding the tagged LASV GP or vector plasmid as a control were transfected into HEK293T cells. At 48 h posttransfection, the cells were harvested, and LASV GP-associated host proteins were purified from the cell lysates by magnetic Sepharose beads coated with Strep-Tactin XT and subjected to Western blot analysis using a GP1-specific serum or anti-Strep antibody. Cleaved GP1 and GP2 were purified simultaneously from the cell lysates, together with a noncleaved form of GPC (Fig. 1B) . The retention of cleaved GP1 with purified GP2 suggests that viral GP remained in the prefusion conformation during the purification process since GP1 and GP2 interact with each other through unstable noncovalent interactions, and irreversible conformation changes during the membrane fusion process lead to their disassociation (20, 25) . Then, eluted proteins were trypsin digested and subjected to mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. Three independent replicate experiments were performed, and a total of 1,104 host proteins were identified from at least one independent replicate (see Table S1 in the supplemental material). Only proteins meeting the following criteria were considered as interactors of GP: (i) for proteins identified in only the GP group but not the control group, at least two peptides should be identified, or (ii) for proteins identified in both the GP and control groups, the GP versus control group peptide count ratios should be \u03fe3 (Fig. 1C) . With this standard, 591 proteins were considered as valid interactors of LASV GPs. \u2423-DG, the host receptor of OW arenaviruses (23) , was detected in the GP groups with high abundance but not in the control groups (Table S1) .",

Because of partly redundant functions of the two isoforms in N-linked glycosylation, most glycoproteins in host cells can be modified by both OST isoforms except for a few special proteins that are preferentially modified by either STT3A or STT3B (51).

Plasmids encoding single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeting the exons of the STT3A and STT3B genes were transfected into HEK293T cells to direct genome editing. Knockouts of STT3A and STT3B were confirmed by sequencing (Fig. 4A , frameshift mutations at the corresponding sites) and Western blot analysis (Fig. 4B ). To further confirm the loss of STT3A and STT3B catalytic activity, the N-glycosylation of two plasmids expressing progranulin (pGRN) or sex hormone- binding globulin (SHBG), which were reported to be specific N-glycosylation substrates of STT3A or STT3B, respectively, was examined (54, 55) . As shown in Fig. 4C , N-glycosylation of pGRN was inhibited in STT3Acells but not in wild-type (WT) cells or STT3Bcells, whereas knockout of STT3B inhibited the N-glycosylation of only SHBG. To explore whether STT3A and STT3B affect viral replication, we rescued a recombinant arenavirus, rLCMV/LASV GPC, in which LCMV GP was replaced by LASV GP, while the backbone of LCMV was not altered. This recombinant virus can be manipulated in BSL-2 conditions and reportedly exhibits high fitness with intact characteristics of LASV GP (56) . STT3Aand STT3Bcells were infected with rLCMV/LASV GPC and harvested at the indicated time points. The intracellular viral level was determined based on the amount of viral S genomic RNA(\u03e9), as determined by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR), and the viral titer in the supernatant was determined by an immunological plaque assay. As shown in Fig. 4D , the intracellular level of the viral S genome was only slightly reduced in STT3Aor STT3Bcells, indicating that viral genome replication was not significantly affected by the knockout of STT3A or STT3B. The titers in the supernatants of STT3Aand STT3Bcells were reduced dramatically, indicating that knockout of STT3A or STT3B impaired the propagation of rLCMV/LASV GPC. These results showed that both STT3A and STT3B are host factors on which the virus depends.",

Since both STT3A and STT3B play roles in virus propagation, we sought to investigate the glycosylation profile of viral GP in STT3Aand STT3Bcells. Cells infected with the rLCMV/LASV GPC virus were harvested at the indicated time points and subjected to Western blotting. In STT3Acells, the viral GP displayed the same glycosylation pattern as that in WT cells, but the proteolytic cleavage process was hindered in the early stage of infection (24 and 36 hpi). Even so, the viral GP in STT3Acells reached a level of maturation similar to that observed in WT cells at the late stage of infection (Fig. 6A) . Knockout of STT3A did not significantly affect the glycosylation of LASV GP, which might be explained by the functionally compensatory effect executed by the STT3B isoform of OST in STT3Acells. However, we observed an obviously hypoglycosylated form of noncleaved GPC in STT3Bcells. To exclude the possibility that the reduced molecular weight of viral GPC was caused by other modifications, such as phosphorylation, viral proteins from different cell lines were subjected to cleavage by PNGase F to remove the N-glycans. As shown in Fig. 6B , the migration of the unglycosylated form of noncleaved GPC was identical among these cells, suggesting that the differential migration of the glycosylated form of GPC in STT3Bcells was due to the distinct glycosylation status of GPC. Taken together, these data showed that LASV GP was a preferential substrate of STT3B-OST and that the full glycosylation of LASV GP requires the STT3B-OST isoform. Although STT3A was not an essential prerequisite for the glycosylation of LASV GP, loss of STT3A delayed its proteolytic cleavage.",

Despite their replaceable functions, MAGT1 mRNA was shown to be widely expressed in human tissues, whereas the expression of TUSC3 is relatively more restricted (58) . The expression of TUSC3 in several cultured cell lines was reported to be difficult to detect by Western blotting (53) . MAGT1 was found to weakly interact with LASV GP in our MS data set, while TUSC3 was not identified (Table S1 ). This result could be explained by previous reports demonstrating that MAGT1 and TUSC3 easily dissociated from the canine OST during the purification process (52) . To confirm that MAGT1 and TUSC3 were host interactors of LASV GP, a pCAGGs plasmid encoding 6\u03ebHis-tagged MAGT1 or Flag-tagged TUSC3 was cotransfected with LASV GP into HEK293T cells. Coimmunoprecipitation and Western blot analyses revealed that viral GP but not GFP was able to pull down exogenously expressed MAGT1 and TUSC3, indicating that these proteins were also host interactors of LASV GP (Fig. 3G and H) .",

            "text": "We then sought to explore the roles of MAGT1 and TUSC3 in virus propagation. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout of MAGT1 and TUSC3 cell lines were constructed (MAGT1and TUSC3cells) as described above and confirmed by sequencing (Fig. 7A) and Western blot analysis (Fig. 7C) . The expression levels of both MAGT1 and TUSC3 were also decreased in STT3Bcells, indicating that their expression relies on the existence of STT3B. Although virus titers were partly reduced in MAGT1and TUSC3cells compared to that in WT cells (Fig. 7C, right) , glycosylation of LASV GP was not significantly altered in these two cells. The inefficiency of functional knockout might be explained by the functional compensation between the two proteins. The level of TUSC3 in WT cells was almost undetectable by Western blotting, while a deficiency of MAGT1 was accompanied by obviously increased expression of TUSC3 (Fig. 7C, lanes 1  and 5) . To confirm this finding, the MAGT1 -TUSC3cell line was constructed (Fig. 7B) . Both MAGT1 -TUSC3cells and STT3Bcells were then infected with the rLCMV/LASV GPC virus, and we observed the same hypoglycosylation pattern of viral GP in the two cells compared to the glycosylation pattern in WT cells (Fig. 7C) , indicating that MAGT1 Journal of Virology or TUSC3 was required for full viral GP glycosylation. The virus titer derived from MAGT1 -TUSC3cells was also dramatically reduced compared to that derived from WT cells (Fig. 7C) . Similarly, the viral foci in MAGT1 -TUSC3cells were notably smaller than those in WT cells (Fig. 5D) , as in STT3Bcells. Full glycosylation of LASV GP requires the CXXC active-site motifs of MAGT1 and TUSC3. MAGT1 and TUSC3 are thioredoxin homologs, and a luminally oriented CXXC active-site motif is responsible for their oxidoreductase activity (59) . A protein tertiary structure stabilized by disulfide bonds is a negative regulatory factor for their posttranslational glycosylation (60) . MAGT1 and TUSC3 delay the folding of nascent polypeptides by forming mixed disulfide bonds with cysteine-proximal glycosylation sequons via their CXXC site motifs and thereby facilitate access to STT3B (41) . Mutation of the active site cysteines of MAGT1 or TUSC3 resulted in the hypoglycosylation of a subset of STT3B-dependent substrates (41) . To test whether the glycosylation of LASV GP requires the oxidoreductase activity of MAGT1 and TUSC3, plasmids encoding MAGT1/TUSC3 or MAGT1/TUSC3 with SXXC, CXXS, or SXXS mutations were transfected into MAGT1 -TUSC3cells to restore the glycosylation of LASV GP. As shown in Fig. 8 , the expression of WT MAGT1 or WT TUSC3 was able to restore the glycosylation of LASV GPC (lanes 1, 5, and 6), whereas MAGT1 and TUSC3 with mutations of any cysteine in their CXXC site motifs failed to restore glycosylation and virus replication (lanes 2, 3, and 4). Our results revealed that the oxidoreductase CXXC active-site motifs of MAGT1 and TUSC3 play roles in the full glycosylation of LASV GP.",

They facilitate viral entry via binding to the virus receptor at the extracellular membrane or promoting membrane fusion in the endosome and participate in virus budding via interacting with the virus matrix protein Z to be incorporated into the envelope of nascent virions. Arenavirus GP is first translated into the ER lumen as a GPC precursor, which is mediated by SSP, and then undergoes a series of folding and modification processes along the secretory pathway to achieve a mature and functional conformation. Among these processes, N-glycosylation in the ER lumen is the most dominant modification of LASV GP. We systematically identified the host interactors of LASV GP using the AP-MS approach. This methodology enables us to gain detailed insights into the host machinery involved in stages of LASV GP synthesis, processing, and transport through the secretory pathway. Proteomic analysis identified multiple proteins of the OST complex as interactors of LASV GP. This was consistent with a previous interactome of LCMV GP (Table  S1 ), although their roles were not examined (49) . The congruence between the interactomes of LASV and LCMV GPs highlights the reliability of these observations and prompted us to investigate the conserved roles of the OST complex in arenaviruses.",

Thus, pharmacological inhibition of the host OST complex by NGI-1 may provide a useful treatment option to efficiently inhibit virus spread and reduce the fatality rate caused by Lassa fever in the future. The relative importance of the STT3B isoform of OST in LASV infection may be related to the distinct enzymatic mechanisms of the two isoforms. In mammalian cells, the OST complex is a hetero-oligomeric complex consisting of a catalytically active subunit with several noncatalytic auxiliary subunits (39) . The additional components either play a structural role to support the structural stability and enzymatic activity of the OST complex or modulate the N-glycosylation efficiency for certain precursors (65, 66) . STT3A and STT3B arose from the same ancestral STT3 gene during the evolution of multicellular eukaryotes and share a 59% amino acid sequence identity (39) . Both STT3A and STT3B are widely expressed in human tissues, and the full glycosylation of polypeptides involves the cooperation of the two isoforms. The STT3A-OST isoform is primarily responsible for the cotranslational modification of sequons as nascent polypeptide chains enter the lumen of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) through direct interaction with the Sec61 translocon complex (51, 67, 68) . Most acceptor sites in host glycoproteins are modified by the cotranslational pathway, and depletion of STT3A by siRNA upregulates the level of the luminal ER chaperone BiP and induces the unfolded protein response in response to the hypoglycosylation of host proteins. Unlike STT3A-OST, the STT3B-OST isoform is less competent for the cotranslational modification and efficiently mediates posttranslational modification of glycosylation sites that are skipped by STT3A after nascent polypeptides enter the ER lumen (51) .",

These results suggested the existence of glycosylation sites in viral GPC that are prone to being skipped by STT3A-OST and designated to be posttranslationally modified by STT3B-OST. MAGT1 and TUSC3 are specific subunits of STT3B-OST that have overlapping functions. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout of either MAGTI or TUSC3 did not reduce the glycosylation of LASV GP, whereas knockout of both led to the same hypoglycosylation pattern as that observed in STT3Bcells, indicating that MAGT1 and TUSC3 exhibit compensatory functions for the glycosylation of LASV GP (Fig. 7B) . Site-directed mutagenesis further revealed that the oxidoreductase CXXC active site motif of MAGT1 or TUSC3 was essential for the glycosylation of LASV GP (Fig. 8) .

Although STT3A and STT3B show tissue-specific expression, this phenomenon likely does not link the preferential requirement for the STT3B-OST isoform with the tissue tropism of virus infection in vivo, since STT3A was also here demonstrated to be a host prerequisite for virus propagation by indirectly influencing the infectivity of progeny viruses.",

The fully assembled OS-PP-Dol is Glc 3 Man 9 GlcNAc 2 -PP-Dol, which is assembled on the cytoplasmic face of the RER by glycosyltransferases that mediate the transfer of single glycosyl residues onto the dolichol phosphate step by step (70) . Assembly intermediates of OS-PP-Dol with different lengths (Glc 0 -2 Man 0 -9 GlcNAc 2 -PP-Dol) can also serve as the donor substrate for the OST complex in vivo and in vitro (71, 72) . It was reported that STT3A and STT3B assembled into different OST complexes with a distinct discrimination ability to select Glc 3 Man 9 GlcNAc 2 -PP-Dol over its assembly intermediate Man 9 GlcNAc 2 -PP-Dol, which lacks the terminal glucose residue as the oligosaccharide donor substrate for N-glycosylation (52) . The STT3B-OST complex is substantially more active and shows a reduced ability to discriminate different oligosaccharide structures; in contract, the STT3A-OST complex is extremely selective and preferentially glycosylates nascent proteins with the fully assembled Glc 3 Man 9 GlcNAc 2 -PP-Dol (52) . It is interesting to associate this distinct substrate-selective characteristic of STT3A and STT3B with the recently reported glycan heterogeneity of LASV GP. Analysis of the LASV glycome composition by hydrophilic interaction chromatography ultraperformance liquid chromatography revealed that the virus possesses an abundance of underprocessed oligomannose-type glycans, which form punctuated clusters to shield the proteinous surface from the humoral immune response (73) . It remains unknown whether the site-specific heterogeneity of virion surface glycans has any relevance to the preferential utilization of host OST isoforms by viruses during the glycosylation process. Further studies are needed to deeply elucidate the physiological significance of this host glycosylation strategy utilized by arenaviruses. and HIV-1 GP160 (isolate NL43clone, GenBank AY669735.1) were gifts from Chen JianJun and Peng Ke, respectively, in our institute.

Recombinant LCMV (ARM strain) expressing LASV and MACV GPs (rLCMV/LASV GPC and rLCMV/MACV GPC viruses) were generated by reverse genetic techniques, as previously reported (76, 77) . Briefly, we constructed plasmids containing full-length antigenomic cDNA of the LCMV (ARM strain) L and S segments (or an S segment in which NP was linked with GFP via a P2A self-cleaving peptide sequence) flanked by a T7 promoter in their 5= termini and a hepatitis delta riboenzyme sequence in their 3= termini, respectively. Then, LCMV GP was replaced by LASV GP (Josiah strain) or MACV GP (Carvallo strain) using PCR and an In-Fusion HD cloning kit (TaKaRa). The two plasmids were cotransfected into T7 RNA polymerase stably expressing cells (BSR-T7) to direct the intracellular synthesis of viral L and S RNA antigenomes and the initial translation of NP and LP. Four days after transfection, the initially rescued viruses were transferred into BHK-21 cells for further amplification.",

Predesigned sequences with the fewest predicted off-target cleavage sites were selected. For STT3A and STT3B, two target sequences were selected for each gene (STT3A-target-1, TATATCTCCCGATCTGTGGC; STT3A-target-2, ACAGACATTCCGAA TGTCGA; STT3B-target-1, GACGACTTGTGCTTGCTCTC; STT3B-target-2, CGTGGATGATGCTTTCGAAG). For MAGT1 and TUSC3, one target sequence was selected (MAGT1-target-1, ATAACGGAGTAATTTCTCGG; TUSC3-target-1, CGCTCAATCTTCCGAATGAA). A pair of partially cDNA oligonucleotides encoding each sgRNA sequence was synthesized and ligated into a pSpCas9(BB)-2A-Puro plasmid (PX459; Addgene, catalog no. 62988), which bears both the Cas9 gene, and the sgRNA scaffold backbone containing an oligonucleotide cloning site. Construction of the plasmids was performed according to a standard target sequence cloning protocol involving an annealing step and a ligation reaction (75) . Briefly, the DNA oligonucleotide pairs encoding the 20-nucleotide sgRNA were 5= phosphorylated by T4 polynucleotide kinase (NEB) and annealed in a thermocycler with the following parameters: 37\u00b0C for 30 min, 95\u00b0C for 5 min, and cooling to 25\u00b0C at 5\u00b0C min \u03ea1 . The DNA oligonucleotides were then ligated into the linearized pSpCas9(BB)-2A-Puro vector using Quick ligase (NEB) at room temperature for 10 min. Finally, the ligated plasmids were transformed into a competent E. coli strain, plated on an LB plate containing 100 g/ml ampicillin, and incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C. The colonies were checked by Sanger sequencing for correct sgRNA insertion. Plasmids encoding Cas9 and each sgRNA were isolated and transfected into HEK293T cells using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen) to direct genome editing. The trans-fected cells were selected by incubating with 2 g/ml puromycin for 72 h, and then isogenic cell lines were isolated by serial dilutions and allowed to expand for 2 to 3 weeks. Genomic DNA from the isogenic cell lines was extracted by using a TIANamp genomic DNA kit (DP304; Tiangen Biotech). PCR amplification of the modified regions was defined by Sanger sequencing using specific genomic cleavage detection primers, and cell lines exhibiting frameshift mutations at the corresponding sites were selected and further confirmed by Western blotting. MAGT1 and TUSC3 double-knockout cells (MAGT1 -TUSC3 -) were constructed by transfecting the TUSC3-sgRNA plasmid into MAGT1cells to direct a second editing event. Isogenic cell lines bearing the desired editing outcomes were sequenced and selected in the same way.",
