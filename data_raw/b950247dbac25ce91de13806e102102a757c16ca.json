We found that tylophorine-based compounds target the TGEV viral RNA and effectively inhibit TGEV replication. NF-\u03baB inhibition also leads to anti-TGEV replication. NF-\u03baB activation induced by TGEV infection was found to be associated with two convergent pathways, IKK-2_I\u03baB\u03b1/p65 and JAK2 mediated p65 phosphorylation, in swine testicular cells. JAK2 inhibition either by CYT387 (a JAK family inhibitor) or by silencing JAK2-expression revealed a dominant JAK2 mediated p65 phosphorylation pathway for NF-\u03baB activation and resulted in NF-\u03baB inhibition, which overrode the I\u03baB\u03b1 regulation via the IKK-2. Finally, tylophorine-based compounds work cooperatively with CYT387 to impart comprehensive anti-TGEV activities. The combination treatment, wherein a tylophorine compound targets TGEV and a JAK2 inhibitor blocks the alternative dominant NF-\u03baB activation mediated by JAK2, is more effective and comprehensive than either one alone and constitutes a feasible approach for the treatment of SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.",

Nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) activation by coronaviruses is usually responsible for mediating the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and thus plays an important role in the pathogenesis of disease caused by coronaviruses 6, 7 . Inhibition of NF-\u03baB-mediated inflammation induced by coronavirus in mice was reported to increase the survival rate 6 . Thus, NF-\u03baB inhibitors constitute a promising class of antivirals in infections caused by pathogenic coronaviruses. However, targeting NF-\u03baB is limited by intrinsic pathway complexity, cross talk with other pathways, and drug resistance 8 . In addition, many small chemical molecules targeting either viral entry or the intracellular viral life cycle were reported to impart anti-coronavirus activity 2, 9, 10 . Despite these advances, however, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV remain untreatable diseases for which novel therapies are sought.",

Tylophorine compounds exert potent anti-coronavirus activities 11, 12 , but the mechanism of action remains unknown. Previously, we reported that tylophorine-based compounds exert anti-cancer activity predominantly by targeting the RNP complex containing caprin-1 protein/c-Myc mRNA in carcinoma cells 18 . Accordingly, we investigated whether the observed anti-TGEV activity arises from the targeting of viral RNP. First, we demonstrated that biotinylated tylophorine, not Biotin-X-SSE (see Fig. 1A -a for chemical structures), interacted with purified TGEV viral RNAs in a pull-down experiment using streptavidin beads (see materials and methods) ( Fig. 1A-b ). This interaction of biotinylated tylophorine and TGEV viral RNA was enhanced by addition of recombinant TGEV N protein, but not RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), in a dose dependent manner (Fig. 1A-c) . Moreover, a cellular colocalization of TGEV viral nascent RNA, N protein and fluorescent tylophorine compound surrounding the nuclei in TGEV infected cells was also observed (Figs S1 and S2). Secondly, through RT-qPCR, we also demonstrated tylophorine based compounds (Fig. 1B) profoundly inhibited TGEV viral replication by diminishing viral RNA copies by up to ~4 orders of magnitude (Fig. 1C) . Thirdly, using 5-ethynyl uridine (EU) labelled newly synthesized RNA, we clearly demonstrated that tylophorine compounds, either tylophorine or DBQ 33b, inhibited the nascent viral RNA synthesis and thus blocked the colocalization of viral nascent RNA with either N protein ( Fig. 1D-a) or RdRP ( Fig. 1D-b) around nuclei.",

IMD-0354, an IKK-2/NF-\u03baB inhibitor, was applied to diminish the phosphorylation on I\u03baB\u03b1 and p65. IMD-0354 profoundly inhibited I\u03baB\u03b1 phosphorylation ( Fig. 2B-a) and decreased the amounts of phosphorylated p65 translocated into nuclei (Figs 2C and S3), thereby conceivably inhibiting NF-\u03baB activation. However, a significant amount of phosphorylated p65 persisted in TGEV infected ST cells in the treatment with IMD-0354 ( Fig. 2B-a) . Therefore, it was reasoned that other pathway(s) exists for NF-\u03baB activation in the TGEV infected ST cells, which are capable of mediating p65 phosphorylation even when the IKK-2_I\u03baB\u03b1_p65 axis is inhibited by IMD-0354.",

Since tylophorine, IMD-0354, and CYT387 (a JAK family inhibitor) exhibited differential effects on the regulation of I\u03baB\u03b1 and p65 in TGEV infected ST cells, drug combination experiments were performed to investigate their combined effects on anti-TGEV replication using the IFA assays described in Materials and Methods. IMD-0354 was able to exert anti-TGEV activities with an EC 50 (50% maximal effective concentration) of 1.8 \u00b1 0.1 \u00b5M. The combination index values for ED 50 (50% maximal effective dose) of tylophorine and IMD-0354 were calculated using Calcusyn software and all were in the range of ~1.3 to ~1.7. Thus, tylophorine and IMD-0354 both inhibited TGEV activity, but in an antagonistic manner ( Fig. 3A-a) . In contrast, CYT387 was able to exert anti-TGEV activity with an EC 50 of 30.4 \u00b1 1.2 \u00b5M; CYT387 and tylophorine worked additively in anti-TGEV activity with the combination index values at ~0.8-0.9 for ED 50 (Fig. 3A-b) . Lastly, CYT387 treatment was able to enhance the anti-TGEV activity of tylophorine or DBQ 33b in a dose dependent manner as determined by N protein expression (Fig. 3B) , consistent with the additive effect of the combined treatment, CYT387 and tylophorine, for anti-TGEV activity ( Fig. 3A-b) . 18 . (b) Biotinylated tylophorine interacted with TGEV viral RNA. (c) TGEV N protein enhanced the association of biotinylated tylophorine with TGEV viral RNA. The total RNAs (5 \u00b5g) extracted from TGEV infected ST cells at 6 h.p.i. were subjected to pull-down experiments with 30 \u00b5M of biotinylated tylophorine or Biotin-X-SSE at 4 \u00b0C for 4 h in the absence or presence of recombinant N protein or His-RdRP with the indicated amount. The pulled down complexes were subjected for analysis by RT-PCR with TGEV specific primers, designed from the regions of TGEV N or 3CL pro gene body. 18/28S ribosomal RNAs were used as the input controls for pull-down assays. Biotinylated tylophorine and Biotin-X-SSE were respectively labeled as Bio-Ty and Bio-X. (B) Chemical structures of tylophorine and DBQ 33b. (C) Tylophorine compounds inhibited TGEV replication. TGEV infected ST cells at an MOI of 7, treated with the indicated doses of compounds at 6 h.p.i. were harvested and subjected for total RNA extraction and the determination of the viral copy numbers (see Materials and Methods). Shown are means \u00b1 S.D. from three independent experiments each in triplicates. (**p < 0.01 & ***p < 0.001; versus no compound treatment). (D) Tylophorine compounds inhibited TGEV nascent viral RNA replication and N and RdRP protein expression. TGEV infection, compound treatments and EU addition for labeling nascent RNA were performed in the sequence in the upper scheme as the shown black arrow line. The green arrow line represented the period of N (a) or RdRP (b) protein expression since TGEV infection and the red one for the nascent RNA synthesis since EU addition. Actinomycin D (Act. D) was added at 2 h.p.i. to inhibit DNA-dependent RNA polymerase. For immunofluorescent staining, following fixation, the cells were detected for the incorporated alkyne-modified EU with azide-derivatized Alexa 594 fluorophores by using click chemistry for nascent viral RNA (red), immuno-stained with FITC-mouse IgG for anti-TGEV N (a) or RdRP (b) protein (green) and stained with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (blue) for visualizing nuclei. The fluorescence image was acquired by using a Leica TSC SP5 laser-scanning confocal microscope. Bar: 25 \u03bcm. Combined treatments of tylophorine-based compounds with CYT387 cooperatively resulted in a comprehensive and ultimate reduction in TGEV titers. After infection in ST cells, TGEV exhibited a log phase increase in viral yields within the first ~12 h and reached a plateau from 15 to 24 h.p.i. with titers of ~10 9 PFU (plague forming unit)/ml (Fig. 4A) . Treatments with tylophorine, DBQ 33b, IMD-0354, or CYT387 all significantly blocked viral replication and diminished the viral yields in TGEV infected ST cells in a dose dependant manner (Fig. 4B ). Treatment with either tylophorine or DBQ 33b completely blocked viral replication and reduced viral titers at the concentration of 300 nM or 100 nM respectively, resulting in a reduction of viral yield by 9 orders of magnitude. IMD-0354 decreased the viral yield from 10 8.8 to 10 1.6 PFU/ml, 7.2 orders of magnitude, at the concentration of 10 \u00b5M. CYT387, though limited by its poor solubility and moderate cytotoxicity (Fig. S4 ), achieved a 3.8 order of magnitude decrease in viral yield (10 8.5 to 10 4.7 PFU/ml) at a concentration of 500 \u00b5M. Both arms of inhibition, either through targeting TGEV viral complex or cellular NF-\u03baB activation, were able to profoundly reduce viral replication.",

To elucidate how I\u03baB\u03b1 protein expression was eliminated by tylophorine (Fig. 2B) , we first examined whether tylophorine downregulates the transcription of I\u03baB\u03b1 and thus inhibits I\u03baB\u03b1 protein expression by RT-PCR for detecting the amounts of I\u03baB\u03b1 mRNA in TGEV infected cells treated with tylophorine or IMD-0354. I\u03baB\u03b1 mRNA was significantly induced upon TGEV infection in ST cells. However, tylophorine did not decrease the TGEV induced I\u03baB\u03b1 mRNA levels as manifested at 0.5, 1, and 6 h.p.i. (Fig. 5A) . Thus tylophorine did not diminish I\u03baB\u03b1 protein level by transcriptional downregulation. Secondly, we examined whether proteasomal degradation was involved. Tylophorine disabled the induction of I\u03baB\u03b1 and its phosphorylated form at 1 h.p.i by TGEV. MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, was able to significantly increase the level of the phosphorylated I\u03baB\u03b1 upon TGEV infection. However, MG132, when co-administered with tylophorine, was not able to recover I\u03baB\u03b1 protein level (after its elimination by tylophorine), whereas the level of phosphorylated I\u03baB\u03b1 form was recovered to the level induced by TGEV. This is attributed to the fact that phosphorylated I\u03baB\u03b1 is the very form subjected to proteasome for degradation and MG132 functions to block this process (Fig. 5B) . Thus, tylophorine did not undergo blocking proteasomal degradation to reduce I\u03baB\u03b1 protein level. Thirdly, we examined whether tylophorine blocked de novo protein synthesis of I\u03baB\u03b1 protein using a Click-iT \u00ae HPG and TAMRA labelling/detecting method to trace the newly synthesized protein 18, 20 . As shown in Fig. 5C , the amount of newly synthesized I\u03baB\u03b1 significantly increased with time after TGEV infection. Treatment with tylophorine completely eliminated the de novo synthesis of I\u03baB\u03b1 (Fig. 5C ).",

Tylophorine reduced the I\u03baB\u03b1 protein level, and consequently p65 sequestered by I\u03baB\u03b1 was liberated and subjected to phosphorylation and NF-\u03baB activation in TGEV infected ST cells.

The results showed that: (1) the p65 phosphorylation was dramatically diminished in the JAK2-knockdown ST cells; and (2) in the presence of tylophorine treatment, p65 phosphorylation was significantly decreased in JAK2 knockdown cells compared to that with control shRNA.

Tylophorine compounds exert potent, orally active, broad spectrum, anti-coronaviral activity with EC 50 values in the low nM ranges for SARS-CoV, MHV, and TGEV 11, 12 . Herein, TGEV was used as a surrogate system for coronavirus to dissect the underlying mechanism of action for anticoronaviral tylophorine compounds. In TGEV infected ST cells, tylophorine compounds target N protein associated viral replication complex (Fig. 1) and CYT387 blocks JAK2 mediated NF-\u03baB activation (Figs 2 and 6) , respectively. We found that the combination of tylophorine with CYT387 was a good strategy for the elimination of TGEV in ST cells and this combination strategy opens a promising future avenue for research into treatments for SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.",

            "text": "Moreover, TGEV N protein was reported to bind the viral genomic and subgenomic TRS and facilitate viral transcription and replication 23, 24 . The degree of RNA occupancy by chaperone proteins (e.g. N protein) delicately regulates the biological properties and functions of the RNA. The structural switch of a nucleoprotein complex from a crowded state to an overcrowded one (e.g overloaded N protein) will result in the loss of RNA function (e.g. freeze the viral transcription/replication) 25, 26 . Tylophorine binding may increase the N protein loading to or also prevent the release of N protein from the replication RNP complex. Therefore, it is suggested that tylophorine Multiple signalling pathways or networks might cooperate or orchestrate NF-\u03baB activation in a biological system 27 . Antiviral agents may have differential pharmacological effects in NF-\u03baB activation. Therefore, the combined treatment of antiviral agents with NF-\u03baB inhibitors should avoid antagonistic effects. Interestingly, in TGEV infected ST cells, IMD-0354 significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of I\u03baB\u03b1 but not that of p65 (Fig. 2B) , indicating other existing pathway(s) that alternatively mediate p65 phosphorylation independent of IKK-2 mediated pathway. Obviously, there are at least two key pathways associated with NF-\u03baB activation in the TGEV infected ST cells: one through IKK-2_I\u03baB\u03b1_p65 phosphorylation; and the other mediated by JAK2_p65 phosphorylation (Figs 2, 3 and 5) .",

Nonetheless, blocking the JAK2 mediated p65 phosphorylation/NF-\u03baB activation pathway efficiently diminished the p65 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation by CYT387 treatment in tylophorine co-treated, TGEV infected ST cells (Fig. 2) . JAK2 knockdown by gene silencing further bolstered the dominant role of JAK2 in p65 phosphorylation/NF-\u03baB activation in TGEV infected ST cells. Phosphorylation of p65 was dramatically decreased in TGEV infected JAK2 deficient cells compared to that in shRNA control cells with or without tylophorine treatment (Fig. 6B) . Collectively, tylophorine antagonized inhibition of IKK-2_I\u03baB\u03b1/p65 axis by IMD-0354 but worked in an additive manner with inhibition of JAK pathway mediated p65 phosphorylation by CYT387 for the TGEV inhibition. Other JAK inhibitors that confer JAK2 inhibition in TGEV infected cells also have the potential to work with tylophorine compounds to block JAK2 mediated p65 phosphorylation for further applications (Fig. S6) .",

The primer pairs used for RT-qPCR were: 5\u2032-CCAAGGATGGTGCCATGAAC-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GGACTGTTGCCTGCCTCTAGA-3\u2032 for N protein; 5\u2032-ATGAAGGATGTCCTGGCAGTGT-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-ACCACCGTACATTTCTCCTTCAAA-3\u2032 for 3CL pro ; 5\u2032-CACCAACTACAATGGCCACACA-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-TAGCCCTGGTAGGTGACTCTGTT-3\u2032 for I\u03baB\u03b1; and 5\u2032-GGCTCAGAGCAAGAGAGGTATCC-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GGTCTCAAACATGATCTGAGTCATCT-3\u2032 for \u03b2-actin; and 5\u2032-CCCGTCGGCATGTATTAGCT-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-TGTCCCACCGTCTCCTACCT-3\u2032 for 18S ribosomal RNA.",

(b) Tylophorine and JAK inhibitor CYT387 inhibited TGEV activity by an additive manner.

Drug combination tests were monitored by IFA as described in Materials and Methods. TGEV infected ST cells showed a poor adherence property in the presence of CYT387 in 96-well culture plates but exhibited a much better adherence property in 24-well culture plates. Therefore, the combination tests for tylophorine and IMD-0354 were performed in 96-well culture plates and for tylophorine and CYT387 in 24-well culture plates.
