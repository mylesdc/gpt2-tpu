            "text": "It is well recognised that animal and plant pathogens form complex ecological communities of interacting organisms within their hosts, and there is growing interest in the health implications of such pathogen interactions. Although community ecology approaches have been used to identify pathogen interactions at the within-host scale, methodologies enabling robust identification of interactions from population-scale data such as that available from health authorities are lacking. To address this gap, we developed a statistical framework that jointly identifies interactions between multiple viruses from contemporaneous non-stationary infection time series. Our conceptual approach is derived from a Bayesian multivariate disease mapping framework. Importantly, our approach captures within-and betweenyear dependencies in infection risk while controlling for confounding factors such as seasonality, demographics and infection frequencies, allowing genuine pathogen interactions to be distinguished from simple correlations. We validated our framework using a broad range of synthetic data. We then applied it to diagnostic data available for five respiratory viruses cocirculating in a major urban population between 2005 and 2013: adenovirus, human coronavirus, human metapneumovirus, influenza B virus and respiratory syncytial virus. We found positive and negative covariances indicative of epidemiological interactions among specific virus pairs. This statistical framework enables a community ecology perspective to be applied to infectious disease epidemiology with important utility for public health planning and preparedness.",

These microorganisms can coexist harmoniously or even beneficially, or they may competitively interact for host resources. Well-studied examples include interactions between viruses and bacteria in the respiratory tract. Whilst ecological studies have revealed that some pathogens do interact within their hosts, identifying interactions from available population scale data from health authorities is challenging. This is exacerbated by a lack of large-scale data describing the infection patterns of multiple pathogens within single populations over long time frames. Furthermore, methods for evaluating whether infection frequencies of different pathogens fluctuate together or not over time cannot readily account for alternative explanations. For example, human pathogens may have related seasonal patterns depending on the age groups they infect and the weather conditions they survive in, and not because they are interacting. We developed a robust statistical framework to identify pathogen-pathogen interactions from population scale diagnostic data. This framework serves as a crucial step in identifying such important interactions and will guide new studies to elucidate their underpinning mechanisms. This will have important consequences for public health preparedness and the design of effective disease control interventions. This is a PLOS Computational Biology Methods paper.",

When multiple pathogens infect the same tissue, they form diverse communities, effectively sharing an ecological niche that provides the opportunity for interspecific interactions [1] [2] [3] . It is known that pathogen interactions may alter the within-host dynamics of infection with consequences for the population transmission of some common infections. Interactions among microorganisms include the promoting or inhibiting effects of gut microbiota on invading pathogenic bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract [4] ; the enhanced carriage of pneumococcal bacteria following influenza infection in the respiratory tract [5] ; the rise in human monkeypox after eradication of smallpox [6] ; and immune-driven enhancement of Zika virus infection following Dengue virus exposure [7] . The complex ecology of pathogen communities therefore has potentially important implications for the epidemiology and control of infectious diseases.",

            "text": "Pathogens that act non-independently and their health implications is an actively growing and important area of research [8] . Pathogen interactions can be cooperative or competitive and can occur within a host or in a population where pathogens co-circulate [9] . While some evidence of population-level interactions between pathogens exists, statistical support for the occurrence of pathogen-pathogen interactions from multiple non-stationary time series independent of prior biological or ecological knowledge is lacking. This is due in part to a paucity of appropriate long-term time series data that describe infection frequencies for multiple pathogens simultaneously, allowing such interactions to be identified, but also due to statistical techniques that are limited in their ability to handle such complex datasets [10, 11] . Various statistical methods are available to analyse health-related time series data. Statistical methods for handling non-stationary time series data include multiple regression and generalised additive models, which are able to capture non-linear trends and explanatory factors such as seasonality and climate as well as other confounders and typically model a univariate health outcome as opposed to a multivariate distribution of several non-independent outcomes [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . Consequently, they do not necessarily focus on estimating pathogen-pathogen interactions. More specialist techniques that focus on decomposition of the time series include singular spectrum analysis and wavelet analysis. Singular spectrum analysis has been used to model interactions between a pathogen and an environmental factor [19] , whilst wavelet decomposition has been used to infer pathogen-pathogen interactions [20] and virus-virus interactions [21] . These techniques only capture pairwise relationships between time series (for example pathogen-pathogen or pathogen-environment) although in principal singular spectrum analysis can be extended to multiple time series [22] . Moreover these methods do not account for or adjust the data for potential confounders. Another recent approach is to use mechanistic stochastic models to estimate time varying parameters (e.g. a transmission rate) and then employ wavelet analysis to compare with potential weather or climatic drivers [11] , but again in a pairwise manner.",

Fitting epidemiological models which contain interactions to the data is also possible, but becomes very complex when multiple pathogens are present.

The framework accounts for non-stationarity, confounding variables such as seasonality and patient demographics and requires no prior knowledge or specification of the underlying biological or ecological mechanisms.",

Because multivariate disease mapping naturally incorporates a betweendisease covariance matrix, these methods conveniently lend themselves to the inference of temporal signatures of pathogen-pathogen interactions when adapted to analyse temporal dependencies.

We began by simulating individual level data reflecting the virological diagnostic data. For each sample, an age, sex and severity were drawn from the observed virological diagnostic data distributions [38] . Regression coefficients used to estimate the probability of each virus were drawn such that \u03b2 intercept = 0, \u03b2 age * N(0, 0.1), \u03b2 gender * N(0, 0.1) and \u03b2 severity * N(0, 0.1).",

We choose this package due to its flexibility in simulating seasonal non-stationary time series data.

In addition seasonal components were included through seasonal differencing (D), autoregression (P) and a moving average model (Q) over period m therefore simulating from a SARIMA(p, d, q)(P, D, Q) 12 with period 12 since we are dealing with monthly data. Within each simulation, we used differencing d = 1 with a second or first order autoregression and moving average p, q 2 {1, 2}. Likewise, we used either no or a seasonal differencing D 2 {0, 1} and no or a first order autoregression and moving average p, q 2 {0, 1}. These parameter settings allowed for a wide range of seasonal and non-stationary time series data. Fig 2 provides examples of simulated time series data under these parameter settings.",
