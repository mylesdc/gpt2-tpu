By contrast, in traditional taxonomy, specimens are usually identified by 'dichotomous keys' that use combinations of characters shared by different members of the target set. Using one specific character for each target is the least efficient strategy for identification.

            "text": "In contemporary biological research, organisms are often identified by firstly sequencing one or more of their genes and then comparing the sequences with those of known species, either by inferring phylogenies or by database searches [1] . Once a sequence is available it may be used to design oligonucleotide probes, and these are used for most routine DNA diagnostic work, because probe hybridisation tests are far less expensive and less technically complex than sequence analysis. Specific oligonucleotide probes are used that are complementary in sequence to, and hence hybridise with, selected regions of the DNA, RNA or cDNA of the target species or genotype. Most such routine tests aim to identify specimens of a single species, or only a very few. Each probe is at least 18 nucleotides long and often twice as long, and is chosen so that it is unique and only hybridises with a single target. As a result, at least one specific probe is required for every target, although usually several different probes are used for each. In some tests, sets of species-or genotype-specific probes are deposited as arrays on solid supports, so that it is possible to check simultaneously if an unknown organism belongs to one or other of many different taxa or genotypes; this strategy is widely used for gene expression analysis. 'High density arrays' of such probes have been used on occasion for identifying pathogens [2] , but they are not used routinely because, like sequence analysis, they are costly and technically complex [3] , nonetheless the potential market for identifying pathogens in this way is very large (see Discussion).",

In practice the characters are used to devise a series of presence/absence questions arranged as a 'dichotomous taxonomic key', so that answering these questions sequentially leads to the identification of a specimen. The main advantage of this strategy is that far fewer characters and questions are required to uniquely identify an individual target. The strategy is most efficient when each character bisects the targets into two equal groups, i.e. it is bisectionally distributed, and when different characters bisect the targets differently, ideally in a progressively binary way. In theory the minimum number of characters required to distinguish a finite number of targets by this method is defined by the binary logarithm X = log 2 Y, where X is the number of characters and Y is the number of targets. For example, ten ideal characters would, in theory, identify each of a set of 1024 targets, and only 20 ideal characters could identify more than a million targets; 1013 and 1,048,555 fewer tests respectively than using target-specific characters.",

A suitable set of such 'combinatorial probes' could be used to uniquely identify different individual DNAs as these would give different patterns of hybridisation, 'fingerprints', with different individual DNAs Sub-sequences that are suitable targets for probe combinations are most commonly 6-30 nts long. Sub-sequences of such lengths are not unique to the set of target genes, and so the target genes must first be separated from other 'contaminating' DNAs. Various physical or chemical techniques could be used to isolate the target sequences, but perhaps the most convenient would be by PCR using target region-specific primer mixtures (i.e. 'redundant' primers).",

These studies focussed on the algorithmics of probe selection and demonstrated that sets of sub-sequences 5-8 nts long could distinguish individual sequences. Probes that are only 5 to 8 nts long are not widely used because they usually require unusual hybridisation conditions. In the work reported here we looked at a range of sub-sequence lengths and used a simple greedy algorithm, where sub-sequences were successively chosen that merely maximised the number of pairs of gene-sequences that were distinguished; the algorithm was based on suffix arrays because they use less computer memory than suffix trees to manipulate as large sets. Our study focussed on understanding the effect of genesequence diversity on the number and diversity of subsequences of different lengths that might be targeted by probes, as these factors will affect their use in practical applications. Here we report a study of three published sets of cytochrome oxidase c subunit 1 (CO-1) genes from representative groups of animal species [7, 8] . These data were chosen because each set is consistent in length and composition, but differs greatly from the others in phylogenetic range and diversity. We have also studied, in less detail, several sets of sequences of plant and animal viruses and the ribosomal genes of bacteria.",

In theory, 7 DSSs behaving in a perfectly dichotomous way would be required to distinguish all the sequences in the CO1animal and CO1-insect data, and the CO1-moth data should require 8 DSSs. Thus, the MC-sets of the shortest DSSs were close to the theoretically predicted size. However, as DSS length and sequence diversity increased, so too did the sizes of the MC-sets. The increase was smoothly curvilinear with the random data, but more variable with real sequences. The more diverse sequences usually required larger MC-sets, although the greater size of the CO1-moth dataset also increased the MC-set size.",

This is because each MC-set that we have found is many-fold redundant, and has the potential to generate many more different signatures than would be generated from the known test-sequences. For example, the MC-sets 18 nucleotides long that distinguished the 201 CO1-moth sequences were of 16 DSSs. Sixteen DSSs could, if they behaved in a perfectly dichotomous way, uniquely identify 65,536 different gene sequences or species (i.e. 2 16 ).

We have also examined, but in less detail, a set of ribosomal RNA genes from 17 bacterial species representing 12 genera and also gene sequences from several groups of animal and plant viruses, namely flaviviruses, orthomyxoviruses, potyviruses and tobamoviruses (unpublished results). The results obtained with the bacterial and viral sequences did not differ in any significant way from those obtained with CO1 sequences, which suggests that there is no a priori reason to believe that DSSs for targeting by probe combinations are not present in all genes.",

First, known sequences of potential targets would be examined to find regions of convenient length and varia-bility bracketed by conserved sites for PCR primers. The region-specific primers would be tested and optimised using a range of variant sequences. Then all known sequences of the region would be used to identify MC-sets of DSSs, whose complements could be used as probes in hybridisation-based tests to identify individual variants. However an iterative process will be required to design a working set of combinatorial probes as it is well known that a significant proportion of sub-sequences selected as hybridisation probes fail to behave as expected because of secondary structures in the target nucleic acid or the probe [12] . First an initial MC-set would be selected bioinformatically, then tested biochemically, and the probes that performed correctly used as a 'starter set' for further rounds of bioinformatic and biochemical selection, until a working MC-set was obtained. When this DSS set is used in practice, variant sequences giving unknown DSS signatures are likely to be found. These would then be sequenced and added to the trainer set, and the MC-set might have to be redesigned.",

First, an array was constructed that recorded the DSSs in each test-sequence. A \"distinguishing array\" was then constructed that recorded for every pair of testsequences, the DSSs that distinguished the pair. A \"distinguishing-score\" was then calculated for each DSS by summing the number of pairs of test-sequences that it dis-tinguished. The DSS with the largest distinguishing-score was chosen. This DSS and the pairs that it distinguished were then eliminated from the distinguishing array. The process of DSS selection was then repeated either until a set of DSSs had been found that, in combination, distinguished all the test-sequences, or until no DSS could be found that would distinguish the remaining testsequences. The set of DSSs that could distinguish all the test-sequences, was considered a \"complete set\". The ability of a complete set to distinguish the test-sequences in a dataset was independently confirmed by using a separate program to search the test-sequences for every DSS in the set, and by checking that the resulting pattern of its presence/absence, its \"DSS signature\", was unique.",
