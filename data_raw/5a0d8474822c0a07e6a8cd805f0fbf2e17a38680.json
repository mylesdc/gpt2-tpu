            "text": "Infections and mental disorders are two of the major global disease burdens. While correlations between mental disorders and infections have been reported, the possible genetic links between them have not been assessed in large-scale studies. Moreover, the genetic basis of susceptibility to infection is largely unknown, as large-scale genomewide association studies of susceptibility to infection have been lacking. We utilized a large Danish population-based sample (N = 65,534) linked to nationwide population-based registers to investigate the genetic architecture of susceptibility to infection (heritability estimation, polygenic risk analysis, and a genome-wide association study (GWAS)) and examined its association with mental disorders (comorbidity analysis and genetic correlation). We found strong links between having at least one psychiatric diagnosis and the occurrence of infection (P = 2.16 \u00d7 10 \u2212208 , OR = 1.72). The SNP heritability of susceptibility to infection ranged from~2 to~7% in samples of differing psychiatric diagnosis statuses (suggesting the environment as a major contributor to susceptibility), and polygenic risk scores moderately but significantly explained infection status in an independent sample. We observed a genetic correlation of 0.496 (P = 2.17 \u00d7 10 \u221217 ) between a diagnosis of infection and a psychiatric diagnosis. While our GWAS did not identify genome-wide significant associations, we found 90 suggestive (P \u2264 10 \u22125 ) associations for susceptibility to infection. Our findings suggest a genetic component in susceptibility to infection and indicate that the occurrence of infections in individuals with mental illness may be in part genetically driven.",

Infections and inflammation have also been linked to the development of other diseases: autoimmune diseases, cancer, and neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and depression [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . Inter-individual differences influence the susceptibility to infection, which is likely to depend on environmental and social factors, vulnerable periods, such as psychological stress or immunocompromised conditions, and the host's genetic profile 7, 8 . Twin and adoption studies as well as epidemiological studies have indicated that hosts' genetic makeups influence infectious disease occurrences and outcomes of interactions between infectious pathogens and hosts [7] [8] [9] [10] . However, the genetic architecture of susceptibility to infection is largely unknown, and knowledge of the genetic composition of infections may help elucidate the mechanism of human complex diseases 8, 11 .",

A recent meta-analysis of pooled respiratory infection GWAS (including studies on tuberculosis, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, SARS-Coronavirus and pneumonia) found only one significant singlenucleotide polymorphism (SNP), in the IL4 gene 7 . Previous studies have often provided conflicting results and been hampered by low power, differences in study designs, and/or high risk of publication bias 7 . Recently, acknowledging the potential links between psychiatric disorders and infection, studies looking into the genetic of specific infections have been performed, including a study of infection (Toxoplasma gondii, Herpes simplex virus 1, Cytomegalovirus and Human herpesvirus 6) and inflammation in individuals with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder 13 , and a study of Toxoplasma gondii in individuals with schizophrenia 14 highlighted several genes and/ or pathways.",

From this group, 86,189 individuals were included in the iPSYCH2012 sample. Before quality control (QC) our sample included 78,050 successfully genotyped individuals. Following QC, 65,534 individuals remained: 19,645 individuals with no hospital contacts for psychiatric diagnoses (none of ICD-10: F00\u2212F99), and 45,889 individuals with one or more of the following mental disorders: ASD (F84.0-1, F84.5, F84.8-9; N = 12,331), ADHD (F90.0; N = 14,397), schizophrenia (F20; N = 2401), bipolar disorder (F30\u2212F31; N = 1391), single and recurrent depressive disorder (F32 \u2212F33; N = 18,511) and anorexia nervosa (F50.0; N = 2551). These diagnoses are based on data from the Danish Psychiatric Central Research Register only. A minority of these individuals (N = 1993) have been diagnosed with other psychiatric disorders (other codes in F00\u2212F99) and originally included as part of the random population sample. Individual-based data were available until emigration, death, or 31 December 2012 of a given individual. Three subsets were used across the analyses in this study: only the individuals without psychiatric diagnosis (no F00 \u2212F99 diagnosis), only the individuals with psychiatric diagnosis (primary or secondary iPSYCH diagnosis of F00 \u2212F99), or a combined sample with a covariate for having a psychiatric diagnosis. More details are given in the relevant sections. With regards to the infection diagnoses, Supplementary Table S1 includes sample sizes for all infection categories. All hospital contacts for infections (both in-and outpatient hospital contacts) were included with ICD-8 and ICD-10 codes listed in Supplementary  Table S2 , as used in previous studies 4, 22, 23 , and each person may have a history of more than one infection. We omitted all diagnoses listed as \"suspected\" or \"not found\". Controls for infections were defined as having none of the infection diagnoses in Table S1 , and controls for psychiatric disorders were defined as not having any ICD-10 diagnosis of F00\u2212F99 in the Danish Psychiatric Central Research Register, unless stated otherwise.",

Individuals whose parents and grandparents were born in Denmark were used as a reference in removing individuals who were a certain distance from the multivariate mean of the joint distribution of the first ten PCs. This was then repeated using only the iPSYCH sample to identify subtler withinpopulation differences. Samples were also removed based on genotype missingness, abnormal heterozygosity or ambiguous sex, based on genetic markers. Samples that were identified as duplicates were also removed. Lastly, samples that were found to be related to other samples (first and second degree) were removed, whereby the cases and then samples with a higher genotype call rate were prioritized. Following this, a new PCA was performed to obtain principal components for downstream analyses. For the imputation, only autosomal SNPs were used, and SNPs were removed based on low minor allele frequency (<0.01), Hardy\u2212Weinberg equilibrium P value (<10 \u22126 ), having more than two alleles, or being indels. Genotypes were phased with SHAPEIT3 25 and imputed with IMPUTE2 26 . Imputed markers were removed if they had an INFO score below 0.2, a MAF below 0.001, bestguess genotypes missing in >10% of subjects, HWE P < 1 \u00d7 10 \u22126 (in controls) or a highest probability for a genotype of less than 0.9. Markers were also removed if they were significantly associated with the genotyping wave. Two marker datasets were used: in the GWAS, all post-QC dosage data were used. This dataset included 11,600,722 markers. For the heritability, genetic correlation and PRS analyses, which are based on an aggregation of SNPs, the above dataset was filtered, resulting in a dataset of high-confidence imputations (best-guess genotypes), with markers having an INFO score of at least 0.8 and MAF of at least 0.01. This dataset included 7,071,055 markers. Positions throughout this paper are in hg19.",

Given that we observe psychiatric patients have a higher incidence of infections, the two variables are not independent 23 . Also, the direction of causality is unknown. To avoid creating PRS that could misrepresent the genetic effects on infection risk (i.e., predicts psychiatric outcomes, which, in turn, predict infection as an environmental exposure) we develop our PRS for infections from a GWAS of infections in patients without psychiatric outcomes (N = 19,645). We used the summary statistics from this GWAS as the training dataset, and the subset of psychiatric cases as the target sample (N = 45,889). As the PRS was trained in a nonpsychiatric population, any PRS\u2212infection correlations are not likely to be mediated by the current expression of psychiatric outcomes. Furthermore, any confounding between psychiatric diagnoses and infection within the psychiatric population should be independent of the infection PRS by construction and should only contribute to residual variation. In this context, our target sample (the psychiatric cases) will have slightly less power to detect a reduced effect of the PRS relative to a healthy population sample, but the confound should not increase false positives. We used an r 2 threshold of 0.1 in a window of 250 kbp for clumping. As both the training sample and target sample used the same SNP dataset, there was a full overlap between both samples in terms of marker data availability. We ran PRSice with P value thresholds of 0.01\u22121 with intervals of 0.01, and the regression included covariates for age, age-squared, sex and the first ten PCs.

To transform the observed heritabilities to liability-scale heritabilities 39 , we adjusted for the proportion of infection cases in the different groups as well as for different values of the lifetime prevalence, k (the iPSYCH individuals are too young to estimate the true value of k), which allowed us to provide the maximal bound for the heritabilities, given the proportions of cases in our sample. The maximal values of the heritability on the liability scale are around 7% in psychiatric controls, 5.5% in psychiatric cases and 5% in the combined sample (Fig. 2) , suggesting a modest genetic component for susceptibility to infection.

Since both phenotypes were derived from the same sample, and to avoid any potential ascertainment bias due to the high correlation between them (and given that most individuals in the sample were selected for having a psychiatric diagnosis), the genetic correlation analysis was repeated using only QC-passing samples selected as part of the random population sample (N = 21,706: 1062 individuals with both phenotypes; 6693 individuals with only infections; 1113 individuals with only psychiatric diagnoses; 12,838 individuals with neither phenotype). While this analysis had a reduced sample size due to the lower number of psychiatric cases in particular, the observed correlation was similar (r g = 0.518, SE = 0.208).

In a recent study of the iPSYCH sample, most iPSYCH disorders as well as a cross-disorder phenotype showed significant heritabilities 24 . Given this and the observed heritability for infection, we also examined the genetic correlation between having an infection diagnosis and having a psychiatric diagnosis. We found a strong genetic correlation between the two.

The observed modest genetic contribution to infection indicates that it is primarily nongenetic influences at work, which is not surprising, as infections are most often transient and are transmitted from one person to another. Nonetheless, we found that the polygenic risk score for infection could explain a small proportion of the variance in terms of the risk of having an infection in an independent sample, which is a novel finding.",

Thus, adding psychiatric cases to the analysis (while introducing a covariate for having a psychiatric diagnosis) increased the sample size but reduced the heritability estimate. In the individual groups, the heritability was higher among psychiatric controls than among psychiatric cases. This could suggest that, in individuals with a psychiatric diagnosis, the environment may play a bigger role in susceptibility to infection and/or that there are G \u00d7 E interactions driving this difference. Similarly, there could be a special burden of infection-psychiatric pleiotropic variants in psychiatric cases. It should above all be emphasized that the observed-scale heritability in the two groups did not differ significantly in our study, and, while the question of what is behind this difference is extremely interesting, this study cannot make an authoritative statement on the subject in its current design. It should also be noted that, given the individuals may be diagnosed with infections later on, the lifetime risk estimate k, employed in the transformation to the liability scale (calculated from the random population sample), may change, and, as our phenotype encompasses many ICD-10 codes, there are no past epidemiological studies providing an estimate of lifetime risk. As we have examined the heritability for several values of k, we believe our results provide a sensible range for the heritability to susceptibility to infection. However, as the true proportion of cases may also change, as the sample ages, these figures could change as well. That said, the SNP heritability estimates we found were comparable to those reported for common infections and infection-associated procedures in a recent study relying on self-reported data 11 .",

The observed genetic correlation could indicate a causal overlap and an etiological role for infections in subgroups of mental disorders. It might also be the case that infections and immune responses could have a triggering role in the development of some mental disorders, with longlasting subsequent immune alterations in individuals with mental disorders, as is suspected in autoimmune diseases, where infections and susceptibility genes are considered the main risk factors 41 . Moreover, socioeconomic and educational factors might prove important, together with periods of psychological stress or altered behavior, in making the individual more susceptible to acquiring infections.

Furthermore, this gene is also involved in brain development through neuronal migration 43 . As our GWAS controlled for psychiatric diagnosis, this could be an interesting illustration of a complex genetic factor, perhaps exhibiting pleiotropic effects and/or interactions with other factors. More recently, this gene has been highlighted in studies of schizophrenia and specific infections: Cytomegalovirus and Toxoplasma gondii, although the associations with SNPs in this gene were not genomewide significant 14, 44 . Thus, while no single SNP reached genome-wide significance in our study, possibly due to small effect sizes and a not-large-enough sample size, our results might still be informative regarding potential candidate genes for infection, and for studying the genetic overlaps between infection and mental disorders.

In the same vein, it is also possible that the genetic factors that manifest susceptibility to infection in later stages of life were not captured here. As our dataset included diagnoses of only psychiatric/neurological conditions, infections, and autoimmune diseases (which are correlated with psychiatric conditions) 50 , we did not have an appropriate third category of diseases within which we could examine the incidence of infections. Furthermore, we could include only individuals with hospital contact for infection; hence, the less severe cases of infections were not included. However, this could also be advantageous, as the investigated phenotypes have been so severe as to require a hospital contact, meaning that they may represent a more defined group. Nonetheless, the potential impact of misclassification in the individuals not recorded with infections could result in the genetic associations in our study representing the severity of infection rather than susceptibility to infection. It should also be noted that our models do not incorporate the temporal component of the association between infections and psychiatric disorders; as our phenotypes were complex, and as they may represent more than one infection and/or psychiatric disorder diagnosed in a given individual, our study does not answer questions pertaining to the directionality of this association. Moreover, the genetic contribution might have been greater if studying individuals with severe infections, where genetic susceptibility to infection might play a larger role. Even though this is the largest GWAS to date on infections requiring hospital contact, the included heterogeneous groups of infections might warrant an even larger sample to display the underlying genetic architecture of the susceptibility to infection using GWAS. Lastly, while using a large sample from a homogenous population is advantageous in that it eliminates certain confounders, especially in terms of genetic variation, the results could prove to be specific to the Danish population, as genetic associations across populations can differ based on the presence of the variant in one population but not others, difference in allele frequencies when it is present in more than one population, as well as differences in disease prevalence and variant effect sizes across populations 51 .",

The genotyping of the iPSYCH samples was supported by grants from the Lundbeck Foundation, the Stanley Foundation, the Simons Foundation (SFARI 311789), and NIMH (5U01MH094432-02). This research has been conducted using the Danish National Biobank resource supported by the Novo Nordisk Foundation. IPSYCH data were stored and analyzed at the Computerome HPC Facility (http://www.computerome.dtu.dk/), with the support of the HPC team led by Dr. Ali Syed. iPSYCH data are stored in a national HPC facility in Denmark. The iPSYCH initiative is committed to providing access to these data to the scientific community, in accordance with Danish law. Researchers may be granted access upon request to the iPSYCH management. Summary statistics for the GWAS for the PRS and the GWAS with the combined sample are available from the corresponding author.
