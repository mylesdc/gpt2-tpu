Then, an occupation is assigned to individuals: every member of the population either goes to school or workplace, or remains at home (for instance as a retired or family worker), following census data on employment rates by age.

Following the state-of-the-art estimates on the generation time distributions and infectiousness profiles for the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic given in [8] , we consider infectiousness over time to depend on the context where interaction occurs and on the age of the case -the population is categorized as \"children\", i.e., individuals aged less than 10 years, and \"adults\", i.e., all other individuals in the population. Specifically, infectiousness profiles k \u03c1,a (t\u2212\u03c4 i ) (where i, \u03c1, a, t and \u03c4 i are defined as in Section 1.3) are derived from discretized Weibull distributions with an offset of 1 (which is equivalent to having a latency period of 1 day). This leads to setting-specific values of the generation time which are: 3.7 days (standard deviation: 3.1 days) for children in household; 1.1 days (standard deviation: 0.4 days) for children at school and in the community; 2.3 days (standard deviation: 2.9 days) for adults. The distributions of the generation times are reported in Figure S1A . The model has only four free parameters, namely the transmission rates in the different social contexts. Setting-specific transmission rates were estimated in such a way that the proportions of cases in the different settings are consistent with empirical estimates [6, 9, 10, 11] , namely 30% of cases in households, 18% in schools, 19% in workplaces and 33% in the general community. As in [3, 5] , different transmissibility scenarios can be obtained by multiplying all transmission rates for suitable constant values. Choosing generation time distributions and transmission rates determines the value of the epidemic doubling time -i.e., the time required for the number of infectious individuals to double-, which is a key quantity for the assessment of the effectiveness of containment strategies. The basic reproduction number R 0 is defined as the average number of secondary infections caused by a typical primary infection in a fully susceptible population [12] . However, in complex models with highly heterogeneous mixing, as the one used in this work, the definition of a \"typical\" infectious individual is unclear. Therefore, in the parametrization procedure we used R rand , in place of R 0 , which is defined as the average number of secondary infections generated by a randomly selected individual in a fully susceptible population [6] . Ferguson et al. [6] found that for US and UK populations, the following relation holds:",

As the demography of the Netherlands (and of France) is closely related to that of the UK [1], we use the same adjustment term 0.2. In our simulations having transmission parameters leading to R rand = 1.5 we estimate an epidemic doubling time of 3.13 days, which is in excellent agreement with the estimates given in [6] (namely 3.16 days) for the simulation having R rand = 1.5 and R 0 = 1.7. This reinforces the choice of using Equation (2) for defining R 0 (see Figure S1B ). In addition, this allows a simpler comparison between our results and the ones reported in the literature: thus all results are presented in terms of R 0 (instead of R rand ).",

This probability accounts for the combination of two factors: the probability of developing symptoms (which is clearly a characteristic of the pathogen) and the probability of detecting a case, given that she/he is symptomatic. The probability of being symptomatic for past influenza viruses has been estimated to be in the range 50%-75% [5, 14, 15] , but it may be even higher for a new, more aggressive, strain. In addition, it is expected that, in case of an emerging pandemic, healthcare systems would be able to identify around 90% of symptomatic cases [5, 6, 7] . Therefore, the combined close contact detection probability is assumed to be in the range 40%-100%. As a reference value we assume P c = 0.6.",

The effect of the different parameters in shaping outbreak probability can be explained by a linear model having P c , P g , log(T i ), T t and T p as independent variables. The goodness of fit is highlighted by the high values of the coefficient of determination R 2 , which is estimated to be in the range 0.88-0.95 (see Table S1 and Figre S2A). For each choice of R 0 , all these variables are strongly significant, except for T p which is significant only for R 0 < 1.5 (see Table S1 and Figure S2B ) and thus we conclude that reactive school closure is important for containment only for mild epidemics. In addition, this analysis highlights that the two most relevant parameters are P c and T i , i.e., the larger the fraction of detected cases and the lower the delay in starting interventions, the lower the probability that a virus escape leads to an epidemic outbreak.",

Figure S3B clearly shows that delay in the start of intervention drastically increases outbreak probability: in particular starting interventions with a delay of more than 20 days for epidemics having R 0 larger than 1.3 is almost equivalent to not intervening at all. On the other hand, starting interventions with a delay of 1 day only can drastically increase the containment probability even for large values of R 0 . Figure S3C shows that while a delay of 2 days in household quarantine after case detection does not make a large difference, a delay of 4 days can make containment much more difficult, even for low values of R 0 ; on the other hand, household quarantine immediately after case detection, though very difficult to implement, would lead to systematically better results in terms of outbreak containment. Figure S3D shows that the variability in P g has a clear impact on outbreak probability. Figure S3E shows the effect of different initial interventions on the laboratory's contact network. It shows that closure of the laboratory is the only crucial intervention to put in place soon after detection of the accidental escape, especially for large values of R 0 . Additional measures such as quarantine of laboratory workers households and closure of schools and workplaces attended by households members of laboratory workers are of little impact. Figure S3F shows the negligible impact of changes in P r . This is due to the fact that changing P r from 0.5P g to 0.9P g means changing P r from 0.15 to 0.27.",

We do not consider further locations for the BSL facility in the Netherlands, as population density is rather homogeneous in the whole country and it is difficult to identify wide low-density areas. In the main text we compare results by assuming reference interventions in all seeding areas (see Fig. 4 in the main text). Here we analyze results for France, by considering both urban and rural seeding (see Figure S5A and B), in greater detail.",

Without considering control measures, the probability of observing an epidemic outbreak after virus escape is quite similar to that in the Dutch scenario: slight differences can be observed for low values of R 0 (see Figure S6A ). On the other hand, marked differences exist when the reference intervention is put in place: in particular for R 0 values lower than 1.7 outbreak probability in the Paris scenario is more than two times higher than in the Netherlands case (see Figure S6A ). Such large differences can be due to dissimilarities in social and demographic characteristics of French and Dutch populations because, despite a general similarity, some marked country-specific features such as age structure and average household size exist (see the comparison presented in [1] ). However, although quantitatively different, the general patterns obtained by varying P c and T i are the same observed in the Dutch case (compare Figure S6B and C with Figure S3A and B) .",
