The mAb A9E8 recognized phages displaying peptides with the consensus motif SVQYHPL. Amino acid sequence of the motif exactly matched 213 SVQYHPL 219 of the gp90. Further identification of the displayed B cell epitope was conducted using a set of truncated peptides expressed as GST fusion proteins and the Western blot results indicated that 213 SVQYHPL 219 was the minimal determinant of the linear B cell epitope recognized by the mAb A9E8. Moreover, an eight amino acid peptide SVQYHPLA was proven to be the minimal unit of the epitope with the maximal binding activity to mAb A9E8. The REV-A-positive chicken serum reacted with the minimal linear epitopes in Western blot, revealing the importance of the eight amino acids of the epitope in antibody-epitope binding activity. Furthermore, we found that the epitope is a common motif shared among REV-A and other members of REV group.",

Studies showed that recombinant gp90 protein expressed in Pichia pastoris induced a protective immune response against REV in chickens [19] . Precise mapping of epitopes in gp90 is important for understanding antibody-mediated protection and developing epitope-based marker vaccines and diagnostic tools. Cui et al. [20] reported the generation and partial characterization of a panel of 11 mAbs against the nondefective REV Strain T, and showed that the epitope was on the viral envelope glycoprotein. However, they only identified the relative regions in REV envelope glycoprotein recognized by the mAbs, and did not map the fine locations of the epitopes. To our knowledge, there has been no report on linear epitope mapping of the gp90 of REV.",

The mAb A9E8 showed strong reactivity against purified whole virus in Western blot and could be used to detect REV-A antigen by an indirect immunofluorescence assay. The linear epitope recognized by the mAb A9E8 was defined as SVQYHPL by screening a random phage display peptide library. This peptide sequence was identical to 213 SVQYHPL 219 of the gp90 protein of REV-A. N-or Cterminal deletions of amino acids of this epitope demonstrated that 213 SVQYHPL 219 is the minimal requirement for recognition by A9E8. Fusion proteins GST-R1 with extended amino acid residues at the C terminus of the motif SVQYHPL showed increased binding activity compared with that of GST-H7wt in Western blot, indicating that alanine alone significantly increased binding activity of the core epitope to mAb A9E8. Thus, the peptide SVQYHPLA was determined to be the minimal unit of the epitope with the maximal binding activity to mAb A9E8.",

Some neutralizing epitopes, however, are highly conserved across most of the viruses in the same group [29, 30] . A novel epitope was mapped within the highly conserved flavivirus fusion loop peptide 98 DRXW 101 by phage-display biopanning and structure modeling using mAb 2A10G6 that had broad cross-reactivity with dengue virus (DENV) 1-4, yellow fever virus (YFV), West Nile virus (WNV), and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) viruses. This mAb potently neutralized DENV 1-4, YFV, and WNV and conferred protection against lethal challenge with DENV 1-4 and WNV in murine model. Further functional studies revealed that 2A10G6 blocked infection at a step after viral attachment. These results show that the broad cross-reactivity epitope recognized by neutralizing mAb 2A10G6 is highly conserved among DENV 1-4, YFV and WNV [29] . An epitope recognized by mAb 51 belonging to isotype IgM was mapped to 215 KQEKD 219 of the VP1 capsid protein of Enterovirus 71 (EV71), which possessed neutralizing activity in vitro and provided 100% in vivo passive protection against lethal challenge with EV71 strain HFM 41. BLAST analyses of the neutralizing epitope revealed that it was highly conserved among all EV71 strains, but not coxsachievirus 16 [30] . In this study, the epitope recognized by neutralizing mAb A9E8 was mapped to a highly conserved region of the gp90 protein among REVs, which would be useful for development of REV marker vaccines and diagnostic techniques.",
