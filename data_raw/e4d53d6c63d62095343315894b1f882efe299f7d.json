Most cases and sustained transmission occurred in China, but travel-associated cases have been reported in other countries, including Europe and Italy. Since the symptoms are similar to other respiratory infections, differential diagnosis in travellers arriving from countries with wide-spread COVID-19 must include other more common infections such as influenza and other respiratory tract diseases.",

The outbreak has spread rapidly, affecting other parts of China, and cases have been recorded on several continents (Asia, Australia, Europe and North America); further global spread is likely to occur [4] .",

For confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections, reported illnesses have ranged from people with little to no symptoms to people being severely ill, having pneumonia and dying [6] . Multiple body tracts may be involved, including the respiratory, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal and neurologic tracts. However, more common symptoms are fever (83-98%), cough (76-82%) and shortness of breath (31-55%) [6, 7] . These nonspecific symptoms are shared by many other frequent infectious diseases of the respiratory tract caused by bacteria and viruses, most of which are selflimiting but may also progress to severe conditions [8, 9] . Among these, the most relevant is influenza, usually characterised by fever, myalgia, headache and non-productive cough, that may also cause complications with high morbidity and mortality rate, such as pneumonia, myocarditis, central nervous system disease and death [10, 11] . In addition, other previously known human coronaviruses cause similar, although milder clinical signs, including the alphacoronaviruses 229E and NL63, and the betacoronaviruses OC43 and HKU1, while two other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, cause severe respiratory syndrome in humans [12] .",
