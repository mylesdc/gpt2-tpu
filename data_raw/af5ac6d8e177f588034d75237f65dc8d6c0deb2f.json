            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) virus (PRRSV) infections are characterized by prolonged viremia and viral shedding consistent with incomplete immunity. Type I interferons (IFN) are essential for mounting efficient antiviral innate and adaptive immune responses, but in a recent study, North American PRRSV genotype 2 isolates did not induce, or even strongly inhibited, IFN-\u03b1 in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC), representing \"professional IFN-\u03b1-producing cells\". Since inhibition of IFN-\u03b1 expression might initiate PRRSV pathogenesis, we further characterized PRRSV effects and host modifying factors on IFN-\u03b1 responses of pDC. Surprisingly, a variety of type 1 and type 2 PRRSV directly stimulated IFN-\u03b1 secretion by pDC. The effect did not require live virus and was mediated through the TLR7 pathway. Furthermore, both IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 significantly enhanced the pDC production of IFN-\u03b1 in response to PRRSV exposure. PRRSV inhibition of IFN-\u03b1 responses from enriched pDC stimulated by CpG oligodeoxynucleotides was weak or absent. VR-2332, the prototype genotype 2 PRRSV, only suppressed the responses by 34%, and the highest level of suppression (51%) was induced by a Chinese highly pathogenic PRRSV isolate. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that pDC respond to PRRSV and suggest that suppressive activities on pDC, if any, are moderate and strain-dependent. Thus, pDC may be a source of systemic IFN-\u03b1 responses reported in PRRSV-infected animals, further contributing to the puzzling immunopathogenesis of PRRS.",

The virus is characterized by an enormous genetic variability with the existence of two genotypes of PRRSV referred as genotype 1 (European) and 2 (North American), and the emergence of highly virulent isolates in Asia within genotype 2 [5] . Macrophages in lung and lympoid tissues are the primary site of PRRSV replication [6, 7] , although other cell types such as monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDC) and monocyte-derived macrophages are susceptible to infection [8, 9] . Due to the persistence of PRRSV in infected pigs, it was proposed that the virus modulates host innate and acquired immune responses [10, 11] . While PRRSV is highly sensitive to IFN-\u03b1 both in vitro [12] [13] [14] and in vivo [15] , the virus promotes weakly or not at all in vitro synthesis of type I IFN in porcine alveolar macrophages (PAM) and MoDC [16] [17] [18] . However, systemic IFN-\u03b1 was observed after infections with various PRRSV isolates [15, 16, 19, 20] , indicating that certain cell types are able to sense infection.",

            "text": "Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) are a major source of IFN-\u03b1 and other inflammatory cytokines after exposure to TLR7 and TLR9 ligands, including many viruses and bacterial DNA [21] . Although pDC are a rare cell type, they can produce around 100 times more IFN-\u03b1 than any other cellular type. They are often able to sense viruses in the absence of viral replication. Consequently, they represent an important candidate cell type for investigating early immune events that could influence early control of virus replication or induction of adaptive antiviral immune response [22] . In the pig, these cells have been identified as CD4 + CD123 + CD135 + CD172a + CD14 -, which can be differentiated from monocytes, macrophages and MoDC which lack CD4, CD123 and CD135 but express CD14 and in the case of macrophages and monocyte subset also CD163 [23, 24] . Interestingly, stimulation of pDC with genotype 2 PRRSV was reported not to result in detectable IFN-\u03b1 release [25] . Moreover, the IFN-\u03b1 production induced by CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) or transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) was potently inhibited by North American PRRSV [26] . Considering the observation of in vivo IFN-\u03b1, important differences in the virulence of genotype 1 and genotype 2, and the possible regulation of pDC responses by cytokines induced during PRRS infection, we examined how PRRSV of different genotypes and virulence interact with pDC and how cytokines influence pDC responses.",

PAM were obtained from bronchoalveolar lung lavages [31] . Specific-free pathogen (SPF) pigs from 6 week-to 12 month-old were euthanized and lungs were aseptically removed. Briefly, lungs were filled up with approximately one to two liters of PBS containing a 2\u00d7 concentrated penicillin/streptomycin (Pen/Strep) solution (Gibco, Invitrogen, Switzerland). The lavage was collected and cells were recovered by centrifugation (350 g, 10 min, 4\u00b0C), followed by three wash steps with 2 \u00d7 Pen/Strep PBS and centrifugation at 350 g for 10 min. PAM were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco) supplemented with Pen/Strep and 10% FBS or frozen in liquid nitrogen until use. MARC-145 cells and PAM were cultured at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO 2 atmosphere. MoDC were prepared using interleukin-4 (IL-4)/granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) as previously described [32] . For all experiment except in Figure 1D and 1E, CD172a enrichment of pDC was performed as described earlier [33] . Briefly, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 6 week-to 12 month-old pigs were isolated by Ficoll-Paque differential centrifugation [34] followed by CD172a (mAb 74-22-15a) enrichment using MACS sorting LD columns (Miltenyi Biotec GmbH, Germany) leading to > 80% of CD172a positive cells and 2-8% CD172 low CD4 high pDC. The cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS and 20 \u03bcM of \u03b2-mercaptoethanol (Invitrogen, Switzerland). For the experiment shown in Figure 1D and 1E, PBMC were depleted of monocytes by anti-CD14 (mAb CAM36A, VMRD Inc., Washington, USA) followed by CD4 (mAb PT90A, VMRD Inc.) selection with MACS sorting LS column (Miltenyi Biotec GmbH, Germany). This sorting resulted in a pDC purity of 10%.",

At each time point the cells were analyzed by three-color flow cytometry for expression of CD172a, CD4 and viral nucleocapsid protein. After staining with the cell surface marker followed by goat isotype specific anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) or R-phycoerythrin (RPE) conjugates (SouthernBiotech, Birmingham, AL, USA), the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, washed and permeabilized with 0.3% (wt/vol) saponin in PBS. The anti-nucleocapsid mAb SDOW-17A was added during the permeabilization step for 15 min, followed by a wash step with 0.1% (wt/vol) saponin and addition of biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG1 conjugate (SouthernBiotech), diluted in 0.3% (wt/vol) saponin for 20 min at 4\u00b0C.

Incubation of CD172a + cells with LV or its MARC-145 cell-adapted form, LVP23, at an MOI of 0.1 did not elicit reproducible IFN\u03b1 expression (data not shown), but showed robust IFN-\u03b1 production at an MOI of 1 ( Figure 1B) . To further investigate if pDC production of IFN-\u03b1 was a universal response to PRRSV, type 2 strains VR-2332, JA-1262, a virulent recent USA field isolate, SY0608, a highly pathogenic field isolate from China, and the avirulent type 1 Olot/91 strain were incubated with enriched pDC. All isolates directly elicited IFN-\u03b1 secretion by pDC, with type 2 PRRSV prototype VR-2332 displaying the lowest activity, whereas type 1 strain Olot/91 showing the highest average effect ( Figure 1C) . Overall, all isolates induced IFN-\u03b1 secretion and the range of IFN-\u03b1 production was independent of genotype or isolate virulence. To assess whether monocytes could be involved in the PRRSVinduced IFN-\u03b1 secretion, we incubated unsorted PBMCs, CD14 + , CD14 + CD4and CD14 -CD4 + sorted cells with LV, LVP23, and CpG-ODN as a positive control. Whereas no or only low levels of IFN-\u03b1 were found in PBMCs after PRRSV exposure ( Figure 1D ), high amounts were detected in the CD14 -CD4 + cell fraction ( Figure 1E ). No IFN-\u03b1 was detected in CD14 + cells (data not shown) excluding the possibility that monocytes induce IFN-\u03b1 in response to PRRSV. To confirm that pDC were indeed the source of IFN-\u03b1 in enriched CD172a cells, CD4, CD172a and intracellular IFN-\u03b1 staining was performed. It revealed that only a proportion of CD4 + cells among the CD172a + fraction were IFN-\u03b1 positive after PRRSV or CpG-ODN stimulation whereas no IFN-\u03b1 expressing cells were observed in the CD172 + CD4cells ( Figure 2 ). Together with the data shown in Figure 1E , these results demonstrate that CD172a + CD14 -CD4 + pDC [23] are the source of PRRSV-derived IFN-\u03b1 responses. We also observed a higher percentage of pDC when they were stimulated by PRRSV (4%) compared to mock (1.5%) after 16 h of culture suggesting that PRRSV promotes survival of the pDC. It confirms that PRRSV interacted with pDC and promoted IFN-\u03b1 secretion since the frequency of mocktreated pDC decreased in absence of stimulus.",

As shown in Figure 3A , the intensity of IFN-\u03b1 production was not altered by UV-inactivation indicating that the pDC response did not require replicating PRRSV. In the presence of IFN-\u03b3, pDC-derived IFN-\u03b1 secretion was increased with both UV-untreated and UV-treated PRRSV (see also Figure 4 ). Considering the central role of TLR7 in sensing RNA viruses by pDC [39] , we investigated the effects of the specific TLR7 inhibitor IRS661 [40] to inhibit PRRSV-induced IFN-\u03b1 production. IRS661 is active on porcine cells and inhibits influenza virus-mediated pDC activation compared to a scrambled oligonulceotide [37] . We observed that pDCderived IFN-\u03b1 responses were drastically reduced or abrogated by TLR7 inhibition (Figure 3B ), indicating that the TLR7 pathway is intimately involved in pDC sensing of PRRSV.",

Furthermore, the prototype type 2 strain VR-2332, although more inhibitory than the genotype 1 viruses tested, was not as inhibitory as previously reported [26] . Indeed, porcine pDC respond positively to the presence of viable or inactivated PRRSV by secretion of IFN-\u03b1 in amounts sufficient to protect permissive MoDC from PRRSV infection. Differences in animal age were not important, as we obtained similar results with 6 week-old and 1 year-old blood donors. However, the genetic of the pigs could possibly play a role since differential expression genes, especially IFNA, have been highlighted in phenotypic pig groups in response to PRRSV [41] . Another difference compared to the data from Calzada-Nova et al. could be the methodology and cell isolation procedures. Interestingly, the highly pathogenic Chinese isolate was the most suppressive virus tested, pointing to possible strain-dependent differences in the interaction of PRRSV with pDC which should be further investigated with similarly pathogenic viruses. The strain differences in the suppression of IFN-\u03b1 might relate to certain PRRSV proteins that counteract downstream elements of the pathway [42] .",

Compared to other viruses, including TGEV [43, 44] , influenza virus [45] , classical swine fever virus (CSFV) [46] and foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) [37, 47] , tested in our laboratory using the same methodology, the levels of IFN-\u03b1 induced by PRRSV could be classified as moderate. PRRSV is clearly a stronger inducer than CSFV or FMDV, but less potent than TGEV or influenza virus, which reach the same levels as CpG-ODN. The responses observed in vitro are relevant to in vivo conditions, in which systemic IFN-\u03b1 or IFN-\u03b1 secreting cells in the lung were reported in several pigs infected with various PRRSV isolates [15, 16, 19, 20, 48] . Also, Barranco et al. reported increased numbers of non-identified IFN-\u03b1 expressing cells by immunohistochemistry in lymph nodes of animals infected with the Spanish isolate 2982 [49] . Interestingly, the ability of PRRSV to induce IFN-\u03b1 does not seem to be related to the suppression of TLR9 ligandinduced IFN-\u03b1. The highly pathogenic Chinese strain, SY0608, induced similar levels of IFN-\u03b1 as did LVP23, but was more suppressive for CpG-induced IFN-\u03b1 compared to all strains tested.",

            "text": "Host factors regulating pDC responses may be critical to anti-PRRSV responses, since the presence of different patterns of cytokines could promote an immunological micro-environment favoring or inhibiting pDC responses. For example, in mice Th1-matured pDC stimulated by TLR7 ligand respond more strongly with higher secretion of IL-6 and IFN-\u03b1 than do Th2-pDC, but both Th1-and Th2-pDC were more strongly activated compared to unpolarized pDC [50] . As we show here in swine, both IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 enhance pDC responses to PRRSV. IFN-\u03b2 only enhanced pDC responsiveness to genotype 1 PRRSV; it is not yet known if this is a general feature of type 1 PRRSV or a strain-specific effect. The regulatory cytokine IL-10 was thought to strongly impact PRRSV pathogenesis and was one of the proposed mechanisms used by PRRSV to escape the innate and adaptive immune system. However, the induction of IL-10 by PRRSV is not clearly established [11, 51] , although its presence suppresses type I IFN induction in pDC [52, 53] . It has been reported that PRRSV could induce IL-4 in the serum [20] and IFN-\u03b3 both in the serum [54] and in the lungs [48] of infected pigs. In particular IFN-\u03b3 could play multiple beneficial roles against PRRSV. It is known to have an antiviral activity against PRRSV [55] , to generally promote natural killer and cytotoxic T-cell activity and to induce classical macrophages activation with increased anti-microbial functions, antigen-presenting activities and reduced ability to secrete regulatory cytokines such as IL-10 [56] . As IFN-\u03b1 is known to promote IFN-\u03b3, our data showing that vice versa IFN-\u03b3 also promotes IFN-\u03b1 in pDC, it would appear that stimulating this axis will be beneficial for immunity against PRRSV. IL-4 on the other hand is known to promote the alternative pathway of macrophage activation resulting in \"wound-healing\" macrophages [56] , which would be important to repair tissue damage in the lung during PRRSV infection. Through promoting pDC activation by PRRSV, this cytokine would also help establishing an antiviral state.",

This effect may be caused not only by IFN-\u03b1 but also by other type I IFN's such as IFN-\u03b2, known to be produced by pDC [57] . In addition to its antiviral activity, IFN-\u03b1 is an efficient natural adjuvant promoting adaptive immune responses [15, 58] . For these reasons pDC responses induced by PRRSV are relevant to understanding antiviral immune responses and the pathogenesis of PRRS.",
