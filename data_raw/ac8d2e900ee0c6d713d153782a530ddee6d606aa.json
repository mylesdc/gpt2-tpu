It also poses a public health concern when avian influenza subtypes infect humans, often with high mortality. Understanding viral genetic factors which positively contribute to influenza A virus (IAV) fitnessinfectivity, spread and pathogenesisis of great importance both for human and livestock health. PB1-F2 is a small accessory protein encoded by IAV and in mammalian hosts has been implicated in a wide range of functions that contribute to increased pathogenesis. In the avian host, the protein has been understudied despite high-level full-length conservation in avian IAV isolates, which is in contrast to the truncations of the PB1-F2 length frequently found in mammalian host isolates. Here we report that the presence of a full-length PB1-F2 protein, from a low pathogenicity H9N2 avian influenza virus, prolongs infectious virus shedding from directly inoculated chickens, thereby enhancing transmission of the virus by lengthening the transmission window to contact birds. As well as extending transmission, the presence of a full-length PB1-F2 suppresses pathogenicity evidenced by an increased minimum lethal dose in embryonated chicken eggs and increasing survival in directly infected birds when compared to a virus lacking an ORF for PB1-F2. We propose that there is a positive pressure to maintain a full-length functional PB1-F2 protein upon infection of avian hosts as it contributes to the effective transmission of IAV in the field. Five supplementary tables and one supplementary figure are available in the online Supplementary Material.",

Spillover of these viruses into domesticated poultry populations has resulted in the evolution of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) subtypes such as the Asian-lineage H5N1 which has been circulating continuously in birds since 2003 and has caused upwards of 700 human infections . Low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) H9N2 viruses are frequently found circulating in the same geographical areas as HPAI H5N1. HPAI H5N1 as well as LPAI H9N2 can cause a significant economic and welfare burden in geographical regions such as the Middle East and Southeast Asia. In these areas both subtypes are enzootic in the poultry populations making control costly and challenging (Alexander, 2007) . As well as threatening food security, an increasing range of avian influenza subtypes causing zoonotic infections in humans is of considerable concern for public health agencies (Yu et al., 2014) . Increasing the fundamental knowledge base about avian influenza virus interactions within avian hosts will enable the design and implementation of better control strategies.",

In addition there are a plethora of accessory proteins encoded by IAVs that are non-essential for replication, but may contribute to the virulence, pathogenesis and transmissibility of strains in different host species. The first of these so-called accessory proteins to be identified was the PB1-F2 protein (Chen et al., 2001) , which can range in full-length size from 90 to 101 aa and is translated in a +1 reading frame from the same viral mRNA that encodes the viral RNA-dependant RNA polymerase subunit, PB1.",

However, in viruses isolated from mammalian hosts, humans and swine, PB1-F2 is often truncated as a result of mutations that generate stop codons in the PB1-F2 ORF (Krumbholz et al., 2011; Zell et al., 2007) . More than half of all human and swine isolate sequences deposited in the public sequence databases encode a PB1-F2 less than 90 aa in length. In contrast, more than 90 % of sequences from isolates sequenced from avian hosts retain the coding capacity for a full-length PB1-F2 protein (Kamal et al., 2015; Zell et al., 2007) . This disparity of PB1-F2 full-length conservation between virus isolates from mammalian and avian hosts suggests a unique pressure to maintain a full-length PB1-F2 protein with evolutionary significance in avian hosts. The most fundamental evolutionary pressure for IAVs is to transmit. To date there has been no robust assessment of the involvement of PB1-F2 in transmission of influenza viruses in any host species.",

In this study, we utilize a LPAI H9N2 to assess whether PB1-F2 contributes to transmission dynamics in chickens. We measure infectivity, pathogenic outcomes as well as transmissibility using two different transmission scenario settings. The first scenario models transmission in a crowded, confined environment, representing a large commercial poultry shed. The second scenario models transmission that may result as a consequence of sporadic contact, reflective of behaviours in the natural avian species reservoir and incursions into traditional backyard flocks found abundantly in the Middle East and Southeast Asia where H9N2 viruses are enzootic.",

To verify and extend these data, we downloaded all full-length PB1 influenza segment nucleotide sequences from the NCBI database for avian, swine and human hosts, removing duplicate sequences. Subsequently, 24 803 PB1 nucleotide sequences were analysed in the +1 reading frame to determine the length of the PB1-F2 ORF. We defined full-length PB1-F2 as 87 aa or longer since this is the length of the well-studied PB1-F2 protein of PR8 virus, and has been shown to enable mitochondrial targeting in all instances where it has been assessed. Other published analyses have used a PB1-F2 length of 79 aa or more (Zell et al., 2007) , based on the minimal length for an intact mitochondrial targeting sequence of porcine isolates in HeLa cells (Zell et al., 2007) , but this is a notional cut-off bearing in mind mitochondrial targeting has been seen for a PB1-F2 of only 75 aa for PR8 in Vero cells (Yamada et al., 2004) vs 87 aa in HeLa cells (Gibbs et al., 2003) and even then not all PB1-F2 proteins of length greater than 89 aa localize to the mitochondria (Chen et al., 2010) . However, a reanalysis of our data for length at least 79 aa indicates little alteration of the frequencies from using 89 aa or more (Table S1 , available in the online Supplementary Material).

A reverse genetics system for the A/chicken/Pakistan/UDL01/08 (UDL01) H9N2 strain used previously (Long et al., 2016) was rescued as infectious virus using standard techniques (Hoffmann et al., 2000) . UDL01 contains a full-length 90 aa PB1-F2 protein encoded in the +1 reading frame of the PB1 segment, and this virus was designated as WT. Alongside the WT version we generated an isogenic virus that had a stop codon introduced at aa position 12 in the PB1-F2 ORF, producing a non-functional 11 aa PB1-F2 fragment, which we termed knockout (KO). The introduction of the stop codon did not alter the aa sequence of the PB1 reading frame. To assess if this method of PB1-F2 KO altered protein expression levels of either PB1 or PB1-N40 protein, we utilized a previously published method (Wise et al., 2011) of tagging the different reading frames from which the mRNAs are transcribed (Fig. 1a) . A plasmid was generated whereby the viral sequence, including the upstream non-coding region that the ribosome recognizes preceding the initiation codon for PB1, was cloned and two different constructs were generated in which GFP was placed in-frame at the C-terminus with either the PB1, PB1-N40 or in the +1 frame with the PB1-F2 message. Expression in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells and subsequent detection and densitometry quantification of the viral proteins expressed, indicated no alteration in the level of PB1 or PB1-N40 expression occurred when mutation of the +1 frame to KO PB1-F2 was introduced (Fig. 1b, c) .",

We detected sporadic shedding from the cloacal cavity of chickens inoculated with both the low and high viral doses of the WT and KO viruses and the number of birds shedding virus was lower in the KO (29 and 10 %, respectively) than the WT group (50 and 39 %, respectively) ( Table 2 ).",

Using both qRT-PCR for vRNA and infectious virus particle titration, we determined the relative levels of the WT and KO viruses in a panel of respiratory and gastrointestinal tract tissues at both day 2 and 5 post inoculation for the high-dose infection study (Fig. 5) . We found that in the respiratory tract (nasal turbinate, trachea and lungs) on day 2 there were no differences in either vRNA or infectious particle levels. The differences we observed in the respiratory tissues on day 5, higher levels of WT than KO virus in the nasal turbinate, were in line with the higher level of infectious particle shedding from the buccal cavity on day 5 by birds infected with the WT virus. In the gastrointestinal tract (oesophagus, duodenum, ileum and colon), we observed more virus in tissues from birds infected with the WT virus on both days 2 and 5 post inoculation, (Fig. 5) , however, the increase was only statistically significant in the colon tissue samples.",

Whilst we found no infectious virus in the food source, even at the peak of viral shedding, we were able to isolate infectious virus from the common water source in the isolators, for both viruses (Fig. 4c ). In the isolator that housed birds infected with WT virus, we detected virus from day 1 to 5 post inoculation; in contrast the KO virus was only detected on days 2-4 post inoculation, indicating that the presence of full-length PB1-F2 protein can lengthen the period of infectious environmental contamination for LPAI virus. PB1-F2 is believed to be a non-structural protein and several studies have failed to find it as a component of the influenza virus particle (Hutchinson et al., 2015; Shaw et al., 2008) . Therefore, it is unlikely that an absence of PB1-F2 would affect virus particle stability. However, we did assess WT and KO infectious virus persistence in water at 25 C (akin to the poultry isolator set up in which the in vivo experiments were conducted). No difference in stability of the infectious virus particles was seen (data not shown). There were also no HA sequence changes in samples of the viruses shed from both inoculated and in contact birds which also ruled out inherent stability differences between the viruses. The fact of increased environmental contamination has direct consequences for the efficiency of transmission to naive birds as the presence of PB1-F2 can lengthen the window of opportunity for naive birds to contract the virus from contaminated environmental sources, presumably through fomite/faecal-oral transmission routes.",

Transmission from directly inoculated chickens to in-contact birds at both early (24 h post inoculation) and later (5 days post inoculation) time points was assessed by the introduction of naive sentinels at these time points in separate experiments. Unsurprisingly, as no difference in buccal shedding between the WT and KO viruses was observed at early time points, naive sentinel animals that were introduced 24 h after the donor animals were directly inoculated, all became robustly infected independently of the virus to which they were exposed (Fig. 6a) . Infection in the sentinel animals was determined via titration of infectious virus in buccal and/ or cloacal swabs and seroconversion 14 days post exposure (Fig. 6 ). In these early exposure contact animals, we saw a similar pattern to directly inoculated birds of prolonged viral shedding from birds infected by the virus containing a full-length PB1-F2 protein in contrast to earlier clearance of virus in those infected by the PB1-F2 KO virus (Fig. 6a) . This To assess a more field-like environment experienced by the wild bird reservoir or poultry in a backyard flock, we introduced naive sentinel birds at 5 days post inoculation of the donor animals, when the disparity of buccal viral shedding in the donor birds was apparent. These birds were again cohoused and shared common water and food sources. The premise of this experimental setup was that in a free roaming environment birds can come into contact or share nourishment sources at any point during the viral infectious period since they are not strictly confined and their interactions are more transient. Therefore, initial contact at later time points during the infection period is important in the spreading of virus. We found that all birds in contact with those directly inoculated with a virus containing a fulllength PB1-F2 (WT) became robustly infected, shedding virus from both buccal and cloacal cavities (Fig. 6b) . In contrast, no viral shedding for any of the in-contact birds co-housed with those inoculated with the KO virus was detected (Fig. 6b) . Serology performed on the in-contact birds confirmed there was also no seroconversion 14 days after exposure (Fig. 6c) . This is the first time that the presence of a PB1-F2 protein has been demonstrated to affect transmission parameters in any species and suggests a scenario whereby it might be more favourable in an avian host for IAVs to encode for a full-length PB1-F2 protein.",

We found little variation in the frequency of full-length PB1-F2 in HPAI or LPAI viruses and a marginal reduction in HPAI (87.7 % HPAI vs 91.0 % LPAI) was entirely due to the H5 subtype (Table S3 ). An assessment of avian HA subtypes and fulllength PB1-F2 conservation found that H5 (90 %), H6 (88 %), H9 (81 %), H13 (88 %) and H16 (83 %) subtypes all had lower percentages of full-length PB1-F2.

We assessed viral infectivity, pathogenicity and transmissibility between chickens of isogenic viruses differing only by the presence of a full-length PB1-F2 protein. Two other published studies have undertaken a similar approach to understanding the role of PB1-F2 in the context of avian species infection with influenza viruses (Leymarie et al., 2014; Schmolke et al., 2011) . However, both focused solely on the effect that a full-length PB1-F2 protein has on the pathogenic nature on H5N1 viruses which were already highly pathogenic. The study by Schmolke et al. (2011) assessed the effect of knocking out the PB1-F2 protein on the pathogenicity of H5N1 in White Pekin ducks. No effect on pathogenicity was observed, but an increased systemic spread of the virus in the ducks was demonstrated for HPAI H5N1 virus containing a full-length PB1-F2 in contrast to when PB1-F2 expression was absent (Schmolke et al., 2011) . Leymaire et al. (2014) considered the effect of a full-length PB1-F2 on the pathogenicity of an HPAI H5N1 virus in the chicken model and in accordance with our findings presented here, found that removal of full-length PB1-F2 actually enhanced pathogenicity (when examined at doses at which WT virus is not 100 % lethal). This study also found increased viral tissue dissemination both in ovo of 10-dayold chicken embryonated eggs and in experimentally inoculated chickens when PB1-F2 protein was present (Leymarie et al., 2014) . Recently, another study that investigated the effect of PB1-F2 on transmission in turkeys concluded that lack of a full-length PB1-F2 gene in a triple-reassortant H3N2 swine influenza virus increased histopathology in turkeys and provided a transmission advantage (Deventhiran et al., 2015) . While the increase in pathogenicity when PB1-F2 is absent is in line with Leymaire et al. (2014) and our study the transmission advantage of a virus lacking PB1-F2 differed to our finding. Transmission in the Deventhiran et al. (2015) study was not robustly assessed and was determined on a single clinical sign (diarrhoea) and weak positive seroconversion; no virus was detected from any of the incontact birds. In addition, differences in the genetic history of the virus isolates studied, and/or inherent pathogenicity may account for these differences.",

In this setting it is rare for birds to be densely packed together for prolonged periods of time with birds transiently interacting or sharing resources, limiting the time and incidence of direct transmission between hosts. In these natural field conditions, poultry transmission of influenza viruses is thought to occur predominately through the faecal-oral route by ingestion of virus from contaminated food and water sources. It is therefore important that influenza virus is maintained in the environment for effective transmission to occur (Brown et al., 2007; Hinshaw et al., 1979) .

Increased cloacal shedding of the UDL01-WT virus in comparison to the UDL01-KO virus was detected which complemented the observation that more WT virus was present in gastrointestinal tissues of infected birds. In addition, buccal shedding of the virus was sustained for 1-2 more days from chickens infected with the virus containing full-length PB1-F2. The increase of both buccal and cloacal viral shedding in the WTinfected birds resulted in longer environmental contamination of the chicken's water source during these studies. The alteration of these parameters by the presence of a fulllength PB1-F2 resulted in transmission at a later time point (5 days post inoculation) for the UDL01-WT, whereas no transmission at this time point was observed for the UDL01-KO virus.",

Briefly, nucleotides 1-380 of UDL-1/08 PB1 were cloned into AgeI/KpnI sites of pEGFPN1 (Clontech). Using site-directed mutagenesis the position of the EGFP ORF was adjusted into frame with either the PB1 or PB1-F2 reading frames, while concurrently removing the GFP ATG codon. Additional segment 2 mutations as detailed in the results section were made using site directed mutagenesis with the WT segment plasmids as templates. 2 \u00b5g of each plasmid was transfected into HEK 293T cells using lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 12 h after transfection, 10 \u00b5M MG132 (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the medium for a further 12 h. Cells were harvested and the presence of alpha-tubulin and PB1-, PB1-N40-and PB1-F2-GFP was detected via Western blot using rabbit anti-alpha tubulin (Abcam) and mouse anti-GFP (Gene Tex) antibodies with IRDye 800CW/IRDye 680RD secondary antibodies (LI-COR) and visualized using the Odyssey CLx (Li-Cor). Densitometric analysis was performed using Image Studio software (Li-Cor) from three independent experiments and the intensities for PB1-, PB1-N40-and PB1-F2-GFP were normalized to alpha-tubulin. Fold change in protein expression relative to the WT was calculated. with 2 \u00b5g ml \u00c01 TPCK trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich). They were then incubated at 37 C for 72 h. Plaques were developed using crystal violet stain containing methanol. The limit of virus detection in the plaque assays was 6.67 p.f.u. ml \u00c01 .",

For species analysis, separate sequence sets were downloaded for human, swine and avian. The avian orders and specific subtypes were categorized from total avian sequences after download. For analysis of PB1-F2 by pathogenicity, matched full-length HA and PB1 sequences were downloaded. The sequence surrounding the cleavage site of HA was extracted, aligned and translated.
