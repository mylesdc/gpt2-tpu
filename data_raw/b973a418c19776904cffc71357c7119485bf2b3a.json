However, it is hard to predict the possible epidemic situations in practice. Luckily, in recent years, computational experiments based on artificial society appeared, providing a new approach to study the propagation of EVD and analyze the corresponding interventions. Therefore, the rationality of artificial society is the key to the accuracy and reliability of experiment results. Individuals' behaviors along with travel mode directly affect the propagation among individuals. Firstly, artificial Beijing is reconstructed based on geodemographics and machine learning is involved to optimize individuals' behaviors. Meanwhile, Ebola course model and propagation model are built, according to the parameters in West Africa. Subsequently, propagation mechanism of EVD is analyzed, epidemic scenario is predicted, and corresponding interventions are presented. Finally, by simulating the emergency responses of Chinese government, the conclusion is finally drawn that Ebola is impossible to outbreak in large scale in the city of Beijing.",

Supported by NSFC, National University of Defense Technology (NUDT) has established the platform of computational experiments [4] . Meanwhile, artificial Beijing is generated according to the geodemographics data [5] . Additionally, confirmatory experiments, such as the propagation of H1N1 pandemic influenza, have proved the validation of artificial Beijing [6] . However, it has also exposed some drawbacks. Fixed behavior mode especially restricts the heterogeneity and selfadaption of individuals. For example, contacts always occur among the minority and cannot simulate the actual sense of epidemic. Artificial Beijing is a dynamic system where individuals' behaviors are continually evolving. Therefore, multiagent learning is involved to optimize the behaviors and travelling mode. It endows individuals with the abilities to adapt to the virtual city according to previous knowledge and current situation.",

On the one hand, large scale individual-based simulation brings amazing overhead in computing and communication. Moreover, interventions will also directly bring extra-cost by replanning the schedules of individuals dynamically. On the other hand, it is hard Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience 3 to depict the activities of individuals, which is associated with the reasonability of artificial Beijing. Furthermore, it will affect the interactions among individuals, directly related to the accuracy and reliability of the prediction of Ebola epidemic. Therefore, two ways are outlined to optimize the performance: (1) improving parallel engine by introducing new technologies and algorithms and (2) optimizing the behaviors of individuals and the structure of artificial Beijing. In this section, detailed optimization on individuals' behaviors will be discussed, which not only decreases the computing consume, but also improves the reliability of the virtual city. In our study, behaviors schedules are replanned every day according to the history operation and current situation. As shown in Figure 2 , DayPattern and activities compose the skeleton of behaviors schedules. DayPattern is designed according to the social roles of individuals, which contains activity items, durations, and the travel patterns between two activities. For instance, the DayPattern of a student may consist of breakfast, study, lunch, rest, sport, dinner, entertainment, and sleep. Subsequently, detailed activities are specified according to Daypattern and current situation. Usually, each activity corresponds to a location ( ) and duration (\u0394 ), stored in the memory ( ) of computer. It is priority for an individual to take an activity in the memory and choose the predesigned location. However, an individual needs to replan its activities sometimes. Most of activities will especially be replanned under emergency situation. In addition, an individual just needs to choose another location for activities in case that the current location in the memory is unreachable.",

Once taking the strongest interventions at level 1, new infection cases will decrease in a short time.

Finally, it is rational to get the conclusion that it is impossible to bring the outbreak in large scale, though Ebola imported risk shall exist. 7.2. Discussion. This paper proposed a new method to study the disease propagation based on virtual city. The contributions of our work are outlined as follows. Firstly, artificial Beijing is generated based on demographics. Generally, some agent-based systems are always built based on simple rules, which cannot simulate the real activities of individuals. In our study, the distributions of population, environment, and social networks comply with the statistical features. Secondly, individuals' behaviors are optimized by machine learning. In our design, individuals are feasible to adjust their behaviors under special situation by replanning their schedules. Simultaneously, the optimization improves the computing performance, which involves large scale entities. Thirdly, Ebola's propagation process is simulated through the contacts among individuals. In our study, the course period and propagation characteristics of disease are two main factors in epidemic spreading. For any diseases, if we build their disease course model and propagation model, it is easy to simulate and analyze the process of epidemic spreading.",

On the one hand, it allows users to expand the attributes of existing entities to satisfy the requirement of experiments. On the other hand, we are able to cultivate the virtual society toward the desired direction and support the corresponding researches. For instance, it is necessary to cultivate the traveling mode of individuals to study personal evacuation under emergency situation. Naturally, the reliability of result mainly depends on the rationality of virtual society and the accuracy of domain models. Although solving these problems perfectly is difficult, it is still significant to build valid models and optimize the artificial society continually.

Although disease models are built according to the parameters in West Africa, the differences between them cannot be ignored.

For instance, many cases in Africa are infected by contacting the corpse of Ebola patients, while this funeral custom is nonexistent in China. (3) Four levels of response strategies cannot match well actual situations. The motivation is just to simulate and valuate the response interventions at different degrees, and it is hard to contain all possible factors. In addition, social costs of interventions are not considered in our design. (4) Some experimental parameters are not supported by data. For instance, contact frequency and infection probability are set by the rule of thumb. Although it is significant for predicting the epidemic situation, there is really no means in medical field.
