Herein, we identified a novel coronavirus, provisionally designated Rousettus bat coronavirus GCCDC1 (Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1), in the rectal swab samples of Rousettus leschenaulti bats by using pan-coronavirus RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing. Although the virus is similar to Rousettus bat coronavirus HKU9 (Ro-BatCoV HKU9) in genome characteristics, it is sufficiently distinct to be classified as a new species according to the criteria defined by the International Committee of Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). More striking was that Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 contained a unique gene integrated into the 3'-end of the genome that has no homologs in any known coronavirus, but which sequence and phylogeny analyses indicated most likely originated from the p10 gene of a bat orthoreovirus. Subgenomic mRNA and cellular-level observations demonstrated that the p10 gene is functional and induces the formation of cell syncytia. Therefore, here we report a putative heterologous inter-family recombination event between a single-stranded, positive-sense PLOS Pathogens |",

            "text": "The viral genomic sequences present in two coronavirus positive samples (numbers 346 and 356) were determined with next-generation sequencing (NGS). Analysis using a partial (816-bp fragment) sequence of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene indicated that the newly identified virus was likely to be a novel coronavirus according to previously proposed criteria [19] . Therefore, this virus was tentatively designated as Rousettus bat coronavirus GCCDC1 (Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1). Gaps within the genome of Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 were closed, and the complete genome sequence confirmed, using Sanger sequencing. Finally, the 5'and 3'-ends of Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 genome were obtained using 5' and 3' RACE (Fig 1) . Genome organization of Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1. Nonstructural genes and putative mature nonstructural proteins, structural genes, and 5'-and 3'-UTR are illustrated with yellow, dark blue and light blue colors, respectively. The remarkable p10 gene is shown in red. The potential origin of the p10 gene is indicated by a dotted arrow and a question mark. The leader sequence and leader transcription regulatory sequence (TRS) are directly shown with nucleobases. The bat, Rousettus leschenaulti, is used to show the host species that Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 was discovered. The schematic virion of coronavirus is used to show the virus that identified in the present study. The schematic virion of orthoreovirus and the segment S1 of the genome that it contains are used to demonstrate the possible origin of the p10 gene. Excluding the polyadenylated tail at the 3'-terminus, the genome of Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 was 30,129 nt in length with a G/C content of 45.4%. Comparative genomic sequence analysis indicated that Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 was most closely related to Ro-BatCoV HKU9 strains [18] with 66.6% -67.4% nucleotide identities. Similarly, Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 displayed equivalent genomic characteristics to Ro-BatCoV HKU9 except for an inserted gene at 3' end (discussed in detail in the next section). The major open reading frames (ORFs) had the identical order, namely 5'-replicase ORF1ab-spike (S)-NS3-envelope (E)-membrane (M)-nucleocapsid (N) followed by the accessory genes encoding nonstructural proteins (NSPs) (Fig 1 and Table 1) , although the N gene was truncated. Amino acid sequence analyses showed that the ORF1ab, S, NS3, E, M and N proteins of Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 shared higher identities with Ro-BatCoV HKU9 strains than those of other betacoronaviruses ( Table 1) . Also of note was that the 3'-end of Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 genome, just downstream of N gene, possessed a much more complicated structure than those of other members in the genus. Clearly, there were four NSP-encoding ORFs. According to the convention, the second-to-fourth ORFs were temporarily named NS7a, NS7b and NS7c, respectively, since they shared 29% -53% amino acid identities with the accessory genes of Ro-BatCoV HKU9 strains and other related bat coronaviruses (S1 Table) . Perhaps the most striking feature of Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 genome was the presence of a small intact ORF with 276 bases embedded between the N and NS7a genes. Although this ORF that had no homology to any known coronavirus, the encoded protein exhibited 30% -54.9% amino acid identity with the p10 protein encoded by the first ORF of segment S1 of avian and bat fusogenic orthoreoviruses [20] , which are double-stranded segmented RNA viruses belonging to the family Reoviridae. Therefore, this ORF was provisionally marked as p10 according to the molar weight of protein that it encodes (Fig 1) .",

Comprehensive information on the size and genomic locations of nsp1 to nsp16 and the putative cleavage sites of proteinases is presented in Table 2 . Previous studies indicated that the P1 position of 3CLpro specific cleavage site is exclusively occupied by a glutamine (Q) residue [22, 23] . However, nucleobase 12642 in the Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 genome was a T nucleotide, thereby changing glutamine (Q) to histidine (H). More interestingly, there were no glutamine codons in the sequence (from -273 to +192) around this site, as also observed in the corresponding site in the genomes of Ro-BatCoV HKU9. Therefore, the LH|AG region may represent a potential alternative cleavage site of 3CLpro to cleave between NSP9 and NSP10. A similar phenomenon may occur at the cleavage site between NSP10 and NSP12 of Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1, where the CAG codon has mutated to CAC causing the conversion of Q to H in amino acid sequence (Table 2) .",

Read mapping determined that there were a set of reads that covered the upstream junction site (i.e. the recombination break-point) between N and p10 genes, and a downstream junction site between the p10 and NS7a genes (S1 Fig with data in S1 File). In addition, the integrity and continuity of context sequence surrounding the p10 gene were confirmed with specific primers. Agarose gel electrophoresis showed that the PCR products were intact fragments of the expected length. The amplicons were cloned for sequencing. As shown in Fig 4A, the sequence obtained covers, without interruption, the partial N gene, the whole p10 gene and partial NS7a gene (data in the S2 File). Hence, there is clear evidence that the recombination event that placed the reovirus p10 gene in the Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 genome was genuine. Sequencing information confirmed that the TRS of p10 gene is located within the encoding sequence of N gene with the core sequence of 5'-ACAAAC-3' , which exhibited a single nucleobase difference to the consensus core sequence (5'-ACGAAC-3') ( Fig 4B) . We also observed a 97 nucleobase sequence between the TRS and the p10 initiation codon (Fig 4B) , which was much longer than the intervening sequences of other genes with the exception for that between the leader TRS and ORF1ab (Table 1) . As shown in Fig 4B and S2 Fig, sequence comparisons also revealed that the location of TRS in the p10 gene could be discriminated from those of other genes, which are adjacent and downstream to the N gene of Group D Betacoronavirus. Notably, the ORF of the Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 N gene was disrupted by the insertion of the \"exotic\" p10 gene, causing the truncation of eight amino acids at the 3'-terminus and a two amino acid deletion ( Fig 5) .",

On each lane the lowest band was cloned for sequencing, while other bands were purified and sequenced directly. Since the specific amplicon of the subgenomic mRNA NS7c failed to be cloned into the vectors, the PCR product was used as template for a second round of nested PCR. The product was then confirmed as shown in the lane of NS7c-2 in Fig 6C, and the band was cloned for sequencing. The results (Fig 6D and S3 Fig) indicated that the core sequence of the leader and body TRS of each gene, the leader-body fusion sites, and the mode of generation of subgenomic mRNAs were consistent with the prediction and demonstration in Fig 6B, especially the p10 gene and its subgenomic mRNA.

Therefore, an artificial plasmid was constructed containing the transcribed p10 subgenomic mRNA, which confirmed the functional expression of p10 (Fig 8C) . When the plasmid was transfected into BHK-21 cells, once again, cell syncytia were observed with Wright-Giemsa and immunofluorescence staining (Fig 8D and S4B Fig) .

According to the criteria defined by ICTV [1] , Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 is sufficiently divergent to represent a novel bat coronavirus. More striking was that Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 contains a p10 protein located at the 3'-end of the genome that appears to have captured from a bat-origin orthoreovirus by heterologous recombination. Homologous recombination events frequently occur during the viral RNA replication of coronaviruses, and are important for their evolution [10, [27] [28] [29] . However, it is also possible that coronaviruses are one of the few virus families that can experience heterologous recombination. For example, members of betacoronavirus group A possess an HE gene [30, 31] which was seemingly derived from ancestral influenza C virus, a negative-stranded RNA virus with a segmented genome [30, 31] , and which would represent another case of inter-family recombination, although it has also been proposed that the HE gene might be captured from host RNA [32] . Uncommon inter-family recombination events have also been reported in chicken infectious anemia virus [33] , bandicoot papillomatosis carcinomatosis virus type 1 [34] , and recombinant viruses between Marek's disease virus, fowlpox virus, and various avian retroviruses [35, 36] . In the current study, sequence, phylogenetic and functional analyses demonstrated that the p10 gene of Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 was likely derived from an ancestral orthoreovirus, although that it occupies a divergent position in the phylogeny suggests that the direct ancestor of the recombination event has yet to be sampled. Hence, these data provide clear evidence for Comparison of the p10 protein of Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 with those of avian and bat origin orthoreovirus. The absolutely, highly, moderately and non-conserved amino acids of p10 proteins as defined previously [26] , are illustrated with red, blue, green and black colors, respectively. The motifs and domains in the p10 molecule are represented as previously reported [26] .

            "text": "The biggest difference between fusogenic and nonfusogenic orthoreoviruses is the presence/ absence of a small protein encoded by the segment S1 of the genome, termed the fusion-associated small transmembrane (FAST) protein. The FAST proteins are the only known nonenveloped reovirus fusogens that can mediate cell-to-cell, but not virus-cell, membrane fusion to induce the formation of syncytia [20] , and which might promote the dissemination of virus among cells [37] . Thus, the FAST proteins are the pathogenic determinants of fusogenic orthoreoviruses. To date, the FAST family comprises six members including p10 proteins encoded by avian-and bat-origin orthoreoviruses, p13, p14 and p15 encoded by broome virus, reptilian reovirus and bush viper reovirus and baboon orthoreovirus respectively, and p16 and p22 encoded by aquareoviruses. Intriguingly, a specific p10 gene was identified in Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1, so that this is the first report of a FAST protein in an enveloped virus and hence could represent the seventh member of FAST family. Unfortunately, the isolation of Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 failed on cell culture in the present study, so it is difficult to determine the role of p10 gene during the life cycle of Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1. However, functional analysis showed that the coronavirus p10 gene could induce syncytium formation in the transfected cells, in the same manner as orthoreoviruses, which might be beneficial for cell-to-cell virus spread. It is therefore possible that the p10 protein enhances the transmission potential of Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1. Previous studies of the potential recombination between coronavirus and influenza C virus revealed the pivotal role of the shared HE gene for the pathogenesis of betacoronavirus group A [38] . Interestingly, human coronavirus HKU1, OC43 and bovine coronaviruses employ the HE protein to mediate receptor-destroying enzyme activity late in the infection cycle to facilitate viral progeny release and achieve efficient virus dissemination [39] .",

Thus, the recombination of the reovirus-originated p10 into the Ro-Bat-CoV GCCDC1 may enable the novel virus to disseminate and replicate rapidly in the host, in turn leading to severe infections. In recent years, several coronaviruses, notably SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, have caused severe pneumonia among humans [42, 43] . Because of the presence of human infected fusogenic orthoreoviruses such as Melaka virus (MelV) [44] , there is obviously some risk that cross-family recombination events such as that described here may generate a novel coronavirus with altered pathogenicity.

As NSP12 is a typical RNA polymerase and the core of replication-transcription complexes (RTC) and NSP10 usually serves as a molecular switch that can interact with multiple NSPs to form complexes, the replication ability of Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 might be suppressed by the decrease of release of these vital elements. It is also interesting to note that a similar situation may be observed at the NSP13/NSP14 cleavage sites of replicase polyprotein of human coronavirus HKU1 and human coronavirus NL63. Clearly, further investigation will need to focus on the isolation of the virus, construction of infectious clones, and the virulence and replication ability of Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 influenced by knockout of p10 gene and/or reverse mutation of cleavage sites.",

Under this situation, co-infections of single host cells-the necessary requisite for recombination-are possible. By careful sequence analysis we show that the heterologous recombination event placed the p10 gene in Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 is genuine. Previous studies showed the existence of p10-harboring orthoreoviruses in bat populations [40, [47] [48] [49] , such that co-infections with bat coronaviruses and hence recombination events are clearly possible. In addition, a previous study reported that mammalian orthoreovirus, a type of nonfusogenic orthoreovirus, was isolated from a SARS-CoV patient along during the in 2003 outbreak [50] . We believe that future studies should investigate co-infections in specific bat cell lines using a coronavirus similar to Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 or Ro-BatCoV HKU9 and the relevant orthoreoviruses, from which it will be possible to reveal more of the underlying basis of heterologous coronavirus recombination.",
