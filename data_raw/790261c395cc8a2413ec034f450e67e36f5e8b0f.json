In northern Kenya, under conditions of reduced rainfall and more frequent droughts, one response has been for pastoralists to focus increasingly on camel herding. Camels have started to be kept at higher altitudes and by people who rarely kept camels before. The development has been understood as a climate change adaptation strategy and as a means to improve climate resilience. Since 2003, development organizations have started to further the trend by distributing camels in the region. Up to now, little has been known about the nature of, reasons for, or ramifications of the increased reliance on camels. The paper addresses these questions and concludes that camels improve resilience in this dryland region, but only under certain climate change scenarios, and only for some groups.",

Pastoralists who historically depended on cattle have started to herd the one-humped camel (Camelus dromedarius). The shift has been seen as an adaptation to climate change, 'a means to build climate resilience' (Toulmin 2009 ), as camels can survive severe droughts and continue to contribute to household nutrition and economy in dry periods (Dahl and Hjort 1976; Wilson et al. 1990; H\u00fclsebusch and Kaufmann 2002) . It appears to be a success story, a locally driven initiative by people who are typically thought to be amongst the most vulnerable to climate change and to have 'low adaptive capacity' (Boko et al. 2007) . The initiative has also been taken up by development organizations, which have started to distribute camels that they view as 'the most resilient livestock.' 1 To date, little research has been carried out into the nature of this development, and our aim is to examine the processes by which a drought-resistant animal (camel) is being increasingly adopted by pastoralists, and the extent to which it fulfils claims of being a form of adaptation that improves resilience.",

The strong imperative to identify an appropriate 'adaptation pathway' 2 belies the complexity of defining what adaptation is, who should do it, whom it should be for, and what that adaptation should be to (Adger et al. 2009b; Conway 2009; Pelling 2011) . Adaptation operates in the context of multiple uncertainties and unknowns: we don't know exactly what the impact of global climate change at the local level is or will be, or how stresses associated with it will intersect with other dynamic processes operating across multiple scales (Vincent 2007) . Amidst this complexity, localised case studies have a lot to offer through their examination of 'the lived experiences of resourcedependent societies in the developing world in coping with climate variability' (Adger et al. 2003) . We explore processes taking place on Marsabit Mountain in northern Kenya. The case is not the first wave of interest in camels in the region, however: increasing numbers of camels were reported for Samburu in the 1980s (Sperling 1987) , and for Pokot in the 1950s and 1960s (Bollig 1992) . These historic cases provide some insights into the advantages and disadvantages of keeping camels, but the current case is different in that it is a response to opportunities and challenges that have emerged since the mid-1990s, and the way it is being heralded by policy-makers as an adaptation to climate change and a form of resilience is also new.",

Studies by Thornton et al. (2009) and by Toni and Holanda (2008) mention their importance given future climate change scenarios, but up to now few, if any, have examined their adoption as 'a means to build climate resilience' in practice. There is literature on herd diversification as a regular strategy used by pastoralists to spread risk, but this does not cover innovative forms of diversification to drought-resistant livestock (Dahl and Hjort 1976) . A further literature discusses diversification to non-pastoral livelihoods as a response to new opportunities and new pressures since the 1970s (Little et al. 2001a; McCabe et al. 2010 ), but again, there is little discussion of the new forms of pastoral diversification. We here address these issues.",

Climate change adaptation is seen as particularly important for pastoralists because of their high dependence on rain-fed natural resources. In debates about pastoralists and climate change adaptation, two key positions are evident (see also Robinson and Berkes 2010) . On the one hand, many contend that climate change will push already-stressed pastoralist systems into a state of collapse, leading to a vicious circle of poverty, environmental degradation and violence (see Catley et al. 2013 for review). On the other hand, other researchers argue that pastoralism has inherent flexibility and resilience: under future climate change scenarios it may have 'an important role to play where other livelihoods are likely to fail' (Nassef et al. 2009 ). In practice, there is widespread appreciation that the situation is more complex, but polarized views that either support pastoralism or try to find alternatives to it are still influential. By exploring the nature and reasons for practices on the ground, we contribute to a more nuanced account of pastoralist livelihoods and related climate change adaptation and policy.",

The concept of resilience, it has been argued, provides a useful way of thinking through some of the complexities of adaptation (Nelson et al. 2007) . Broadly conceived, resilience is understood as the ability to cope with the various and sometimes unexpected shocks and stresses of climate change, and as being at 'the core of adaptation' (Conway 2009 ). This approach is termed here the 'literal' approach as it builds on commonplace understandings of resilience that refer to a 'quality or fact of being able to recover quickly or easily from, or resist being affected by, a misfortune, shock, illness, etc.' 3 In relation to contemporary climate change policy, such literal understandings of resilience are a function of development: 'if people are better fed and in better health, and have better access to education, jobs and markets, then they will be more resilient to climate change' (Conway 2009) .",

Derived from the field of ecological modelling, this approach emphasises non-linear dynamics, surprises and uncertainty. Its characteristics suggest that it is highly suited to dryland pastoralist systems as they are characterised by non-equilibrium dynamics (McCabe 2004; Robinson and Berkes 2010) . A similar analysis is not presented here, however, as we concluded that the application of the resilience framework to the present case did not produce new insights. As others have found (Cannon and M\u00fcller-Mahn 2010; Hornborg 2013; Bollig 2014) , instead it tended to occlude uneven power relations that emerged as critical. For reasons of space these 'non-findings' cannot be presented here, and the current paper limits itself to an analysis of resilience in its literal sense.",

Breaking the monotony of the rocky dryland plains are isolated but significant regions of higher land, such as those around Marsabit Mountain, the Hurri Hills, and Mount Kulal (Fig. 1 ). These regions have higher rainfall: Marsabit weather station registers averages between 600 and 800 mm per year. The region is multi-ethnic, with Borana, Gabra, Rendille and Samburu being the key groups for this study. Somali groups such as the Adjuran, Degodia and Garre are found to the northeast and east of the area under discussion. All of these groups have historically depended on livestock for most or all of their livelihoods, and have practised varying degrees of mobile pastoralism (O'Leary 1994) . The Gabra, Rendille and Somali groups historically preferred camels, the Borana and Samburu, cattle (all also keep small stock). While cattle, sheep and goats have a very long presence in the region (c. 5000 years), there is some debate about when exactly camels arrived (some archaeologists suggest first millennium BC 6 ; others only AD 1300-1600 7 ). In oral traditions, specialized cattle and camel herding dates back to at least the sixteenth century and has been intertwined with conflicts and inter-group alliances (Schlee 1989) .",

In the 1950s, the British encouraged cultivation on Marsabit Mountain; in the 1960s and 1970s, missionaries resettled pastoralists who were destitute following droughts or conflict, and encouraged farming (Fratkin and Roth 2005) . In the decades that followed, pastoralists settled around towns and water points, attracted by access to food relief, services and town life, or 'pushed' by an inability to practise mobile pastoralism following livestock loss through drought, conflict or disease (ibid.). Little et al. (2001a) argued that diversification out of pastoralism has been pursued by relatively wealthy herders who chose to make use of new opportunities, and by poorer herders who were 'pushed' to diversify. Middle-wealth pastoralists were less likely to diversify, and, additionally, those who continued to practise mobile pastoralism exhibited lower levels of poverty (Little et al. 2008) . Diversification away from pastoralism in this region, they concluded, tended 'to generate low incomes and thus may actually increase risk during periods of stress' (Little et al. 2001a) .",

Camels 'feed on plants or parts of plants not eaten by more conventional livestock' (Wilson et al. 1990 ), such as dwarf shrubs and browse. Second, economically, livelihoods that depended on managing, rearing, selling and consuming cattle products have come to rely on camels. Third, culturally, many people who were taking up camels are Borana, who historically had cattle at the centre of their social and ritual worlds. It was often said that 'to be Borana is to have cattle.' One elderly man explained, 'the Borana think their cattle is their gutu [a rituallysignificant length of hair grown by Borana men]. If you have no cattle, you have no gutu.' 8 An elderly Borana woman described cattle as the Borana's 'umbilical cord,' highlighting a further sense of bodily connection. 9 In the past, some Borana owned camels, but these were a minority (interviews, see also Oba 2013) . Even in 2012, it was considered taboo for certain Borana clans to drink camel milk, eat camel meat or say the word 'camel,' instead using the phrase 'that long-necked thing.' 10 Fourth, politically, according to Schlee, cordial and mutually supportive relations between neighbouring ethnic groups such as the Borana and the Gabra were possible in the past because 'between the Gabbra (sic) and 6 Dahl and Hjort 1976; Rowley-Conwy 1988. 7 Gifford-Gonzalez and Hannotte 2013. Borana, there was little grazing competition\u2026 because at least the majority of the former specialized in camels and the latter in cattle ' (1989) . 11 A Borana move into camel keeping would disrupt this spatial specialization, and new competition might lead to conflict. In sum, while at first glance the question 'do camels deliver climate resilience' appears straightforward and primarily ecological, on closer inspection it is complex and related to multiple fundamental dimensions of life.",

Their questions suggested that there were new camel-based livelihoods on the mountain, and, in September/October 2012, the authors spent four weeks examining the extent and nature of these new camel-keeping practices. The first questions that drove the methods employed included: In what ways are these practices 'new'? Are they linked to particular areas on the mountain? How do they relate to use of land, water and other resources? What inputs do the practices require, and what are their benefits and challenges?",

In order to examine variation in camel-keeping practices across locations on the higher land, we made a circuit of the mountain (a distance of approximately 150 km) and carried out interviews in all the settled areas (defined as settlements above 800 m.a.s.l.). In addition, visits were made to lowland areas to compare camel-keeping practices on higher land with the longer-held lowland practices. Semi-structured interviews were the main methodology, as they allowed us to gain the trust of the interviewee and to obtain more in-depth information on history, motivations, forms of knowledge and management, experiences, successes and difficulties. A questionnaire had been designed for use, but in the early phases of the research we found that the information it generated was inaccurate and interviewees appeared uncomfortable with answering questions, particularly on herd sizes. 13 As extended periods were spent with particular households, some of whom were visited on more than one occasion, it was found that initial estimates of numbers of livestock often varied quite extensively from the number that came home in the evening to the livestock enclosure, or were related at later points in an interview. The semi-structured interviews employed a combination of open and closed questions. The open questions were pursued through a narrative approach that encouraged the interviewee to 'tell the story' of his/her family, of how he/she had obtained camels, or had managed to cope with recent challenges, such as drought events. This narrative approach generated rich material that placed the contemporary changes in context and enabled the interviewee to discuss processes more on their own terms. Closed questions were also included in the interview, and a checklist of questions was used that was derived from the questionnaire, in order to ensure certain information was collected when it had not been generated through the narrative approach. These included questions such as (in summary): Do you have camels? When/where did you get your first camel? What kind(s) is/are your camels? What other livelihoods do you practice? What did you do in the last (2011) drought? Have any of your camels died prematurely (why/how)? Further questions explored medicines and knowledge about treating camels, reproduction, milk sales, household economy, and matters related to culture such as bridewealth. Questions also compared cattle and camel pastoralism.",

We took care to include in our non-probabilistic interview sample a range of people: older and younger, male and female, richer and poorer, as well as members of different ethnic groups. We also interviewed key informants such as livestock professionals, veterinarians, and elders (male and female) who were experts in cultural matters (ibid.). In total, in addition to multiple informal conversations, 53 formal semi-structured interviews were carried out with 27 with camel-herding households (20 on the mountain, 7 in the lowlands), 26 others including cattle herders, borehole managers, knowledgeable elders, traders, and livestock professionals. Although some very basic quantitative data are presented, these figures remain illustrative and are not representative (Stratford and Bradshaw 2016) . The study is largely qualitative and reflects the interviewees' subjective understandings of camel-related developments as we understood and interpreted them. Although it is not representative, the case provides a reasonable but preliminary account of how some people are responding to challenges and the extent to which the shift to camels is a climate adaptation that improves resilience.",

The camels had mostly been purchased in Moyale and Wajir markets, and they were 'Somali' camels, a larger and more productive breed than the small and hardy camels of the lowland Gabra and Rendille (H\u00fclsebusch and Kaufmann 2002) . 18 The third group (n = 9), not referred to by our interviewee, included those who received a camel from one of three different organizations involved in distributing camels between 2003 and 2012 as part of a livelihood support programme. The first was the government Arid Lands Resource Management Project funded by the World Bank. According to the project manager, the decision to distribute camels followed requests by communities during participatory development planning meetings. 19 Field, pers. comm. interview 2012. 15 This does not mean it did not have an influence. 16 Interview 2012. 17 Fifteen people self-described as Borana, two as Gabra Malbe, two Rendille and one Garre. If the Garre, Rendille and Gabra Malbe households had had camels in the past, they had not kept camels for more than three decades. 18 The Gabra and Rendille rarely sell their camels. As a consequence, even if new camel keepers preferred their camels (and they did not express a preference), they were not often available. 19 Interview 2012. 20 All currency calculations are approximates and based on the rate of \u00a31 = 130 Shillings from September 2012. commented that, 'now all the communities are asking for camels.' 21 The second organization was the NGO Pastoralist Integrated Support Programme (PISP), which distributed approximately 300 camels on the mountain during a similar period, under the same arrangements with communities. The third organization was the Pastoralist Community Initiative and Development Assistance (PACIDA) that in 2012 carried out the largest distribution: 2075 camels were provided mostly to communities living in the lowlands. In this case, each recipient gave two or three sheep or goats in exchange for a camel. 22 The recipients we interviewed did not distinguish between these different organizations, and referred to all as 'project.' All the camels distributed were also of the 'Somali' type. Of the nine recipients interviewed in 2012, four still had only one camel; four had two camels as the 'project' camel they had received had given birth once; and one man had three camels, as the camel that he had received in 2009 had given birth twice.",

But for the pastoralists in northern Kenya, the beauty of the camels is that they do the two things: they are resistant to drought and they are profitable. As one local livestock expert explained, 'the camel is the animal for climate change and it is the animal for commerce'. 33 The notion of 'shifting' from cattle to camels is appropriate as it is difficult to herd cattle and camels together: they move at different paces, they require different vegetation, and sometimes they attack each other (Dahl and Hjort 1976) . But the shift was not always total: of the Borana who had bought camels, the majority still had cattle, although usually only a few. Of the 'project' beneficiaries, several Borana, Gabra and Garre also had a few cattle. The majority on the mountain from all groups was also involved in farming. The adoption of camels represented a form of diversification rather than a new initiative because farming and cattle had failed. True, farming has proved unreliable in recent years, and many cattle have died, especially in the 2009 and 2011 droughts, but not all were similarly adversely affected. On the Rendille side (to the south), many cattle were taken to areas around Maralal during the droughts. Many Borana took their cattle to the areas around Wajir, to Mega (in Ethiopia), to Elle Bor (near Forole), and to Chalbi. Although the Borana lost more cattle than the Rendille, if a household had sufficient resources to practise long-distance mobility, then a good portion of their livestock survived. For those who had bought camels at least, the diversification was not forced by a complete loss of cattle or agriculture-based livelihoods, but was a strategic innovation based on the perception that they are more profitable and more dependable in the current climate.",

Although the labour burden of milk marketing was high, the women we interviewed valued their related control over this income.

Individual households milked their camels differently, but the most productive milked once in the evening, once in the morning, and twice more in the night. For more on the labour requirements of camels, see Dahl and Hjort (1976) , Schlee (1989) , Sperling (1987) and Bollig (1992) . 35 Guyatu Arero, interview 2012. 36 Barako Guyo, interview 2012. Secondly, pastoralists have often been viewed as conservative, 37 and the cultural associations of Borana with cattle could be a reason why they might resist the adoption of camels, an identity marker of their ethnic neighbours. It has already been seen that most new camel keepers kept one or two cattle and some said that this was for ritual purposes: 'It's not like we have completely taken our feet out of cattle herding. For cultural purposes we keep some cattle.' 38 Others were more reticent, commenting 'You don't just adapt to the camel, you have to adapt to the whole culture,' 39 and 'the elders do not like it.' 40 But most went on to dismiss concerns about the cultural ramifications of the change, explaining that the new wealth acquired allowed a person to overcome any cultural difficulties. As one Borana man explained: 'if you need cattle for bridewealth or burial, you can just sell your camels and buy cattle'. 41 Finally, in terms of politics and inter-ethnic relations, we had hypothesized that the shift to camels would increase competition and potentially exacerbate conflict, which would certainly threaten any increase in resilience. However, our interviewees told us the opposite, stressing two points: in terms reminiscent of McCabe's (2004) book on neighbouring Turkana, Cattle Bring Us To Our Enemies, interviewees stressed that camels were better than cattle in relation to conflict with ethnic neighbours, because of their character:",

As one man explained: Similarly, the camels on the mountain required expensive medicinal inputs. The smaller Gabra and Rendille camels in the lowlands require few inputs (H\u00fclsebusch and Kaufmann 2002) . The water sources in lowlands are salty and contain important nutrients, and the camels are moved frequently to avoid ticks and other disease-carrying parasites. The 'Somali' camels on the mountain suffered from colds. Often camel enclosures were not moved and parasites thrived. Those whose camels were doing well were those who had the resources and the knowledge to purchase salt, insect repellents, de-wormers, vaccines, and medicines. One Rendille man estimated that he spent around 1000 Shillings a year on each of his camels, sometimes travelling to Meru (a round trip of more than 600 km) to purchase camel drugs.

It makes use of the proliferating fenced compounds in urban and peri-urban settlements on the mountain, which have increased at the expense of common grazing land for cattle. Without romanticising the past, it is possible to claim that historically, if a herder experienced difficulties there were multiple forms of non-monetary, kin-based, clan-based and inter-ethnic support that they could draw upon (Schlee 1989; Little et al. 2008) . Over recent decades, forms of inter-ethnic cooperation have declined (Schlee and Shongolo 2012) , and the advantages brought by diversification to camels have not fully replaced those older sources of resilience. The new camel economy is an individualized, commodified, market-based economy that depends on the vagaries of the market for animals, meat and milk. As such, it is an adaptation strategy that has the potential to expose herders to new market-based risks (O'Brien and Leichenko 2000) . The differential ability of individuals to participate in this new economy also suggests that, like neoliberal economies elsewhere, it may entrench higher levels of socioeconomic differentiation (Harvey 2007 ).",

They show that adaptation strategies do not have to be costly and 'painful' (Adger et al. 2009a: 2) .
