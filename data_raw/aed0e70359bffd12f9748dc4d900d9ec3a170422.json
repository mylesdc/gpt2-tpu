            "text": "Npl4 is likely to be the most upstream factor recognizing Lys48-linked polyubiquitylated substrates in the proteasomal degradation pathway in yeast. Along with Ufd1, Npl4 forms a heterodimer (UN), and functions as a cofactor for the Cdc48 ATPase. Here, we report the crystal structures of yeast Npl4 in complex with Lys48-linked diubiquitin and with the Npl4binding motif of Ufd1. The distal and proximal ubiquitin moieties of Lys48-linked diubiquitin primarily interact with the C-terminal helix and N-terminal loop of the Npl4 C-terminal domain (CTD), respectively. Mutational analysis suggests that the CTD contributes to linkage selectivity and initial binding of ubiquitin chains. Ufd1 occupies a hydrophobic groove of the Mpr1/Pad1 N-terminal (MPN) domain of Npl4, which corresponds to the catalytic groove of the MPN domain of JAB1/MPN/Mov34 metalloenzyme (JAMM)-family deubiquitylating enzyme. This study provides important structural insights into the polyubiquitin chain recognition by the Cdc48-UN complex and its assembly.",

Typically, the Cterminal glycine residue of Ub is covalently attached to lysine residues of substrate proteins. Ub itself is also a substrate for ubiquitylation, and forms a covalently linked Ub chain. The Ub chain linked via Lys48 (K48 chain) is the primary targeting signal for proteasomal degradation [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . Polyubiquitylated proteins in isolation can be direct targets of the proteasome, whereas those embedded into membranes or assembled into multisubunit complexes need to be extracted or segregated by the conserved AAA-family ATPase Cdc48 (yeast) or p97/VCP (metazoan) with the aid of its cofactor complex, Ufd1-Npl4 (UN), prior to the proteasomal degradation [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . The cellular function or localization of the Cdc48/p97 ATPase is controlled by many cofactors. The UN heterodimer is one of the best-characterized cofactors [12] [13] [14] [15] .",

In addition, relative rotations between the D1 and D2 rings occur upon binding of ATP to D2. Although understanding the mechanism of the substrate translocation accompanied with the Ub chain binding and ATP hydrolysis has been a long-standing problem, recent structural and functional studies provided important mechanistic insights into reacting steps of the Cdc48/p97-UN complex 22 .

The mammalian Npl4 (also known as NPLOC4) consists of a Ubx-like (UBXL) domain, zinc-finger domain (previously designated as zf-Npl4), Mpr1/Pad1 N-terminal (MPN) domain, C-terminal domain (CTD), and NZF domain. The mammalian Npl4 binds to Ub chains without linkage specificity through the NZF domain. On the other hand, yeast Npl4 lacks the NZF domain, and binds specifically to K48 chains via zf-Npl4-MPN-CTD 15, 23, 24 . The MPN domain of Npl4 topologically resembles the catalytic domain of the JAB1/MPN/Mov34 metalloenzyme (JAMM)-family deubiquitylating enzyme (DUB) 19 , which accommodates the C-terminal tail of Ub. Therefore, the groove corresponding to the catalytic site of JAMM DUBs 25, 26 has been proposed as a potential Ub-binding site of Npl4. However, a recent cryo-EM analysis of the substrate-engaged Cdc48-UN complex at 3.9 \u00c5 resolution has shown that the K48 chain on the substrate does not interact with the groove of yNpl4 MPN but with CTD and other regions of MPN 22 . Nevertheless, due to the low local resolution, the density for Ufd1 was not interpreted with the atomic model and the interaction between Npl4 and the two folded Ub moieties has not been characterized in detail 22 .",

The crystal structures reveal that the distal and proximal Ub (Ub dist and Ub prox , respectively) moieties of K48-Ub 2 interact with the C-terminal helix and N-terminal loop (N loop) of Npl4 CTD, respectively, and that Ufd1 binds to the groove of Npl4 corresponding to the catalytic groove of JAMM. In vitro and in vivo mutational analyses confirm that the Npl4 MPN groove is required for binding to Ufd1 but not to K48 chains. Also, Npl4 mutants that are designed to disrupt the Ub binding show that the interaction between the Npl4 C-terminal helix and Ub is critical for the Ub chain binding and stimulation of the ATPase activity of the Cdc48-UN complex. Moreover, we reveal that mutations on the proximal Ub-binding site of Npl4 affect its linkage-specificity. Our crystallographic and biochemical studies provide essentially important insights to understand the reaction mechanism of the Cdc48/p97-UN complex.",

The region containing residues 113-580 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Npl4 (yNpl4 113-580 , with the prefix \"y\" indicating Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteins) specifically recognizes K48 chains in vitro ( Fig. 1) 15 . The triple E123A K124A E125A mutation was introduced to reduce excess surface conformational entropy 27 . The yNpl4 113-580 (E123A K124A E125A) protein yielded high-quality crystals, and its structure was determined at 1.72 \u00c5 resolution by the single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) method using the zinc edge (Table 1) . We also attempted to crystallize yNpl4 113-580 in complex with K48 chains. Although K48-Ub 2 , K48-Ub 3 , K48-Ub 4 , and K48-Ub 5 were tested for crystallization of the complex, only K48-Ub 2 was successfully co-crystallized with yNpl4 113-580 . Eventually, we determined the crystal structure of yNpl4 113-580 in complex with selenomethionine (SeMet)-labeled K48-Ub 2 at 2.55 \u00c5 resolution ( Fig. 2a and Table 1 ). The structure was determined by the molecular replacement method using yNpl4 113-580 alone as the search model. Although molecular replacement using Ub (PDB 1UBQ [https://doi.org/10.2210/ pdb1ubq/pdb]) 28 as the search model was unsuccessful, we found residual electron density corresponding to K48-Ub 2 and manually built the model of K48-Ub 2 . The final model contains one yNpl4 113-580 -K48-Ub 2 complex and one isolated yNpl4 113-580 molecule in the asymmetric unit. We here note that the electron density of K48-Ub 2 is weak, especially of Ub prox ( Supplementary Fig. 1a) . The electron density of the yNpl4interacting part of Ub prox is observed, whereas the solvent exposed part of Ub prox is obscured ( Supplementary Fig. 1a, b) . To confirm the positions of Ub dist and Ub prox , we replaced Pro19 Val26 or Ile30 of Ub with SeMet and calculated the anomalous difference Fourier map in the yNpl4 113-580 -K48-Ub 2 complex ( Supplementary Fig. 1c ). Although some signals derived from SeMet were indistinguishable or not detected, we detected the signals derived from SeMet1, SeMet19, and SeMet26 of the Ub dist and SeMet1, SeMet26, and SeMet30 of the Ub prox .",

The yNpl4 MPN subdomain consists of the MPN core and two insertions, Ins-1 (residues 287-317) and Ins-2 (residues 403-462), similarly to other MPN DUBs. The Ub dist moiety contacts the CTD subdomain of yNpl4 with a buried surface area of 460 \u00c5 2 (Fig. 2b) . The Ub prox moiety contacts the CTD and MPN subdomains of yNpl4 with a buried surface area of 468 \u00c5 2 . Although the electron density corresponding to the C-terminal five residues (Arg-Leu-Arg-Gly-Gly) of Ub dist and the Lys48 side chain of Ub prox are invisible (Fig. 2c) , the C\u03b1-C\u03b1 distance between Leu71 of Ub dist and Lys48 of Ub prox (11 \u00c5) is within the range of those in the previously reported crystal structures of K48 chains in complex with their specific effectors (SARS PLpro 29 , AIRAPL 30 , and Mindy-1 31 ; 9-20 \u00c5). Furthermore, we examined the yNpl4-K48-Ub 2 crystals by SDS-PAGE ( Supplementary Fig. 1d ), and confirmed that the linkage of K48-Ub 2 was retained in the crystals. Therefore, we concluded that the isopeptide bond connects Ub dist and Ub prox in the present yNpl4-K48-Ub 2 structure. No large conformational difference was observed between yNpl4 113-580 alone and yNpl4 113-580 -K48-Ub 2 , except for the region comprising residues 290-300 in Ins-1, whose conformation is constrained by crystal packing (Supplementary Fig. 2a) .",

            "text": "The C-terminal helix of Npl4 plays a key role in Ub binding. Ub dist of K48-Ub 2 interacts primarily with the C-terminal helix of yNpl4 CTD (Fig. 2b ). Met574 and Ile575 form a hydrophobic surface to interact with the Ile44-centered hydrophobic patch of Ub dist . This hydrophobic interaction is further stabilized by hydrogen bonds between Thr571 of yNpl4 and the main-chain NH groups of Ala46 and Gly47 in Ub dist . Adjacent to the C-terminal helix-mediated interactions, Tyr501 and Ile538 of yNpl4 project into a hydrophobic pocket formed by Leu8, His68, and Val70 of Ub dist . To assess the roles of these interactions in the Ub chain recognition by Npl4, we examined the binding of the T571A, M574A, M574Q, and I575A mutants of yNpl4 to K48 chains by surface-plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy ( Table 2 ). The SPR analysis of mutant yNpl4 was performed using K48-Ub 4 because the affinity for K48-Ub 2 was too low to be analyzed. Longer Ub chains bind to their effectors with higher affinity in general 30, 32, 33 . The T571A mutation of yNpl4 113-580 decreased the affinity for K48-Ub 4 to 5.0% of the wild-type affinity ( Table 2 ). The I575A mutation of yNpl4 113-580 decreased the affinity to an unmeasurable level. The M574A mutation of yNpl4 113-580 had a weak effect and decreased the affinity for K48-Ub 4 to 43% of the wild-type affinity. On the other hand, The M574Q mutation had a greater effect than the M574A mutation, and decreased the affinity for K48-Ub 4 to 9.1% of the wild-type affinity. This is likely because the hydrophilic side chain of Gln inhibits the hydrophobic interaction between yNpl4 113-580 and Ub dist . We further analyzed the affinities between yNpl4 113-580 mutants and K63-or M1-Ub 4 . The T571A, M574A, M574Q, or I575A mutation decreased the affinity for K63-or M1-Ub 4 to an unmeasurable level (Table 2 ). These results suggest that the yNpl4-Ub dist interface primarily contributes to the affinity for Ub chains rather than the linkage specificity.",

The N loop of yNpl4 CTD interacts with the hydrophobic patch formed by Leu8, Ile44, and Val70 of Ub prox . Ser498 of yNpl4 forms a hydrogen bond with Arg42 of Ub prox . The main-chain CO group of Gln493 in yNpl4 forms a hydrogen bond with the main-chain NH group of Leu71 in Ub prox . The functional importance of these interactions was confirmed by SPR analyses using the A494F, S498L, and S498R mutants of His 6 -yNpl4 113-580 ( Table 2 ). The S498L mutation of yNpl4 had a little effect on the affinity for K48-, K63-, and M1-Ub 4 , whereas the S498R mutation of yNpl4 decreased the affinity for K48-Ub 4 to 36% of the wild-type affinity ( Table 2 ). These results suggest that the N loop of yNpl4 CTD is a binding site for Ub prox , although the contribution of the N loop to K48-Ub 4 binding is smaller than that of the C-terminal helix. Reflecting this, gaps are found in the interface between yNpl4 and Ub prox . One of the gaps is located between Ala494 of yNpl4 and Leu8 of Ub prox . The Phe replacement of Ala494 in yNpl4 increased the affinity of yNpl4 for K48-Ub 4 2.2-fold ( Table 2 ). It is likely that the bulky side chain of Phe filled the gap and increased the affinity. The involvement of the N loop of yNpl4 CTD in the Ub prox recognition was further supported by GST pulldown assays using the Cdc48-UN complex containing a GST-yNpl4 mutant: the A494F mutation of yNpl4 enhanced the binding between Cdc48-UN and K48 chains, whereas the S498R mutation decreased it (Fig. 2d ). Similar results were obtained even when the GST tag was fused to Ufd1 instead of Npl4 ( Supplementary  Fig. 3b) .",

To evaluate the coupling between the binding to a K48 chain and ATP hydrolysis in the Cdc48-UN complex, we analyzed the rate of the ATP hydrolysis by the Cdc48-UN complex containing mutant yNpl4. Addition of K48-Ub n -GFP increased the ATP hydrolysis rate of the Cdc48-UN complex, depending on the affinity of yNpl4 for K48 chains ( Fig. 2e and Supplementary Fig. 3e ). For instance, K48-Ub n -GFP increased the ATP hydrolysis rate of the Cdc48-UN complex approximately 5-fold. The T571A, M574Q, or I575A mutation at the yNpl4-Ub dist interface, which severely decreases the affinity for K48 chains, decreased the ATP hydrolysis rate. The S498R mutation at the yNpl4-Ub prox interface, which shows a mild effect on the affinity, also decreased the ATPase hydrolysis rate but less than the T571A, M574Q, or I575A mutation. These results indicate that the stimulation of the ATPase activity of the Cdc48-UN complex requires the binding activity of yNpl4 CTD to K48 chains.",

Indeed, fluorescence anisotropy-based affinity measurement using FlAsH-labeled yUfd1 288-305 showed that yUfd1 288-305 binds to yNpl4 with K d of 85.7 nM (Table 3) . To further reveal the structural basis of the interaction between Npl4 and Ufd1, we determined the crystal structure of yNpl4 113-580 (E123A K124A E125A) in complex with yUfd1 288-305 (Fig. 3a, b and Table 1 ).

Leu296, Phe326, Leu353, Met357, Phe419, Pro420, and Tyr424 of yNpl4 form a hydrophobic groove to accommodate Pro289, Leu292, Leu294, Gly297, Leu299, Phe301, Phe303, and Met305 of yUfd1. Mutations of all these residues except for Pro420 of yNpl4 and Pro289 of yUfd1 were examined by fluorescent anisotropy-based binding analysis (Table 3 ). The mutation of Leu296, Leu353, or Tyr424 of yNpl4 or Leu292, Gly297, Leu299, or Phe301 of yUfd1 severely affected the affinity between yUfd1 288-305 and yNpl4 113-580 . The Ala replacement of Leu292, Leu299, or Phe301 in yUfd1 288-305 decreased the affinity to 1.6, 0.68, or 0.41% of the wild-type affinity, respectively. The Leu, Arg, or Tyr replacement of Gly297 of yUfd1 288-305 decreased the affinity for yNpl4 113-580 to 14, 0.41, or 4.0% of the wild-type affinity, respectively. The backbone dihedral angles \u03c6 and \u03c8 of Gly297 are 90.1\u00b0and \u22128.5\u00b0, respectively. MolProbity 36 , a standard program for protein structure validation, judges these angles as favored angles for Gly but allowed angles for non-Gly/Pro residues. Gly is more favorable than non-Gly/Pro residues at residue 297. yUfd1 NBM is kinked at Gly297, thereby fitting into the hydrophobic groove in the MPN subdomain of yNpl4 (Fig. 3b) . Gly297 and Phe301 of yUfd1 are conserved from yeast to human, whereas Leu299 of yUfd1 is replaced by functionally equivalent hydrophobic residues among other eukaryotes (Fig. 3c) . Although the sequence of Ufd1 NBM is variable among eukaryotes, this Gx\u03a6xF motif (x and \u03a6 represent any amino acids and hydrophobic amino acids, respectively) is well conserved, reflecting its functional importance (Fig. 3c) . The Ala replacement of Leu296, Phe326, Leu353, or Tyr424 of yNpl4 113-580 decreased the affinity to 1.2, 33, 6.2, or 1.0% of the wild-type affinity, respectively (Table 3) . Notably, Leu296, Phe326, and Tyr424 of yNpl4 are conserved in hNpl4 ( Supplementary Fig. 4 ). Leu296 and Phe326 of yNpl4 interact with Leu299 and Phe301 of yUfd1, which occupy the third and fifth positions of the Gx\u03a6xF motif, and Tyr424 of yNpl4 hydrophobically interacts with the main-chain CO group of Ala290 and the C\u03b1 atom of Lys291 in yUfd1. These hydrophobic interactions are likely conserved from yeast to human. In addition to the hydrophobic interactions, Arg364 and Thr418 of yNpl4 form hydrogen bonds with Glu296 and the main-chain NH group of Ala290 in yUfd1, respectively. The E296A mutation of yUfd1 288-305 or the R364A mutation of yNpl4 113-580 decreased the affinity to 20% or 27% of the wild-type affinity, respectively (Table 3 ).

Npl4 is enzymatically inactive but has Ins-1 and a groove similar to the catalytic groove of JAMM-family DUBs 19 . Therefore, this groove and Ins-1 have been assumed to form a potential Ub chainbinding site. However, the present yNpl4 113-580 -yUfd1 288-305 structure reveals that the groove of the MPN domain accommodates yUfd1 NBM (Fig. 3d) . The Npl4-bound yUfd1 does not overlap with K48-Ub 2 in the yNpl4-K48-Ub 2 complex. Consistently, yUfd1 did not inhibit the binding of K48 chains to yNpl4 (Fig. 2d, Supplementary Fig. 3d ). In addition, the recently reported cryo-EM structure of the substrate-engaged Cdc48-UN showed that the bound K48 chain and Ufd1 do not overlap with Cdc48-UN assembly depends on the Ufd1-Npl4 interaction.",

In contrast, in the cells expressing the triple mutant of yNpl4 or yUfd1, we observed a substantial accumulation of Ub conjugates, which was comparable to that in the npl4-1 cell (Supplementary Fig. 5e ). Correspondingly, these triple mutant-expressing cells displayed a temperature-sensitive growth phenotype, although it was milder than the npl4-1 phenotype (Supplementary Fig. 5f ).

In mammalian Npl4, the NZF domain located in its C-terminus binds to K48 chains and Lys63-linked Ub chains (K63 chains). The human Npl4 (hNpl4) mutant lacking the NZF domain hardly binds to Ub chains 15 . On the other hand, the Ascomycota and Plantae Npl4 proteins lack the NZF domain in their C-termini (Supplementary Fig. 6a, b) . The Npl4 proteins from S. cerevisiae and C. thermophilum bind to K48 chains via the zf-Npl4-MPN-CTD domain 19 . Multiple amino-acid sequence alignment including yNpl4 and hNpl4 shows that the Ub dist -interacting residues in the C-terminal helix of the CTD are partially conserved between yeast and human; Thr571 of yNpl4 is conserved, and Ile575 of yNpl4 is replaced with Leu in hNpl4, which should be functionally equivalent to Ile (Supplementary Fig. 6a) . Intriguingly, the T551A mutation of hNpl4 (equivalent to Thr571 of yNpl4) decreased the affinity for K48-Ub 4 to 58% of the wild-type affinity ( Table 2) . On the other hand, Met574 of yNpl4 is replaced with Gln in hNpl4 and with Ala in S. pombe. The M574Q mutation of yNpl4 decreased the affinity for K48-Ub 4 to 9.1% of the wild-type affinity, whereas the M574A mutation decreased it to just 43% (Table 2) . Reciprocally, the Q554M mutation of hNpl4 (equivalent to Met574 of yNpl4) increased the affinity for K48-Ub 4 about two-fold ( Table 2 ). These findings suggest that the C-terminal helix of hNpl4 CTD is also involved in binding to a Ub chain like that of yNpl4 CTD.",

To assess the functional equivalence between yNpl4 CTD and hNpl4 NZF in the context of the Ub chain binding and the Cdc48 ATPase activity, we investigated engineered yNpl4 proteins, where the NZF domain of hNpl4 (including the linker region between the CTD and NZF domains) was fused to the C-terminal end of the full-length yNpl4 (yNpl4-NZF) with or without mutations deficient in binding to Ub chains (T571A or I575A). GST pulldown analysis showed that yNpl4-NZF bound to both K48 and K63 chains, even with the T571A or I575A mutation, indicating that the NZF fusion can rescue the defect of Ub chain binding of the CTD mutations (Fig. 4a, b and Supplementary  Fig. 6c ). Next, we analyzed whether the yNpl4-NZF proteins support the K48 chain-dependent ATPase activity of the Cdc48 complex ( Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 6d) . The NZF fusion to wild-type yNpl4 did not enhance the ATPase activity above the wild-type level, probably because the affinity of wild-type yNpl4 for K48 chains is sufficient to stimulate the full ATPase activity of Cdc48. On the other hand, the NZF fusion completely recovered the decrease in the ATPase stimulation by the T571A or I575A mutation, suggesting that yNpl4 CTD and hNpl4 NZF are functionally equivalent. This also raises the possibility that the enhancement of ATP hydrolysis is independent of Lys48-linkage specificity. However, K63 chains did not stimulate the ATPase activity of the Cdc48-UN complex containing yNpl4-NZF, which can bind to K63 chains as well as to K48 chains (Fig. 4c) . Thus, the stimulation of the ATPase activity of the Cdc48-UN complex actually depends on Lys48-linkage specificity of yNpl4. Considering that Lys48-linkage specificity of yNpl4 CTD is dispensable for the stimulation of the ATP hydrolysis, one may expect that yNpl4, yUfd1, and/or Cdc48 have additional Lys48linkage-specific recognition site(s) besides Npl4 CTD. The cryo-EM structure of the substrate-engaged Cdc48-UN has shown that yNpl4 MPN binds to unfolded Ub, which bridges between Ub prox and the central pore of Cdc48 22 (Supplementary Fig. 6e ). This binding may be related to the K48 chain-specific stimulation of the ATPase activity of Cdc48.",

Among the previously reported Ub-binding domains (UBDs), Ub-interacting motif (UIM), motif interacting with Ub (MIU), and UIM and MIU related UBD (UMI) have a single helix as a Ub-binding site. yNpl4 CTD, MIU, and UMI but not UIM exhibit the same helix orientation relative to the bound Ub. Therefore, we compared the Ub-binding helices of yNpl4 CTD, RNF168 UMI (PDB 5XIS [https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb5xis/pdb]) 38 , and Rabex5 MIU (PDB 2C7N [https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb2c7n/ pdb]) 39 (Fig. 5b) . These UBDs have an N-terminal hydrophilic residue for hydrogen bonding with the NH groups of Ala46 and Gly47 of Ub, and a central hydrophobic residue for the interaction with the hydrophobic pocket formed by Leu8, Ile44 and Val70 of Ub (Fig. 5b, c) . The differences of the N-terminal hydrophilic residue and central hydrophobic residue in the Ub-binding helix affect its orientation relative to Ub. The central hydrophobic residues are Ile in Npl4 CTD and UMI and Ala in MIU. The longer side chain of Ile in yNpl4 CTD or UMI pushes out the C-terminal end of the helical UBD, whereas those N-terminal hydrophilic residues move close proximity to the NH groups of Ala46 and Gly47 of Ub. 39 .

The cryo-EM structure of the substrate-engaged Cdc48-UN 22 contains two folded Ub moieties, which correspond to Ub dist and Ub prox in the present crystal structure of yNpl4 113-580 -K48-Ub 2 (Fig. 6a) . In both structures, the C-terminal helix of yNpl4 CTD interacts with the Ile44-centered hydrophobic patch of Ub dist (Fig. 6b) , and therefore, the Ub dist recognition mode of yNpl4 is essentially the same. On the other hand, the Ub prox recognition mode is different. In the yNpl4-K48-Ub 2 structure, Ser498 of yNpl4 forms a hydrogen bond with Arg42 of Ub prox . GST pulldown and SPR analysis of the S498R mutant of yNpl4 showed that Ser498 of yNpl4 is actually involved in binding to K48 chains (Fig. 2d, Supplementary Fig. 3b and Table 2 ). In the structure of the substrate-engaged Cdc48-UN, Ub prox moves toward Cdc48 by~10 \u00c5, as compared with yNpl4-K48-Ub 2 , and does not interact with Ser498 of yNpl4 (Fig. 6b) . This Ub prox movement appears to be coupled with threading of the unfolded Ub moiety; i.e., Ub prox interacts with Ser498 of yNpl4 at the initial Ub chain recognition step. At the subsequent substrate-threading step, the unfolded Ub is inserted into the central pore of Cdc48, and pulls Ub prox , which loses its interaction with Ser498 of yNpl4.",

Because the p97/Cdc48-UN complex plays crucial roles upstream of the proteasome, its inhibition has emerged as a novel therapeutic target in cancer cells 41 . However, since p97/Cdc48 also plays various roles outside the UPS pathway, its inhibition may affect many cell functions. In the context, disruptions of the specific p97-cofactor association will likely lead to the novel p97 inhibitors with enhanced specificity of anticancer activity. Inhibition of the interaction between Ufd1 and Npl4 prevents formation of the Cdc48-UN complex (Fig. 3f) . Our present structure of yNpl4 113-580 -yUfd1 288-305 might facilitate the development of such anticancer drugs by serving as a useful platform for structure-based design.",

The atomic models were corrected using Coot 47 with careful inspection. Refinement was carried out using Phenix with iterative correction and refinement of the atomic models.
