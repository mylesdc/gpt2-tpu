            "text": "Coronavirus HKU15 is a deltacoronavirus that was discovered in fecal samples of pigs in Hong Kong in 2012. Over the past three years, Coronavirus HKU15 has been widely detected in pigs in East/Southeast Asia and North America and has been associated with fatal outbreaks. In all such epidemiological studies, the virus was generally only detected in fecal/intestinal samples. In this molecular epidemiology study, we detected Coronavirus HKU15 in 9.6% of the nasopharyngeal samples obtained from 249 pigs in Hong Kong. Samples that tested positive were mostly collected during winter. Complete genome sequencing of the Coronavirus HKU15 in two nasopharyngeal samples revealed quasispecies in one of the samples. Two of the polymorphic sites involved indels, but the other two involved transition substitutions. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the two nasopharyngeal strains in the present study were most closely related to the strains PDCoV/CHJXNI2/2015 from Jiangxi, China, and CH/Sichuan/S27/2012 from Sichuan, China. The outbreak strains in the United States possessed highly similar genome sequences and were clustered monophyletically, whereas the Asian strains were more diverse and paraphyletic. The detection of Coronavirus HKU15 in respiratory tracts of pigs implies that in addition to enteric infections, Coronavirus HKU15 may be able to cause respiratory infections in pigs and that in addition to fecal-oral transmission, the virus could possibly spread through the respiratory route. The presence of the virus in respiratory samples provides an alternative clinical sample to confirm the diagnosis of Coronavirus HKU15 infection. Quasispecies were unprecedentedly observed in the 5\u2032-untranslated region of coronavirus genomes.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) are found in a wide variety of animals, in which they can lead to enteric, hepatic, neurological and respiratory illnesses of differing severity. On the basis of genotypic and serological characterization, CoVs were traditionally divided into three distinct groups. In 2009, the Coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee for Taxonomy of Viruses replaced the traditional CoV groups 1, 2 and 3 with three genera, Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus and Gammacoronavirus, respectively. 1 In the same year, we discovered three novel CoVs in avian cloacal swabs. 2 These CoVs formed a distinct novel CoV genus, named Deltacoronavirus. 1 Subsequently, in a large epidemiological study, we discovered seven additional deltacoronaviruses. 3 Interestingly, one of these deltacoronaviruses, which was originally named porcine CoV HKU15, was found in fecal samples of pigs in Hong Kong, and it is the only mammalian deltacoronavirus. 3 In 2016, the Coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee for Taxonomy of Viruses rectified the species name for this virus to Coronavirus HKU15. 4 Over the past three years, Coronavirus HKU15 has been widely detected in pigs in East/Southeast Asia and North America and was found to be associated with fatal outbreaks. [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] In these epidemiological studies, Coronavirus HKU15 was generally only detected in fecal/intestinal samples. However, some CoVs, such as transmissible gastroenteritis CoV (TGEV)/porcine respiratory CoV (PRCV) of Alphacoronavirus 1 and bovine CoV of Betacoronavirus 1, could be detected consistently in both fecal and respiratory samples. 24, 25 Therefore, we hypothesized that Coronavirus HKU15 may also be present in respiratory samples of pigs, which has implications for its transmission and potential role in respiratory diseases and for the use of nasopharyngeal sampling as an alternative method of identifying infected pigs. To test this hypothesis, we performed a molecular epidemiology study on nasopharyngeal samples collected from pigs in Hong Kong. Two complete genomes of the 'respiratory' Coronavirus HKU15 were sequenced, and comparative genomic and phylogenetic studies were performed. The implications of the presence of Coronavirus HKU15 in respiratory samples are also discussed.",

Briefly, viral RNAs were converted to cDNAs using SuperScript III reverse transcriptase with a combined random priming and oligo(dT) priming strategy. The cDNAs were PCR-amplified by primers (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2) that were designed by multiple alignment of the genome sequences of other Coronavirus HKU15 strains with complete genomes available or from the results of the first and subsequent rounds of PCR-sequencing. PCRs were performed using the iProof High-Fidelity PCR kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol, and DNA sequencing was performed as mentioned above. When ambiguous peaks were observed consistently in the electropherograms after several attempts of PCR-sequencing for certain genomic regions, cloning followed by plasmid sequencing was performed according to our previous publication, 28 except the Zero Blunt TOPO PCR Cloning kit (Invitrogen) was used to resolve the sequence ambiguities. PCRs using recombinant plasmids as templates were also performed to confirm that indels at mononucleotide polymeric regions were not the result of polymerase slippage. The 5\u2032 ends of the viral genomes were amplified and sequenced by the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) using the SMARTer RACE 5\u2032/3\u2032 kit (Clontech Laboratories, Mountain View, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol with the reverse primers LPW15379 (5\u2032-TGG GTA ATG TGT CCG CTG ACG GGC GGT G-3\u2032), LPW15380 (5\u2032-AGA AGT GGT GGA TGG TCA GAG GAA CGG T-3\u2032) and LPW16265 (5\u2032-GTG GCT GGT TTC CAG GTA ATC TA-3\u2032). The sequences of the PCR products were then assembled manually to obtain the genomes of the two nasopharyngeal strains.",

Post-cloning DNA sequencing revealed that there were six sequence variants, with four polymorphic sites, for this genomic region ( Figure 2) . Two of the polymorphic sites, located at the 189th and 376th nucleotide positions, involved indels (\u0394T and \u0394A/C, respectively), whereas the other two polymorphic sites, located at the 292nd and 296th nucleotide positions, involved transition substitutions (T \u2192 C and G \u2192 A, respectively).

This is similar to the pattern of seasonal variation in a surveillance study carried out in the United States, where the detection rate for Coronavirus HKU15 was much lower during summer. 19 It has recently been confirmed that Coronavirus HKU15 is able to cause swine enteric infections by infecting gnotobiotic and conventional pigs with Coronavirus HKU15. 15 The detection of Coronavirus HKU15 in respiratory tracts of pigs has the following implications.",

            "text": "From the data of the present study, both the 'enteric' and 'respiratory' Coronavirus HKU15 may possess similar properties. A number of animal CoVs possess dual or multiple tissue tropisms. For example, TGEV, which is another enteropathogenic CoV that infects pigs, could also be found in the nasopharynx of pigs as PRCV, which is a deletion mutant of TGEV. 25 Moreover, bovine CoV is both an enteric and a respiratory pathogen in cattle. 24 Similar to TGEV/ PRCV, Coronavirus HKU15 is recovered from both respiratory and gastrointestinal samples. However, unlike TGEV/PRCV, in which there is a 621-681 nucleotide deletion at the 5\u2032 end of the spike (S) gene leading to a loss of 1-2 antigenic sites in PRCV, 34 comparative genome analysis of Coronavirus HKU15 from respiratory and fecal samples did not show any obvious difference in their S proteins or other parts of their genomes. Phylogenetic analysis also did not reveal a separate clustering of fecal/intestinal and nasopharyngeal isolates ( Figure 2 ). Further cell culture experiments are required to confirm whether all strains of this species possess intrinsic tropism to both enteric and respiratory tissues. This is also the first report of CoV quasispecies in the 5\u2032untranslated region (UTR). In one (S579N) of the two Coronavirus HKU15 genomes that we sequenced in this study, variant sites were observed at four positions; two of them were due to nucleotide substitutions, and the other two were results of indels at mononucleotide polymeric regions (189th and 376th bases). These two indels were genuine variant sites instead of being due to polymerase slippage during the amplification process because recombinant plasmiddependent PCR-sequencing no longer resulted in sequence ambiguities in the electropherograms. Although the existence of quasispecies has been reported in CoVs, the variant sites were found in coding regions or 3\u2032-UTR. [35] [36] [37] [38] In the case of severe acute respiratory syndromerelated coronavirus, all of the variant sites observed in the quasispecies were located at the S gene. 35 For bovine CoV, one of the two strains with naturally occurring intra-isolate quasispecies had all seven variant sites located at ORF1a, whereas for the other strain with naturally occurring intra-isolate quasispecies, there were 85 polymorphic sites scattered across ORF1a (n = 28), ORF1b (n = 19), 32 kDa-non-structural protein (NSP) gene (n = 6), hemagglutinin esterase (HE) gene (n = 2), S gene (n = 18), 4.9 kDa-NSP gene (n = 2), 4.8 kDa-NSP gene (n = 2), membrane (M) gene (n = 2), nucleocapsid (N) gene (n = 5) and 3\u2032-UTR (n = 1). 36 Similar to bovine CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus also possessed all the intra-host single nucleotide variations throughout its genome except the 5\u2032-UTR. 37, 38 In this study, all four variant sites (189 \u0394T, 292 T \u2192 C, 296 G \u2192 A and 376 \u0394A/C) were present in the 5\u2032-UTR and were not located in the leader sequence or the transcription regulatory sequence. We speculate that the existence of quasispecies in CoVs may play a role in CoV evolution, in addition to the more well-known high-recombination and mutation rates in CoV genomes. 39 ",

The two nasopharyngeal strains S579N and S582N in the present study were most closely related to strains PDCoV/CHJXNI2/2015 from Jiangxi, China and CH/Sichuan/S27/2012 from Sichuan, China (Figure 3and SupplementaryFigure S2). Similar to other Chinese and Hong Kong strains (except CHN-AH-2004 and HKU15-44) and a Thai strain (P23_15_TT_1115), there was a deletion of an asparagine residue of the asparagine trimer located at the 50th-52nd amino-acid positions in the S protein compared with the other strains from South Korea, Laos and United States and to two other strains from Thailand. The deletion of this codon has been proposed as a genetic marker for the differentiation of China and Hong Kong strains from US and South Korean strains.12",
