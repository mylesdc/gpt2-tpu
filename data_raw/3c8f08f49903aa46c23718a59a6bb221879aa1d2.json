            "text": "Human coronavirus (HCoV) NL63 was first described in 2004 and is associated with respiratory tract disease of varying severity. At the genetic and structural level, HCoV-NL63 is similar to other members of the Coronavirinae subfamily, especially human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E). Detailed analysis, however, reveals several unique features of the pathogen. The coronaviral nucleocapsid protein is abundantly present in infected cells. It is a multi-domain, multi-functional protein important for viral replication and a number of cellular processes. The aim of the present study was to characterize the HCoV-NL63 nucleocapsid protein. Biochemical analyses revealed that the protein shares characteristics with homologous proteins encoded in other coronaviral genomes, with the N-terminal domain responsible for nucleic acid binding and the C-terminal domain involved in protein oligomerization. Surprisingly, analysis of the subcellular localization of the N protein of HCoV-NL63 revealed that, differently than homologous proteins from other coronaviral species except for SARS-CoV, it is not present in the nucleus of infected or transfected cells. Furthermore, no significant alteration in cell cycle progression in cells expressing the protein was observed. This is in stark contrast with results obtained for other coronaviruses, except for the SARS-CoV.",

A written informed consent was obtained from all patients (2 adult patients). Primary cells detached from human bronchi and trachea with pronase E were expanded on collagen-coated (collagen type IV, Sigma-Aldrich) plastic in bronchial epithelial growth media (BEGM) to generate passage 1 cells and plated at density of 3\u00d710 5 cells per well on permeable Transwell supports (6.5-mmdiameter; Corning Transwell-Clear) in BEGM. Cells were cultured at 37\u00b0C in presence of 5% CO 2 until confluence. Human airway epithelium (HAE) cultures were generated by changing the media to Air Liquid Interface media (ALI) and provision of an air-liquid interface for 6 to 8 weeks to form well-differentiated, polarized cultures that resemble the in vivo structure of pseudostratified mucociliary epithelium.

NTD and CTD were purified to homogeneity whereas the full length N-protein was purified to about 80% homogeneity as demonstrated by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1) . The identity of purified proteins was confirmed with mass spectrometry (data not shown). We next used differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to examine thermal stability of the proteins. The DSC curves for the first heating scans obtained for NL63-N, the CTD, and the NTD are shown in Fig. 2 . NL63-N underwent irreversible denaturation and showed a broad transition curve. The denaturation temperature was estimated at 45.7\u00b0C, with an enthalpy change of approximately 80 kcal/mol ( Table 2 ). However, due to low signal to noise ratio the resulting baseline was variable and these values can only be treated as rough estimates. Nevertheless, the low enthalpy value suggests that NL63-N protein is relatively unstable. Unfolding of the NTD was irreversible and accompanied by protein aggregation (indicated by the exotherm present in the high temperature region of the DSC curve). The transition temperature was 45\u00b0C and the \u0394H cal was 104.4 kcal/mol. Surprisingly, thermal transition of the CTD was fully reversible, showing T t of 55.7\u00b0C, a \u0394H cal of 143.6 kcal/mol, and a \u0394S cal of 0.44 kcal/ Kmol. Thermal transition of the CTD was cooperative, with a van't Hoff enthalpy/calorimetric enthalpy ratio (\u0394H van'Hoff / \u0394H cal ) of 1.03.",

To test whether the observed lack of nuclear localization of NL63-N does not result from insufficient nuclear staining, 293T cells were also transfected with pmaxFP-Green-N/NL63-N plasmid. LLC-MK2 cells were transfected with maxFP-Green/NL63-N encoding mRNA due to poor transfection efficiency using conventional DNA delivery methods. MaxFP-Green protein was used as a control.

Both the NTD and the complete N protein are unstable, as shown by the broad, irreversible DSC curves and obtained thermal parameters values: T m below 50\u00b0C and low \u0394H value for complete N protein. In general, \u0394H represents the energy amount of non-covalent bonds occurring within native protein. This is HCoV-NL63 N Protein consistent with our finding that the N protein rapidly degrades in aqueous solutions (data not shown). Obtained results are consistent with previous reports [55, 66, 67] . However, the CTD was surprisingly stable; no protein aggregation was observed upon heating and thermal denaturation was fully reversible, moreover judging from \u0394H(T m )/ \u0394H vH ratio it undergoes cooperative transition. Thermodynamic protein stability is defined as the Gibbs energy difference between the denatured and native states but, for some practical purposes, the denaturation temperature, T m (where \u0394G = 0 for two-state reversible transition) may be more useful to measure the protein stability. Irreversibility is a common feature of DSC measurements when the large, multidomain proteins are considered. Irreversibility limits the use of a standard equilibrium thermodynamic analysis. For such a process, the denaturation temperature measured in DSC experiment is significantly lower than that corresponding to \u0394G = 0. In these cases, the T m (so called operational thermal stability) is kinetically controlled. The simplest model of irreversible unfolding can be described in the terms of kinetic analysis (rate equations) according to general Lumry-Erying scheme:",

Therefore, D represents a modified denatured state existing in a quasi-two-state equilibrium with the native state [68, 69] . In fact, for irreversible denaturation the enthalpy and T m become only apparent values since both parameters are dependent on the scan rate. The existence of the exotherm on the downhill part of endotherm DSC peak is the obvious evidence for the presence of association-aggregation processes-the most common reason of the protein unfolding irreversibility. Lower stability of NTD and the complete N protein in comparison to CTD could be attributed to the distinct structural flexibility of these proteins. In turn, higher flexibility allows NTD to bind the nucleic acids which has obvious biological relevance for NTD and complete N protein function.",

However, previous studies show that coronaviral N protein has a higher affinity for the viral RNA than non-viral nucleic acids and that only nucleoproteins with coronaviral genomic RNA are efficiently incorporated into new virions [51, [70] [71] [72] . Observed limited binding of the nucleic acids by the complete N protein (data not shown) hypothetically resulted from interaction between the NTD and CTD. However, rapid N-protein degradation at the conditions of the experiment did not allow us to obtain conclusive answer.

The crystal structures of the SARS-CoV, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-N CTDs revealed that all those domains are characterized by a similar polypeptide fold and are dimeric, strongly suggesting that the dimeric N protein is the unit that functions in vivo [56, 57] . Furthermore, Tang et al. compared the N proteins from SARS-CoV and HCoV-229E [55] demonstrating that they formed oligomers and bound to nucleic acids. Moreover, Lo et al. showed that oligomerization of the 229E-N protein is most likely also mediated by the CTD [57] . Here we show that the complete NL63-N protein and the CTD can self-associate to form dimers and higher order oligomers. The role of aforementioned N-N interaction is, however, debatable, as NL63-N strongly binds nucleic acids during formation of the ribonucleocapsid. It is therefore possible that this interaction may be important for stabilizing and shaping the ribonucleocapsid; however, it may also be important for other N-mediated processes [73] .",

For example, the IBV virus carries two very similar putative NLS signals: pat4 RPKK [aa 359-362] and pat7 PKKEKKL [aa 360-366]. One may, therefore, expect that the NL63-N protein would also localize to the nucleus.

To address this problem, we used a vector encoding maxFP-Green-N/NL63-N fusion protein, but found no difference in the subcellular localization of the fusion protein and the native protein [60, 76, 77] .
