Iota-carrageenan has previously shown antiviral effectiveness against cold viruses in clinical trials. This study investigated the efficacy of a carrageenan-containing nasal spray on the duration of the common cold and nasal fluid viral load in adult patients. Methods: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 211 patients suffering from early symptoms of the common cold were treated for seven days. Application was performed three times daily with either a carrageenan-supplemented nasal spray or saline solution as placebo with an overall observation period of 21 days. The primary endpoint was the duration of disease defined as the time until the last day with symptoms followed by all other days in the study period without symptoms. During the study, but prior unblinding, the definition of disease duration was adapted from the original protocol that defines disease duration as the time period of symptoms followed by 48 hours without symptoms.",

The primary endpoint that had been prespecified but was changed before unblinding was not met. Viral titers in nasal fluids showed a significantly greater decrease in carrageenan patients in the intention-to-treat population (p = 0.024) and in the per protocol population (p = 0.018) between days 1 and 3/4. Conclusions: In adults with common cold virus infections, direct local administration of carrageenan with nasal sprays reduced the duration of cold symptoms. A significant reduction of viral load in the nasal wash fluids of patients confirmed similar findings from earlier trials in children and adults.

Thus, carrageenan interferes with the virus life cycle at a very early stage due to a physical mechanism of action. Studies in vitro and in vivo have shown the effectiveness of carrageenan against several viruses such as hRV [27] , influenza A [26] and RSV.

Patients were excluded from the PP analysis due to insufficient use of study medication when a reduction of dosage of more than 20% corresponding to 1.5 days of treatment was documented.

It can be assumed that both, adults and children infected with common cold viruses will benefit from local application of carrageenan in a similar way. In adults, the effect on disease duration might be masked by patients with cold symptoms not caused by viral infections.

No significant difference in TSS between carrageenan and placebo groups was observed in the first 3 days of the study.

Analysis of nasal fluid samples yielded seven different respiratory viruses ( Table 2 ). As expected in common cold patients, more than 80% of virus positive patients suffered from a rhinovirus or corona virus infection. Viral titers in both carrageenan and placebo treated groups decreased from baseline to the second visit on day 3/4. This result is expected in the natural course of the common cold. However, the magnitude of reduction was greater in patients receiving the carrageenan nasal spray and was statistically significant in the ITT and the PP population. The data correspond to results from two earlier clinical trials in adults and children that both revealed a significant reduction of viral load in the nasal secretion of carrageenan patients [28, 29] .",

Common cold patients with laboratory confirmed cold virus and compliant with study treatment showed shorter duration of disease and faster reduction of common cold symptoms when treated with carrageenan. Furthermore, the use of carrageenan nasal spray was safe and well tolerated. Appropriate dosage seems to be essential and early intervention is suggested to result in significant clinical effectiveness. Therefore, iota-carrageenan may be a good alternative treatment for viral infections of the upper respiratory tract known as the common cold.",
