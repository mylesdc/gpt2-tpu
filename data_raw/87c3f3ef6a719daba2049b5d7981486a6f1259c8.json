Using the best fitting parameters, the time at which the peak is reached is estimated and is shown to be consistent with the data. We also show that in the Euclidean model, one can choose \u03b4 and q values which reproduce the data for the three countries qualitatively. These choices are correlated with population density, control schemes and other factors. Comparing the real data and the results from the model one can also estimate the size of the actual population susceptible to the disease. Rescaling the real data a reasonably good quantitative agreement with the simulation results is obtained.",

Typically, an individual is assumed to be in either one of the three possible states: susceptible, infected and removed (or recovered) denoted by S, I, and R respectively in the simplest models. Diseases which can be contracted only once are believed to be described by the SIR model in which a susceptible individual gets infected by an infected agent who is subsequently removed (dead or recovered). A removed person no longer takes part in the dynamics. In SIS model, an infected person may become susceptible again. In the SIR model, S, I and R represent the densities of population in the three different states and are related through the normalization condition",

In the SIR model, the newly infected fraction shows an initial growth followed by a peak and a subsequent decay. This matches with the overall structure of the real data (e.g. for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) 11 ), which however, show local oscillatory behaviour in addition.

Agent based models for epidemic spreading on regular lattices have been studied quite extensively in the last few decades and in the more recent studies, the complex nature of the network connecting the individuals has been taken into consideration. It has been shown that the geographical factor plays an important role in the spreading process [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] .

Different factors like demographic effect, hospitalization, vaccination and treatment plans have been incorporated in the traditional and well-known SIR model to understand the dynamics of Ebola disease [25] [26] [27] .

Rescaling R(t) such that it varies from 0 to 1, one can find out the goodness of fit. We performed the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to evaluate the goodness of the fit for all the three sets of data. The values are: 1.1294 for Guinea (sample size N s = 217), 1.1070 for Sierra Leone (N s = 235) and 1.4959 for Liberia (N s = 233). Thus the fittings are acceptable at the level of significance \u03b1 = 0.10 for Guinea and Sierra Leone and at \u03b1 = 0.01 for Liberia. From eq.

The associated values of the exponents a, c and T are found out for the three countries and the values of t p also extracted. We have plotted the data for I(t) against t in the insets of the Fig. 2 (a-c). We observe a lot of fluctuations and not a very clear peak in the data just as in the case of SARS 11 .

The mismatch of the t p values is not surprising, unit of time in the model is just one Monte Carlo (MC) time step that has got nothing to do with real time. On the other hand, the saturation values depend heavily on the normalization factor. The actual population who are susceptible may form only a subset of the total population so saturation values can be different changing the values of a and c. Nevertheless, we find that the ratio of of a/c from the data and from the model for Sierra Leone and Liberia are very close which indicates that the fractions of susceptible population in these two countries were comparable while for Guinea it was smaller. Indeed, Table 3 shows that the density of infected population were same for Sierra Leone and Liberia and order of magnitude smaller in Guinea. However, one can still explore the possibility of rescaling the real data to obtain better quantitative agreement between the parameters. This may be possible by suitably choosing a normalization factor for each of the three data sets.

The rescaled data R s (t) and R(t) are plotted against \"real time\" in Fig. 4 and show an excellent agreement for Guinea and a reasonably good agreement for Sierra Leone. The agreement for Liberia is not that good, however, the data for Liberia are somewhat irregular and it is difficult to fit them with a smooth function very accurately as already noted.

We have already justified the choice of \u03b4 between 1 and 2 in the last section. We have used a larger value of \u03b4 for Sierra Leone and a smaller value of q for Guinea to get the consistency. To justify why \u03b4 should be larger for Sierra Leone we note the following. Sierra Leone and Liberia are comparable in size but the density of population is much higher in the former. The density of population is 79.4/km 2 and 40.43/km 2 respectively for these two countries 29 .

However, we need to justify why a smaller value of q is able to reproduce the data for Guinea. A smaller value of q indicates less infection probability which is possible if proper medical care and control measurements are taken. This is indeed true as we find from several documents that the disease was tackled most effectively in Guinea. Table 3 clearly shows that the maximum percentage of cases for Guinea were laboratory-tested which indicates that the process of contact tracing and treatment were more efficient. This is supported by the fact that in Guinea, about 56 contacts per infected person were traced compared to 23 in case of Sierra Leone 31 . We find from ref. 32 that MSF treated the largest number of reported cases in Guinea, in Sierra Leone the minimum out of reported cases. Thus most cases in Sierra Leone, even when reported, had received less attention while in Liberia, a large number is not confirmed or reported at all. Apparently, medical centers by international organisations have also been set up much earlier in Guinea as it was the epicenter of the disease and the disease started as early as in 2013 December. However, later activities could control the disease in Liberia and Sierra Leone as well, and the final number of deaths had been far less than initially anticipated. We also note a curious fact -though Guinea may have recorded the minimum number of cases, yet the disease spanned a longer duration compared to Liberia. Further analysis, beyond the scope of the present paper, may be able to explain this.",

The ratio of the saturation values for the real data and the simulated data corresponds to the factor \u03c1. In principle one should incorporate more factors in the model to fit the real data independently. However, at the present stage qualitative consistency is what we emphasize on. To achieve quantitative consistency one needs to introduce more parameters making the model complex. These parameters may be related to features like inhomogeneity, mobility, more general initial conditions to name a few. We have made simple assumptions like homogeneity, i.e., uniform number of contacts for all agents. The initial condition has been taken to be identical: the disease commences with only one infected person. Our assumption that agents are immobile is supported by ref. 27 in which it is argued that migration did not play a role in the spreading. Even so, this simple model is able to yield data which is consistent with real data and we conclude that it captures the basic mechanism of the epidemic spread. The effect of the Ebola outbreak has been devastating in the West African countries. Apart from the human losses, economic loss has also been considerable 33 . The present study shows that the Euclidean model can be treated as a basic starting point and can be further developed by adding other features.

We consulted the Ebola data for the number of cases detected in the three countries Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone in West Africa (The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 34 ). The data is available from 25th March 2014 to 13th April 2016 at the time interval of a few days. The data is noisy and contains obvious errors as sometimes the cumulative data is shown to decrease which is unphysical. The first available data is from March 2014 when Guinea was already struck with the disease for some time (first case in Guinea reported in December 2013) such that the data for the initial period is missing. For Liberia and Sierra Leone, the data for initial stage are available, however these are sparse and unreliable; often the data for number of death exceeds the number of cases. For this reason, the data has been analysed from the date when the number of cases detected is at least 50 for each country. Even then the errors cannot be fully avoided as for very late stages, the data being rare, also become somewhat unreliable. Hence, the entire data set has to be handled carefully.",

The disease has been officially declared over on 1st June 2016 for Guinea, 9th June 2016 for Liberia and 17th March 2016 for Sierra Leone 35 . But one can see from Fig. 1 that the cumulative data shows a saturation over fairly long period of time. Apparently a few stray cases delayed the declaration of the disease being over. For Liberia, for example, the disease was originally declared to be over as early as in May 2015 but two small flare-ups were reported later. However the cumulative data is hardly affected by the later cases. The data can be downloaded by clicking on the link \"Ebola Data\" in the page http://www. physics-caluniv.in/parongama-sen/index.html Model and Simulation method. In the Euclidean model, the nodes of the network are assumed to occupy the sites of a chain of length N. We generated random long range bonds by connecting nodes located at a distance l along the chain with a probability \u221d \u03b4 \u2212 P l l ( ) ; the probability is normalised by making the total probability equal to unity. Once N/2 such bonds are constructed, the network is completed. The average degree of each node is three and it is expected that the inhomogeneity of the degree distribution is negligible. The disease spreading process is then simulated by assuming a single infected agent at any randomly chosen site in the beginning. All the neighbours are likely to be infected with a probability q in the next step. One generates a random number between 0 and 1, if it is less than q, the agent is taken to be infected. From the agents who are infected in the second step, the disease spreads to their neighbours and the process continues. Infected people are removed within one unit of time, with the assumption that they are either dead or cured, and they can infect the susceptible agents during this one time step only. The dynamical evolution stops when there is either no infected agent at a particular step or when all of them have died. Several configurations are considered and the dynamical variables averaged.",
