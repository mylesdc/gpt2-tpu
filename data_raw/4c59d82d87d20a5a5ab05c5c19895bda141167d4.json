Solar cycles and related changes in the geomagnetic field, variations in water temperature and weather conditions, coast geographical features and human activities have been proposed as possible causes. In December 2009, a pod of seven male sperm whales stranded along the Adriatic coast of Southern Italy. This is the sixth instance from 1555 in this basin.",

Furthermore, samples for age determination, genetic studies, gastric content evaluation, stable isotopes and toxicology were taken from all the seven specimens. The animals were part of the same group and determined by genetic and photo-identification to be part of the Mediterranean population. Causes of death did not include biological agents, or the ''gas and fat embolic syndrome'', associated with direct sonar exposure. Environmental pollutant tissue concentrations were relatively high, in particular organochlorinated xenobiotics. Gastric content and morphologic tissue examinations showed a prolonged starvation, which likely caused, at its turn, the mobilization of lipophilic contaminants from the adipose tissue. Chemical compounds subsequently entered the blood circulation and may have impaired immune and nervous functions.",

The causes remain largely unknown, although many hypotheses have been considered and analyzed, including natural factors, such as biologic disease agents [1] ; impairment of the navigation and echo-location systems due to bathymetric features, acoustic dead zones or anomalies of the Earth's geomagnetic field due to solar activity [2, 3, 4] ; the effects of lunar cycles [5] ; meteorological and oceanographic factors like local disturbances or basin-related temperature variations influencing prey distribution [6] and large-scale climatic events [7] . Furthermore, anthropogenic factors like noise pollution [8, 9] or environmental contaminants [10] have been also proposed as possible causes of strandings. A strong social component, which may prompt healthy animals to follow sick or disordered members of a pod, has been also considered as an additional relevant feature to be pondered in investigating the causes of mass strandings [11] . Mass mortalities involving sperm whales are usually clustered in determined geographical areas, such as the North Sea [1, 2, 3, 6, 8] and in the Southern Australian and New Zealand waters [4, 9, 10] .",

In December 2009, a pod of seven sperm whales stranded along the coastline of the Gargano Promontory (Italy), in the Southern Adriatic Sea. Three animals were still alive and died within 48 hours after stranding. Sperm whales are considered to be vagrant or absent in the waters surrounding the stranding place, and particularly in the Central and Northern areas of the Adriatic Sea, where the habitat is not proper to this deep-diving species [13] . Sperm whales in the Mediterranean Sea occur preferentially in deep continental slope waters where mesopelagic cephalopods are most abundant [14, 15] . In fact, they have been frequently encountered in the Ionian Sea, especially along the Hellenic Trench [16, 17, 18] , as in the Ligurian Sea, where they mostly occur along the continental slope, even if in these basins they were also reported in the pelagic areas [14] .",

A mild cutaneous parasitic infestation was observed at external examination: specimens of copepods belonging to the genus Pennella (Siphonostomatoidea: Pennellidae) were found embedded within the host blubber of all seven animals, often associated to a granulomatous or purulent inflammatory reaction around chitinous remains of the parasites, sometimes accompanied by opportunistic agents (bacteria and fungi), as clearly shown by subsequent histopathological investigations. Tetraphyllidean larvae (Cestoda) were found a) in the subcutaneous blubber of one sperm whale and identified as Phyllobothrium delphini; and b) in the mesenteries of all the examined animals and classified as Monorygma grimaldii. Examining the abdominal cavity of the three studied animals, a mild, chronic, fibrino-erosive peritonitis was also observed, with the thoracic cavity showing a more or less evident pneumothorax associated with a severe pneumomediastinum and with the presence of empty cavities involving the inner cortex of pulmonary lymph nodes, surrounded by hemorrhages. Numerous gas bubbles, shaped as trains or clusters, could be observed in the coronary veins of the three sperm whales (Fig. 3B ). Scarce small bubbles were observed only in subcutaneous veins of sperm whales no. 5 and 6 and in mesenteric veins of no. 5. Bubbles were also found entrapped into a large intra-cardiac blood clot in the latter sperm whale (Fig. 3C ). All the remaining veins were congested, without evidence of bubbles. We emphasize that concurrent fat embolism was ruled out since all the sections from the lungs of the three sperm whales examined showed no or very limited histochemical evidence of lipid droplets in pulmonary vessels, with no clinic or pathological significance. Petechiae and bruises were frequently encountered in the lungs, pleura, mesenteric lymph nodes, and in the kidneys, with a severe congestion of all the tissues mentioned above. Prescapular and pulmonary lymph nodes were markedly enlarged and edematous, with a chronic reactivity being also evident on their cut surfaces, associated with the presence of hemorrhagic foci and brown to black discolored areas.",

            "text": "b. Gastric contents. Stomach contents consisted chiefly of highly digested cephalopod beaks and foreign bodies. Both the organic and inorganic fractions occurred in all the seven animals, although the gastric chambers were almost empty in individuals no. 4 and no. 5. The intestines of all the three whales examined at necropsy were empty; the scarce content of the lumen was due to an abundant, biliary-stained mucous-like content. In all the animals that we examined we noted no fragments of cephalopod flesh, gladii (entire or partial), sucker rings, hooks or eye lenses; beaks were found in varying stages of digestion and no fish or crustaceans remains were observed. On the basis of the morphological features of the squid beaks, members of the histioteuthid family were the commonest prey, specifically Histiotheutis bonnellii and, to a lesser extent, H. reversi and other rare species (Octopoteuthis sicula and Galiteuthis armata). Gastric nematodes, which were present in almost all samples, represented the second part of the undigested material. Several adults and preadults of Anisakis spp. (Nematoda: Anisakidae) were observed in the stomach chambers in association with a mild, multifocal, catarrhal gastritis. Table 2 summarizes the gastric findings and shows how parasitic burden increased with the amount of both fractions, organic and inorganic. Inorganic remains comprised mostly foreign bodies of human origin, including fishing gear and hooks, ropes, and several plastic objects. No evident obstruction or perforation of the alimentary tract was noted. c. Histopathology. An acute, multifocal to diffuse, fibrinous bronchopneumonia and a mild, diffuse, chronic catarrhal enteritis were microscopically observed in all the three animals examined at necropsy. Histological investigations confirmed also the severe hyperemic and hemorrhagic lesions observed during gross examinations. In particular, the liver exhibited a severe diffuse congestion of sinusoids with prominent compression of hepatocytes, accompanied by a multifocal macro-vacuolar steatosis that was prominent around portal triads. Lymph nodes were histologically characterized by a severe and diffuse intrafollicular lymphoid cell depletion, associated with the deposition of a hyaline eosinophilic amorphous material at the cortical level, while a diffuse and severe histiocytic infiltration was observed in sinusal spaces. Several solitary or aggregated macrophages showed a brown to black cytoplasmic pigmentation, which positively stained with the auto-metallographic technique (Danscher's staining), a specific histochemical staining for inorganic mercury. In general, the above mononucleated elements had mostly perifollicular and perivascular locations. By means of the autometallographic technique, we confirmed the presence of inorganic mercury also in the liver and kidneys of all the three whales examined with a full necropsy, as well as in brainstem neurons of animal no. 6. In the liver, Hg was restricted to the cytoplasm of hepatocytes and Kuppfer cells and especially concentrated in periportal areas, whereas in the kidney Hg was confined to the cytoplasm of tubular epithelial cells, with special reference to those of cortical tubules. At the same time, the aforementioned cytoplasmic granules detected in neurons, hepatocytes, Kuppfer cells, and macrophages of the lymph nodes, stained positively also with the Schmorl's histochemical technique commonly used to mark lipofuscin pigments. Only in myocardial and musculoskeletal fibers lipofuscin granules were observed despite the absence of inorganic mercury particles. The observation of the aforementioned cytoplasmic crystals by environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM), coupled with x-ray induced fluorescence, confirmed a composition similar to mercury selenide (HgSe, composed for 71.25% of total weight by Hg and 28.25% of total weight by Se): hepatic granules were composed by Hg (71% of total weight), Se (24.37% of total weight), and S (4.62% of total weight); granules in the macrophages of lymph nodes were constituted by the same elements, albeit with slightly different proportions (Hg 73.44%, Se 20.22% and S 6.34% of total weight). Hepatic and lymph node findings are shown in Fig. 4 .",

            "text": "Mass strandings of sperm whales are extremely rare in the Mediterranean Sea. In the Adriatic Sea, five similar events involving 3-8 animals were reported since 1555 before the one considered in this study [15] , even if this species is regarded as opportunistic or vagrant in the basin [12] . In the present sixth instance, occurred on December 10-11, 2009, the 7 animals came in from both Western and Eastern Mediterranean basins. The comparative analyses of the entire control region of the mitochondrial DNA confirmed that the seven whales belonged to the Mediterranean subpopulation. The total lack of haplotype diversity among samples collected within the Mediterranean Sea implies some degree of population isolation, small effective population size or perhaps a reduction in maternal lineages brought on by a recent bottleneck event [20, 21] . The low level of haplotype variability found in this investigation was also reported in previous studies [22] . These latter investigations have indicated substantially low levels of nucleotide variation on a global scale along with the presence of significant levels of kinship between some group members that may be the result of matrilineal structuring at the unit or group level [20, 23, 24, 25] . Lyrholm et al. (1998) proposed a historical bottleneck to explain the low levels of mtDNA diversity (based on the data obtained on a DNA 320bp sequence from the control region) [23] . Studies on stable isotopes performed on target tissues revealed that the average d 13 C was within the literature range for sperm whales over various geographical areas [26, 27] , with low d 15 N levels. This finding mirrors the oligotrophic conditions of the Mediterranean Sea [28, 29] , thus confirming the Mediterranean origin of the sperm whales. The hypothesis that they belonged to the same pod was put forward based on the genetic outcomes, which identified the mitochondrial control region sequence to be identical for all stranded animals. The low between-specimen isotopic variability indicated also similar dietary sources [30, 31] . In any case, the exact type of association among these whales before the stranding remains unknown, although their number is larger than the group size of loose male aggregations in the Mediterranean [19, 32, 33] .",

The tissue isotopic variability observed in this study can account for differences in short-and long-term diet, due to a different cellular turnover. To our knowledge, no specific information on sperm whale tissue turnover is available. However, skin turnover is considered comparable to that of other odontocete species (about 70-75 d) [32] and its isotopic composition thus provides dietary insight over periods of more than 2 months. Other tissues, and especially muscle, are expected to have a longer turnover, thus providing long-time integrated information on diet. Since sperm whales are known to have a wide habitat range on the offshore part of the continental slope, albeit having a very specialized diet on cephalopods [34] , the isotopic differences between short-(e.g. skin) and long-turnover tissues (e.g. muscle) suggest the exploitation of different feeding areas. The factors expected to affect the behavior of the seven sperm whales under study, and possibly causing their stranding, arose about 10 to 20 days before the event: therefore, the temporal resolution of stable isotopes does not allow to gain specific insights into very recent movements, and the possible concurrent role of starvation in this mass stranding event cannot be ruled out. Despite all these observations, we were not able to confirm that these stranded sperm whales formed a single stable group with a social hierarchy, although we would rather suggest that more than one loose male aggregation and/or several solitary individuals could have coalesced in a limited sea area, most likely in the Ionian Sea, between summer and fall. From there they subsequently entered the Adriatic Sea for unknown reasons. To the best of our knowledge, no relevant unusual natural events (i.e. seaquake or weather storms) or noxious anthropogenic activities (military drills using sonar) that could have caused an avoidance behavior occurred temporally and spatially associated with the event. The only relevant anomaly reported by the marine data archives was the increased sea superficial temperature in November and December along the Hellenic Trench and Eastern part of the Adriatic Sea, possibly constituting a thermal front in which upwelling and/or downwelling could have been favorable to the development of cephalopod populations. Several studies have documented the influence of frontal zones on sperm whale distribution worldwide. This species and other teutophageous cetaceans (i.e. dwarf and pigmy sperm whales, pilot whales, Risso's dolphin, and Ziphiidae) occurred, over abyssal depths, at the steepest sea superficial temperature gradients, at the periphery of a cyclone zone and in a convergence zone, both forming thermal fronts because of the aggregation of main preys near these zones [34, 35] .",

Considering the maximum horizontal speed reported for male sperm whales (90 km/day) [11] , with no slowdown due to feeding activities or weakness, it took no less than 7 days for these whales to reach the Gargano Promontory. In this respect, the low quantities of highly digested squid beaks found within the gastric cavities are in open contrast with the feeding habits and daily intake typical of the species [36] , thus suggesting a starvation period of at least 3 to 7 days [11, 36] , an amount of time compatible with the traveling time. Furthermore, the mild portal hepatic steatosis observed at microscopic examination, along with the real body weights of the seven animals (calculated using a correction factor applied to the weight measured during disposal of the carcasses), that were lower than the expected values (estimated on the basis of the total body length), further support this hypothesis [1] . Foreign bodies (including fishing gears and hooks, ropes, and plastic objects) were found in all the examined stomachs, with an incidence higher than those reported for other mass strandings [36] . Nevertheless, all the objects recovered from the whale stomachs cannot be proposed as a likely cause of stranding, given the absence of any evident obstructions [37] .",

All these areas display geographical features similar to those defined ''acoustic dead zones'' [4] : the comparable morphology of the stranding location and the meteorological conditions registered during the days before the event (winds, currents and waves directed to the Gargano coasts) could explain why our seven sperm whales arrived on their stranding and beaching destination. Preliminary observations, in particular the distribution and the position related to the coastline, suggested that all animals were debilitated, possibly by a common pathological condition. We emphasize that the presence of copepods of the genus Pennella, that affected the skin of the seven whales, has been suggested as a reliable indicator of poor health in free-ranging cetacean populations [38] .",

In fact, many of the observed pathological findings (i.e. diffuse visceral congestion and hemorrhages; mild fibrinous peritonitis; pneumothorax) were likely related to recumbence. The search for infectious agents and marine biotoxins responsible for known cetacean epidemic outbreaks and mass die-offs was negative [39, 40] . However, an impairment of the immune response was strongly suspected on the basis of the prominent lymphoid cell depletion that was apparent in several lymph nodes, as well as on the basis of both the acute opportunistic bacterial infections ascertained in the respiratory tract and of the biomolecular demonstration of T. gondii within a wide range of tissues sampled from the three whales on which a detailed necropsy was performed. As a matter of fact, and similarly to what reported in terrestrial mammals, T. gondii is commonly believed to be an opportunistic protozoan agent in free-ranging cetaceans [39] . Since no infections due to a lymphotropic agent (i.e. Morbillivirus) were microscopically, molecularly and serologically detected on postmortem examination, the primary cause of lymphoid depletion remains uncertain. Bacterial components (such as lipopolysaccharides), prolonged stressful conditions, malnutrition and emaciation observed in diseased whales, might all contribute to immune system impairment [41, 42] . In the whales examined in this study, the acute fibrinous pneumonia caused by opportunistic bacteria, along with the biomolecular identification of T. gondii in two animals, should be regarded as very reliable biologic indicators of a pre-existing damage of the immune response. In this respect, the lack of pathological T. gondii-associated changes in all tissues examined supports the hypothesis of a recently acquired infection. In our opinion, both the high tissue levels of environmental pollutants and the prolonged starvation period should be considered as the most likely causes of the whales' immune response impairment. Previous studies on harbor porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) confirmed the existence of a relationship, in odontocete cetaceans, between lymphoid cell depletion in lymphatic tissues and elevated persistent organic pollutant body burdens, thus strongly supporting the hypothesis of a contaminant-induced failure of the immune system [42, 43] . The direct impact of acoustic sources (sonar or air-guns for seismic surveys) or a seaquake that could have caused the onset of the ''gas and fat embolic syndrome'' was considered as another possible cause of death [44] . Nevertheless, this suspicion was ruled out, since the three fully examined whales showed no evidences of lipid and gas emboli. Interestingly enough, our results concerning pulmonary fat emboli confirmed that ''gas and fat embolic syndrome'' is not commonly observed in stranded cetaceans, even if they spent hours stranded alive on the shores, thus clearly differentiating the above condition from atypical mass stranding related to sonar exposure [44] . On the other hand, gas bubbles were mainly found in the coronary veins and not widely distributed throughout the rest of the body as described in the ''gas and fat embolic syndrome''. Two hypotheses could be proposed to explain the presence of gas bubbles in the coronary veins. The first one points to the prolonged lateral recumbence of these very large and heavy whales on the beach, with almost or no chance of thoracic movement that progressively led to overbreathing with overexpansion of the passively congested lungs and rupture of alveolar walls, followed by interstitial and sub-pleural emphysema, as confirmed by thoracic hemorrhages, leading to pneumomediastinum, likely pneumothorax, and pneumopericardium [45] . This process can result in gas entering the pulmonary veins and lymphatic vessels, thus reaching either the left atrium and left ventricle, or the lymph nodes, respectively. This process reduces pulmonary ventilatory efficiency and leads progressively to general hypoxia and cardio-pulmonary hypertension and failure.",

A circulation of methyl-mercury in tissues of the three whales that underwent a full necropsy was hypothesized, based on its concentrations in kidneys and relative percentages on total Hg. The circulation of methyl-mercury originating from body storages has been confirmed in fasting or lactating laboratory animals, in which organic mercury enters the blood circle and subsequently spreads to all main target organs, including the kidneys [50] . In addition, low protein diet feeding, in particular with low sulfur amino-acids, associated with low organic mercury concentrations, are suspected to decrease urinary Hg excretion and simultaneously increase the retention of MeHg metabolite in renal cells, by a more efficient re-adsorption of MeHg than in normal protein diets and modulation of the activity of glutathione complex and thiols [51, 52] . The deposition of inorganic mercury as black auto-metallograpic positive granules within the cytoplasm of macrophages residing in the enlarged, brown to blackpigmented prescapular lymph nodes, as well in hepatic Kupffer cells, does also suggest a circulation of inorganic mercury. In this respect, the ultrastructural investigations carried out on the liver samples and the Hg:Se close to one ratio found with trace element analysis confirmed that in sperm whales, as in other odontocetes, hepatic organic mercury precipitates into tiemannite (HgSe) crystals as an end product of methyl-mercury detoxification [53, 54] . Any possible degenerative changes, included those prompted by prolonged fasting, are believed to cause the release of cytoplasmic HgSe complexes into the bloodstream, with subsequent macrophage phagocytosis. This observation supports the hypothesis that in cetaceans mononuclear phagocytes are crucial for the biological fate of Hg [55] . In vivo studies on mice have also demonstrated that a selective increase of the inorganic Hg fraction in lymph nodes is likely due to the demethylation process of MeHg that takes place in macrophage-rich lymphoid tissues. A similar mechanism could determine, at its turn, a preferential accumulation of inorganic Hg within the lymphoid tissues in comparison to other non-lymphatic body districts, following exposure to MeHg [56] . Cadmium concentrations in the kidney and other tissues showed levels similar to those observed in marine mammals and birds with a diet based on cephalopods [57] .",

However, their muscular concentrations higher than those measured in blubber and hepatic tissues, may suggest a release of such compounds into the blood circulation from body lipid reserves, since the affinity of PAHs for fat tissues is lower than that of other POPs. Organochlorinated compound levels, in particular PCBs and DDTs, were higher than those found in other sperm whale mass strandings [10, 49] , as for the liver concentrations of Hg.

Prolonged starvation, environmental conditions improper for the species, along with breakdown of adipose body reserves and the consequent release into the bloodstream of chemical substances likely displaying neurotoxic and immunotoxic effects, altered the orientation and space perception of the whales, worsening their welfare and health.

Based on replicates of laboratory standards, analytical precision was 60.2 and 60.1% for d 15 N and d 13 C, respectively.",

A region of ,100bp within the B1 gene was amplified with the primer pair B1outF (59-GGAACTG-CATCCGTTCATGAG-39) and B1outR (59-TCTTTAAAGC-GTTCGTGGTC-39) in a first round of PCR, followed by a second round using the primer set B1intF (59-TGCATAGGTTG-CAGTCACTG-39) and B1intR (59-GGCGACCAATCTGC-GAATACACC-39). Both amplification rounds for B1 gene consisted of an initial step of 10 min at 95uC, 35 cycles, each of 60 sec at 94uC, 60 sec at 50uC (first step) or 54uC (second step), 60 sec at 72uC, with a final extension of 10 min at 72uC. In the first step the mixture (50 ml) consisted of 4 ml of DNA extract, 50 pmol of each of the primers and 25 ml of Ready Mix REDTaq (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). The conditions for the second step mixture were identical to those for the primary PCR, with the exception of the template amount (i.e. 4 ml of a 1/10 dilution of the primary B1 PCR product, determined to be optimal). Successful PCR products were purified directly and sequenced using a Taq DyeDeoxyTerminator cycle sequencing kit in an ABI-PRISM model 377 sequencer (Perkin Elmer, Warrington, UK). Accuracy was achieved by two-directional sequencing and all electropherograms were manually checked and edited. Sequences obtained were compared with sequences registered in the GenBank TM for each gene examined using the Nucleotide-Nucleotide ''Basic Local Alignment Search Tool'' [72] .",

The samples of blubber, liver and muscle (about 2 g) were lyophilized in an Edwards freeze drier for 2 days and extracted with n-hexane for gas chromatography (Merck) in a Soxhlet apparatus for analysis of organochlorinated compounds. WhatmanH cellulose thimbles (i.d. 25 mm, e.d. 27 mm, length 100 mm) to be used for extraction of the samples were preheated for about 30 min to 110uC and pre-extracted for 9 h in a Soxhlet apparatus with n-hexane, to remove organochlorinated contamination. Each sample was spiked with surrogate compound (2,4,6-trichlorobiphenyls -IUPAC number 30) [76] prior to extraction. This compound was quantified and its recovery calculated. Surrogate recovery was reported with the sample results. The samples were then purified with sulphuric acid to obtain a first lipid sedimentation. The extract then underwent liquid chromatography on a column containing Florisil that had been dried for 1 h in an oven at 110uC. This further purified the apolar phase of lipids that could not be saponified, including steroids like cholesterol. Decachlorobiphenyl (DCBP -IUPAC number 209) was used as an internal standard, added to each sample extract prior to analysis, and included in the calibration standard, a mixture of specific compounds (Aroclor 1260, HCB and pp9-and op9-DDT, DDD and DDE). The analytical method used was High Resolution Capillary Gas Chromatography with an Agilent 6890N and a 63Ni ECD and an SBP-5 bonded phase capillary column (30 m long, 0.2 mm i.d.). The carrier gas was N 2 with a head pressure of 15.5 psi (splitting ratio 50/1). The scavenger gas was argon/methane (95/5) at 40 ml/min. Oven temperature was 100uC for the first 10 min, after which it was increased to 280uC at 5uC/min. Injector and detector temperatures were 200uC and 280uC respectively. The extracted organic material (EOM%) from freeze-dried samples was calculated in all samples. Capillary gaschromatography revealed op9-and pp9-isomers of DDT and its derivatives DDD and DDE, and about 30 PCB congeners. Total PCBs were quantified as the sum of all congeners. These congeners constituted 80% of the total peak area of PCBs in the samples. Total DDT was calculated as the sum of op9DDT, pp9DDT, op9DDD, pp9DDD, op9DDE and pp9DDE.
