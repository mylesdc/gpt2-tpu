Because mosquito control programs are not highly efficient for outbreak containment, vaccines are essential to reduce the burden of disease. Although no licensed vaccine against CHIKF is yet available, many highly promising candidates are undergoing preclinical studies, and a few of them have been tested in human trials of phase 1 or 2. Here, we review recent findings regarding the need for a CHIKF vaccine and provide an update on vaccines nearing or having entered clinical trials. We also address needs to tackle bottlenecks to vaccine development-including scientific and financial barriers-and to accelerate the development of vaccines; several actions should be taken: (i) design efficacy trials to be conducted during the course of outbreaks; (ii) evaluate the opportunity for adopting the \"animal rule\"for demonstration of efficacy for regulatory purposes; (iii) strengthen the collective commitment of nations, international organizations, potential donors and industry; (iv) stimulate public and/or private partnerships to invest in vaccine development and licensure; and (v) identify potential markets for an effective and safe CHIKF vaccine.",

            "text": "Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an RNA alphavirus belonging to the Togaviridae family, first identified in Tanzania in 1952. During epidemics and endemic circulation, CHIKV is transmitted by Aedes aegypti and, to a lesser extent, by A. albopictus mosquitoes. Infection with CHIKV typically causes a self-limiting febrile illness, chikungunya fever (CHIKF), characterized by chronic, severe joint pain, and sometimes accompanied by an itchy maculo-papular skin rash. Severe complications, such as encephalitis, may occur in the elderly and in individuals with comorbidities, and peripartum infections can be fatal or involve severe neurologic sequelae in fetuses and infants [1, 2] . CHIKV is enzootic in Africa, where transmission involves different arboreal Aedes spp. vectors and nonhuman primates (NHP) in forested habitats. Direct spillover infections of humans from these enzootic cycles probably occur in many regions of Sub-Saharan Africa. In Asia, CHIKV is endemic and causes recurrent and sometimes large epidemics, especially in the Indian subcontinent and in Southeast Asia [1] [2] [3] . In 2004, CHIKV reemerged to cause large outbreaks, which began on the coast of Kenya and ravaged several Indian Ocean islands and the Indian subcontinent in the years 2005 to 2006, before spreading to initiate transmission in Southeast Asia [4, 5] . A few years later, CHIKF outbreaks were also reported in the Arabian Peninsula [6] . In 2013, autochthonous (locally originating) chains of transmission of CHIKV were identified for the first time in the Americas [7] . CHIKV has expanded its range of activity to include temperate regions in part by adapting for transmission by A. albopictus, including two outbreaks in Italy in 2007 and 2017 [8, 9] and two in France. The unabated spread and increasing burden of CHIKF underscores the need to develop an effective vaccine [10] .",

The impact of CHIKF in terms of burden of disease, work and school absenteeism, and other financial costs is particularly high, especially given its formidable epidemic potential. A paradigmatic example is provided by the 2006 epidemic wave that occurred in India, in which more than 1,500,000 cases of CHIKF were reported (http://www.who.int/denguecontrol/arbo-viral/other_ arboviral_chikungunya/en/). Furthermore, the global impact of CHIKV is constantly growing, due to the introduction and spread of the virus into new continents in which it finds optimal conditions for its expansion, including, in some cases, a completely na\u00efve population (Fig 1) . The capacity of CHIKV to adapt to a new mosquito vector has been demonstrated during the Indian Ocean epidemic, when a series of mutations increased fitness for transmission by A. albopictus [14, 15] , a mosquito that can survive at higher latitudes than A. aegypti [16] . This may lead to the occurrence of outbreaks in temperate climates, as seen in Europe [8, 9] .",

Although \"Old World\" alphaviruses are not considered neurotropic sensu strictu [18] , cases of meningoencephalitis have been documented, especially during Indian outbreaks [1] , and fatal encephalitis has been reported with CHIKV infection both in Italy [8] and in La Reunion, where it was observed in patients mostly below 1 year or over 65 years of age [19] . Relatively high case-fatality rates (17%) and persistent disability (30% to 45%) were documented among patients with CHIKVassociated encephalitis. An increased incidence of other neurological syndromes, such as Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, was also reported during a CHIKF outbreak in French Polynesia [20] .

            "text": "Thirdly, persistent arthralgia and joint swelling are common long-term manifestations of CHIKF. Unlike other mosquito-borne viruses such as dengue, Zika, and even yellow fever, CHIKV typically causes symptomatic infection, and consequently outbreaks are accompanied by high attack rates. Chronic joint pain, along with asthenia and mood changes, is a common cause of quality-of-life impairment. Ninety-four percent of symptomatic travelers infected in La Reunion complained of joint or bone pain 6 months after the epidemic peak; this pain was continuous in 41% of the cases. The effect of chronic symptoms on the quality of life was defined as totally disabling or important in almost half of the patients, whereas only 16% reported a normal mood [21] . A study conducted in La Reunion on 147 individuals over the age of 16 found that 84 confirmed cases (57%) self-reported rheumatic symptoms; of these, 63% reported permanent pain, whereas 37% had recurrent symptoms. An age of over 45 years (odds ratio [OR] 3.9), severe initial joint pain (OR 4.8) , and the presence of underlying osteoarthritic comorbidity (OR 2.9) were independent predictors of nonrecovery [22] . An assessment of 173 individuals with CHIKF conducted in Mauritius found that 79% reported persisting musculoskeletal symptoms 27.5 months after infection, associated with older age, female gender, and a baseline symmetrical distribution of arthralgia [23] . A study conducted on Italian patients found that over 66% of those with CHIKF developed long-lasting rheumatic disorders, leading to functional impairment affecting daily living activities up to one year after infection [24] . Therefore, the long-term impact of CHIKF is far from negligible in terms of suffering, need for care, impairment of work ability, psychological problems, diminished quality of life, and associated economic costs.",

            "text": "Unfortunately, little information is available on the economic costs of CHIKV infection. Healthcare costs during the La Reunion in 2005 to 2006 epidemic were estimated: the medical management of CHIKF was associated with a major economic burden, with 60% of the CHIKF-related expenditure attributable to direct medical costs, such as medical consultation (47%), hospitalization (32%), and drug consumption (19%). The cost of analgesics accounted for 80% of the CHIKF-related drug expenditures. Loss of productivity, measured as absenteeism costs, was also high [25] . Studies conducted in 2006 in Gujarat, India, estimated an immediate cost to household of CHIKF and dengue around 3.8 billion Indian rupees (ca. US$55 million) per annum, whereas another study conducted in Ahmedabad, a city of 3.5 million people in the State of Gujarat, found that the disease affected primarily working-age adults, with an immediate cost of the outbreak due to lost wages and treatment of approximately US $1.7 million based only on officially reported cases; these figures are probably underestimated, because only 23% of the cases seek treatment within public facilities [26] . Another study estimated a total of about 40 million cases in the Americas, with a burden of 24 million disability life years (DALYs) lost and about US$185 billion in societal cost [27] . Therefore, although CHIKF is in most cases a relatively mild illness, its burden during epidemic waves may be impressive. Finally, when CHIKF outbreaks occur in tourist destinations, economic loss due to decreased numbers of visitors may cause further economic impacts. The under-recognition of the potential impact of CHIKF led to undesired political consequences during the epidemic waves on the tourist destination island of La Reunion, with the French government being accused of negligence and delays in outbreak response [65] .",

An effective vaccine would reduce the number of cases and hospitalizations worldwide, producing economic benefits through the reduction of absenteeism, lower costs for care and hospitalizations, and reduced loss of income associated with tourism; (ii) countries outside the tropics might also benefit from the development of a CHIKF vaccine, because the virus may be introduced from endemic and/or epidemic areas or enzootic circulation and eventually spread to regions where competent urban vectors are present; (iii) protection of travelers and military personnel may be another positive outcome of vaccine development; (iv) there are clear ethical implications in the development of a vaccine against an emerging neglected disease that primarily affects resource-limited parts of the globe.",

The occurrence of arthralgia suggested insufficient and/or unstable attenuation; later studies indicated that the 181/clone25 attenuation is mediated by only two point mutations, which can revert following vaccination [34] . In other studies, seroconversion rates were low among those who had been previously vaccinated with other live-attenuated alphavirus vaccines (i.e., Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus), suggesting immunological interference [35] . Ultimately, development of this live-attenuated vaccine was discontinued not only because of reactogenicity and the absence of widespread and well-documented outbreaks but also due to the scarcity of funding and concerns regarding marketing [36, 37] .",

Although the technical challenges of developing a CHIKF vaccine are not as great as those for some other viral diseases such as dengue, in which multiple serotypes must be targeted and partial immunity can lead to disease enhancement [54] , there are several critical obstacles and financial constraints that need to be overcome in order to make available an affordable and effective vaccine. First of all, barriers to the acquisition of human efficacy data for vaccine candidates due to the unpredictable nature of CHIKF epidemics may delay the development of a vaccine, even though promising candidates are available. For example, randomized controlled trials, which are considered the gold-standard for evaluating vaccine efficacy, may not be feasible during interepidemics periods because of the low expected number of cases; for this reason, epidemic events with a large number of cases may represent unique opportunities to ensure study power for testing vaccine candidates in efficacy trials. Approaches to overcoming these barriers include the development of platform technologies in which the critical antigens of a newly emerging viral strain can be rapidly incorporated into DNA or RNA platforms with proven safety records. However, based on initial results with DNA Zika vaccines that were generated within a few months of the recognition of congenital Zika Syndrome, these vaccines require multiple doses and immunity is not long lived; they are therefore far from ideal for intervening during an explosive epidemic or for long-term protection in endemic locations. Viral-vectored platforms such as vesicular stomatitis or measles can also be rapidly adapted for new viral targets and may offer more rapid and durable immunity.",

Therefore, vaccine trials should be designed very carefully to implement quickly and maximize their results during outbreaks. Potential opportunities for CHIKF vaccine testing may include cities with histories of recurrent dengue outbreaks (dengue and CHIKV share the same human-amplified transmission cycles, so regions susceptible to one should eventually have outbreaks of the other); for example, Sao Paulo State, Brazil, and Iquitos, Peru, have still not experienced major CHIKF outbreaks. However, ethical concerns with placebo-immunizing at-risk populations during an epidemic may need to be overcome with nontraditional designs, such as that used during the Ebola vaccine trials in West Africa [55] .",

For example, it will be important to obtain reliable information on correlates of immune protection, which are essential in order to apply the so-called \"animal rule.\" This entails the use of surrogate end-points derived from animal data instead of the results of human trials. This approach could be considered as an alternative option when large efficacy studies on humans, which are usually requested for traditional regulatory approval, are virtually impossible to realize [57] . For example, if human antibodies against CHIKV developed from individuals vaccinated in phase 1 and 2 trials are transferred to NHPs and are demonstrated to confer protection, this could provide surrogate evidence of vaccine efficacy, leading to a provisional license [58] . In this regard, the level of neutralizing antibodies has been already proposed for use as a surrogate marker of vaccine-induced protection [10, 36, 49, 58] . Although there is strong evidence that neutralizing antibodies against CHIKV protect against infection and disease, the lack of compete understanding of chronic arthritis, and its determinants, could limit the ability to relate animal efficacy to human protection. Further work to model arthralgia and arthritis in NHPs could greatly enhance the value of preclinical CHIKF vaccine testing. Other regulatory considerations, including \"traditional approval,\" \"accelerated approval,\" and the \"animal rule,\" have been reviewed extensively in another article focused on CHIKF vaccines [13] .",

In fact, most research and development (R&D) projects do not deliver a licensed vaccine for routine or targeted immunization-not because of methodological problems, but due to political and economic obstacles [59] . In fact, neglected diseases disproportionally affect poor and marginalized populations, and vaccines may have low returns on investment, so commercial firms may be reluctant to commit themselves to the expensive development and licensure of vaccine candidates, which typically totals hundreds-ofmillions of US dollars [60] . To overcome this problem, several strategies may be implemented, including the creation of public and/or private partnerships, the identification of target population groups for vaccination to ensure a potential market, such as the military market, travelers and tourists, and the commitment of donor agencies and affected and/or donor countries [61] . Combination private and public consortia should address those vaccine development projects that are not considered highly profitable by industry in the absence of support from the governments of industrial countries. A recent example is the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), funded by both government entities and private foundations, and include partners from the pharmaceutical industry, which is funding late preclinical and clinical development of vaccines for infections by Lassa, Nipah, and MERS coronavirus [62] .",
