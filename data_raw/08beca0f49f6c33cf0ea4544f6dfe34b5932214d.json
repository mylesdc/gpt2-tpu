The FilmArray disposable pouch is prepared by injecting hydration solution and, separately, the patient sample, i.e., for the FilmArray RP test, a nasopharyngeal swab in viral transport media. The pouch is loaded into the FilmArray Instrument and the operator scans the barcode (containing panel type, lot and serial numbers) and then scans or manually enters information into the \"Sample\" field. Additional free form text can be entered into a \"Tag\" field. Software on the computer connected to the FilmArray Instrument analyses the amplification products and indicates each pathogen target detected. The results are presented as a Portable Document Format report and can be exported to the laboratory's LIS. Information about the patient (gender, age, date of birth etc.) is not recorded by the instrument unless specifically entered.",
