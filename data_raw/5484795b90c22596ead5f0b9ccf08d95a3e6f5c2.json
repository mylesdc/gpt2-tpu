Sixteen viral non-structural proteins (nsp1 to nsp16) constitute an unusually large replicase complex, which includes two methyltransferases putatively involved in viral mRNA cap formation. The S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet)-dependent (guanine-N7)-methyltransferase (N7-MTase) activity was recently attributed to nsp14, whereas nsp16 has been predicted to be the AdoMet-dependent (nucleoside-29O)-methyltransferase. Here, we have reconstituted complete SARS-CoV mRNA cap methylation in vitro. We show that mRNA cap methylation requires a third viral protein, nsp10, which acts as an essential trigger to complete RNA cap-1 formation. The obligate sequence of methylation events is initiated by nsp14, which first methylates capped RNA transcripts to generate cap-0 7Me GpppA-RNAs. The latter are then selectively 29O-methylated by the 29O-MTase nsp16 in complex with its activator nsp10 to give rise to cap-1 7Me GpppA 29OMe -RNAs. Furthermore, sensitive in vitro inhibition assays of both activities show that aurintricarboxylic acid, active in SARS-CoV infected cells, targets both MTases with IC 50 values in the micromolar range, providing a validated basis for anti-coronavirus drug design.",

            "text": "In 2003, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which was likely transmitted from bats, was responsible for a worldwide SARS-outbreak [1] . Coronaviruses belong to the order Nidovirales and are characterized by the largest positive-strand RNA ((+) RNA) genomes (around 30,000 nt) known in the virus world. The enzymology of their RNA synthesis is therefore thought to be significantly more complex than that of other RNA virus groups [2, 3, 4] . The 59-proximal two-thirds of the CoV genome (open reading frames 1a and 1b) are translated into the viral replicase polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab (Figure 1 ), which give rise to 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps) by co-and posttranslational autoproteolytic processing. The 39-proximal third encodes the viral structural proteins and several so-called accessory proteins, which are expressed from a set of four to nine subgenomic (sg) mRNAs. The latter are transcribed from subgenome-length minus-strand templates, whose production involves a unique mechanism of discontinuous RNA synthesis (reviewed by [5, 6] ). To organize their complex RNA synthesis and genome expression, the CoV proteome includes several enzyme activities that are rare or lacking in other (+) RNA virus families (reviewed in [2] ). In the years following the 2003 SARS outbreak, bioinformatics, structural biology, (reverse) genetics and biochem-ical studies have contributed to the in-depth characterization of CoV nsps in general and those of SARS-CoV in particular [7] . Currently documented enzyme activities include two proteinases (in nsp3 and nsp5; [8, 9] ), a putative RNA primase (nsp8; [10] ), an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12; [11, 12] ), a helicase/ RNA triphosphatase (nsp13; [13, 14] ), an exo-and an endoribonuclease (nsp14 and nsp15; [15, 16] , and an S-adenosyl-Lmethionine (AdoMet)-dependent (guanine-N7)-methyltransferase (N7-MTase), which were proposed to play a role in the formation of CoV mRNA caps (nsp14; [17] ). Based on comparative sequence analysis, nsp16 presumably encodes an AdoMet-dependent mRNA cap (nucleoside-29O)-methyltransferase (29O-MTase) [3, 18, 19] . For SARS-CoV nsp16, however, this enzyme activity has remained elusive thus far, and experimental evidence for its existence has only been obtained for the related feline coronavirus (FCoV) nsp16 [18] . CoV nsps form the viral replication/ transcription complex (RTC), which is thought to localize to a network of endoplasmic reticulum-derived, modified membranes in the infected cell [20, 21] . Protein-protein interactions were proposed to be essential for the assembly of the RTC and may therefore also regulate the activities of enzymes involved in viral RNA synthesis.",

            "text": "Although the 59 ends of SARS-CoV mRNAs have not been characterized yet, they are assumed to carry a cap structure. This assumption is based on the characterisation of genomic and subgenomic mRNAs of the coronavirus murine hepatitis virus (MHV) [22, 23] and the related equine torovirus (EToV or Berne virus), which also belong to the Coronaviridae family [23, 24] . The mRNAs of both viruses were concluded to carry a 59-terminal cap structure. Moreover, in the coronavirus and torovirus genome three enzymes putatively involved in mRNA capping have been identified, although they remain poorly characterised [13, 14, 17, 18, 19] . Cap structures promote initiation of translation and protect mRNAs against exoribonuclease activities [25, 26, 27] . The synthesis of the cap structure in eukaryotes involves three sequential enzymatic activities: (i) an RNA triphosphatase (RTPase) that removes the 59 cphosphate group of the mRNA; (ii) a guanylyltransferase (GTase) which catalyzes the transfer of GMP to the remaining 59diphosphate terminus; and (iii) an N7-MTase that methylates the cap guanine at the N7-position, thus producing the so-called ''cap-0 structure'', 7Me GpppN. Whereas lower eukaryotes, including yeast, employ a cap-0 structure, higher eukaryotes convert cap-0 into cap-1 or cap-2 structures [25, 26, 28] by means of 29O-MTases, which methylate the ribose 29O-position of the first and the second nucleotide of the mRNA, respectively. RNA cap methylation is essential since it prevents the pyrophosphorolytic reversal of the guanylyltransfer reaction, and ensures efficient binding to the ribosome [25, 26] . In the case of (+) RNA viruses such as alphaviruses and flaviviruses, mutations in RNA cap methylation genes were shown to be lethal or detrimental to virus replication [29, 30, 31, 32, 33] . For coronaviruses, a functional and genetic analysis performed on MHV temperature sensitive mutants mapping to the N7-MTase domain of CoV nsp14 and in the 29O-MTase nsp16 indicated that both are involved in positive-strand RNA synthesis by previously formed replicase-transcriptase complexes [11] . The importance of nsp14 and nsp16 for viral RNA synthesis is further supported by data obtained by mutagenesis of Figure 1 . Genomic organization of CoV pp1a/pp1ab and location of the nsp14 and nsp16 mutants. The SARS-CoV genomic RNA is translated in two large polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab following a -1 ribosomal frame shift. The two polyproteins are then cleaved by viral proteases in order to produce 16 nsps (nsp1 to nsp11 from pp1a and nsp1 to nsp16 from pp1ab). Positions of the point mutants used in this study are indicated. White triangles are used for positions targeting exonuclease motifs of nsp14 and black triangles are used for positions targeting MTase motifs of nsp14 and nsp16 (the putative AdoMet binding site of nsp14 and catalytic tetrad of nsp16). doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1000863.g001",

SARS-CoV replicates and transcribes its large RNA genome using a membrane-bound enzyme complex containing a variety of viral nonstructural proteins. A critical step during RNA synthesis is the addition of a cap structure to the newly produced viral mRNAs, ensuring their efficient translation by host cell ribosomes. Viruses generally acquire their cap structure either from cellular mRNAs (e.g., ''cap snatching'' of influenza virus) or employ their own capping machinery, as is supposed to be the case for coronaviruses. mRNA caps synthesized by viruses are structurally and functionally undistinguishable from cellular mRNAs caps. In coronaviruses, methylation of mRNA caps seems to be essential, since mutations in viral methyltransferases nsp14 or nsp16 render non-viable virus. We have discovered an unexpected key role for SARS-CoV nsp10, a protein of previously unknown function, within mRNA cap methylation. Nsp10 induces selective 29Omethylation of guanine-N7 methylated capped RNAs through direct activation of the otherwise inactive nsp16. This finding allows the full reconstitution of the SARS-CoV mRNA cap methylation sequence in vitro and opens the way to exploit the mRNA cap methyltransferases as targets for anti-coronavirus drug design.",

In view of the phenotype of some mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) mutants, a role in viral RNA synthesis was postulated [11, 39] , but other studies implicated nsp10 in replicase polyprotein processing [40] .

The SARS-CoV nsp10/nsp14/nsp16 trio constitutes an attractive target package for antiviral drug discovery and design; and indeed nsp14 and nsp16 seem to play an important role in viral replication [11, 17, 30] . Accordingly, we set up sensitive inhibition tests for both activities, validated by low IC 50 values of known AdoMetdependent MTase inhibitors. Moreover, we show that aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA), which was shown to inhibit SARS-CoV replication [41] , targets both MTases indeed.",

SARS-CoV nsp14 has been shown to be an RNA-cap N7-MTase [17] . Sequence motifs that are canonical in 29O-MTases were identified in nsp16 [3, 19] , but the experimental verification of the MTase activity has not been reported, in contrast to FCoV nsp16, for which a rather low activity could be demonstrated [18] . SARS-CoV nsp10 was previously shown to interact with both nsp14 and nsp16 [35, 36] , suggesting its involvement in RNA capping and/or methylation. Consequently, we cloned and expressed both nsp10 and nsp16 in E. coli and purified both recombinant proteins, using their N-terminal His 6 -tag, by metal affinity chromatography. Nsp14 was expressed as a fusion protein with an intein tag at its Cterminus. The nsp14-intein product was bound to a chitin affinity column and the untagged protein was eluted after removal of the tag by DTT treatment. All three proteins were further purified by size exclusion chromatography. Upon SDS-PAGE, the purified proteins migrated as single bands corresponding to their expected molecular masses (nsp14: 57 kDa; His 6 -nsp16: 35 kDa, and His 6 -nsp10: 15 kDa) (Figure 2A ). The identity of the recombinant proteins was confirmed by trypsin digestion and mass spectrometry ((MALDI-TOF), data not shown).",

            "text": "Using the purified recombinant proteins, we first conducted in vitro MTase assays on short capped RNA substrates methylated or not at the N7-position of the guanine cap ( 7Me GpppAC 5 and GpppAC 5 ). We used all possible combinations of the three proteins (nsp10, nsp14, and nsp16) and incubated them with the substrate in the presence of the tritiated methyl donor [ 3 H]-AdoMet. The extent of [ 3 H]-CH 3 transfer was quantified after reaction times of 5, 30, and 240 min by using a DEAE filterbinding assay (see Materials and Methods). Figure 2B shows that nsp14 methylated GpppAC 5 in a time-dependent manner whereas neither nsp16 nor nsp10 alone did. Apparently, the activity of nsp14 was barely influenced by the presence of nsp10 or nsp16. In addition, we observed that nsp14 did not methylate 7Me GpppAC 5 ( Figure 2C ) suggesting that nsp14 methylates only the N7-position of the cap structure. In contrast to nsp14, nsp16 catalyzed methyltransfer to neither GpppAC 5 nor to 7Me GpppAC 5 under these reaction conditions. Surprisingly, when nsp16 activity assays were supplemented with nsp10, robust methylation of 7Me Gpp-pAC 5 was observed ( Figure 2C ), but not of GpppAC 5 ( Figure 2B ). In control reactions, containing either nsp10 alone or nsp10 supplemented with nsp14 no 7Me GpppAC 5 -specific MTase activity was detected ( Figure 2C ). When the GpppAC 5 substrate was incubated with a combination of nsp10, nsp14, and nsp16 ( Figure 2B ) , the level of substrate methylation was enhanced compared to reactions performed with nsp14 alone. After overnight incubation of GpppAC 5 with the three proteins, the methyl incorporation reached a plateau and the incorporation level was twice higher than after a reaction in the presence of nsp14 alone (not shown). In contrast, no significant difference was observed between the methylation level reached after incubation of the 7Me GpppAC 5 substrate with either all three proteins or the nsp16-nsp10 pair only ( Figure 2C ). Taken together, these results suggest that, (i) SARS-CoV nsp14 methylates GpppAC 5 at the N7position of the cap guanine and indeed acts as an N7-MTase on these substrates, (ii) nsp16 acts as an nsp10-dependent 29O-MTase on 7Me GpppAC 5 , (iii) the 29O-MTase activity of nsp16-nsp10 requires the presence of a cap structure already methylated at its N7-position and (iv) nsp14 and the nsp16-nsp10 pair can perform sequential double methylation of GpppAC 5 , presumably at the N7-and 29O-positions.",

The bacterial cell lysate containing these proteins was incubated with Strep-Tactin beads (see Materials and Methods), in order to bind the tagged nsp10. After extensive washing, the proteins bound to the beads were analysed using SDS-PAGE. Figure 2D indicates that nsp16 remained associated with nsp10, whereas nsp16 alone was unable to bind to the beads. These data suggest that nsp10 can stimulate the MTase activity of nsp16 by direct association resulting in the formation of a nsp10/ nsp16 complex. When the intensities of the bands corresponding to nsp10 and nsp16 were quantified, a ratio of nsp10 to nsp16 of 1.1 was obtained. Correcting for the respective molecular masses, and assuming that they bind Coomassie blue dye with the same affinity, this yields a nsp10 to nsp16 ratio of about 2.3. This suggests that the complex does not contain a large molar excess of nsp10, as one might have expected due to the fact that nsp10 seems to form dodecamers under certain conditions [38] .",

            "text": "In order to test MTase activities of nsp14 and nsp10/nsp16 on virus-specific capped RNA substrates, we synthesized a 59triphosphate-carrying RNA corresponding to the first 264 nucleotides of the SARS-CoV genome using the T7 RNA polymerase. Since the canonical T7 promoter inefficiently directs transcription of RNA beginning with an A, as is required to make transcripts resembling the 59 end of coronavirus RNAs, we used the T7 class II w2.5 promoter [43] . Additionally, we introduced a URG substitution in the 2 nd position of the RNA to increase the in vitro transcription efficiency (data not shown). The RNA was capped with [a-32 P]-GTP using the vaccinia virus (VV) capping enzyme (containing RTPase, GTase and N7-MTase activities, see Materials and Methods) in the presence or absence of the methyl donor AdoMet. The substrates GpppAG-SARS-264 and 7Me Gpp-pAG-SARS-264 were then incubated with various combinations of nsp14, nsp16, and nsp10. Reaction products were digested by nuclease P1 in order to release the RNA cap structure. Radiolabeled cap molecules were subsequently separated on TLC plates and visualized using autoradiography. The comparison with commercially available and in-house synthesized cap analogs allowed the identification of the methylation position of the cap structure. Figure 3A shows that the cap structure released after nuclease P1 digestion of substrates GpppAG-SARS-264 and 7Me GpppAG-SARS-264 RNA co-migrated, as expected, with GpppA and 7Me GpppA cap analogs, respectively. In the presence of nsp14, or the VV:N7-MTase positive control, the GpppA cap structure present at the 59 end of the RNA was converted into 7Me GpppA (left panel of Figure 3A ). We also observed that the methylation of the N7-position induced by nsp14 was weakly stimulated in the presence of nsp10, but was not influenced by the presence of nsp16. Indeed, nsp14 converts 83% of the substrate into the 7Me GpppA product, whereas in the presence of nsp10 97% of the substrate was converted, as judged by autoradiography analysis. Nsp10 or nsp16 alone did not show any MTase activity. When all three proteins are present, the substrate is fully methylated at the N7-and 29O-positions of the cap, as judged by the comparison with products generated by the bifunctional N7-and 29O-MTase domain of dengue virus protein NS5 (DV:NS5MTase), which was used as a positive control [32, 42] . The right panel of Figure 3A shows that incubation of 7Me GpppAG-SARS-264 RNA, with nsp14, nsp16 or nsp10 alone did not result in 29O-methylation of the 7Me GpppA structure. The same was true when nsp14/nsp10 or nsp14/nsp16 combinations were tested. In contrast, 29O-methylation of the cap structure of 7Me GpppAG-SARS-264 occurred upon incubation with nsp10/ nsp16, and also when all three proteins were used together. We therefore conclude that capped RNA corresponding to the first 264 nucleotides of the SARS-CoV genome represents a bona fide substrate to follow the RNA cap MTase activities of SARS-CoV nsp14 and nsp10/nsp16. Moreover, the TLC analysis allowed us to demonstrate that nsp14 indeed specifically methylates RNA cap structures at the N7-position and that nsp10/nsp16 methylates capped RNA at the 29O-position of the first nucleotide after the Figure 2 . SARS-CoV proteins nsp14, nsp16 and nsp10 purification, AdoMet-dependent MTase activity on short capped RNA and complex formation of nsp16/nsp10. Panel A: The SARS-CoV proteins nsp14, nsp16 and nsp10, purified by affinity and size exclusion chromatography (as described in Materials and Methods) were separated by SDS-PAGE (14%) and visualized by Coomassie blue staining. Lane 1 corresponds to the molecular size markers, lanes 2 to 4 to nsp14, nsp16, and nsp10, respectively. Panel B and C: AdoMet-dependent MTase assays performed on short capped RNA substrates. The different purified proteins (nsp10: 1200 nM, nsp14: 50 nM and nsp16: 200 nM) were incubated with GpppAC 5 and 7Me GpppAC 5 RNA oligonucleotides in presence of [ 3 H]-AdoMet as described in Materials and Methods. The methyl transfer to the capped RNA substrate was determined after 5-, 30-, and 240-min incubation by using a filterbinding assay (see Materials and Methods). Panel D: SARS-CoV His 6 -nsp16 protein co-expressed with strep-tag-nsp10 and His 6 -nsp16 expressed alone were incubated with Strep-Tactin sepharose. Strep-Tactin-bound protein was eluted with D-desthiobiotin and analysed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie blue staining. Lane 1 corresponds to the molecular size markers, lane 2 to strep-tag-nsp10 co-expressed with His 6 -nsp16 and lane 3 to His 6 -nsp16 alone. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1000863.g002 N7-methylated cap. As also observed when using short substrates, nsp10/nsp16 could only methylate 7Me GpppAG-SARS-264 and not GpppAG-SARS-264, suggesting that N7-methylation by nsp14 must precede 29O-methylation by nsp10/nsp16. We conclude that nsp14 exhibits N7-MTase activity in the absence of nsp10, whereas the latter is an absolute requirement for nsp16-mediated 29O-methylation of the cap structure. Nsp10, which was previously shown to interact with both nsp14 and nsp16 [35, 36] , modestly stimulates the nsp14-mediated cap N7-MTase activity ( Figure 3A and S1B; 10 to 15% increase of activity at a broad optimum around a 4-fold molar excess). In order to directly monitor the order of SARS-CoV RNA-cap methylation, we performed a time-course experiment using the GpppAG-SARS-264 substrate in conjunction with nsp10, nsp14, and nsp16. The results, shown in Figure 3B , indicate that methylation of the substrate indeed starts at the N7-position. Subsequently, the 7Me GpppA cap-0 structure is converted to an 7Me GpppA 2'OMe cap-1 structure. A GpppA 2'OMe structure was never observed in this assay, not even when using larger amounts of nsp10/nsp16 or nsp16 (data not shown), in agreement with the data presented in Figures 2B and 3A that show that GpppAC 5 and GpppAG-SARS-264 substrates are not methylated by nsp10/ nsp16. Thus, the N7-methylation of the SARS-CoV cap structure by nsp14 is a pre-requisite for its recognition by the nsp10/nsp16 pair, which then converts the cap-0 into a cap-1 structure by 29Omethylation.",

            "text": "The recent identification of the C-terminal domain of nsp14 as an N7-MTase [17] revealed that this replicase subunit is a multifunctional protein, since it also carries an exoribonuclease activity embedded in its N-terminal domain [16] . The interplay between these two functionalities was analyzed using mutagenesis experiments. We mutated conserved residues in both the MTase and the exoribonuclease domain to evaluate the possible interplay or long-range regulation of both activities. The conserved residue D 331 , which is presumably involved in AdoMet-binding, was mutated to alanine. In the exoribonuclease domain, we replaced conserved residues from exonuclease motifs I (D 90 XE 92 ), II (D 243 ) and III (D 273 and H 268 ) of the DE(A/D)D nuclease superfamily. All the His-tagged nsp14 mutant proteins could be expressed, except the D243A mutant, which was barely soluble. Figure 4A shows that they migrated at a molecular mass similar to that of wt nsp14 upon SDS-PAGE. We next analyzed their N7-MTase activity on GpppAC 5 using [ 3 H]-AdoMet as methyl donor. The results show that the D331A point mutation completely abolished nsp14 N7-MTase activity. This is in agreement with the hypothesis [17] that the MTase domain is located in the Cterminal half of nsp14 protein and that the conserved residue D 331 is important for N7-MTase function. In contrast, the mutations in the exonuclease domain did not significantly interfere with nsp14 MTase activity, excepted in the case of the motif I-double mutant (D 90 XE 92 ) which displayed attenuated N7-MTase activity (,2fold). This observation is in agreement with the fact that a Nterminal truncation of 90 amino acids of the nsp14 exoribonuclease domain abolished the N7-MTase activity in a yeast transcomplementation assay [17] . Thus an altered N-terminus of the exoribonuclease domain may still interfere with the MTase activity to a certain extent.",

We mutated the conserved residues K 46 -D 130 -K 170 -E 203, which form the canonical catalytic tetrad of mRNA cap 29O-MTases [42, 44] . The putative catalytic residues of SARS-CoV nsp16 were identified using sequence alignment with the homologous FCoV nsp16 29O-MTase and other family members [18] . Three of the four alanine point mutants could be expressed as efficiently as wt nsp16, allowing their purification to homogeneity using a single-step of affinity chromatography (see Materials and Methods). Still, smaller amounts of the fourth mutant (K46A) could also be produced and purified. We obtained sufficient soluble protein to perform MTase assays, although protein yield and purity were lower than for the other mutants ( Figure 4B ). For all mutant proteins, the 29O-MTase activity was tested on 7Me GpppAC 5 and compared to that of the wt nsp16/nsp10 control pair. The 29O-MTase activity was indeed completely abolished by any single mutation of the putative K 46 -D 130 -K 170 -E 203 catalytic tetrad residues of nsp16. This result demonstrated that although nsp10 stimulates the 29O-MTase activity by a yet unknown mechanism, the catalytic activity itself resides in nsp16.",

In order to set up sensitive N7-and 29O-MTase inhibition tests, we determined more precisely the conditions to measure optimum MTase activity for nsp14 and nsp16/nsp10 using their respective substrates GpppAC 5 and 7Me GpppAC 5 (see Text S1). We thus defined the following standard assay conditions: the N7-MTase activity of nsp14 was measured in presence of 40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 and 5 mM DTT. For the 29O-MTase assays, the same buffer was used together with 1 mM of MgCl 2 . As Figure S1B illustrates, nsp10 stimulates nsp16 29O-MTase activity in a dosedependent manner. We used a 6-fold molar excess of nsp10 over nsp16 corresponding to <75% of the maximal stimulation that could be achieved.",

N7-and 29O-MTase activities were determined by quantification of methyl transfer to the GpppAC 5 and 7Me GpppAC 5 RNA substrates, respectively. As shown in Figure 5A , 10 out of 16 tested molecules barely inhibited the SARS-CoV MTases. Cap analogs (GpppA and 7Me GpppA) showed limited (50%) inhibition capacity on both SARS-CoV MTases. In contrast, we observed that AdoHcy, sinefungin and ATA efficiently inhibited both enzymes at 100 mM. The IC 50 values of AdoHcy were 16 and 12 mM for the N7-and 29O-MTase activities, respectively (Figure 5B) ten-fold higher than Ki values reported for VV:N7-and 29O-MTases (1 and 0.5 mM, respectively, [47] ). Sinefungin, a potent inhibitor of VV:N7-and 29O-MTases with reported IC 50 values of 12.0 and 39.5 nM, respectively [46] , showed the most potent inhibition profile on nsp14 and nsp10/nsp16 with IC 50 values of 496 nM and 736 nM, respectively ( Figure 5C) . These values are similar to the IC 50 value reported for the inhibition of the 29O-MTase activity of DV:NS5MTase (420 nM [49] and 630 nM [48] ). The obtained IC 50 values of ATA for SARS-CoV nsp14 and nsp10/nsp16 were 6.4 mM and 2.1 mM, respectively ( Figure 5D ). These results demonstrate that sensitive assays are now available to discover and characterize inhibitors of the SARS-CoV N7-and 29O-MTases rendering low IC 50 values of known AdoMet-dependent MTase inhibitors like AdoHcy and sinefungin. Moreover we have shown that nsp14 and nsp16 MTases are two putative targets of ATA, that was shown to inhibit SARS-CoV replication in infected cells [41] . ",

Thus far, the predicted 29O-MTase activity of nsp16 [3, 19] could only be verified for FCoV nsp16 [18] .

In this study, we have characterized the MTase activities of both SARS-CoV nsp14 and nsp16, and in particular established that the in vitro activity of SARS-CoV nsp16 critically depends on the presence of nsp10.

This was verified using a substrate mimicking the capped 59 end of the SARS-CoV genome. Nuclease P1 enzymatic digestion and TLC analysis confirmed the position of methylation by nsp14; and mutagenesis of a predicted AdoMet binding site residue abolished N7-MTase activity. We therefore conclude that nsp14 alone can act as an AdoMet-dependent MTase that specifically targets the N7position of the cap structure, thus converting GpppRNA into 7Me GpppRNA. These results confirm and extend the recently described observations on the cap N7-MTase activity of SARS-CoV nsp14 in vitro and in a yeast-based complementation system [17] .",

We report here that SARS-CoV nsp16 forms a complex with nsp10 that is endowed with robust and long-lived MTase activity. In contrast, FCoV nsp16 by itself was shown to possess 29O-MTase activity under similar reaction conditions, but at much higher enzyme concentration (SARS-CoV: 200 nM; FCoV: 3 mM [18] ). This suggests that FCoV nsp16 might also need FCoV nsp10 for its proper activation. As in the case of FCoV nsp16, SARS-CoV nsp16 in the presence of nsp10, specifically methylates capped RNAs carrying a methyl group at the N7-guanine position, allowing the conversion of cap-0 into cap-1 structures. Using 7Me GpppAG-RNA corresponding to the 59 end of the SARS-CoV genome, we have confirmed that nsp10/nsp16 catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from the AdoMet donor to the 29O- position of the first nucleotide after the cap guanosine. Finally, the intrinsic nsp16 29O-MTase activity was corroborated by mutagenesis of its predicted, canonical catalytic tetrad K 46 -D 130 -K 170 -E 203 [3, 18, 19] .",

In this work, we propose a new function for nsp10 as a regulator of an enzyme involved in the methylation of cap structures. Our observation seems not directly related to the phenotype previously described for nsp10 mutants [11, 39, 40] . Nevertheless, RNA cap methylation defects should limit RNA stability and may therefore contribute to a decrease in viral RNA synthesis observed in MHV mutants [11, 39, 40] . Here, we show that nsp10 itself is catalytically inert in methylation reactions (Figures 2, and 3) and that it forms a complex with nsp16 ( Figure 2C ). Interestingly, whereas at least a 10-fold molar excess of nsp10 is required for maximal stimulation of nsp16 ( Figure S1B) , quantification of the protein bands of nsp10 and nsp16 in the purified complex indicates a maximum ratio of 2.3 ( Figure 2D ). We assume that, under conditions of maximal stimulation, nearly all nsp16 molecules are associated with one or two nsp10 molecules. Considering that the reaction mixture at 50% stimulation contained 200 nM of nsp16 and around 400 nM of nsp10 ( Figure S1B ), the dissociation constant of the nsp10/ nsp16 complex can roughly be estimated to be in the order of 400 nM for a 1:1 complex or 200 nM for a 2:1 complex. This is in agreement with a K d of 250 nM determined by plasmon surface resonance analysis (Lecine P. personal communication).",

Nsp10 may increase the stability of nsp16, stabilize the nsp16 RNA binding groove, contribute to RNA substrate binding and/ or allosterically regulate its substrate affinity and activity. Similar activation of an MTase involved in the capping pathway was previously reported for the VV capping enzyme [54] . The catalytic efficiency of the N7-MTase domain of the VV:D1 protein was 370-fold stimulated by addition of an equimolar concentration of the small VV:D12 protein, which does not contain any catalytic residues [55] . Activation is achieved through increase of substrate and co-substrate affinity as well as of the turn over number. At the same time, VV:D12 exerts a stabilizing effect on VV:D1 [55] . The determination of the crystal structure of the protein complex VV:D1/D12 [56] revealed that the VV:D12 protein is structurally homologous to the cap 29O-MTase of reovirus, with a truncation of the AdoMet binding domain. The SARS-CoV nsp10 crystal structure did not reveal any similarity to an MTase fold nor to any protein in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) [37, 38] , but the activating effect of nsp10 on nsp16 might also be exerted on different levels via allosteric activation by increasing substrate affinity and/or turn over number, and/or by stabilization of nsp16.",

Interestingly, several MTases have previously been shown to be regulated through specific interactions with Zn finger domains [58, 59] . Since the first Zn finger of nsp10 lies in a positively charged surface patch, it might be involved in the low affinity interaction of nsp10 with single-and double-strand RNA and DNA [37] . The affinity of nsp10 for single-stranded RNA appears too weak to explain a direct role in RNA recruitment for nsp16 [36] . We expect that SARS-CoV nsp16 contains a specific binding site for a cap-0 structure followed by a small stretch of 3 to 4 nucleotides as predicted for FCoV nsp16 from enzymatic assays [18] . The formation of the complex nsp10/nsp16 might provide a longer substrate-binding site and in that way enhance affinity of nsp16 for its RNA substrate. Nevertheless, given the fact that the full activation effect by nsp10 is also seen when short substrates containing the cap and 5 nucleotides are used, we surmise that extension of the RNA binding site is of minor importance.

The CoV cap structure methylation seems to follow the ''classic'' sequence of N7-methylation preceding the 29O-methylation. The modular structure of two separate single-domain enzymes corresponds to the scenario in metazoan and plants [25, 26] . It contrasts to dsRNA reoviruses where one multi-domain protein contains two MTase domains [60] and to flaviviruses and negative-strand RNA ((-) RNA) vesiculoviruses where both MTase activites reside in a single domain of larger proteins and use a single active site [32, 61] . A characteristic feature of CoV MTases is that nsp14 recognizes non-methylated RNA cap exclusively, and nsp10/nsp16 recognizes N7-methylated RNA cap exclusively. In contrast, bifunctional MTases recognize both non-methylated and methylated cap structures with equal affinity [48, 62, 63] . Interestingly, the flaviviral N7-MTase activity is regulated by specific 59-proximal viral RNA secondary structures and both N7-and 29O-MTase activities seem to require in particular the terminal dinucleotide AG [32, 64] . Since the SARS-CoV nsp14 N7-MTase activity can complement N7-MTase defects in yeast, [17] , it suggests that specific sequences and/or RNA structures are not required for this activity. This was confirmed in our in vitro assays, where both N7and 29O-methylation was observed using small GpppAC 5 RNA substrates that do not correspond to the natural sequence present at the 59 end of CoV mRNAs. Nevertheless, the CoV capping machinery is likely to act specifically on viral mRNA substrates, which present a common 59-terminal leader sequence (72 nucleotides long in the case of SARS-CoV [4] ). The mechanism to achieve this selectivity may depend on the GTase reaction or on the fine regulation of capping enzymes by protein-protein interactions within the replication and transcription complex. The regulation of the 29O-MTase activity of nsp16 by the small nsp10 protein is clearly an original feature of CoV mRNA cap methylation.",

For many of them, including coronaviruses [17, 30] , it has been shown that mutations abolishing the N7-MTase activity have a clear detrimental effect on replication [32] , whereas 29O-MTase knockouts exerted more moderate effects [32, 33] . These observations suggest that compounds specifically inhibiting cap MTases could be potent antiviral agents. Although some viral MTase inhibitors have also been reported to inhibit mammalian MTases [70, 71] , sinefungin or other AdoMet analogs might have higher specificity towards viral MTases. Accordingly, it has been shown that sinefungin inhibits fungal mRNA cap N7-MTases with 5 to 10 times more potency than the human isoform [71] .",

We confirmed this by obtaining low IC 50 values of known AdoMet-dependent MTase inhibitors AdoHcy and sinefungin. Furthermore, we found that ATA, a compound previously reported as a putative blocker of the catalytic site of NS5MTase of flaviviruses [52] , and of SARS-CoV replication in infected cells [41] , inhibited both SARS-CoV MTase activities with IC 50 values of 2.1 and 6.4 mM, respectively.

In the standard assay, nsp10, nsp14, and nsp16 were added at final concentrations of 1.2 mM, 50 nM, and 200 nM, respectively. The final concentrations of nsp14 and nsp16 used in the assays were chosen so as to stay in the linear phase of product formation after a 1 h incubation when using GpppAC 5 or 7Me GpppAC 5 as substrates. A 6-fold molar excess of nsp10 over nsp16 was chosen to achieve about 75% of the maximal stimulation of 29O-MTase activity. Under these conditions, the nsp14 and nsp10/nsp16 methylation reactions converted similar amounts of substrate after 1 h of reaction. No sign of protein inactivation was found up to the apparent end of the linear phase. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 30uC and stopped after the indicated times by a 10-fold dilution of the reaction mixture in 100 mM ice-cold AdoHcy. Samples were kept on ice and then transferred to glass-fiber filtermats (DEAE filtermat; Wallac) by a Filtermat Harvester (Packard Instruments). Filtermats were washed twice with 0.01 M ammonium formate, pH 8.0, twice with water, and once with ethanol, dried, and transferred into sample bags. Betaplate Scint (Wallac) scintillation fluid was added, and the methylation of RNA substrates was measured in counts per minute (cpm) by using a Wallac 1450 MicroBeta TriLux liquid scintillation counter. For inhibition assays, we set up the reactions as described above with 7Me GpppAC 5 for nsp16 and GpppAC 5 for nsp14 in the presence of 100 mM inhibitor candidate. Enzymes and RNA substrates were mixed with the inhibitor before the addition of AdoMet to start the reaction. The final concentration of DMSO in the reaction mixtures was below 5%, and control reactions were performed in presence of DMSO, which does not alter MTase activity. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 30uC for 4 h and analyzed by filter binding assay as described above. The IC 50 (inhibitor concentration at 50% activity) value of AdoHcy, sinefungin and ATA were determined using Kaleidagraph. Data were adjusted to a logistic dose-response function, % activity = 100/(1+[I]/IC 50 ) b , where b corresponds to the slope factor and [I] corresponds to the inhibitor concentration [73] .",

Labeled substrates G*pppAG-264 or 7Me G*pppAG-264 RNA (the asterisk indicates the labeled phosphate) were incubated alone or in presence of the indicated proteins, digested by nuclease P1 and analyzed by TLC. The origins and the positions of standards GpppA, 7Me GpppA, 7Me GpppA 2'OMe and GpppA 2'OMe (see Materials and Methods) are indicated by black arrows.
