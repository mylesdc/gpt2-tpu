Previously we constructed E1 and E2 epitope maps using murine monoclonal antibodies (mMAbs). Six E2 epitopes (E2 c,d,e,f,g,h ) bound VEEV-neutralizing antibody and mapped to amino acids (aa) 182-207. Nothing is known about the human antibody repertoire to VEEV or epitopes that engage human virusneutralizing antibodies. There is no specific treatment for VEE; however virus-neutralizing mMAbs are potent protective and therapeutic agents for mice challenged with VEEV by either peripheral or aerosol routes. Therefore, fully human MAbs (hMAbs) with virus-neutralizing activity should be useful for prevention or clinical treatment of human VEE.",

While VEEV causes high-titered viremia in equines, resulting in encephalitis with a mortality rate between 30 to 90%, disease in humans is usually self-limited and consists of fever, chills, malaise, and severe headaches, with 1 to 4% progressing to severe encephalitis [2] . Outbreaks of epizootic VEEV (subtypes 1AB and 1C) occur periodically in South and Central America, even spreading to south Texas, and therefore it is considered an emerging pathogen [3] . While the last major transcontinental outbreak of epizootic VEEV occurred in 1969-1971, smaller South and Central American outbreaks of VEEV 1C have occurred since, such as the one in Colombia and Venezuela in 1995-1996 [4, 5] . In the mid to late 1990's outbreaks caused by the usually enzootic subtype VEEVs occurred in Peru and Panama (VEEV-1D), and in the Mexican states of Chiapas and Oaxaca (VEEV-1E) [6] [7] [8] [9] .",

In this report we have presented a map of the human VEEV antibody response and determined the human immunodominant epitopes on the VEEV E1 and E2 proteins. We used phage-display technology to isolate VEEVspecific hFabs from bone marrow donors known to have circulating antibodies for VEEV [44] [45] [46] [47] . We have characterized a panel of 11 hFabs for VEEV surface protein specificity, subtype cross-reactivity, and in vitro virus-neutralizing capacity. Two anti-E2 hFabs, H6 and F5, one of which (F5) exhibited potent neutralizing activity, were converted to fully human IgG1 molecules. Two F5 hMAb neutralization-escape VEEV variants were isolated. Sequencing of the E1 and E2 protein genes of these variant viruses identified a unique human VEEV neutralization domain as the likely binding site of the F5 hMAb. Alphavirus cryoEM maps, with associated markers, support proposing a probable surface-accessible location on VEEV E2 for the F5 native (n) IgG binding site.",

Fab LR3H11 was assigned to epitope hE2 a2 based on the similarities of its ELISA titration curve to that for the anti-hE2 a1 MAb ( Figure 1 ) and its cross-reactivity (Table 1) , and on differences in HCDR3 and LCDR3 sequences ( Table 2) . LR3H11 had a generally lower level of reactivity to all the VEEV subtypes (especially subtypes 3, 5, and 6), compared to H6 eIgG. The higher reactivity level of H6 eIgG compared to Fab LR3H11 could be due to the fact that H6 is a complete IgG molecule. Although the HCDR3 sequence is the same for LR3H11 and the anti-hE2 b Fabs, the LCDR3 sequences are completely different ( Table 2 ). The three anti-hE2 b Fabs, KR2A3, KR2B12, and KR2C2, have identical HCDR3 sequences and the LCDR3 sequences are 44 to 100% similar ( Table 2) . Fabs KR2A3 and KR2B12 have the same sequence throughout except for one aa change in framework region 2 (Lys to Arg). In addition, this group of Fabs had a distinct reactivity profile consisting of three reactivity groups (curves) which included the following subtypes and varieties: (1) 1AB, 1C, 1D, 2; (2) 1E, 3, 5, 6; and (3) 4 ( Figure 1 ). MAb F5 nIgG had a unique cross-reactivity pattern and unique HCDR3/LCDR3 sequences as well as potent viral neutralizing activity, and was assigned to epitope hE2 c (Tables 1, 2; Figure 1 ). Fab 951 D3, which was isolated from a different bone marrow donor, also had unique HCDR3/LCDR3 sequences and a unique cross-reactivity pattern, and was assigned to epitope hE2 d (Tables 1,2; Figure 1 ).",

The vF5-3 virus had a transition from A to G at nucleotide 8906, resulting in a non-conservative amino acid change from Lys to Glu at E2 aa115. There was also a deletion of nucleotides 8918-8923, coding for Val (E2 aa119), in the parent virus. The vF5-5 virus had a silent G to A change at nucleotide 8908, followed by a deletion of nucleotides 8909-8911, which code for Lys (E2 aa116). The sequence change at E2 aa115 and deletions at E2 aa116 and 119 in these neutralization-escape variant viruses indicate that F5 binds at this site in the E2 glycoprotein. F5 nIgG neutralizing activity was somewhat more reduced with vF5-5 virus than with vF5-3, suggesting that the deletion of Lys is more disruptive for F5 binding than the Lys to Glu substitution coupled with the Val deletion found in the vF5-3 virus.",

A similar strategy was used, without much success, in an attempt to favor selection of West Nile virus hMAbs specific for domain III of the envelope glycoprotein [57] . The anti-E2 specific F5 nIgG had a 70% PRNT endpoint of 10 ng/ml, equivalent to that described for the most effective neutralizing anti-VEEV E2 mMAbs (Table 1) [33, 34] . Poorer neutralization titers for human or chimpanzee Fabs or MAbs specific for YFV, DENV4 or HAV have been reported: 0.1-3 mg/ ml, 0.2-0.6 mg/ml, and 0.5 mg/ml, respectively [58, 61, 62] . The E1-specific hFab L1A7 had a PRNT endpoint of 3 mg/ml, 300fold lower than F5. The titer might be higher for a complete IgG antibody, but typically neutralization titers for anti-E1 mMAbs are less than anti-E2 mMAbs [34] .",

In fact, no VEEV type-specific hMAbs were isolated. The methodology for generating the mMAbs was different from that used in this study, but in all studies screening was done on plate-bound, purified virus and clones were selected that had the highest level of binding by ELISA. The virus used for panning in this study was inactivated with either 0.3% or 0.05% BPL, while live virus was used in ELISAs to select mMAbs. However, the BPL-treated virus was reactive with neutralizing mMAbs in ELISA and it was assumed that neutralizing hMAbs would also bind this antigen. HMAb F5 nIgG was originally selected using 0.3% BPL-treated virus, but it was later discovered that its binding to live virus was 50-75% greater (Table S2) ; therefore, the amount of BPL used was decreased to 0.05%, which improved F5 binding (data not shown). The fact that the binding of mMAbs was not affected by treating virus with 0.3% BPL, but binding of hMAb F5 was affected, suggests that epitopes recognized by the VEEV neutralizing mMAbs and hMAb F5 may not be the same.",

Both F5 nIgG and 3B4C-4 are potent neutralizing MAbs while neither H6 eIgG nor G1eIgG have biological activity, so in this case high affinity was not necessarily correlated with neutralization capacity. CBA analysis indicated that the hE2 c epitope defined by F5 nIgG does not spatially overlap any of the other epitopes defined by the panel of hFabs ( Table 3) . The cross-reactivity profile of this hMAb was also unique (Table 1, Figure 1 ). CBA results comparing F5 and a panel of mMAbs important in defining a major VEEV E2 neutralization domain suggested that epitopes mE2 d and mE2 f were spatially near epitope hE2 c based on reciprocal competition patterns ( Table 4 ). The mE2 f epitope has been mapped to residue E2-183, but mE2 d has not yet been mapped [36] . However, in the original description of this neutralization domain defined by mMAbs, there was no direct competition between mE2 d and mE2 f [33] . Further analysis revealed that F5 neutralized all four mMAb neutralization-escape variant viruses to the same degree as the parent VEEV TC-83, indicating that binding of F5 was not affected by an aa change at either E2-182, -183, -199 or -207, providing important evidence that F5 recognized a different E2 epitope than any of the four neutralizing mMAbs used to generate the variant viruses (Table 5) .",

            "text": "We isolated two neutralization-escape variant viruses of F5 nIgG, vF5-3 and vF5-5, and sequenced their structural protein genes to locate the theoretical binding site of this hMAb. Based on the aa changes in the variant viruses, F5 binding was mapped to aa residues E2-115 to 119 ( Table 7) . The aa deletions and substitution in vF5-5 and vF5-3 viruses alter the net charge or degree of hydrophilicity in this E2 region, possibly affecting the accessibility of this epitope for antibody binding. Variant virus vF5-5 was more resistant than vF5-3 to neutralization with F5, although both variant viruses required significantly more MAb for neutralization than required for VEEV TC-83 (Table 6) . We also tested whether or not the humanized mMAb Hy4 IgG, specific for the mE2 c epitope, could neutralize these two variant viruses. If the binding sites for F5 and Hy4 are different, it would be expected that Hy4 would neutralize both F5 variant viruses. However, only vF5-3 was neutralized, and vF5-5 was as resistant to neutralization by Hy4 as it was to F5. This rather puzzling result, in addition to the reciprocal competition between F5 and the anti-E2 f mMAb, might suggest some type of interaction or induced conformational change between the neutralization domains located at E2 aa182-207 and E2 aa115-119. Of course the possibility cannot be excluded that the detected mutations are not the contact residues for F5, but that these amino acid substitutions or deletions induce distant conformational changes that affect MAb binding. The identification of a novel neutralization domain on the VEEV E2 glycoprotein is analogous to the identification of a second neutralization domain on SV, identified using anti-E2c MAbs R6 and R13 neutralization-escape variant viruses that contained a coding change at either E2 aa62, 96, or 159 [68] . It was proposed that these E2 residues that formed an alternative neutralization site could be folded to form a binding site with the surface dimensions of approximately 600-750 \u00c5 , measurements similar to those determined for the interaction of lysozyme-anti-lysozyme immune complexes [69] . Transposoninsertion mutagenesis of SV resulted in a virus with an insertion at E2-119 that was less efficiently neutralized by SV mMAbs 202 (anti-E2ab) and 209 (anti-E2c) [70] . Similarly, a variant of RRV, attenuated in mice, had five E2 aa differences compared to wild-type at positions 3, 67, 119, 251, and 302 [39] . Residue 251 lies in the major neutralization domain, whereas residues 67 and 119 were proposed to influence neutralization efficiency in the variant virus. Examination of VEEV E2 mutations that affect virus binding to heparan sulfate led to a proposal that E2 residues 76 and 116 may form a conformational, surfaceaccessible epitope, but its involvement with virus neutralization is unknown [71] .",

            "text": "Although the crystal structure of the alphavirus E2 glycoprotein has not been solved, cryoEM reconstructions of E2 have been reported [25, 30, 72] . The 9\u00c5 resolution cryoEM map of the SV E2 presented by Mukhopadhyay et al. [72] was annotated with markers representing locations of glycosylation sites, the protein N-terminus, and a neutralizing Fab binding site. We have adapted their figure to show the probable surfaceaccessible location of the hMAb F5 nIgG binding site (E2 aa115-119) and its relationship with other markers (Figure 3A,B) . Mapping of this epitope to a unique E2 neutralization site was based on the data presented in this study: (1) epitope binding by hMAb F5 nIgG was more sensitive to 0.3% BPL treatment than epitopes recognized by neutralizing mMAbs, (2) hMAb F5 was able to neutralize all anti-VEEV mMAb neutralization escape variant viruses and therefore did not bind to E2 residues 182-207, defined as the ''critical'' neutralization domain, and (3) hMAb F5 neutralization escape variant viruses vF5-3 and vF5-5 defined a neutralization epitope involving E2 aa115-119. Results from studies in mice using VEEV E2 synthetic peptides as vaccines have been included in the proposed map of the E2 ectodomain to complement the placement of the hE2 c epitope ( Figure 3B ). Previously, we identified two peptide vaccines, VE2pep01 (E2 aa1-25) and VE2pep13 (E2 aa241-265) that protected mice from virulent VEEV challenge [73] [74] [75] . We also isolated an anti-peptide MAb, 1A2B-10, specific for E2 aa1-19, which passively protected mice challenged with VEEV varieties 1AB, 1C, and 1D [76] . None of the anti-peptide antibodies, either polyclonal or monoclonal, had virus-neutralizing activity, indicating that their cognate peptides were not likely to be surface-accessible or lacked the appropriate conformation. The proposed configuration of the E2 molecule shown in Fig. 3B places the hE2 c epitope (E2 aa115-119) on the surface of the spike above the more cryptic locations of the E2 N-terminus (VE2pep01) and aa 241-265 (VE2pep13). Such an arrangement would be in agreement with the current knowledge of the structure of the E2 glycoprotein, the location of specific markers, and functional attributes of specified epitopes. We are now in collaboration to obtain structural data on Fab-virion complexes to determine actual binding sites of F5 nIgG and other human and murine MAbs.",

            "text": "The VEEV neutralizing ability of the hMAb F5 nIgG is similar to that exhibited by the humanized mMAb Hy4 IgG. When administered prophylactically, as little as 100 ng of Hy4 was able to protect 90% of mice challenged intraperitoneally with virulent VEEV [43] . In addition, Hy4 given one or 24 h after VEEV infection cured 90% or 75% of infected mice, respectively. F5 nIgG would be expected to be as effective an immunotherapeutic as Hy4 IgG. Administration of a cocktail of the two MAbs, which bind to different epitopes, could provide increased protection against generating virulent VEEV neutralization-escape variants in vivo. Figure S2 Schematic presentation of conversion of Fabs to engineered IgG (eIgG). A fragment containing mammalian control elements was inserted into each Fab at Not I and Xho I sites in the PAX243 Fab vector. The Sfi I to Age I fragment containing the light chain, mammalian control elements, and the heavy chain was transferred to an IgG expression vector containing mammalian elements upstream of the light chain as well as IgG CH1, hinge, CH2, and CH3 regions downstream from the heavy chain. Final construct of eIgG retained the engineered Xba I, Sac I, and Xho I sites.

This conversion was done in a 3 step process: (1) Hind III in the mammalian control elements for the heavy chain was changed to Asc I by site-specific mutagenesis and overlap PCR. (2) Xba I and Sac I sites from the light chain and the Xho I site from the heavy chain were converted to native sequences by site-specific mutagenesis and overlap PCR. ",
