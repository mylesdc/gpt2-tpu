Combining the signal transducer and catalyzed hairpin assembly (CHA)-based signal amplification, the target DNA binds with the hairpin DNA to form a new nucleic acid sequence and creates a toehold in the transducer for initiating the recycle amplification reaction of CHA. The catalyzed assembly process produces a large amount of G-rich DNA. In the presence of hemin, the G-rich DNA forms G-quadruplex/hemin complex and mimic horseradish peroxidase activity, which catalyzes a colorimetric reaction. Under optimal conditions, the calibration curve of synthetic target DNA has good linearity from 50 pM to 200 nM with a detection limit of 32 pM. This strategy has been successfully applied to detect S. pneumoniae as low as 156 CFU mL \u22121 , and shows a good specificity against closely related streptococci and major pathogenic bacteria. In addition, the developed method enables successful visual analysis of S. pneumoniae in clinical samples by the naked eye. Importantly, this method demonstrates excellent assay versatility for sensitively detecting oligonucleotides or aptamer-recognized targets.",

            "text": "Numerous analytical methods have been developed for detection of S. pneumoniae. Conventional culture method is reliable, but time-consuming, and it sometimes compromises by spontaneous autolysis or antibiotic treatment. In addition, direct pneumococcal antigen detection, including ELISA and a rapid immunochromatographic test (Binax NOW S. pneumoniae urinary antigen test), has a poor sensitivity and specificity. Moreover, urine antigen-based testing can be positive for weeks after the onset of infection 5, 6 . Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) frequently applied is independent of bacterium viability and has distinct advantage in sensitivity 7 . But PCR wide application has been limited by its false positivity and the low resolution of post-PCR analysis by gel electrophoresis 8 . Real-time quantitative PCR can provide a higher sensitivity 9 . However, it requires sophisticated, expensive equipments and highly trained analysts in a well maintained laboratory 10 . Compared with these methods, colorimetric sensors have recently attracted special attention owing to their extreme simplicity and the visual detection in homogeneous solution without any immobilization, separation and washing steps. In this study, colorimetric detection is based on repetitive guanine rich sequence motifs, which can form G-quadruplex/ hemin complex (DNAzyme) in the presence of hemin. DNAzyme, having the mimic horseradish peroxidase activity 9,11,12 , possesses higher thermal stability that can be denatured and renatured for many cycles without losing catalytic activities. Thus, DNAzyme can catalyze the conversion of a colorless 2, 2\u2032 -azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS 2\u2212 ) to a green ABTS \u221213 .",

The two hairpins (H1 and H2) do not initially interact with each other but can catalytically form a duplex in the presence of unstructured domain b and c. The unstructured domain e and f of H1 are able to form G-quadruplex. When domain e is hidden in the stem of H1, the G-quadruplex cannot be formed at this time. In the presence of target, the loop can hybridize with the target, forming a rigid duplex and disrupting the stem formed by domain b*and b. The liberated b and c further open H1, leading to the formation of toehold for strand displacement by H2. Then H2 hybridizes with the unfolded H1 and releases the complex of T0 and H0 (T0-H0) into next circulation. As a result, the generated abundant G-quadruplex structures are proportional to targets. The G-quadruplex structure can strongly bind with hemin to form the DNAzyme, displaying peroxidase-like activity, catalyzing oxidation of ABTS 2\u2212 to ABTS \u2212 .",

After incubation with hemin for 40 min, the absorbance of different mixtures was recorded. As shown in Fig. 2A , the system containing H1 exhibited very weak characteristic absorption peak at 418 nm ( Fig. 2A , curve a). Compared with curve a, there was almost no change in the mixture of H1 and H2 ( Fig. 2A, curve b) . Upon the addition of H0 to the H1, H2 system, a slight increase in absorption peak was detected ( Fig. 2A, curve c) . The results demonstrated that H0 can trigger weak interaction of H1 and H2 to form a small amount of self-assembly product, resulting in background signal. When the mixture of 500 pM T0, H0 and H1 was incubated together, the absorbance increased slightly ( Fig. 2A , curve d), indicating that T0 can trigger the self-assembly of H0 and H1, forming a certain amount of G-quadruplex structures. But in the presence of T0 and H2 ( Fig. 2A , curve e), the amplified signal was about 282% of that without H2 ( Fig. 2A, curve d) . Such significant signal enhancement clearly indicates that the cycling amplification strategy can be executed with the aid of hairpin H2. The insets of Fig. 2A show the corresponding photographs of the colorimetric responses.",

To avoid the signal increase induced by nonspecific background amplification, the signal-to-noise ratio is used to evaluate the sensitivity of the assay. The maximum value of signal-to-noise ratio was achieved at the H0 concentration of 100 nM (Fig. 3A) . The concentration of H1 was also critical parameter affecting the analytical performance.

Previous studies 24, 30 have shown that the aptamer can be used in conjugation with catalyzed hairpin assembly for the detection of non-nucleic-acid analytes. Therefore, based on the developed colorimetric strategy, Salmonella Typhimurium has been successfully detected using transducer with the similar circuit's module. The principle of detecting Salmonella Typhimurium is illustrated in Fig. 6A . We design an aptamer beacon in which an anti-Salmonella Typhimurium aptamer 27 , Apt, is inhibited by a complementary strand, Inh. Apt contains the toehold (domain b and c) for initiating the amplification reaction, and Inh can block the catalyst region. When Apt is bound with Inh, it can neither bind Salmonella Typhimurium nor catalyze the hybridization of H1 and H2. In contrast, free Apt can do both. As a result, when the Salmonella Typhimurium binds to and stabilizes Apt, it shifts the equilibrium so that the duplex with Inh is destabilized and the single-stranded toehold is available to activate the amplification reaction. As shown in Fig. 6B , the cultured three Salmonella Typhimurium were inoculated into PBS with different concentrations from 0 to 8 \u00d7 10 7 CFU mL \u22121 (with 1:4 dilution), respectively. Upon addition of Salmonella Typhimurium with increasing concentration, the intensity of absorbance increased successively. The RSD of the intra-assay and inter-assay precisions were 5.0% and 7.6%, respectively. The results indicate that the developed method possesses the potential as a pragmatic tool for Salmonella Typhimurium direct detection in real samples. Furthermore, the amplification strategy can be used for detection different targets by means of changing the corresponding complementary target DNA or aptamer strands, demonstrating versatile and potential colorimetric sensing platform.",

This strategy has been successfully used for detection of oligonucleotide and Salmonella Typhimurium. It can conveniently be extended to a wide range of analytes with available affinity ligands. This developed method shows excellent analytical performance with satisfactory versatility for different analytes. In addition, the proposed strategy possesses good reproducibility and acceptable accuracy for clinical practical sample analysis, and provides a label-free, enzyme-free, low-cost, visual, simple, rapid, sensitive and specific platform for clinical diagnostics.",

The mixture was first incubated in TNaK buffer for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C to allow the hairpin structure to be opened. After that, 50 \u03bc L of H1 (500 nM) and 50 \u03bc L of H2 (400 nM) was added the above mixture to give the final concentrations of 125 nM and 100 nM, respectively. And further incubation in TNaK buffer for 20 min at 37 \u00b0C. Subsequently, 3 \u03bc M of hemin was introduced to the resulted solution and incubated for 40 min at room temperature. Finally, 200 uL of ABTS 2\u2212 (4 mM) and 1 \u03bc L of 30% H 2 O 2 were added to the mixture and mixed completely. The mixture was added into square quartz cuvettes, and the absorption spectra were collected from 500 to 400 nm on a UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV-2550, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). The rate of the peroxidase-mimicking reaction was monitored at 418 nm. All measurements were conducted at room temperature.",
