Endomyocardial biopsy shows a sensitivity of 43-64% and an overall complication rate of 6% with a 0.4% incidence of death due to perforation [6] . Another diagnostic modality that has been used is radiolabeled antimyosin antibody which can identify myocarditis but is non-specific as it detects myocardial necrosis from any cause and has a sensitivity of 67% and specificity of 63% [7, 8] . A third option involves the use of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR). This modality can find myocardial edema and myocyte damage non-invasively showing a characteristic pattern of contrast enhancement in patients with myocarditis [8] . However, in patients with infraction, it will show sub-endocardial enhancement, rather than enhancement originating from the epicardium and sparing the sub-endocardial layer as seen in myocarditis [8] . Unfortunately, the use of these diagnostic tests is not at all times beneficial, not available at many facilities, and only necessary when medical management does not show a clinical improvement in the patient's symptoms.",
