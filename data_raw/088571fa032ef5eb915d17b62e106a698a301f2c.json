The lack of a licensed vaccine or treatment options emphasize the need to obtain more insight into the viral life cycle and CHIKV-host interactions. Infectious cDNA clones are important tools for such studies, and for mechanism of action studies on antiviral compounds. Existing CHIKV cDNA clones are based on a single genome from an individual clinical isolate, which is expected to have evolved specific characteristics in response to the host environment, and possibly also during subsequent cell culture passaging. To obtain a virus expected to have the general characteristics of the recent E1-226V CHIKV isolates, we have constructed a new CHIKV full-length cDNA clone, CHIKV LS3, based on the consensus sequence of their aligned genomes. Here we report the characterization of this synthetic virus and a green fluorescent protein-expressing variant (CHIKV LS3-GFP). Their characteristics were compared to those of natural strain ITA07-RA1, which was isolated during the 2007 outbreak in Italy. In cell culture the synthetic viruses displayed phenotypes comparable to the natural isolate, and in a mouse model they caused lethal infections that were indistinguishable from infections with a natural strain. Compared to ITA07-RA1 and clinical isolate NL10/152, the synthetic viruses displayed similar sensitivities to several antiviral compounds. 3-deaza-adenosine was identified as a new inhibitor of CHIKV replication. Cyclosporin A had no effect on CHIKV replication, suggesting that cyclophilins -opposite to what was found for other +RNA viruses-do not play an essential role in CHIKV replication. The characterization of the consensus sequence-based synthetic viruses and their comparison to natural isolates demonstrated that CHIKV LS3 and LS3-GFP are suitable and representative tools to study CHIKV-host interactions, screen for antiviral compounds and unravel their mode of action.",

The 59 ORF encodes the nonstructural polyproteins P123 and P1234. The latter results from translational read-through of an opal termination codon that is present at the end of the nonstructural protein (nsP) 3 coding sequence of most CHIKV isolates. Assuming that CHIKV follows the typical alphavirus life cycle, proteolytic processing of the nonstructural polyproteins by the protease domain in nsP2 will ultimately lead to the release of nsP1, nsP2, nsP3, and nsP4. These nsPs and their precursors possess a variety of functions and the enzymatic activities, including protease, helicase, methyltransferase, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity that drive CHIKV replication [5] . In addition to replication of its genomic RNA, CHIKV also transcribes a subgenomic (sg) RNA encoding a precursor polyprotein that is processed by viral and cellular proteases into the structural proteins C, E3, E2, 6K and E1. CHIKV nsPs willpresumably together with host factors -assemble into replication and transcription complexes (RTCs) that associate with membrane structures derived from the plasma membrane and/or endosomes, as observed for other alphaviruses [5] [6] [7] .",

Later studies suggested that recent Indian and Indian Ocean epidemics have emerged separately as the result of at least three independent events, and that convergent evolution of East-Central-South African lineage strains in different geographical regions ultimately led to the emergence of strains with the A226V substitution in E1 [10] [11] [12] [13] . More recently, other amino acid positions and epistatic interactions were also shown to play an important role in the emergence of these new CHIKV variants, which are now even replacing endemic strains that have been circulating in Asia for decades [14] . Aedes albopictus also thrives in more temperate climates and its geographical distribution has rapidly expanded. Over the past decades, parts of southern Europe and large areas of the USA have been invaded by this mosquito, providing imported cases of CHIKV with a competent mosquito vector, thus paving the road for outbreaks in nonendemic-areas such as the USA and Europe. Indeed, autochthonous infections have been reported from Italy in 2007 and France in 2010 [15, 16] . The recent and ongoing CHIKV outbreaks are characterized by their rapid geographical spread, high numbers of infected people and high morbidity, emphasizing the need to gain more insight into the replicative cycle of this important human pathogen.",

Each natural isolate is expected to have evolved its own specific characteristics in terms of sequence, virulence and virus-host interactions as a result of specific selective pressures within the infected host (tissue) and possibly also during subsequent passaging in cell culture. Intrahost evolution and quasispecies diversity is expected to be substantial, especially compared to the relatively low level of interhost variation when the consensus sequences of CHIKV genomes isolated from different hosts are aligned. The low level of interhost variation is a typical trait of arboviruses, due to evolutionary constraints imposed by the alternating replication in vertebrate and arthropod hosts. A recent study on the distantly related Ross River virus indeed reported a high level of intrahost diversity [24] . The existing CHIKV molecular clones can be considered to represent a single individual genome (or fragments of several individual genomes) out of the whole spectrum of viruses present in the CHIKV quasispecies population that has been shaped by intrahost evolution and probably a complex set of environmental factors. In contrast, most deposited CHIKV genome sequences represent the consensus (or master sequence) of a viral quasispecies population.",

Infections were performed in Eagle's minimal essential medium (EMEM; Lonza) with 25 mM HEPES (Lonza) supplemented with 2% FCS, L-glutamine, and antibiotics. After 1 h, the inoculum was replaced with fresh culture medium. All procedures with live CHIKV were performed in a biosafety level 3 facility at the Leiden University Medical Center.",

Three DNA fragments together forming a cDNA copy of CHIKV LS3-GFP were chemically synthesized (GeneArt, Germany). Using standard cloning techniques, these fragments were assembled and cloned into the AscI-NotI sites of vector pUC19AN, a pUC19-derived plasmid in which the original polylinker was replaced by one with AscI-NcoI-EcoRV-XhoI-NotI sites. The resulting plasmid (pCHIKV-LS3-GFP) contains the genomic cDNA of CHIKV LS3-GFP directly downstream of a phi2.5 promoter and followed by a unique SpeI linearization site for DNA linearization prior to in vitro transcription. The 'wild type' synthetic pCHIKV-LS3 construct was made by deleting the 920 bp eGFP-containing SacI fragment from pCHIKV-LS3-GFP (Fig. 1) . A third variant with a duplicated subgenomic promoter and a multiple cloning site behind subgenomic promoter 1 (pCHIKV-LS3-MCS), which allows the introduction of e.g. a reporter gene, was generated by removing the 737 bp AsiSI-PacI fragment from pCHIKV-LS3-GFP. The constructs were verified by sequencing.",

A 40 nucleotide polyA tail was added to the 39 end of the consensus sequence and an A7435G point mutation was introduced to create a translationally silent SacI restriction site required for cloning. The virus encoded by the resulting sequence was termed CHIKV LS3 (GenBank accession KC149888). Variants containing a duplicated subgenomic promoter and a multiple cloning site (CHIKV LS3-MCS; GenBank KC149889) or an eGFP reporter gene (CHIKV LS3-GFP; GenBank KC149887) were also designed. The eGFP reporter gene was placed under control of the native subgenomic promoter and upstream of a second subgenomic promoter that drives expression of the viral structural polyprotein, as this configuration was previously reported to result in a more stable reporter gene expression [18] . The CHIKV cDNAs were placed downstream of a phi2.5 T7 promoter, and a unique SpeI site for linearization prior to in vitro transcription directly followed the polyA tail. The phi2.5 promoter was used because the 59 ends of capped transcripts generated from this promoter with T7 polymerase and the m 7 GpppA cap analog are identical to the 59 end of the genomes of naturally occurring CHIKV strains. In contrast, capped RNAs generated by in vitro transcription from the frequently used SP6 promoter will contain m 7 GpppG at their 59 terminus, i.e. will contain an additional 59terminal G residue. However, existing CHIKV cDNA clones that contain the SP6 promoter also efficiently yield infectious virus and it is assumed that the additional 59-terminal G residue is removed during subsequent rounds of replication. In line with this, in vitro transcribed RNA from pCHIKV-LS2, a variant of plasmid pCHIKV-LS3 in which the phi2.5 promoter was replaced with the SP6 promoter also yielded infectious virus.",

ACE2 expression is not required for CHIKV infection, but these cells were chosen because of the aforementioned advantages and the fact that they have been previously used in our lab in siRNA screens for host factors that affect corona-and arterivirus replication ( [34] ; de Wilde et al. submitted; Wannee et al., in preparation). Using these cells in similar siRNA screens with CHIKV and other alphaviruses would allow direct comparison of data sets with those obtained for corona-and arteriviruses, which could lead to the identification of common (broad spectrum) pro-and antiviral host factors.",

Comparison of the amino acid sequences of CHIKV LS3 and various natural isolates. The CHIKV LS3 amino acid sequences were aligned with those of several highly similar natural isolates, and clinical isolate NL10/152. Only amino acid differences are indicated and identity is represented by dots. The numbering is based on the sequence of LS3, which is also equal to that of LR2006_OPY1. It is important to note that -like all other CHIKV strains in this ( Fig. 3A) . Inhibition of cellular transcription with actinomycin D for 30 min. prior to metabolic labeling at 12 h p.i. revealed the contribution of viral RNA synthesis to the total signal. Fluorographic detection of 3 H-labeled RNA analyzed in denaturing gels also showed a decrease in cellular transcription during the course of the infection, while the synthesis of CHIKV RNA became clearly detectable by 6 h p.i (Fig. 3B) . Transcriptional shut-off occurred around 10-12 h p.i. and was induced by CHIKV LS3 and ITA07 with similar kinetics, although LS3 seemed to act slightly faster. To examine CHIKV-induced translational shut-off, the synthesis of 35 S-labeled viral and cellular proteins during the course of CHIKV LS3 infection was analyzed by metabolic labeling of infected 293/ACE2 cells with 35 S-Met and 35 S-Cys (Fig. 3C) . A clear shut-off of host translation was observed 8-9 h p.i. Beyond 9 h p.i. the bulk of newly produced protein appears to be of viral origin, likely C, E1, E2 and their precursors (indicated with * in Fig. 3C ). CHIKV ITA07 and LS3 induced translational host shut-off in a similar manner (only results obtained with LS3 are shown in Fig. 3C ). Both CHIKV ITA07-RA1 and the synthetic viruses established non-cytopathic persistent infections in C6/36 mosquito cells. All characterization experiments have been performed in both 293/ ACE2 and Vero E6 cells, with similar results.

The kinetics of RNA synthesis was analyzed by isolating total RNA from 293/ ACE2 cells infected with CHIKV LS3, LS3-GFP, or ITA07-RA1 at various time points post infection. Negative-and positivestranded RNAs were detected by hybridization with 32 P-labeled oligonucleotide probes (Fig. 4A ). Both negative-and positivestrand RNAs were readily detected in cells infected with the various strains starting at 6 h p.i. The negative-strand RNA was less abundant than the positive strand, it was easily detected relatively early in infection ( Fig. 4A top panel, Fig. 4B) , and appeared to decrease at later time points as has also been observed for other alphaviruses. This apparent decrease is probably not only due to degradation of minus strands, but at least partly due to a hampered detection caused by the large excess of positive-strand RNA present at late time points. This excess of positive-strand RNA competes with the radioactively labeled minus-strand specific probe. In support of this, we observed that mixing RNA isolated from CHIKV-infected cells at 6 h p.i. with in vitro transcribed positive-strand RNA reduced the amount of negative strand that could be detected (data not shown). Furthermore, when samples taken at 6 and 14 h p.i. were treated with singlestrand-specific RNase A/T1 before hybridization, the negativestrand levels at the late time point were approximately 70% of that at 6 h p.i, instead of the approximately 50% in untreated samples (data not shown). Using a positive-strand-specific probe, both the 49S genomic and 26S sgRNA could be detected, and both RNAs accumulated until 12 h p.i (Fig. 4A middle panel, Fig. 4C ). The ratio of genomic to sgRNA varied between 1:3.5 and 1:5.5 during the course of infection, similar to the ratios reported for Semliki forest virus and SINV [35] . The kinetics of RNA synthesis and RNA accumulation levels were similar in CHIKV LS3-and ITA07-RA1-infected cells. In cells infected with CHIKV LS3-GFP, the additional subgenomic RNA encoding the eGFP reporter gave rise to an extra band above the 26S RNA band, and its expression level was calculated to be approximately half of that of the 26S RNA. The individual levels of the two sgRNAs expressed by CHIKV LS3-GFP were lower than those of ITA07 or LS3, but their combined abundance was comparable to that of the viruses expressing a single sgRNA (Fig. 4C ).",

In addition, a quantitative proteomics study on CHIKV-infected cells also suggested that at 10 h p.i. the amount of nsP4 was at least 200-fold lower than that of nsP1 (Treffers, Tas, de Ru, van Veelen, Snijder and van Hemert, manuscript in preparation).",

Cyclosporin A, which through its effect on cellular cyclophilins inhibits the replication of a variety of viruses, had no specific effect on CHIKV replication, not even at a (cytotoxic) dose of 32 mM (data not shown). The compounds 3-deaza-adenosine, 6-aza-uridine, chloroquine, and mycophenolic acid were tested in CPE reduction assays with Vero E6 cells infected at an MOI of 0.005 and analyzed 4 days p.i. They were all found to inhibit CHIKV replication with IC 50 s in the low micromolar range and with minimal cytotoxicity (Fig. 9A-D) . No substantial differences were observed between the IC 50 values calculated for ITA07-RA1, LS3 and LS3-GFP. The four compounds also clearly reduced eGFP reporter gene expression in Vero E6 cells infected with CHIKV LS3-GFP (Fig. 9F) . Slightly lower IC 50 values were obtained for 6-aza-uridine and chloroquine, and a significantly higher IC 50 was observed for 3-deazaadenosine in this assay, compared to the CPE-based assay. This might be due to the mode of action of 3-deaza-adenosine and/or due to differences in experimental set-up compared to the CPEbased assay (MOI 0.05 vs. 0.005; measurement 42 h p.i. vs. 4 d p.i). Ribavirin is a known inhibitor of CHIKV replication, but in our CPE reduction assay with Vero E6 cells it was not very effective in inhibiting replication of the various strains, as IC 50 values of over 400 mM were obtained (Fig. 9E, gray lines) . This is likely due to the inefficient conversion of ribavirin to its active phosphorylated form in Vero E6 cells [39] . Therefore, we have also analyzed the effect of ribavirin in a 2-day CPE reduction assays with BHK-21 cells, which are able to metabolize ribavirin [40, 41] and found IC 50 s of 15-21 mM for the various strains. Clinical isolate NL10/152 was also included in the assays and appeared to be somewhat more sensitive to the antiviral compounds than LS3 and ITA07-RA1. However, the slower replication kinetics of this strain made it impossible to directly compare NL10/152 and LS3 in the same CPE reduction assays, despite the fact that virus yields and cytopathic effect of NL10/152 and LS3 were comparable (data not shown).",

Since the 1980s, the geographic distribution of Aedes albopictus has dramatically expanded and now also includes large parts of the USA and several European countries. This creates concern for locally transmitted outbreaks in Europe and the USA, which could be initiated by viraemic travelers arriving from countries where CHIKV is endemic, like India and Indonesia. Locally transmitted CHIKV infections have indeed already been reported from Italy in 2007 and France in 2010 [15, 16] and recent studies suggest that also the USA is at risk for locally transmitted CHIKV outbreaks [42, 43] . Besides its large medical and societal impact in endemic countries, the increased risk of CHIKV outbreaks in Europe and the USA underlines the importance of studying the replication of this important human pathogen and its interactions with the host to develop safe and effective vaccines and antiviral therapy.",

The existing CHIKV molecular clones can be considered to be derived from a single genome (or fragments of single genomes) out of the whole spectrum of viruses present in a CHIKV quasispecies population. In contrast, most of the complete CHIKV genome sequences that have been deposited in GenBank represent the consensus (or master sequence) of a viral quasispecies population. The diversity (and evolution) of a CHIKV quasispecies population has probably been shaped by the characteristics of the individual host and the specific tissue source (serum) from which it was isolated. For Ross River virus it was observed that the level of intrahost genetic variation in patient serum samples, was considerably larger than that observed at the epidemiological scale, which can be explained by the purifying selection for replication in both arthropod and vertebrate hosts [24] . Advances in sequencing techniques now allow a more detailed view on quasispecies diversity and intrahost evolution, and also for CHIKV a recent study has provided more insight into quasispecies dynamics and the effect of purifying selection by host alternation [44] . A link was observed between increased fitness as a result of alternating passaging and reduced quasispecies complexity, which restricted adaptability to novel selective pressures like antiviral treatment or antibody-mediated neutralization [44] .",

We were interested in studying the general characteristics of the life cycle and virus-host interactions of the E1-226V CHIKV strains that were circulating during the 2005-2009 outbreaks. Therefore, we have constructed a fully synthetic cDNA clone, CHIKV LS3, based on the consensus sequence of the aligned genomes of these recent E1-226V isolates, rather than on a single genome from a clinical isolate. In addition, a variant that expresses the eGFP reporter gene under control of a (duplicated) subgenomic promoter was created (CHIKV LS3-GFP). The current possibilities of gene synthesis allowed the design of these clones in silico, with sequences tailored to our requirements, e.g. already containing a reporter gene under control of a duplicated subgenomic promoter and including (translationally silent) mutations to create restriction sites that facilitate cloning and reverse genetics studies.",

These were position 7,435 at which we introduced a translationally silent restriction site (G7435A), a synonymous URC substitution at position 3,397, and position 10,670, which is a C in 68% of all deposited genomes (strains with E1-226A), while the remaining (E1-226V) strains have a U at this position. An interesting observation was that 6% of the sequenced CHIKV strains, including the prototype strains S27 and Ross, contain an arginine codon instead of the opal stop codon that is present between the nsP3-and nsP4-coding regions of most CHIKV isolates. The presence or absence of this opal codon might be influenced by the passage history of the isolate as has been observed for other alphaviruses [45] . This might also explain why the sequence of the original clinical isolate of LR2006-OPY1 (Genbank DQ443544.2) contains the opal termination codon near the end of the nsP3 coding region, while the infectious clone of this strain (Genbank EU224268.1) contains an arginine codon at this position.",

Like the natural isolate, the synthetic viruses caused cytopathic infections in Vero E6 and 293/ACE2 cells (Fig. 2E) , whereas non-cytopathic persistent infections were observed in the mosquito cell line C6/36. In vertebrate cells all strains caused a shut-off of cellular translation around 8-9 h p.i. and a strong inhibition of cellular transcription by 10-12 h p.i. The accumulation of negative-and positive-strand viral RNA, the kinetics of non-structural and structural viral protein expression, as well as the growth kinetics and plaque morphology of the synthetic viruses were indistinguishable from those of CHIKV ITA07-RA1 ( Fig. 2-6 ). In addition, the synthetic viruses caused lethal infections in 12-day old mice, with virus spreading to the brain, as observed for natural isolates (Fig. 8) . Although this demonstrates that the synthetic viruses replicate in vivo, this mouse model does not allow comparison of strains for more subtle differences in virulence and pathogenesis. The genomic stability of CHIKV LS3-GFP was assessed and after 3 passages its (consensus) sequence was found to be identical to the original in silico designed sequence. The expression of the eGFP reporter gene was stable for at least 10 passages, making the synthetic viruses suitable tools for highthroughput screens for antiviral compounds, (reverse genetics) studies into their mechanism of action, and systematic functional genomics screens for host factors affecting CHIKV replication.",

            "text": "To evaluate whether CHIKV LS3 and LS3-GFP are suitable to analyze the potency and mechanism of action of antiviral compounds, their sensitivity to a number of such compounds was determined and compared to ITA07-RA1. The lysosomotropic agent chloroquine and nucleoside analog 6-aza-uridine inhibited the replication of the synthetic viruses and natural isolates with IC 50 s that were in the same range and comparable to values previously reported by others [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] . The inhibitory effect of chloroquine on the replication of many viruses including alphaviruses has been known for decades. For CHIKV it is a useful reference compound in cell-based studies, but a small scale clinical trial on the island of La Reunion suggested it is not effective in the treatment of CHIKV infections in patients [46] . The nucleoside analog 6-aza-uridine has previously been reported to inhibit the replication of a variety of viruses, including CHIKV [47, 51] . The compound could interfere with cellular UTP metabolism and may be incorporated into CHIKV RNA, leading to chain termination and/or increased error frequency, ultimately resulting in 'error catastrophe'. Mycophenolic acid is a noncompetitive inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), causing a depletion of the intracellular guanosine pool. It is a known inhibitor of various viruses, including CHIKV [47, 52] . Ribavirin is a synthetic nucleoside analog with broad spectrum antiviral effect due to potential effects on the cellular IMPDH enzyme, viral RNA synthesis and capping [39] . However, not all cell lines are able to perform the necessary conversion of this compound to its active phosphorylated form, explaining the contradictory reports on the antiviral activity of this compound [40, 41, 53] . In our hands, ribavirin inhibited CHIKV replication in BHK-21 cells with an IC 50 of around 18 mM, while it was hardly effective in Vero E6 cells, with IC 50 values of over 400 M. The IC 50 that we obtained with BHK-21 cells is in the same range as those previously reported for the antiviral effect of ribavirin on CHIKV replication [47, 51] . Cyclosporin A, which through its effect on the cellular cyclophilins, inhibits the replication of a variety of viruses (for recent review see [54] ), had no effect on CHIKV replication. We identified 3-deaza-adenosine as a novel inhibitor of CHIKV replication with an IC 50 of approximately 6 mM and a CC 50 .50 mM. This compound has previously been identified as inhibitor of a broad spectrum of viruses, although many other +RNA viruses appeared to be rather insensitive or not affected at all (reviewed in [55] ). The antiviral activity of 3-deazaadenosine was attributed to its inhibitory effect on the cellular enzyme S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase, leading to an accumulation of S-adenosylhomocysteine, which inhibits S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methylation reactions [55] . In this manner the enzyme plays a key role in S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methylation reactions and inhibition of viral methylation reactions (e.g. of viral RNA) apparently can be achieved at compound concentrations that do not notably interfere with cellular methylation reactions. Our observation warrants a more detailed analysis of the mode of action of 3-deaza-adenosine and analogs, also to evaluate their potential for use in antiviral therapy to treat CHIKV infections. Overall, no large differences were observed between the IC 50 values calculated for ITA07-RA1, LS3 and LS3-GFP, indicating that the synthetic viruses are suitable for use in antiviral screens. For most compounds, a faster and simpler assay with CHIKV LS3-GFP reporter virus showed a good dosedependent response that correlated well with results obtained in the CPE-based assay.",
