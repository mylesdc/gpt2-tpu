            "text": "The size of von Willebrand factor (VWF), controlled by ADAMTS13-dependent proteolysis, is associated with its hemostatic activity. Many factors regulate ADAMTS13-dependent VWF proteolysis through their interaction with VWF. These include coagulation factor VIII, platelet glycoprotein 1ba, and heparin sulfate, which accelerate the cleavage of VWF. Conversely, thrombospondin-1 decreases the rate of VWF proteolysis by ADAMTS13 by competing with ADAMTS13 for the A3 domain of VWF. To investigate whether murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against human VWF affect the susceptibility of VWF to proteolysis by ADAMTS13 in vitro, eight mAbs to different domains of human VWF were used to evaluate the effects on VWF cleavage by ADAMTS13 under fluid shear stress and static/denaturing conditions. Additionally, the epitope of anti-VWF mAb (SZ34) was mapped using recombinant proteins in combination with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot analysis. The results indicate that mAb SZ34 inhibited proteolytic cleavage of VWF by ADAMTS13 in a concentration-dependent manner under fluid shear stress, but not under static/denaturing conditions. The binding epitope of SZ34 mAb is located between A1555 and G1595 in the central A2 domain of VWF. These data show that an anti-VWF mAb against the VWF-A2 domain (A1555-G1595) reduces the proteolytic cleavage of VWF by ADAMTS13 under shear stress, suggesting the role of this region in interaction with ADAMTS13.",

The adhesive activity of VWF is positively correlated with the size of the multimers in plasma [1, 2] . VWF multimer size is regulated by metalloproteinase ADAMTS13, which cleaves the central A2 domain of VWF at the Tyr1605-Met1606 bond [3] [4] . The importance of VWF proteolysis by ADAMTS13 is demonstrated in two syndromes, i.e., thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and von Willebrand disease type 2A. The former is associated with the deficiency of plasma ADAMTS13 activity, either due to congenital mutations or acquired autoantibodies [5] [6] [7] . The latter is mostly caused by mutations in the A2 domain of VWF that lead to the increased proteolysis of VWF multimers by ADAMTS13 [8, 9] .",

However, this effect was not observed under static and chemically denaturing conditions. Seven other mAbs against VWF including SZ129 and SZ130 (two mAbs against VWF A1), SZ29 (another mAb against VWF A2), SZ123 and SZ125 (two mAbs against VWF A3) and 1C1E7 and 75H4B12 (two mAbs against VWF D'D3) exhibited no effects on ADAMTS13-mediated VWF proteolysis under either shear stress or denaturing conditions. The epitope mapping shows that the epitope of SZ-34 is located within the A1555-G1595 region of the A2 domain of native VWF, suggesting that this region may directly interact with ADAMTS13. Furthermore, the mAb SZ-34 is a conformation-sensitive mAb because it preferentially binds to native VWF.

The mAb VP-1, which was directly against residues 1591-1605 (inside VWF A2 domain) of VWF polypeptide, inhibited the susceptibility of the recombinant type 2A VWF mutants R1606W and R1606Q to proteolytic cleavage by ADAMTS13 under the static condition. But they did not examine whether VP-1 inhibited native pVWF or wild-type recombinant VWF proteolysis by ADAMTS13 [15] . Because VP-1 was raised against the synthetic VWF peptide (residues 1591-1605) and reacted poorly with the intact subunit (250 kDa fragment) of VWF in reduced SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting [3, 15] , we speculated that VP-1 could not bind to native VWF and could not affect its proteolysis by ADAMTS13 without denaturization or under shear stress. In addition, Zanardelli et al [16] reported the inhibition of VWF proteolysis by ADAMTS13 under shear by using RU8, a mAb directed against the VWF D4 domain. They suggested that a binding site in the Cterminal region (D4CK) of VWF is constitutively exposed and participates at the initial step of a multi-step interaction, ultimately leading to proteolysis of VWF by ADAMTS13. Thus, RU8 may inhibit VWF proteolysis by inhibiting the initial binding of the distal domains of ADAMTS13 to the C-terminal region of VWF. We found that the mAb, SZ34, bound to native VWF better than pre-denatured VWF at the central A2 domain, and decreased the cleavage of native VWF under shear stress, but not pre-denatured VWF under static conditions. These findings suggest that SZ34 binds native VWF-A2 domain, which may block the conformational change of VWF or block the access of ADAMTS13 to the ancillary binding site and cleavage bond located at the central A2 domain under fluid shear stress.",

Although a report found that recombinant VWF-A2 peptide (a.a.1481-1668) was sensitive to proteolysis by ADAMTS-13 under physiological pH and non-denaturing conditions [17] , most of studies have shown that even for the isolated A2 domain, unfolding by high fluid shear stress or chemical denaturants such as urea and guanidine-HCl is required for proteolysis by ADAMTS13 [10, 18] . Thus, for VWF with its multi-domain structure, not only the inter-domain but also the intra-domain A2 structural changes have regulatory roles in ADAMTS13-mediated cleavage of VWF. Our data demonstrate that the epitope of SZ34, a mAb raised against native VWF multimers, is located within the A1555-G1595 region, which comprises the a2-helix and a3-helix according to the crystal structure of VWF A2 domain [19] . It is possible that part or all of the a2-helix and a3-helix structure of A2 domain is constitutively exposed on the native VWF multimers and is involved in the regulation of VWF proteolysis by ADAMTS13. Previous studies, however, considered that the A2 domain of VWF is normally sandwiched between the much larger A1 and A3 domains [19, 20] , and the D1596-R1668 region in VWF A2 domain (the so called VWF73) is the minimal substrate for ADAMTS13 [21] .",

Recombinant VWF-R1597W mutant was expressed in transiently transfected Hela cell line using serum-free OPTI-MEM I (Invitrogen) for 48 h.

Two primers were used for amplifying VWF A1A2A3: 59-gga tcc GCA GGA GCC GGG AGG C-39 and 59-ctc gag TCC AGA GCA CAG TTT GTG-39 (Lowercase letters for BamHI and XhoI sites). Four recombinant VWF domains including A1A2A3, A1, A2 and A3 were all expressed in inclusion bodies. After purification, protein refolding was achieved using an 8 to 0 M urea linear gradient. Plasmids encoding A2-12, A2-23 (VWF114), A2-1, A2-2 and A2-3 (VWF73) ( Figure 5B ) were constructed similarly in the GST fusion vector pGEX-6P-1 (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ).
