While research has been done on the value of telephone helplines on health care use and patient satisfaction, very few projects have looked at using a telephone helpline as a source of data for syndromic surveillance, and none have been attempted in Canada.

Using different analytic methods, normal thresholds for the different syndromes will be ascertained.

Its growth has been encouraged in large part in the United States as a response to potential bioterrorism threats. In effect, it is a complementary surveillance system, in that it can provide prediagnostic data to rapidly detect infectious disease outbreaks before they are detected through conventional surveillance methods. The Walker Report [7] highlighted Canadian post-SARS interest in syndromic surveillance as a method of increasing Ontario's capacity to manage communicable diseases adequately. An important feature of syndromic surveillance systems is that they rely on existing data streams. In other words, it does not require the development of new datasets (and the challenges surrounding this), but rather makes use of available data and increases communications within the public health system. Data streams that are being investigated as part of the larger syndromic surveillance picture include: -Over The Counter (OTC) drug sales [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] , -emergency department visits (coded either by ICD code or by chief complaint) [13, 14] , -emergency (911) calls [15] , -ambulance dispatch [10] , -patient transfers [16] , -school/work absenteeism records [10] , -telephone medical helpline calls (e.g. NHS Direct in the UK, Ontario Telehealth) [10, [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] , -insurance/HMO claim data [23] .",

The decision to pursue both types of analyses is due to Ontario's large geographic size, combined with the uneven distribution of population. Temporal trends, usually measured through one-dimensional scan statistics [36, 41, 42] are of interest to monitor general patterns of symptoms. This is of particular interest for unusual events where a few cases would result in a likely alert (e.g. anthrax). Spatial clustering analysis, using spatial scan statistics, have been adapted for infectious disease surveillance [36, 43, 44] . This statistical method will be used to ascertain unusual activity in specific geographic areas. For example, this will allow for the monitoring of underserviced areas such as northern Ontario where infectious disease surveillance is limited and where, coincidentally, use of Telehealth is proportionally high. This statistical method relies on a geographic region's expected counts rather than on its population distribution.",

Particularly, this province-wide system would address issues surrounding a lack of public health surge capacity. As an early warning system, Telehealth has the potential to identify aberrations long before traditional reporting systems. In the case of the Walkerton, Ontario outbreak [47] , if Telehealth had been up and operational as an early warning system, we can speculate that the number of calls for gastrointestinal complaints would have gone up, which would have created an alert for public health to investigate these calls before an increase in cases would have been identified through routine reporting systems (especially RDIS). By acting early, the levels of morbidity and mortality witnessed in Walkerton could have been curtailed by a more timely involvement of Public Health. This would have meant that control measures such as \"boil water\" orders) could have implemented more quickly, which would have decreased the number of cases and would have allowed public health to work more effectively and within its available resources.",

In effect, for the purpose of surveillance, it cuts out the need for a physician as a \"reporting\" intermediary. This will potentially allow for a more complete picture of underserviced areas, as well as, a much timelier one as it is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. The continuous availability of this service provides a front line that each and every Ontarian can access prior to or instead of seeking help from a family physician or an emergency department. When a call is placed to Telehealth, all callers are given advice based on the type and severity of symptoms they are reporting. Advice can range from staying at home to going to an emergency department immediately. Because of its province-wide coverage, this means that data for areas with limited access to emergency departments and family physicians will be collected, thereby providing new information on an underserviced subset of the population.",
