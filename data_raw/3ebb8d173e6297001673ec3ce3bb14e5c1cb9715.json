Immunoreactivities for cav-1 and for cav-2 were co-localized in the cell membrane of the basal cells and basolaterally in the ciliated epithelial cells of large airways of rat and human. However, no labeling for cav-1 or cav-2 was observed in the epithelial cells of small bronchi. Using conventional double-labeling indirect immunofluorescence combined with CLSM-FRET analysis, we detected an association of cav-1\u03b1 and -2 in epithelial cells. The presence of caveolae was confirmed by electron microscopy. In contrast to human and rat, cav-1-immunoreactivity and caveolae were confined to basal cells in mice. Epithelial caveolae were absent in cav-1-deficient mice, implicating a requirement of this caveolar protein in epithelial caveolae formation.",

Caveolar formation is dependent on the expression of caveolins. Three caveolins (cav) are known. Cav-1 and cav-2 are widely expressed, whereas cav-3 is thought to be restricted to muscle cells [2] . Cav-1 is expressed in two isoforms, cav-1\u03b1 and cav-1\u03b2, exhibiting a cell type-specific distribution (endothelial vs. alveolar type-1 cells) in the alveolar region [3] .",

Several pathogenic microorganisms selectively use caveolae to enter cells [4] . After accumulation in the caveolae, they are delivered to the endoplasmatic reticulum bypassing the classical endosome-lysosome trafficking and thereby preventing inactivation [5, 6] . It has been shown that the infectivity of Ctype human adenovirus can be greatly reduced by the expression of a dominant negative cav-1 mutant in plasmocytic cells [7] , indicating that caveolae are involved in this process. In addition, it was recently shown for Chlamydia pneumoniae that it co-localizes intracellularly with cav-1 and cav-2 after infection, and a role of these proteins for the developmental cycle of Chlamydiae is discussed [8] . Also, the human coronavirus 229E that is known to induce respiratory tract infections enters cells via a caveolae dependent mechanism [9, 10] .",

In contrast, although caveolae are still present in cav-2 deficient mice, these mice show the marked pathological alveolar phenotype of cav-1 deficient mice [15] . This indicates that cav-2, although not able to form caveolae on its own, has profound influences on caveolar function. Since a selective association of cav-2 but not cav-1 was described with Chlamydia species other than Chlamydia pneumoniae it is likely that both proteins can have divergent functions during infectious processes making it necessary to examine the presence and localization of both proteins.",

The PCR conditions included initial denaturation in one cycle of 10 min at 95\u00b0C followed by 40 cycles of 20 s at 95\u00b0C, 20 s at 59\u00b0C, and 20 s at 72\u00b0C. All analyses were done in triplicate. As a basis for the relative mRNA quantification, the mean cycle thresholds (CT) for cav-1 and cav-2 were calculated. The corresponding threshold cycles of the target gene were subtracted from mean \u03b2-MG-CT according to:",

To control for smearing of RNA during the cutting procedure, areas of dried O.C.T. compound (Sakura, Zoeterwoude, The Netherlands) similar in number and size to the samples of picked epithelial cells and directly adjacent to the luminal side of the tracheal epithelium were applied.

We used FRET combined with CLSM and double-labeling indirect immunofluorescence as a technique for measuring close spatial association of proteins in tissue sections [18] . Cav-1 and cav-2 were labeled using conventional indirect double-labeling immunofluorescence technique (anti-cav-1\u03b1 from rabbit labeled with Cy5-conjugated secondary reagent, anti-cav-2 antibody labeled with Cy3conjugated secondary reagent). Both primary antibodies were applied simultaneously.

For control of the species-specificity of the secondary reagents, only the anti-cav-1 antibody and both secondary antibodies were applied. FRET was quantified by the acceptor photobleaching method using a CLSM (TCS-SP2 AOBS, Leica). In this method, FRET is detected by measuring the intensity of fluorescence of the donor before and after bleaching of the acceptor. The CLSM settings were as follows: Detection of Cy3: 52% laser power at 543 nm, detection at 555-620 nm; Cy5: 20% laser power at 633 nm, detection at 639-738 nm. A region of interest was photobleached 10 times at 100% activity using the 633 nm laser and maximal zoom to destroy the acceptor fluorophore (Cy5) and the change in Cy3 signal (\u2206IF) was determined in the photobleached area where \u2206IF = D DA -D DB , D DA is the fluorescence intensity of the donor after photobleaching of the acceptor, and D DB is the fluorescence intensity of the donor before photobleaching of the acceptor.",

In addition, several proteins involved in Ca 2+ -dependent signaling processes, including the Ca 2+ -pump and Ca 2+ -ATPase, are localized to caveolae as shown in renal and intestinal epithelial cells [25] .

            "text": "Several pathogenic microorganisms selectively use caveolae to enter cells [4] . Since the caveolae are localized at the basolateral surface of the ciliated cells, it is conceivable that they may be involved in the process of endocytosis of infectious agents after epithelial damage. Indeed, adenoviruses require damage of the integrity of the epithelia or of the tight junctions to get access to the basolateral membrane of the ciliated cells to be infectious [26] . Basal cells are much more susceptible to infection with adenoviruses [7, 27] . Accordingly, we observed more caveolae in basal cells than in ciliated epithelial cells. It has been shown for the adenovirus2 that it can enter the cell via its receptor CAR that is also localized basolaterally in ciliated cells and in basal cells. Since adenovirus2-CAR is endocytosed via clathrin-coated pits, caveolae, at first sight, seem not to be Western blotting important in this process. Nevertheless, another receptor for adenovirus2 is major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class 1. This also is localized in the basolateral membrane of ciliated cells and in basal cells. MHC class 1 is also the receptor for simian virus 40 that is endocytosed via caveolae. This indicates a role for caveolae in the infection of airway epithelium by these adenoviruses. Furthermore, the infectivity of C-type human adenovirus can be greatly reduced by the expression of a dominant negative cav-1 mutant in plasmocytic cells indicating that caveolae can serve as an alternative entry site for these viruses [28] . In addition, it was recently shown for Chlamydia pneumoniae that it co-localizes with cav-1 and cav-2 in the cytosol in HeLa cells after cellular entrance [8] , indicating a role for caveolins in infectious processes after microbial entry.",

            "text": "We observed differences in the labeling intensities for cav-1\u03b1 and cav-1\u03b1\u03b2 among cell types. Cav-1\u03b1-immunoreactivity was stronger in endothelial cells compared to epithelial cells. In contrast, cav-1\u03b1\u03b2-labeling was stronger in the epithelium than in the endothelium of the large airways. In line with this observation, Western blots showed a strong protein expression of cav-1\u03b2 in abraded tracheal epithelium but not in lung and heart homogenates. Cav-1\u03b2 is less efficient in the formation of caveolae [31] , which could be an explanation for the lower number of caveolae found in epithelial cells compared to endothelium where the \u03b1-isoform is predominantly expressed [3] . The \u03b2-isoform of cav-1 is derived from an alternative translational starting site that creates a protein truncated by 32 amino acids [32] and lacks the phosphorylation site tyr 14. This site has been shown to be phosphorylated upon stimulation of cultured cells by epithelial growth factor (EGF), leading to neoformation of caveolae [33] . Since EGF is considered as a key factor for repair of the bronchial epithelium [34] , caveolae containing the \u03b1-isoform might be involved in this process. It is tempting to speculate that certain caveolae may exist that contain predominantly the \u03b2-isoform. Such caveolae might be involved in other signaling cascades. If both isoforms are present in caveolae, cav-1\u03b2 could be a negative regulator for signaling cascades relying on the phosphorylation of cav-1\u03b1.",
