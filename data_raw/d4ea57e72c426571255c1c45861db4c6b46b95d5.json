Although, the IL-33 levels increased in sera of viral hepatitis patients in human, the cellular sources of IL-33 in viral hepatitis remained obscure. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the expression of IL-33 in murine fulminant hepatitis induced by a Toll like receptor (TLR3) viral mimetic, poly(I:C) or by pathogenic mouse hepatitis virus (L2-MHV3). The administration of poly(I:C) plus D-galactosamine (D-GalN) in mice led to acute liver injury associated with the induction of IL-33 expression in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) and vascular endothelial cells (VEC), while the administration of poly(I:C) alone led to hepatocyte specific IL-33 expression in addition to vascular IL-33 expression. The hepatocyte-specific IL-33 expression was down-regulated in NK-depleted poly(I:C) treated mice suggesting a partial regulation of IL-33 by NK cells. The CD1d KO (NKT deficient) mice showed hepatoprotection against poly(I:C)-induced hepatitis in association with increased number of IL-33 expressing hepatocytes in CD1d KO mice than WT controls. These results suggest that hepatocytespecific IL-33 expression in poly(I:C) induced liver injury was partially dependent of NK cells and with limited role of NKT cells. In parallel, the L2-MHV3 infection in mice induced fulminant hepatitis associated with up-regulated IL-33 expression as well as pro-inflammatory cytokine microenvironment in liver. The LSEC and VEC expressed inducible expression of IL-33 following L2-MHV3 infection but the hepatocyte-specific IL-33 expression was only evident between 24 to 32h of post infection. In conclusion, the alarmin cytokine IL-33 was over-expressed during fulminant hepatitis in mice with LSEC, VEC and hepatocytes as potential sources of IL-33.",

The polyinosinepolycytidylic acid (Poly(I:C), a synthetic analog of double stranded RNA (dsRNA), induces a moderate acute hepatic injury and mimics a model of viral hepatitis [18, 19] . Poly(I:C) activated principally the intrahepatic macrophages (Kuppfer cells) and NK cells via TLR3 [20] leading to increase of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, IL-6, IL-12 and IFN-\u03b2 [18, 19, 21, 22] . A pretreatment with D-galactosamine (D-GalN) in Poly(I:C) injected-mice aggravated the acute hepatic injury which become lethal [19] . A natural animal model of viral hepatitis, the mouse hepatitis viruses (MHV), single-strand, positive-sense RNA viruses belonging to Coronaviridae family, induced acute and/or chronic hepatitis in mice mimicking human HBV infection and serve as a good tool to study immune dysfunction and cytokines associated with viral acute hepatitis [23, 24] . The most hepatotropic serotype of MHV, the mouse hepatitis virus type 3 (MHV3), induced severe fulminant hepatitis in mice and their death within 3-5 days post-infection [25] . In liver, Kupffer cells, NK cells, hepatocytes, sinusoidal endothelial and vascular endothelial cells are the main target cells for MHV3 replication [26, 27] . The histopathological lesions in liver were correlated with the levels of inflammatory cytokines [28] . High levels of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 produced in livers from infected C57BL/6 mice were modulated by TLR receptor. We have previously demonstrated that intrahepatic NK cells decreased after a transient increase in liver from pathogenic L2-MHV3-infected mice due to virus-induced NK depletion [27] .",

The mRNA expression of IL-33 was significantly increased (2-3 fold) in Poly(I:C) treated mice compared to control mice, however, IL-33 expression was downregulated in D-GalN Poly(I:C) treated mice in comparison with Poly(I:C) alone ( Figure 1A ). Regarding cellular sources of IL-33, the liver sinusoidal endothelial cells and vascular endothelial cells expressed IL-33 constitutively in PBS control mice livers and induced expression in these cells was observed following Poly(I:C) and D-GalN Poly(I:C) treatment ( Figure 1B ). Interestingly, the nuclear expression of IL-33 was found in hepatocytes of Poly(I:C) treated mice (arrows in insert indicate IL-33 positive hepatocytes) but not in D-GalN Poly(I:C) induced liver injury ( Figure 1B ). The number of IL-33 expressing hepatocytes were clearly and significantly increased in Poly(I:C) induced acute liver injury compared to control mice ( Figure 1C ). These results suggest that regulation of IL-33 in hepatocytes is associated with Poly(I:C) induced TLR3 stimulation in liver. The pro-inflammatory cytokine expression of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 was up-regulated in Poly(I:C) or D-GalN Poly(I:C) treated mice when compared with control mice (p <0.01) ( Figure 3E ). NK cell depletion did not decrease the expression level of the inflammatory cytokines ( Figure 3E ). The mRNA expression of IFN-\u03b3 was not significantly varied among the treated and control groups of mice except in NK-depleted D-GalN Poly(I:C) treated mice ( Figure 3E ). The expression of TRAIL was significantly increased in both NK depleted and non depleted mice following Poly(I:C) or D-GalN Poly(I:C) administration when compared with control mice (p <0.01)) but significantly decrease in NK depleted mice after D-GalN Poly(I:C) treatment (p <0.05) when compared with D-GalNPolyIC treated mice ( Figure 3E ). The expression of CXCL1 only increased in NK depleted D-GalN Poly(I:C) treated mice when compared to control mice (p <0.05) ( Figure 3E ) that may correlate with development of inflammatory microenvironment in liver and neutrophil migration during liver injury.",

IL-33 and sST2 have shown to be up-regulated in acute on chronic and chronic hepatic failure [15] and in chronic HBV and HCV infections in human [14, 16, 17] . The cellular sources of IL-33 in viral fulminant hepatitis are not well known. Accordingly, the murine fulminant hepatic models of TLR3 agonist, Poly(I:C), and pathogenic mouse hepatitis virus (L2-MHV3) are relevant acute viral hepatic models in human. Thus, we aimed to know the expression and regulation of IL-33 in Poly(I:C) and L2-MHV3 induced hepatitis in mice. The Poly(I:C) administration in mice induced moderate hepatic injury while co-administration of D-GalN and Poly(I:C) led to very severe fulminant hepatitis in mice. The liver injury induced by D-GalN Poly(I:C) treatment was associated with hemorrhagic lesions in liver and elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines as reported earlier [19, 21, 22] . The underlying mechanism of Poly(I:C)-induced liver injury is mediated by activation of Kuppfer cells and NK cells in a TLR3 dependent pathway [20] in association with increased inflammatory cytokines. Inducible expression of IL-33 was found in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells and vascular endothelial cells following Poly(I:C) and D-GalN Poly(I:C) treatment. However, hepatocyte-specific IL-33 expression was only evident in Poly(I:C) treated mice with increased number of IL-33 expressing hepatocytes compared to control mice. It may be plausible that hepatocyte specific inhibition of transcription by D-GalN prevented hepatocyte-specific IL-33 expression at transcript and protein level following D-GalN Poly(I:C) treatment. However, innate immune stimulation by the TLR3 agonist alone can induce IL-33 expression in liver especially in hepatocytes. The regulation of IL-33 by TLR viral and bacterial ligands have been demonstrated in human corneal epithelial cells and fibroblasts [30, 31] as well as in murine macrophages [32] . The IL-33 was up-regulated by Poly(I:C) stimulation in murine macrophages and its transcriptional regulation was dependent of two transcription factors, IFN regulatory factor-3 (IRF-3) and CREB [32] . Here, we add TLR3 mediated expression of IL-33 in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, vascular endothelial cells and hepatocytes in acute hepatitis in mice in a pathophysiological context. In addition, TLR3 expression is also rapidly increased in liver from L2-MHV3 infected mice (results not shown).",

We demonstrated the cellular expression of IL-33 in sinusoidal and vascular endothelial cells and hepatocytes at various times of the fulminant viral hepatitis induced by L2-MHV3. The L2-MHV3induced liver injury was associated with significant increases in serum transaminases ALAT/ASAT, viral nucleocapsid, IFN-\u03b2 and pro-inflammatory cytokine and chimiokine expression. The increased CXCL1 during MHV3 induced acute hepatitis may lead to chemotaxis/infiltration of neutrophils as an early response to liver infection and development of inflammatory microenvironment. The mechanism of MHV3-induced liver injury have shown to be dependent on activation of target cells of virus like Kupffer cells, NK cells, hepatocytes, sinusoidal endothelial and vascular endothelial cells [26, 27] . Here we have shown that mRNA expression of IL-33 was overexpressed after L2-MHV3-induced hepatitis in mice. The transcript level of IL-33 was highly increased in L2-MHV3 induced hepatitis than Poly(I:C) treated mice demonstrating a difference between TLR-3 agonist and natural virus infection in liver. TLR3 expression is also rapidly increased in liver from L2-MHV3 infected mice (results not shown), suggesting that another factor may be also involved in the increase of IL-33. The hepatocyte-specific expression of IL-33 in hepatocytes was associated with beginning of L2-MHV3 induced liver injury (24, 28 and 32h) and the inducible expression of IL-33 in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells and vascular endothelial cells was sustained during the whole infection period (16 to 72h).",

The depletion of NK cells by anti-AGSM1 antibody in mice did not inhibit increased liver injury in D-GalN sensitized Poly(I:C) treated mice and had any effect in Poly(I:C) alone administration. These results are contrary to earlier findings which showed that pre-depletion of NK cells protected mice against D-GalN Poly(I:C) induced liver injury [22] . The difference seemed to be related with kinetics and dose of D-GalN Poly(I:C) used in these studies. The significant increase in CXCL1 expression in NK-depleted mice may explain the interplay of immune cells migration in liver i.e. depletion of one immune cell population relatively compensate the other immune cell population. The major sources of CXCL1 in liver are endothelial cells, Kupffer cells, hepatic stellate cells, hepatocytes and neutrophils and CXCL1 in association with neutrophils is important for development of liver injury [33, 34] . The IL-33 expression was induced in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells and vascular endothelial cells. The downregulation of hepatocyte-specific IL-33 expression in NK depleted mice in Poly(I:C) treated mice suggests a partial regulation of IL-33 by NK cells. Interestingly, IL-33-expressing hepatocytes decreased at the same time than NK cells decreased in liver following L2-MHV3 infection [25] , supporting the hypothesis of a regulatory role of NK cells in IL-33 expression in hepatocytes.",

In the TLR-3 agonist model used in this study, NKT cells did not control IL-33 expression in Poly(I:C)-induced liver injury because NKT (CD1d) KO mice exhibited increased number of IL-33 expressing hepatocytes than WT controls. These results may suggest a protective role of NKT cells in association with increased hepatocyte-specific IL-33 expression during TLR3-mediated acute hepatitis. We and others have demonstrated such a protective role of NKT cells and IL-33 during ConA-induced liver injury model , Hepatol, Volarevic et al. 2012, J Hepatol) that seems plausible in Poly(I:C)-induced acute liver injury. It has been previously reported that NKT cells did not decrease in liver following L2-MHV3 infection in mice in contrast to that observed with NK cells [25] . However, TRAIL level expression increased in Poly(I:C) treated mice, as previously observed in ConA-induced hepatic model [13] .",

Therefore, we investigated the pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in Poly(I:C) and D-GalN Poly(I:C) induced acute hepatitis. The transcript level of TNF-\u03b1, TRAIL, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 was significantly up-regulated following D-GalN Poly(I:C) induced acute hepatitis (8h) compared to D-GalN or PBS control mice (NK cells pre-depletion led to severe D-GalN Poly(I:C) induced acute liver injury, increased pro-inflammatory cytokines and down-regulated IL-33 expression in hepatocytes NK cells have shown to be crucially important in Poly(I:C) induced liver injury[22]. Here, we studied the effect of depletion of NK cells by anti-ASGM1 antibody on D-GalN Poly(I:C) induced acute hepatitis and expression of IL-33. As expected, the anti-ASGM1 pre-treatment efficiently depleted NK cells in liver of mice compared to vehicle control or Poly(I:C) treated mice (Figure 3A). However, NK cells depletion led to enhanced liver injury (as evaluated by serum AST/ALT) in D-GalN Poly(I:C) treated mice than Poly(I:C) alone or vehicle control mice (Figure 3B). A milder increase in serum transaminases was evident between D-GalN Poly(I:C) and NKdepleted D-GalN Poly(I:C) treated mice (Figure 3B).The mRNA expression of IL-33 was not varied between control (non NK depleted) and NK-depleted Poly(I:C) or D-GalN Poly(I:C) treated mice although the expression of IL-33 was diminished in NK-depleted D-GalN Poly(I:C) mice (Figure 3B). The liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) and vascular endothelial cells (VEC) expressed IL-33 in NK depleted Poly(I:C) or D-GalN Poly(I:C) treated mice livers and hepatocyte-specific IL-33 expression was evident only after Poly(I:C) treatment (Figure 3C) (arrows indicate IL-33 positive hepatocytes). The NK depletion led to decrease in number of IL-33 expressing hepatocytes in Poly(I:C) treated mice compared to non NK depleted mice (Figure 3D) suggesting a partial NK cells dependent regulation of IL-33 in hepatocytes.",

            "text": "). We aimed to verify the impact of NKT cells deficiency in Poly(I:C)induced liver injury and IL-33 expression in liver in CD1d KO (NKT KO) mice. WT control and NKT KO mice showed increased liver injury (2000 to 5000 AST/ALT levels) after D-GalN Poly(I:C) administration with a milder hepatoprotection in NKT KO mice (p <0.05) when compared with WT treated mice (Figure 4A). Liver histology revealed hemorrhagic lesions in liver after D-GalN Poly(I:C) treatment in NKT KO mice without remarkable liver injury in Poly(I:C) or vehicle control NKT KO mice (Figure 4B, upper panel). The hepatocyte-specific IL-33 expression was evident in Poly(I:C)-administered NKT KO mice but not in D-GalN Poly(I:C)-treated or control NKT KO mice (Figure 4B, lower panel). The number of IL-33 expressing hepatocytes significantly increased in Poly(I:C)-administered NKT KO mice compared to WT controls (p <0.05) but not in D-GalN Poly(I:C)-treated or control NKT KO mice (Figure 4C). These results suggested that NKT cells have a protective effect on liver injury in association with increased expression of IL-33 in hepatocytes during Poly(I:C)-induced liver injury. L2-MHV3 induced fulminant hepatitis in mice was associated with increased expression of IL-33 in liver. The pathogenic strain of mouse hepatitis virus (L2-MHV3) induces fulminant hepatitis in C57BL/6 mice [23] and mimics a model of fulminant viral hepatitis (HBV) in human. We investigated the",
