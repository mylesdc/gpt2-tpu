Among all the reported cases, 1229 (11.60%) SARI cases were randomly surveyed, sampled, and tested. Eighty-one HPIV RNA-positive cases were identified in this study, including 10 HPIV-1, 9 HPIV-2, 55 HPIV-3, and 7 HPIV-4 cases, with a yield rate of 0.81%, 0.73%, 4.48%, and 0.57%, respectively. No regional or temporal clustering of HPIV infection was found. Among all 81 HPIV RNA-positive cases, 18 cases were found to be coinfected with other respiratory viruses. Coinfection with HPIV-3 and rhinovirus was the most common pattern (Supporting information 1).",

Detailed analysis showed that the yield rate of HPIV varied during the year, from the lowest of 0% in February 2016 to the highest of 21.43% in August 2015. As the most common type of HPIVs, HPIV-3, most of the infection occurred in June to September (66.07%, Figure 1 ). Moreover, age-specific infection was proved. Children under 5 years old showed the highest yield rate of HPIV infection (9.07%), and followed by the patients over 60 years old (6.02%). No significant difference was found between HPIV-positive SARI cases and all SARI cases by gender and hospital stays (P = .728 and P = .774, respectively). However, HPIV-positive SARI cases have a better outcome when compared with other SARI cases (0.24% vs.",

Previous studies were usually performed in ARI cases, especially in outpatients. 10, 11 Noteworthily, compared with the definition of ARI (presence of constitutional signs or symptom of respiratory tract infection, ie, cough and fast breathing), the criteria of SARI puts more focus on the hospitalized severe cases. As expected, infants and young child <5 years old showed the highest infection rate of HPIVs in all SARI cases, which concur with the studies carried out in ARIs. However, the high yield rate of HPIVs in elder population was observed: 6.02% (25/415) of SARI cases over 60 years old were HPIV-positive, which was higher than that in mild ARI cases. 11 Although the HPIV infection usually presents as mild and An important finding of this study was the genetic characteristic of current circulating HPIV-3 viruses. Two major surface glycoproteins, the HN and the fusion (F) proteins, are essential for virus assembly. 1 In particular, HN glycoprotein regulates the interaction between virus and host cells and possesses the largest antigenicity in host immunity against HPIV infection (12) . Several antigenic epitopes of the HN glycoprotein have been previously characterized. 12, 13 Three amino acid substitutions in antigenic epitopes were found in this study, including K168R (16.67%), H295Y (100%), and I391V (100%). In particular, the K168R mutation locates very close to amino acids of significant importance to the integrity of distinct HN epitopes (residues 171), 14 and it has not been identified in Asia before. Although these variants become non-dominant since the middle of 2015, the potential antigenic drift due to the substitutions should be further evaluated.",

The nucleotide sequence and deduced amino acid homologies among these viruses were between 98.84%-100% and 99.65%-100%, respectively, which suggested high genetic conservation of HPIV-3 in Beijing area. No significant difference between viruses derived from patients with different age or seasonality was observed. Compared to the prototype strain Wash/47885/57, 15 amino acid substitutions (M21T, I40T, I53T, H62R, I76V, M82V, M118I, L138P, K168R, V191I, I391V, V348A, I522R, R524K, and S527P) were found in the tested HPIV-3 viruses. Among them, K168R and V191I were first identified in Asia. We further analyzed the sequences of HN gene of tested viruses and circulating strains worldwide and then evaluated the phylogenetic relationship among them. All the viruses belonged to Cluster C3a, which was the major circulating cluster in Asia. However, the viruses can be further distinguished into two C3a-related group, BJ/05114/2015-like viruses and BJ/02073/2015-like viruses, with at least 0.004 nucleotide divergence between them. Moreover, these two group viruses co-circulated in Beijing area before the middle of 2015. Then a genetic shift occurred, leading to a dominate role of BJ/02073/2015-like viruses. No BJ/05114/2015-like viruses were identified in 2016 (Figure 2, Supporting information 2).",
