The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of prebiotic supplementation with stabilized rice bran (SRB) in milk on health, immunity, and performance of pre-weaned organic dairy calves. Holstein heifer calves (n = 90) were enrolled at 6 \u00b1 1 days old and monitored for 28 days, from July to August 2017. Calves were randomly assigned to a control (CTR; n = 45) or a treatment group (SRB; n = 45). The CTR group received milk alone and the SRB group received 120 g of SRB per day in milk to achieve a 10% w/w dose of the total calories. Daily health evaluations were conducted to score health status and disease severity (healthy, slightly affected, moderately or severely sick) of calves, through integrated assessment of diarrhea, dehydration, attitude, and milk intake. Body weights and fecal IgA quantification were completed on the first and last day of the study. Results: Overall, weight gain and fecal IgA concentrations were not affected by the dietary addition of SRB. The total number of calf-days classified as healthy or sick were not different between treatment groups. Similarly, the number of calf-days categorized as slightly affected, moderately sick, or severely sick did not differ between treatment groups. Time to event analyses indicated a tendency for a treatment effect in the time to the first moderate case of diarrhea (P = 0.08), as well as in the time to recovery from diarrhea (P = 0.052), favoring control calves. Conclusions: These results indicated that the dietary addition of SRB in milk did not have an effect in health, immunity or performance of pre-weaned dairy calves.",

Rehydration and antibiotic therapy are common treatments for calves with neonatal diarrhea.

When the health status at enrollment was included as a covariate in the analysis, a tendency was determined in the survival function for the effect of health at day 0 (P = 0.08; Fig. 1b ). Day 0 \"healthy\" CTR and SRB calves presented the first moderate subsequent diarrhea episode in 9 \u00b1 2 days and 7 \u00b1 1 days respectively. CTR Control group not exposed to heat stabilized rice bran in the diet, SRB Group receiving a daily dose of 120 g of stabilized rice bran corresponding to 10% of the daily calories Contrary, d0 \"sick\" CTR and SRB presented the first moderate diarrhea episode in 5 \u00b1 1 and 4 \u00b1 1, respectively. The time to recovery from a \"moderate\" disease status to a \"slight\" or \"healthy\" status, indicated a significance trend for treatment group in the Kaplan Meier analysis (P = 0.052). Calves in CTR group recovered from a \"moderate\" status in 3.1 \u00b1 0.4 days, while SRB calves recovered in 4.9 \u00b1 0.7 days (Fig. 2a) . Importantly, when health at enrollment was added as a covariate, there were no longer differences found in time to recovery (P = 0.12). The survival curve considering health status at enrollment indicated that CTR calves classified as \"healthy\" at d0 recovered from a moderate diarrhea episode in 2.8 \u00b1 0.6 days; d0 \"sick\" CTR calves recovered in 3.4 \u00b1 0.6 days; d0 \"healthy\" SRB calves in 4.3 \u00b1 0.7 days; and d0 \"sick\" SRB calves recovered in 5.7 \u00b1 1 days (Fig. 2b) .",
