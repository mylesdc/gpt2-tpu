Trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine is included in National Immunization Programs for 1) children 6 months to 2 years old in Argentina; 2) children 6 months to 5 years old in Brazil; and 3) all high-risk individuals. Coverage rates in both countries were about 80% (albeit lower for the second dose). Experts from both countries proposed the following strategies to improve prevention: 1) increase surveillance; 2) assess effectiveness and long-term safety of influenza vaccines; 3) reinforce vaccination programs in order to increase coverage rates; and 4) consider introducing more effective vaccines, such as adjuvanted trivalent vaccines. In Argentina, estimating casefatality rates was also recommended. Other proposed actions included enhancing education of health professionals and the lay community, and better use of communication resources to raise awareness of the burden of influenza and promote vaccine uptake.",

One health care model showed that vaccinating 20% of schoolchildren had a greater impact on flu-related mortality than vaccinating 90% of the elderly (20) . When influenza immunization of schoolchildren was introduced in Japan, all-cause deaths, as well as influenza and pneumonia-related deaths, were significantly reduced in all age groups (21) , and when vaccination was stopped, mortality rates increased, especially in the elderly.",

            "text": "There are, however, several hurdles to introducing an early childhood influenza control program. First, there are limited vaccine options. IIV3s have moderate efficacy in young children (22) , and do not induce persistent immune response. Inactivated influenza vaccines, quadrivalent (IIV4s) offer broader protection against the two B lineages, which usually co-circulate yet alternate in dominance (2) . Although B viruses predominate in children, they are a significant cause of hospitalizations and deaths in all age groups. Use of IIV4 could reduce a mismatch between a vaccine and circulating B lineages, but the benefits would be modest (23) . Adjuvanted IIV3s (aIIV3s) are more effective than non-adjuvanted vaccines. In a trial of MF59adjuvanted IIV3 in 4 700 children 6-72 months old (24) , efficacy was 85% (the highest ever reported in children 6-24 months old) and persisted after the second dose, and there were no safety issues. According to one study, the correlate of protection threshold is higher in children than in adults (25); for example, titers of 1:110 in children and 1:40 in adults were both associated with 50% clinical protection. In Canada, aIIV3 is licensed for use in infants and young children 6-24 months old due to its superior immunogenicity and acceptable safety profile (26) . At the roundtable meeting, use of the live attenuated vaccine was also discussed, but as this vaccine is not available in Argentina or Brazil, the information was not included in this report.",
