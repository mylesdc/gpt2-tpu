            "text": "Andalusia (Southern Spain) is considered one of the main routes of introduction of bluetongue virus (BTV) into Europe, evidenced by a devastating epidemic caused by BTV-1 in 2007. Understanding the pattern and the drivers of BTV-1 spread in Andalusia is critical for effective detection and control of future epidemics. A long-standing metric for quantifying the behaviour of infectious diseases is the case-reproduction ratio (R t ), defined as the average number of secondary cases arising from a single infected case at time t (for t>0). Here we apply a method using epidemic trees to estimate the between-herd case reproduction ratio directly from epidemic data allowing the spatial and temporal variability in transmission to be described. We then relate this variability to predictors describing the hosts, vectors and the environment to better understand why the epidemic spread more quickly in some regions or periods. The R t value for the BTV-1 epidemic in Andalusia peaked in July at 4.6, at the start of the epidemic, then decreased to 2.2 by August, dropped below 1 by September (0.8), and by October it had decreased to 0.02. BTV spread was the consequence of both local transmission within established disease foci and BTV expansion to distant new areas (i.e. new foci), which resulted in a high variability in BTV transmission, not only among different areas, but particularly through time, which suggests that general control measures applied at broad spatial scales are unlikely to be effective. This high variability through time was probably due to the impact of temperature on BTV transmission, as evidenced by a reduction in the value of R t by 0.0041 for every unit increase (day) in the extrinsic incubation period (EIP), which is itself directly dependent on temperature. Moreover, within the range of values at which BTV-1 transmission occurred in Andalusia (20.6\u00b0C to 29.5\u00b0C) there was a positive correlation between temperature and R t values, although the PLOS ONE | relationship was not linear, probably as a result of the complex relationship between temperature and the different parameters affecting BTV transmission. R t values for BTV-1 in Andalusia fell below the threshold of 1 when temperatures dropped below 21\u00b0C, a much higher threshold than that reported in other BTV outbreaks, such as the BTV-8 epidemic in Northern Europe. This divergence may be explained by differences in the adaptation to temperature of the main vectors of the BTV-1 epidemic in Andalusia (Culicoides imicola) compared those of the BTV-8 epidemic in Northern Europe (Culicoides obsoletus). Importantly, we found that BTV transmission (R t value) increased significantly in areas with higher densities of sheep. Our analysis also established that control of BTV-1 in Andalusia was complicated by the simultaneous establishment of several distant foci at the start of the epidemic, which may have been caused by several independent introductions of infected vectors from the North of Africa. We discuss the implications of these findings for BTV surveillance and control in this region of Europe.",

            "text": "The basic reproduction ratio (R 0 ) is the most widely used parameter in epidemic theory and is a key tool for understanding the behaviour of infectious diseases [1] . It is defined as the average number of secondary cases produced when a single infected individual is introduced into a fully susceptible population [2] . As the epidemic progresses, as a result of the depletion of susceptible animals or the application of control measures, the basic reproduction ratio changes to the case reproduction ratio (R t ), i.e. the average number of secondary cases arising from a single infected case at time t (for t>0). Knowledge of R t is very relevant for the control of the epidemic [3] . If R t <1, each case will, on average, produce less than one secondary case, and the epidemic will tend to die out, even if no further measures are applied. However, if R t >1, each case will, on average, produce more than one secondary case, and extra measures will be needed to control the epidemic. The proportion of the population that would need to be protected to achieve the eradication of the disease (p) can be estimated as: p>1-(1/R t ) [2] . Therefore, the higher the value of R t , the more difficult it will be to control the epidemic. Both R 0 and R t are usually derived from explicit deterministic susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) models, and estimated by fitting a equations to epidemic (case or seroprevalence) data [4, 5] . However, there are two problems associated with this approach. First, many assumptions need to be made, for example about the size of the susceptible population, which in the context of an epidemic is continuously expanding. Second, R 0 and R t are estimated as mean values, without consideration of how these parameters vary over both space and time, thereby excluding spatio-temporal information of considerable epidemiological importance [6] . To overcome these difficulties, Haydon and collaborators [4] developed a method based on the construction and analysis of epidemic trees, which has the advantage that the case-reproduction ratio can be estimated directly from epidemic data [7] .",

For the estimation of the EIP, the mean daily temperatures at the point location of each farm, for 50 days after the date of infection of the farm were obtained. Temperature data was taken from the UK Met Office's Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model, the Unified Model [17] . For the time period of this study data is available from the European domain of the model at a horizontal resolution of 12km. Hourly values of temperature at the surface were extracted to the point location of each farm and from these daily mean temperatures were calculated. The virogenesis rate on a given day (i.e. for a given mean temperature) represented the proportion of the EIP completed that day [14] . The duration of the EIP on that farm was given by the number of days required for the summation of these proportions to reach one (i.e. for the EIP to be completed). For each infected farm, the day a farm got infected, plus the TITV, plus the number of days needed to complete the EIP, determines the day from which a given farm became infectious. Because the animals within a farm are infected (and then become infectious) progressively over time, once a farm became infectious, it was assumed to remain infectious until November (when the last infections of the epidemic occurred).",

If we look at the weekly estimations of R t for the whole of Andalusia, the high value obtained in week 1 is likely to be the result of the R t value in focus 4 (where the epidemic starts), while estimations for weeks 2 and 3 are probably linked to introduction and spread within focus 1, and the maintenance of high R t values between week 4 (22 nd of July) and week 7 (12 th of August) are highly dependent on the introduction and spread within focus 20 (the largest focus in the epidemic) (Fig 1 and Fig 2) .",

In general, the foci initiated earlier in the epidemic tended to be larger (i.e. more farms infected) (Fig 3) , and of longer duration than the foci initiated later. The results show that there was a great variation in the effectiveness of BTV spread among the 58 foci. In some foci, BTV-1 seemed to fail to establish a continuous transmission within the new area, and none or a few secondary cases were produced (e.g. foci 10 and 11 in Fig 2) . In fact, of the 58 foci, 21 had 4 infected farms or less. However, in some other cases, BTV easily spread in the new area, and transmission was maintained for many weeks with hundreds of secondary cases, for example focus 4 (791 cases in 18 weeks) and focus 1 (748 cases in 18 weeks) (Fig 2) .

Between weeks 10 and 16 (mid-October), increase of EIPs becomes steeper, going from a mean of 5.7 days between weeks 3 and 9 to mean of 9.3 days between weeks 10 and 16, which results in a rapid decrease of R t values, that after week 13 are close to 0 (Fig 2  and Fig 4) . After week 16 (mid-October), the EIPs of infected farms were frequently above 20 days, and in many cases temperatures did not allow the completion of the EIP. Fig 5 shows the relationship between the weekly R t values for the whole epidemic and the mean weekly temperatures at the farms affected by the epidemic. For the first half of the epidemic (between the 1 st of July and the 2 nd of September) temperatures were more or less constant at approximately 25\u00b0C, while R t values showed a decreasing trend. In contrast, for the second half of the epidemic (between the 9 th of September and the 4 th of November) decreasing mean temperatures coincided with a further decrease of R t values, which fell below the threshold of 1 when temperatures dropped below 21\u00b0C. We found a positive correlation between temperature and the R t values (r = 0.44), which was very close to significant (p = 0.06). Correlation analysis of the different environmental predictors potentially related to R t showed that the estimated median maximum abundance of C. imicola was correlated with the 95% upper limit of the credible interval of estimated maximum abundance of C. imicola, as well as with the median and 95% upper limit of the credible interval for total Culicoides (as C. imicola represented more than 99% of the captures in the affected areas of Andalusia). Therefore, only median estimated maximum abundance of C. imicola was retained for further analysis. There was also a positive correlation between slope and elevation (Spearman's rank correlation = 0.99), therefore only slope was retained.",

Here, we discuss the implications of these findings for management of future disease incursions, both in Andalusia, a critical point of entry for bluetongue virus strains into Europe, and further afield. The evaluation of the evolution of the monthly case-reproduction ratio of the BTV-1 epidemic for the whole of Andalusia evidenced that R t declined progressively: from 4.6 in July, to 2.2 in August, such that by September R t fell below the key threshold of 1 (value of 0.8), and by October the value was close to 0. De Koeijer and collaborators [28] estimated the temporal pattern of the basic reproduction number between herds for the BTV-8 epidemic in Northern Europe, and they obtained a value of around 4 for the second half of the summer, which progressively declined, falling below 1 by autumn. Values in Andalusia were therefore very similar to those obtained in Northern Europe despite differences in the epidemiology of BTV between the two areas, including the fact that the main vector in Andalusia is Culicoides imicola, while in Northern Europe is Culicoides obsoletus.",

This apparent discrepancy between R t and the number of infected farms may be explained by the fact that, as the epidemic advances, more and more farms become infectious, which results in an increase of the number of farms infected, but also an increase of the number of potential parents for those farms, and therefore a decrease of the values of R t . There were no significant differences between the R t values obtained by the three different algorithms used for the determination of parent farms on the basis of the distance. Regardless of the algorithm, R t values for a given focus area and period are averaged across that area and period, and therefore whether the parenthood is assigned to a given farm or its neighbour does not have a great effect on the estimate of R t for that area and period. Therefore, we can be fairly confident in the reliability of the casereproduction ratio estimated for the different areas and periods. However, a relevant difference is that when algorithm 1 (closest infectious farm) was applied, the number of potential parent farms was much lower as compared to when algorithm 2 (equal probability within a distance) was applied, as in that case, the probability of infection was shared among all the infectious farms within 5 kilometers. With algorithm 1, those particular farms, especially the farms that initiate the new foci, tended to be responsible for the infection of a great number of farms (i.e. they act as super-spreaders). In fact, with algorithm 1, the 20% most infective farms infected 87% of the total farms affected throughout the whole epidemic, close to the 20/80 rule (i.e. 20% of the population contributes to 80% of the net transmission) which applies in many disease systems [6] . That may be relevant in relation to the control of the disease, if we were able to achieve early identification of those farms, control measures would be much more effective [6] . In fact, with algorithm 1, 67% of the farms did not infect any farm, a value which is also very similar to the 70% of \"end-point\" farms obtained by Sedda and collaborators [18] for the BTV-8 epidemic in Northern Europe. When algorithm 2 was applied, the 20% most infective farms infected only 56% of the total farms affected throughout the whole epidemic, and only 10% of the farms were considered \"end-point\" farms, i.e. they have a zero probability of infecting other farms. However, for the majority of the remaining 90% farms, the probabilities of infecting other farms were very low. Finally, the values obtained with algorithm 3 (proportional to distance) were similar to those obtained with algorithm 1, as the 20% most infective farms were responsible for the infection of 88% of the total farms affected, and 62% of the farms did not contribute to any further infections.",

That heterogeneity can be more easily understood if we look at the epidemic not as a whole, but as a set of different foci, and realise that those global R t values are simply the result of the complex combination of both of local BTV transmission within established foci and BTV spread to new (distant) areas, i.e. new foci, where BTV may spread more or less efficiently depending on different factors. The mechanism by which BTV-1 jumped to those new distant areas in Andalusia to establish new foci, which implied travelling distances over 52.1 kilometers, remains uncertain. In the 2006 BTV-8 epidemic in northwest Europe, 2% of infections seemed to have occurred at distances over 31 kilometers, probably related to wind dispersal of Culicoides, although other mechanisms such as human transport of midges or virus, or movement of domestic or wild animals, could not be ruled out [18] . Unless we are able to clarify those mechanisms of long-distance dispersal, the prediction of disease spread and the establishment of effective control measures will be hampered.",

In addition, if the new focus resulted from the introduction of a recently infected host (rather than infected vectors), before local transmission could occur, the infected host needs to reach the viraemic stage and then the local vectors need to complete the EIP before onwards transmission can occur. The fact that the duration of the EIPs increased progressively throughout the epidemic, seems to indicate that the decrease in temperature may have played a more relevant role in stopping BTV-1 spread than vaccination (which mainly was applied from November onwards). However, vaccination was probably effective at preventing the persistence of the disease in the following year: only 10 cases of BTV-1 were reported in Andalusia in 2008, and they occurred by mid-October, when BTV-1 was widespread in other regions of Spain.",

However, our results indicated that the relationship was not linear, but had a more complicated pattern. This pattern is probably the result of the complex relationship between temperature and different parameters affecting BTV transmission. While higher temperatures increase the virogenesis rate (i.e., reduce the EIP) and the biting rate, and therefore favor BTV transmission, they also increase the adult vector mortality rate (i.e., reduce the Culicoides lifespan), which hampers the transmission of BTV (as reviewed in Gubbins and collaborators [29] ). As well as influencing parameters that determine BTV transmission, temperature is also one of the main determinants of Culicoides abundance, though the effect of temperature may interact with moisture availability [30] . R t values for BTV-1 in Andalusia fell below the threshold of 1 when temperatures dropped below 21\u00b0C. In contrast, in the BTV-8 epidemic in Northern Europe, the reproduction ratio between herds was estimated to drop below 1 only when temperatures fell below 15\u00b0C [31] . This divergence may be explained by differences in the adaptation to temperature of the main vectors of the BTV-1 epidemic in Andalusia (Culicoides imicola) and the BTV-8 epidemic in Northern Europe (Culicoides obsoletus). The distribution and abundance of C. imicola seems to be constrained by their relatively poor tolerance of lower temperatures [32] . On the other hand, C. imicola Kieffer infected with BTV-1 showed no apparent transmission potential at 15\u00b0C [33] .",

This is likely to be related to the importance of temperature on BTV transmission, which is consistent with the fact that the duration of EIP was found to be significantly associated with the rate of spread. The significance of overlapping foci indicates the relevance of this phenomenon in BTV transmission in Andalusia. Overlapping of disease foci may result in the underestimation of the R t value for a given focus because some of the farms within its area may be infected by farms of another (overlapping) focus, which needs to be taken into account when interpreting the R t values. Finally, the significant increase of R t with sheep density is an indication that this species was the key host in the BTV-1 epidemic in Andalusia. The negative correlation between red deer suitability and R t values is in contradiction with previous studies [10, 34] . However, this result should be interpreted with care as the correlation was weak and not statistically significant, and negativity may have been associated to the fact that many of the areas with the highest suitability are located in areas that were invaded later in the epidemic, when the conditions for BTV transmission were less favourable.",

However, taking into account the temperatures on those dates on those farms, which determine the time needed for the completion of the EIP, it seems that none of those farms became infectious before the 5 th of July. This almost simultaneous infection and the fact that these farms were located far away from each other, suggests that the BTV-1 epidemic in Andalusia in 2007 may have not been the result of a single introduction, but several almost simultaneous introductions at distant locations. In the summer of 2007 BTV-1 was circulating in Morocco, and Culicoides carried on the wind were considered as the most likely explanation for the introduction of BTV-1 into Spain, as neither bovines nor small ruminants were reported to have been imported from Morocco [10] . Therefore, BTV-1 infected Culicoides from Morocco may have been transported to these distant locations, where local transmission resulted in the initiation of different disease foci. If BTV-1 (and previously other serotypes) were believed to be introduced into Andalusia through wind transportation of infected vectors from the north of Africa, it would be reasonable to think that that phenomenon occurred not only at a single point at the start of the epidemic, but at several times and different locations throughout the epidemic. Whether wind transportation of infected vectors from the north of Africa actually occurs, and if it does, its frequency deserves further investigation, because that would have a great influence on how BTV spreads and therefore on the effectiveness of control measures.",

For example, 35 out of the 58 foci of the epidemic were reported during the 10 days that followed those restrictions. Long distance transmission, which results in new foci, may be the result of the introduction of infected vectors into the new area (e.g. transported on the wind) or of infected hosts, either domestic or wild. Further studies would be needed to clarify the relative importance of the different mechanisms of long distance spread in Andalusia, which would allow the implementation of more effective measures for the control of the disease. Failure of movement restrictions to stop BTV spread is in accordance with previous BTV epidemics, such as the BTV-8 epidemic in Northern Europe [35] .

This assumption is supported by previous studies, for example M\u00e9roc and collaborators [36] , concluded that the surveillance system based on clinical detection underestimated the real impact of the BTV epidemic, but described accurately the spatial distribution of the virus. Another problem was that as neither clinical signs nor mortality were observed in cattle, cattle herds had to be excluded from the analysis. This limitation probably did not have a great influence on the spatial distribution of the epidemic, as sheep are widely distributed and BTV-1 spread to all the provinces in Andalusia. In contrast, underreporting in cattle may have biased the estimation of the intensity of transmission in some areas, although the analysis showed that the density of cattle did not have a significant effect on the level of spread, in contrast to the density of sheep. Moreover, the cattle population represents only a 13.6% (0.6 out of 4.4 million) of the total ruminant population in Andalusia, and of the 4421 affected farms, 722 were mixed farms (sheep, goat and/or cattle in the same farm), which were included in the analysis.",

However, using a static estimate of vector abundance ignores how seasonal variation in Culicoides numbers throughout the year may have affected transmission. In fact a drop off in vector numbers in autumn may be coincident with the lengthening of the extrinsic incubation period found to significantly reduce R t in this period. Moreover, the large differences in Culicoides catches between neighbouring farms [37] indicate the limitations of extrapolating the results of entomological surveillance systems to describe the abundance of Culicoides in nearby areas. This may be why we detected no significant effect of vector abundance on the spread of BTV in the epidemic. Other estimates of R 0 value for BTV [29, 38, 39, 40] have largely considered animals as units, rather than farms (i.e. average number of secondary cases arising from the introduction of a single infected individual into a totally susceptible population) and therefore assume that animals are homogeneously distributed, rather than clustered in farms. The models by Gubbins and collaborators [29] , Hartemink and collaborators [38] and Guis and collaborators [39] are theoretical models using the density of hosts and vectors, plus several assumptions about transmission parameters. Since European Culicoides vectors are diverse, taxonomically cryptic and difficult to colonise the range of variability of many of these transmission parameters is poorly described [41] . By contrast Santman-Berends and collaborators [40] , estimated R 0 using serological field data from the BTV-8 epidemic in the Netherlands, but these data are expensive to collect and highly dependent on how well the sites selected for surveillance represent relevant environmental drivers. While Hartemink and collaborators [38] considered variability of R 0 across space and seasons, the final predictions are highly dependent on input geographical data for densities of animal hosts and vectors with their associated uncertainties. We argue that estimating the between-herd reproduction ratio for bluetongue directly from empirical epidemic data provides the best opportunity for understanding spatial and temporally variability in transmission and for linking this variability to environmental conditions. This is because relatively few simplifying assumptions and entomological parameters are required and a wide spectrum of environmental conditions that may impact BTV is potentially encompassed within farms across the whole epidemic region.",

This heterogeneity means that area-wide control measures are unlikely to be effective. Transmission was favoured by the increase in the density of sheep and by the reduction of the EIP (which is dependent on the temperature). There seemed to be a general positive correlation between temperature and R t values, although the relationship was not linear, probably as a result of the complex relationship between temperature and the different parameters affecting BTV transmission. R t values for BTV-1 in Andalusia fell below the threshold of 1 when temperatures dropped below 21\u00b0C, while for BTV-8 epidemic in Northern Europe, that occurred at 15\u00b0C. This divergence may be explained by differences in the adaptation to temperature of the main vectors of the BTV-1 epidemic in Andalusia (Culicoides imicola) and the BTV-8 epidemic in Northern Europe (Culicoides obsoletus).",

Therefore, whenever orbiviral diseases are circulating in the North of Africa, surveillance in Andalusia should be intensified (and extended beyond the closer areas), as the south of Spain is one of the main entry point for these diseases into Europe.
