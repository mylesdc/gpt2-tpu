The most common enteric viruses affecting commercial flocks in Brazil include Fowl Adenovirus of group I (FAdV-I), Chicken Parvovirus (ChPV), Chicken Astrovirus (CAstV), Avian Nephritis Virus (ANV), Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV), Avian Reovirus (AReo), and Avian Rotavirus (ARtV). The aim of this study was to identify single and multiple infections using data obtained from 270 samples from eleven Brazilian states, corresponding to the period between 2010 and 2017. This was accompanied by an analysis of the relationship between the age of birds, clinical signs, and geographical distribution, using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and Reverse Transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) techniques. Twenty-five profiles of virus combinations were detected. Single infections were encountered in 86.3% of samples, and multiple infections were present in the remaining 13.7%. Both single and multiple infections affected all kinds of commercial chickens with digestive problems, stunting syndrome, decreases in egg and meat production, increased mortality, and respiratory signs. FAdV-I, ChPV, CAstV, ANV, and ARtV were mostly detected in young broilers, in contrast with IBV, which was detected in hens from one to greater than 51 weeks of age. These results exhibit the complexity of enteric diseases and the still poorly understood role of each pathogen as a unique etiological agent.",

They cause severe economic losses for the poultry industry because they negatively affect productive parameters, causing growth retardation, low feed consumption, high mortality, poor egg and meat production, and Runting-Stunting Syndrome (RSS) [1] [2] [3] [4] . These kinds of infections affect mostly young birds, but it is common to find viral infections in birds of all ages, including broilers, layers, and breeders [5] . The main enteric viruses reported to cause enteric diseases are found in single and multiple infections and include the Fowl Adenovirus of group I (FAdV-I); Chicken Parvovirus (ChPV); two viruses from the Astroviridae family: Chicken Astrovirus (CAstV) and Avian Nephritis Virus (ANV); two viruses from the Reoviridae family: Avian Reovirus (AReo) and Avian Rotavirus (ARtV); and a member of the Coronaviridae family, Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV) [4, [6] [7] [8] [9] .

Fowl adenovirus sequences were characterized according to their position in the phylogenetic tree ( Figure 1 ). Isolate 424-4 was clustered with the reference sequence of strain TR59 with a bootstrap value of 100 in the common ancestral line, suggesting that this isolate should be classified into the FAdV-8a serotype. Isolate 420-12 was clustered with reference sequences of strain 764, and some isolates originated from China and Peru, with a bootstrap value of 100 in the common ancestor of the 6 sequences, suggesting that this isolate should be classified as FAdV-8b serotype. Isolate 471-14 clustered with the reference sequence of strain ATCC, suggesting that this isolate should be classified as FAdV-11 serotype. Isolates 475-5, 656-3, 691-6, and 752-3, clustered with reference sequences of Avian Nephritis Virus from the United States, Korea, Australia, China, and Japan, and a second group of isolates (541-2, 541-12, and 541-16) were clustered with reference sequences of chicken astrovirus from India and the United States, showing high bootstrap values for each group of both types of astroviruses detected in this study ( Figure 2 ). The three sequences that were positive for ARtV were analyzed with reference sequences from the United States, Peru, South Korea, Ireland, Germany, and Nigeria, all of them clustering with a high bootstrap value with the common ancestor. Reference sequences for groups D, F, and G rotavirus were used as external groups to show the differentiation of the positive samples from Avian Rotavirus A (Figure 3) . Isolate 806-1 clustered with reference sequences of AReo from Hungary. The branch lengths and low bootstrap values from the common ancestor for reference sequences from Hungary, the United States, and China, all show the magnitude of the genetic change among different isolates from these countries (Figure 4 ). The three isolates corresponding to ChPV were analyzed phylogenetically with strains from different countries from America, Europe, and Asia ( Figure 5) .",

            "text": "Many etiological agents, such as bacteria, fungi, parasites, mycotoxins, and viruses, are related to enteric diseases. Enteric viruses have been considered the main causative etiological agents of RSS and acute enteric disturbances that negatively affect the yield of commercial chickens [1, 2, 4, 22, 23] . The most common viruses associated with the enteric diseases of chickens and turkeys include FAdV-I, ChPV, CAstV, ANV, IBV, AReo, and ARtV [7, 9] . Clinical signs reported for each sample used in this study were related to digestive problems (diarrhea and feed intake), respiratory signs, stunting, high mortality, and a decrease in egg and meat production, which is consistent with results for clinical signs of enteric viruses obtained in other studies around the world [3, 4, 7, [24] [25] [26] [27] . Molecular techniques such as PCR and nucleotide sequencing were employed due to their wide use in the diagnosis of enteric viruses [9, 22, 28] . The association of enteric virus with the age of broilers, breeders, and layers (Tables 4 and 5) showed that molecular diagnosis of these viruses can be performed at different stages of production, which can be useful in the control of vertical infections. For example, in our results, ChPV, ANV, and IBV were present in broilers in the first week of age (Table 8) , constituting possible vertical transmission. A high number of enteric viruses were found in birds from all ages and in different stages of production, both in broilers and hens (Tables 4 and 5) . Enteric viral infections mostly affect young birds, probably due to their immature intestine epithelium, which is the first organ affected during a viral infection. This results in poor feed absorption with the consequent general symptoms [5] . FAdV-I was detected in young and old birds (Tables 4 and 5) , corroborating results obtained previously [29] , where the virus was found in several samples from broilers, layers, and domestic chickens of all ages, even though the clinical signs were more severe in younger birds [30] . ChPV infections affect young birds in their first four weeks [23, 27] , which is supported by our findings since the virus was detected in 20 infected samples from broilers between 1 and 28 days old (Table 8 ). AReo was found in 15/333 detections, corresponding to broilers in the growth phase (Table 8) , especially between 8 to 28 days old, showing that rotavirus infections mainly affect young birds, promoting RSS and enteric lesions [1] . Both astroviruses, CAstV and ANV, were found in samples from young broilers, despite having nine positive samples from breeders older than 51 weeks old (Table 8) . Astrovirus infections usually affect young birds [24] , although these viruses can be found in older birds in single and multiple infections with other enteric viruses [8] . IBV affects birds of virtually all ages [31] as demonstrated by our results, where samples of broilers, layers, and breeders from one week and greater than 51 weeks (Table 8) presented positive results for coronavirus in all digestive organs tested, despite the fact that some clinical signs reported for these samples were respiratory signs. Enteric viruses such as FAdV-I, ChPV, CAstV, ANV, IBV, and ARtV were present in the liver, intestines, and pancreas. Caecal tonsils and cloacal swabs were used exclusively for diagnosis of IBV (Table 7 ). Viral particles of FAdV-I were found in the liver, intestines, and pancreas. The organs where this virus can be detected are the liver, intestines, caecal tonsils, proventriculus, bursa of Fabricius, thymus, spleen, lungs and kidneys [32] [33] [34] [35] , especially in the first week of infection. Based on the pancreatic tissue samples that were positive for FAdV-I (5/28) (Table 7) , we confirmed the importance of this organ for diagnosis of diseases caused by fowl adenovirus and even in cases of pancreatitis [36] . ChPV was detected in the liver, intestines, and pancreas, which are areas commonly used for ChPV detection due its pathogenicity as an enteric virus, considering the variety of organs where this virus can be found, including the brain, duodenal loop, and even on cloacal swabs [27, 37, 38] . Astroviruses, such as CAstV and ANV, are commonly detected in the digestive organs and fecal samples of sick and healthy birds [39] [40] [41] , supporting our findings of astrovirus in the liver, intestines, and pancreas (Table 7) . IBV can be detected in the intestinal content, trachea, lung, liver, bursa of Fabricius, pancreas, thymus, kidney, proventriculus, and spleen of affected birds [13, 42] , according to the dynamic distribution of the virus, resulting in a wide range of useful organs for molecular detection of this virus, which in our case helped to determine the presence of the pathogen in liver, intestine, pancreas, cloacal swabs, and caecal tonsils (Table 7) . In our study, we found three different serotypes of FAdV-I, without ruling out the possibility of multiple FAdV infections in the same sample because multiple strains of different serotypes can affect to the same animal [29] . Multiple infections between FAdV-I and other enteric viruses were found in our study, especially with ChPV, ANV, and IBV, supporting previous results showing that FAdV-I is often present in co-infections with other enteric viruses including CAstV, AReo, and ARtV [7] . ChPV was present in co-infections with one to four viruses, including IBV, ANV, FAdV-I, and CAstV, which has also been reported in metagenomic [3] and epidemiological surveys [38] with broilers showing RSS. The most common virus found in this study belongs to the family Coronaviridae, which indicates the presence of Infectious Bronchitis Virus in the processed samples. A high percentage of positive samples (60.7%) ( Table 3 .) indicated the presence of single IBV infections, probably due to the absence of co-infections with other enteric viruses or because only IBV analysis was requested. IBV co-infections with multiple enteric viruses were demonstrated in 32 samples (Table 2 ), making it difficult to define the exact role of IBV in enteric diseases [43] , especially in multiple viral infections. All of the enteric viruses detected during 2010 and 2017 are widely distributed around the world. FAdV-I, found in this study, is a common virus, widely distributed in Brazil and well-reported throughout the world [9, 13, [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] , demonstrating its wide distribution among commercial birds. The phylogenetic tree showed that ChPV has a well-conserved genome in non-structural genic regions, as evidenced by the branch sizes in comparison with reference sequences from GenBank, further demonstrating the distribution of ChPV around the world [14, 49, 50] . Astroviruses affecting commercial flocks are also widely distributed worldwide [28, 39, 51] . Phylogenetic analysis of astroviruses clustered ANV and CAstV in two different groups, and each of them was sub-grouped with the nucleotide sequences of the RNA polymerase gene from isolates originating in North-America and Asia, providing a resource to determine the global distribution of these viruses. The ARtV analyzed in this study showed a close phylogenetic relationship with isolates from the United States, Peru, South Korea, Ireland, Germany, Nigeria, and Brazil, particularly in the length of the branches in the phylogenetic tree, which may confirm the complete distribution of the virus around the world [22, 24, [52] [53] [54] . Coronaviruses such as IBV are some of the most widely distributed enteric viruses in Brazil and have attracted special interest from the poultry industry due the economic losses caused by its impact on the health of birds [55] [56] [57] . The geographical distribution of the enteric viruses analyzed in this study was reported previously in some regions from the Brazilian territory. According to this study, FAdV-I was disseminated in the states of Paraiba, Pernambuco, S\u00e3o Paulo, and Santa Catarina, in addition to previously reported isolates of FAdV-I and ChPV from the state of Rio Grande do Sul [58] . CAstV was found in samples from Minas Gerais, and the other member of the family, Astroviridae (ANV), was found in samples from Ceara, Paraiba, Pernambuco, Bahia, Minas Gerais, and S\u00e3o Paulo, increasing the previously reported distribution of astroviruses in the states of Rio Grande do Sul, Parana, and Mato Grosso [59, 60] . ChPV was distributed in the states of Ceara, Paraiba, Pernambuco, Bahia, Minas Gerais, and S\u00e3o Paulo, supporting the results of [38] , who reported the presence of this virus in an outbreak in S\u00e3o Paulo, and expanding upon the report of [27] , who worked with isolates of ChPV from poultry farms in the state of Rio Grande do Sul. The ARtV results suggest that this virus was disseminated in the states of Pernambuco, Minas Gerais, and S\u00e3o Paulo, consistent with other previous reports that describe the presence of ARtV in the states of Minas Gerais, Parana, Rio Grande do Sul, and Goias [61, 62] . IBV is the most disseminated virus among Poultry flocks in Brazil [63] . This virus requires more specific analysis for the characterization of the different genotypes that affect commercial chickens in Brazilian states and other countries in South America, to determine the epidemiological dynamics and pathogenesis of the virus within the poultry industry.",
