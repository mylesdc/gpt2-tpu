            "text": "Background: A variety of different sampling devices are currently available to acquire air samples for the study of the microbiome of the air. All have a degree of technical complexity that limits deployment. Here, we evaluate the use of a novel device, which has no technical complexity and is easily deployable. Results: An air-cleaning device powered by electrokinetic propulsion has been adapted to provide a universal method for collecting samples of the aerobiome. Plasma-induced charge in aerosol particles causes propulsion to and capture on a counter-electrode. The flow of ions creates net bulk airflow, with no moving parts. A device and electrode assembly have been re-designed from air-cleaning technology to provide an average air flow of 120 lpm. This compares favorably with current air sampling devices based on physical air pumping. Capture efficiency was determined by comparison with a 0.4 \u03bcm polycarbonate reference filter, using fluorescent latex particles in a controlled environment chamber. Performance was compared with the same reference filter method in field studies in three different environments. For 23 common fungal species by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), there was 100 % sensitivity and apparent specificity of 87 %, with the reference filter taken as \"gold standard.\" Further, bacterial analysis of 16S RNA by amplicon sequencing showed equivalent community structure captured by the electrokinetic device and the reference filter. Unlike other current air sampling methods, capture of particles is determined by charge and so is not controlled by particle mass. We analyzed particle sizes captured from air, without regard to specific analyte by atomic force microscopy: particles at least as low as 100 nM could be captured from ambient air. Conclusions: This work introduces a very simple plug-and-play device that can sample air at a high-volume flow rate with no moving parts and collect particles down to the sub-micron range. The performance of the device is substantially equivalent to capture by pumping through a filter for microbiome analysis by quantitative PCR and amplicon sequencing.",

            "text": "These technologies include filters, impingers, impactors, and wet or dry cyclones. The underlying principle of impactors, impingers, and cyclones is the use of an abrupt change in direction of airflow so that aerosol particles will continue on to a surface by virtue of their momentum. Filters are microporous membranes, impingers capture on to the surface of a nutrient agar plate for subsequent colony counts, and impactors capture on a solid surface for subsequent elution, as do dry cyclones. Wet cyclones capture by vortexing into a liquid phase. Aerosol particles may also be separated into size classes with multi-stage devices. For existing devices, capture efficiency falls off rapidly with particle size and there is considerable variability in performance [16] [17] [18] . All of these devices require pumping against some resistance. Different apparent microbial communities were found from the use of different air sampling techniques [11, 13] . There is thus a need in aerobiome analysis for a sampling procedure that does not bias the measured biodiversity. Here, we introduce the use of a very simple device for collection of samples and show equivalence to a reference method using filtration. In addition, a variety of air sampling methods have been applied to the airborne transmission of disease [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] .",

A corona wire is subject to a high voltage, creating plasma that imparts charge on particles in the vicinity. The charged particles are then propelled by the voltage gradient to electrodes at an opposing potential. The net flow of charged particles imparts forward momentum on the surrounding medium. The result is a net airflow with no moving parts. This principle has been used in commercial air-cleaning devices [33] . Custis et al. [34] used such an air-cleaning device for collecting dust from the air for measuring allergens. We have developed a mini-scale device using the same principle with optimized airflow and an electrode cartridge that is optimized for sample collection (Inspirotec Sampler). We have demonstrated its use for detection of allergens by immunoassay [35, 36] and viruses by quantitative PCR [37] . The device is simple to operate, compact, and can be placed unobtrusively in any environment. Here, we compare performance with a filter reference method for analysis of the aerobiome.",

If this Table 1 Mold spores in three locations A Inspirotec Sampler, B filter. Spore equivalent values were determined by multiplex qPCR (see \"Methods\" section). Green shading: detectable by both methods; yellow: detectable by Inspirotec Sampler only; no shading: below the limit of detection of the qPCR correction were applied, the values would all be consistent within the standard deviations achievable by the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Those cases where the species was detected by both methods are indicated by green shading. In no instance was a species detectable by the filter and not detectable by the Inspirotec Sampler. In eight instances, the Inspirotec Sampler detected a species that was not detected by the filter, indicated by yellow shading in Table 1 . By this criterion, if the filter is considered a gold standard, the sensitivity is 100 % and the specificity is 87 %. However, these are likely to be true positives since the Inspirotec Sampler is sampling a larger volume of air in a given time. To address this concern, we examined the accumulation rate for Eurotium amstelodami on both filters and the Inspirotec Sampler (Fig. 1 ). This shows that the Inspirotec Sampler processed both a larger volume, and correspondingly, a larger quantity of spore equivalents were captured, when compared to the filter. As with Table 1 , these numbers have not been corrected for capture efficiency. It is not clear why the quantity of spore equivalents captured appears to peak at 6 h for both filter sampling and Inspirotec Sampler. Nevertheless, this illustrates the advantage of the high sampling volume of the Inspirotec Sampler. This advantage is compounded by the Inspirotec Sampler's easier logistical set-up and silent performance.",

In a separate study [37] , we showed the capability of capturing Venezuelan equine encaphilitis virus in a controlled environment chamber at the US Army Edgewood Chemical Biological Center with aerosol particles down to 1 \u03bcm. The viruses had been inactivated by gamma irradiation. The result was that a large proportion of the original virions had RNA that was not amplifiable, so the capture efficiency was apparently very low based on the original virus titer. However, analysis by digital PCR using the Poisson distribution at low amplicon concentrations showed that the capture efficiency was in the range of 20-40 % for these articles. Here, the performance exceeded that of the reference method using a microporous filter and showed ability to detect mold spores using EPA-accepted PCR technology [41] .

[13] found that the diversity of microbial communities captured by different samplers in external environments in Norway and Sweden were similar, whereas Hoisington et al. [11] have found significant inconsistencies between different sampler types at locations within a US retail store. In neither case was consideration made to the time of run needed to resolve reagent background. We showed that a minimum of 6 h sampling was required regardless of the method. We demonstrate the application of ionic propulsion technology to capture a wider range of particle sizes than with traditional air filter sampling, with no significant bias in fungal and bacterial community recovery.",

            "text": "Inspirotec Samplers and accompanying electrode cartridges were provided by Inspirotec LLC (Glenview, IL). A commercial air cleaner was modified to achieve a unidirectional flow. The disposable capture cartridges were designed to optimize capture of aerosol particles and for easy release into extraction tubes. They were made by 3D printing at Exact Prototyping, Joliet, IL, and stainless steel electrode strips by Lakeshore Cutting Solutions, Zeeland, MI. Electrodes were finished by Able Electropolishing, Chicago, IL. Cartridges were washed with 70 % isopropanol and air dried, and electrodes were washed with isopropanol and dried in a vacuum oven for 30 min at 180\u00b0C. Assembled cartridges and electrodes were heatsealed into polyethylene bags until use. Once the electrodes have been released, they cannot be re-used. There is no potentially non-sterile surface that physically contacts the electrodes between removal from the bag and release into the collection tube. An updated version of the Inspirotec Sampler has a block of honeycomb-structured MnO 2 catalyst covering the outlet. This modification removes traces of ozone from the effluent air but does not affect performance. Samplers and cartridges can be purchased by sending an email to the senior author with heading \"research request.\" The sampler will have a lower cost than any alternative system.",

Fluorescence of captured microspheres was with a Turner Quantech fluorometer. The reference samplers were run at 14 lpm.

Individual electrodes were placed into sterile 15-ml conical tubes with 1 ml of sterile water. Samples were extracted for 1 min on a Vortex Genie (MO BIO Laboratories, Inc., Carlsbad, CA). Their standard PowerSoil extraction was performed according to the manufacturer's suggested protocol with the addition of a 20-min incubation at 65\u00b0C after addition of solution C1, as suggested by the Earth Microbiome Project. Genomic DNA was amplified using the Earth Microbiome Project barcoded primer set, adapted for MiSeq (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA) by adding nine extra bases in the adapter region of the forward amplification primer that support paired-end sequencing. The V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene (515F-806R) was amplified with region-specific primers that included the Illumina flow cell adapter sequences. The reverse amplification primer also contained a 12-base barcode sequence that supports pooling of up to 2167 different samples in each lane. Each 25-\u03bcl PCR reaction contains 12 \u03bcl of MO BIO PCR water (certified DNA-free), 10 \u03bcl of 5 Prime HotMasterMix (5 \u03bcM concentration), 1 \u03bcl of forward primer (5 \u03bcM concentration, 200 pM final), 1 \u03bcl Golay barcode-tagged reverse primer (5 \u03bcM concentration, 200 pM final), and 1 \u03bcl of template DNA. The conditions for PCR were as follows: 94\u00b0C for 3 min to denature the DNA, with 35 cycles at 94\u00b0C for 45 s, 50\u00b0C for 60s, and 72\u00b0C for 90s; and with a final extension of 10 min at 72\u00b0C to ensure complete amplification. PCR amplifications were completed in triplicate and then pooled. Following pooling, amplicons were quantified using PicoGreen (Invitrogen) and a plate reader. Once quantified, different volumes of each of the products were pooled into a single tube so that each amplicon was represented equally. This pool was then cleaned using the UltraClean\u00ae PCR Clean-Up Kit (MO BIO) and quantified using Qubit (Invitrogen). Sequencing of the prepared library was performed on the Illumina MiSeq platform, using the sequencing primers and procedures described in the supplementary methods of Caporaso et al. [50] .",
