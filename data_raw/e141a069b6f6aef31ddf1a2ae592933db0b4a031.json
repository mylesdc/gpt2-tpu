Rather than mapping read segments of predefined lengths and positions, ViReMa dynamically generates moving read segments. ViReMa initially attempts to align the 5 0 end of a read to the reference genome(s) with the Bowtie seed-based alignment. A new read segment is then made by either extracting any unaligned nucleotides at the 3 0 end of the read or by trimming the first nucleotide from the read. This continues iteratively until all portions of the read are either mapped or trimmed. With multiple reference genomes, it is possible to detect virus-to-host or inter-virus recombination. ViReMa is also capable of detecting insertion and substitution events and multiple recombination junctions within a single read. By mapping the distribution of recombination events in the genome of flock house virus, we demonstrate that this information can be used to discover de novo functional motifs located in conserved regions of the viral genome.",

Recently, the use of next-generation sequencing (NGS) has risen dramatically in virus discovery and the identification of emerging pathogens (1) (2) (3) , the characterization of the human virome (4), the analysis of established infectious agents (5, 6) , the quality control of live attenuated viruses (7, 8) and to understand the mutant spectra of viruses. NGS can be used to discover and characterize both homologous (9) and non-homologous recombination (10) . Viral recombination generates considerable genetic diversity and plays a central role in the evolution and emergence of new viruses (11) . Recombination can reshuffle single mutations that originally occurred on different, but homologous, viral genomes, resulting in the accumulation of advantageous mutations or the removal of deleterious ones. Homologous recombination between co-infecting viruses may also result in the evolution of new virus strains, as was observed among picornaviruses including human rhinoviruses (12) and between vaccine-derived polioviruses and circulating enteroviruses (13) .",

Defective genomes evolve during persistent and acute infections in cell culture (14) as well as during wild infections (15, 16) . The evolution of defective genomes was proposed to be critical in the transition of acute to chronic viral infections (17) and was found in patients persistently infected with measles virus (18) , dengue virus (19) and hepatitis C virus (20) . Virus-to-host recombination events are relatively rare as compared with intra-viral genome recombinations; however, such events may have important biological consequences such as the selective advantage conferred to hepatitis E virus on insertion of a 171-nt fragment from human S17 ribosomal protein mRNA (21) .",

ViReMa does not require any pre-treatment of the original dataset beyond standard quality-filtering and does not require any special reference library generation. In addition to single recombination events, multiple recombination events within a single read are detected, as are virus-to-host recombination and insertion and substitution events. Using ViReMa, we demonstrate that by mapping the distribution and frequency of recombination events in the genome of flock house virus (FHV), we can discover de novo functional genomic motifs required for viral replication and encapsidation.

Consequently, Bowtie will report the locations of a successfully mapping seed regardless of the number of mismatched nucleotides that follow it. These mismatches are reported in the 13th field of the standard sequence alignment map (SAM) output (28) . For example, a 75-nt read that successfully aligns to a reference sequence but with only one mismatch might report 'MD:Z:45C29' in this field. However, a 75-nt read that maps over a recombination junction might read: 'MD:Z:45C0G0G0C0C0G3G0A0G0G0A0T0C0C0A0-A1T0T0T1A1G0T0C1'. From this, we can determine that the first 45 nucleotides from the read have been successfully aligned, but the remaining 30 nucleotides are predominantly mismatched to the reference sequence. (Note that the CIGAR string will still read '75M'.) The first 45 aligned nucleotides thus correspond to the 5 0 region of a putative recombination junction up until the recombination breakpoint. The remaining nucleotides in the read after a detected breakpoint can then be extracted from the sequence alignment map file and used to generate a new read segment for use in another Bowtie alignment.",

Using a standard Apple Intel workstation with 16 Gb RAM and 8 physical core processors, this analysis was performed in <20 min. This yielded 1 385 173 recombination events (Table 2) , an improvement in sensitivity of 3%. This small improvement is despite the fact that ViReMa uses a stricter mapping procedure. When determining which reads had been successfully mapped with the ViReMa algorithm, but not by the pseudo-library alignment, we found that all of these reads contained multiple events within the read. This is why the majority of the extra events were detected in FHV RNA 1, which harbored the largest number of recombination events among the FHV genome and many of which occurred in proximity to one another. Furthermore, in addition to the improved sensitivity, we were also able to detect several other events, including intra-host and host-to-virus recombination events, insertion and substitution events, and some 'unknown' events that contain fragments of either viral or host RNA as well as a large number of trimmed nucleotides (Table 3) .",

These observations correlate well with previous studies that have demonstrated the necessity for the 5 0 and 3 0 -UTRs for efficient RNA replication (31) (32) (33) (34) (35) . Similarly, a short motif is present in RNA 2 at nt 186-217 that forms a bulged stem loop and acts as a signal for RNA 2 packaging into virions (36) . We would observe conservation of this packaging motif, as we only sequenced encapsidated RNAs. The internal regions at nt 538-616 in RNA 2 and at nt 68-205, nt 1227-1243 and nt 2322-3011 in RNA 1 have also previously been demonstrated to contain sequence motifs that are required for replication (31, 33, 37) .

            "text": "There are number of highly cited software packages already available that address the complex issue of detecting recombination junctions. In contrast to these packages that extract individual segments of a pre-determined length and position from a read, ViReMa provides a unique approach by dynamically generating moving segments for alignment. After an initial seed-based alignment, a new read segment is obtained from any unaligned nucleotides at the 3 0 end of the read. Alternatively, if a mapping cannot be found, the seed position is adjusted by trimming a single nucleotide from the beginning of the current segment. Consequently, ViReMa provides a highly sensitive and versatile platform for recombination discovery and it is not limited to specific reads lengths and it can handle reference genomes of any size. ViReMa is also capable of detecting multiple recombination events within a read, insertions and substitutions as well as more complex recombination events where they may be a small number of inserted nucleotides between recombination junctions. Our algorithm is aimed at detecting the maximum number of recombination events and is almost exhaustive in its search for recombination events. In our analysis of over 31 million reads, >2.35 million recombination events were detected, 180 075 recombination events could not be unambiguously identified and <11 000 reads could not be mapped. Owing to artifactual recombination events that inevitably creep into cDNA-sequencing libraries (38) , such an exhaustive search prompts consideration of the handling of false-positive recombination events. Many recombination detection algorithms are focused on the detection of splice-junctions in eukaryotic mRNA or in the detection of chromosomal rearrangements or fusions in the DNA of tumorigenic cells. These programs implement strict noise-reducing filters to remove any potential false-positive hits and any putative junction must be confirmed by the presence of multiple aligning reads or by paired reads that span a recombination junction. This is suitable in cases such as eukaryotic RNA splicing, as there should be only one or a limited number of biologically correct fusion junctions and as these junctions are likely to contain canonical splicing site consensus sequences. However, this is not a good assumption in the case of RNA or DNA recombination in viral genomes. As many thousands of genome copies may be generated in a single replication cycle and as a deeply-sequenced viral genome will contain reads derived from a large pool of viral quasispecies, we should expect to find a wide range of possible recombination sites. Moreover, the mechanisms of DNA or RNA recombination may vary between species. For example, RNA template switching has been shown to occur most frequently in AU-rich regions of the brome mosaic virus RNA genome (39) , whereas poliovirus has been demonstrated to favor GC-rich tracts (9) . Consequently, we cannot exclude events based on the sequence information alone. Therefore, suitable controls must be used to obtain a base-line rate for artifactual recombination during the generation of the cDNAsequencing libraries. This can be achieved by comparing the recombination in the viral genome with non-viral templates such as in vitro transcribed RNA. Similarly, artifactual recombination can be directly detected by mixing separate samples before cDNA library generation (9) .",

Also, the sample would not need to be purified as with sufficient sequencing read depth, the non-viral sequence reads can be removed computationally to reveal just the relevant virus data (40) .

If a mapping is found, ViReMa generates a new read segment from any unaligned nucleotides at the 3 0 end of the read. If not, ViReMa trims the first nucleotide. If there are sufficient nucleotides present in the new segment, it is written into a new data file and again mapped by Bowtie. This continues iteratively until all portions of the read are either mapped or trimmed or a combination of both.Example Read with 65 nts, seed length chosen in command line (e.#3: Again, no mapping found for new seed, first nt is trimmed.",

This reveals conserved regions of the FHV genome that are required for replication or encapsidation.
