We investigated the effects of experimental human HRV serotype 16 infection on the upper respiratory tract microbiota. Methods: Six healthy volunteers were infected with HRV16. We performed 16S ribosomal RNA-targeted pyrosequencing on throat swabs taken prior, during and after infection. We compared overall community diversity, phylogenetic structure of the ecosystem and relative abundances of the different bacteria between time points. Results: During acute infection strong trends towards increases in the relative abundances of Haemophilus parainfluenzae and Neisseria subflava were observed, as well as a weaker trend towards increases of Staphylococcus aureus. No major differences were observed between day-1 and day 60, whereas differences between subjects were very high.",

These communities are an integral part of our commensal airway microbiota and likely contribute to infection and disease. HRV infection and the subsequent host response [11] [12] [13] [14] change the upper airway local environment and will likely alter the microbiota composition. Insights into HRV induced changes in microbiota composition could contribute to our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of bacterial super-infection and could help to predict secondary bacterial infections thereby ultimately contributing to preventive strategies and tools. Most human studies to date have been retrospective, showing epidemiological correlations between HRV and the presence of potential respiratory pathogens [15] [16] [17] . Such correlation, however, do not necessarily implicate causality and interpretation of these data warrants caution. Most studies of the lung microbiota have been cross-sectional, observational and descriptive in nature [18] .",

Upon enrolment the volunteers were screened to ensure the absence of circulating antibodies against tuberculosis, HRV16, Human T-lymphotropic virus Type 1 (HTLV-1) and 2 (HTLV-2), Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and Hepatitis A, B and C virus (HAV, HBV, HCV). Acute infection with Influenza A and B, enterovirus sp., adenovirus sp., rhinovirus sp., human metapneumovirus, human respiratory syncytial virus sp., parainfluenza viruses 1-4, human parechovirus, human bocavirus, coronavirus sp., Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, legionella sp. was excluded through validated PCR assays on nasal lavage and throat swabs. These throat swabs were collected to serve as baseline microbiota measures. One day later volunteers were experimentally infected with HRV16 (details below), which has been shown to cause mild common-cold symptoms. Nasal lavages and throat swabs were performed daily for 7 days. On day 60 a convalescent throat swab was taken. All volunteers were requested to report common cold and asthma symptoms daily until day 7 after rhinovirus challenge using a standardized cold symptom score [20] . Diaries were collected at the final visit.",

Microbial community comparisons were performed using parametric statistics in R, with the P values corrected by multiple hypothesis testing using the false discovery rate (FDR) [30] . To assess differences in overall community structure the data of all volunteers were pooled per time point and diversity measures (alpha diversity measures Shannon index, Simpson index and Chao1) [28] . Considering that the alpha diversity indices (i.e. Shannon diversity and Chao1) are sensitive to the original number of sequences generated from a given sample [31] we calculated the Shannon and Simpson diversity and Chao1 for normalized numbers of sequences for each separate sample.

No significant changes were observed between day -1 and day 60 specimens at genus or species level. However, at the genus level, a significant increase (p < 0.05) in relative abundance of Haemophilus and Neisseria was observed during infection. Analysis of these genera to species level show significantly increased Haemophilus parainfluenzae (p-value = 0.0098) and Neisseria subflava (p-value = 0.012). However, false discovery rate (FDR) correction for multiple comparisons showed an above threshold risk of type-I error for all these taxa (FDR = 0.12). Additionally, the largest fold-change observed was a 1200 % (13-fold) increase in the abundance of the genus Staphylococcus (p = 0.0749 FDR 0.518), which only represents 0.2 % of the total sequences identified (Fig. 5) . Analysis to species level shows a weak trend towards increases in Staphylococcus aureus abundance (p-value = 0.0856 FDR = 0.245).",

At a species level, increases were observed of Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Staphylococcus aureus and Neisseria subflava species. These increases in genera and species during HRV16 infection were observed in nearly all volunteers who carried these at baseline and relative abundances returned to baseline levels after the infection was cleared. Due to the limited number of study subjects (n = 6) and the stringent correction for multiple observations, these changes did not reach statistical significance. Nevertheless, it is striking that from over one hundred genera detected, substantial increases are recorded for 2 genera generally associated with secondary bacterial infections after HRV16 infection (Heamophilus and Staphylococcus).",

However, in contrast with our findings, the microbiota of HRV infected healthy volunteers (i.e. without COPD) from the study by Molyneaux et al. did not seem to be affected [32] which may be explained by differences in study design, e.g. the use of sputum specimens vs. throat swabs. Interestingly, in asymptomatic Aboriginal children the presence of HRV was significantly associated with the presence of H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis in nasopharyngeal aspirates [15] . In a Dutch cohort of otitis-prone children, HRV positivity was significantly associated with the presence of Streptococcus pneumoniae and M. catarrhalis in the nasopharynx, but not with that of H. influenzae [17] . A later study in healthy children showed that H. influenzae was positively associated with the presence of HRV [16] .",
