A small fraction of influenza virus infections are severe, requiring hospitalization, and some infections can be fatal. Apart from deaths caused by primary viral pneumonia, influenza virus infections can also lead to secondary bacterial infections 1 , and can exacerbate underlying medical conditions such as cardiovascular disease 2 . One approach to quantify the disease burden of influenza is to estimate the incidence rate of hospitalizations of patients with severe acute respiratory illnesses and laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infections, and the incidence of severe outcomes in those patients, along with population denominators 3 . However, this can underestimate the full burden of influenza because not all patients with severe outcomes after influenza virus infections present for medical attention or are tested for influenza virus, and because even among those that are tested some influenza virus infections will not be laboratory confirmed, particularly if there is a delay between infection and the exacerbation of an underlying condition 4 .",

Age-specific ILI rates are not reported. Laboratory data on influenza virus detections by type/subtype and the total number of specimens submitted for diagnostic testing or for surveillance purposes are reported by the Public Health Laboratory Services. We combined outpatient surveillance data and laboratory detections into four time-series of proxy measures for influenza virus activity in the community, denoted as ILI+ proxies, by multiplying the rate of ILI consultations per 1000 consultations with the proportion of specimens testing positive for each type/subtype of influenza. We constructed ILI+ proxies for pre-pandemic influenza A(H1N1), influenza A(H3N2), influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, and for influenza B. We previously reported that this ILI+ proxy for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was the closest linear correlate of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infections in the general community 10 . We used the weekly hospitalization rate of acute bronchiolitis associated with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (ICD-9: 466.11) in children <1 year of age as the proxy for RSV activity 14 .

We used linear regression, assuming an additive relation between influenza activity and mortality rates or hospitalization rates, which might be preferred to models assuming a multiplicative increase in the outcomes associated with additive changes in influenza activity [6] [7] [8] . The models also included temperature, absolute humidity, and RSV activity using the RSV proxy described above. Another covariate was included into the models for mortality rates to account for the impact of the transition of coding system (ie, from ICD-9 to ICD-10) for mortality data, in Hong Kong since 2001 7 . We also included a covariate into the models for hospitalization rates to account for the impact of public holidays on hospital admissions. We excluded the time period when the outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) were reported from the analysis, i.e. from 11 February 2003 when the World Health Organization first received reports from China on an outbreak of acute respiratory syndrome occurred in Guangdong province, to 28 May 2004 when the Hong Kong government lowered the Alert Level of SARS response system.",

Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was associated with the highest excess respiratory hospitalization rate in older children 6-15 y and young adults 16-44 y among all types/subtypes of influenza virus (Table 1) . We found that the proportions of cause-specific mortality and hospitalization attributable to influenza varied across different types/subtypes of influenza virus. The estimated contribution of influenza viruses to all-cause mortality and all-cause hospitalizations was approximately double the impact on respiratory mortality and hospitalizations respectively ( Table 2) . Influenza A(H3N2) was associated with approximately half of the influenza-attributable excess mortality and excess hospitalization across different causes of disease. Influenza B had a greater contribution to the excess all-cause hospitalizations (177 per 100,000 persons per year) than that to excess cardiorespiratory hospitalizations (75 per 100,000 persons per year), while cardiorespiratory diseases accounted for majority of excess hospitalizations for different subtypes of influenza A viruses ( Table 2) .

Second, we estimated that there were very few excess respiratory deaths associated with influenza in children and younger adults, while excess hospitalization rates were low in older children and younger adults, precluding estimation of death to hospitalization ratios for these age groups. Third, in this study we only estimated an averaged influenza-associated impact across age groups although other risk factors such as underlying medical conditions, pregnancy or previous vaccination history might potentially modify the impact from influenza on the population. Finally, we examined excess respiratory deaths and respiratory hospitalizations, which may underestimate the full burden of influenza because of its impact on other diseases such as cardiovascular diseases 27, 28 or other diseases 5, 7 . Previous studies have often estimated that the impact of influenza virus epidemics on all-cause mortality is around double or triple the impact on respiratory mortality 5, 29, 30 .",
