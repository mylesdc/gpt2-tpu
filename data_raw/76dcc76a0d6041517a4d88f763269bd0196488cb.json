In central Kentucky in the United States, it has been shown that approximately 30 % of thoroughbred foals are infected with ECoV and thus it is considered widely prevalent. In contrast, the epidemiology of ECoV and its relationship to diarrhea in foals are poorly understood in Japan. We investigated ECoV in rectal swabs collected from thoroughbred foals in Japan.",

These results indicate that ECoV is prevalent among thoroughbred foals in central Kentucky. In Japan, ECoV outbreaks had previously occurred only in the draft racehorse population. Draft racehorses include French Percheron, Breton and Belgian horses, with body weights around 1000 kg. Outbreaks of ECoV had not been reported in the Japanese thoroughbred horse population, and its epidemiology is poorly understood.

Using 120 rectal swabs collected from healthy foals, only three samples (2.5 %) were positive for ECoV. Rectal swabs from healthy foals preserved at worse condition than that of diarrheic foals as described above. However, ECoV was only detected in rectal swabs from healthy foals, and therefore it is unclear whether storage condition influenced the result in this study. Compared with central Kentucky, ECoV is not prevalent among thoroughbred foals in Hidaka district of Hokkaido, but some outbreaks have occurred in draft racehorses. One reason for the lack of ECoV positive samples in thoroughbred foals may be that they do not usually have contact with draft horses. These results suggest that the prevalence of ECoV varies greatly depending on region. To further show this, it is necessary to investigate ECoV in other countries as well.",

The N gene of NC99 (AF251144), Obihiro2004 (AB671298), Tokachi09 (AB555559) and Obihiro12-1 (AB775893) were used to compare with that of Hidaka-No.61/2012 and Hidaka-No.119/2012. All 337 samples collected from diarrheic foals were negative for ECoV on RT-LAMP and real-time RT-PCR assays. Three samples collected from healthy foals aged 30-39 days at two farms were positive for ECoV on RT-LAMP and real-time RT-PCR assays. N gene amplification was attempted in the three positive samples and was successful in two of them (Hidaka-No.61/2012 collected at A farm in April 2012 and Hidaka-No.119/2012 collected at B farm in April 2012). Sequence analysis was performed for the N gene (1341 nucleotides and 446 amino acids) of Hidaka-No.61/2012 and Hidaka-No.119/2012. The nucleotide and amino acid sequence identities between the two samples analyzed in this study and in four other ECoVs (NC99",

Ultimately, Hidaka-No.61/2012-and Hidaka-No.119/2012-like viruses did not establish themselves in thoroughbred foals in Hidaka district of Hokkaido, because ECoV was not detected in any diarrheic samples in 2013 or 2014.",
