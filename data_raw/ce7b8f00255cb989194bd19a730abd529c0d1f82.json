However, a diagnostic microarray containing probes for all human pathogens could replace hundreds of individual PCR-reactions and remove the need for a clear clinical hypothesis regarding a suspected pathogen. We have established such a diagnostic platform for random amplification and subsequent microarray identification of viral pathogens in clinical samples. We show that Phi29 polymerase-amplification of a diverse set of clinical samples generates enough viral material for successful identification by the Microbial Detection Array, demonstrating the potential of the microarray technique for broad-spectrum pathogen detection. We conclude that this method detects both DNA and RNA virus, present in the same sample, as well as differentiates between different virus subtypes. We propose this assay for diagnostic analysis of viruses in clinical samples.",

Several microarray platforms have been developed for detection of all known viruses, as well as novel viruses related to known virus families [2, 3, 4] . Some of them have been tested on clinical samples, mostly respiratory samples [2, 3, 4, 5] . A microarray containing probes for all human pathogens could be used for diagnostic analysis, as well as for research purposes, environmental samples or epidemiological surveillance. Moreover, with some clinical syndromes or symptoms, it might be difficult to determine which viruses to test for in order to establish the correct diagnosis since many viruses can present similar symptoms. For this reason various multiplexed assays with virus panels, utilizing PCR or other methods, have been established. However, a microarray could be viewed as an extended pathogen panel, covering all viruses and bacteria, increasing the chance of the correct identification of one or several pathogens even in situations without any prior knowledge or suspicion about the etiology.",

            "text": "Without a pre-amplification of the clinical sample, such as PCR or virus culture, most microarrays are not sensitive enough for pathogen identification in clinical samples since virus titres normally are below their detection limit. For example, a diagnostic human Papilloma virus (HPV)-specific microarray utilizes an HPV-specific PCR-amplification prior to microarray hybridization [6, 7] . Different PCR-based random amplifications have been developed to achieve enough material for a successful identification [3, 4, 8] . However, studies have shown that PCR-based whole genome amplification (WGA) may generate incomplete coverage of genomes [9] . Instead we used multiple displacement amplification (MDA)-based WGA through isothermal amplification by the Phi29 polymerase [9] . The Phi29 polymerase has the highest processivity rate reported, ,70,000 bases every time it binds [10] and an error rate of only 1 in 10 6 -10 7 bases [11] , allowing for good coverage across genomes [9, 12, 13] . The average length produced is .10 kb compared to #3 kb by the Taq polymerase [9] . Phi29-amplification prior to microarray analysis has been used for human genomic DNA analysis [14, 15, 16] and for bacterial DNA analysis [17, 18] . However, the Phi29 polymerase cannot amplify RNA or short DNA fragments (,2000 bp), such as cDNA generated with random hexamers. To overcome this, the method Whole Transcriptome Amplification (WTA) has included a ligation step prior to amplification [2] resulting in cDNA fragments that are ligated into larger transcriptomes that can be efficiently amplified by the Phi29 polymerase.",

The microarray was designed for both detection and discovery, to both identify known organisms and to detect unsequenced or emerging organisms, while strain or subtype identification was not a goal. The array have both conserved and unique probes within each family, where oligos that were conserved, to the extent possible, within a family, and unique relative to other families and kingdoms, were prioritized [19] . Labelling and microarray hybridization was performed at NimbleGen Systems-Iceland, Iceland, or in-house at SSI, Denmark according to manufacturer's protocol (Gene expression analysis, Roche NimbleGen). Briefly, 1 mg of heat-denatured WTA-amplified sample was labelled using nick translation with Cy3-labeled random nonamer primers (TriLink Biotechnologies) and Klenow fragment (exo-) (NEB) at 37uC for 2 hours. Labelled DNA was iso-propanol precipitated and the pellet washed, dried, reconstituted and quantitated.

Additional stringency criteria were applied to exclude bacterial sequences and viruses having fewer than 20% of probes detected out of those expected. Briefly, probes were classified as detected if the intensity exceeded a threshold equal to the 99 th percentile of intensities for negative control probes, except that one sample was analysed using the 95 th percentile. Targets in an internal database of 43 705 viral sequences, developed at LLNL [19] , were screened against the stringency criteria; an unconditional log-odds score for presence of each remaining target was computed, and targets having log-odds scores less than 5 were excluded. A greedy forward selection algorithm was applied to find the collection of targets most likely to be present in the sample. At every forward selection step, a conditional log-odds score was computed for each remaining target, representing its potential contribution to the log-likelihood conditioned on the presence of the previously selected targets; the target having the largest conditional log-odds was selected and added to the collection. The resulting conditional and unconditional log-odds scores were plotted in a bar graph format [19] , where the conditional log-odds scores shows the contribution from a target that cannot be explained by another, more likely target above it, and the unconditional score illustrates that some very similar targets share a number of probes, so that multiple targets may be consistent with the hybridization signals.",

It has been demonstrated that filtration, DNase and RNase treatment can increase the efficiency of downstream amplifications [26, 27] . During DNase treatment the viral NA should be protected inside the viral particle [28] . After pre-treatment, the viral particles were lysed, viral NA purified and later Phi29-amplified using GenomiPhi V2 Amplification kit (GE Healthcare). During purification, the addition of carrier RNA did not improve the yield and interfered with the downstream Phi29-amplification, and was therefore left out (data not shown). Quantitative analysis of viral DNA or human gDNA before and after pre-treatment or Phi29-amplification was done by real-time PCR (Figure 1 and Table S1 ). Only centrifugation and filtration left large amounts of human gDNA still present in a HSV1 + sample (Ct = 22), while DNase treatment reduced the \u00dfactin signal 1000-fold (Ct = 32) ( Figure 1A) . The DNase treatment also had an effect on the HSV1, resulting in a 3-to 20-fold decrease in virus signal after DNase treatment (Table S1 ). However, this was accompanied by a much larger fold increase after Phi29-amplification compared to without DNase treatment (e.g. 88,292 compared to 1176), resulting in lower Ct-values and more viral DNA available for downstream analysis (Table S1 ). This was also seen for the RNA virus HCV (Table S1 ) as well as for other DNA and RNA viruses (data not shown). To investigate to what extent Phi29-amplification of remaining human gDNA would occur we performed a time-course experiment with the amplification-time extended up to 16 hours ( Figure 1B) . The \u00dfactin signal was still at acceptable background level (3000-fold increase in signal), while the HSV1 signal showed an 80,000-100,000-fold increase in signal. In conclusion, our pre-treatment removed a significant amount of human gDNA, which allowed for good virus amplification.",

The WTA RT-reaction and ligation step did not have any adverse effects when performed on a DNA-virus such as JCV from a CSF sample ( Figure 2B and Table 1 ), enabling us to run both viral DNA and RNA through the same amplification protocol prior to microarray hybridization. The WTA was used on 12 different DNA or RNA viruses found in 7 different types of clinical samples (Table 1 and Figure 2 ). The fold increase in PCR signal comparing before and after WTA, ranged from 330 to 564610 6 . The highest fold increase was detected for the circular viruses JCV, BKV and HPV (Table 1 and Figure 2B ). Such circular genomes have previously been shown to be efficiently amplified by Phi29 polymerase, through rolling circle amplification (RCA) [29, 30] . The lowest increase in signal was seen for Rota A found in faeces (Table 1 ) due to large quantities present already before amplification (Ct = 12), which resulted in a Ct-value of 7 after Table 1 ). The fold increase in PCR signal for gDNA (b-actin) was analysed in samples representing all 7 types of clinical samples, and showed no or low levels of b-actin amplification (Table S2) . WTA-amplified samples were purified and typical yield after 8 hours of WTA was ,25 mg (data not shown) showing good size distribution ( Figure 2C ).",

They were detected in samples containing DNA or RNA viruses, demonstrating that our pre-treatment and amplification protocol followed by microarray analysis can easily detect both types in one sample. Additional viruses were detected in 9 samples (Table 2 and data not shown), with log-odds scores ranging from 91.0 to 677.5. Some were clinically irrelevant since they were phages (Propionibacterium phage, Phage Gifsy-2, Lactococcus phage, Enterobacteria phage ST104, Mycobacteriophage and Pseudomonas phage) or plant viruses (Pepino mosaic virus), probably from digested or environmental sources (data not shown). Human endogenous retrovirus was detected in the Dengue 1 and the RSV sample ( Table 2 ). The rest of the additional viruses found (HPV103, Picobirnavirus, HAdV-C, GBV-C, JCV, Rota C and Dengue 2) were tested with virus-specific PCR for confirmation (Table 2 and data not shown). The HPV103 (cir dsDNA) detected in the HPV16 + sample is not present on the microarray used for routine HPV diagnosis (Genomica). Instead its presence was confirmed using a HPV103-specific PCR. The Rota A + faeces sample was found to be positive for Picobirnavirus (dsRNA) and negative for Rota C (dsRNA) by PCR. The Sapovirus + faeces sample was found to be positive for HAdV-C (linear dsDNA) in the microarray analysis, which was confirmed by PCR. Two separate microarray experiments detected GBV-C ((+)ssRNA) in the HCV + sample, which was confirmed by a GBV-C-specific PCR. The BKV + sample was detected as positive for JCV by microarray but tested negative by PCR.

Samples ranging from 15,810 to 4.0610 8 copies/ml of BKV were amplified by Phi29 polymerase for 16 hours using Repli-g Midi kit (Qiagen). Also included were three dilutions of a BKV urine sample, containing 892, 119 or 73 copies/ml, respectively. Samples containing $1000 copies/ml of BKV (BKV1-BKV5) were efficiently amplified with yields from 1.0610 11 to 1.9610 8 copies/ml of BKV (Table 3 and Figure 4A ), and with ,25 mg of DNA generated after amplification (data not shown). The total input of viral copies per 50 ml Phi29-reaction for BKV1-BKV5, were 2610 6 , 4100, 2100, 80 and 5 genomic copies, respectively ( Table 3 ). Amplification of samples containing ,100 copies/ml (BKV6 and BKV7) resulted in loss of reproducibility and low yields (Table 3 and Figure 4A ). The total input of viral copies per Phi29-reaction for these two samples were 0.6 and 0.4, respectively (Table 3) . Theoretically, amplification of samples containing 200 copies/ml means that ,1 viral copy is added to the Phi29-amplification reaction, resulting in stochastic problems due to unequal distribution in highly diluted solutions. Four amplifications were selected for microarray analysis (BKV3, BKV4, BKV5 and BKV6) and hybridized to the LLMDA (Table 3 and Figure 4B ), and analysed using the data analysis method developed at SSI. BKV + urine samples containing $1000 copies/ ml were clearly detected by the microarray analysis after Phi29amplification ( Figure 4B ). The human genomic sequence SSX3 (synovial sarcoma, X breakpoint 3) was used as a hybridization control and had the same signal intensity in all 4 microarrays. Some cross-hybridization with JCV was seen in the 3 samples where BKV was detected, even if they all were negative in a JCVspecific PCR (data not shown). This is similar to the BKV sample presented in table 2. From this we conclude that, from as little as 5 copies input ($1000 copies/ml) of BKV genomes the Phi29amplification was able to generate enough material for a clear detection by microarray analysis.",

The correct DNA or RNA virus was detected in 14 out of 14 samples, representing a diverse set of clinical materials. Moreover, we can correctly detect multiple subtypes of a virus present in a sample, as seen for two clinical samples positive for multiple HPV subtypes (6/16/53/61 and 16/103, respectively), with no cross-hybridization towards other subtypes. Furthermore, EV-A (Coxsackievirus A6) was clearly detected without any cross-hybridization towards any other of the 6 species with several serotypes included in the large Enterovirus genus (EV-B/C/D and Rhinovirus A/B/C). It should be noted that subtype identification was not a goal in the probe design when developing LLMDA, nevertheless, the ability to combine the signals from multiple probes in the analysis made it possible to discriminate between different subtypes [19] . In several samples analysed, more than one virus was found, in some cases including both DNA and RNA viruses. Taken together, this demonstrates the potential and real life utility of the microarray technique for broad-spectrum pathogen detection in clinical samples.",

They could all be explained by cross-reactivity between the probes targeting one species with other species in the same viral family. Future improvements to the current probe design can address crossreactivity issues such as these described. Regarding the failure to detect Sapovirus in the double-positive Astrovirus + /Sapovirus + faeces sample, we believe the reason was poor amplification due to low viral copy number rather than a specificity problem, since Sapovirus was detected in the Sapovirus + faeces sample ( Table 2) . Supporting this is the Sapovirus-specific PCR used before and after Phi29-amplification (Table 1) , which indicates that the singlepositive sample had more amplified Sapovirus (Ct = 11) after amplification, compared to the double-positive sample (Ct = 18) and thereby a sufficient amount for a successful detection by microarray analysis.",

Since it enables simultaneous detection of viruses as well as bacteria, it could be useful in e.g. diagnosis of sexually transmitted diseases, or of respiratory illnesses with combined viral and bacterial components. Furthermore, many viruses cause symptoms that clinically are very similar, making it hard to choose the correct diagnostic analysis. In cases of clinical hypothesis failure, the microarray could be a useful tool for finding an etiologic agent in samples that are presumed negative or in samples with unknown etiology. Microarray could also play a dual role combining diagnostics and research, by being a suitable research tool for finding new pathogens. It could also be of great value for epidemiological surveillance, where clinically unimportant viruses or viruses with unknown consequence for the carrier (e.g. TTV, retroviruses or others) could be found, described and followed in both human and animal populations.",

However, the protocol is at the moment to time and labour intensive to be used in a Figure 3 . Microarray analysis performed on WTA-amplified clinical samples. Results from the microarray data analysis of WTA-amplified clinical samples, using the maximum likelihood method developed at LLNL [19] , with additional stringency criteria applied. The lighter and darkercoloured portions of the bars represent the unconditional and conditional log-odds scores, respectively. The conditional log-odds scores shows the contribution from a target that cannot be explained by another, more likely target above it, while the unconditional score illustrates that some very similar targets share a number of probes. routine set up. We are currently focusing on reducing the overall assay time and the costs to develop a more suitable protocol for routine usage. Incubation times throughout the protocol might be shortened and some assays substituted or combined to make it both cheaper and faster to perform. Furthermore, the microarray design can be changed to multiplex, e.g. 12-plex as offered by the Roche NimbleGen system, instead of 1-plex as used now to increase the number of samples that can be run per slide. Future data analysis software needs to be customized for routine diagnostic analysis both regarding data handling and easy-to-use. The cost for the assay at the moment is in the hundreds of dollars per sample, but once established and refined as a technique, the cost is estimated to drop significantly but probably never to levels comparable to PCR. However, the benefit with this assay is that it replaces hundreds of PCR reactions with just one reaction, and often hospitals requests more than one PCR assay per patient in the search for a correct diagnose. Furthermore, since the microarray also contains probes for bacteria, it can combine both viral and bacterial diagnostics. Another benefit is that both DNA and RNA viruses can be analysed using the same protocol. In recent years WGA by MDA has been applied extensively, enabling researchers to get enough material from as little as a single cell for down-stream analysis [13, 32, 33] . Phi29 polymerase amplifies all accessible DNA present in a sample, including any exogenous DNA contamination. For viral or bacterial diagnostic purposes, where presence rather than abundance is important, the main concern is contaminating human gDNA that can compete with pathogen DNA. We show that our pre-treatment can reduce this impact from gDNA and thereby allowing for a greater amplification of the viral DNA. However, in some cases this is not enough due to large amounts of gDNA being present that can not be completely removed and this, combined with low viral copy number, might make certain types of clinical samples less suitable for efficient amplification and microarray analysis. This is currently under investigation. Our microarray analysis of BKV + urine samples indicated that as little as 5 genomic copies of a circular DNA genome could be enough to generate enough material by Phi29-amplification to enable successful identification by the LLMDA. Such a high sensitivity might not be achievable for other types of viral genomes, and is therefore under further investigation. Furthermore, to increase the chance of producing enough material from low copy number samples, we found that the WTA reaction should be allowed to run to completion (8 hours). The sample volume used for purification could also be increased.",
