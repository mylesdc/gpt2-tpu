However, members of this family recognize different cellular receptors and exploit different entry routes, what affects their species specificity and virulence. The aim of this study was to determine how human coronavirus OC43 enters the susceptible cell. Using confocal microscopy and molecular biology tools we visualized early events during infection. We found that the virus employs caveolin-1 dependent endocytosis for the entry and the scission of virus-containing vesicles from the cell surface is dynamin-dependent. Furthermore, the vesicle internalization process requires actin cytoskeleton rearrangements. With our research we strove to broaden the understanding of the infection process, which in future may be beneficial for the development of a potential therapeutics.",

The well-known human coronaviruses (HCoV) 229E and OC43 were described in 1960's and for almost 40 years were considered to be the only representatives of Coronaviridae infecting humans. Emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002, followed by identification of HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 revealed that these viruses are far more common and clinically relevant than previously expected. Further, emergence of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012 proved that these pathogens frequently cross the species border and may pose a significant healthcare risk.",

            "text": "The coronavirus entry to the cell is a complex process, which requires a series of cellular factors. First, the virus binds to the attachment receptor. This interaction results in an increased cell surface density of virus particles and (or) facilitates interaction with the fusion receptor. To make an example, HCoV-OC43 and bovine coronavirus bind to N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid 4 , HCoV-HKU1 binds to O-acetylated sialic acids 5 , while HCoV-NL63 and SARS-CoV bind to heparan sulfate proteoglycans 6,7 . In some cases this step seems to be redundant 8 , while in others depletion of the adhesion receptor results in lack of interaction between the virus and the cell and consequently severe decrease in virus infectivity 6, 9, 10 . Nonetheless, the presence of the adhesion factor is not sufficient to make the cell permissive. Coronaviruses utilize a broad variety of fusion receptors. Most of the alphacoronaviruses use aminopeptidase N (CD13) for cell entry, with the exception of HCoV-NL63, which similarly to SARS-CoV employs human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 11 . HCoV-OC43 was reported to utilize HLA class I molecule or sialic acids 12,13 , MERS-CoV -dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4 or CD26) 14 , whereas the receptor for HCoV-HKU1 remains unknown 5 . Recognition of different receptors implies not only different cellular tropism, but also different internalization routes. It is worth to mention, however, that recent reports also stress the importance of other cellular factors for virus tissue specificity, including tissue-specific proteases 15-18 .

The binding may induce fusion with cellular membranes, but in most of the cases this event is preceded by virus internalization via the endocytic route. The most common, and the best described route is clathrin-dependent endocytosis. This path is used by representatives of wide range of viral families (e.g., human enterovirus 71 19 , human metapneumovirus 20 , rabies virus 21 and others). Upon receptor recognition, a viral particle is docked into a clathrin-coated pit. Its' formation is initialized by concerted action of a protein complex that consists of FCHo1/2, Eps15 and intersectin-1. FCHo1/2 induces curvature of the plasma membrane and through Eps15 recruits Adaptor Protein 2 (AP2) to the nucleation site 22 . AP2 assembles clathrin units and once their concentration reaches a critical level, they polymerize to form a lattice on the membrane 23 . The structure deepens, stabilized by the cargo 24 . Budding of the vesicle is accompanied by a tubular neck formation, to which amphiphysin protein is attracted. It recruits dynamin, which polymerizes in a GTP dependent mode to finally cut off the cargo-containing vesicle from the cell surface 25,26 .",

As shown in Fig. 1 , addition of NH 4 Cl early during the infection resulted in reduction of the number of virus-positive cells.

In order to validate this observation, cholera toxin B (CTB) conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) was used as a positive control for caveolin-1 dependent entry 31, 32 (Fig. 3F-I) . Disruption of caveolae hampers HCoV-OC43 entry. In order to ensure that HCoV-OC43 enters the cell using caveolae, specific inhibitors of this endosomal pathway were used. Caveolae are formed in membrane clusters, where caveolin-1 is accompanied by cholesterol and sphingolipids. Consequently, the caveolin-mediated entry is sensitive to cholesterol-binding or depleting agents such as nystatin or methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (M\u03b2CD). HCT-8 cells were pre-incubated with the compounds and overlaid with the virus. Following the incubation, cells were fixed, permeabilized and immunostained for HCoV-OC43 and actin, and virus entry was evaluated using confocal microscopy. As shown in Fig. 4 , incubation with M\u03b2CD and nystatin (Fig. 4B ,C) resulted in significant retention of virus on the cell surface, further proving that caveolae are required for virus internalization. Cholera toxin was used as a reference (Fig. 4F ,G), as it was previously reported to enter the cell via caveosomes 31, 32 . The M\u03b2CD-mediated inhibition of HCoV-OC43 entry ( Fig. 4B ) was more effective than CTB (Fig. 4F ). To ensure that the observed effect is specific, we silenced expression of caveolin-1 in HCT-8 cells using siRNAs delivered in two consecutive transfections. Scrambled siRNAs were used as controls. Twenty-four hours after the second transfection, cells were incubated with HCoV-OC43 for 1 h. Subsequently, cells were fixed, permeabilized and immunostained to visualize the virus. In the cells transfected with caveolin-1 specific siRNAs protein levels were reduced by almost 80%, as assessed by Western blot, while scrambled siRNAs didn't influence the protein level. \u03b2-tubulin was used as a reference household gene ( Fig. 5A ; the original image of the membrane is provided in Supplementary Fig. 1 ). Virus internalization to cells depleted of caveolin-1 was evaluated by confocal microscopy. As shown in Fig. 5 , viral particles were retained on the cell surface in cells depleted of caveolin-1 (Fig. 5C) , while no such effect was observed in control cells (Fig. 5B ,D,E).",

To determine whether HCoV-OC43 entry process is dynamin-mediated, two different dynamin inhibitors were used: MiTMAB, which interacts with the lipid binding (PH) domain of dynamin and dynasore that non-competitively inhibits GTPase activity of dynamin 33 . Obtained results show that dynamin activity is required for effective HCoV-OC43 entry to the target cell (Fig. 7) . HCoV-OC43 requires actin for successful entry. In order to study the role of cytoskeleton during virus entry, we used two compounds known to affect actin cytoskeleton. Briefly, HCT-8 cells were pre-treated with jasplakinolide or cytochalasin D, inoculated with HCoV-OC43 or dextran and further incubated in conditions allowing for intracellular transport (32 \u00b0C) . Subsequently, cultures were fixed, permeabilized and stained with specific antibodies to visualize virus particles and actin cytoskeleton. Confocal imaging revealed that stabilization of actin cortex by jasplakinolide results in inhibition of HCoV-OC43 virus entry and dextran internalization . This may suggest that actin is important for vesicle formation, and the virus enters the cell by macropinocytosis. However, analysis of cells pre-treated with cytochalasin D revealed that depolymerization of actin filaments did not inhibit virus entry, but drastically modulated virus localization (Fig. 8B ). Virus particle localized to non-structured actin deposits in the cell's cytoplasm. On the other hand, dextran internalization was hampered (Fig. 8F ). Both inhibitors drastically limited virus infection rate, as shown by flow cytometry (Fig. 9) . No inhibition of virus entry or infection was observed for wortmannin, PI3K inhibitor known to hamper macropinocytosis ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ).",

As shown in Supplementary Fig. 4 , strong co-localization of HCoV-OC43 with dextran was observed 5-210 min p.i. At the same time we observed vast decrease in HCoV-OC43 co-localization with EEA1 (early endosome's marker), what suggested that in the presence of dextran the virus is internalized by a different pathway. This triggered another question, whether the dextran-induced micropinocytosis may initiate productive infection. To address this question, cells were infected with HCoV-OC43 in the presence of dextran and nystatin or MiTMAB or NH 4 Cl. Infection was carried on for 3 days and its course was monitored with flow cytometry. Obtained results (Fig. 10 ) clearly show that although the virus effectively enters the cell by macropinocytosis, it is not able to reach the replication site and to start productive infection. Inhibition of caveolin-dependent endocytosis in the presence of dextran did not block virus nor dextran internalization, but it blocked virus replication.",

Consequently, viruses sensitive to inhibitors preventing pH decrease are believed to require endocytosis for entry. We showed that bafilomycin A1 and ammonium chloride strongly inhibit virus replication (Fig. 1) . One may, however, question whether during prolonged incubation only virus entry is affected. To ensure validity of our observation, subcellular localization of viruses entering the cell was tested and its co-localization with endosomal markers was verified.

For that, we tested whether virus co-localizes with common endocytic markers. Performed research revealed that interaction between the virus and the cell triggers recruitment of caveolin-1 and subsequent caveolae assembly (Fig. 3) . Assembly of these structures depends on membrane content and flexibility, and we investigated the influence of compounds modifying cholesterol content/availability on HCoV-OC43 entry. Consistently, nystatin or M\u03b2CD pretreatment caused retention of the virus on the cell surface (Fig. 4) . Both inhibitors blocked HCoV-OC43 infection, proving the relevance of this pathway for virus replication (Fig. 6) . It is, however, known that chemical inhibitors may show non-specific effects [41] [42] [43] . In order to ensure that observed effect is not an artifact, caveolin-1 was depleted in HCT-8 cells using RNAi technology (Fig. 5) . All experiments consistently showed that HCoV-OC43 entry is caveolin-1 dependent.",

Subsequent examination revealed that in the presence of dextrans, which are also known inducers of macropinocytosis, the virus is switching the internalization route to macropinocytosis ( Supplementary Fig. 4 ). It seems, however, that virus internalization by this route does not allow for effective entry and replication (Fig. 10) . One may hypothesize that during micropinocytosis the pH in the vesicle is not decreased and the virus -cell fusion does not occur. In such a scenario, viruses are recycled to the cell surface or degraded intracellularly.

Unfortunately, the HAE culture does not support replication of the strain replicating in vitro and therefore it was not possible to compare these two models.

Afterwards, samples were blocked overnight at 4 \u00b0C in 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with primary anti-HCoV-OC43 antibodies (MAB9012, Merck) diluted 1:1000 in 3% BSA in PBS. Subsequently, samples were incubated for 1 h with Alexa Fluor 488 labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (Thermo Fisher Scientific) diluted 1:400 in 3% BSA in PBS. To visualize host cell proteins, the cells were blocked again overnight at 4 \u00b0C with 10% FBS in PBS, incubated for 2 h at room temperature with primary antibodies (Caveolin-1 N-20 Antibody, sc-894, Santa Cruz Biotechnology; Clathrin HC Antibody (C-20), sc-6579, Santa Cruz Biotechnology; EEA1 H-300 Antibody, sc-33585, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) diluted 1:100 in 2.5% FBS in PBS, and finally with Atto 633 labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or Alexa Fluor 546 goat anti-rabbit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) diluted 1:200 in 2.5% FBS in PBS. In experiments showing localization of virions in the cell actin cytoskeleton was visualized. Briefly, after HCoV-OC43 labelling, cells were stained with Atto 633-phalloidin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) diluted 1:50 in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Nuclei were stained with DAPI (Thermo Fisher Scientific) diluted 1:10 000 in PBS.After immunostaining in all the cases cells were washed with 0.5% TWEEN-20 in PBS. Finally, stained cultures were mounted on glass slides in ProLong Diamond antifade medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and stored at 4 \u00b0C.",
