            "text": "The peer-reviewed journal Infectious Diseases of Poverty provides a new platform to engage with, and disseminate in an open-access format, science outside traditional disciplinary boundaries. The current piece reviews a thematic series on surveillance-response systems for elimination of tropical diseases. Overall, 22 contributions covering a broad array of diseases are featuredi.e. clonorchiasis, dengue, hepatitis, human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS), H7N9 avian influenza, lymphatic filariasis, malaria, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), rabies, schistosomiasis and tuberculosis (TB). There are five scoping reviews, a commentary, a letter to the editor, an opinion piece and an editorial pertaining to the theme \"Elimination of tropical disease through surveillance and response\". The remaining 13 articles are original contributions mainly covering (i) drug resistance; (ii) innovation and validation in the field of mathematical modelling; (iii) elimination of infectious diseases; and (iv) social media reports on disease outbreak notifications released by national health authorities. Analysis of the authors' affiliations reveals that scientists from the People's Republic of China (P.R. China) are prominently represented. Possible explanations include the fact that the 2012 and 2014 international conferences pertaining to surveillance-response mechanisms were both hosted by the National Institute of Parasitic Diseases (NIPD) in Shanghai, coupled with P.R. China's growing importance with regard to the control of infectious diseases. Within 4 to 22 months of publication, three of the 22 contributions were viewed more than 10 000 times each. With sustained efforts focusing on relevant and strategic information towards control and elimination of infectious diseases, Infectious Diseases of Poverty has become a leading journal in the field of surveillance and response systems in infectious diseases and beyond.",

The journal was launched in October 2012 to explore new avenues in research to deepen the understanding of the relationship between infectious diseases and poverty, to contribute to priority-setting and translation of key findings into policies and programmes to control and eliminate these diseases. The expanded \"One World -One Health\" concept, first proposed by the Wildlife Conservation Society and supported by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), WHO, the World Bank and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), recognises that the health of people, animals, and societies is intimately linked, and ultimately dependent, on the resilience of the world's life-supporting ecosystems [6] . Based on this concept, Infectious Diseases of Poverty has published a series of original articles and empirical work with reference to analyses of disease burdens, their distributions and the research that is needed in this area. To raise global awareness of infectious diseases of poverty, the journal has not only published original research articles but also scoping reviews that highlight transdisciplinary advances in the science undertaken. Several collections in different areas and on various topics have been published [3, 7] .",

To emphasise the objectives of this thematic issue based on a \"One World -One Health\" paradigm, an editorial summarises the outcomes of the First Forum on Surveillance Response Systems Leading to Tropical Diseases Elimination, held in Shanghai in June 2012, including identified research priorities [3, 8, 32] .",

Work stemming from Nigeria assessed household payments for TB with regard to incidence, determinants and policy implications for universal health coverage. The results suggest that current health costlowering strategies in Nigeria are not sufficient to prevent households from incurring catastrophic out-ofpocket payments for TB care [23] . To assess resources for the use of community-directed interventions (CDI), another study from Nigeria investigated delivery of health interventions in poorly-served urban communities in Ibadan. The research support the feasibility of using the CDI process in delivering health interventions in urban, poor environments and shows that resources for the strategy were potentially abound in the communities.",
