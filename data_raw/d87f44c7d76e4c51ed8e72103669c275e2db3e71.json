            "text": "The major physiological function of milk is the transport of amino acids, carbohydrates, lipids and minerals to mammalian offspring. Caseins, the major milk proteins, are secreted in the form of a micelle consisting of protein and calciumphosphate. We have analysed the role of the milk protein a-casein by inactivating the corresponding gene in mice. Absence of a-casein protein significantly curtails secretion of other milk proteins and calcium-phosphate, suggesting a role for a-casein in the establishment of casein micelles. In contrast, secretion of albumin, which is not synthesized in the mammary epithelium, into milk is not reduced. The absence of a-casein also significantly inhibits transcription of the other casein genes. a-Casein deficiency severely delays pup growth during lactation and results in a life-long body size reduction compared to control animals, but has only transient effects on physical and behavioural development of the pups. The data support a critical role for a-casein in casein micelle assembly. The results also confirm lactation as a critical window of metabolic programming and suggest milk protein concentration as a decisive factor in determining adult body weight.",

            "text": "Milk is a hallmark of mammals, providing the primary source of nutrition for their young until weaning. It is an emulsion of fat globules in a water-based fluid. The major proteins of this fluid are the caseins. The caseins are serine rich phosphoproteins which are almost exclusively expressed in the lactating mammary gland [1, 2] . In cows the casein proteins together constitute up to 80% of total milk protein and also 80% of total mRNA in the lactating mammary gland [3] . The caseins are members of a large family of serine rich phospho-proteins, which are clustered on chromosome 5 in the mouse (chromosome 6 in cattle, chromosome 4 in humans). There are 5 functional casein genes in the mouse whereas most other species (including ruminants) only express 3 or 4 functional genes [1] . The casein proteins show little homology with each other outside their signal peptide domain [2, 4] .",

            "text": "Inactivation of the b-casein gene has shown to have little effect on milk secretion and growth of the offspring in the mouse [5] . In contrast, deletion of the k-casein gene in mice completely abrogates milk production [6] . Exactly why this happens is unclear as neither the structure of the individual casein proteins nor the structure of the casein micelles is currently known in detail [7, 8, 9] . The available results, however, support a model in which k-casein (the casein protein which is present in milk in least abundance) plays a critical role in ensuring transport and solubility of casein micelles [7] . The sequences of a-(aS1 in ruminants) b-, and ccasein (aS2-casein in ruminants) contain one or more clusters of phosphorylated residues known as phosphate centres. Phosphate centres can sequester amorphous calcium phosphate, probably in the Golgi vesicles of mammary secretory cells, to form thermodynamically stable complexes of defined chemical composition which are then secreted through the apical membrane of the mammary epithelial cells [10, 11, 12, 13, 14] . Milk, like many other biological fluids, is supersaturated with respect to the crystalline mineral of bones and teeth (apatite) but due to the sequestration reaction, is under-saturated with respect to amorphous calcium phosphate. Since apatite only forms by maturation of the amorphous phase of calcium phosphate, it cannot form at all from milk and this helps to protect the mammary gland against soft tissue mineralization [15] . In most milks, the majority of the total calcium is sequestered within the casein micelles. In milks of different species, the total calcium and total casein concentrations are highly correlated [16] and provided this balance is maintained, the milks remain stable. If there is insufficient casein to sequester the secreted calcium and orthophosphate then the milk becomes unstable [15] . In mouse milk, 3 of the phosphate centres are in present a-casein and only one in b-casein. Thus the loss of a-casein is likely to have more serious consequences for milk stability than the loss of b-casein.",

The assay provides a pro-luminescent caspase-3/7 substrate, which contains the amino acid sequence DEVD in a reagent optimised for caspase activity, luciferase activity and cell lysis. Presence of caspase 3 or 7 in the cell extract leads to cleavage of the substrate and light emission which is detected in a luminometer (Berthold).

The spline allows the growth rate to change after the day 23 for each treatment. This way we are able to test differences of the growth rate between treatments before and after weaning.

The targeting event removes the complete second exon which includes the translational start codon and the 15 amino acid signal peptide (Fig. 1b) . In 3 independent transfections into ES cells the targeting frequency was found to be around 3%. Successfully modified ES cells clones were identified using a PCR analysing the 59 end of the targeted gene (Fig. 1c) . The targeting event was then confirmed by Southern blot analysis assessing the 59 end of the targeted a-casein gene (Fig. 1d) . The integration event was also confirmed using PCR analysis and Southern blotting with primer combinations and probes specific for the 39 end (Fig. 1e) . Two targeted cell clones were grown up and injected into blastocysts. Animals carrying a homozygous deletion of the a-casein gene are phenotypically normal prior to lactation. Fig. 2a alongside a wild-type control milk sample. Milk from control animals displayed a series of protein bands, with the most prominent proteins corresponding to molecular weights previously observed for a-, band c-casein (with apparent molecular weights of 42, 30 and 25 kDa, respectively) [28] . The identity of the protein bands was confirmed using mass-spectrometry. Table 4 details the data for the 8 most prominent protein bands indicated in Fig. 2c . These findings were also supported using Western blot analyses for a-casein and b-casein ( Fig. 3a and 3b ). Milk from acasein deficient mice shows some characteristic protein bands which are absent from milk of wild-type or heterozygous mice (Fig. 2d) . Mass-spectrometry analysis was used to identify some of these proteins. The major additional band with an apparent molecular weight of 78 kDa was identified as grp78/BiP. BiP is an ER resident protein which is involved in the assembly of multi-protein complexes like antibodies [29, 30] . The identity of the grp78/BiP protein was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3c) . In addition two further ER-resident proteins, grp94 and PDIA6 (protein disulfide-isomerase associated protein 6), were detected in milk of the a-casein deficient mice (Fig. 2d, table 4) .",

In heterozygous mice the amount of a-casein protein is reduced by around 50% when compared to albumin (Fig. 3e) . In contrast, the relative amounts of b-casein and c-casein compared to albumin remain constant. In the milk derived from homozygous a-casein deficient mice, no acasein protein can be detected (Fig. 2a, 3a and 3d ). In addition, the amounts of band c-casein are also significantly reduced (Fig. 2a,  3d and e) . Whereas the ratio of b-casein to albumin in control milk is 2:1, the ratio in milk from homozygous a-casein deficient mice is 1:1 indicating at least a 50% reduction in b-casein protein concentration in milk (Fig. 3d and e) . This reduction is also detected by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3b ) Analysis of the data using one-way ANOVA demonstrated that the changes in the concentration of band c-casein in the milk of a-casein deficient mice are highly significant (p.0.001; Table 5 ). The concentration of milk proteins (Fig. 3d) is consistent with published data [5] .",

In total protein extracts derived from mammary tissue it is evident that grp78/BiP and grp94 expression is indeed up-regulated in response to the absence of a-casein.

This suggests that the lack of a-casein protein in mammary epithelial cells induces ER stress. Analysis of gene expression rates of grp78, grp94 and PDIA6 confirms that all three genes are significantly up-regulated in tissue samples of a-casein deficient mice with respect to control mice and heterozygous mice (Fig. 4d) . In contrast, another protein often upregulated under conditions of ER stress, REDD1 [34] is not significantly regulated by the absence of a-casein (Fig. 4d) , Several other protein bands with apparent molecular weights of 28, 27 and 22 kDa were identified in milk from a-casein deficient mice (Fig. 2d) . Mass-spectrometry analysis confirmed that these proteins are breakdown products of band c-casein (Table 4 ). The lower molecular weight b-casein products are also detected by Western blot analysis of milk samples derived from a-casein deficient mice (Fig. 3b) . Analysis of protein extracts from mammary gland tissue suggests that the breakdown products are the predominant intracellular forms of b and c-casein ( Fig. 4a and  b) but are not secreted as efficiently as the full length protein. The caseins are important for ion transport, mainly calcium and phosphate [35, 36] . Not surprisingly we therefore find that the lower casein protein levels in a-casein deficient mice are accompanied by a significantly lower concentration of calcium and phosphate in milk (reduced by around 90% compared to milk derived from wild-type animals; Fig. 5a ).",

Expression of the casein genes was correlated with expression of the reference genes GAPDH (shown in Fig. 5b and c) and b-actin (Fig. 5d) . Identical results were obtained for both reference genes. As expected the amount of a-casein specific mRNA in heterozygous mice is at 50% of control levels and absent in homozygous knock-out mice. Expression of the corresponding b-casein and c-casein casein genes is significantly reduced in acasein deficient mice (to around 10% of the expression levels detected in wild-type and heterozygous mice; Fig. 5b, c and d) . This suggests that the absence of the a-casein protein not only interferes with protein secretion from the mammary epithelial cells but that absence of both alleles of the a-casein gene also reduces the expression of the other casein genes. The expression of the kcasein gene is also affected but not to the same extent. Its expression is reduced to around 20% of control levels in a-casein deficient mice (Fig. 5c and d) . No consistent reduction of b-casein, c-casein and k-casein expression is detected in the heterozygous animals. Fig. 5d presents the expression of the casein genes as percentages of wild-type expression. The consistent reduction of b-, cand k-casein gene expression in the a-casein deficient mammary tissue is highly significant (p,0.001; table 6) whereas expression changes in heterozygous vs wild-type mice are marginally or not significant (all p values.0.01; table 6).

            "text": "In order to assess whether the reduction in protein and RNA expression is correlated with overall morphological changes, sections of mammary tissue were obtained from animals at peak lactation and analysed by haematoxylin/eosin (H&E) staining and immuno-histochemistry (Fig. 6 ). As expected a-casein expression was clearly detectable in tissue from wild-type control mice and heterozygous mice (Fig. 6a) . In contrast no a-casein protein could be detected in sections of a-casein deficient mice (Fig. 6a) . As expected sections analysed with pre-immune serum did not show any a-casein specific staining (Fig. 6a) . No gross morphological alterations were detected in the sections of the different genotypes (Fig. 6b) . This suggests that the absence of a-casein, although critical for overall milk composition, does not significantly impact on the survival of the mammary gland. To address this question further we measured the expression and activity of capase proteins in the mammary gland. Firstly we assessed the presence of cleaved caspase 3 in the protein extracts derived from control mice, heterozygous mice and a-casein deficient mice. No cleaved caspase 3 could be detected (Fig. 7a) . In contrast cleaved caspase 3 protein with the expected molecular weight of 19 kDa was readily detected in the extracts of RAW264 cells treated with 10 mM staurosporin (Fig. 7a) . Similarly, no specific signals for cleaved caspase 3 could be detected in immuno-histochemical analyses of tissue sections. In addition, caspase 3 and caspase 7 activities was measured in cytoplasmic protein extracts derived from mammary tissue of control, heterozygous and a-casein deficient mice. No significant differences in caspase 3 and 7 were detected (Fig. 7b) . In contrast a significant increase in caspase activity could be detected in RAW cells treated with 10 mM staurosporin (Fig. 7b) . cDNAs derived from representative samples of control and acasein deficient mice were analysed for characteristic gene expression changes related to apoptosis. Potential changes in candidate genes were assessed using a PCR array containing 84 apoptosis related genes. The expression of 16 genes was changed significantly (11 down-regulated and 5 up-regulated in a-casein deficient mice vs. control). Five genes, which were changed by more than 7 fold (1 down-regulated and 4 up-regulated), were further analysed in cDNAs derived from 3 control, 5 heterozygous and 5 a-casein deficient animals (Fig. 7c) . Only 3 genes showed consistent and significant expression differences between control and a-casein deficient animals. Expression of the anti-apoptotic genes survivin (baculoviral inhibitor of apoptosis repeat-contain- ing-5; Birc5) and nucleolar protein 3 (Nol3/ARC: nuclear apoptosis repressor with caspase recruitment domain) was increased by 22 and 2.5 fold respectively. In contrast expression of another anti-apoptotic gene, TNF receptor-associated factor 1 (Traf1), was reduced to 5% of control levels in a-casein deficient mice.",

This effect was seen when acasein deficient dams nursed their own pups and if the offspring of wild-type mice was nursed by deficient dams. This demonstrates that the effect is mediated by the genotype of the nursing female. This effect was also seen in two further litters after breeding of the a-casein deficient mice onto a CD1 background (Kolb et al., unpublished) . All females were able to nurse their pups, as indicated by the presence of milk in the stomach ('milk spot') in all groups of pups (Table 3) . However, by day 6, pups nursed by acasein deficient dams were visibly emaciated (Fig. 8a) in comparison with pups nursed by control dams (Fig. 8b) . By midlactation offspring nursed by a-casein deficient mice are significantly smaller than offspring nursed by control dams (Fig. 8c) . Pre-weaning mortality was low in all groups and unaffected by dam genotype. Weighing of individual pups throughout lactation demonstrates that offspring nursed by acasein deficient dams only reach a weight of around 3 g by the end of lactation, whereas pups nursed by control dams weigh around 12 g (Fig. 8d and Fig. 9a ). After weaning mice were maintained on a standard chow diet ad libitum. Offspring nursed by a-casein deficient dams display a significantly accelerated growth with respect to the control group between weaning and day 50 of life ( Fig. 9b and 10) . However, this brief growth spurt is insufficient to bring the weight of pups nursed by a-casein deficient dams up to the weight of control animals in the long term (Fig. 9c) . The difference in weight is displayed in both sexes (Fig. 9d) .",

Pre-weaning observations indicated physical impairment in the 'small' mice. Measures of maturation (e.g. eye opening; tables 3 and 7) occur with a slight delay with respect to control animals. 60% and 50% of the pups nursed by wild-type dams had both eyes opened on day 14, all of the pups nursed by acasein deficient females still had their eyes closed at that age, opening them only around 3 days later (Table 7) . Physical abilities which rely on physical strength and coordination when tested on day 21 are significantly less developed in pups reared by a-casein deficient dams (Table 8 ). Significantly fewer of the growth impaired animals (36%, P-value,0.001 Fisher's exact test) were able to hold on to the pole in the vertical pole test, whereas none of the pups nursed by wild-type dams fell off before the pole reached a vertical position. Some animals nursed by a-casein deficient dams presented a rough condition of the fur (84%, P-value,0.001 Fisher's exact test) whereas all control animals had normal fur condition. Grip strength in growth impaired pups was significantly lower (P = 0.001), as 36% of the animals could not hold on to the cage lid for 15 seconds when it was turned upside down, compared to 3% and 0% in the two control groups. Animals nursed by knockout females defecated less during handling and scoring on day 21 (P-value,0.001, Mann Whitney U). Also significantly fewer (76%, P = 0.004) pups nursed by a-casein deficient females showed a provoked biting response at day 21 when compared to pups nursed by wild-type dams (100%). In summary, at preweaning the a-casein deficient milk suckled pups were smaller and physically weaker than those reared on wild-type milk.",

This suggests that in offspring nursed by a-casein deficient mice, general development of pups is less impaired than what would be expected from their significant growth retardation which has persisted throughout their life so far (currently the mice are almost 2 years old).",

            "text": "The role of caseins in milk protein secretion Deficiency for a-casein severely impairs milk protein secretion in mice. In contrast b-casein deficiency does not result in a similar decline [5] . This suggests that, in contrast to b-casein, a-casein plays a more critical role in the establishment of a functional casein micelle thereby affecting secretion of all casein proteins. Alternatively or additionally due to the higher number of phosphate centres present in a-casein vs. b-casein (3 vs. 1), deficiency for a-casein (but not for b-casein) may decrease the stability of the biofluid resulting in a precipitation of calciumphosphate in the Golgi vesicles. These results argue against a functional redundancy of the calcium-sensitive caseins (a-, b-, cand d-casein). Whereas overall secretion of milk proteins is not adversely affected in heterozygous mice (apart from a 50% reduction in a-casein protein secretion), milk protein secretion from mammary epithelial cells is severely curtailed in homozygous a-casein deficient mice. This affects both, caseins and whey proteins like WAP. In contrast, secretion of albumin which is not secreted by the mammary epithelial cells is not affected by the absence of a-casein. These results suggest a functional role for acasein in casein micelle formation and/or stabilisation (similar to that of k-casein) [6] . We find that the glucose regulated protein 78 (grp78 or BiP) is significantly up-regulated in response to the absence of a-casein. Grp78/BiP is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)resident protein whose expression is enhanced under conditions of ER stress [29] [31, 33] . Surprisingly the protein is also found in milk of a-casein deficient dams. This suggests that grp78/BiP may be critically involved in the assembly of the casein micelle. One can speculate that grp78/BiP is associated with the maturing casein micelle and is co-secreted with the immature micelle into milk. Two further ER resident proteins, grp94 and PDIA6 are also secreted into milk of a-casein deficient animals indicating that the lack of a-casein has significant impacts on protein processing and transport in the mammary epithelium. Interestingly, secretion of grp78/BiP and grp94 is also observed in mice over-expressing human protein C [37, 38] . This may suggest that perturbation of the balance of milk proteins invokes a common ER stress response resulting in the co-secretion of ER resident proteins into milk. Despite the clear evidence for changes to the expression and localisation of ER resident proteins there is no clear evidence for significant increases in mammary apoptosis in the absence of acasein. Firstly, lactation is not terminated prematurely in the deficient animals suggesting that at least a significant portion of the mammary epithelial cells is viable. Under physiological conditions mammary gland involution after weaning leads to a complete cessation of milk secretion, apoptosis and regression of the epithelial tissue [39, 40] . In homozygous protein C transgenic mice no successful lactation is established, suggesting that in that case ER stress is followed by loss of mammary epithelium function [38] . Secondly, we cannot detect any gross morphological alteration of the secretory mammary epithelium in a-casein deficient mice. Thirdly, we also failed to detect increases in caspase activity in a-casein deficient mammary tissue. Finally, the apoptosis related genes which showed consistent and significant increases in mRNA expression in mammary tissue of a-casein deficient mice include the anti-apoptotic genes survivin (Birc5) and ARC/Nol3, suggesting that the mammary cells are actively avoiding apoptosis. On the other hand a reduction in the expression of the Traf1 gene, encoding an anti-apoptotic gene in the context of the mammary gland [41] suggests a balance of proapoptotic and anti-apoptotic responses to a-casein deficiency. Taken together these findings may suggest that the ER-stress response in mammary epithelial cells of a-casein deficient mice is sufficient to rescue protein secretion, thereby preventing large scale apoptosis and loss of tissue function. Interestingly, we find that steady state levels of mRNAs encoding b-casein, c-casein and k-casein are also severely reduced in the mammary gland of a-casein deficient mice (cf. Fig. 5d ). In contrast no such reduction is observed in heterozygous mice. There could be (at least) two explanations for this. The deletion of cis-acting DNA elements in the a-casein gene may affect the expression of the entire casein gene locus. This genetic explanation would imply that the presence of one functional a-casein allele is sufficient to mediate the activation of both copies of the casein gene locus. Alternatively there may be physiological explanations. ER stress has been associated with an attenuation of protein synthesis [33] . One can speculate that in the mammary gland this leads to a decrease in the transcription of milk protein genes which account for most of the transcripts during lactation to prevent overloading of a compromised endoplasmic reticulum [33] . A decrease in the abundance of milk protein gene specific mRNAs was also observed in the transgenic mice over expressing human protein C [38] . Alternatively, the viability of the secretory mammary epithelial cells may be impaired to some degree by the ER stress response, leading to a lower relative number of casein producing cells in the mammary gland.",

The experiments described in this paper have been carried out with 3 litters of each genotype on a C57BL/6 background. However we have observed the same phenotype of reduced weight gain during lactation with two more litters on a CD1 background (Kolb et al., unpublished data) , suggesting that the phenotype is similar in different genetic backgrounds.

Variations in litter size lead to differences in adult body weight, although generally the effects in mice are less drastic (around 10% in adulthood) than those observed in offspring nursed by a-casein deficient dams. Alternatively, milk protein concentration can be manipulated by changing the protein content of diet of the nursing dams [45] . Specific alterations in milk composition have been more difficult to achieve technically and have relied on rearing rodent pups by gastrostomal nutrition away from their mothers [52] . However, this results in a radically different early environment as these pups are not exposed to the normal maternal behaviour [53] . Therefore the effect of specific protein restrictions during lactation has not been addressed in detail.",

But the growth hormone/IGF axis and programming of appetite control have been implicated as key mediators. Attenuated growth rates in early post-natal life provide a significant protection against metabolic disease and extend health-and lifespan [45, 51, 54, 55, 56] . Many genetic mutations of the growth hormone/IGF axis result in both, small body size and an increased life-and health-span. Increased lifespan and increased resistance to metabolic disease is also observed in mice nursed by dams on a low protein diet [45] . This suggests that permanent changes in body size induced by altered protein supply during lactation are accompanied by an improvement in metabolic health. In humans formula feeding has been associated with both, a more rapid increase in body weight during lactation [57] and an increased susceptibility to metabolic disorders [46, 58, 59] .",
