[5] [6] [7] Early outbreak reporting informs expectations in morbidity, mortality and guides health systems' response, to specific outbreaks. [5, 6] This reporting is instrumental for public health risk assessments. [8] However, detection bias towards identification and inclusion of the sickest patients and selection bias (of specific sub-groups of patients) are substantial threats to the internal validity and generalizability for early outbreak studies. [9] [10] [11] As well, there may be unique geographic or socioeconomic characteristics of the first affected regions that influence patient outcomes.

[2, 12] However, influenza A (H1N1) comprised the majority of global seasonal influenza-related illness again in 2013-2014. [13] With this in mind, we performed a systematic review of all studies describing critically ill patients in the 2009-2010 Influenza A (H1N1) outbreak in order to better understand how patient, temporal, healthcare system and study-specific factors influence reporting of clinical outcomes and to attempt to provide unbiased and valid estimates of mortality. We deliberately did not focus upon all patients with H1N1 as there is no globally valid denominator to describe these patients over different geographic regions. Thus using a standardized definition of critical illness we included such patients across different geographic regions and time periods. Moreover, a focus on critically ill patients is clinically relevant as they are most likely to have poor outcomes and therefore represent an important group to target for early prediction and care.",

We explored clinical heterogeneity by establishing subgroups of studies according to distinct patient populations and determined statistical heterogeneity among studies by using the Q statistic and I 2 index. [18] We used a random effects model to obtain summary outcome point estimates and 95% confidence intervals. [19] We conducted random effects meta-regression analyses for mortality for different variables extracted from the studies, including specific pandemic time periods (first wave, second wave, prolonged enrollment), geographical region (country, region, continent, World Bank economic development status), study population characteristics (unselected vs. selected patient populations, mechanically ventilated vs. not ventilated patients) and patient population factors (adults, children), pregnancy or post-partum state, specific illnesses (ARDS, acute kidney injury) and ICU specific interventions such as receipt of rescue oxygenation therapy (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), high frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV)). We also performed a paired analysis for all the countries that reported mortality both during Wave I of the pandemic as well as enrolled for longer than nine months. [20, 21] [22] Risk of publication bias was assessed with a funnel plot, Trim and fill method was used to identify and correct for funnel plot asymmetry. Meta-analysis and meta-regression exploring the influence of patient, study and health system factors on reported mortality was conducted on the logit transformed proportions. Analyses were performed using R version 3.2.5 and SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).",

These reports should be separate from publications reporting on selected populations. Such reports are important to identify risk factors for differential outcomes, but it is very important that such populations should be clearly defined. Such differentiation ensures an accurate and homogenous assessment of disease severity at a global scale. This allows for early recognition in differences in outcomes associated with disease outbreaks over different time periods and geographical regions when considering its impact at a global scale. Ideally this would be accomplished using prospectively developed, flexible and tiered case report forms that are appropriate for a variety of resource settings. [23] Reporting on differences in regional outcomes associated with critical illness in a global context is challenging. The lack of standardized definitions, and differences in severity of disease recognized as critical illness have been cited as potential barriers. [24] [25] [26] When we compared differences in reported mortality based on early reporting compared to prolonged periods of enrollment for countries with available data, there was no difference in the reported mortality over time among countries, but country-specific differences in reported mortality persisted over time (Table 3 ). [7, [27] [28] [29] Our study highlights that the use of geographic variables such as hemispheres or continents is likely less sensitive to differences among regions as differential resources and patient characteristics can exist within broadly defined geographical units. The Global Variability in Reported Mortality for Critical Illness during the 2009-10 H1N1 Pandemic use of either economic development or geographic regions as defined by World Bank was more sensitive in demonstrating the impact on reported mortality. The economic development of the country might be a surrogate marker for the availability of ICU specific therapies, recognizing that substantial intra-country differences may exist among private and public systems.",

We used meta-regression to examine the impact of moderator variables on study effect size. We used random-effects models to aggregate data and generate conservative confidence limits for point estimates. We used the Newcastle-Ottawa scale to ensure we adequately recognized and reported the risk of bias. Although we included studies from all regions of the world, the majority of our outcomes were informed by developed regions with capacity to carry out observational and intervention research, and also, the capacity to provide tertiary care for these patients. Because most prior estimates of global mortality have used extrapolated mortality rates from high-income countries, it is quite possible that global pandemic-associated mortality is higher than previously reported.

Reported mortality for new outbreaks may vary substantially depending upon selected patient characteristics, the number of patients described, and the region and economic status of the outbreak location. These findings have relevance for new and ongoing outbreaks. Outbreaks should use case report forms that are prospectively developed, modifiable depending upon the illness syndrome, scalable to a variety of resource settings, encompass some measure of severity of illness to allow for risk adjustment across regions, and should be freely and globally available. [23] A standardized global approach to reporting on outbreaks and pandemics will provide us more accurate estimates of morbidity and mortality associated with new diseases and provide to the most valid information upon which to base current and future research, clinical care, and health systems responses.
