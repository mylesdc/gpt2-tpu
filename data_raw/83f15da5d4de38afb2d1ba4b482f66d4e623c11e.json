            "text": "Ebolaviruses, highly lethal zoonotic pathogens, possess longer genomes than most other non-segmented negative-strand RNA viruses due in part to long 59 and 39 untranslated regions (UTRs) present in the seven viral transcriptional units. To date, specific functions have not been assigned to these UTRs. With reporter assays, we demonstrated that the Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV) 59-UTRs lack internal ribosomal entry site function. However, the 59-UTRs do differentially regulate cap-dependent translation when placed upstream of a GFP reporter gene. Most dramatically, the 59-UTR derived from the viral polymerase (L) mRNA strongly suppressed translation of GFP compared to a b-actin 59-UTR. The L 59-UTR is one of four viral genes to possess upstream AUGs (uAUGs), and ablation of each uAUG enhanced translation of the primary ORF (pORF), most dramatically in the case of the L 59-UTR. The L uAUG was sufficient to initiate translation, is surrounded by a ''weak'' Kozak sequence and suppressed pORF translation in a position-dependent manner. Under conditions where eIF2a was phosphorylated, the presence of the uORF maintained translation of the L pORF, indicating that the uORF modulates L translation in response to cellular stress. To directly address the role of the L uAUG in virus replication, a recombinant EBOV was generated in which the L uAUG was mutated to UCG. Strikingly, mutating two nucleotides outside of previouslydefined protein coding and cis-acting regulatory sequences attenuated virus growth to titers 10-100-fold lower than a wildtype virus in Vero and A549 cells. The mutant virus also exhibited decreased viral RNA synthesis as early as 6 hours postinfection and enhanced sensitivity to the stress inducer thapsigargin. Cumulatively, these data identify novel mechanisms by which EBOV regulates its polymerase expression, demonstrate their relevance to virus replication and identify a potential therapeutic target.",

A common innate antiviral mechanism is to globally inhibit protein synthesis through the phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of the factor eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF-2a,P) (reviewed in [9, 10] ). In the absence of eIF-2a,P, a complex consisting of eIF2, GTP, and a methionine-tRNA binds to a 40S ribosomal subunit to form the 43S preinitiation complex. The 43S subunit, in complex with additional initiation factors, binds to a 59-m 7 G cap on an mRNA and scans the 59-untranslated region (UTR) downstream to a start codon where translation initiation occurs [11] . When virus infection induces eIF2a,P, eIF2-GTP levels decrease and translation initiation is impaired due to decreased recruitment of the initiator methionine tRNA [12] [13] [14] . eIF-2a,P and subsequent inhibition of cap-dependent translation is regulated by several kinases including PKR, a protein that is induced by type I interferon (IFN-a/b) and activated by viral dsRNA [15, 16] .",

            "text": "Multiple RNA viruses have devised strategies to circumvent host cell translation control. A common example would be viral 59-UTRs that possess an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) which allows translation of viral RNA without a 59-m 7 G cap, thereby permitting translation of proteins in a cell where cap-dependent translation is impaired [9, 10, 17] . Notably, NNS RNA viruses have not been demonstrated to encode IRESes. Furthermore, the presence on each EBOV mRNA of a 59-(m 7 G) cap and a 39 p(A) tail [6] [7] [8] , suggests that they are predominately translated by a cap-dependent mechanism. Another strategy is employed by vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), the prototype NNS RNA virus, which induces preferential translation of its own mRNAs over cellular mRNAs before eIF2a,P occurs, triggering a global inhibition of host cell protein synthesis [18] [19] [20] [21] . While similar to VSV in genetic organization, filoviruses modulate cellular translation in distinct ways. In addition to blocking IFN-a/b production and signaling pathways in infected cells [1, [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] , EBOV also impairs PKR activation in HEK293 cells. In contrast to VSV, global inhibition of host protein synthesis during infection has not been reported, although in vitro studies suggest that VP40 might downregulate host cell expression [19, [31] [32] [33] . However, in persistently infected mouse cells EBOV has been shown to induce PKR,P and eIF2a,P, and reducing eIF2a,P in these cells reactivated virus replication [34] . Despite these observations, the mechanisms by which filoviruses may regulate viral mRNA translation in the absence and presence of eIF2a,P is not completely understood.",

            "text": "A characteristic of filovirus genomes is that they have long 59and 39-UTRs relative to other NNS viruses [3, 5, 35, 36] . Our studies specifically focused on the 59-UTRs of the seven EBOV mRNAs, since 59-UTRs are critical for translation initiation. Four of the seven mRNAs contain small alternate upstream open reading frames (uORFs), yet their significance remains uncharacterized. Interestingly, uORFs are a common feature of cellular mRNAs and modulate translation of a primary ORF (pORF) by decreasing the number and/or efficiency of scanning ribosomes to reinitiate at the start codon of the pORF [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] . Multiple factors contribute to the frequency of translation initiation at a uAUG versus a pAUG. These include the strength of the Kozak consensus sequence surrounding the uAUG, where A/Gcc AUG G is considered an optimal sequence. Furthermore, the intercistronic space between the uORF and the pAUG, and the phosphorylation status of eIF-2a [38, 39, [43] [44] [45] determine whether translation occurs at a uAUG or pAUG. In the absence of eIF-2a,P, cap-dependent translation is efficient allowing for higher rates of ribosome initiation at the uORF [11] . During conditions of enhanced eIF2a,P, translation initiation is impaired causing a ribosome to scan past the uAUG and initiate at the pAUG. Consequently, under conditions of cell stress, eIF2a,P promotes translation initiation at the pORF of select mRNAs possessing uORFs (e.g. ATF4, CHOP, GCN2 mRNAs) [12, 43, 46, 47] .",

Mutating any of the four uAUGs present in the EBOV genome enhances translation at the corresponding pORF. The most dramatic effect was with the L gene where the L uAUG can potently suppress pORF translation; however, in response to eIF2a,P, the L uAUG maintains L translation. Modulating viral polymerase levels is biologically significant since ablating the L uORF in a recombinant EBOV reduces viral titers 10-100-fold in cell culture, severely impairs viral RNA synthesis, and functions to maintain virus titers in cells treated with stress inducing agents. These data suggest that a uORF in the EBOV L mRNA regulates polymerase expression in response to the status of the cellular innate immune response and is required for optimal virus replication.",

However, EBOV 59-UTRs are long, compared to those of most other NNS RNA viruses, ranging between 80-460 nucleotides, and are predicted to possess secondary structures [5] (and Figure S1 ). Therefore, we tested if any of the EBOV 59-UTRs are able to promote cap-independent, internal translation initiation. We designed a bicistronic reporter in the mammalian expression plasmid pCAGGS where the firefly luciferase ORF is followed by a multiple cloning site (MCS) and then by Renilla luciferase ( Figure 1A) . Each of the EBOV 59-UTRs and the EMCV IRES were placed within the MCS, and these constructs were transfected into 293T cells. Eighteen hours post transfection, cells were harvested and subjected to a dual luciferase reporter assay. The EMCV IRES was able to drive capindependent Renilla luciferase expression. However, none of the EBOV 59-UTRs allowed detectable internal translation initiation as indicated by the Renilla luciferase reporter ( Figure 1B ). Furthermore, a NP 59-UTR-GFP reporter mRNA lacking a m 7 G cap reduced GFP levels by over 90% as compared to a capped version of the same mRNA (data not shown). These data indicate that the EBOV 59-UTRs do not function as IRESes and suggest that in infected cells they are translated by a cap-dependent mechanism, consistent with the capped-nature of EBOV mRNAs [6] [7] [8] .",

            "text": "Filoviruses (Ebola and Marburg viruses) are emerging zoonotic pathogens that cause lethal hemorrhagic fever in humans and have the potential to be employed as bioterrorism agents. Currently, approved therapeutics to treat filovirus infections are not available and new treatment strategies could be facilitated by improved mechanistic insight into the virus replication cycle. Compared to other related viruses, filovirus messenger RNAs have unusually long 59 untranslated regions (UTRs) with undefined functions. In the Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV) genome, four of its seven messenger RNAs have 59-UTRs with a small upstream open reading frame (uORF). We found that a uORF present in the EBOV polymerase (L) 59-UTR suppresses L protein production and established a reporter assay to demonstrate that this uORF maintains L translation following the induction of an innate immune response; a phenomenon observed with several uORFcontaining cellular messenger RNAs. The presence of the uORF is important for optimal virus replication, because a mutant virus lacking the upstream reading frame replicates less efficiently than a wildtype virus, an attenuation which is more pronounced following the induction of cellular stress. These studies define a novel mechanism by which filovirus upstream open reading frames modulate virus protein translation in the face of an innate immune response and highlight their importance in filovirus replication.",

GFP was used to quantify the effects of each 59-UTR on translation, because it was previously described to be a sensitive reporter with a large dynamic range suitable for translation assays [48] . As a control, we also transfected an mRNA construct with a b-actin 59-UTR upstream of GFP ( Figure 2A ). The in vitro transcribed mRNAs were quantified by qRT-PCR. Equivalent copy numbers of each mRNA were transfected into 293T cells. At 2.5 hours post transfection, cells were harvested and the mean fluorescence intensity (M.F.I.) of the GFP positive population was quantified by flow cytometry and normalized to the M.F.I. of the b-actin 59-UTR control ( Figure 2B ). Figure 2B summarize these data which are graphed from left to right according to the order of the genes as they appear in the viral genome. The NP, VP35, VP40 and VP30 59-UTRs resulted in GFP expression comparable to the bactin 59-UTR construct. The GP and VP24 59-UTRs modestly, but reproducibly, enhanced GFP expression relative to the b-actin control. qRT-PCR of RNA isolated from the transfected 293T cells in Figure 2C demonstrated comparable levels of GFP mRNA in each group at the time of the analysis, suggesting that any differences in GFP expression are due to differences in translation. We also transfected primary human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs), because DCs are important targets of EBOV infection in vivo [49] and analyzed GFP expression. In DCs, the GFP expression profile was similar to that observed in 293T cells ( Figure 2D ). In contrast to the other EBOV 59-UTRs, the L 59-UTR dramatically suppressed GFP expression in both 293T cells and DCs compared to the b -actin 59-UTR ( Figure 2B and D, the L bars are highlighted in gray). Representative histograms of flow cytometry data in each cell line are depicted in Figure 2E and 2F, displaying the effect of the L 59-UTR mediated suppression of GFP compared to the b-actin control 59-UTR.",

            "text": "uAUGs present in the 59-UTRs of the VP35, VP30, VP24 and L mRNA modulate translation initiation at the pAUG One feature of the 80 nt long L 59-UTR that may influence translation of the pORF is the presence of an uAUG and a corresponding uORF that overlaps the pORF (Figure 2A) . However, the L 59-UTR is only one of four EBOV 59-UTRs that possess uAUGs and uORFs. The VP35, VP30 and VP24 59-UTRs also have small uORFs upstream of the pORF. Unlike L, these do not overlap the pORF (Figure 2A ). In order to characterize the functional significance of these uAUGs, we replaced the uAUG codons present in the VP35, VP30, VP24, and L 59-UTRs with UUG in the context of the GFP reporter ( Figure 3A ). RNA transfections were performed the same way as in Figure 2 . Flow cytometry demonstrated that each uAUG suppresses GFP signals, since their ablation enhanced GFP expression in 293T cells ( Figure 3B ). Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of RNA isolated from the transfected 293T cells demonstrated comparable levels of GFP mRNA in each group at the time of the analysis ( Figure 3C ). We also performed the same experiment in DCs, which produced a GFP expression profile similar to that obtained in 293T cells ( Figure 3D ). In both 293T cells and DCs, ablation of the L 59-UTR uAUG resulted in a 6.32 and 5.59 fold increase, respectively, in GFP signal relative to its corresponding 59-UTR possessing a uAUG ( Figure 3B and D, bars representing the L 59-UTR data are highlighted in gray). By comparison, deleting the uAUG in the VP35, VP30, and VP24 59-UTRs increased GFP expression between 1.75 and 3.20 fold in both 293T and DCs ( Figure 3B and D). Representative histograms from 293T cells and DCs of the L 59-UTR-GFP reporter with and without the uAUG are shown in Figure 3E and 3F. These data demonstrate that each of the uAUGs present in EBOV 59-UTRs suppresses translation of the pORF, though the VP30 uAUG has the least dramatic effect on reporter expression. Because the uAUG of the L 59-UTR had the most dramatic effect on pORF (GFP) translation, we chose to further characterize the L 59-UTR.",

This truncated version of L was used as a model transcript because of the length of the L mRNA (6783 nt long, encoding a protein of 2212 a.a.). Each construct was cloned into an expression plasmid, and equivalent amounts of each plasmid were transfected into 293T cells. Consistent with the GFP reporter data, ablation of the uAUG in the L 59-UTR substantially enhanced the signal of the L ORF by western blot ( Figure 4B ). This effect was much more dramatic when L was co-transfected with the polymerase co-factor VP35 and was specific for VP35 since co-transfection with a plasmid expressing GFP did not enhance L expression (compare lanes 1 and 2 with 3 and 4). The enhancing effect of VP35 may reflect the ability of VP35 to promote L protein stability, as the functional equivalent of VP35 in other NNS viruses stabilizes L proteins [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] , or it could reflect the ability of VP35 to stimulate translation through inhibition of PKR [32] ( Figure 4B ). These data confirm that the uAUG in the L 59-UTR suppresses L expression in the context of its natural sequence.",

Furthermore, adding a ''strong'' Kozak sequence around the uAUG (A at the 23 position and a G at the +4 position, where the A of the AUG is designated as +1) increased GFP signal ( Figure 5B ).

Intorducing a strong Kozak sequence surrounding the uAUG suppressed GFP translation (compare GFP levels between the wildtype L 59-UTR reporter and the uAUG SK construct in Figure 6B and RNA levels in 6C). This is consistent with data in 5B, since an increase in translation initiation at the uAUG would be expected to suppress pAUG translation and therefore decrease GFP expression ( Figure 6B ). In contrast, ''weak'' uAUG Kozak sequences did not enhance GFP signal (compare uAUG WK1 and WK2 to the wildtype L 59-UTR), suggesting that the parental uAUG is in a weak translation initiation context. Introducing a stop codon directly after the uAUG did enhance GFP (construct labeled uAUG STOP); this likely reflects cap-dependent scanning and reinitiation after the stop codon. Finally, ablating the uAUG codon to UUG or UCG, changes expected to leave the L 59-UTR predicted secondary structure intact ( Figure S1 and Table S1), enhanced GFP expression 6-7 fold, providing further evidence that translation initiation at the uAUG regulates expression of the pORF ( Figure 6B ).",

We confirmed that the AUGRUCG mutation in the L 59-UTR enhances translation at the pORF in our established, 293T cell-based GFP reporter assay without altering predicted RNA secondary structures (see Figure 6 , Figure S1 , and Table S1 ). The genomes of both the recombinant wildtype and mutant EBOVs were sequenced and confirmed to possess no additional mutations. Figure 8B outlines the predicted EBOV L mRNA for the wildtype and the L 59-UTR mutant virus, while Figure 8C displays the tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID50), the relative copy number of vRNA, and the vRNA copy number to TCID50 ratio of both the mutant and wildtype EBOVs. Figures 8D and 8E display the growth kinetics of each virus in both Vero and A549 cells after infection at a multiplicity of 0.005. The EBOV L 59-UTR mutant displayed slowed growth kinetics compared to the wildtype virus in both Vero and A549 cells. This effect was more prominent in A549 cells where the mutant virus grew to approximately a 100-fold lower titer by day 7 post infection ( Figure 8E ). We further confirmed the growth defect of the L 59-UTR mutant virus by infecting both Vero and A549 cells at a higher MOI of 0.1 ( Figure S2 ). In both cell lines there were decreased mutant virus titers over the first 4 days in culture, but the mutant virus did eventually reach equivalent titers in both cell lines ( Figure S2 ). The AUGRUCG codon mutation was stable as a 700 nucleotide region surrounding the L uAUG did not accumulate additional changes following nine passages in A549 cells (data not shown). That second site repressor mutations did not arise is in line with the in vitro data indicating uAUG function is position dependent (Figure 7) . Therefore, sites where single nucleotide changes could introduce new uAUGs might not create effective regulators of L translation. These data demonstrate that the mutation of these two nucleotides, which lie outside of any previously described regulatory or coding sequence, significantly attenuates EBOV replication.",

Therefore, it has not been possible to directly assess the impact of the uAUG mutation on L protein levels. To determine how mutation of the L uAUG affects virus replication, RNA was isolated from A549 cells infected with wildtype and mutant virus at a multiplicity of 1 at 6, Figure 5 . Efficiency of translation initiation at L uAUG is determined by its sequence context. A. L 59-UTR GFP mRNA reporter constructs were generated such that the uORF is fused in frame to GFP. The nucleotide sequence immediately surrounding the uAUG of each construct is displayed. The first construct (uORF-GFP) includes the first 46 nucleotides of the L 59-UTR up to the uAUG followed by the entire L uORF sequence placed in frame with the GFP ORF (labeled uORF-GFP). The middle construct (uORF-GFP SK) is identical to the first, but the uAUG is surrounded by a strong Kozak sequence (A at the 23 position and a G at the +4 position, where the A of the AUG is designated as +1). The bottom construct includes the L 59-UTR, through the uAUG and the second codon of the uORF which was placed in frame with the GFP ORF, but lacks the rest of the uORF. In each case, the start codon for GFP was removed. The number of nucleotides in each construct is indicated and the features of each construct are summarized in the box above the diagram. B. Equal amounts of each in vitro transcribed mRNA were transfected into 293T cells. At 2.5 hours post transfection, cells were harvested and analyzed by flow cytometry. The experiment was performed in triplicate, and a representative sample is displayed for each group. C. GFP mRNA levels, as determined by real time PCR, present in the transfected cells described in B were determined for each sample. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1003147.g005 12, and 24 hours post-infection and negative sense genomic RNA (vRNA) and mRNA levels were assessed by quantitative RT-PCR ( Figure 9A ). The primer pairs in this study (Table S2) were validated with linearized plasmids encoding each of the seven EBOV genes ( Figure S3 ). As early as six hours post infection and at each additional time point, the vRNA levels of the EBOV mutant virus were reduced compared to wildtype EBOV ( Figure 9B ). This difference in RNA synthesis between the wildtype and mutant virus was also apparent for each of the seven viral mRNAs (Figures 9C-E) . Furthermore, differences in mRNA levels between the wildtype and mutant virus were similar for each of the seven transcriptional units at all times post infection and their abundance indicated the presence of a transcriptional gradient, with NP mRNA being the most abundant and L mRNA being the least abundant ( Figure 9C-E) . These data are consistent with the data obtained with the minigenome assay ( Figure 8A ), in which excess L levels result in decreased viral RNA synthesis.",

For a number of cellular transcripts possessing uORFs (e.g. CHOP, ATF4), such stress conditions cause scanning ribosomes to bypass uAUGs, resulting in enhanced translation at the pORF [43, 47] . To test if the L uORF might serve to maintain cap-dependent translation initiation at the pAUG under circumstances where eIF2a,P levels are enhanced, we designed reporter constructs modeled after ones from previous studies [43, 47] . An expression plasmid was generated with the L 59-UTR followed by the first 13 a.a. of L in frame with firefly luciferase (denoted L-FF, Figure 10A ). We also generated an identical construct without the uAUG (Lns-FF). To test these reporter constructs in the absence or presence of cell stress, we first determined that TG treatment did induce eIF2a,P ( Figure 10B ). Next, 293T cells were transfected with a control Renilla luciferase plasmid and either the L-FF or Lns-FF constructs. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, 293T cells were treated with DMSO (labeled D) or with four concentrations TG to induce eIF2a,P, which was measured at 6 hours post treatment by western blot (shown in Figure 10C ). In the same experiment, cells were harvested at 10 hours post treatment, and the firefly/Renilla luciferase ratio for each group was calculated. Consistent with the GFP and western blot assays, the wildtype L 59-UTR suppressed luciferase signal relative to the L 59-UTR without a uAUG ( Figure 10D ). Furthermore, cells transfected with L-FF and treated with TG exhibited a 2-fold increase in the firefly/Renilla ratio over a Figure 6 . pORF translation is suppressed by a strong uAUG Kozak sequence in the L 59-UTR, but is not affected by a weak uAUG Kozak sequence. A. Diagram depicting the in vitro generated L 59-UTR GFP mRNA reporter constructs with permutations surrounding the L uAUG. For the L uORF, the black box represents the L uORF sequence, while the gray box depicts the remainder of the overlapping uORF that consists of GFP-derived sequences. Each sequence surrounding the uAUG above the diagram represents a reporter construct. The top is the wildtype nucleotide sequence surrounding the L uAUG (WT L 59-UTR). The next construct has a strong Kozak sequence (A at the 23 position and a G at the +4 position, where the A of the AUG is designated as +1). Two constructs predicted to have a weak Kozak sequence (uAUG WK1 and WK2) have mutations at the +4 and +4/+5 positions, respectively. The construct labeled ''uAUG STOP'' has a point mutation that incorporates a stop codon directly after the uAUG start codon. Finally, uUUG and uUCG both ablate the uAUG start codon. Each construct is analyzed in panel B. B. Equal amounts of each in vitro transcribed mRNA were transfected into 293T cells. At 2.5 hours post transfection, cells were harvested and analyzed by flow cytometry. Each bar represents the mean and standard deviation of triplicate samples, and all values were calculated relative to the B-actin 59-UTR GFP control mRNA, which was set to 100%. C.

This assay included the ATF4 59-UTR upstream of firefly luciferase as a positive control to measure the stress response ( Figure 11B and [43] ). TG treatment specifically enhanced the Firefly/Renilla ratio 2-3 fold in the L-FF group compared to untreated cells (labeled U) or DMSO treated cells (labeled D, Figure 11B ). This effect was dependent on the uAUG, since the Firefly/Renilla ratio in the Lns-FF transfected samples did not exhibit the same trend. We also tested a construct where the uAUG was surrounded by the ''strong'' Kozak sequence, demonstrated in Figures 5 and 6 to enhance translation at the uAUG (Lsk-FF, Figure 11A ). We predicted that a strong Kozak sequence would increase translation initiation at the uAUG, decrease ribosome bypass, and suppress translation at the pAUG. This sequence might also impair translational modulation at the pAUG in response to cell stress, consistent with studies examining the CHOP 59-UTR [47] . Reporter gene expression from this Lsk-FF construct responded to TG treatment Figure 7 . Suppression of pORF translation by the uAUG in the L 59-UTR is position dependent. A.

Nucleotide changes that differ from the wildtype L 59-UTR sequence are indicated in bold and the underlined sequences highlight the uORFs.

The vRNA was reverse transcribed with a vRNA specific primer, and the relative vRNA copy number was calculated by quantitative PCR. This assay used primers specific for a region of the EBOV genome corresponding to the NP gene (see Figure S3 ). The ratio of vRNA to infectious virus was calculated for each sample. D and E.

A549 cells were infected with either the wildtype or 59-UTR uAUG mutant EBOV and then treated with DMSO or with TG to induce cell stress (illustrated in Figure 11C ). TG treatment decreased titers of both viruses compared to a DMSO control. However, the wildtype EBOV titer was suppressed to a lesser degree than was the mutant virus titer (labeled L 59-UTR Mut, Figure 11D ), suggesting the uAUG functions to maintain virus replication in the presence of a stress response. Taken together, both the reporter and virus infection data indicate that the L uORF suppresses translation initiation at the L pORF, but the uORF also allows levels of L translation to be maintained when eIF2a,P increases, as might occur due to ER stress or activation of PKR during virus infection. This would allow virus replication to be maintained in the presence of a host cell innate immune response. A proposed model is illustrated in Figure 11E .",

The average length of a EBOV 59 UTR is 214 nt, compared to rabies virus (RV), Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and VSV which are 23, 59 and 21 nt respectively (Genbank: EF206716.1 and EF206716.1, and NC_001560.1). Moreover, filovirus mRNAs are strikingly similar to eukaryotic mRNAs. The average length of a eukaryotic mRNA 59-UTR ranges from 90 to 210 nt depending on the study [60] [61] [62] . Furthermore, while 30-40% of the eukaryotic transcriptome contains uORFs [63, 64] , none are present in VSV, RV or NDV. In contrast, four out of the seven (57%) EBOV 59-UTRs contain a uAUG/uORF. Our study provides evidence that the 59-UTRs of EBOV transcripts modulate translation and is consistent with a scanning model of translation initiation [65] . The presence of uORFs within these 59-UTRs suppresses translation of pORFs, and most dramatically the translation of L. Furthermore, the L uAUG enhances L translation in response to eIF2a,P. NNS viruses regulate their gene expression via a transcriptional gradient, where genes at the 39 end of the negative-sense genome are transcribed more abundantly than those at the 59 end ( [3, 6] and illustrated in Figure 9 ). This study provides evidence for an additional mechanism by which EBOVs may regulate viral protein levels, demonstrates that an intact L uORF is critical for optimal virus replication, and suggests that the L uORF functions to maintain EBOV replication in the face of a cell stress response.",

Results from these experiments determined that regulatory regions encompassing both the VP30 and L 59-UTRs modestly suppress reporter activity. In these assays, reporter activity was dependent upon virus transcription, replication and translation of a reporter gene, in contrast to our experiments which allow for the direct assessment of each EBOV 59-UTR on translation.

First are 59-UTRs lacking uORFs which translated reporter mRNAs to levels comparable to the b-actin 59-UTR-GFP mRNA (NP, GP, VP40, Figure 2 ). Second are those, other than L, that possess uORFs. These also translated reporter mRNAs to levels comparable to the b-actin control (VP35, VP30, and VP24). Ablating each of these uAUGs also enhanced GFP expression to levels above the b -actin 59-UTR control mRNA (Figure 2 and 3) . Why we observe an enhancement in reporter signal after mutating each uAUG will be a focus of future studies. The third group includes only the L 59-UTR, which strongly suppresses translation of the pORF, a suppression mediated by the L uAUG (Figures 2-7) . Interestingly, the first four nucleotides of the transcriptional start sequences are GAUG for each EBOV 59 UTR (with the exception of NP and L). We did not test the function of these uAUGs since prior work demonstrates that an AUG this close to the 59 end of an mRNA does not efficiently initiate translation [73] .",

D. The L uAUG functions to maintain L translation following TG treatment. 293T cells were transfected with pRLTK and the L-FF or the Lns-FF reporter constructs. At 24 hpt, cells were treated with four doses of TG and harvested at 10 hours post treatment. Dual luciferase assays were performed to determine the firefly to Renilla luciferase ratio in the presence or absence of TG treatment and the FF to Renilla ratio of the DMSO treated cells transfected with L-FF was set to 1.

B. A549 cells were transfected with pRLTK and either L-FF, Lns-FF or Lsk-FF. An established stress reporter, regulating L pORF translation is supported by our studies demonstrating that altering the L uAUG from a weak Kozak sequence to a strong Kozak sequence further attenuates pORF (GFP) expression ( Figure 6 ). The location of the uAUG in the L 59-UTR is also critical for translation suppression, since only one of four constructs with relocated uAUGs represses reporter translation (Figure 7) . It is interesting that the uAUG is predicted to lie at the top of a stem-loop and is possible that this positioning contributes to uAUG function ( Figure S1 ). Future studies will address this possibility. Finally, the L uAUG maintains L translation in the presence of eIF2a,P, when cap-dependent translation is impaired (Figure 10 and 11 ). It will be interesting to determine if the other EBOV mRNAs with uORFs enhance translation in the presence of eIF2a,P.",

            "text": "In some respects, the L uORF resembles the arrangement of ATF4, CHOP, and GCN2 mRNAs, which also encode overlapping and/or upstream uORFs [43, 46, 47] . The arrangement of the L 59-UTR slightly differs from the ATF4 mRNA, which has one additional upstream uORF and one overlapping uORF, but is similar to CHOP mRNA, which has a single uORF 25nt upstream of the pORF [43, 47] . In our studies, addition of TG induced expression from the L 59 UTR construct by 2-3 fold, although in infected cells where L and VP35 are co-expressed, the differences may well be greater (see Figure 4) . Nonetheless, experiments with ATF4 and CHOP 59-UTRs enhanced protein expression comparably ( [43, 47] and Figure 11 ). It is worth noting that ATF4 protein levels are very low in the absence of cell stress. In contrast, some expression of the EBOV L protein must be maintained to sustain virus replication. Therefore, it is likely that the uORF arrangement of the EBOV L mRNA provides a mechanism to keep translation of L low while allowing its upregulation in the presence of eIF2a,P. This would effectively maintain L expression under cell stress conditions. Also, at four different doses of TG, we observed a similar translational maintenance, consistent with previous ATF4 mRNA studies [43] . Therefore, we propose that the L uORF modulates L translation by a similar mechanism (modeled in Figure 11E ). During conditions when eIF2-GTP is plentiful, translation initiates more frequently at the L uAUG. Stress induced eIF2a,P reduces eIF2-GTP levels and the efficiency of translation initiation. Ribosomal subunits therefore scan past the L uAUG to the pAUG at a higher frequency, thereby maintaining L translation.",

Enhanced expression of VP35 and VP24 could benefit the virus because these proteins counter innate immune responses, while VP35 and VP30, like L, are required for viral RNA synthesis ( [23, 29] and reviewed in [74] ).",

Another study demonstrated that low amounts of L were capable of driving polymerase expression, though this activity did not diminish with increasing amounts of L [35] . The latter system used a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing T7 RNA polymerase in HeLa cells, while our T7 polymerase is expressed from a plasmid in 293T cells.

While the L uAUG mutant virus was able to reach similar titers to the wildtype virus by day 7 post infection in Vero cells, the difference in growth was more pronounced in A549 cells where the mutant virus never reached equivalent titers to that of wildtype EBOV. One explanation for the enhanced growth defect in A549 cells is provided by the data in Figure 9 , where there is a clear delay in virus transcription and replication (indicated by differences in virus mRNA and vRNA levels).

However, L mRNAs from multiple filoviruses do possess uORFs. For example, the Reston EBOV L mRNA (AY769362.1) possesses an overlapping uORF of 24 a.a., and the Sudan EBOV has a uORF that terminates just 27nt upstream of the pORF (NC_006432.1).

It is likely these other uORFs are translated into small peptides in infected cells, and it is possible that these peptides may perform a specific function(s). In Drosophila, small peptides derived from a polycistronic mRNA are required for proper development, since ablating these ORFs disrupts actin-based cell morphogenesis [75] .

In addition, the quality of the RNA was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis to ensure a single product of the correct size. Both 293T cells and dendritic cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) with either equal copy numbers of mRNA (determined by real time PCR) or equal nanograms of mRNA (both methods produced similar results). Cells were analyzed for GFP expression by flow cytometry and the mean fluorescence intensity of the GFP positive cells was determined for each group. Also total RNA was isolated from cells (Qiagen, Cat# 74104), and levels of GFP mRNA were determined by real time RT-PCR from the same cells subject to FACS analysis.

For cloning purposes and to serve as genetic markers 4 nucleotides within the NP (c2149g, all positions correspond to the viral genome), VP24 (a11043g) and L (c13194g, c15639g) ORFs were silently mutated, and the resulting plasmid was designate pAmp-rgEBOV. Virus rescued from this plasmid showed identical growth kinetics to a recombinant EBOV without these mutations. To generate a cDNA clone for the mutant virus, a subgenomic fragment of the genome was subcloned into pKan, the L uAUG mutated (a11547t, t11548c), and cloned back into pAmp (pAmp-rgEBOV-Mut). Both wildtype rgEBOV and mutant rgEBOV-Mut were rescued in VeroE6 cells as previously described [86] . Briefly, 50% confluent VeroE6 cells were transfected using Transit LT1 (Mirus, cat #MIR 2300) according to the manufacturer's instructions with the following plasmids: 125 ng pCAGGS-NP, 125 ng pCAGGS-VP35, 75 ng pCAGGS-VP30, 1000 ng pCAGGS-L, 250 ng pCAGGS-T7, 250 ng full-length plasmid. 24 hours post transfection the medium was exchanged, and after 7 days supernatant was transferred onto fresh VeroE6 cells. Upon development of cytopathic effect (after 7-14 days) supernatant from these cells was clarified and stocks frozen in liquid nitrogen. RNA from these stocks was isolated and the entire genome was sequenced to ensure there were no unwanted mutations. For virus growth curves, both Vero and A549 cells were infected with each virus at a MOI of 0.005 and supernatant was harvested each day for 7 days. Virus titers were measured by tissue culture infectious dose 50 in VeroE6 cells. To measure viral RNA levels, RNA from infected A549 cells (MOI of 1) was isolated at 6, 12 and 24 hours post infection. To produce cDNA specific for genomic (negative sense) RNA, total RNA was reverse transcribed in independent reactions with six primers, each complementary to the negative sense genomic RNA (Invitrogen, cat #18080-051). To produce cDNA specific for messenger RNA, mRNA was first isolated from total RNA (Invitrogen, cat# 610.06) and the mRNA fraction was reverse transcribed. Real time PCR with validated primer pairs specific to the EBOV genome were developed to quantify the relative amounts of each RNA species. Sequences of the primer pairs are listed in Table S2 and standard curves generated with these primers off of DNA plasmids corresponding to each EBOV gene are displayed in Figure S3 . Figure S3 Primer pairs for PCR amplification of each of the EBOV genes exhibit similar amplification efficiencies. Primers specific for each of the seven EBOV transcriptional units were designed and validated on linearized DNA plasmids encoding each of the seven genes. Plasmids were normalized for absolute copy number and each was diluted in serial 10-fold steps. An aliquot of each dilution was used for quantitative PCR. The cycle threshold (CT) number is plotted on the Y-axis while the plasmid copy number is plotted on the Y-axis. Primer efficiencies of each of the seven primer pairs were determined to be over 95%.",

Strand specific PCR was performed to measure the levels of viral mRNA or genomic RNA (vRNA). Levels of individual viral mRNAs were determined from purified polyadenylated RNA by quantitative real-time RT-PCR with seven primers, each specific to a different viral gene (NP, VP35, VP40, GP, VP30, VP24 or L, as indicated).
