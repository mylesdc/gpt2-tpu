Its purpose is to establish one national communicable disease surveillance system integrating different surveillance activities into one, consisting of functions using the same or similar structures, processes and personnel. The goal is an effective communicable disease control based on functioning effective disease surveillance and response systems. Since then, many countries in Africa have adapted and adopted it with some including noncommunicable diseases as well [3, 4] .",

This does not seem to be related to the type of HS or training level of the responsible agent, even though the numbers might have been too small to detect a difference. The data quality problems are also related to points discussed under simplicity, notably lack of guidelines and training [10, 13] . They could further be explained by the small number of supervision visits that took place in the year preceding the evaluation, as well as the already mentioned high agent turnover. Colleagues in Madagascar recently evaluated the national sentinel influenza surveillance system that includes 34 HS and is also based on SMS transmission of aggregated data. It performed well regarding the quality of the data collected, but pointed out a need for improving staff training [14] .",

Since April 2017, a weekly surveillance bulletin is circulated to central level, regional and district health offices. We hope this bulletin will also be accessible to the data providers, to show them the use and benefit of their IDSR-related work activities. ",
