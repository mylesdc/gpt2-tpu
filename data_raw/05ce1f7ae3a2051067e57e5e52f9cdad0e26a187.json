Although basal or TPA induced phosphorylation of I\u03baB\u03b1 was not altered, its ubiquitination was markedly reduced in ORF2 expressing cells. Further analysis revealed that ORF2 protein could directly associate with the F-box protein, beta transducin repeat containing protein (\u03b2TRCP) and ORF2 over expression resulted in reduced association of I\u03baB\u03b1 with the SKP1 and CUL1 components of the SCF \u03b2TRCP complex. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay of the proximal promoter regions of MHC-I heavy chain and IL-8 genes using p65 antibody and LPS stimulated ORF2 expressing cell extract revealed decreased association of p65 with the above regions, indicating that ORF2 inhibited p65 binding at endogenous promoters. Conclusions: In this report we suggest a mechanism by which ORF2 protein of HEV may inhibit host cell NF-\u03baB activity during the course of a viral infection.",

In unstimulated cells, the NF-\u03baB dimers (p50/p65 heterodimer or p50/p50 homodimer) are retained in the cytoplasm in an inactive form as a consequence of their association with members of another family of proteins called I kappa B (I\u03baB). Upon stimulation by activators like tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin 1 (IL-1), CD40L, lipopolysaccharides (LPS) etc., signaling cascades involving activation of various protein kinases are initiated that result in the recruitment and activation of the I\u03baB kinases (IKKs) which phosphorylate I\u03baB\u03b1, leading to its degradation by the 26S proteasome complex. The degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1 exposes the p50/p65 nuclear localization sequence and allows NF-\u03baB dimers to translocate to the nucleus, bind to \u03baB motifs in the promoters regions of many genes, and regulate their transcription [1] .",

This vector was inducible by NF-\u03baB activating agents like TPA or IL-1\u03b2. Huh7 cells were transiently transfected with the NF-\u03baB CAT vector along with either ORF2 or ORF3 expression plasmids. Assay of chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) activity using these cell extracts revealed that ORF2 protein inhibited the NF-\u03baB CAT activity ( Figure 1A ). However, no inhibition was observed by ORF3 expression ( Figure 1A ). In order to investigate whether ORF2 mediated inhibition of NF-\u03baB activity was an artifact of the experimental system, cells were treated for 30 minutes with Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (TPA), a known inducer of NF-\u03baB activity [11] , or transfected with an expression construct of I\u03baB kinase \u03b2, which is the catalytic subunit of the IKK complex that acts as a constitutively active inducer of NF-\u03baB activity [12] . TPA treatment increased NF-\u03baB activity of mock transfected cells by approximately 4 folds whereas ORF2 expressing cells did not show any significant increase in NF-\u03baB activity ( Figure 1A) . Similarly, co-expression of ORF2 in IKK\u03b2 transfected cells resulted in downregulation of NF-\u03baB activity in comparison to cells transfected with only IKK\u03b2 ( Figure 1B) . These results clearly suggest that HEV ORF2 inhibits NF-\u03baB activity.",

ORF2 expression marginally increased the levels of phospho I\u03baB\u03b1 ( Figure 2C , upper panel, lane 1 and 2; see the densitometric estimation of band intensities in the graph below) as well as the level of total I\u03baB\u03b1 (middle panel, lane 1 and 2). In IKK\u03b2 and ORF2 co-expressing cells, the level of total as well as phosphorylated I\u03baB\u03b1 was significantly higher as compared to only IKK\u03b2 expressing cells ( Figure 2C , lane 3 and 4). In order to check that the decreased band intensity in IKK\u03b2 expressing cells was due to accelerated degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1, one set of cells were also treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 for 2 hours, resulting in equal I\u03baB\u03b1 protein levels in both the samples ( Figure 2C , lane 5 and 6). Aliquots of the sample were immunoblotted with anti-calnexin antibody to check equal loading. Thus, it appears that ORF2 expression prevents the degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1. The fact that ORF2 did not interfere with phosphorylation of I\u03baB\u03b1 by the IKK complex was further confirmed by checking the activity of the IKK complex. ORF2 expressing cell lysate was immunoblotted for phospho IKK\u03b1/\u03b2 (ser180/181) levels. As expected, ORF2 expression (2 or 4 \u03bcg plasmid DNA transfection) did not modulate the levels of pIKK \u03b1/\u03b2 ( Figure 2D ).",

As a control to check whether the observed phenomenon was specific for NF-\u03baB, aliquots of the LPS treated lysate were immunoprecipitated with anti-SP1 antibody (specific for SP1 transcription factor, which also binds to MHC-I heavy chain promoter) and purified ChIP DNA was PCR amplified using MHC-I heavy chain promoter specific primer.

            "text": "Hence it is worth speculating that the ORF2 \u03b2TRCP interaction would occur in the cytoplasm. Although ORF2 is an N-linked glycoprotein, which is cotranslationally translocated to the endoplasmic reticulum, recent studies performed in our laboratory have demonstrated that a fraction of ORF2 protein exploits the ER retro-translocation machinery to get access to the cytoplasm, where it is detected as a non-glycosylated protein. Importantly, in contrast to other retrotranslocated substrates, retrotranslocated ORF2 protein is not immediately degraded by the 26S proteasome complex present in the cytoplasm [16] . Thus, cytoplasm localized deglycosylated ORF2 protein may be able to associate with \u03b2TRCP. Indeed, experiments done using \u039435 ORF2 protein suggest that non-glycosylated, cytoplasm localized ORF2 protein is capable of associating with \u03b2TRCP and inhibiting NF-\u03baB activity. Further studies need to be undertaken to verify the exact mechanism.",

In an infected cell, by default, pathogenic antigens are processed by the proteasome and presented by the MHC class I molecules so that the former can be recognized by cytolytic T cells. This helps in pathogen clearance at an early stage of infection. Thus, it is beneficial for any pathogen to escape this step. In fact, downregulation of MHC class I both at transcriptional and post-translational level is observed in many pathogenic infections [17] [18] [19] . Since NF-\u03baB is one of the major transcription factors induced during pathogen infection that enhances gene expression of many chemokines and class I molecules in the infected cell, inhibition of the NF-\u03baB activity by pathogen encoded proteins will ensure evasion of host immune response at an early stage; thus providing the pathogen a time window to establish successful infection.",

We have identified the ability of the ORF2 protein of the HEV to inhibit host cell NFKB activity. However, whether such an event is recapitulated during the natural course of HEV infection and whether it is crucial for the virus induced pathogenic effects, can be answered only by performing similar experiments using a model organism infected with the wild type virus. Nevertheless, the present study confirms the NFKB inhibitory property of the HEV ORF2 protein and provides some evidence suggesting a plausible mechanism underlying this event.",

PCR was performed using primers flanking the proximal promoter region of MHC-I heavy chain and IL-8 genes. Lane 7 shows ChIP from EGFP expressing cells immunoprecipitated with rabbit pre-immune serum. Lane 8 shows ChIP from mock immuonprecipitation (without cell lysate) using p65 antibody. 10% of the initial amount of chromatin used for one immuonprecipitation assay was used as input in each PCR. (C) SP1 binding to the MHC-I heavy chain ptomoter was again assayed by ChIP. Huh7 Cells were transfected with EGFP or full-length ORF2 expression plasmids and treated with LPS for 45 minutes prior to harvesting. PCR for MHC-I promoter regions was performed using primers mentioned above. Lane 5 shows ChIP from EGFP expressing cells immunoprecipitated with rabbit pre-immune serum. Lane 6 shows ChIP from mock immunoprecipitation using SP1 antibody. 10% of the initial amount of chromatin used for one immuonprecipitation assay was used as input in each PCR. (D) Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of IL-6 and IL-8 RNA level in Huh7 cells, treated as indicated. Values were normalized with respect to that of HPRT and represented as mean \u00b1 SEM.",
