            "text": "Oncogenic human papillomaviruses (HPV) are small DNA viruses that infect keratinocytes. After HPV binding to cell surface receptors, a cascade of molecular interactions mediates the infectious cellular internalization of virus particles. Aside from the virus itself, important molecular players involved in virus entry include the tetraspanin CD151 and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). To date, it is unknown how these components are coordinated in space and time. Here, we studied plasma membrane dynamics of CD151 and EGFR and the HPV16 capsid during the early phase of infection. We find that the proteinase ADAM17 activates the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2) pathway by the shedding of growth factors which triggers the formation of an endocytic entry platform. Infectious endocytic entry platforms carrying virus particles consist of two-fold larger CD151 domains containing the EGFR. Our finding clearly dissects initial virus binding from ADAM17-dependent assembly of a HPV/ CD151/EGFR entry platform.",

However, virus internalization is asynchronous and slow, with a halftime of several hours (Sapp and Bienkowska-Haba, 2009; Becker et al., 2018; Schelhaas et al., 2012) . The long halftime points toward a complex cascade of events at the cell membrane prior to virus entry into host cells. It is assumed that the sequence is initiated upon virus binding to a primary receptor, from which the virus is released in a modified form, followed by rebinding to a secondary receptor complex, which is then endocytosed (Ozbun, 2019; Raff et al., 2013; Mikulic\u02c7ic\u00b4and Florin, 2019) .",

            "text": "To date, the requirements for virus association with the secondary entry receptor and the composition of the receptor complex are not well understood. One of its main components is the tetraspanin CD151. It localizes to the cell surface, enriched in domains that associate with HPV16 particles (Spoden et al., 2008; Scheffer et al., 2013) . CD151 is essential for viral endocytosis (Spoden et al., 2008; Scheffer et al., 2013; Spoden et al., 2013; Scheffer et al., 2014; Fast et al., 2018) and cointernalizes with the virus via a clathrin-, caveolin-, and dynamin-independent endocytic pathway (Spoden et al., 2008; Spoden et al., 2013) . Integrin complexes (a6b1/b4) (Scheffer et al., 2013; Evander et al., 1997; McMillan et al., 1999) , the annexin A2 heterotetramer (Woodham et al., 2012; Dziduszko and Ozbun, 2013) , the cytoskeletal adaptor obscurin-like one protein (W\u00fcstenhagen et al., 2016) , and the tetraspanin CD63 (Spoden et al., 2008) are further components of the entry receptor complex. In addition, growth factor receptors (GFR), in particular the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), were proposed as entry receptors for HPV16 (Surviladze et al., 2012) and multiple other viruses such as vaccinia, cytomegalo, herpes simplex, influenza, and hepatitis C virus (Sch\u00e4fer et al., 2015) . Moreover, signal transduction like the activation of EGFR and ERK signaling is a prerequisite for HPV infection (Schelhaas et al., 2012; Surviladze et al., 2012) .",

            "text": "Infecting HaCaT keratinocytes with HPV16 pseudovirions (PsVs), we applied the broad-spectrum metalloproteinase inhibitor TAPI-0, the preferential ADAM10 inhibitor GI254023X (GI) and the mixed ADAM10/ADAM17 inhibitor GW280264X (GW) (Figure 1-figure supplement 1A) . TAPI-0 and GW diminished infection, whereas the ADAM10 inhibitor GI showed no significant effect. This is pointing toward a requirement of ADAMs, in particular of ADAM17 rather than ADAM10. To differentiate between these two ADAMs with a more specific approach, ADAM17 or ADAM10 were depleted by siRNA knockdown. For ADAM10 and ADAM17, respectively, two different siRNAs were employed in three epithelial cell models, including HeLa cells, HaCaT cells, and primary normal human epithelial keratinocytes (NHEK) . Under all conditions ADAM17 depletion consistently and strongly decreased infection ( Figure 1A -C). In contrast, ADAM10 depletion showed no clear effect (Figure 1 -figure supplement 1B-D). ADAM17 was also required for the infection by two other highly oncogenic HPV types, HPV18 and HPV31 ( Figure 1D ). Altogether, this indicates that ADAM17 is important for the infection with oncogenic human papillomaviruses. (B) HaCaT and (C) NHEK cells were treated with each one of two specific ADAM17 siRNAs and 48 hr later incubated with PsVs. Data obtained from HeLa cells (n = 9-10) were analyzed with two sample t-test: p=1.77E-12 (#1) and Welch two sample t-test: p=1.62E-09 (#2). HaCaT (n = 10); two-sample t-test: p=1.23E-07 (#1) and Welch two sample t-test: p=5.34E-10 (#2). NHEK (n = 8-13); Welch two sample t-test: p=1.07E-05 (#1) and p=7. 35E-06 (#2) . Upper panels, immunoblots for ADAM17 illustrating the efficiency of ADAM17 depletion (b-actin served as a loading control), whereas lower panels display the infection rate. Abbreviations: p and m indicate the premature and mature form of ADAM17, respectively. (D) HaCaT cells were depleted of ADAM17 applying a mixture of the two different pooled ADAM17-specific siRNAs (ADAM si) and 48 hr later infected with HPV16, HPV18 or HPV31 PsVs. Data for HPV16 (n = 9-10) and HPV31 (n = 10) were analyzed with two sample t-test: p=3.54E-11 and p=9.11E-16, respectively. Data for HPV18 (n = 10) with Welch two sample t-test: p=2.17E-10. (A)-(D) The values are given as mean \u00b1 SEM and the mean for control siRNA-treated cells (contr. si) was set to 100%. ADAM17-specific siRNAs have no effect on luciferase expression ( ADAM17 activity triggers the formation of a HPV16/CD151/EGFR platform The tetraspanin CD151 defines the entry receptor complex (Scheffer et al., 2013; Scheffer et al., 2014) . Therefore, we asked whether ADAM17 is required for the association of HPV16 with CD151. Prior to testing the role of ADAM17, we characterized the time course of virus colocalization with the entry receptor component CD151. HaCaTs were incubated with PsVs for 15 min, washed, and fixed or incubated up to several hours prior to fixation. Directly after virus incubation (marked as time point 0:00), we found virus particles associated with the cell surface, but they poorly overlapped with CD151-enriched domains (Figure 2-figure supplement 1) . One hour after adding PsVs (corresponds to time point 0:45), there was a moderate increase in CD151-L1 overlap that further increased in the next 2 hr, apparently plateauing after about 5 hr (Figure 2-figure supplement 1) . This is in line with our previous time course analyses of the CD151-L1 interaction on HeLa cells (Spoden et al., 2008) . This slow association of viral particles with CD151-enriched domains implies the idea of a slowly maturating HPV16 entry platform.",

Superresolution STED microscopy revealed a defined nanocluster pattern suggesting that larger CD151-enriched domains, as recorded by diffraction-limited microscopy, are in fact closely associated CD151 nanoclusters. The resolved nanocluster pattern enabled us to determine the distance between a bound viral particle to its next nearest CD151 nanocluster ( Figure 2A ). The average size of a CD151 cluster is roughly 200 nm (see Figure 4 ), and an HPV particle has a size of 55 nm (Baker et al., 1991) . Therefore, distances shorter than 150 nm allow for physical contact between a viral particle and a CD151 nanocluster. Interestingly, we uncovered a large fraction of PsVs in close proximity to CD151 nano-clusters already directly after virus binding. The fraction of such closely associated viral particles strongly increases over time (Figure 2A and B) . We cannot exclude that we underestimate the increase of this fraction due to preferential internalization of tight CD151-viral particle associates. Importantly, as well the CD151 brightness at the site of viral particle binding increases ( Figure 2C ), suggesting that the viral particle enriches CD151 in preparation of endocytosis.",

With TIRF microscopy, we studied the dynamics of viral particles and CD151. While viral particles were clearly immobile, CD151 moved fast ( Figure 2-figure supplement 2) . These observations are in line with previous reports showing HPV16 PsV confinement on the cell body (Schelhaas et al., 2008) and that CD81 tetraspanin clusters are stable only for a few seconds (Homsi et al., 2014) . We cannot exclude that in our CD151 tracking study, in which diffraction limited microscopy did not well resolve individual CD151 nanoclusters, we monitor larger intracellular vesicles. However, if viral particles are stationary and tetraspanins are mobile (Espenel et al., 2008) , platform maturation presumably involves CD151 nucleation at viral particle binding sites. The increase in CD151 intensity at PsVs binding sites ( Figure 2C ) illustrates this is a slow process that can take up to several hours.",

ADAM17 depletion reduced virus-CD151 overlap by roughly a third in HaCaTs or NHEK ( Figure 2D -F). The data reveals ADAM17-dependent spatial proximity between virus and CD151. Still, it is possible that viral particles and CD151 domains, although overlapping in the micrographs and exhibiting distances to each other below 150 nm, do not physically interact with each other. To corroborate spatial proximity with a better resolution, we turned to the Duolink proximity ligation assay (PLA) (Fredriksson et al., 2002; S\u00f6 derberg et al., 2006) . In the PLA bright fluorescent spots form at sites where two different molecular entities are closer than \u00bb 40 nm (Bagchi et al., 2015; Mendez and Banerjee, 2017) . Hence, in this assay fluorescent spots indicate sites at which viral particles and CD151 domains should indeed be close enough to interact physically. In the PLA, we found that the PLA signal was strongly dependent on ADAM17 ( Figure 2G and H) . Thus, the microscopic analysis and the PLA suggest that ADAM17 mediates close association between HPVs and CD151-enriched domains. This means that ADAM17 either is required for initial virus binding, or it plays a role somewhere between binding and endocytic platform formation, for example for L1 cleavage/priming by ADAM17 or another protease.",

Investigating the activity of ADAM17 (using TGF-a as positive control) and the cleavage pattern of the viral L1 protein (L1 priming), we find that L1 is neither a substrate for ADAM17 ( and F). Therefore, we speculate that ADAM17 activity is required for viral particle association with L1-priming proteases such as kallikrein-8 prior to endocytosis and additional proteases in intracellular compartments of the infectious entry pathway (Cerqueira et al., 2015) . Inhibition of these early steps on the plasma membrane rather leads to virus internalization into a non-infectious entry pathway as described earlier .",

PsVs reduced the cluster diameter to \u00bb 150 nm, which is accompanied by a \u00bb 25% reduction of the overall CD151 staining intensity ( Figure 4B and C). A reduction of the CD151 plasma membrane level after viral uptake is expected, as CD151 is co-internalized with viral particles (Scheffer et al., 2013) . Reduction of cluster diameter and CD151 level both require ADAM17 ( Figure 4B and C). Hence, the data indicate that only in the presence of ADAM17 PsVs-CD151 entities are efficiently endocytosed. The reduction from 210 to 150 nm may suggest an only modest difference in size. However, a reduction of the cluster diameter by a quarter corresponds to a halving of the area. Moreover, reduction of the diameter in conjunction with a diminished CD151 level suggests the preferential internalization of larger CD151 clusters. Thus, viral particles induce endocytic uptake of two-fold larger than average CD151 platforms.",

In the case that released viral particles require ADAM17 for being infectious, ADAM17 depletion in recipient cells should have no effect on their infection rate. However, we observed the opposite, infection in recipient cells was almost completely blocked ( Figure 5E , lower panel).

Hence, bioactive molecules are required for viral infection, no matter whether the viral particle is released and re-binds to the cell or not. The hypothesis on the involvement of released growth factors is supported by the observation that the non-ADAM17-depleted donor cells in the inverted assay configuration are significantly less infected when the corresponding recipient cells are ADAM17-depleted ( Figure 5E , upper panel). In contrast to one-directional diffusion of virus particles, bioactive compounds are exchanged in both directions, meaning that the donor cells sense less bioactive compounds when the recipient cells are ADAM17-depleted. However, the effect is small, suggesting that biomolecules rather act locally and do not diffuse over large distances. We further speculate that, although viral particles are released, they relatively fast rebind to cell surface receptors, explaining the large fraction of virus particles binding close to CD151 clusters already after 15 min ( Figure 2B ).",

Relative infection rates obtained for donor cells (n = 11-13) were analyzed using Welch two sample t-test: p=4.81E-04 and for recipients (n = 12) with two sample t-test: p=5.34E-04. (D) HaCaT cells were depleted of ADAM17 and 48 hr later incubated with HPV16 PsVs for 15 min. Next, the cells were thoroughly washed, incubated for another 4 hr, and finally L1 was assessed by western blot using L1-specific Ab 312F (upper panel). Shown is a percentage of the L1 band intensity and represents the amount of the total L1 protein in the supernatant (lower panel). Data (n = 7-8) were analyzed using Wilcoxon rank sum test: p=0.536. Detection of L1 and b-actin in the cell lysate served as controls. The values are given as mean \u00b1 SEM and the mean for control siRNA-treated cells (contr. si) was set to 100%. (E) Recipient cells were transfected with control or ADAM17 siRNA. After 48 hr siRNA-non-treated donor cells were allowed to bind PsVs for 1 hr, intensively washed, placed on top of siRNA-treated and PsVs-non-exposed recipient cells and incubated for another 24 hr. Data for donor cells (n = 12) were analyzed with two sample t-test: p=0.025 and for recipients (n = 11-12) with Welch two sample t-test: p=1.36E-07. For (C) and (E) infection rate of donor (upper panel) and recipient (lower panel) cells is displayed as a percentage. The values are given as mean \u00b1 SEM and the mean for control siRNA-treated cells was set to 100% for donors and recipients. Symbols: + and -denote presence or absence of ADAM17 protein or PsVs, respectively. HaCaT cells were pre-incubated with stated concentrations (mg/ml) of Cetuximab for 1 hr, infected with HPV16 PsVs and 24 hr later luciferase counts were measured. Samples (n = 8) were analyzed using two sample t-test: p=3.67E-08 (1 mg/ml), and Welch two sample t-test: p=4.42E-06 (10 mg/ml) and p=6.76E-07 (30 mg/ml). Infection rate is given as mean \u00b1 SEM and the mean for control-treated cells (contr.) was set to 100%. (B) HaCaT cells were depleted of ADAM17 for 48 hr. Next, cells were starved for 1 hr in medium without FCS, either left non-treated or treated with EGF (20 ng/ml) for 5 min, and incubated with HPV16 PsVs for 5 min. Western blots show phosphorylated and total ERK1 and 2 for the indicated conditions; a-tubulin was used as a loading control. (C) The amount of phosphorylated ERK1 (black) and ERK2 (gray) is shown as a ratio of phosphorylated to total ERK form. Data for ERK1 (n = 8-9) compared to the corresponding ERK1 of the contr. si were analyzed with two sample t-test: p=3.85E-08 (ADAM17 si) and Welch two sample t-test: p=1.73E-05 (ADAM17 si + EGF), and the difference between ADAM17 si and ADAM17 si + EGF: p=3.15E-06. Data for ERK2 (n = 9) Figure 6 continued on next page Horiuchi et al., 2007) . Both, AREG and TGF-a, were significantly reduced in the supernatant of ADAM17-depleted cells ( Figure 7A and B) , while HB-EGF was undetectable (not shown). Moreover, infection analyses showed that infection rates were significantly reduced when AREG or TGF-a neutralizing antibodies were added to the cells 1 hr before HPV16 PsVs addition ( Figure 7C ). These data verified the role of ADAM17 in the release of AREG and TGF-a and indicated a role of these growth factors in HPV16 PsVs infection. Finally, we mimicked ADAM17 activity in ADAM17-depleted cells by adding the ADAM17 cleavage products HB-EGF, AREG, and TGF-a ( Figure 7D-G) . Supplying the medium with these GFs restored ERK phosphorylation. Moreover, GF treatment increased infection rates in the absence as well as in the presence of ADAM17 in a concentration-dependent manner ( Figure 7F and G) . The beneficial effect on infection rates was observed when the cells were grown under starvation conditions (in medium without FCS) in the presence ( Figure 7F ) and in the absence of ADAM17 ( Figure 7G ). Infection was not further supported by the addition of GFs if the cells were treated with control siRNA in full medium (containing FCS) (Figure 7-figure supplement 1A) but was supported in ADAM17-depleted cells (Figure 7-figure supplement 1B) .",

Examining at nanoscale resolution the secondary entry receptor complex component CD151, briefly after binding, we find viral particles associated with CD151 clusters and over the next hours an enrichment of CD151 at the virus binding site. Because viral particles are almost immobile when attached to the cell body, as intensively investigated and discussed before (Schelhaas et al., 2008) , we suggest that CD151 is recruited to the virus binding site.

First, ADAM17 acts after virus primary binding/release, because infection is almost blocked in ADAM17-depleted recipient cells, receiving viral particles from control donor cells. The second observation is that ADAM17-depleted donor cells infect at a lesser extent their respective recipient cells, and in parallel, that control donor cells are less infected when recipient cells are ADAM17-depleted. This mutual influence is explained by an exchange of bioactive molecules between donor and recipient cells in both directions.

For example, EGF increases the infection rate of ADAM17-depleted cells, EGF increases the proximity between L1 and CD151 after ADAM17 knockdown, and ADAM17 knockdown diminishes the overlap between L1 and EGFR. However, EGF is not classically generated by the action of ADAM17 (Sahin et al., 2004; Horiuchi et al., 2007) . Therefore, we tested the involvement of additional EGFR ligands generated by ADAM17 ectodomain shedding. We find less AREG and TGF-a in the supernatant of ADAM17-depleted cells, corroborated by a reduction of the infection rate after treatment with AREG and TGF-a neutralizing antibodies. Adding ADAM17 cleavage products such as AREG, TGF-a, and HB-EGF to the supernatant of serum-starved or ADAM17-depleted cells increases ERK1/2 phosphorylation and infection. The effect of EGFR, AREG or TGF-a inhibition is much lower than that of the ADAM17 siRNA, therefore, we have to assume that ADAM17 activates not only the EGFR but also the additional GFRs.",

This hypothesis combines previously reported observations that ADAM17 activity regulates multiple cell signaling pathways by the release of bioactive proteins like EGFR ligands (Gooz, 2010; Sahin et al., 2004; G\u00f6 oz et al., 2006) and cell signaling plays a role in early events of HPV16 entry (Schelhaas et al., 2012; Surviladze et al., 2012; Surviladze et al., 2013; Abban and Meneses, 2010) . In line with our results, it has been shown by the Ozbun group that HPV16 particles associate with GFs like AREG or HB-EGF forming an infectious complex able to bind to the HPV16 entry receptor (Surviladze et al., 2012; Surviladze et al., 2015) . Due to the plethora of ADAM17 substrates (Gooz, 2010; Reiss and Saftig, 2009; Edwards et al., 2008) and the complex crosstalk between signaling pathways, also, ADAM17dependent shedding of additional membrane-bound precursors and cleavage of integral membrane proteins might be involved in this scenario.",

Accordingly, we observed a reduction of CD151 levels in the plasma membrane only in the presence of PsVs and ADAM17. Furthermore, we observed an ADAM17-dependent cleavage of the L1 protein. It has been described that L1 cleavage occurs by the action of specific proteases on the cell surface and after internalization via the infectious entry pathway (Cerqueira et al., 2015) . However, our findings suggest that ADAM17 has no direct effect on extra-or intracellular processing of the virus particle or virus internalization. Instead, affected L1 cleavage is a consequence of virus internalization into a non-infectious pathway and reduced capsid interaction with proteases resident within the entry platform complex or in the endosomal pathway. Thus, ADAM17 mediates virus association with the functional HPV-endocytic platform enabling host cell entry via the infectious pathway.",

This points toward a general scheme in viral uptake independent from the virus structure, further supported by the notion that tetraspanins stand for essential components of entry receptor complexes for corona-, influenza-, hepatitis C and other viruses (Zona et al., 2013; Earnest et al., 2015; Fast et al., 2017; Florin and Lang, 2018) .

Thus, clustering of cell factors might explain a more than two-fold increase in the CD151 microdomain size and internalization of the virus-associated entry platform. Furthermore, tetraspanin CD151 regulates integrin activities by influencing their positioning within tetraspanin-enriched microdomains (Berditchevski et al., 2001; Stipp, 2010; Yang et al., 2004) . Crowding of CD151 at the sites where virus particles are bound results in co-accumulation of additional virus interacting molecules, laminin and integrin complexes, which is in line with our previous analysis on CD151 mutants demonstrating the importance of CD151/integrin complex formation in HPV16 infection (Scheffer et al., 2013) .

            "text": "In summary, much work has been done to unveil the process of human papillomavirus entry. Although for this puzzling process diverse host cell factors and many steps have been proposed so far, the precise description still remains controversial. In order to deepen our understanding of these early steps of infection, we investigated the requirements for HPV16 entry platform formation. We propose a model in which ADAM17 acts by the shedding of growth factors. These molecules trigger ERK signaling activation and thereby mediate the co-clustering of preformed larger CD151-EGFR microdomains and HPV16 in the plasma membrane. These events lead to the assembly of a functional virus entry platform, priming of the HPV capsid proteins, endocytosis into the infectious pathway and eventually infection. Antibodies and plasmids HPV16 L1 mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAb) 16L1-312F and 33L1-7, as well as rabbit polyclonal antibody (pAb) K75 have been previously described (Knappe et al., 2007; Rommel et al., 2005; Sapp et al., 1994) . ADAM17-specific (AB19027) and ADAM10-specific (AB19026) rabbit pAb was purchased from Merck Millipore (Darmstadt, Germany). b-actin (A5441) and a-tubulin (B-5-1-2)-specific mouse mAbs were from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). CD151-specific mouse mAb (11G5a) was obtained from Bio-Rad (Munich, Germany). Rabbit monoclonal antibodies specific for EGFR (D38B1), total ERK1/2 (p44/42 MAPK; clone 137F5) and phosphorylated ERK (Phospho-p44/42 MAPK; clone D13.14.4E) were obtained from Cell Signaling (Leiden, Netherlands). Horseradish peroxidase-coupled (HRP and POD) secondary antibodies for immunoblot were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Europe Ltd. (Cambridgeshire, UK). Secondary antibodies for immunofluorescence detection on Zeiss Axiovert 200 M microscope (goat-derived Alexa Fluor 488, 546 and 647 antibodies) and for STED analyses [donkey anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 594 (cat# A21207) and donkey anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 647 (cat# A31571)] were from Molecular Probes (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).

Afterwards, HaCaTs were washed two times with PBS and incubated with DMEM without FCS and antibiotics but supplemented with 20 mg/ml of Proteinase K (Sigma-Aldrich) for 15 min at 37\u02daC in order to degrade viral particles still present on the cell surface. Control cells were treated with cell culture medium alone. Digestion was stopped by addition of 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). Subsequently, cells were washed with PBS, lyzed in SDS sample buffer and processed for western blot. Cytohalasin D (cytoD) was used as a control for blocked virus entry. CytoD prevents endocytosis by inhibiting actin polymerization.",

Two-color STED-microscopy was realized by sequential imaging of the two channels, using pulsed 561 nm and 640 nm lasers for the excitation of Alexa 594 and 647, respectively. For depletion, a pulsed 775 nm STED laser was used. Signals emitted from Alexa Fluor 594 and Alexa 647 dyes were detected using 580-630 nm and 650-720 filters, respectively. Depending on the experiment, pixel size was set to 15 nm for membrane sheets and 25 nm for cells. For all images, pinhole size was set to 60 mm. For the imaging of membrane sheets, the focal plane was adjusted slightly above and below the membrane sheet in order to check its two-dimensional structure briefly before imaging. This is possible because membrane sheets become immediately unfocussed when the focal plane is displaced in the z-axis, whereas cells or incompletely generated membrane sheets still show structural elements (Figure 4figure supplement 1).",

The Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) between two channels was calculated with a custom ImageJ macro. For analyzing maxima parameters (size, distances, intensity), a custom ImageJ macro was used. The macro is based on the ImageJ function 'Find Maxima' which is used to detect clusters or viral particles and gives their position in pixel coordinates. Prior to maxima detection, images were smoothed with a Gaussian blur (s = 1) to reduce false positive maxima due to noise. Cluster intensities were calculated by centering five pixel diameter circular ROIs onto the cluster positions. Cluster intensities were averaged for each cell. The exact cluster and PsV positions were determined by calculating the center of mass of fluorescence within the circular ROIs and used for further analysis. Maxima with low mean intensity (< 2 -5 a.u., depending on the experiment and channel) were excluded. Intensity measurements were corrected for local background measured next to the cell. For each PsV, the distances to the CD151 clusters were calculated, and the shortest distance was determined. In some cases, we found only a few PsVs per cell. Therefore, all PsV distances were averaged for one condition from one biological replicate (roughly 20 cells). The cluster size was determined by applying a horizontal and a vertical 3 \u00c2 31 pixels line scan centered at the cluster position. The linescans were fitted to a Gaussian yielding the full width at half maximum, which corresponds to the cluster size. Depending on the fit quality, either the value from the horizontal or vertical line scan was used. Clusters that have both fits with a R-square R 2 < 0.8 (centered peak) were excluded. The cluster size values for each membrane sheet were averaged. Measurements of the CD151 level were performed in the same ROIs as used for the cluster size analysis. Intensity measurements were corrected for local background measured next to the membrane sheets.",

The objects were tracked over a period of maximally 180 s with a time interval of 6 s between frames, yielding x-and y-positions of the objects over time. The mean-square displacement (MSD) was calculated like described previously (Lang et al., 2000) and plotted against the time intervals. For CD151 MSD versus time plot indicated unidirectional flow, which was ignored when determining the diffusion coefficient from a fitted linear regression line (D). The coefficient was calculated for each single track and an average diffusion coefficient was calculated. Five movies recorded by TIRF microscopy, published and described in Scheffer et al., were analyzed (for details of TIRF microscopy see Scheffer et al., 2013) .",
