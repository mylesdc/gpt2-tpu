            "text": "Humoral responses within the central nervous system (CNS) are common to many neurotropic viral infections, with antibody (Ab)-secreting cells (ASC) contributing to local protection. However, a role for virus-specific memory B cells (Bmem) within the CNS is poorly explored due to lack of robust phenotypic or functional identification in mice. This study takes advantage of the progeny of mice expressing tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase (Cre-ERT2) under the Aicda promoter crossed with Rosa26-loxP-tdTomato reporter mice (AID Cre -Rosa26 tdTomato ) to monitor B cells having undergone activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID)-mediated somatic hypermutation (SHM) following neurotropic coronavirus infection. AID detection via tdTomato expression allowed tracking of virus-specific ASC and Bmem in priming and effector sites throughout infection. In draining lymph nodes, tdTomatopositive (tdTomato \u03e9 ) ASC were most prevalent prior to germinal center (GC) formation, but total tdTomato \u03e9 B cells only peaked with robust GC formation at day 14 p.i. Moreover, their proportion of Bmem dominated over the proportion of ASC throughout infection. In the CNS, tdTomato \u03e9 cells started emerging at day 14 p.i. While they initially comprised mainly Bmem, the proportions of ASC and Bmem became similar as tdTomato \u03e9 B cells increased throughout viral persistence. Delayed tamoxifen treatment demonstrated ongoing CNS recruitment of tdTomato \u03e9 B cells, mainly ASC, primed late during GC reactions. Overall, the data support the idea that virus-induced B cells exhibiting SHM require peripheral GC formation to emerge in the CNS. Ongoing GC reactions and regional signals further regulate dynamics within the CNS, with preferential maintenance of tdTomato \u03e9 B cells in spinal cords relative to that in brains during viral persistence. IMPORTANCE The prevalence and role of antigen-specific Bmem in the CNS during viral encephalomyelitis is largely undefined. A lack of reliable markers identifying murine Bmem has made it difficult to assess their contribution to local antiviral protection via antigen presentation or conversion to ASC. Using reporter mice infected with neurotropic coronavirus to track virus-specific Bmem and ASC, this report demonstrates that both subsets only emerge in the CNS following peripheral GC formation and subsequently prevail. While early GC reactions supported preferential Bmem accumulation in the CNS, late GC reactions favored ASC accumulation, although Bmem outnumbered ASC in draining lymph nodes throughout infection. Importantly, virus-specific B cells undergoing sustained GC selection were continually recruited to the persistently infected CNS. Elucidating the factors governing temporal events within GCs, as well as regional CNS cues during viral persistence, will aid intervention to modulate CNS humoral responses in the context of infection and associated autoimmune pathologies.",

            "text": "N eurotropic viral infections are associated with the accumulation of multiple B cell subsets within the central nervous system (CNS) whose composition alters with time, indicating ongoing turnover and differentiation (1) (2) (3) . During infection with a gliatropic mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) derived from the JHM strain (JHMv2.2-1), IgDpositive (IgD \u03e9 ) (naive/transitional) B cells prevail early, but they decrease coincident with increasing proportions of CD138 \u03e9 antibody (Ab)-secreting cells (ASC) and CD138 \u03ea IgG \u03e9 isotype-switched memory B cells (Bmem) as germinal centers (GCs) are formed in draining lymph nodes (1, 2) . Whether the turnover in the CNS involves replacement by newly recruited B cells derived from the periphery or local expansion/differentiation of B cells recruited during acute infection is largely unresolved. While ASC in the blood are transiently migratory following antigen (Ag)-driven differentiation, Bmem recirculate for extended periods of time (4, 5) . This supports circulating Bmem as a potential replenishing source of ASC in the CNS during persistent infections. However, their contribution to humoral immunity in the CNS following infection or autoimmunity remains poorly characterized.",

In the first, Ag-activated B cells rapidly differentiate into short-lived ASC in extrafollicular foci (6) (7) (8) (9) . In the second pathway, B cells activated by Ag and receiving CD4 T cell help at the T cell-B cell follicle border form follicular GCs, where they undergo affinity maturation and isotype switching, ultimately generating Ag-specific Bmem, as well as long-lived IgG ASC. The generation of these IgG ASC and Bmem is significantly impaired in the absence of GCs (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) . GC reactions are marked by class-switched Ig and somatic hypermutation (SHM), thereby imprinting long-lived ASC and Bmem (15) (16) (17) (18) . These processes are both mediated by the enzyme activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), which introduces mutations in DNA by deaminating the cytidine base to create uracil. Uracil-DNA glycosylase and apurinic endonuclease then act to excise uracil, and the gaps are filled in by DNA repair mechanisms (12, 19, 20) . Based on its SHM-inducing activity, AID expression constitutes a B cell-specific marker of Ag-induced affinity maturation. While the vast majority of AID-dependent affinity maturation occurs within GCs, resulting in class-switching to IgG (21) , there is evidence for extrafollicular, GC-independent SHM resulting in the production of Ag-specific ASC and Abs, including those of the IgM isotype (12, 22) .",

Using the gliatropic MHV-JHMv2.2-1 variant, we have recently demonstrated that B cells in the CNS transition from a predominantly naive/early-activated IgD \u03e9 IgM \u03e9 population at day 7 p.i. to an IgD-negative (IgD \u03ea ) IgM \u03e9 and increasingly IgG \u03e9 population, including CD138 \u03e9 ASC, by day 21 p.i. (1, 2) . Moreover, the B cell coreceptor CD19, which lowers the Ag-specific activation threshold and promotes peripheral GC formation, is required for accumulation of CD138 \u03e9 ASC in the CNS (14) . These data suggested that the vast majority of plasmablasts and IgD \u03ea B cell subsets in the CNS have undergone SHM driven by viral Ag-specific B cell receptor (BCR) activation and do not comprise bystander B cells recruited via Ag-independent proinflammatory signals. However, identification of virus-specific ASC or Bmem generally depends on enzymelinked immunosorbent spot assay (ELISPOT) techniques using virus or viral lysates as the capture Ag, potentially underestimating their numbers. Measurement of virusspecific Bmem is especially biased by culture conditions, as B cells require nonspecific stimulation in vitro to convert into ASC for subsequent quantitation by ELISPOT (25, 26) .",

Analysis of humoral responses to protein Ag in AID Cre -Rosa26 EYFP mice confirmed that the vast majority of enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP)-expressing B cells were indeed specific for the immunizing Ag (4). These dually transgenic reporter mice are thus suitable tools to phenotypically monitor the dynamics and tissue distribution of B cells having undergone virus-induced, AID-mediated SHM. This study used the MHV-A59 strain, a neurotropic MHV that is less pathogenic than JHMv2.2-1, to determine the frequency, longevity, and distribution of virus-specific ASC and Bmem in the CLN and CNS of infected AID Cre -Rosa26 tdTomato mice using the CD19 \u03e9 tdTomato \u03e9 IgD \u03ea CD138 \u03e9 and the CD19 \u03e9 tdTomato \u03e9 IgD \u03ea CD138 \u03ea phenotype, respectfully. Tamoxifen administration at the onset of infection and throughout day 28 p.i. revealed that tdTomato \u03e9 B cells only accumulated in the CNS following peripheral GC formation and continued well into the chronic infection phase. Early GC-independent tdTomato \u03e9 ASC in the CLN did not appear to migrate to the CNS. Notably, an overall larger proportion of tdTomato \u03e9 B cells accumulated earlier and at higher frequencies in spinal cords than in brains. While Bmem dominated the tdTomato \u03e9 population in CLN throughout GC activity, they vastly exceeded ASC at early but not later stages of viral persistence. The administration of tamoxifen during chronic disease, starting at day 20 p.i., revealed that \u03f350% of ASC and \u03f325% of Bmem were recruited from later peripheral GC reactions by 28 days p.i., accounting for nearly the entire increase in virus-specific B cells observed in the CNS between days 21 and 28 p.i. Overall, the results show that the vast majority of ASC recruited to both the brain and spinal cord were virus specific, with limited accumulation of ASC with heterologous specificity. In contrast, the fraction of virus-specific cells within the Bmem population was substantially higher in spinal cords than in the brain. These data indicate that B cell subset accumulation during the persistent phase of infection is controlled by peripheral GC-driven events, as well as CNS regional signals.",

Following infection with gliatropic MHV-JHMv2.2-1, adaptive immune responses are initiated within CLN, consistent with lymphatic CNS drainage into this site (28) . Moreover, virus-specific ASC measured by ELISPOT peak at \u03f3day 14 p.i., coincident with defined anatomical GC formation in CLN (1, 29) . In contrast, the peak in total ASC monitored phenotypically precedes virus-specific ASC by \u03f37 days p.i. (23) . Importantly, both total and virus-specific ASC only start emerging in the CNS at day 14 p.i. and increase thereafter. We therefore questioned whether early ASC expansion is driven by Agindependent innate immune signaling, as previously shown for influenza virus and West Nile virus (WNV) infection (30, 31) , or whether it is Ag driven but insufficient to monitor via ELISPOT assay. AID Cre -Rosa26 tdTomato mice were thus treated with tamoxifen coincident with MHV-A59 inoculation to jointly track the emergence of tdTomato \u03e9 cells as a marker for Ag-primed Bmem (CD19 \u03e9 tdTomato \u03e9 IgD \u03ea CD138 \u03ea ) and ASC (CD19 \u03e9 tdTomato \u03e9 IgD \u03ea CD138 \u03e9 ) in CLN.

Evaluation of tdTomato expression within total IgD \u03ea CD138 \u03ea or CD138 \u03e9 cells indicated the vast majority were recently induced to express AID (Fig. 1C ).

            "text": "Having confirmed expansion of tdTomato \u03e9 B cells with a largely IgD \u03ea phenotype following virus CNS infection, we monitored tdTomato \u03e9 B cell subsets in CLN throughout acute infection (day 7 p.i.) into the persistent phase (days 14 to 28 p.i.). The proportion of tdTomato \u03e9 cells within total B cells was already increased at day 7 p.i. compared to that in naive mice, steadily rose to \u03f37% by day 21 p.i., and remained stable thereafter (Fig. 2) . The GL7 \u03e9 B cell fraction was not increased until day 14 p.i. and reached maximum levels of \u03f35% at day 21 p.i. (Fig. 2) . Moreover, the fraction of GL7 \u03e9 B cells expressing tdTomato increased to 80% by day 7 p.i. and plateaued at \u03f390% by day 14 p.i. (Fig. 2) . These data are consistent with the formation of well-defined GC at day 14 p.i. and segregation into structurally mature GC defined by dark-and light-zone domains by day 21 p.i. following infection with the JHMv2.2-1 virus variant (1). Moreover, the results confirmed AID-dependent SHM and class switch recombination (CSR), typical of GC B cells, and showed maintenance of GC activity out to day 28 p.i. during chronic infection. The increased proportion of GL7 \u03e9 cells by day 14 p.i., as well as their tdTomato expression, support the idea that induction of GL7 \u03e9 is specifically induced by viral Ag (Fig. 2 and 3 ). Contrasting with the progressively increasing proportions of tdTomato \u03e9 and GL7 \u03e9 cells after day 14 p.i., CD138 \u03e9 ASC proportions within CLN B cells peaked at day 7 p.i. (Fig. 2) , suggesting that they were largely GC independent. Moreover, the fraction of ASC rapidly declined and only slowly increased again by day 28 p.i. (Fig. 2 ), similar to previous results during MHV-JHMv2.2-1 infection (14, 23) . Surprisingly, however, 50% to 60% of ASC at day 7 p.i. were tdTomato \u03e9 , compared to \u03f35% in naive mice, and these percentages were sustained throughout day 28 p.i. (Fig. 2) . These results are consistent with virus-activated AID expression and SHM prior to robust GC formation. However, it could not be discerned whether tdTomato \u03e9 ASC at later times comprised a distinct or more differentiated GC-derived subset. Importantly, the kinetics of IgD \u03ea CD138 \u03ea Bmem did not mirror those observed for ASC. Total Bmem did not show increased frequencies within CD19 \u03e9 CLN B cells in infected compared to naive mice until day 21 p.i. (Fig. 2 ). Bmem and ASC exhibited similar fractions of tdTomato \u03e9 cells in naive CLN (\u03f37%). However, unlike ASC, Bmem did not demonstrate a rapid increase in the frequency of tdTomato \u03e9 cells at day 7 p.i. Despite this initial divergence, the tdTomato \u03e9 fraction in Bmem increased to \u03f350% at day 14 p.i. and remained stable out to day 28 p.i. (Fig. 2 ). The production of Ag-primed ASC and Bmem thus displayed discrete kinetics in CLN following MHV infection. Finally, while the fraction of tdTomato \u03e9 cells in phenotypically naive IgD \u03e9 cells increased by day 14 p.i. and remained elevated compared to that in naive mice, it remained \u03fd4%, suggesting rapid differentiation into IgD \u03ea memory cells ( Fig. 2) (1). Figure 3 provides an overview of the temporal kinetics of absolute numbers of tdTomato \u03e9 cells relative to those of GL7 \u03e9 GC B cells, CD138 \u03e9 ASC, and IgD \u03ea CD138 \u03ea Bmem throughout infection. Total CD19 \u03e9 B cells were stable throughout day 14 p.i. and decreased thereafter, reflecting overall decreased cellularity of CLN following intracranial (i.c.) MHV infection. Although the percentages of tdTomato \u03e9 B cells slowly in- creased throughout days 7 to 21 p.i. (Fig. 2) , the absolute numbers of tdTomato \u03e9 cells were most abundant at day 14 p.i., reflecting peak total CD19 \u03e9 cells (Fig. 3A) . The numbers of GL7 \u03e9 B cells, with the vast majority being tdTomato \u03e9 , mirrored the kinetics of GC formation (1). Total ASC peaked at day 7 p.i. (\u03f32.0 \u03eb 10 4 ), prior to maximal GL7 \u03e9 B cells (\u03f38.0 \u03eb 10 4 ), reflecting peak CD138 \u03e9 percentages within the B cell population. By day 28 p.i., ASC declined rapidly, reaching only \u03f32 \u03eb 10 3 (Fig. 3A) . The high proportion (\u03f365%) of ASC expressing tdTomato at day 7 p.i. thus surpassed AIDexpressing ASC numbers during maximal GC differentiation after day 14 p.i. (Fig. 3A) . These early ASC are consistent with a population of largely GC-independent, IgM \u03e9 , long-lived ASC, which have been described to exhibit AID-dependent affinity maturation in other models (12) .",

The decrease in tdTomato \u03e9 Bmem supports the notion of egress into circulation following peak GC formation. Interestingly, the dynamics of tdTomato \u03e9 Bmem in the CLN closely resemble those of GL7 \u03e9 GC B cells, suggesting a relatively constant production of Ag-primed Bmem throughout the formation and contraction of GCs (Fig. 3A) . However, as was the case with ASC, it remains unclear whether the tdTomato \u03e9 Bmem are more differentiated or exhibit increased affinity.

At day 7 p.i., AID Cre -Rosa26 tdTomato mice already exhibited small foci of tdTomato \u03e9 B cells within follicles, indicative of early GC formation. tdTomato \u03e9 B cells were also evident at extrafollicular locations, consistent with GCindependent expansion of tdTomato \u03e9 ASC (Fig. 4) . By day 14 p.i., tdTomato \u03e9 B cells formed large foci typical of GC morphology within follicles; these structures were maintained through day 21 p.i. (Fig. 4 ) and day 28 p.i. (data not shown). Overall, these kinetics of GC formation are similar to those of infection with MHV-JHM2.2v-1 (1). Moreover, although tdTomato \u03e9 ASC and Bmem (Fig. 3B) had already emerged at day 7 p.i., the maximum GL7 \u03e9 tdTomato \u03e9 populations nevertheless coincided with mature GC formation (Fig. 3) , suggesting that the vast majority of virus-specific B cells were GC derived.",

CD138 \u03e9 ASC started to accumulate at day 14 p.i. and increased progressively out to day 28 p.i. in both brains and spinal cords ( Fig. 5 and 6) . Furthermore, the percentage of tdTomato \u03e9 cells within ASC increased more extensively within spinal cords than in brains, reaching \u03f398% compared to \u03f370%, respectively, by day 28 p.i. (Fig. 5A and 6 ). IgD \u03ea CD138 \u03ea Bmem numbers in brains and spinal cords remained unaltered or even decreased compared to the numbers in naive mice during acute infection out to day 14 p.i. Brains only showed a marginal increase in Bmem at day 21 and more significant elevation by day 28 p.i. However, the relative proportion of tdTomato \u03e9 cells remained \u03fd20% (Fig. 5A) . In contrast, IgD \u03ea CD138 \u03ea Bmem in spinal cords were significantly elevated at day 21 p.i. and reached 6-fold-higher levels than in naive mice by day 28 p.i.

The differences in the proportions of tdTomato \u03e9 B cells were thus much more pronounced in Bmem than in ASC when comparing brain and spinal cord populations. These data suggested that viral-Ag-experienced, GC-derived B cells accumulated preferentially in spinal cords, potentially outcompeting bystander or less differentiated B cells.

Histological evaluation of spinal cords for tdTomato \u03e9 cells at day 21 p.i. supported prominent localization to white matter tracks , determined by unpaired t test, are denoted as follows, with asterisks in red or black denoting significant differences in the tdTomato \u03e9 or total population, respectively: *, P \u03fd 0.05; **, P \u03fd 0.01; ***, P \u03fd 0.001. (Fig. 7) . Moreover, tdTomato \u03e9 cells were not associated with laminin-positive areas marking perivascular matrix and were found in select areas of the spinal cord, where they exhibited a scattered distribution; tdTomato \u03e9 cell clusters were very rare. Virus-specific B cells were continually recruited to the infected CNS. The data described above demonstrated that virus-specific tdTomato \u03e9 B cells progressively (4), we monitored Aicda mRNA levels in CLN relative to the levels in brains and spinal cords throughout infection (Fig. 8) . Ighg mRNA levels were assessed as a measure of ASC IgG secretion (2) . In CLN, Aicda mRNA levels increased between days 5 and 7 p.i. and were further elevated by day 21 p.i., corresponding with GC formation. In contrast, although a statistically significant increase in Aicda mRNA was evident in brains and spinal cords at day 14 p.i., the levels were overall \u03f34 orders of magnitude (10 4 ) lower than in CLN. Ighg mRNA levels increased prominently in CLN by day 14 p.i., reflecting GC-matured ASC. In the CNS, Ighg mRNA levels also did not increase significantly until day 14 p.i., and the levels increased further by day 21 p.i. Moreover, the levels were \u03f310-fold higher in spinal cords than in brains, consistent with higher IgG secretion. These mRNA kinetics were similar to those in MHV-JHMv2.2-1-infected mice (2) . While Ighg mRNA levels were overall lower in the CNS than in CLN, the \u03f3100-fold-higher ratio of Aicda relative to Ighg mRNA levels in CLN versus spinal cords (\u03f31 \u03eb 10 \u03ea3 versus 5 \u03eb 10 \u03ea5 , respectively) confirmed minimal local AID activity in the CNS.",

Any accumulation of tdTomato \u03e9 B cells in the CNS after day 20 p.i. would imply that these cells were derived from protracted peripheral GC reactions sustained during the chronic phase. CLN, brain, and spinal cord cells were thus assessed for the presence of tdTomato \u03e9 ASC and Bmem cells by flow cytometry 8 days after initial tamoxifen administration (day 28 p.i.). Slightly reduced frequencies of tdTomato \u03e9 B cells within total CD19 \u03e9 B cells in CLN in mice receiving tamoxifen starting at day 20 p.i. compared to those starting at day 0 p.i. did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 9) . Furthermore, mice receiving tamoxifen treatment at day 20 p.i. revealed a frequency of \u03f330% tdTomato \u03e9 cells in the CD138 \u03e9 ASC population, similar to the frequency in mice receiving tamoxifen continuously from day 0 p.i.

This early, GC-independent, tdTomato \u03e9 population was comprised of similar proportions of CD138 \u03e9 ASC and IgD \u03ea CD138 \u03ea Bmem. Moreover, CD138 \u03e9 tdTomato \u03e9 ASC peaked at day 7 p.i., accounting for \u03f365% of total ASC. While the early expansion of ASC prior to GC formation confirmed results in Blimp-GFP mice infected with the more pathogenic, sublethal MHV-JHMv2.2-1 variant (23), these ASC were previously interpreted to result from innate bystander activation, as they were undetectable in virus-specific ELISPOT assays (14) . However, their high frequency of tdTomato expression indicates that these ASC are viral Ag specific but produce Ab with insufficient affinity to be detected by virus-specific ELISPOT. This notion is supported by MHV-JHMv2.2-1 infection of CD19-deficient mice (14) , in which a significant reduction in early ASC within CLN at day 7 p.i. was consistent with the function of CD19 to lower the Ag-driven B cell activation threshold. Interestingly, somatic mutations introduced by AID may not be viral Ag selected but may still be specific, as previously reported in a subset of long-lived, GC-independent, IgM-secreting ASC induced by vaccination or peripheral infection (12) . Nevertheless, independent of SHM evident at day 7 p.i., these ASC do not appear to be migration competent, as tdTomato \u03e9 ASC do not emerge in the CNS until day 14 p.i. Irrespective of migration capacity, these results are consistent with preferential retention of Ag-induced, long-lived IgM ASC in the spleen following peripheral immunization or infection (12) . While small numbers of tdTomato \u03e9 B cells emerged in the CNS during acute infection, their CNS accumulation accelerated substantially out to day 28 p.i. following the formation of peripheral GCs at day 14 p.i. Mature GCs in CLN were sustained out to at least day 28 p.i. (data not shown), but tdTomato \u03e9 B cell numbers declined after day 14 p.i., consistent with the death of low-affinity clones during ongoing affinity maturation and/or egress from lymphoid tissue into circulation. The progressive increase in tdTomato \u03e9 B cells in the CNS thus supported the idea of ongoing egress of GC-matured B cells from CLN and subsequent migration to the persistently infected CNS. Overall, these results suggested that GCs are important for licensing migration of Ag-specific B cells to sites of inflammation. The idea of imprinting of migratory capacity by GCs was supported by the increasing percentages of tdTomato \u03e9 cells within the ASC and Bmem populations, which ultimately represented a majority within both subsets. However, a lower proportion of tdTomato \u03e9 cells within Bmem in brains compared to the proportion in spinal cords suggests that additional events dictated by the regional CNS environment control the recruitment or survival of Ag-specific B cells. Overall, the preferential accumulation of tdTomato \u03e9 B cells throughout persistence demonstrated that recently activated B cells display enhanced CNS migratory capacity compared to that of preexisting, non-MHV-specific ASC or Bmem with heterologous specificity.",

Moreover, the vast majority of GL7 \u03e9 cells were tdTomato \u03e9 at day 7 p.i, indicative of an activated pre-GC phenotype. Similar to GC-independent, IgM-secreting ASC with Ag-induced SHM (12) , GC-independent, unswitched as well as switched Bmem have also been described during the early primary response to R-phycoerythrin (R-PE) immunization (33) .

The steadily increasing proportion of ASC in the CNS by day 28 p.i. suggested more efficient CLN egress and/or migration of ASC than of Bmem during ongoing GC reactions. These findings are overall consistent with a temporal switch observed in the output of GCs following model Ag immunization: GCs are initially dedicated to generating Bmem and only switch to ASC output after peak Bmem expansion (35) . However, limiting viral Ag in CLN during persistence may reduce ASC over Bmem output in CLN. Nevertheless, the progressive ASC emergence relative to that of Bmem in the CNS over time supports the notion that early GC reactions are dedicated to preferential production of Bmem with the capacity to migrate to the CNS.",

Analysis of B cells 8 days later revealed that \u03f320% of tdTomato \u03e9 B cells were derived from B cells initiating AIDdriven tdTomato expression after day 20 p.i. Their derivation from the periphery was supported by similar percentages of tdTomato \u03e9 cells within total CD19 \u03e9 B cells, GL7 \u03e9 B cells, and CD138 \u03e9 ASC at day 28 p.i., independent of the administration of tamoxifen throughout acute infection or starting at day 20 p.i. Whether these tdTomato \u03e9 B cells are derived from cells already expressing AID and undergoing further affinity maturation after day 20 p.i. or from newly primed B cells recruited to GCs remains to be determined. Nevertheless, the less prominent reductions of tdTomato \u03e9 cells in ASC compared to the reductions in Bmem in both brains and spinal cords following late compared to early tamoxifen treatment is consistent with the notion that ongoing recruitment primarily involves ASC still undergoing SHM after day 20 p.i. These data are also consistent with preferential output of migratory ASC by day 28 p.i. We have excluded de novo AID expression within the CNS based on previous analysis of mRNA transcript levels from IgD \u03ea CD138 \u03ea Bmem and CD138 \u03e9 ASC isolated from the CNS at 21 days p.i. (2) , as well as IgD \u03e9 B cells at day 7 p.i. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude the possibility that the relative increase in ASC over Bmem in the CNS may also be driven by local conversion of Bmem into ASC by persistent viral Ag, ongoing pattern recognition receptor mediation, or cytokine stimulation.",

            "text": "Overall, our data demonstrate for the first time that virus-specific B cells exhibiting SHM only emerge in the CNS following peripheral GC formation. Moreover, the accumulation of ASC and Bmem appears to be regulated by temporal events within GCs, as well as CNS regional cues during viral persistence. While early GC reactions supported preferential Bmem accumulation in the CNS, late GC reactions preferentially mediated ASC migration to the CNS. Importantly, virus-specific B cells expressing AID in peripheral GCs sustained during CNS viral persistence are continually recruited to the chronically infected CNS. While these data do not support involvement of bystander recruitment of preexisting Bmem or ASC with irrelevant specificity to CNS inflammation, they do predict that sustained GC reactivity may recruit de novo B cell activation to Ags released from damaged tissue. Such B cells may thus give rise to autoreactive Abs or promote autoreactive T cells, as recently demonstrated in multiple sclerosis (42) .",
