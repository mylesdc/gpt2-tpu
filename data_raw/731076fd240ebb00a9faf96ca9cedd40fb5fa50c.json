Contributing factors include nonspecific clinical presentation, lack of local advanced diagnostic capabilities and suboptimal infection prevention and control (IPC) practices, amplified by poor surveillance in struggling health systems. The epidemiological pattern of the 2014-2016 EVD outbreak in West Africa revealed a similar story, but this time with an unprecedented scale and geographic spread, resulting in a record number of affected health workers, with 881 cases and 513 deaths by late 2015 4 . Health workers are more likely than non-health workers to be infected: depending on the profession, the risk can be 21 to 32 times higher 5 .",

As the United Nations' international health agency, the World Health Organization (WHO) has the mandate to support Member States in preparing for and responding to a wide range of public health emergencies that often require that new technical guidance is developed in short timelines with scarce evidence base. Following an urgent request from affected Member States, WHO started the production of a PPE guideline for EVD outbreaks in July 2014, shortly before declaring the EVD outbreak in West Africa a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.",

It became clear very early in the process that high quality efficacy and comparative effectiveness studies addressing the use of specific PPE items for EVD in outbreak settings were lacking 8 . In addition to the paucity of data, it was critically important to gather and include the perspectives of health workers who had \"real-life\" experience in ETUs in West Africa. Early reports of the local conditions indicated that broader clinical questions than PPE performance as a transmission barrier were as important: usability, comfort, dexterity and impact on communication with patients, for example. The underlying principle was that evidence from efficacy and comparative effectiveness studies was necessary but insufficient for contextualization and adequate decision-making. This approach highlights the importance of understanding the way individuals exercise judgement (values and preferences) when selecting options with potential benefits, harms, and inconveniences in real life and is current best-practice in WHO standard guidelines 9 . Values and preferences are often informed mainly by the opinion of guideline expert panel members, however such proxies for persons affected by the recommendations in a guideline are often inadequate or even inaccurate. Thus, in the early stages of the 2014-2016 EVD outbreak in West Africa, in the context of time constraints and the absence of published data, it was crucial to incorporate the values and preferences of health workers into the guideline development process.",

We used maximum variation purposeful sampling, a non-probability sampling strategy, to capture a wide range of health worker perspectives and experiences in two organizations and four different countries affected by the EVD outbreak. Health workers were reached through a contact individual in each organization (MSF and WHO) who directly emailed potential participants. Physicians and nurses from the affected countries and from other international organizations were not included for pragmatic reasons given the extreme time constraints and infeasibility of obtaining additional organizational approvals in the available timeline.

With this approach, clinical and public health recommendations are based on a systematic review and critical appraisal of the evidence on benefits and harms of an intervention, and an assessment of the balance between the two. Other considerations are also taken into account when an expert panel formulates recommendations, including feasibility, acceptability and resource implications of the intervention options, and the effects on equity across subpopulations. The relative value of the potential outcomes of the intervention options and the values and preferences of persons affected by the intervention are also important considerations. The findings of the survey were presented at the guideline development meeting and incorporated into evidence-to-decision tables (Supplementary File 2) to inform the formulation of recommendations for PPE components in the context of an EVD outbreak. Evidence-to-decision tables followed the GRADE-DECIDE 11 approach and were populated by the WHO guideline development team in preparation for the expert panel meeting. These tables were key instruments used to present multiple sources of information to the guideline expert panel, helping to structure the discussion and to document the final judgements and decisions that underpin each recommendation.",

Other participants also attempted to solve this problem by taping gloves to the coverall, however this occasionally resulted in the tearing of gloves or the coverall. It was also mentioned that gloves were not long enough and that they tore easily. Difficulties included finding the right size coverall -in several instances the available coveralls were too small, leaving the health worker to opt for a coverall of lesser quality or have difficulties removing the coverall. A number of health workers indicated that they had difficulty taking off the coverall. Specific issues included having to remove the face shield first, leaving the eyes and face unprotected while undressing from the coverall, and problems taking off the coverall over large rubber boots. One respondent mentioned that coveralls with attached shoe covers could increase the risk of tripping. One respondent commented that boots were too big causing difficulty walking on irregular ground.

These interactions highlighted differences in the selection and use of PPE across the organizations. Early on in the outbreak, when the cases of health worker transmission were numerous and confusion about the best available equipment was wide-spread, WHO was asked to provide technical guidance in a short period of time. When a public health emergency involves a new disease, or a known disease with a different presentation, there may be scarce or no evidence on the benefits and harms of potential interventions. Indirect evidence (e.g., from related diseases such as other blood-borne pathogens and simulation), expert opinion, and data acquired and analysed in real-time may become the best available evidence for the guideline panel. In addition, factors other than the effectiveness of interventions may have a significant influence on the direction and strength of the recommendations. Such was the situation in 2014 during the height of the EVD outbreak in West Africa; a rapid review of the effectiveness of different types of PPE for protecting health workers revealed insufficient evidence upon which to draw conclusions about optimal PPE 8 .",

Health workers accept a certain degree of discomfort in return for the protection provided by PPE. The survey highlighted a slight preference of health workers for face shields compared to goggles because of less fogging, easier communication and better fit. There was no strong preference for one item of PPE over the other for all other PPE components. Given the variation in preferences for different components of PPE and the absence of data on comparative effectiveness, it may be important to provide a choice for health workers. This was, in fact, a guiding principle during the development of the PPE guidelines. Several issues raised by survey participants should be relatively straightforward to address, making a major contribution to health worker safety and comfort, such as providing a sufficient range of sizes, choice of equipment, and adequate training on how to put on and take off PPE in the conditions that will be faced in the field. Active training, in which health workers receive face-to-face training has been shown to improve doffing procedures 13 .",

Although this likely had a minimal impact on the results, we noted two questions that participants appeared to have difficulty comprehending (questions 11 and 23; see Supplementary File 1); if we had had more time for field testing we could have revised the questionnaire before formal data collection began. While our aim was to include only health workers who had provided direct patient care, such as nurses and physicians, given a communication error early in the study, we invited to participate and consequently received responses from workers without direct clinical experience who had been deployed to the EVD outbreak. Because these workers were not part of our pre-defined sampling frame, we excluded their responses from the analysis. Similarly, our survey failed to take into account the fact that PPE consists of different components such as eye protection, nose and mouth protection, gloves and body coverings that work together to protect the health worker from the risk of infection. In the first part of our questionnaire we asked how the survey participant experienced individual components of PPE (e.g., goggles or face mask). However, it is difficult to review these components as isolated items, separate from the rest of the PPE. As one survey participant noted: \"It is the combination of the respirator and the face shield which is difficult. One or the other would be manageable but both together meant major impairment\". Another survey participant commented: \"The coverall would probably be better tolerated if we could breathe easier and see without problems\". In addition, although we compared gowns and coveralls, we did not specify or ask about the materials the body coverings were made of, its level of fluid resistance, or whether the head cover was attached or not. Such issues can have a significant impact on health workers' experiences. For example, a simulation study carried out in Hong Kong in response to the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) found that PPE made of more breathable material did not lead to a significant difference in contamination but did have greater user satisfaction 13,14 . It also became clear that solutions to an issue with one component of PPE could compromise the safety of another element of PPE. For example, participants mentioned that they would improvise and tape gloves to the coverall in order to prevent them from slipping down, but then the coverall would tear when removing the tape. Finally, the combination of different components of PPE may change the order in which PPE items are put on and taken off, thus end-users may perform donning and doffing procedures that are different than the training they received. This is particularly relevant if there are frequent changes in the availability of specific types of PPE, as was the case early in the outbreak response.",

This was in and of itself an invaluable learning experience for undertaking similar projects in the future. Specifically, we had to include only international health workers deployed by WHO and MSF in our study; therefore, we did not collect information on the values and preferences of local health workers and health workers deployed by other organizations. There were two important reasons as to why we selected our sampling frame. First, we carried out the survey at the height of the EVD epidemic when local doctors and nurses were fully engaged in the response efforts and we refrained from removing them from their primary work. Internationally recruited health workers on the other hand, were usually deployed for shorter periods and could thus participate when they returned home. Second, we had little time in which to execute the survey before the guideline meeting and we anticipated that it would be a lengthier and more complex process to identify and recruit local health workers. Thus, the findings of this survey may not be applicable to local health workers. In addition, generalizability of our findings to other international health workers involved in the Ebola response may be limited due to the small size of our purposive sample.",
