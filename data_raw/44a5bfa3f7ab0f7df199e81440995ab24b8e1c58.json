Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) were obtained and viral respiratory pathogens were identified using reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR). Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) load was assessed using quantitative RT-PCR. NPA and plasma leptin level were measured. Clinical data and nutritional status were recorded, and patients were followed up until hospital discharge. Viral coinfection was defined as the presence of two or more viruses detected in the same respiratory sample. Severity of illness was determined by length of hospitalization and duration of oxygen therapy.",

Patients were selected based on following inclusion criteria: children <24 months old that were hospitalized for ALRI at two medical centers in Santiago, Chile: Urgencia Materno-Infantil at Cl\u00ednica D\u00e1vila and Dr. Exequiel Gonz\u00e1lez Cort\u00e9s Hospital. Patients were classified as having bronchiolitis, bronchitis or pneumonia. Diagnoses were made in patients with dyspnea, signs of lower respiratory tract infections (wheezing, retractions) and/or a positive chest x-ray (infiltrates, atelectasis and air trapping). The clinical and demographic characteristics of each patient were also recorded. The exclusion criteria were: children with nutritional risk and/or undernourished children, newborns <28 days old, patients with a diagnosis of recurrent wheezing, previous hospitalization for any cause, primary or secondary immunodeficiency, gestational age of <37 weeks, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, previous mechanical ventilation, congenital heart disease, respiratory infection during the previous 2 weeks, corticosteroid intake 72 h before sample was taken, and children with negative samples for respiratory viruses. Figure S1 shows exclusion criteria. Children were classified into three groups according to their nutritional status (NS) using WHO Anthro 2011 v.3.2.2 program: normal weight, overweight, and obese. NS was determined by z-scores according to the following anthropometric indicators: weight-for-age z-scores, length or height-for-age z-scores, and weight-for-height z-scores. Normal weight was defined as \u22120.9 to 0.9 SD, overweight as 1.0 to \u22642.0 SD and obese as >2 SD. Undernourished children and those with nutritional risk were defined with a weight-forage z-score and weight-for-height z-score of <1 SD, below the mean, and were therefore excluded from the study. The weight of each patient was measured at hospital admission. Disease severity was assessed by using the standard criteria of length of hospitalization and duration of treatment with supplemental oxygen (18, 19) .",

Some previous studies have examined the impact of nutritional status on respiratory infections in children. Similar to our results, Rivera-Claros et al. concluded that obesity is a risk factor for worse clinical course of acute lower respiratory tract infections in Chilean infants with RSV infections and without chronic disease (9) . A study of 1,129 Polish children found that overweight children had a higher risk for acute upper respiratory tract infections (22) . Another observational study of 1,116 children hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia in the United States, found that overweight or obese children were more likely to be admitted to the ICU (23).

It is described that the adipose tissue acts as an endocrine organ, producing adipokines that exert immunomodulatory effects. Leptin is a pro-inflammatory adipokine produced primarily in adipose tissue that increases in proportion to the body adiposity. The primary function of leptin is the control of appetite via the hypothalamus, and it has been established as a key hormone in deregulation of immune responses in obese patients (24) . Teran-Cabanillas et al. (13) showed that leptin induces SOCS3 overexpression which leads to reduced type I IFN production in obese patients. Downstream in the route of type I IFNs, the antiviral 2 \u2032 -5 \u2032 -oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1) gene is also activated via JAK-STAT. We analyzed a small number of samples available for expression of OAS1 gene. Despite not finding significant differences, we found a tendency to decrease the expression of the OAS1 gene in overweight and obese patients compared to normal weight children (Data not shown). Some studies have related leptin level with hepatitis virus infection. In the study by Caner et al. (25) leptin levels were found unaltered in children with acute hepatitis A. However, T\u00f3th et al. (26) showed an association between the changes of serum leptin levels in children and the severity of hepatitis disease. It remains to be determined whether the infection by respiratory viruses affects leptin levels.",

We found that children <6 months showed higher plasma leptin level than older children, regardless of nutritional status (5.26 vs. 1.29 ng/\u00b5l; p < 0.0001). Most of children <6 months (69%) were exclusive breastfeeding at the time of sampling. Savino et al. (27) observed a positive association of breast milk leptin values not only with maternal body mass index but also with maternal and infant serum leptin values. On the other hand, it has been described that infants have an increased risk of obesity later in life if they have an overweight or obese mother (28) which can be reduced with the use of lowprotein feedings after 3 months (29) . Chile has one of the highest prevalence rates of overweight and obesity in Latin America (30) . Overweight has 39% prevalence and obesity has 29%; 51% of women in reproductive age have a state of overnutrition (31). According to this, we speculate that the excess weight of mothers causes an increase of leptin in children under 6 months who receive breastfeeding, and this could have an impact on the severity of viral infections. Therefore, further studies are needed to study the effect of breast milk leptin in infants.",

            "text": "Here, we have shown for the first time to our knowledge, that obesity and overweight conditions are associated with viral coinfections in children hospitalized for LRTIs. Although it is still unclear why this is so, there is some evidence that can start to shed light on this association. It has been reported that the erythrocyte membrane responds very early to modifications of plasma lipoproteins and suggest that in childhood obesity a modified transfer of cholesterol from plasma to erythrocyte membrane may take place (16) . Several viruses use cholesterolrich microdomains (lipid rafts) to infect host cells (32) (33) (34) , as has been shown in influenza virus infections. Influenza A virus rafts serve as a site for concentrating viral proteins and promoting the re-production of infectious viruses (35) . Moreover, it has been reported that RSV uses lipid rafts in the plasma membrane as attachment platforms to enter normal human bronchial epithelial cells (36) . According to this, it is possible that the membrane composition of the respiratory tract cells of children with overnutrition is modified in a way that favors the entry of respiratory viruses. It has long been known that coinfections exhibit a phenomenon called viral interference, where one virus blocks the growth of another (37), thus the high frequency of simultaneous respiratory infections in obese and overweight patients is somewhat surprising and needs further study. Consequently, we believe that overnutrition in children could alter the composition of cholesterol in the membrane of the respiratory epithelial tissue, facilitating the entry of viruses in different cells, which could explain the results obtained in this study. An inadequate immune response might also allow a greater entry of these pathogens. Obesity provokes an imbalance in the immune system, including an aberrant type I interferon response, which are the key cytokines involved in the early immune response to viral infections (38) . The increase in coinfection related to obesity and overweight conditions may have additional health effects. It was recently reported that asthma in children between 6 and 8 years old is more frequent and severe in those that have been previously hospitalized with viral coinfection-bronchiolitis, compared to those with single infections (39) . The long-term effects of metabolic changes caused by early onset obesity must be explored in followup studies.",

Through a mathematical model, HRV, the fastestgrowing virus, reduces the replication of the remaining viruses during a coinfection, while PIV, the slowest-growing virus is suppressed in the presence of other viruses (40). According to this, coinfections could limit the increase of RSV load because of competition for resources with other viruses. These results are in agreement with those previously described by Garcia-Mauri\u00f1o (41) , where high viral load was associated with less severe RSV in children.",
