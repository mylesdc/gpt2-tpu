We investigated the underlying mechanism on the inhibition of atopic dermatitis (AD) of an ethanol extract of SR (ESR) using 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene-(DNCB-) induced AD mice model. Oral administration of ESR significantly suppressed DNCB-induced AD-like symptoms such as scratching behavior, ear thickness, epidermal thickness, and IgE levels. To investigate the effects of ESR treatment on degranulation of IgE/Ag-activated mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs), we measured the release of -hexosaminidase ( -HEX, degranulation marker). ESR decreased the infiltration of eosinophils and mast cells into the AD skin lesions. Furthermore, ESR significantly inhibited degranulation of IgE/Ag-activated BMMCs. We have demonstrated that ESR decreased AD symptoms in mice and inhibits degranulation of IgE/Ag-activated mast cells. Our study suggests that ESR may serve as a potential therapeutic candidate for the treatment of AD symptoms.",

            "text": "Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease. AD causes epidermal thickness with cutaneous hypersensitivity associated with increased serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels and infiltration of inflammatory cell types including mast cells and eosinophils [1, 2] . AD is a complex interaction of innate and adaptive immune responses based on an individual's genetic, environmental, pharmacological, and psychological conditions. IgE secretion is an important characteristic of AD, with elevated levels related to disease severity in AD patients. Previous studies report that high serum IgE levels induce activation of mast cells and cause an allergic reaction [2, 3] . Because mast cells aggregate high-affinity IgE receptors (Fc RI) on their surfaces, which is important in the proinflammatory/allergic response, mast cells are believed to play an important role in the induction of AD [4, 5] .",

SR has been used as a traditional herbal medicine to treat diarrhea, chronic intestinal infections, duodenal ulcers, internal hemorrhage, and burns [8] [9] [10] . SR includes saponin glycosides and ellagitannins (i.e., pomolic acid, sanguisorbic acid dilactone, and ziyuglycoside I). SR and its active components have been demonstrated to have biological activity in vivo and in vitro. SR inhibits the renal dysfunction induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) endotoxin in vivo by suppressing the serum nitrite/nitrate levels and the activity of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) [11] . In addition, SR was reported to have antioxidative stress and antiaging activity via suppressing of nitric oxide (NO) production and activity of iNOS [10, 12, 13] . SR blocked H 2 O 2 -induced ROS generation in vitro and MCAO-induced ischemic brain damage in vivo [14] . Additional reported properties of SR include anticancer [15] , antiasthma [16] , anticoronavirus [17] , and antiwrinkle activity [18] . Many researchers reported anti-inflammatory activities of SR. Nonetheless, antiatopic dermatitis effects of SR are not reported. Recently, studies reported inhibitory effect of SR on contact dermatitis [19] , and we reported anti-inflammatory mechanism of ESR in human keratinocyte by suppressing the expression of TNF-/IFN--stimulated chemokines and proinflammatory molecules via blockade of NF-B, STAT-1, and ERK activation. However, the biological and pharmacological actions of SR are not fully understood in atopic dermatitis.",

Specifically, IgE binding to mast cells affects the development and severity of AD [21] . Mast cells play a key role in allergic reactions via the production and secretion of proinflammatory mediators such as histamine, chemokines, cytokines, and growth factors. On the surface of mast cells, Th2 cells produce IgE, which binds to the Fc RI on the mast cell surface [25] . Fc RI-mediated mast cell activation is triggered by antigen IgE cross-linking and leads to the degranulation and expression of proinflammatory mediators. Fc RI-activated mast cells induce IgE elevation and increase mast cells in a majority of AD patients; therefore, mast cells are hypothesized to contribute to the pathogenesis of AD [3] . Our findings show that ESR treatment suppresses serum IgE levels and mast cell infiltration in a DNCB-induced AD mouse model. -HEX, a degranulation marker, is released along with other proinflammatory mediators when mast cells are activated [23, 26] . Therefore, we examined the degranulation by measuring -HEX release in antigen IgE-activated BMMCs and confirmed that ESR treatment inhibited -HEX release in a dose-dependent manner.",
