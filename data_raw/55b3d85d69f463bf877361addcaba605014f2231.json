Information about its transmission pattern is still scant. Although MERS-CoV has been shown to have a fatality rate as high as 40% [2] , no medication or vaccine with proven efficacy has yet been developed. Although the first case of MERS-CoV was reported in Saudi Arabia in October 2012, nosocomial infection with MERS-CoV was reported in Jordan as early as March 2012 [3] . Thereafter, MERS-CoV has caused outbreaks of various scales in hos-pitals, while community-acquired infections have remained extremely rare. Although most patients with MERS-CoV have been reported in the Middle East, both before and after the outbreak in the Republic of Korea (hereafter Korea) in May 2015, the outbreak in Korea was the largest in any country other than Saudi Arabia. This outbreak made MERS-CoV an important international health issue [4] . After the first outbreak in Pyeongtaek St. Mary's Hospital, where the patient zero was hospitalized, the outbreak spread when infected patients moved to other hospitals, resulting in an unprecedentedly large outbreak in Korea [5] . In this study, we aimed to analyze the epidemiological features of the MERS cases in Pyeongtaek St. Mary's Hospital, where the first outbreak of MERS-CoV in Korea took place, with the goal of identifying lessons capable of helping to prevent and/or control future outbreaks.",

Although the median duration from symptom onset to confirmation of MERS-CoV infection was eight days, it became significantly shorter as the epidemic spread. In addition, the intervals from symptom onset to discharge and from diagnosis to discharge were significantly shorter for the second-generation cases than for the first-generation cases. These findings indicate that the confirmation of MERS-CoV infection in the first-generation of cases was initially relatively delayed, while the duration of treatment before discharge was higher. However, no significant difference in fatality rate by generation was observed, unlike the findings of a previous study in Saudi Arabia that found a lesser degree of severity in the second-generation [11] . Therefore, it seems that earlier confirmation of infection and treatment could reduce the overall duration of treatment, although it does not seem to be the case that the symptoms of the second-generation cases were more benign than those of the first-generation cases.",

Proper initial quarantine measures would have ended the outbreak with the 26 cases of the first-generation. However, the extent of the initial quarantine was limited to healthcare workers and those in the room where patient zero was hospitalized, and it did not include other inpatients or caregivers on the same floor. Although the 2014 KCDC guidelines for controlling MERS-CoV state that those who have close contact with confirmed cases as well as those who have casual contact, such as exposure to the confirmed cases or contaminated areas, must be quarantined or monitored carefully [14] , these guidelines were not fully implemented. This was related to delays in the confirmation of MERS-CoV infections after the initial onset of symptoms, and the lack of a quarantine caused new outbreaks by allowing the movement of several cases to other hospitals. The second reason for the spread of MERS-CoV was overcrowding of the ward with families, who are in charge of patient care in Korea, and visitors [5] . In fact, a total of 389 family members and visitors were exposed to MERS-CoV in Pyeongtaek St. Mary's Hospital, which was higher than the number of exposed inpatients (n= 277). As a result, of the 26 cases in the first-generation, 12 were the family members of inpatients and one was a visitor who was infected in a single visit. These findings were consistent with the problems that have already been noted in the outbreak in Saudi Arabia: overcrowding, the late recognition of MERS-CoV infection, and inadequate infection control practices [15] .",

            "text": "In conclusion, this study investigated the epidemiologic features of MERS-CoV in Pyeongtaek St. Mary's Hospital, the origin of the MERS-CoV outbreak in Korea. A total of 36 cases, including 26 in the first-generation and 10 in the second-generation, were identified, of whom four were moved to other hospitals without appropriate quarantine, causing the nationwide MERS-CoV outbreak. The best method of preventing future outbreaks of new infectious diseases is overcoming the weak points identified here, including ward overcrowding, uncontrolled patient migration between hospitals without an appropriate data-sharing system, and the absence of a quarantine of those who were initially exposed.
