Ingestion has been shown as a natural route of transmission for both Lassa virus (LASV) and Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). Due to the mechanism of transmission, epithelial tissues are among the first host cells to come in contact with the viruses, and as such they potentially play a role in spread of virus to na\u00efve hosts. The role of the intestinal epithelia during arenavirus infection remains to be uncharacterized. We have utilized a well-established cell culture model, Caco-2, to investigate the role of intestinal epithelia during intragastric infection. We found that LCMV-Armstrong, LCMV-WE, and Mopeia (MOPV) release infectious progeny via similar patterns. However, the reassortant virus, ML-29, containing the L segment of MOPV and S segment of LASV, exhibits a unique pattern of viral release relative to LCMV and MOPV. Furthermore, we have determined attachment efficacy to Caco-2 cells is potentially responsible for observed replication kinetics of these viruses in a polarized Caco-2 cell model. Collectively, our data shows that viral dissemination and interaction with intestinal epithelia may be host, tissue, and viral specific. Viruses 2018, 10, 75 2 of 15",

Although LASV causes a significant number of deaths, the majority of infections are apparently subclinical, or not severe enough to warrant emergency medical intervention, as over 45% of the population in endemic regions is seropositive for LASV; however, why some of the population develop disease and others do not it is not well understood [9] . Most recently, a study of almost 200 LASV sequences has shown that reservoir-to-human transmission is a primary driving force of LASV epidemics in Western Africa [10] . LASV is carried by its natural host Mastomys natalensis, and it is widely accepted that transmission of LASV to humans likely occurs via the ingestion of contaminated food-stuffs, or by the inhalation of infectious particles [5] . Indeed, an epidemiological study in the Republic of Guinea showed a link between the consumption of contaminated food as a risk for rodent-to-human transmission [11] .",

Currently, there are no clinically approved vaccines for LASV; and the antiviral drug ribavirin is the only treatment available for LASV infection. Nonetheless, caveats to this antiviral strategy/treatment regimen include severe side effects, and the requirement for early administration in order to have positive therapeutic effects [12] . Among limited vaccine candidates, only a LASV/Mopeia (MOPV) reassortant virus, ML-29, has been demonstrated to induce protective immunity against LASV strains from clade IV (Sierra-Leone, Liberia, Republic of Guinea) and clade II (Nigeria) [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . Specifically, ML-29 is composed of the MOPV L segment, a non-pathogenic relative of LASV, and the S segment of LASV [20] . MOPV and ML-29 share the L RNA encoding L protein (RNA polymerase), and Z protein (matrix). Previous studies have determined that the L RNA segment of MOPV is the major factor of ML29 attenuation in vivo. Comparison of the ML-29 L segment with the parental MOPV L segment revealed the presence of numerous point mutations that may contribute to the attenuated phenotype associated with .

After this period, the cells were washed with DMEM without phenol red, and a semi-solid overlay containing 1X MEM, 5% FBS, and 0.5% Avicel (FMC BioPolymer, Philadelphia, PA, USA) (LCMV and ML-29) or 0.5% Agarose (MOPV). Cells were then incubated in a 37 \u2022 C humidified chamber with 5% CO 2 for 5 days. The plaque assay cells infected with LCMV and ML-29 had the overlay media removed, were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde solution for 15 min and cells were stained with 1% Crystal Violet solution to identify virus-infected cell foci. For titration of MOPV, virus-infected cells were covered with semisolid overlay of 0.5% agarose/5% FBS overlay. A 0.04% neutral red, 0.5% agarose, 5%FBS solution was added to wells after 4 days incubation. Both plaque assays have a limit of detection of approximately 80 PFU/mL.",

LCMV-Arm has a ratio of apical and basolateral attachment of approximately 1.5, indicating that attachment has a slight preference to the basolateral surface of the polarized Caco-2 cells ( Figure 6E ). The ratio of basolateral and apical attachment of LCMV-WE and MOPV of approximately 1, indicates that LCMV-WE and MOPV attachment is more or less equivalent in its binding to the apical and the basolateral surfaces of Caco-2 cells ( Figure 6E ). While LCMV-ARM is unique in its binding preference as compared to the other viruses, this indicates that LCMV-ARM, LCMV-WE, and MOPV all attach to some degree on the apical and basolateral surface of the cells. However, the ratio of basolateral and apical attachment of ML-29 indicates that there is a large difference between viral attachment between the two surfaces, with a significant preference for the apical side of the polarized Caco-2 cells ( Figure 6E ). ML-29's preference for the apical surface with comparatively little to no binding on the basolateral surface, is significantly different than that of LCMV and MOPV. Collectively, these data indicate that LASV-GP has a significantly different binding efficacy to the basolateral side of Caco-2 monolayers as compared to LCMV and MOPV. Since we cannot directly compare the absolute levels of attachment for each surface between the individual virus species, we must compare the ratios of apically and basolaterally bound viruses to identify statistical differences between the four OW arenaviruses used in this study. Overall, these comparisons indicate that LCMV-ARM and ML-29 differ from the other viruses, and each other, in regards to their binding proclivities. LCMV-Arm has a ratio of apical and basolateral attachment of approximately 1.5, indicating that attachment has a slight preference to the basolateral surface of the polarized Caco-2 cells ( Figure 6E ).

Up to 45% of individuals living in some LASV endemic regions in Western Africa can be seropositive to the virus; and if re-infection occurs, seropositive individuals can protect themselves from disease onset. However, seronegative individuals may also be protected from disease, due to protection associated with cell-mediated immunity [41] . This implies high prevalence into endemic populations; however, the precise mechanisms behind this phenomenon are unknown. In NHP studies of arenavirus disease, LCMV-WE causes LF-like disease via intravenous (i.v.)-infection, whereas LCMV-ARM shows chronic infection, with no disease onset [23] . Furthermore, high titer i.v. infections of NHPs with LCMV-WE resulted in uniform mortality [23] . Nevertheless, i.g. infection with identical titers showed a variable outcome, ranging from no signs and symptoms to fatal, LF-like disease with elevated aspartate and alanine aminotransferases (ALT/AST) levels [23, 24] . Elevated ALT and AST levels are symptomatic of hepatic tissue damage, and highly elevated levels are associated with lethal LF disease of humans in endemic regions [42] . In addition, some of the surviving animals survived i.v. challenge, indicating that LCMV infection did occur as a competent humoral response was induced [24] . Due to probable infection via the ingestion of contaminated food stuffs, and the variable outcomes of intragastric infection in vivo, we sought to investigate whether or not the patterns of entry and exit when polarized Caco-2 cells were exposed to OW mammarenaviruses apically (intragastric route) or basolaterally (intravenous route).",

These in vivo and in vitro studies led us to investigate the role of the intestinal epithelial barrier during OW arenavirus infection. In this study, we characterized an in vitro model of intragastric infection to assess the interaction of OW mammarenaviruses with the intestinal epithelia in an amenable tissue culture system. This system utilized polarized Caco-2 cells grown on transwells, which is a well-established cell type and cell culture system used for in vitro studies of the intestinal barrier [36, 38] . This system enables the independent examination of the role of the apical and basolateral epithelia surfaces during viral infection. Therefore, this model recapitulates the infection of intestinal epithelial cells from the luminal and laminal sides of the epithelial monolayer via the apical and basolateral surfaces, respectively. Using this model system, we evaluated infections of LCMV strains of different pathogenic potentials. We also used a MOPV/LASV reassortant, ML-29, a validated BSL2 surrogate model that is capable of mimicking the interaction of LASV with susceptible cells. ML-29 expresses GP1 attachment glycoprotein identical to LASV GP1, and MOPV, attenuated genetic relative of LASV. Since ML-29 is a reassortant virus of LASV/MOPV, it represents a better system in which arenaviral biology can be determined compared to VSV or retrovirus-based pseudotypes expressing LASV GPC as the viruses contain genuine arenaviral replication machinery.",

However, when exposed on the apical side of epithelial cells, LCMV and MOPV primarily released on the apical side of the cells, but release basolaterally was observed. This observation indicates that the epithelial barrier is not the sole determinant of viral dissemination. Interesting to note as well, was that patterns of replication were similar regardless of the in vivo pathogenicity of the LCMV strains. Therefore, the infectious capacity of these viruses in vitro, in regards to Caco-2 cells, does not correlate with pathogenic properties for LCMV. Therefore, further investigation as to the driving forces of pathogenic differences needs to be investigated. However, in contrast to LCMV, the ML-29 expressing LASV GP1, predominantly released viral particles apically regardless of the route of entry. Furthermore, these results demonstrate that MOPV entry-release pattern in polarized Caco-2 cells resembled those in cells infected with LCMV, and was clearly different from ML29-driving entry-release. Due to ML-29 replication patterns being different than that of MOPV replication, these patterns of entry and release are not due to MOPV replication machinery, and may be attributed to the gene products of the S segment of LASV, namely the glycoproteins and nucleoprotein. This poor replication and egress to the basolateral sides of the cells is an interesting observation. While ML-29 is not WT-LASV, using WT-LASV in similar studies could lead to an explanation as to why almost half of the population of endemic regions are seropositive for LASV, but never demonstrated clinical signs of disseminated illness. In addition, the data presented here indicates that the capacity to infect via the apical surface of intestinal epithelial cells is not a primary determinant of arenavirus pathogenesis.",

If after successful attachment following the ingestion of viral particles fails to release viral particles basolaterally, this may be an exceptionally potent tool for the development of successful immunity against LASV in at-risk populations. These results provide additional evidence for attenuation of ML-29 as a vaccine strain for LASV. From these in vitro studies, and the dire need for a LASV vaccine, studies examining the importance of the route of exposure to in an in vivo model should be investigated as a potential therapy to LASV infection and prevention.",

Here, rLCMV-LASGP showed preferential entry into polarized Caco-2 cells on the basolateral surface of these cells. Opposingly, we identified via qRT-PCR that viral attachment of ML-29, a reassortant containing the GP1 of LASV, preferred the apical surface of polarized Caco-2 cells. Interestingly, we did see LCMV preferentially attaching to the basolateral surface of polarized cells, as seen with rLCMV-LASVGP. However, the rLCMV-LASGP studies did not elucidate the viral release patterns of rLCMV-LASVGP in polarized Caco-2 cells, nor the initial attachment of viruses to these cell surfaces. Furthermore, due to ML-29's genetic differences to the LCMV-backbone of rLCMV-LASVGP, our results and those of Oppliger et al. cannot be directly compared. Taken together, our observations, are a useful addition to the field to further investigate precise differences between rLCMV-LASVGP and ML-29 in order to evaluate genetic variations of these viruses to more accurately identify potential targets for LASV therapeutics and further understand the replication cycle of LASV.",

Although primary receptor (\u03b1-DG) is located on the basolateral surface of the polarized Caco-2 cells, this data, along with the data of others, provides further support that LASV has complex receptor usage. Additional receptors for LASV should be investigated in the Caco-2 system, including Axl, DC-SIGN and Tyro3. Along with additional receptors and their role in our system, the interaction with \u03b1-DG should also be investigated. An excellent review by Torriani et al. describes a number of studies that explain the complex viral-receptor interaction of LASV [44] . Although fully functional \u03b1-DG was detected basolaterally in polarized Caco-2 cells, ML-29's binding efficiency was low. This may be due to a multitude of reasons including the use of other cellular factors and receptors used in addition to \u03b1-DG to attach to these polarized cells, or differences and mutations that ML-29 may contain as compared to WT LASV, especially those present in the GP2 protein. Previous research has identified that LASV infection was dependent upon sodium hydrogen exchangers (NHEs), as well as actin cytoskeleton to have successful viral entry into host cells [45] . Investigations into these factors during infection of polarized Caco-2 cells should be analyzed to determine a reason for inefficient and poor binding of ML-29 on the basolateral side of these cells. Although ML-29 contains the S segment of LASV, the L segment of MOPV may interfere with complete and successful viral replication that WT LASV may have, comparatively. However, we believe the latter to be a minimal or insignificant inhibition of viral attachment and replication due to MOPV replicating similarly to LCMV in polarized Caco-2 cells when exposed to the basolateral side of the cells, as compared to little or no viral replication by ML-29 after basolateral exposure. Thus, investigation into precisely how WT LASV attaches, enters, and releases from polarized Caco-2 cells would be a valuable addition to the field.",

These polarized epithelia closely mimic intestinal epithelial of human hosts and allow further investigation of mammarenaviral infection at the epithelial barrier. These data with LCMV show that intestinal epithelial cells may not be the sole determinant of viral pathogenesis and dissemination. Furthermore, differences between prototypic arenavirus LCMV and the surrogate model of LASV interaction, ML-29, were observed in both attachment efficiency and viral entry and egress from polarized intestinal epithelia. These results may potentially explain the high penetrance without disease observed for LASV. In addition, ML-29's diminished binding efficiency to the basolateral side of polarized Caco-2 cells supports the expanding complexity of arenavirus receptor interactions. Collectively, these studies show that arenaviral infection of polarized cells is not only viral specific, but ultimately may be tissue and host-specific as well; and that arenavirus infection and pathogenesis may be dependent on asymmetric distribution of viral and cellular factors required for virus entry and budding.",
