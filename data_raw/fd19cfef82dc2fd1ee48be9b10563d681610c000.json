However, the urea dissociated monomers of K315A mutant protein in GdmCl were reversible folding through a multiple steps mechanism as measured by tryptophan and ANS fluorescence. Two partly unfolded intermediates were detected in the pathway. Refolding of the intermediates resulted in a conformation with greater amounts of hydrophobic regions exposed which was prone to the formation of protein aggregates. The formation of aggregates was not prevented by the addition of \u03b1-crystallin.

When this sequence of amino acids was deleted the protein became unstable and was prone to form protein aggregates.

K315 is one of the residues symmetrical located at this interface, interacting with the same residue in other monomers by hydrogen bonds (Fig 1C and 1D ). Substitution of this residue with leucine resulted in part dissociation of the quaternary structure. In contrast, the K315A mutant protein was relatively stable. This protein was unfolded into an intermediate with a stable conformation at 3 M urea [11] . This phenomenon was not observed for the K315L mutant protein, which was unfolded under the same conditions. The results lead to the hypothesis that the bulky and charged side-chain of K315 might affect the stability of the intermediate during the process of protein unfolding. When wild-type \u03b4-crystallin was unfolded in GdmCl, the first transition for subunit dissociation resulted in a monomeric intermediate with a molten globule conformation [12, 13] . During the refolding of 5 M GdmCl denatured \u03b4-crystallin a marked hysteresis was observed, suggesting that the quaternary structure of that inappropriate assembled species might be related to the conformation of the refolded monomers [14, 16] . The presence of stable intermediate during unfolding of K315A mutant protein in the presence of urea suggests that the interactions provided by this residue at the interfaces might provide an energy barrier for subunit dissociation.

It is the major soluble protein in the eye lens of reptiles and birds and functions as a structural protein to maintain the refraction properties of the lens [1, 2] . \u03b4-Crystallin and argininosuccinate lyase (ASL) are homologous proteins. ASL is In this study, the effects of this interaction on the folding pathway of wild-type and mutant proteins were investigated using urea as a denaturant. The different distributions of dissociated component from wild-type and mutant proteins, as measured by sedimentation velocity experiment, suggests the quaternary structure dissociates in different ways for wild-type and mutant proteins. Structural simulation supports different dissociation processes for the two proteins. These results highlight the critical role of K315 in stabilizing the quaternary structure of \u03b4-crystallin. The residue appears to control both the dissociation of dimers into monomers and the stability of the produced monomers. The monomers dissociated from the K315A mutant protein with a stable and compact conformation provided a good model for studying the folding mechanism of the \u03b4-crystallin. This study reveals the conformational status of the monomers, which determines whether functional protein or aggregates are formed.",

In contrast, dilution of 3.5 or 4 M urea denatured wild-type \u03b4-crystallin or 6 M urea denatured K315A mutant protein did not result in the restoration of the properly folded conformation. These results suggest that the reversible assembly of the quaternary structure of \u03b4-crystallin is correlated with the conformation of the dissociated monomers.",

No protein aggregation was detected upon dilution of 0.84, 3 and 5 M GdmCl denatured monomeric mutant protein into buffer containing 1.5 M urea. However, when 0.84 and 3 M GdmCl denatured monomeric mutant protein was diluted into buffer, protein aggregation was occurred. The rates for aggregate formation were calculated to be ca. 0.14 and 0.0004 min -1 , respectively (Fig 6A) . When \u03b1A-crystallin, the chaperone protein, was added in a 5:1 ratio to 0.84 M GdmCl denatured monomeric mutant protein in folding buffer, no change in the rate of protein aggregation was observed. Formation of aggregates by \u03b1A-crystallin alone did not occur under the same conditions. It is notable that upon dilution of 5 M GdmCl denatured monomeric mutant protein into buffer, no aggregation occurred. The structural features of the protein aggregate were investigated using the thioflavin T assay [30] . An increase in fluorescence intensity resulting from binding of ThT with the aggregates over time was observed following dilution of 0.84 and 3 M GdmCl denatured monomeric mutant \u03b4-crystallin into buffer (Fig 6B) . The results suggest the possible formation of ordered aggregates. No changes in the signal were observed during the incubation period upon refolding of 5 M GdmCl denatured monomeric mutant protein.",

From the simulation trajectory, the dynamic motion for disassembly of the quaternary structure and conformational changes in the tertiary structure were elucidated. The distances between the C \u03b1 of D237 and R182, R302 and E330 and the two K315 or A315 residues were measured to evaluate the extent for subunit dissociation between the A-C, A-D and A-B dimeric pairs, respectively (Fig 7A) . These residues interact with each other by hydrogen bonding or salt bridges at the dimeric pair interface in the native structure. These interactions are lost on replacement of K315 with A315. The results showed that the distances between D237 and R182, R302 and E330 and the two A315 residues increased linearly at a similar rate, except that the rate of change for the R302-E330 interaction in wild-type protein was about half of that for the mutant protein. In contrast, no changes in the distance between the K315 residues were observed before 80 ps. Inspection of the timecourse at 20 ps in wild-type protein showed that the primary dimers of subunit A and C or B and D showed were separated, while the diagonal dimers of subunit A and B or C and D were connected by the interactions of residue K315 (Fig 7B) . However, the subunits for both of the primary and diagonal dimers were separated from each other in the mutant protein. The results suggest a different disassembly process for tetrameric wild-type and mutant proteins.",

Substitution of this residue by alanine reduces the structural stability of the protein. The results from the previous study showed about a 9\u00b0C reduction in the thermal stability of the secondary structure and the changes in the micro-environment surrounding the tryptophan residues [11] . This mutant protein was also more susceptible to chemical denaturation, since about half of the concentration of denaturant was required to disrupt its quaternary structure compared to wild-type protein. Both of the wild-type and mutant protein showed similar and not reversible denaturation in the presence of GdmCl. However, differences in the denaturation pathway were observed when urea was used as the denaturant. The results suggest that the non-covalent interactions between the intra and inter-subunits might be disrupted by the ionic character of GdmCl, with subunit dissociation and denaturation occurring simultaneously for both proteins [31] . The previous studies showing the presence of only a monomeric molten globule intermediate in the dissociation pathway of wild-type \u03b4-crystallin in GdmCl supports this assumption [12, 13] . Thus, the role of K315 in the folding process of \u03b4-crystallin cannot be distinguished under the strong denaturant.",

Monomers in this conformation were able to refold and re-associate into tetramers with a similar conformation as the native protein, and possessed significant ASL activity. When the urea concentration was increased to 2.5 M, the conformational changes led to further exposure of hydrophobic regions. However, following this conformational change at higher urea concentrations, protein folding was not reversible. The contrasting result found for wild-type protein was that the dissociation and denaturation were concurrent under the effect of urea (Fig 3A) . In this condition, the conformation of the dissociated monomers was partly unfolded, as judged from the reduced level of \u03b1-helix (Fig 2B) .

It was found that both of the dimers and monomers were dissociated from the wild-type protein at around 2 to 4 M urea, as measured by sedimentation velocity while only monomers were dissociated from the mutant protein (Fig 3) . These results suggest that the interactions provided by K315 at the interfaces seem to increase the energy barrier for dimeric dissociation. When these interactions were disrupted by mutation, the monomers could be isolated with intact conformation from the tetramers earlier than for the wild-type protein in urea. Thus, the steps for dissociation and denaturation could be distinguished in the unfolding process of the K315A mutant \u03b4-crystallin. In this study, the dynamic motion of protein structure in the process was simulated for elucidation the dissociation mechanism of \u03b4-crystallin. From the trajectory, the tetramers were found to disassemble at the early stage. Due to the interactions by K315, the interfaces between the diagonal dimers remain connected while distances increase between the subunits of the primary dimers in wild-type protein. In contrast, the subunits between both of the diagonal and primary dimers were dissociated in the K315A mutant protein (Fig 7) . As \u03b4-crystallin was assembled by two close contact dimers as transthyretin, dissociation at the two primary dimer interfaces would be expected to occur at the initial stage [4, 32] . The simulation result provides a novel pattern for dissociation of the double dimeric protein consistent with the results of sedimentation velocity experiments. A possible explanation for this earlier dissociation of the subunit from the primary dimers compared to diagonal dimers is differences in solvent accessibility. Unlike the location of the interfaces between the subunits of the primary dimer, the position of K315 is buried at the interior interfaces away from solvent. Thus, the interactions of K315 at the interfaces of the protein seem to elevate the stability of the quaternary structure. For wild-type protein, two diagonal dimers were presumed to disassemble initially from the tetramers followed by subunit dissociation of the diagonal dimers. However, dissociation at the interfaces of two primary dimers would assume to be the first step in the unfolding process of the K315A mutant protein (Fig 8) .",

Thus, the monomers that reversible dissociated from K315A mutant \u03b4-crystallin with a stable conformation and possessing similar level of secondary structure as the original state, and this would be a good model for studying the folding process. The monomeric protein was reversible denatured in a four-state mechanism in the presence of GdmCl and two intermediates were detected in the process (Fig 5) . Refolding of the partly unfolded intermediate was not reversible which in turn resulted in a conformation with more exposure of hydrophobic regions. Only denatured \u03b4-crystallin was reversible folded into the monomers with a similar conformation to the original state. It is interesting that the refolded monomers were able to reassemble into tetramer instantly upon dilutions, with substantial recovery of activity (Fig 5 and Table 1 ). This contrasts with the slow refolding of GdmCl denatured wild-type protein into its tetrameric form with no detectable activity. The slow recovery of the quaternary structure for the latter protein is due to an energy barrier for the appropriate assembly of double dimers, as reported previously [14] . The results suggest that the conformation of the denatured monomers which The tetrameric wild-type (T) and K315A mutant (T*) \u03b4-crystallin was dissociated through the diagonal dimer (D) and primary dimer (D*) to monomers with partial unfolded (M) and stable (M*) conformation, respectively. Monomers of the wild-type or the mutant protein were then denatured through intermediate (I or I*) into respective unfolded form (U or U*). The monomers (M) of wild-type protein in partial unfolded conformation was associated in alternative pathway to form dimers (D 1 ), and then assembled into tetramers (T 1 ) or aggregates (A). The aggregation was prevented by \u03b1A-crystallin.

The intermediate with the highest exposure of hydrophobic conformation is particularly prone to aggregate formation (Fig 5) . Aggregate formation by monomeric intermediates with defined conformations was also reported for transthyretin under mildly acidic conditions [33] . The result implies that the conformational status of the monomers influences subunit association. It is interesting that the presence of \u03b1crystallin seems to increase the formation of aggregates from the monomeric intermediates of \u03b4-crystallin with partly unfolded conformation, while \u03b1-crystallin alone was not affected under these conditions (Fig 6) . The studies for \u03b1A peptide which induces the aggregation of soluble \u03b1-crystallin suggested that the mechanism for aggregate formation might due to the changes in the hydrophobicity of \u03b1-crystallin induced by the peptide [34, 35] . Our previous study reported that aggregate formation during refolding of GdmCl denatured wild-type \u03b4-crystallin was due to the improper assembling of double dimers and was prevented by the presence of \u03b1-crystallin [14] . In this study, the aggregate formation was caused by assembly of the refolded monomeric intermediate which facilitated the aggregate formation of \u03b1-crystallin. It thus postulated that the electrostatic interaction with the substrate seems to be key factors to determine the chaperon-like or anti-chaperone activity of the \u03b1-crystallin [34, 36] . The underlying mechanism requires further investigation. Nonetheless, the result highlights the conformational status of the monomers which play a critical role in the folding pathway for reversible oligomerization or aggregate formation.",

            "text": "In conclusion, the folding pathways of wild-type and mutant \u03b4-crystallin are summarized as the working models shown in Fig 8. This model depicts the key interactions from K315 at the interfaces of diagonal subunits not only to stabilize the quaternary structure of \u03b4-crystallin but also to act as the energy barrier for dissociation of stable monomers. The stability might be one of the reasons for recruitment of the metabolic enzyme ASL into the lens as a crystallin protein [37] . The single polypeptide chain of \u03b4-crystallin after translation would be assumed to fold into functional tetramers as the proposed refolding pathway for K315A mutant. However, due to the interactions by K315, the tetrameric protein would be assumed to dissemble in an alternative manner to form the diagonal dimers, followed by simultaneous subunit dissociation and denaturation. Monomers in this status might associate into dimers via a different pathway which then assemble slowly into a non-native tetrameric form or self-associate into aggregates which can be prevented by the presence of \u03b1-crystallin. The reversible folding of the monomers that dissociated from the K315A mutant protein with near native conformation provided the folding mechanism of the \u03b4-crystallin. In this process, the ordered aggregate formation from re-association of the partly unfolded intermediate reveals a specific status of the protein to avoid the chaperone function of \u03b1-crystallin. This model proposes a possible mechanism about the aggregate formation for lens protein under stress effect and their interaction with \u03b1-crystallin. This study reveals the key role of monomers that dissociated from the oligomeric crystallin; their conformational status determines the levels of aggregate formation. , the panels show the raw sedimentation and theoretical fitted data (solid lines), and the fitting residual, respectively.
