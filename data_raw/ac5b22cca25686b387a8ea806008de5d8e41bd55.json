            "text": "NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation triggers caspase-1 activation-induced maturation of interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 and IL-18 and therefore is important for the development of the host defense against various RNA viral diseases. However, the implication of this protein complex in human metapneumovirus (HMPV) disease has not been fully studied. Herein, we report that NLRP3 inflammasome plays a detrimental role during HMPV infection because NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition protected mice from mortality and reduced weight loss and inflammation without impacting viral replication. We also demonstrate that NLRP3 inflammasome exerts its deleterious effect via IL-1\u03b2 production since we observed reduced mortality, weight loss and inflammation in IL-1\u03b2-deficient (IL-1\u03b2 -/-) mice, as compared to wild-type animals during HMPV infection. Moreover, the effect on these evaluated parameters was not different in IL-1\u03b2 -/and wild-type mice treated with an NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor. The production of IL-1\u03b2 was also abrogated in bone marrow derived macrophages deficient for NLRP3. Finally, we show that small hydrophobic proteindeleted recombinant HMPV (HMPV \u0394SH) failed to activate caspase-1, which is responsible for IL-1\u03b2 cleavage and maturation. Furthermore, HMPV \u0394SH-infected mice had less weight loss, showed no mortality and reduced inflammation, as compared to wild-type HMPVinfected mice. Thus, NLRP3 inflammasome activation seems to be triggered by HMPV SH protein in HMPV disease. In summary, once activated by the HMPV SH protein, NLRP3 inflammasome promotes the maturation of IL-1\u03b2, which exacerbates HMPV-induced inflammation. Therefore, the blockade of IL-1\u03b2 production by using NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors might be a novel potential strategy for the therapy and prevention of HMPV infection.",

Once activated, caspase-1 proteolytically cleaves interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 and IL-18 precursors (pro-IL-1\u03b2 and pro-IL-18), leading to the release of mature forms [2, 3] . Among identified inflammasomes, the NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome containing NLRP3, adapter protein apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC) and pro-caspase-1 is the most fully studied [4] . NLRP3 inflammasome activation is a two-step process. The first step involves a priming signal provided by microbial molecules or endogenous cytokines, which upregulates the transcription of inactive NLRP3, pro-IL-1\u03b2 and pro-IL-18. The second step is characterized by the oligomerization of NLRP3 and subsequent assembly of NLRP3, ASC and pro-caspase-1 into a complex [5] . This signal is provided by numerous stimuli such as ATP, pore-forming toxins, viral RNA, etc. Most of them induce potassium efflux, calcium signaling, reactive oxygen species generation, mitochondrial dysfunction and lysosomal rupture [6] .",

Surprisingly, although NLRP3 inflammasome could be activated by vesicular stomatitis and encephalomyocarditis viruses, it seemed to have no influence on the pathogenesis of these two viruses [16] . In the case of influenza A virus infection, several studies investigating the role of NLRP3 inflammasome have yielded controversial results [17] [18] [19] [20] , leading to the conclusion that NLRP3 inflammasome might play a dual protective or detrimental role at different stages of influenza A virus infection [21] .",

This virus is one of the leading causes of respiratory tract disease in both children and adults. The adaptive immune response generated against HMPV is usually inefficient at protecting from reinfections, which are repeated throughout life [23] . There is currently no licensed vaccine to prevent HMPV infection and its treatment is still limited to the use of ribavirin, a weakly effective antiviral agent, and immunoglobulins [24] . Thus, highlighting the role of NLRP3 inflammasome during HMPV infection may provide a new perspective on the prevention and treatment of this viral disease. To date, only one study has reported increases in the production of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18, accompanied by an upregulation of NLRP3 mRNA expression in HMPV-infected children, as compared to control healthy individuals [25] . However, the authors did not clarify the role of NLRP3 inflammasome during HMPV infection.",

Once activated, this multiprotein complex exerts a deleterious effect during HMPV infection in mice by triggering IL-1\u03b2 release. Therefore, targeting NLRP3 inflammasome as well as IL-1\u03b2 may be of interest for the development of new therapeutics against HMPV infections. MCC950 has been recently synthesized and recognized as a specific inhibitor of NLRP3, but not NLRP1, NLRC4 or AIM2 inflammasomes [26] . Since then, it has been preferentially used in various models of NLRP3-related diseases [27] . A recent study has reported that MCC950 did not impact the viability and proliferation of high-glucose-induced human retinal endothelial cells at a concentration of 100 \u03bcM [28] . In the current study, we also showed that this inhibitor was safe and usable for both human THP-1 (CC 50 > 250 \u03bcM) and murine J774.2 (CC 50 > 125 \u03bcM) cells (S1 Fig). To determine if NLRP3 inflammasome impacts HMPV replication, THP-1 or J774.2 cells were treated or not with 10 \u03bcM of MCC950 because this dose has been shown to be able to block NLRP3 activation in mouse bone marrow derived macrophages, human monocyte derived macrophages and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells [26] , and then infected with HMPV. The viral loads evaluated on days 1, 2 and 3 post-infection did not differ between MCC950-treated and control DMSO-treated groups ( Fig 1A) . We also observed that viral titers were relatively low, but as expected since no trypsin was added during the cell culture assay. Thus, NLRP3 inflammasome had no influence on HMPV replication in vitro.",

No difference in survival and weight loss between IL-18BP-treated and non-treated mice was observed during HMPV infection ( Fig 5A) . Thus, the involvement of NLRP3 inflammasome in the pathogenesis of HMPV is IL-18-independent. Interestingly, we noticed that NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition always protected mice against HMPV disease even if virus was administered at a lethal dose, as evidenced by no mortality and slight weight loss (<10% initial weight) in MCC950-treated compared to DMSO-treated mice.

We then evaluated caspase-1 cleavage as a marker of NLRP3 inflammasome activation because caspase-1 cleavage depends on the assembly of NLRP3, ASC and procaspase-1 to form inflammasome [5] . Western Blot analysis showed that HMPV inoculation induced caspase-1 cleavage in THP-1 cells (Fig 6) . This cleavage, however, was prevented by MCC950 treatment. These results confirm the capacity of HMPV to induce NLRP3 inflammasome. In parallel, we found that HMPV \u0394SH could not induce caspase-1 cleavage in THP-1 cells (Fig 6) . Thus, SH protein seems to be the viral component triggering NLRP3 inflammasome activation, but other experiments are needed to determine if the mutant virus simply becomes inaccessible to pro-inflammatory danger sensors via compartmentalization or if it is physically unable to prime or activate the inflammasome. Cleaved caspase-1 was detected in both cell lysates and supernatants at 1 h but was only present in the cell supernatants at 24 h post-infection. This indicates that caspase-1 was rapidly cleaved and released into the supernatants [33] upon HMPV inoculation.",

Herein, we demonstrate that the involvement of NLRP3 inflammasome in the pathogenesis of HMPV only proceeds via its pro-inflammatory effect. Indeed, both in vitro and in vivo studies showed that viral replication was almost unaltered whereas inflammation was attenuated upon NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition during HMPV infection. This finding is consistent with two other studies which have also shown that NLRP3 inflammasome did not impact on viral replication during influenza and chikungunya diseases [21, 38] . Nevertheless, the suppression of NLRP3 inflammasome has been demonstrated to decrease fulminant hepatitis and Zika virus replication [10, 13] but increase Newcastle virus replication [9] .

We suggest that NLRP3 inflammasome exerts pro-inflammatory effect during HMPV infection through biological activities of IL-1\u03b2. Indeed, this cytokine has been identified as an important regulator of inflammation, as evidenced by its capacity to stimulate neutrophil and macrophage recruitment and infiltration in some conditions [42, 43] and induce lung vascular permeability damage [44] . IL-1\u03b2 has also been identified as an activator of IL-6 and IL-8 production [45, 46] . Most importantly, we reported that both NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition (BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice) and deletion of the gene encoding IL-1\u03b2 (C57BL/6 mice) induced less weight loss with decreased mortality and inflammation in HMPV-infected mice. Moreover, the protective effect against HMPV disease did not differ between NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition and IL-1\u03b2 deletion (C57BL/6 mice). Briefly, NLRP3 inflammasome-induced IL-1\u03b2 release plays a crucial role during HMPV infection, at least in mice.",

Moreover, this involvement occurs at an early stage of infection process because IL-1\u03b2 levels were only decreased upon NLRP3 inhibitor treatment on day 1 post-infection. This finding is not surprising since IL-1\u03b2 as well as other IL-1 family cytokines are widely considered as early-response cytokines as they are released in the earliest stage of an immune response [48] . By contrast, IL-18 secretion was unaltered during infection and had no influence on the pathogenicity of HMPV in mice. This might be explained by the limited presence of macrophages during HMPV infections, which were shown to be an abundant source of IL-18 during in vitro studies [49] (Fig 1B) . By contrast, polymorphonuclear neutrophils were abundant on day 1 and then lymphocytes were dominant on days 3 and 5 post-infection (Fig 4C) .",

In general, the first signal permitting the generation of pro-IL-1\u03b2 and pro-IL-18 is triggered by the recognition of viral pathogens by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) or retinoic acid-inducible gene-I-like receptors [5] . Herein, we did not investigate the mechanisms by which the first signal occurs. However, we think that the TLR4 receptor may be responsible for this process because a recent study has demonstrated that among various TLRs including TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR7 and TLR8, only TLR4 provides the first signal of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in RSV-infected lung epithelial cells [39] . Furthermore, TLR4 -/mice induced less weight loss, decreased inflammation and no difference in viral replication, as compared to wild-type mice during HMPV infection [50] . These findings are consistent with our results when using either IL-1\u03b2 -/mice or pharmacological approach for blocking NLRP3 inflammasome activation.",

            "text": "Recently, it has been shown that RNA viruses trigger NLRP3 inflammasome activation through a receptor interacting protein (RIP) 1/RIP3/dynamin-related protein 1 signaling pathway [51, 52] . Briefly, RNA virus infection initiates the assembly of RIP1/RIP3 complex, promoting activation of dynamin-related protein 1 and its translocation to mitochondria. This results in mitochondria damage, excessive reactive oxygen species generation and subsequent NLRP3 inflammasome activation [6] . RNA viral components responsible for triggering this pathway have been identified in several viral infections such as influenza virus M2 and PB1-F2 proteins [53] [54] [55] , Measles virus V protein [56] , RSV SH protein [39] , encephalomyocarditis virus and rhinovirus 2B proteins [57, 58] , coronavirus E protein [59] and enterovirus 71 3D protein [60] . Among these proteins, encephalomyocarditis virus and rhinovirus 2B proteins as well as RSV SH protein were recognized as viroporins. Viroporins from RNA viruses have been reported to be responsible for mitochondrial alteration [61] . Furthermore, once inserted on host cell membrane, viroporin will enable virus to tune ion permeability to stimulate a variety of viral cycle stages [62] . Taken together, we hypothesized that HMPV SH protein may be an activator of NLRP3 inflammasome during HMPV disease because it has been suggested to act as a viroporin [63] and the genomic structure of HMPV is closely related to that of RSV [40] .",

Here, we generated HMPV \u0394SH using C85473 strain (group A) to verify our hypothesis [64] . In addition to the blockade of caspase-1 cleavage, a reliable marker of NLRP3 inflammasome activation, resulting from the lack of SH protein or MCC950 treatment, we found that identically to MCC950 treatment, SH deletion had no effect on the viral replication both in vitro and in vivo. This finding is consolidated by previous studies using other HMPV \u0394SH viruses [34, 35] . We also detected that HMPV \u0394SHinfected mice were protected against severe infection, as evidenced by no mortality, less weight loss and reduced inflammation. The evolution of HMPV infections was not different between HMPV \u0394SH-and wild-type HMPV-infected mice receiving MCC950 treatment, but we acknowledge that no measures were taken to detect defective interfering particles in both viral preparations. In parallel, NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition had no influence on the pathogenesis of HMPV \u0394SH. Taken together, we conclude that HMPV SH protein might be an activator of NLRP3 inflammasome in addition to its identified other roles to modulate type I IFN signaling pathway [65, 66] , deteriorate cell host membrane permeability, regulate viral fusogenic function [63] and reduce CD4+ T cell activation [67] .",

Mechanistically, HMPV SH protein triggers NLRP3 inflammasome activation, leading to the cleavage of pro-IL-1\u03b2 to form mature IL-1\u03b2. Although this cytokine is not crucial for controlling viral replication, it plays a major role in inflammatory process which is identified as an important feature for the pathogenicity of HMPV. Thus, the involvement of NLRP3 inflammasome in HMPV disease occurs via IL-1\u03b2-related inflammatory process rather than virus replication. In such a context, we believe that anti-inflammatory treatments in general and anti-IL-1\u03b2 drugs in particular (i.e. the use of NLRP3 inhibitors) may be considered as novel potential strategies for the prevention and treatment of HMPV disease.",

Briefly, the full-length genomic cDNA of HMPV A1/C-85473 strain was generated by RT-PCR using the Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and amplified by Phusion DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Whitby, ON, Canada). A Gibson Assembly (Cloning Kit, New England Biolabs) was performed to integrate the genomic viral cDNA into a pSP72 plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) containing a T7 terminator, the hepatitis delta virus (HDV) ribozyme and a T7 promoter. To generate HMPV \u0394SH virus, the mentioned plasmid was amplified using specific primers, designed to match before the SH gene start sequence (5'-GGGACAAGTA GTTATGGA-3') and after the intergenic SH-G region (5'-ACTCTGATGTGTTTTTACTAA C-3'), in order to extract completely the SH gene sequence. After amplification, linear DNA was phosphorylated and ligated with the T4 Ligase to re-circularize the shortened HMPV genome. The newly generated HMPV \u0394SH genomic plasmid was validated by complete sequencing prior to transfection. BSR-T7 cells were then co-transfected (Lipofectamin 2000, Thermo Fisher Scientific) with the HMPV \u0394SH genomic plasmid and 4 supporting plasmids expressing the N, P, L, and M2.1 viral ORFs. Seven hours after transfection, the medium was replaced by Opti-MEM supplemented with 1% Non-Essential Amino Acids (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Transfected cells were incubated at 37\u02daC and 5% CO2 for four days. At this point, LLC-MK2 cells were added to the transfected BSR T7 cells and co-cultured at 37\u02daC and 5% CO2 with the addition of fresh trypsin (0.0002%) after two days. Two or three days after coculture, cells were harvested, sonicated and centrifuged at 2000 x g for 5 min at room temperature. The supernatant was collected, diluted into infection medium (Opti-MEM supplemented with 0.0002% trypsin), and inoculated onto confluent LLC-MK2 monolayers. Infected monolayers were monitored for the appearance of characteristic cytopathic effect, and the harvested virus was further amplified through serial passages in LLC-MK2 cells.",

Lung homogenates were incubated for 1 h at 37\u02daC then filtered through a 70-\u03bcm cell strainer (BD Biosciences, Mississaugo, ON, Canada). The cell suspension was centrifuged at 300 x g for 10 min at room temperature. The supernatant was aspirated and cells were washed twice with D-PBS plus 2% FBS. Cells were first incubated on ice for 30 min with fixable viability stain 510 (BD Biosciences, CA, USA), then washed and incubated again on ice for 30 min with purified rat anti-mouse CD16/CD32 (Mouse Fc Block; BD Biosciences, CA, USA). Red blood cells were lysed with BD Pharm Lyse (RBC Lysis Buffer 10X -BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA) and the recovered leukocytes were washed and resuspended in D-PBS. After the washing step, cells were incubated on ice for 40 min with a pool of antibodies (anti-CD45, anti-CD11b, anti-CD170 (Siglec-F), anti-Ly6C, anti-Ly6G, anti-CD11c, anti-CD115, anti-B220, anti-CD3\u03b5, anti-CD4 and anti-CD8a /BD Bioscience, CA, USA).
