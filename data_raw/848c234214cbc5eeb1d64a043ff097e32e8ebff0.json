The peptides are pleiotropic effectors of innate immunity, possessing broad spectrum antimicrobial activities and immunoregulatory properties. Here we report that rhesus \u03b8defensin 1 (RTD-1) is highly effective in arresting and reversing joint disease in a rodent model of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Parenteral RTD-1 treatment of DA/OlaHsd rats with established pristane-induced arthritis (PIA) rapidly suppressed joint disease progression, restored limb mobility, and preserved normal joint architecture. RTD-1 significantly reduced joint IL-1\u03b2 levels compared with controls. RTD-1 dose-dependently inhibited fibroblast-like synoviocyte (FLS) invasiveness and FLS IL-6 production. Consistent with the inhibition of FLS invasiveness, RTD-1 was a potent inhibitor of arthritogenic proteases including ADAMs 17 and 10 which activate TNF\u03b1, and inhibited matrix metalloproteases, and cathepsin K. RTD-1 was non-toxic, non-immunogenic, and effective when administered as infrequently as once every five days. Thus \u03b8-defensins, which are absent in humans, have potential as retroevolutionary biologics for the treatment of RA.",

Disease severity was assessed by at least two scorers and the inter-rater agreement (kappa) value was 0.806 as determined using MedCalc Statistical Software version 14.8.1 (MedCalc Software, Ostend, Belgium). In three separate trials, treatment was also blinded to scorers. There was no statistical difference between blinded and unblinded scoring of any treatment cohort. Treatment with saline (vehicle), RTD-1, or anti-arthritic agents was randomized and initiated when an animal first presented with an AS of 3 or more. RTD-1 was administered subcutaneously with doses ranging from 0.2 to 5.0 mg/kg in an injection volume of 0.5 ml at intervals ranging from once a day (qd) to once every seven days (q7d). MTX was administered at 0.25 mg/kg by intraperitoneal injection q3d [19] . Etanercept was administered at 0.4 mg/kg by subcutaneous injection q3d [20, 21] .",

Peptide treatment produced a rapid reduction in arthritis severity, which reached statistical significance within 48 hours of the start of treatment (P < 0.044), with complete resolution of clinical disease in all RTD-1 treated rats by day 15 ( Fig 3A) . As with animals treated in early PIA (Fig  2A) , RTD-1 treatment of animals with severe PIA restored normal limb function and mobility (S2 Video). Of note, after a disease-free interval ranging from 4-12 weeks, three of five RTD-1 treated animals relapsed with joint disease (average AS score of~3). Efficacy of RTD-1 treatment was compared with etanercept (Etan) and methotrexate (MTX), first line RA drugs that have also been studied in rodent models of arthritis such as rat PIA [1, [19] [20] [21] [22] .

We therefore analyzed the effect of RTD-1 administration on joint levels of IL-1\u03b2 in PIA rats. Consistent with other studies, IL-1\u03b2 was not detectable in joints of na\u00efve rats, but levels were markedly elevated in diseased joints of PIA rats and joint IL-1\u03b2 levels correlated with arthritis severity score of the corresponding limb (Pearson r = 0.4923, Fig 2. Efficacy of RTD-1 in rat PIA. A. DA rats with established PIA were treated s.c. daily with RTD-1 (5 mg/kg) or vehicle (saline), with cohort randomization as described in Methods. RTD-1 treatment reduced arthritis severity scores within 24 h compared to control (* P = 0.0064), and therapeutic efficacy increased with duration of treatment (** P < 0.001; *** P < 0.0001, mean \u00b1 95% CI, results of 6 independent experiments with n = 5-10 animals per treatment group per experiment).

Representative images (10X magnification, bar = 500 \u03bcm) show gross and histologic features of hind extremities from na\u00efve, saline-treated PIA rats (daily s.c. x 11 days), and RTD-1 treated PIA rats (daily s.c. 3 mg/kg for 9 or 11 days; see S1 Fig for additional examples of normal, PIA, and RTD-1-treated joint histology). Joints from saline-treated PIA rats show synovial hyperplasia, invasive pannus, and disruption of joint architecture (panels 6-8). RTD-1 treatment of PIA rats resulted in marked resolution of paw swelling as well as preservation of a normal joint architecture (panels 9-12).",

Surprisingly, RTD-1 also inhibited cysteine cathepsins B, C, K, L, and V, with its greatest potency against cathepsin K (IC 50~2 7 nM; Table 1 ). Cathepsin K is the protease primarily responsible for degradation of bone matrix by osteoclasts [40] . These data indicate that RTD-1 is a cross class anti-protease that inhibits TNF\u03b1 activation and matrix degrading proteinases implicated in RA joint damage.",

            "text": "Despite advances in RA treatment over the past 15 years, there persists an unmet need for more widely effective therapies given the significant fraction of patients who are partial responders or who are ineligible candidates for existing drugs [4] . Previous studies disclosed that RTD-1 modulates inflammatory cytokine expression in rodent infectious disease models [9, 14] and in immune-stimulated human leukocytes [9, 15] . In those studies, arthritogenic cytokines (TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6) were among those down-regulated by RTD-1. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that RTD-1 would alter the course of disease in a rodent model of RA wherein disease onset and progression are driven by TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6. The PIA rats after 4 daily 5 mg/kg s.c. treatments compared to vehicle controls (brackets indicate number of paw-ankle joints). Data are shown as IL-1\u03b2 levels in individual joint samples with medians with interquartile ranges indicated. C. RTD-1 (10 \u03bcg/ml) suppressed (3 or 10 ng/ml) TNF\u03b1-and IL-1\u03b2-stimulated production of IL-6 by cultured FLS (* P < 0.05, ** P = 0.0059) (mean + SE, n = 12; results of 3 independent experiments). D. RTD-1 dose-dependently suppressed proliferation of cultured DA-PIA-FLS. FLS cell numbers were quantified after 0, 24, and 48 h incubation with RTD-1 at the indicated concentrations (* P = 0.0023, ** P = 0.0243, *** P < 0.0001, P-values relate differences in cell proliferation relative to peptide free controls at corresponding time points) (mean + SE, n = 7, results of 2 independent experiments). E. RTD-1 suppressed invasion of FLS from PIA rats in a dose-dependent manner, with minimal cytotoxicity (percent viable cells above bars, n = 2). F. The anti-invasive effects of RTD-1 on 7 independently isolated rat FLS cell lines were analyzed (as in panel E). Incubation with 0.1 \u03bcg/ml RTD-1 inhibited invasion by 50% (mean \u00b1 95% CI) obtained using 7 different rat DA cell lines.",

            "text": "Here we report that RTD-1, the prototype \u03b8-defensin, rapidly arrests PIA in DA rats and peptide treatment resulted in high rates of disease resolution. Therapeutic effects were rapid, and dose level and dose interval dependent. RTD-1 induced disease resolution more effectively than a TNF\u03b1 inhibitor or MTX, and at rates exceeding that reported using a mouse anti-TNF\u03b1 antibody [45] , or the < 10% remission rate observed in treated RA patients [46] . Moreover, arrest of disease progression and resolution of arthritis was obtained with RTD-1 treatment in early and in severe stages of PIA, and therapeutic responses correlated with marked reductions in limb swelling, and recovery of limb function and mobility. In our studies on the effect of RTD-1 on evolving disease, resolution of clinical arthritis corresponded to histologic joint morphology which disclosed that treated animals had essentially normal joint structures whereas those from control animals showed severe pannus formation, chronic inflammation, and erosion ( Fig 2C and S1 Fig) . In this study, we did not perform histologic evaluation of joints from RTD-1 treated animals with maximum established disease (Fig 3A) . Of note, peptide treatment of severely arthritic animals induced a higher frequency of complete clinical resolution (Fig 3A; S2 Video) than occurred with treatment of animals with evolving disease (Fig  2B) , and this may be of translational significance since treatment of RA is usually initiated once disease is well established. We hypothesize that this somewhat paradoxical finding reflects pleiotropic anti-arthritic RTD-1 mechanisms which differentially affect the pathophysiology of evolving and established severe disease. Studies are underway to identify pathologic and/or resolution-promoting processes modulated by RTD-1 at different stages of PIA. Evaluation of the effect of RTD-1 in another animal model of RA, such as collagen induced arthritis, is likely to provide additional insights into anti-arthritic mechanisms mediated by \u03b8-defensins.",

For example, down-regulation of inflammatory cytokine expression has been shown to occur at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, the former revealed in studies on THP-1 macrophages wherein RTD-1 was shown to down-regulate MAP kinases and NF-B activation, inhibiting transcription of TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-8, CCL-3, and CCL-4 [15] . Post-translational regulation of arthritogenic mediators is exemplified by the rapid and potent inhibition of ADAM17 by RTD-1 which blocks TNF\u03b1 release [39] . Consistent with this effect, RTD-1 treatment of PIA rats suppressed expression of joint IL-1\u03b2, a central mediator of arthritis which is upregulated by TNF\u03b1 [35, 47] . RTD-1 also acts directly on FLS to reduce the production of IL-6 and reduces cell invasiveness, two processes involved in joint damage. Studies are underway to further delineate the pathways that mediate RTD-1 modulation of other inflammatory/ arthritogenic cytokine networks implicated in RA.",

The inhibitory potency of RTD-1 against a panel of MMPs and cathepsins varies substantially, but plasma levels (C max ) achieved following s.c. treatment approximate or exceed the IC 50 s of ADAM17 and cathepsin K, potentially providing a rapid mechanism for regulating these arthritogenic proteases, in the former case down-regulating local TNF\u03b1 levels and downstream effects (e.g., IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, MMP expression).

RTD-1 itself is a pharmaceutical candidate as this naturally occurring molecule is well tolerated when administered subcutaneously (this study and ref. [9] ), and by intravenous, intramuscular, and intraperitoneal routes (our unpublished results). RTD-1 was non-immunogenic (Fig 5) , circumventing the development of neutralizing antibodies, a problem encountered by a subset of patients in response to biologic therapeutics [50] . Further, RTD-1 is highly stable in biological matrices [9] , has an unusually long terminal half-life allowing for infrequent dosing (Fig 4) , and shows no evidence of being immuno-compromising [9, 14] . The concept of using a nonhuman primate peptide represents a novel retroevolutionary therapeutic paradigm whereby products of genes expressed in Old World monkeys may be used to treat a human autoimmune disorder.",

PIA rats receiving daily s.c. injection with 3 or 5 mg/kg of RTD-1 responded with significant (P 0.0015) and similar reductions in AS, compared to vehicle control, by treatment day 3. Dosing with 1 mg/kg RTD-1 resulted in modest, but not statistically significant reductions in AS, and dosing with 0.2 mg/kg produced no therapeutic effect (mean \u00b1 95% CI, results of 2 independent experiments). B. S.c. injection of PIA rats with 5 mg/kg of RTD-1 daily, or once every 2, 3, or 5 days produced equivalent disease resolution (mean + 95% CI, n = 5 per treatment group, results of single experiment). AS were recorded every day and plotted every other day for clarity. C. Pharmacokinetics of s.c. administered RTD-1 was analyzed in Sprague Dawley rats (n = 4) that received a single 5 mg/kg s.c. dose of RTD-1. RTD-1 is rapidly distributed with clearance and half-life of22.3 ml/kg/h and 0.285 h, respectively.
