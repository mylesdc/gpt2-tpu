Respiratory viruses are the most common cause of such infections and the introduction of molecular detection techniques has considerably improved the detection of these pathogens. Indeed, new multiplex PCR tests now allow a fast detection of a wide range of respiratory viruses [1] including recently described viruses as human metapneumovirus [2] , human bocavirus [3] and coronavirus NL63 [4] or HKU1 [5] . Molecular tests also changed the understanding of some older respiratory viruses group such as for rhinovirus, commonly associated only with the common cold and now described as providing severe ARTIs in young children [6] [7] [8] . Despite these new knowledges only a few respiratory viruses, such as RSV or metapneumovirus, have been well established as highly pathogenic [9, 10] . The causative role of other respiratory viruses is still discussed, mainly as they can be also detected in asymptomatic patients, especially during childhood [11] [12] [13] [14] .",

            "text": "PCR tests use is largely increasing for respiratory virus's detection but is still limited by their high cost. Several works studied the cost-effectiveness of rapid multiplex PCR (m-PCR) testing in emergency department and demonstrated a slight cost-effectiveness of such approaches [15, 16] . Despite these few studies, international recommendations are still unclear about respiratory viruses testing and their use in clinical care. Thus, the American Association of Paediatrics do not recommend to use any respiratory viruses test [17, 18] . The Paediatric Infectious Disease Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommend to use sensitive and specific tests for rapid respiratory viruses' detection in children above three months of age with community acquired pneumonia [19] . Yet, it does not provide recommendation about younger children. Moreover, stopping antibiotic therapies is recommended for influenza viruses but the recommendations do not statute about other respiratory viruses. Finally, the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health and European Society of Paediatric Infectious Diseases states the increasing availability of PCR viral testing, but does not provide any recommendation about their use or management of positive results [20] . This lack of recommendation is explained by the few number of cost-effectiveness studies and the physician's reluctance to reduce the antibiotic use and other investigations (urine and blood testing) when a virus is detected [16] . Thus, the use of multiplex PCR tests and their benefits for respiratory viruses' detection in clinical settings still need to be reinforced. In France, to our knowledge, only two studies using mPCR have been conducted in children. Both of these studies were conducted during a single winter season. The first study was conducted in Caen teaching hospital during the particular winter season 2009-2010 and demonstrated the high level of non-RSV and non-flu viruses during this period [21] . The second study was conducted in Toulouse teaching hospital during the winter season 2010-2011 in children attending the emergency unit [22] . These both studies demonstrated a high level of non-RSV non-flu viruses (53 and 46%, respectively) during; or the year after, the particular influenza A H1N1v2009 pandemic. These observations may be useful to be verified over a larger period of time, with a comparison to the adults' population during the same period of time and especially since the re-emergence of influenza A H3N2 strains that represent the majority of influenza A circulating after the H1N1v2009 pandemic [23, 24] . This retrospective study was conducted over a large three-year period, from 2011 to 2014, in a French teaching hospitals group. We describe the distribution of respiratory viruses using mPCR, across age strata, clinical units and seasons.",

The results confirm some of the previous observations made in two other France area, Toulouse and Caen, and during the influenza A H1N1 v2009 emergence period [21, 22] . We also completed these previous observations by the analysis of respiratory viruses outside the winter period and by comparing the main differences observed between children and adults' populations. We also observed the number of respiratory viruses identified after a negative RSV specific testing. These observations are of importance in order to have a better opinion and view of the diagnosis missed by the current practice in France where only RSV and influenza specific testing are recommended during the epidemic periods and no testing at all outside these periods. We underlined the huge variations of positivity rate and viral distribution of respiratory viruses among various children age groups. Neonatology units presented lower positivity and viral coinfection rates than paediatric units and interestingly closer to those observed in the adult's population but with a different distribution of respiratory viruses. Thus, this population presented an overrepresentation of picornavirus among all our studied population. In paediatric units, influenza and RSV were never the majority group of viruses identified in our study in all children age strata. Even during the influenza epidemic periods, influenza represented only 6.9% of all identified viruses in children using mPCR. Concerning RSV, the prevalence reached a peak among the 0-6 month's age strata but at only 16.2% of all identified viruses using mPCR. Even during the specific RSV epidemic period only 28.6 and 31.3% of children in paediatric units were positive for RSV using mPCR or RSV-IC, respectively. These observations are in line with previous studies in France [21, 22] . Moreover, the number of other viruses identified during the same period was high in our work: 46.7% of children tested by mPCR in our study during RSV epidemic period were positive for any other respiratory viruses. This pattern was similar in all our children populations. Even when the clinical symptoms conducted the physician to request a RSV-IC test, only 31.3% were positive and 63.6% of negative RSV-IC were positive with another respiratory viruses when tested by mPCR. Taken together, these results underline that RSV testing is badly suited for respiratory viruses' detection in all children population and may lead to non-optimal care decision such as unnecessary antibiotic use, laboratory testing, radiologic exams or hospitalisations. The lack of a complete respiratory viruses' detection may also lead to unnecessary isolation or an underestimation of the nosocomial epidemics.",

This is a retrospective epidemiological study without clinical information or assessment of the impact of mPCR on patients' management that still need to be assessed by specific prospective studies. Another limitation is the use of different mPCR tests. However, the performances of all these tests are similar in both literature and our local validation processes. Concerning bocaviruses, they were not detected by two of our mPCR kits, representing 51.2% of all tested samples. However, this virus group is rare in France and was only detected in 8 samples (5.2% of all samples tested with Respifinder 1 22) comprising 3 bocavirus mono-infections and 5 viral co-infections.",

However, detection of all respiratory viruses already allows to a better understanding of viral epidemics at a local and a global scale. For example, in our study, the comparison of results obtained using mPCR in adults and children populations showed some discrepancies as for parainfluenza viruses absent from children in 2014 but heavily circulating in adults population, or for adenovirus overrepresented in children in 2011 but absent in adults. This last event may be in line with some reports about a deadly adenovirus outbreak in children observed in Asia during the same period of time [31] [32] [33] , suggesting that this outbreak may also have occurred in Europe with the same strains. Unfortunately, samples have not been stored in our hospital and we are not able to investigate this point. A monitoring in real time of all respiratory viruses, only possible by a larger use of mPCR, may help us to identify and explore more closely these specific epidemics.",

These tests may be useful in order to decrease antibiotic treatment and unnecessary invasive investigations such as blood culture test or radiological exams. To date, the exact role of mPCR is not identified in national or international guidelines, because a lack of consensus on the management of infected children and the few number of cost-effectiveness studies [16] . However, even with the lack of strong cost-effectiveness studies, these tests are already useful for enhanced isolation and management decisions of children presenting severe symptoms, especially for severe respiratory viruses including influenza and RSV, but also para-influenza or metapneumovirus [12, 13, 34] . Viral co-infections, frequent among children, may also be more easily detected allowing better cohorting decisions.",

Global positivity rate was 51.4% (196 samples), 9.2% (35 samples) corresponded to viral co-infections. Frequencies of positive and viral co-infection results across age groups are depicted in Fig 1. The identified viruses were picornavirus (n = 125, 52.7%), RSV (26, 11.0%), adenovirus (26, 11.0%), parainfluenza (17, 7.2%), metapneumovirus (14, 5.9%), coronavirus (13, 5.5%), influenza (8, 3.4%) and bocavirus (8, 5.2% of all identified viruses with Respifinder 1 22 only able to detect this virus group). In comparison, 3142 adults' samples were included during the same period among 2103 patients. The median delay between two inclusions for a same patient (n = 1039 samples) was 106 days [IQR = 57-243]. No patient was included a second time if there is less than 30 days since the previous sample. The adult population showed a lower positivity rate (51.4 vs 33.1%, p = 0.009) and a lower viral co-infection rate (9.2 vs 1.9%, p<0.001). Viral distribution was statistically different between adults and children (p<0.001)(Fig 2). Three virus groups were more represented in children: adenovirus (11 vs 3.9%, p<0.001), picornavirus (52.7 vs 34.4%; p<0.001) and bocavirus (3.4 vs 0.6%; p = 0.002). On the contrary, two viruses' groups were less represented among children: influenza (3.4 vs 21.5%; p<0.001) and coronavirus (5.5 vs 12.6%; p = 0.002). RSV, metapneumovirus and parainfluenza groups presented similar prevalence in both populations.",
