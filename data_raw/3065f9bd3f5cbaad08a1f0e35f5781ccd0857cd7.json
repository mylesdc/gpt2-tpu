            "text": "Background: In response to an unexpected long cold spell in February 1996 which killed more than 100 older adults (mostly living alone) in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Senior Citizen Home Safety Association established a Personal Emergency Link Service to provide emergency contact to the older adults, which uses a telephone system to render emergency relief and total care service around the clock. To facilitate the dynamic and efficient allocation of service resources, it is crucial to understand the factors linked with use of the services and number of hospital admissions arising from PE link service. Methods: We initially use the Poisson generalized linear model (GLM) with polynomial effect functions of relevant covariates. If the time series of residuals from fitting the Poisson GLM reveals significant serial correlation, a Poisson generalized linear autoregressive moving average (GLARMA) model is refitted to the data to account for the auto-correlation among the time series of daily call numbers. If the data is overdispersed relative to the best fitting Poisson GLARMA model, then the negative binomial GLARMA model is refitted to account for any overdispersion. In all the models, dummy variables for weekdays and months are included to account for any cyclic trends due weekday effect or month of the year effect. The secular time trend is modeled by a polynomial function of calendar time over the study period. Finally any critical temperatures are identified by visually inspecting the graph of the effect function of temperature. Results: The weekday and month effects are both significant with Monday seeing more PE Link calls than Sunday and June seeing less than January. Temperature has significant effect on the PE Link call rate with the effect highly nonlinear. A critical temperature, below which excessive increase in PE link calls that lead to hospital admissions, is identified to be around 15\u00b0C. Conclusion: Identifying a threshold temperature which generates an excessive increase in the expected number of PE Link calls would be useful in service provision planning and support for elderly in need of hospital admission.",

            "text": "There is substantial variation in the daily numbers of calls received in the Center. To facilitate appropriate and efficient resource allocation it is desirable to be able to predict the intensity of service use based on factors that can be predicted with reasonable accuracy, such as weather conditions. To this end it is important to study the relation of the service use intensity and the weather conditions (for example, temperature and humidity) based on historical data. A recent work [1] about the association between the frequency of such PE Link calls and meteorological factors found that the effect of temperature on the call frequency was statistically significant and the effect function was roughly U-shaped. When the temperature reached about 30-32\u00b0C, the health related PE Link call frequency started to increase. The major concern of the study was the negative impact of hot weather on health, and only used data in warm seasons in Hong Kong. A more recent study [2] on the association between hospital admissions and weather and other environmental variables in Hong Kong found increased admissions were linked to increases of temperature above a threshold during warm seasons and decreases of temperature below a threshold during cold seasons. Another study [3] also found strong associations between cold weather and mortality rate in Hong Kong and Taiwan during cold seasons. The main purpose of the current work is to examine the association between the frequency of PE Link calls that lead to hospital admissions and meteorological factors, especially cold weather, using year-around data regardless of the season.",

This motivated us to consider the Poisson GLM (Generalized Linear Model) regression as a first attempt. The response variable is the daily number of PE Link calls received by the call center that lead to hospital admissions. The explanatory variables included the daily temperature, the humidity and the range of temperature fluctuations. As our main concern is the impact of cold weather on service use, the temperature variable we use is the daily minimum temperature. The daily temperature range was calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum recorded temperatures. Since previous studies suggest the effect of weather on health status tends to be nonlinear [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] , the impact of each of these meteorological variables was modeled as a polynomial function over the respective range of the variable. The degrees of the polynomials were selected using a popular model selection method, the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) [7] .",

As previous studies suggests that the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003 might have influenced Smoothed call rate at a specific temperature (or another variable) value was calculated by averaging all call rates associated with the specific temperature (or another variable) value the call rate as well [8] , the indicator for the duration of the SARS epidemic in Hong Kong, 4 Feb-21 May 2003, was also included in the model.",

The graphs shows somewhat similar relationships between call rate and temperature at different lags up to 34 days. This is not surprising as the time series of temperature shows strong autocorrelation that persists across different lags. In fact, the auto-correlation at lags 1-34 range from 0.952 to 0.643. Similar auto-correlation among the humidity and temperature range variables was also observed; see Figs. 3 and 4 for the graphs of the average call rate against humidity and temperature range respectively at different lags.

The degrees selected were 5 for temperature, 1 for humidity, 1 for temperature range, and 19 for time trend. Upon inspection of the model fit with these as the degrees of the respective polynomial effect functions, the term associated with humidity was found insignificant, and therefore was dropped from the model for further reduced AIC value and simplified model. In the simplified model the indicator variable for the SARS pandemic was also insignificant and therefore dropped. The significant terms remaining in the thus simplified best fitting Poisson GLM are the 5th degree polynomial of temperature, the 1st degree polynomial (linear) function of temperature range, the terms for weekday effects, the terms for month effects, and the 19th degree polynomial for the secular time trend. Inspection of the time series of the Pearson residuals from fitting the simplified model revealed significant auto-correlation at lags 1, 5, 13, 19, 23, and 33. Refitting a Poisson GLARMA model with these as the auto-regressive lags to the data left no significant autocorrelation among the residual time series. The residual deviance after fitting the Poisson GLARMA model was 2741.1 on 2109 degrees of freedom, indicating moderate overdispersion of data relative to the Poisson model. Therefore, a negative binomial GLARMA model was refitted to the data. The diagnostic plots for this model are shown in Fig. 5 . It reveals fitted values for the response closely tracing the observed counts, white-noise looking residual time series that have no trend or serial correlation, and uniformly distributed PIT (Probability Integral Transform) residuals [11, 12] .

            "text": "We have made an attempt to model the time series of the daily numbers of PE Link calls that lead to hospital admissions in Hong Kong. A negative binomial generalized linear auto-regressive moving-average model was found to afford adequate fit to the data. Our analysis reveals that temperature is a significant predictor for call numbers. We found the effect of the average temperature to be highly nonlinear and roughly U-shaped. The finding aligns wells with previous researches about the effect of weather on various measures of health status. By inspecting the effect function of temperature, we were able to identify a cold temperature threshold of about 15\u00b0C, which triggers excessive PE Link calls. Our findings are potentially useful in assisting the SCHSA with service planning and resource allocation.",
