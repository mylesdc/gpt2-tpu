            "text": "Yellow fever virus (YFV) is an arthropod-borne flavivirus, infecting 200,000 people worldwide annually and causing about 30,000 deaths. The live attenuated vaccine strain, YFV-17D, has significantly contributed in controlling the global burden of yellow fever worldwide. However, the viral and host contributions to YFV-17D attenuation remain elusive. Type I interferon (IFN-\u2423/\u2424) signaling and type II interferon (IFN-\u2425) signaling have been shown to be mutually supportive in controlling YFV-17D infection despite distinct mechanisms of action in viral infection. However, it remains unclear how type III IFN (IFN-) integrates into this antiviral system. Here, we report that while wild-type (WT) and IFN-receptor knockout (R \u03ea/\u03ea ) mice were largely resistant to YFV-17D, deficiency in type I IFN signaling resulted in robust infection. Although IFN-\u2423/\u2424 receptor knockout (\u2423/\u2424R \u03ea/\u03ea ) mice survived the infection, mice with combined deficiencies in both type I signaling and type III IFN signaling were hypersusceptible to YFV-17D and succumbed to the infection. Mortality was associated with viral neuroinvasion and increased permeability of the bloodbrain barrier (BBB). \u2423/\u2424R \u03ea/\u03ea R \u03ea/\u03ea mice also exhibited distinct changes in the frequencies of multiple immune cell lineages, impaired T-cell activation, and severe perturbation of the proinflammatory cytokine balance. Taken together, our data highlight that type III IFN has critical immunomodulatory and neuroprotective functions that prevent viral neuroinvasion during active YFV-17D replication. Type III IFN thus likely represents a safeguard mechanism crucial for controlling YFV-17D infection and contributing to shaping vaccine immunogenicity.",

            "text": "IMPORTANCE YFV-17D is a live attenuated flavivirus vaccine strain recognized as one of the most effective vaccines ever developed. However, the host and viral determinants governing YFV-17D attenuation and its potent immunogenicity are still unknown. Here, we analyzed the role of type III interferon (IFN)-mediated signaling, a host immune defense mechanism, in controlling YFV-17D infection and attenuation in different mouse models. We uncovered a critical role of type III IFN-mediated signaling in preserving the integrity of the blood-brain barrier and preventing viral brain invasion. Type III IFN also played a major role in regulating the induction of a potent but balanced immune response that prevented viral evasion of the host immune system. An improved understanding of the complex mechanisms regulating YFV-17D attenuation will provide insights into the key virus-host interactions that regulate host immune responses and infection outcomes as well as open novel avenues for the development of innovative vaccine strategies. KEYWORDS flavivirus, innate immunity, interferons, live vector vaccines, yellow fever virus A rthropod-borne flaviviruses such as dengue virus (DENV), yellow fever virus (YFV), and Zika virus (ZIKV) are a cause of major health concerns worldwide (1) (2) (3) . With a mortality rate of up to 25% to 50%, YFV infection is one of the most severe flavivirus infections and is responsible for around 200,000 new infections and 30,000 deaths each year (2) . The YFV live attenuated strain YFV-17D is one of the safest and most potent vaccines ever developed (4) . The vaccination of more than 500 million individuals over the past 80 years has significantly contributed to the prevention of YFV outbreaks (4) . However, vaccination coverage has decreased over the last few decades, and recent outbreaks in Africa and South America have highlighted the urgent need for reassessing strategies to control YFV infection worldwide (5) .",

YFV-17D differs from its virulent counterpart, YFV-Asibi, by only 32 amino acids (6) . However, despite this close genetic proximity, the differential interactions of YFV and YFV-17D with the human host that determine infection outcome remain unknown. A major limitation in understanding this lies in the restricted human and nonhuman primate tropism of YFV and the lack of proper animal models.

            "text": "Interferons (IFNs) are cytokines that play a critical role in the proper induction and maintenance of innate and adaptive immunity (9, 10) . There are three known classes of interferons, type I, type II, and type III, which signal through heterodimeric receptors distinct for each IFN type. The type I IFN family, which consists of 17 members, induces signaling through the IFN-\u2423/\u2424 receptor (IFN-\u2423/\u2424R). Type I IFN is responsible for the immune response to many viruses, such as lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), Semliki Forest virus, and vesicular stomatitis virus (11) , and can inhibit YFV-Asibi and YFV-17D infection in mice (7, 12, 13) . The effect of type I IFNs is apparently species specific, as both YFV-17D and virulent YFV can escape the human type I IFN-induced antiviral state (14, 15) . Consistently, genetic disruption of type I IFN signaling renders mice highly susceptible to YFV-Asibi infection with a lethal outcome (12) . In contrast, YFV-17D extensively replicates and induces an antigen-specific T-cell response in infected IFN-\u2423/\u2424R-deficient mice before ultimately being cleared (16) . Consequently, despite the compromised functionality of their innate immune system and an absence of human-specific interactions, mice with impaired type I IFN signaling are regularly used to model YFV pathogenesis and immunogenicity. They represent an interesting complementary tool for evaluating the contribution of host determinants of YFV pathogenesis or YFV-17D attenuation prior to experiments in more relevant models such as macaques or humanized mice.",

IFN-\u2425 is produced by a variety of immune cells, including natural killer (NK) cells, NK T cells, innate lymphoid cells (ILC), and CD4 \u03e9 and CD8 \u03e9 T cells. Type II IFN is critical for combating many bacterial and parasitic and certain viral infections, although type II IFN alone seems to be of limited importance for clearing a majority of viruses (11) . Accordingly, mice lacking IFN-\u2425R are not susceptible to virulent YFV infection or to YFV-17D infection (12) . However, IFN-\u2425 does play a major role during the late stage of infection when the innate immune system has failed to control the early stages of infection and the adaptive immune response is induced. Indeed, as YFV-17D clearance requires the induction of adaptive immunity in IFN-\u2423/\u2424R \u03ea/\u03ea mice, infection is lethal in IFN-\u2423/\u2424R \u03ea/\u03ea IFN-\u2425R \u03ea/\u03ea mice (12) .",

In contrast to IFN-\u2423/\u2424R, which is broadly expressed among all nucleated cells, IFN-R is preferentially expressed on epithelial surfaces (19, 20) . Thus, type III IFN-mediated signaling conceivably plays a unique role in protecting epithelial barriers by the activity of a more localized and balanced immune response.

IFN-\u2423/\u2424R \u03ea/\u03ea mice exhibited prolonged viremia following YFV-17D infection and induction of adaptive immune responses but did not succumb to infection.

YFV-17D neurovirulence in rhesus macaques has been characterized by the presence of perivascular cuffs and infiltrating mononuclear inflammatory cells in the brain cortex, leading to the destruction of neuronal cells and neuronophagia (24) . At day 5 postinfection, all infected brains, regardless of the mouse model, exhibited signs of neuropil vacuolization (or spongiosis) in the brain cortex consistent with all mouse models exhibiting brain viremia (Fig. 3A) . This histopathological manifestation has been previously reported during WNV brain invasion (27, 28) and other neurovirulent flavivirus infections (29) .

No significant acute/chronic inflammations, hepatocellular changes, fibrosis, or necrosis was observed in these two mouse models compared to noninfected mice or infected WT or R \u03ea/\u03ea mice (data not shown). This adds to the evidence that viral replication in the liver is not directly involved in the pathogenesis observed in \u2423\u2424R \u03ea/\u03ea R \u03ea/\u03ea mice, as suggested by similar levels of viral replication in \u2423\u2424R \u03ea/\u03ea mice.

IFN-\u2423\u2424 and IFN-have previously been reported to regulate the permeability of the BBB during WNV infection (22, 30) . Thus, we hypothesized that YFV-17D neuroinvasion might also be aided by changes in the permeability of the BBB of \u2423\u2424R \u03ea/\u03ea R \u03ea/\u03ea mice during infection. To directly test this hypothesis, we infected WT, \u2423\u2424R \u03ea/\u03ea , R \u03ea/\u03ea , and \u2423\u2424R \u03ea/\u03ea R \u03ea/\u03ea mice with YFV-17D (10 7 PFU) and injected them intravenously with Evans blue dye just prior to sacrifice and tissue collection.

We then evaluated whether a lack of type III IFN signaling could impact the dynamics of immune subsets in response to YFV-17D infection, hence favoring virus immune evasion and subsequent neuroinvasion. In the spleen, depletion of type III IFN signaling alone resulted in significantly higher numbers of conventional dendritic cells (cDCs), plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), and monocytes (MN) upon YFV-17D infection, as well as a decrease in the levels of B cells (Fig. 5A) . Moreover, the number of spleen-resident macrophages decreased upon infection in WT and \u2423\u2424R \u03ea/\u03ea mice but not in R \u03ea/\u03ea and \u2423\u2424R \u03ea/\u03ea R \u03ea/\u03ea mice.

Moreover, a decrease in the levels of CD44 \u03ea CD62L \u03e9 CD4 \u03e9 and CD8 \u03e9 T cells and an increase in the levels of CD45RA \u03ea CD62L \u03ea CD8 \u03e9 T cells were observed in \u2423\u2424R \u03ea/\u03ea and \u2423\u2424R \u03ea/\u03ea R \u03ea/\u03ea mice (Fig. 6A ). Taken together, these data suggest that YFV-17D infection in \u2423\u2424R \u03ea/\u03ea and \u2423\u2424R \u03ea/\u03ea R \u03ea/\u03ea mice primes effector CD4 \u03e9 and CD8 \u03e9 T cells, which can then migrate to peripheral tissues. The observed increase in the levels of CD45RA \u03ea PD1 \u03e9 CD4 \u03e9 T cells and CD45RA \u03ea CD62L \u03ea CD8 \u03e9 T cells in \u2423\u2424R \u03ea/\u03ea and \u2423\u2424R \u03ea/\u03ea R \u03ea/\u03ea mice supports this conclusion (Fig. 6A ). In the liver, increases in the number of effector CD62L \u03ea CD44 \u03e9 CD4 \u03e9 T cells and CD8 \u03e9 T cells were also observed (Fig. S2B ). In the blood, more-pronounced CD27 and CD28 expression among CD4 \u03e9 T cells in \u2423\u2424R \u03ea/\u03ea and \u2423\u2424R \u03ea/\u03ea R \u03ea/\u03ea mice underscored a potential CD4 \u03e9 T-cell activation, and an increase in the numbers of CD62L \u03ea CD44 \u03e9 CD4 \u03e9 T cells suggested the development of peripheral effector CD4 \u03e9 T-cell populations (Fig. 6B) . Similarly, peripheral CD62L \u03ea CD45RA \u03ea and CD62L \u03ea CD44 \u03e9 CD8 \u03e9 T cells were more prominent in \u2423\u2424R \u03ea/\u03ea and \u2423\u2424R \u03ea/\u03ea R \u03ea/\u03ea mice, highlighting an increase in the effector CD8 \u03e9 T-cell population in the periphery (Fig. 6B) . However, only partial T-cell activation was found in \u2423\u2424R \u03ea/\u03ea R \u03ea/\u03ea mice. Although the CD45RA \u03ea CD127 \u03ea and CD45RA \u03ea CCR7 \u03ea CD4 \u03e9 T-cell populations were stable upon YFV-17D infection in the spleen of \u2423\u2424R \u03ea/\u03ea mice, these populations experienced a significant decrease in the spleen of \u2423\u2424R \u03ea/\u03ea R \u03ea/\u03ea mice (Fig. 6C) .

Induction of a protective immune response to YFV-17D is likely Role of Type I and III in YFV Infection \u00ae dependent on the potent ability of YFV-17D to replicate in human cells (23) . During the induction of protective immunity in response to live attenuated virus, tight control of YFV-17D replication by the host is likely still required to attenuate virulence and prevent evasion of the immune response while adaptive immunity is being established. However, the mechanisms governing this tight balance between viral attenuation and immunogenicity are incompletely characterized. Although the role of type I and type II IFN signaling has been previously explored in mouse models (7, 12, 13) , the role of type III IFN signaling in controlling YFV-17D infection is less well defined. We found that when YFV-17D actively replicates, type III IFN is critical for controlling even attenuated YFV and for maintaining proper host immune responses. Indeed, a significantly larger fraction of \u2423\u2424R \u03ea/\u03ea R \u03ea/\u03ea mice than \u2423\u2424R \u03ea/\u03ea mice died upon YFV-17D infection. This phenotype was associated with severe neuroinvasion and increased BBB permeability. Abrogation of type III IFN signaling also significantly impacted the frequencies of multiple immune cell lineages upon infection and impaired T-cell activation, suggesting a profound impact of type III IFN on sustaining an effective host immune response while YFV-17D is actively replicating. Finally, type III IFN also appeared to be important for regulating proinflammatory cytokine secretion. Taken together, results from our study support a model in which severe viral neuroinvasion in \u2423\u2424R \u03ea/\u03ea R \u03ea/\u03ea mice could be caused by the convergence of three major elements: active viral replication, increased BBB permeability, and immune function dysregulation (also associated with severe proinflammatory cytokine secretion) (Fig. 8A ). Our work highlights the critical immunoregulatory and neuroprotective functions of type III IFN signaling for controlling replicating live attenuated flavivirus in vivo, as well as for maintaining a suitable immunological environment for the induction of a potent adaptive immune response.",

            "text": "Previous studies provided evidence that both YFV infection and YFV-17D infection are rapidly cleared by a type I IFN-mediated innate immune response in mice (7, 12, 13) . Indeed, depletion of type I IFN allows extensive viral replication, leading to death or T-cell-mediated clearance during YFV-Asibi or YFV-17D infection, respectively (12, 16) . Although YFV-17D inhibits type I IFN signaling in infected cells (15) , evidence suggests that type I IFN might have a role in the YFV-17D-induced immunogenicity process in human vaccinees. Analysis of the transcriptome of peripheral immune cells from human vaccinees showed that several genes involved in type I IFN pathways (STAT1) as well as interferon-stimulated genes (ISG15, MX1, and OAS1) are upregulated upon vaccination (41) . This correlated with immunogenicity, suggesting a link between the type I IFN response and immunogenicity. However, the precise nature of this link remains to be understood. Although it has been reported that type II IFN signaling is critical for controlling YFV-17D infection in mouse models where type I IFN signaling is abrogated, it was unknown how type III IFN signaling contributes to antiviral defenses (12) . Unlike the IFN-\u2423\u2424 receptor, which is expressed on almost all nucleated cells, expression of the type III IFN receptor is restricted mostly to epithelial surfaces and a small panel of other cell types (20) . Previous studies have demonstrated the ability of type III IFN to mediate an antiviral response at multiple epithelial barriers, such as the respiratory tract (42, 43) , the gastrointestinal tract (44, 45) , or the BBB (22) . Type III IFN signalling, in contrast to type I IFN signalling, usually induces a limited set of interferonstimulated genes (46) , thus promoting a more moderate immune response in contrast with the broad, inflammatory type I IFN-mediated response. Despite its redundancy with type I IFN signaling, the evolutionary conservation of the type III IFN system likely relies upon its specific ability to induce a localized and low-potency immune response. Indeed, unlike most internal tissues, epithelial barriers are constantly exposed to external stimuli and microbes. The properties of type III IFN thus appear particularly adapted to protect these barriers, as the induction of a constant, broad type I-based inflammatory response would be detrimental for the host. Our study data suggest that during YFV-17D infection, type I IFNs represent a frontline immune barrier that likely activates a broad antiviral response. If this barrier breaks, type II and III IFN systems then represent two functionally and spatially distinct rescue mechanisms whose combined action is critical to maintain YFV-17D attenuation (Fig. 8A) .",

            "text": "Both type I and type III IFNs have been identified in the regulation of BBB permeability and the prevention of viral neuroinvasion during infection of mouse models with WNV (22, 30) . In the absence of type I or type III IFN signaling, viral replication appears to be a fundamental element in inducing BBB permeability during WNV infection (22, 30) . Thus, the role of type III IFN signaling in regulating BBB permeability could not be properly assessed in R \u03ea/\u03ea mice, in which YFV-17D poorly replicated. However, even when potent viral replication was induced, no changes in BBB permeability were , type I and type II (left), or type I and type III (right) IFN-mediated signaling in mouse during YFV-17D infection. Although type I IFN-mediated signaling depletion led to the induction of an adaptive immune response and survival, the dual depletion of both type I and type II or both type I and type III IFN-mediated signaling led to severe pathogenesis and death through distinct mechanisms. (B) Proposed pathogenesis model in \u2423\u2424R \u03ea/\u03ea R \u03ea/\u03ea mice infected by YFV-17D. We suggest that \u2423\u2424R \u03ea/\u03ea R \u03ea/\u03ea mice display three distinct pathogenesis features: immunological defects, extensive viral replication, and compromised BBB integrity. We propose a model in which these features are connected and contribute as a whole to viral neuroinvasion. observed in the brain of \u2423\u2424R \u03ea/\u03ea mice despite a more elevated amount of viral RNA than in that of WT and R \u03ea/\u03ea mice. As YFV-17D induced the secretion of multiple proinflammatory cytokines upon infection of \u2423\u2424R \u03ea/\u03ea mice, our data also suggest an absence of competing effects between a protective type I IFN response and BBBdamaging cytokines in \u2423\u2424R \u03ea/\u03ea mice, in contrast to WNV infection (30) . Viral RNA was also found in the brain of infected WT and R \u03ea/\u03ea mice, suggesting a natural ability for a small fraction of YFV-17D particles to pass the BBB without disrupting it during clearance of peripheral infection. The increased numbers of viral RNA copies in the brains of \u2423\u2424R \u03ea/\u03ea mice could thus reflect a more elevated level of viremia in the periphery instead of sustained neuroinvasion. Consistently, no significant increase in viral replication was observed in the brains of WT, R \u03ea/\u03ea , and \u2423\u2424R \u03ea/\u03ea mice between days 3 and 5 postinfection. This observation correlated with a more prominent number of infiltrating T cells in the brain of \u2423\u2424R \u03ea/\u03ea mice, suggesting further viral clearance which was reflected by their survival following infection as well. Disrupting type III IFN signaling in \u2423\u2424R \u03ea/\u03ea mice increased BBB permeability upon infection, suggesting an important role for type III IFN signaling in maintaining BBB integrity during extensive viral replication. Hence, instead of tightening the BBB as observed during neurotropic infection by flavivirus species (which naturally invade the BBB) (22) , our data suggest that type III IFN signaling instead preserves the integrity of the BBB at its steady-state level upon viscerotropic flavivirus infection. A hypothetical model would be that type III IFN signaling preserves BBB integrity against the action of proinflammatory cytokines produced upon viral replication in \u2423\u2424R \u03ea/\u03ea mice. Abrogation of type III IFN signaling would then neutralize any protection of the BBB and render the BBB susceptible to the actions of proinflammatory cytokines. The stark increase in IFN-\u2425 levels in circulation, previously characterized as damaging for BBB integrity during rabies virus infection (40) and observed in \u2423\u2424R \u03ea/\u03ea R \u03ea/\u03ea mice, could significantly contribute to the disruption of the BBB (Fig. 8B ). Viral replication and type III IFN signaling therefore appear to be two major regulators that influence BBB permeability during viscerotropic flavivirus infection.",

Additional variations in cell lineage frequencies were also observed only in \u2423\u2424R \u03ea/\u03ea R \u03ea/\u03ea mice, suggesting that the depletion of both type I and type III IFN can synergistically perturb immune cell proliferation. How these changes in immune cell frequencies in multiple tissues can impact the functionality of the immune response will need further characterization. The strong type III IFN-dependent increase in the levels of cDCs, pDCs, MN, and NK and NKT cells in the spleen of \u2423\u2424R \u03ea/\u03ea R \u03ea/\u03ea mice could have a significant impact of the proinflammatory/anti-inflammatory cytokine balance, as these subsets are major producers of proinflammatory cytokines. Numbers of B cells were significantly reduced in the blood and liver of \u2423\u2424R \u03ea/\u03ea R \u03ea/\u03ea mice, suggesting a potential effect on B-cell-mediated control of YFV-17D infection. The frequencies of pDCs, which are major producers of IFN-\u2424 and IFN-\u2423 in vivo (47) , increased in the periphery of \u2423\u2424R \u03ea/\u03ea mice but not \u2423\u2424R \u03ea/\u03ea R \u03ea/\u03ea mice upon YFV-17D infection, suggesting a potential defect in the antiviral response of pDCs in \u2423\u2424R \u03ea/\u03ea R \u03ea/\u03ea mice. Finally, the stronger decrease in the numbers of CD4 \u03e9 T cells observed in \u2423\u2424R \u03ea/\u03ea R \u03ea/\u03ea mice in comparison to \u2423\u2424R \u03ea/\u03ea mice and the strong increase in the numbers of CD8 \u03e9 T cells in the liver of \u2423\u2424R \u03ea/\u03ea R \u03ea/\u03ea mice point toward a potential perturbation of T-cell proliferation and activation. Consistently, \u2423\u2424R \u03ea/\u03ea R \u03ea/\u03ea mice exhibited defects in T-cell activation in comparison to \u2423\u2424R \u03ea/\u03ea mice, suggesting that type III IFN signaling enhances T-cell activation during YFV-17D infection. In \u2423\u2424R \u03ea/\u03ea R \u03ea/\u03ea mice, this defect could promote immune evasion and, ultimately, viral neuroinvasion. Such a hypothesis is also supported by the fact that \u2423\u2424R \u03ea/\u03ea mice displayed a more prominent number of infiltrating T cells in their brain than \u2423\u2424R \u03ea/\u03ea R \u03ea/\u03ea mice, hence highlighting that a potential defect in T-cell-mediated immunity and T-cell migration could create an environment enabling more-extensive viral replication in the brain and viral neuroinvasion (Fig. 8B) . Taking the data together, interfering with the immunomodulatory functions of type III IFN signaling could be detrimental to the host at two levels. First, it could impair a proper adaptive immune response, promote immune evasion, and hamper T-cell migration toward the central nervous system (CNS) (Fig. 8B) . Second, dysregulation of the immune balance could cause tissue damage and inflammation, as reflected by potential cytokine activity on the BBB (Fig. 8B) .",

IFN-\u2425 is mainly produced by Th1 CD4 \u03e9 T cells and CD8 \u03e9 T cells, as well as by ILC, NK, and NKT cells (9) . This cytokine, along with other Th1 cytokines, can enhance BBB permeability during WNV or rabies virus infection (30, 40) , likely by inducing the internalization of tight junction proteins at epithelial barriers (48) . Type III IFN signaling has been reported to regulate the Th1/Th2 balance toward a Th1 bias (49, 50) . However, disruption of type III IFN signaling appeared to stimulate, not reverse, this bias. We observed a strong increase in the numbers of IFN-\u2425 producer cells in \u2423\u2424R \u03ea/\u03ea R \u03ea/\u03ea mice, such as spleen-resident NK and NKT cells or liver NKT and CD8 \u03e9 T cells, upon infection. This increase could favor immune evasion through continued stimulation of Th1 differentiation and IFN-\u2425 production which would in return inhibit a Th2 response and B-cell-mediated immunity. We hypothesize that the Th1 bias, strong increase in IFN-\u2425 levels, and disruption of BBB maintenance in \u2423\u2424R \u03ea/\u03ea R \u03ea/\u03ea mice could thus be sufficient to induce the breakdown of the BBB (Fig. 8B) . A Th1 bias would also favor virus immune evasion of a Th2 and humoral response, enabling spread to other nonvisceral tissues such as the central nervous system (Fig. 8B) . Further studies will be required to precisely define how type III IFN signaling affects the production of IFN-\u2425 and the Th1/Th2 balance and how their potential dysregulation can favor neuroinvasion upon YFV-17D infection.",

            "text": "Despite the strong conservation of physiologic and metabolic processes, mice and humans likely harbor significant differences in their ability to mediate host immune responses to viral infection (51) . During YFV-17D infection, this is likely reflected by the species-specific interaction with the type I IFN system. In mice, type I IFN rapidly counteracts YFV-17D infection and is not required for the induction of a T-cell-specific immune response (12) . In humans, YFV-17D blocks type I-IFN signaling in infected cells (15) , and transcriptomic data from human vaccinees suggest a link between type I IFN signaling and human-specific immunogenicity (41) . Mice and humans harbor differences in the IFN-genes that they express. Although mice harbor two functional IFNgenes, humans harbor four (20) . One of them, IFN-4, is absent in mice but strongly conserved in other mammals, suggesting a functional role. Consequently, the role of type III IFN in YFV-17D attenuation described in this study will have to be validated further in more relevant experimental models, such as permissive primate species. However, such validation could be challenging due to the complexity of genetic engineering in such species. Despite differences between the mouse and human immune responses, rare cases of neurological adverse effects following YFV-17D infection have been observed in rhesus macaques and human vaccinees (reported rate in the United States, 0.8/100,000) (2, (24) (25) (26) . Although death is rare and most human vaccinees recover from YFV-17D-induced neurologic effects, more than half of the cases have exhibited meningitis or encephalitis directly attributed to neuroinvasion (2) . Instead of being associated with viral mutations-as YFV-17D has been shown to be extremely stable genetically (52)-these neurological effects are thought to be associated with increased host specificity and an innate immunity defect (2) . Indeed, rare cases of YFV-17D-associated viscerotropic disease (reported rate in the United States, 0.4/100,000) (2) have been associated with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes coding for critical actors in the innate immune response such as oligoadenylate synthetase (53) or RANTES (54) . Thus, identifying whether these patients harbor SNPs in genes coding for IFN-or IFN-receptor could provide an additional explanation for this phenomenon. Indeed, IFN-SNPs have been associated with differences in clinical outcome during hepatitis C virus infection (56) . Moreover, treatment with IFN-could represent a valuable option to counterbalance neurotropic manifestations in human vaccinees developing neurologic symptoms.",

Tissue processing, paraffin embedding, and hematoxylin and eosin or CD3 staining (to stain T-lymphocyte) were performed by the Histopathology Reference Lab (HRL) (Hercules, CA) using the standard procedure. All liver and brain sections were of sufficient area to permit accurate examination of tissue histopathological manifestations and lymphocyte infiltration. For each mouse model and experimental condition (noninfected or infected), tissue (liver and brain [or brain only for lymphocyte infiltration analysis]) was examined using 6 tissue sections from three biological replicates (3 animals). The histopathological manifestations and extensive lymphocyte infiltration observed in \u2423\u2424R \u03ea/\u03ea R \u03ea/\u03ea mice were absent from all examined noninfected animals and limited in other infected mouse models.

Following lysis and quenching with 10% FBS-DMEM, blood cells were then washed twice with a 1% (wt/wt) FBS-PBS solution before staining. At the indicated endpoints, mice were euthanized via exsanguination under ketamine/xylazine anesthesia. To isolate immune cells from spleen and liver tissues, spleens and livers were collected following sacrifice and individually placed in 15 ml of serum-free DMEM. Spleens and livers were then transferred into 6-and 10-cm-diameter dishes, respectively, mechanically dissociated using a razor blade, and digested with 5 and 10 ml of digestive buffer, respectively (Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany; 40 mM HEPES, 2 mM CaCl 2 , 2 U/ml DNase I, HBSS [Hanks' balanced salt solution; Life Technologies, Inc., Invitrogen, Foster City, CA]) (0.1% [wt/vol] collagenase) for 30 min at 37\u00b0C.
