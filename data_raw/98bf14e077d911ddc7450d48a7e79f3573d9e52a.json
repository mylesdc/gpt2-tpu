Katelijn Vandemaele (WHO Geneva, Switzerland) emphasised the need to capture both individual-level clinical severity, as well as the impact on a population overall. International comparisons of severity are often based on influenza-attributable hospitalisations and mortality. These assessments face a number of challenges, such as different criteria for hospitalisation and/or laboratory confirmation, and surveillance infrastructure, as presented by Danielle Iuliano (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, United States (US)).",

Gail Carson (Oxford University/ISARIC, Oxford, United Kingdom (UK)) provided an overview of existing networks, highlighting important areas that still need to be addressed: the variety of case definitions currently in use, the lack of coordination between clinical teams, the inconsistent use of International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) codes (including with regards to causes of death) and the question of what feasible data can be collected and will translate into quality improvement and the timely monitoring of influenza activity.",

This topic was further explored by Deepali Kumar (University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada), who studies the impact of influenza in immunocompromised individuals and presented a recent prospective multi-centre study in transplant recipients aimed at identifying markers of severity. The factors that were positively associated with severe outcomes included advanced age, influenza A infection and hospital-acquisition of influenza. Early-onset (< 48 hours) antiviral therapy and influenza immunisation were both found to be protective, and viral shedding was significantly prolonged, especially in unvaccinated transplant recipients and those requiring intensive care [1] .",

An important proportion of individual-level disease burden, including mortality, may go undetected in hospital-based surveillance and needs to be characterised further. Cases of asymptomatic influenza and atypical presentations (such as stroke and myocardial infarction) may never be identified as influenza-related [2] . The issue of under-recognised influenza mortality was investigated in-depth by Jes\u00fas Castilla (Institute of Public Health of Navarra, Spain), who presented recent data from post-mortem screenings for influenza in funeral parlours in Spain. His group, which is part of the Integrated Monitoring of Vaccines in Europe (I-Move) project, studies the hidden mortality associated with influenza infection in ageing populations. Andrew Hayward, (University College London, UK) agreed that reported cases of influenza may only represent the tip of the iceberg. Indicators of severity should include a/ oligosymptomatic patients and patients who do not seek medical care. The Flu Watch Study of households linked to the UK GP network confirmed that influenza infection may accelerate mortality in patients with underlying conditions [3] . Edgar Mojica (National Autonomous University of Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico) presented innovative bioinformatics methods ('spacetime cubes') to detect geographical trends of influenza activity outside the hospital. Using temporo-spatial datasets available in Mexico, he was able to identify regional patterns that may help stakeholders to monitor influenza activity over time.",

            "text": "One of the key aspects in the collection of individual patient data is the specification of relevant clinical endpoints, which ideally should be compatible with endpoints measured in clinical trials and observational studies. Regulatory and public health agencies are increasingly interested in 'real-world' evidence of disease dynamics and the effect of antivirals and vaccines on the individual. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) takes the position that interventions should elicit a 'positive, clinically meaningful effect on how an individual feels, functions or survives.' Elektra Papadopoulos (FDA, Silver Spring, US) provided insight into criteria and pathways for the development of clinically relevant outcome measures from a regulatory viewpoint, including for patient reported outcomes. The session continued with a presentation by Barbara Rath (Vienna Vaccine Safety Initiative (ViVI)/ ISIRV, Berlin, Germany) on the integration of a mobile health (m-health) tool, the ViVI Disease Severity Score, to determine clinical outcomes in routine clinical settings. The Partnering for Enhanced Digital Surveillance of Influenza-like Disease and the Effect of Antivirals and Vaccines (PEDSIDEA) project offers the opportunity to gather real-time information on individuallevel disease severity across different settings and age groups, including children [4] . Daniela Paolotti (Institute for Scientific Interchange Foundation, Turin, Italy) explored the use of voluntary self-reporting as a means to monitor influenza disease activity in populations, linking data from various participatory networks (e.g. Influenzanet). She discussed the challenges of self-reporting, which may be impacted by numerous factors, including awareness of symptoms in self and others, variability of access to and time for reporting, individual interpretations and lack of objective comparators. In the absence of unbiased laboratory confirmation, self-reported symptoms may be triggered by other pathogens or confounded by latent symptoms and underlying conditions. George Milne (University of Western Australia, Perth, Australia) presented epidemiological methods used in Australia to account for population mobility, household/school/work and transmission. He was able to show that high-dose and adjuvanted vaccines are effective in reducing health outcomes in older adults and that vaccination with these vaccines is cost-effective in comparison to a quadrivalent influenza vaccine [5] .",

Since the 2013-14 influenza season, the US CDC has been working to improve mathematical forecasting models (e.g. FluSight). Matthew Biggerstaff (CDC, Atlanta, US) showed that short-term forecasting has since become feasible [7] . Real-time open-data sourcing may further improve forecasting accuracy, and the utility of compiling various models into 'ensemble' models will be the logical next step. Gideon Emokuele (CDC, Nairobi, Kenya) provided insight into influenza disease burden in the context of competing priorities in Sub-Saharan Africa. Due to lack of documentation of causes of death, cause-specific mortality estimates are largely based on verbal autopsies, and need to be further refined to understand the true human and economic burden. Most countries still do not have routine access to influenza testing and thus rely on limited data from influenza surveillance sites. Despite these challenges, eight countries in Sub-Saharan Africa have been able to produce estimates for influenzaassociated hospitalisations and two countries for mortality. In the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region (WHO-EMRO), comprising 22 mostly Northern African and Middle Eastern countries, 19 countries have established a surveillance system for influenza-like illness (ILI) or severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARI) and work is ongoing to implement the Pandemic Influenza Severity Assessment (PISA) methodology in ten of these countries. Mohamed Elhakim (WHO-EMRO, Cairo, Egypt) described how several countries in the Region are currently engulfed in important crises, hampering the effective improvement of surveillance systems.

Jens Nielsen (Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark) described how the European Monitoring of Excess Mortality for Public Health Action (EuroMoMo) network collects data on weekly all-cause deaths from 24 participating European countries. The excess and influenza-attributable mortality during the 2017/18 season, with mainly influenza B circulation, was comparable to A(H3N2) seasons. Carrie Reed (CDC, Atlanta, US) described how her institution is supporting improvements in surveillance at the state level, including burden and vaccination-averted burden estimates. She indicated that severity assessments are further improved by stratification by age, state/region and type/ subtype, and noted that publicly available disease burden and vaccination-averted disease burden estimates have been useful in communicating the public health impact of influenza. She also stated that cross-organisation and interdisciplinary collaboration are necessary for (near) real-time estimates.",

This includes specific risk factors for severe influenza that are less prevalent in high-income settings such as HIV, tuberculosis and malnutrition. Jean-Michel Heraud (Institut Pasteur de Madagascar, Antananarivo, Madagascar), agreed that surveillance and disease burden assessments can be done in low-resource environments; however, more cost-effectiveness studies are warranted to further improve the prevention and control of influenza infections in underserved communities [9] . Ziad Memish (Prince Mohammed bin Abdulaziz Hospital, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia) followed with an overview of acute respiratory infection epidemiology and measures taken for disease control during pilgrimages and mass gatherings in Saudi Arabia. He recommended Post-Hajj cohort studies to further evaluate the impact of the Hajj on the acquisition of respiratory viruses. Alice Wimmer (International Organisation for Migration, Geneva, Switzerland) warned that migrants and refugees need to be included in national pandemic influenza preparedness plans.
