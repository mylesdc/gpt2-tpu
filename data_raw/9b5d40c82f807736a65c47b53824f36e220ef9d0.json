            "text": "A cute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a syndrome of acute respiratory failure that is characterized by alveolar-capillary barrier leakage, lung edema formation, pulmonary epithelial cell death, and an acute inflammatory response that manifests with poor lung compliance, hypoxemia, and bilateral infiltrates on chest radiograph. 1,2 A variety of clinical disorders are associated with the development of ARDS, including pneumonia, aspiration of gastric contents, sepsis, trauma, and the transfusion of blood products. 3 Acute respiratory distress syndrome is a major clinical problem that contributes to the death of more than 70,000 people annually in the United States. 3, 4 In addition, patients who survive ARDS have reduced exercise capacity and health-related quality of life and have increased costs and use of health care services during the 5 years after discharge from the intensive care unit. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Although this syndrome has a considerable impact on public health, relevant large-scale epidemiologic investigations have been rare in recent years. Before 1990, when a uniform definition of ARDS was not in place, several studies showed that the incidence of ARDS was approximately 1.5 to 8.3 per 100,000 person-years. [9] [10] [11] [12] After the American-European Consensus Conference published a uniform definition for ARDS in 1994, 2 several studies conducted in the United States, Australia, and Europe showed that the incidence of ARDS was as high as 13.5 to 28 per 100,000 person-years. [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] Subsequently, Rubenfeld et al 4 conducted a prospective population-based cohort study in 21 hospitals in and around King County, Washington, and found that the incidence of ARDS was 78.9 per 100,000 person-years in the United States and that the incidence was age dependent and increased from 16 per 100,000 person-years for those 15 to 19 years of age to 306 per 100,000 person-years for those 75 to 84 years of age. 4 Epidemiological studies conducted in Asia, however, are limited. 18 Because race may be a risk factor for development of ARDS 19 and there has been no large-scale study of ARDS conducted in a predominantly Asian population, we conducted a retrospective cohort study using nationwide population-based data from the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) of Taiwan. The aim of our study was to investigate the incidence, medical costs, in-hospital mortality, and 1-year mortality of ARDS during a 14-year period.",

The average incidence of ARDS was 15.74 per 100,000 person-years, and increased from 12.53 to 19.26 per 100,000 person-years during the study period. The average in-hospital mortality rate was 57.8% and decreased significantly from 59.7% to 47.5% during the study period. The in-hospital mortality rate was lowest (33.5%) in the youngest patients (age 18-29 years) and highest (68.2%) in the oldest patients (age > 80 years, P < 0.001). The overall 1-year mortality rate was 72.1%, and decreased from 75.8% to 54.7% during the study period. This study used International Classification of Diseases, 9th edition (ICD-9) coding to identify patients admitted with a new diagnosis of ARDS. Several previous studies have used the ICD-9 coding system to investigate the incidence and outcomes of ARDS. Reynolds et al 23 reported that the estimated incidence of ARDS in Maryland was in the range of 10 to 14 cases per 100,000 people and the mortality rate was 36% to 52%, using ICD-9 codes 518.5 and 518.82. 23 Other studies have also used the ICD-9 coding system to determine the incidence or prevalence of ARDS in particular populations, such as those with traumatic brain injury, 24 spinal cord injury, 25 and subarachnoid hemorrhage. 26 Because the ICD-9 coding system is linked to the Taiwanese healthcare reimbursement system, the accuracy of ICD-9 coding is quite precise. Indeed, more than 1000 studies using the Taiwan NHIRD have been published, including a number of important epidemiologic observations. [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] In the case of ARDS, the specificity of ICD-9 coding is likely improved by the fact that the diagnosis is typically made only by intensivists or pulmonologists. We, however, acknowledge that reliance on ICD-9 coding to identify patients with ARDS likely underestimates the true incidence of ARDS, especially with regard to mild or moderate ARDS. This may explain why the observed incidence of ARDS in this study is lower than that reported by Rubenfeld et al 4 in a study that used prospective ARDS phenotyping by trained investigators.",

One possibility is that use of ICD-9 coding identifies a more severely ill group of patients than other methods of ARDS phenotyping. The in-hospital mortality rate in 2011 (47%) in the current study is very close to the mortality reported for patients with severe ARDS in the report of the Berlin Definition of ARDS, (45%), 4 which accounted for approximately one-third of the total study participants in the Berlin study. 32, 33 One possible interpretation is that the Taiwanese study population is representative of severe ARDS and that ICD-9 coding missed many of the less severe mild and moderate cases. If this were the case, then the calculated incidence of all ARDS in Taiwan might be closer to 60 per 100,000 person-years, which is close to the recent report in the United States. 4 In support of this estimate, Moss et al used multiple-cause mortality data to analyze the incidence of ARDS in a population that was more likely to be in the severe stage of the disease. That study showed that the incidence of ARDS was 17 to 26 per 100,000 person-years, 34 which is very close to our finding. Another potential explanation for the high mortality in the Taiwanese cohort is that factors related to health care delivery or patient race lead to the differences in observed outcomes.",

To our knowledge, this is the first nationwide epidemiological study of ARDS, and the follow-up period is the longest available, so we can clearly see the trend of the disease. The limitations of the study are inherent to ICD-09 database without any specified definition of ARDS and retrospective in nature. We did not have detailed data for definition of ARDS, such as the chest radiograph reports, ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen, and utility of positive end-expiratory pressure. In addition, major indexes as Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation score, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, or Lung Injury Score were lacking. Second, because we were limited to the ICD-9 coding data for each admission, we could not identify the actual etiologies of ARDS in this study. Finally, no clinical data such as arterial blood gas analyses were available to grade the severity of ARDS.",

The incidence of ARDS may be underestimated because of the use of ICD-9 coding in the NHIRD and severe ARDS may be overrepresented. Nevertheless, the study provides valuable new information on the incidence and outcomes of ARDS in an Asian patient population. Consistent with findings in other countries, there has been a decrease in in-hospital and 1-year mortality rates in recent years that likely reflects the benefits of lung protective mechanical ventilation.",
