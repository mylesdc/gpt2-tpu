Despite the biological significance of RNase L, the RNAs cleaved by this enzyme are poorly defined. In this study, we used deep sequencing methods to reveal the frequency and location of RNase L cleavage sites within host and viral RNAs. To make cDNA libraries, we exploited the 2 0 , 3 0 -cyclic phosphate at the end of RNA fragments produced by RNase L and other metal-ion-independent endoribonucleases. We optimized and validated 2 0 , 3 0 -cyclic phosphate cDNA synthesis and Illumina sequencing methods using viral RNAs cleaved with purified RNase L, viral RNAs cleaved with purified RNase A and RNA from uninfected and poliovirus-infected HeLa cells. Using these methods, we identified (i) discrete regions of hepatitis C virus and poliovirus RNA genomes that were profoundly susceptible to RNase L and other single-strand specific endoribonucleases, (ii) RNase L-dependent and RNase L-independent cleavage sites within ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) and (iii) 2 0 , 3 0 -cyclic phosphates at the ends of 5S rRNA and U6 snRNA. Monitoring the frequency and location of metal-ion-independent endoribonuclease cleavage sites within host and viral RNAs reveals, in part, how these enzymes contribute to health and disease.",

Metal-iondependent enzymes (e.g. RNase P and RNase MRP) cleave single-and double-stranded RNA to produce RNA fragments with 5 0 -phosphate and 3 0 -hydroxyl termini. In contrast, metal-ion-independent enzymes (e.g. RNase L, RNase A and IRE1) target singlestranded RNA exclusively, producing RNA fragments with 5 0 -hydroxyl and 2 0 , 3 0 -cyclic phosphate termini ( Table 1 ). The specificity of metal-ion-independent endoribonucleases for single-stranded sites in RNA is due in large part to the mechanism of RNA cleavage. A structurally flexible 2 0 -OH, in the context of single-stranded RNA, functions as the nucleophile, resulting in the generation of the 2 0 , 3 0 -cyclic phosphate at the site of RNA cleavage by metal-ion-independent endoribonucleases.",

Based on its homology with IRE1 (24), a metal-ion-independent enzyme that produces RNA fragments with 2 0 , 3 0 -cyclic phosphate termini (1, 25) , RNase L is expected to produce RNA fragments with 2 0 , 3 0 -cyclic phosphate termini (Table 1) . RNase L cleaves host and viral RNAs predominantly at single-stranded UA and UU dinucleotides (26) , although the structural context of UA and UU dinucleotides in RNA greatly impacts the magnitudes of cleavage by RNase L (27) . Host and viral RNAs cleaved by RNase L function as ligands for RIG-I and MDA5 (28, 29) , amplifying type I interferon expression and antiviral responses. Several viruses encode mechanisms to directly counteract RNase L. Group C enteroviruses encode an RNA structure that functions as a competitive inhibitor of RNase L (30) (31) (32) (33) , whereas certain strains of coronavirus and rotavirus express a 2 0 , 5 0 -phosphodiesterase that destroys 2 0 , 5 0oligoadenylates [2-5A or p x 5'A(2'p5'A) n ; x = 1-3; n ! 2] (34, 35) , the allosteric activator of RNase L. Recently, the L* protein of Theiler's virus was shown to directly inhibit RNase L activity (36) . Characteristic RNase L-dependent (37) and RNase L-independent (38) cleavage patterns are evident in ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) during virus infections; however, the precise cleavage sites in rRNAs have not been defined.",

We validated the methods using defined viral RNAs cleaved with purified RNase L and RNase A, as well as RNA from uninfected-and poliovirus (PV)-infected HeLa cells under conditions where RNase L was activated during the course of the virus infection (30) . As described herein, we discovered discrete regions in HCV and PV RNA genomes that were profoundly susceptible to single-strand-specific endoribonucleases, as well as regions that were largely resistant to cleavage by singlestrand-specific endoribonucleases. We identified a constellation of RNase L-dependent and RNase L-independent cleavage sites in rRNAs and we mapped these cleavage sites onto the secondary and tertiary structures of the human 80S ribosome (42) . In addition, we detected 2 0 , 3 0 -cyclic phosphates at the end of U6 snRNA, consistent with the enzymatic activity of C16orf57 (6, 7) . Lastly, and unexpectedly, our results suggest that 2 0 , 3 0 -cyclic phosphates are present at the end of 5S rRNA.",

One prominent RNase L-dependent cleavage site at UA 1715 was evident in PV RNA isolated at 6 and 8 hpa from W12 HeLa cells ( Figure 4A) . A second potential RNase L-dependent cleavage site at UU 3102 was evident in PV RNA isolated at 6 and 8 hpa from W12 HeLa cells ( Figure 4A ); however, there was substantial RNase L-independent cleavage at UU 3102 in M25 HeLa cells ( Figure 4C ), making it uncertain as to the enzyme(s) responsible for cleavage at this site in cells. UA 1715 and UU 3102 are prominent RNase L cleavage sites identified using purified RNase L ( Figure 2B and Supplementary Figure S5) . Surprisingly, there were no other obvious RNase L-dependent cleavage sites in PV RNA isolated from W12 HeLa cells. The increased frequency of UA and UU dinucleotides in cDNAs from W12 HeLa cells at 6 and 8 hpa was consistent with the activation of RNase L at these times (compare Figure  4B and D). RNase L-independent cleavage sites in PV RNA from HeLa cells mapped to the same regions of PV RNA as the cleavage sites found using purified RNase L and RNase A, with notable peaks of cleavage in the 5 0 -half of the open-reading frame (compare Figure 2B with Figure 4A and C). Potential reasons for these hypersensitive regions in PV RNA are considered in the discussion. Remarkably, PV cDNA reads from HeLa cells corresponded to cleavage sites exclusively within positive-strand RNA; no cDNA reads were found corresponding to cleavage sites within PV negative-strand RNA.",

Our data confirm that RNase L, like RNase A, produces RNA fragments with 2 0 , 3 0 -cyclic phosphate termini. We used 2 0 , 3 0 -cyclic phosphate cDNA synthesis and Illumina sequencing methods to identify and quantify metal-ion-independent endoribonuclease cleavage sites within host and viral RNAs. We optimized and validated the methods using viral RNAs cleaved with purified RNase L, viral RNAs cleaved with purified RNase A and RNA from uninfected and PV-infected HeLa cells (Figures 1-7 and Supplementary Tables S1-S6). Overall, these methods reliably and reproducibly reveal the location and relative frequency of 2 0 , 3 0 -cyclic phosphates in host and viral RNAs. These cDNA synthesis and Illumina sequencing methods did not detect RNA fragments corresponding to RNase P or RNase MRP activity, consistent with the specificity of the method for RNA fragments with 2 0 , 3 0 -cyclic phosphates. Several lines of evidence suggest that cyclic phosphates within host and viral RNAs were due to metal-ionindependent endonucleolytic cleavage of RNA within cells rather than cleavage during RNA processing or within linker reactions. Cyclic phosphates were not frequent in viral RNA transcripts isolated from control reactions lacking endonucleases, confirming the absence of Figure S15) , a cellular enzyme known to leave cyclic phosphates at the end of mature U6 snRNA in cells (6, 7) . Nonetheless, it is important to note that divalent metal ions can promote RNA cleavage at specific sites, leaving cyclic phosphates (53) . Thus, in addition to metal-ion-independent endoribonucleases, some of the RNA cleavage sites revealed by 2 0 , 3 0 -cyclic phosphate cDNA synthesis and Illumina sequencing could be due to metal RNA binding pockets within RNAs. In fact, Pb 2+ -dependent cleavage of 28S rRNA at AG 409 has been reported (54) . This is a prominent and reproducible cleavage site within our data sets ( Figures 5A  and 6A and Supplementary Figures S7A and S8A) . Thus, a metal binding pocket at this site in 28S rRNA, under physiologic conditions within cells, may lead to rRNA cleavage. Carefully controlled experimental variables are needed to attribute specific cleavage sites to particular endonucleases or to metal binding pockets.",

Primer extension reveals RNase L cleavage sites in HCV RNA in vitro (27) results are consistent with those obtained using primer extension (27) ; however, the quantitative data from 2 0 , 3 0 -cyclic phosphate cDNA synthesis and Illumina sequencing is more reliable than that obtained using primer extension. Quantitative analyses of RNase L cleavage sites in HCV RNA by primer extension were confounded by multiple factors: the use of multiple primers (30 primers across the HCV RNA genome), variable hybridization efficiencies for each primer and decreased sensitivity of cleavage site detection as the distance increased from the site of hybridization. In contrast, quantitative analyses of RNase L cleavage sites in HCV RNA using 2 0 , 3 0 -cyclic phosphate cDNA synthesis and Illumina sequencing are extremely precise. Because HCV RNAs from distinct genotypes have variably reduced frequencies of UA and UU dinucleotides (40), the potential role(s) of RNase L in HCV infections and interferon-based antiviral therapies deserves further examination now that a method has been developed to reliably detect and quantify RNase L cleavage sites in host and viral RNAs.",

The striking distribution of RNase L and RNase A cleavage sites in PV RNA ( Figure 2B) , with prominent amounts of cleavage in discrete regions of the genome, was not expected. The same discrete regions of PV RNA were targeted by endoribonucleases both in vitro ( Figure 2B ) and in vivo ( Figure 4 ). Furthermore, one RNase L-specific cleavage site was reliably detected both in vitro and in vivo ( Figures 2B and 4 , UA 1715 in PV RNA). We entertained two hypotheses as we considered these data. First, PV RNA may assume a secondary and tertiary structure that renders some portions of the genome particularly susceptible to single-strand-specific endoribonucleases while rendering other regions resistant (Supplementary Figure S5) . Second, antigenic variation in the capsid proteins, as a consequence of antibody selection, could render portions of the capsid genes more sensitive to cleavage by single-strand-specific endoribonucleases, due to the counter-selective forces of antigenic variation and resistance to endoribonucleases (Supplementary Figure S6) . The predicted secondary structures of HCV and PV RNAs do explain much of the data (55), as metal-ion-independent endoribonucleases do not cleave dsRNA portions of viral RNA (Supplementary Figures  S4 and S5 ). In addition, atomic force microscopy of HCV and PV RNA genomes reveals globular structures, where some regions of the viral RNA genomes might be more exposed to endoribonucleases than others (56, 57) . Intriguingly, antibody neutralization escape mutations are found within and near endonuclease susceptible regions of PV RNA (58, 59) ; however, the peaks of endonucleolytic cleavage in the PV capsid genes do not overlap exclusively with the location of RNA changes associated with antigenic variation (Supplementary Figure S6) . A complete understanding of the discrete distribution of endoribonuclease cleavage sites in PV RNA awaits further investigation.",

Unlike many studies, which actively exclude rRNAs from deep sequencing experiments to enrich for other RNA populations, we intentionally retained rRNAs in our study to identify RNase L-dependent and RNase L-independent cleavage sites in rRNAs. Although we did not detect RNase L-dependent cleavage sites in 28S rRNA under the conditions of our experiment, others have reported RNase L-dependent cleavage of 28S rRNA (60, 61) . We did identify two RNase L-dependent cleavage sites in 18S rRNA, UU 541 and UU 743 ( Figures 5B and 7A and B). Cleavage of 18S rRNA (1869 bases long) at these sites would produce rRNA fragments of 541, 743, 1126 and 1328 bases long, consistent with the characteristic rRNA fragments observed by agarose gel electrophoresis in this report ( Figure 3B) , and in previous studies by our lab and others (30, 37) . As expected for RNase L, the 18S rRNA cleavage sites, UU 541 and UU 743 , are associated with single-stranded regions of 18S rRNA, on the surface of 80S ribosomes (Figure 7) . A number of RNase L-independent cleavage sites were identified consistently in rRNAs (Figures 5-7;  Supplementary Figures S7-S14 and Supplementary  Tables S4-S6) . Each of the sites mapped to singlestranded regions of rRNA (Supplementary Figures S13 and S14), and most were located at the surface of 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits ( Figure 7D ). The RNase L-independent cleavage sites of 28S rRNA occurred in core segments of the 28S rRNA, while little cleavage occurred in the GC-rich expansion segments ( Figures 5A  and 6A ), despite the location of expansion segments on the surface of ribosomes (Figure 7) . The paucity of cDNA reads in 28S rRNA expansion segments is likely due to the dsRNA-rich characteristics of expansion segments (42) (Supplementary Figure S13/dsRNA is resistant to metalion-independent endoribonucleases) and to the reduced frequency of Illumina cDNA reads in GC-rich regions of RNA (62) . The paucity of cDNA reads in rRNA expansion segments evident in our data ( Figures 5 and 6 ) is similar to data from others (63) .",

The RNase L cleavage sites identified in this investigation in 18S rRNA (UU 541 and UU 743 ) are distant from the mRNA decoding channel (Figure 7) . It is unclear whether cleavage of 18S rRNA at these sites would affect translation. AG 409 in 28S rRNA, one of the most prominent RNase L-independent cleavage sites in both uninfected and PV-infected HeLa cells (Figures 5A and 6A;  Supplementary Figures S7 and S8 and Supplementary  Table S4) , is analogous to an oxidative stress-induced rRNA cleavage site identified in yeast (66) . Yet again, there are no definitive data to indicate how cleavage of 28S rRNA at this site would affect translation. Nonetheless, because decreased translation is a common aspect of antiviral responses, ER-stress, apoptosis and oxidative stress, it is reasonable to speculate that cleavage of rRNAs at these sites might inhibit the translation activity of ribosomes. It is also important to consider the potential role of endonucleases in rRNA decay (67, 68) . RNase T2 has been implicated in rRNA decay pathways in plants (69) and vertebrates (70) .",

Cyclic phosphates have been described at the 3 0 -end of U6, 7SK and MRP RNAs, but not at the 3 0 -end of 5S rRNA (71) . Nonetheless, 5S rRNA was among the most common sequences detected in 2 0 , 3 0 -cyclic phosphate cDNA libraries ( Figure 3C and D and Supplementary Table  S3) , and almost all of the 5S rRNA signal was associated with the 3 0 -end of mature 5S rRNA ( Figures 5D and 6D and Supplementary Figure S12) . The 3 0 -ends of 5.8S and 5S rRNAs are on the surface of 60S ribosomal subunits ( Figure 7C) , consistent with the possibility that ribosomes contain RNAs with these terminal modifications. Alternatively, the mature 3 0 -end of 5S rRNA, in the context of Mdmx complexes, could be modified with 2 0 , 3 0 -cyclic phosphates (72) . Rex1p, a 3 0 to 5 0 exonuclease in the RNase D family, is involved with modifying the 3 0ends of both 5S and 5.8S rRNA in yeast; however, RNase D family members are metal-ion-dependent, and thus it is unlikely that a human homolog of Rex1p is responsible for the 2 0 , 3 0 -cyclic phosphate found at the end of these rRNAs (73, 74) .",

RNase L and RNase A cleavage sites in the viral RNAs were extremely reproducible across RNA samples from independent time points (Supplementary Figures S2 and S3). RNase L cleaved HCV and PV RNAs predominantly at UpN dinucleotides (UA and UU > UG), with prominent amounts of cleavage at distinct locations in the viral RNAs (Figure 2). Pyrimidines were the most common nucleotides at the end of viral RNA fragments produced by RNase A (Figure 2), consistent with the known specificity of RNase A (52). RNase L and RNase A targeted singlestranded regions of viral RNA (Supplementary Figures S4 and S5). A peak of cleavage was evident in the E2 gene of HCV RNA, with especially large amounts of RNase L cleavage at UA 1755 , UA 4422 and UU 4465 and especially large amounts of RNase A cleavage at UC 1671 , UC 1682 and CU 1754 (Figure 2A). Three independent peaks of cleavage were evident in PV RNA; region 1 (884-1042 nt), region 2 (1705-1827 nt) and region 3 (3088-3221 nt) (Figure 2B and Supplementary Figure S5). As highlighted in Supplementary Figure S5, UA 961 was the most frequent RNase L cleavage site within region 1 (1108 UMI reads after 5 min of cleavage), UA 1803 was the most frequent RNase L cleavage site within region 2 (4223 UMI reads after 5 min of cleavage) and UU 3102 was the most frequent RNase L cleavage site within region 3 (5347 UMI reads after 5 min of cleavage). Intriguingly, these regions of PV RNA encode portions of the capsid proteins recognized by neutralizing antibodies (Supplementary Figure S6). Consistent with increasing amounts of viral RNA cleavage over time, the number of UMI-corrected cDNA reads at prominent cleavage sites in HCV and PV RNAs increased coordinate with the time of incubation with RNase L (Supplementary Figures S2 and S4 for HCV RNA/Supplementary Figures S3 and S5 for PV RNA). This is most clearly presented in Supplementary Figure S4, focusing on four prominent RNase L cleavage sites in HCV RNA. The number of UMI-corrected cDNA reads at UA 1755 , UA 4422 , UU 4465 and UU 4466 increased coordinate with the time of incubation with RNase L (Supplementary",
