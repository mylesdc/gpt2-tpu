This may be due to the different case definitions used in the 2 studies. Findings similar to ours were reported in a study conducted in the Gulf region in children <5 years of age. In the latter study, the reported detection rates for these viruses were 4.9% (14/331) hBoV and hCoV-229E, and 3.5% (10/331) hPyV-WU. 5 Globally, hBoV and hPyV-WU are predominantly observed in children aged <4 years with upper and lower respiratory tract infection, which was also observed in our study. 15 A recent South African study found that among children aged <1 year, hBoV (but not hCoV) detection was significantly associated with severe illness. 16 Human polyomaviruses was not investigated in the latter study. Therefore, inclusion of laboratory tests for hBoV, hCoV-229E, and hPyV-WU in differential testing algorithms for surveillance and diagnostics for suspected cases of respiratory illness of unknown cause may improve our understanding of the etiology of SARI, especially in a country like South Africa with a high number of immune compromised persons.",

Second, the sample size was too small. Sero-prevalence data for South Africa is lacking; therefore, using 50% expected prevalence to obtain the biggest sample size for a 95% confidence interval, a 5% desired absolute precision, and a design effect of 1, plus inflation by 25% for spoilage/quality of samples, the annual expected sample for the study should have been 480 (960 for the 2 years). Lastly, the study duration was too short, as a 4-to 5-year period is required to assess seasonality and, therefore, the seasonality of HBoV, hCoV, and hPyV was not determined.",

Apart from influenza and respiratory syncytial viruses (RSVs), several other respiratory viruses remain largely undiagnosed 1 . Understanding and defining the contribution of viral etiologies of severe respiratory illness in countries like South Africa that have a high burden of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections and associated acquired immunodeficiency syndrome may be important for health management and planning. In a prior South African study, 43% of respiratory specimens from patients hospitalised with severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) tested negative for 10 screened viruses (parainfluenza virus [PIV] types 1, 2 and 3; RSV; enterovirus;",

Presently, in South Africa, in order to maintain sustainability of our respiratory illness surveillance programme, expanded testing for viral etiologies are mainly conducted in patients with SARI (including deaths and intensive care unit admissions) of unknown cause through outbreak investigations and specialized diagnostic test requests, where identification of an etiologic agent is desired for possible public health action.",

Respiratory viruses not included in routine diagnostic testing such as human bocavirus (hBoV), human coronaviruses (hCoVs), and human polyomaviruses (hPyV) may be responsible for viral respiratory illness among patients that test negative for the more commonly screened viruses. Human bocavirus, hPyV, and hCoV infections have been reported among patients with respiratory tract infections in differentsettings 3-6 , but these viruses are usually poorly investigated in routine surveillance or for diagnostic purposes. We aimed to assess the prevalence of hBoV, hCoV-OC43, hCoVs-229E, hCoVs-NL63, hCoVs-HKU1, Washington University human polyomavirus (hPyV-WU), and Karolinska Insitute human polyomavirus (hPyV-KI) among hospitalised patients with SARI in South Africa, during 2012 to 2013. Study participants were enrolled in prospective, hospital-based SARI surveillance, from January 2012 through December 2013. Severe acute respiratory illness surveillance was conducted in 5 sentinel sites in North West (Klerksdorp-Tshepong Hospital Complex, Klerksdorp), KwaZulu-Natal (Edendale Hospital, Pietermaritzburg), Mpumalanga (Matikwana and Mapulaneng Hospitals, Agincourt), and Gauteng (Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital) provinces in South Africa. Severe acute respiratory illness cases were defined as hospitalised patients with symptom onset within 7 days (symptom onset duration changed to \u226410 days from 2013) of hospital admission and who met age-specific inclusion criteria, including (1) children aged 2 days to <3 months with physician-diagnosed/suspected sepsis or acute lower respiratory tract infection, irrespective of signs and symptoms; (2) children aged 3 months to <5 years with physician-diagnosed acute lower respiratory tract infection or pleural effusion; and (3) individuals aged \u22655 years with physician diagnosed lower respiratory tract infection with sudden onset of temperature \u226538\u00b0C or history of fever, cough or sore throat, shortness of breath, or difficulty breathing. 7,82.2 | Study proceduresStudy procedures have been described previously. 9,10 Briefly, study staff reviewed hospital admission registers to identify patients meeting the SARI case definition. All patients that met the case definition were approached and consented by the surveillance officers. Patients who consented to participate in the study were asked to complete a questionnaire by interview to record previous medical history and clinical data. Consented patients were asked to provide respiratory and other clinical specimens; at the time, permissions were obtained to use stored specimens for research studies.",
