The total number of birds transitioning from each compartment at any given time step \u2206t were sampled from the binomial distribution.

The first was the within-flock force of infection representing direct bird-to-bird transmission, modelled as a frequency-dependent process. The second was the environmental transmission component which was modelled as a density-dependent process. As bird-to-bird transmission was modelled as a frequency-dependent process, we assumed a bird's ability to infect a fixed number of birds was not affected by increases or decreases in the size of the market population. This assumption implied that the direct transmission potential of infected birds was restricted, and in reality may reflect the movement restrictions birds experience within the market, as they are likely to be caged up or crammed within a pen. This contact rate assumption is supported by experimental work [2] . Environmental transmission was modelled as a densitydependent process. Dispersal of infectious matter is likely to be less spatially restricted than bird-to-bird contact, and the spread of fomites has been shown to occur through the air and wind dispersal [16, 17] . In addition, unlike markets in Hong Kong where cleaning and closure of the markets is done on a routine basis [18, 19] , the vast majority of rural markets are rarely if ever cleaned. The assumption of density-dependent environmental transmission may be unrealistic because the environment itself will have a maximum capacity in terms of the concentration of virions it can maintain. However it seems reasonable that the true mechanism of transmission in the market could be described by a mix of frequency and density-dependent transmission. Neither of the ways in which transmission has been modelled are likely to describe the system perfectly, however the inclusion of both mechanisms may capture the variation inherent in the system.",
