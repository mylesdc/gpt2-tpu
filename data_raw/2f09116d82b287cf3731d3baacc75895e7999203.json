            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which is caused by a newly discovered coronavirus (CoV), has recently emerged. It causes severe viral pneumonia and is associated with a high fatality rate. However, the pathogenesis, comparative pathology and inflammatory cell response of rhesus macaques and common marmosets experimentally infected with MERS-CoV are unknown. We describe the histopathological, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural findings from rhesus macaque and common marmoset animal models of MERS-CoV infection. The main histopathological findings in the lungs of rhesus macaques and common marmosets were varying degrees of pulmonary lesions, including pneumonia, pulmonary oedema, haemorrhage, degeneration and necrosis of the pneumocytes and bronchial epithelial cells, and inflammatory cell infiltration. The characteristic inflammatory cells in the lungs of rhesus macaques and common marmosets were eosinophils and neutrophils, respectively. Based on these observations, the lungs of rhesus macaques and common marmosets appeared to develop chronic and acute pneumonia, respectively. MERS-CoV antigens and viral RNA were identified in type I and II pneumocytes, alveolar macrophages and bronchial epithelial cells, and ultrastructural observations showed that viral protein was found in type II pneumocytes and inflammatory cells in both species. Correspondingly, the entry receptor DDP4 was found in type I and II pneumocytes, bronchial epithelial cells, and alveolar macrophages. The rhesus macaque and common marmoset animal models of MERS-CoV can be used as a tool to mimic the oncome of MERS-CoV infections in humans. These models can help to provide a better understanding of the pathogenic process of this virus and to develop effective medications and prophylactic treatments. et al.

More men than women have become infected with this virus, and the median age of those affected is 47 years old (range: 9 months-94 years), with most of the fatalities occurring in patients over 60 years old [2, 3] . The respiratory symptoms of this infection are primarily related to severe lower respiratory tract complications (e.g., dyspnoea and coughing associated with a fever) that may become fatal, while there is generally little involvement of the upper respiratory tract. A large proportion of severely ill patients require mechanical ventilation [4, 5] . Complications that have been described in fatal cases include hyperkalaemia with associated ventricular tachycardia, disseminated intravascular coagulation leading to cardiac arrest, pericarditis and multiorgan failure [6] .",

Zoonotic transmission is likely to have originated from this species and is expected to continue indefinitely in these regions. The entry receptor for MERS-CoV, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DDP4), also named CD26, shows a high similarity in both humans and dromedary camels. Most MERS patients acquire the infection in the Middle East, which subsequently leads to limited human-to-human transmission in local groups and healthcare workers and eventually to travel-related cases outside the region, all of which can result in a mild to severe or even fatal respiratory disease [2] .",

Therefore, it is vital to study comparative pathology on the association of the MERS-CoV antigen with its receptor, DDP4, or the histopathological changes in nonhuman primate (NHP) models of MERS-CoV infection. Here, we comprehensively describe the histopathological features of the disease and the distribution of the MERS-CoV antigen and DDP4 in rhesus macaque and common marmoset models. Our findings may contribute to a better understanding of the pathogenic process of MERS-CoV infection and help in evaluating the suitability and efficacy of the animal models used in the development of effective medications and prophylactic treatments for this disease.",

The experiments and protocols for this NHP models of MERS-CoV infection were discussed explicitly and extensively among the staff members of the Department of Pathogen Biology. These discussions were followed by consultations with biosafety officers and facility managers at the ILAS of PUMC, as well as with numerous specialists in the fields of SARS-CoV and general infectious disease research throughout China. All research procedures were approved by the ILAS Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and the Laboratory Safety Committee (LSC). The committee recommended that the number of animals be reduced to comply with the 3R (reduction, replacement, refinement) principles. Therefore, our experiment was designed to include three rhesus macaques and three common marmosets to test their effectiveness as animal models of MERS-CoV infection. Two rhesus macaques and two common marmosets were infected with the virus and one individual of each species was left uninfected to serve as a control. The animals were planned to be euthaniazed when they were suffering from fatal respiratory symptom, impending death or 20% of body weight loss, which included fatal dyspnea and infectious shock. The approved registration number for this study is ILAS-PC-2013-004. All experiments were conducted within an animal biosafety level 3 (ABSL-3) facility, which was constructed and accredited based on National Standard GB19489 at the ILAS of PUMC, Beijing, China.",

            "text": "Rhesus macaques and common marmosets were housed in accordance with Chinese National standards, which are consistent with the standard set forth in the 8th edition of the NRC Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Because of the infectious nature of this study, NHPs were housed individually instead of the generally recommended group or social housing. Stainless steel cages measuring 0.5-0.75 m 2 and 0.5-0.6 m depending on the weight of the individual animal, consisted of wire flooring and resting boards or perches. Rooms have natural lighting and the photoperiod is supplemented during the winter months with an artificial lighting source to provide a 12: 12 light cycle. Temperature and humidity in animal holding rooms are maintained in accordance with recommendations in the Chinese National Standards for animal care. Drinking potable water is obtained from the city of Beijing and delivered to the animals via automated watering system (AWS). The AWS is checked daily to ensure proper operation i.e., water pressure, free flowing exits and absence of leakages. Pans were cleaned daily and cages were washed every week by hand. All animals have individual cage ID cards which contain the following basic information: Study No., sex, weight, Principal Investigator's name and study protocol number. NHPs were fed a measured amount of a commercially available NHP diet (Beijing HFK Bioscience Co., Ltd) offered twice daily. Fresh fruit (apples, bananas and oranges) are supplemented on alternating days. Additional environmental enrichment consists of toys, stainless steel mirrors and heavy-duty dog chew toys (Nyla bones or similar), which are provided on a rotating basis. Toys are left inside the cages when these are transported out of the room for washing and are sanitized at this time. Damaged toys are removed from circulation. Soft background music, plants, as well as pictures and photos hung on the animal room walls are provided for relaxation. Opportunities for limited social interaction with compatible NHPs are also provided at every other cage change when cages of compatible animals are placed in close proximity to each other while avoiding direct physical contact between animals.",

Moreover, we compared the distribution of MERS-CoV antigens, viral RNA and DDP4 expression in the infected lungs of these species. We found that the lungs of both species exhibited varying degrees of lesions, including pneumonia, pulmonary oedema, haemorrhaging, degeneration and necrosis of the pneumocytes and bronchial epithelial cells, and inflammatory cell infiltration. Comparing the different trends in the two NHP models, it can be seen that varying degrees of inflammation, especially interstitial pneumonia, were found in the lungs of rhesus macaques, indicating mild disease and trend of chronic pneumonia; however, in the lungs of common marmosets, exudative pathological changes were found, exhibiting pulmonary oedema, inflammatory cell infiltration and fibrinous exudates, suggesting acute pneumonia. Similar to our results, previous study have also reported that rhesus macaques developed mild disease, and common marmoset exhibited potentially lethal disease [16] . However, in our study we found that the prominent inflammatory cells in the two NHP models were different, which may be the causality of process in MERS-CoV infection. In our study, the diffuse infiltration of numerous macrophages was observed in the expanded alveolar septa and oedematous alveolar cavities of both species. However, the most prominent pathological effect observed in the lungs of rhesus macaques was a diffuse and focal eosinophil infiltration in the thickened alveolar septum and oedematous alveolar cavities, around the bronchus, and among the necrotic bronchial epithelial cells.",

These differences in inflammatory cell infiltration suggest that inflammatory cells may function in the development of MERS-CoV infection. Additionally, it is worth noting that eosinophils and neutrophils play important roles in rhesus macaques and common marmosets, respectively, in the development of pulmonary lesions and the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV infection. In the lungs of common marmoset, pulmonary oedema exhibited much more severe than that in the lungs of rhesus macaques, which may be due to the difference of inflammatory cells in the lungs of NHP models.

Pathology of MERS-CoV infection the terminal bronchioles, with an influx of inflammatory cells, a thickening of alveolar septa, oedema, haemorrhaging and fibrosis in lung tissues [10] . Previous studies on rhesus macaques have shown that histological lesions induced by MERS-CoV infection were limited to the lungs, which exhibited interstitial pneumonia with a thickening of alveolar septa caused by oedema and fibrin accumulation, and small to moderate numbers of macrophages and even fewer neutrophils. In addition, alveoli tissue samples contained moderate numbers of pulmonary macrophages and neutrophils [17] . Previous studies on common marmosets infected with MERS also showed that marmosets developed a progressive severe pneumonia or interstitial lymphohistiocytic pneumonia, exhibiting hypoproteinemia consistent with high protein pulmonary effusions resulting from alveolar oedema and interstitial lymphohistiocytic pneumonia with type II pneumocyte and bronchial associated lymphoid tissue hyperplasia [18, 19] . However, rhesus macaque model did not develop breathing abnormalities and showed no-tovery mild radiographic evidence of pneumonia [20] . Similar to our study, the common marmoset model of MERS-CoV infection mimics the acute and severe pathological process, yet the rhesus macaque model represents the mild infection of MERS-CoV. Thus, the NHP models meet different needs of MERS-CoV researches. Fatal human cases of MERS-CoV infection cause upper respiratory tract illness, severe pneumonia and multiorgan failure. These cases also include exudative-phase diffuse alveolar damage with the denuding of bronchiolar epithelia, the prominent formation of hyaline membranes, alveolar fibrin deposits, type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia, the occurrence of rare multinucleated syncytial cells, changes in alveolar septa related to oedema and increases in lymphocytes, with fewer plasma cells, neutrophils, and macrophages [21] . These findings provide evidence for the pulmonary tropism of MERS-CoV infection. The pathological features of MERS-CoV are shared by other similar respiratory illnesses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV [22] . Previous studies that have evaluated fatal human cases of SARS--CoV have described diffuse alveolar damage at various stages as the most characteristic feature Pathology of MERS-CoV infection of the disease, with SARS-CoV antigens primarily found in alveolar epithelial cells. In this study, we examined the histopathological features and the inflammatory cell response that occurs in the lungs of rhesus macaques and common marmosets experimentally infected with MERS-CoV. Our findings indicate that inflammatory cells may play a crucial role in fatal MERS-CoV infections and that the progression of this disease in our animal models may mimic the infection in humans, making these models useful for further study of the pathogenesis, prevention and treatment of MERS-CoV infections.",
