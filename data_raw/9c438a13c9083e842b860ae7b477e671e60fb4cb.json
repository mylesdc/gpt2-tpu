            "text": "Tuberculosis is a major infectious disease that globally causes the highest human mortality. From this aspect, this study was carried out to evaluate novel pharmacological activities/effects of artesunate and artemisinin causing anti-tubercular activity/effects against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). The anti-Mtb activities/effects of artesunate and artemisinin were evaluated using different anti-Mtb indicator assays, such as the resazurin microtiter assay, the Mycobacteria Growth Indicator Tube (MGIT) 960 system assay, and the Ogawa slant medium assay, as well as in vivo tests. Artesunate showed selective anti-Mtb effects by strongly inhibiting the growth of Mtb compared to artemisinin, and consistently induced anti-Mtb activity/effects by effectively inhibiting Mtb in the MGIT 960 system and in Ogawa slant medium for 21 days with a single dose; its minimum inhibitory concentration was 300 \u00b5g/mL in in vitro testing. Furthermore, artesunate demonstrated an anti-tubercular effect/action with a daily dose of 3.5 mg/kg in an in vivo test for four weeks, which did not indicate or induce toxicity and side effects. These results demonstrate that artesunate effectively inhibits the growth and/or proliferation of Mtb through novel pharmacological activities/actions, as well as induces anti-Mtb activity. This study shows its potential as a potent candidate agent for developing new anti-tuberculosis drugs of an effective/safe next generation, and suggests novel insights into its effective use by repurposing existing drugs through new pharmacological activity/effects as one of the substantive alternatives for inhibiting tuberculosis.",

            "text": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is one of the most dangerous pathogens which cause the highest human mortality and morbidity among various infectious diseases worldwide, particularly in Africa and the developing countries including Southeast Asia. Tuberculosis (TB) indicated a high level of co-infection with HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) from 2004 to 2014, and the prevalence of TB cases co-infected with HIV was highest in the African region compared with other regions [1, 2] . For these reasons, various anti-TB drugs, such as rifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol, pyrazinamide, and second-line drugs (D-cycloserine, cephalosporin, viomycin, etc.), were developed for the treatment of TB patients. Furthermore, various studies and strategies on tuberculosis, which causes serious complications to patients and resistance to existing agents, have been carried out globally.",

            "text": "Recently, new compounds, such as PA-824, SQ-109, linezolid, bedaquiline, ripafentine, moxifloxacin, and gatifloxacin, have been consistently developed as new/repurposed anti-TB drugs through chemical tailoring and remodeling of the existing antibacterial drugs, which are presently being tested in Phase II or Phase III trials [1] [2] [3] [4] . Furthermore, compounds such as pyridomycin, thiophenes, and Q203 have been developed as novel anti-TB drugs [5] [6] [7] . In spite of these efforts and anti-TB drug developments, the rapid emergence of TB and multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) or extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) has consistently worsened the public health problem worldwide. Until recently, medicinal plants used in traditional oriental medicine were utilized as traditional medical resources for treating chronic diseases and/or symptoms which are induced by viral and parasitic infections, hepatitis, and cancer, in both \"in vivo\" and \"in vitro\" [8] [9] [10] [11] . Furthermore, recently it was reported that various extracts and/or natural products derived from medicinal plants or traditional oriental medicines significantly indicated anti-Mtb activities/effects against Mtb [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . Thus, effective new anti-TB drugs with novel mechanisms of action, low cytotoxicity, and safety are urgently needed to inhibit and to combat the global tuberculosis epidemic. From these perspectives, artemisinin is an anti-malaria first-line drug derived from the plant Artemisia annua, and artesunate is a semi-synthetic derivative of artemisinin, a part of the artemisinin group. In addition, they are being effectively used as anti-malaria drugs. For this reason, this study started from the hypothesis that artesunate and artemisinin may effectively modulate or inhibit the growth/proliferation of Mtb causing tuberculosis. The main objective of this study was carried out to evaluate the anti-Mtb activities/effects of artesunate and artemisinin which are effectively used as anti-malaria first-line drugs, and to determine their potential as promising candidate drugs for developing novel anti-TB drugs for a safe/effective next generation.",

In this assay, after Mtb was incubated with different concentrations (150-600 \u03bcg/mL) of artesunate for seven days, it was inoculated on the Ogawa slant medium, and its growth units were determined after three weeks. When Mtb was incubated with 300 \u03bcg/mL of artesunate, its growth colonies were not observed or proliferated on the Ogawa slant medium, and all anti-Mtb first-line drugs strongly inhibited the growth of Mtb (Figure 4) . Particularly, the differences in drug susceptibility of Mtb were clearly confirmed when Mtb was incubated with 150 and 300 \u03bcg/mL of artesunate for 21 days with a single treatment. Furthermore, artesunate obviously showed its anti-tubercular activity/effect on the Ogawa slant medium by consistently inhibiting the growth of Mtb, and its minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was measured as 300 \u03bcg/mL. This result exhibits a similar tendency to that of the MGIT 960 system assay. Therefore, these results demonstrate that artesunate induces obvious anti-Mtb activity/effects in in vitro assay by effectively inhibiting or blocking the growth/proliferation of Mtb in a concentration-dependent manner.

From these perspectives, new pharmacological activities/actions of artemisinin and artesunate have been consistently reported since the development of anti-malarial drugs, as follows: (1) the anti-viral activities of artesunate against human herpes viruses such as human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), human herpesvirus 6A (HHC-6a), and Epstein-Barr virus [21] [22] [23] , as well as the inhibitory effect against hepatitis B virus (HBV) [24] ; (2) the anti-parasitic effects of artesunate and artemisinin against the proliferation of Toxoplasma gondii [25] [26] [27] and the eggs of the liver flukes in an animal model [28, 29] ; (3) the anti-fungal activity of artemisinin against fungi, such as Cryptococcus neoformans and Aspergillus fumigates [30, 31] ; (4) the anti-arthritic effects of artesunate and artemisinin against rheumatoid arthritis through multi-signaling pathways in animal models [32] [33] [34] ; (5) the anti-allergic activity of artesunate against allergic dermatitis in rat/guinea pig models [35] [36] [37] ; (6) the anti-bacterial synergistic effects by a combination treatment of artesunate with ampicillin or oxacillin against sepsis animal models induced by Escherichia coli and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) [38, 39] ; (7) the anti-cancer effects of artemisinin, which are caused by inducing or promoting apoptosis, and by inhibiting the growth of various cancer cells such as breast, colon, leukemia, and prostate cancer cells [40] [41] [42] [43] ; (8) the anti-allergic asthma effect of artesunate in a mouse model of allergic asthma [44] .

Particularly, the anti-Mtb activity/effects of artesunate were effectively demonstrated through selective anti-Mtb indicator assays such as the REMA, MGIT 960 system, and Ogawa slant medium assay, whereas the anti-Mtb effect of artemisinin was markedly low in activity compared with that of artesunate. In addition, artesunate showed its anti-Mtb activity and persistent effects by strongly inhibiting the growth/proliferation of Mtb for 21 days with a single treatment. In general, the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria consists of only a single-unit-thick peptidoglycan layer and a plasma membrane. Furthermore, the mycobacterial cell wall is composed of a multi-complex of heteropolymers such as peptidoglycans, arabinogalactans, mycolic acids, and capsular lipids. In this respect, the differences in the specificity and superiority of artesunate and artemisinin regarding anti-Mtb activity/effects were confirmed by sensitive anti-Mtb assays such as the MGIT 960 system and the Ogawa slant medium assay, and may be associated with the susceptibility of Mtb caused by the interaction between various biomarkers, including crucial proteins regulating metabolic mechanisms in the cell membrane system or cell cycle key proteins that cause biochemical reactions in proliferation stages of Mtb, as well as the specificity between the different methods to detect or to evaluate anti-Mtb activity/effects. The important aspects that can be considered at this point in time are that the intracellular signaling pathways of replication and the cell cycle key proteins in the cytoplasm may be blocked or deactivated by the compound at check points that accelerate the growth/proliferation of Mtb, which suggests that the energy metabolism of the plasma membrane as well as biosynthesis related to the multi-complex, biochemical reactions and/or functions of the cell wall can be inactivated or inhibited through binding of the compound and Mtb.",

In addition, it suggests that artesunate may act more effectively compared to artemisinin in the blood. Interestingly, this study showed that artesunate and artemisinin did not induce side effects and toxicity in in vivo tests, and that the compound-treated groups consistently induced the inhibition and decrease of Mtb, such as the isoniazid-treated group in in vivo tests. In addition, there were no differences in the survival rates in all groups. The results demonstrate that the compounds do not cause toxicity and side effects in in vivo tests when they indicate selective anti-Mtb activity/effects or inhibit the growth/proliferation of Mtb through their novel pharmacological actions/effects.",

Furthermore, the anti-Mtb activities/effects of artesunate and artemisinin were demonstrated through different anti-Mtb indicator assays, such as in the REMA, MGIT 960 system and Ogawa slant medium assay. In particular, artesunate strongly showed new anti-Mtb effects/actions and its pharmacological effects compared with those of artemisinin in in vivo tests. Furthermore, the animals treated with artesunate and artemisinin showed vitality and/or activity comparable to the normal group in in vivo toxicity tests, which did not indicate toxicity and side effects such as the loss of body weight, vomiting, and diarrhea. The results of this study not only indicated the potential and/or the advantages for the effective utilization of artesunate and artemisinin in medical fields, but also demonstrated novel pharmacological activity/effects and biological actions/functions regarding the anti-Mtb activity/effects.
