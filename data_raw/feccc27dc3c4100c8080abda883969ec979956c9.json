We grouped the sites into five clusters on the basis of geographic proximity and climatological similarity. Both DD > 0\u00b0C from observed data and R 0 estimated ANUSPLIN data from 1971 to 2010 at the sites in each cluster are shown in Figure S2 . The climatological similarity of sites within the clusters was supported by estimation of the Euclidian Distance of DD > 0\u00b0C calculated from ANUSPLIN data from 1971 to 2010 as a measure of similarity and Ward's criteria (Derry 2008; Munoz-Diaz and Rodrigo 2004; Romesburg 1990) for linking grid points with the highest similarity ( Figure S3 ). The clusters were: 1) Southern Ontario -the north shore of Lake Erie, 2) Huron Ontario -Ontario adjacent to the south-east extent of Lake Huron, 3) Upper Southern Ontario -Ontario adjacent to the eastern extent of Lake Huron close to Georgian Bay, 4) South-Western Quebec, and 5) Boreal region -the most northern sites in both Ontario and Quebec. The significance of variations amongst clusters in the relationship between modelled R 0 and DD > 0\u00b0C was tested in a linear regression model (STATA SE11.0: Statacorp, College Station, Tx). R 0 estimated by the tick model was the outcome while DD > 0\u00b0C and clusters (as a categorical variable) were explanatory variables. Adjusted for DD > 0\u00b0C (coefficient = 2.1E-03, SE = 4.5E-05, P < 0.001), R 0 varied 2 significantly amongst clusters (F = 163.4, df = 4, P < 0.001) suggesting that presentation of simulations from all clusters separately would be more rigorous than combining all data. Differences amongst sites and clusters in the relationship between R 0 and DD > 0\u00b0C can be explained by differences in seasonal patterns of daily temperatures: R 0 is slightly higher in South-Western Quebec than Huron Ontario even though DD > 0\u00b0C values are similar because, despite longer winters (when temperatures are below 0\u00b0C), mid-summer temperatures in South-Western Quebec are higher resulting in faster tick development ( Figure S4 ). and 5.

Host abundance (deer and mice in this model) will vary from location to location on both local and national scales depending on the specific suitability of habitat in each location for those species. Off-host tick mortality varies with the capacity of the environment of the surface layers of the soil, which provide the environment for ticks during the long period of development from one instar to the next, to protect the ticks from degrees of temperature, desiccation or flooding that result in greater mortality (Ogden et al. 2006 ). This results in many environments being unsuitable for tick survival, and partly explains the association between I. scapularis and woodland habitats. Woodland habitats do vary in their capacity to provide refugia for developing ticks, which is reflected in different mortality rates of ticks undergoing intersstadial development (Ogden et al. 2006 ).",
