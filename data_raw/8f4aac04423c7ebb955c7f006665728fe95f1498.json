Abstract The global HIV epidemic continues to grow, with 1.8 million new infections occurring per year. In the absence of a cure and an AIDS vaccine, there is a pressing need to prevent new infections in order to curb the disease. Topical microbicides that block viral entry into human cells can potentially prevent HIV infection. The antiviral lectin griffithsin has been identified as a highly potent inhibitor of HIV entry into human cells. Here we have explored the possibility to use transplastomic plants as an inexpensive production platform for griffithsin. We show that griffithsin accumulates in stably transformed tobacco chloroplasts to up to 5% of the total soluble protein of the plant. Griffithsin can be easily purified from leaf material and shows similarly high virus neutralization activity as griffithsin protein recombinantly expressed in bacteria. We also show that dried tobacco provides a storable source material for griffithsin purification, thus enabling quick scale-up of production on demand.",

One of the first potent antiviral agents that was found to bind to the HIV surface and block viral entry into cells was cyanovirin-N (CV-N), a small protein (11 kDa) of the cyanobacterium Nostoc ellipsosporum (Boyd et al. 1997) . It binds irreversibly to the surface envelope glycoprotein gp120 by targeting N-linked high-mannose oligosaccharides (Botos et al. 2002; Bewley et al. 2002; Barrientos and Gronenborn 2002) and, in this way, blocks binding of the virus to its receptors on host cells. Recombinant production of CV-N has been attempted in several systems, including bacteria, transgenic plants and transplastomic plants, but protein yields have been relatively low (Colleluori et al. 2005; Sexton et al. 2006; Gao et al. 2010; Elghabi et al. 2011; O'Keefe et al. 2015 ).",

While CV-N is active against HIV at low nanomolar concentrations, griffithsin displays anti-viral activity against all isolates of HIV already at picomolar concentrations (Mori et al. 2005; O'Keefe et al. 2009 ), thus making griffithsin a highly attractive candidate microbicide to prevent sexual transmission of the virus. In addition to its high specific activity against HIV, griffithsin is also extremely resistant to physicochemical degradation and shows high safety (Kouokam et al. 2011) . Preclinical development of griffithsin as a potential vaginal microbicide for prevention of HIV transmission is currently underway. Interestingly, griffithsin also displays strong affinity to the envelope glycoproteins of other highly pathogenic viruses, such as the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and Ebola virus (O'Keefe et al. 2010 ; Barton et al. 2014 ).",

            "text": "Development of griffithsin as an affordable anti-HIV microbicide will require inexpensive mass production of the protein, ideally from a renewable source and not requiring expensive fermentation procedures. Plants represent a particularly cheap, readily scalable and safe production platform for biopharmaceuticals (Ma et al. 2005; Daniell et al. 2009; Rybicki 2010; Marusic et al. 2009; Bock 2014 Bock , 2015 Wong-Arce et al. 2017) . Therefore, extensive efforts have been made to develop technologies that enable high-level expression of recombinant proteins in plants, including antibodies, antigens for subunit vaccines and microbicides. Expression of griffithsin has been tested in several expression systems, including viral vector-based transient expression in tobacco leaves (O'Keefe et al. 2009; Hahn et al. 2015; Fuqua et al. 2015a, b) and stable transgenic expression in rice seeds (Vamvaka et al. 2016) . While transient expression systems often give high expression levels, they incur additional costs due to the need to transfect each new batch of plant material. By contrast, in stable transgenic plants, the starting material for purification can be provided at the (very low) cost of the biomass. Also, stable transgenic plants provide greater batch-to-batch consistency than transiently transfected plant material (Fujiuchi et al. 2016) .",

            "text": "Transgene expression from the plastid (chloroplast) genome offers a number of highly attractive features, including precise transgene insertion by homologous recombination, absence of epigenetic gene silencing, and greatly increased transgene confinement due to maternal inheritance of plastids and their efficient exclusion from pollen in most crops (Maliga 2004; Ruf et al. 2007; Bock 2015) . The greatest attraction for molecular farming applications lies in the potential of chloroplast-transformed (transplastomic) plants to accumulate extraordinarily high levels of foreign proteins, often one to three orders of magnitude higher than what is possible to achieve by nuclear transgenesis (De Cosa et al. 2001; Tregoning et al. 2003; Molina et al. 2004; Zhou et al. 2008; Oey et al. 2009a, b) . However, it is important to note that, while there are numerous cases of spectacularly high expression levels achieved in transplastomic plants, not all foreign proteins accumulate stably in transgenic chloroplasts. Unfortunately, the rules governing protein stability in plastids are only poorly understood (Apel et al. 2010; De Marchis et al. 2012 ) and, thus, predictions about the success of recombinant protein accumulation in chloroplasts are currently hardly possible. For example, transplastomic expression of CV-N in tobacco was undetectably low, but could be improved by fusion to N-terminal and C-terminal sequences taken from proteins known to be very stable in plastids (Elghabi et al. 2011) . Nonetheless, CV-N accumulation levels reached only 0.3% of the total soluble protein (TSP), a value that is two orders of magnitude below the levels attained with PlyGBS, one of the proteins whose N-and C-terminal sequences were used for stabilization of CV-N (Oey et al. 2009a; Elghabi et al. 2011 ).",

Although CV-N and griffithsin are similar in size and have a similar mode of antiviral action, their primary sequences are very different. Also, CV-N is a prokaryotic (cyanobacterial) protein, while griffithsin is of eukaryotic (red algal) origin. Thus, the two proteins likely evolved different (in)stability determinants which may have different effects on their stability in the chloroplast (representing a prokaryotic system). Expression of griffithsin from the chloroplast genome was attempted recently (Vafaee et al. 2014 ), but no accumulation levels were reported and no purification and activity tests were performed. We report here that griffithsin can be expressed to very high levels (of approximately 5% of the plant's total soluble protein) in tobacco chloroplasts and has similar anti-HIV activity as the recombinant protein produced in bacteria. We also show that, due to its enormous thermal stability, (i) griffithsin can be very easily purified from leaf biomass, (ii) high levels of intact protein can be extracted from dried leaves, and (iii) griffithsin isolated from dry tobacco retains high antiviral activity.",

Fig. 1 Generation of transplastomic tobacco plants expressing the anti-HIV protein griffithsin. a Physical maps of the targeted region in the tobacco plastid genome (Nt-ptDNA) and the transgenic plastid genomes in Nt-grft and Nt-grft-mf lines. The transgenes are targeted to the intergenic region between two plastid tRNA genes, trnfM and trnG (Zhou et al. 2008) . Expression of the grft transgene is driven by the plastid rRNA operon promoter fused to the gene10 leader sequence of coliphage T7 and the 3\u2032 UTR of the plastid rbcL gene. The aadA expression cassette consists of a chimeric plastid rRNA operon promoter and the 3\u2032 UTR of the psbA gene (Svab and Maliga 1993) . The expected sizes of the DNA fragments in RFLP analyses with the restriction enzyme BamHI are given below each map. The location of the hybridization probe is indicated as a black bar. b RFLP analysis of transplastomic Nt-grft and Nt-grft-mf plants. DNA samples were digested with BamHI and hybridized to a radiolabelled probe detecting the plastid genome region flanking the transgene insertion site. The homoplasmic state was evidenced by absence of the 4.5 kb fragment characteristic of the wild-type plastid genome and detection of the 6.8 kb fragment specific to the transformed plastid genome. Successful post-transformation excision of the aadA gene (Zhou et al. 2008 ) and generation of marker-free griffithsin-expressing transplastomic plants (Nt-grft-mf) was initially assayed with the psaB probe (detecting a 5.4 kb fragment) and further confirmed by hybridization to an aadA-specific probe (which exclusively detected the expected 6.8 kb fragment in the marker genecontaining Nt-grft plants). Wt wild type. c Inheritance assay and identification of marker-free transplastomic lines. Germination of the T1 generation of Nt-grft plastid transformants in the presence of spectinomycin revealed homoplasmic presence of the selectable marker gene aadA. While wild-type seedlings emerge white in the presence of the antibiotic, all seedlings of transplastomic plants are uniformly resistant to spectinomycin. The progeny of Nt-grft plants crossed to nuclear-transgenic plants expressing a plastid-targeted Cre recombinase (Nt-grft-2 \u00d7 Cre) segregates into 50% fully green seedlings (due to hemizygous presence of the cre recombinase gene in the parental line), variegated and completely white seedlings in the presence of spectinomycin. The white seedlings, expected to be completely devoid of the aadA marker, were rescued by transfer to antibioticfree medium, subsequently grown to maturity in the greenhouse and pollinated with wild-type pollen. Uniformly white appearance of the progeny (Nt-grft-mf) upon germination on spectinomycin-containing medium confirmed the complete removal of the aadA marker \u25c2 Determination of anti-HIV activity of purified griffithsin HIV-1 BaL neutralization assays were performed according to published procedures (Wei et al. 2003; Montefiori 2005) . 200 TCID50 (median tissue culture infective dose) of HIV-1 BaL were incubated with dilutions of purified griffithsin produced in tobacco or E. coli for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C in a total volume of 100 \u00b5L. Tobacco-and E. coli-produced griffithsin were titrated fivefold seven times in triplicate starting at 2 \u00b5g/mL. All dilutions were performed in growth medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% foetal calf serum (FCS), penicillin-streptomycin (100 units/mL and 100 \u00b5g/mL, respectively) and 2 mM L-glutamine. The mixture was then added to 100 \u00b5L of TZM-bl cells expressing CD4, CCR5 and the firefly luciferase gene under the control of the HIV long-terminal repeat sequence and grown in medium preseeded at a concentration of 1 \u00d7 10 5 cells/mL. A positive control (cells plus virus) and a cell-only background control were also included. After a 24 h incubation at 37 \u00b0C in 5% CO 2 followed by addition and incubation with lysis buffer, the cell lysate was removed and mixed in a 1:1 ratio with Bright Glo reagent (Promega) in a 96-well black solid plate for luminescence measurements. The percentage reduction in relative light units (RLU) was calculated relative to the RLU of the positive control (cells plus virus). The resulting curve was plotted and analyzed in GraphPad Prism (https :// www.graph pad.com/).",

To facilitate protein purification, an N-terminal histidine tag (His 6 ) was added to the coding region (NCBI accession number AY744144.1).

Successful transformation and correct targeting of the grft and aadA transgenes to the intergenic spacer separating the trnfM and trnG genes by homologous recombination was analyzed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis using Southern blotting (Fig. 1a, b) . The results showed the expected hybridization patterns in RFLP analyses with either a probe derived from a neighboring gene in the plastid genome or a probe recognizing the aadA marker gene (Fig. 1b) . Absence of a hybridization signal for the wild type-specific fragment preliminarily suggested that the lines were homoplasmic.

To this end, we crossed homoplasmic transplastomic Nt-grft lines (maternal parent) to a nuclear transgenic Cre-expressing line (pollen donor). The progeny was raised on spectinomycin-containing medium to identify seedlings whose plastid genome was devoid of the aadA gene due to Cre-mediated excision from all copies of the plastid genome. These seedlings were easily recognizable by their spectinomycin-sensitive (pale) phenotype. As expected, the progeny segregated into homogeneously pale (complete aadA excision), variegated (incomplete aadA excision) and green (no or low-level aadA excision) seedlings (Fig. 1c) . Homogeneously pale seedlings were rescued by transfer to antibiotic-free medium, after recovery grown to maturity in the greenhouse and then crossed to the wild type (as pollen donor) to eliminate the Cre transgene and the linked nuclear antibiotic resistance marker (a gentamycin resistance gene; Corneille et al. 2001) in the next generation. The resulting completely marker-free transplastomic plants (Nt-grft-mf) have no nuclear transgene anymore, lack the aadA marker in the plastid genome and contain grft as the sole transgene (Figs. 1c, 2) . RFLP analyses by Southern blotting and inheritance assays ultimately confirmed that the aadA gene had been completely excised from all copies of the transgenic plastid genome (Fig. 1b, c) .",

Extraction was performed with wild-type plants (W) and griffithsin-producing transplastomic plants (G) to test the effect of different buffers in combination with heating on the abundance of contaminants. E in the sample designation indicates eluate (from His-tagbased purification), C indicates the concentrated sample (by ultrafiltration; see \"Materials and methods\"). The loaded sample volumes were adjusted to allow for direct comparison of protein purity and assessment of protein loss. Abundant bands are marked at the right: contaminants (c), griffithsin (G), griffithsin dimer (dG). The 'pH 8' purification was performed in QIAGEN 6xHis-tag purification buffer supplemented with 10 mM imidazole for extraction, 20 mM imidazole for washing and 250 mM imidazole for elution (E).

Washing and elution were done in buffer C (cf. a), supplemented with 20 mM imidazole for washing and 250 mM imidazole for elution. The 'pH 4, MgCl 2 ' purification is similar to the 'pH 4' purification, but includes 100 mM MgCl 2 in all buffers. Eluates were dialyzed and concentrated (C) in PBS buffer. Note that pH 4 extraction effectively reduced contaminations, and yielded 360 \u00b5g soluble griffithsin per gram leaf material.

            "text": "In the course of this work, we have investigated the possibility to produce the potent anti-HIV protein griffithsin in tobacco chloroplasts. Previous attempts to synthesize cyanovirin-N, a longer known but less potent anti-HIV protein, in trangenic chloroplasts had met with limited success (Elghabi et al. 2011) . Cyanovirin-N turned out to be rather unstable in chloroplasts and, although protein accumulation could be improved by fusion to N-and/or C-terminal sequences taken from highly stable proteins, accumulation levels remained relatively low (Elghabi et al. 2011) . By contrast, griffithsin, a protein of similar size but unrelated in primary amino acid sequence, accumulated in transplastomic tobacco plants to levels of up to 5% of TSP (Fig. 3) . Considering the small size of the recombinant protein (of only 14.5 kDa), this is an exceptionally high expression level that suggests that, unlike cyanovirin-N, griffithsin is highly stable in transgenic chloroplasts. It is important to note that the same expression elements were used for the transplastomic expression of cyanovirin-N and griffithsin, suggesting that the strong difference in protein accumulation is due to differences in protein stability. Why griffithsin is so much more stable than cyanovirin-N is currently unclear. Although some determinants of chloroplast protein (in)stability have recently been uncovered (Apel et al. 2010; De Marchis et al. 2012; Rowland et al. 2015) , we are still far from being able to explain why certain proteins are less stable than others (let alone to predict the stability of foreign proteins to be expressed in plastids).",

Leaves that had been dried and stored for 4 months were compared to leaves that had been frozen and stored at \u2212 80 \u00b0C until use. 200 \u00b5L buffer were added per 100 mg ground frozen leaf material. To compensate for water loss, 29 \u00b5L/mg buffer were added to ground dried leaf material. All extractions were performed with 'pH 4' buffer with an incubation step at either 22 or 70 \u00b0C for 15 min. The effect of freezing the dried tobacco samples in liquid nitrogen before grinding (N) was also tested. Griffithsin and its dimer were immunodetected with a griffithsin-specific antibody. b Silver-stained SDS-PAA gel (10%) illustrating the purification of griffithsin from dried leaves. Extraction was performed as in a. The eluate (e) was ultrafiltrated resulting in a color gradient of an upper light-colored fraction (cl) and a more dark-colored lower fraction (cd). 500 ng of 6xHis-tagged griffithsin purified from E. coli was loaded as a reference (G500). The loaded eluate volumes were adjusted to allow for quantitative comparison of input and eluate In this work, we also explored the possibility to use dry tobacco as storable material for recombinant protein purification on demand. Interestingly, griffithsin remained stable during drying and long-term storage and retained high antiviral activity (Figs. 5, 6) . The IC50 value of griffithsin extracted from dry tobacco is slightly higher than that of griffithsin purified from fresh biomass or from E. coli (Fig. 5c) . The reason for this difference is currently unknown and could be related to some activity loss upon drying and/ or storage or, alternatively, lower purity of the protein samples due to the different starting material and/or differences in sample preparation (leading to an overestimation of the griffithsin concentration and thus giving lower apparent activity). Nonetheless, similar to rice grains (Vamvaka et al. 2016) , dried tobacco leaves provide an attractive option for long-term storage of large amounts of raw material for griffithsin extraction upon demand. This is of particular importance to the potential use of griffithsin in the developing world, where the demand for anti-HIV microbicides is greatest. Although griffithsin can be expressed also to high levels by transient transformation of fresh biomass (O'Keefe et al. 2009 ), the procedures involved are too complicated and demanding to be implemented locally.",

Moreover, we have shown that dried tobacco can serve as source material for purification of griffithsin, thus enabling quick scale-up of production and rapid response to increasing demands.",
