            "text": "Human parainfluenza viruses cause a large burden of human respiratory illness. While much research relies upon viruses grown in cultured immortalized cells, human parainfluenza virus 3 (HPIV-3) evolves in culture. Cultured viruses differ in their properties compared to clinical strains. We present a genome-wide survey of HPIV-3 adaptations to culture using metagenomic next-generation sequencing of matched pairs of clinical samples and primary culture isolates (zero passage virus). Nonsynonymous changes arose during primary viral isolation, almost entirely in the genes encoding the two surface glycoproteins-the receptor binding protein hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) or the fusion protein (F). We recovered genomes from 95 HPIV-3 primary culture isolates and 23 HPIV-3 strains directly from clinical samples. HN mutations arising during primary viral isolation resulted in substitutions at HN's dimerization/F-interaction site, a site critical for activation of viral fusion. Alterations in HN dimer interface residues known to favor infection in culture occurred within 4 days (H552 and N556). A novel cluster of residues at a different face of the HN dimer interface emerged (P241 and R242) and imply a role in HPIV-3-mediated fusion. Functional characterization of these culture-associated HN mutations in a clinical isolate background revealed acquisition of the fusogenic phenotype associated with cultured HPIV-3; the HN-F complex showed enhanced fusion and decreased receptor-cleaving activity. These results utilize a method for identifying genome-wide changes associated with brief adaptation to culture to highlight the notion that even brief exposure to immortalized cells may affect key viral properties and underscore the balance of features of the HN-F complex required for fitness by circulating viruses. IMPORTANCE Human parainfluenza virus 3 is an important cause of morbidity and mortality among infants, the immunocompromised, and the elderly. Using deep genomic sequencing of HPIV-3-positive clinical material and its subsequent viral isolate, we discover a number of known and novel coding mutations in the main HPIV-3 attachment protein HN during brief exposure to immortalized cells. These mutations significantly alter function of the fusion complex, increasing fusion promotion by HN as well as generally decreasing neuraminidase activity and increasing HN-receptor engagement. These results show that viruses may evolve rapidly in cul-Volume 9 Issue 4 e00898-18 \u00ae mbio.asm.org 1 ture even during primary isolation of the virus and before the first passage and reveal features of fitness for humans that are obscured by rapid adaptation to laboratory conditions.",

We used metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) of field strains of HPIV-3 isolated from humans to analyze the diversity and commonalities of circulating HPIV-3 strains at the genomic level, and we simultaneously sequenced paired specimens that were subjected to culture for viral isolation. The sequencing strategy we used to sequence clinical strains directly without passage in immortalized cells does not rely on designing sequence-specific primers that may amplify only a subset of samples (in case of mutations) (24) . Deep genomic sequencing of nine sets of paired clinical samples (primary nasal swabs in viral transport medium) and culture isolates (culture harvest from zero passage virus) led to discovery of a number of HN mutations associated with rapid evolution in culture. To assess the frequency of mutations identified earlier, we also performed deep sequencing of 118 HPIV-3 clinical samples and culture isolates from the University of Washington Virology Laboratory, allowing us to confirm that the alterations associated with brief exposure to culture for viral isolation were almost entirely found in the sequences of culture isolates and found commonly within populations of viruses in those isolates.",

These results support the notion that clinical strains differ from cultured viruses in the balance of fusion properties. The locations of the residues that differ after brief culture of clinical viruses point to specific domains that are relevant to the control of viral entry in vivo. The sequencing data, when correlated to functional data, help define the flexibility and constraints of the HPIV-3 fusion complex. These data provide the first characterization of culture-associated HN mutations in the background of HPIV-3 clinical strains directly from patient samples. We show that, even during transient exposure to culture (\"zero passage\" virus), the act of isolating a virus is associated with genomic evolution that may significantly affect viral protein function and not reflect in vivo dynamics.",

We investigated the variant alleles with a minor allele frequency of \u03fe5% that arose in culture. The nine swabs included one clinical sample that was independently cultured twice, such that ten viral isolates were sequenced. Clinical respiratory samples that tested positive for HPIV-3 by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) with cycle thresholds under 25 were either sequenced directly by metagenomic nextgeneration sequencing (mNGS) without exposure to culture or grown on RhMK cells and viral isolates were harvested and sequenced. The choice of RhMK cells for this study was based on the fact that these are the standard cells used for viral isolation by many or most diagnostic microbiology laboratories and would allow us to answer the question of whether this standard process leads to alteration in the viruses.",

Previous comparison of direct clinical isolates with laboratory-adapted strains showed that every clinical strain bore asparagine (N) at position 556, while our laboratory strains bore aspartic acid (D) at position 556 (4). The HNs derived from clinical isolates (CIs) showed from 4-to 10-fold-higher neuraminidase activity than HNs derived from the lab-adapted strains, and the substitution of the aspartic acid at this position in the laboratory strains led to an approximately 5-fold-lower receptor cleavage in the laboratory-adapted strains, suggesting that the asparagine at position 556 is essential for the high propensity for receptor cleavage in field strains.

We mapped all the residue changes in the HN protein that arose during adaptation to brief culture onto the HPIV-3 HN protein crystal structure 4WEF (Fig. 4 ). All alterations localized to the dimer interface. We previously described critical residues at the HN dimer interface for HN's roles in receptor engagement and activation of F at H552-which we identified as the secondary sialic acid binding site-and in receptor cleavage at N556, shown at the top of the HN globular head dimer interface in the diagram (Fig. 4) . The diagram highlights the fact that N556 likely makes contact with the NAc modification of N523, and glycosylation could therefore have a significant effect on binding. We have shown that alterations that enhanced dimer contacts were associated with culture adaptation, while host fitness was correlated with reduced dimer contacts at these residues (6) . Alterations in residues 552 and 556 have been associated with other culture conditions Parainfluenza Virus Fitness for Host Tissues \u00ae as well (5-7), supporting the notion that this site is intimately involved in the mechanism whereby HN activates F in the natural host. The mutations P241L and R242K have not been described before and appear in a cluster at the opposing side of the dimer interface. The rapid emergence of alterations here during adaptation of a patient's HPIV-3 to culture suggests a role in viral entry in the natural host. Of note, P241 does not make specific contact with the opposing monomer, but a mutation would change the conformation of the loop significantly, thereby altering the contacts that the loop can have. HN mutations in site II and dimer interface modulate fusion promotion. To understand the selection forces that affect HPIV-3 fitness, we next analyzed the biological properties conferred by the culture-associated mutations in HN. Here we characterized the influence of each specific residue on the function of the HN-F fusion complex. To investigate whether the identified mutations altered HN's fusion promotion ability we had previously observed in clinical isolates of HPIV-3, we introduced seven of these rapidly emerging mutations into the background of a well-characterized clinical isolate HN, clinical isolate 1 (CI-1) (4, 5). We paired these mutated HN proteins with a lab-adapted F to ensure that we could observe adequate levels of fusion to compare function, since clinical isolate HN and F pairs result in nearly unobservable levels of fusion (4) . Fusion promotion by each of these mutant HN-F pairs was quantified with a \u2424-galactosidase complementation assay and compared to the wildtype clinical isolate HN (CI WT) paired with the lab-adapted F (Fig. 5) . We included an influenza A virus hemagglutinin (HA) and F pair as a positive control for fusion, as it had been previously shown that HN has a stabilizing property that prevents F triggering; that is, an increase in fusion relative to the CI WT would be expected and was seen (11) . The fusion exhibited by all mutant HN-F pairs was considerably higher than that of the CI WT HN-F pair, ranging from a 20-fold increase (HN S554N) to a 100-fold increase (HN L555F).",

After observing that fusion promotion was increased by all HN mutants, we examined several interacting properties of HN (see introduction) that are involved in this process. We assessed the neuraminidase (receptor cleavage) activity and also quantified the release of receptor-bearing erythrocytes (RBCs) from HN-expressing cells as a measure of the balance between avidity and receptor-cleaving properties. Neuraminidase activity was measured through the cleavage of 2=-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-\u2423-D-N-acetylneuraminic acid, sodium salt hydrate (4-MUNANA) by HN (Fig. 6A) . As previously described, almost all the culture-adapted HN mutants displayed lower neuraminidase activity than CI WT, ranging from roughly 10% (L555S) to 40% (R242K) relative activity (4). The H552Q mutant had increased neuraminidase activity, with roughly 260% activity relative to CI WT. We have previously shown that this mutation at H552 on HN confers both higher receptor avidity and intrinsically enhanced triggering of F and thereby augments fusogenicity, an effect that overrides the increase in receptor cleavage (see the release assay below) (26) . Release of bound receptor-bearing RBCs by cell surface HNs reflects the balance of neuraminidase activity, which would release the bonds tethering the cells, and avidity of the HNs, which retain the bound cells (Fig. 6B) . We quantified the amount of RBCs released at several time points when incubated at pH 7.5 and 37\u00b0C. Differences between the HNs was most readily observed at the earliest time point of 15 min, when CI WT had the most release (~77%), whereas the mutant HNs all had less release, reflecting either their higher receptor avidity, lower neuraminidase activity, or both. We observed two separate groups of mutants in their capability to release RBCs. A more rapidly releasing group-P241L, R242K, and S554N-had roughly 60% release at 15 min and complete release (~100%) after 120 min. In contrast, the more slowly releasing group, consisting of H552Q, L555F, L555S, and N556D, had 5 to 15% release at 15 min and 85 to 95% release after 120 min. As noted above, the higher receptor avidity of HN can override the higher-than-WT neuraminidase activity. (Fig. 7B, yellow squares) , producing no detected progeny compared to a titer of 10 3 to 10 4 PFU/ml for each of the viruses bearing a single adaptive HN mutation. The growth in CV-1 cells reveals that while the clinical virus is severely handicapped in monolayer culture, the mutations that emerged during the RhMK culture isolation process confer growth in these monolayer cultures. While the wt CI shows negligible fitness in monolayer culture compared to the adapted viruses on day 1, by day 3 infectious virus is released into the supernatant fluid of the virus to cell culture. At day 7 however, adaptive mutations have appeared (Table 1 ) and correlate with increased production of infectious particles (Fig. 7B, yellow  squares) .",

We hypothesized that even during such brief periods of culture, mutations arising in the HN-F fusion complex could be informative about features essential for growth in humans that would be stringently selected against in culture. HPIV-3 evolution upon exposure to culture was extraordinarily rapid and almost entirely limited to the HN protein. Bioinformatic analyses of existing HN sequences revealed that HN mutations that arose during brief exposure to culture are almost uniformly found in consensus sequences from HPIV-3 that are either adapted to culture or exposed to culture-and not found in HPIV-3 sequenced directly from clinical samples. Deep sequencing of 118 newly derived HPIV-3 isolates and clinical samples revealed that more than one-third of HPIV-3 isolates had subpopulations of HN dimer interface variants that were not reflected in consensus sequences and were not present in HPIV-3 sequences obtained directly from clinical samples.

Remarkably, all the mutations map to the dimer interface and receptor binding site II of HN. These results point to the critical role of this region in the HPIV-3 entry mechanism and for fitness in vivo, as we have deduced from smaller-scale and mechanistic studies (4-7, 10). The H552 residue at receptor binding site II at the dimer interface of HPIV-3 HN influences HN's dimerization and its activation of F (6, 7). We have shown that the presence of the glutamine at position 552 at the dimer interface of the HPIV-3 HN increases HN oligomerization and thereby modulates F triggering, with this HN more actively triggering F (6, 10). When the virus bearing this mutated HN was subjected to growth in human airway, it rapidly acquired a compensatory mutation, Q559R, which reduced fusion triggering and reduced HN dimerization. Structural analysis of footprints of the dimer interfaces showed that when HN H552Q is present in receptor binding site II, more of the interface residues are in contact with the opposing monomer face. However, in the HN with the Q559R compensatory mutation that permits growth in the airway, the dimer interface footprint shows decreased points of contact. The dimer interface footprint pointed to several residues and domains whose contact with the opposing monomer may be critical for the key functions governed by HN's receptor binding site II. The emergence of the H552Q mutation after brief culture highlights both the flexibility of HN's site II to adapt to new conditions and also the exquisite constraint of the virus's fusion complex with respect to alterations in the environment. Adjacent to the H552 residue in the dimer interface, but not making contact in the dimer interface footprint mentioned above, is N556, a residue we have previously shown to be highly conserved in all clinical strains. This residue was previously found to be an aspartic acid in laboratory-adapted strains, associated with a dramatic decrease in neuraminidase activity consistent with the overall high-receptor-contact/highfusion laboratory-adapted phenotype. In the present study, the N556D mutation emerged during the very brief exposure to culture, highlighting the advantage of lowering neuraminidase activity to reduce receptor cleavage for culture conditions versus the importance of neuraminidase for human infection. Within the same cluster, S554 was altered during culture adaptation; this is a residue that contacts the opposing monomer in the dimer interface cluster (6, 39) . The precise role of this residue in the functions of the dimer region will be explored.",

The selection for L239F, P241L, and R242K in the absence of mutations in the domain from positions 552 to 556 suggests that the newly identified important region in the HN dimer interface may act independently of receptor binding site II, and the functional relationships between these two sites will be explored in future studies.

We have shown that clinical viruses, compared to laboratory strains, have a combination of high neuraminidase, low avidity, low F triggering, resulting in lower fusogenicity. The HN mutants that emerged here all except for HN H552Q had decreased neuraminidase activity. It is of interest that mutations at site II affect neuraminidase enzymatic activity, since this site is not known to possess enzymatic activity, which resides in the bifunctional active site at T193/D216 (12, (40) (41) (42) . One mechanistic conjecture that will be explored is that alterations or interactions at one HPIV-3 HN site (site I or II) modulate the function of the other site, as we have shown for another paramyxovirus, Newcastle disease virus, where receptor interaction at HN site I leads to the activation of site II (43, 44) . These data may suggest an unexplored cross talk between site I and site II that could alter neuraminidase activity allosterically. All the mutants-including HN H552Q-showed reduced release of RBCs compared to the clinical strain. The HN H552Q mutant's decreased release of RBCs in the face of increased neuraminidase activity relative to the CI WT is in agreement with our previous finding that this mutation confers increased receptor avidity (26) that balances the receptor-cleaving activity for an overall retention of contact. Interestingly, the H552Q mutation in the lab-adapted HN background does not have higher neuraminidase activity (7), supporting the notion that the phenotype conferred by these sites may be modified in the context of the genetic background. Collectively, the pattern is of enhanced receptor engagement and an increase in fusogenicity that confers fitness in vitro. The genetically engineered viruses bearing the individual alterations in HN show that each is fit for growth in monolayer culture compared to the wt parent and less fit for growth in HAE. The mutations emerging during the brief viral isolation process thus led directly to fitness for growth in monolayer culture.",

The minor alleles were extremely biased toward mutations in the HN or F protein, with eight of ten cultures presenting minor alleles on the HN protein and four presenting a minor allele on the F protein, supporting the critical nature of the HN-F fusion complex for host adaptation (4). Intriguingly, single mutations in HN did not confer fatal growth disadvantage in the airway model, despite conferring fitness in monolayer culture. It will be of interest to determine whether an accumulation of several fusion-skewing mutations is necessary for an absolute inability to grow in airway and whether a more sensitive experimental system (i.e., infection in vivo) would be responsive to single alterations or only to a greater dimer interface disturbance.",

Whole-genome viral sequencing from clinical samples should be both technically and economically feasible, permitting investigators to avoid the use of laboratoryadapted strains of virus in immortalized cultured cell lines. The deep genome-wide screens of paired clinical samples and viral isolates allow for simple, rapid interrogation of viral evolution in the context of multiple clinical strain backgrounds. The methods pursued here allowed for discovery of novel HN residues of interest that heretofore had not been identified based on consensus sequence. Deep sequencing after rapid selection pressure may allow for discovery of a greater number of novel mutations that may be removed from the population by drift or competition with other variant subpopulations after longer selection periods yet provide clues to function. Other techniques that can more comprehensively profile single mutations, such as deep mutational scanning, are often limited by their use of singular backgrounds, often in the context of culture-adapted strains, and focus on singular proteins.",

Most of the adaptive genotypes could be found as minor alleles only by deep sequencing of clinical samples and viral isolates. With the increased provision of deep coverage viral genomes obtained directly from clinical samples due to diagnostic mNGS, experiments similar to the one outlined here will be critical for potentially pathogenic viruses in order to assess whether previous viral characterization studies apply to newly sequenced clinical samples (47, 48) .

All mutants were derived from this unique sequence. Recombinant viruses were generated by reverse genetics in the rHPIV3-CI-1-EGFP-F K108 background using a modification of methods previously described (57) . Briefly, 293T cells were seeded in six-well plates. The following day, the cells were transfected using ProFection mammalian transfection system, calcium phosphate kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's recommendations with 10 g of pFLC plasmid encoding the full-length viral genome, 40 ng of pCAGGS-HPIV3 P, 40 ng of pCAGGS-HPIV3 L, 200 ng of pCAGGS-HPIV3 N, 200 ng of pCAGGS-T7 polymerase, 100 ng of pCAGGS-HPIV3 lab-adapted HN, and 100 ng of pCAGGS-HPIV3 lab-adapted F (4). The following day, supernatant fluids were replaced with DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. Two days after transfection, the cells were mechanically detached by pipetting up and down and overlaid onto CV-1 cells in a 10-cm culture dish. Cultured cells were monitored by fluorescence microscopy until 70% of the cells were infected. The medium was replaced with DMEM without FBS, and cells were incubated for up to 2 days at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO 2 . Supernatant fluid was collected, centrifuged at 300 \u03eb g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C, aliquoted, and kept at \u03ea80\u00b0C until use. All recombinant viruses were sequenced at this stage using the same mNGS methods detailed above on 50 l of supernatant fluid to confirm the correct CI backbone and HN mutation sequences before use in experiments.",

The HAE EpiAirway AIR-100 system (MatTek Corporation) consists of normal human-derived tracheo/bronchial epithelial cells that have been cultured to form a pseudostratified, highly differentiated mucociliary epithelium closely resembling that of epithelial tissue in vivo. Upon receipt from the manufacturer, human airway epithelium (HAE) cultures were transferred to six-well plates (containing 1 ml medium per well) with the apical surface remaining exposed to air and incubated at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO 2 . HAE cultures were infected with 5,000 PFU of recombinant clinical isolate 1 EGFP (5) (referred to as CI-1-EGFP-F K108) at the apical surface for 90 min at 37\u00b0C.

At 90 min, the medium containing the inoculum was removed, and cultures were placed at 37\u00b0C and fed each day with 1 ml medium via the basolateral surface.

To assess the relevance of the HN adaptations in the context of authentic virus and determine the fitness of the culture-adapted viruses in immortalized cells and human airway epithelium (HAE), we generated recombinant viruses bearing the HN mutations of interest on the genetic background of our well-characterized HPIV-3 clinical virus CI-1 (4) and containing an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) cassette between the P and M genes (rHPIV3 CI-1-EGFP). Each engineered virus was sequenced in full to confirm the mutations of interest. These engineered viruses permit us to evaluate the outcome of selection in terms of impact on fitness. HAE cultures at an air-liquid interface or CV-1 immortalized cell monolayer cultures were infected with viruses bearing wild-type (wt) CI HN, CI HN P241L, CI HN R242K, CI HN H552Q, CI HN S554N, and CI HN L555F and expressing EGFP.
