At each level, information is solicited to assess five key risks that are most relevant to each level of operations. The risks at the level of funders involve systematic neglect of certain areas, focus on donor' s interests over that of program recipients, ineffective co-ordination between donors, questionable mechanisms of delivery and excessive loss of funding to \"middle men\". At the level of managers, the risks are corruption, lack of capacity and/or competence, lack of information and /or communication, undue avoidance of governmental structures / preference to non-governmental organizations and exclusion of local expertise. At the level of primary recipients, the risks are corruption, parallel operations / \"verticalization\", misalignment with local priorities and lack of community involvement, issues with ethics, equity and/or acceptability, and low likelihood of sustainability beyond the end of the program' s implementation.",

The first type is rooted in epidemiology and focuses on understanding the present burden of disease and the reduction in that burden (ie, morbidity and mortality) that a project or policy could achieve. Most recently, the 'lives saved' terminology has been adopted by agencies such as the Global Fund and used to drive evidence-based health policy [4] . To support this, resources have been invested (eg, by the UN agencies and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington-Seattle) in generating more comprehensive and detailed estimates of global, regional and national disease burden and in getting this information into the hands of decision-makers [5] . While successful at identifying the major causes of morbidity and mortality, the focus on the burden of disease as the dominant criterion for priority setting has been criticized [6] .",

Policy makers at the national and sub-national level have limited resources for scaling up cost-effective health interventions in their populations [7] . When planning the \"best buys\" for committing their resources, they are faced with a complex task. They need to choose among at least several dozen interventions that target various diseases and vulnerable populations and decide on the most rational way to invest in the scale up of selected health interventions. Health investors usually like to know how many deaths (or episodes of disease) could be averted for a fixed level of investment. The more deaths averted per fixed investment, the more costeffective the scale up. When the cost is low and the number of averted deaths high the intervention scale-up is highly cost-effective. When the cost is high and the number of averted deaths low then the intervention scale-up is not cost-effective. This type of analysis has been promoted by the World Bank, the Commission on Macroeconomics and Health and the recent report \"Global Health 2035\" [8] [9] [10] .",

Collective knowledge and crowdsourcing refer to the process of taking into account the collective input of a group of individuals rather than of a single expert (or small number of experts) to answer a question [12] . This is based on the observation that the average of collective judgments is closer to the truth than any single expert judgment in most circumstances [12] . The pre-requisites for this process to work are: (i) diversity of opinion (each person should have private information even if it is just an eccentric interpretation of the known facts); (ii) independence (people' s opinions are not determined by the opinions of those around them); (iii) decentralization (people are able to specialize and draw on local knowledge); and (iv) aggregation (some mechanism exists for turning private judgments into a collective decision -in this case, the PLANET method) [12] . Once each individual is given an opportunity to express their opinion in a way that is treated equally with respect to the opinion of any other individual, then the personal biases that those individuals bring into the process tend to cancel and dilute each other regardless of who the participants are. What is left is information based on the accumulated knowledge, lifetime experience and common sense of those who took part. This collective knowledge illustrates that disagreement and contest, rather than consensus and compromise, among independent minds can lead to the best decisions [12] .",

In theory, if the total sum was known, if it was all coordinated centrally, and if appropriate evidence on the \"architecture\" of missed development potential was available globally, then there would be one optimal way to invest these resources with the maximum possible impact, while all other approaches would achieve a lesser improvement in global development. In this process, the funding can be thought of the \"energy\" or \"resource\" required to fill the gaps in development, while all steps through which these funds need to be taken during this process can be seen as potentially retarding forces which may cause deviations from the most effective approach. These forces do not disappear even if more money is injected into the system. A problem is that, in reality, we neither have the detailed evidence nor the information required for the optimization of the process of DAH, nor can we monitor and centrally coordinate the flows of funding.",

[14] , we identify three functions associated with DAH and the associated stakeholders. The first function is labeled 'providing' and is concerned with the need to raise or generate funds (the funders of DAH) to improve global health through development. The second function is 'managing' and is concerned with the management or pooling of those funds, as well as with mechanisms for channeling funds to recipients (the managers of DAH). The third function is 'spending' and is concerned with expenditure and consumption of those funds (the recipients of DAH). It is worth noting that while this schematic establishes a clear time sequence of the key events in the DAH process, several actors work across all three levels simultaneously. Nevertheless, similar to McCoy et al. 2009 [14] , we believe that these categories provide a useful framework for studying the DAH process.",

First, donors could misalign the size of their support (financial commitment) with the size of the problem (burden of disease). An unprecedented amount of money is being pledged and used to fund health services throughout the world. However, several studies have shown that funding does not correspond closely to burden [2] . For example, Shiffman demonstrates that within communicable diseases for the years 1996 to 2003, there were several neglected topics such as acute respiratory infections and malaria [15] . Similarly, Sridhar & Batniji noted that in 2005, funding per death varied widely by disease area from US$ 1029.10 for HIV/AIDS to US$ 3.21 for noncommunicable disease [16] . The reasons for this misalignment could be due to the social construction of the problem [17] , lobbying by vested interests [18] or the personal ed and well-meaning initiatives which descend with good intentions on countries in the developing world [23] . However ambitious or well-intentioned these initiatives might be, it becomes difficult in this environment for recipient governments to develop and implement sound national plans for their country. While there is, in general, little incentive for various development partners to coordinate their activities, some development projects work better through a joint strategy. Thus, the risk that development partners will fail to coordinate their activities for a specific project needs to be established.",

NGOs, global health research institutions and UN bureaucracies also have an interest in increasing or maintaining their level of income and thus tend to prefer that funding from major donors flows through them (as managers of funding), rather than directly to developing countries. Further scrutiny is needed on aid flows in global health to assess whether they are being captured by vested interests and used to support inappropriate spending on the private commercial sector or on a large and costly global health bureaucracy and technocracy.

For ex-ample, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation might be willing to take a major risk for a high-payoff while public donors such as the UK government might be looking to minimize risk and under those conditions to maximize health outcomes. The outcome would be a comprehensive list with competing priorities ranked according to the combined scores they received in the process. Such a list would be helpful because it provides an overview of the strengths and weaknesses of competing DAH options against many criteria, based on the collective input of technical experts.

Information /communication technology becoming a digital utility enables us now to seek input from hundreds or thousands of independent individuals at little higher cost than asking one person. We can now, in real-time, in almost every country or setting collect feedback or opinions from an estimated 6.8 billion people who actively use mobile phones (with the proportion of smartphones rapidly growing) [36] . This can be done through text-message [37, 38] , automated phone calls, dedicated apps, email or the internet in a device or platform agnostic manner. It is certain that this is redefining not just the norms of who provides a feedback or communication of their assessment of a programme and how and when this is done, but also how DAH and indeed health care is delivered or consumed. The PLANET questionnaire is currently being developed into an app that would be freely available to all governments, international institutions and individuals looking for a simple, techfriendly tool to plan, monitor and evaluate DAH.",

First, it presents a standardized methodology that can be used for planning, monitoring and evaluation of any type of DAH project, but it also has sufficient flexibility to be tailored to the context of specific projects or initiatives. PLANET would be an additional tool available to policy-makers, along with LiST (for health care/interventions) [39] and CHNRI (for health research) [13] which will involve local experts and incorporate issues of local context in the process of determining priorities in a transparent, user-friendly, replicable, quantifiable and specific, algorithm-like manner. Second, it is simple to implement and with the development of mobile-phone software, should be able to be run anywhere in the world at low-cost. The low-cost of input means it can be run multiple times resulting in real-time monitoring of DAH. Third, while respondents are protected through anonymity in feedback, the results are provided transparently. Finally, the exercise gives equal voice to all those involved in the process of development from the donor (eg, in London, Seoul or Seattle) to a manager and to a recipient (in rural Uganda, Dhaka or Antigua).",
