Chemoprevention has been the most effective strategy for lung cancer prevention. Thus, exploring novel and effective candidate agents with low toxicity for chemoprevention is essential and urgent. Houttuynia cordata Thunb. (Saururaceae) (H. cordata), which is a widely used herbal medicine and is also popularly consumed as a healthy vegetable, exhibits anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antitumor activity. However, the chemopreventive effect of H. cordata against benzo(a)pyrene (B[a]P)-initiated lung tumorigenesis and the underlying mechanism remain unclear.",

In addition, H. cordata and 2-undecanone markedly activated the Nrf2 pathway to induce the expression of the antioxidative enzymes heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO-1). Nrf2 silencing by transfection with Nrf2 siRNA markedly decreased the expression of HO-1 and NQO-1 to diminish the reductions in B[a]P-induced ROS overproduction, DNA damage and inflammation mediated by H. cordata and 2-undecanone.",

Many advanced treatments, including medical, surgical and radiotherapeutic interventions, have provided little effective improvement in the survival rates of patients diagnosed with primary lung malignancies [2] . The strong link between cigarette smoking and the development of lung cancer has been known for decades. The risk of lung cancer is 6 to 10 times higher in smokers than in nonsmokers [3] , and almost 90% of patients diagnosed with lung cancer are cigarette smokers [4, 5] . Although it is widely recognized that smoking prevention and cessation are the best approaches to prevent lung cancer, tobacco-related lung carcinogenesis is still prevalent because of the difficulty in controlling smoking [2] . According to the WHO guidelines, chemoprevention has been the most effective strategy for lung cancer prevention, especially for smokers with existing pulmonary premalignancies [5, 6] . Therefore, it is essential and urgent to explore dietary factors that have the potential to prevent lung tumorigenesis.",

An evidenced-based study revealed that long-term exposure to B[a]P at a low dose could increase tumor incidence by up to 96.0% in animal models [8] . In part of its carcinogenic mechanism, B[a]P is metabolized into epoxide, which induces DNA adduct formation and causes mutations [9] . In addition, B[a]P-induced excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which results in oxidative stress, can lead to severe damage to DNA structure and is a prerequisite for B[a]P-associated tumorigenesis [10] [11] [12] . Additionally, oxidative stressinduced inflammation is one of the major contributors to lung cancer initiation and progression [13, 14] . ROS in the respiratory system can increase the levels of pulmonary inflammation mediators and then initiate or promote lung carcinogenesis [15] . More importantly, there is a close relationship between ROS-induced DNA damage and inflammation, which can together accelerate the process of lung tumorigenesis. On the one hand, DNA damage may lead to chronic inflammation, which has been associated with the development of lung cancer [16] [17] [18] . On the other hand, under inflammatory conditions, ROS are generated in inflammatory and epithelial cells and further cause oxidative and nitrative DNA damage [19, 20] . Therefore, the use of appropriate preventive pharmacological interventions that can effectively reduce B[a]P-induced DNA damage and inflammation has become an important strategy to prevent lung tumorigenesis.",

            "text": "Induction of enzymes that promote the detoxication of chemical carcinogens has been a broadly effective method for the chemoprevention of experimental carcinogenesis in rodent models [21] . The nuclear factorerythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling pathway has been targeted for the prevention of chemical carcinogenesis.Nrf2 has been identified as a key regulator of the inducible expression of antioxidative enzymes, antiinflammatory proteins and conjugation/detoxification proteins, including NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) [21] . Upon oxidative stress caused by B[a]P or pharmacologic induction, the Nrf2 pathway can be rapidly activated to counteract intracellular ROS generation, thereby attenuating DNA damage and inflammation promoted by B[a]P stimulation and contributing to reduced risk of mutation and subsequent lung tumorigenesis [21, 22] . Natural products are well known to exert their protective effects by removing free radicals, modulating the antioxidant defense system and performing carcinogen detoxification. To date, numerous compounds from natural plants have been found to activate Nrf2 signaling to effectively prevent B[a]P-induced lung tumorigenesis. These Nrf2 stimulators include sulforaphane, green tea phenols, curcumin, quercetin, catechin, and naringenin [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] . Unfortunately, most of the antioxidants have failed phase III clinical trials for chemoprevention because of their poor bioavailability and reproducibility and/or harmful outcomes [29] . Thus, exploring more novel and effective candidate agents with low toxicity for chemoprevention is essential and urgent.",

Growing evidence suggests that H. cordata performs a variety of pharmacological functions, including antiviral, antitumor, antileukemia, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antimutagenic functions [30, 31] . Furthermore, H. cordata is also popularly consumed as a healthy vegetable in East Asia [32] . Chemically, H. cordata is composed of flavonoids, alkaloids, volatile oils, sterols, fatty acids, and polyphenolic acids [33, 34] . Among the components, 2undecanone is a vital bioactive compound that exhibits various types of biological activity [35, 36] and is used as a standard marker for quality control of H. cordata in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia. According to modern pharmacological studies and clinical practices, H. cordata is especially suitable for the treatment of lung diseases. For example, during an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, H. cordata was proposed to be an effective alternative treatment [30] . H. cordata also exerts a protective effect against bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis [30] and may alleviate lipopolysaccharide-induced lung inflammatory injury [37] . It has also been demonstrated that H. cordata exhibits anti-lung cancer activity [38] . However, the chemopreventive effect of H. cordata against B[a]P-induced lung carcinogenesis and the underlying mechanism have not yet been explored.",

As shown in Fig. 4a DNA double-strand breaks induce histone H2A.X phosphorylation, which is associated with the recruitment of repair factors to damaged DNA. Thus, p-H2A.X has been used as a marker for DNA damage [41] [42] [43] . Hence, the protein levels of p-H2A.X in BEAS-2B cells and A/J mouse lung tissue were further determined by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 4b , compared with control cells (given water), cells treated with B[a]P showed markedly increased p-H2A.X protein levels (p < 0.001). In contrast to B[a]P exposure alone (in the model group), exposure to B[a]P plus 12.5, 25 or 50 g/kg H. cordata significantly decreased the p-H2A.X protein levels in a dose-dependent manner (p < 0.001). Similar results were also observed after incubation with B[a]P plus 25, 50 or 100 \u03bcM 2-undecanone, which significantly decreased the B[a]P-induced high expression of p-H2A.X in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4c, p < 0.001 ).",

A/J mice, which are highly susceptible to carcinogen-induced tumors, have been widely used as appropriate in vivo models to study the chemoprevention of lung carcinogenesis [5, 44] . The results showed that both H. cordata and 2-undecanone significantly reduced tumor numbers in B[a]P-treated mice in a dosedependent manner compared to B[a]P alone (Fig. 1c) . Moreover, the results obtained with the established B[a]P-treated BEAS-2B cell model showed that both H.cordata and 2-undecanone could effectively protect normal BEAS-2B cells from B[a]P-induced injury in a dose-dependent manner (Figs. 2 and 3) . The combined results suggested that H.cordata could effectively prevent normal lung cells from B[a]P-initiated lung tumorigenesis and that 2-undecanone could be the bioactive compound responsible for this pharmacological activity.",

This issue clearly indicates that safe and efficacious agents are urgently needed for cancer prevention. Various herbal medicines and diet-derived natural products maybe candidates for this purpose. H. cordata is well known as a widely used medicinal herb with a variety of pharmacological functions [30, 31] and is also popularly consumed as a healthy vegetable in East Asia [32] . Thus, the toxicity of H. cordata was also determined in vivo and in vitro in this current study. Our data revealed no significant body weight differences between B[a]P control group A/J mice and treatment group A/J mice during the experiment (Fig. 1b) . Moreover, no considerable differences were observed in the indexes of the heart, kidney, thymus, liver and spleen between the B[a]P control group and the treatment groups (Fig. 1d ). In addition, incubation with H.cordata or 2-undecanone alone could not produce toxicity in normal BEAS-2B cells (Fig. 2a . These preliminary data implied that H.cordata could be a potential effective agent for the chemoprevention of lung carcinogenes is that does not cause severe systemic toxicity.",

It has been reported that DNA damage is significantly associated with increased lung cancer risk and is considered to be the primary cause of lung cancer development [45, 46] . The roles of DNA damage repair pathways in cancers have attracted widespread interest in the clinic and have been widely recognized as vital targets to improve lung cancer therapy [47] . Hence, the effects of H. cordata and 2-undecanone on B[a]P-induced DNA damage were further investigated. The results from the comet assay showed that H. cordata and 2-undecanone could notably reduce the fluorescence in migrated DNA and the tails of disrupted DNA fragments (Fig. 4a) , suggesting that H. cordata and 2-undecanone could effectively reverse B[a]P-induced DNA damage. The levels of p-H2A.X, which is a verified marker for DNA double-strand breaks and is involved in the response to DNA damage [41] [42] [43] , were determined in vitro and in vivo. The results showed that exposure to H. cordata or 2-undecanone significantly decreased the B[a]P-induced overexpression of p-H2A.X in a dosedependent manner in the cells (Fig. 4b-d) . p-H2A.X protein levels in the lung tissues of mice were further determined. It was observed that both H. cordata and 2undecanone significantly downregulated p-H2A.X expression in B[a]P-treated mice compared with B[a]P treatment alone ( Fig. 4e and f ) . Our results indicated that H. cordata and 2-undecanone could effectively reverse B[a]P-induced DNA damage in vitro and in vivo.",

            "text": "In addition to DNA damage, oxidative stress-induced inflammation is also a major contributor to lung cancer initiation and progression [13, 14] . Mature and biologically active IL-1\u03b2, which is generated from the inactive precursor cytokine pro-IL-1\u03b2 and then secreted, is a critical regulator of the inflammatory response [48, 49] . IL-1\u03b2 is involved in a variety of cellular activities, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis [50] . Moreover, inflammation in the tumor microenvironment mediated by IL-1\u03b2 is hypothesized to play a major role in cancer invasiveness, progression, and metastasis [51] [52] [53] . Studies on tumor immunosurveillance have proposed a strong relationship between lung cancer risk factors and alterations in IL-1\u03b2 levels [54] . Antiinflammatory therapy targeting the IL-1\u03b2 innate immunity pathway can significantly reduce incident lung cancer and lung cancer mortality [55] . Hence, the effects of H. cordata and 2-undecanone on B[a]P-induced inflammation were also investigated. The results showed that treatment of cells with H. cordata or 2-undecanone significantly decreased the B[a]P-induced overexpression of IL-1\u03b2 in the cell culture supernatants (Fig. 5 a, b, e and f ). The same treatments also markedly decreased the high levels of pro-IL-1\u03b2 and IL-1\u03b2 induced by B[a]P in the cell lysates (Fig. 5a, c, d, e, g and h) , suggesting that H. cordata and 2-undecanone could effectively reduce IL-1\u03b2 secretion, thereby potentially reducing the inflammatory response. Furthermore, both H. cordata and 2undecanone treatment could significantly downregulate the IL-1\u03b2 levels in the plasma of the mice exposed to B[a]P (Fig. 5i) . Our results implied that H. cordata and 2-undecanone could effectively reverse B[a]P-induced inflammation in vitro and in vivo.",

However, NAC, a well-known ROS inhibitor, could markedly reverse the B[a]P-induced p-H2A.X overexpression ( Fig. 6b and c) . ROS reduction by NAC also significantly decreased the high levels of pro-IL-1\u03b2 and IL-1\u03b2 induced by B[a]P (Fig. 6d) . From these results, it was confirmed that DNA damage and inflammation could be significantly reversed by reductions in intracellular ROS levels, suggesting that the B[a]P-induced overproduction of intracellular ROS could cause marked DNA damage and inflammation. Therefore, the impact of H. cordata and 2-undecanone on of intracellular ROS levels was further investigated. It was observed that both H. cordata and 2-undecanone treatment significantly diminished the intracellular ROS overproduction induced by B[a]P ( Fig. 6e-g) . The correlation between ROS levels and DNA damage or inflammation was analyzed by using Pearson analysis. The results showed that the decrease in ROS levels was closely and positively related to the inhibition of B[a]P-induced DNA damage (Additional file 1: Figure S4 ) or inflammation (Additional file 1: Figure S5 ) by H. cordata and 2-undecanone. Given all the results, it was speculated that H. cordata and 2undecanone could protect cells against B[a]P-induced DNA damage or inflammation by reducing intracellular ROS overproduction.",

            "text": "Nrf2 has been identified as a key regulator of the inducible expression of antioxidative enzymes, antiinflammatory proteins and conjugation/detoxification proteins, such as NQO1 and HO-1 [21] . Upon oxidative stress caused by B[a]P or pharmacologic induction, the Nrf2 pathway could be rapidly activated to counteract intracellular ROS generation, thereby attenuating DNA damage and inflammation caused by B[a]P stimulation [21, 22] . The general cytoprotective effect of Nrf2 pathway activation has made it an attractive target for the chemoprevention of B[a]P-induced lung carcinogenesis. Hence, the modulatory effects of H. cordata and 2-undecanone on the Nrf2 pathway were further evaluated to clarify their chemopreventive functions against lung tumorigenesis. It was observed that both H. cordata and 2-undecanone significantly increased the protein levels of Nrf2, HO-1 and NQO-1 in whole-cell lysates (Fig. 7a ) and resulted in significant increases in nuclear Nrf2 protein expression (Fig. 7b) . The immunofluorescence results also showed that both H. cordata and 2-undecanone notably promoted the translocation of Nrf2 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (Fig. 7c) . Thus, it was implied that H. cordata and 2-undecanone could effectively activate the Nrf2 pathway to induce the expression of the antioxidative enzymes HO-1 and NQO-1. Then, it was found that B[a]P significantly decreased the protein levels of Nrf2, HO-1 and NQO-1 in whole-cell lysates (Fig. 7d ) and decreased nuclear Nrf2 protein levels (Fig. 7e) . In contrast, treatment with H. cordata and 2-undecanone markedly reversed the above-mentioned effects of B[a]P on the inhibition of Nrf2, HO-1 and NQO-1 expression (Fig. 7d and e) . Moreover, both H. cordata and 2undecanone treatment strikingly enhanced the expression of Nrf2, HO-1 and NQO-1 in a dose-dependent manner compared with B[a]P treatment in control mice (Fig. 7f-k) . Then, to confirm the role of Nrf2 in the protective effects of H. cordata and 2-undecanone against B[a]P-induced DNA damage and inflammation, Nrf2 expression was silenced in BEAS-2B cells by transfection with siNrf2-1 or siNrf2-2. The data showed that transfection of cells with siNrf2-1 or siNrf2-2 significantly attenuated the H. cordataand 2-undecanone-induced increases in the protein levels of HO-1 ( Fig. 8a and b) and NQO-1 ( Fig. 8c and d) . The reductions in B[a]P-induced ROS overproduction mediated by H. cordata and 2-undecanone could also be markedly diminished by transfection of cells with siNrf2-1 or siNrf2-2 ( Fig. 8e and f) . Furthermore, the attenuating effects of H. cordata and 2-undecanone on B[a]P-induced p-H2A.X overexpression were markedly diminished by siNrf2 transfection (Fig. 9a and b ). In addition, the culture supernatants of cells transfected with siNrf2-1 or siNrf2-2 and then treated with H. cordata or 2-undecanone showed no changes or weak reductions in the B[a]P-induced high levels of IL-1\u03b2 ( Fig. 9c and d) . As expected, the protective effects of H. cordata and 2-undecanone against B[a]Pinduced cytotoxicity were also markedly diminished by siNrf2 transfection (Fig. 9e and f ) . Based on the combined results in vitro and in vivo, it was speculated that H. cordata and 2-undecanone could effectively activate the Nrf2 pathway to induce the expression of the antioxidative enzymes HO-1 and NQO-1 and thus to counteract intracellular ROS generation, thereby attenuating DNA damage and inflammation causedby B[a]P stimulation and playing a role in the chemoprevention of B[a]P-induced lung carcinogenesis (Fig. 10) .",

The data from these well-controlled in vitro and in vivo studies indicate that H. cordata may exert beneficial effects against cigarette smoke-induced lung inflammation and oxidative DNA damage in the human body. Thus, H. cordata could be an effective candidate agent for the chemoprevention of lung cancer.",

Representative images showing haematoxylin and eosin staining of lung samples from the different groups. Figure S3 . Effects of B[a]P on viability of BEAS-2B cells. Cell viability was examined using the MTT assay. The data represent the mean \u00b1 SD (n = 3). # p < 0.05 and ### p < 0.001 compared with the control cells (given water). Figure S4 . Pairwise correlation between reduction in B[a]P-induced ROS over production and decreased p-H2A.X protein levels ratio in BEAS-2B cells by H. cordata (A) and 2undecanone (B). The correlations were analyzed by using Person analysis. Figure S5 . Pairwise correlation between reduction in B[a]P-induced ROS over production and decreased protein levels of pro-IL-1\u03b2 or IL-1\u03b2 in BEAS-2B cells by H. cordata (A) and 2-undecanone (B). The correlations were analyzed by using Person analysis. Figure S6 . The efficiency of Nrf2 silencing. Nrf2 expression was silenced in BEAS-2B cells by transfection of three Nrf2-specific siRNA (siNrf2-1, siNrf2-2 or siNrf2-3), respectively. The protein levels of Nrf2 were evaluated by using Western blot analysis. Data shown represent the mean \u00b1 SD (n = 3). *** p < 0.001 compared with the cells transfected with the control siRNA (siCtrl). siNrf2-1 and siNrf2-2 were selected for subsequent assays according to the efficiency of Nrf2 silencing.
