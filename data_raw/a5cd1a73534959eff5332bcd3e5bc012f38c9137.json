            "text": "In excess of 12% of human cancer incidents have a viral cofactor. Epidemiological studies of idiopathic human cancers indicate that additional tumor viruses remain to be discovered. Recent advances in sequencing technology have enabled systematic screenings of human tumor transcriptomes for viral transcripts. However, technical problems such as low abundances of viral transcripts in large volumes of sequencing data, viral sequence divergence, and homology between viral and human factors significantly confound identification of tumor viruses. We have developed a novel computational approach for detecting viral transcripts in human cancers that takes the aforementioned confounding factors into account and is applicable to a wide variety of viruses and tumors. We apply the approach to conducting the first systematic search for viruses in neuroblastoma, the most common cancer in infancy. The diverse clinical progression of this disease as well as related epidemiological and virological findings are highly suggestive of a pathogenic cofactor. However, a viral etiology of neuroblastoma is currently contested. We mapped 14 transcriptomes of neuroblastoma as well as positive and negative controls to the human and all known viral genomes in order to detect both known and unknown viruses. Analysis of controls, comparisons with related methods, and statistical estimates demonstrate the high sensitivity of our approach. Detailed investigation of putative viral transcripts within neuroblastoma samples did not provide evidence for the existence of any known human viruses. Likewise, de-novo assembly and analysis of chimeric transcripts did not result in expression signatures associated with novel human pathogens. While confounding factors such as sample dilution or viral clearance in progressed tumors may mask viral cofactors in the data, in principle, this is rendered less likely by the high sensitivity of our approach and the number of biological replicates analyzed. Therefore, our results suggest that frequent viral cofactors of metastatic neuroblastoma are unlikely.",

The disease is associated with an exceptionally low median age of presentation of 17 months [13] and is often diagnosed in utero. Metastatic neuroblastoma has two biologically divergent subtypes. Stage 4S is characterized by an age of presentation between in utero and 18 months, metastases confined to liver, skin, lymph nodes and bone marrow, and its ability to regress spontaneously [14, 15] . In contrast, stage 4 tumors are presented at any age, demonstrate high infiltration rates in bone marrow and bone, and are most often progressive [10, 16] . While genes related to neuronal differentiation have been described to be upregulated in stage 4S in comparison to stage 4 neuroblastoma, thereby indicating distinct levels of neuronal differentiation [17] , little is currently known about the differences between molecular etiologies of stage 4 and stage 4S neuroblastoma.",

Unfortunately, viruses are of polyphyletic origin and thus lack common universal marker genes as they are frequently exploited in metagenomics studies targeting cellular microorganisms. Consequently, it is not currently possible to specifically PCR-amplify viral nucleotide sequences within a given tissue without prior information about the infective agent being sought [26] . As a result, several systematic assays for pathogen detection have been developed that do not rely on targeted PCR-amplification of viral factors [27] and were employed to identify Kaposi's sarcomaassociated herpes virus (KSHV) as a human tumor virus [28] . These systematic approaches were recently supplemented by sensitive deep sequencing technologies [27] . These technologies were recently applied to exclude several cancer-virus associations based on negative evidence [29, 30] and aided in the identification of MCPyV, a human polyomavirus, as a cofactor of Merkel cell carcinoma [31] .",

In particular, our method maps sequence reads to a combined reference database comprising the human genome and all known viral reference sequences. The approach is configured to allow for high mismatch rates and mappings to multiple reference sequences ('multimaps'). By using this combined and sensitive mapping strategy, our approach is especially well suited for detecting human-viral chimeric transcripts and viruses diverging from known references. In contrast to existing subtractive approaches for viral transcript discovery, our method abstains from discarding reads homologous to the human genome from further analysis. Instead, Virana exploits multimaps to assign sequence reads to a homologous context comprising human reference transcripts and viral reference genomes. These homologous regions retain the full, unfiltered information contained in the raw sequence data while also being amenable to further analyses by multiple sequence alignments, human-viral phylogenies, and orthogonal taxonomic annotations, thus greatly aiding in the interpretation of the results.",

We configured the mapper for high sensitivity by following recommendations of the author of STAR (personal communication). In particular, we set the rate of acceptable mismatches to 0:3 times the length of each read and the seedSearchStartLmax and winAnchorMultimapNmax parameters to 12 and 50, respectively. The minimum length of chimeric segments (chimSegmentMin) was reduced to 15 in order to detect fusion transcripts at short read lengths. Known splice sites from splice annotations of the human reference genome as well as canonical splice sites were considered in the mapping. For each read, multiple mapping locations with alignment score distances of up to 10 ranks relative to the best score were permitted ('multimaps'). Read alignments were stored in standardized BAM files. STAR supports detection of chimeric transcripts by reporting discordant read pairs whose ends map to different chromosomes. These discordant read pairs were employed in further analyses as detailed in the next section.",

The second, more sensitive approach to detecting chimeric transcripts is based on paired-end read information. Since the STAR mapper assigns reads to a combined reference database comprising both human and viral reference sequences, ends of paired-end reads whose inserts span the breakpoint of a chimeric transcript will be aligned to different reference sequences.

Since viruses of the same taxonomic family often exhibit significant sequence similarity, reads that map to one family member often also map to related family members as well as to homologous loci in the human reference. Based on these primary and secondary mapping locations, Virana obtains overlapping human reference transcripts, viral genomic references, and viral taxonomic information pertaining to the location. For each sequence read, information obtained in this manner is collected in a data structure denoted as HIT. HITs originating from the same analysis panel are pooled for further analysis. (2) Second, pooled HITs originating from the same analysis panel are assigned to viral taxonomic families based on the viral genomic references they refer to (see Box 1 Algorithm 1). Sets of HITs assigned to the same viral taxonomic family are denoted as the homologous group (HOG) of that family. The same HIT may, in principle, be assigned to several HOGs. (3) Third, since reads and references generally share local rather than global sequence similarity, sequences in HOGs cannot conveniently be aligned in a multiple sequence alignment. This circumstance considerably complicates interpretation of homologous relationships between multiple reads and references. Virana therefore applies a three-step greedy clustering approach to split HOGs into manageable and alignable clusters denoted as homologous regions (HORs, see Box 2 Algorithm 2):",

TBLASTX bypasses synonymous mutations during similarity search and is particularly suited for detecting functionally conserved homologs. This approach is therefore recommended for discovering remote similarities [65] and is widely used in environmental metagenomics [66] . A permissive E-value threshold of 0:1 is used for all comparisons in order to reduce the possibility of missing true viral hits. For each query transcript and search strategy, the three highest-scoring reference sequences are extracted from the BLAST results. Subsequently, descriptions, taxonomic information, and available gene annotations for highscoring reference hits are pooled and query transcripts are assigned a putative viral, human, or ambiguous origin based on the pooled information. In order to limit the search space of the computationally intensive TBLASTX procedure, we constrain the allowed taxonomic origin of reference sequences to only viral (NCBI taxon ID 10239) or human (NCBI taxon ID 9606) hits while excluding artificial sequences (NCBI taxon ID 81077) using the NCBI database query ''",

By conservatively assuming that an idealized cell contains 200,000 mRNAs [34] of average length l fragmented at f~500 bp as a result of library preparation, an expected number of m~653,600 cDNA fragments are generated per cell. For a given viral transcript of length r and a viral transcript abundance x per cell, we expect a number of v~x r=f viral transcript fragments. Assuming a theoretical, unbiased sequencing process, the probability of sequencing a viral transcript fragment among the overall m transcript fragments is p viral~v =m. Given a single-end read length of j, a number k~rc=(2j) reads are required to achieve a sequence coverage c of that viral transcript. The probability p k viral of observing at least k reads during sequencing with a sequencing depth n is specified by the cumulative binomial distribution function with parameters k, n and p viral .

In contrast to related approaches such as RINS and CaPSID that rely on subtracting reads homologous to human transcripts from the analysis, our novel method Virana assigns sequence reads to a combined human-viral reference database without discarding homology information (see Figure 1 ). By employing a particularly fast and sensitive read mapper, Virana gains sensitivity at discovering highly divergent and chimeric viral transcripts. In addition, this configuration allows for exploitation of multimaps (e.g., sequence reads mapping to several reference genomes with varying mismatch rates) to discover the homologous context of sequence reads with regard to viral and human reference sequences. Last, Virana employs chimeric alignments as well as de-novo assembly of unmapped sequence reads followed by taxonomic annotation in order to discover proviral integration events and novel viruses, respectively.",

The background set is used to construct four additional validation data sets spiked with viral reads at increasing rates of sequence divergence (0%, 5%, 10%, 25%, see Materials and Methods). Performance is quantified in terms of sensitivity and specificity (see Materials and Methods). Applying all three viral detection methods on the validation data sets reveals comparatively high rates of correctly detected viral reads for CaPSID and RINS at low sequence divergences between 0% and 5%. Specifically, the two subtractive methods achieve 0:99{1:13 fold higher sensitivities compared to Virana (sensitivities of 0:835{1:0 versus 0:844{0:882 for subtractive approaches and Virana, respectively, see Figure 2 ). In contrast, Virana substantially surpasses subtractive approaches at higher rates of viral sequence divergence (10-25%), offering comparatively stable sensitivities between 7-fold and 182-fold higher than Capsid and RINS, respectively (sensitivities of 0:0008{0:6578 versus 0:1456{0:7880 for subtractive approaches and Virana, respectively, see Figure 2 , left panel). Notably, while subtractive approaches fail to identify 20-90% of viruses in settings of high sequence divergence, Virana is the only approach able to reliably detect the full set of viruses in all validation scenarios (see Figure 2 , right panel). As a result of Virana's ability to detect human-viral transcript homologs, reads originating from several human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) that are part of the human reference genome but technically also belong to the viral family Retroviridae are detected in validation data at all levels of sequence divergence. Since the detected HERV reads originate from the human rather than from the viral part of the validation data, these reads classified as false positive (FP) hits for the purpose of this validation. As a result of this artifact, Virana exhibits a slightly lowered specificity compared to subtractive approaches (0.99985 versus 1.0 for Virana and CaPSID/RINS, respectively). However, we note that HERV reads are correctly classified by Virana during homologous region construction and by optional BLAST-based taxonomic annotation. These reads can therefore be safely and automatically ignored in subsequent analyses if HERV expression is of no interest to the researcher.",

Three such humanviral homologs are used in the analysis: V-ABL of the acutely transforming retrovirus A-MuLV, Bo17 of herpesvirus BoHV-4 (a model virus for oncogenic gammaherpesviruses such as EBV and KSHV and implied in several animal cancers [69] ) and gag of HERV-K(HML2)22I, a class of human endogenous retroviruses associated with some forms of breast cancer [70] ). Validation is based on simulated sequencing data and split into two scenarios (see Materials and Methods for details). Within the first scenario, simulated sequencing reads are sampled directly from human-viral homologs while in the second scenario reads are generated from artificial fusion transcripts that each involve one of the three homologs fused to the human TP53 proto-oncogene.

Performance is quantified by detection sensitivity, specificity, as well as by the absolute number of reads correctly detected. While all methods performed at a perfect specificity of 1:0, only Virana detects viral transcripts at all coverages and with two to three-fold higher sensitivities compared to competing methods (Figure 4 ). In particular, sequence reads originating from endogenous retroviruses were almost always subtracted from the analysis by RINS and CaPSID. In addition, RINS seemed to be confounded by low sequencing coverage, a fact most probably resulting from its heavy reliance on de-novo transcript assembly. Subsequent analysis of discordantly mapped read pairs by Virana (see Materials and Methods) correctly identified the TP53 gene as fusion partner of both V-ABL and Bo17, indicating that detection of human-viral chimeras is reliable even at low twofold coverage. Due to the repeat nature of the HERV-K sequence in the human genome and the resulting re-occurrence of HERV-K homologs at multiple loci in the human reference it was not possible to unambiguously identify the fusion partner of the HERV-K gag gene.

Specifically, several bacteriophages of the taxonomic families Microvirodae, Myoviridae, Podoviridae, and Siphovoridae indicate sample contamination with bacteria as well as technical spike-ins (http://res.illumina. com/documents/products/technotes/technote_phixcontrolv3.pdf). Remarkably, the Coliphage phi-X174 genome of the family Microvirodae could be fully assembled by Virana's homologous region construction, yielding a single fragment of 99% sequence identity and 100% coverage compared to the phi-x174 reference genome. In addition, several retroviral and flaviviral hits at low abundances of 1{28 reads per million reads mapped (RPMM) highlight human factors such as HERV-Ks (endogenous retroviruses) as well as human proto-oncogenes SRC/ABL and DNAJC14/RP11 that have close homologs in the viral families Retroviridae and Flaviviridae, respectively. The taxonomic ambiguity of these regions is automatically identified during Virana's homologous region construction and confirmed by optional BLAST-based annotation compared to NCBI nt and nr databases (as indicated by thinner bars in Figure 7 ). Figure 6 . Estimation of required cellular transcript abundances for achieving a given transcript coverage. Sequencing coverage of viral transcripts is depending on the average number of transcript copies per cell in the sequenced sample, on the length of the viral transcript being sought, and on characteristics of the sequencing process. In order to better visualize the optimal sequencing depth required for detection of viral factors, we estimated the required number of transcript copies per cell for different sequencing depths. These sequencing depths are expressed as factors relative to the depths employed for the NB1/NB2 panel generated in this study (which are here reported as a relative sequencing depth of 1). doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003228.g006 Analysis of positive control samples resulted in 41 homologous regions (HORs)spanning five viral families (see Figure 7 , lower part). Viral cofactors associated with each of the cancer samples are correctly recovered at a high dynamic range of read abundances between 3 RPMM (HCC with integrated HBV provirus) and 1,628 RPMM (HeLa cell line associated with HPV18). In addition, several viral fragments were successfully reconstructed within HORs of the positive control samples, such as a 9,550 bp long EBV segment containing latency-associated factors EBNA 3b, 3c, and 4a (80% sequence identity with the wild type genome) as well as a 1,693 bp long HBV fragment containing the oncogenic HBV-X gene (98% sequence identity compared with Hepatitis B virus isolate HK1476). Similar to results on the negative control brain sample, several HORs with lower abundances assigned to the taxonomic families Retroviridae and Flaviviridae represent human-viral sequence homologies that are automatically flagged to be of ambiguous taxonomic status by Virana. Interestingly, the HCC sample was also investigated in recent work focusing on detecting viral integration events [52] . In this recent study, the authors confirmed one integration event by Sanger sequencing while alluding to two additional events still awaiting experimental validation. By analyzing discordantly mapped read ends, Virana could correctly identify all three HBV fusion events involving human genes TRRAP (11 read pairs), ZNF48 (11 read pairs), and PLB1 (6 read pairs) as part of the primary mapping procedure.",

It is characterized by a striking diversity in biology and clinical behaviour of its subtypes. This heterogeneity as well as supporting epidemiological findings are highly suggestive of infectious cofactors involved in genesis and maintenance of the disease [19, 20] . While several studies utilizing technologies with lower sensitivity compared to our approach have identified human polyomaviruses in neuroblastoma and pediatric embryonal tumors [22] [23] [24] , newer investigations seem to render these associations inconclusive [25] . However, viral commensals of the families polyomaviridae and adenoviridae are indeed suspected to acquire rare transforming properties as a consequence of viral latency or defective replication [72] and to encode oncogenes [73, 74] whose carcinogenic potential in human is currently investigated [8, 75] . We undertook the first systematic search for known and unknown viruses in transcriptomes of metastatic neuroblastoma by analyzing deep sequencing RNA-Seq data of 14 metastatic neuroblastomas from two tumor stages as well as positive and negative experimental controls.",

Among these methods, PathSeq, CaPSID and RINS are most prominent due to their design as reusable computational pipelines. In this study we selected CaPSID and RINS due to their high performance and public availability and compared their detection performance with that of our novel method Virana. Both CaPSID and RINS follow a subtractive approach, e.g. they separately map input data to viral and human reference sequences and subtract viral read mappings that are similar to the human genome from the analysis. While CaPSID is conceptualised as a generalised framework that supports the subtraction process by means of a database and a web server, RINS features an integrated pipeline that splits input reads into shorter fragments in order to increase mapping sensitivity, followed by transcriptome assembly of putative viral reads into full length transcripts.",

Such homologous transcripts may display human-viral sequence similarities of 86% (Bovine Herpes virus) and up to 92% (acutely transforming retroviruses). Subtractive approaches silently discard these transcript from the analysis due to their similarity to the human reference genome. In contrast, our novel method Virana follows a radically different approach. Instead of separate mapping to viral and human reference database followed by digital subtraction, Virana undertakes a particularly sensitive read mapping to a combined set of human and viral references. By allowing for multimaps, this mapping strategy facilitates discovery of viral transcripts regardless of their similarity to human factors. Apart from being conceptually simpler by relying on only one mapping step and discarding the subtraction procedure that is both possibly erroneous and computationally costly, this approach empowers the mapper to make informed decisions about relative alignment quality by weighing different human and viral reference positions against each other. As a direct consequence of this increased mapping quality, paired-end reads can be mapped across human and viral references, allowing for detection of human-viral chimeric transcription and proviral integration events.",

As a consequence, this validation favors subtractive approaches by reducing the danger of erroneous subtraction of viral reads that are similar to the human genome. In addition, the sequence divergence validation contained reads sampled at high coverage. However, transcripts of tumor viruses are often expressed at only low cellular abundances and are thus expected to have low sequence coverage. We therefore next validated the ability of viral detection approaches to detect viral transcripts homologous to human factors at varying levels of sequence coverage. Virana, by virtue of not relying on digital subtraction, demonstrated superior sensitivity at this validation both in settings of natural sequence homology as well as in cases of human-viral chimeric transcription. Specifically, Virana was the only method able to detect evidence for all viruses even at low twofold coverages. We observed that both RINS and CaPSID discarded a substantial amount of human-viral homologous transcripts due to their high similarity to the human reference genome, a fact that explains the lower performance of these methods in this validation scenario.",

Low concentration and extratumoral location of viral producer cells [8] or selection of growth-autonomous cells in progressed tumors [79] can significantly dilute the number of viral transcripts in a sample. Additionally, known tumor viruses such as high-risk HPV strains, EBV, and MCPyV selectively transcribe their genome during viral latency (HPV: E6/7 [80, 81] , EBV: EBNA1/2 [82] [83] [84] , MCPyV: large T antigen [31, 85] ), thus generating only low abundances of tens (MCPyV [31] ) to hundreds (KSHV [86] , EBV [87] ) of transcripts per cell. Last, transcription of human oncogenic factors modulated by viral [88] or endogenous [89, 90] retroviral promoters as well as 'hit-and-run' mechanisms of viral oncogenesis that imply loss of viral material [91, 92] may predispose cells to transformation without requiring maintenance of viral transcripts.",

Analyses of neuroblastoma transcriptomes resulted in the detection of putative viral transcripts with high local sequence similarity to several viral families. However, automatic taxonomic annotation as well as detailed manual inspection of homologous regions pertaining to these families revealed the human or bacteriophage origin of all transcripts. While we could find differences in the abundance of HERV-K transcripts between neuroblastoma stages 4 and 4S, the causative role of HERV transcription with regard to oncogenesis is currently unclear [94] and, as to our knowledge, only tentative associations with specific cancers have been made as to date [70] . Apart from these tentative differences in HERV-K abundances, no quantitative difference between neuroblastoma stages 4 and 4S could be identified with regard to viral transcription.",

This process results in a number of homologous regions (HOR) for each viral family. HORs are represented as multiple sequence alignments incorporating a wealth of sequence information.

            "text": "Due to a variety of factors (see Discussion) human tumor viruses often replicate at very low levels within the infected cell. Determining the required sequencing depth for detecting viral transcripts present at specific cellular abundances is therefore crucial for planning transcriptome experiments designed to identify tumor viruses. Based on statistical arguments and average mRNA sizes (seeMaterials and Methods), we inferred the minimal abundances of viral transcripts required in an average cell required for detection depending (1) on the length of the transcript being sought and (2) on the sequencing depth employed in the experiment. Here we report results for an average viral cDNA-transcript (795 bp), an average viral transcript region analyzed in the validation of human-viral homologs (Bo17 and vABL, 1,465 bp, see previous section), an average length human CDS (1,634 bp), and the genome size of a small tumor virus (A-MuLV, 5,896 bp). Based on these estimates and given an average sequencing depth as employed in the NB1 analysis panel, Virana requires a minimum twofold sequence coverage of an average viral cDNA transcript in order to detect the transcript within a homologous region with 99:9% probability (Figure 5, upper left quadrant, dashed blue vertical line). This sequence coverage is produced with 95% probability if at least one viral transcript is present per cell, on average (Figure 6, upper left quadrant, dashed blue vertical line). The number of viral transcripts per cell required for detection is inversely related to transcript length and sequencing depth, in principle: at a transcript length corresponding to a small viral genome (5,896 bp) and a per-sample sequencing depth of 1% of the sequencing depth generated in the NB1 panel, a transcript coverage of 0:6 and at least 55 viral transcripts per cell are required for reliable detection (Figure 6, upper right panel, dotted black vertical line).",

Probability of successful region construction by Virana depending on the lengths of the transcripts being sought, the region linkage parameter L, as well as characteristics of the sequencing platform employed. Colored areas represent overlapping standard error bands of the mean, denoting the uncertainties of the estimations. The probability of Virana to detect a homologous region depends on the length of the viral transcript being sought, the linkage parameter L of the homologous region, as well as the transcript coverage and read length of the sequencing platform employed. Given characteristics of the sequencing process applied for NB1 sample panel, an average viral cDNA of length 795 bp requires a minimal transcript coverage of 2 in order to be reliably detected using a linkage parameter of L~25 as employed in this study (upper left quadrant, dashed blue vertical line). Technologies affording longer read length as used for the NB2 panel typically also afford higher sequencing depths. However, at a fixed coverage these technologies generate a more highly fragmented region linkage due to a smaller number of longer reads, resulting in lower probability of generating contiguous homologous regions (lower left quadrant). Lower transcript coverage is sufficient for longer transcripts transcribed from a complete A-MuLV genome (upper right panel, dotted black vertical line) or smaller values of the region linkage parameter L. doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003228.g005",
