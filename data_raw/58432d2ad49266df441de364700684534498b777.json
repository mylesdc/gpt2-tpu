However, the virome of PEDV infected pigs and its effect on disease severity remains unknown. The advancements of sequencing technology have made it possible to characterize the entire microbiome of different body sites for any host. Methods: The objective of this study was to characterize the RNA virome in PEDV-positive pigs using the hypothesis-free metagenomics approach based on next-generation sequencing. Specifically, 217 PEDV-positive swine fecal swab samples collected from diarrheic piglets over 17 US states during 2015-2016 were analyzed. Results: A Kraken algorithm-based bioinformatics analysis revealed the presence of up to 9 different RNA genera besides PEDV (Alphacoronavirus genus), including Mamastrovirus (52%, 113/217), Enterovirus (39%, 85/217), Sapelovirus (31%, 67/217), Posavirus (30%, 66/217), Kobuvirus (23%, 49/217), Sapovirus (13%, 28/217), Teschovirus (10%, 22/217), Pasivirus (9%, 20/217), and Deltacoronavirus (3%, 6/217). There were 58 out of 217 piglets (27%) have PEDV infection alone whereas the remaining 159 (73%) shed 2 up to 9 different viruses. Conclusion: These findings demonstrated that PEDV infected diarrheic pigs had an extensive RNA viral flora consisting of four different families: Astroviridae, Picornaviridae, Caliciviridae, and Coronaviridae.",

Among them, PEDV, TGEV, PDCoV and PRoV have been well characterized for their role in clinical diarrhea and have been considered as major swine enteric viral pathogens while the causative role of the other agents in diarrheic disease has been characterized to a significantly less extent or remains to be further studied.",

In North America, PEDV was first detected in the United States (US) in 2013, which rapidly spread across the US in the subsequent 2 years [2] [3] [4] . The diarrhea caused by PEDV can result in dehydration in suckling piglets and eventually up to 100% mortality, which caused significant economic loss to the US swine industry [5, 6] .",

These applications have revolutionized infectious disease diagnostics and clinical microbiology. Therefore, HTS technology has obvious advantages over traditional diagnostic methods. However, most clinical samples are very \"dirty\" and composed of both host and microbial nucleic acids; in most cases, 99% of nucleic acid contained in samples belong to either the host or other microorganisms of no interest. As a result, searching for particular microbial nucleic acids is similar to searching for \"a needle in a haystack\".

In addition, at least two different lineages of PEDV are co-circulating in North American and Asian countries [23, 24] , compromising vaccine-based control strategies. A majority of previous studies focused on PEDV evolution and pathogenicity whereas only two studies investigated the changes detected in the fecal microbiota from pigs with PEDV infection [25, 26] , both of which only focused on the changes of bacterial profiles in pigs infected with PEDV. Utilizing HTS to characterize the virome of diarrheal pigs, four previous studies reported that significantly higher percentages of RNA viral sequences were detected than that of DNA viral sequences [1, [27] [28] [29] . However, the aforementioned studies only utilized limited numbers of diarrheal pigs (\u226450) and the role of PEDV in the sick pigs was not clear.

One strain (ISU20245) is most closely related to a US strain reported in 2011, and three additional strains (ISU20448, ISU25220, and ISU41447) were grouped into to anther genogroup and were most closely related to Chinese and Thai strains implicated in swine diarrhea. b, Aichivirus C (PKV-1) alignment (aa position 1183-1224 of polyprotein with PKV/US/ISU25220/2015 as reference) demonstrating insertions and deletions among different strains samples of diarrheic pigs included Mamastrovirus, Enterovirus, Sapelovirus, Posavirus, Kobuvirus, Sapovirus, Teschovirus, Pasivirus, and Deltacoronavirus in decreasing order of prevalence. Our data indicate the high prevalence (73%) of mixed RNA viral infections in PEDV-infected pigs and the complexity associated with mixed viral RNA infections.",

Such findings are similar to a previous report [27] . This may have been attributed to the well-understood fact that picornaviruses are highly resistant in the environment and as such, usually survive much longer than other viruses [30] . The environmentally resistant picornaviruses can have a longer exposure time in pigs, increasing the odds of infection and their prevalence when compared to other viruses. Furthermore, the viruses also have better odds of detection in the environment after shedding. Both of these factors can increase the detection rate of picornaviruses from clinical samples, as compared to other viruses. Although the longer surviving feature of picornaviruses makes them easier to detect, such nature may bias their proportion in mixed infections.",

The clinical significance of PSV has not been confirmed to date, but this complete US PSV genome sequence can facilitate PSV diagnostics and future molecular epidemiological studies of PSV in US swine. It was also demonstrated in this study that there are at least two genogroups of Aichivirus C (PKV-1) circulating in US swine. Currently, Aichivirus C-specific virological and serological diagnostic assays have not been available in most veterinary diagnostic laboratories. Availability of more Aichivirus C sequences will help understand genetic diversity of this virus and facilitate development of appropriate diagnostic assays. The clinical significance of Aichivirus C also remains to be elucidated.",

Therefore, we chose to use Kraken as our primary analysis program, and Kaiju program as our secondary confirmation method in the current study. It should be noted that a fecal sample negative for PEDV was not used as a negative control, which is one of our study limitations.",
