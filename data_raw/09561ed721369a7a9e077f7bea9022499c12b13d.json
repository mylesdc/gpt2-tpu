For control measures to be more effective, a measure of the heterogeneity of the parameters is desirable. Methods: We propose a novel extension of a network-based approach to estimating the reproductive number. With this we can incorporate spatial and/or demographic information through a similarity matrix. We apply this to the 2009 Influenza pandemic in South Africa to understand the spatial variability across provinces. We explore the use of five similarity matrices to illustrate their impact on the subsequent epidemic parameter estimates.",

When fitting a new model for each province with no inter-province connections this estimate varies little (1.23-1.37). Using the proposed method with any of the four similarity measures yields an overall R 0 that varies little across the four new models (1.33 to 1.34). However, when allowed to vary across provinces, the estimated R 0 is greater than one consistently in only two of the nine provinces, the most densely populated provinces of Gauteng and Western Cape. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the spatial heterogeneity of influenza transmission was compelling in South Africa during the 2009 pandemic. This variability makes a qualitative difference in our understanding of the epidemic. While the cause of this fluctuation might be partially due to reporting differences, there is substantial evidence to warrant further investigation.",

            "text": "In an emerging outbreak of an infectious disease, such as influenza, there is great interest in determining, amongst other things, its transmissibility, which is typically quantified by its reproductive number. Initially, there is interest in estimation of the idealized basic reproductive number, R 0 , which measures the average number of cases generated by an infected individual in an entirely susceptible population. Post hoc analyses of an outbreak may include estimation of the time-varying effective reproductive number, R t , which represents the impact on R 0 of acquired immunity and public health interventions that typically lead to decreased transmission and a decrease in the growth of the outbreak [1] . Several methods exist for estimating these quantities either in real time as the epidemic progresses, or after the epidemic is over [2, 3] . Frequently, these estimators assume a homogenously mixing population, even though often this simplifying assumption may not be realistic. One possible source of heterogeneity is the lack of spatial uniformity in transmission across the population in question. In such an instance, the question arises of how to modify our inference-on the reproductive number, for example-and the impact this might have on our understanding of transmission dynamics.",

There are nine provinces in South Africa that vary substantially in size, population density, climate, and accessibility to healthcare [10]. The symptom onset date was available in 758 cases (6% of the cases). We impute the missing onset dates using a multiple imputation method. To this end we first fit a Poisson model to the lag between onset date and collection date for those who had both dates recorded (715 cases) incorporating statistically significant predictors: (i) the province where the report originated, and (ii) an indicator of weekend versus weekday for the day of collection. The Poisson model was used to randomly generate missing onset times. This process was repeated 500 times creating 500 imputed data sets.

As we are uncertain of which similarity matrix would be most appropriate for influenza in South Africa in 2009, we investigate a variety of matrices in the model and comment on the variability resulting from each similarity matrix. To this end, we investigate five different similarity matrices to describe, what would seem to us to be, plausible transmission patterns between the provinces. The matrices are shown in Tables 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and are,  respectively: a. Diagonal matrix. This model assumes that all transmissions occur within each province and there is no transmission between individuals in different provinces. This is comparable to applying the original WT method to each province separately. b. Travel patterns. Using data on travel patterns reported by the Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism in South Africa [12] we construct a second transmission matrix. This one assumes that transmission probabilities mirror the probability of travel between provinces. c. Increased transmission between those in the same province, i.e. d ij =2 if i and j are in the same province and d ij =1 otherwise. This is an attempt at giving more weight to infection between individuals within a state, but allowing for infection from an individual from another state; a less extreme isolation model than in a., above. Of course, we could entertain values other than 1 and 2 for elements of this matrix. d. Neighboring provinces up-weighted. We define a similarity metric such that if i and j are in the same province the similarity is 2, if they are in neighboring provinces the similarity is 1, otherwise the similarity is 0.5. This model can be thought of as between the model described in a. and the one described in c. e. Higher transmission between densely populated provinces.",

Figure 3 shows the overall estimates of R t when the different transmission matrices are used, as well as when the original WT method (Matrix a, ignoring spatial transmission patterns) is used. We note that there are only very minor differences between the estimates. The only noticeable differences exist during the initial and final phases of the epidemic; however, these differences are minimal. Figure 4 shows the results by province, and again there are only minor differences between the estimates obtained with the five different transmission matrices. Table 6 shows an estimate of R 0 obtained by averaging the R t estimates obtained over the period of exponential growth in the epidemic (days 10 through 70 reported, though other ranges were used with similar results). We note sizable differences in the estimate of R 0 between provinces and the transmission matrices used. The biggest differences are between the original WT method (Matrix a) and the methods using a nonhomogeneous transmission matrix (Matrix b-e). Those using a similarity matrix implying heterogeneity are almost identical to each other, but quite different from the value obtained by the original WT method that assumes homogeneity. We note that when nonhomogeneous transmission is assumed, R 0 is only above 1 for Gauteng and the Western Cape, where Johannesburg and Cape Town are located. One possible explanation is that a certain population density or degree of travel in/out of an area is required to sustain a local epidemic of the flu. The sensitivity analysis yielded results that are consistent with these findings (Table 1) . We further explore this result in Figure 5 , where the estimates of R 0 are plotted against the population size, land area and population density with the least squares regression estimates shown. The estimate of R 0 increases with an increase in population size and density (p=0.0004 for matrix b; p=0.04 for matrix c) and decreases with land area. The proportion infected in each province also appears to be related to the population size in the province, though this is not significant (p=0.16). When the WT estimator is used, the model that ignores geography, these relationships disappear (p=0.53 for population density; similar results hold for the other plots), as one might expect.",

The impact of adjusting the assumption of homogeneous mixing in this South African outbreak, is that apart from the densely populated, urban areas, the pandemic would likely not have been sustained just in the rural, sparsely populated provinces. This finding reinforces the obvious: if individuals have very limited contact with each other, then the outbreaks would probably be small in numbers, limited to small groups, and would likely not propagate to become a larger and more noticeable outbreak. Our estimates of the reproductive number for the more populous provinces are consistent with results reported elsewhere, but the results we obtain for more rural provinces are notably lower [5, 13, 14] .",

Throughout we have assumed that the reporting of cases is uniform throughout the country, and this was the basis for our sizable imputation of the number of symptom onset dates. Even if this reporting is less than 100%, but still spatially uniform, the results we observe will hold [15] . However, if reporting is not uniform between provinces and some provinces have much better reporting of cases than others, we can expect the results to change. For instance, if reporting was lower in the more rural provinces, then it is likely that the estimated reproductive numbers would increase in these provinces if some adjustment for this underreporting were made. Without a more detailed study, this is difficult to quantify and explain. Clearly, there is a certain amount of confounding present, Estimates of R t using the transmission matrices, as described in the text. The estimates shown represent the average of the R t estimates obtained across the 500 imputed epidemics. Days when no cases were reported have a R t of 0, though we smooth through this for the purpose of visual presentation. and data reporting issues can be part of an explanation for the results we obtain.",

We show results for various transmission matrices in order to quantify the degree to which transmission occurs between provinces. Four of these matrices are somewhat arbitrary and not based on actual data. One matrix is based on actual travel patterns in South Africa. But the results are reasonably consistent for the four matrices that assume some degree of transmission between provinces, even when the amount is very small, as in the travel-based matrix. This argues that the results are influenced more by the fact that such a matrix is used and less by the form that such a matrix takes. In all of these cases, despite the substantial differences in the matrices, the result is the same: transmission is maintained in more urban areas and rural areas fail to sustain transmission.",

This reflects the impact of using such matrices and the importance of performing sensitivity analyses to determine the impact of the matrix on the results. Possibly why such matrices have not been used in the past, even though they have a qualitative impact on the results, is that these matrices are difficult to come by, and in practice, they are likely to be estimated in a somewhat ad hoc manner. In some cases, there may be little or no data to inform a transmission matrix. In this case, a wide variety of matrices can be used to determine the plausible range of values that the estimates can assume. Ultimately deriving a method for estimating these matrices, ideally using Bayesian tools, would mitigate this challenge. The framework we provide here lends itself to such an approach, although we have not carried out such an analysis.",
