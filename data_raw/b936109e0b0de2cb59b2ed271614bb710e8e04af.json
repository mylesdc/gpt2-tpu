Although febrile illness is more common in influenza A infections than influenza B infections, many influenza A infections are afebrile. Our findings therefore suggest that ITIS is unlikely to be effective for entry screening of travellers to detect influenza infection with the intention of preventing entry of the virus into a country.",

ITIS measure body surface temperature, not body core temperature, and so ITIS temperature measurements are subject to the influence of a range of human and environmental factors. These include whether a person is sunburnt, has taken antipyretics or has circulatory problems, and also the ambient temperature and humidity. Consequently it is important that the relationship between body surface temperature and body core temperature be evaluated within the environment in which ITIS are to be operated.",

Therefore, the prevalence of fever (by each definition) in the holders of marked questionnaires was combined with the sensitivity and specificity of ITIS for detecting fever to estimate the PPV in the population of all travellers who arrived on the flights that took part in the study.

These results emphasise what is already known about fever as a symptom of influenza -while it clearly is one of the symptoms that can be experienced by people with influenza infection, it does not occur in all infected people [20] . The prevalence of fever is high in case series of patients with confirmed influenza infection [11, 21] , since often one of the criteria that is often used to determine whether testing takes place is the presence of fever. However, where fever is not used as a criterion for influenza testing, the prevalence of fever is by no means 100%, even among people with severe symptoms. For example, among 106 patients hospitalised with respiratory disease [22] , 39% of those with confirmed pandemic (H1N1) 2009 infection did not have a temperature of $37.8uC at any time during admission. In this study, the predominance of Influenza B infection may partly explain the low prevalence of fever among infected participants (although the three with Influenza A all had tympanic temperatures ,37.2uC ).Even with more pyrexigenic strains, among travellers, who by definition are not severely unwell and in fact who are mostly not unwell at all, the proportion of influenza infected people who are afebrile can be expected to be much higher than among hospitalised patients [22] (because the sicker infected people don't travel), as shown in this study.",

In addition, our participants sat still at approximately 1m from the scanner for the ITIS measure and those who were wearing glasses were asked to remove them, steps likely to have provided greater accuracy than ITIS measures that are taken as numerous people walk past a fixed scanner in an arrivals hall.

In addition, it is possible that unwell infected travellers had used anti-pyretics prior to or during the flight, but this is a limitation of ITIS rather than of our study. The study assessed the performance of ITIS in the real world, which includes the fact that some unwell people take antipyretics. Also, the flights that were part of this study were relatively short -3 to 4 hours -and it is possible that on longer flights some of the infected travellers might have become febrile.

Although the approximately one third of participants whose symptoms were of 2 days' duration or less were likely to be in the early stages of their infection, those with longer duration of symptoms may not have been. Unfortunately the symptoms of influenza are so non-specific that it is difficult to estimate the stage of influenza infection in a traveller with, for example, a cough that has been present for several weeks.

It is not known whether the latter group are infectious, but clearly only the first two categories could potentially be detected by entry screening. Most people who were infected but asymptomatic on boarding will still be asymptomatic on arrival at their destination [23] . However, in the absence of effective exit screening during the H1N1 2009 pandemic, some countries decided to use ITIS in entry screening with the hope that detecting travellers who were febrile on arrival would be worthwhile to reduce the probability of infected travellers entering the country, and that ITIS could detect them [1] . This study provides evidence to the contrary. The low PPV of ITIS measures for fever in this population means that the number of false positives who would require further investigation, presumably by taking a tympanic temperature, would be very high. In this study, using a front of face ITIS threshold of 35.4uC identifies 69% of travellers as requiring further investigation, of whom only 4.1% had a tympanic temperature $37.5uC. The PPV of any of the measures of temperature for influenza infection itself was lower, at less than 3%. However, the prevalence of disease is an important determinant of PPV, and the prevalence of influenza infection in this study, performed during the 'influenza season', was low at 1.9%. There are no other published estimates of the prevalence of influenza in arriving travellers, but it could be argued that the prevalence of infection would be higher during a pandemic, which typically infects a higher proportion of the population than seasonal influenza, than in this study. On the other hand, particularly if local containment strategies were in place in originating countries, the prevalence of infection in travellers might be lower during a pandemic. At the beginning of a pandemic, when effective entry screening would be most useful, the prevalence of infection among travellers and therefore the PPV will likely be much lower than the prevalence of seasonal influenza in this study.",
