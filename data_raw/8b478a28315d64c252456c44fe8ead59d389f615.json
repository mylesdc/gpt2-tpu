So far, no approved vaccines and specific treatment options against LASV exist. To develop specific fusion inhibitors against LASV, we solved the crystal structure of the post-fusion 6 helix bundle (6-HB) formed by two heptad repeat domains (HR1 and HR2) of GP2. This fusion core contains a parallel trimeric coiled-coil of three HR1 helices, around which three HR2 helices are entwined in an antiparallel manner. Various hydrophobic and charged interactions form between HR1 and HR2 domains to stabilize the overall conformation of GP2 fusion core. Based on the structure, we designed several peptides spanning the HR2 domain and tested their antiviral activities. We found that the longer HR2 peptides were effective in inhibiting LASV GPC protein-mediated cell-cell fusion under low pH condition. These results not only suggest that LASV infects the target cell mainly through endocytosis, including micropinocytosis, and membrane fusion at low pH, but also provide an important basis for rational design of LASV fusion inhibitors.",

Its case-fatality rate is 1% for overall infection and 15\u223c20% for severe cases among patients hospitalized. This mortality rate will increase sharply during epidemics or in pregnant women (Asogun et al., 2012) . The etiologic agent of Lassa fever is Lassa virus (LASV), belonging to the arenavirus family. Arenavirus has more than 30 members divided into two groups: the New World viruses (or Tacaribe complex) and the Old World viruses (or LCM-Lassa complex). The New World family mainly contains Venezuelan hemorrhagic fever (VHF), Jun\u00edn virus (JUNV), Machupo virus (MACV), and Bolivian hemorrhagic fever (BHF), while the Old World viruses includes, for example Lujo virus (LUJV), Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), Morogoro virus (MORV), and LASV. These arenaviruses have both geographical and genetic differences.",

The two RNA segments in its genome encode four viral proteins, including zinc-binding protein (Z), RNA polymerase (L), nucleoprotein (NP), and the surface glycoprotein precursor (GP, or spike protein). GP is cleaved into envelope glycoproteins GP1 and GP2 (Cao et al., 1998) . GP1 that is responsible for receptor binding (including \u03b1-dystroglycan, heparin sulfate, DC-SIGN, etc.) and GP2 that mediates membrane fusion interact with each other to form a stable trimer complex on the LASV viral envelope (Li et al., 2016; Hastie et al., 2017) . Upon receptor binding, LASV enters the target cell via clathrin-and dynaminindependent endocytosis with subsequent transport to late endosomal compartments, where fusion occurs at low pH (Vela et al., 2007; Rojek et al., 2008) . A recent study has also found that after GP1 binds to cell receptor \u03b1-dystroglycan, LASV enters into the target cell through the unusual micropinocytosis pathway and membrane fusion under low pH condition (Oppliger et al., 2016) .",

Given that the first peptide-based antiviral drug enfuvirtide (T20) inhibits human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) fusion with and entry into the target cell by targeting the heptad repeat domain in the viral envelope glycoprotein gp41 (Qi et al., 2017; Su et al., 2017) , the heptad repeat domain in GP2 of LASV may also serve as a target for the design of LASV fusion inhibitors. We have previously demonstrated that the N-terminal heptad repeat 1 (HR1) domain binds to C-terminal heptad repeat 2 (HR2) domain to form a stable six-helix bundle (6-HB) to mediate viral entry; therefore, peptides derived from HR2 should specifically bind to the homotrimeric HR1, interfering with the formation of 6-HB and, hence, blocking viral entry (Zhu et al., 2015 (Zhu et al., , 2016 Xia et al., 2019) . Therefore, it is essential to determine the 6-HB core structure and characterize the interaction sites in the HR1 and HR2 domains, in order to design the HR2-derived peptides against LASV infection. Here, we solved the crystal structure of the post-fusion 6-HB formed by LASV HR1 and HR2 domains. Based on the structure, we designed several peptides spanning the HR2 domain and tested their antiviral activities. Concurrent with the preparation of the present manuscript, another group reported a post-fusion structure of LASV using the insect baculovirus expression system (Shulman et al., 2019) , which allows us to compare the structural differences of 6-HB cores formed by the HR1 and HR2 domains in their truncated version of LASV GP2 spanning residues 306-421 with those in our LASV HR1-T-loop-HR2 construct. These comparisons provide more comprehensive knowledge for better understanding the entry mechanism of LASV and designing of peptide-based LASV fusion inhibitors.",

The working principle of this method is that the molecules are immobilized on the surface of the sensor to form a biolayer, thereby causing interference against light waves passing through the sensor, which was then detected in the form of phase displacement, so that any change in the number of molecules on the surface of the sensor can be detected. Based on this principle, the mobile phase cannot have a non-specific combination with the sensor. The sensor type selected in this experiment was Super Streptavidin (SSA) Biosensor, and all the tests were performed using Octet RED96. The biotinylation of protein for immobilization onto SSA was carried out according to the following procedure. The activated biotin reagent was prepared in DMSO at a concentration of 5 mg/mL. The peptides were mixed with biotin reagent, and the molar ratio of peptide to biotin reagent was 2:1. The reactions were incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Then free biotin was removed by dialysis. Biotinylation of protein for immobilization onto SSA was at a concentration of 80 \u00b5g/mL. The loading time was 300 s. The concentration of mobile phase in the initial test was 50 \u00b5M. The concentration gradient in the further test was 30, 15, 7.5, and 3.75 \u00b5M.

Taking a rod-like shape with a length of \u223c75 \u00c5 and a diameter of \u223c40 \u00c5, the LASV fusion core contains a parallel trimeric coiled-coil of three HR1 helices (gray in Figure 2A) , around which three HR2 helices are entwined (green in Figure 2A ) in an antiparallel manner. Between these two domains, the T-loop forms a 3 10 helix linker hovering outside (cyan in Figure 2A) . According to the structure shown in electrostatic potential surface (Figure 2B) , the HR2 region of LASV can be divided into Frontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org two parts: a linear N-terminal region and a helical C-terminal region. The linear N-terminal region binds to two adjacent HR1 helices through hydrophobic interactions, consistent with other fusion core structures, as previously determined (Lu et al., 2014) . Some obvious charged interactions take place between the helical C-terminal region of HR2 and HR1 trimer core, and these will be discussed later. Another group deposited a postfusion structure of LASV in PDB (entry code 5OMI), using a baculovirus expression system, instead of our renaturation method. Compared with this structure, the HR2 helical region in our structure exhibited a significant shift of 4.9\u223c5.6 \u00c5 toward the hydrophobic grooves of two adjacent HR1 helices, showing much stronger hydrophobic interaction (Figures 2C,E) .",

The T-loop region of LCMV fusion core moves closer to the HR2 region, and its HR2 helical region slopes away from HR2 of LASV. When further comparing the 6-HB structures of LCMV and LASV with those of other viruses, we found several unique features for arenavirus GP2 protein ( Figure 2F) . The HR1 and HR2 regions of HIV form a short regular \u03b1-helix structure, while coronaviruses, like MERS-CoV and MHV, have a short helical HR2 region, but longer helical HR1 region.

We found that the longer HR2 peptides, , and HR2-3 (25-mer: 397-421), had higher binding affinity with HR1 peptide than the shorter HR2 peptides, , possibly owing to their rich hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions (Figure 4) . Moreover, the longer peptides of HR2-1 (48-mer: 385-432) and HR2-2 exhibited more obvious inhibitory activities against LASV G protein-mediated cell-cell fusion. These results suggest that the longer HR2-derived peptides, which have stronger affinity against the HR1 domain, also have more potent inhibitory activity. On the contrary, the shorter HR2 peptides, HR2-4 and HR2-5, do not interact with HR1 peptide, thus showing no cell-cell fusion inhibitory activity. In the cell-cell fusion process, the GP1 protein of LASV binds to its target receptor to expose the GP2 subunit. Then, the HR2 domain binds to the HR1 domain to form the 6-HB fusion core to mediate the formation of membrane fusion pores. At this time, the HR1 domain becomes a very exposed target for binding and blocking by an HR2-derived peptide. Therefore, the binding affinity of HR2 peptides is positively related to the inhibitory activity against LASV GPC proteinmediated cell-cell fusion under low pH condition.",

            "text": "However, all these HR2-derived peptides showed weak or no inhibitory activity against LASV pseudovirus entry into the target cell. It confirms that the HR2-peptides do not interact with the GP1 protein to block its interaction with the receptor on the target cell, the first step of viral entry. These findings also suggest that LASV enters the target cell using the fusion pathway different from that utilized by some other class I enveloped viruses, such as HIV and MERS-CoV (Qi et al., 2017; Su et al., 2017; Xia et al., 2019) , which get into the host cells via cytoplasm membrane fusion under neutral pH condition. Several groups have shown that LASV enters the host cell via clathrin-and dynamin-independent endocytosis and membrane fusion occurs at low pH (Vela et al., 2007; Rojek et al., 2008) . Oppliger and coworkers (Oppliger et al., 2016) have recently reported that LASV enters the target cell through macropinocytosis. Since our results are consistent with those in the reports above, we proposed an infection model of LASV (Figure 6) . Specifically, LASV enters the target cells via endocytosis, including macropinocytosis. In the membrane fusion process as revealed by the cell-cell fusion assay, the GP1 trimer of LASV binds to its receptor(s), e.g., \u03b1-Dystroglycan, to trigger the conformational change of GP2. Then HR1 is exposed to bind with HR2 to form 6-HB, resulting in the fusion between viral envelope and endosomal membrane. Under these conditions, HR2-derived peptides could bind to the HR1 target to block viral infection. However, during the entry process of live and pseudotyped LASV, the HR1 domain of viral GP2 can only be exposed in the endosomal compartment and interacts with the HR2 domain of viral GP2 to mediate membrane fusion under low pH condition, making it impossible for HR2 peptides to enter the endosomal compartment to block membrane fusion there (Figure 6) . Therefore, HR2 peptides must be modified, for example, by adding TAT cell penetration sequence (Miller et al., 2011) or hydrocarbon stapling motif , so that they can enter into the endosomal compartment inside the cell to interact with HR1 domain of the viral GP1 domain and inhibit the membrane fusion at low pH there.",

HR2-peptides or their analogs, if they can enter the endosomal compartment inside the host cell, can interact with the HR1 domain in viral GP2 and block the 6-HB formation, thereby inhibiting membrane fusion at low pH.

Although these residues are not involved in the NHR-CHR interactions in the crystal structure, they may help stabilize the overall structure of the entire HR2 peptide. Thus, compared with the HR2-3 peptide, the more stable HR2-2 peptide has higher affinity in binding HR1-1 peptide (Figure 4) , as well as higher inhibitory activity in cell-cell fusion ( Figure 5B) . Therefore, the HR2-2 peptide will be modified for further development as an anti-LASV drug candidate.",
