Most of these approaches employ culture systems that allow stem cell-derived or tissue progenitor cells to self-organize into three-dimensional (3D)-structures. Since organoids can be grown from different species (human, mouse, cat, dog), organs (intestine, kidney, brain, liver), and from patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells, they create significant prospects for modelling development and diseases, for toxicology and drug discovery studies, and in the field of regenerative medicine. Here, we report on intestinal stem cells, organoid culture, organoid disease modeling, transplantation, specifically covering the current and future uses of this exciting new insight model to the field of veterinary medicine.",

Upon sensing neuroendocrine signals, enteroendocrine cells produce various hormones to control digestive enzyme secretion, metabolism, and bowel movements.

CBC cells are the proliferative engines that drive cellular production in the crypts: they divide daily, with frequent turnover. +4 cells have been redefined as reserve or quiescent ISCs (qISCs): they divide infrequently under homeostatic conditions but can be induced to produce new CBC cells in response to injury or other stimuli [11] .",

Investigation of its expression pattern in normal intestine revealed it to be a highly specific marker for the proliferating CBC cells [14] . The consideration that Lgr5 is a robust marker of intestinal stem cells was further substantiated by ex vivo culture assays, where single Lgr5 + cells were shown to form self-renewing epithelial organoids exhibiting a structure and composition highly reminiscent of crypt/villus epithelial units in vivo [6] . Importantly, cells that expressed low or no Lgr5 were incapable of forming these organoids. Taken together, these studies provide compelling evidence for Lgr5 being a marker of proliferating adult stem cells residing at the crypt base throughout the intestinal tract [13] . Bmi1 (B lymphoma Mo-MLV insertion region 1 homolog) is a member of the Polycomb group of transcriptional repressors, the function of which in the intestine is unknown. Bmi1 is an essential regulator of hematopoietic, neural, and lung epithelial stem cells. In the intestine, Bmi1 was initially detected in label-retaining stem cells located at the +4 position from the bottom of the crypt. This label retaining feature might indicate a quiescent nature or the capacity to asymmetrically segregate DNA strands. However, it was demonstrated that Bmi1 expression is unrestricted throughout the crypt compartment, similar to that of other proposed stem cell markers, such as Hopx (Homeodomain-only protein) and Tert (Telomerase reverse transcriptase). Furthermore, Bmi1 is a downstream effector of Notch in the ISC and progenitor compartment and Bmi1 is involved in ISC self-renewal [14] .",

Consistent with this hypothesis, loss of telomerase has been shown to result in intestinal villus atrophy, suggesting a functional requirement for telomerase activity and/or telomere maintenance in ISC function. mTert expression marks a slowly cycling ISC population distinct from Lgr5+ cells. mTert+ cells contribute to all differentiated intestinal cell types as well as the Lgr5+ cell population, persist long-term, are resistant to injury, and contribute to the regenerative response following tissue injury.

More specifically, Wnt3 signaling, provided by flanking Paneth cells, is necessary for the maintenance and function of CBC stem cells. In the absence of Wnt3, Wnt2b can compensate.

R-spondins are incorporated into a complex that contains Lrp (low-density lipoprotein receptor related proteins), Lgr, and Fzd (Frizzled); this complex facilitates Fzd-coupled Wnt/b-catenin signaling [22] . Of the ten mammalian Fzds, only Fzd7 is frequently upregulated in stem cell populations and cancers from diverse tissues [23] . Notably, FZD7 plays a non-redundant role in maintaining pluripotency of human embryonic stem cells [24] and might play a similar role in the intestinal stem cells.

For colon crypt culture, Wnt ligand is an additional factor required to maintain Lgr5-CBC cells, because the epithelium makes little, if any, Wnt [9] . It has been suggested that some of these growth factors in small intestine are derived from the neighboring Paneth cells in vivo, while other cues are likely provided by intestinal subepithelial myofibroblasts (ISEMFs). Paneth cells are tightly nested between ISCs in the crypt base; they act as anti-microbial defensive cells, while also producing supportive growth factors for neighboring ISCs. It has been reported that Paneth cell-derived Wnt3 is necessary for in vitro intestinal epithelial cultures. However, ISC niche maintenance in vivo is preserved even with conditional epithelial Wnt3 deletion and Paneth cell ablation. This suggests the presence of redundant sources of Wnt signaling from surrounding non-epithelial cells within the niche [32] .",

The authors recapitulated in vivo human stomach development by inducing first the PSCs to form definitive endoderm spheroids, which were subsequently stimulated by retinoic acid to generate the foregut. To permit 3D growth and further differentiation, spheroids were transferred into a retinoic acid-supplemented Matrigel culture, leading to the formation of domains with gastric mucous and endocrine cells, and LGR5-expressing SCs. Notably, to study the etiology of Helicobacter pylori-mediated disease, they injected the bacterium directly into the lumen of the organoids, and observed that the virulence factor CagA bound and activated the c-Met (receptor for HGF), inducing epithelial proliferation. This epithelial pathophysiological response makes the organoids a promising model for human gastric disease [48] .",
