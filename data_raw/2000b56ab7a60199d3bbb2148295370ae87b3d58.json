Figure S1 shows the histogram of the time between onset of symptoms and death for all cases (number of observations n=44) for which this information is available. Note that Figure S1 bears a close resemblance to Supplementary Information Figure 1 of [1] , for the 1918 H1N1 pandemic influenza (n=94). Also, for these cases, which correspond to hospitalizations in most cases, the mode of the time between onset of symptoms and death is about 9 days.",

It may also be a good approximation at the ending stages of an epidemic where R 0 S(t)/N < 1, even if R 0 > 1. On the other hand accounting for possible overdispersion may prove crucial in the beginning stages of an epidemic process, and assumes particular importance the larger R > 1. These considerations apply e.g. to measles outbreaks, which are characterized by R 0 > 10 [5, 6, 7] . They may also apply to seasonal influenza under special circumstances, for which R is large [8] . For completeness we give in Table S2 estimates for R and its 95% credible intervals obtained using a negative binomial distribution with \u03c9 = \u0394T (t) for Vietnam. As can be observed estimates of R obtained via the Poisson and negative binomial distributions are mutually consistent, with slightly wider confidence bounds obtained for the latter, as expected from its overdispersed character.

Figure S5 : Evolution of R estimates over time (weeks) for the 1918 H1N1 influenza epidemic in four selected cities in the USA: New York, Los Angeles, Pittsburgh and Atlanta (left to right, top to bottom). The decay of R over time is due to the depletion of susceptibles. Data is for excess mortality, from Ref. [1] . Estimates are for an infectious period \u03b3 \u22121 = 2.6 days. Figure S6 : The same as Fig. S5 for an infectious period \u03b3 \u22121 = 4.1 days. Note that the evolution is identical in the two cases but that the estimate of the magnitude of R differs somewhat, with the longer infectious periods yielding larger R, see text. Observed new cases Expected 95% Interval R 0 =1.1 R 0 =1.3 R 0 =1.5 Figure S7 : Prediction for new cases of avian influenza (simulated data R 0 = 0.8, with infections from reservoir taken from Vietnam time series, Fig. 1a of main text) vs. realized new cases (blue dots). Numbers of new cases that fall outside expected credible bounds indicate shifts in R, here from R 0 = 0.8 to R 0 = 1.1, 1.3 and 1.5 (green, purple and black dots), at week 75 and beyond. Although even shifts in R 0 to values just above 1 produce clear anomalies, larger values of R 0 lead to larger case numbers further away from the upper credible bound. The detection of such statistical anomalies can be used to trigger surveillance investigations and/or intervention measures. Anomaly detection can also flag potential surveillance errors, incorporating new cases into the iterative estimation procedure if they fall within bounds and rejecting them otherwise, as shown here during weeks 75-80. As shown here, persistent anomalies signal very likely changes in epidemiological conditions.",
