We aimed to understand the impact of interactions between the nasal microbiome and host transcriptome on the severity and clinical outcomes of RSV infection. We used 16 S rRNA sequencing to characterize the nasal microbiome of infants with RSV infection. We used RNA sequencing to interrogate the transcriptome of CD4 + t cells obtained from the same set of infants. After dimension reduction through principal component (pc) analysis, we performed an integrative analysis to identify significant co-variation between microbial clade and gene expression pcs. We then employed LioneSS (Linear interpolation to obtain network estimates for Single Samples) to estimate the clade-gene association patterns for each infant. our network-based integrative analysis identified several clade-gene associations significantly related to the severity of RSV infection. the microbial taxa with the highest loadings in the implicated clade pcs included Moraxella, Corynebacterium, Streptococcus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus. interestingly, many of the genes with the highest loadings in the implicated gene pcs are encoded in mitochondrial DnA, while others are involved in the host immune response. this study on microbiometranscriptome interactions provides insights into how the host immune system mounts a response against RSV and specific infectious agents in nasal microbiota.",

Almost all children will have been infected with RSV by age two, with about 3% requiring hospitalization. A recent report estimated that in 2015 about 33.1 million children worldwide under age 5 had RSV-related acute lower respiratory infection; of those, approximately 10% required hospitalization with 59,000 in-hospital fatalities 1 . The incidence and mortality of RSV vary between geographic locations, with children from developing countries considered to be at higher risk 4 . In the United States, 20% of infants require outpatient treatment for RSV-related illnesses, with an associated economic burden of $1.9 billion 5 ; around 3% of these cases are associated with serious bronchiolitis and viral pneumonia-the most common forms of severe RSV infection.",

The RSV disease severity was measured by the Global Respiratory Severity Score (GRSS). This allowed us to divide infants into two groups based on severity: mild and severe (see Methods section). We emphasize that GRSS is a composite score that reflects the worst values during the entire illness, rather than a single time point, allowing us to address the problem of clinical variability among subjects. GRSS also recapitulates more frequently used factors such as viral load (which has been associated with RSV disease severity in several studies 24, 25 ) and need for hospitalization (Supplemental Fig. 1 ), thus acting as excellent surrogate for disease severity 26 . Among the infants, 23 had mild illness and 35 had severe illness. There was no difference in any demographic characteristics between mildly and severely ill subjects ( Table 1) .

We also assessed the influence of visit and infection severity on the microbiome composition by using two measures to quantify the \u03b1-diversity: (1) observed number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs), i.e., the OTU richness and (2) the Shannon index 46 . We found that both \u03b1-diversity measures have higher values for infants with severe infection compared to those with mild infection during the acute visit (Visit 1), as well as higher values in the acute as compared to the post-acute visit (Visit 3) for infants with severe infection (Fig. 2F ,G). In particular, the Shannon diversity is significantly different between severe versus mild samples in Visit 1 (p-value = 0.011), and between the Visit 1 and Visit 3 samples among infants with severe RSV infection (p-value = 0.0057).

Although it has been suggested that host gene expression is influenced by the microbiome, the biological mechanisms that may facilitate these types of interactions are largely unknown 47 . Integrative analysis of microbiome and transcriptome data could help us understand the relationships between host gene expression, microbial composition, and disease pathogenesis. Therefore, we applied a network-based approach, which systematically evaluates the interdependence of multiple biological entities instead of looking at each one independently, to identify microbiome-transcriptomic relationships important for RSV severity.",

Moreover, using MaAsLin and at a nominal p-value of 0.05, we identified one OTU (H. influenza) that is positively associated with RSV severity, and two OTUs (Ralstonia and Streptococcus) that are negatively associated with RSV severity. These results are partially consistent with previous observations that infants within H. influenzae-enriched clusters mount a distinct host inflammatory response characterized by the overexpression of genes related to toll-like receptor signaling and neutrophil recruitment and activation 22 . Interestingly, our subsequent network analysis implicated many of the same OTUs as MaAsLin did. Top OTUs in the network-identified clade PCs included Streptococcus, Corynebacterium, Alloiococcus, H. influenzae, Staphylococcus, Moraxella, Ralstonia, and Pseudomonas. These are consistent with a similar study analyzing the microbiome from nasopharyngeal bacterial swabs alongside whole blood transcriptomic data collected from RSV infected infants 22 . In addition, among these identified OTUs, incidence of co-infection of Streptococcus, Haemophilus influenza, and Moraxella with RSV has been reported in studies of nasopharyngeal aspirate samples from RSV infected infants [53] [54] [55] . During acute respiratory illness most infants show stable colonization of these microbes with Alloiococcus or Moraxella 21 . Our transcriptome analysis found that genes involved in immune response, such as IFITM1 and IFITM2, decreased in expression after the acute visit, while EZH1, which has also been implicated in immune response signaling 27 , was expressed at lower levels in infants with severe RSV infection. Interferons are widely expressed and are among the key genes responsible for mediating immune response 27, 56 . In particular, the IFN-inducible protein is localized in the cell membrane and endocytic vesicle and is important in restricting viral entry to the cell 57-59 . In 27 , IFITM genes have been shown to potentially inhibit RSV infection by interfering with virus entry and subsequent viral multiplication. Despite these promising findings, we note that standard differential expression only identified one gene as significantly (FDR < 0.05) differentially expressed based on RSV infection severity -EZH1 with an FDR of 0.026.",

Hence most of the statistical analysis with interesting results, although nominally significant, did not show significance after adjusted for multiple hypothesis testing. Second, there may have been other host factors such as maternal or household smoking history, breast-feeding status, number of siblings, and antibiotic use, that could affect the severity of RSV infection but were not considered in our study. Third, this study was only able to provide associations between genes and microbiota without exploring the potential causal relationship.",

We also used a network-based approach to integrate these two data types and identify higher-order associations among genes and clades. This integrative analysis allowed us to systematically quantify relationships among the nasal microbiome, host transcriptome, and disease severity for RSV infection. Our results suggest that certain associations between the microbiome and transcriptome are modulated based on RSV infection severity, and that particular microbial taxa impact host immune response, with a key role for mitochondrial genes. Overall, these findings on microbiome-transcriptome associations provides novel insights into how the immune system mounts a response against RSV. Based on our findings, a key future direction for our group is to study the potential mechanisms by which the nasal microbiome impacts host immune response, such as how gene regulation is altered or otherwise affected by microbial composition, or how nasal bacteria influence the severity of RSV from a pathophysiologic perspective.",

RSV disease severity was measured using the Global Respiratory Severity Score (GRSS) on a scale from 0-10, with higher scores representing more severe infection 67 . The GRSS was developed using an unbiased data-driven approach with nine clinical variables (including the infant's general appearance, the presence of wheezing, rales, retractions, cyanosis, lethargy, and poor air movement). The maximal age-adjusted respiratory rate, as well as the worst room air oxygen saturation, are also included in the score. The GRSS is highly predictive of other potential parameters of severity, such as need for hospitalization and duration of hospitalization 67 . The GRSS has an excellent ability to discriminate between mild and severe disease with AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) ~0.961. An infant with a GRSS \u2264 3.5 (or > 3.5) is classified as having mild (or severe) infection, respectively. For more information see 67 . We note that using continuous or discrete severity scores in our analyses resulted in similar results, so for simplicity we treated RSV infection severity as a binary variable.",
