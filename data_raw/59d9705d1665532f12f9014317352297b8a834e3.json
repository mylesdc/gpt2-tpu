The care of children with chronic and complex medical disorders is costly, but little is known about the added costs of ARI in this population. 8 Therefore, the aim of this cost of illness study was to calculate the attributable cost of ARI in pLTCFs during the respiratory viral season as compared to the remainder of the year.",

These items included gloves, gowns, masks, hand sanitizer, and bleach wipes. The cost of diagnostic testing was provided by the laboratories contracted by the pLTCF. The vendors and item costs did not change during the study period. The costs of antibiotics and oseltamivir were calculated based on the lowest and most conservative estimate of the average wholesale price listed in the 2010 Red Book Drug Reference. 10 Antibiotic and oseltamivir prices were standardized and inflation adjusted to 2013 using the Consumer Price Index (http://www.bls.gov/data/infla-tion_calculator.htm). A pediatric infectious disease consultant is employed by the pLTCF on an hourly basis to assist with the management of healthcare-associated infections.

            "text": "In this study, the costs of the infection prevention and control measures expended were ten times greater during the respiratory viral season than during the non-respiratory viral season. The vast majority of the cost burden, nearly 98%, was due to influenza prophylaxis. Our facility prophylactically treats all residents with oseltamivir at the onset of any confirmed case of influenza. During our study period, there were only three cases of influenza. However, this translated into all 137 residents receiving prophylaxis three times, thus resulting in high costs. The added costs of the other infection prevention and control activities we measured including diagnostic testing, physician consulting, and product usage, $644 per 1000 resident-days, were similar to that reported in the pediatric acute care setting during RSV seasons ($760 per 1000 patient-days). 6 Surprisingly, the costs related to hand hygiene were greater during the non-respiratory viral season as compared to the viral respiratory season. This may be due to an increase in gastrointestinal disease during the summer months (data not shown). While the cost effectiveness of oseltamivir has not been specifically evaluated in pLTCF, studies in the adult long-term care setting have demonstrated that influenza prophylaxis results in cost savings to facilities overall. 12 There are a few limitations to this study. Only direct costs were calculated, although the pLTCF suffers other losses not taken into account in this analysis. During outbreaks of ARI, for example, the facility's school is closed to prevent the transmission of infection. This results not only in a financial loss of state funding for days of closure, but also a psychosocial cost for the residents. Additional costs not accounted for include staff absenteeism and overtime, as well as psychosocial costs for the roommates of residents who have an ARI, as all residents within the affected room would be on contact/droplet isolation precautions. Costs of hospitalizations were also not included, as this study examined the costs for the facility only. Transfers to acute care would further increase the costs associated with ARI. For this analysis, the study period was limited to one year, which may not be fully representative of other years or sites.",

Notably, the vast majority of the cost burden, $27 338 for facility-wide influenza prophylaxis, can be avoided if no cases of influenza are introduced into the facility. Thus, further research should investigate ways to limit ARI transmission, specifically influenza, in this unique population and setting through measures such as improved hand hygiene and environmental cleaning, increased vaccination rates for facility staff and visitors, and use of masks during peak respiratory illness seasons.",
