Existing therapies have managed to limit mortality and control viral proliferation, but are associated with side effects, do not cure the disease and are subject to development of resistance. Finding new therapeutic targets and drugs is therefore crucial. We have previously shown that the dendritic cell immunoreceptor (DCIR), a C-type lectin receptor expressed on dendritic cells (DCs), acts as an attachment factor for HIV-1 to DCs and contributes to HIV-1 transmission to CD4 + T lymphocytes (CD4TL). Directly involved in HIV-1 infection, DCIR is expressed in apoptotic or infected CD4TL and promotes trans-infection to bystander cells. Here we report the 3D modelling of the extracellular domain of DCIR. Based on this structure, two surface accessible pockets containing the carbohydrate recognition domain and the EPS binding motif, respectively, were targeted for screening of chemicals that will disrupt normal interaction with HIV-1 particle. Preliminary screening using Raji-CD4-DCIR cells allowed identification of two inhibitors that decreased HIV-1 attachment and propagation. The impact of these inhibitors on infection of DCs and CD4TL was evaluated as well. The results of this study thus identify novel molecules capable of blocking HIV-1 transmission by DCs and CD4TL.",

The drugs currently available or in development for treating HIV-1 infection target the virus itself and its replication mechanisms and thus risk selecting resistant variants. Although these treatments increase the lifespan of patients, they also contribute to increased co-morbidity [1] . Studies of a simian model and more recently of human HIV-1 show that treatment during the acute phase of infection improves the immune response to the virus [2, 3] . It has been demonstrated that early events in HIV-1 infection are highly determinant in the irreversible damage inflicted to key immune cells [3, 4, 5, 6, 7] . To maintain vital immune competency, it is crucial to find new targets involved in the first steps of viral transmission and prevent the devastating initial damage to the immune system.",

            "text": "The first immune cells to establish contact with invading HIV-1 are dendritic cells (DCs), which then communicate with cells of both the innate and adaptive immune systems [8, 9] . DCs are intricately involved in the initial response to HIV-1- [9, 10, 11] . During primary infection, HIV-1 in mucosal tissue is first internalized by DCs, which then migrate to secondary lymphoid organs, where the virus is transferred to CD4+ T lymphocytes (CD4TL). Translocation of internalized virus appears to occur via a cell-to-cell junction (the so-called virological synapse) created by simple physical contact between DC and CD4TL [12] , leading to virion production in both cell types. Transfer of HIV-1 from DCs to CD4TL occurs in two distinct phases [13, 14, 15] . During the initial phase, virus located within endosomal compartments of DCs is transported to the intercellular junction and then internalized by CD4TL. A later second phase is dependent on productive infection of DCs and storage of viral progeny. We have recently demonstrated that the C-type lectin receptor known as dendritic cell immunoreceptor or DCIR [16] allows HIV-1 to attach to DCs and enhances HIV-1 infection in both phases [17] , unlike DC-SIGN (dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non integrin), which is only involved in the early phase [18, 19] . Among the various HIV-1 cell surface receptors expressed in DCs, only DCIR has been shown to play a key role in viral dissemination, initiation of infection [17] and antiviral immunity [20] . Furthermore, it is very likely that interaction between DCIR and HIV-1 is a major factor in HIV-1 pathogenesis since DCIR expression in CD4TL is induced by HIV-1 or by apoptosis as we have previously shown [21] . CD4TL apoptosis is an indicator of HIV-1 pathogenesis in both the early and later phases of AIDS. In view of DCIR expression on DCs and its role in HIV-1 transmission in vitro, this receptor holds promise as a target for preventing HIV-1 infection and possibly decreasing HIV-1 transmission during the chronic phase of the disease, in which CD4TL apoptosis increases.",

It contains an intracellular signalling consensus sequence known as immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif or ITIM [25] , a neck domain important for HIV-1 binding that includes a carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) extracellular portion [26] , and an EPS motif (Glu-Pro-Ser), that is, a specific galactose recognition domain [25] . We have determined that the ITIM motif is required for DCIR-mediated enhancement of HIV-1 infection [27] . Furthermore, we have shown, using antibodies directed against the EPS motif or CRD domain, or by deleting the neck domain, that these extracellular portions are both involved in the binding of HIV-1 and its subsequent transfer to CD4TL [17] .",

Considering that the virus-encoded viral envelope glycoprotein gp120 is one of the most heavily glycosylated proteins known in nature (reviewed by Vigerust and Shepherd [28] ) and that DC-SIGN-dependent HIV-1 capture requires interaction between gp120 and the CRD domain of DC-SIGN [18, 29] , it might be that a similar interaction allows DCIR to act as an attachment factor for HIV-1. The EPS motif of DCIR is known to bind specifically to galactosyl residues of glycoproteins [30] . Since galactosyl residues are present on the surface of HIV-1, we designed and synthesized chemical inhibitors targeting the EPS and/or CRD domains of DCIR.",

Studies have shown that virtual docking to homology models frequently yields enrichment of known ligands as good as that obtained by docking to a crystal structure of the actual target protein [32, 34, 35] . This structure-based approach to inhibitor design has been used to identify several inhibitors of 17bhydroxysteroid dehydrogenases [36, 37, 38] and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [39] . Methodical analysis of the structure of DCIR is required to design potent and specific inhibitors of its interaction with HIV-1, via the CRD and/or EPS motifs, thereby generating potential new drugs. Since no complete or partial tertiary structure has been published for DCIR, we built a homology model using the structure of the CRD of CLEC4M ( = L-SIGN), which also interacts with gp120, as a template. Based on this model, several inhibitors were selected using virtual screening and tested using various methods. This study shows that specific chemical inhibitors directed against the EPS motif or CRD domain of DCIR prevent the attachment of HIV-1 to DCs and to apoptotic or infected CD4TL, without any side effect on CD4TL proliferation. Our DCIR homology model, in addition to providing detailed structural information, will help in the development of new lead compounds using virtual screening combined with in vivo testing.",

Figure 7A shows that A-1 decreased HIV-1 attachment to H 2 O 2 treated cells by about 50%, while B-1 did so by about 35%. The inhibitors also lowered the propagation of HIV-1 by H 2 O 2 -treated CD4TL to PHAL/IL-2 activated CD4TL by 60-80% ( Figure 7B ). CD4TL proliferation is known to be important for HIV-1 replication and we have observed that the inhibitors did not affect cell proliferation (Figure 4 ). The levels of inhibition obtained with the compounds described in this study are comparable to those observed in our previous studies using antibody, siRNA, or intracellular inhibitors [17, 48] .

B) Cells were first incubated with NL4-3 for 2 h at 37uC, washed thoroughly to remove un-adsorbed virions and cultured with autologous PHA-L/IL-2activated CD4TL in complete RPMI-1640 supplemented with rhIL-2. Cellfree supernatants were collected on day 3 and assayed for p24 content. and A4 dock in a pocket formed by Asn116, His140, Val143, Trp178, Asp180, Glu231 and Met233, while B1 and B2 dock in a pocket lined by residues His175, Trp176 Trp191, Arg194, Glu195, Pro196, Ser197, Tyr184 and Gln185. We have modelled the absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination and toxicity (ADMET) properties of our four best compounds using ADMET predictor [53, 54, 55] . As illustrated in Figure 9 , the toxicity and ADMET scores summarize the risks of low absorption from an oral dose, mutagenic activity, overall toxicity and metabolic liability. Low scores indicate low predicted toxicity or ADMET liability. Compared with the various classes of currently prescribed HIV-1 drugs, our compounds have lower scores in both risk assessments and are even better than most drugs in terms of ADMET properties. All these results are encouraging and justify future in vivo assay.",

Moreover, the anti-HIV-1 drugs developed so far promote the selection of resistant strains of the virus. The introduction of antiretroviral therapy in the mid 1990s had a strong impact on the course of HIV-1 infection throughout the world. Currently available treatments target different steps of the viral propagation cycle, such as entry into the host cell, reverse transcription, integration and protein maturation. These have led to significant reductions in HIV-related mortality [56] . Although combinations of antiretroviral drugs, such as HAART therapy, first met with resounding success, their limitations soon became obvious. Patient morbidity is enhanced and drug-resistant viruses have emerged, while no current antiretroviral therapy actually eradicates the virus from the body [57, 58] .",

In this study, a detailed three-dimensional structure of DCIR has been proposed and four inhibitors directed against the CRD domain and EPS motif of DCIR blocking HIV-1 replication and propagation have been identified. These results are clinically relevant, since blocking HIV-1 attachment to DCIR may represent a novel strategy against HIV-1 pathogenesis. Indeed, preventing the virus from binding to DCIR could lead to a significant decrease of transmission during primary infection, a period during which the virus is disseminated by mucosal DCs expressing DCIR and ultimately transferred to CD4TL. In addition, DCIR inhibitors can reduce the production of HIV-1 by the CD4TL, therefore being useful in prophylaxis/primo infection and therapeutic stages of HIV-1 infection.",

The success of pre-exposure prophylaxis or PREP [67] validates the importance of acting early, as argued by Haase [7] .

Our virtual model and screening process closely matched the actual DCIR structure. We initially screened all inhibitors for their inhibitory activity against HIV-1 binding prior to performing in vitro experiments with Raji-CD4 transfected with either DCIR or vector only. Among the A series compounds (i.e. directed against the CRD domain), compounds A2 and A3 were only weakly inhibitory to HIV-1 binding, as was B3 (directed against the EPS motif), while A1, A4 and B1 and B2 were relatively strong inhibitors. Interestingly, the two active inhibitors differ in structure, are directed against different motifs and hence have specific sites of action, based on modeling. In addition, these inhibitors had no impact on expression of the HIV-1 co-receptors CXCR4 and CCR5 (data not shown). In vitro experiments with Raji-DC-SIGN, to evaluate the specificity of these inhibitors, confirmed that they do not block HIV-1 attachment to DC-SIGN. This latter C-type lectin is known to bind several types of viruses. Based on these results, we suggest that the inhibitors, thus selected, are very likely specific for the attachment of HIV-1 to DCIR. In addition, these selected compounds shows a predicted toxicity as measured by ADMET, better than the current prescribed drugs. These are confirmed at the cellular level by our toxicity test.",

The inhibitors displayed specificity for inhibiting HIV-1 attachment and subsequent infection in immature monocyte-derived dendritic cells (iMDDCs). We previously showed that some CD4TLs express DCIR in HIV-1 patients [21] . DCIR expression increases during the infectious process and promotes trans-infection and transmission of HIV-1 to bystander cells. DCIR appears specifically linked to the infectious process and to cell apoptosis. This is important, since previous studies suggest a direct correlation between the degree of apoptosis among circulating CD4TLs and pathogenesis [70, 71] .",

            "text": "In developing novel therapeutic drugs against HIV-1 infection, one must consider the mechanism of viral replication not only inside CD4TLs, but also inside DCs. We agree with Haase (3) and other that it is crucial to find appropriate ways and means to alleviate viral load and allow the proper mounting of specific immune responses, both in the crucial early phases to avoid irreversible damage to the immune system and during the chronic phase to allow the immune system to mount effective defences. Future design of new drugs against HIV-1 infection should focus on preventing irreversible impairment of the immune system. Indeed, currently used anti-HIV-1 drugs block only the late stages of the viral life cycle and provide no protection against the earlier damage and resulting immunodeficiency that it causes. By targeting the C-type DCIR lectin found in DCs as well as in HIV-1-infected CD4LTs, the approach described in this report provides a potential avenue for effective interference with the initial propagation of HIV-1 at an early stage of the viral cycle and limit proliferation of the virus in the later stages. Extensive in vivo validation nevertheless remains to be performed in order to validate the targeting of DCIR as a therapeutic approach, as well as the safety of the drugs used for this purpose.",
