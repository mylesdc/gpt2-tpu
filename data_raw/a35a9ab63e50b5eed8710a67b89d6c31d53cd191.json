            "text": "Background: The epidemiology of New Neonatal Porcine Diarrhoea Syndrome (NNPDS) was studied in four selected herds. A total of 941 new born piglets in 86 litters were evaluated for five consecutive days. NNPDS is a newly emerged syndrome, characterized by diarrhoea within the first week of life, which is un-responsive to antibiotics and not associated with known pathogens. The aetiology behind the syndrome is unknown, and specific risk factors predisposing piglets to develop NNPDS also remain to be determined. The study evaluated sow and piglet-level risk factors for developing NNPDS and described the epidemiologic characteristics within four herds previously diagnosed with the syndrome. NNPDS was defined as diarrhoea at any time-point during the second to fifth day of life. Results: NNPDS was observed in a total of 60% (range: 39%-89%) of first parity piglets and 36% (range: 19-65%) of piglets born by mature sows. In total of 26% of piglets had liquid faeces on the day of birth. Approximately half of these piglets developed NNPDS. In the majority of cases (50-70% of cases within herds) symptoms started on the second or third day of life. Piglets in Herd 1 had12.8 times higher probability of developing NNPDS than piglets in Herd 4. First parity piglets had a 4.1 higher probability of developing NNPDS than piglets born by mature sows. Birth weight and faecal consistency on the day of birth were minor risk factors, each significant within one herd. Conclusions: The most important factors associated with NNPDS were herd of origin and sow-parity. The reason for one of the herds experiencing a considerably more severe outbreak than the others was not explained by factors addressed in this study. The epidemiological pattern of diarrhoea varied a lot between herds; however, in all herds first parity piglets seemed predisposed. This association may be explained by an infectious background of the syndrome, but further studies are needed to explain this association.",

            "text": "The inclusion of herds for this study was based upon a high prevalence of unexplained neonatal diarrhoea prior to investigation, and intensive diagnostic investigations had suggested that they were all suffering from the emerging syndrome, NNPDS [2] . However, the low prevalence of diarrhoea during the study-period in Herd 4, suggested that this herd was in fact in remission at the point of the study (this was confirmed by follow-up interviews). Since many sows in this herd were medicated on the day of farrowing, the low prevalence of diarrhoea could be hypothetically linked with this. However, data did not support this theory and according to the herd-manager the rate of medication was not higher than in preceding periods with a high prevalence of diarrhoea. According to interviews with herd-managers, the prevalence of diarrhoea during the study-periods in Herds 2 and 3 was slightly lower than normal, but otherwise reflected their normal situations quite well. A lower prevalence in the study-period can be explained by elements in the study-design made in order to evaluate risk-factors and avoid excess mortality. Thus, restricting litter sizes to a minimum, prohibiting cross-fostering as well as excluding underweight piglets could explain a lower prevalence of diarrhoea than normal. The severe symptoms in Herd 1 matched recordings carried out before and after the study-period. Investigated sow and piglet level risk factors did not give any obvious explanation for this herd to stand out. As previously published, pathological and microbiological findings in piglets from this herd did not differ markedly from findings in the remaining herds [2] . Furthermore, seasonal variations were unlikely to play a role, since Herd 1 was investigated during winter, which is the low season for neonatal diarrhoeas [3, 7] . Figure 2 Duration of NNPDS. Legend: The figure shows the number of days that piglets were diarrhoeic between day two and five of life. Piglets that were euthanized or died prior to day five of life were not included in these data. The study intended to describe the epidemiological pattern of NNPDS in terms of prevalence, timing, duration and tendency to cluster within litters. However, important limitations of the study that are relevant in the interpretation of its results need to be mentioned. An obvious limitation of the study was the fact that piglets were only examined for five days. Thus, the definition on NNPDS used in the study was made on practical grounds and should not be interpreted as if NNPDS does not occur beyond the fifth day of life. In fact, 25-50% of piglets within herds started having symptoms on the fourth or fifth day of life, and some of them were probably diarrhoeic beyond the period of examination.",

In the other herds, the association with parity was weaker, but still significant. An association with young sows is in line with previous studies on suckling piglet and neonatal diarrhoea [3, 7, 8] . Different factors, such as lower levels of colostral antibodies [9] , differences in milk composition [10] and stressful behaviour in first parity sows [11] may explain this association. Although no specific microorganism has been identified in the pathogenesis of NNPDS the overrepresentation of first parity litters may be due to lack of specific colostral immunity of a yet unknown infectious agent. It seems intriguing to interpret a tendency to cluster within litters (as seen in Herd 1 and 2) as an indication of the syndrome being of infectious nature.

Piglets to stay in the litters were selected by simple random sampling among littermates having a birth weight above 800 grams. Smaller piglets were excluded, since they were not expected to be able to survive among large litter-mates. All included piglets were kept in their original litters during the whole study period in order to be able to recognize sow-effects. During the study, selected piglets were euthanized for diagnostic purposes. Piglets euthanized without symptoms (Control piglets for the Case-Control study) were removed from data. Data used in the description of duration of symptoms only included piglets still present in the herds on day five of life.",

Leg problems were recorded when sows were unwilling to bear equal weight on all legs or evaded palpation of legs or hooves. An excess of unclear or foul-smelling discharge from vulva was recorded as vulva discharge.Piglets were weighed. The presence of hollow flanks, protruding ribs, rough hair coats, dehydration (lack of skinelasticity and sunken eye-balls), skin-abrasions on foreknees and faecal staining of perineum was dichotomously recorded. Faecal staining was assessed within a diameter of one cm around anus.

            "text": "Generalized linear mixed models with litter as random effect were used to evaluate potential risk factors for NNPDS. Due to a low prevalence of clinical disease in sows, all disease variables (mastitis, vulva discharge, leg problems and fever) were combined into one. An overview of all risk factors included in the analyses is given in Table 7 .Models were fit in R [12] using the lme4 package [13] . Model reduction was carried out using stepwise backwards elimination, removing variables with p > 0.05. Confounding was assessed by taking out and re-entering variables into the final models one by one and check for biologically important changes of estimates. Interaction terms were not included due to problems with complete separation, caused by sparse data. The linearity of birth weight at the log odds scale for NNPDS was assessed by transforming birth weight into a categorical variable based on quartiles and then verify that a decreasing trend of the estimates for the levels of the categorical variable was observed. No herd effect was included in the overall parity-separated models. 2 Litters above mean size of the parity group in question were considered large. 3 Mastitis: One or more udder section hard, red or sore when palpated. Leg problems: The sow was unwilling to bear weight on all legs or sore at palpation. Vulva discharge: An excess of unclear or foul-smelling discharge.Population average Odds Ratios (OR PA ) were calculated using the following formula:where \u03b2 SS is the Subject Specific regression coefficient and \u03b4 2 litter is the litter variance. The constant 0.346 is an approximation of the residual variance [14] .Population averaged, rather than cluster specific estimates of OR's were used, since the study aimed at drawing general rather than litter-specific conclusions.Pairwise post-hoc comparisons within significant variables with more than two levels were carried out using the lsmeans package in R [15] .Since data was limited, modelling was performed using a three-step procedure in order to be able to identify all associations of practical interest.Step 1: Two separate modelsone for first parity piglets and one for piglets born by mature (2nd-7th parity) sows -were run to identify overall sow-related risk-factors for NNPDS. The separation into two models was done in order to be able to recognize possible differences in sow-effects in first parity vs. mature sows. Furthermore, since first parity sows had smaller litters, different cut-offs were needed in the evaluation of the effect of litter size. In each model, litter size was inserted dichotomously with cut-off at the mean litter size in question (15 and 18, respectively). Herds were not included in these models, in order to avoid overlooking any subtle sow-effects.Step 2: If the results of the parity-specific models in step 2 were alike, an overall model including parity and herd-effects was generated.Step 3: Separate models for each herd were used to evaluate risk factors and random litter effects within the separate herds. These models were furthermore used to properly evaluate piglet-level risk-factors (due to the previously mentioned inability to include interaction terms in Step 2).",
