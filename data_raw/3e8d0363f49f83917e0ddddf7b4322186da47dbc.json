Mostly used in a research setting, it is now increasingly being used in the clinical realm as well, notably to support diagnosis of viral infections, thereby calling for quality control and the implementation of ring trials (RT) to benchmark pipelines and ensure comparable results. The Swiss NGS clinical virology community therefore decided to conduct a RT in 2018, in order to benchmark current metagenomic workflows used at Swiss clinical virology laboratories, and thereby contribute to the definition of common best practices. The RT consisted of two parts (increments), in order to disentangle the variability arising from the experimental compared to the bioinformatics parts of the laboratory pipeline. In addition, the RT was also designed to assess the impact of databases compared to bioinformatics algorithms on the final results, by asking participants to perform the bioinformatics analysis with a common database, in addition to using their own in-house database. Five laboratories participated in the RT (seven pipelines were tested). We observed that the algorithms had a stronger impact on the overall performance than the choice of the reference database. Our results also suggest that differences in sample preparation can lead to significant differences in the performance, and that laboratories should aim for at least 5-10 Mio reads per sample and use depth of coverage in addition to other interpretation metrics such as the percent of coverage. Performance was generally lower when increasing the number of viruses per sample. The lessons learned from this pilot study will be useful for the development of larger-scale RTs to serve as regular quality control tests for laboratories performing NGS analyses of viruses in a clinical setting.",

Then, the second increment removed the laboratory variability by starting directly from the sequencer's raw reads, and assessed the extent of variability stemming from the bioinformatics part alone. This design aimed at disentangling the variability arising from the wet lab compared to the bioinformatics parts of the pipeline. In addition, the ring trial was also designed to assess the impact of reference sequences databases compared to the bioinformatics algorithms on the final results. Thus, at each increment, participants performed the bioinformatics analysis twice, once with a SIB-provided common database (see Section 2.2), and once using their own in-house database (if applicable). Participants returned the same output as for increment 1, except for the raw reads (FASTQ).

However, in order to ensure fairness among participants, we decided to normalize the number of reads per virus to the read length, as having more reads is certainly an advantage for virus detection and identification, but that comes at a cost, resulting in a necessary trade-off to enable a routine implementation in a clinical setting. Thus, when generating the datasets, we made sure that the provided viral information, measured as the total number of bases of viral origin (i.e., number of reads of viral origin x average read length), was identical in all these settings. As an example, the dataset generated for 1 \u00d7 150 bp contained only 67% of reads of viral origin as compared to the dataset generated for 1 \u00d7 100 bp (as 100/150 = 67%). In addition, the fractions of contaminants of human and non-human origin were invariably fixed to 54% and 45% of the total number of reads, respectively, leaving 1% of reads of viral origin in each dataset. The exact number of reads in each dataset can be found in Table S2 .",

They were followed by E, F, J, A and B. Thus, on the spiked samples of increment 1, pipelines based on mapping achieved a better performance than those based on k-mers (cf. Table 3 ). We observe, however, that performance on the NIBSC multiplex viral control was in general poorer, although virus concentrations were in a similar range than for the 1:100 dilution of the spiked sample. For this sample, mapping-based methods did not systematically outperform the k-mers-based methods. The poorer performance on the viral multiplex may be explained by the large number of different viruses and the fact that this sample resembled less a real clinical sample. In increment 2, four samples were the same as in increment 1. We represent in Figure 3 the results for those samples in increment 1 compared to increment 2. Despite participants now starting from the same FASTQ dataset, we still observed a great variability in performance for the spiked samples in increment 2.

Apart from pipeline H, which did not report any virus in this negative sample, we observe that all the remaining pipelines did report at least two viruses from various families. We wondered to what extent these false positives were due to laboratory contaminants [16] (which may be corrected for by using appropriate negative controls), experimental sequencing carry-over or index hopping, or bioinformatics mapping procedures (note that all participants used the same SIB-provided database of viruses, but may have decided not to use the contaminants database that was also provided). Figure 5 shows the results obtained for the NIBSC_negative sample in increment 2, where this time the FASTQ dataset was the same for all the participants (sequenced in increment 1 by pipeline A (cf. Table 1) ). Interestingly, if the false positives were all stemming from laboratory or experimental contaminants, we would expect all pipelines to call the same false positives. This is indeed the case for two families of viruses (Polyomaviridae and Adenoviridae), consistently reported by all the pipelines as present in the negative sample. All the remaining families of false positive viruses were, however, reported by only some of the pipelines, suggesting that these may arise from the bioinformatics workflow per se. In particular, we note that pipeline H only reported the two families of viruses reported by everyone and no other false positive. Thus, even in the absence of a negative control to run alongside its samples (which likely explains the absence of false positives reported in increment 1), pipeline H also seems to have been tuned to achieve low numbers of false positives. Note that pipeline C is absent as it only returned results using its own in-house database, and not with the SIB common database.",

Figure 6 shows the F1-score obtained by the five pipelines that participated in increment 1 and used both the SIB and an in-house database. These results show no significant difference in performance for any given pipeline using the SIB compared to the in-house database (Mann-Whitney U test), suggesting that in our RT, it is the mapping/classification algorithm that is driving the overall performance, rather than the reference sequences database that is used along the algorithm.

In particular, we want to emphasize the need to use NCBI accession numbers together with regular expressions (Table S1 ) and NCBI Taxonomy in order to correctly assign each reported virus to the taxonomic resolution of interest (species-level in our case). Indeed, in clinical practice, laboratories use different names for the same virus, and we observed that they sometimes reported the virus with a more common name despite having identified it at the species level, to make their reports more reader-friendly for clinicians. When establishing such ring trials, it is therefore important to clearly ask participants to report viruses at the most detailed resolution level possible, and provide them with means to report this (e.g., NCBI Taxonomy, or NCBI accession number). This is of particular importance since viral taxonomy is not consistently defined, and thus asking for virus identification may mean different taxonomic names and levels for different laboratories depending on the virus. The reported accession number will be useful to retrieve the virus full name, before asking if it belongs to the expected list of viruses at the chosen resolution level. In this sense, it is also essential that the list of allowed names for each of the expected viruses at the chosen resolution level is made available after such proficiency tests for participants review (cf. Table S1 in our ring trial). For increment 2, we also decided to ask participants to directly indicate in the metrics file which viruses they would report to clinicians, as the produced reports did not always mention NCBI accession numbers.",

Our results in Figure 2a suggest that in this context, a depth per virus of about 10\u00d7, as achieved by pipeline I, may be a rational target for high quality output results. Achieving a sequencing depth of 10\u00d7 per reported virus can, however, be difficult and not always feasible, especially in samples other than plasma having a higher biomass and for low replicating viruses. Thus, others have suggested to use instead\u22653 non-overlapping reads in distinct genomic regions as a criterion for reporting viruses in cerebrospinal fluid samples [1] . Ultimately, the target depth of coverage might likely depend on the envisioned application and type of sample. This may also have consequences on what can be expected in terms of sensitivity and precision, and what sample processing steps, bioinformatics tools and interpretation criteria may need to be fine-tuned accordingly to compensate for e.g., the lower depth of coverage per virus in some applications. As a result, the performance criteria notably in an accredited setting may end up being application-specific to some extent, or require, e.g., additional complementary validation tests to confirm the metagenomics results, as discussed in [3] for the identification of viral encephalitis, meningoencephalitis and meningitis. In the end, it is important to bear in mind that clinical metagenomics assays will likely not be used alone or as systematic first-line tests, but rather in combination with other diagnostic tests that all together will let clinicians take the best decisions for the patient.",

One of the aims was to assess the impact of the database compared to the algorithms on performance. Interestingly, we observed that the database that we provided enabled participants to get as good results as they would get using their own in-house database ( Figure 6 ). One reason for this finding may be that participating laboratories have hired bioinformaticians and dedicate resources in (semi-automatically/automatically) refining their internal databases and do not simply download all NCBI viruses, likely achieving already good quality databases similar to the one we provided. Thus, in our settings (i.e., rather common viruses and Swiss clinical context), it appears that the impact of the database was rather low on the overall performance. It is however unclear how generalizable this finding may be, given the limited number of tested viruses in our samples and the small number of participating laboratories. Since we did not test several databases of varying qualities, we would still recommend taking advantage of the expert curated databases that are being published (cf. Material and Methods and references therein) to optimize the speed of bioinformatics workflow, decrease the false positive calls in general (cf. Figure S20) , and also increase sensitivity for less sequenced viruses. In general, for the implementation of future ring trials, we find that providing a common database is not necessary, as long as the in-house databases of participants include NCBI accession numbers to enable the tracking of each virus to the desired taxonomic level.",

Surprisingly, for the laboratories from whom we had picked the FASTQ datasets, we noticed that the performance achieved at increment 1 was not always replicated in increment 2, despite starting with identical FASTQ files. This notably highlights the importance of human interpretation at the end of the bioinformatics workflow. Indeed, while some participants indicated having clear interpretation criteria (e.g., minimum absolute number of reads mapping to a virus, minimum number of non-overlapping reads, minimum percentage of coverage) in addition to manual inspection, several participants also mentioned performing only a manual inspection. Interestingly, depth of coverage was not mentioned as one of the reporting criteria, although we observed in increment 1 (Figure 2a ) that a depth of coverage of 10\u00d7 and beyond was associated with top performance. We could however not reproduce this finding in increment 2 (Figure 2b) , perhaps highlighting the fact that workflows have been optimized as a whole (i.e., from sample to report), and not in separate blocks (e.g., laboratory procedures only, or bioinformatics workflow only). This finding perhaps questions the utility of performing ring trials assessing only one part of the workflow, by e.g., starting from common FASTQ datasets. From another perspective, this also highlights that participants should be cautious when analyzing data that do not originate from their own laboratory. Ultimately, human interpretation very likely has a substantial impact on overall performance. In this sense, we also suggest that the clinical viral community should share more interpretation and reporting practices, in order to further harmonize their practices and increase overall knowledge with more expertise sharing. The impact of human review and the observation that one pipeline did not reproduce its findings starting from an identical FASTQ dataset also calls for individual laboratories more clearly defining internal standard interpretation criteria, which would help reduce the impact of the differential human review and likely be essential in an accredited context to ensure results reproducibility over time.",

In increment 1, pipelines E, F, H and J nevertheless used internal controls alongside the provided samples ( Figure S7) . Pipeline H used a negative control (water submitted to the whole NGS process), whereas pipelines E, F and J used a well characterized sample as an internal control (weak positive for one virus). Of these pipelines, however, only pipeline H correctly identified the negative sample as being negative, thus being able to correctly deplete real contaminants from its data, while not adding type-I errors due to wrong mapping/classification in the bioinformatics step. Pipelines E, F and J however still reported viruses in the negative sample, suggesting these may arise mostly from type-I errors during the bioinformatics step. In increment 2 ( Figure 5 ), we also observed that it is likely laboratory contaminants and type-I errors that affect the participants' false positive rate. In this sense, always running a negative control alongside is certainly very good practice to deplete laboratory contaminants, but not sufficient to avoid false positives calls in the bioinformatics step.",

In addition, as pipeline I had identified viruses in various settings (1 \u00d7 100 bp, 1 \u00d7 150 bp, 1 \u00d7 250 bp), we display here the results obtained only with 1 \u00d7 150 bp, which correspond to the sequencing settings they used in increment 1.
