In this study, nuclear localization of ORF2 was demonstrated by fluorescence observation and subcellular fractionation assays in ORF2-transfected PK-15 cells. The subcellular localization of truncated ORF2 indicated that the 38 N-terminal amino acids were responsible for the nuclear localization of ORF2. The truncated and site-directed mutagenesis of this domain were constructed, and the results demonstrated that the basic amino acid residues at positions 8-32 were essential for the strict nuclear localization. The basic motifs 8 RRR-R-RRR 16 and 16 RRRHRRR 22 were further shown to be the key functional nucleolar localization signals that guide PCV3 ORF2 into nucleoli. Furthermore, sequence analysis showed that the amino acids of PCV3 nuclear localization signals were highly conserved. Overall, this study provides insight into the biological and functional characteristics of the PCV3 ORF2 protein.",

The NLS is a short stretch of amino acids that mediates the transport of nuclear proteins into the nucleus. NLS motifs play a key role in this mechanism. NLS sequences are often composed of basic amino acids and can be classified as either monopartite or bipartite motifs [17, 18] . The nuclear targeting of PCV2 ORF2 is directed by the bipartite motifs situated at the N-terminus of the proteins [14, 15] . NLSs of PCV1 ORF2 show high homologies to classical monopartite or bipartite NLS, which is essential for the complete nuclear import of PCV1 ORF2. The N-terminus of PCV1 and PCV2 ORF2 contain several conserved basic amino acid stretches [15, 19] , and shares 70.7% in nucleotide identity and 82.9% in amino acid similarity.",

PCV2 is the primary etiological agent of porcine circovirus-associated diseases (PCVAD) that cause severe losses in the swine industry worldwide [3] . Recently, a novel circovirus was identified by next-generation sequence (NGS) analysis of aborted fetuses of sows and named PCV3. PCV3 was first reported in the USA in 2016 [4] . Since then, PCV3 has been detected in many countries, and it is associated with porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome, congenital tremors, reproductive failure, and multi-systemic inflammation [5] [6] [7] [8] .",

PCV3 is associated with porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome, congenital tremors, reproductive failure, and multi-systemic inflammation. PCV3 infection in piglets triggers inflammatory lesions in various tissues and organs followed by lymphocytic dysplasia and necrosis, and disruption of the immune system [20] . However, the exact pathogenesis of PCV3 remains unclear [21] [22] [23] . The genome of PCV3 contains two major open reading frames (ORFs): ORF1 encoding replicase and ORF2 encoding capsid [24] . The capsid protein is a karyophilic protein located in the nucleus [14, 16] . We found that PCV3 ORF2 could also target the nucleus. Sequence analysis indicated that the N-terminus of PCV3 ORF2 contained many conserved basic amino acids. Investigation of subcellular localization of truncated PCV3 ORF2 fused with EGFP showed that the 38 amino acids at the N-terminus were necessary and sufficient to direct the accumulation of protein in nucleus. This is similar to PCV1 and PCV2 ORF2 [15, 19] .",

To study the essential NLS motifs at the N-terminal of PCV3 ORF2, truncations or substitutions of basic amino acids were introduced into these stretches. Three NLS motifs in PCV3-ORF2 (NLS1, NLS2, and NLS3) were identified. NLS1 ( 8 RRR-R-RRR 16 ) and NLS2 ( 16 RRRHRRR 22 ) were two contiguous motifs. These stretches showed homology to the \"pat4\" motif consisting of four continuous basic residues, or the \"bipartite\" motif that contains two stretches of basic amino acids segregated by non-conserved residues [26] . The similar motifs were also identified in PCV1 ORF2 ( 4 PRRR-RRRR-RPR-H 18 ) and PCV2 ORF2 ( 4 PRRR-RRRRHRPR 18 ) [15, 19] . The subcellular fractionation results showed that NLS1 and NLS2 could direct strict nucleus localization, which was similar to the full-length PCV3 ORF2. The other \"pat4\" motif NLS3 fused with EGFP displayed almost equal nucleo-cytoplasmic distribution. These data suggest that NLS1 and NLS2 are the key NLSs in the nuclear localization of PCV3 ORF2 and that NLS3 plays an auxiliary role.",

            "text": "DNA synthesis of circoviruses occurs exclusively in the nucleus of host cells, but the active nuclear import of DNA molecules might require karyophilic proteins [14] . In the case of circoviruses, such as PCVs and beak and feather disease virus (BFDV), the NLS region of is important for ssDNA accumulation [14, 16] . The N-terminal of PCV2 ORF2 can interact with the nuclear membrane receptor (gC1qR) to regulate DNA [27] . This suggests that the NLS region of PCV3 ORF2 may be involved in DNA binding. In addition, PONDR analysis predicted that the N-terminal of PCV2 ORF2 was a disordered peptidic region lacking a well-defined 3D structure under physiological conditions [27] . This arginine-rich region has a high probability of being exposed to solvent and then interacting with surrounding proteins [28] . The NLS region may contain some dominant epitopes, and these epitopes may influence the antigenicity of Cap. Further study is needed to verify whether there are dominant epitopes in the NLS region of PCV3 ORF2. Nucleolar localization has been described for the proteins of many DNA and RNA viruses [29] . These viral proteins play multifunctional roles in regulating cellular transcription [30, 31] , virus transcription [32] , virus translation [33] , and cell division [34] . For example, hepatitis delta virus (HDV) was studied for nucleolar localization and it was found that interacting with nucleolin promoted viral replication [35] . PCV1 ORF2 was localized in the nucleoli during PCV1 early infection, followed by co-localization with Rep in the nucleoplasm [36] . In addition, the PCV1 and PCV2 ORF2 might help regulate viral replication by interacting with Rep [37] . These suggest that the nucleolar localization signals in PCV3 ORF2 might be involved in the regulation of viral replication. Further studies will be needed to detail the function of nucleolar localization signals. The findings will clarify the function of PCV3 ORF2 in the viral replication and pathogenicity. ",
