            "text": "The International Consortium for Prevention and Infection Control (ICPIC) organises a biannual conference (ICPIC) on various subjects related to infection prevention, treatment and control. During ICPIC 2015, held in Geneva in June 2015, a full one-day session focused on the 2014-2015 Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa. This article is a non-exhaustive compilation of these discussions. It concentrates on lessons learned and imagining a way forward for the communities most affected by the epidemic. The reader can access video recordings of all lectures delivered during this one-day session, as referenced. Topics include the timeline of the international response, linkages between the dynamics of the epidemic and infection prevention and control, the importance of community engagement, and updates on virology, diagnosis, treatment and vaccination issues. The paper also includes discussions from public health, infectious diseases, critical care and infection control experts who cared for patients with EVD in Africa, in Europe, and in the United Sates and were involved in Ebola preparedness in both high-and low-resource settings and countries. This review concludes that too little is known about the pathogenesis and treatment of EVD, therefore basic and applied research in this area are urgently required. Furthermore, it is clear that epidemic preparedness needs to improve globally, in particular through the strengthening of health systems at local and national levels. There is a strong need for culturally sensitive approaches to public health which could be designed and delivered by social scientists and medical professionals working together. As of December 2015, this epidemic killed more than 11,000 people and infected more than 28,000; it has also generated more than 17,000 survivors and orphans, many of whom face somatic and psychological complications. The continued treatment and rehabilitation of these people is a public health priority, which also requires an integration of specific medical and social science approaches, not always available in West Africa.",

As with other RNA viruses, the mutation rate is high: around one error per 10,000 to 100 000 nucleotides, which corresponds to one mistake per replication on average. Furthermore, gene exchange and recombination between viruses is possible. On the whole, the Ebola virus displays a high diversity, a high mutation rate, and it also probably has a large animal reservoir. These are three contributing factors that make epidemics probable.",

There are indications that the viral load in the present Makona epidemic may be up to 1000 times higher than in the Boende/Kikwit epidemic [13] . Moreover, clinical course in cynomologus macaques infected with the Makona variant seems to be slightly different compared to what has previously been observed with other variants; death occurs later in the course of the disease, and diarrhoea is more profuse, increasing the spread of infectious body fluids [14] . Furthermore, while no difference has been shown in decay rates of the Makona variant compared to the historical Yambuku variant in different matrices, the former seems to be more resistant during the drying process in human blood in experimental conditions mimicking the West African environment [15] . Those specific viral factors, combined with geographic, economic, social, and cultural determinants might explain the rapid expansion of the EVD epidemic in West Africa. Indeed, this outbreak marked the first reported EVD in this part of Africa; the lack of preparedness in countries suffering from poor health infrastructure, the geographic situation at the border of 3 different countries near major road networks enabling important human mobility to major capital cities, rooted beliefs in traditional medicine, burial practices, and reluctance to and fear of official health interventions have all participated to the unprecedented spread of the virus [16] . As in many other viral outbreaks, super spreaders are a significant problem [17] . For example, in 2014, a burial ceremony in Kenema, Sierra Leone, gave rise to 345 secondary cases [18] .",

From 2011, MSF had also been running a malaria programme in Gu\u00e9ck\u00e9dou, Guinea, where the index case of the 2014-2015 EVD epidemic was identified. In March 2014, the Ministry of Health of Guinea transmitted to MSF 15 case descriptions, of which nine had been fatal. All were from the same family group or were staff from the local hospital. The report was transmitted to MSF headquarters in Geneva where Ebola virus infection was rapidly suspected because one of the cases was described as having hiccups. MSF raised the alarm within 48 h and sent further staff to the field in the following days. The affected population was mobile and crossing borders, so the very first step was to isolate patients.

MSF had never had to manage more than 40 beds or two medical centres before, had never been confronted by a new disease crossing borders, and had never had staff infected. The first lesson is that qualified HCWs continued to volunteer with MSF throughout the crisis; there was no recruitment problem. The second lesson is that some specific places are particularly dangerous, such as triage points, which are dangerous for staff where many of the infections probably occurred. Triage areas and suspect areas tend to group together people with symptoms that could be either EVD or malaria. It is therefore vitally important to supply individual rooms, with low risk corridors leading through high-risk areas. Structures allowing EVD patient to be visited with no risk for cross-transmission are also critical (see Fig. 1 ). The ETC in Foya, managed by MSF, with safe corridors leading through the high-risk zone, was the only setting where the outbreak was brought under control within three months. With hindsight, most actors in the field would agree that the international reaction to the EVD outbreak was too slow. Although this requires further research, the existence of a treatment might have accelerated the response. In any case, another lesson learned is that, facing epidemics with high transmission and fatality rates, experimental treatments need to be made available very quickly.",

During the course of the 2014-2015 EVD epidemic, there was a media obsession for PPE, while other very important measures such as hand hygiene, clean water or functioning toilets were rarely mentioned. Because PPE is an important measure for EVD control, WHO issued rapid guidance on the subject during the course of the epidemic, based on expert consultations [22] .

Interventions were branded responses rather than interventions, in order to emphasise that the community is part of the solution. Based on practice-based evidence [28] , the approach draws on participatory approaches. The key steps are indicated in Table 3 . Most importantly, a process of community assets mapping creates an inventory of capacities rather than a bundle of deficits or pathologies.

These monitoring forms clearly do not correspond to an ideal study design. However, experience with HIV in the 1980s has shown that randomised placebo-controlled trials are not always possible.",

Simulations and simulation sessions' debriefings were also organized. Finally, a procedure was set out in case of an accidental exposure of a staff member to the virus.",

The high containment unit at NIH near Washington DC, was one of the three hospitals in the USA (others were in Atlanta and in Nebraska) that was shortlisted to possibly receive a patient by the US federal authorities. The NIH had prepared from 2009 a safe containment room for patients with any infectious conditions [79] . It contains four rooms, one of which is a high-level containment isolation room. In addition, the unit is supported by a room with one large and two small autoclaves. Table 4 lists the main elements identified as success factors for handling an EVD patient. When it was thought that a patient might actually be admitted, the atmosphere changed. An internal call for healthcare volunteers was highly successful and a flexible staffing model was developed. A \"buddy system\" was used, with two nurses in the room for a critically-ill patient, one in the anteroom and one at the nurses' station. Trained observers were used and rapidly proved to be critical for ensuring the adequacy of donning and doffing procedures. Anticipated laboratory requirements were established. Daily debriefings established what worked and what could be improved. A clear, transparent communication plan was set up, with neighbouring institutions including other hospitals and schools.",

The following day, in neighbouring New Jersey, a nurse returning from Sierra Leone was confined to a quarantine tent for three days despite having no EVD-specific symptoms.

Also, Spencer underlined that allowing restrictions such as quarantines to occur when they are not in line with official public health recommendations (issued by the CDC for the USA) undermines and erodes confidence in the ability of citizens to respond cohesively to public health crises. Other critics believe that there was too much confidence that the USA and its institutions could handle EVD cases.

In the well-equipped isolation room in the intensive care unit at HUG, a large number of staff were available to treat a single patient (see above). A complete virology laboratory was at hand, with reverse transcription real-time PCR (real-time RT-PCR), ELISA assays for IgG and IgM, and haematological and chemical tests that could be performed at the bedside. The patient had access to two experimental treatments: the ZMAb cocktail containing three EBOV-glycoprotein-specific neutralising monoclonal antibodies and the antiviral favipiravir (see above). An important point is that a lot of personnel and time were necessary, to treat a single patient. Graphs were produced every day and sometimes several times a day, to monitor the dynamics of EVD and body responses. For example, it could be observed that the emergence of the IgG response in this patient took 11 days, with a rapid increase in the IgG titres thereafter [30] .",

These thoughts led to a race towards an Ebola vaccine. At that time, only two Ebola vaccine candidates had been shown to be 100 % protective in non-human primates and were available according to good manufacturing practice. Both were vector vaccines expressing the envelope gene of the Ebola virus Zaire strain. The first was ChAd3-ZEBOV, a live non-replicating chimpanzee adenovirus, licenced by NIAID (USA) to the GSK company [81] . Preliminary trials in the UK, USA, Mali and Switzerland had shown the vaccine to be safe with no serious adverse effects (although flu-like symptoms were frequent) [82] [83] [84] . A relatively high dose of 2 \u00d7 10 11 plaque-forming units (PFU) was required to induce antibody responses. Subsequent trials on lower doses (between 1 \u00d7 10 10 and 5 \u00d7 10 10 PFU) were associated with satisfactory T-cell responses but that were not sustained for more than a few weeks. Therefore, the ChAd3-ZEBOV vaccine has been recommended as a \"prime-boost\" vaccine requiring at least two doses and a large primary dose (2 \u00d7 10 11 ) for phase II/III trials.",

Too little is known about the pathogenesis and the treatment of EVD, so basic and applied research in this field is urgently required. Data on viral kinetics are still scarce, but viral load is clearly related to survival. Specific clinical features of the infection with the Makona variant may have led to extend the spread of the outbreak. Moreover, it is clear now that the virus can persist in immunologically protected body sites up to 9 months after an individual has been declared cured. This explains some of the complications and also poses several questions regarding sexual transmission of the disease.",

The three countries most affected by the Ebola epidemic have almost no psychologists with the training necessary to face such a task. And little is known about how communities can cope with rumours and fear related to tragic and disruptive events such as an EVD epidemic. Such problems need to be addressed within the general framework of health systems recovery and development, and require integrated medical and social science approaches.",

            "text": "Edward Kelley, of the Patient Safety Secretariat at WHO, presented the timeline of the response to the Ebola virus disease (EVD) crisis. He explains how WHO set up a roadmap from August 2014 in order to achieve full coverage with a comprehensive Ebola intervention package across the three most affected countries. In retrospect, he sees three phases in the epidemic, the third of whichhealth systems recovery and strengtheningremains to be comprehensively addressed. Video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFK-Bzy5c6M Sergey Eremin, of the Infection prevention and control (IPC) team at WHO, showed how images of healthcare professionals with spectacular protective clothing stole the limelight from other aspects of IPC during the EVD crisis. A key lesson learned from this outbreak and from IPC programmes elsewhere is the importance of IPC assessment toolssome of them electronicwhich can help make the approach to IPC more systematic at community and healthcare facility levels. Video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrBQM-C9CB8 Esther Sterk and Hugues Robert-Nicoud, of M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF), explained how MSF played a key role during all phases of the EVD outbreak, and especially in its initial phases because MSF was already active in the area where the outbreak began. Despite experience with almost all the filovirus epidemics that h occurred over the previous 20 years, MSF had never been confronted by an outbreak of such complexity and scale. MSF's approach and its six-pillar Ebola management system are explained. Lessons learned are reviewed with a critical perspective. Video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el0zhxCCgnQ Babacar Ndoye, an expert in IPC and microbiology and a consultant for WHO, gave a talk on the deployment of anthropologists during the response to the EVD outbreak. The objective was to understand why and how resistance to health workers developed and to find common ground between the needs of the community and healthcare priorities. A multimodal strategy based on knowledge of local history and customs and appropriate choice of entry persons was used, thus positioning anthropological interventions as an emerging good practice. Video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ml02V6biT0 Frederick Marais, of the Western Cape Government and Stellenbosch University in Cape Town, South Africa, shared insights into the CARE model. This culturally sensitive framework for engaging local communities is based on practice-based evidence and has 8 key steps aiming at improving the cultural congruence of responses without compromising safety. In the context of the EBV epidemic, the CARE framework was used to promote IPC measures emphasising that communities are part of the solution. Video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXjlJKQ5qtw Donal Brown, of UKaid, shared his impressions gathered in the field, while coordinating the Ebola response in Sierra Leone. When he arrived in September 2014, the perception was that the international community had moved too slowly, and too late. He explains how a joint inter-agency taskforce then supported the Government of Sierra Leone in its response to the outbreak. Among lessons learned are that humanitarian, healthcare and military sectors can work together, especially at district and community levels. Video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jX4xpgMbCiU Olivier Hagon, of the Swiss Humanitarian Aid Unit, described how a project coordinated in Liberia during the autumn of 2014 enabled the local production of alcohol-based hand rub solutions as well as training programmes for pharmacists and other healthcare professionals. A follow-up mission in 2015 confirmed the sustainability of the project regarding the local production of the hand rub solutions, including quality control, under the aegis of the Liberian Ministry of Health.",

            "text": "Video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Bgp-twcGHw Laurent Kaiser, of the Division of infectious diseases of University of Geneva Hospitals, contributed a detailed explanation on the virology of the Ebola virus, focusing on biosafety, diagnosis and the various experimental treatments that are emerging. Current challenges are reviewed, such as the fact that some chemicals required for diagnosis are not being shared and that further studies are necessary to understand how the virus multiplies and maintains itself in vivo. Video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HjC8UtzVbY Alexandra Calmy, of the HIV unit at the University of Geneva Hospitals, contributed a \"tale of two viruses\". Similarities and differences between Ebola virus and HIV are reviewed, with a focus on HIV services which need to be maintained during other epidemics. For the response against Ebola, relevant lessons from HIV include interventions to reduce stigma, screening programmes, engaging affected communities and ensuring continued access to treatment. Video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2o7eErripP4 Manuel Schibler, an infectious diseases physician at the University of Geneva Hospitals, proposed a comparison of the handling of EVD patients in Switzerland and Sierra Leone. Among the many differences are the high number of trained staff available in well-resourced countries, while the RT-PCR diagnostic equipment turned out to be the same in both settings. The most shocking difference is the case fatality rate, which is 2.5 times higher in West Africa. Video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq_G1Rta2EU Benedetta Allegranzi, of the WHO Patient safety programme, described the many linkages between the Ebola crisis and infection prevention and control (IPC). She explains that one of the reasons why the epidemic was so complex and severe was a lack of infrastructure for water and sanitation throughout communities and healthcare centres, compounded by poor adherence to International Health Regulations and a belated international response. Video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVysm-et00 J\u00e9r\u00f4me Pugin, a critical care physician at the University of Geneva Hospitals (HUG), explained how a Cuban doctor medivaced from West Africa was treatedsuccessfullyin a specialised unit in Geneva, within a hospital which had to continue functioning while the many events and procedures linked to EVD were taking place. The importance of preparedness and teamwork are among the key aspects described in this contribution. Video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upxyxopNKDc David Henderson, of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Centre in Bethesda, Maryland, delivered a critical analysis of how an EVD patient was treated in the United States. According to his account, the management of human waste, medical waste and even non-contaminated waste was a challenge, because key people and institutions refused to accept them due to irrational fear. Video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a26KVrWU38 Julie-Anne Dayer, of the University of Geneva Hospitals (HUG), described the various complications facing the over 10,000 survivors of the EVD epidemic. Her contribution is based on the limited published data on the subject, and on direct observation at the MSF survivors' clinic in Freetown. As well as somatic and psychological complaints, a key problem is that the virus can remain present in some body fluids several weeks after patients are released from hospital with \"virus-free\" status. Video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omImULFapeM Claire-Anne Siegrist is at the Centre for Vaccinology and at the WHO Collaborating centre for Vaccine Immunology of the University of Geneva Hospitals (HUG). She describes the race for an Ebola vaccine that played out during the 2014-2015 period, reviewing current candidate vaccines and their trials. She concludes that the vaccine pipeline which was empty at the beginning of 2014 is now full, and that there now is an international obligation to deliver a functioning vaccine before any future outbreaks occur.
