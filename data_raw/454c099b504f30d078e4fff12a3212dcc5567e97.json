            "text": "The Burden of Communicable Diseases in Europe (BCoDE) study aimed to calculate disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for 31 selected diseases in the European Union (EU) and European Economic Area (EEA). Methods: DALYs were estimated using an incidence-based and pathogen-based approach. Incidence was estimated through assessment of data availability and quality, and a correction was applied for under-estimation. Calculation of DALYs was performed with the BCoDE software toolkit without applying time discounting and age-weighting. Results: We estimated that one in 14 inhabitants experienced an infectious disease episode for a total burden of 1.38 million DALYs (95% uncertainty interval (UI): 1.25-1.5) between 2009 and 2013; 76% of which was related to the acute phase of the infection and its short-term complications. Influenza had the highest burden (30% of the total burden), followed by tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection/ AIDS and invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). Men had the highest burden measured in DALYs (60% of the total), adults 65 years of age and over had 24% and children less than 5 years of age had 11%. Age groupspecific burden showed that infants (less than 1 year of age) and elderly people (80 years of age and over) experienced the highest burden. Conclusions: These results provide baseline estimates for evaluating infectious disease prevention and control strategies.",

Evidence to determine priorities is often limited and epidemiological data may be unavailable, of uncertain quality or difficult to communicate to decision makers. Burden of disease estimates, using composite health measures, provide clear and comprehensive information for transparent and accountable decision making and have the potential to play an important role in health policy formulation [1] . Numerous studies have addressed the challenge of estimating disease burden regionally, nationally and globally [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] .",

During these steps, together with ECDC surveillance experts, we considered surveillance systems' characteristics, including case definition, case-based vs aggregate reporting, compulsory vs voluntary reporting, comprehensive vs sentinel surveillance and whether or not the surveillance system had national coverage. Notification rates were also reviewed in relation to epidemiological circumstances (e.g. outbreaks and disease exposure), reporting practices, healthcare providers' awareness, and healthcare system characteristics. For a number of diseases, i.e. campylobacteriosis, chlamydia infection, congenital toxoplasmosis, influenza, pertussis and salmonellosis, it was concluded that it was not possible to estimate the incidence from notified data and alternative methods were applied (see Supplement 3).

Although the CFP chosen for the influenza disease model was low, the incidence was significantly higher than that of any other disease included in our study ( Table 2 ). The main driver of the high burden of influenza is the contribution of premature mortality associated with the infection (YLL). Our study estimated a mortality of 5.89 per 100,000 population, slightly lower than the ECDC-estimated annual average influenza deaths in EU/EAA countries of 7.60 per 100,000 population (range: 1.07-15.5) within the same period based on the published figures of 38,500 deaths (range: 5,400 to 78,200) [35] . Similar mortality rates were published in national studies in the Netherlands: 3.69 to 18.8 However, it is important to note the limitations of our estimation of DALYs for influenza, namely the single incidence data source, the Flu Watch cohort study in the United Kingdom, representing a limited geographical region [30] which may have a different epidemiological profile and vaccination coverage from other EU/EEA countries. However, the Southern Hemisphere Influenza and Vaccine Effectiveness Research and Surveillance project (SHIVERS) in New Zealand found a very similar incidence of symptomatic influenza (personal communication, Sue Huang and Don Bandaranayake, July 2016). Moreover, the Netherlands national burden of disease study [5] Our results for influenza support the recommendations of the Council of the European Union [39] , reiterated by the 2015 ECDC influenza vaccination report [40] , to develop a national seasonal influenza vaccination action plan and to achieve target vaccination coverage for older population groups, people with chronic medical conditions, pregnant women and healthcare workers.",

This study estimated that 0.15 deaths per 100,000 population were due to HIV/AIDS. Given our incidence-based approach, one must consider that this estimation is a projection of future mortality rates for people being infected in the time-period analysed, i.e. 2009 to 2013.

Similarly, published IPD incidence and mortality estimates in the Netherlands based on sentinel surveillance and statistical estimation methods [44] reported incidence of 13.8 per 100,000 population and deaths of 1.6 per 100,000 population, which are very similar to those presented in our paper. Based on our study, most of the burden of IPD is experienced by adults over 55 years of age, although children aged under 5 years also significantly contribute to the total DALYs (see Supplement 4) . These findings are relevant to discussions about vaccination strategies since, according to ECDC's report on invasive bacterial diseases in 2012, 'the majority of infections were caused by serotypes covered by the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine PCV13' [45] . Ranking of diseases can be also tailored to specific age groups as illustrated in Figure 7 . It is interesting to note that all five top ranking diseases among the less than 15 years of age group are preventable through vaccination. Within the adult population, further research on the main risk groups affected by HIV/AIDS and TB, which by far are the two infections with the highest impact, would be advantageous in order to better inform intervention strategies. The elderly population is mostly affected by respiratory diseases (influenza, IPD, TB and Legionnaires' disease) and gastro-intestinal diseases (campylobacteriosis and salmonellosis). Age-specific vaccination campaigns could help prevent the burden of influenza and IPD in particular.",

Their cumulative burden of 501 DALYs per 100,000 population in that study was almost twice the one found in this one. These results imply that, among those surveyed by ECDC, HAIs represent the infections with the highest burden on European population. However, the methodological differences relating to the syndromic approach chosen for the burden of HAIs vs the pathogen-based approach of this study may limit comparing the results of the two studies. In particular, a number of diseases included in the current study may have been healthcare-associated (e.g. Legionnaires' disease, diseases attributable to Streptococcus pneumoniae), leading to some degree of double-counting [47, 48] . However, this would likely be limited given that other diseases included in the present study may be uncommon causes of HAIs (e.g. infections due to Neisseria meningitidis, TB, hepatitis A and B and invasive meningococcal disease) [47, 48] .",

In other instances, such as for Legionnaires' disease, countries were grouped according to ECDC disease programme expert opinion into higher, intermediate and lower surveillance system sensitivity and different multiplication factors were then applied for each sensitivity group. The sensitivity of surveillance systems does not only depend on their intrinsic characteristics; systems are also prone to temporary changes, for example, during outbreaks, when increased awareness might also increase willingness and capacity to detect and report cases. For the estimation of the incidence of measles, for example, notification of cases from countries and years experiencing an outbreak were adjusted with a multiplication factor of 1.5 [51] , as opposed to 2.5 for other countries and years [52, 53] .",

For example, vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs) with high coverage had a lower burden of disease, but they had the potential to substantially increase their burden and their resulting position in the final ranking during outbreaks.
